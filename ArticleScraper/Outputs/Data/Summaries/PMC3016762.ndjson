{"summary": "phylogenetic analyses have shown that the virus is unlike other coronaviruses of animal and human origin. most recently recognized novel emergent viruses have been zoonotic, usually with a reservoir in wildlife. only about half of the cases in Guangdong are attributed to contact with a SARS patient. hypotheses generated by epidemiologic studies should be briskly followed by intensive, focused, laboratory studies where relevant. virologic surveys have already been conducted among prevalent animal populations, including those known to harbor other coronaviruses or other viruses transmissible to humans or wild animals. the initial hypothesis was that the virus attenuated after multiple generations of transmission. this is possible if there had been earlier spread of a less virulent coronavirus. this would require a good deal of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease. this scenario would require a good deal of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease. china could participate in multinational studies to define the characteristics of super-spreaders. of particular interest is the virus load of super-spreaders, compared with those of other infected persons. specimens from Chinese patients provide the longest observation window with which mutational tendencies can be evaluated. one lineage is represented by the chain of transmission associated with the physician from Guangzhou who traveled to Hong Kong in February. the other lineage is associated with isolates from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Beijing (11). extraordinary clinical expertise exists among health professionals in Guangdong province. they have substantial experience with a variety of antivirals, antibiotics, alternative (herbal) medicines, and corticosteroids. randomized clinical trials have not been conducted, but careful compilation of existing case series data would be helpful in evaluating potential effectiveness of various management regimens. the work outlined here involves descriptive and epidemiologic inquiry, fundamental to establishing an understanding of this new pathogen and disease. support must first be established for systematically addressing these basic questions and rapidly disseminating results through publication in international journals, presentations at international meetings. china has begun to vigorously address the need for better surveillance, accurate reporting, and forthright public communication. identifying the modest resources needed to implement the work should not be a barrier. support from the government will be needed to carry out valid, transparent studies, and for permission to report the findings."}
