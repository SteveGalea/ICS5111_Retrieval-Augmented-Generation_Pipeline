{"summary": "LAMs act as a source of affordable, live or freshly slaughtered animals. spread of a virus within the market is often enhanced due to high density, close contact animal housing. animals remain in the market for extended periods of time until sold. the virus showed no molecular markers associated with increased virulence in birds or mammals. they replicated and transmitted effectively in chickens, explaining the spread throughout the market, but caused little morbidity in Balb/c mice. the genetic similarity to H11 viruses isolated from South American shorebirds suggests that the LAM occurrence may have resulted from a wild bird to domestic poultry spillover. Viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from 50 L sample using the Ambion MagMAX-96 AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation kit. Isolates were confirmed by hemagglutination assay (HA) and RT-qPCR. full-length gene segments were ligated into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Life Technologies Corporation) and amplified in HB101 E. coli strain. smaller gene fragments produced using HA1134F/HA-NS 890R primers were sequenced directly after gel purification. in vitro replication MDCK and A549 cells (ATCC, CCL-185) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium. cells were infected at a multiplicity of 0.01 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C then washed three times to remove unbound virus. g/mL l -1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was collected at 6, 24 48 and 72 h post-infection. viral titers were determined by TCID50 in MDCK cells. influenza viruses were bound to fetuin-coated plates at 4 \u00b0C overnight. chicken experiments performed as described previously. 8-week-old specific pathogen-free chickens (n=5 per group) were inoculated with 106 EID50 of virus in 0.5 mL via intraocular, intranasal and intratracheal routes. sample collection was conducted between February and September 2015 in a LAM in Medellin, Colombia. there are five regularly established poultry sellers at the LAM. around 2500 birds are available for sale at any given time. Isolates were confirmed by hemagglutination assay (HA) and RT-qPCR and viral titers determined by Reed and Munch27 with both 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) and by 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) gene segments and cytochrome-oxidase similarities were analyzed by BLAST. nucleotide sequences obtained in this study are available from GenBank under accession numbers KX097952 to KX097966. in vitro replication MDCK and A549 cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C then washed three times to remove unbound virus. mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally inoculated with 104 TCID50 of virus in 25 L PBS. at day 3 and 6 pi, n=3 mice were euthanized and nasal washes and lungs were harvested for viral titers by TCID50. Swabs were stored in 1 mL (cloacal) or 0.5 mL (tracheal) viral transport medium. hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed according to WHO guidelines. statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance with strain and day post-infection as main effects. logistic regression analysis was used to assess differences in AIV positivity across various bird species. two H11N2 viruses, A/Helmeted guineafowl/Colombia/1/2015 and A/Helmeted guineafowl/Colombia/2/2015 (HGF/Colombia), were isolated from different birds in march 2015. no significant differences were observed with ducks, geese or quail. 87 9 10.3 3.91\u201316.69 Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) 89 3 3.4 0\u20137.17 Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) 130 6 4.6 1\u20138.2 Domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) 280 3 1.1 0\u20132.32 Order Columbiformes 15 0 0 \u2013 Rock dove (Columba livia) 15 0 0 \u2013 Unknown (environmental the HA sequences from the two isolates, as well as partial HA sequences (400 bp) from four additional positive samples, were most similar to viruses isolated from shorebirds in Chile (A/black necked stilt/Chile/1/2013 and A/black necked stilt/Chile/2/2013, 98% nucleotide similarity) binding pocket residues (H3 numbering), at position 190, 225, 226 and 228, exhibited all avian-like amino acids that typically bind to 2,3-sialic acid receptors. the viruses were tested for their ability to bind to 2,3 and 2,6 sialyglycopolymers. the neuraminidase genes of the Colombian viruses clustered in the North American clade of N2 viruses containing long NA stalks. the nearest relative was A/northern shoveler/California/3769/2012 H6N2 (99% nucleotide similarity). cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected for 12 days pi to monitor transmission. cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected for 12 days pi to monitor viral shed. 2 dpi 4 dpi 6 dpi 8 dpi 10 dpi Direct Con Direct Con Direct Con Direct Con Direct Con Duck/Mem 100%a (2.5\u20134) NDb 100% (2.5\u20133) ND ND ND ND ND 100%c (4\u20135) ND 100% (4.5\u20136) 20% (2.5) 40% (3.5\u20134) ND 20% (2.5) ND ND RT/DE 40% (3.5\u20134) ND 20% (2.5) ND c Percent of animals shedding cloacal route were below the limit of detection (1 log10 EID50/100 L) data are the average of five animals/group. female Balb/c mice were infected with 104 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of challenge and control viruses. weight loss was monitored for 14 dpi and (B) 3 and 6 dpi, lungs were collected from three mice per virus strain and homogenates were tittered as TCID50. domestic ducks, chicken and turkeys were the most frequently sampled species. /1/2015 and A/Helmeted guineafowl/Colombia/2/2015 (HGF/Colombia) were isolated from different birds in March 2015. partial sequences of four additional H11N2 viruses were obtained from geese and guineafowls sampled in April 2015. no further success either isolating viruses or getting further sequence information.
