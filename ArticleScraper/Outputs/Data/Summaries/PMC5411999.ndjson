{"summary": "dengue fever is an acute viral infection caused by all four serotypes (1, 2, 3, or 4) of the dengue virus. highest incidence of dengue fever is in Southeast Asia, India, and the Neotropics. dengue viral infections account for around 100 million cases of dengue fever and more than 500,000 cases of DHF/DSS each year. residents with poor access to health services showed a significantly higher seroprevelence compared to wealthy inhabitants. a serological survey carried out in three neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro showed more than half the population was seropositive. there are no treatment options for dengue fever; there is no known cure or vaccine. dengue Virus Helicase DENV NS3 helicase is an essential enzyme for viral replication. the enzyme shows both ATP-hydrolysis activity as well as RNA duplex unwinding activity. there are two potential targets for DENV NS3 helicase, the RNA binding site and the ATP binding site. a small hydrophobic channel has been identified in the DENV E protein. this site has been identified as a target for small-molecule inhibitors. a molecular docking approach was used to examine a selection of phytochemicals with the protein targets of dengue virus. Virus Methyltransferase DENV MTase is located on the N-terminus of NS5. it catalyzes the N-7 and 2-O methylations of the viral RNA cap. the MTase uses S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methylating cofactor. a molecular docking approach was used to examine a selection of phytochemicals from our virtual library. ligands were docked with crystal structures of rat trypsin, bovine trypsin and rat trypsin. all solvent molecules and the co-crystallized ligands were removed from the structures. a sphere (15 radius) large enough to accommodate the cavity centered on the binding sites of each protein structure. each protein was used as a rigid model structure; no other charges were necessary. phenolic compounds, 100 coumarins, 28 xanthones, 67 quinones and 160 miscellaneous phytochemicals were docked to the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease. ligands with MW > 500 g/mol, hydrogen-bond-donating atoms > 5, hydrogen-bond-accepting atoms > 10, or ClogP > 5, were not considered. the binding site of deNV NS2B-NS3 protease involves the catalytic triad of Ser196, His112, and Asp136. additional amino acids at the binding site are Glu46, Ile97, and Glu47. terpenoids (average Edock = -89.7 kJ/mol) and triterpenoids (average Edock = -91.8 kJ/mol) chalcone ligands balsacone A, balsacone B, and balsacone C place these compounds into both the binding site of Lys-Arg as well as the catalytic site occupied by the co-crystallized inhibitor M9P. ul Qamar and co-workers had carried out a docking analysis with DENV NS2B-NS3 protease using a library of 940 phytochemicals. they found Garcinia phytochemicals to be their best hits, including gossypol, mangostenone C, garcidepsidone A, and dimethyl-calabaxanthone. this compound violates Lipinski\u2019s rule of five (ClogP = 5.74) kanzonol Y docked well with DENV methyltransferase. the balsacones A-C are antibacterial dihydrochalcones from Populus balsamifera. the prenylated flavonoids glabranine and 7-O-methylglabranine showed in-vitro antiviral activity against dengue virus serotype 2 [53] glabranine and 7-O-methylglabranine were not among the strongest docking, but did show docking selectivity with DENV protease. the strongest docking (most exothermic) ligands that do not violate Lipinski\u2019s rule of five are listed in Table 2 along with their docking energies to the RNA binding site and the ATP binding site. the docking energies were selected based on their docking energies compared to the co-crystallized ligands in the ATP binding site. the strongest docking ligands were curcumin II (Edock = -164.0 kJ/mol), caffeoyl-p-coumaroyltartaric acid (Edock = -156.2 kJ/mol), balsacone C (Edock = -153.6 kJ/mol), curcumin I (Edock = -153.4 kJ/mol), and angusticornin B (Edock = -152.5 k the strongest docking ligands were relatively large molecules (MW around 680-802 g/mol) the strongest docking ligands were relatively large molecules (MW around 680-802 g/mol), and therefore violate Lipinski\u2019s rule of five. eight phytochemical ligands from our docking analysis showed excellent docking energies to DENV RdRp. these ligands meet the rule-of-five criteria for drug likeness. the other four ligands preferentially docked preferentially at the GTP site. curcumin, one of the major components of C. longa, has shown inhibition of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases [59] and in-vitro infectivity of dengue virus type 2 [60]. curcumin, one of the major components of C. longa, has shown inhibition of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases [59] and in-vitro infectivity of dengue virus type 2 [60]. chartaceones C-F showed the highest potency and these ligands also showed very exothermic docking energies. the lower molecular weight chartaceones A-B docked with DENV RdRp with docking energies comparable to GTP. lowest-energy docked pose of paratocarpin L with monomer B of the dimeric envelope protein (PDB 1OKE) flavonoids from silybum marianum have shown exceptional docking to the hydrophobic pore of DENV Ep (2,3-dehydroxilybin, cisilandrin, isosilybins A-D, silandrins A-B, and silybin. phytochemical ligands were docked to the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease and with three different mammalian trypsin-like proteases (bovine trypsin, rat trypsin, and porcine elastase) the binding site of deNV NS2B-NS3 protease involves the catalytic triad of Ser196, His112, and Asp136. the strongest docking compounds were the chalcones (average docking energy = -121.2 kJ/mol) the worst docking compounds were the terpenoids, monoterpenoids (average Edock = -63.8 kJ/mol), sesquiterpenoids (average Edock = -89.6 kJ/mol), diterpenoids (average Edock = -89.7 kJ/mol), and triterpenoids (average Edock = -91.8 k docking studies with de Sousa and co-workers had focused on flavonoids that had shown protease inhibition activity. the most active compound in that study was agathisflavone, but in our docking analysis, this compound docks to DENV protease with higher energy (Edock = -126.1 kJ/mol) than it does with rat trypsin (Edock = -138. 6 kJ/mol) a docking study with compounds from deNV NS2B-NS3 protease revealed the bisindole alkaloid bismurrayafoline E to be a promising binding ligand [44] this compound violates Lipinski\u2019s rule of 5 (MW = 724.98 g/mol) in another docking study, panduratin A and 4-hydroxypanduratin A were found to dock well with the active site of DENV NS2B-NS3 prenylated phenolics from G. glabra have inhibited HIV giant cell formation. kanzonol Y docked well with DENV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and DENV envelope protein. the balsacones A-C are antibacterial dihydrochalcones from Populus balsamifera [52] three sesquiterpenoid -methylene lactones dock in close proximity to the \u2013OH group of Ser196. these ligands can presumably undergo conjugate addition with the \u2013OH group and form a covalent intermediate thereby inhibiting the protease. the strongest docking ligands that do not violate Lipinski\u2019s rule of five are listed in Table 2 along with their docking energies to the RNA binding site and the ATP binding site. the strongest docking ligands were curcumin II (Edock = -164.0 kJ/mol), caffeoyl-p-coumaroyltartaric acid (Edock = -166.2 kJ/mol), balsacone C (Edock = -153.6 kJ/mol), curcumin I (Edock = -153.4 kJ/mol), and angusticornin B (Edock = -152.5 k lowest-energy docking poses of angusticornin B (green), balsacone C (yellow), caffeoyl-p-coumaroyltartaric acid (aqua) and curcumin II (magenta) with DENV helicase (PDB 2JLX) [26]. strongest docking phytochemical ligands all docked at the SAM site. a SAM and SFG are co-crystallized ligands. Table 3 predicted to show inhibition of DENV MTase by competition with SAM and selectively inhibit viral MTase over human MTase. oborreverine, drummondin D, flinderole B, and pungiolide A docked preferentially in a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by Trp302, Phe354, Val358, Val577, Val579, and Gly599. curcumin, one of the major components of C. longa, has shown activity against hepatitis B virus replication [57] and dengue-2 virus protease [58] ligands showed docking energies slightly stronger than those of co-crystallized ligands for DENV RdRp (e.g., curcumin I, Edock = -119.3 kJ/mol) and curcumin I also showed excellent docking properties to the DENV envelope protein hydrophobic pore. alkylated flavanones, the chartaceones C-F, have shown potent activity against dengue virus NS5 RdR flavonoid canniflavin A docks in the cavity pore, which is hydrophobic. flavonoids from silybum marianum have shown exceptional docking. flavonoids from silybum marianum have shown exceptional docking to the hydrophobic pore. flavanones from Paulownia tomentosa fruits have shown antibacterial [65, 66], cytotoxic [67] and anti-inflammatory [68] activities. diplacone, bonannione A, 3-O-methyldiplacone and 4-O-methyldiplacol docked well with the hydrophobic channel of DENV helicase. molecular docking analysis of 2194 plant-derived secondary metabolites with dengue virus protein targets. ing ligands to dengue protein targets [42, 43, 46, 61]. authors declare there are no conflicts of interest."}
