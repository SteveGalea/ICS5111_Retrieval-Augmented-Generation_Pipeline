{"summary": "OTA is a nephrotoxic mycotoxin produced by several species in the Aspergillus and Penicillium genera. these species occur worldwide, as a contaminant of agricultural commodities, especially cereals. OTA causes mycotoxicosis in animals, particularly in swine [5, 6] and plays a special role in the genesis of mycotoxic porcine nephropathy (MPN) a nephropathy in pigs with characteristic macroscopic changes of the type \u201cmottled or pale enlarged kidneys\u201d has been frequently identified at meat inspection in Serbia. the purpose of this work was to monitor the presence of OTA in edible tissues of normally slaughtered pigs. ta 30 4 (13.3) 0.842.95 3.51 0.56\u201314.5 Bogati 30 9 (30) 0.561.17 2.09 0.22\u20135.46 Total 90 24 (26.6) 0.631.87 2.96 0.22\u201314.5 N-total number of analyzed samples, n-number of positive samples, X -arithmetic mean (conc. below LOD are considered zero), C.V.-coeff. of variation. the highest OTA level 220.8 ng/mL (mean-8.58 ng/mL), with the highest coefficient of variation (4.69) was found in the samples originate from the Bogati region. the concentrations in a further eight samples (8.8%) fell between 1\u20135 ng/mL while the rest of the samples (6.6%) had concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL. OTA was detected in 24 (26.6%) out of 90 liver samples with a much lower mean value (0.63 ng/g) than in kidney (1.26 ng/g) the majority of samples (15.5%) contained OTA between 1\u20135 ng/g, while ochratoxin A in only two (2.2%) samples of liver was greater than 5 ng/g. the highest OTA level 14.5 ng/g (mean OTA 0.84 ng/g), with the highest coefficient the highest mean level of OTA found in Bogati region could signal a possible relationship between this region and the Balkan Endemic Nephropathy. a contamination level for the entire carcass at 25 ng/g pig kidney should secure that the level in meat do not exceed 10 ng/g. the effects of OTA appeared to be longer-lasting than those of other mycotoxins, and possessed cumulative feature. comparison the data obtained in this trial with other recently published data for the occurrence of OTA in pig edible tissues shows that the found levels are comparable with levels in other countries. the majority of glomeruli exhibited mild or moderate exudates in Bowman\u2019s capsular spaces as well as hypercellularity of vascular loops. in addition vascular changes expresed as a hyperaemia of blood vessels, moderate to marked hemorrhages of some renal cortical regions occurred occasionally. ochratoxin A detected up to 6.5 ng/g in six kidneys of pigs. focal interstitial fibrosis and necrosis of proximal tubules\u2019 cells were only seen in one kidney of pigs were ochratoxin A detected up to 52.5 ng/g. the kidney is the main target of OTA, although possible targets are the liver, the immune system, and brain cells. the average concentrations of OTA in some feeds for pigs in Serbia were substantially lower than the 1\u20132 ppm required to reproduce the classical MPN reported in Denmark. many studies on the role of environmental and host factors have been carried out to elucidate the aetiology of both diseases (BEN and MPN) synergism between OTA and other nephrotoxic mycotoxins may be responsible for the MPN in Serbia. the production of multiple toxins by one or several fungi presents a problem that has not been sufficiently investigated. the timely diagnosis of disease during the meat inspection at slaughterhouses is very important.

OTA was detected in 24 (26.6%) out of 90 liver samples with a much lower mean value (0.63 ng/g) than in kidney (1.26 ng/g) the majority of samples (15.5%) contained OTA between 1\u20135 ng/g, while ochratoxin A in only two (2.2%) samples of liver was greater than 5 ng/g (Table 2). regional variations and seasonal differences were observed. the highest mean level of OTA found in Bogati region could signal a possible relationship between this region and the Balkan Endemic Nephropathy. the strongest correlation was found between the OTA level in kidney and liver (r = 0.319 and r = 0.341, respectively) the effects of OTA appeared to be longer-lasting than those of other mycotoxins, and possessed cumulative feature. the data obtained in this trial show it should be raises some concern for the livestock industry. major renal histopathological changes were mainly in the epithelium of proximal tubules. Dystrophy (moderate to marked degenerative changes, Figure 3A), swelling, vacuolization and fatty changes were the main changes in the tubular epithelial cells. degenerative changes of moderate to marked cloudy swelling were seen in 32.2% samples at concentrations levels up to 52.5 ng/g. vascular changes as well as fatty changes were observed in six kidneys of pigs were ochratoxin A detected up to 6.5 ng/g. focal interstitial fibrosis and necrosis of proximal tubules\u2019 cells were only seen in one kidneys of pigs were ochratoxin A detected up to 5 pigs may well contain ochratoxin A in high amounts without any macroscopic chances of the kidneys, as it may take several weeks on ochratoxin A contaminated feeding before porcine nephropathy develops. many studies have been carried out to elucidate the aetiology of both diseases. OTA in kidney (33.3% kidney samples were positive, at levels ranging up to 52.5 ng/g) found in our trial might thus explain the result of OTA-toxicokinetics. synergism between OTA and other nephrotoxic mycotoxins may be responsible for the MPN in Serbia. the production of multiple toxins by one or several fungi presents a problem that has not been sufficiently investigated. pigs were slaughtered during the study period. 43 (47.7%) had \u201cmottled or pale kidneys\u201d. 27 (30%) were enlarged and 11 (12.2%) was smaller than normal. renal tissues and incidence of OTA in kidney from slaughtered pigs (n=90) renal tissues and incidence of OTA in kidney from slaughtered pigs (n=90) degenerative changes of moderate to marked cloudy swelling were seen. OTA-toxicokinetic features result in an accumulation of OTA in renal tissue. the most important toxicological target of OTA in the pig is the kidney. no association was found between OTA contamination and kidney weight. pigs may well contain ochratoxin A in high amounts without any macroscopic chances of the kidneys, as it may take several weeks on ochratoxin A contaminated feeding before porcine nephropathy develops. many studies on the role of environmental and host factors have been carried out to elucidate the aetiology of both diseases (BEN and MPN) a residue limit of 10 ng/g in pork would not be considered satisfactory from a consumer safety point of view. the prevalence of mycotoxin-induced nephropathy is still unknown. samples were collected from healthy slaughtered pigs (n = 90) originating from three different regions of Serbia. about 50 mL blood/pig was sampled when slaughtered pigs were bled by jugular puncture. about 100 g of liver and whole kidney were sampled from each pig. the lower dichloromethane phase was carefully withdrawn by a Pasteur pipette. the acidic phase and the compact precipitate layer formed between the two phases were re-extracted with dichloromethane (0.5 mL) for 30 s on a vortex mixer and then centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 g. the pooled dichloromethane extract was evaporated to dryness at 40 \u00b0C under a gentle nitrogen flow. an aliquot of 20 L for serum samples and 50 L for kidneys and liver samples were injected onto a Waters Alliance HPLC system. the column was eluted with 4% acetic acid and acetonitrile at 25 \u00b0C and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. a volume of 10 L was injected for the standards and 20 L for the samples. the transitions reactions monitored by LC-MS/MS were m/z 404239 and m/z 404358 daughter ion of the ochratoxin A. arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, minimum, maximum were determined by one-way ANOVA. samples were collected from each studied farm and liver and kidneys. about 50 mL blood/pig was sampled when slaughtered pigs were bled by jugular puncture. blood samples remained at room temperature for 24 h to allow clotting to occur. the pooled dichloromethane extract was evaporated to dryness at 40 \u00b0C under a gentle nitrogen flow. the remaining residue was dissolved in methanol (80 mL) and transferred to a 300 L HPLC vial. the limit of detection was estimated at 0.1 ng OTA/mL. measurements were performed by fluorescence detection at wavelengths of 334 nm (excitation) and 460 nm (emission) gains 10. 40 L was re-injected in the case of the samples with an amount of OTA near the detection limit. the acidic phase and the compact precipitate layer formed between the two phases were re-extracted with dichloromethane (0.5 mL) the pooled dichloromethane extract was evaporated to dryness at 40 \u00b0C under a gentle nitrogen flow. the remaining residue was dissolved in methanol (80 mL) and transferred to a 300 L HPLC vial. an aliquot of 20 L for serum samples and 50 L for kidneys and liver samples were injected onto a waters Alliance HPLC system. the column was eluted with 4% acetic acid and acetonitrile at 25 \u00b0C. for more accuracy, 40 L was re-injected in the case of the samples with an amount of OTA near the detection limit. data were acquired in multiple reaction monitoring modes. collision energy was 18 eV."}
