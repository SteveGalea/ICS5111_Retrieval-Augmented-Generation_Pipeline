{"summary": "three trans-membrane non-structural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, are understood to be membrane anchors of the coronavirus replication complex. it is revealed to contain four trans-membrane regions and its N- and C-termini are exposed to the cytosol. MHV strain A59 is an extensively studied group II coronavirus [4], [5] that causes enteritis, hepatitis, and central nervous system demyelination in susceptible mice. translation of the MHV-A59 genome yields 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) which are encoded by two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF) termed ORF1a and ORF1b. RNA synthesis, replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription also take place in the cytoplasmic DMVs [21]. it was further demonstrated that the autophagic pathway is required for formation of virus induced double membrane vesicles. formation of DMVs significantly enhances the efficiency of MHV replication. nsp4 and six of the seven hydrophobic domains of nsp6 are membrane spanning [26]. these trans-membrane domains comprise of the majority part of the polyprotein pp1a. the ORF1b-encoded proteins are directly involved in coronavirus RNA replication and transcription [15], [31] the TM regions of nsp4 are involved in association of the coronavirus replication complex with cellular membranes. however, there has been no structural characterization of the coronavirus nsp4 to date. this cytoplasmic fragment of nsp4 may play an important role in coronavirus replication complex assembly. the crystal of WT nsp4C belongs to space group C2. the structure covers amino acid residues from T408\u2013T492. the C425S mutant belongs to space group P41212 and covers residues from T408-L495. monomers of the WT and C425S mutant are colored from blue at the N-terminus to red at the C-terminus, secondary elements are labeled. carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms are colored in yellow, blue, red, and green, respectively. a DALI search for structural similarity reveals no close homolog to nsp4C in the Protein Data Bank. monomer structure of nsp4C possess a new fold. positions of selected residues and the N- and C-termini are labeled. -strands are shown in arrows, and -helices in cylinders. the surface of both molecule A and B shows a hydrophobic cavity formed by residues Ile419, Met453, Thr455, Tyr458, Ala461, Ala462, Gln465, Leu466, Ala469, Phe473, Val481, Leu482, Tyr483, Pro485, Thr487 and ala488. the region from ala488 to Thr492 bends over the hydrophobic patch located in the loop connecting the heli the mutant monomer is observed with detectable electron density from Ser493 to Leu495, while the equivalent region of the wild-type monomer exists as a long loop. the conformation of the four -helices and -strands 1\u20132 are identical to WT, while a short -strand (3, S449\u2013M452) between 3 and 4 and a long -strand 4 (4, T487-S493) at the C-terminal are formed for stability of the dim the C-terminal of nsp4 is exposed to the cytosol, suggesting that the nsp4C should bind to the ER membrane via its N-terminal. instead, they are projected in different orientations, with one molecule rotated by about 150\u00b0 around the y-axis relative to the other molecule. the N-terminal amino acids Cys425, Lys421, Glu422, Lys426, and Asn429 are located in the contact surface mutant C425S dimer could be obtained by crystallographic symmetry of the WT nsp4C structure. a disulfide bond at Cys425 causes the C-termini of the two monomers to extend in different orientations. in the mutant, the disulfide bond is dissociated and the dimer adopts a more stable conformation by crystal packing. the dimerization of nsp4C is also detected by gel filtration. the nsp4C sample in the presence of the reducing agent DTT exhibits a different elution profile. the elution profile of the nsp4C point mutant was identical to the profile of nsp4C with DTT, with only a single absorption peak appearing at 14.64 ml. WT measurements are represented in solid blue line, C425S in medium dashed dark yellow line, and WT containing 1mM DTT in dotted red line. arrows indicate -strands, and helical curves denote (or 310)-helical curves. the nsp4C crystal was obtained under non-reducing solutions. the dimer can easily dissociate into monomers. no enzymatic activity or biochemical studies have been reported for nsp4. long loop connects helix 3 and another long -helix (4, D454\u2013N474). -helices 3 and 4 point towards each other. strand 2 is extending further via a long loop to the C-terminus of the molecule. the absence of this interaction in molecule A results in its flexibility and undetectable electron density from S489-Q496. Fig. 3A and 3B represents molecule A and molecule B of the WT. Fig. 3D represents the superposition of molecule A (gold) and B (magenta) from WT and the monomer of the C425S mutant (green), Cys425 is shown in stick representation, with the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms colored yellow, blue, red, and green. symmetry-related molecules are colored in green, and the molecule forming the equivalent of the C425S mutant dimer is colored in blue. the major differences arise from three regions in the mutant monomer. the first is the loop from Ser449 to Met452 which forms an additional -strand 3 in the mutant dimer. the second region is located between Asn476\u2013Asn479, which is formed by interaction with symmetry related molecules. nsp4C monomer contains four -helices (1\u20134) and two short -strands (1\u20132) the N-terminal starts from a short -helix (1, T408\u2013T415), followed by a short -strand (1, T416\u2013T420) connecting 1 and another short -helix (2, E422\u2013S430) by a short loop. the strands 2 and 1 are anti-parallel, while 2 is extending further one monomer is colored in magenta, the other in gold in the dimer. carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms are colored in yellow, blue, red, and green respectively. nsp4C has a new fold. positions of selected residues and the N- and C-termini are labeled. -strands are shown in arrows, and -helices in cylinders. Fig. 2A was drawn with the programs with PyMol [47] and 2B with TopDraw. the region from Ala488 to Thr492 bends over the hydrophobic patch located in the loop connecting the helices 3 and 4 to form a hole on the surface. the positively charged amino acids Tyr443 and Arg447 in 2, and Lys467 in 3, form a positive charged region around this hydrophobic cavity. the conformation of the four -helices and -strands 1\u20132 are identical to WT. a short -strand (3, S449\u2013M452) between 3 and 4 and a long -strand 4 (4, T487-S493) at the C-terminal are formed for stability of the dimer during the crystal packing. the nsp4C dimer should bind to the ER membrane via its N-terminal. they are projected in different orientations, with one molecule rotated by about 150\u00b0 around the y-axis relative to the other molecule. the hydrophobic cavity of the WT nsp4C is exposed on the dimer surface. in the WT nsp4C structure, a disulfide bond at Cys425 causes the C-termini of the two monomers to extend in different orientations. the flexible C-termini of the two monomers are stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions between the amino acids in the Ala488-Thr492 (4) and Ser450-Met452 (3) loops. the C-terminal of nsp4 is exposed to the cytosol, suggesting that the nsp4C should bind to the ER membrane via its N-terminal. the n-terminal amino acids Cys425, Lys421, Glu422, Lys426, and Asn429 are located in the contact surface between the two monomers. the mutant C425S dimer could be obtained by crystallographic symmetry of the WT nsp4C structure. a disulfide bond at Cys425 causes the C-termini of the two monomers to extend in different orientations. in the mutant, the disulfide bond is dissociated and the dimer adopts a more stable conformation by crystal packing. the dimerization of nsp4C is also detected by gel filtration. the nsp4C monomer appears at 13.1 ml and the second at 14.67 ml. the elution profile of the C425S point mutant was identical to the profile of nsp4C with DTT. a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 150 mM NaCl. WT measurements are represented in solid blue line, C425S in medium dashed dark yellow line, and WT containing 1mM DTT in dotted red line. nsp4C dimer can easily dissociate into monomers under reducing environment. mutation of Cys425 to serine disrupts disulfide bond and only yields monomers. no enzymatic activity or biochemical studies have been reported for nsp4. p4C may exist as monomer in the reducing environment of the cytosol. the dimer is formed in a non-reducing and highly condensed protein solution. the dimer is a specific case to MHV nsp4C. the cytosol exposed nsp4C crystal structure suggests that the most likely candidate region for protein interaction may be the hydrophobic cavity formed by Ile419, Met453, Thr455, Tyr458, Ala461, Ala462, Gln465, Leu466, Ala469, Phe473, Val481, Leu482 Tyr483, Pro485, Pro486, Thr487 and Ala488. the surface of the nsp4C crystal structure suggests multiple sequence alignment of MHV-A59 nsp4 with representatives from all three groups of the genus Coronavirus reveals that the membrane topology of nsp4 from all group members is similar. nsp4C exists as a monomer in the cytosol Topology studies of MHV nsp4 indicate that the N-terminal of nsp4C is connected to the ER membrane by about 8 amino acids, -TEVRSDG- nsp4C dimer is not a conserved amino acids among coronavirus nsp4 proteins. the dimer is a specific case to MHV nsp4C. nsp3 and nsp4 are reported to be dispensable for viral replication. the cytosol exposed nsp4C crystal structure suggests that the most likely candidate region for protein interaction may be the hydrophobic cavity formed by Ile419, Met453, Thr455, Tyr458, Ala461, Ala462, Gln465, Leu466, Ala469, Phe473, Val481, Leu482 Tyr483, Pro485, Pro486, Thr487 and Ala488. the surface of the nsp4C crystal structure suggests multiple sequence alignment of MHV-A59 nsp4 with representatives from all three groups of the genus Coronavirus reveals that the membrane topology of nsp4 from all group members is similar. nsp4C may play a similar and conserved role in coronavirus replication. the cells were disrupted by sonication in 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.5, 200 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. the cells were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. the soluble fraction was then applied on a GST-affinity chromatography column for purification. the crystal form belongs to the primitive tetragonal space group P41212. the crystals were cryoprotected in a solution containing the reservoir solution with 15% glycerol. the structure of nsp4C was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method from a Se-Met derivative crystal. three out of the four expected selenium atoms in one molecule were located and initial phases were calculated by the program SOLVE. the model of nsp4C was then manually built and refined using the programs O and CNS. 2.4 50 (2.49)c\u2013 2.4 No. of all reflections 138870 52828 68486 No. of unique reflections 14589 7733 5920 Completeness (%) 98.6 (89.4) 94.2 (81.9) 94.2 (70.9) Average I/(I) 15.0 (6.1) 10.8 (5.8) 11.7 (2.3) Rmerge a (%) 5.6 (20.2) 7.8 (19.9) 7.8 (31.0) Refinement statistics No. of reflections a gene fragment encoding the MHV-A59 nsp4 carboxy terminal domain (nsp4C) spanning T3252 to Q3328 of pp1a was cloned from the virus genomic cDNA library. the plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. the recombinant glutathione transferase (GST) fusion protein, GSTnsp4C, crystallization MHV-A59 nsp4C was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with a 2 L drop volume at 18\u00b0C. 1.0 L nsp4C at 3 mg ml1 was added to the same volume of reservoir solution (10% PEG MME550, 0.1 M glycine, pH 9.0, and 0.01 M zinc sulfate), producing plate like crystals belonging to the space group of C2. the se-Met derivative data of nsp4C were collected at BSRF (Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility) at 2.4 resolution using an ADSC Q270 detector. the crystal form belongs to the primitive tetragonal space group P41212 (a = b = 54.79, c = 97.55, = = = = = 90\u00b0) nsp4C Se-nsp4C Mutant C425S Data collection statistics Cell parameters a = 86.86 a = 85.26 a = 54.79 b = 52.55 b = 51.56 c = 53.87 c = 97.55 = = 90\u00b0, = 116\u00b0 = 90\u00b0, = 116\u00b0 = = = 90\u00b0, = 116\u00b0 = = = 90\u00b0, Space group C2 C2 P41212 Wavelength used a Rmerge = hl | IihIh> |/hI Ih>, where Ih> is the mean of the observations Iih of reflection h. b Rwork = ( ||Fp(obs)||Fp(calc)||) = R factor for a selected subset (5%) of the reflections that was not included in prior refinement calculations."}
