{"summary": "a promising addition to vaccination is the manipulation of innate immunity. oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine\u2013phosphate\u2013guanosine (CpG) motifs are effectively recognized as PAMPs by the vertebrate innate immune system. alarmed TLR9 is the initial instigator of gene expression profiles that strongly support antiviral mechanisms. upregulation of costimulatory molecules major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, B7.1 and B7.2 on the surface of stimulated cells provides them with a stronger antigen presenting potential [8,9] and production of cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL)-12, IFN, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TN class B CpG ODN (CpG-B) encode multiple CpG motifs on a phosphorothioate backbone, promote monocyte maturation and B cell activation. both CpG-A and CpG-B have indicated immunostimulatory properties in immune cells of mice, primates and many domestic species in vitro. in vivo studies in outbred animals have mostly been carried out with CpG-B [24,32,33] in an outbred species, partial antiviral protection has only been described in two studies so far. in vitro, the prototype of CpG-A, ODN 2216 [12], strengthened the antiviral qualities of feline immune cells and stimulated their production of soluble molecules. in vivo, ODN 2216 induced a systemic antiviral state. the Veterinary Office of the Swiss Canton of Zurich officially revised the protocol and approved the study. the cats were housed in groups in an animal-friendly barrier facility under optimal ethological conditions. for blood collections and injections, the cats were sedated with ketamin and midazolam. ine IFN was obtained from PBL Biomedical, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA. all molecules were solubilized in endotoxin-free PBS. both ODNs and rfeIFN were diluted in RPMI 1640. the dots indicate the stimulation index calculated from triplicate cultures for each cat. expression levels of B7.1 and MHCII surface molecules were assessed 24 h post stimulation with the indicated treatments by flow cytometry. fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse IgG1 as isotype control (BD Bioscience, Allschwil, Swizerland) the fractions were subsequently stained with R-Phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1. a total of 50 000 events were acquired in the non-lymphocyte gate. mRNA extractions were performed with the mRNA Isolation Kit I and MagNA Pure LC Instrument (Roche Diagnostics), and first strand cDNA was synthesized with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). mRNA expression factors of selected genes correspond to ratios of mRNA levels measured in ODN 2216 or ODN 2243 stimulated versus PBS stimulated cells. supernatants were stimulated immediately after isolation with 4 g/mL ODN 2216, 4 g/mL ODN 2243 or an equivalent volume of endotoxin-free PBS. supernatants were harvested by centrifugation of the cultures twice at 2000 g for 10 min, aliquoted and stored at 20\u00b0C. new supernatant batches were produced for use in FeLV inhibition experiments. the top and bottom membrane fractions were incubated with murine anti-actin monoclonal antibody as a loading control (Sigma Aldrich GMbH, Buchs, Switzerland) both fractions were incubated with a peroxidase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Newmarket, Suffolk, UK) trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco\u00ae, Invitrogen) allowed to settle in viral suspension. inhibition assays were carried out after 24 h (72 h for FCoV and FPV) the time course experiments were conducted with supernatants derived from PBMCs of three cats. the measurements on day 8 post inoculation were carried out with material derived from two additional cats. in order to facilitate interpretation of figures illustrating measurements of viral RNA loads, 45 cycles-cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated. the plasma collected from each cat at each time point was incubated for 24 h with fcwf-4 cells prior to their inoculation with FCV. the assays were carried out as described above and viral inhibition factors were calculated as follows. we refrained from using a parametric approach in the statistical tests. correlations were assessed using the Spearman test. p-values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. the cats were housed in groups in an animal-friendly barrier facility under optimal ethological conditions. for blood collections and injections, the cats were sedated with a combination of ketamin and midazolam. the cats were sedated with a combination of ketamin and midazolam. all molecules were solubilized in endotoxin-free PBS. both ODNs and rfeIFN were diluted in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax I supplemented. the dots indicate the stimulation index calculated from triplicate cultures for each cat. expression levels of B7.1 and MHCII surface molecules were assessed 24 h post stimulation. results for eight cats belonging to groups 2 and 3 are shown. d mouse IgG1 as isotype control (BD Bioscience, Allschwil, Swizerland) fractions were stained with R-Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1. a total of 50 000 events were acquired in the non-lymphocyte gate. a total of 50 000 events were acquired in the non-lymphocyte gate. real-time quantitative PCR reactions consisted of 5 L cDNA in a total volume of 25 L per reaction using the TaqMan\u00ae Fast Universal PCR Master Mix. thermocycling conditions included an initial denaturation of 20 s at 95\u00b0C followed by 45 cycles of amplification by melting at 95\u00b0C for 3 s and annealing at 60\u00b0C for 45 s. supernatants derived from PBMCs stimulated with ODN 2216, ODN 2243 and endotoxin-free PBS are referred to as Sup2216, Sup 2243 and Sup Neg in the text and in the figures. 106 cells of either cell line were resuspended in 30 L sample buffer and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. x MAb M143 and murine anti-actin monoclonal antibody as loading control. both fractions were incubated with peroxidase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG. bands were digitalized using the Chemigenius 2 BioImaging System. 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco\u00ae, Invitrogen) allowed to settle in viral suspension. inhibition assays were carried out after 24 h (72 h for FCoV and FPV) cells were fixed with 5% formalin and stained with a crystal violet solution. proviral loads in cells were measured by real-time RT-PCR and real-time PCR respectively, with assays previously described. in order to facilitate interpretation of the figures illustrating measurements of viral RNA loads, 45 cycles-cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated. plasma collected from each cat at each time point was incubated for 24 h with fcwf-4 cells prior to their inoculation with FCV. the assays were carried out as described above and viral inhibition factors were calculated as follows. 0.05 were considered statistically significant. mRNA expression factors were measured in PBMCs isolated from 14 cats. mRNA levels of TLR9 were measured by real-time qPCR in unstimulated PBMCs. the expression of both co-stimulatory molecules was measured in gated PBMCs of the same eight cats as above. the expression of both co-stimulatory molecules was evaluated in gates defined to contain a PBMC population, a lymphocyte population and a non-lymphocyte population of cells. the observed effects varied considerably between the cells of individual cats. the expression of MHCII was not significantly altered in cells gated as non-lymphocytes at this time point after stimulation. the cells of the three cats (c08, c09 and c12) showed the strongest increase in expression of both cell surface molecules in all cellular subpopulations tested. an influence on IFN transcription could be measured as early as 3 h after treatment of PBMCs. increased levels of IL-6 mRNA were observed only as of 6 h post stimulation. the highest induction of both genes was measured 24 h after addition of ODN 2216 to the cultures. mRNA expression of ten genes relevant to early immune responses was measured in stimulated PBMCs of fourteen cats divided in four different age groups. only slight individual variability in gene induction was observed after 24 h stimulation of immune cells from adult cats ranging between 1.5 and 14 years of age. expression of type I IFN mRNA, including IFN, was substantially increased in the immune cells subjected to ODN 2216 stimulation from every adult cat. PBMCs of cat c08 (group 2, Figure 1B) were most responsive to stimulation with ODN 2216. mRNA expression of type I IFN genes was enhanced at much lower levels than observed in adult cats. mRNA levels of this gene were measured in immune cells of each cat. mRNA levels of Mx were measured in feline PBMCs after stimulation with ODN 2216. peak levels of Mx mRNA were measured 24 h after stimulation of the cells. mx gene transcription was significantly enhanced in cells treated with Sup 2216 compared to Sup 2243 and Sup Neg respectively. treatment with Sup 2243 systematically increased Mx transcription in target cells. peak induction of Mx transcription was observed in both cell lines already within 6 hours of incubation with Sup 2216. protein levels achieved maximum levels within 24 h post stimulation and remained stable thereafter for at least another 24\u201348 h. rfeIFN was detected in fcwf-4 cells at indicated time points after stimulation with Sup 2216 derived from PBMCs of the same cat. fcwf-4 cells were incubated with the supernatants for 24 h before inoculation. this time span indicated highest induction of antiviral mechanisms. stomatitis virus (VSV) is widely recognized for its potential to induce CPE in cell lines of multiple species and for its particularly high sensitivity to the effects of type I IFN. when the Sup 2216 derived from the PBMCs of eight adult cats that had broadly responded to in vitro ODN 2216 stimulation, significant inhibition of VSV replication was observed. the replication of this virus was also to some degree repressed by Sup 2243 (p = 0.0078), an observation supernatants derived from PBMCs of the other 2 kittens indicated no inhibition potential on these viruses. fcwf-4 cells were incubated for 24 h with the indicated supernatants derived from PBMCs of eight adult cats (groups 2 and 3) or medium only as control before inoculation with the indicated viruses. each dot represents mean optical density (OD) values from spectrophotometric readings of viral inhibition assays conducted on duplicate wells matitis virus, FCV = feline calicivirus, FPV = feline parvovirus, FCoV = feline coronavirus, FHV = feline herpes virus. fcwf-4 cells were treated with supernatants derived from PBMCs of 8 adult cats. this cell line has previously indicated less sensitivity to the antiviral effects of type I IFN [66] and generally 10-fold higher amounts of rfeIFN were found in titration experiments to be required for the inhibition of all five viruses. average fold viral inhibition in CrFK cells by the Sup 2216 was approximately half that observed in fcwf-4 cells. the kinetic curve of viral RNA loads in cultures of cells treated with Sup 2216 of this cat was similar to those obtained in cells treated with 50U rfeIFN. also, treatment of the cells with ODN 2216 directly affected neither viral RNA nor viral DNA loads measured in the supernatants and the cells respectively. the highest Mx mRNA levels in target cells were conferred by Sup 2216 of cat c08. RNA loads were measured at the indicated time points by real time RT-PCR. Ct values were normalized to detection of a housekeeping gene. results are indicative of those obtained with supernatants from PBMCs. no other treatment-specific alterations were noted in hematological values throughout the experiment. mRNA levels of Mx increased by 8.8 and 3.8-fold within 24 h in both treated cats and decreased gradually thereafter until 192 h post treatment. cat c08 exhibited a stronger response to ODN 2216 than cat c07. the blood of all four cats at time points 8 h-192 h were correlated with the inhibition of FCV induced in vitro. prototype CpG-A, ODN 2216, induce proliferation of primary feline immune cells and enhance their expression of costimulatory surface molecules. proliferation of PBMCs in response to treatment with CpG ODN gives strong indication about the biological activity of the stimulatory molecule. the response of cells originating from a particular cat to stimulation with ODN 2243 did not correlate with the influence of ODN 2216 on the expression of either surface molecule on these same cells. the response of cells originating from a particular cat to stimulation with ODN 2243 did not however correlate with the influence of ODN 2216 on the expression of either surface molecule on these same cells. treated feline PBMCs, FEA, CrFK and fcwf-4 cells were systematically screened for increased mRNA expression of IFN and IL-6 following stimulation. mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 remained comparatively low at all concentrations tested. the highest induction of both genes was measured 24 h after addition of ODN 2216 to the cultures. mRNA expression factors of IFN and IL-6 were measured in (A, B) fcwf-4 cells stimulated with either ODN 2216 or control ODN 2243. the transcription of both genes was assessed either 24 h after treatment of the cells with increasing concentrations of ODN (A, C, D) or over time after a single stimulation with 4 g/mL ODN (B, E, F) all individual IFN subtypes tested were induced at similar levels in the cells of four adult cats from group 2. increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA were also measured in most individuals of groups 2\u20134. increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA were also measured in most individuals of groups 2\u20134. mRNA levels of this gene were measured in immune cells of each cat. differences in mRNA levels of this gene were significantly higher in young cats (group 1) than in adult cats (p = 0.0286). expression of one of these antiviral proteins, the Mx GTPase, is known to be directly stimulated by type I IFN. 2216 stimulated PBMCs to induce intracellular antiviral mechanisms in non-immune target cells. cell-free supernatants of PBMCs derived from the blood of individual adult cats were incubated with CrFK and fcwf-4 cells. Mx gene transcription was significantly enhanced in cells treated with Sup 2216 compared to Sup 2243 (p = 0.0078) and Sup Neg (p = 0.0078) mx mRNA expression factors were assessed at the indicated time points in fcwf-4 cells after a single stimulation with either ODN 2216 or ODN 2243. mx protein was detected by Western blot in fcwf-4 cells at the indicated time points after a single stimulation with either. supernatants derived from PBMCs treated for 24 h were incubated with fcwf-4 cells. this time span indicated highest induction of antiviral mechanisms. the antiviral effects of the supernatants were initially tested on vesicular stomatitis virus as control. both Sup 2243 and Sup Neg failed to inhibit replication of this heterogeneous group of feline viruses, underlining the essential role of the 2216 molecule in conferring the observed effects. supernatants derived from ODN 2216 stimulated PBMCs inhibit viral replication in target cells. fcwf-4 cells were incubated for 24 h with the indicated supernatants derived from PBMCs of 4 kittens. each dot represents mean OD values from spectrophotometric readings of viral inhibition assays conducted on duplicate wells treated with supernatants from one cat. the differential inhibition of the viruses tested by the same supernatants is reflected by the distinct viral inhibition ratios observed (Figure 5B-E and Table 1). Sensitivity of each virus to rfeIFN correlated with sensitivity to the Sup 2216 and induction of Mx in target cells by the supernatants highly correlated with the inhibition of all viruses. this cell line has previously indicated less sensitivity to the antiviral effects of type I IFN [66]. the potential of Sup 2216 produced by the PBMCs of five adult cats (c06 and c08 from group 2; c09, c10, c12 from group 3) to inhibit productive infection of FEA cells was analyzed. treatment of FEA cells with Sup 2216 for 24 h prior to inoculation with FeLV followed by repetitive treatments of the cells with this supernatant every 2 days thereafter significantly reduced viral RNA (p 0.05) p = 0.0313) produced significantly less virus (p = 0.0313) than cells treated with Sup 2243, Sup Neg or medium alone. the highest Mx mRNA levels in target cells were conferred by Sup 2216 of cat c08. supernatants decrease retroviral DNA and RNA loads in target cells. each dot represents the mean of duplicate measurements for an individual cat. the induction of antiviral responses by ODN 2216 was measured in vivo. the molecule was administered once subcutaneously to two cats (c07 and c08), while two other cats received endotoxin-free PBS as a negative control. subcutaneous injection of ODN 2216 induces a systemic antiviral state in vivo. the cats received an injection of either 200 g/kg ODN 2216 (cats 1 and 2) or endotoxin-free PBS (cats 3 and 4). fcwf-4 cells were incubated for 24 h in duplicates with plasma collected from the cats. a single administration of ODN 2216 significantly increased the expression of Mx in the blood of treated cats. plasma from these animals could also inhibit replication of FCV in vitro. cats may highly benefit from such a molecule when placed in environments with strong infectious pressure such as catteries. potent induction of IFN and IFN increased by up to 12 000 and 35 000-fold respectively in PBMCs of certain animals. the measurements carried out 24 h after stimulation of purified feline cells support induction of Th1-oriented immune responses and enhanced NK cell activity. kittens included in this study indicated a tendency to develop an immunologic environment with a Th2 orientation. these observations strongly corroborate the immature IFN system of neonatal mice [70], the impaired immune cell activation via TLR9 in human neonatal mononuclear cells [71,72] and the bias towards Th2 rather than Th1 responses in human fetuses and neonates [73,74] expression of other antiviral molecules such as 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) was not measured. differential interplay between several effector mechanisms most likely leads to the inhibition of individual viruses. in comparison to other groups, CpG-A have been used in much less studies concerning innate antiviral responses. a single subcutaneous injection of ODN 2216 sufficed to induce the systemic presence of antiviral molecules for 24 to 36 h in the plasma of treated cats. a single subcutaneous injection of ODN 2216 sufficed to induce the systemic presence of antiviral molecules for 24 to 36 h in the plasma of treated cats. this molecule has the potential to outweigh those observed with recombinant IFN. future studies should aim at optimizing the kinetics of these molecules in vivo. future studies should aim at optimizing the kinetics of these molecules in vivo."}
