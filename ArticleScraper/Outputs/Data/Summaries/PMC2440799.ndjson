{"summary": "personal respirators, surgical masks and home-made masks were more efficient than surgical masks, which were more efficient than home-made masks. outward protection (mask wearing by a mechanical head) was less effective than inward protection (mask wearing by healthy volunteers) population-wide use of face masks may significantly decrease transmission of SARS. some transmission may occur via direct contact with respiratory secretions. this may allow containment of major outbreaks like pandemic influenza. personal respirators confer a higher degree of protection than surgical masks. in professional situations, ample time might be available prior to use to ensure a perfect fit and to give extensive counselling on adherence. a review among health care workers could not determine whether personal respirators conferred better protection for the health care workers than surgical masks. each volunteer followed the same protocol wearing a FFP-2 mask 1872V\u00ae. it is the European equivalent of a surgical mask (1818 Tie-On\u00ae, 3M) each volunteer was asked to perform five successive tasks in a fixed sequence 1.5 minute of duration. 22 volunteers, all adults, 10 men, 12 women, were divided into 3 groups. each group wore a single type of mask for a period of three hours. each group wore either a FFP2 mask (4 males, 4 females), a surgical mask (3 males, 4 females) or a home-made mask (3 males, 4 females) all volunteers received written information prior to the experiments. a parent gave oral informed consent, and a parent remained present. a higher PF is better and PF = 1 means complete absence of protection. 0.05, the ratio is considered significantly different from 1 ( = indifference) at the 95% level. study was undertaken to assess short-term protection for different types of masks worn during 10\u201315 minutes by the same volunteer following a standardized protocol. the portacount\u00ae can register particles floating in the air with sizes between 0.02 m to 1 m, covering most of the size range of infectious respiratory aerosols. at least 10,000 particles per cm3 particles of this size class were present in the room which were produced by a number of lit candles. a TSI portacount Respirator Fit tester simulated the effectiveness of different types of masks in reducing outgoing transmission from an infectious subject shedding aerosolised particles. this was simulated by fitting the different types of masks to an artificial test head, which was connected to PC-driven respirator. only expiration was simulated; twice for each mask at each respiratory rate. the probability scale (0,1) to the real axis (-infinity, +infinity) allows standard regression techniques to test the effects of co-variables on transformed PFs in a linear model. the p-values are based on testing the ratio of mean squares for a factor (like \u2018mask\u2019) and the mean square of errors (random fluctuations), assuming that ratio is F-distributed. mask type was a strong determinant of protection (p0.001) children were significantly less protected than adults (p0.001) adjusting for covariates, face mask type had a strong independent effect on protection (p0.001) no activity nodding shaking reading walking Tea cloth Start 2.8 (2.5\u20133.1) 2.4 (2.3\u20132.6) 2.5 (2.3\u20132.8) 3.4 (2.9\u20133.7) 2.4 (2.2\u20133.1) End 3.2 (2.7\u20133.4) 2.7 (2.5\u20133.0) 2.9 (2.6\u20133.4) 4.3 (3.5\u20135.2) 2.9 (2.8\u20132.9) Surgical mask Start 3.9 (3.4\u20136.1) 3.6 (3.1\u20137.1) 3.8 (3.7\u20137.3) 6.5 (4.3\u20137.2) PFs for teacloth did not differ during the repeated measurement at each breathing flow, so light blue triangles overlap in figure. simulated breathing frequency did not significantly affect measured protection factors. mask type had a strongly significant independent effect on protection (p0.001) children were significantly less protected than adults (p0.001) there was no significant impact of activity on protection. no activity nodding shaking reading walking Tea cloth Start 2.8 (2.5\u20133.1) 2.4 (2.3\u20132.6) 2.5 (2.3\u20132.8) 3.4 (2.9\u20133.7) 2.4 (2.2\u20133.1) End 3.2 (2.7\u20133.4) 2.7 (2.5\u20133.0) 2.9 (2.6\u20133.4) 4.3 (3.5\u20135.2) 2.9 (2.8\u20132.9) Surgical mask Start 3.9 (3.4\u20136.1) 3.6 (3.1\u20137.1) 3.8 (3.7\u20137.3) the simulated breathing frequency did not significantly affect the measured protection factors in the reverse flow experiment. the main determinant of the magnitude of protection factors measured by masks was the type of mask, which can be seen as a proxy for potential reduction in infectious disease transmission. a reduction in protection was found with the home-made mask. the reverse was seen for the home-made mask. it is possible that home-made masks still confer a significant degree of protection. the difference in measured protection against inward and outward protection is remarkable. a differential effect on the amount of leakage seems most plausible. wearing of face masks, even surgical masks by patients might still significantly reduce transmission. cities where strict interventions were implemented early on to prevent transmission were overall worse-off than cities where some degree of transmission occurred early on [16]."}
