{"summary": "FPV is a member of the genus Protoparvovirus (formerly Feline panleukopenia virus) protoparovirus is one of eight genera of vertebrate viruses within the subfamily Parvovirinae of the family Parvoviridae. FPV is able to infect cats by first binding to the feline transferrin receptor (fTfR) expressed on the surface of cells, followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis clinical cases of FPL have rarely been diagnosed in Australia since the mid-1970s, and there have been no reports of outbreaks for over 40 years. the contemporaneous re-emergence of FPL in geographically distinct settings long considered FPL-free has raised questions as to whether virus-related or other unknown risk factors played a role in the observed FPL outbreaks. case data were extracted from a national online companion animal disease surveillance-reporting database launched in January 2010. data obtained were searched to identify cases for which serial monitoring of faecal shedding of FPV or CPV had been performed. information about animal movements, biosecurity and vaccination protocols was obtained from shelter veterinarians and/or managers. individual case data for UAE cases were available during the period of the outbreak in 2017. gen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or by homogenisation, boiling and centrifugation. extracted DNA was amplified by conventional PCR using 5 u/L of My Taq HS Red DNA polymerase (Bioline, USA), 1\u201390 ng of DNA, 1 x MyTaq Red reaction buffer and a final primer concentration of 0.2 M in a final reaction volume of 25 L. sequences were edited, assembled and aligned using the ClustalW algorithm in Geneious Prime (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) sequences were translated in MegaX, and amino acid substitutions compared to the ICTV reference FPV sequence (FVP-3 Genbank accession no. EU659111) were identified. qPCR was performed to determine FPV viral loads in DNA extracts of mesenteric lymph nodes and tissues from these cases. qPCR was performed to determine potential faecal co-pathogens including Feline coronavirus, Tritrichomonas foetus, Clostridium perfringens and Giardia spp. Australian case data were extracted from a national online companion animal disease surveillance-reporting database launched in 2010. data included case occurrence date, shelter location, shelter post code, age at diagnosis, sex, post code of owner residence or where found as a stray before entry into shelter. data obtained were searched to identify cases for which serial monitoring of faecal shedding of FPV or CPV had been performed. a stored faecal sample from a cat diagnosed with FPL in the first outbreak in australia in 2014 was obtained for study. DNA Extraction and PCR DNA was extracted for sequencing of the Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 VP2 gene from tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or by homogenisation, boiling and centrifugation, as previously described. PCR products were performed commercially (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea) primer sequence and amplicon length for amplification of the VP2 region. sequences were edited, assembled and aligned using the ClustalW algorithm in Geneious Prime. qPCR and multiplex PCR were performed to determine FPV viral loads in DNA extracts of mesenteric lymph nodes and tissues from these cases. qPCR was performed to determine potential faecal co-pathogens including Feline coronavirus, Tritrichomonas foetus, Clostridium perfringens and Giardia spp. 610 cases of FPL diagnosed in australia between January 2014 and September 2018 from 11 animal shelters, 2 rescue societies and 11 veterinary hospitals. of the 610 cases, 87% were shelter-housed, 12% were privately owned cats presenting to veterinary hospitals and 1% were from foster carers working with rescue societies without premises. the distribution of Australian cases by geographic region and year is shown in Table 2 and Figure 1. the geographic area involved in recurrent seasonal outbreaks centred around Outbreak 1 from 2014 to 2018 expanded southwest in 2016, west in 2017 and northwest in 2018 (Figure 2). cases from the Mildura region outbreak were centred around the townships of Mildura (2a), Bendigo (2b) and Daylesford (outbreak 1 site) three shelters in Melbourne, one did not vaccinate cats, while two vaccinated cats on admission, one using an inactivated vaccine and the other an MLV vaccine. all shelters that used vaccinations gave a primary course to kittens starting at a minimum age of 6 weeks. adult cats were given two vaccinations one month apart. diarrhoea was reported to be haemorrhagic in 13 of 83 cats (16%) with diarrhoea. overall mortality for all 610 cats was 95%. cases diagnosed in shelters were routinely euthanised at diagnosis. all cats had a positive faecal CPV antigen test result (FASTest Parvo Strip, Megacor Hoerbranz, Austria) all cats had been vaccinated on admission using an MLV FPV vaccine (Felocell 3 or Felocell 4, Zoetis Pty. Ltd.) clinical data are presented in Table 3. 3.3. case data\u2014UAE cases Fourteen cases of FPL from Dubai, UAE, were diagnosed in domestic crossbreds with positive perivascular lymphocytes and plasma cells, macrophages exhibiting erythrophagocytosis, occasional neutrophils and rare eosinophils. case 111, 16-week old shelter-housed cat from Sydney, Australia, with diarrhoea, vomiting and fever, diagnosed with FPL. sections of bone marrow examined were either hypocellular, characterised by increased numbers of erythroid and myeloid precursors and megakaryocytes. some sections of the liver demonstrated hepatocellular atrophy and congestion, with minimal periportal mononuclear infiltrates. morphological diagnosis was moderate diffuse acute neutrophilic enteritis with crypt necrosis, epithelial regeneration and rare intranuclear viral inclusions. findings consistent with FPV/CPV infection. mild 219 9.5 1 11 Diarrhoea 1.77 103 3.4 103 Feline coronavirus NT, CBC WNL 220 13 1 7 Diarrhoea 8.22 109 6.48 104 Feline coronavirus Mild diffuse fibrosis of lamina propria, CBC: mild lymphopenia 221 7 1 7 Conjunctivitis, weight loss 1.08 1010 1.27 108 Clostridium perfringens changes in the duodenum were similar to but more severe than those described above in case 221, including crypt necrosis and abscessation. there was moderate lymphoid depletion in mesenteric lymph node tissue. findings consistent with FPV/CPV infection. the largest Australian clade (C) comprised 66 viruses from NSW and one from Queensland, collected between December 2016 and February 2018. a sequence isolated from a cat from Melbourne in 2018 was identical to viruses in clade C, with the exception of a mutation at position 694 (A694G) that resulted in an amino acid substitution I to V. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 3 MK570707, MK570714, MK570737 and MK570676 have identical amino acid sequences. 5 MK570645 has an identical amino acid sequence; 6 MK570724, MK570725, MK570718 and MK570675 have identical amino acid sequences. FPV vaccine strains are shown in bold italic in the clades adjacent to the bold pink line. the cat, from Canberra in the Australian capital Territory, had been vaccinated 16 days before with the same MLV vaccine strain. another sequence in this clade was from a 14-week-old stray kitten with vomiting, diarrhoea and failure to gain weight. all 11 VP2 sequences from cats from Dubai fell into a single clade containing four unique sequence types. those viruses sampled from new Zealand in 2017 were either identical (eight of nine animals) or clearly very closely related to a vaccine strain. the single sequence that was not identical to that of the vaccine strain exhibited just two nucleotide substitutions. between January 2014 and September 2018 from 11 animal shelters, 2 rescue societies and 11 veterinary hospitals. of the 610 cases, 87% were shelter-housed, 12% were privately owned cats presenting to veterinary hospitals, and 1% were from foster carers working with rescue societies without premises. the distribution of Australian cases by geographic region and year is shown in Table 2 and Figure 1. annual seasonal outbreaks centred around outbreak 1 from 2014 to 2018 expanded southwest in 2016, west in 2017 and northwest in 2018. there was expansion of the area involved in recurrent seasonal outbreaks centred around Sydney from 2016 to 2018, to involve the Central Coast region of NSW. cases from the Mildura region outbreak were centred around the townships of Mildura (2a) and Benetook (2b) for 177 shelter-housed cats, the median time from admission to diagnosis of FPL was 9 days (IQR 0\u201317; range 0\u201361 days) of the 610 cats diagnosed with FPL, 528 (87%) had never been vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination history. for 17 cats 16 weeks of age at the time of their last vaccination, the vaccination-to-disease interval was >10 days for 4/5 cats vaccinated with 2 inactivated vaccines. total mortality for all 610 cats (16%) was 95%. cases diagnosed in shelters were routinely euthanised at diagnosis. 610 cases of FPL diagnosed in australia between January 2014 and September 2018. the first outbreak occurred in Melbourne, Victoria, between January and April 2014. a second outbreak occurred in Mildura, Victoria, 560 km northwest of Melbourne, from February to April 2015. between one and four recurrent seasonal outbreaks were documented, as well as isolated cases outside of the major outbreak regions. two private shelters in Mildura were transported for rehoming to a shelter in 2014 and 2015. none of the three shelters in Mildura vaccinated cats while under their care. all shelters that used vaccinations gave a primary course to kittens starting at a minimum age of 6 weeks. data on specific clinical signs were available for 153 cats. most common clinical signs were diarrhoea (54%), lethargy (48%), vomiting (36%), anorexia (27%), weight loss or failure to gain weight (14%) and sudden death (10%) median age at diagnosis was 9 weeks (IQR 6\u201314 weeks, range 2\u2013105 weeks) at diagnosis, 32% of cats were unvaccinated, 58% had received one vaccine, 8% had been vaccinated twice, and 2% had been vaccinated three times. all cats had a positive faecal CPV antigen test result and were euthanised at diagnosis. necrotizing lymphoplasmacytic-to-suppurative enteritis was characterized by variable blunting, fusion and loss of villi. the remaining crypts were often ectatic, with variable numbers of crypt abscesses. the submucosa and tunica muscularis were variably expanded by congestion, fibrin, oedema, haemorrhage, perivascular lymphocytes and plasma cells. the subcapsular and medullary sinuses were expanded by erythrocytes, oedema fluid and moderate to markedly increased numbers of macrophages, some exhibiting erythrophagocytosis. extramedullary haematopoiesis characterized by the presence of myeloid and erythroid precursors was variably present within spleen and lymph nodes. sections of bone marrow examined were either hypocellular, characterised by rare epithelial cells contained 4\u20136 m-diameter polygonal-to-ovoid, eosinophilic-to-amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. morphological diagnosis was moderate diffuse acute neutrophilic enteritis with crypt necrosis, epithelial regeneration and rare intranuclear viral inclusion. -Pathogens Detected on Multiplex PCR/Giardia Faecal Antigen Tests Histological Findings\u2014Small Intestine 216 10.5 2 15 Weight loss, diarrhoea 2.48 108 4.12 103 Feline coronavirus NT 217 11 2 15 Diarrhoea 9.63 106 6.79 103 NT NT 218 10.5 1 14 Dehydration, diarrhoea case 221 1 N: Number of vaccinations received; 2 D: Days since last vaccination; CBC: complete blood count; NT: not tested; WNL: within normal limits Figure 5.

CPV vaccine viral loads in recently vaccinated dogs are 4- to 5-fold lower than those of dogs infected with field strains. the VP2 sequence of an FPV strain detected in a healthy feral cat in 2010 was genetically distinct from outbreak strains in this study. a report of FPV detection in the bone marrow of a healthy feral cat from Melbourne in 2012 provides evidence that FPV has been circulating widely in Australia, at least since the 1970s. the diagnosis was initially based on consistent clinical signs and a positive faecal antigen test. faecal antigen tests detect both field and vaccine strains of FPV and CPV. sensitivity of faecal antigen tests is influenced by viral load in faeces. in one cat, high loads of vaccine strain virus were detected concurrently in lymph node and faeces (FPV_221, Table 3), which is more consistent with loads attained by pathogenic virus strains than with those attained by vaccine virus strains. the sequencing chromatogram showed no evidence of a coinfecting FPV or CPV. a three-year period, caused by two distinct FPV lineages, raises the question as to why this disease is re-emerging. failure to vaccinate or inadequate or inappropriate vaccination in shelter-housed cats were major contributors to the re-emergence of FPL in Australia. 45% of kittens to seroconvert after vaccinations at 8 and 12 weeks of age with the commercial FPV MLV vaccination [37,38] this immunity gap relates to persistent maternally derived antibodies (MDA) in kittens, which decline below protective titres yet effectively neutralize the vaccine virus and thus prevent seroconversion. thanasia rates from 74% in 1995 to 27% in 2018. similar declines in euthanasia have occurred in shelters in other countries. similar seasonality of FPL outbreaks was reported in the northern Hemisphere."}
