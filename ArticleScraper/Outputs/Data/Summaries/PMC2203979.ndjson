{"summary": "time series methods are commonly used to detect disease outbreak signatures from varying respiratory-related diagnostic or syndromic data sources. methods We consider time series models for chest radiograph data obtained from Midwest children's emergency departments. these models incorporate available covariate information such as patient visit counts and smoothed ambient temperature series. the key issue at hand is to design statistical modeling and detection methods that can address these problems. the key issue at hand is to design statistical modeling and detection methods that can address these problems. time series methods for modeling and detection of respiratory-related outbreak signatures based on chest radiograph ordering patterns from pediatric emergency departments in the midwestern region of the united states. a patient visit count series is included in the models to account for variations between-EDs (like ED sizes) and within-EDs (day-of-week, for example). Ivanov, et al. [6] use the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average smoother to measure timeliness, sensitivity, and specificity of free-text chief complaints. they indicate that the methods are good for detecting relatively large seasonal outbreaks, but not for small outbreaks. daily chest radiograph counts, daily ED visit counts and daily temperature plots are shown in Figure 1. each of the five metropolitan children's hospitals, plots of the daily chest radiograph counts, daily ED visit counts and daily temperature plots are shown in Figure 1. this is especially important when we analyze filter-based detection methods in this article. the filter-based theory allows us to directly assess the effect of additive stochastic outbreaks signatures upon the radiograph series. the first ten months of data (Jan to Oct, 2003) were used as the training set, while the remaining ten months (Nov, 2003 to Sep, 2004) were used to evaluate the model and detection methods. a stochastic model for an inhalational anthrax outbreak is proposed. the model incorporates two elements: 1. a stochastic model of infection and progression of the disease. 2. a model of health-care-utilization that tracks the behavior of each individual. the probability that at least one spore germinates is called the attack rate (AR) for a given attack rate, the probability that at least one of the D spores germinates within t days is given by F(t) = 1 - (1 - AR)(1-exp(-(+)t) the value of is not estimated in their data analysis. at the prodromal and fulminant stages people enter the ED with probability Pd on a weekday and Pw on weekends. at the fulminant stage, the anthrax symptoms are similar to those of a heart attack and therefore people enter the ED with higher probability. the definition of the detection processes has its origin in process control [5], and is popularly used in the context of biosurveillance [1-4,6,8]. a common parametric approach is to obtain the residual process by subtracting off the non-stationary part of the model. we then define the filter ck,j, that first decorrelates. fk,l is the filter defined by the convolution of the filters al and ck,l. we will now focus on the effect of al. each filter is an average of a number of days close to the time point. each filter is an average of a number of days close to the time point. filter consists of the current time point of the process. fk,l is a weighted average of the last 7 days, minus a weighted decaying average of the remaining past days. the weekly seasonal terms are not as strong, compared to the filter that is the convolution of the 1-day filter. daily chest radiograph counts, daily ED visit counts and daily temperature plots are shown in Figure 1. there seems to be strong seasonal component in the chest radiograph and visit series, for all the cities, which is negatively correlated with temperature. a higher number of respiratory complaints is associated with colder temperatures. the first ten months of data (Jan to Oct, 2003) were used as the training set. the remaining ten months (Nov, 2003 to Sep, 2004) were used as a test dataset. we fit a linear time series regression model using the number of chest radiographs as the response. a stochastic model of infection and progression of the disease. a model of health-care-utilization that, on a day-by-day basis, tracks the behavior of each infected individual. spores germinate or are cleared out the lung. the probability that at least one spore germinates is called the attack rate (AR) for a given attack rate, the probability that at least one of the D spores germinates within t days is given by a Poisson approximation, as AR = 1 - e-D/(+) at the prodromal stage people enter the ED with probability Pd on a weekday. at the prodromal stage people enter the ED with higher probability. the differentiation between weekday and weekend is irrelevant at this stage. filter ck,j is the filter defined by the convolution of the filters al and ck,l. we then define the filter ck,j that first decorrelates (whitens) this residual process using the one-step-ahead prediction errors and second filters this whitened series using al. we will now focus on the effect of al. each filter is an average of a number of days close to the time point. each filter is an average of a number of days close to the time point. each filter is an average of a number of days close to the time point. when al is the 7-day filter, fk,l is a weighted average of the last 7 days. fk,l is an average of 6 days in the past. most of the weight from the second average comes from around days 8\u201310 in the past. the orders pk = 1 and qk = 1 correspond to a single autoregressive and moving average term on the daily scale. with a seasonal period of seven days (s = 7), we set Pk = 1 and Qk = 1, so that the random seasonal component is a combination of an autoregressive and moving average term. is positive for all cities, largest in magnitude for Columbus, and smallest in magnitude for Chicago. the parameter estimate, V, k, relating the smooth temperature and radiograph counts is negative, indicating a significant negative association between these two quantities across all cities. k, 1 0.91 (0.05) 0.92 (0.07) 0.79 (0.13) 0.96 (0.05) 0.95 (0.03) k, 1 -0.74 (0.07) -0.83 (0.11) -0.69 (0.14) -0.90 (0.07) -0.89 (0.05) k, 1 0.88 (0.16) 0.88 (0.04) 0.83 (0.25) -0.49 (0.34) 0.84 (0.08) k, 1 -0.84 (0.17) -0 the misdiagnosis additive factor, C, was assumed to be 0.05. we added the counts from the ED visits and subsequent number of chest radiographs generated from the healthcare utilization model. each simulated outbreak will be different, we start by summarizing the distribution of Ok,t. quantiles of the chest radiograph distribution attributable to an anthrax attack. we declare that there is evidence of an outbreak signature in the radiograph data at time t if the outbreak process Dk,t, defined by (2), exceeds a given threshold, k. the threshold, k, is chosen by solving P(Dk,t > k,) = for k,. we chose the normal approximation method as it tended to preserve the specificity across the filters and EDs that we considered. the filtering operation, as defined by (3), is based on the first ten months of training data from Akron. each filtered signal is scaled by k, 0.03, calculated using a normal approximation. curves above or below the horizontal dotted line at zero indicate departures from the nominal. for the Minneapolis-St.Paul series the actual specificity is biased downwards. for the other cities, the departure from the nominal value changes as increases. detect an outbreak for each city and filter 1-day 7-day linear exponential Akron 3 1 1 2 Columbus 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Xk,t is an ARMA model with orders pk = 1 and qk = 1. instead of modeling the weekly effect using a random seasonal component we use day-of-the week as a fixed effect (covariate) Figure 9 compares the receiver operator characteristic curves for the four models across the five EDs using the linear filter. the random weekly and daily time series components in Model 1 yield higher sensitivities, compared to including a day-of-week covariate plus ARMA errors in Model 2 and 3. a smaller AIC denotes a model that better fits the data. Model 3 performed better than Model 2 in one-step-ahead predictions. model 1 fits best to the training data, even though it does not always yield the highest sensitivity. seasonal component of the time series model corresponds to an evolution of a first order autoregressive process with a measurement error over the weeks. the model fit for the data in each city was assessed using diagnostic plots. the strength of daily correlations is weakest for Milwaukee. the weekly seasonal autoregressive and moving average terms ( k, 1 and k, 1, respectively) are similar in value. we simulated an outbreak 500 times on 500 individuals using an attack rate of 0.5. the first day of the outbreak was randomly picked from a uniform distribution in the period December 5th, 2003 to June 22nd, 2004. ouris additive factor, C, was assumed to be 0.05. we added the counts from the ED visits and subsequent number of chest radiographs generated from the healthcare utilization model. each simulated outbreak will be different, we start by summarizing the distribution of Ok,t. k,t is the process defined as the sum of Ok,t, the extra radiograph counts attributable to the outbreak, and the radiograph process Rk,t that follows model (1). by applying the filter to this series we obtain the detection process that we would observe in presence of extra counts attributable to an outbreak. the filtered series will be different for each simulated outbreak pattern realization. the filtered series will be different for each simulated outbreak pattern realization. the filtered series will be different for each simulated outbreak pattern. each filtered signal is scaled by k, 0.03, calculated using a normal approximation, for comparisons to be made across filters. the spikes in the distributions of the original signal are preserved for the 1-day filter, smoothed out for the 7-day filter, and partial smoothed over for the linear and exponential filters. the 1-day filter has the poorest sensitivity. except for Milwaukee, the 7-day filter tends to have higher sensitivities. the exponential filter balances the specificity-sensitivity tradeoff. the four models we compare are: Rk,t = 0,k + V,kVk,t + T,kTk,t + Xk,t, where Xk,t is the SARIMA model used in the Results section. instead of modeling the weekly effect using a random seasonal component we use day-of-the week as a fixed effect (covariate) k + V, t V k, t + T, k T k, t + d = 1 6 D, d, k D d, t + X k, t, t + d = 1 6 D, d, k D d, t + X k, t, t + d = 1 6 D, d, k D d, t + X k, t, the random weekly and daily time series components in Model 1 yield higher sensitivities compared to including a day-of-week covariate plus ARMA errors in Model 2 and 3. this is due to the insignificance of the day-of-week fixed effect in Models 2 and 3. Across all cities either Model 2 or Model 4 had the lowest sensivities. model 1 fits best to training data, even though it does not always yield the highest sensitivity. we use chest-radiograph ordering data from five regional Midwest children's hospitals to detect signatures of respiratory outbreaks. new study shows similarities in the chest radiographs series from different EDs. similarity of the time series model across EDs have a number of ramifications for detection of outbreak signatures. this could involve joint modeling of chest radiograph and visit counts across locations. s using chest radiograph counts were different across EDs. we assume that the resulting series Xk,t is stationary. this data do not contain any known anthrax outbreaks. instead, outbreak patterns are simulated using a simple stochastic model. our solution to this problem is to jointly model chest radiograph and visit counts. so far, we have assumed that the visit counts are observed without error. we present in this paper a stochastic model of chest radiograph ordering patterns and temperature. ate-based seasonal time series model performed well across all EDs compared with fixed-effects regression models or time series models that omitted seasonal terms and/or covariates. competing interests The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests. the terms k(z) and k(z) define an autoregressive moving average process on the unit time scale. the terms k(z) and k(z) define an autoregressive moving average process on a time scale of s units. so we can model dependencies simultaneously on two different time scales. X,k() denotes the autocovariance function of the stationary error component Xk,t. the best linear one-step predictor of Rk,t is given by R k, t = 0, t + V, k V k, t + T, k T k, t + X k, t where X k, t = j = 1 m b k, j X k, t j the one-step prediction error process, Ek,t is E k, t = R k, t R k, t = X k, t X k, t = X k, t j = 1 m b k, j X k, t j = 0 m c k, j X k, t j = 0 m c k, j X stationarity of Xk,t implies that Dk,t is also a stationary process. we declare evidence of an outbreak signature (test positive) at time t if the observed detection value Dk,t is larger than a given threshold. -1() denotes the inverse cumulative distribution function for a normal random variable. the filter-based detection method requires knowledge of the \"true\" values of the model parameters. the parameter s denotes the period of the seasonality. k(z) and k(z) define an autoregressive moving average process on a time scale of s units. the model is causal (i.e., can be represented in terms of a moving average process of only past events) if k(z) 0 and k(z) 0, for complex valued z such that |z| 1. X,k() denotes the autocovariance function of the stationary error component Xk,t. the best linear one-step predictor of Rk,t is given by R k, t = 0, t + V, k V k, t + T, k T k, t + X k, t. the process Ek,t is a filtering of Xk,t and so if Xk,t is stationary we can approximate Xk,t by an autoregressive, AR(m) process ([18], Theorem 4.10.1). Moreover for large enough m, if Xk,t is an invertible time series process then we can approximate Xk,t by an autoregressive, AR(m) process ([18], Theorem 4.4.3 aj-1/a0 for j = 1,..., L - 1, and innovation variance a 0 2 X, k ( 0 ). we declare evidence of an outbreak signature (test positive) at time t if the observed detection value Dk,t is larger than a given threshold. we would like to thank Elaine Damo at Columbus Children's Hospital for collecting the data. we thank the two referees for their extensive comments that improved this article."}
