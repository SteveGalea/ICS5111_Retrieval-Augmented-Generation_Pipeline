{"summary": "W\u00e9nch\u00e9ng shrew virus (WESV) is a highly divergent coronavirus from the Asian house shrew. shrews comprise one of the largest groups of mammals. two high-affinity /TCRs used a conserved CDR1 loop to contact the ligands. the /TCRs used a conserved loop to contact the ligands. the Ebola virus glycoprotein vaccine provides robust protection of mice. removal of the N-linked glycans surrounding conserved regions of the glycoprotein does not alter vaccine efficacy."}
