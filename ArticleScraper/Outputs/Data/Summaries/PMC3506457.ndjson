{"summary": "Background Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) is a key transcription factor that plays a crucial role in host survival during infection by pathogens. it has been a priority of many pathogens to manipulate the cellular NF-B activity in order to create a favorable environment for their survival inside the host. p50/p65 heterodimer or p50/p50 homodimer are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of their association with members of another family of proteins called I kappa B (IB). degradation of IB exposes the p50/p65 nuclear localization sequence and allows NF-B dimers to translocate to the nucleus, bind to B motifs in the promoters regions of many genes, and regulate their transcription ORF1 codes for non structural proteins, essential for viral replication. ORF2 codes for the major capsid protein of HEV, called ORF2 protein. ORF3 codes for a phosphoprotein may play a key role in manipulating host-cell processes during viral infection. cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase coding sequence (NF-B CAT; [10] was used. the vector was inducible by NF-B activating agents like TPA or IL-1. no inhibition was observed by ORF3 expression. pSGI vector or pSGI-ORF2 expression plasmid treated cells with 100 ng/ml TPA for 30 minutes. Graph represents mean SEM of 3 independent sets of experiments. nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated in mock and ORF2 transfected cells. equal amounts of samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antibody. similar results have been obtained in 3 independent experiments. similar results have been obtained in 2 independent experiments. pSGI vector or pSGI ORF2 transfected cell lysates were immunoblotted with phospho-IB and total IB. the decreased band intensity in IKK expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of IB. one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 2 hours. it appears that ORF2 expression prevents the degradation of IB. aliquots of the immunoprecipitated lysate were immunoblotted with IB antibody. lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF2 antibody and radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. Graph represents percent band intensities of Skp1, Cul1 and IB (from lanes 1\u20133) levels. similar results have been obtained in 3 independent experiments. same blot was stripped, cut into halves and immunoblotted with anti-IB antibody. a parallel set of samples were labeled with [35S]-cys/met and immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF2 antibody to check the expression of ORF2. the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-myc antibody to check the expression of full-length and F-TRCP. no interaction was detected between ORF2 and IB. the possibility that TRCP over-expression might be promoting ORF2 association with IB was ruled out by testing ORF2 and IB association in full-length or F- TRCP over-expressing cells. endogenous SKP2 was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed c-myc protein (Figure 4B, middle panel) and similarly IP using myc antibody revealed its interaction with the SKP2 protein. direct interaction between ORF2 and TRCP was confirmed using an in vitro pull-down assay. immunoblot presented in upper panel was air dried and exposed to X-ray film to check for ORF2 expression (3rd panel). pSGI vector or c-Myc expression constructs were labeled with [35S]-cys/met promix, immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. EGFP, ORF2 or 35 ORF2 transfected cells were treated with LPS for 45 minutes. aliquot of the lysate was immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody. p65 NF-B binding to the MHC-I heavy chain was performed. EGFP expressing cells immunoprecipitated with rabbit pre-immune serum. Lane 8 shows ChIP from mock immuonprecipitation using p65 antibody. 10% of initial amount of chromatin used for one immuonprecipitation assay was used as input in each PCR. p65 recruitment to interleukin 8 (IL-8) proximal promoter region showed similar pattern. aliquots of the LPS treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-SP1 antibody. purified ChIP DNA was PCR amplified using MHC-I heavy chain promoter specific primer. icol acetyl transferase coding sequence (NF-B CAT; [10] was used. the vector was inducible by NF-B activating agents like TPA or IL-1. no inhibition was observed by ORF3 expression (Figure 1A) pSGI-ORF2 expression plasmid was treated with 100 ng/ml TPA for 30 minutes. CAT activity was assayed 48 hour post transfection. Graph represents mean SEM of 3 independent sets of experiments. ORF2 transfected cells were found to accumulate more p65 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction. as expected, mock transfected cells were found to contain more p65 protein in the nuclear fraction. this is due to the fact that basal NF-B activity is higher in Huh7 cells [13] similar results have been obtained in 2 independent experiments. pSGI vector or pSGI ORF2 transfected cell lysates were immunoblotted with phospho-IB, (ser 32), IB and calnexin antibodies. the decreased band intensity in IKK expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of IB. one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 2 hours. the fact that ORF2 did not interfere with phosphorylation of IB was further confirmed by checking the activity of the IKK complex. aliquots of the immunoprecipitated lysate were immunoblotted with IB antibody to confirm its presence. a parallel set of samples were labeled with 35S]-cys/met promix, immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF2 antibody and autoradiographed to check the expression of full-length and 35 ORF2 protein. similar results have been obtained in 3 independent experiments. pSGI vector (lane 3) or pSGI ORF2 (lane 1 and 2) transfected cells were labeled with [35S]-cys/met promix. same blot was air dried and exposed to X-ray film to check for ORF2 expression by autoradiography. a parallel set of samples were labeled with [35S]-cys/met and immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF2 antibody. aliquots of the lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-IB antibody. ORF2 expression led to the inhibition of IB association with full-length TRCP. no interaction was detected between ORF2 and IB. the possibility that TRCP over-expression might be promoting ORF2 association with IB was ruled out by testing ORF2 and IB association in full-length or F- TRCP over-expressing cells. SKP2 was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed c-myc protein (Figure 4B, middle panel) and similarly IP using myc antibody revealed its interaction with the SKP2 protein. direct interaction between ORF2 and TRCP was further confirmed using an in vitro pull-down assay. immunoblot presented in upper panel was air dried and exposed to X-ray film to check for ORF2 expression (3rd panel). pSGI vector or ORF2 or c-Myc expression constructs were labeled with [35S]-cys/met promix and immunoblotted with anti-SKP2 or anti-Myc antibodies. EGFP, ORF2 or 35 ORF2 transfected cells were treated with LPS for 45 minutes. total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody. aliquot of the lysate was immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody. Lane 8 shows ChIP from EGFP expressing cells immunoprecipitated with rabbit pre-immune serum. 10% of initial amount of chromatin used for one immuonprecipitation assay was used as input in each PCR. aliquots of the LPS treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-SP1 antibody. purified ChIP DNA was PCR amplified using MHC-I heavy chain promoter specific primer. the effect of ORF2 protein on expression of two TPA inducible cytokines- IL-6 and IL-8 was measured by performing real time quantitative RT-PCR. 35 ORF2 mutant that is unable to translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum was also capable of inhibiting NF-B activity, thus ruling out the possibility of ER stress induced artifact. a recent study revealed that NF-B activity is inhibited in the PBMC and liver of fulminant hepatic failure patients. non-glycosylated, cytoplasm localized ORF2 protein is not immediately degraded by the 26S proteasome complex present in the cytoplasm. experiments done using 35 ORF2 protein suggest that non-glycosylated, cytoplasm localized ORF2 protein is capable of associating with TRCP and inhibiting NF-B activity. the study confirms the NFKB inhibitory property of the HEV ORF2 protein. it provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event. all antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. cells were transfected with Lipofectin/Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. total DNA amount was equalized by adding pSGI vector. results were quantified using NIH Image V: 1.32 program. control samples were transfected with EGFP expression plasmid (pSGI-EGFP) cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and ChIP assay was performed as described elsewhere. RNA isolation and real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis RNA was isolated from Huh7 cells. [35S]-cysteine/methionine labeling mix was obtained from New England Nuclear (Massachusetts, USA) cell culture and transfection human Hepatoma cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. cells were transfected with their respective empty vectors. o protein expression TRCP protein was expressed in-vitro using pCDNA-TRCP expression construct in a coupled transcription-translation reaction (TNT kit, Promega Corp., Wisconsin, USA) nuclear fractionation was performed as described earlier [23] MS was supported by a research fellowship from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India. this work was supported by internal funds from ICGEB."}
