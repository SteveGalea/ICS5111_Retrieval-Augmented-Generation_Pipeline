{"summary": "multiple strains of this virus are common throughout pig populations worldwide. the traditional vaccine is less effective because it cannot include all the strains actively infecting people in the world. probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the \u201chost\u201d a recent report on the pathogenesis of seasonal influenza virus H1N1 in ferrets shows that this virus is also present in the intestine of the avian host [2]. therefore it appears justified to include influenza viruses in studies on the probiotic inhibition of virus multiplication both in vitro and in vivo. enterococcus faecium is authorized in the EU for safe use as a probiotic feed additive. 1106 CFU/ml of E. faecium was applied for interference studies. different concentrations of E. faecium (1.00E+05, 1.00E+06, 1.00E+07, 1.00E+08 CFU/ml) were added to subconfluent 3D4/21 and MDBK cell monolayers. cell viability was assessed by an MTT assay after a 72 h exposure. results were confirmed by another viability assay in which PI staining of dead cells is measured by flow cytometry. results are expressed as percent cell survival rates where non-treated and non-infected cells served as controls (set at 100% survival rate) and SwIV-infected cells without E. faecium treatment as the complete damage marker (set at 0% survival rate) 106 CFU/ml E. faecium were added for 60 or 90 min to cells in 96-well plates according to the experimental design described in Fig. 6. results are means standard deviation from three independent experiments. flu virus particles could be engaged in direct physical interaction with the probiotic bacteria which may lead to a loss of infectivity. to address this question we included an experiment where virus particles were mixed with probiotic bacteria in a test tube and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. /21 MDBK Virus control Virus+ E. faecium Log10 TCID50 6.270.12 3.630.15** 5.470.64 3.600.53** m NO 6.360.03 10.821.72** 4.280.70 5.210.41 after preincubation of SwIV and E. faecium for 1.5 h. the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 showed a low expression at 2 h, but increased strongly at 6 h and 24 h in the probiotic-treated cultures. however, E. faecium promoted an increased expression of IFN-, at 2 h, 6 h and 24 h. 1106 CFU/ml of E. faecium was applied for interference studies. different concentrations of E. faecium (1.00E+05, 1.00E+06, 1.00E+07, 1.00E+08 CFU/ml) were added to subconfluent 3D4/21 and MDBK cell monolayers. cell viability was assessed by an MTT assay after a 72 h exposure. cell viability of 3D4/21- and MDBK-cells treatment with E. faecium is measured by flow cytometry. results are expressed as percent cell survival rates where non-treated and non-infected cells served as controls. results represent means standard deviation from three independent experiments. 106 CFU/ml E. faecium were added for 60 or 90 min to cells in 96-well plates according to the experimental design described in Fig. 6. results are means standard deviation from three independent experiments. the effects of E. faecium on the nitric oxide release from 3D4/21 and MDBK-cells were measured by Griess assay according to the modalities described in Fig. 6. results are means standard deviation from three independent experiments. 3D4/21 MDBK Virus control Virus+ E. faecium Log10 TCID50 6.270.12 3.630.15** 5.470.64 3.600.53** m NO 6.360.03 10.821.72** 4.280.70 5.210.41. results are means standard deviation from three independent experiments. the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 showed a low expression at 2 h, but increased strongly at 6 h and 24 h in the probiotic-treated cultures. cytokine response of 3D4/21 cells to SwIV challenge was determined after a 1 h treatment. in vitro experiments using porcine H1N1- and H3N2-influenza virus in MDBK- and 3D4/21 cells. results demonstrate that the probiotic effectively protects host cells from swine influenza virus infection. probiotics may also have potential for the control of respiratory viruses. a 1 h exposure of the monolayers to E. faecium before virus-infection led to a 2\u20133 log-unit loss of virus titer. the probiotic must alter host cell factors which apparently results in an inhibition of influenza virus multiplication. the difference between the values of non-treated and E. faecium treated cells was found to be non-significant. the difference between the values of non-treated and E. faecium treated cells was found to be non-significant. this cytokine is clearly enhanced in the macrophage cell line upon E. faecium treatment. /21-cells with E. faecium led to an decreased expression of TLR-3 at 2 h and 6 h post infections compare to virus alone which suggest that the probiotic induced modulation of this receptor may have a role in the antiviral function of E. faecium. a substantial portion of the input virus particles are indeed trapped by the probiotic bacteria. we hypothesize that the use of E. faecium as a probiotic feed (or food) additive has the potential of reducing influenza virus infections in mammalian tissues. experiments with piglets which are fed E. faecium as a supplement are presently in progress. 3D4/21 cells were maintained in advanced Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Biochrom). cytotoxicity of E. faecium To determine possible cytotoxic effects of E. faecium, different concentrations (1.00E+05, 1.00E+06, 1.00E+07 or a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 was applied at a concentration of 106 CFU/ml. after E. faecium was washed off two times, 1% penicillin/streptomycin was used to stop the propagation of E. faecium. it allows us to define at which time during virus growth the addition of the probiotic is most effective. defined standard samples were assessed in parallel to produce a standard curve. 50 l of a sulfanilamide solution (1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid) were added to each well for 10 minutes at room temperature. then 50 l of the NED Solution were dispensed at room temperature for 10 minutes and absorbance at 570 nm measured using a microplate reader. PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 l in an iCycler iQ detection system. the expression of each gene was analyzed using the relative quantification method. the designations of genes, the primer sequences, the annealing temperatures, and the sizes of the amplification are listed in Table 2. Virus, cells and probiotic The SwIV strains H1N1 (A/Swine/Greven/IDT2889/2004), H3N2 (A/Swine/Bondelum/IDT5959/2007), Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells were a generous gift from Dr. R. D\u00fcrrwald (Impfstoffwerk Dessau-Thornau, Germany) s (1.00E+05, 1.00E+06, 1.00E+07 or 1.00E+08 colony forming units (CFU)/ml) were added to 3D4/21 and cell viability was monitored by a methylthiazolyl-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. cell monolayers were washed after the 72 h treatment period, 20 l MTT in PBS was added to each well and the plates were further viral titers were calculated as 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) by titrating supernatants containing H1N1 or H3N2 SwIV in tenfold steps. three days after infection, indicator cells were stained by Giemsa (Sigma) and the cytopathic effect was observed macroscopically and under the microscope. E. faecium (1.00E+06 CFU/ml) were mixed with 0.01 MOI SwIV in a total of 1 ml DMEM for 90 min co-incubation at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator for 1.5 h. the mixture was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 10 min. total RNA was isolated from sediments and M protein of SwIV was amplified. data analysis for virus titers and NO release was performed by two factorial ANOVA followed by a post hoc test. P values of 0.01 were considered statistically very significant."}
