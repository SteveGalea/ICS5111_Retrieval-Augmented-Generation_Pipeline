{"summary": "NS proteins are not found in the mature virion but are crucial for viral replication. NS4A is small integral membrane protein containing four predicted transmembrane segments (pTMSs) pTMS1 and pTMS3 is not part of the mature NS4A. the mechanism by which NS4A induces the curved morphology of these newly formed membranes is still unknown. pTMS2 of NS4A could support membrane undulations upon stable association with the membrane [8], a recent study showed that pTMS1 is the major determinant in this process. NS4A(1\u201348) interacts with highly curved small unilamellar liposomes under -helix formation. mutated NS4A(1\u201348, L6E;M10E) does not. NS4A(1\u201348) in presence of membrane mimicking SDS micelles. labeling reaction was wrapped in aluminum foil and incubated on a rocking platform shaker at 4 \u00b0C for 16 h. lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) in chloroform solution was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA) nm (15 times) and 30 nm (15 times) nuclepore polycarbonate membranes (GE Healthcare) with nominal pore diameter of either 50 or 30 nm, followed by sonication with a 3 mm microtip of a Branson 250 sonifier (15 cycles of sonication, 20 s each, interrupted by cooling for 2 min after each cycle) samples were centrifuged for 14 h at 259,000 g and 4 \u00b0C in a polyallomer centrifuge tube. each sample was carefully overlaid with two cushions of decreasing sucrose concentration, i.e., 1.2 mL of 20% (w/v) followed by 200 L of 10% (w/v) sucrose. nuclear magnetic resonance experiments were conducted at 30 \u00b0C on Bruker Avance III HD NMR and Varian VNMRS instruments. samples for resonance assignment contained 300 M [U-15N, 13C]-labeled NS4A(1\u201348) in sample buffer. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced directly to internal 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid at 0 ppm. liposomes were studied based on a series of 2D (1H\u201315N) heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra recorded with 40 M peptide in NMR buffer but with different amounts of liposomes. spectra were acquired with 150 complex data points in the 15N time domain, up to 128 scans per t1 increment and a recycle delay of 1.5 s. NS4A(1\u201348, L6E;M10E) stock in sample buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl) were combined with 100 L of 0.4 M NaHCO3 and the pH was adjusted to 8.3. labeled protein and free dye were separated on a superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) the hydrodynamic radius of each liposome preparation was determined by dynamic light scattering. liposome solutions (20 mg of POPC per mL) were diluted 100-fold with buffer directly after extrusion or sonication. samples were centrifuged for 14 h at 259,000 g and 4 \u00b0C. fluorescence images were taken in front of a mini transilluminator. wild type and mutant NS4A(1\u201348) were mixed with sonicated POPC liposomes. NS4A(1\u201348) in sample buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl) as used for liposome flotation experiments. supplemented with 10% (v/v) deuterium oxide and 0.03% (w/v) NaN3 (referred to as NMR buffer) a small protein of 5 kDa molecular weight is expected to have a mass density well above 1.41 gcm3 [25] and thus will accumulate in a sucrose rich layer of high mass density. the mutated peptide NS4A(1\u201348) remains in the high density layer with 35% (w/v) sucrose even after 14 h of centrifugation. Alexa-488-labeled NS4A(1-48) was loaded to the 35% (w/v) sucrose layer without adding POPC liposomes. as expected, the peptide did not significantly migrate during the 14 h of centrifugation. the observed cross peaks characterize the free peptide conformation. peak positions did not significantly change, except for R12. strongest peak intensity reduction is observed in the N-terminal region. cross peaks of the central region from A21 through L31 of NS4A(1\u201348) show rather uniform intensity reduction upon gradual liposome addition. all free state peaks remain visible and retain about 10% of their original intensity even in the presence of 10 mgmL1 POPC. onicated POPC liposomes revealed no changes in cross peak positions. all cross peaks observed in buffer remain visible in presence of liposomes. peak intensity reductions in the N-terminal and central regions are quite moderate. Alexa-488-labeled NS4A(1\u201348) apparently binds to small sonicated POPC liposomes and migrates with the liposomes to the top of the gradient. the mutated peptide NS4A(1\u201348, L6E;M10E) remains in the high density layer with 35% (w/v) sucrose even after 14 h centrifugation. PC Liposomes NMR spectroscopy was used to identify the regions of NS4A(1\u201348) associated with POPC liposomes. no assignments were obtained for S1 and N42 and four residues only lack amide (1HN, 15N) assignments. some peaks in this region completely disappear already at 2.5 mgmL1 POPC (N5, I7, E9, G11, K20) while the others are reduced to less than 40%. Binding will change the chemical environment and strongly reduce the rotational correlation time of the amino acid residues in direct contact with lipids. amino acid residues in the central region of NS4A(1\u201348) from T33 to L48 show the smallest reduction in the free state peak intensities upon liposome addition. peak intensity reductions in the N-terminal and central regions are quite moderate, in particular at low liposome concentrations. liposomes cross peak intensities remain between 40% and 80% (N-terminal region) or between 40% and 60% (central region). some interaction of the mutant peptide with liposomes is retained at the highest lipid concentration studied. NS4A(1\u201348) binds to highly curved POPC liposomes. this interaction was not observed with the mutant peptide. the main lipid binding sites of the peptide are located at the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues of NS4A(1\u201348) n-terminal region of NS4A(1\u201348) that forms AH1, an interhelical linker and the N-terminal half of AH2 in SDS micelles seem crucial for peptide binding to liposomes. the central part of NS4A(1\u201348) encompassing residues A21 to L31 shows less pronounced NMR signal intensity reduction upon titration with POPC liposomes. membrane bridging by NS4A may play a crucial role in stabilizing the complex morphology of DENV-induced ER-derived membrane structures. asymmetric insertion of pTMS2 into the inner membrane of the vesicles as well as oligomerization of NS4A may induce concave membrane curvature required for vesicle formation. liposome floatation data provide proof for specific binding of NS4A(1\u201348) to highly curved free liposomes. the main lipid binding sites in NS4A(1\u201348) are located within the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues."}
