{"summary": "hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major etiological factor of inflammation and damage to the liver resulting in hepatocelluar carcinoma. circulating prostaglandin (PGE) 2 synthesis was increased in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. the association of HBx with C/EBP contributed to the induction of COX-2. expression of tumor necrosis factor-[4,5], interleukin-6 [6], inducible nitric oxide synthase [7,8] and cyclooxygenase-2 [8,9] are increased in response to HBV infection. increases in COX-2 and PGE2 have been reported in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [8,9] HBx, a 17.5 kDa multifunctional transactivator encoded by the HBV genome [22], is likely the most important determinant of COX-2 induction in human cells infected with HBV. DNA methylation and histone modifications represent the major epigenetic mechanisms implicated in the regulation of gene transcription in mammals. our results showed that COX-2 expression was induced in both HBV-positive and HBx-expressing cells. HBx directly interacted with C/EBP, and enhanced its binding to the COX-2 promoter. both aberrant epigenetic modifications and transcription factors contribute to the HBV-induced COX-2 expression. 0/102 42/65 HBV genotype (b/c) NA 16/91 WBC (cells/l) 3615 860 7602 7640 ALT (U/L) 30 156.9 174.9 HBV DNA (copies/ml) 500 9.9E + 07 4.7E + 08 PGE2 (pg/ml) pHBV-1.2*7 is an HBV mutant that does not express HBx. the mutant failed to induce COX-2 promoter activation. HBx stimulated the promoter in a dose-dependent manner. data were normalized to the Renilla luciferase value. results are shown as fold induction over values obtained in cells not transfected with HBx, and as mean SD, n = 3. treatment with NS-398 significantly reduced the amount of secreted PGE2 secretion. this confirms the specific relationship between HBV- and HBx-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 secretion. results showed elevated levels of COX-2 mRNA in PBMC compared with healthy individuals. HBx plays a role in HBx-induced COX-2 promoter activation. luciferase activites were measured in each sample after serum starvation. all data were normalized to the Renilla luciferase value and are presented as mean SD, n = 3. at least three isoforms of C/EBP, LAP* (38 kDa), LAP (35 kDa) and LIP (20 kDa) are constitutively expressed in a variety of cell types. HBx directly interacts with C/EBP and stimulates binding of C/EBP to the COX-2 promoter. FP alone and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies. HBx co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous C/EBP. HBx directly interacts with C/EBP and stimulates binding of C/EBP to the COX-2 promoter. excess non-labeled C/EBP probe (100-fold) was used as a competitor. pCMV-HBx or pCMV-Tag2A were transfected with mock transfected cells. studies have suggested that HBx may interact with bZip factors through the bZip domain, which promotes the binding to and activation of target promoters. nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells (Figure 3C), or from HepG2 cells transfected with pCMV-HBx (Figure 3D) HBx stimulates the binding of C/EBP to the COX-2 promoter. demethylation activates COX-2 promoter activity in HBV-positive cells. demethylation activates COX-2 promoter activity in HBV-positive cells. the COX-2 promoter was sequenced from genomic DNA isolated from HepG2 cells. the percentage of methylated CpGs was significantly lower in HepG2.2.15 cells (35.7%) than in HepG2 cells (59.1%) demethylation of NF-AT sites is essential for NF-AT binding and promoter activation. we performed EMSA using nuclear extracts from HepG2.2.15 cells. methylation of these nucleotides inhibited the formation of DNA-protein complexes. this suggests that hypomethylation of the COX-2 promoter activates COX-2 promoter activity in HBV-expressing cells. HepG2 cells were transfected with pCOX-2-Luc, pRL-TK, siDNMT1, siDNMT3A or siDNMT3B. all data were normalized to the Renilla luciferase value, and are presented as mean SD, n = 3 (*P 0.05). DNMT3B decreased COX-2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas DNMT3A increased in activity (Figure 5C). DNMT3B binding to the COX-2 promoter was reduced in HBV-expressing HepG2.2.15 cells, whereas that of DNMT3A and DNMT1 was increased. BV infection resulted in upregulation of COX-2. we analyzed COX-2 mRNA expression by quantitative RT-PCR. the amount of COX-2 protein was next estimated by Western blot analysis. regulation of COX-2 correlates with the expression of HBx. pCOX-2 promoter was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene. pHBV-1.2 contains 1.2-fold length of the HBV genome. HBx stimulated the promoter in a dose-dependent manner. COX-2 promoter activity was measured by transfecting HepG2 cells with pCOX-2-Luc and pHBV-1.2 or pHBV-1.2*7, an HBx-deficient HBV mutant. all data were normalized to the Renilla luciferase value. the concentration of secreted PGE2 was higher in HBV-positive or HBx-expressing cells as opposed to control cells. we then confirmed the specificity of COX-2 regulation for PGE2 secretion by treating the cells with NS-398, a selective inhibitor of COX-2. this confirms the specific relationship between HBV- and HBx-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 secretion. a single mutation in the C/EBP, CRE, or double mutation in both, nearly abolished the activation of the COX-2 promoter by HBx. this suggests that HBx induces COX-2 expression in a C/EBP- and CRE-dependent manner. pCOX-2-Luc, pCMV-HBx, pCMV-LAP, and pRL-TK were transfected. luciferase activity was measured as described in (A) (*P 0.05) the C/EBP transcription factor family contains at least six members. HBx directly interacts with C/EBP and stimulates binding of C/EBP to the COX-2 promoter. HBx co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous C/EBP. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-HBx or GFP alone. excess non-labeled C/EBP probe (100-fold) was used as a competitor. polyclonal anti-C/EBP was incubated with nuclear extracts prior to addition of the probes. luciferase expression in cells transfected with both pM-HBx and pVP16-LAP was much higher than in control cells. previous studies have suggested that HBx may interact with bZip factors through the bZip domain, which promotes the binding to and activation of target promoters. demethylation activates COX-2 promoter activity in HBV-positive cells. cells were transfected with pCOX-2-Luc and pRL-TK. 5-aza-CdR was added to a final concentration of 1, 2, or 4 M. aza-CdR was added to a final concentration of 1, 2, or 4 M at 6 hours post-transfection. cells were allowed to grow for another 24 hours for qRT-PCR. luciferase data were normalized to that of the Renilla luciferase value. the percentage of methylated CpGs was significantly lower in HepG2.2.15 cells (35.7%) than in HepG2 cells (59.1%) we then tested the influence of methylation on the affinity of NF-AT to its binding motif on the COX-2 promoter. activity of total cellular DNMTs increased in HepG2 and HepG2.2.1.5 cells. DNMT3B is responsible for the hypomethylation of COX-2 promoter. DNMT3B is responsible for the hypomethylation of COX-2 promoter. co-transfection of DNMT expression plasmids with pCOX-2-Luc revealed that DNMT3B decreased COX-2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. DNMT3B decreased COX-2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas DNMT3A increased in activity. demethylation-linked recruitment of multiple transcription factors to the promoter activated HBV-induced COX-2 expression. HBx is a transcriptional activator required for viral infection and contributes to HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. coexpression of HBx and COX-2 was detected in chronic liver diseases associated with HBV infection. HBx also promotes tumor cell invasion by inducing membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase and COX-2. NF-B, C/EBP, and CREB are the primary transcription factors responsible for the regulation of COX-2 expression. previous studies have proposed promoter methylation as a mechanism to regulate COX-2 expression in tumors. other studies have shown that DNA methylation of certain promoters is associated with HBV infection. DNMT3B but not DNMT1 or DNMT3A was critical for methylation of the COX-2 promoter. the binding of DNMT3B to the COX-2 promoter was decreased in HBV-expressing cells. DNMT3B but not DNMT1 or DNMT3A plays a major role in methylation. the COX-2 promoter is hypomethylated in HBV-expressing cells. in normal cells, the promoter region of COX-2 is hypermethylated. transcription repressors such as DNMT3B bind to the methylated CpG sites and repress its activity. 102 healthy individuals (83 males and 18 females with mean age 45.4 13.8 years) with no history of liver disease were randomly selected as controls from the local blood donation center. written informed consent was obtained from each participant.
