{"summary": "1-12 Computational and experimental methods for identifying disorder in proteins continue to undergo rapid advancement. 8 out of 213 published papers on -Synuclein and 9 out of 965 papers on amyloid include the terms \u201cintrinsically disordered protein\u201d or \u201cnatively unfolded protein\u201d. Keeping up with the field represents a challenge due to increasing awareness and use of the term and the breadth of coverage across multiple disciplines in the literature. the digest is to provide an unbiased and condensed survey of the literature on a quarterly basis. the first issue of the disorder Digest19 gained significant attention of readers. the dynamic nature of disordered proteins represents a challenge to the experimental paradigm of structural biology. multiple biophysical methods are available to verify and further classify flexible proteins/regions, including circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and NMR. conserved regions of disorder may play a role in some protein families and domains. the domain in question has a highly variable sequence that is consistently disordered. this is true for the C-terminal variable 5 (v5) region of the protein kinase C family. the polyproline-II (PPII) helix is an extended, flexible, left-handed helix without regular hydrogen bonds. it is the only recurring structural class besides helices and sheets. a structural transition can be triggered by denaturants. an experimentally determined amino acid propensity scale was used as a predictive tool to check for PPII propensity in representative proteomes. they found that PPII helices could be predicted with reasonable accuracy and PPII propensity was highly correlated with phosphorylation sites and disordered regions. cis isomerization occurs at the minute time scale, and thus is the rate-limiting step of antigenicity. it is difficult to experimentally observe dynamic structures in action. demonstrating functional behavior that is truly independent of structure is often hindered. a study of SARS-CoV N protein also uses the disulfide bond trap to great effect. intrinsic disorder is an essential component of membrane-less intracellular compartments in eukaryotic organisms. the axin scaffolding protein has a long intrinsically disordered region that facilitates phosphorylation of -catenin by recruiting kinases. this \u2018stochastic machine\u2019 is dependent on only a few very well-conserved residues. this demonstrates how intrinsic disorder has been conserved to prevent autoubiquitination by conservation of sequence and hydrophilicity. the bag6-Ubl4A-Trc35 complex interacts tightly with ER membranes to promote ER-associated degradation pathways. however, how this interaction was facilitated was unclear. in-like protein (Pup) is intrinsically disordered in monomeric form. it only becomes structured upon binding to its ligase. some of the unique functions of Pup are likely to be facilitated by its intrinsic disorder. selenoprotein S (SelS) is an enzyme that has the rare selenocysteine amino acid in its disordered cytoplasmic tail. this residue makes SelS aggregation-prone, which has hindered characterization of enzyme function. it was found that SelS has thioredoxin-dependent reductase activity as well as low peroxidase activity. IDPs/IDPRs may serve as regulators of presynaptic assembly and function by dynamically regulating protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications. also examples of structured features facilitating functions of disordered regions, as disordered protein interactions are often weak. molecular dynamics simulations provide a tool with which to computationally examine the dynamics of a protein over time. molecular dynamics simulations provide a tool with which to computationally examine the dynamics of a protein over time. intrinsically disordered peptide, amyloid (A) features heavily in molecular dynamics studies, due both to its importance, and the abundance of experimental data. the intrinsically disordered peptide, A, features heavily in molecular dynamics studies, due both to its importance, and the abundance of experimental data. cozzetto et al.65 explores the application of disorder prediction to the study of protein function. many proteins in UniProt have no experimentally assigned or extrapolated function. authors suggest disorder prediction may provide insight into protein function. molecular dynamics simulations provide a tool with which to computationally examine the dynamics of a protein over time. replica exchange molecular dynamics with solute tempering was used by Musiani et al.58 to study an intrinsically disordered enzyme. A is a small peptide, derived from the amyloid precursor protein. it is best known as a component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer disease. they argued against using a quasi-harmonic approximation of conformational entropy for IDPs. cozzetto et al.65 examined residue pair frequencies in known ordered proteins vs. known disordered protein sequences. authors suggest disorder prediction may provide insight into protein function and help fill some of these gaps. a review by Kragelj et al.69 discusses the use of chemical shifts to characterize IDPs in greater depth. both experimental details and ensemble generating algorithms are introduced. traditional multidimensional NMR techniques suffer from limited signal dispersion. a study by Knapman et al.72 profiles use of this technique in the study of the conformational states of two IDPs. ESI-IMS-MS was able to detect a metal ion-induced structural transition of apo-osteocalcin to the holo-form because of its ability to separate conformational states. a review by balasubramaniam and Komives75 highlights the use of this technique on detecting IDPs a review by Bukowska et al.76 summarizes the uses and applications of the most common crystallization chaperones. this review addresses an emerging technique of capturing intermediate structures not identifiable by traditional crystallization methods. many proteins in Toxoplasma gondii are readily acetylated and deacetylated. the distinction between constitutively spliced and alternatively spliced proteins is being questioned. Tekaia et al.81 analyzed the composition of transcribed megasatellites. they show that half of the megasatellites are predicted to encode for intrinsically disordered proteins/regions. Kotta-Loizou et al.100 compiled a data set of moRFs in membrane proteins found in the PDB. they found that moRFs were mostly located on the cytoplasmic segments, that moRF containing proteins were implicated in protein binding and cell signaling. they found that moRF containing proteins were implicated in protein binding and cell signaling. 69 discusses the use of NMR chemical shifts to characterize IDPs in greater depth. both experimental details and ensemble generating algorithms are introduced. traditional multidimensional NMR techniques suffer from limited signal dispersion. ESI-IMS-MS was able to detect a metal ion-induced structural transition of apo-osteocalcin to the holo-form because of its ability to separate conformational states. a review by balasubramaniam and Komives75 highlights the use of this technique on detecting IDPs as well as common features of IDPs. ska et al.76 presents the uses and applications of the most common crystallization chaperones. this review addresses an emerging technique of capturing intermediate structures not identifiable by traditional crystallization methods. many proteins in Toxoplasma gondii are readily acetylated and deacetylated. ed proteins under tissue specific regulation showed the most significant trend toward disorder. flexible disorder, but not constrained disorder was significantly enriched in tissue-specific alternative exons. constitutive exons flanking the tissue specific alternative exons were high in constrained disorder, phosphosites and linear motifs. Kotta-Loizou et al.100 compiled a data set of moRFs in membrane proteins found in the PDB. they found that moRFs were mostly located on the cytoplasmic segments, that moRF containing proteins were implicated in protein binding and cell signaling. they found that moRF containing proteins were implicated in protein binding and cell signaling. a computational analysis of disorder in the p53 family by Xue et al.117 reveals that these disordered regions are characterized by high sequence variability. the level of intrinsic disorder is positivity correlated with the level of sequence variability, providing further evidence that p53 may be intrinsically disordered in vivo. a point mutation known to increase susceptibility to Alzheimer (K280) shifted the morphology of tau and increased aggregation. this group of proteins frequently contains large intrinsically disordered regions that may be implicated in neurological diseases. et al.124 used cryoEM as well as molecular dynamics simulations to further elucidate this interaction. found that an intrinsically disordered penton base surface loop on the viral capsid stabilizes the complex by interacting with HD5 in multiple conformations. this model is applicable to hAdV that is both sensitive and resistant to defensin activity. islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is usually unfolded in monomeric state but can form oligomeric fibrils. the p53 tumor suppressor family is known to function as a hub protein through interactions with various partners. p53 has a conserved and structured DNA-binding domain, which is surrounded by disordered regions. the authors suggested conformational plasticity may impart a functional advantage to this hub protein, while simultaneously making -synuclein prone to dysfunction. one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease is aggregation of the intrinsically disordered protein tau. NS3 is intrinsically disordered, and undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to a structural zinc ion. this binding event is essential for formation of a stable active site and thus protease activity. this binding event is essential for formation of a stable active site and thus protease activity. the ability of the N-terminus to adopt multiple conformational states is dictated (at least in part) by its dynamic phosphorylation. the genome encodes six proteins (V1, V2, C1, C2, C3, C4), and Guha et al.129 characterized C4. ATPase activity was metal-ion dependent, which implies disorder-to-order transition is required."}
