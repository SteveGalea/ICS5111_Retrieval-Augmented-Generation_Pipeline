{"summary": "acute respiratory tract infection is the most important cause of acute respiratory tract infection (aRTI) in neonates and young children. rapid point-of-care diagnostic tools allow timely identification of viral pathogens. RADT sensitivity is strongly dependent on high viral load of respiratory specimens. detection of influenza virus (Alere i influenza) provides test results in less than 15 min. the test is optimized for point-of-care settings and does not require specific training or experience in laboratory techniques. no data have been published regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the novel Alere i RSV test. the mean threshold cycle (CT) value of RSV-positive samples was 22.7 (95% CI, 21.4 to 24.0), and the median CT value was 22.3 (range, 15.0 to 33.8). the Alere i RSV test result was true positive in 49 out of 49 samples and true negative in 63 out of 65 samples. realStar RSV RT-PCR result Positive Negative Positive (n) 49 2b Negative (n) 0 63 Alere i RSV sensitivity (% (95% CI) 100 (93\u2013100) Alere i RSV specificity (% (95% CI) 97 (89\u2013100) a The Alere i RSV assay displays a combined result without providing further information on RSV subtype. both RSV A and B strains were reliably detected by the test assay. this provides clinicians with the confidence to act appropriately when a negative test result is obtained. the assay requires 3 to 4 min of hands-on time. a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was obtained from children hospitalized with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. all NPS specimens were refrigerated at 4\u00b0C. within 24 h, aliquots were prepared and stored at 80\u00b0C for further analyses. RNA was extracted from 140 l universal transport medium using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit. RT-PCR results with a CT value of 35 were considered positive. samples with invalid test results were excluded from the analysis. a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was obtained from children hospitalized with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. all NPS specimens were refrigerated at 4\u00b0C. within 24 h, aliquots were prepared and stored at 80\u00b0C. RNA was eluted in a total volume of 60 l, of which 10 l was transferred to the Altona RealStar RSV PCR master mix. RT-PCR results with a CT value of 35 were considered positive. samples with invalid test results were excluded from the analysis."}
