{"summary": "in the 1960s, an adult male was found in the busy out-patient department of a major London hospital late on a Friday. he claimed that he had had chickenpox as a child and that he had not been vaccinated. the staff of the OPD were faced with a man with a widespread vesicular skin rash and a slight fever and a dilemma\u2014was this a case of smallpox\" variola virus has been eradicated as an endemic pathogen from the world\u2019s population since 1980 [1] but stocks of the virus remain under WHO supervision. some variola virus may yet remain elsewhere, forgotten in a deep-freeze [9] or as dried crusts, and escape. other viruses also cause vesicular lesions which may mimic smallpox. ms or non-infective conditions may cause similar skin lesions as listed in Table 1 and Table 2. some non-infective conditions may cause similar skin lesions. Herpes varicella zoster (VZV) Chickenpox, usually in childhood or Shingles (herpes zoster = recrudescence of previous varicella) Lesions smaller, frailer and less deep-seated than smallpox. ms present Contact dermatitis No specific micro-organisms present * Lesions in patients who are immunodeficient or immunosuppressed may be more florid and may become generalized. Vaccinia virus (VACV) Vaccination = local, self-limiting lesion endemic in cattle and buffaloes. poxviruses have been found in other vertebrate and invertebrate species. the genus orthopoxviruses (OPV) is most relevant for man and many higher animals. the widely used VACV \u201cescaped into the wild\u201d and variants of VACV are now globally endemic. ectromelia virus (mousepox), squirrel- and volepox virus have not been shown to cause infections in humans. in immunocompromised patients, all OPV (and other rash agents) can cause severe generalized rashes and systemic disease. the origin of present day vaccines strains is heterogeneous. the origin of present day vaccines strains is heterogeneous. the origin of present day vaccines strains is heterogeneous. ovoid and surrounded by long parallel spiral surface threads. well-circumscribed inclusion bodies developed consisting of a moderately dense matrix that included numerous mature virions. CPXV are typical of CPXV but found with few other poxvirus genera. a boy from Democratic Republic of Congo with a generalized MPXV zoonosis. the vesicular lesions appear solid and are nearly all at the same developmental state. the virions appear solid and are nearly all at the same developmental state. the clinical appearance in man and the associated viruses are shown. ovoid particles are readily detected among some cellular detritus. the number of particles observed is consistent with a concentration of 107\u20138 particles per mL in the original specimen. the five virions shown at higher magnification are typical members of the PPV genus. two other poxvirus genera may be involved in human disease. the widespread human-specific Molluscipoxvirus (MCV) causing single or multiple small wart-like lesions in man, called molluscum contagiosum. two virus species of the order Herpesvirales\u2014varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV)frequently cause infections in man. VZV is the cause of the common chickenpox in children. the electron-dense stain used in DEM preparation often penetrates the capsid, giving a dark, \u201cempty\u201d appearance. the clinical appearances of chickenpox, shingles and cold sores, with their associated viruses, are shown in Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12 and Figure 13. herpes simplex eruptions on lips and chin of a young woman. labile envelopes are stain-penetrated and reveal similar capsids. upper virion also shows glycoprotein spikes in the periphery of its envelope. the electron-translucent portions inside the core contain nucleoproteins associated with the viral DNA. underneath the lipid bilayer the ill-defined tegument and the slightly angular cores are seen. the latter contains the electron-dense viral genome. small aphthous ulcers in the mouth and vesicular lesions on hands and feet have not been shown to reach EM-detectable levels. anthrax can cause cutaneous skin lesions, usually a single \u201culcer\u201d, which evolves into a black scab later. the lesions contain numerous large gram-positive rods, often containing a central spore. the chance of variola virus being the cause may now be very small. electron microscopy should remain an indispensable constituent of diagnostic virology. electron microscopy should remain an indispensable constituent of diagnostic virology. automated pattern recognition techniques are being developed and supported by telemicroscopy. the relative lack of sensitivity by DEM can be partially corrected by using immune EM. NS-DEM flourished when it was applied to examining the relatively clean fluids from suspect skin lesions. DEM is a catch-all method, able to detect unexpected viruses and other agents including bacteria and some parasites. presently, point-of-care or bedside detection assays are being developed for many infections to enable diagnosis in less than an hour. Specimen collection and preparation Collecting Diagnostic Fluids from Vesicles Vesicle fluid for DEM should be collected in parallel with samples for NAT, using sterile instruments and one of four different techniques. it is prudent to collect at least three replicate samples: for DEM, for NAT, for cell culture or for any necessary confirmatory tests. the \u201cdirect touch technique\u201d appears particularly efficient because it is the prickle cell layer of the skin lesions that produces the virus. when biopsies are taken, the bottom and roof of the lesion will contain virus concentrations at least 10-fold higher than plain vesicle fluid [40,47]. the internal \u201ctriple coil\u201d (the DNA-containing inner body) is typical of OPV [92] despite poor structural preservation, the size, shape and the internal \u201ctriple coil\u201d are typical of OPV [92]. DEM is a technique whereby an aqueous solution of a heavy metal salt is applied to a specimen. the stain forms a closely fitting, electron-dense \u201cglass\u201d around any objects on the grid. it is important to maintain their hydrophilicity; it is important to maintain hydrophilicity. cell-culture supernatants helps to achieve a more even staining by removing coarse debris. a number of fine tipped forceps are required to handle the grids. small strips of torn-edged filter paper are used to draw off excess stain from the grid. using forceps, a grid is laid onto the sample droplet. the grid is transferred to a succession of washing droplets (50 L of distilled water) to remove salts reliably and fine debris that can obscure the surface detail on any virus present. sample volumes below 5 L may be placed directly onto the grid s surface for adsorption. a loss of fine structure and the appearance of larger stain crystals can be avoided by storing grids in vacuo in a desiccator containing some phospho-pentoxide. dem takes 1 h (30 min at 25 \u00b0C/30 min at 37 \u00b0C) samples should be inactivated using a structure-preserving and efficient aldehyde disinfection scheme. the procedure damages neither viral fine structure nor virus detectability. DEM is a catch-all method, able to detect unexpected viruses and other agents including bacteria and some parasites. presently, point-of-care or bed-side detection assays are being developed for many infections to enable diagnosis in less than an hour. Specimen collection and preparation Collecting Diagnostic Fluids from Vesicles should be collected in parallel with samples for NAT. it is prudent to collect at least three replicate samples: for DEM, for NAT, for cell culture or for any necessary confirmatory tests. alternative methods are: aspirate fluid from three lesions into a small tuberculin-type syringe with a fine needle. the \u201cdirect touch technique\u201d appears particularly efficient because it is the prickle cell layer of the skin lesions that produces the virus. when biopsies are taken, the bottom and roof of the lesion will contain virus concentrations at least 10-fold higher than plain vesicle fluid [40,47] a young mother was sent to a dermatology Poliklinik in 1973 with provisional diagnosis of a syphilitic lesion on the tip of her tongue. the internal \u201ctriple coil\u201d (the DNA-containing inner body) is typical of OPV [92] despite poor structural preservation, the size, shape and the overall size and shape are revealed. the preferred technique to collect such sample fluid should be agreed between the DEM lab and the respective hospital or Public Health institution beforehand. aspirate fluid from three lesions into a small tuberculin-type syringe with a fine needle. open the surface of a vesicle using a sterile (injection) needle. close the tube at both ends with dental wax. the \u201cdirect touch technique\u201d appears particularly efficient because it is the prickle cell layer of the skin lesions that produces the virus. when biopsies are taken, the bottom and roof of the lesion will contain virus concentrations at least 10-fold higher than plain vesicle fluid. this \u201cdirect touch\u201d requires practice to avoid damaging the support grid, and should be used only by specially trained staff or experts in DEM. the patient was sent to hg for DEM to look for a viral cause. grids touched onto the ulcerous surface were stained with 2% PTA. the internal \u201ctriple coil\u201d (the DNA-containing inner body) is typical of OPV [92]. negative contrast is a method whereby an aqueous solution of a heavy metal salt is applied to a specimen. the stain forms a closely fitting, electron-dense \u201cglass\u201d around any objects on the grid. Biological materials are not electron dense and appear as lighter structures amidst the darker \u201cstain\u201d a number of fine tipped forceps are required to handle the grids. micro-pipettes (Eppendorf or fine-drawn Pasteur) are used to handle droplets of the sample. small strips of torn-edged filter paper are used to draw off stain. grids from different patients are clearly identified and kept separate. the NS procedure consists of floating the grid with the adhering sample face down on the stain for a few seconds. the grid is removed, surplus stain is drawn off with the torn edge of a piece of filter paper and placed face up on the filter paper and covered. each washing step will appreciably reduce the number of particles on the grid. a loss of fine structure and the appearance of larger stain crystals can be avoided by storing \u201cvaluable\u201d grids in vacuo in a desiccator containing some phospho-pentoxide as a desiccant. a number of alternatives, e.g., ammonium molybdate, sodium silico-tungstate and uranyl formate have also been used successfully. the procedure takes 1 h (30 min at 25 \u00b0C/30 min at 37 \u00b0C) the samples should be inactivated using a structure-preserving and efficient aldehyde disinfection scheme. the safe handling of organisms liable to cause a serious epidemic will be governed by local Governmental regulations. DEM can be part-time and run in parallel with other activities, e.g., academic structural research and education. centralized Imaging Facilities at universities can also take on DEM when, in an emergency, a rapid catch-all diagnosis is required. DEM cannot be run automatically on a machine; it means searching proactively for suspicious structures whilst not giving up too soon. NAT, serological and other machine-based methods can run several samples simultaneously, but DEM requires undivided attention. the high costs of buying and maintaining a suitable EM and the salary of suitably qualified and dedicated staff are formidable barriers to continuing investment in DEM. current recommendations are still to make both NAT and DEM available as diagnostic techniques in parallel, in the event of a possible OPV outbreak. direct sedimentation of particles onto the grid increases the number of particles visible on the grid 50- to 100-fold. a virus-specific antibody, if available, when bound to the grid, can enrich the number of detectable viruses again by several orders of magnitude. DEM works by immediate pattern recognition as a prima vista diagnosis. lower concentrations of an inconspicuous agent will require enrichment techniques. a specimen can only be labelled \"No virus seen\" after a minimum of 20 min intense searching of several squares of the grid. hg found a febrile unconscious middle-aged male patient with a vesicular rash and signs of raised intracranial pressure. NS-DEM at the RKI revealed numerous virus particles typical of the Herpesvirales order. the patient was treated with high-dose acyclovir and recovered completely. three herpesvirus particles are seen in a flat and even PTA-stain. the measured diameter of the cores and the appearance of the envelope remnants allow a safe diagnosis: \u2018particles of the order Herpesvirales.\u2019 (b,c) are at the same magnification and reproduced from [73]. the time taken to make a diagnosis in these situations will always be an important factor. EM in virology generally remains important. emerging or re-emerging viruses must be fully characterized to establish their place in virus classification. deM remains a potent weapon in our defences against epidemic viruses, old or new. morphological diagnosis can be sufficient for public health officials to rule out suspected dangerous outbreak."}
