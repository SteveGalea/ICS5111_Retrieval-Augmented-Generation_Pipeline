{"summary": "human cathepsin W (CtsW) was among the well-scoring hits identified in a genome-wide RNAi screen for host factors required for IAV replication. it was suggested that CtsW could play a role in IAV entry (15) siCtsW treatment did not lead to a significant reduction in VSV titers. the requirement of CtsW is specific for IAV but independent of the cell line and IAV strain. natants were analyzed for viral growth by plaque assay on vero cells. efficiency of knockdown was analyzed by Western blotting (immunoblotting [IB]) using a mouse monoclonal anti-CtsW antibody and an antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as loading control. cells treated with siSCR showed a clear signal of NP. cells treated with siCtsW or the siVATPase control showed a drastic reduction in nuclear NP. the NP signal at 3 h p.i. within cell nuclei was quantified. Western blot for knockdown control was performed by cotransfection of a CtsW-encoding plasmid and siRNAs into A549 cells. at 48 h posttransfection, cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay. cells were preincubated with unlabeled streptavidin before fixation and Cy3 staining. cells were infected with biotinylated A/WSN/33 for 1 h. temperature was shifted to 37\u00b0C for 30 min or cells were directly fixed. the amount of NP colocalizing with the marker was quantified using the standard colocalization function of Imaris software for at least 10 cells per condition. the values in panels B and D are mean percentages of NP colocalized with the marker standard deviations (error bars) sW is not required for attachment or internalization of IAV. after attachment and internalization, the virus is transported through the endosomal pathway through the cytoplasm. to elucidate whether CtsW plays a role in early endosomal trafficking, we transfected A549 cells with control siRNAs or siRNAs targeting CtsW. cathepsin W is required for late endosomal escape of influenza A virus. after the endosomal pathway, viral particles are transported from early to late endosomes, where they encounter low pH. after an initial cold binding step of 1 h, the temperature was shifted to 37\u00b0C to allow virus entry. cycloheximide blocks translation and thus the synthesis of new NP. at 90 min p.i., we observed equal amounts of NP colocalizing with LBPA in both siSCR-transfected cells and in siCtsW-transfected cells. at 120 min and 180 min p.i., we detected more NP in LBPA-positive compartments. siCtsW- and siVATPase-transfected cells showed fewer fusion sites. no fusion sites were detected in siSCR-transfected cells pretreated with DMSO. infected cells were pretreated with DMSO or 10 nM bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) for 2 h. the virus was bound to cells for 30 min in a cold binding step (4\u00b0C) the cells were incubated for 90 to 180 min at 37\u00b0C to allow viral entry and fusion. we analyzed the localization of CtsW by costaining of CtsW and the ER-resident chaperone calnexin in A549 cells stably expressing CtsW. however, we were not able to costain for CtsW and the late endosomal marker LBPA. we also costained for LAMP1 as a marker for late endosomes. we tested the impact of CtsW knockdown on a strain of IAV, A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963, that has recently been shown to have a higher pH fusion optimum of pH 5.5 to 5.6 compared to pH 5.2 for A/WSN/33 (30). if reduced levels of CtsW resulted in slightly increased endosomal pH, this strain should display reduced sensitivity to knockdown of CtsW. a549 cells were transfected with siRNAs and infected with the indicated virus (MOI of 10) at 48 h posttransfection. cells were fixed 5 h p.i., stained for viral NP using a mouse monoclonal NP antibody (plus secondary antibody anti-mouse AF488) and DAPI. nuclear NP signal was quantified with ImageJ software. an aliquot of A/WSN/33 used in previous experiments was lysed and prepared for SDS-PAGE. HA was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for HA of A/WSN/33. we infected control cells or A549 cells overexpressing CtsW with A/WSN/33 (MOI of 50) for 1 h or 2 h. we did not expect NP or M1 matrix protein to be proteolytically processed by CtsW. however, no lower molecular mass bands were observed. both constructs were cloned into a lentiviral vector and used to generate stable cell lines expressing either CtsW (CtsW_res #2) or CtsW(C153A_res #2) to validate the cell lines, they were transfected with either siRNAs targeting CtsW or control siSCR. lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for CtsW expression. siCtsW_res #2 cells transfected with siCtsW #2 showed a significantly higher NP signal. this effect was specific to siCtsW #2; transfection of siCtsW #3 still resulted in a strongly reduced nuclear NP signal. we quantified the amounts of nuclear NP using ImageJ software. cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting CtsW or a nontargeting control. at 48 h posttransfection, cells were infected with A/WSN/33 with an MOI of 10 for 3 h. cells were stained using a mouse monoclonal anti-NP antibody. overexpression of CtsW can rescue the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of CtsW. the observed impact on IAV entry is caused by depletion of CtsW levels rather than off-target effects of the siRNA. pCAGGS-CtsW was generated by PCR amplifying the cDNA of CtsW from plasmid pCMV6-XL4-CTSW (CMV stands for cytomegalovirus) using the forward primer 5\u2032-GACAGAATTCACCATGGCACTGACTGCCCACC-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-GACACTCGAGTCAGGGGGGGGGGG-3\u2032. the catalytically inactive mutant Cts cDNAs were cloned into the lentiviral vector pLVX-IRES-puro. pLVX-CtsWsiRes-IRES-puro and pLVX-CtsWsiRes-IRES-puro were verified by sequencing. cells were lysed using Laemmli buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 350 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 0.01% bromophenol blue) proteins were transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Fisher Scientific) after transfer, membrane was blocked by using 3% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) supplement transfection efficiency was controlled by cell death of siRPS27A-treated cells. cell viability was monitored using cellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay. siRNA sequences were ordered with dTdT overhang and stored at 20\u00b0C. phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was supplemented with 0.02 mM Mg2+, 0.01 mM Ca2+, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. inoculum was either added at room temperature or on ice for 60 min to synchronize infection. -mouse/rabbit antibodies (catalog no. A-21202, A-21206, A10036, and A10040; Life Technologies) were used as secondary antibodies. cells were washed three times with IF buffer before the coverslips were dipped in deionized water. images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5) staining was performed on a CyAn ADP analyzer (Beckmann Coulter Inc.) data were analyzed using FlowJo software. labeled virus was filtered through a 0.22-m-pore-size filter. 293T cells were transfected with pLVX-CtsWsiRes-IRES puro (wild type or mutant), a plasmid encoding VSV-G protein (VSV-G), and an expression plasmid for HIV gag-pol. supernatants containing the lentiviral particles were harvested 48 h after transfection and supplemented with Polybrene. the medium was then changed to DMEM growth medium with 10 ng bars, 20 m. (C) A549 cells were transfected with siRNAs and infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus at 48 h posttransfection. cells were fixed 5 h p.i., stained for viral NP using a mouse monoclonal NP antibody (plus secondary antibody anti-mouse AF488) and DAPI. A549 control cells, A549 stably expressing CtsW_res #2 or CtsW(C153A)_res #2 were infected with A/WSN/33 at an MOI of 0.01. at 24 and 48 h p.i., supernatants were harvested."}
