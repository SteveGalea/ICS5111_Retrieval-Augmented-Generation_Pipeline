{"summary": "in eukaryotes, intracellular vesicle transport is mediated by vesicle transport proteins that are needed to move cargo between organelles and across the plasma membrane. the best studied examples of vesicle-forming proteins appear to initiate membrane curvature by inserting amphipathic protein domains into one side of the membrane, displacing lipid molecules and effectively stretching one membrane face more than the other. three of the eleven viruses studied showed a statistically significant correlation between virus size and shape. a correlation between size and shape was absent or reduced for GP vesicles. the correlation between size and shape was absent or reduced for GP vesicles. matrix proteins from different viruses are believed to use different methods to interact with the membrane. we compared transects through the edge of viruses, vesicles and GP vesicles using a linear mixed-effects model to detect the replacement of membrane phospholipid by lower electron density material such as protein. inner phosphate rings differed strongly from internal vesicle controls, with a significantly lower signal in all 11 viruses considered. the inner leaflet phosphate ring (area marked In) in native virus particles was only 4523% (blue vs. black, n = 11) that of the vesicles and 4631% (red vs. black, n = 5) that of GP vesicles. we had two main concerns regarding phosphate displacement. the first was mechanical \u2013 as the virus gets smaller, the membrane curves more per unit area. large particles differ in curvature per unit length, which could change how many lipid molecules the electron beam encounters at the particle edge. matrix-dependent phosphate displacement was observed across the defocus range. effect was strongest in images where both phosphate rings were visible. phosphate displacement analysis can be used on native samples. it provides complementary data on the location and footprint of single protein-membrane interactions from within the visual context of a cryo-electron micrograph. phosphate displacement analysis is a powerful technique that can be used to explore the process of curvature induction and identify new membrane-remodeling proteins. virus-SD-23983 was grown on MARC145 cells; mouse hepatitis virus-A59 was grown on mouse 17Cl-1 cells; Influenza A virus-Udorn/307/72 was grown on MDCK cells; and Murine leukaemia virus Gag particles were expressed in SF9 cells using a recombinant baculovirus expression system. a total of 27912 density traces were analyzed. a linear mixed-effects model was fitted by restricted maximum likelihood. the sample region, particle and micrograph were included as random effects. baculovirus-expressed murine leukaemia virus Gag particles were purified by density gradient centrifugation and imaged as described previously. only near-focus images where the two phosphate rings were visible were used in this analysis. key contrasts allow for multiple comparisons."}
