{"summary": "tumor cells express tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) of which many are usually in low immunogenicity. carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is specifically expressed on human colon cancer cells and is viewed as a low-immunogenic TAA. some antigenic peptides derived from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have exhibited strong immunogenicity. specific immunogenic epitopes (S978 and S1203) of the S protein of SARS-CoV have been demonstrated to exhibit a vigorous affinity towards binding with HLA-A2 and induce high levels of IFN-secreting T-cells. the highest score within the CEA-SARS sequence was 21 in the SARS region (Table 2), lower than the scores of known epitopes of L. monocytogenes for peptide/H2-Kd interaction. the highest score within the CEA-SARS sequence was 21 in the SARS region (Table 2). 132 bps (nucleotides 1280410935) of the CEA sequence (NCBI accession No. Z21818) and 177 bps of the SARS sequence (NCBI accession No. AB263618) were used as the starting materials to generate highly-immunogenic mutations. grey area indicates the epitope used for affinity prediction. pCEA-SARS-CoV group revealed significantly higher TNF- and IL-10 production than the pCEA and control groups. pCEA-SARS-CoV group revealed significantly higher production than the pCEA and control groups. sera samples were collected for in vivo cytokine detection. mice were orally immunized with 1 108 pCEA- and pCEA-SARS-CoV-transformed S. typhimurium 14 days before inoculation with colon cancer CT26/CEA cells. therapy with pCEA was not able to induce responses to reduce the growth of tumors in comparison with the control group. mice in the CEA-SARS-CoV group were fed with pCEA- and pCEA-SARS-derived epitopes once per week. the highest score within the CEA-SARS-CoV amino acid sequence was 21 in the SARS region. as a result, the highest score within the CEA-SARS sequence was lower than the scores of known epitopes of L. monocytogenes. fusion of the CEA and SARS sequences did not create a new epitope with a higher score. PCR primers used to synthesize CEA and SARS peptides. PCR primers used to synthesize CEA and SARS peptides. pCEA-SARS-CoV mice were orally immunized with 1 108 pCEA- and pCEA-SARS-CoV-transformed S. typhimurium 14 days before inoculation with colon cancer CT26/CEA cells. pCEA-SARS-CoV group revealed significantly higher TNF- and IL-10 production than control groups. five BALB/c mice in each treatment group were inoculated with CT26/CEA cells 21 days after oral vaccination with pCEA- and pCEA-SARS-transformed S. typhimurium. the tumor volume in the mice was observed, indicating that the SARS fragment provided sufficient protection against the development of tumors. poorly-immunoreactive tumor-associated antigen can effectively activate host immunity. using the prediction algorithm SYFPEITHI to enhance the affinity of antigen presentation, the resulting peptides provoked even stronger immune responses. this study also provided new insight into tumor-specific immunity. cytokine profiles arose after vaccination with pCEA-SARS-CoV. TNF- is a proinflammatory and Th1 cytokine. IL-10, a typical Th2 cytokine, is actually a pleiotropic cytokine with anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and immunostimulatory properties. non-obese diabetic mice expressed an IL-10 transgene in glucagon-producing pancreatic cells also developed accelerated diabetes. the expression of IL-10 in our model may exert not only a Th2 response, but also a Th1 effect. the addition of a SARS fragment helps to induce and enhance both Th1 and Th2 responses. the prediction algorithm increased the immunogenicity of the CEA-SARS peptide. it is possible for foreign SARS fragments to improve the anti-tumor efficacy of tumor vaccines against endogenous tumor antigens. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was selected for use in this study. fused with CEA, a low-immunogenic peptide for peptide-binding prediction. eukaryotic expression plasmid pAAV-MCS was chosen for gene insertion. six-eight-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the National Laboratory Center (Taipei, Taiwan) and housed in a temperature- and light-controlled (12L:12D) environment. mice were immunized with 1 108 attenuated S. typhimurium (in 20 l PBS) three times in two weeks. negative control group was fed with 20 l PBS alone. 108 S. typhimurium (in 20 l PBS/mouse) 4 days later, followed by re-immunization once a week after the first injection. p 0.05 was considered significant. cell culture All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (VA, USA) the eukaryotic expression plasmid pAAV-MCS was chosen for gene insertion and expression under the control of a CMV promoter. gene fragments containing CEA and SARS-CoV were both artificially synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a series of sense and antisense primers. mice were immunized with 1 108 attenuated S. typhimurium (in 20 l PBS) three times in two weeks. negative control group was fed with 20 l PBS alone. a value of p 0.05 was considered significant.
