{"summary": "many studies have shown that HAPE is a major disease that often affects nonacclimatized healthy individuals who ascend to high altitudes. early diagnosis of HAPE is essential to initiate early treatment of HAPE and maintain the safety of people who ascent to high altitude. atypical HAPE can be classified into two stages from the onset to the presence of typical symptoms. the early stage is characterized by interstitial pulmonary edema while the late stage is characterized by alveolar pulmonary edema. patients with interstitial pulmonary edema do not usually exhibit serious dyspnea. rays, HAPE often presents as decreased pulmonary transmittance, increased or obscure lung markings. on CT scans, increased and enlarged lung markings, ground glass-like changes in the lung, nodule-like shadows, scattered or isolated alveolar edema of terminal bronchioles and slim reticulate shadows. criteria 1, 2 and 3 must be met for diagnosis of HAPE. severity of disease should be graded to provide individualized therapy. if a patient with suspected HAPE is admitted, the grade of HAPE should be confirmed as soon as possible. severe patients may have pale complexion, cold sweat on the forehead, serious dyspnea, and a heavy cough with a large amount of white or pink foamy sputum. the respiratory rate is >30 breaths/min, while the heart rate is >120 beats/min. criteria 1, 2 and 3 must be met for diagnosis of HAPE. results include decreased pulmonary transmittance, increased or obscure lung markings, ground glass-like changes or patchy shadows in the lung. routine blood test findings include increased white blood cell count and increased neutrophil count. rales of small, intermediate, and large bubbles are extensive in the bilateral lungs and are accompanied by the sound of boiling water. the respiratory rate is >30 breaths/min, while the heart rate is >120 beats/min. a large amount of foam is discharged from the nose and mouth. a gurgling sound is audible in the bilateral lungs. the patient is also likely to have high-altitude cerebral edema. heart failure and secondary pulmonary infection are very likely. the white blood cell count and neutrophil count are slightly increased. patients can not lie in the supine or prone position. they may have a pale complexion, cold sweat on the forehead, serious dyspnea, and a heavy cough. a total of 400 patients with HAPE were divided into four groups. patients in group A received oxygen inhalation, dexamethasone, and aminophylline. a regimen composed of oxygen inhalation, dexamethasone, aminophylline, and furosemide is effective. our experience of on-site treatment of more than 300 patients with HAPE has shown that on-site individualized treatment is feasible, without increasing the risk for death. the efficacy of this regimen was further confirmed as the prognosis after on-site treatment was significantly better than that after blind evacuation. symptomatic treatments may include intramuscular morphine (10 mg) for patients with dysphoria, intramuscular cedilanid (0.4\u20130.8 mg) for patients with heart failure, vitamin C, ATP solution, coenzyme A, and cytochrome C, as deemed necessary. extremely severe On-site treatment is preferred, followed by escalation therapy during evacuation. supine position is recommended for patients in a coma. head vibration and bumps should be avoided to prevent cerebral hernia. treatment with digitalis is recommended to improve myocardial contractility. hypoxia results in reduced nitric oxide levels, a principle cause of pulmonary vasoconstriction. nitric oxide inhalation can reduce hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, improve ventilation to perfusion ratio, improve hypoxemia, and improve HAPE in patients with signs and symptoms. anisodamine can improve pulmonary vascular spasms, decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. anisodamine inhibits intravascular coagulation and reduces risk of pulmonary embolism. nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that inhibits release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerve endings. dexamethasone is an analog of adrenocortical hormones that can improve the functions of capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells. it can improve the functions of capillary endothelial cells, decrease pulmonary capillary permeability, protect alveolar epithelial type II cells, promote the secretion of pulmonary surfactant, increase renal blood flow. a regimen composed of oxygen inhalation, dexamethasone, aminophylline, and furosemide is effective, well tolerated, simple to follow. there were no differences in the incidence of adverse effects between regimens A, C, and D, or in the liver and kidney functions between all four regimens. atropine or anisodamine (20\u201340 mg/0.5 h), dexamethasone (20\u201340 mg/0.5 h), dexamethasone (10 mg/4 h), furosemide (40 mg/8 h), gentamicin (80000 IU/8 h); or dexamethasone (200 mg), furosemide (40 mg), atropine or anisodamine (10 mg), and gentamicin (160000 IU/8 the patient should be transported in a vehicle that can provide rapid and steady evacuation. such transportation options include helicopter, motor truck, heavy-duty medical car, and miniambulance. the patient should be ideally accompanied by one nurse and one physician. moderate Absolute bed rest, continuous oxygen inhalation or subcutaneous oxygen treatment are necessary. drugs are mainly administered intramuscularly, accompanied by oral and intravenous medication. the procedures for the treatment of severe HAPE are similar to those of severe HAPE, except for the treatment of complications. for patients with cerebral edema, the doses of dexamethasone and diuretics should be increased and airway maintenance is necessary. hypothermia is beneficial for the brain. for patients with low blood pressure, dextran and hydroxyethyl starch 40 is recommended for blood volume expansion. for patients with secondary infections, penicillin or other antibiotics can be administered. for patients with dysphoria, sedatives can be given according to the disease state. nitric oxide inhalation is a principle cause of pulmonary vasoconstriction. hypoxia results in reduced nitric oxide levels, a cause of pulmonary vasoconstriction. inhalation of nitric oxide can reduce hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, improve ventilation to perfusion ratio and improve hypoxemia. nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that inhibits release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerve endings. it is an effective vasodilator, reduces hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, increases arterial oxygen tension, improves the symptoms and signs of HAPE. nifedipine targets many of the effects of HAPE. dexamethasone is a key drug in the treatment of HAPE. helial type II cells promote the secretion of pulmonary surfactant. dexamethasone is a key drug in the treatment of HAPE. Aminophylline is a classic bronchodilator and has long been used in the treatment of HAPE. it can dilate the bronchus, decrease hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, enhance diaphragm function, suppress lipid peroxidation and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular inflammation. bronchial mucus, clear bronchial mucus, and subsequently resolve moist rales. acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity in the brain, kidney, and blood. in the brain, acetazolamide inhibits brain choroid plexus carbonic anhydrase activity to reduce cerebrospinal fluid production rate. dexamethasone is an analog of adrenocortical hormones that can improve the functions of capillary endothelial cells and studies have shown that 80\u2013100% of patients with serious hypoxemia develop HAPE. so, monitoring arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) can be used to predict HAPE. 400 L/m3, lung/body index >30, and lung/thorax index >0.24 were associated with increased risk for HAPE. they found that CO diffusion was correlated with the development of acute mountain sickness. in 10 patients with HAPE, the diffusing capacity of CO increased with increasing altitude, but the amplitude of this increase was greater in subjects without HAPE. the likelihood of acute mountain sickness was significantly greater among individuals with blood pH > 7.45 than among those with blood pH 7.45. however, they found no significant differences in PaCO2 or PaO2 between these two groups of subjects. they concluded that blood pH, but not PaCO2 or PaO2 could be used as a predictor of HAPE. cai and Yang used radioimmunoassays to measure blood levels of 18 endocrine parameters. found plasma cortisol 20 g/L and urine 17-hydroxy corticosteroid levels 17 moL/dL could predict HAPE with an accuracy >95%. Molecular Biological Parameters Luo et al. [27\u201329] compared sequences of the mitochondrial genome in HAPE patients and rats at high altitude versus sequences from healthy physiological parameters 5.1.1. Oxygen Saturation Respiratory gas exchange disorders may predict serious hypoxemia and even acute mountain sickness in individuals who rapidly ascend to high altitude. so, monitoring arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) can be used to predict HAPE. a fVC/body surface area 3 L/m3, FVC/thoracic volume 400 L/m3, lung/body index >30, and lung/thorax index >0.24 were associated with increased risk for HAPE. they found that CO diffusion was correlated with the development of acute mountain sickness. the likelihood of acute mountain sickness was significantly greater among individuals with blood pH > 7.45 than among those with blood pH 7.45. however, they found no significant differences in PaCO2 or PaO2 between these two groups of subjects. they concluded that blood pH, but not PaCO2 or PaO2 could be used as a predictor of HAPE. the discriminant model had a high sensitivity (93.9%) and a high accuracy (92.2%) for the prediction of HAPE. monitoring arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) can be used to predict HAPE. horacic volume in an effort to predict HAPE in individuals ascending to high altitude. they found that a FVC/body surface area 3 L/m3, FVC/thoracic volume 400 L/m3, lung/body index >30, and lung/thorax index >0.24 were associated with increased risk for HAPE. they found that CO diffusion was correlated with the development of acute mountain sickness. blood pH was significantly associated with susceptibility to HAPE. the likelihood of acute mountain sickness was significantly greater among individuals with blood pH > 7.45 than among those with blood pH 7.45. however, they found no significant differences in PaCO2 or PaO2 between these two groups of subjects. the discriminant model had a high sensitivity (93.9%) and a high accuracy (92.2%) for the prediction of HAPE. Molecular Biological Parameters Luo et al. [27\u201329] compared the sequences of the mitochondrial genome in HAPE patients and rats at high altitude. human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DR6, particularly DR6(1402), was associated with increased susceptibility to HAPE. they speculated that susceptibility to HAPE was related to genetic factors but was also influenced by some susceptibility genes. preventative measures are particularly important for people working at high altitude. it is essential to provide sufficient nutrients, rest, and insulation against the cold. it may entail 20\u201330 days of work at high altitude followed by a period of rest at low altitude."}
