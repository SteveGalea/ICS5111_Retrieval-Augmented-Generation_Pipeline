{"summary": "influenza A virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality. major antigenic shift associated with genetic reassortment has led to devastating pandemics in 1918, 1957 and 1968. most infections are subclinical and controlled by adaptive immune responses. the role of inflammatory response in pathogenesis of severe lung disease in macaques infected with avian influenza H5N1 or 1918 H1N1 viruses has been documented. mice lacking both tumor-necrosis factor and IL-1 receptors have reduced morbidity and delayed mortality. early attempts to use anti-inflammatory doses of to control excessive inflammation in severe H5N1 or other acute respiratory infections were associated with severe side effects without any improvement in survival. patients treated with moderate doses of statins have reduced risk of death from influenza A, suggesting that a decrease in inflammatory response may account for protection against severe infection. mice were provided with commercial rodent diet (Harlan-Teklad, Bicester, UK) and drinking water ad libitum. all animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice. antiviral activity was expressed as percentage virus inhibition. one half log10 dilutions of test compounds were added to cells 5 min prior to virus infection and remained for the entire duration of the assay (72 h) broncheoalveolar lavage fluid was collected by killing six mice. mice from each group were sacrificed on days 3 and 6 post-infection. broncheoalveolar lavage fluid was collected by killing six mice. titer in MDCK cells seeded in 96-wells flat-bottom microplates. viral cytopathic effect determined visually as an end point. survival time and rate were performed by the log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test. titer of 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of 107.19/mL. Virus amplified in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. titer of 50% tissue culture infectious dose was 107.19/mL. we used an inoculum of 100 cell culture 50% infectious doses (CCID50) per well seeded with 20 000 MDCK cells to form a monolayer in 96-well microtiter plates. other controls included uninfected controls (uninfected cells with test medium only) and virus controls (cells with virus and drug diluent) broncheoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected by killing six mice from each group on days 3 and 6 post-infection. the trachea was catheterized with PE50 tubing and normal saline was infused to collect BALF. mice from each group were sacrificed on days 3 and 6 after virus infection. each individual treatment group were pairwise compared to oseltamivir treated group. mantel\u2013Cox significance level is reported with # (#P>0.05, # #P>0.01 and # # # #P>0.001) neither sertraline nor rolipram were found to have any antiviral activity as single agents. the data are represented as fold change in IC50 of oseltamivir with sertraline or rolipram as compared to that of oseltamivir alone. 0.105 with sertraline 10 M 4.772 1.463\u201315.57 0.73 0.391 With sertraline 3 M 3.08 1.851\u20135.125 1.13 0.579 With sertraline 1 M 4.339 2.162\u20138.706 0.80 0.378 With sertraline 0.3 M 3.218 0.674\u201315.34 1.08 0.885 With sertraline 0.1 M 4.416 1.914\u201310.19 0.79 0.428 With sertraline 0.03 sertraline did not demonstrate any significant effect on mortality or survival time when used alone. survival rate was 70% on day 21 (P0.05 when compared with the oseltamivir group through Mantel\u2013Cox test, Figure 2A) there was no change in mean days to death in the combination group of sertraline and oseltamivir. there was no change in mean days to death in the combination group of sertraline and rolipram. the combination of sertraline and rolipram was more effective in preventing mortality compared to sertraline. oseltamivir alone showed a significant decrease in lung viral titer (P0.001) as did the combinations (P0.01; Table 2). it is clear from the in vitro and in vivo antiviral efficacy studies that sertraline and rolipram did not have any antiviral effect. inflammatory biomarkers were quantified in the BALF of mice treated with oseltamivir, sertraline, rolipram and their combinations on days 3 and 6 post-infection. levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-6, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were significantly reduced in the BALF of animals. all prophylactic interventions showed fewer inflammatory changes than in the virus group. combination treatment groups showed fewer inflammatory changes in bronchioles, peribronchial area and alveolar region compared to single agent and virus control groups. oseltamivir, sertraline and rolipram were evaluated for antiviral activity against influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) in a cytopathic assay using MDCK cells. the IC50 of oseltamivir was determined to be 3.47 M (Figure 1). the viral replication inhibition observed with the combinations was not significantly superior to that of oseltamivir alone. the increased survival in the combination group observed in the earlier experiment was not due to the enhanced antiviral activity of the combination. sertraline and rolipram in combination with oseltamivir on mortality in mice infected with influenza A (H1N1) virus. the oseltamivir dose used in this study was equivalent to the human dose based on its active metabolite exposure. survival in the rolipram+oseltamivir group was 80% compared to 40% in the rolipram or oseltamivir single agent groups. the combination of rolipram and oseltamivir was more effective in preventing mortality compared to sertraline. oseltamivir on (A) survival in therapeutic setting, (B) body weight and (C) mean days to death of C57BL/6 mice infected with influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) influenza virus. mice were treated for 5 days (b.i.d. p.o., n=10 per group) 24 h post-infection. inflammatory biomarkers were quantified in the BALF of mice treated with rolipram, sertraline, oseltamivir and combinations on days 3 and 6 post-infection. there was a significant decrease in cell recruitment into BALF in all the treated groups compared to the vehicle-treated group (P0.001). okines IL-6, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted. monocyte chemotactic protein-1 significantly reduced in the BALF of animals. effects of rolipram, sertraline and combinations with oseltamivir on inflammatory biomarkers. 1N1) influenza virus were treated for 5 days (b.i.d. p.o., n=3 per group) in a prophylactic setting. untreated controls show (A) infiltration of inflammatory cells clustered around bronchioles, increased exudation in alveoli and partial consolidation of the lung. rolipram, rolipram and sertraline: increased infiltration of large quantities of inflammatory cells clustered around bronchio antidepressants have been shown to be immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory against pro-inflammatory cytokine processes. sertraline levels in the lung are almost 3 times those in its target organ, the brain. there could be reluctance from patients and physicians to use a central nervous system drug for respiratory infections. anti-inflammatory drugs belonging to the SSRI and PDE4 classes improve morbidity and mortality of severe influenza in a mouse model when used in combination with the antiviral drug oseltamivir. oseltamivir achieved 100% protection in treated animals in a prophylactic setting and 80% in a therapeutic setting. oseltamivir-dependent lung viral titer reductions in experimental animals vary significantly according to the virus strain, oseltamivir dose and animal model used. significant decrease in inflammatory biomarkers compared to that with oseltamivir alone correlates positively with reduced lung inflammatory lesions and mortality. to evaluate treatment strategies with immunomodulatory agents."}
