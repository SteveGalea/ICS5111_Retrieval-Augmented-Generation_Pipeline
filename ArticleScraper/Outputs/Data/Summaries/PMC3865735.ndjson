{"summary": "severe pneumonia can lead to several complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. glucocorticosteroid is common and frequently fatal; two pathological features of lung derived from pulmonary fibrosis and sepsis are the primary etiology of death in patients with late ARDS. high doses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (3\u20136 mg/kg) were administered in divided doses for 1 to 2 days to treat patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. however, low doses of GCs successfully decreased mortality rates [8, 9]. cytokine level elevation occurred in 82% of all subjects with CAP. cytokine concentrations were highest at onset, attenuated rapidly over the first few days, but remained elevated throughout the first week. anti-inflammatory and immuneosuppression process of GCs defined to two mechanisms. regulate inflammatory transcription factor proteins such as nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), is defined as transrepression. nongenomic mechanism involves activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS) ion GCs, suppression of HPA axis and adrenal failure may result in inadequate GCs activity to down regulate inflammatory response in severe illness patients. poor prognosis in ARDS patients is frequently associated with failure of activated GRs to suppress the transcription of inflammatory cytokines. in 1995, meta-analyses found no benefit for high-dose GCs in sepsis and septic shock [34] and in the following years another meta-analyses found benefit for long duration of low-dose GCs [35]. despite providing a benefit, this study lacks sample size. a study performed in 213 CAP hospitalized patients showed 40 mg of prednisolone for 7 days or placebo, along with antibiotics, did not show difference in clinical outcome. the result showed a more frequent hyperglycemia (2.3% versus 0.9% with P = 0.27), as well as superinfection (2.1% versus 1.9% P = 0.10) and one patient in the placebo group developed a fungal infection after he was treated with hydrocortisone. low doses of GCs 300 mg/day were used successfully in sepsis studies. underlying hypotheses about successful low-dose GCs at these doses attenuated some inflammatory responses. underlying hypotheses about successful low-dose GCs at these doses attenuated some inflammatory responses. glucorticosteroid used in avian influenza is limited and lacked cases. GCs have been used clinically in the management of H5N1 patients associated with ARDS in. avian influenza. early course of GCs may be hazardous, with higher mortality and more likely to have superinfection. GCs combined with early administration of antiviral agents to pneumonia with wheezing and possibly without wheezing due to H1N1 may prevent patient's progression to severe pneumonia. studies by Liem et al. assumed treatment with methylprednisolone (1\u20133 mg/kg/day for up to 7 days) progressed to mortality (65% versus 29%; P = 0.004). findings were similar to those for GCs therapy in the treatment of avian influenza. 121 of 152 critical patients received GCs at a mean daily dose of 133.5 102.3 mg. this showed beneficial effect of GCs on mortality and shorter hospitalization days. the effectiveness of adjunctive GCs in reducing mortality and morbidity from P. jirovecii pneumonia has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials. the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and GCs as primary agent for prophylaxis therapy was responded better result in patients with hypoxemia [83]. GCs show benefit in several HIV-related conditions and as adjunctive therapy in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. GCs may reduce respiratory complication, quickly resolve architectural distortions on HRCT chest in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. practitioners should continue to evaluate and recognize patients who are potentially to enroll treatment and prophylaxis. treatment assessment of the use of GCs in human avian influenza is limited and lacked cases. early course of GCs may be hazardous, with higher mortality and more likely to have superinfection. a better clinical outcome is that GCs together with early administration of antiviral agents to pneumonia with wheezing and possibly without wheezing due to H1N1 may prevent patient's progression to severe pneumonia. a respiratory disease, caused by coronavirus or well known as SARS, quickly spread around parts of the world. early hydrocortisone administration was initiated in 7 days of illness associated with significantly higher subsequent plasma viral load in second and third weeks. low dose GCs also provided better prognosis in SARS patient's symptom. the effectiveness of adjunctive GCs in reducing mortality and morbidity from P. jirovecii pneumonia in HIV patients has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials. the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethox-sulfamethox-sulfamethox-sulfamethox-sulfamethox-sulfamethox-sulfamethox GCs use has preceded as one of the most frequent contributing agents. the most frequently observed PJP underlying diseases were hematologic malignancies (54%), solid organ transplantation (17.4%), inflammatory disorders (13%), and solid cancer (10.8%) practitioners should continue to evaluate and recognize patients who are potentially to enroll treatment and prophylaxis. GCs also have a wide range in diminishing the release of cytokines, such as those on plasma interleukin-6 levels, neutrophil counts, and BAL."}
