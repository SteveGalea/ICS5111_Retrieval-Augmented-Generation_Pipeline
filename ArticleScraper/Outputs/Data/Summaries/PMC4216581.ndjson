{"summary": "the main aim of the current research was to determine the efficacy and effect of the elapsed incubation time of treating the Vero cells infected with HSV-1 by G. glabra. the effect of cells pretreatment with licorice root extract, preincubation of virus with licorice root extract, and antiviral activity were assessed. licorice root is one of the oldest and most commonly prescribed traditional medicine, which has been used in the treatment of several diseases (4). in china, licorice (Gan Cao) has been reported as one of the oldest and most commonly prescribed traditional medicine. a nucleoside analog and an antiherpetic drug has partially fulfilled the need for treating the infection entirely. however, it leads to viral resistance and consequently, viral latency and recurrence (6). the main goal of the current study was in vitro evaluation of possible antiherpetic and virucidal activity of G. glabra. Vero cells were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and addition of antibiotics, namely penicillin and streptomycin. the cytopathogenic dose of the HSV-1 was assessed and expressed as TCID50/ml (10). cytotoxicity for Vero cells (0.2 mg/mL) was used for further experiments. Table 1 shows the Optical Density of Different Dilution Proportion of the Aqueous Licorice Root Extract in Cultured Cells. Fifty Percent Tissue Culture Infectious Dose Vero cells were cultured in 24-well microplates and inoculated with serial dilutions of HSV-1. the microplates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for seven days and were examined daily for the presence of CPE. pre-treatment of vero cells with Licorice root extract Prior to HSV-1 Inoculation Vero cells were pretreated with nontoxic concentration of the extract (0.2 mg/mL) for two hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. in the next step, cells were washed by PBS and then inoculate with 100 TCID50/mL of HSV-1. vero cells were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and addition of antibiotics, namely penicillin and streptomycin. the cells were washed with pre-warmed phosphate buffered saline. the optical density of the Neutral Red solution was measured at 540 nm by ELISA reader (Sunrise Remote, Tecan, Austria) the highest concentration that had less than 50% cytotoxicity for Vero cells (0.2 mg/mL was used for further experiments. 51 0.491 0.495 0.465 0.526 0.483 0.093 OD 0.087 0.462 0.12 0.332 0.526 0.539 0.484 0.483 0.458 0.509 0.492 0.093 OD 0.095 0.127 0.111 0.098 0.096 0.121 0.098 0.101 0.085 0.083 0.09 0.096 Mean Value 0.092 0.446 0.098 0.314 0.518 0.534 0.509 the virus dilutions were used to infect Vero cells and incubated in CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C for one hour. after one hour incubation, unabsorbed virus preparation was removed and the cells were washed by PBS and DMEM. the microplates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the licorice root extract was prepared by noncytotoxic concentration (0.2 mg/mL) of the extract and incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C for one hour. after one hour incubation, unabsorbed virus preparation was removed and the cells were washed by PBS and DMEM. the microplates were monitored for seven days to detect any CPE. one-way ANOVA test was used to compare quantitative parameters. all tests were considered statistically significant if the P values were less than 0.05. results 4.1. Cytotoxicity Cytotoxicity Cytotoxicity of the licorice root extract was examined by Neutral Red assay. the effect of the extract was significant after one and 12 hours incubation in comparison to the control virus, which was more than the logarithm variation (P 0.001). the different efficacy of the extract with respect to the elapsed incubation time was significant between one and four hours, one and eight hours, four and 12 hours, and eight and 12 hours. extract in DMEM was added to the monolayer cells after one, four, eight, and twelve hours of viral infection. the 24-well plates were incubated in CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C and monitored daily up to seven days. the results were compared to control virus. 1.273 0.052 0.001 Virus Control Incubation of virus with extract for 2 h Incubation of virus with extract for 1 h 0.173 0.052 0.040 Pretreatment of Cells With Extract for 2 h Incubation of virus with extract for 2 hrs -0.097 0.052 0.310 Incubation of Virus With Extract for 1 h Incubation of virus with extract for 2 hrs -0.270 0.052 0.001 aData are presented as licorice root extract was incubated with vero cells infected with HSV for one, four, eight, and twelve hours postinfection.
