{"summary": "the appearance of sequence variation in a nucleic acid can, in some cases, provide an advantage to an organism: a key feature in natural evolution. advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have seen the development of methods that allow the effect of such naturally occurring variation to be mimicked in the laboratory. selection strategies have been used to select nucleic acids with a large variety of properties. each strategy differs according to the feature or phenotype sought. all in vitro selection methods follow the same three-step pattern. in vitro selection strategies have been widely used for the selection of nucleic acids capable of catalyzing specific chemical reactions. these strategies have also been successfully used to identify DNA and RNA molecules with affinity for a specific ligand (i.e., aptamers) variability is introduced into the system (generally by chemical synthesis) to yield nucleic acid populations. the heterogeneity of a fixed number of nucleotides is determined by fixing the number of nucleotides to be mutagenized and the mutation rate per nucleotide. different approaches have been tried to minimize the effect of PBSs. a population enriched in the sought-after molecules (but not entirely) is produced. a new selection cycle can be undertaken by iteratively executing the process of selection and amplification. the complex of the original population is reduced and enriched with candidates of interest. these new methodologies are named according to the specific procedure employed in each method. a strategy was used to identify a transcriptional activator regulated by TMR. a chimera was constructed by tethering a TMR aptamer to the transcriptional activator. selection was performed in yeast cells containing a construct coding for the HIS3 and LacZ genes under the control of the LexA operator. riboswitch was also included in the 5UTR region of a reporter gene. it was 30 nt upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. ex vivo selection methods in cells are limited by the number of sequences that can be studied. modified oligonucleotides show advantageous properties with respect to native form. ligands are usually linked to the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 termini, which are most accessible regions for chemical conjugation reactions. fluorophore conjugation is already used in clinical diagnosis. lipophilic oligonucleotides reduce the hydrophobic character of the oligonucleotide. lipophilic oligonucleotides are also used for designing supramolecular assemblages. the use of locked nucleotides (LNAs) in the nucleotidic chain increases RNA stability. a methylene link between the 2\u2019-O and 4\u2019-C locks the sugar moiety in the 3\u2019 endo conformation. this generates the most stable hybrids ever characterized, with a Tm of +3 to +10 per LNA residue upon binding to DNA and RNA respectively. in vitro selection strategies have been extensively used to characterize known ribozymes and DNAzymes. the first observation of a DNA molecule catalyzing a chemical reaction was made when using an in vitro selection strategy. ribozymes and DNAzymes have been extensively assayed as potential therapeutic agents. in vitro aptamer selection strategies developed during the 1990s prompted the idea of Sullenger\u2019s group that therapeutic aptamers might be possible. one aptamer is already on the market as a therapeutic drug Table 1. toggle-SELEX was designed for the isolation of aptamers with a broad range of specificities for closely related targets. these aptamers were obtained by performing the selection procedure for related targets in alternating cycles. this ensures that the RNA or DNA variants resulting from selection will bind to both proteins, most likely to domains conserved between them. VEGF165 is involved in several pathological processes such as AMD, diabetic retinopathy and cancer. a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the use of this aptamer in the fight against diabetic retinopathy is underway. new RNA aptamers have been isolated that bind to the nogo-66 receptor as antagonists of myelin-derived ligands. the binding of the aptamers allow axon growth in rat ganglion cells in vitro. aptamers can also be targeted against disease-causing proteins such as the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrPSC) aptamer inhibitor ED45 inhibited hNE formation two orders of magnitude greater than RNA. anti-immunoglobulin E aptamers Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays an important role in protecting mammals from parasites. the tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR) has been targeted by aptamers. the RET aptamer, D4, a 2\u2019-FY aptamer, was isolated by ex vivo selection against the extracellular mutant RETC634y receptor. the RET aptamer, a 2\u2019-FY aptamer, was isolated against the extracellular domain. aptamers bind NF-B p50 and p65 isoforms in vitro respectively. inhibition of NF-B might be of therapeutic interest in different types of cancer, HIV-1 infection and inflammatory diseases. mer for the dimeric murine OX40 combined with a dendritic cell-based tumor vaccine promotes tumor immunity in a xenograft melanoma model in mice. aptamer ANG9-4 binds to Ang1 and inhibits its signaling pathway, leading to the reduced survival of HUVEC cells in vitro [36,104]. selectins are a family of cell adhesion molecules expressed by leukocytes, endothelial cells and platelets. they are involved in inflammatory diseases as well as tissue injury and infection. aptamers LD201, LD174 and LD196 all bound with a Kd of 1.8 nM. aptamers in a rat model of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis led to 64% reduction in mitoses by day 6 and 78% by day 9. also a 95% reduction of proliferating mesangial cells by day 9 and a markedly reduced glomerular expression of the endogenous PDGF B-chain. the proliferation of cardiac and vascular cells is key in the development of vessel resistance in diseases such as cardiac intimal hyperplasia, cardiac hypertrophy and atherosclerosis. a recent study has reported the development of an RNA aptamer able to specifically recognize members of the E2F transcription factors involved in cell proliferation. an antisense RNA molecule was designed to specifically bind the 5\u2019-half of the aptamer (the antidote) neither antidote nor aptamer have been seen to cause any adverse effect in Phase I clinical trials (Ia and Ib) factor IXa catalyzes the cleavage of factor X (pro-enzyme) to yield activated factor X (Xa), which is required for the blood clotting cascade. Thrombin is a natural target for anticoagulation therapy and numerous aptamers have been generated with different capacities to inhibit its activity in vitro. a natural double stranded DNA aptamer was found that binds to NF-B with high affinity. in a rat cardiac ischemia-reperfusion model, this aptamer significantly reduced the expected injury. the same aptamer was also studied in a murine model of nephritis. erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) of the parasitic protozoan Plasmodium falciparum achieved efficient inhibition of erythrocyte rosseting in blood cultures. a pool of hammerhead catalytic domains containing randomized binding arm sequences was assayed against an HIV-1 chimera containing the thymidine kinase gene. human influenza virus hemagglutinin protein has been inhibited in vitro by the RNA pool resulting from 15 rounds of in vitro selection. a DNA aptamer has been described that adopts a novel type of dimeric quadruplex folding and shows anti-HIV1 integrase activity in the nanomolar range in vitro. aptamers are useful tools for the study of HCV RNA synthesis. their therapeutic against HCV infection is also attractive. an alternative and innovative therapeutic approach is targeting of the structural domains of viral genomes. AP30 isolated against the HCV (-) strand IRES domain I partially inhibits (+) strand synthesis, probably by interfering with (-) strand binding. chimeric ribozyme/aptamer RNA molecules were identified simultaneously targeting two sites within the HCV-IRES. chimeric RNA inhibitors promoted IRES inhibition by up to 95% in cell extracts. aptamer-siRNA/toxin conjugates have been developed to deliver therapeutic agents within a specific target cell. ex vivo selection procedures performed against a specific cell type have yielded aptamers that are very efficiently taken up by those cells. aptamers targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen are those most used as delivery tools. doxorubicin (Dox) is a chemotherapeutic intercalating agent used against cancer. aptamers intercalates between aromatic rings of the GC pairs of the A10 aptamer. same results have been reported when using the A9-genolin conjugate. hammerhead ribozyme and an aptamer both targeting the HCV IRES have effectively inhibited IRES activity in human hepatocyte cell cultures. aptamer-based anti-degenerative disease agents To date, the only aptamer approved by the FDA [73] was approved in December 2004 for the treatment of wet type age-related macular degeneration. a selected aptamer acts as a glutamate antagonist preventing glutamate-induced activation of the cationic channel. a selected aptamer known as AN58 acts as a glutamate antagonist preventing glutamate-induced activation of the cationic channel. aptamers are currently being tested for the treatment of other degenerative diseases. anti-inflammatory aptamers Neutrophil elastase (hNE) is involved in pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, emphysema and arthritis, as well as ischemia-reperfusion injuries. aptamer inhibitor ED45 inhibited hNE formation two orders of magnitude greater than RNA. aptamers inhibited binding of IgE to its receptor FcRI. they also prevented cellular degranulation in the serum of patients with allergy to grass pollen. the IC50s for the DNA aptamers were 2\u20136 M, but when triggered by anti-IgE antibodies they reached 200\u2013300 nM. the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and binds to vitronectin, leading to the loss of adhesion. another type of therapeutic signaling modulation is the targeting of nuclear factor B (NF-B) inside cells. multimeric aptamer forms frequently improve aptamer signaling properties. an antagonist RNA aptamer against CTLA-4 inhibits its function. an agonistic aptamer against 4-1BB, a major co-stimulatory receptor, leads to activation of T cells. the anti-proliferative DNA aptamer AS-1411 was developed based on observations that guanosine-rich oligonucleotides have antiproliferative effects in tumor cells. aptamers LD201, LD174 and LD196 all bound with a Kd of 1.8 nM at 37 oC. chemotactic growth factor in form of three disulphide-linked dimers made of two homologous chains, A and B. it is involved in wound healing and is linked to the progression of numerous diseases, including atherosclerosis and glomerulonephritis. the PDGF-B aptamers were tested in a rat tumor model. the treated animals had an IFP of 9.7 mm Hg compared to 14.6 mm Hg in scrambled-RNA-treated animals. another DNA aptamer known as E1-0030 targets the PDGF-B subtype is currently undergoing Phase I clinical trials. the aptamer inhibited S-phase induction by 90% compared to controls. both natural and in vitro selected aptamers appear able to limit cell proliferation. the conversion of pro-thrombin to thrombin is delayed by a long half-life (15 h) 2\u2019-FY aptamer targeting factor VIIa in a dose dependent manner. anticoagulation system REG1 consists of RB006 (drug), an injectable RNA aptamer that specifically binds to activated factor IX (IXa) and prevents proteolytic cleavage of factor X; and RB007 (antidote), a RNA antisense oligonucleotide that neutralizes the anticoagulating effect of the aptamer RB006. In the presence of the antidot aptamer increased platelet function in whole-blood assay sensitive to vWF-mediated platelet inhibition. a slow intravenous bolus followed by 4 h of continuous infusion inhibited more than 95% of vWF function. NF-B is involved in inflammation responses and modulates the synthesis of chemokines, interferons, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. a rat global brain ischemia model showed inhibition of TNF-, IL-1 and ICAM-1 expression in NF-B aptamer-treated animals after 1 h of ischemia. neuronal damage was significantly attenuated in the NF-B-aptamer-treated group compared to controls. the proteins of different pathogens have also attracted the attention of researchers as targets for inhibitory nucleic acids. RNA aptamers have been selected against different viral enzymes and proteins involved in host-cell interactions. a DNA aptamer (termed 93del) has been described that adopts a novel type of dimeric quadruplex folding and shows anti-HIV1 integrase activity in the nanomolar range in vitro. tier-Gi's group described the characterization of two DNA aptamers (27v and 127v) that specifically bind to hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase (NS5B), inhibiting its activity in vitro. the authors also determined that aptamer 27v interfered with the multiplication of HCV JFH1 in Huh7 cells. 6 RNA promoter-driven expression with multiple binding sites targeting the whole HIV-1 5\u2019-UTR effectively inhibit HIV-1 replication in cell culture. different attempts to isolate RNA aptamers against different domains of the HCV internal ribosome entry site located within the 5\u2019-UTR. an aptamer isolated against the A chain partially restores protein synthesis levels in cell free translation systems and cell cultures. both compounds preferentially bind the open isoform of nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) found at neuromuscular junctions, autonomic ganglia and in the central nervous system. RNA aptamers developed against nAChRs with equal binding affinity for both open and closed sodium-potasium channel isoform aptamer-driven uptake of Plk-1 and Bcl-2 siRNAs leads to death of PSMA-positive cells. tumor regression was observed when the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 siRNA was delivered by a dimeric aptamer [166]. the delivery of pharmacological compounds by aptamers has also been studied by different approaches. the aptamer-siRNA linkage was improved for the easy combination of siRNAs to the aptamer and better siRNA processing by the cellular machinery. aptamers can also be used to colocalize RNA inhibitors with their specific target molecules at the subcellular level. aptamers can target RNA domains, e.g., in viral RNA genomes."}
