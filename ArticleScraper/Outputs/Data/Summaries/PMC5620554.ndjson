{"summary": "ubiquitin is a key protein in orchestrating immune responses. the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) binds the glycine of the ubiquitin to its active-site cysteine in an ATP-dependent manner to form a high-energy thioester bond. ubiquitin is transferred from the E1 to the active-site cysteine. an E3 ubiquitin ligase can interact with an E2-ubiquitin conjugase. most often the ubiquitin is covalently linked at the lysine (K) -amino group. the ubiquitin enzymes can coordinate the formation of covalently linked polyubiquitin (poly-Ub) chains. unique combination of poly-Ub chain topologies, covalent or non-covalent modifications, and chain length variation allows for precise signaling regulation. the host encodes the enzymes necessary to generate, respond to, and eliminate ubiquitin modifications. TRIMs are an E3 ligase family critical in many cellular functions. some TRIMs include only a B-box 2 domain, while others encode a B-box 1 followed by a B-box 2 [17,18]. crystal structures and biochemical analyses of the coiled-coil regions of TRIM5, TRIM20, TRIM25 and TRIM69 indicate that the TRIM dimers are formed by coiled-coil antiparallel helical structures [17,22,23,24,25] bioinformatics analysis suggests that this could be a general characteristic of the TRIM family [22] the most prevalent TRIM C-terminal domain is the B30.2, or PRY-SPRY, domain with approximately 40 members identified in humans [6,17,32]. TRIMs post-translational modifications [11,33,34,35,36,37], alternatively spliced isoforms [16,38,39], and heterodimerization [18,19] expand the diversity and functionality of this protein family. a species-specific pattern of positive selection of closely related TRIMs suggests that individual TRIMs play specific antiviral roles. TRIM overexpression influences the transcription of type-I IFN, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) the role of TRIMs in viral infection includes intrinsic restriction of viral pathogens. action of ubiquitin with its targets is catalyzed by three classes of ubiquitin enzymes. the ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) binds the C-terminal glycine of the ubiquitin molecule to its active-site cysteine in an ATP-dependent manner. interaction of the E1 with ubiquitin exposes a site to enable the recruitment of the next enzyme. ubiquitination enzymes can synthesize unanchored poly-Ub chains. the host encodes a variety of mechanisms to enact, regulate, and interpret this complex \u2018ubiquitin code\u2019. ubiquitin modification can directly influence the target molecule through induction of a conformational change. TRIMs are an E3 ligase family critical in many cellular functions. host encodes enzymes necessary to generate, respond to, and eliminate ubiquitin modifications. TRIMs are known to coordinate the ubiquitination of target proteins to assemble signaling complexes. the function of the B-box is less well characterized, however studies suggest that this domain is important in coordinating TRIM self-association and protein\u2013protein interactions. some TRIMs include only a B-box 2 domain, while others encode a B-box 1 followed by a B-box 2 [17,18] oligomerization mode of TRIM32 and TRIM25 differs greatly. TRIM members are characterized by the presence of an RBCC. TRIM-like members, including TRIM14 and TRIM16, lack a RING domain within the RBCC. clustering of closely related TRIMs suggests they evolved due to gene duplication [38,39,40,41]. close proximity of several TRIMs, particularly those with a B30.2 domain, supports immune regulation as a TRIM-mediated function. TRIM antagonists in viral genomes exemplifies the importance of TRIMs in antiviral responses. TRIM-Mediate Regulation of antiviral signaling 2.1. examples of pathways critical in response to viral infection include IFN production and signaling. TRIMs play an integral role in the positive and negative regulation of antiviral pathways. TRIMs can act as pathogen PRRs, as is case for TRIM21 in recognition of non-enveloped viruses bound by immunoglobulin (Ig) TRIMs regulate their cytokine signaling pathways through interactions with cytokine receptor adaptors (TAB2/3) and enzymatic proteins (IKK, IKK and IKK) within the signaling complexes. TRIMs can regulate their cytokine signaling pathways through interactions with cytokine receptor adaptors (TAB2/3) and enzymatic proteins (IKK, IKK and IKK) within the signaling complexes. RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein (MDA5) bind distinct viral RNA agonists yet they induce similar downstream antiviral pathways. the unique PAMPs recognized by these receptors enable the host to respond to a broader range of pathogens. TAK1 auto-phosphorylates to enable the phosphorylation of NF-B essential modulator (NEMO) to activate the enzymatic domains of IKK and phosphorylate IB. NF-B regulates the transcription of a variety of genes including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. IRFs homodimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to DNA regulatory regions. activated IRF3, NF-B, and AP-1 (activator protein 1) must translocate to the nucleus. resulting IFN- is then secreted and signals in a paracrine and autocrine manner. TRIM25 ligates K63-linked poly-Ub chains onto the N-terminal CARD at K172. TRIM25 catalyzes the synthesis of unanchored K63-linked poly-Ub chains. TRIM38 functions as an E3 SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) ligase and SUMOylates both RIG-I and MDA5. TRIM65 ubiquitinates MDA5 at the RNA helicase domain [90]. TRIM65 only promotes the restriction of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a picornavirus, and not vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus. duck TRIM25 ubiquitinates RIG-I\u2019s CARD domains and promotes RLR signaling. knockdown of chicken TRIM25 results in reduced IFN- upon infection with specific strains of the influenza A virus. TRIM25 is induced after Newcastle disease virus (NDV), poly(I:C) treatment, or poly(dA:dT) treatment [101], probably via a type-I IFN signaling-dependent pathway. ubiquitination promotes prion-like aggregation of MAVS needed for optimal signaling. TRIM31 knock-out mice demonstrated increased susceptibility to VSV infection. TRIM14 plays a crucial role in linking NF-B and IRF3 branches of RLR signaling. TRIM9s must be auto-ubiquitinated to facilitate the interaction between GSK and pTBK1 [106] TRIM11\u2019s coiled-coil domain interacts with the coiled-coil domain 2 of TBK1 to prohibit the kinase\u2019s interaction with adaptors NAP1 or TANK [108] TRIM23 is able to facilitate K27-linked ubiquitination of NEMO. TRIM30 negatively regulates the NF-B activation branch of PRR signaling. the long isoform of TRIM9 (TRIM9L) inhibits -TrcP [33]. TRIM29 targets NEMO for degradation in alveolar macrophages [115] and TRIM29 [115]. TRIMs act at several levels to regulate cytosolic RNA-stimulated responses. in the cytoplasm, the host expresses multiple DNA and RNA receptors aside from RLRs. dsDNA can result from infection with DNA viruses. murine-specific TRIM, TRIM30, ubiquitinates STING following herpes simplex virus 1. both TRIM32 and TRIM56 facilitate K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING to promote dimerization and activation of STING-mediated antiviral responses. TRIMs also modulate membrane-bound PRRs including toll-like receptors (TLRs) RAF6 re-localizes to the TLR signaling complex to activate TAK1. TRIF interacts with adaptor TRIF (tIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-), resulting in activation of TRAF3. TRIM38 targets TLR signaling at multiple points. cytosolic receptors recognize both PAMPs and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) the receptor assembles an inflammasome in cooperation with the adaptor ASC to recruit pro-caspases [134,135]. the NLRP3 (NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3) -induced inflammasome promotes the cleavage of pro-caspase 1 to caspase 1, which then promotes a pro-apoptotic murine-specific TRIM30 impairs NLRP3 inflammasome through unknown mechanism. coiled-coil domain of TRIM31 interacts with leucine rich and NACHT domains of NLRP3. TRIM27 is able to promote degradation of NOD2 [141], which may prohibit this receptor from recognizing DNA and RNA virus infection. degradation of TAB2 inhibits the recruitment and activation of TAK1. TRIM27 catalyzes K48-linked poly-Ub at residues K251 and K372 of TBK1. TRIM28 sustains expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 to promote activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. TRIM6 catalyzes formation of K48-linked unanchored poly-Ub chains. this modification increases STAT1-STAT2 dimerization at S708. TRIM22 induces the lysosome-mediated destruction of FOXO4. TRIM22 impairs the transcription of IFN- downstream of TLR3 and RLR signaling. TRIM27 impairs activation of CD4+ T cells via K48-linked poly-Ub of PI3KC2B. this impairment was observed specifically in CD4+ T cells downstream of TCR engagement and not CD8+ T cells. TRIM28 depletion in vivo promotes expansion of the Th17 population. adaptor and enzymatic molecules needed to activate and inactivate transcription factors and other effector molecules. these transitions in the transcriptional profile and functional proteome enable the cell to respond optimally to the pathogen and to communicate with neighboring cells. TRIM E3 ligases regulate IFN production and signaling as well as NF-B induction at multiple levels. TRIMs influence the recruitment and interaction of adaptor molecules (stimulator of IFN genes (STING), mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), TGF--activated kinase 1(TAK1)/MAP3K7-binding protein (TAB) 2, Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), adapter-inducing interferon- (TRIF), NF-B essential modulator (NEMO), nucleosome assembly protein ( TRIMs and the Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene I (RIG-I)-like Receptor Pathway Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) containing 5\u2019-triphophates produced during virus replication, in the cytoplasm of a host cell, act as a Retinoic acid-inducible Gene I RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) agonist interaction of the N-terminal CARDs of both the RLRs and MAVS induces the adaptor to form prion-like aggregates. NF-B regulates the transcription of a variety of genes including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. NF-B regulates the transcription of a variety of genes including pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. TRAF3, in cooperation with NEMO, recruits and stabilizes TRAF family member-associated NF-B activator (TANK) or nucleosome assembly protein (NAP1) which are critical in linking TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and in some cases inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells (IKK), to the MAVS signalosome [81,82]. TRIMs play a critical role in both the positive and negative regulation of the RLR pathway to ensure optimal virus restriction while minimizing self-inflicted damage. TRIMs 4, 13, and 38 have also been implicated in positive regulation of the RIG-I pathway. TRIM38 functions as an E3 SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) ligase. SUMOylates both RIG-I and MDA5 to prevent the ligation of K48-linked poly-Ub chains thus stabilizing these PRRs. TRIM65 was identified as an E3 ligase of MDA5. duck TRIM25 catalyzes the synthesis of unanchored poly-Ub chains to activate RIG-I. despite lacking lysine 172 in duck RIG-I, knockdown of chicken TRIM25 results in reduced IFN- upon infection with specific strains of the influenza A virus (IAV) [100], suggesting that TRIM25 is involved in activation of IFN- signaling through a type-I IFN-independent pathway. TRIM25 has been implicated in the K48-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS. this results in its proteasome-mediated degradation and release of downstream signaling molecules (TBK1, NEMO, and possibly TRAF3) to induce type-I IFN production. TRIM31 knock-out mice demonstrated increased susceptibility to VSV infection. TRIMs modulate downstream adaptors and enzymes. TRIMs can also mitigate signaling downstream of other PRRs. TRIMs identified to be involved in signaling using RLR induction. TRIM26 is able to interact with TBK1 and auto-phosphorylates K27-linked poly-Ub chains to bridge TBK1 and NEMO. this interaction was demonstrated downstream of MAVS signaling and promoted IRF3 activation. TRIM68 negatively regulates the TAB2/TAB3 complex. TRIM29 targets NEMO for degradation in alveolar macrophages. TRIM39 stabilizes Cactin [116], a nuclear, negative regulator of NF-B. some studies showing negative regulatory roles of TRIMs have only used overexpression assays with large concentrations of TRIM expressing vectors, which could lead to artifacts. the DNA helicase DDX41 recognizes both cytoplasmic dsDNA and cyclic dinucleotides, both of which promote DDX41 activation of STING. the PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM21 interacts with DDX41\u2019s helicase domain and catalyzes ubiquitination at lysine residues 9 and 115, targeting the PRR for degradation. TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA and the viral RNA mimic poly(I:C), TLR7 and TLR8 recognize single-stranded RNA, and TLR9 recognizes CpG. TLR4 is associated mainly with the plasma membrane, although it can also be internalized in endosomes. TRIM56 has been shown to promote TLR3 activation via interaction with TRIF in a RING ligase-independent manner. this interaction promotes stability of TRIF to facilitate downstream signaling. disruption of adaptor protein availability thus bottlenecks antiviral signaling. TRIM33 binds to and ubiquitinates DHX33, a cytosolic dsRNA receptor that acts upstream of NLRP3. knockdown of TRIM33 diminishes activation of caspase 1 and decreases release of IL-1 and IL-18. coiled-coil domain of TRIM31 interacts with leucine rich and NACHT domains of NLRP3. TRIM8-mediated repression of PIAS promotes IL-6-dependent activation of STAT3. degradation of TAB2 inhibits recruitment and activation of TAK1. role of TRIM28 in activation of endothelium may play an important role in immune cell trafficking in response to infection. TRIM24 inhibits STAT1 transcription via binding to the STAT1 promoter. TRIM8 destabilizes SOCS-1, a negative regulator of the IFN- signaling pathway. regulation downstream of IFN signaling suggests that this is a negative regulatory mechanism to prevent inflammatory response overactivation. TRIM22 expression in resting T cells is increased following IL-2 and IL-15 cytokine signaling [154] both of which act as pro-survival signals. deregulation of TRIM24 expression may impact the CD4+ population composition and the capacity of the host to efficiently clear the virus. TRIMs are capable of restricting the effectiveness of pathogens through direct interactions with viral proteins crucial to their entry, dissemination, or life cycle. the categories of viral restriction include: inhibition of viral transcription, replication or translation, degradation or interference of viral proteins, and impairment of virus entry or exit. AP-1-mediated innate immune signaling via synthesis of unanchored K63-linked poly-Ub chains that activate the TAK1 kinase. TRIM11 mobilizes cellular microtubule formation to prematurely uncoat HIV-1 and facilitate rapid release of the vRNA from the viral core. TRIM22 inhibits Sp1, preventing LTR-mediated transcription. rhesus macaque TRIM5 (rhTRIM5) can form higher-order structures resembling a hexagonal net. the hexagonal nets are formed from TRIM5 trimers and are dependent on the TRIM5\u2019s B-box domain. rhTRIM5 RING dimers enhance its E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and innate anti-HIV-1 activity. TRIM5 inhibits late RT products in the presence of a functional proteasome. proteasome inhibition can block disassembly and/or degradation of viral core components. further studies have shown proteasomal involvement in TRIM5 restriction of HIV-1 by degrading TRIM5 itself. multiple TRIM5 orthologs induce AP-1-mediated innate immune signaling. in the presence of the HIV-1 capsid, the E3 ligase activity of TRIM5 facilitates the generation of unanchored K63-linked poly-Ub chains. these chains promote TAK1 autophosphorylation and activation, resulting in the induction of AP-1- and NFB-mediated transcription. TRIM5-sensitive strain of SIV still developed AIDS. a third succumbed to infection at a similar time as the TRIM5-resistant group. a single amino acid mutation in its PRY-SPRY domain can confer resistance to the pathogen. the lack of TRIM5-mediated restriction in both human and macaque conventional DCs may be due to SUMOylation of TRIM5. TRIM5 has also been linked to the activity of other components of cellular innate immunity including antigen presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. mechanisms of TRIM11-mediated restriction include curbing the amount of viral reverse transcription products allowed to accumulate in the host. TRIM11 promotes premature uncoating and release of the viral genetic material, reducing transduction efficiency. the exact mechanism of TRIM11-mediated restriction of HIV-1 has yet to be determined. TRIM11 interacts directly with the capsid and probably does not require TRIM5 or other cellular proteins for promoting untimely capsid uncoating. microtubule involvement in viral uncoating has been implicated as both a host restriction and a viral propagation mechanism. TRIM22 prevents normal viral transcription events by regulating the effectiveness of the transcription factor Sp1 to bind the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter region [197] TRIM37 exhibits anti-retroviral functions through interference of HIV-1 infection, replication, and transcription, possibly interfering with DNA synthesis. TRIM21 has been shown to detect intracellular antibody-opsonized viruses. a high affinity antibody receptor, TRIM21, binds to the highly conserved Fc region of virion-bound immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, or IgA [7,202] and targets the virus for degradation by the proteasome. TRIM21\u2019s PRY-SPRY domain interacts with Fc residues conserved across mammalian species [204] recognition of the Ig-V complex in the cytoplasm by TRIM21 triggers the synthesis of unanchored K63-linked poly-Ub chains that activate NF-B, AP-1 and IRF3 pathways. TRIM21-deficient mice infected with mouse adenovirus 1 experienced lethal disease while wild-type mice were protected, exemplifying the importance of TRIM21 in viral neutralization in vivo. the TRIM25-binding domain of the viral NS1 protein prevents TRIM25-mediated activation of RIG-I. TRIM22 targets the viral nucleoprotein, while TRIM32 prevents association of PB1 to the viral polymerase complex through K48-linked polyubiquitin chains that target the viral components for proteasome-mediated degradation. TRIMs and Positive Sense RNA Viruses have also been reported to mediate restriction against Flaviviruses. the flavivirus genus comprises more than 70 viruses including a number of important human pathogens. TRIMs restrict virus replication, degrading viral proteins such as NS2A in japan encephalitis virus (JEV) by TRIM52. TRIM21 inhibits IFN- production during JEV infection. TRIM23 promotes yellow fever virus replication. TRIM14\u2019s SPRY domain specifically interacts with NS5 of HCV and induces NS5A degradation. TRIM56 may modulate post-translational modification of one or more viral proteins. TRIM56 overexpression in HEK293 cells supports some selectable HCV RNA replicons at very low efficiencies. further studies are needed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of TRIM56-mediated restriction of BVDV. restrict Langat virus (a member of the TBEV serogroup) infection by targeting the viral RNA polymerase and major IFN antagonist, NS5. NS5 inhibits IFN-/-dependent responses by preventing JAK-STAT signaling and thus suppresses ISG-stimulated gene expression. TRIM79 did not target NS5 from WNV, nor could it inhibit WNV replication. TRIM19-IV was the only TRIM from this group of eight that specifically reduced both the enhancers I and II components of HBV. this inhibition of viral transcription required TRIM41\u2019s RING and PRY/SPRY domains, implicating its E3 ligase activity. TRIM5 and Retroviruses TRIM5 are an example of a TRIM functioning as both a direct virus restriction factor as well as a pathogen-recognition receptor. TRIM5 oligomerization into a hexagonal lattice associates directly with HIV-1 capsids to promote premature uncoating. TRIM11 mobilizes cellular microtubule formation to prematurely uncoat HIV-1. TRIM19 translocates to the cytoplasm and binds Daxx to prevent its degradation by the proteasome. TRIM22 inhibits Sp1, preventing LTR-mediated transcription. one potential model may involve improved proliferation of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells. the hexagonal nets are formed from TRIM5 trimers. they are dependent on the TRIM5\u2019s B-box domain. rhesus macaque TRIM5 (rhTRIM5) can form higher-order structures upon binding to the capsid. inhibition can block disassembly and/or degradation of viral core components, it does not appear to rescue infectivity, which has led some investigators to conclude that degradation of capsid by the proteasome is not the mechanism of TRIM5-mediated restriction. however, additional studies have shown proteasomal involvement in TRIM5 restriction of HIV-1 by degrading TRIM5 itself [173] the restriction benefits conferred by TRIM5 can be observed in the progression to disease upon infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in rhesus macaques. the restriction benefits can be observed in the progression to disease upon infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) subversion of TRIMs is a central evolutionary strategy for viral innate immune evasion. human TRIM5 is incapable of restricting HIV-1, yet a single amino acid mutation in its PRY-SPRY domain can confer resistance to the pathogen. TRIM5 paralogues have been identified in bovine [184,185], ovine [186], and piscine [40] species. lack of TRIM5-mediated restriction in human and macaque conventional DCs may be due to SUMOylation of TRIM5. but this lack of TRIM5-mediated restriction in DCs provides an innate immune sensing advantage. TRIM5 has also been linked to the activity of other components of cellular innate immunity including antigen presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) TRIM11-mediated restriction include curbing the amount of viral reverse transcription products allowed to accumulate in the host. neither proteasomal nor lysosomal inhibitor treatments recovered viral p24 protein in the pellets of TRIM11 overexpressing cells. authors demonstrated a restoration of HIV-1 capsid levels in cells supplemented with exogenous TRIM11. ating has been implicated as both a host restriction and a viral propagation mechanism. functional microtubules and their associated motor proteins, like dynein, have been suggested as key components in genome release for both IAV and HIV-1 [192,193,194,195]. TRIM37 exhibits anti-retroviral functions through interference of HIV-1 infection, replication, and transcription. further investigation into TRIM-mediated transcriptional inhibition will be required to reveal additional pathways in which TRIMs play a significant role. TRIMs interfere with HIV-1 infection in human and murine fibroblasts through the reduction of reverse transcriptase products. progress on the topic ranges from revealing the isoform of TRIM5 as the restriction factor to discerning the role in restriction of each structural motif. TRIM5 oligomerization into a hexagonal lattice associates directly with HIV-1 capsids to promote premature uncoating. TRIM11 mobilizes cellular microtubule formation to prematurely uncoat HIV-1 and facilitate rapid release of the vRNA from the viral core. rhTRIM5 and TRIM5 variants from several primate species are capable of forming flexible, hexagonal frameworks encompassing HIV-1 capsid surfaces. rhTRIM5 RING dimers enhance its E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and innate anti-HIV-1 activity. proteasomal-mediated degradation of viral components is a host restriction strategy characteristic of many TRIM family proteins involved in host innate immunity. early work with proteasomal inhibitors, like MG132, suggested a two phase restriction of HIV-1 by TRIM5 by TRIM5. in the second phase, TRIM5 inhibits late RT products in the presence of a functional proteasome, suggesting TRIM5 may utilize the proteasome to disrupt the viral RT complex polyubiquitination through the E3 ligase activity of TRIM5\u2019s RING domain may also be a factor involved in inhibition of retroviral replication. multiple TRIM5 orthologs induce AP-1-mediated innate immune signaling. the preservation of CD4+ central memory T cells has been extensively characterized as important in resisting viremia and generating CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) subsets. the prolonged presence of these CD4+ T cells in the TRIM5-susceptible SIV-infected treatment may be responsible for the higher survival rate. TRIM5 plays a convergent role in the recognition and restriction of retroviruses. a lack of TRIM5-mediated restriction in both human and macaque conventional DCs may be due to SUMOylation of TRIM5 in DCs. TRIM5 has also been linked to the activity of other components of cellular innate immunity including antigen presentation. TCypA and rhTRIM5 enhanced the ability of CD8+ T cells to identify HIV-1 infected cells. the presence of these TRIM5 orthologs was associated with increased associations between HIV-1 particles and the host proteasome. TRIM11-mediated restriction includes curbing the amount of viral reverse transcription products allowed to accumulate in the host. ule dynamics inhibitors nocodazole and taxol demonstrated a restoration of HIV-1 capsid levels in cells supplemented with exogenous TRIM11. the authors demonstrated a restoration of HIV-1 capsid levels in cells supplemented with exogenous TRIM11. the exact mechanism of TRIM11-mediated restriction of HIV-1 has yet to be determined. TRIM1 (also called MID2) and TRIM18 (also called MID1) have been shown to be directly involved in microtubule stabilization. TRIM1-mediated restriction is dependent on microtubules, or whether other microtubule-interacting TRIMs may have viral restriction activity by microtubule-dependent mechanisms. TRIM37 exhibits anti-retroviral functions through interference of HIV-1 infection, replication, and transcription. PML/TRIM19 and Daxx-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 RT may be cell-type dependent. TRIM21 has been shown to detect intracellular antibody-opsonized viruses. TRIM21 binds to the highly conserved Fc region of virion-bound immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, or IgA. TRIM21-deficient mice infected with mouse adenovirus 1 experienced lethal disease while wild-type mice were protected. this suggests the association of TRIM21 with Ig-V complexes is important for triggering antiviral responses. TRIM21-deficient mice infected with adenovirus 1 experienced lethal disease while wild-type mice were protected. influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) proteins are targets of TRIM-mediated inhibition of virus replication. TRIM25 interacts with the N-terminus of IBV-NS1 preventing the viral protein\u2019s C-terminal component from binding viral RNA. TRIM56 has been proposed to target viral 5\u2019 triphosphate RNA. some members of the TRIM family have been shown to enact restriction factor capabilities through other means. the mechanism TRIM56 employs to diminish vRNA levels of both influenza viruses is currently unknown. TRIMs and Positive Sense RNA Viruses have also been reported to mediate restriction against Flaviviruses. TRIMs restrict virus replication, degrading viral proteins such as NS2A in japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) by TRIM52. TRIM79 degrades NS5 protein in hepatitis C virus (HCV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) by TRIM56. colleagues have shown that TRIM52 interacts with the NS2A protein of JEV. NS2A is a small, hydrophobic transmembrane protein involved in the virus life cycle and subversion of host antiviral responses. TRIM52-dependent inhibition of JEV NS2A protein occurs in BHK-21 and 293T cells. TRIM79 is highly expressed in the spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow. TRIM79 is required for effective restriction of TBEV replication. NS5 inhibits IFN-/-dependent responses by preventing JAK-STAT signaling. TRIM25 is capable of promoting K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitination of ZAP isoforms. but ubiquitination does not appear to affect ZAP antiviral activity. it will be of interest to elucidate what other factors may be ubiquitinated by TRIM25 that could affect ZAP antiviral activity. TRIM5 promotes the ubiquitination of Rta upon interaction, thereby blocking the EBV lytic cycle [238]. TRIMs possess diverse, situation-specific functions that have yet to be characterized. TRIM19 isoforms are able to capture varicella-zoster virus nucleoproteins to impede nuclear egress. TRIM25 interacts with coiled-coil domain of TRIM25 to impede multimerization. NS1 binding to TRIM25 leads to impaired ubiquitination of the RIG-I and downstream signaling, resulting in a reduced antiviral response. TRIM25 interacts with IAV strains isolated from many species. the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV interacts with TRIM25. it prevents the necessary interaction and subsequent ubiquitination of the RIG-I CARD domains. a similar loss of IFN- is achieved when MERS-CoV nucleoprotein associates with TRIM25. TRIM11 protein expression levels have been shown to be under the control of Vpr in a dose-dependent manner. the mechanism HIV-1 Vpr employs to antagonize TRIM11 is unknown. YFV and DENV NS5 protein have 10 amino acid residues on the N-terminus. TRIM23 was identified as an essential factor in YFV replication due to its interaction and poly-Ub of residue K6 on YFV-NS5. another flavivirus induces expression of TRIM21 in human microglial cells. TRIM21 overexpression suppressed phosphorylation of IRF3 and activation of IFN-, while silencing TRIM21 permitted efficient type-I IFN responses. TRIM6 is targeted by Nipah and Ebola viruses to enhance virus replication. EBOV inhibits type-I IFN production by multiple mechanisms. TRIM6 ubiquitinates VP35 on K309 and promotes VP35 activity. hepatitis B virus (HBV) encodes viral proteins that interfere with TRIMs. anti-malarial drug chloroquine acts as an activator for ATM by phosphorylating KAP1/TRIM28. a population of 765 HBV-infected individuals was screened. human cytomegalovirus mimics the coiled-coil domain of TRIMs to recruit and sequester TRIM19 from nuclear bodies. the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A and B virus (IAV/IBV) has been characterized as a viral antagonist of host innate immunity through interactions with TRIM25 [57,100,240,241] TRIM25 interacts with IAV strains isolated from many species. chicken TRIM25 binds only NS1 from avian strains. coiled-coil structure also binds NS1 to inhibit RIG-I signaling. compared two viral sequences (PR1 and PR-2B) and identified mutations that resulted in increased production of subgenomic flavivirus non-coding RNAs (sfRNAs) by the PR-2B strain [55]. the PR-2B sfRNAs were capable of binding to host TRIM25 and prevented USP15-mediated deubiquitination [55], which is crucial for activation of RIG-I [94] TRIM32 becomes upregulated due to the viral trans-activator of transcription protein (Tat). this upregulation of TRIM32 induces proliferation arrest in hNPCs. flaviviruses encode viral proteins that antagonize TRIM-mediated immunity. TRIM21 overexpression suppressed phosphorylation of IRF3 and activation of IFN-, while silencing TRIM21 permitted efficient type-I IFN responses in human microglial cells [53]. the study by Manocha et al. demonstrated that TRIM21 suppressed the IFN-I response due to induction of TRIM21. TRIM6 is targeted by Nipah and Ebola viruses to enhance virus replication. EBOV VP35 binds and inhibits type-I IFN production. additional unidentified ubiquitination sites of VP35 exist. in EBV, KAP1 (Kruppel-Associated Box Domain)-Associated Protein 1)/TRIM28 regulates activation of the viral lytic cycle. this post-translational modification impairs KAP1/TRIM28\u2019s restriction factor function. anti-malarial drug chloroquine acts as an activator for ATM by phosphorylating KAP1/TRIM28. the IE1 proteins of human cytomegalovirus mimic the coiled-coil domain of TRIMs to recruit and sequester TRIM19 from nuclear bodies thus impair the activation of IFN responses. the fact that TRIMs are targeted by viruses for immune evasion further highlights their important roles in protecting the host against infections. knockdown of TRIM6 in lung A549 cells has shown increased replication of multiple viruses, including IAV, EMCV, and sendai virus (SeV) despite a defect in the IFN response, infectious Ebola virus replicated less efficiently in TRIM6 knockout cells as compared to parental wild type (WT cells) TRIM6 is hijacked by EBOV-VP35 for both immune evasion and for promoting virus replication via ubiquitination of VP35. it remains to be seen if other TRIMs that are targeted by viruses may also directly enhancing virus replication via ubiquitination of viral proteins. rhesus TRIM5 directly recognizes viral capsid sequences via its SPRY domain. rhesus TRIM5 can execute precision autophagy of the HIV-1 capsid. rhesus TRIM5, but not human TRIM5, could contribute to defense against HIV-1 through precision autophagy. despite these advancements, many TRIMs have yet to be characterized. the role of TRIMs in regulating poly-Ub chain topology is also of interest. s and a few TRIM-E2 pairs were identified [272], the complexity of potential transient interactions and the possibility of cell-type specific expression for the combination of TRIMs and E2-conjugases. one question is how poly-Ub chains of unconventional linkages may affect virus replication. further studies will advance our understanding of the complexities involved with TRIM signaling. future studies will need to address whether other TRIMs, in addition to TRIM6, may be hijacked by viruses."}
