{"summary": "INFs are a family of proteins released by a variety of cells in response to infections caused by viruses. a high level of antiviral protection is achieved by IFN-, IFN- and IFN-. interferons are based on the induction and regulation of innate and acquired immune mechanisms. IFITM1, expressed in leukocytes and endothelial cells, has anti-proliferation functions and promotes homotypic adhesion (5,8,9) in many cell lines, IFITM2 could cause the cell cycle to stagnate and p53-dependent apoptosis (10). IFITM3 can inhibit the proliferation of cells (11\u201313). total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs of IFITMs were amplified by PCR using mice IFITMs specific primers. Quantitative PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 (Roche) PCR was performed in a final volume of 40 L containing 10 L SYBR Green Master I (Roche), 1 L upstream primers (10 mol/L) and 1 L downstream primers (10 mol/L), 0.4 L cDNA and 7.6 L DEPC-treated water. total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNAs from organ tissues were reverse-transcribed using mice IFITMs specific primers. PCR was performed in a final volume of 40 L containing 10 L SYBR Green Master I (Roche), 1 L upstream primers (10 mol/L) and 1 L downstream primers (10 mol/L), 0.4 L cDNA and 7.6 L DEPC-treated water. mRNA copy numbers were normalized to mRNA copy numbers of the house keeping gene, -actin to give a value Ct.

RT-qPCR primer design and screening The primers used for beta-actin (control) were 5\u2032-CCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTAT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CTGTGGTGGTGTGAAG-3\u2032 (reverse) the primer sequences of IFITMs are listed in supplementary Table S1 and used in our study.

IFITM5 and IFITM10 were highly expressed only in esophagus, trachea, skull, bone, eye, ear, hair and skin. in smooth muscle, IFITM5 expression was significantly higher in pancreas. interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a family of small transmembrane proteins belonging to the ISG superfamily. they are the distinct restriction factors known to block viral entry. gene cluster IFTIM1, 2, and 3, the immune-related genes, are critically involved in immune defense against a broad variety of viruses. FITM5 is related to calcium deposition in bone. it is inconsistent with previous studies that IFITM5 was only expressed in bone. expression profile of IFITM10 is similar to that of IFITM5. mRNA expression profile of IFITMs in different tissues was systematically compared and analyzed in rats. next, we will analyze the protein expression profile of the IFITM family members."}
