{"summary": "patients present with diarrhea or difficulty breathing, or they may have a fever accompanied by hypotension. the symptoms are broad and diverse, and the empirical response is to treat for everything. cocktails of antibiotics are given even when the cause may be viral or fungal. physicians could test for the 20 most common agents causing acute respiratory infection. results were available in about 1 h at a total cost that was less than the cost of a single send-out PCR test. the results provided the opportunity to limit the time in the ED, omit antibiotics if the agent was viral, and treat patients on an outpatient basis. in the 12-month period from October 2013 to September 2014, 87% of the tests ordered were RESPAN and 13% were FLUPCR. during the months of high flu activity, physicians ordered more FLUPCR, and during the months of low flu activity, they ordered mostly RESPAN. of great interest are the positivity rates for the two tests. acute respiratory tract infections accounted for 219 per 10,000 ED visits from 1996 to 2010 in the united states (1). acute respiratory tract infections accounted for 219 per 10,000 ED visits from 1996 to 2010 in the united states (1). there were 1,550 per 10,000 physician office and hospital outpatient department visits from 2002 to 2010 (2). syndromic panels should be offered as the only choice when respiratory illness testing is desired. a compelling reason for detecting other viruses is patient satisfaction. a rapid diagnosis of the patient's illness goes a long way toward meeting our institution's goal of providing quality outcomes that lead directly to patient satisfaction. the finding of Enterovirus in respiratory specimens was possible only because the sentinel hospitals were using molecular multiplex respiratory virus panels for routine testing in the clinical microbiology laboratory. the ability to exclude known viruses may help to more rapidly recognize and identify the presence of a new pathogen, such as MERS-CoV. based on the known etiologic agent Reduction in pharmacy cost due to less antibiotic usage Reduction in laboratory costs due to less need for additional follow-up tests. additional diagnostic assays and determination of antibiotic peak and trough levels Reduction in collateral side effects from antibiotics such as adverse drug reaction, Clostridium difficile infection, and adverse effects on the human microbiome. the microarray respiratory panel (RESPAN) was hugely popular but limited in terms of etiologic agents detected. the result provided the opportunity to limit the time in the ED, omit antibiotics if the agent was viral, and treat patients on an outpatient basis if the etiologic agent was known to cause a self-limited type of infection. flu season, which lasted 4 months, a combined 1,761 viral respiratory tests were performed, with only 241 (13%) positive for influenza A/B (227 influenza A, 14 influenza B) that means 87% of the patients will test negative if only the influenza A/B test is ordered. if influenza A/B only testing is ordered in our laboratory, the positivity rate averages 28%. acute respiratory tract infections accounted for 219 per 10,000 ED visits from 1996 to 2010 in the united states. acute respiratory tract infections accounted for 219 per 10,000 ED visits from 1996 to 2010 in the united states (1). difference in price between the two panels that we use at Loyola is $73.00. the additional $73.00 cost for performing the syndromic panel should not be considered a deterrent. syndromic panels should be offered as the only choice when respiratory illness testing is desired. enterovirus D68 outbreak occurred in late summer 2014. the increase in severe respiratory illness primarily in children could have been caused by many different viruses that are common during the late summer and fall. the finding of Enterovirus in respiratory specimens was possible only because the sentinel hospitals were using molecular multiplex respiratory virus panels. treatment Shorter duration of symptoms Less time out of work or school Shorter emergency room times Shorter hospital stay if admitted. syndromic, multiplex PCR panels offer the chance to have a definitive diagnosis in less than 2 h. they can be performed near the patient with minimal training and labor cost. multiplex PCR panels detect multiple pathogens that cause a common syndrome or are commonly found in a specific sample type are terrific. it is important that we carefully consider whether these tests should be front-line tests used for all patients with a syndrome or whether their use should be limited to specific patients. many of us want to offer multiplex PCR panels, but we have limited control over which pathogens are included in the panels. simultaneous testing for pathogens should be rare. the differences might be in clinical manifestations or epidemiology. the differences might be detected by rapid, accurate, and inexpensive tests. infection with Chlamydophila pneumoniae is uncommon enough that routine diagnostic testing is not recommended for community-acquired pneumonia in adults. negative test results for common pathogens should precede testing for uncommon pathogens in the interest of controlling the cost of testing for both the patient and the institution. one of the multiplex panels for gastrointestinal pathogens had a sensitivity of 48% for Yersinia enterocolitica in a recent study (4). the effects of using large multiplex PCR panels on laboratory costs and overall cost of care are not yet clear. infection with C. difficile is associated with specific risk factors. cancer chemotherapy, gastrointestinal surgery, and manipulation of the gastrointestinal tract are also risk factors for this infection. tests for uncommon pathogens should follow testing for common pathogens. a focused PCR panel that is limited to organisms of similar Gram stain morphologies is more sensible (15, 16) one could argue that the large panel would be useful for detecting a second organism that is not seen in a Gram stain. the sensitivity of two large multiplex PCR panels for respiratory viruses was approximately 85% for influenza A virus in one study. the use of large multiplex PCR panels for detection of pathogens must be guided by careful consideration of which patients will benefit from the use of these tests. the cost of testing is an important concern as well, but it is secondary and should be taken in context of the overall cost of the patient's care. tests as front-line diagnostics will depend on the clinical situation. the panel includes pathogens that are very rare. the prevalence of the pathogen will greatly affect the predictive value of the test."}
