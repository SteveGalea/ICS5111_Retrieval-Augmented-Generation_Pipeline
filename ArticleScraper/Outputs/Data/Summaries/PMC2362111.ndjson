{"summary": "oligonucleotides (ESOs) of 2'O-Methyl (2'OMe) and morpholino chemistry have been shown to restore dystrophin expression in muscle fibers from the mdx mouse. cationic copolymers of poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are considered effective agents for enhanced delivery of nucleic acids in various applications. dose-response experiments using the CG-PEI2K-PEG5K copolymer yielded a maximum of about 15% dystrophin expression. further improvements in dystrophin expression up to 20% of normal levels were found at 6 weeks after 10 injections of the NG-PEI2K-PEG550 copolymer complexed with 5 g of ESO per injection. dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal x-linked disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the 427 kDa membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. mutations are most often comprised of insertions and deletions that alter the dystrophin reading frame or encode premature stop codons. these types of mutations result in production of truncated and non-functional dystrophin that is rapidly degraded. recent studies have also documented PEI-enhanced delivery of small nucleic acid agents such as oligonucleotides and siRNA. the positive surface charge of PEI-nucleic acid polyplexes interacts with negatively charged elements on the cell membrane. the 'proton sponge effect' enabled by PEI's buffering capacity induces the rupturing of the endosome due to osmotic lysis. mdx mice were given three weekly intramuscular injections of 5 g of ESO complexed with either PEI2K(PEG550)10, NG-PEI2K(PEG550)10, or CG-PEI2K(PEG5K)10 copolymers. the results show that repeat injections of small amounts of PEG-PEI-ESO are very effective at transducing dystrophin expression, reaching up to 20% of normal levels. expression of dystrophin-positive fibers compared to muscles from un-injected mdx mice. injections with PEI2K(PEG550)10-ESO formulation produced 594 120 dystrophin-positive fibers. morphological integrity was well preserved, with no overt signs of muscle necrosis or cytotoxic damage. intramuscular injections of 5 g of ESO complexed with either PEI2K(PEG550)10, NG-PEI2K(PEG550)10, or CG-PEI2K(PEG5K)10 copolymers. the number of dystrophin-positive fibers was significantly lower in muscles injected with NG-PEI2K(PEG550)10-ESO and CG-PEI2K(PEG550)10-ES NG-PEI2K(PEG550)10-ESO and CG-PEI2K(PEG5K)10-ESO formulations resulted in only 380 36 and 322 24 dystrophin-positive fibers. both were significantly less than found with the unconjugated PEI2K(PEG550)10 copolymer. dose-response properties of CG-PEI2K(PEG5K)10-ESO polyplexes were evaluated over a range from 3\u201360 g of total ESO. muscles injected with the smallest test dosage of ESO (1 g 3 injections) expressed significantly fewer dystrophin-positive fibers than doses of 15, 30, or 60 g. ponse profile of dystrophin expression after intramuscular injections of CG-PEI2K(PEG5K)10-ESO polyplexes was obtained from whole transverse sections that were immunolabeled for dystrophin. number of dystrophin-positive fibers for each dose was significantly lower for the 1 g injections than for all other doses. the number of dystrophin-positive fibers after delivery of 10 g total ESO for 6 weeks was 2.2-fold greater than found after 15 g of ESO for 3 weeks using the same NG-PEI2K(PEG550)10 copolymer. the increased dystrophin expression following repeated injections was not associated with any overt signs of cytotoxicity. blots showed dystrophin expression in thick (60 m) transverse cryosections. dystrophin expression reached 20% of normal levels in muscles injected with 50 g of ESO. dystrophin expression after 50 g of ESO was significantly greater than the 8.1 2.8% produced with 10 g of ESO. the peak level of 23% dystrophin expression after only 10 g ESO injected over 6 weeks demonstrates the effectiveness of the nanopolymer-ESO formulation coupled with a low dose-high frequency delivery schedule. nNOS expression is absent from muscles of mdx mice and may be upregulated following exon-skipping restoration of dystrophin expression. serial whole transverse sections immunolabeled for dystrophin (A) and nNOS (B) show the correlation in ESO-mediated upregulation of both dystrophin and nNOS in the same set of fibers of the polyplex-injected muscles. nNOS expression in untreated mdx controls was negligible. injections with the PEI2K(PEG550)10-ESO formulation produced 594 120 dystrophin-positive fibers. roughly 30% of approximately 2000 fibers in the TA muscle. mdx mice were given 3 weekly intramuscular injections of various PEG-PEI copolymers complexed with 5 g of ESO. the number of dystrophin-positive fibers was significantly lower in muscles injected with NG-PEI2K(PEG550)10-ESO and CG-PEI2K(PEG5K)10-ESO polyplexes compared with the basic PEI2K(PEG550)10-ESO formulation (P 0.05, N = 4 muscles per group). dystrophin expression following three weekly injections of the PEI2K(PEG550)10-ESO polyplex (5 g ESO per injection) reached 11.2 +/- 2.4% of the level found in normal muscles. dystrophin expression in control mdx muscles was not detectable, and was likely less than 1% of normal. dose-response properties of CG-PEI2K(PEG5K)10-ESO polyplexes were evaluated over a range from 3\u201360 g of total ESO. muscles injected with the smallest test dosage of ESO expressed significantly fewer dystrophin-positive fibers than doses of 15, 30, or 60 g. western analysis showed that the highest level of dystrophin induction was achieved using 5 g of ESO per injection, resulting in 14.2 intramuscular injections of 1, 5, 10, or 20 g of ESO (3, 15, 30, and 60 g total) complexed with CG-PEI2K(PEG5K)10 copolymers, and harvested 3 wks after the first injection. number of dystrophin-positive fibers was significantly lower for the 1 g injections than for all other doses (P 0.05, N = 4 muscles per group). the number of dystrophin-positive fibers after delivery of 10 g total ESO for 6 weeks was 2.2-fold greater than found after 15 g of ESO for 3 weeks using the same NG-PEI2K(PEG550)10 copolymer. the increased dystrophin expression following repeated injections was not associated with any overt signs of cytotoxicity. blots showed dystrophin expression in thick (60 m) transverse cryosections. dystrophin expression reached 20% of normal levels in muscles injected with 50 g of ESO. dystrophin expression after 50 g of ESO was significantly greater than the 8.1 2.8% produced with 10 g of ESO (P 0.05). expression of nNOS in mdx muscles treated with PEG-PEI-ESOs. expression after only 10 g ESO injected over 6 weeks demonstrates effectiveness of nanopolymer-ESO formulation coupled with low dose-high frequency delivery schedule. previously shown that nNOS expression is absent from muscles of mdx mice [48] and may be upregulated following exon-skipping restoration of dystrophin expression. d for dystrophin (A) and nNOS (B) show the correlation in ESO-mediated upregulation of both dystrophin and nNOS in the same set of fibers of the polyplex-injected muscles. nNOS expression in untreated mdx controls was negligible. there is vigorous debate as to which ESO chemistry may work best. three weekly intramuscular injections of only 5 g of ESO complexed with the PEI2K(PEG550)10 copolymer resulted in about 600 dystrophin-positive fibers and about 11% of the normal level of dystrophin expression at 3 weeks after the initial injection. the current results suggest that PEG-PEI copolymers enhance dystrophin expression. single intramuscular injections of 10 g of PMO resulted in up to 60% of the normal level of dystrophin expression. however, these compounds appear to be somewhat less effective than PMOs. the high stability and low surface charge of these polyplexes are two salient features. polyplex stability assays in PBS showed CG and NG caused only moderate weakening of polyplex stability. a possible explanation for the lack of improvement is that the CG coating was not stable enough to adhere to the copolymer during delivery. a possible explanation for the lack of improvement is that the CG coating was not stable enough to adhere to the copolymer during delivery. mdx muscles are more susceptible to mechanical damage than normal muscle. this effect may be exacerbated by cationic particles, or for that matter, any type of carrier compound. this effect may be exacerbated to some extent by cationic particles. conjugation of multiple HIV-TAT epitopes to PEI2K(PEG5K)10 copolymers greatly improved ESO delivery, using a similar dosing and intramuscular injection regimen as reported here. this type of peptide-PEI conjugate can likely be formulated for improved systemic delivery.
