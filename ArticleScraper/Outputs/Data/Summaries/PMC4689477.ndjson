{"summary": "as of November 13, 2015, a total of 1618 cases had been reported by the world health organization. as of November 13, 2015, a total of 1618 cases had been reported by the world health organization. the mortality rate of MERS-CoV is as high as 35%, far higher than that of the SARS coronavirus. rhesus macaques develop transient clinical symptoms with histopathologically evident multifocal mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonia on day 3 post-infection. common marmosets infected with high doses of MERS-CoV develop more severe disease than rhesus macaques. kb human genomic DPP4 using the VelociGene techonology. no mortality or clinical signs of disease was observed up to day 4. transgenic mice developed severe pneumonia with multi-organ injury including liver, kidney and brain damages. expression of the codon-optimized hDPP4 was achieved by transfection of the pCAGGS-hDPP4 plasmid into Cos-7 cells, followed by confirmation of expression using anti-human CD26 monoclonal antibody. transfected Cos-7 cells were incubated with a recombinant protein expressing the RBD of MERS-CoV fused to human IgG Fc (RBD-Fc) [18]. expression of hDPP4 mRNA in the indicated tissues of transgenic mice in two founder lines by qPCR. results are meanSEM (n = 3). the primers specific for mPKD1 were forward 5\u2019 GGCTGCTGAGCGTCTGGTA 3\u2019 and reverse 5\u2019 CCAGGTCCTGCGTGTCTGA 3\u2019. samples were harvested and stored immediately in RNAlater RNA stabilization reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) for each sample, 2 g of total RNA was used as template for first-strand cDNA synthesis. mice were closely monitored by daily observation and weighing of trained animal caretaker. monitoring will raise to twice per day once mice lost more than 10% of their initial body weight. animals were deemed gravely ill and were euthanized by overdose inhalation of carbon dioxide. cytopathic effects were daily observed under phase-contrast microscropy for 3 days. viral titer in tissue was expressed as Log10 TCID50/g of tissue. expression of virus antigens and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages was detected by immunohistochemistry. ERS-CoV nucleoprotein (NP) (Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China), neutrophil marker NIMP-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Paso Robles, CA, USA) and CD68 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) the reaction was detected using a standard streptavidin-biotin detection system. the hDPP4-coding sequence was codon-optimized and synthesized. pCAGGS-hDPP4 contained the hCMV IE Enhancer (hCMVIEE), the CAG promoter (chicken -actin promoter/intron), a codon-optimized open reading frame (ORF) of hDPP4 and rabbit -globin polyA. hDPP4 expression was confirmed in vitro by transfection of cos-7 cells with pCAGGS-hDPP4 (B) or pCAGGS (C) plasmids. expression was detected by direct immunofluorescence assay with CD26\u2013Fluorescein antibody. hDPP4 DNA was normalized using a single-copy reference gene (PKD1) as an endogenous control. the primers specific for hDPP4 were forward 5\u2019 CTACAGCTCCTGGGCAACGTGCTG 3\u2019 and reverse 5\u2019 AGATGTCGTAACTGGCGGTGTAAG 3\u2019. the relative amount of hDPP4 in different tissues was obtained by normalizing mRNA expression to that of the endogenous control gene GAPDH [19]. mice under virus infection were intranasally inoculated with MERS-CoV (104.3 TCID50) in 20 l Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) mice were monitored for weight loss and survival for 12 days. RNA was quantified in a 25 l mixture containing 5 l RNA. the primers and probes specific for the upE envelope gene of the virus were as follows. the results were considered positive at CT values below 35 for primer and probe set. the viral titer in tissue was expressed as Log10 TCID50/g of tissue. histopathology and immunohistochemistry Collected tissue samples were immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, sectioned at 4 m thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. GM-CSF, KC, MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-1 and RANTES were measured according to manufacturer's protocols. p values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. in order to determine the effective infection of MERS-CoV in different lines of transgenic mice, 6 mice in each line were infected with MERS-CoV. the results showed that all mice in line 1, 2 and 3 survived with no significant changes in body weight but all mice in line 4 died by day 10 following MERS-CoV inoculation. the results showed that all mice in line 1, 2 and 3 survived with no significant changes in body weight. hDPP4 transgenic mice were infected intranasally with MERS-CoV. all of the infected mice died by day 10. symptoms of neural defects with paralysis were observed on day 9. moderate liver damage was seen in the transgenic mice infected with MERS-CoV on day 5. in spleens, necrosis of splenic cells and increased reticulum cells in red pulp was observed on both day 5 and day 9. there was no apparent damage in the intestines after MERS-CoV infection. in the kidney, hDPP4 transgenic mice showed focal interstitial inflammation with inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitium and exudates in renal tubules. on day 9, degeneration and necrosis in the renal tubular epithelial cells (inset) and focal hemorrhage were observed. strong viral antigen expression was evident in neuronal cell bodies. expression was evident in dendrites, axons and microglia in the cerebral cortex. no viral antigen expression was observed in brains of mice in sham-infected group. viral antigens were detected in type I and type II pneumocytes and infiltrated macrophages in the lungs (B-C), renal tubular epithelial cells in the kidneys (E-F), neuron cell bodies as well as in dendrites and axons in the brain (H-I) the detection limit is 1103 copies/g. inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs, liver and spleen was evaluated 5 days after MERS-CoV infection. macrophage infiltration in the lung, liver and kidney was detected 5 days after MERS-CoV (G-I) or sham infection (J-L) (n = 2). the mRNA levels of hDPP4 in the trachea, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine and brain in two of the founder lines were measured by qRT-PCR. the data showed that hDPP4 expression was higher in the trachea, lung, spleen, kidney, intestine and brain in both lines. in order to determine the effective infection of MERS-CoV in different lines of transgenic mice, 6 mice in each hDPP4 transgenic mice infected with MERS-CoV exhibited decreased activity and significant weight loss from day 6 after infection. all of the infected mice died by day 10. in the kidneys, mild interstitial inflammation with inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the interstitium and exudates of renal tubules on day 5. by day 9, more renal tubular epithelial cells were injured. in the liver, mild to moderate liver damage was seen in the transgenic mice infected with MERS-CoV on day 5. hDPP4 transgenic mice were performed using sham-infected mice as controls (A, D, G, J) in the lungs, mild inflammation was observed, with inflammatory cell infiltration (arrowheads) and focal hemorrhage and exudation (arrow) on day 5. damage was more severe on day 9, with increased inflammatory cell infiltration, focal hemorrhage and exudation. hDPP4 transgenic mice infected with MERS-CoV expressed viral antigen on day 5 after infection. no viral antigen expression was observed in the brains of mice in the sham-infected group. RNA copies in lung and brain were detectable on day 5 postinfection. no viral antigens were detected in sham-infected mice (A, D, G) but viral antigens were detected in type I and type II pneumocytes and infiltrated macrophages in the lungs (B-C), renal tubular epithelial cells in the kidneys (E-F), neuron cell bodies. deposition of hemosiderin in the spleen indicated an increase in activated macrophages. a systemic inflammatory response after virus infection was demonstrated. inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs, liver and spleen was evaluated 5 days after MERS-CoV infection (A-C) or sham infection (D-F) transgenic mice in the study died on day 6 with only progressive pneumonia and mild perivascular cuffing in brain, and no neurological disorder or other multi-organ damage was observed. hDPP4 transgenic mice experienced a longer incubation period post-infection and developed progressive pneumonia and neurological disorders. lines with lower levels of hDPP4 expressed especially in trachea had no significant clinical symptoms. renal epithelial cells may produce 1000-fold more infectious MERS-CoV progeny than bronchial epithelial cells. severe neurologic syndrome including altered level of consciousness from confusion to coma, ataxia and focal motor deficit also reported in three critically cases by balkhy H et al. the mechanism of MERS-CoV infection caused death is complex and complicated. aberrant immune response after MERS-CoV infection may be one of main reasons which need to be further studied."}
