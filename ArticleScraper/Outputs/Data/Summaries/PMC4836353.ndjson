{"summary": "several pandemics, such as the spanish flu (1918), Asian flu (1957) and Hong Kong flu (1968) caused millions of deaths in the last century. only two therapies, targeting the viral proteins neuraminidase and M2, are approved to treat influenza. novel viral or host targets for antiviral strategies are urgently needed. an essential role for TMPRSS2 in cleavage activation and viral spread was also reported for H7N9 influenza A virus (14, 15) deletion of Tmprss2 slightly reduced body weight loss and mortality in mice after H3N2 virus infection compared to those for wild-type mice but did not protect mice from lethal infections. original stocks of viruses were obtained from Stefan Ludwig, university of M\u00fcnster (A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1, M\u00fcnster variant [PR8M], and A/WSN/33 H1N1), from Peter St\u00e4heli, University of Freiburg (A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1, Freiburg variant [PR8F], and from Otto Haller, University of Freiburg (A/Hong Kong/01/68 H3N2)) s4tm1.1Hum mice were generated by interbreeding of B6.129S1-Tmprss2tm1Tsyk (13, 20) and B6.129-Tmprss4tm1.1Hum homozygous mice. mice with a weight loss of >30% of the starting body weight were euthanized. a 10-fold dilution series of homogenized lung tissue was incubated with preseeded MDCK II cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. a 1% Avicell overlay prepared in DMEM containing NAT and BSA was added and incubated for an additional 24 h. mice were infected with 2 103 FFU of H3N2 influenza A virus. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected. levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), gamma interferon (IFN-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, semiquantitative assessment of influenza virus antigen expression in the lungs was performed as reported earlier (23), with minor modifications. for the alveoli, 25 arbitrarily chosen 20 objective fields of lung parenchyma per lung slide were examined by light microscopy. the score for each animal was presented as the percentage of positive fields. QuantiGene ViewRNA probes were generated based on Affymetrix probe sets. type 6 probes (Sftpc), NM_011359 (region 2\u2013784) and type 1 probes (Aqp5), NM_009701 (region 239\u20131533) were stained with Fast red for type 1 probes. the severity of alveolitis, bronchiolitis, and bronchitis, we scored the slides as follows: 0, no inflammatory cells; 1, few inflammatory cells; 2, moderate numbers of inflammatory cells; and 3, many inflammatory cells in all alveoli, bronchioles, and bronchi of the lung slide. low-virulence mouse-adapted H1N1 virus PR8M and high-virulence mouse-adapted H1N1 virus PR8F have been described previously (18). Virus stocks were prepared by infection of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. knockout mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice for 10 generations to generate the Tmprss4/ congenic mice used in our studies. cDNA was synthesized using an RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) cDNA was synthesized using the bioscript system (Bioline GmbH, Germany) mice at the age of 8 to 11 weeks were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine-xylazine solution. survival and body weight loss were monitored until day 14 postinfection (p.i.) modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) contains 5 g/ml N-acetylated trypsin (NAT) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) after incubation, a 1% Avicell overlay prepared in DMEM was added and incubated for an additional 24 h. viral particles were detected with an anti-influenza virus antibody (Virostat) interferon (IFN-), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, IP10, KC, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP1), RANTES, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) were measured with the MCYTOMAG-70K mouse the percentage of positively staining epithelium was estimated for every slide to provide the score per animal. the slides were washed with PBS, dried, and mounted with Neo-Mount. slides were stained with Fast red for type 1 probes. type 6 probes were detected with Fast blue. slides were counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin. negative controls (antisense) were run in parallel. slides were examined without knowledge of the identities of animals. RESULTS Tmprss2 and Tmprss4 are coexpressed in alveolar and bronchial regions. in situ hybridization of lung slides from noninfected C57BL/6J lungs with probes specific for AECI (Aqp5) and AECII (Sftpc) are stained blue. Cryo-sections of lungs from noninfected C57BL/6J mice were immunostained for TMPRSS2 (red) and TMPRSS4 (blue) analogue results were obtained after infection with two additional H1N1 virus variants (PR8F and A/WSN/33) and after infection with a multibasic, mouse-adapted H7N7 virus (data not shown) no statistically significant difference was observed after infection with a lower dose (10 FFU) of H3N2 virus. mean values were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test (body weight loss) and the log rank test (survival) no significant differences in body weight loss and survival were observed between knockout and wild-type mice. weight of wild-type lungs increased significantly from days 2 to 6 postinfection. the relative number of granulocytes in peripheral blood increased to higher levels in wild-type mice. however, both wild-type and knockout mice showed similar degrees of lymphopenia during the first 2 days p.i. Homozygous Tmprss2/ Tmprss4/ knockout mice lost significantly less body weight than wild-type mice. viral loads were significantly higher in infected wild-type mice than in infected homozygous mutant mice at days 2, 4 and 6 p.i. female C57BL/6 and Tmprss2/ Tmprss4/ mice were infected with 2 103 FFU of H3N2 influenza virus. samples below the detection threshold were set to the respective detection limit. at 6 days p.i., lesions were more severe and extended over a larger area than at 4 days p.i. also, there was mild type II alveolar epithelial cell hyperplasia. however, the bronchiolar damage was less severe than that in the wild-type mice on all days. the number of positive alveolar epithelial cells increased from 2 to 6 days p.i., while the number of bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells decreased from 2 to 4 and 6 days p.i. both wild-type and mutant mice showed viral spreading into alveolar regions on day 2 p.i. mice were infected with 2 103 FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intranasal application. we performed a modified FFU assay of lung homogenates. to prevent artificial HA cleavage, the homogenates were incubated on the cells without additional proteinase. samples from mutant mice showed significantly lower levels of matured viruses than the total number of virus particles (P 0.05) no difference was detectable in samples from infected wild-type mice. data shown are means SEM for 7 replicates from two independent experiments. in situ hybridization of lung slides from noninfected C57BL/6J lungs with probes specific for AECI (Aqp5) and AECII (Sftpc) are stained blue. Cryo-sections of lungs from noninfected C57BL/6J mice were immunostained for TMPRSS2 (red) and TMPRSS4 (blue) no cross-reactivity of antibodies was observed in appropriate knockout controls. analogue results were obtained after infection with two additional H1N1 virus variants (PR8F and A/WSN/33) and after infection with a multibasic, mouse-adapted H7N7 virus (data not shown) no statistically significant difference was observed after infection with a lower dose (10 FFU) of H3N2 virus. no significant differences in body weight loss and survival were observed between knockout and wild-type mice. signs were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test (body weight loss) and the log rank test (survival) the relative number of granulocytes in peripheral blood increased to higher levels in wild-type mice. however, both wild-type and knockout mice showed similar degrees of lymphopenia during the first 2 days p.i. granulocytosis was observed in both strains on days 2 to 6 p.i. s2/ Tmprss4/ knockout mice showed significantly reduced mortality compared to wild-type mice. viral loads were significantly higher in infected wild-type mice than in infected homozygous mutant mice at days 2, 4 and 6 p.i. female C57BL/6J and Tmprss4/ mice were infected with 2 103 FFU of H3N2 influenza virus. rss2/ Tmprss4/ mice were used as mock controls. at 6 days p.i., the lesions were more severe and extended over a larger area than at 4 days p.i. also, there was mild type II alveolar epithelial cell hyperplasia. however, the bronchiolar damage was less severe than that in the wild-type mice on all days. at 6 days p.i., there were more positive alveolar epithelial cells compared to those at 4 days p.i. the number of positive alveolar epithelial cells increased from 2 to 6 days p.i. and the number of bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells decreased from 2 to 4 and 6 days p.i. mice were infected with 2 103 FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intranasal application. the ratio of processed to nonprocessed virus (HA cleavage or not) in lung homogenates was determined using a modified FFU assay without exogenous trypsin. the total number of virus particles entered cells and form foci. samples from mutant mice showed significantly lower levels of matured viruses than the total number of virus particles (P 0.05) no difference was detectable in samples from infected wild-type mice. infection with 10 FFU of A/HK/01/68 (H3N2) virus resulted in less body weight loss. however, this difference was less pronounced after infection with an increased virus dose. we investigated whether a further protease may be involved in cleavage activation of H3N2 viruses. studies have addressed the physiological role of TMPRSS4. an increased expression of TMPRSS4 was associated with increased progression and metastatic potential of several cancers. TMPRSS4 transcripts have been detected in the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon), mouse bronchiolar-alveolar epithelial cells. the more proteases are able to cleave the hemagglutinin, the faster the virus can replicate and cause illness. increased expression of TMPRSS2 leads to more severe outcomes of human disease caused by the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus or the novel avian H7N9 virus (32). TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 are able to cleave and activate the hemagglutinin of H3N2 viruses. different proteases have been shown to activate H3 viruses in vitro."}
