{"summary": "clinical diagnosis is difficult because early symptoms are similar to other common infections such as dengue, leptospirosis, and malaria. clinical confirmation is difficult because early symptoms are similar to other common infections such as dengue, leptospirosis, and malaria. eight hundred microliters of whole blood and serum were extracted using the IT 1-2-3 Platinum Path purification kit. 200 L of buffy coat was extracted using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit. two probe-based real-time PCR assays were designed for the specific detection of O. tsutsugamushi. whole blood and buffy coat specimens were tested for all adult patients. only buffy coat fractions were tested because there was insufficient whole blood/serum. sensitivity and specificity of acute specimen IgM IFA were 14.3% (95% confidence interval [CI: 0.4\u201357.9) and 97.7% (95% CI: 94.2\u201399.4) for scrub typhus, 9.1% (95% CI: 0.2\u201341.3) and 99.4% (95% CI: 96.7\u2013100) for murine typhus. seven patients had serologically confirmed acute scrub typhus infection by paired IgM IFA. of these, three patients were children and only the buffy coat fraction was tested by PCR. there was perfect correlation between results obtained from whole blood and buffy coat fractions, but none of which gave positive results. PCR was four times as sensitive as acute specimen IgM IFA. comparison of five PCR assays for detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. DNA from blood are shown in Tables 1 and 2. the clinical sensitivity was low but PCR was more sensitive than acute specimen IgM IFA. a combination of molecular and antibody-based detection assays would be the ideal panel."}
