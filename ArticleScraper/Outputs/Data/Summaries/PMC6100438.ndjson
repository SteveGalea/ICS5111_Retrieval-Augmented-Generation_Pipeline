{"summary": "natural products from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) represent a major part of today\u2019s pharmaceutical market. they possess a number of biological activities, such as antimicrobial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, cardiovascular activities, and so on. one isomer possesses a desired therapeutic effect whereas its paired enantiomer could be inactive or even have undesirable effects. the specific marker of R,S-goitrin has been used for quality evaluation of R. Isatidis and its granules. the contents of degradation products might be influenced by the procedures of traditional processing and extraction in crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules. a high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detector was adopted to develop a more efficient method for simultaneous quantification of the four chiral glucosinolates in R. Isatidis. glucosinolate profiling of 37 samples from crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis was carried out to clarify their chemical characteristics. the combination of methanol and 30 mM ammonium acetate gave an optimal mobile phase system for glucosinolates separation. in order to acquire better peak intensity, five UV wavelengths\u2014230, 242, 245, 254, 280 nm\u2014were detected and 230 nm gave the best results. the maximum absorption CD wavelength of R- and S-goitrin was focused on 195 and 280 nm, respectively, whereas the detection range of the relative purities of R-goitrin (%) and S-goitrin (%) were mixed and simultaneously determined by UV and CD to calculate the g factors. the calibration curve between g factors (X2) and the different relative purities of R-goitrin (Y2) was Y2 = 0.0092X2 + 0.4965 (R2 = 0.9970) n = 3 (Mean %) n = 9 RSD (%) Progoitrin 1.23 0.15 1.56 0.37 99.1 2.53 Epiprogoitrin 1.98 0.16 1.41 0.05 99.3 2.58 R,S-goitrin 1.24 0.53 1.21 0.82 103.3 2.89 R-goitrin 1.35 0.96 1.28 0.64 101.5 2.95 S-goitrin 1.05 0.58 2.82 1.42 99.1 2.53 the chemical composition of progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin in crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of Radix Isatidis showed that the chromatographic patterns were consistent between all 37 samples. the differences in absorption intensity between UV and CD detection might be due to the differences in chemical structures. goitrin, epiprogoitrin, R-goitrin, and S-goitrin were quantified in 37 samples using HPLC-UV coupled with CD detection. the total contents of four glucosinolates in three types of R. Isatidis were significantly different. glucosinolates occupied relatively lower contents in its granules. extraction methods could improve the biotransformation of progoitrin and epiprogoitrin, and then increase the content of the degradation products (R- and S-goitrin) this is consistent with our previous report [16,17]. however, the content dynamic change features of the glucosinolates in crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules. Q) were lower than 0.802 and 2.305 g/mL, respectively. glucosinolates Calibration Curves Equation R 2 Linear Range (mg/mL) LOD (g/mL) LOQ (g/mL) Progoitrin Y = 5.10 103X 22.43 1.0000 0.06512.084 0.583 1.885 Epiprogoitrin Y = 6.27 103X. the recoveries of five glucosinolates were measured from 99.1 to 103.3%. the RSD values were less than 3.0%. the results of precision, repeatability, and recovery were also validated. R-goitrin and S-goitrin showed same retention time, UV absorption feature, and overlapping peak. only R-goitrin could be detected in mixed R,S-goitrin, crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis. the chemical composition of progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin in crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of Radix Isatidis showed that the chromatographic patterns were consistent between all 37 samples. the three analytes could be easily detected in the UV chromatograms, while only R-goitrin was determined in CD chromatograms. R-goitrin accounted for a majority of the R,S-goitrin component in crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis; the R-goitrin content was twice as much as that of S-goitrin. progoitrin and epiprogoitrin contents showed an obvious declining trend in crude drugs and decoction pieces of R. Isatidis. R-goitrin and S-goitrin were prepared from R,S-goitrin using the Shiseido\u00ae CD-pH chiral column (5 m, 250 4.6 mm) with acetonitrile\u2013water (30:70, v/v) their chemical structures were elucidated by a series of spectroscopic and chemical analyses. the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, and the column temperature was set at 30 \u00b0C. UV and CD detective wavelengths were set at 230 nm and 280 nm respectively. the mixed solution was packed into a SPE column (Waters Oasis WAX 3cc Cartridge/ 60 mg, Waters, USA) it was activated with 3 mL water containing 2% formic acid, 2 mL methanol (A) and 2 mL methanol containing 5% ammonium hydroxide. the residue was dissolved with 0.1 ml methanol for HPLC analysis. enantiomeric content from chiral sample was measured by relative purity and UV absorbance. samples were collected from the main commercial herbal markets and different herbal manufactories in china. the purities of five glucosinolates were determined to be higher than 98.0% through HPLC-DAD analysis. acetonitrile, methanol, formic acid (98.0%, HPLC grade) and ammonium acetate (98.0%, HPLC grade) for HPLC analysis were purchased from thermo Fisher Scientific (Swedesboro, NJ, USA) the column temperature was set at 30 \u00b0C. UV and CD detective wavelengths were set at 230 nm and 280 nm. standard solutions were prepared by appropriate dilution of the stock solutions. eluted solutions of 2% formic acid, 2 mL methanol (A) and 2 mL methanol were dried by flushing with nitrogen (N2) the residue was dissolved with 0.1 ml methanol for HPLC analysis. the granules were pulverized and screened through a 300 m sieve to obtain homogeneous fine powder. the CD detector recorded both dichroic ( or A) and UV ( or A) signals at the optimized wavelength and calculated the anisotropy factor (g = / or A/A) the relative proportion of the enantiomeric in the chiral molecule was calculated."}
