{"summary": "complex networks appear at different scales and paradigms, from metabolic networks, the structural correlates of brain function, the threads of our social fabric and to the larger scale making cultures and businesses come together. these systems have been modelled and studied using network science tools giving us new insight in fields such as sociology, epidemics, systems biology and neuroscience. of the airline network21 demonstrated that the structural cohesiveness of the airline network did not arise from the high degree nodes. but it was in fact due to the particular community structure which meant some lesser connected airports had a more central role. we run simulations using a stochastic metapopulation model of influenza22 23 where the worldwide network of commercial flights is used as the path for infected individuals traveling between cities. removing selected edges has a greater impact on the spreading of influenza with a significantly smaller loss of connectivity between cities. removing selected edges has a greater impact on the spreading of influenza with a significantly smaller loss of connectivity between cities. spreading in this network can then show how a disease outbreak, e.g. H1N1 or SARS influenza, can spread around the world5 23. one city is the starting point for the epidemic and air travel between such cities offers the only transmission path. a control strategy based on travel restrictions found that travel would need to be cut by 95% to significantly reduce the number of infected population. the results showed that only on networks that preserved the original\u2019s community structure did we observe a significant reduction in infections when removing edges. betweenness centrality was the best measure even when no communities were present. Edge betweenness was best at predicting critical edges that carried the greater traffic weighted by number of passengers traveling resulting in a large reduction in infectious population. removing edges ranked using the purely structural Jaccard coefficient led to the greatest delay in reaching the peak of the epidemic. the jaccard predictor slows down spreading in networks that display a community structure. this is a good measure for these types of networks, given its good computational efficiency. the current study was testing different strategies and different percentages of removed edges. this led to a large number of scenarios that had to be tested. the network of connections between the top 500 airports is available under the resources link on our website http://www.biological-networks.org. distribution of the complete data set, including all airports and traffic volumes, is not allowed due to copyright restrictions. the non-susceptible class is determined deterministically from the daily average passenger seats on flights between cities. however, future epidemics of H5N1 and other viruses might have different. a similar model was used, but it was focused on a specific outbreak of SARS. the product of degrees of the nodes connected by the edge is high when both nodes are highly connected (hubs) for testing the absolute difference and product of degrees we also considered the opposite removal strategy (starting with lowest values) but the results showed to be consistently under-performing when compared to all other measures. two different versions of the original network were rewired. in one version only each individual node degree was maintained. for the second, the original community structure was preserved. the sub-network within each community was rewired."}
