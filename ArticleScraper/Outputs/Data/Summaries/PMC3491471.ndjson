{"summary": "the ORF1a sequences of 212 PRRSV isolates available in GenBank as of february 26, 2012 were extracted, translated, aligned, and back-translated to a nucleotide sequence alignment. the alignment was analyzed for conservation at ORF1a-synonymous sites, as described previously (14). a 169-codon ORF is present in one (LDV-P) of two published LDV sequences. in the second sequence, the ORF is disrupted by a single stop codon. this sequence is divergent from both LDV-P and LDV-C (locally 83\u201390% nucleotide identity) a highly conserved codon is CAG (Gln), UGG (Trp) or CGG (Arg) in different PRRSV isolates. we hypothesized that this motif could facilitate 2 PRF from ORF1a into the overlapping ORF. this motif is present in both LDV, all three SHFV, and 211/212 PRRSV sequences. nsp2TF is 14\u201319% shorter than full-length nsp2. the TF ORF overlaps the part of ORF1a that encodes the predicted nsp2 transmembrane (TM) domain. nsp2TF appears to encode an alternative TM domain. polyclonal Ab (pAb-TF) was raised against the C-terminal peptide of nsp2TF of PRRSV type I isolate SD01-08 (18, 19) we also used mAbs 36-19 and 58-46, raised against the N-terminal 436 amino acids of SD01-08 nsp2. expression of nsp2TF was first analyzed by immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blot analysis. the smallest product of the four proteins labeled nsp2N might derive from a 1 frameshift at the same conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence. such a frameshift would lead to an immediate termination, because there is a 1/+2 frame stop codon adjacent to the shift site. proteins from SD01-08\u2013infected and mock-infected MARC-145 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and resolved by SDS/PAGE. the gel slice containing the putative nsp2TF band was analyzed by LC/MS/MS. a synthetic version of the peptide was subjected to the same LC/MS/MS analysis. mass spectrometric analysis of nsp2TF purified from cells infected with type I PRRSV isolate SD01-08. the peptide underlined in green, which spans the shift site, is compatible with 2 but not +1 frameshifting. the peptide underlined in green, which spans the shift site, is compatible with 2 but not +1 frameshifting. the frameshifting efficiency and turnover of nsp2 and nsp2TF were investigated in a pulse-chase labeling experiment in SD01-08\u2013infected MARC-145 cells. after a 1-h pulse labeling with 35S-labeled amino acids, the incorporated label was chased for various periods (up to 24 h) proteins were immunoprecipitated with nsp2- and nsp2TF-specific Abs. nsp2-related products in PRRSV SD01-08\u2013infected cells and transient ORF1a expression. proteins were immunoprecipitated with mAb58-46 or pAb-TF. two additional nsp2-specific products migrate at around 200 kDa. these may represent nsp2\u20138 and a modified or precursor form of nsp2\u20138. the definitive identity of these products cannot be explained at this point in time, and add to the puzzling complexity of nsp2 expression and posttranslational modification. a full-length ORF1a expression vector (pL1a) was constructed. the synthesis of nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N was monitored by radiolabeling and IP. the efficiency of frameshifting was estimated to be even higher in this system than in virus-infected cells. CC1 and CC2 mutants produced nsp2 but no nsp2TF was detected. nsp2TF expression was partially or completely knocked out with mutations that are translationally silent with respect to ORF1a. nsp2TF expression was partially or completely knocked out with mutations that are translationally silent with respect to ORF1a. KO2 contains nine mutations that disrupt the frameshift site and the downstream CCCANCUCC motif. this mutant was intended to knock out the frameshift signal completely and to express only nsp2. KO1 and KO2 differ from WT by two and nine nucleotide substitutions. replication of both vSD-KO1 and vSD-KO2 is seriously impaired in MARC-145 cells. peak titers of both mutants were 50\u2013100-fold lower than those of the WT control. vSD-KO2 again displaying the larger reduction. a control labeling with nsp2-specific mAbs (36-19 and 58-46) revealed that the pAb-TF\u2013specific foci were not, or were barely, recognized by nsp2-specific mAbs. this part of nsp2TF is not accessible in these formaldehyde-fixed, Triton X-100-permeabilized cells. nsp2 and nsp2TF were expressed individually in MARC-145 cells. nsp2TF was expressed using the in-frame control sequence to mimic 2 frameshifting. in this case these foci could be labeled with both pAb-TF and mAbs recognizing the N-terminal domain. nsp2TF (or nsp2TF-containing structures) in infected cells overlapped with the staining for exocytic pathway markers (specifically intermediate compartment and golgi complex) nsp2TF is targeted not to the arterivirus replication structures but rather to an alternative intracellular destination. inspection of the +1 and +2 reading frames relative to ORF1a revealed an almost complete absence of stop codons in the +1 reading frame. this finding suggested an overlapping ORF in the +1 reading frame as a possible explanation for the enhanced conservation at ORF1a synonymous sites. at the 5\u2032 end of the conserved ORF, there is a G_GUU_UU sequence that is present in 206/212 PRRSV sequences (4/212 have G_GUU_UUC), both LDV sequences, and one SHFV sequence. we hypothesized that this motif could facilitate 2 PRF from ORF1a into the overlapping ORF. the proposed frameshift site (confirmed in SD01-08 and SD23983) is highlighted in orange. nucleotide variations in SHFV isolates krc1-2 are indicated in green. nsp2 and the TF ORF overlap the part of ORF1a that encodes the predicted nsp2 transmembrane (TM) domain. a polyclonal Ab (pAb-TF) was raised against the C-terminal peptide of nsp2TF of PRRSV-infected cells. expression of nsp2TF was first analyzed by immunoprecipitation. blot analysis was performed using anti-nsp2 mAb58-46 and pAb-TF. only the second-largest protein labeled nsp2TF was recognized by pAb-TF. the third protein labeled nsp2TF\u2032 was detected in IP using pAb-TF. a similar analysis for the PRRSV type II isolate SD23983 also revealed multiple products in the 100\u2013150 kDa range. the available SD01-08 pAb-TF did not cross-react with any of these bands, but this result was not surprising. mass spectrum of the synthetic peptide was identical to that of the peptide derived from the gel slice. the analysis was repeated for the type II isolate SD23983, for which a 2 frameshift tryptic peptide with a different sequence was predicted. this sequence was identified in mass spectrometric analysis of the presumed nsp2TF band excised from an SDS/PAGE gel. the valine anticodon is indicated by 3\u2032-CA*-5\u2032 in the schematic. the n-terminal 714 amino acids are shared with nsp2. the epitopes recognized by mAbs 36-19 and 58-64 are highlighted in gray. the amount of nsp2TF\u2032 was more stable than that of nsp2 during the chase period. nsp2N seems to be the least stable of the various nsp2 forms described here. nsp2N is the putative 1 frameshift product. several smaller nsp2-specific products were observed in the C0h sample. the prominent 90-kDa product was not detected by pAb-TF. the prominent 90-kDa product was most likely derives from internal cleavage of nsp2. the recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase expression system (19) was used to develop an assay for PRRSV 2 PRF in uninfected cells. the transient expression of ORF1a in the recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase expression system was used to develop an assay for PRRSV 2 PRF in uninfected cells. an in-frame control (IFC) was constructed in which the shift site was mutated synonymously and an extra 2 nt were inserted to force expression of the TF reading frame (G_GUU_UU to G_GUG_UUC_UU) as expected, the SS mutant produced only nsp2TF, as detected by both pAb-TF and mAb58-46. KO1 and KO2 mutants were tested in the ORF1a expression system. nsp2TF expression was partially or completely knocked out with mutations that are translationally silent with respect to ORF1a. KO2 contains nine mutations that disrupt the frameshift site and the downstream CCCANCUCC motif. mutations introduced in KO2 were found to eliminate frameshifting. a much larger amount of full-length nsp2 was produced. the resulting recombinant viruses, vSD-KO1 and vSD-KO2, were found to be viable. pAb-TF labeled specific foci mainly localizing to the perinuclear region of infected cells. this region is known to contain the arterivirus replication structures. this region also contains modified membranes that label abundantly for most of the viral nsps (19\u201321) infected cells were double labeled with pAb-TF and a PRRSV nsp4-specfic mAb (mAb54-19) (19), revealing that nsp2TF does not colocalize with viral replication structures. nsp2TF does not colocalize with the viral replication structures. 2 localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as was confirmed using an Ab recognizing an ER-specific marker protein (Fig. 7E and F and Fig. S3E) nsp2TF resembled the foci found in infected cells. in this case these foci could be labeled with both pAb-TF and mAbs recognizing the N-terminal domain of nsp2, suggesting a conformational difference between n nsp2TF knockout mutants exhibited a crippled phenotype with a smaller plaque size. expression of the cellular gene antizyme involves +1 PRF (22) in eukaryotic systems. however, when mammalian antizyme is expressed via 2 frameshifting (23) 2 PRF on CC_CUU_UUU is used in the expression of Gag-Pol in Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 (TVV1) (26, 27) for 2 PRF on G_GUU_UUU perfect re-pairing is maintained only in the A-site. the site of presumed 2 PRF in SHFV isolates HQ845737 and HQ845738 (G_GUC_UUU) also concur with the theme of perfect re-pairing in the A-site but reduced potential for re-pairing in the P-site. eukaryotic 1 PRF is stimulated by a 3\u2032-proximal RNA secondary structure (11, 13) mass spectrometry of the nsp2N band identified a peptide corresponding to the predicted C terminus of a 1 frameshift product. the identification of the nsp2N band as the 1 frameshift product was supported further by the fact that this protein was not observed upon expression of the SS mutant. this protein was not observed upon expression of the SS mutant, in which the frameshift site is mutated. betaretroviruses and deltaretroviruses also use two ribosomal frameshifts (both 1 PRF) in the expression of their Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein (32). PRRSV nsp2 is released by the autoproteolytic activities of the upstream papain-like protease (PLP) in nsp1. the nsp2TF protein adds to the complexity of functions encoded in this region of the genome. the frameshift site is located just upstream of the region encoding the predicted nsp2 TM domain. nsp2TF and nsp2TF are targeted to different locations. nsp2TF expression was prevented (mutant KO2) or a C-terminally truncated nsp2TF was produced (mutant KO1) the virus exhibited a lower growth rate and a clearly reduced plaque size. KO2 was intended to knock out frameshifting completely. modified live viruses with engineered deletions and foreign inserts were created in an attempt to generate differentiable marker vaccines. a total of 255 arterivirus nucleotide sequences in GenBank with full coverage of ORF1a were identified by applying tBLASTn (43) to the pp1a peptide sequence derived from GenBank sequences NC_001961 (PRRSV-NA), NC_001639 (LDV), NC_003092 (SHFV proteins were immunoprecipitated with mAb36-19 to detect nsp2 and nsp2TF expression in infected cells. if microscopy was conducted as described previously (19, 21) 255 arterivirus nucleotide sequences in GenBank with full coverage of ORF1a were identified by applying tBLASTn (43) to the pp1a peptide sequence derived from GenBank sequences NC_001961 (PRRSV-NA), NC_001639 (LDV), NC_003092 (SHFV) and NC_002532 (EAV) proteins were immunoprecipitated from SD01-08\u2013infected cell lysate using mAb36-19. proteins from IP were separated on a 6% SDS/PAGE gel. the gel was destained and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. growth kinetics was examined by infecting MARC-145 cells with passage 2 WT or mutant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. supernatants from infected cells were collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h p.i. many viruses have RNA genomes that are rarely larger than 30,000 nucleotides. ed ribosomal frameshifting (generally by 1 nucleotide and less frequently by +1 nucleotide) is used by many viruses, including HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and west Nile virus (4). the newly identified gene fragment, TF, is expressed via an unprecedented 2 ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are cleaved by virus-encoded proteases to produce the nonstructural proteins, such as nsp1, nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 (5). the mRNA signals responsible for directing ribosomes into the alternative reading frame were investigated by introducing specific nucleotide substitutions at key predicted positions. the mRNA signals responsible for directing ribosomes into the alternative reading frame were investigated by introducing specific nucleotide substitutions at key predicted positions. the mutant viruses replicated 50- to 100-fold less efficiently than the wild-type virus."}
