{"summary": "study was approved by the local Ethical Committee. all participants gave written informed consent. the influenza (H5N1) virus used was strain A/Hong Kong/156/97 (15) the virus stock used as challenge antigen in the hemagglutination inhibition assay was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated hen eggs. the culture supernatants were collected 48 h postinoculation. four synthetic peptides of the influenza (H5N1) were purchased from Biodesign International (Kennebunk, ME, USA) the sequence of these peptides is specific for H5-C-terminal (15 aa), H5-middle region (14 aa), and N1-C-terminal (15 aa) and for N1-middle region (16 aa) these peptides can bind different HLA-DR1 alleles. PBMC in culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine) were stimulated with influenza vaccine preparation (1.5 g/mL), UV-inactivated influenza (H5N1) (MOI 0.1) or synthetic influenza (H5N1) peptides (NA and HA) (1 g peptide/mL) for 3 days. on day 9, cells were restimulated with the same antigens. cell-mediated immunity was considered positive when the net increase was >0.2%. t0 and t1 samples for each participant were tested simultaneously to further reduce test variability. a total of 300,000 live events were acquired, gated on small viable lymphocytes. uninfected-cell wells, incubated with each test serum, were included in each well as negative controls. NT titer was assessed as the highest serum dilution in which no cytopathic effect was observed by light microscope inspection. each 0.5-mL vaccine dose contains 15 g HA of each strain in phosphate-buffered saline and excipients. Vaccine was administered intramuscularly. the influenza (H5N1) virus used was strain A/Hong Kong/156/97. the virus stock used as challenge antigen in the hemagglutination inhibition assay was propagated in the allantoic cavities. the allantoic fluid was harvested 48 h postinoculation and clarified by centrifugation. the H5-specific peptide from the middle region did not appear to bind any HLA-DR alleles. the peptide from the middle region did not appear to bind any HLA-DR alleles. cells were restimulated with the same antigens in the presence of 1 g/mL CD28 and CD49d. the frequency of IFN-\u2013producing CD4 T lymphocytes from each donor in the absence of any stimulation was used to calculate the background for each stimulation. the frequency of antigen-specific CD4 T cells for each study participant was calculated by subtracting the relative background levels at t0 and t1. ophycocyanin (APC) and phycoerythrin-Cy-7 (PE-Cy7) were combined for simultaneous staining. cells were stained as previously described. 300,000 live events were acquired, gated on small viable lymphocytes. all serum specimens were tested in duplicate, and t0, and t1 samples from each patient were assayed in the same plate at the same time. the results were scored by persons blinded to the study participant\u2019s identification. Stimulation with inactivated influenza (H5N1) virus induced a CD4 T-cell response. some CD4 T cells specific for a pool of H5 and N1 (H5/N1) peptides were also generated. preparation was observed after vaccination in 5 (donors 8, 11, 17, 26, 42) of 21 donors (23.8%). a slight increase of frequency of the vaccine preparation-specific CD4 T cells was observed in 5 (donors 9, 12, 33, 36, 40; 23.8%); a mild-to-significant decrease was observed in the remaining donors (n = 11; 52.3%). similar results were obtained when we observed the influenza virus (H5N1) (1.07% 0.47 vs. 0.14% 0.03, respectively; p = 0.0093) and H5/N1 peptides (1.19% 0.54 vs. 0.13% 0.07, respectively; p = 0.0018) the frequency of IFN-\u2013producing CD4 effector T cells was appreciable after challenge with the inactivated influenza virus (H5N1) or with the H5/N1 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were expanded in vitro in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and stimulated with inactivated influenza (H5N1) virus (B), peptide pool composed by 4 peptides from H5 and N1 (C), H5 peptides (D) and N1 peptides (E) no specific CD4 T cells producing interferon-gamma (IFN-) were observed after challenge with all but 1 study participant responded to seasonal vaccination by a rise in HI titers against vaccine preparation. one donor (21) showed high titers against the H5N1 subtype in NT. but a low HI titer against vaccine, a unique situation in the study population. effector cells were characterized for their ability to release IFN- and IL-2 cytokine expression. without stimuli, no cytokine production in CD4 T cells was detected. PBMC were challenged with antigen in vitro for 3 days. unstimulated cultures (A), CD4 T-cell response against human influenza vaccine strain preparation (B), inactivated avian influenza (H5N1) (C) and H5/N1 peptides (D) are shown in a representative donor. a nonhomogeneous pattern of responses was detected after vaccination (t1). the frequency of IFN-producing CD4 effector T cells was appreciable after challenge with the inactivated influenza virus (H5N1) or with the H5/N1 peptides (Figure 2, panel B: 1.82% of IFN-+ CD4+ T cells) the response of PB. MC from the same donor to N1 peptides was positive, whereas the response to H5 peptides was at background level. a similar pattern was observed in 4 other study participants. a similar pattern was observed in 4 other participants. human sera from the same donors were tested for HI activity against both vaccine and influenza (H5N1) preparations and for neutralization activity against influenza virus (H5N1). a 4-fold rise in HA antibody titer is considered noteworthy. after vaccination most donors showed a noteworthy rise of HI titers against vaccine preparation. at baseline (t0), all donors had a detectable level of human influenza antibodies. at t1 (black bars), 28 donors (73.6%) showed a >4 fold increase of Ab titer against vaccine preparation (HI) over t0. influenza-specific CD4-effector T cells could be generated by long-term cultures in vitro. discriminating between the CD4 T-cell response against external antigens was not possible. results obtained with the whole virus and those obtained with the H5 and N1 peptides are not in complete agreement. a high activation of specific cells at baseline (t0) was associated with a reduced specific response after vaccination (t1). people who have never been exposed to H5N1 subtype may be able to generate a cell-mediated response against the Hong Kong influenza (H5N1) isolate. a non-antigen-specific bystander response driven by activated CD4 T cells specific for heterologous antigen may contribute to so-called heterosubtypic immunity (8\u201310,12) immunity to the N1 NA from the human influenza virus cross-reacts with the avian influenza virus (H5N1) (26) cross-reactivity protects mice against infection with the avian influenza virus (H5N1) (26) cross-reactivity is targeting the N1 NA antigen. this increase was arbitrary but considered significant."}
