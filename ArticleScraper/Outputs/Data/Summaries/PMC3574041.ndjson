{"summary": "ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts of the rhizomes of Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith showed good antitumor activities. all compounds were isolated from the plant for the first time. the plant can be used to cure many diseases, such as influenza, acute and chronic pharyngitis, cancer, and migraine [3]. phoroglucinols and flavonoids are known to display a wide array of pharmacological and biochemical actions. so far the constituents with anticancer activity remain unclear. glucopyranoside (11), sutchuenoside A (12), -sitosterol (13), kaempferol-3,7-O--L-dirhamnoside (14), asiatic acid (18), 2,3,23-tihydroxy-12-oleanen-28-oic acid (19), crassirhizomoside A (20), kaempferol-3-O-(3-O-acetyl--L-rhamn rhizomes of Cyrtomium fortumei were cut into pieces and extracted with 80% EtOH (3 40 L) under reflux, 6 h for the first time, 3 h for the second time, and 1 h for the last time. the combined EtOH extracts were evaporated to dryness to yield a dried EtOH extract (424 g) the inhibitory percentage of cells was treated with 20 M or 50 g/mL of each compound or extract for 72 h. results showed that the ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts had great antitumor activity. 3.2 7.1 3.8 Ethyl acetate extract f 80.3 2.8 89.6 1.5 88.7 3.3 45.6 4.0 n-BuOH extract f 87.2 3.9 80.2 2.4 85.2 3.7 53.5 8.6 ADM 93.2 1.6 95.1 2.6 95.2 2.4 98.5 1.7 Protocate chaldehyde (1) 17.8 3.1 30.5 2.4 25.7 3.1 12.1 3.7 Woodwardinsaure methylester inhibitory percentage of cells treated with 20 M of each compound for 72 h. growth inhibition of those tumor cells was detected by MTT assay. AO is a vital dye that could penetrate the normal cell membrane [7], whereas EB will stain only those cells that have lost their membrane integrity [8]. the stained cells revealed four different types under a fluorescence microscopy. cells of the negative group (DMSO) treated with HCPT at 20 M for 24 h were stained with Hoechst 33258. the cells of HCPT treatment appeared to be compact and condensed. the results were consistent with AO/EB double staining. the appearance of apoptosis cells was detected by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI staining. these cells were treated with HCPT and PPI for 24, 48, and 72 h. the combined EtOH extracts were evaporated to dryness to yield a dried EtOH extract (424 g) different extracts solvent were then concentrated using evaporator under vacuum at 50\u00b0C to afford the petroleum ether extract (46 g), ethyl acetate (10 L 3 times), and n-BuOH (10 L 3 times) further experiments were performed on ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts to separate antitumor compounds. ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts had great antitumor activity. inhibitory ratios of PPI at 72 h after treatment were 67.1% on MGC-803 cells, 57.2% on PC3 cells, 45.8% on A375 cells and 24.8% on NIH3T3 cells. 95.1 2.6 95.2 2.4 98.5 1.7 Protocate chaldehyde (1) 17.8 3.1 30.5 2.4 25.7 3.1 12.1 3.7 Woodwardinsaure methylester (2) 47.9 9.3 33.2 2.8 41.4 5.6 15.2 2.6 PPI (3) 67.1 5.3 57.2 4.2 45.8 7.8 24.8 3.4 Physcion(5) 28.9 2.2 20.7 1.2 15.7 5.9 4.5 2.6 Ursolic acid(6) 5.7 49.6 2.3 46.8 1.1 28.9 4.3 Kampferol (17) 54.5 2.4 44.3 2.5 47.3 1.9 12.2 3.4 Crassirhizomoside A (20) 11.4 2.3 20.8 6.0 34.9 2.7 12.5 5.2 Kaempferol-3-O-(3-O-acetyl--L-rhamnopyranoside) (21) 22.6 8.0 15.6 6.1 17.8 3.3 9.9 6.1 chromatin of living cells was green with normal structure; chromatin of non-apoptotic dead cells was red with normal structure; yellow coloration of early apoptotic cells with morphous in the form of pycnosis; and orange coloration of late apoptotic cells with morphous in the form of pycnosis. green live cells with normal morphology were seen in the negative control group. the cells of HCPT treatment appeared to be compact and condensed. the results were consistent with AO/EB double staining. the results were consistent with apoptosis against MGC-803 cells. apoptosis of MGC-803 cells increased gradually in a time-dependent manner. the appearance of apoptosis cells was detected by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI staining. all compounds were isolated from Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith for the first time. the inhibitory activities of these compounds were investigated on tumor cells MGC-803, PC3 and A375 in vitro. the results demonstrated that PPI could induce cell apoptosis of MGC-803 cells. further studies of the specific mechanisms of the compound on human tumors are currently underway. the combined EtOH extracts were evaporated to dryness to yield a dried EtOH extract (424 g) the organic ethyl acetate extract (95 g) was subjected to CC on silica gel (200-300 mesh) eluted with petroleum ether-EtOAc (20/1, 10/1, 5/1, 2/1 and 1/1, v/v) fraction 5 (8 g) was applied to a silica gel H column eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (10:1 to 5:1) to yield a yellow powder (3 g) the yellow powder was purified using silica gel repeatedly, to yield Woodwardinic acid (10, 32 mg), Sitosterol-3-O--D-glucopyranoside (11, 43 mg), and Sutchuenoside A (12, 16 mg).
