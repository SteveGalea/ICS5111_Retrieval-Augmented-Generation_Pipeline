{"summary": "the genomes of influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) consist of eight RNA segments, while influenza C viruses (ICV) only have seven segments. both contain two major surface glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin (HA) which binds to sialylated host cell receptors and mediates membrane fusion. in 1981, fifteen strains of ICV were isolated from domestic pigs in china [14], which showed characters highly related to viruses isolated from humans in Japan [15, 16]. pigs have been shown to be susceptible to experimental infection with both pig and human ICVs, and the virus is able to be transmitted from the infected to uninfected contact pigs [14], suggesting that interspecies transmission of ICV between humans and pigs might occur in nature. IDV was detected in clinical BRDC samples, co-infected with bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) and Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni et al, suggesting IDV has the pathogenic potential in BRDC [23]. results show that IDV HEF is functionally and structurally similar to ICV HEF, but with some distinct characteristics. residues S57, D356 and H359 create a catalytic triad in ICV HEF esterase. the result revealed that the HEF-mut protein only binds robustly to 9-O-Ac-Sia glycan derivatives, with different relative fluorescence units (RFU) the structural formulas of the top four binding glycans are shown in Fig 1A. the HEF-mut protein displayed a good avidity to Neu5,9Ac2 ligands. red represents 2-3-ligands, red represents Neu5,9Ac2 and yellow represents other glycans. a %CV of less than 50% indicates data reliability. the H5 HA protein was used as positive control. positive hemagglutination results formed a reddish color across the well. negative results appeared as dots in the center of round-bottomed plates. both IDV and ICV HEF displayed obvious esterase activities. but both IDV and ICV HEF still retain noticeable esterase activities even at 4\u00b0C. tracheas of swine and bovine display brighter staining than that of the human trachea. the tracheas of swine and bovine display brighter staining than the human trachea. IDV HEF structure divided into three domains: receptor binding domain (R), esterase domain (consisting of E1, E' and E2 subdomains) and fusion domain (consisting of F1, F2 and F3 subdomains) both the overall structure (Fig 6A) and the structural folds of individual subdomains (Fig 6B) are remarkably similar. 25 165.30, 165.30, 165.30,, (\u00b0) 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90 0.018 0.006 0.010 0.011 Bond angles (\u00b0) 1.299 1.488 1.005 1.501 1.478 Ramachandran analysis Most favoured (%) 86.3 84.6 86.6 86.6 78.3 Additional allowed (%) 11.6 13.5 11.8 11.8 11.8 20.1 Generally allowed (%) 1.9 1.8 1.3 1.3 1.0 Disallowed (%) 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.6 *Values in parentheses are for the receptor-binding site of IDV HEF is located near the top of the HEF1 globular head in a shallow cavity. the positively-charged residue K235 of 230-helix and the negatively-charged residue D269 of 270-loop form a salt bridge interaction. surface presentations of ICV HEF binding to 9-N-Ac-Sia (D) and IDV HEF-mut binding to 9-O-Ac-3'SLN (E) or 9-O-Ac-3'SleC (C). secondary elements of the HEF receptor-binding site are labeled and shown in cartoon representation. the 9-O-Ac-Sia-1 of the receptor bound to IDV HEF displays a very similar orientation. the 9-O-acetyl group of the receptor docks into a nonpolar, hydrophobic pocket. the acetyl carbonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Y231 (ICV HEF: Y227) 9-O-Ac-3'SleC and 9-O-Ac-3'SLN bind in a cis conformation. the majority of interactions between ligands and IDV HEF are made by the 9-O-Ac-Sia-1 moiety. the glycan portion of the ligands do not make significant contacts with IDV HEF. the esterase pocket of the IDV HEF is covalently modified by the addition of a dimethylarsenic group (cacodylate ion, CAC) the 2Fo-Fc electron density map for this dimethylarsenic modified serine contoured at 1.0 sigma is represented in blue. acetyl esterase inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) is known to bind covalently to the serine in the active site of serine esterases. the covalent modification of S57 by arsenic blocked the insertion of the 9-N-acetyl group inserting into enzymatic site. in our IDV HEF structure, IDV HEF is proteolytically cleaved into the subunits HEF this monobasic cleavage site was very conserved both in ICV HEF (R432) and IDV HEF (R439). the first eight residues of fusion loop were conserved between ICV and IDV HEF sequences too. fusion peptide inserts into a cavity composed of different HA protomers. the fusion peptide is exposed away from the cavity. IDV HEF uses 9-O-Acetylated-Sia as its receptor. the ectodomain of HEF from D/OK strain was cloned. we used a more extended array with broader and paired (Neu5Ac- or Neu5Gc-based, and 2\u20133 or 2-6-linked) 9-O-Ac and non-O-Ac-sialoglycans. the IDV HEF-mut protein did not bind to the glycan array with synthetic short glycans at all. bars represent the standard deviation (SD) of the mean value. %CV of less than 50% indicates data reliability. both the IDV and ICV HEF-mut proteins display binding activities. positive hemagglutination results formed a uniform reddish color across the well, whereas negative results appeared as dots in the center of round-bottomed plates due to erythrocytes sedimentation. Fig 3. Receptor binding activity of HEF protein was assayed by MDCK cell based ELISA. both IDV and ICV HEF retain noticeable esterase activities even at 4\u00b0C. this may explain why wild type HEF proteins do not show hemagglutination activity or receptor binding activities clearly. the apical surfaces of the human, swine and bovine trachea showed positive staining with ICV HEF-mut and IDV HEF-mut. the tracheas of swine and bovine display brighter staining than that of the human trachea. the E domains are the most conserved regions and display root mean square differences (RMSDs) on main chain C atoms at 0.396, 0.390 and 0.435 for E1, E' and E2, respectively, with corresponding sequence identities of 66.7%, 68.8% and 56.6%. the F3 subdomain shares 56.8% sequence identity but the RMSD reaches 1.445. 40 (2.49\u20132.40) 50.00\u20132.20 (2.28\u20132.20) 50.00\u20133.10 (3.21\u20133.10) R merge 0.114 (0.524) 0.121 (0.769) 0.092 (0.596) 0.093 (0.565) 0.079 (0.858) I / I a 19.8 (4.9) 15.5 (2.6) 24.5(3.4) 25.2 (5.0) 23.30 (2.40) Completeness (%) 100.0 (100.0) 99.4 (100.0 IDV HEF (PDB code: 1FLC), the trimer is colored gray; for IDV HEF, one HEF protomer is colored by domain separately. fusion peptides are shown in yellow. the receptor-binding site of IDV HEF is located near the top of the HEF1 globular head in a shallow cavity. five base residues F127 (C HEF: Y127), W185 (C HEF: L184), Y231 (C HEF: Y227), F229 (C HEF: F225) and F297 (C HEF: F293) form a salt bridge interaction. 9-N-Ac-Sia (D) and IDV HEF-mut binding to 9-O-Ac-3'SLN (E) or 9-O-Ac-3'SleC (C) are labeled and shown in cartoon representation. the secondary elements of the HEF receptor-binding site are labeled and shown in cartoon representation. c-Sia-1 of the receptor bound to IDV HEF displays a very similar orientation. the 9-O-acetyl group of the receptor docks into a nonpolar, hydrophobic pocket. the acetyl carbonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Y231 (ICV HEF: Y227) IDV HEF shares a conserved esterase pocket with ICV HEF. most interactions between ligands and IDV HEF are made by the 9-O-Ac-Sia-1 moiety. glycan portion of the ligands do not make significant contacts with IDV HEF. the 2Fo-Fc electron density map for 9-N-Ac-Sia is represented in blue. the dimethylarsenic modified S57 contoured at 1.0 sigma is covalently modified. this modification is only observed in the wild type HEF structure. another serine esterase inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) is known to bind covalently to the serine in the active site of serine esterases. this was demonstrated as the active-site serine in the acetylesterase of ICV. the first five amino acids of HEF2 were IFGID (S3B\u2013S3F Fig), the same with ICV HEF. the exposed fusion peptide has also been observed previously in the HEF protein of ICV [35]. a dozen of novel strains have been isolated from both pigs and cattle. strains that are distantly related to human ICV have also been found to be susceptible to the virus. this finding is similar to the structural similarity observed between HAs of IAV and IBV. a better understanding of the ecological, evolutionary and molecular mechanisms of IDV is essential to explain the broader host and cellular range of IDV. both ICV and IDV HEF proteins can bind to the trachea of human, swine and bovine. we have described the structure of IDV HEF and found it to be highly structurally and functionally similar to ICV HEF. previous work has shown that there exist two discrepancies at the extremely conserved non-coding regions of seven RNA segments. the non-conserved non-coding regions adjacent to each coding region are significantly variable. gene of the HEF from baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1 was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) in-frame with an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide for secretion. codons for the esterase catalytic residues S57, D356 and H359 were substituted by site directed mutagenesis. both wild type and enzymatically inactive (with S57A, D356A and H359A mutations) ICV HEF (C/Johannesburg/1/66) protein (NCBI accession no.AM410041, amino acid residues 1\u2013597 after deletion of the signal peptide) were expressed and purified in the same as that of HEF-D/OK. all crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after a brief soaking in reservoir solution with the addition of 17% w/v PEG 1500. the X-ray diffraction data were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) beamline 17U, with a wavelength of 1.000 angstrom, at a temperature of 100K. glycan microarrays were fabricated using epoxide-derivatized slides. slides were blocked by ethanolamine, washed and dried. slides were then fitted in multi-well microarray hybridization cassette. the plate was washed with PBS twice and fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol for 20 min.
