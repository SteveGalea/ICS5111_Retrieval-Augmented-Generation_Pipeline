{"summary": "coronaviruses are large, enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense, non-segmented RNA genomes. betacoronaviruses can be further subdivided into four phylogenetic groups. emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) generated considerable interest in the biodiversity, genomics, evolution, natural hosts and potential inter-species transmission of coronaviruses. 118 rectal swab samples from Rousettus leschenaulti bats sampled in china were screened for the presence of coronavirus RNA. of these, 47 (40%) samples were found to be coronavirus positive. however, our attempts to isolate the virus using a number of cell lines were unsuccessful. sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene indicated that the newly identified virus was likely to be a novel coronavirus according to previously proposed criteria. the virus was tentatively designated as Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1. Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was most closely related to Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains [18] with 66.6% - 67.4% nucleotide identities. a small intact ORF with 276 bases embedded between the N and NS7a genes was the most striking feature of the genome. the p10 protein was encoded by the first ORF of segment S1 of avian and bat fusogenic orthoreoviruses [20], which are double-stranded segmented RNA viruses belonging to the family Reoviridae. this ORF was provisionally marked as p10 according to the molar weight of protein that it encoded.

NS7a, NS7b and NS7c shared 29% - 53% amino acid identities with the accessory genes of Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains and other related bat coronaviruses. the encoded protein exhibited 30% - 54.9% amino acid identity with the p10 protein encoded by the first ORF of segment S1 of avian and bat fusogenic orthoreoviruses.

GenBank accession numbers: NC_009021, EF065514, EF065515, EF065516, HM211098, HM211099, HM211100, HM211101. to determine the evolutionary position of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1, the RdRp, S, N and p10 proteins were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. a strikingly different phylogenetic pattern was observed in the distinctive p10 protein (Fig 3), in which the Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 sequences were clearly related to bat (Pteropine) originated orthoreoviruses. these viruses are clearly more closely related to the bat-origin than avian-origin orthoreoviruses. the integrity and continuity of context sequence surrounding the p10 gene were confirmed with specific primers. the sequence obtained covers, without interruption, the partial N gene, the whole p10 gene and partial NS7a gene. the core sequence of 5\u2019-ACAAAC-3 exhibited a single nucleobase difference to the consensus core sequence (5\u2019-ACAAAC-3\u2019) we also observed a 97 nucleobase sequence between the TRS and the p10 initiation codon (Fig 4B and S2 Fig), which was much longer than the intervening sequences of other genes. the location of TRS in the p10 gene could be discriminated from those of other genes. nine potential subgenomic mRNAs of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 were depicted. each lower subgenomic mRNA shared the same 3\u2019-end structure with the upper one to comprise a 3' co-terminal nested set with the genome. the genome is represented by a black line; ORFs. arrow on each lane is the specific amplicon of each subgenomic mRNA. other marked bands are amplicons of upper subgenomic mRNAs. the bias of the TRS of p10 gene is highlighted with a yellow block. the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 is functional despite the orthoreovirus origin of p10. the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was transiently expressed in BHK-21 cells as well as the p10 gene of Pulau virus, which was used as a positive control. motifs present in the ectodomain (HP, hydrophobic patch; CM, conserved motif), endodomain (PB, polybasic) and the central transmembrane domain (TMD) are depicted with yellow rectangles. the two cysteines in the ectodomain form an intra-molecular disulfide bond. observation of syncytium formation with recombinant plasmid of p10 gene. recombinant plasmid of p10 subgenome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 and empty pcDNA3.0 vector. p10 subgenomic mRNA identified in the samples confirmed p10 gene could be transcribed from the genome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. p10 protein of GCCDC1 may have the same origin as those of fusogenic orthoreoviruses. no cell syncytia were observed for all mutant constructs of p10. p10 protein was found in bat feces and rectal swab specimens. coV GCCDC1 contains a p10 protein located at the 3\u2019-end of the genome. it appears to have captured from a bat-origin orthoreovirus by heterologous recombination. however, it is also possible that coronaviruses are one of the few virus families that can experience heterologous recombination. the biggest difference between fusogenic and nonfusogenic orthoreoviruses is the presence/absence of a small protein encoded by the segment S1 of the genome. the FAST proteins are the only known nonenveloped reovirus fusogens that can mediate cell-to-cell, but not virus-cell, membrane fusion to induce the formation of syncytia [20], and which might promote the dissemination of virus among cells [37]. the p10 protein enhances the transmission potential of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1. previous studies of the potential recombination revealed the pivotal role of the shared HE gene for the pathogenesis of betacoronavirus group A. compared to nonfusogenic orthoreoviurses, fusogenic orthoreoviruses can cause severe pneumonia when infecting humans. a similar situation may be observed at the cleavage sites of replicase polyprotein of human coronavirus HKU1 and human coronavirus NL63. a similar situation may be observed at the NSP13/NSP14 cleavage sites of replicase polyprotein of human coronavirus HKU1 and human coronavirus NL63. the

untranslated region (3\u2019-UTR) were defined, and the leader sequence, the leader and body TRSs were illustrated, based homologous sequences of orthoreoviruses were used as the background data set in the phylogenetic analysis. all amino acid sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [53] and all poorly or ambiguously aligned regions were removed using GBlocks [54] because of the short length of the p10 and N amino acid sequence alignments, more relaxed GBlocks parameters were used in these cases. each tree was inferred using the maximum likelihood method available in the forward primers targeted the leader sequence at the 5\u2019-end of the complete genome and the putative subgenomic mRNAs. reverse primers were designed within the ORFs or downstream of the corresponding gene. specific amplicons, that matched the expected length, were purified and then cloned into the pMD-18T vector for sequencing. the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 most likely originated in an orthoreovirus. the p10
