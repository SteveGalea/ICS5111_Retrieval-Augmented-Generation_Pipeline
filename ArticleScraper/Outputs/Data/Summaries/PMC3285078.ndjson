{"summary": "study arms were wearing a facemask and practicing intensified hand hygiene (MH group), wearing facemasks only (M group) and none of the two (control group) adherence was good for adults and children. study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT00833885) results suggest household transmission of influenza can be reduced by use of NPI, such as facemasks and intensified hand hygiene, when implemented early and diligently. in weeks 4-6 after recruitment, it was hypothesized that the effect of interventions may be more pronounced in the case of an influenza pandemic. the pandemic of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 there was a considerable amount of uncertainty if or which NPI should be recommended. children were defined as persons aged less than 14 years, adults were at least 14 years old. each participating physician received a list of random numbers with the interventions represented in a 1:1:1 ratio. participants were given their box by the physician's assistants. all participating households received general written information on infection prevention. study personnel visited the household no later than 2 days after symptom onset of the index case. participants of the MH and M groups asked to wear masks at all times. all participants self-recorded symptoms (fever, shivering, measured temperature, cough, sore throat) in a daily monitoring questionnaire. primary outcome measure for secondary cases was qRT-PCR confirmed influenza infection. samples were collected by using virus transport swabs (MastaswabTM; MAST Diagnostica, Reinfeld, Germany) samples were stored refrigerated (at a temperature of approximately 5\u00b0C) before analysis. RNA was extracted using either the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral Nucleic Acid Small Volume Kit (Roche Applied Science), Mannheim, Germany. the intention-to-treat analysis was done by intention-to-treat. we used Student's t-test and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis. only data from season 2010/11, (iii) only data from households with full implementation of intervention 36 h after symptom onset of the index case, (iv) only data from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases, (iv) only data from households with full implementation of intervention 36 h after symptom onset of the index case. children were defined as persons aged less than 14 years, adults were at least 14 years old. each participating physician received a list of random numbers with the interventions represented in a 1:1:1 ratio. intervention material was given to the study sites in closed boxes marked only with the randomisation number. study personnel visited the household no later than 2 days after symptom onset of the index case. participants of the MH and M groups were asked to wear masks at all times. a \"timely\" antiviral therapy started within 2 days of symptom onset. primary outcome measure for secondary cases was qRT-PCR confirmed influenza infection. a secondary outcome measure was the occurrence of ILI as defined by WHO [11] as fever plus cough. participants of the MH groups also recorded daily adherence with facemasks. swabs were collected by using virus transport swabs (MastaswabTM; MAST Diagnostica, Reinfeld, Germany) samples were stored refrigerated (at a temperature of approximately 5\u00b0C) before analysis. RNA was extracted using either the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral Nucleic Acid Small Volume Kit (Roche Applied Science), Mannheim, Germany. the intention-to-treat analysis was conducted by intention-to-treat. we used a cluster bootstrapping technique for the calculation of 95% confidence intervals. we calculated odds ratios (OR) for the outcome \"laboratory confirmed influenza\" the per-protocol-analysis was conducted in the same way as the intention-to-treat analysis but only with data from participants who had followed the assigned interventions. results Participants Initially recruited 111 households which were randomised into one of the three intervention groups during the two study periods in 2009/10 and 2010/11. in 2009/10 randomisation occurred significantly earlier after symptom onset compared to 2010/11 (p = 0.004) and a higher proportion of households was visited within 36 h (p = 0.04). all other variables did not differ significantly between the two study seasons. 17 (24) 2/15 (13) 0 Symptoms: Fever/Chills - n/n (%) 13/13(100) 11/11(100) 17/17(100) 15/15(100) 11/11(100) Cough - n/n (%) 12/13 (92) 11/11(100) 16/17 (94) 16/17 (94) 14/15 (93) 10/11 (91) Sore Throat - n/n (%) 4/13 (31) 6/11 15-43) Age 14 years - n/n (%) 6/36 (17) 8/31 (26) 6/39 (15) 13/46 (28) 8/38 (21) 6/28 (21) Sex male - n/n (%) 18/36 (50) 15/31 (49) 17/39 (44) 21/46 (46) 19/38 (50) 16/28 (57) in 2010/11 the MH group had markedly different SAR in A (H1N1) pdm09 households.

Symbols represent the mean frequency of hand disinfection before (green, hollow circles) and after (black squares) the intervention was fully implemented. a per-protocol analysis showed comparable results of lowered influenza transmission in both intervention groups (M, MH) and for both case definitions (laboratory confirmed and clinical) the main drawback of the study was that we did not reach the number of households we had aimed and planned for. Donnelly et al. quantified the probability of a transmission event by an infectious person relative to the onset of symptoms. merely 18% of transmission events took place more than two days after symptom onset of the index patient. two further cluster-randomized household studies failed to see any significant effects of intervention measures. the second study failing to see an effect of NPI in the household setting comes from Bangkok, Thailand. 90% of index patients slept in the same bedroom as their parents without wearing facemasks during the night. in our study adherence to both interventions was good. adherence data in all studies were based on self reporting and differences in reporting behaviour may have influenced results. increased use of or willingness to use preventive measures, such as facemasks or hand hygiene, was also documented during the pandemic season 2009/10. study suggests masks may be more effective for inward than for outward protection. a further limitation is the fact that laboratory testing was only conducted for the virus subtype the index patient was infected with. results of this study contribute to evidence that NPI may be effective in preventing transmission of influenza in households. prerequisites include early implementation of the intervention and good adherence. authors declare that they have no competing interests. the final manuscript can be found here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/12/26/prepub Acknowledgements This work was financially supported by the german Federal Ministry of Health. the funding source had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."}
