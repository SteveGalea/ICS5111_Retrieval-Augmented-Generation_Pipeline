{"summary": "skeletal muscle is the largest contributor to mass in domestic animal. skeletal muscle is therefore directly related to meat production. embryonic myogenesis is a crucial process for increasing muscle mass. iTRAQ is a reliable and accurate technique for quantitative analysis in proteomics study (Wiese, 2007). this technique uses stable isotopically-labeled molecules that can be covalently bonded to the N-terminus and side chain amines of proteins. this technique has been increasingly applied to investigate the proteome in different organisms. chicken embryo sexes were identified by PCR amplification of the CHD1 gene. leg muscles of female Xinghua chickens in three different development stages were used for iTRAQ analysis. total proteins were extracted by using a urea lysis buffer. iTRAQ data analysis The MS/MS data were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer software v1.4 (Thermo Scientific), and search in the Uniprot database. only unique peptides were used for protein quantification and normalization on protein medians was used to correct experimental bias. the results were filtered based on a Fisher Exact statistic methodology. the GO biological network was assessed using the ClueGO of Cytoscape software. protein-protein interaction analysis was performance by String v10.0. oride membrane was blocked in 5% BSA blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies. protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. animal experiments carried out in compliance with animal care protocols. iTRAQ assays Two female chickens of each stage were used for iTRAQ assays. total proteins were extracted by using a urea lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, and 1% SDS) total proteins were quantified using a BCA Assay Kit. iTRAQ data analysis The MS/MS data were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer software v1.4 (Thermo Scientific), and search in the Uniprot database (Gallus gallus). only unique peptides were used for protein quantification and normalization on protein medians was used to correct experimental bias. cluster analysis was performed to identify expression patterns of differentially expressed proteins using hcluster (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hcluster/0.2.0). Differentially expressed proteins were compared with the differentially expressed mRNAs, to identify proteins consistently expressed at the RNA and protein levels. protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. the LC-MS/MS data analysis generated a total of 58,815 match spectra, 19,659 peptides and 15,495 unique peptides. proteins as classified into three main categories by GO analysis. the left y-axis indicates the percentage of a specific category of genes in that category. the x-axis indicates the percentage genes within that specific category. the top 10 GO enrichment terms for differentially expressed proteins were analysed using ClueGO of Cytoscape software. the top 10 biological processes were analysed using ClueGO of Cytoscape software.
