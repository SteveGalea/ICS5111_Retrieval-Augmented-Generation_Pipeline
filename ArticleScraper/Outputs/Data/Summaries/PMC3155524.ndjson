{"summary": "methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is among the most important nosocomial pathogens of bacteremia in the intensive care unit (ICU) worldwide, including Taiwan. since 1997, our neonatal ICUs had become endemic for MRSA. MRSA becomes endemic in most hospitals around the world [1] [2] and accounts for 40\u201360% of all healthcare-associated S. aureus infections. a \"search and destroy\" strategy was recently proposed and implemented in some hospitals of different countries, with inconsistent effects. there are three NICUs, distributed on 2 floors, in this children's Hospital. there are 17 and 20 beds in NICU-1, and NICU-2, respectively. all the healthcare-associated infections in three NICUs from 1999 to 2007 were prospectively collected and recorded according to the standard definition of HAIs. nurses checked the insertion site frequently and changed the dressing every 3 days. the PICC lines were not impregnated with antibacterial or antiseptic agents and antibiotic lock prophylaxis was not used. from august 2005 to July 2006, we implemented the \u201csearch and destroy\u201d strategy into NICU-1 and -2. nearly 90% of the colonized infants are detected within the first 2 weeks of admission and sampling of both nares and umbilicus is adequate for surveillance cultures in this population. selection and genotyping analysis of MRSA isolates Specimens for surveillance culture were obtained with a cotton swab, placed in a transport medium, and then processed in the microbiology laboratory within 4 hours. for years 2006 and 2007, all the clinical isolates were molecularly characterized since less than 40 clinical isolates per year were identified. Statistic analysis We compared MRSA colonization and subsequent infection between the infants with and without topical mupirocin traetment. healthcare-associated infection density and MRSA HAI density from 1999 to 2007 were analyzed by mantel-Haenszel Chi-square test. standardized operation procedures for the insertion and the continuous care of peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) were revised, aiming to accelerate the placement process (by a designated team) and improve the aseptic care over the insertion site. from august 2005 to July 2006, we implemented the \u201csearch and destroy\u201d strategy into NICU-1 and -2. from august 2005 to July 2006, we learned that nearly 90% of the colonized infants are detected within the first 2 weeks of admission. intranasal mupirocin treatment was applied to the nares of each HCW with MRSA colonization. collection, selection and genotyping analysis of MRSA isolates Specimens for surveillance culture were obtained with a cotton swab. two isolates were considered to be indistinguishable, related, or distinct if they had the same subtype, the same genotype, or a different type. statistical analyses of the data were performed with mantel-Haenszel Chi-square test.
