{"summary": "pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) are two different stages of a same disease process. Sudden death is the initial clinical manifestation in almost 25% of PE patients. PE is the third leading cause of death ranking after coronary heart disease and stroke. autoimmune disease, immunosuppressant usage or arterial thrombosis were excluded from this study. the controls were selected from the healthy outpatients. simple infection (simple infection group) from the hospitalized patients and 82 healthy outpatients (control group) from tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji University were enrolled in this study. the diagnosis of PE patients is in accordance with any two of the following principles: 1) selective pulmonary artery angiography showed pulmonary arterial obstruction or filling defect. Statistical analysis Epidata 3.1 was applied for double entries. all analysis was carried out with SPSS14.0 software (IBM corporation) s. 2, 3 and 4) P (2 vs. 3) P (3 vs. 4) P (2 vs. 4) Case number 82 95 68 44 Gender (male) (n/%) 27/32.9 54/56.8 27/39.7 22/50.0 0.010 0.031 0.283 0.451 Age 64.2 15.3 69.7 17.2 64.9 14.6 66.8 18.5 0.124 0.061 0.559 0.367 Smoking (Yes 0.307 0.109 CD3+ 71.0 7.2 61.6 12.6 63.6 13.5 64.6 13.8 0.001 0.343 0.700 0.212 CD4+ 39.9 7.2 34.6 12.5 37.1 11.0 34.1 10.4 0.001 0.182 0.155 0.828 CD8+ 28.0 6.1 24.4 8.9 22.4 9.6 23.3 8.6 0.001 0.180 0.621 0.504 CD4+/CD8+ 1.49 0.48 1.70 1.03 2.15 2.0 there were no significant differences of levels of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD4+/CD8+ ratios in both VTE group and VTE with infection group. the normal range of CD3+ T lymphocyte is 60-85%; CD4+ T lymphocyte 24.5-48.8%; CD8+ T lymphocyte 18.5-42.1%; and CD4+/CD8+ ratio 1.02-1.94%. the percentage of increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio was similar to the percentage of declined CD4+/CD8+ ratio (Table 2). compared with control group, the proportion of increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio was similar to the percentage of declined CD4+/CD8+ ratio. the levels of HsCRP in VTE group, VTE with infection group and simple infection group were significantly higher than that in control group. there were no significant differences of age, BIM and drinking among four groups (P > 0.05). 0.001 0.279 0.035 Alcohol (Yes, n/%) 13/15.9 13/13.7 5/7.4 7/15.9 0.392 0.203 0.153 0.728 History of HBP (Yes, n/%) 0 32/33.7 28/41.2 16/36.4 0.001 0.328 0.611 0.757 History of DM (Yes, n/%) 0 22/23.2 10/14.7 8/18.2 0.001 0.180 0.625 0.507 SBP 122.6 1.03 2.15 1.81 1.73 0.003 0.061 0.367 0.615 Footnotes: HBP = high blood pressure; DM = diabetes mellitus; SBP = diastolic blood pressure; HR = heart rate; BMI = body mass index; CRP = C-reaction protein; VTE = venous thromboembolism. compared with control group, levels of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased significantly (P comparisons of the proportions of low, normal and high CD values between three disease groups and control group showed significant differences. in VTE group, there were 25 cases with abnormal CD3+ values (23 cases increased and 2 cases declined), 17 cases with abnormal CD4+ values (10 cases increased and 7 cases declined), 27 cases with abnormal CD8+ values (2 cases increased and 25 cases declined) and 42 cases with abnormal CD4+/CD8+ ratio (30 cases increased and 12 cases declined), the increased rate reached 44.8%.
