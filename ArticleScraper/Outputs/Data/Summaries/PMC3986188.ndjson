{"summary": "the human IgH and kappa light chain (IgK) variable sequences were introduced via stepwise insertion of 13 large compound bacterial artificial chromosome (LC-BACvecs) into mouse ES cells. resulting mice bred to create multiple versions of VelocImmune mice with progressively larger fractions of the human germ-line Ig repertoires. the sizes of the B220+ IgM+ mature B-cell populations in all versions of VelocImmune mice were virtually identical to those of WT mice. the mice with only three human Vh segments showed a defect in pro-B to pre-B transition in the bone marrow. mice were stained for surface IgM expressing B cells (A and B), surface Ig containing either kappa or lambda light chains (C) or surface IgM of specific allotypes (D); populations are separated by FACS. mechanisms for establishing and maintaining allelic exclusion have not yet been fully elucidated. the ratio of cells expressing humanized vs. WT mouse allele is greater than the ratio of the number of variable segments contained in the humanized vs. WT loci. this finding may mean that there is a fraction of B cells, but not all, in which one allele becomes accessible for recombination, completes the process, and shuts down recombination before the other allele becomes accessible. mice containing randomly integrated IgK transgenes with inactivated mouse lambda loci show significantly increased lambda/kappa ratios (21), implying that the introduced IgK transgenes do not function well in these previous-generation HumAb mice. we therefore examined various stages of B-cell differentiation by flow cytometry. no major defects were observed in B-cell differentiation in any of the VelocImmune mice. the introduction of at least 18 human IgH variable segments does not appear to affect either the pro-B to pre-B transition or the pre-B to B transition. locImmune mice have increased number of mutations relative to nave sIgM+ B cells that have been antigen selected. sigG+ B cells from nonimmunized mice exhibit many more nucleotides relative to sIgM+ B cells from same splenocyte pools. corresponding amino acid sequences from human heavy chain variables regions exhibit significantly higher numbers of mutations in IgG vs. IgM and even more in immunized IgG. similar increase in number of nucleotide and amino acid mutations is seen in the kappa variable sequences derived from IgG+ B cells from immunized mice. a defect in B-cell development or function may be exhibited as an alteration in the structure of the lymphoid tissues. there is no significant difference in appearance of secondary lymphoid organs between the mice. levels of various Ig isotypes in serum were analyzed using Luminex technology. une mice exhibit a wide range of affinity in binding to antigen in solution. one of these high-affinity IL6R blocking antibodies is currently undergoing clinical testing in humans. more than 10 other VelocImmune-derived antibodies are currently undergoing clinical testing in humans. da loci remain intact in all versions of the VelocImmune mice described here. chimeric loci with human variable segments and mouse constant regions can fully populate the mature B-cell compartment. mice with randomly integrated fully human Ig transgenes and inactivated mouse Ig loci had reduced numbers of B cells in these compartments. this was the first indication that the \u201cin situ genetic humanization\u201d strategy used for generating VelocImmune mice seemed to result in a fundamentally different functional outcome than previous KO-plus-transgenic approaches. the humanized IgH locus is expressed in 30% of the B cells in V1 (VelocImmune 1: 18 human VH segments, 16 human Vk segments) heterozygotes and 50% of the B cells in V2 (39 human VH, 30 human Vk) and V3 (80 human VH, 40 human Vk) heterozygotes. randomly integrated human Ig transgenes compete poorly with WT mouse Ig loci (15, 42, 43), further supporting the notion that the functional outcome using the VelocImmune approach is much different from that obtained using prior KO-plus-transgenic approaches. however, VelocImmune mice all possess WT mouse lambda light chain loci; therefore, it is possible to observe whether rearrangement and expression of humanized IgK loci can prevent mouse lambda expression. the pro-B to pre-B-cell transition requires the successful rearrangement and expression of functional IgH protein. movement from the pre-B to mature B stage is governed by the correct rearrangement and expression of a kappa or lambda light chain. no major defects were observed in B-cell differentiation in any of the VelocImmune mice. the sequence results were analyzed using V-Quest (44) to identify human VH, DH, JH, and VK, JK segment use. the human variable segment 7\u201381 has been identified in the analysis of the human IgH genomic locus sequences. sIgM+ or sIgG+ B cells from nonimmunized mice were compared with their germ-line variable segments. mutations leading to amino acid changes were also annotated. the resulting nucleotide sequences were translated in silico. non-template-encoded nucleotide additions (N-additions) are observed at both the VH-DH and DH-JH joint in antibodies from VelocImmune mice. the end points of the VH, DH, and JH segments relative to their germ-line counterparts indicate that exonuclease activity has also occurred. serum Ig levels in WT (white bars) or VelocImmune mice (gray bars) for IgM and IgG isotypes (A), as well as IgA (B) and IgE (C). mice mounted strong Ab response toward the IL6R with similar titer ranges. new projects in which megabases of genomic sequences can be precisely introduced into the mouse genome can now be undertaken for the first time. mice with randomly integrated human Ig transgenes (hIgTGx mice) have produced several high-affinity fully human monoclonal therapeutics with great promise for treating important diseases (1, 16, 48, 49) the increase in efficiency in generation of fully human antibodies in VelocImmune mice is likely to dramatically increase the diversity of fully human antibodies that can feasibly une IgH locus maintains the two mouse IgH enhancers, the intronic enhancer (50) and the 3\u2032 enhancer (25), in their native location. hIgTGx IgH transloci rely on human versions of these elements (16, 23) or a combination of human and rodent elements (22) that may not contain the entire 3\u2032 enhancer sequence. the immediate utility of VelocImmune mice is evident by the more than 10 different fully human antibody therapeutics. these mice are perhaps the most valuable ever engineered, already having brought in more than $2 billion in committed licensing fees and collaboration revenues. cytometric analysis was carried out using standard methods and commercially available reagents (SI Materials and Methods) Variable region use and junctional diversity were assessed by sequencing cDNAs derived from splenocyte or hybridoma RNA. seven VelocImmune mice were immunized with the extracellular domain of the IL6R."}
