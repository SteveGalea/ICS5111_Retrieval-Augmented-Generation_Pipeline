{"summary": "the human astrovirus (HAstV) exploits signaling cascades to establish an infection in host cells. recent studies showed that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is important for HAstV infection. HAstV type 1 (HAstV1) is the most prevalent of the eight known HAstV serotypes in patients with gastroenteritis. the viral genome encodes two non-structural proteins, nsp1a and nsp1ab, and a structural protein, the viral capsid protein. nsp1a and nsp1ab polyproteins catalyze their own proteolytic processing to produce functional viral proteins, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway regulates diverse cellular activities, including cell growth, proliferation, survival, apoptosis, metabolism, migration, and vesicular trafficking. phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway regulates diverse cellular activities, including cell growth, proliferation, survival, apoptosis, metabolism, migration, and vesicular trafficking [13]. kinases (MAPKs) include extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in the ERK1/2 pathway, signal is transduced by activated receptor tyrosine kinases, the small G protein Ras, Raf, and MAPK/ERK kinase1/2 (MEK1/2), which then activate ERK1/2 through phosphoryl caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV1 in the presence or absence of each kinase inhibitor. the presence of the inhibitor was maintained until 24 hours post-infection (hpi) the cells were detected for viral capsid protein by immunofluorescence. Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV1 in the presence of various kinase inhibitors, LY294002 (50 M; panels A and a), wortmannin (1 M; B and b), Triciribine, (10 M; C and c), wortmannin (1 M; B and b), wortmannin (1 M; B and b), Triciribine, (10 M; D and d), wortmannin (1 M; B each pair of panels shows staining patterns for the viral capsid protein (A through G) and for cellular DNA (a through g) the absorbance of the cell culture medium was measured at 450 nm. the vertical axis indicates arbitrary unit divided by the mean value of a solvent-only (DMSO) control sample. the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased at 8 hpi (Figure 2A, right \u201cpERK\u201d). this is unlikely to be related to any infection event because phosphorylated ERK1/2 was similarly elevated at this time point. lysates prepared at designated time points from HAstV1-infected Caco-2 cells were subjected to Western blot for either total ERK (ERK) or its phosphorylated form (pERK) digital images of the bands were quantitated using ImageJ. wortmannin is only stable for a few minutes in the cellular environment [20], making the PI3K-inhibiting effect more apparent in a treatment that lasted 24 h. PI3K and MAP kinase pathways are known to crosstalk through small GTPases such as Ras and Raf1 [21,22] phosphorylation level of Akt in HAstV1-infected cells incubated with LY294002, wortmannin, triciribine, or MK2206 for 24 h showed that all but triciribine treatment effectively blocked the phosphorylation of Akt. phosphorylation of Akt is also known to be targeted by PI3K activation. inhibitors of PI3K, Akt, or Rac1 were added at 0, 2, or 8 hpi. the proportion of cells positive for viral capsid expression was examined by immunofluorescence. PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin did not block viral gene expression at any time point. treatment with wortmannin could show inhibitory effect on viral capsid expression. but it did not translate into a significant effect on viral RNA replication. treatment with triciribine, NSC23766, or Y27632 induced higher levels of RNA replication. the level of viral capsid antigen in the post-infection culture supernatant was measured using ELISA. the mean capsid antigen level for each drug treatment was further converted to a value relative to mock treatment. kinase inhibitors triciribine and MK2206 exhibited a contrasting effect. kinase inhibitors showed some inhibitory effect on extracellular viral RNA accumulation. the same drugs that inhibited the viral capsid expression also inhibited viral capsid accumulation in the culture supernatant. the same drugs that inhibited the viral capsid expression also inhibited viral capsid accumulation. the presence of the inhibitors was maintained until 24 hours post-infection (hpi) the cells were detected for viral capsid protein by immunofluorescence. DMSO did not interfere with viral gene expression. Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV1 in the presence of various kinase inhibitors. each pair shows, for the same field of cells, the staining patterns for the viral capsid protein (anti-HAstV, A through F) and for cellular DNA (DAPI, a through f). the absorbance of the cell culture medium was measured at 450 nm. the vertical axis indicates arbitrary unit divided by the mean value of a solvent-only (DMSO) control sample. the mean value obtained using three of each sample is presented as bar graph. the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased at 8 hpi. this is unlikely to be related to any infection event. phosphorylated ERK1/2 was similarly elevated at this time point. digital images of the bands were quantitated using ImageJ. the vertical line indicates the relative value of the signal intensity divided by the value of the band for each mock-infected sample, at 0.25 hpi, in each experimental group. the black and gray bars represent values for the mock-infected sample, respectively. PI3K inhibitors on HAstV1 infection may have led to the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. phosphorylation level of ERK in the presence or absence of a PI3K blocker was analyzed by Western blotting. we then asked whether known downstream targets of PI3K signaling, such as Akt, play a role in HAstV1 infection. incubated with LY294002, wortmannin, triciribine, or MK2206 for 24 h. all but triciribine treatment effectively blocked the phosphorylation of Akt. PI3K activation occurs at an early stage of infection. ly294002 and wortmannin were effective in diminishing viral gene expression only when added at 0 or 2 hpi. neither PI3K inhibitor was effective at 8 hpi. blockade of Akt had little effect on HAstV1 infection. treatment with triciribine, NSC23766, or Y27632 induced higher levels of RNA replication. these results support the idea that PI3K activation is important for the initiation of viral infection via a non-Akt, non-Rac mediated pathway. d antigen in the post-infection culture supernatant was measured using ELISA. the mean capsid antigen level for each drug treatment was further converted to a value relative to mock treatment. kinase inhibitors on the release of viral RNA, indicative of virion release, from the cell. the same drugs that inhibited the viral capsid expression also inhibited viral capsid accumulation in the culture supernatant. Wortmannin also lowered the level of extracellular capsid protein, consistent with its lowering of extracellular viral RNA. PI3K and ERK signaling appears to function during an early phase of HAstV1 infection, from viral cell entry to the initiation of viral gene expression. both PI3K and ERK signaling appears to function during an early phase of HAstV1 infection. treatment with wortmannin showed no blockade of RNA replication, but exhibited a block in viral release. wortmannin treatment showed no blockade of RNA replication, but exhibited a block in viral release. treatment with triciribine enhanced viral RNA replication in HastV1-infected cells. a marked increase in the phosphorylated Akt level was observed in cells treated with each drug (Additional file 1). Akt activation is known to involve a feedback loop activating Rac1, led by ROCK inhibition using Y27632 [24]. inhibition of another member of the Rho-family, Rac1, could also have activated such a feedback loop. ERK signaling has been shown to be important in the mobilization of receptors for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [28]; in viral gene expression for respiratory syncytial virus [29], human cytomegalovirus [30], and in viral genome replication for the influenza virus [32] and mouse hepatitis virus [33]; in viral assembly for HCV [34]; in viral assembly for HCV [34]; and in viral release from host cells for Born a previously unknown role of PI3K in establishing HAstV1 infection and PKA on viral production. Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV1 at approximately 100 viral particles per cell. the culture supernatant was collected 2 days after infection. cDNA was amplified using viral cDNA-specific primers. amplification proceeded through 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 s. annealing at 62\u00b0C for 20 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 20 s. HAstV1 stock was pretreated with 10 g/mL trypsin IV (catalog no. T4799; Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the mixture was then applied to the cells along with trypsin at approximately 100 particles per cell. incubation at 4\u00b0C for 1 h did not substantially alter the infectious events seen when incubating at 37\u00b0C. 3766 and MK-2206 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA) all drugs were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) initial drug concentrations were selected after consulting the following references: staurosporine [41], genistein [42], U0126 [19,43], SB205830 [19], JNK inhibitor II [44], LY294003 [43], approximately two hundred cells were counted in at least three different areas. the proportion of HAstV1 capsid-positive cells within the counted cells was used for statistical analysis. a cell proliferation assay kit is based on the cleavage of a tetrazolium salt by mitochondrial dehydrogenases. three rabbit antibodies from the Phospho MAPK family antibody sampler kit (catalog no. 9910S), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182; clone D2F9), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2; clone 137 F5), or anti-p38 MAPK (clone 56G8), or anti-p38 MAPK (clone 56G8) were used in all cases. signal RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) a fixed amount of total RNA was used for quantitation of viral RNA. the viral RNA was quantified using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) blocking solution for 1 h at 37\u00b0C followed by incubation with an HRP-colorimetric substrate (TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate System; catalog no. 50-85-05; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) the colorimetric reaction was stopped using TMB Stop Solution (catalog no. 50-85-05; KPL) the absorbance was measured using a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader. Viral RNA was extracted from each sample of the viral preparations using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the extracted RNA, along with a known amount of standard HAstV1 RNA, was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the Superscript III system (Invitrogen) cDNA was amplified using viral cDNA-specific primers. infection with 100 particles per Caco-2 cell yielded approximately 20% of the cells positive for anti-HAstV1 antibody at 24 hpi. from this value, the multiplicity of infection was calculated to be approximately 0.22. HAstV1 stock was pretreated with 10 g/mL trypsin IV (catalog no. T4799; Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C.
