{"summary": "coronaviruses are a large family of ancient and diverse RNA virus pathogens that infect many mammalian and avian species. host receptor-adapting evolution of coronavirus spike proteins has been extensively studied (3\u20136) but coronavirus-driven evolution of host receptors is much less well understood. MHV can cause enteric, respiratory, or brain infections in mice. coronavirus S1-NTDs have the same tertiary structural fold as human galectins (galactose-binding lectins) bovine coronavirus S1-NTD recognizes sugar (15, 16) whereas bovine coronavirus S1-NTD has kept its original sugar-binding lectin activity, MHV S1-NTD has evolved novel mCEACAM1a-binding affinity. a dysfunctional Ceacam1 gene leads to impaired insulin clearance, abnormal weight gain, and reduced fertility (22) our previous structural studies of mCEACAM1a and its complex with MHV S1-NTD have delineated detailed interactions between mCEACAM1a and MHV S1-NTD. previous studies identified the CC\u2032 loop (loop that connects -strands C and C\u2032) in mCEACAM1a. mCEACAM1b[D1,D4] (residues 1\u2013202) without the membrane anchor or the intracellular tail was expressed and purified as previous described for mCEACAM1a[D1,D4] (15). it was subsequently crystallized in space group P3121, a = 113.1, b = 113.1, and c = 64.4. alignment of mCEACAM1b[D1,D4] and mCEACAM1a[D1,D4] is similar to that of mCEACAM1a[D1,D4] but the structural similarity is uneven in different regions of the two. in mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b, the two Ig-like domains, D1 and D4, are arranged in tandem without any significant interactions with each other. in mCEACAM1a, the D1 domain binds to MHV S1-NTD, whereas the D4 domain has no contact with MHV S1-NTD. mCEACAM1a is in black, and mCEACAM1b in yellow. VBMs in mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b are in blue. mCEACAM1a is in black, and mCEACAM1b in yellow. mCEACAM1b has undergone significant structural changes in loop CC\u2032. residue 38 is a threonine in mCEACAM1a but a proline in mCEACAM1b. a number of residues in other VBM regions of mCEACAM1a also form critical interactions with MHV S1-NTD. structural comparisons of mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b in MHV-binding loop CC\u2032. mCEACAM1 residues are in green, and S1-NTD residues are in magenta. hydrophobic interactions are indicated as arrows, and hydrogen bonds are indicated as dotted lines. structural and residue changes include replacing loop CC\u2032 in mCEACAM1a with its counterpart from mCEACAM1b. a pseudovirus entry assay was performed where a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the MHV spike protein was used to enter mammalian cells expressing either wild-type or mutant mCEACAM1a on their surface. mutant mCEACAM1b molecules contain single mutations R47H, M54K, F56T, Q59P, or loop CC\u2032 from mCEACAM1a (residues 38\u201343) the mutant mCEACAM1a molecules contain loop CC\u2032 from mCEACAM1a (residues 38\u201343), loop CC\u2032 and strand C\u2032 from mCEACAM1a. structural and residue changes were introduced into mCEACAM1b. these changes include replacing loop CC\u2032, strand C\u2032, loop C\u2032C\u2032\u2032, and strand C\u2032\u2032 in mCEACAM1b with the corresponding regions from mCEACAM1a. the results showed that all of the structural and residue changes introduced into mCEACAM1b significantly enhanced the pseudovirus entry efficiency. coronaviruses have evolved a variety of strategies to recognize different host receptors for host range expansion and cross-species infections. one of these strategies would be for coronaviruses to steal a host galectin, which became the S1-NTD of the coronavirus spike protein. MHV S1-NTD has evolved novel binding affinity for mCEACAM1a protein, which greatly enhanced the infection efficiency of MHV in mouse cells. mice homozygous for Ceacam1b are highly resistant to death from MHV infections. selective pressures that drive the evolution of mammalian Ceacam1 genes could come from several sources. mouse CEACAM1a is not a receptor for those bacterial pathogens that use human CEACAM1 as the receptor (42) the current study reveals the altered conformation of loop CC\u2032 in the crystal structure of mCEACAM1b. this study identifies residue variations in several other MHV-binding regions in mCEACAM1b that render mCEACAM1b a poor MHV receptor. these regions include -strands C\u2032 and C\u2032\u2032 and loop C\u2032C\u2032\u2032. mCEACAM1b[D1,D4] containing a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed in sf9 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies) the protein was harvested and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, eluted from the Ni-NTA column with imidazole. the protein was stored in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 10% PEG4000 (v pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid encoding MHV spike protein was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with helper plasmid psPAX2 and reporter plasmid pLenti-GFP. 48 h post-transfection, the produced pseudovirus particles were harvested and inoculated onto the HEK293T cells expressing mCEACAM1a or mCEACAM1b (wild type or alphaScreen nickel Chelate Donor Beads and alphaScreen protein A acceptor beads were added to the mixture at final concentrations of 20 g/ml. the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and protected from light. the structure of mCEACAM1b[D1,D4] was determined by molecular replacement using mCEACAM1a[D1,D4] as the search template. the model was built using Coot (44) and refined with Refmac (45) to a final Rwork and Rfree of 0.216 and 0.273, respectively. 300 nm MHV S1-NTD with a C-terminal His6 tag was mixed with 30 nm mCEACAM1a or mCEACAM1b (wild type or mutant) with a C-terminal human IgG4 Fc tag. the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and protected from light. crystallization of mCEACAM1b[D1,D4] was set up using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. 1 l of protein solution added to 1 l of well buffer containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.2, 10% PEG4000 (v/v), and 1 m NaCl at 20 \u00b0C. mCEACAM1b[D1,D4] appeared in 2\u20133 days and were allowed to grow for another 2 weeks before they were harvested the expression levels of mCEACAM1a and mCEACAM1b in HEK293T cells were measured by Western blotting using antibodies against their C-terminal C9 tag. the experiments were further repeated twice, and similar results were obtained. mCEACAM1b[D1,D4] containing a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed in sf9 insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies) the protein was harvested and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, eluted from the Ni-NTA column with imidazole. the protein was stored in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 10% PEG4000 (v pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid encoding MHV spike protein was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with helper plasmid psPAX2 and reporter plasmid pLenti-GFP. 48 h post-transfection, the produced pseudovirus particles were harvested and inoculated onto the HEK293T cells expressing mCEACAM1a or mCEACAM1b (wild type or OptiPlate-96 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was read in an EnSpire plate reader. the experiments were repeated twice, and similar results were obtained."}
