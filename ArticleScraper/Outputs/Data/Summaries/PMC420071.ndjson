{"summary": "the eighth annual Toronto Critical Care Symposium was held from 30 October to 1 November 2003 in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. this year's meeting was in excess of 900 people and included disciplines of medicine, nursing, respiratory therapy and other allied health care professionals. the topics of this year's meeting included sepsis, organ donation, blood conservation strategies, acute lung injury and ethics. Judith Stein drew distressing distinctions between the private and public sectors' ability to deal with crisis in any form. she paralleled the private sector response to the 9/11 terror attacks in the united states with the public sector's ability to deal with the crisis. Donald Low (University of Toronto) presented a further review on the outbreak in Toronto. he is an integral member of the local, provincial and international effort to control the spread of this disease. he was truly on the 'front lines' during the crisis in Toronto. high-risk procedures combined with the high-risk SARS patient require extraordinarily strict precautions and the use of full protective equipment. the rationale for leukoreduction is to minimize exposure to transfused leukocytes, which can lead to adverse transfusion reactions. the use of pediatric phlebotomy tubes in adults and having closed arterial line systems to reduce wastage are viable options that have been shown to significantly reduce blood loss from phlebotomy [7,8]. a large multicenter trial is underway to look at the effectiveness of some of these simple measures to reduce transfusion. a value greater than 70 g/l might be reasonable in patients with ischemic heart disease, with 80 g/l a possible threshold. end-of-life care Deborah Cook presented 'Predictions and end of life decisions in the ICU' 80% of inhospital deaths occur in the pediatric or neonatal ICU. in pediatric hospitals 80% of inhospital deaths occur in the pediatric or neonatal ICU. there is minimal evidence-based literature about end-of-life care in children. a forum sponsored by the Canadian Council for Donation and Transplantation (Severe Brain Injury to Neurological Determination of Brain Death) was held in Canada in April 2003 to reach a national consensus on optimal management of patients with severe brain injury. in the united states the concept is one of whole brain death, in the united kingdom it is one of brainstem death, and finally in canada there is no clear distinction between whole brain death versus brainstem death. ancillary test must demonstrate absence of intracranial blood flow to diagnose brain death. ancillary test must demonstrate absence of intracranial blood flow to diagnose brain death. nosocomial infections affect about 30% of patients in ICUs. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a significant problem in industrialized nations. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a significant problem in industrialized nations. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a significant problem in industrialized nations. the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics can lead to increased resistance, cost and toxicity. the use of bronchoscopy to help diagnose VAP has been shown to alter the amount and types of antibiotics used, but the effect on mortality is questionable. the disease is most prevalent in the northeastern united states. the highest incidence occurs in august and September. there has been a gradual westward progression of the disease. the administration of ethyl pyruvate has been shown to successfully modulate the inflammatory response in humans. other potential modulators of HGMB1 include an anti-HGMB1 monoclonal antibody and a recombinant segment (box A) of HGMB1 [39]. the analogy of hibernation applies to the animal kingdom, but can be appreciated in the phenomenon of 'hibernating' myocardium. cellular shutdown leading to organ failure may thus just be an adaptive response or a 'last-ditch' effort at organ preservation. mechanical ventilation The session surrounding mechanical ventilation began with the discussion of lung recruitment. the effectiveness of modalities to reverse this injury depends on timing, the nature of the lung injury and the approach used. 'the chest wall vs. the abdomen' was the subject presented by Antonio Pesenti (Ospedale S. Gerardo, Monza, Italy) he described the physiological interaction between the abdomen and the chest wall during the respiratory cycle. a reduction in cell death was noted in the lung protective strategies in this animal model. both biochemical and biomechanical injury to the lungs causes the release of a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, complement and neutrophils. these mediators in turn may lead to MOF and contribute to the morbidity and mortality beyond the initial lung injury. neurally controlled ventilators would have the timing and possibly the magnitude of ventilatory assistance controlled via a neural input from the patient. asynchrony between the patient and the ventilator is common in the critically ill. this often leads to ineffective ventilation, to ventilator-related complications. the absence of systemic corticosteroids, the lack of acquired illness during the ICU stay and the rapid resolution of lung injury were associated with higher functional levels at 1 year. herridge's results challenge us to expand the role of the ICU physician as an advocate for patient care during their convalescence. topics included medical errors, sedation, team building, management of cardiac failure and specific pediatric critical care issues. the topics debated were lung protective strategies, nontherapeutic ventilation and genomics."}
