{"summary": "microbiota coexists with human cells in very different niches, ranging from the vast surface of the skin, the populous gastrointestinal tract and even within blood vessels and organs of healthy individuals [7, 8]. microbiota normally poses no harm to its animal host as the majority of its microbes form a symbiotic relationship with it, often as commensals and rarely as parasites [11]. just the bacterial fraction of the human gut microbiota contains over 3.3 million different bacterial genes in its repertoire [7], exceeding that of the human genome by some 150-fold. viruses are considered potentially pathogenic obligate intracellular parasites with an infectious phase, devoid of a proper metabolism, which contain protected DNA or RNA molecules. virions are released after bursting the host cell, effectively starting a new infectious cycle (lytic cycle) or as temperate viruses integrating their DNA into the genome of the host or as a plasmid, rather than killing the host directly. at the global scale, viruses have a significant impact on ecology and evolution. phage-mediated genetic exchanges can transcend the species and even the genus barrier as more viruses are now known to have a broader host range, spanning different bacterial taxonomic groups. a significant fraction of the virome remains largely uncharacterized due to the predation of cellular organisms by viruses. viromics is the latest example of the impressive adaptability of virology. the 20th century saw the rise of virology, greatly owing to viral culturing techniques developed in the first half of the century. viromics is the latest example of the impressive adaptability of virology. viral cultures became a major staple in the emerging field of virology. they would allow viruses to be reproduced safely and in sufficient quantities to study, as well as for morphologic and molecular characterizations assisted by electronic microscopy. the development of sequencing technologies during the second half of the 20th century ignited another lively period for virology. new classification was based on the genetic variation of highly-conserved rRNA gene sequences (rRNA profiling), effectively separating the domain Archaea (originally Archaeabacteria) from the earlier Eukarya-Prokarya taxonomic dichotomy established by Roger Stainer and Cornelius van Neil in 1962 [49] techniques for rRNA profiling can provide an approximate evaluation of the taxonomic divergence between different related organisms. the advent of sequencing technologies would bring a much needed update to viral classification methods, which had historically been morphology-based or host-dependent [34] by the end of the 20th century. new scientific advances managed to overcome the need to culture microbes, a crippling constraint that had become a major challenge for microbial ecology. enzymatic and immunologic assays were the only reliable culture-independent diagnostic tools for viruses. a new type of bacteria formed exclusively by a non-culturable group of small, carbon-oxidizing bacteria comprise around 25% of all plankton. the metagenomic era had finally arrived and the idea of most habitats being sterile or populated by only a few microorganisms was discarded. microbial ecologist Forest Rohwer published the first whole genome sequence (WGS) metagenomic survey of uncultured communities in 2002. the group obtained a 873 Mbp clone library and managed to assemble the resulting sequencing reads into contigs. over 65% of all sequences found no homologs (\u2018hits' with database sequences) at the time, suggesting much of the viral diversity was still uncharacterized. viromics has always been heavily reliant on DNA sequencing and consequently, most environmental assays had been focused on the DNA fraction of viromes. the virus was found by screening a cDNA library obtained by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with random primers using sequence hybridization. a culture-independent analysis of viruses to picornaviruses and related viruses was published in 2003. a sequence directed RT-PCR was carried out on the environmental samples. the sequences were used to identify new viral families similar to picornaviruses. eukaryotic viral fraction in their viromes was mostly populated by plant-infecting RNA viruses such as TMV and Pepper mild mottle virus. the virome does not appear to become established by transient genera present in food as individuals following equivalent diets do not acquire a similar viromic configuration. a new batch of high-throughput sequencing techniques gave rise to the second generation of automated sequencing platforms (next-gen platforms) halfway through the 21st century, a new batch of high-throughput sequencing techniques gave rise to the second generation of automated sequencing platforms (next-gen platforms), ultimately democratizing metagenomics. in 2006, Edwards and collaborators published a novel high-throughput sequencing study reporting the metagenomic analysis of natural mine water and sediment populations taken from over 700 m below ground in Minnesota. they procured over 70 Mbp worth of metagenomic sequences for functional profiling after carrying out a whole genome amplification approach using a rolling circle amplification protocol. in metagenomes about 1 in every 105 bases matched a 16S rRNA gene. a massive 6.3 Gbp metagenomic dataset was published in 1991. the 454 platform was developed by chemists Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman. it was initially slow because earlier iterations of the platforms were only suitable for genomic resequencing due to short read output. emPCR is carried out on target DNA and beads are held in microwells. ion sensors then record small fluctuations in pH resulting from the biochemical reaction of adding new nucleotides. the second generation of sequencing platforms helped establish metagenomics as the burgeoning field it is today. viromics was the last successor in a long lineage of culture-independent approaches arising in the latter half of the 20th century. however, the field faces several unique methodological, ecological and conceptual challenges that represent key limitations to this day. viruses are polyphyletic, viromic-level phylogenies are often unreliable. viromics thus rely on the WGS framework which is commonly dependent on sequence assembly. this derives in additional challenges such as formation of chimeric contigs, underrepresented fragments and species. viromics relies on WGS methodology and inherits the corresponding challenges posed by large datasets produced by high-throughput sequencing. RNA viruses comprise a significant fraction of the virome that is often ignored as it specifically requires retrotranscription of the RNA to cDNA. the most patent examples are possibly microfiltration, which retains large viruses, and the multiple displacement amplification protocol. a large fraction of viral diversity remains uncharacterized and no reference sequences are available for most species. viromics is still a largely unexplored field, resulting in the lack of adequate reference sequences for identification. taxonomic divisions in viruses do not always hold a biological or phylogenetic significance. structurally similar viral proteins can have varying evolutionary origins. this occurs because of the two-way HGT that occurs between some viruses and their potentially interchangeable cellular hosts. over 3.3 million genes were reported to comprise the human metagenome, totaling over 150 times those in humans, 99% from bacteria. they also defined a core set of species common to most individuals, with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes proving to be the dominant phyla. microbial species diversity was found to be highly variable. the gut and the oral cavity presented the highest microbial complexity. eukaryotic dsDNA viruses were found in 92% of the individuals. the human microbiota shows a complex nature of interconnected species displaying different dynamics, which are better understood as a system. external stimuli such as the introduction of new species can alter its composition and abundance, as well as ecological drivers such as infection by local viruses (phages) or changes in nutritional intake. ence established by complementing organisms reduces fitness of the system. coyte and collaborators reported cooperating networks were unstable. microbiota interacts directly with its host, as a healthy microbiota contributes to homeostasis by providing functional redundancy. the concept of the holobiont was first proposed by Lynn Margulis in 1991 to describe the supraorganism formed by the microbes and their animal host under symbiotic conditions. the study of microbial communities has demonstrated most of the resident microbes live not as parasites but as commensals or under interspecific cooperation [11] deeming microbiota a \u201cforgotten human organ\u201d due to its importance. a placental microbiota of the placenta showed a striking similarity to that of the oral cavity so it was hypothesised to originate in the mothers' mouth by haematogenous (blood formation) spread. this led to the hypothesis that there is an actual placental microbiota that provides the first exposure of the foetus to microbes, forming the basis of gut colonization and having potential lifelong implications for the training and establishment of the immune system. retroviruses that have accumulated in the mammalian genome may be involved in cell\u2013cell fusion and immune modulation in the placenta. research has yet to establish the extent to which retroviruses have shaped the evolution of placental gene regulatory networks. early dynamics in infants have been thoroughly explored to understand the maturation of the human microbiota, particularly that of the gut. differences in the microbiota between caesarean section and vaginal delivery neonates are not detected as significant six weeks post-delivery. after that, the infant microbiota remains highly variable, changing notoriously after the introduction of solid food, eventually stabilizing after approximately three years. elderly people present a higher inter-individual variability in microbial composition when compared to young adults [149] decreased cost and ease of sequencing in the 2000s led to an increase in the number of complete genome sequences available for different bacterial strains from the same species. in environmental metagenomics, it can be expected that genomes reconstructed by assembling short reads are in fact the reflection of the inner variability that exists within a species in the sample. a species pan-genome with a large accessory genome is indicative of constant variation in the strains. a small pan-genome is indicative of constrained populations with little phage interference. a small pan-genome is indicative of constrained populations with little phage interference. zumi Ishino and collaborators reported an accessory nucleotide sequence in Escherichia coli, consisting of five 29 nt repeats interspaced by unique 32 nt sequences. similar sequences with diverse lengths and number of repeats were discovered in different strains of E coli and eventually in archaea, where they turned out to be more prevalent. the precise mechanism consists of direct DNA targeting (Type III systems can target RNA instead) by the crRNA followed by nuclease activity on the complementary infectious DNA (protospacer) produced by different Cas proteins. other Cas proteins participate in the cleavage of exogenous DNA for the incorporation of new spacers. some spacers targeting more than one related phage were the result of kill-the-winner dynamics. they hypothesized that the high degree of identity between the two populations and the highly local variability of genomic items for defence against phages was the result of kill-the-winner dynamics. a new alternative ecological conception proposes that infection by viruses may confer an advantage to both phages and prokaryotes under specific circumstances. lysogeny is favoured in high host density conditions supported by increased representation of integrase and excisionase genes in the virome. lysogeny is favoured in the overpopulated top layers of mucus. prophage induction is favoured and the phage bursts its host. a viral mechanism to counter the change in the bacterial receptors involves mutating their receptor-binding tail fibres. the scale of sequence variation has been recently paralleled to that in vertebrate adaptive immune systems by the group of Partho Ghosh. in 2018, the authors discovered 92 new DGR sequences exclusive to bacteriophages, most of them in prophages within Bacteroidetes, Proteobaceria and Firmicutes. the function of CRISPRs became apparent after Tang and collaborators detected the complete transcription of CRISPR genes in long RNA (pre-crRNA) each crRNA is derived from exogenous sequences of bacteriophage or plasmid origin and favours resistance to infection by phages carrying the sequences in the spacers. the precise mechanisms vary among the three known types of CRISPR systems. in all of them, CRISPR loci can be used to access a historical record of viral infections linked to a specific prokaryotic strain. bacteriophages and prophages classified as temperate viruses infecting Firmicutes or Bacteria. most of them were classified as temperate viruses (at least potentially) infecting Firmicutes or Bacteria. lysogeny is favoured in high host density conditions supported by increased representation of integrase and excisionase genes in the virome. lysogeny resulting from lysogeny may provide an adaptative advantage. lysogeny is favoured in the overpopulated top layers of mucus. prophage induction is favoured and the phage bursts its host. a viral mechanism to counter the change in the bacterial receptors involves mutating their receptor-binding tail fibres. collaborators reported the survey of viral metagenomes in which they discovered 92 new DGR sequences exclusive to bacteriophages. most of them in prophages within Bacteroidetes, Proteobaceria and Firmicutes. this suggests DGR contributes to a ubiquitous mechanism in human niches for interaction between viruses and bacteriophages. bioinformatic studies re-analyzing public metagenomic datasets have shown that even now, we are generating more metagenomic data than we can reasonably analyze. this elusive non-culturable virus was detected by re-analyzing WGS data from Reyes et al. 2010 [75] consisting of the gut virome of four unrelated families formed by twin pairs and their mothers. virologist Christopher Andrewes decided to drop binomial names in favour of the suffix. he suggested eight criteria for a new classification: morphology, chemical composition, immunological properties, susceptibility, transmission, host, pathology and symptomatology. a decade later, Andr\u00e9 Lwoff presented a proposal for a new classification at the symposium of Basic Mechanisms in Animal Virus Biology held in 1962. group I, comprised of dsDNA viruses, produce mRNA directly. in group III, dsRNA viruses can use negative sense (-) strand as template for mRNA. positive stranded (+) ssRNA viruses can either use their genome for translation or create a (-) RNA intermediary as a template for mRNA. the ICTV members have gathered every few years to discuss the addition of proposed viruses and taxonomical categories. they voted on the approval of the proposed classifications, releasing periodic reports on the state of viral taxonomy. the first report was presented in 1971 and included 290 approved and a similar number of candidate viruses. complexity of the current viral taxonomy is a crucial challenge that has yet to be addressed in virology. the ICTV has been accepted as the authority for the classification of new viruses with the adoption of their viral taxonomy. current rules concerning assignation are only applied to species and lower levels. taxa is only accepted when representative members are well characterized. this decision has polarized ICTV groups as in some cases only the sequences are available for a virus without any additional information about the viruses themselves. the Molecular Biology Database Collection (MBDC) is a curated compilation of openly accessible online databases and their characteristics. the list is growing steadily with each iteration, evidence of the fast pace at which biological sciences advance. just in the last three years, 199 new databases have been accepted. the INSDC databases amassed 2.65 Tb (1 Terabase = 1012 nt) nucleotides from 900 million sequences in its traditional archive of assembled annotated data. the INSDC databases amassed a shared total of 2.65 Tb (1 Terabase = 1012 nt) nucleotides from 900 million sequences in its traditional archive. the INSDC uses the an ICTV-based taxonomy for its viral sequences and includes the Baltimore classification (type of nucleic acid) as additional unranked data. viral annotations are limited and viromic sequences are commonly deposited as raw data in the SRA. many of the WGS metagenomes can prove useful for viromics. in on patterns in the whole dataset, they managed to predict over 125,000 partial viral genomes from within the metagenomes. they effectively increased the number of known viral genes by 16-fold, most of them phages. they also predicted which bacteria they might prey on by scanning through the associated CRISPR spacers and tRNA sequences. viral metagenomics has significantly increased the number of available sequences. the group used an alignment of the protein sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of 4,640 viruses for the phylogenetic analyses at a viromic scale. they inferred that dsRNA viruses may have evolved from (+)RNA viruses in two separate events. over 1,670,000 different viruses, spanning 25 families, may infect mammals and birds. between 631,000 and 827,000 of these may present a potential threat to humans. the project will start in Thailand and china but will eventually be extended to all the continents. the study of the human virome relies on the isolation of such viral particles, the recovery (and amplification of their nucleic acids) and, in the case of RNA viruses, an additional step consisting in the retrotranscription of their genomes to enable detection and sequencing. viromics is challenged with persistent methodological and conceptual biases and limitations that continue to be addressed with the advancement in the field of metagenomics."}
