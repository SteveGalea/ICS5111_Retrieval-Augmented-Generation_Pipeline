{"summary": "63 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus were admitted to a ward and diagnosed to have pneumonia/pneumonitis. 2 cases suggested a causative role of HSV-1 as the sole agent causing pneumonitis that proved clinically responsive to antiviral treatment. this study provides further evidence that HSV-1 causes isolated pneumonitis in the immunocompromised. the study may provide an estimate on the frequency of relevant HSV-1 infection and bacterial agents in outpatients with autoimmune disease. patients with rheumatoid, vasculitic and connective tissue autoimmune disease over a period of 8 years. a retrospective study was approved by the local Ethics Committee. each episode of a positive hit was reviewed. fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) was performed when deemed appropriate. material was centrifuged, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained using hematin-eosin. BAL fluids were subjected to viral polymerase chain reaction. 63 patients with rheumatic/vasculitic or connective tissue disease admitted to hospital and diagnosed to have pneumonia/pneumonitis. 0.5% per year of patients with pneumonia/pneumonitis. in 23 of these 63 patients bronchoscopy with lavage was performed within the first four days of admission. 14 (61%) also comprised PCR analysis for HSV-1. a total of six patients (10% of admissions for pneumonia) with positive HSV-1 DNA detection in alveolar fluids was identified. pred 20 mg/d + Cyclo 150 mg/d p.o.

HIV-1/2-Ag ELISA n.p. n.p. n.p. negative n.p. two cases (Case 1 and 2) in which no other viral, bacterial or fungal agent than HSV-1 on BAL PCR was found. in both cases, the initial chest radiograph and thoracic CT showed diffuse infiltrations or ground glass opacities. immunohistochemical staining of bronchioalveolar cells for HSV-1 proved positive. case 3 and 4 showed an initial co-infection with fungal or bacterial agents and HSV-1 and required prolonged mechanical ventilation. in case 4 infiltrates suggesting bronchopneumonia were also clearly present. both patients had a fatal outcome after prolonged in-hospital stay. cases 3\u20136 reflect the great difficulty of dissecting the role of HSV-1 in infections with multiple pathogens. it remains speculative if timely suppression of HSV-1 viral loads by antiviral treatment would have altered the patient's course. one case of pneumonitis was due to methotrexate. this analysis was performed including 56 of the 63 patients where reliable information on maintenance immunosuppression was available. in order to exclude selection bias, the comparison was also performed using the subgroup of 8 patients that were proven to be HSV-1 negative by BAL. ground glass opacities are a useful diagnostic hint in the immunocompromised, suggesting either an opportunistic infection due to Pneumocystis jirovecii, CMV, HSV-1, or other viruses. the definition of clinically relevant positive viral testing is a matter of controversy. a recent study in patients under prolonged mechanical ventilation required the combination of (i) clinical deterioration, (ii) HSV-1 detection in the lower respiratory tract virological workup is necessary to define by exclusion isolated HSV-1 pneumonitis. this is also illustrated by 60% of cases of pneumonia in our study. the possibility of falsely negative bacterial testing also applies as a caveat to our Cases 1 and 2. retrospective design provides some perspective on the frequency of HSV-1 and other bacterial, fungal and viral agents leading to pulmonary infection in this patient group. acute life-threatening respiratory failure associated with the detection of HSV-1 in the lower respiratory tract was a rare, but significant finding."}
