{"summary": "leptospirosis is a widespread disease caused by infection with the spirochete bacterium Leptospira. it is predominantly an occupational disease which affects humans who come into contact with rodents, pets or polluted water. the data of 2007 are the infected and dead human leptospirosis cases from January to October. pathogenic leptospires are able to translocate through cell monolayers at a rate significantly greater than that of nonpathogenic leptospires. the leptospirosis vaccines have been classified into recombinant protein vaccines, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) vaccines, inactivated and attenuated vaccines, and DNA vaccines. several leptospiral recombinant protein vaccines have been constructed with modern biotechnological methods. in 2002, a 130 kDa immunoreactive leptospiral immunoglobulin-like protein was described. the immune response of two immunoglobulin-like proteins, LigA and LigB, induced a protection against leptospires [56,73,74] the lig gene was shown to be useful in the detection of pathogenic Leptospira. lipoproteins were identified as targets during natural infection by leptospires. they are potentially useful for serodiagnosis and may serve as targets for vaccine design. lipoprotein-like complex glycolipoproteins (GLP) were suggested as vaccine candidates. virulence factors include FlaA, FlaB [87], Hsp58 [88], SphH [89,90] and ChpK [91] flaA and FlaB are important components of leptospiral periplasmic flagella (PF) the core of PF consists of at least three proteins: FlaB1, FlaB2 and FlaB3. chp locus consists of two genes: chpK and chpI. all virulence factors described above can be considered as candidates. only Lig, LipL41 and Hap1 proteins were approved as vaccines against leptospirosis. protective characteristics of several recombinant OMP vaccines have been tested. leptospiral outer membrane protein OmpL1, lipoprotein LipL41 [53], hemolysis-associated protein 1 (Hap1) [76] and immunoglobulin-like (Lig) protein. several outer membrane proteins, e.g. LAg42, Loa22, Lk73.5, have been recognized as leptospirosis vaccine candidates. the outer membrane proteins are abundant in the outer membrane, to which they are attached through fatty acids. many lipoproteins could be suitable as vaccine candidates. lipoproteins (LipL32, LipL45, LipL21 and GLP) are leptospirosis vaccine candidates. lipoprotein LipL36 was found not suitable as leptospirosis vaccine. production of this protein was downregulated in host-adapted leptospires. flaB virulence factor, flaB, can be amplified from the genomic DNA of several pathogenic serovars. virulence factor hemolysin SphH is a pore-forming protein on several mammalian cells. virulence factors (Hsp58, FlaA, FlaB, SphH and ChpK) can help us find more suitable vaccine candidates [1-4,8,9,11-13,94] heterologous expression of leptospiral outer membrane proteins (OMPs) became possible. hamsters were immunized with leptospiral LPSs or PS fraction from L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni. maximum titers were observed approximately 6 weeks after immunization. agglutinin titers could be achieved at 6\u201310 weeks after vaccination. oligosaccharide fraction from the LPS of serovar pomona was reported. oligosaccharide fraction was isolated by endo-glycosidase H digestion. oligosaccharide was partially purified by silica gel column chromatography. inactivated and attenuated vaccines have been reported for more than 50 years. some inactivated or attenuated leptospirosis vaccines were successfully tested in cattle. a commercial inactivated leptospirosis vaccine induced a poor antibody production in cattle during preliminary vaccination. inactivated vaccines can induce strong antigen-specific proliferative response by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of vaccinated cattle 2 months after the first dose of vaccine. inactivated or attenuated vaccines are suitable as the leptospirosis vaccines [4,5,8-11,13]. however, such vaccines cause safety problems [131,132]. the information on vaccines can be transmitted to the bioinformatics field. there are two basic types of leptospirosis vaccines available, attenuated and inactivated leptospirosis vaccines. this method could not guarantee enough safety. a combination of attenuated and inactivated leptospirosis vaccine may be highly effective. a real breakthrough for leptospirosis vaccines was the genetic technology that allows expression of leptospiral genes in heterologous organisms. recombinant proteins are useful as antigens in immunoassays to detect leptospires. a web service like the leptospirosis vaccine ontology database would be important for scientists working on leptospirosis vaccines. the author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."}
