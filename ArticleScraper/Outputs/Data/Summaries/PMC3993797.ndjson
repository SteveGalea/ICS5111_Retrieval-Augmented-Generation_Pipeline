{"summary": "MERS-CoV is acquired by respiratory spread, either from infected humans or from nonhuman animals. infection by this virus can cause widespread pneumonia (2, 3), with case fatality rates of 40% (4, 5). bats are implicated as virus reservoirs, as several known bat genomes closely match MERS-CoV (8\u201310). these animals express MERS-CoV susceptibility factors, including the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) 17. the widespread and relatively conserved nature of these susceptibility factors likely accounts for the remarkable polytropic character of MERS-CoV. mouse (Ms) astrocytoma DBT cells were maintained in MEM-7.5 (minimal essential medium [MEM] supplemented with 7.5% FBS, 10% tryptose phosphate broth [Difco], 100 IU/ml penicillin, 1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine) all cell lines were propagated as adherent monolayer cultures. the camel sequence was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing from a Camelus dromedarius cell line (Dubca; ATCC CRL 2276) the camel sequence was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing from a Camelus dromedarius cell line (Dubca; ATCC CRL 2276) 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-MERS-S-C9 via PEI transfection. one day posttransfection, cells were inoculated with pcDNA3.1-MERS-S-C9. media were collected, clarified for 10 min at 1,000 g, labeled as VSVluc-MERS S. the resulting plasmid, designated pCEP4-MERS-S1-Fc, was transfected using PEI into 293 EBNA cells. cells were washed with prewarmed SFM and incubated in SFM for 16 h. one day posttransfection, cells were trypsinized and replated in 96-well plates. one day postransduction, cells were lysed with 1 passive lysis buffer (Promega) and luminescence was measured as described above. transfected cells were dissolved on ice for 15 min with TX100 buffer. postnuclear supernatants were mixed 1:5 with SDS buffer. proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) mouse (Ms) astrocytoma DBT cells were maintained in MEM-7.5. pCMV-Kan/Neo-msDPP4 plasmid pCMV6-Entry-huDPP4 was PCR amplified. sequence was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing from a Camelus dromedarius cell line. pCAGGS-TMPRSS2-FLAG and pCAGGS-TMPRSS2(S441A)-FLAG were previously constructed. DNA/PEI complexes were incubated in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) for 15 min before they were added to plated cells in 6-well or 12-well test plates. one day posttransfection, cells were washed with 0.9% saline solution, treated with trypsin (HyClone) and then replated into 96-well test plates. inocula were removed and cells incubated for 48 h. the resulting plasmid was transfected using PEI into 293 EBNA cells. cells were washed with prewarmed SFM and incubated in SFM for 16 h. c protein yields were determined by comparisons with serial dilutions of human IgG standards on Western immunoblots. cells were transfected with the various chimeric DPP4 receptor constructs in 12-well cell culture plates. one day posttransfection, cells were trypsinized and replated in 96-well plates. cells were transfected in 12-well test plates with TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS2(S441A) one day posttransfection, cells were reseeded into 96-well plates. cells were transduced with VSVluc-MERS S and luminescence measured 16 h postransduction. Statistical tests of significance were performed using the Holm-Sidak multiple Student's t test procedure. the complete camel DPP4 open reading frame was deposited in NCBI GenBank. RESULTS Chimeric human-mouse DPP4 receptors. mouse DBT cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 (empty vector [EV]) Hu, Ms, or Hu(b4\u20135) DPP4s. at 16 h postransduction, relative luminescence unit (RLU) values were measured. we obtained cDNA clones encoding C-terminal myc and FLAG-tagged mouse (Ms) and human (Hu) DPP4s and synthetic DNAs encoding Ms and Hu blades 4 and 5. Gibson assembly techniques were then used to replace the Ms blades with the synthetic human DNA and reciprocally replace Hu with Ms blades. this provided the construct designated Hu(b4\u20135), with humanized amino acids 194 to 350 in the Ms DPP4 background the human DPP4 was indistinguishable from a mouse DPP4 that contained only human blades 4 and 5. the human DPP4 was indistinguishable from a mouse DPP4 that contained only human blades 4 and 5. to further compare the affinities of these receptors for MERS S proteins, we introduced graded doses of MERS S1-Fc proteins before and during VSVluc-MERS S transduction. the camel DPP4 sequence was compared with other animal DPP4 sequences in a phylogenetic analysis. the comparisons also included Pipistrelle bats, one of 20 bat genera residing in Saudi Arabia. chimeric DPP4s sensitized DBT cells to VSVluc-MERS S transduction but at various levels. human, horse, and camel receptors were similarly effective, while goat and bat conferred significantly lower susceptibilities. these trends were also identified in the results of authentic MERS-CoV infections. DPP4-transfected cells were transfected with the indicated DPP4s. luciferase accumulations were determined 16 h later. Statistical significance tests were performed using the Student t test. DBT cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 or with pCMV6-DPP4 chimeras were incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies (1:500) or with 50 nM S1-Fc, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and analyzed by flow cytometry. positive cell percentages, after background subtraction, are listed to right in the figure. DBT cells were transfected with DPP4 chimeras, incubated with the indicated concentrations of MERS S1-Fc for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. data were normalized to transduction in the absence of S1-Fc. the concentrations of S1-Fc at each IC50 reflect the affinities of MERS spikes for the different DPP4 receptors. TMPRSS2 significantly promoted MERS S-mediated transduction into all of the DPP4+ cells, except those expressing mouse DPP4. transduction into Bt(b4\u20135) and Gt(b4\u20135) receptor-positive cells was augmented by wild-type (WT) TMPRSS2 3.6 times more than the corresponding transduction into Cm(b4\u20135), Hs(b4\u20135), and Hu(b4\u20135) DPP4+ cells. TMPRSS2 is one of the principal MERS-CoV-activating proteases. cells bearing receptors with low affinities for MERS-CoV are rendered far more susceptible to infection when appropriate proteolytic environments are in place. the TMPR and actin proteins in cell lysates were visualized by Western blotting. after 1 day, the HuDPP4, TMPR, and actin proteins in cell lysates were visualized. the uncleaved (inactive) TMPRSS2 has a molecular mass of 60 kDa. DPP4 includes a transmembrane anchor (residues 7 to 28), a propeller ectodomain (54 to 497), and a protease ectodomain (508 to 766). pcDNA3.1 (empty vector [EV]) mouse DBT cells were transfected and infected 1 day later with VSVluc-MERS S. murine blades 4 and 5 could be replaced with orthologous animal blades. we expected some chimeric DPP4s would function as MERS-CoV receptors. this expectation was based on the fact that the close contacts between MERS-CoV S and human DPP4 are within the blade 4 and 5 region (17, 27) the reciprocal chimeric Hu DPP4 with Ms blades 4 and 5 did not sensitize cells to transduction. in a second test, we challenged the DBT cell transfectants with authentic MERS-CoV and measured virus output titers by plaque assays. the human DPP4 was indistinguishable from a mouse DPP4 that contained only human blades 4 and 5. human DPP4 and S1 (26) engendered confidence that the animal blade 4 and 5 regions would reflect the complete animal DPP4s, at least with respect to MERS-CoV entry. we proceeded with additional blade 4 and 5 replacements from other animals. the camel DPP4 sequence was compared with other animal DPP4 sequences in a phylogenetic analysis. horses have 0, camels 2, goats and bats 3, and mice 5 residues diverging from those of humans. chimeric DPP4s sensitized DBT cells to VSVluc-MERS S transduction but at various levels. DPP4-transfected cells were transfected with the indicated DPP4s. luciferase accumulations were determined 16 h later. Statistical significance tests were performed using the Student t test. the same DPP4+ transfectants, assessed in parallel for S1-Fc binding, revealed quite similar S1 associations for all of the receptors except for bat and mouse. the same DPP4+ transfectants, assessed in parallel for S1-Fc binding, revealed quite similar S1 associations. DBT cells were transfected with DPP4 chimeras, incubated with the indicated concentrations of MERS S1-Fc for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and transduced with VSVluc-MERS-S. n.s. = not significant; n.s. = not significant. the catalytically inactive TMPRSS2 DNA was indistinguishable from empty vector DNA and had no effect on subsequent MERS S-mediated transductions. however, relative to the mutant control conditions, TMPRSS2 significantly promoted MERS S-mediated transduction into all of the DPP4+ cells. transduction into cells with relatively low-affinity receptors was augmented by wild-type (WT) TMPRSS2 3.6 times more than the corresponding transduction into C the presence of TMPRSS2 results in proteolysis of the SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (21), and augments SARS pseudovirus entry (37) we further investigated DPP4 proteolysis at higher TMPRSS2 levels and in human 293 cells. in these experiments, human DPP4 levels clearly diminished with increasing TMPRSS2 levels. the luciferase-containing lysates were subjected to electrophoresis. the luciferase-containing lysates were visualized by Western blotting. the TMPRSS2 zymogen has a molecular mass of 60 kDa. the affinity of the MERS-CoV S RBD for human DPP4 is 17 nM (26) this value is 10 times lower than that of the SARS-CoV S RBD for human ACE2 (40) the presumed animal precursors of human SARS-CoVs have affinities for ACE2 in the 20 to 100 nM range (40) a genetically stable MERS-CoV RBD suggests that binding affinity to the DPP4 receptor may not be the most critical factor for adaptation to new species. a durable virus-receptor connection may therefore be necessary to maintain SARS-CoV on cells throughout endocytosis or at least until its S proteins refold into fusion-intermediate forms. TMPRSS2 is a membrane-impermeant inhibitory peptide that targets the fusion intermediate forms (46). a low-affinity receptor can sensitize cells to infection as long as there are protease cofactors available to cleave viral spikes and permit their transition into membrane fusion-active conformations."}
