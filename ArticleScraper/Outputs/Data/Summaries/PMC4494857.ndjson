{"summary": "heightened awareness of the airborne transmission potential of various infectious agents has been raised for human-to-human transmission of influenza. despite these precautions, containment failures can happen and the operation of isolation room doors could be one of the main contributors [20\u201322] particles with a diameter of less than 5 m are considered airborne. however, under normal air conditions, particles up to 50 m dry out completely within 0.5 seconds. particles up to 100 m would totally evaporate before falling 2 m. this paper combines a LES simulation with measurements from the full-scale experimental mock-up with the same geometry. the test case was a simple isothermal scenario without ventilation, but including single hinged-door-opening and closing. so, the flow interactions arising from the moving door and human, alone, are presented, without any interference from any other sources. a study by Shih et al (case B in [32] applied dynamic meshing to model the effect of opening and closing of a sliding door without passage on the spread of CO2 contaminant from a human source. the size of the mesh was less than 100 000 cells, though it was enough to model the CO2 isosurfaces. the air volume migrating from one room into the other was measured by tagging the air with tracer gases. the amount of tracer escaping into the other room then gave the AVM. this study is a continuation of an earlier study simulating the door cycle without passage. nurse approaches the door (1.4 s followed by 2 s wait) nurse moves through the doorway, into the anteroom (4.1 s, followed by 0.5 s wait) after these movements, the simulation was continued for ten seconds to monitor the fading air flows. the total duration of the test case was 30 s. in the refined volume, a typical mesh element diameter was of the order of 1 cm, and the volumes of the finite volumes were 1.5106\u20132.5106 m3. a 2 cm high gap was left below the door to avoid convergence problems in the beginning of the door-opening phase. the total CPU-time spent was approximately 94106 s in a workstation equipped with 2.8 GHz Intel Xeon v2 processors. the time step length of 2 ms used here is unnecessarily short most of the time, since the maximal Courant number stayed well below 1, mostly. tracer gas 1 was initially dosed into room 1 and tracer 2 into room 2. the average mass concentrations of the tracers in the other rooms prior to the cycle are nonzero, i.e. 1, room 2, 2, room 1 0.. the concentrations of both the tracers in both the rooms were monitored by one gas analyzer (BK1302) using sampling tubes that were perforated throughout their lengths. after the door had closed, the air in the rooms was mixed by fans. a third measure of confirmation was using repeated measurements. a time-resolved simulation provides a possibility to actually see the mixing of the airs from the two rooms. in the video, the mass concentration of one of the tracer gases is coded by colours. simulated smoke would be a useful illustrative tool to simulate the flow structures predicted by LES. six isosurfaces with different tracer mass concentrations and transparencies are drawn simultaneously. the colour of all the isosurfaces equals the colour of the light source, and is white. the video is based on a single CFD LES simulation, having different passive scalars dosed into each room. a simulated snapshot of a smoke experiment is shown in the rightmost figure. it shows an instantaneous greyscale map of the tracer gas concentration near a closing door. the higher the tracer concentration, the whiter the hue. the method of greyscale maps described above is also useful in a situation where a thick zone of smoke is lit with light whose direction of arrival is approximately perpendicular to a coordinate axis. it is also assumed the view direction is approximately parallel to the same coordinate axis. then the light scattering can be easily discretized in the view direction by drawing several partially transparent greyscale maps above each other. the door is moving with a steady velocity 1 m/s, ending in a deceleration ramp. the cycle with door operation and passage is detailed in Fig 1. The direction of the nurse movement is from the isolation room to the anteroom. the time step was chosen to be very short to ensure that the flow would normally travel no more than one mesh node spacing during one step. after the door and nurse movements had ended, it was increased to 4 ms. the mesh was a pure tetra mesh comprising 11.7 million nodes. the moving door and nurse were modelled by using immersed solid technique available in CFX. using immersed solid technique, no re-meshing is needed between the time steps. at each time step a check is made on whether the mesh elements lying in the trajectory of the moving object are located inside or outside of the object. the volume V ji of air migrated from room j to room i does not need to be the same. by using two different tracer gases simultaneously, each dosed into different rooms, it is possible to independently measure the volumes of air passing through the doorway in each direction. this allows measuring several door and passage cycles in succession. the two tracer gases used in the measurements were N2O and SF6, having characteristic infrared absorption bands well apart from each other and from the strongest bands of H2O and CO2. prior to their release into the rooms, they were diluted with clean air to prevent them from stratifying near the floor. the migrated mass m i of tracer i can be calculated at any instant of time t from the corresponding simulated time step. a time-resolved simulation provides a possibility to actually see the mixing of the airs from the two rooms. simulated smoke videos and real camcorder shots would be an interesting method to qualitatively validate the CFD results. similar propagation of smoke and tracer gas makes it possible to use the same passive scalar to represent them both in the LES simulation. a negative correlation between concentration and transparency needs to be defined. the video corresponds to situations where the rooms are entirely lit. it displays basic flow structures, such as the jet through the gap below the door starting to open, the door vortices, and the wake of air the nurse is dragging behind her. it is comparable with the latter part of S3 Video by Tang et al. [22], showing the same features except that there is not a similar gap below the door. a greyscale contour map of the concentration of a passive scalar on a cross-sectional plane is equivalent to illuminating a thin sheet of smoke by white light. the method of greyscale maps described above is also useful in a situation, where a thick zone of smoke is lit with light whose direction of arrival is approximately perpendicular to a coordinate axis. a LES simulation provides more detailed information than measurements here in that it gives the AVM as a function of time. a very intense flow through the doorway can be seen at the very beginning of the door-opening phase. a 2 cm high gap was left below the door to avoid convergence problems. the total simulated volume of air migrated in the door-opening phase (duration 3 s) is 0.412 m3. in the door-closing phase the flow continued at almost unchanged rate, the volume of air migrated being 0.327 m3. in the door-closing phase the flow continued at almost unchanged rate, the volume of air migrated being 0.74 m3. the difference between the final AVM with combined door operation and passage on the other hand gives the additional effect of a human passage on the total AVM. the value of this difference was 0.54 m3 in the measurements and 0.30 m3 in the simulations. a range of values for the flux of the wake induced by a moving human was 0.08\u20130.23 m3/s. this estimate does not take into account how the flux behaves over time during the passage and after the nurse has stopped moving. in case of hinged door, the direction of the passage might be crucial. the effect of opening angle (90\u00b0 vs 45\u00b0 tested) was smaller, but clearly detectable. the effect of a 2\u00b0C temperature difference between the two rooms resulted in 41% increase in the AVM in the case used in the CFD simulation. smoke has been dosed into the isolation room, and the anteroom side is shown. this time the simulated smoke has been generated by using the simplified method with four contour surfaces. a LES simulation provides more detailed information than measurements here in that it gives the AVM as a function of time. a very intense flow through the doorway can be seen at the very beginning of the door-opening phase. a 2 cm high gap was left below the door to avoid convergence problems. m3, 20% (or 0.39 m3) lower than the average of the repeated measurements at 1.93 m3. in another simulation, without the moving nurse, the corresponding result was 10% (or 0.15 m3) too low (1.24 m3 vs. 1.39 m3), see the lower plot of Fig 5. a closing time of 3 s would have resulted in air volume of 3/5.4*0.327 m3 = 0.182 m3 migrated during the door-closing. the total AVM would be 0.66 m3, which is almost exactly the same as the result by Kiel and Wilson. a human wake is an important agent in air transport. the time from the moment the nurse passes the doorway to the moment the door is half-closed is 8.45 s. the time of influence of the wake is nearly the same in both simulations. however, their rooms and doorway were smaller than in our study. a set of varied door and passage cycles was tested in the experimental section of our study [35]. a set of varied door parameters varied in the laboratory experiments were opening-time, hold-open time, closing-time, and opening-angle. a similar effect has been found by Hathway et al. [37] who studied doorway flows generated by a single hinged-door. this figure is one frame from a time-resolved presentation, S4 Video. the experiment and simulation show the flow structures as a function of time. an opening door vortex develops and separates from the door, as it swings open. experimental smoke visualization as compared with simulated smoke drawn by the method of stacked contour maps. in the water model experiment by Tang et al., the left side of the room is devoid of smoke during door operation and passage. the difference between experiments and simulation could be explained by inaccuracies in the modelled geometry. the difference between experiments and simulation could be explained by inaccuracies in the modelled geometry. in the simulation, the gap below the door was present all the time. a large vertical temperature gradient characteristic to the displacement strategy can result in stratification of the exhaled air at some level [39, 24], and increase cross-transmission risks. a very large air flow rate without creating a draughty environment can be attained by using downward ventilation with large supply area [24] simulated smoke video combines two separate smoke experiments. the smoke escaping from the isolation room is illuminated by white light. in both videos only the height interval from 0.6 m to 1.4 m is lit."}
