{"summary": "METHODS Children included in this study were a subset of a larger prospective, longitudinal cohort study on chronic cough in children. written informed consent was obtained from the parents/guardians. of 398 children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy and BAL for clinical indication, 245 were diagnosed with PBB or BE. a random subset of HAdV isolates, based on sample availability, underwent nucleotide sequencing at a research laboratory. a random subset of HAdV isolates, based on sample availability, from 26 HAdV+ on BAL children, was incubated for 1 minute at 94\u00b0C followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 minute. round 2 PCR products were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. relationship between HAdV genotypes, sequenced from 24 HAdV+ study children, was illustrated in a phylogenetic tree. clinical definitions BE was diagnosed based on radiological criteria [26] in children with clinical symptoms consistent with BE [27] all had evidence of mild (cylindrical) BE on high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan (reconstructed from a multidetector CT scan) syncytial virus, human influenza A virus, human parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133 (HPIV1-3), human metapneumovirus (standard panel), human rhinoviruses, human bocavirus, human coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, 229E, HKU1), WU polyomavirus, and KI polyomavirus (extended panel) random subset of HAdV isolates underwent nucleotide sequencing at round 2 PCR products were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. a neighbor-joining method of phylogenetic analysis of human adenovirus (HAdV) genotypes and their assigned species were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. RESULTS Study Population Of the 245 children with PBB or BE, 40 were HAdV+ and 205 HAdV. median age was similar between HAdV+ and HAdV groups in children with BE (P =.312) HAdV genotyping was performed on a random subset of 26 HAdV+ on BAL children. a single HAdV+ isolate was identified as genotype 4, species E, in a child with low-grade fever and mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. Staphylococcus aureus was the fourth most common bacterium causing lower airway infection. however, a significant negative association with HAdV+ status was observed. HAdV-1 compared to HAdV-2 was more likely to have lower airway infection with multiple (2 or more) major bacterial species. the HAdV+ group was more likely to have lower airway infection with multiple (2 or more) major bacterial species (excluding S. aureus) compared with the HAdV group (OR, 2.471 [95% CI, 1.228\u20134.969]; P =.011). bocavirus was detected less commonly in HAdV compared to HAdV+ children (1 of 41 [2.4%] vs 3 of 11 [27.3%]; P =.026) study Population Of the 245 children with PBB or BE, 40 were HAdV+ and 205 HAdV. median age of the children in the study was 30 months (IQR, 17\u201363 months), 23 months (IQR, 14\u201347 months) in those with PBB. CD 16+ and CD56+ NK cells were elevated above the normal range in 20\u201325 (80%) of HAdV+ and 64 of 114 (56.1%) of HAdV children. similar rates of NK cell elevation were seen in children with or without standard panel respiratory viruses detected in BAL (P =.601) 68%) 96 (47%) 2.36 (1.15\u20134.83).019 Streptococcus pneumoniae 14 (35%) 46 (22%) 1.86 (.90\u20133.85).094 Staphylococcus aureus 0 (0%) 21 (10.2%). no further associations between individual genotypes and bacterial coinfection were observed. standard panel respiratory viruses were detected at similar rates in HAdV and HAdV+ children. human metapneumovirus was detected in 5 (2.4%) and 0 (P =.594) children in the HAdV and HAdV+ groups. the HAdV-C species is one of the most frequent HAdV species known to infect the respiratory tract of children. the highest levels of HAdV DNA are detected in adenotonsillar tissue of 2-year-old children undergoing routine adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy. the amount of HAdV DNA decreases with age. HAdV was detected in 78.4% of nasopharyngeal samples of asthmatic children during symptom-free periods. HAdV is significantly more likely to be detected in BAL fluid of children with PBB (23%) compared with controls (4%). the propensity for codetection of HAdV with bacterial pathogens (eg, NTHi) has been documented in studies on human respiratory diseases [41, 42]. the most convincing evidence for microbial synergy arises from an animal study on otitis media. HAdV in the lower airways of children with PBB and BE is likely to have clinical relevance. a predominance of HAdV-C in the airways of these children, with a plausible mechanism for disease. it is therefore unlikely that HAdV is an innocent bystander, as early epidemiologic studies suggested. HAdV-C genotypes 1 and 2 are the dominant HAdV species infecting the lower airways of young children with chronic endobronchial suppuration. the significant association between HAdV and lower airway bacterial infection suggests a possible role of HAdV-C in the pathogenesis of chronic suppurative lung diseases."}
