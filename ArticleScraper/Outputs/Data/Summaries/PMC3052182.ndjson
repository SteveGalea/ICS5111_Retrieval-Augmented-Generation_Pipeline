{"summary": "paramyxoviridae is a large and diverse family whose members have been isolated from many species of avian, terrestrial, and aquatic animal species around the world. the subfamily Paramyxovirinae contains five genera: Respirovirus, Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus, and Avulavirus. the subfamily Pneumovirinae contains two genera, Pneumovirus and Metapneumovirus. APMV-1 comprises all strains of NDV and is best characterized serotype because of the severity of disease caused by virulent NDV strains in chickens. highly virulent (velogenic) strains cause severe respiratory and neurological disease in chickens; moderately virulent (mesogenic) strains, which cause mild disease; and non-pathogenic (lentogenic) strains, which cause inapparent infections. APMV-7 infection in turkeys caused respiratory disease, mild multifocal nodular lymphocytic airsacculitis, and decreased egg production. APMV-9 strains have been isolated from ducks around the world [36,37] there are no reports of isolation of APMV-5, -8 and -7 from poultry. hamsters were infected with a prototype strain of each APMV serotype by the intranasal route. each APMV serotype replicated in hamsters without causing adverse clinical signs of illness, although histopathologic evidence was observed in some cases. all of the viruses were grown in 9-day-old embryonated specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs inoculated by the allantoic route. the allantoic fluids from infected eggs were collected 96 h post-inoculation and virus titers were determined by hemagglutination (HA) assay with 0.5% chicken RBC except in case of APMV-5. the excised gel bands were minced in a clean pestle and mixed with elution buffer. the proteins were eluted by centrifugation at 13000 g for 5 minutes. after two weeks, a booster immunization was given with 200 g of each protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and two weeks later the hyperimmune sera were collected. the sera were stored at -80\u00b0C until further use. three hamsters from each group were euthanized at 3 dpi and the other three at 14 dpi by rapid asphyxiation in a CO2 chamber. serum samples were collected on 14 dpi immediately prior to euthanasia. half of each tissue sample was used for virus titration. the plates were fixed in 10% formalin for 30 min and the cells were permeabilized using 2% Triton X-100 for 2 min. the cells were blocked using 2% normal goat serum for 60 min. the cells were incubated with primary rabbit antiserum raised against the N protein of the homologous APMV serotype at room temperature for 1 h. sections were deparaffinized in two changes of xylene for 5 min each, hydrated in two changes of 100% ethanol for 3 min each, changes of 95% and 80% ethanol for 1 min each, and finally washed in distilled water. sections were processed for antigen retrieval in a water bath containing sodium citrate buffer (10 mM citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0), at 95-100\u00b0C for 40 min. APMV-1, APMV-2, APMV-2/Chicken/California/Yucaipa/56; APMV-3, APMV-3/PKT/Netherland/449/75; APMV-4, APMV-4/duck/HongKong/D3/75; APMV-5, which was grown in vero cells. all of the viruses were grown in 9-day-old embryonated specific-pathogen-free chicken chicken embryo fibroblast (DF-1) cells were grown in Earle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the cells were fixed with methanol and stained with 1% crystal violet. values for each tissue sample were based on average plaque count from three wells. the sera were tested by western blot and were found to recognize specifically the homologous N protein. the sera were stored at -80\u00b0C until further use. the animals were housed in negative-pressure isolators under bio safety level (BSL-2 conditions) half of each tissue sample was used for virus titration. samples were collected aseptically in 1 mL of DMEM in 10X antibiotic solution. they were processed immediately to avoid any reduction in virus titers. ers were determined by end point titration method using the Reed and Muench formula. each tissue sample was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, held for approximately seven days, and processed for IHC and histopathology. sections were deparaffinized in two changes of xylene for 5 min each. serum in a humidified chamber washed with FITC conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. sections were mounted with glycerol and viewed under an immunofluorescence microscope. cross-HI tests were performed to investigate cross reactivity with other APMV serotypes. all six hamsters infected with APMV-9 serotypes were dull and had rough skin coat at 3 dpi. they appeared weak and lost weight till 5 dpi, but later gained body weight and appeared normal by 10 dpi. none of the hamsters died of disease. the values of the difference in body weight at 5 dpi are calculated relative to day 0 for the same group. the followings organs were removed and examined for gross pathology, histopathology, immunohistochemical analysis, and quantitative virology. the most predominant histopathological lesions observed in the nasal turbinates were multifocal necrotic/apoptotic epithelial cells and nuclear pyknosis. along the nasal septum were areas of epithelial necrosis, accumulation of nuclear debris in the mucosal epithelium, vacuolation of epithelial cells, and blunting or loss of cilia. the bronchiolar and bronchial epithelia are multifocally hyperplastic (yellow arrow) there are moderate numbers of necrotic cells in the bronchiolar epithelium and in areas of inflammation in alveoli. there is multifocal infiltration and consolidation of the pulmonary interstitium by moderate numbers of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. there are moderate numbers of necrotic cells in bronchiolar epithelium. there is massive cell death and necrosis of the epithelial tissue lining the turbinate bone (white arrow) there is no appreciable level of inflammatory cells in the surrounding tissues. animals infected with APMV-5 did not show any positive immunofluorescence in any of the tissues examined at 3 or 14 dpi. virus-specific antigens were detected on 3 dpi in the lungs and nasal turbinates. in the lungs, the viral antigens were mostly localized in the epithelium surrounding the medium and small bronchi. immunofluorescence was evident primarily at the apical surface of the ciliated epithelial cells and in the cytoplasm (white arrows). d) section of harderian gland and nasal turbinate infected with APMV-8. immunofluorescence was evident primarily in the collecting ducts of the gland. APMV-1 was isolated from lungs and nasal turbinates of all three animals. APMV-3 was isolated from lungs and nasal turbinates of all three animals. no virus was isolated from any tissues of the hamsters infected with APMV-5, -7 and -8.

APMV-9 specific antiserum had a two-fold higher titer against APMV-1 than against APMV-9. cross-reactivity of sera from hamsters infected with the indicated APMV serotype. APMV-1 (NDV) is the most extensively characterized member of the APMV serotypes. APMV-2 to -9 have been isolated from both wild and domestic birds. APMV-1 has also been shown to infect a number of non avian species. virus was recovered from animals infected with APMV-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, and -9. no virus was detected in any samples for any serotype 14 dpi. the viral titers were moderate and restricted to the lungs and nasal turbinates. all APMV serotypes are capable of infecting hamsters using a nasal route of infection. the extensive amount of virus replication in the respiratory tract was not accompanied by severe disease in hamsters. serologic assays demonstrated a humoral response in all the hamsters inoculated with APMV serotypes -1 to -9, a further indication of successful virus replication. the HI test with hamster serum is highly specific and can be used to diagnose different APMV serotypes in field cases. most of the APMV serotypes replicated well in hamsters, producing mild respiratory pathology and high neutralizing antibody titers. the replication of APMVs in hamsters produced mild rhinitis. the APMVs replicate moderately in hamsters and produce either mild or no clinical signs. this is the first comparative report on the replication and pathogenicity of APMV strains. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
