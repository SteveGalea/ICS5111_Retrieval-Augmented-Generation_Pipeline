{"summary": "Background Diarrhea is the third leading infectious cause of death worldwide. approximately 40% of all diarrhea cases are of unknown etiology. many picornaviruses can be detected in the developing world. picornaviruses are non-enveloped viruses with a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome that encodes a single polyprotein [12] the picornavirus family currently consists of 14 proposed genera http://www.picornaviridae.com associated with a diverse range of diseases. the klassevirus 1 contig had a genomic organization similar to other picornaviruses. two picornavirus capsid proteins, RNA helicase, 3C cysteine protease, and RNA dependent RNA polymerase were present. Phylogenetic analysis of klasse-mel1 virus demonstrated that this virus sequence is highly divergent from all previously described picornaviruses. the closest relatives of klassevirus 1 appeared to be members of the genus Kobuvirus, which includes aichi virus, bovine kobuvirus and porcine kobuvirus. RT-PCR was performed on concentrated raw sewage collected in Barcelona, Spain. this fragment shared 85% amino acid identity and 84% nucleotide identity to the original klasse-mel1 sequence. a kb of additional sequence was generated from klasse-bar1 and klasse-stl1. a 6383 bp contig (klasse-mel1) was generated by RT-PCR and multiple 3' and 5' random amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions. the 5' end aligned to the predicted VP0 protein at the N-terminus of the polyprotein and extended past the predicted 3D protein at the C-terminus of the polyprotein to the poly-A tail. the closest relatives of klassevirus 1 appeared to be members of the genus Kobuvirus. phylogenetic anaylsis was generated with klassevirus 1 and the corresponding regions of known picornaviruses using ClustalX. klassevirus 1 may represent the first member of new. klassevirus 1 may represent the first member of new. bootstrap analysis suggests klassevirus 1 diverged from an ancestor common to all of the known kobuviruses. the presence of klassevirus 1 in the united states was determined by the traditional strategy of screening of individual stool samples. klassevirus 1 could represent a non-human virus acquired from dietary exposure. further investigations are needed to determine if klassevirus 1 is a causal agent of human disease(s) further investigations are needed to determine if klassevirus 1 is a human commensal virus. Sequences were clustered based on 98% identity over 98% sequence length. the longest sequence from each cluster was chosen as the representative sequence of the cluster. unique sequences were filtered for repetitive sequences and then compared with the GenBank nr database. RNA was extracted from 200 L of each stool suspension using a MagnaPure LC instrument (Roche) total nucleic acid was extracted from 200 L of each stool suspension using a MagnaPure LC instrument. the viruses present in the sample were concentrated in 30 mL of phosphate buffer by organic flocculation. 10 mL of the viral concentrate were eluted with 40 mL of 0.25 M glycine buffer (pH 9,5) at 4\u00b0C. a second concentration step with elution of the viral particles was performed. RT-PCR reactions were performed using the Invitrogen One-Step RT-PCR kit. amplicons were cloned into pCR4 (Invitrogen) and sequenced using standard Sanger sequencing technology. all klassevirus 1 sequences have been deposited in Genbank (GQ253930-GQ253936) to eliminate sequence redundancy in each library sequences were clustered using BLASTCLUST from the 2.2.17 version of NCBI BLAST. unique sequences were filtered for repetitive sequences and then compared with the GenBank nr database by BLASTN and TBLASTX. the amino acid alignments generated by ClustalX were input into PAUP [35], and maximum parsimony analysis was performed using the default settings. RNA was extracted in the same manner as the primary sample. raw sewage One 10 L-sample of raw sewage was collected in an urban wastewater treatment plant in the area of Barcelona, Spain. the samples were collected in a sterile container and stored for up to 2 hours at 4\u00b0C before being processed. the viruses present in the sample were concentrated in 30 mL of phosphate buffer by organic flocculation. amplicons of 1001 bp and 1025 bp based on the klasse-mel1 sequence were designed targeting the 3D and VP0/VP3 regions. amplicons were cloned into pCR4 (Invitrogen) and sequenced using standard Sanger sequencing technology. in some instances, PCR products were directly sequenced and only high quality sequence from those samples were included in analysis. 340 stool specimens routinely submitted to the St. Louis Children's Hospital Lab for bacterial culture were collected from January 2008\u2013july 2008. raw sewage One 10 L-sample of raw sewage was collected in an urban wastewater treatment plant in the area of Barcelona, Spain. the viruses present in the sample were concentrated in 30 mL of phosphate buffer by organic flocculation. primers expected to produce amplicons of 1001 bp and 1025 bp based on the klasse-mel1 sequence were designed targeting the 3D and VP0/VP3 regions. amplicons were cloned into pCR4 (Invitrogen) and sequenced using standard Sanger sequencing technology. the authors declare that they have no competing interests.
