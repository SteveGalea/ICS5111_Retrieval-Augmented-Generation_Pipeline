{"summary": "hCD81 mediates post-binding steps in HCV entry. it translocates with the virus along the plasma membrane [14], it co-endocytoses with the virus [15] and triggers conformational changes in the viral E1/E2 glycoproteins. tetraspanin protein family is surface expressed and consists of four transmembrane domains, two short cytoplasmic termini, one short cytoplasmic loop and two extracellular domains. tetraspanins lack signaling domains, but coordinate PPIs and lipid interactions in tetraspanin webs. hCD81 has at least two functions during HCV entry. hCD81 is one of the species tropism determining factors for HCV. the virus naturally infects humans and can experimentally infect chimpanzees and tupaias. a combination of host factor incompatibility and immune restriction leads to this narrow host tropism. m and hCD9 chimeras are surface expressed, bind HCV E2 glycoprotein, but fail to support HCV infection. these data highlight the critical role of hCD81 backbone domains in post-binding HCV entry events. they were designed by replacing the LEL of human CD9 (hCD9), human CD82 (hCD82), human TSN32 (hTSN32), Danio rerio CD81 (drCD81), Xen dmTSP96F-f (5\u2032-AAA AAA CCT GCA GGG CCA CCA TGG GTC TCA ACG-3\u2032), hCD9-f (5\u2032-AAA AAA CCT GCA GGG CCA CCA TGG GTC TCA ACG-3\u2032), hTSN32-f (5\u2032-AAA AAA CCT GCA GGG CCA CCA TGG GCT CAG C-3\u2032), hTSN32-f (5\u2032-AA PCR products were cloned into the pWPI_BLR vector by Gibson assembly. hepatoma cell lines Huh-7.5 [38], which expresses hCD81, and Lunet N#3, which lacks detectable levels of endogenous hCD81 [39] were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and 10 mM Hepes at 37 \u00b0C. CHO745 cells expressing tetraspanin chimeras and point mutants were stably selected using blasticidin. Jc1, Jc-R2A and intergenotypic chimera HCVcc were produced in Huh-7.5 cells and titrated as previously reported. goat anti-rabbit-IgG-Alexa647, 2 g/mL, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA, washed three times with PBS supplemented with 1% FCS. cells were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 1% FCS. 5 106 CHO 745 cells were incubated with 10 g of Alexa fluorophore conjugated eE2 in 600 L PBS at room temperature for 2 h. cells were washed three times with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. hepatoma cells were seeded at a density of 8 103 in 96-wells and infected with an MOI of 0.1 of VSV*MQ and HCoV229-E-luc 24 h later. infectivity was determined by luciferase activity measurement in cell lysates at 24 hpi. the hCD81 structure (PDB:5TCX) was imaged with 3-D Molecule Viewer. Experiments were performed at least in three biological replicates. results are presented as mean plus the standard deviation (SD) of three biological replicates unless otherwise indicated. hCD81 LEL was confirmed by transmembrane domain prediction (DAS-TM filter [37]. all constructs contained a tandem hemagglutinin (HA) tag fused to the C-terminus. PCR products were cloned into the pWPI_BLR lentiviral vector. PCR products were cloned into the pWPI_BLR vector by Gibson assembly according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. hepatoma cell lines Huh-7.5 [38] expresses hCD81, and Lunet N#3 [39]. CHO745 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and 10 mM Hepes at 37 \u00b0C. lentiviral particles with tetraspanin chimera and point mutant encoding proviral pWPI plasmids with blasticidin resistance were generated by triple transfection of HEK 293T cells. immunofluorescence analysis and Confocal Microscopy Cells were grown on poly(l)-Lysine coated cover slips at a density of 4.5 104 cells per 24-well for 24 h. stained with mouse anti-hCD81 (JS-81, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA, 0.2 g/mL) and rabbit anti-HA (H6908, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, 0.25 g/mL anti-hCD81-APC (BD, JS-81, 20 L per 1 106 cells in 200 L final volume) or isotype controls (BD, 20 L per test for fluorophore conjugates or 1 g/mL for unconjugated antibodies) for 20 min on ice. cells were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 1% FCS. cell culture infectious HCV (Jc1, JcR2A and intergenotypic chimeras) infection and JFH-1 subgenome replication assays were performed. in vitro transcribed HCV genomes were electroporated into hepatoma cells. infectivity was determined by luciferase activity measurement in cell lysates at 72 h post infection (hpi) membrane fusion was induced by a 5 min wash with pH 5 citric acid buffer. Background infection was assessed by a 5 min wash with pH 7 citric acid buffer. infectivity was measured as luciferase activity at 48 hpi. culture infectious dose (TCID50) was calculated based on Kaerber and Spearman [49,50]. a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. hLEL tetraspanin chimeras were named according to the origin of the respective tetraspanin backbone domain. chimeric hCD81 molecules carried a tandem hemagglutinin (HA) tag at their C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Figure 1A,B and Table 1). Chimeras had a similar size (233\u2013242 aa) as hCD81 (236 aa), except hTSN32 (317 aa). hCD81 236 100% hCD81 236 100% xtCD81 237 72% xt 235 90% drCD81 236 64% dr 237 87% hCD9 228 45% h 233 73% dmTSP96F 268 27% dm 231 58% hCD82 267 26% hCD82 238 61% ceTSP9 233 25% ce 242 60% hTSN32 320 15% CHO745 cells transduced with SR-BI served as additional positive control. both eE2 from H77 and J6 bound to cells expressing SR-BI. the reduced binding of eE2 to the ce chimera correlated with the reduced chimera cell surface expression level. all surface expressed hCD81 chimeras bound eE2 from SR-BI to a degree that correlated with the number of chimera positive cells. each histogram shows fluorescence intensities of untreated cells (grey) and cells after Alexa-647 eE2 binding (white); (B\u2013E) Quantitation of eE2 binding to CHO745 cells expressed as MFI of Alexa-647. Lunet N#3 cells carrying an empty vector (Ctrl) or the full-length parental hCD81 construct served as negative and positive control. endogenous CD81 in Huh-7.5 cells was 2.8 Da smaller than HA-tagged wt CD18 as expected. immunoblots and histograms are representative of at least three independent experiments and histograms show 30,000 cells per measurement. we further assessed the subcellular localization of the seven chimeras in Lunet N#3 cells by confocal microscopy. anti-HA antibody (red), anti-p230 antibody (green) as Golgi marker and DAPI (blue). hCD81 chimera expressing Lunet N#3 cells with lentiviral pseudoparticles displaying the HCV genotype 1a (H77) glycoproteins on their surface. all cell lines conferred VSV G mediated pseudotype entry with similar efficiency. the hCD81 backbone influences HCV pseudoparticle infectivity. chimera expressing Lunet N#3 cells and Huh-7.5 cells were transduced with lentiviral pseudoparticles encoding Firefly luciferase and displaying the glycoproteins of HCV (strain H77) or VSV. dr chimera rendered Lunet N#3 cells similarly susceptible (2000 RLU) as full-length hCD81 (5000 RLU) the xt and hCD9 chimeras less efficiently supported HCVcc infection (700 RLU and 200 RLU, respectively) cells were infected for 72 h at an MOI of 0.5. infectivity of non-reporter full-length HCV (Jc1) in hCD81 chimera expressing cells. cells were infected with intergenotypic chimeric viruses. at 72 hpi, cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity as measure of HCV infectivity. the HCV genotype 2a susceptibility (normalized to hCD81 expressing Lunet N#3 cells) is plotted on the y axis and the identity of the respective CD81 chimera to hCD81 on the x axis. human coronavirus 229E (CoV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infected hCD81 or tetraspanin chimera expressing Lunet N#3 cells with equal efficiencies. thus, tetraspanin chimera expression in Lunet N#3 cells did not affect generic cellular functions required for virus infection. genotype one through five chimeras reflected the genotype 2a HCVcc phenotype in efficient usage of dr and xt and intermediate usage of hCD9 backbone domains. genotype six and seven chimeric viruses failed to use the xt and hCD9 backbones, respectively, for infection. the non-functional chimeras, dm and ce, showed high sequence divergence throughout most backbone domains. the degree of sequence homology in TM4 correlated with the observed HCV susceptibility phenotype. hCD81 residues predicted to be important for CLDN1 interaction were fully conserved in the here tested tetraspanin chimeras. a glutamate residue (E219) in TM4 of hCD81 lacks in the hCD9 chimera. hCD81 dm-TM4 chimera cell line was impaired in HCV infection but not as strongly as the dm cell line, suggesting that TM4 is a HCV susceptibility determinant. tetraspanins hCD9 (45% amino acid sequence identity with hCD81), hCD82 (26%) and hTSN32 (15%), xenopus tropicalis (xt, 72%), Danio rerio the resulting hLEL tetraspanin chimeras were named according to the origin of the respective tetraspanin backbone domain (e.g., xt for the hCD81 LEL\u2013xtCD81 backbone chimera) the resulting hLEL tetraspanin chimeras displayed amino acid sequence percent identities to parental full-length hCD81. quantitation of hCD81 surface staining depicted as percentage of positive cells or (E) as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) the histograms show one out of three representative experiments with 30,000 cells per measurement. the hTSN32 and hCD82 chimeras were undetectable. the ce chimera showed reduced levels of 40% positive cells. the hTSN32 and hCD82 chimeras were undetectable. the deletion of HVR1 from genotype 2a (J6) eE2 enhanced binding to the hCD81 chimeras. binding to the hCD9 chimera increased three-fold for HVR1 J6 eE2 as compared to wildtype J6 eE2. binding to the hCD81 LEL was not increased. hCD81-Tetraspanin chimeras are expressed on the surface of human hepatoma cells. we transduced hCD81-negative Lunet N#3 human hepatoma cells with the chimeric constructs. all chimeras were detected in whole cell lysates by immunoblot. immunoblots and histograms are representative of at least three independent experiments. hCD81 chimeras localized to the cell surface and to intracellular compartments including the Golgi apparatus. hCD81 chimera expressing tetraspanin chimeras stained with anti-hCD81 antibody. cells were permeabilized and stained with anti-hCD81 antibody. hCD81 backbone influences HCV Pseudoparticle infectivity. ce and hCD9 chimeras conferred tenfold lower entry levels than hCD81. ce chimera expressing cells showed strongly reduced HCV entry efficiency. hCD81 backbone influences HCV pseudoparticle infectivity. all experiments were performed at least thrice and are represented as mean + SD of three independent biological replicates (A) or technical triplicates (B). to test if the hCD81 backbone affected HCV lipoviroparticle entry, we infected backbone chimera cells with cell culture derived HCV (HCVcc) all tested proteins in particular hCD9 and dm chimeras showed a positive correlation of homology and infectivity. hCD81 backbone determines HCV infectivity, but not human coronavirus and VSV infectivity. fusion inhibitor flunarizine (Inh.) served as control. data shown as mean + SD (SEM in (F) of three to five independent biological replicates. dm and ce chimeras failed to support HCV entry. dr and xt chimeras supported HCV entry. dm and ce chimeras failed to support HCV entry. tetraspanin backbones fail to support post-binding and endocytosis-independent HCV entry steps. chimeric viruses failed to use the xt and hCD9 backbones, respectively, for infection. functional chimeras (xt and dr) differed in homology profiles from non-functional chimeras. high sequence conservation was observed in transmembrane domain four. hCD81 amino acids are colored according to the side chain hydrophobicity. a glutamate residue in TM4 of hCD81, which forms hydrogen bonds with cholesterol, lacks in the hCD9 chimera with intermediate receptor function. hCD81 residues predicted to be important for CLDN1 interaction were fully conserved in the here tested tetraspanin chimeras [21]. to test for the role of E219 in HCV infection, we generated cell lines expressing E219Q, E219A and E219S point mutations. the latter two reflecting the residues in ce and dm chimeras. hCD81 backbone domains are more resistant to sequence alterations than the LEL. backbones with moderate sequence similarity to hCD81 can fully substitute the hCD81 function in HCV entry. dm chimera cell surface expression levels were as high as for endogenous hCD81. a possible function of the hCD81 backbone may be the interaction with proteins or lipids essential for HCV uptake. this is in line with previous findings of a role of TM3 and TM4 in HCV infection. dm and ce chimeras, which express glutamate in TM4, are strongly impaired in HCV receptor function. tetraspanins (26% and 15% amino acid identity) in our panel of seven tetraspanins (Table 1). this may suggest that the hCD81 LEL can only be inserted into tetraspanins with a minimum threshold sequence identity. a hCD82 backbone chimera was reported to show low but detectable levels of surface expression in CHO and Huh-7w7 cells. non-LEL regions of chimeras may interact differently from homologous LEL and non-LEL regions. chimera tetraspanin networks may be altered and not fully reflect those of the full-length proteins in the corresponding species environment. the endogenous cellular function of CD81 has been characterized in detail in B and T cells. this function critically relies on CD81 interactions with additional proteins of the B and T cell receptor complex. in hepatoma cells, the endogenous function of CD81 is less well defined. truncated variants of hCD81 and the chimeric tetraspanins were insensitive to hCD81 antibodies. the truncated variants were insensitive to hCD81 antibodies. the truncated variants were insensitive to hCD81 antibodies. hCD81 backbone requirements were mostly similar for all genotypes. however, genotype 2 tolerated slightly more changes in the backbone than the remaining six genotypes. this is in line with the strong cell culture adaptation of genotype 2 strains."}
