{"summary": "MERS-CoV was first identified in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in October 2012 in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. a hospital-associated outbreak of respiratory illness in Jordan from April 2012 was found to be caused by MERS-CoV after retrospective testing of samples saved from case-patients. as of 10 August 2017, there have been 2040 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV from 27 countries reported to the world health organization. serological samples from as early as the 1980s show that camels in the Middle East and northern Africa have antibodies to MERS-CoV or a very similar virus. these seroprevalence results do not hold true for Bactrian camels or for dromedaries from other regions such as Australia or Kazakhstan. another study sequenced 10 different camel MERS-CoVs from clade B. a sixth clade B lineage as well as a camel MERS-CoV within clade A. recombination signatures delineate five major lineages with the recent MERS-CoV from the Republic of Korea outbreak. previous tests of 7803 camels from february to march 2014 from zoos, public escorts, slaughterhouses and the borders with. Saudi Arabia and South Korea. a total of 376 nasal swabs were collected during week 1 from a livestock market and screened for MERS-CoV by PCR. these included 210 dromedaries that originated from local farms within Abu Dhabi Emirate, 106 camels from Oman and 60 camels of unknown origin. after week 1, positive camels from pens 17, 19 and 20 were microchipped and sampled. the fluidigm Access Array was used to set up and perform one-step PCR with reverse transcription on 48 wells. resulting amplicon pools from each sample were sheared from 800\u20131200 bp to 200\u2013300 bp using a Covaris M220 sonicator. sequencing data were analyzed using a custom workflow in CLC Genomics Workbench 8.5. thirty-two pairs of nested PCR assays span the genome were designed based on alignment of available MERS-CoV genomes. positive bands of the expected size that had strong signal were cleaned up using Exonuclease I (New England Biolabs) and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Roche) to detect potential recombination sequences, we used RDP,45 GENECOV,46 Chimera47 and 3Seq48 methods. only events detected by two or more methods were considered recombination. alignment was separated based on breakpoints into non-recombined regions. 210 dromedaries originated from local farms within Abu Dhabi Emirate. 106 camels from Oman and 60 camels of unknown origin. positive camels from pens 17, 19 and 20 were microchipped. sequencing data were analyzed using a custom workflow in CLC Genomics Workbench 8.5. Sequencing adapters were trimmed, then 26 bp were trimmed from each end to remove any residual PCR primer sequence. Purified PCR amplicons were sequenced with the PCR primers in both directions on an ABI Prism 3130 Automated Capillary Sequencer. the Sanger sequence data were analyzed using Sequencher 5.0. ends and low-quality regions were trimmed manually. analysis involved 254 nucleotide sequences. codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. 109 camels were positive (29%) during week 1 of the study. the sequences of these 129 camel MERS-CoV genomes shared >99% identity compared to previously published MERS-CoV sequences. we also compared amino-acid variations in the Spike protein between human and camel MERS-CoVs. however, overall camel-derived sequences show slightly more variations. camel MERS-CoV genomes including 129 full or nearly full MERS-CoV genomes generated in this study were placed throughout clade B of the MERS-CoV tree. a majority of the viruses sequenced in this study fell within the established lineage 5 with human MERS-CoV sequences from the Republic of Korea outbreak and including some that are closely related to human MERS-CoVs. study was throughout the different pens sampled (Supplementary Table 1). Phylogeny of MERS-CoV full genomes or near-full genomes from humans and dromedary camels. 126 complete and 3 nearly complete camel MERS-CoV genomes. lineage 6 has an average number of nucleotide changes compared to previously identified lineages. lineage 7 has an average number of nucleotide changes 43.763\u201360.25 from the other previously published lineages. lineage 7 is comprised of camel MERS-CoVs and one human MERS-CoV. positive camels from pens C17, C19 and C20 were identified via microchip and sampled weekly during weeks 3\u20136 of this study. note pen C20 is not shown as no full genomes were obtained from samples from pen C20. camels 414377 and 414492 were sampled weeks 3 and 4. the sequence of camel 415915 at week 4 had only 5 nucleotide differences compared to camels 415911 and 414500 from lineage 7. camel 416452 had samples available for comparison from weeks 4 through 6 as the full-genome sequence was not available for week 3. a total of 10 well-supported recent recombination events were detected. the percentage of detection from this data set is thus 8.5%. most of the recombination events were represented by a single virus, whereas a single event occurred between lineages 2 and 7. the different colored lines represent the similarity plot of a single recombination event. the gray dotted line marks the potential location of recombination breakpoints. mixed bases were called, with cutoff thresholds of 5, 10, 15 and 35% of high-quality read coverage at each base. the data from each cutoff was averaged and plotted as an average number of minor variants at each cutoff. from 139 total positive samples, full-genome sequences were obtained from 126 samples. nearly full genomes, missing 4 kilobases or less, were obtained from 3 samples for a total of 129 full or nearly full camel MERS-CoV genomes. all sequences have been deposited in GenBank. camel- and human-derived MERS-CoV Spike sequences have amino-acid variations throughout, although overall camel-derived sequences show slightly more variations. genome analysis of the full or near-full-genome sequences identified similar open reading frames (ORFs) and genome structure as compared to the known MERS-CoV except viruses MF598715, MF598719, MF598720, MF598721 and MF598722. ten (8%) of camel MERS-CoV genomes analyzed fell within lineage 2. eight of these camel MERS-CoV sequences formed a monophyletic group with each other within lineage 2. lineage 3 is comprised of a number of human and camel MERS-CoVs. the average number of nucleotide changes between lineages and within lineages was determined with the previously published lineages and new lineages. the lowest average number of nucleotide changes between distinct lineages was 39.3995 and within lineages the average number of nucleotide changes ranged between 15.786 and 27.289. camel genome MF598663 had an average nucleotide change of 27.728 nucleotides compared with lineage 5 viruses. pens C17, C19 and C20 housed a mixture of camels that had MERS-CoV from lineages 5 and 7 based on the sequencing in week 3. camels 414377 and 414492 were sampled weeks 3 and 4. camel 414377 sampled in week 4 had identical sequence to camel 414480 that was housed in the same pen. camels 414485 (Figure 2D), 414500 (Figure 2E) and 415911 (Figure 2F) were sampled weeks 3 and 4 and had between 9 and 24 nucleotide changes between weeks 3 and 4. age 5 virus in week 3; blue camels, camels with lineage 7 virus in week 3; black camels, camels that we were unable to obtain a full-genome sequence from in week 3. x axis, week sampled and camel sampled; y axis, number of nucleotide changes compared to previous week sampled. most of the recombination events were represented by a single virus. one recombination event involved two viruses, MF598652 and MF598677. most of the recombination events were between lineages 5 and 7. 598647 22317\u201330125 Lineage 7 MF598699 9 MF598602 11876 1\u201311876 Lineage 5 MF598657 11876\u201330125 Lineage 7 MF598605 10 MF598712 19113, 26040 1\u201319113, 26040\u201330125 Lineage 5 MF598666 19113\u201326040 Lineage 7 MF598709 Figure 3. Characterization of recombination breakpoints and parental types there were an average of 1.67 (at 35% threshold) variants per sample. there were an average of 20.6 and 53.6 (35% and 15% thresholds, respectively) variants per sample for the camel viruses. the human MERS-CoV genome (KT806051) related to MF598617 was from a case in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. a previously sequenced camel MERS-CoV genome was also only 7 non-overlapping nucleotides different than the 2015 Germany imported case. this study demonstrates that livestock markets may actively participate in the spread of MERS-CoV among camels and/or humans. phylogenetic tree represented four lineages previously identified by Sabir et al.21 as well as two new lineages (lineages 6 and 7) lineage 5 sequences include human MERS-CoVs from the Republic of Korea outbreak as well as human cases from Saudi Arabia. previous studies have sampled camels at multiple time points and sequenced MERS-CoV. samples collected from the same animals a month apart were genetically identical. previous studies have sampled camels at multiple time points. if this were the case, each week the predominant virus could change. we sequenced different viruses at different time points from the same animal. this was supported by the fact that highly similar MERS-CoV were clustered in the same pen. recent studies also support recombination of MERS-CoV in camels. one recombination event was detected in two samples, representing circulation of a common recombinant ancestor among camels. a large population of MERS-CoV quasispecies within camels could lead to highly divergent and novel coronaviruses. the large population of MERS-CoV quasispecies within camels coupled with the known circulation of other coronaviruses in camels."}
