{"summary": "virological surveillance was undertaken in reference laboratories of the seven French Defence Zones. a total of 1,815 patients were tested (including 236 patients infected H1N1sw virus) distribution in age groups was found to be similar to that previously reported for seasonal H1N1. the first cases of the new H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (H1N1sw) in metropolitan France were detected in April 2009 in patients returning from Mexico. this included the detection and characterization of influenza viruses, the evaluation of rapid Influenza detection tests (RIDTs) detection of the new virus and the investigation of grouped cases. samples were collected between April 25th, 2009 and august 31st, 2009. a possible case was defined as a person with acute respiratory illness. clusters of acute respiratory illness defined as at least three cases in a week in closed communities were also to be notified. panel C corresponds to all samples (N = 1,815) tested between April 25th 2009 and August 31st 2009, including Point of Care (POC) samples. the first 99 samples collected until June 15th, 2009 using the systematic criteria for suspected cases reported above in the Southern Defence Zone (Panel B) the total of all 1,815 samples collected by our group during the study period (Panel C) 2004 Metapneumovirus 2* UK (1), France (3), Japan (1) Garbino J, Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2003 Respiratory Syncytial Virus A/B 0 / Van Elden L.J.R, J Clin Microbiol. 2003 Human Coronavirus 229E 1* Canada (1) Van Elden L.J.R, J Infect Dis 2004 Human Coronavirus OC43 2 USA (2) Van Elden L.J.R, J Infect Dis 2004 Human Coronavirus a cluster of cases in a summer camp in barcelonnette (Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France) was investigated. possible cases were individuals with acute respiratory syndrome (coughing or dyspnoea) and a general presentation of viral infection (fever >38\u00b0C, or asthenia or myalgia) antibodies to the new H1N1sw virus were detected and quantified by the standard hemagglutination inhibition technique. a subgroup of 300 randomly selected human serum samples was tested using antigens from seasonal influenza viruses. a subgroup of 300 randomly selected human serum samples was tested using antigens from seasonal influenza viruses. Strain OPYFLU-1 was isolated from a case of autochthonous viral transmission (teenager, male) in late July. PCR-fragments of 1,809 (HA gene) and 1,362 nucleotides (NA gene) were obtained and sequenced. analysis of data was performed using an anonymized database. a possible case was defined as a person with acute respiratory illness (>38\u00b0C) or myalgia or asthenia and at least one respiratory symptom (cough or dyspnoea) 280 samples collected from April 25th, 2009 to July 13th, 2009 using the systematic criteria for suspected cases reported above in the Southern Defence Zone (Panel B) all samples were tested for the presence of Influenza A virus using a pan-influenza A real time PCR technique as described elsewhere [3] and a second real time PCR specific for the new H1N1 variant [1]. the number of cases, the geographical origin of patients returning from abroad and the references for molecular diagnosis are indicated. the number of cases, the geographical origin of patients returning from abroad and the references for the methods used for molecular diagnosis are indicated. RIDTs During the period of study, 1808 samples received in our department were tested using the Directigen 'BD EZ A+B'. the viral load was investigated in 41 positive samples by re-extracting samples and amplifying them simultaneously using a probe-based real time RT-PCR technique. the relationship between viral load and RIDT result was then analysed. antibodies to the new H1N1sw virus were detected and quantified by the standard hemagglutination inhibition technique. a subgroup of 300 randomly selected human serum samples was tested using antigens from seasonal influenza viruses, i.e. one strain of seasonal H1N1 (Marseille-2007), and one strain of seasonal H3N2 (Marseille-2008). Strain OPYFLU-58 was isolated from a case of autochthonous viral transmission (teenager, male) in late July. one-step RT-PCR reactions were performed using the EZ1 Biorobot and the virus mini kit. PCR-fragments of 1,809 (HA gene) and 1,362 nucleotides (NA gene) were obtained and sequenced. the median age was 33 (range: 0\u201376 years) and the m/f sex ratio was 0.94. majority of travellers were in the 20\u201360 years old age group with a limited number of patients under 20 and above 60. the distribution of respiratory viral pathogens detected in age groups is detailed in figure 2B. most cases of H1N1sw infection (11 out of 15, i.e. 73%) were found in the 20\u201360 age group. 20% of cases were identified in the group of patients less than 20 years old. the column in the middle shows the percentage of samples testing positive for H1N1sw in each age group. panel C included all 1,815 nasal swabs tested between April 25th 2009 and august 31st 2009. the median age was 24 (range: 0\u201398 years), i.e. lower than in panels A and B. the number of cases was significantly lower in patients over 40 years old (Panel B, p = 0.005; Panel C, p0.0001) compared with younger patients. the proportion of influenza infections caused by seasonal H3N2 constantly decreased during the period of the study. sensitivity of the RIDT test decreased with viral load. no positive result was obtained for samples with viral loads 0.11 million copies/mL. relationship between viral load and results of RIDT was supported by statistical tests. an alert was issued, and a case-management procedure was implemented. the investigation was performed 2 days after the alert in a period characterized by the rapid decline of the outbreak. the global attack rate was 38% in children, 37.5% in adults managing children and 25% in technical agents. the prevalence of antibodies to the new H1N1sw variant in patients under and above the age of 40 is significantly lower in patients under the age of 40. however, no statistical relationship could be identified between individual titres of antibodies to H1N1sw and seasonal H3N2. a similar age-dependent fluctuation of prevalence was observed for all HI titres. the prevalence is given for HI titres 1/40, 1/80 and 1/160. the label of each strain includes the GenBank number, the country of origin, the time of collection and the amino acid pattern at residue positions 106 and 248 of the neuraminidase protein. the label of each strain includes the country of origin, the time of collection and the amino acid pattern at residue positions 106 and 248 of the neuraminidase protein. the pandemic influenza virus was found in 15% of cases but rhinoviruses, pneumoviruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, enteroviruses, polyomaviruses, and parainfluenza viruses could also be identified. most of the cases of H1N1sw infection were found in the 20\u201360 age group. 20% of cases were identified in the group of patients less than 20 years old. the distribution in age groups is reported in figure 3A for 270 patients of known age. the sex ratio was 1.06 and the median age was 33 (range: 0\u201390 years) the distribution in age groups is reported in figure 3A for 270 patients of known age. panel C included all 1,815 nasal swabs tested between April 25th 2009 and August 31st 2009. the highest rate of positive H1N1sw diagnosis was observed in the age group 10\u201319 years old. Approximately 50% of all infections were found in patients under the age of 20 (median age of H1N1sw positive patients: 21; sex ratio: 1.07) and very few cases were identified in patients over 60 years old. the relationship between age, viral load and result of RIDTs was investigated. amongst 233 samples positive for H1N1sw based on RT-PCR techniques, the distribution of positive RIDTs in age groups was examined. investigation of Virus Infection in a summer camp 45 persons met the definition of probable or confirmed cases. they all reported coughing and 82% reported fever >38\u00b0C. there was no significant difference in terms of age and sex between ill and non-ill children. the global attack rate was 38% in children, 37.5% in adults managing children and 25% in technical agents. however, this attack rate was different in the different groups varying from 19% in group A to 57.5% in group D. one nasal swab could be sampled from 95% of probable cases and 85% of \u201cnon-cases\u201d. no statistical relationship could be identified between individual titres of antibodies to H1N1sw and seasonal H3N2. prevalence of antibodies to H1N1sw is given for HI titres 1/40, 1/80 and 1/160. prevalence of antibodies to seasonal H3N2 is given for HI titres 1/40, 1/80 and 1/160. OPYFLU-1 and OPYFLU-58 HA protein sequences were identical (with 3 synonymous substitutions) but 2 non-synonymous differences were detected in the NA gene (V106I, N248D) there was no evidence of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors in either strain. the appearance of the H1N1sw pandemic resulted in reinforcement of the surveillance of influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in countries located in the northern hemisphere, this led to a follow up of ILIs during the spring and summer periods. paradoxically, this revealed our limited knowledge concerning the epidemiology of viral respiratory diseases outside the winter epidemic season. in our series, patients with H3N2 infections returned from Australia. it was identified originally in travellers returning from abroad (75% in Panel A, including a majority of adults) or in patients in close contact with them (25%). this pattern was progressively modified and, notably, the number of patients who did not travel and could not identify any link with suspected cases. in the current series the number of cases detected in patients over 60 years old is remarkably low. less than 1% in both Panels B and C whilst this age group provided 10.5% of the patients tested in these two panels. this distribution of cases in age groups is of special interest in light of HI serological results. individuals without immunity to the virus do exist in this age group. their exact number is unknown since the antibody level (HI titre) that may provide effective protection is undetermined. but the occurrence of a low incidence does not eliminate during the outbreak the risk of complicated forms and high mortality. the highest attack rates of seasonal influenza observed in communities of schoolchildren are accounted for by the shedding of higher titres of virus for a longer period than other patient groups [21], [22] similar results were observed suggesting that clinical attack rates in children under 15 years of age in la Gloria were twice those observed in adults. a majority of strains harboured the V106-N248 pattern at the origin of the outbreak. after may 2009, the decline of V106-N248 strains was concomitant with the emergence of I106-D248 strains."}
