{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an RNA virus belonging to paramyxoviridae family. it was identified by researchers in the Netherlands in 2001 as an important cause of respiratory infections that affect all age groups. clinical manifestations are similar to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) primarily leading to pneumonia and bronchiolitis. a cost effective approach was adopted in June 2009, to only test specimens negative for both influenza A and B by either singleplex or multiplex real time PCR assays. Exceptions include samples submitted from a provincial influenza-like-illness surveillance program (Tarrant Viral Watch) and samples from patients with severe illness and admission to the intensive care units. results and discussion Using DIAL, 36,824 specimens were identified as positive for one or more respiratory virus during the study period. the majority of the specimens were collected from the upper respiratory tract as nasopharyngeal/nasal/throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates 84% (n=22,013), 12% (n=3076) as respiratory samples with unspecified source. the highest number of specimens received was from patients less than 6 months old. mixed infection was detected in 15% of specimens tested positive for hMPV. mixed infection was most commonly found in specimens from patients younger than six months. 13 12 70 to 79 years 595 102 (17) 0 0 80 to 89 years 562 104 (19) 2 2 90 to 105 years 236 37 (16) 0 0 * 13 specimens with unknown age group were excluded from the binary logistic regression analysis. p0.05 comparing mono versus mixed infection for hMPV among the age groups. denovirus 1317 606 (46) 35 9 Coronavirus NL63 381 105 (28) 29 7 Coronavirus 229E 349 110 (32) 15 4 Coronavirus OC43 293 67 (23) 7 2 Coronavirus HKU1 263 82 (31) 2 1 * Influenza A and B positive samples were excluded from the analysis. 0 1 3 0 0 0 60 to 69 years 13 9 1 1 0 0 0 1 4 0 70 to 79 years 0 NA NA NA NA 80 to 89 years 2 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 90 to 105 years 0 NA NA NA NA * Five specimens with unknown age group were not tabulated Some specimens in these subsets had more than one virus identified as co-existing. ERV and hMPV remained closely linked across all age groups. mixed infection with hMPV most commonly found in the age group less than 6 months old. ERV was still the dominant virus found to be mixed with hMPV. the mixed infection of hMPV and ERV followed the circulatory pattern of hMPV but differed from ERV. a recent study in the uk showed a lower prevalence of influenza A (H1N1) in patients positive for hMPV, ADV, RSV, PIV and rhinovirus with statistical significance for this relationship. Specimens tested positive for influenza A were also subtyped for seasonal H3, seasonal H1 and pandemic H1N1 (2009) genes by RT-PCR. only specimens tested negative for both influenza A and B were tested using the RVP classic assay. hMPV is significantly more likely to be identified in mono infection (86%) compared with ADV, four types of CRV, PIV, and RSV with the exception of ERV."}
