{"summary": "surfactin exerts antiviral effects by inhibiting viral membrane fusion. membrane fusion is essential for enveloped viruses to invade host cells. surfactin is a cyclic lipopeptide naturally produced by various strains of Bacillus subtilis. a series of similar lipopeptides were designed and synthesized using surfactin as a template. these analogues differ from each other in the number of hydrophobic amino acids, number of hydrophilic groups, charge properties, amino acid chirality, position of hydrophilic amino acids, and aromatic groups in the fatty chain. L-Val- NH2 SLP2 Palmityl- L-Glu- L-Val- D-Leu- L-Asp- D-Leu- NH2 SLP3 Palmityl- L-Glu- L-Val- D-Leu- L-Asp- D-Leu- NH2 SLP5 Palmityl- L-Glu- L-Val- D-Leu- L-Asp- NH2 SLP10 Heptaalkyl 100 PFU of PEDV mixed with an equal volume of SLP in DMEM or DMEM alone were incubated 10 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. cells were washed 3 times with DMEM then overlaid with DMEM/1% agar and incubated 72 hours at 37 \u00b0C. 1% Triton X-100 was used for the positive control. each sample was run in triplicate. critical micelle concentration Surface tensions were measured using a surface tensiometer. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. PEDV nucleic acid levels were assessed by measuring the viral nucleoprotein (N) using qRT-PCR with the TaKaRa SYBR Green qPCR Kit (TaKaRa) lipopeptide synthesis All lipopeptides were synthesized by Synpeptide Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) the purity of all synthetic lipopeptide samples was over 90% by HPLC. NH2 SLP9 Palmityl- L-Glu- L-Asp- L-Val- D-Leu- D-Leu- NH2 SLP10 Heptaalkyl-biphenyl-acid- L-Glu- L-Val- D-Leu- L-Asp- D-Leu- NH2 Cells and virus Cercopithecus aethiops kidney epithelial cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM the optical density at 540 nm was measured using a microplate reader. 1% Triton X-100 was used for the positive control. each sample was run in triplicate. the inoculum was removed and 1 mL of 37 \u00b0C DMEM was added to each well, cells were then placed at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator. at the indicated time points, SLP5, surfactin, or dielaidoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine was added dropwise to cells or virus to a final concentration of 50 g/ml, 20 g/ml, or 5 g/ml. western blot lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE then transferred to PVDF membrane (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TBS containing 0.01% Tween-20 (TBST) then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with anti-PEDV N-protein monoclonal antibody. SLP6 replaces the two acidic amino acids of SLP3 with lysine (a basic amino acid) the two hydrophilic amino acids of SLP8 are distant from each other, but are in close proximity in SLP9. 2, SLP4, SLP6 and SLP8 have a higher potency than surfactin. anti-PEDV activity plotted as a function of lipopeptide concentration. images were taken after collecting a portion of the supernatant for quantification of hemolysis. 100% represents the OD obtained using 0.1% Triton X-100-treated red blood cells. SLP8 and SLP5 have the highest and second-highest SI values respectively. CMCs were determined for SDS, surfactin, and SLPs by surface tension. the intersection of the linear regression lines corresponds to the CMC value. Fig 4. Critical micelle concentrations of the SLPs. s that combine greater antiviral activity with lower cytotoxicity are still to be found, and the specific structure-activity relationship needs to be further elucidated. the experiment was designed to examine events early in the infection process. time-of-addition experiments were repeated three times. samples were harvested at 12 hpi. the PEDV nucleoprotein was detected by Western-blot. the two hydrophilic amino acids of SLP8 are distant from each other. SLP 10 is identical to SLP3 except for a diphenyl group in the fatty acid moiety. in all cases, SLP purity exceeded 90%. anti-PEDV activity plotted as a function of lipopeptide concentration. % remaining PFU represents plaque counts in the control (no lipopeptide) sample. OD540 represents the OD obtained using 0.1% Triton X-100-treated red blood cells. the selectivity index was determined as the ratio of the 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) to the 50% effective concentration (EC50). linear regressions were performed independently using the data on the descending part of the curve below the CMC and the equilibrium part above the CMC. the intersection of the linear regression lines corresponds to the CMC value, (shown by the dotted lines). Fig 4. Critical micelle concentrations of the SLPs. EC50-CMC, (B) CC50-CMC, and (C) CC50-EC50 for surfactin and SLPs. dotted lines show linear regression for each scattergram. none of the correlations are significant. the PEDV nucleoprotein was detected by Western-blot, and (C) quantitated by band intensity relative to the internal control, GAPDH. cationic properties of synthetic lipopeptides are thought to be related to their antibacterial and hemolytic activities. cationic properties of synthetic lipopeptides are thought to be related to their antibacterial and hemolytic activities. SLP5 equaled and SLP8 exceeded surfactin\u2019s anti-PEDV activity. both compounds had greatly reduced hemolytic activity. the structure of SLP5 is distinguished by its linear lipopeptide and the additional carboxyl group at the C' of the peptide."}
