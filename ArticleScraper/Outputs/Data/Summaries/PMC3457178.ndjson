{"summary": "the order Chiroptera comprises two suborders, frugivorous Megachiroptera and insectivorous Microchiroptera. there are 1,240 bat species widely distributed all over the world. Mainland China harbors 120 bat species that belong to 30 genera and 7 families. the application of NGS to bats is expected to provide more information for identifying novel viruses and characterizing the range of viruses present in different samples. we collected pharyngeal and anal swab samples from 11 insectivorous bat species from six provinces in china for metagenomic analyses. samples were then pooled by adding 1 ml from each maintenance medium sample into one fresh sample tube. the 11 pooled samples were then separately filtered through a 0.45-m-pore-size polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore) to remove eukaryotic cell- and bacterium-sized particles. 20 l of the first-strand cDNA was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. then at 75\u00b0C for 10 min in the presence of 5 U of Klenow fragment. sequence-independent PCR amplification was conducted with 5 l of the double-stranded cDNA template in a final reaction volume of 50 l. reads filtered with Illumina's Consensus Assessment of Sequence and Variation (CASAVA) software. reads with similarity to the sequencing adaptor and the primer K sequence. only reads that passed the quality control were considered valid sequences. genome sequences were obtained by assembling amplified fragments and sequence reads. inverse PCR was used to determine the complete circular genome of each virus on the basis of the fragments obtained in the reads-based PCR. heminested PCR primers were used to amplify conserved regions (387 nucleotides [nt) of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of AstVs (8, 66) the expected products were then gel extracted and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. the accession number for bat BoV is JQ814851. the accession number for bat pestV is JQ814854. the accession number for bat pestV is JQ814854. 100 l of the resuspended pellet from each pooled sample was digested in a cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes. viral DNA and RNA were simultaneously isolated and eluted from the enzyme-digested solution into 60 l AVE buffer with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit. DNA libraries based on the PCR products described above were constructed according to manufacturer's instructions (Illumina) each library was sequenced with a GA II sequencer for a single read of 81 bp in length. initial image analysis and base calling were performed with the default parameters. the taxonomies of the aligned reads with the best BLAST scores (E 105) from 11 viromes were exported from MEGAN 4. reads from different viromes are labeled with different colors. the number of reads in each family is given after the family name. the complete open reading frames (ORFs) of glycoprotein B (gB) and DNA polymerase (DPOL) were obtained with the genome walking kit (TaKaRa) for bat PVs and the CV, inverse PCR was used to determine the complete circular genome of each virus on the basis of the fragments obtained in the reads-based PCR. reference viral sequences were downloaded from GenBank. we used the MEGA program (52) to align nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences with the MUSCLE package. the best substitution model was then evaluated with the Model Selection package. all pharyngeal swab and anal swabs in the six provinces were in or close to human gathering places. a total of 29,272,685 sequence reads of 81 bp in length were obtained from the 11 bat species. a total of 353,973 sequences were best matched with viral proteins (1.2% of total sequence reads) the remaining 19,584,097 sequence reads had no significant similarity to any amino acid sequence in NR. most of the sequence reads related to mammalian viruses showed low percentages of nucleotide. over 80 HV species are currently registered by the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) these species are classified into three subfamilies (Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaherpesvirinae) within the family Herpesviridae. GHV-1 and TrBHV-1 showed the highest similarity with bat BHV-2. among betaherpesviruses, RfBHV-1 showed high similarity to human HV 6. among gammaherpesviruses, MrGHV-1 was most similar to saimiriine HV 2. phylogenetic tree was based on deduced amino acid sequences of concatenated gB and DPOL proteins. two novel bat gammaherpesviruses are labeled with black triangles. two novel bat betaherpesviruses are marked with black triangles. MrPV-1 contained five clear ORFs that encoded early proteins E6 (184 aa), E1 (698 aa) and E2 (357 aa) the E6 protein contained two characteristic zinc binding domains (C-X2-C-X29-C-X2-C) separated by 36 aa.
