{"summary": "a new avian-origin influenza virus emerged in eastern china in late march 2013. this virus has infected at least 240 people and killed 60 people. the virus has awakened global concern as a potential pandemic threat. the first known human H7N9 infections were reported on 31 March 2013, with two cases in Shanghai and one in the neighboring province of Anhui. by 22 April 2013, the world health organization (WHO) tallied 104 confirmed cases, over an expanded area including neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. a first range-wide ENM-based analysis of H7N9 cases in china. a real-time H7N9 reporting system was launched. 96 occurrence points varied in terms of spatial clumping. we used a maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent; [14]) to estimate an ecological \u2018niche\u2019 for the H7N9 virus. this approach eliminates extreme values that may result from erroneous identifications or georeferencing. a final niche model was calibrated using all of the 77 records. a real-time H7N9 reporting system was launched. only the laboratory confirmed cases were used in this study. we used a maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent; [14]) to estimate an ecological \u2018niche\u2019 for the H7N9 virus. this approach eliminates extreme values that may result from erroneous identifications or georeferencing. results Most H7N9 cases have been reported from Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces, from where occurrences were aggregated. occurrences in Beijing, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces were more sporadic and scattered. in final models, models based on both environmental datasets identified a particularly suitable zone in east-central China. Suitable areas in the north were distributed less continuously, while suitable areas in the south were only along the coast. western Taiwan was also identified as highly suitable by models based on both environmental datasets. many aspects of the natural history, geography, and ecology of H7N9 virus remain poorly known or unknown. ecological niche modeling approaches are offering novel views of the geography of potential for disease transmission [18]. study reveals high-risk zones for H7N9 in east-central china. the current distributional pattern suggests that H7N9 would be in previously affected and possibly neighboring areas, and potentially in travelers from these areas returning to other countries. supporting information table S1 H7N9 case occurrences used in ecological niche modeling."}
