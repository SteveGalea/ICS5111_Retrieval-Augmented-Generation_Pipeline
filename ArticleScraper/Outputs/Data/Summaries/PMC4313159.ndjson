{"summary": "REPLY Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was first detected in u.s. swine in April 2013. we published a paper in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology in January 2014. we suggested that the full-length S gene or the S1 portion is appropriate for sequencing. PEDV S, M, and E proteins are three membrane proteins. the protein is postulated to harbor epitopes to induce neutralizing antibodies. the coronavirus M protein plays a pivotal role in the viral assembly process together with the E protein (10, 11) swine practitioners and diagnosticians frequently asked which gene(s) of PEDV is appropriate for sequencing to study the relatedness and genetic diversity of PEDVs in the united states. the whole-genome sequences should be determined to truly reflect the genetic profiles of PEDVs, but it is too expensive and time-consuming to perform whole-genome sequencing. the structures of phylogenetic trees based on full-length S or the S1 portion were similar. 18 U.S. PEDVs clustered together, whereas 2 U.S. PEDV variants formed a distinct cluster. however, in the phylogenetic trees of N (Fig. 1C) and ORF3 (Fig. 1D), all 20 U.S. PEDVs formed one cluster, indicating that U.S. PEDVs include at least two genotype otide sequences of 48 PEDVs (20 U.S. PEDVs and 28 non-U.S. PEDVs) the trees were constructed using the distance-based neighbor-joining method of the software MEGA5.2."}
