{"summary": "severe acute lung injury is characterized by acute progression of respiratory symptoms and signs, bilateral diffuse infiltrates on chest imaging, and severe hypoxemia. ARDS is associated with poor prognosis and higher mortality, and diagnostic hypoxemia is defined as decreased arterial PaO2/FiO2 ratio. pathogens themselves, including viruses and mycoplasmas, are believed to be responsible for lung cell injury. the precise mechanism of lung injury in pneumonia at the molecular level remains unknown. the exact mechanism of lung injury in pneumonia at the molecular level remains unknown. the pathogens causing pneumonia may be the cause of ARDS, and the immunopathogenesis of ARDS may be the same as that of pneumonia. the extent of the area of lung injury may determine the clinical phenotype of the lung injury. the majority of patients infected with respiratory pathogens are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. among these patients, only a small proportion developed progressive pneumonia and ARDS. previously healthy patients can also develop ARDS in various respiratory infections, including influenza virus infection. ARDS may vary according to etiologic agents and the stage of the disease. however, typical pathologies of advanced ARDS patients and animals show similar findings. the state of distribution of immune cells and immune proteins in pneumonia lesions may inform the etiology and severity of lung disease. nearly all infectious diseases, including pneumonia, may have a primary infection site where pathogens replicate. extracellular bacterial infections (such as pneumococcal pneumonia and scarlet fever) and intracellular viral infections and small bacterial infections (such as mycoplasma pneumonia) may have initial foci for the replication of pathogens. pathogens are detected around a replication site on the upper respiratory tract in respiratory diseases, including influenza viruses, corona viruses, mycoplasmas, and legionellas. specific antibodies against pathogens are not detected for at least three to four days after the onset of fever and clinical symptoms. this finding suggests that lung injury is associated with T cell activation rather than with pathogens. there are critical organ-specific diseases that can seriously damage whole organs within a short period of time, including ARDS of the lungs. fulminating hepatitis (liver), acute myocarditis (heart), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (kidneys), acute necrotizing pancreatitis (pancreas), acute encephalopathy (including Reye syndrome) (brain), acute encephalopathy (including Reye syndrome rhabdomyolysis can cause acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation of the blood, or heart arrhythmia. this assumption may explain non-pathogen-induced ARDS, such as what occurs from blunt trauma, multiple tissue injuries, pancreatitis, severe burns. etiologic substances are controlled by immune cells and immune proteins. immune systems of mammals have been classified as innate (or natural) and adaptive (or specific) immune systems. both types of immune cells are found in nearly all pathologic lesions from infectious diseases, rheumatic diseases, cancers, transplantation rejection, and regeneration of tissues (keloids) both types of immune systems cells communicate with each other through major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) and protein-networks (cytokines) during events of external and internal insults. abnormalities in either type of immune cell or blockage of cross-talk proteins in immune reactions will result in delayed removal of pathogens in respiratory infections. binding produces anti-pathogenic proteins, such as interferons and interferon-related proteins, proinflammatory cytokines, and other proteins. the proteins produced by innate immune system cells may affect the function of adaptive immune system cells. natural antibodies, as particular parts of the innate immune system, may also control non-protein substances. innate immune system cells such as neutrophils, non-specific T cells, non-specific antibodies, and possibly immune peptides may comprise the first-line effectors for control of various-sized substances. non-specific T cells and non-specific antibodies are not as effective as specific effectors in their particular tasks. non-specific T cells and non-specific antibodies are not as effective as specific effectors in their particular tasks. early antimicrobial therapy is critical to reduce the number of pathogens and pathogen-originated substances, thereby inducing early recovery from the disease. antibiotic treatment is recommended as soon as possible when bacterial infection is suspected. some patients with CAP can experience complications such as lung abscess, empyema, pulmonary gangrene, and necrotizing pneumonia. clinical course and computed tomography findings are relatively similar among patients affected with different pathogens. similar findings are observed in respiratory virus infections. some patients, however, are shown to be rapidly progressive to ARDS despite early antiviral treatment. in the 2009 influenza pandemic, we observed that extensive pneumonic consolidations that had developed rapidly within 48 h after fever onset resolved dramatically within 24 h. this finding suggests there is a critical period for reversible pathologic states, which can be induced by early immune modulators. lymphopenia may be characteristic of severe pneumonia patients infected with respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses, corona viruses, the measles virus, and M. pneumoniae [94,95,96,97] the severity of lymphopenia is correlated with the severity of lung injury [94,97] corticosteroids have multi-potent immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory modes of action on almost all human diseases. corticosteroids may act on hyperactive immune cells that are needed for disease control. immune cells affected by corticosteroids may be rapidly eliminated by apoptosis. early systemic immune-modulator treatment before occurrence of diffuse organ-specific cell injury may be critical, especially in previously healthy immune-competent patients. early systemic immune-modulator therapy, administered as soon as possible, can mitigate rapid disease progression, reduce morbidity, and possibly prevent irreversible total organ destruction. this treatment policy for severe pneumonia or early ARDS can be described as having the same rationale as early antibiotic and antiviral therapies. there is a critical early stage of immune-mediated lung injury which can be reversed with prompt intervention."}
