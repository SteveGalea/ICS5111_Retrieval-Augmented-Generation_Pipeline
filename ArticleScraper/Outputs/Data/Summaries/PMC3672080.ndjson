{"summary": "type I interferons (IFN), mainly IFN-/, are essential to the innate immune system for direct antiviral activity as well as efficient induction of adaptive immune responses. the virus is characterized by an enormous genetic variability with the existence of two genotypes of PRRSV referred as genotype 1 (European) and 2 (North American) pDC are a rare cell type but can produce around 100 times more IFN- than any other cellular type. they are often able to sense viruses in the absence of viral replication. they represent an important candidate cell type for investigating early immune events that could influence early control of virus replication or induction of adaptive antiviral immune response. the prototype VR-2332 is from a severe reproductive and respiratory outbreak with high levels of mortality in a previously PRRSV-negative herd in 2010. the JA-1262 isolate was obtained in 2009 from a midwestern USA sow herd experiencing abortions and PRRSV-infected piglets. cells and pDC enrichment MARC-145 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium. lungs were filled up with approximately one to two liters of PBS containing a 2 concentrated penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep) solution (Gibco, Invitrogen, Switzerland) pigs were isolated by Ficoll-Paque differential centrifugation [34] followed by CD172a (mAb 74-22-15a) enrichment. cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 20 M of -mercaptoethanol. this sorting resulted in a pDC purity of 10%. boxplots indicate median (middle line), 25th and 75th percentiles (boxes), maximum and minimum (whiskers) and the mean values (dotted line) calculated from at least three independent experiments with cells from different animals each performed in culture triplicates. bars in (D) and (E) indicate culture triplicates 1 standard deviation. two million CD172a+ cells were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with LV, 2982 and 3267 PRRSV strains. ELISA measured secreted IFN- after 20 h of incubation. a million CD172a+ cells were seeded in a 48-well plate and infected with LVP23 strain. after 12 h of culture, Brefeledin A (eBioscience, Austria) was added to the cells to block IFN- secretion for 4 h. for the genotype 1 PRRSV we used the prototype VR-2332 [29]. SS144, SS144, MN184, JA-1262 and SY0608 were propagated. lysates from PAM or MARC-145 cells were used as mock-infected controls. all strains were titrated in their propagating cell type by CPE evaluation. MARC-145 cells and PAM were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. PBMC were depleted of monocytes by anti-CD14 (mAb CAM36A, VMRD Inc., Washington, USA) the cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. IFN- was determined by ELISA in supernatants harvested after 20 h. PBMC (D) and CD14-CD4+ monocyte-depleted pDC (E) stimulated with the prototype of genotype 1 LV, LVP23 and CpG-ODN as control. ELISA measured secreted IFN- after 20 h of incubation. two million CD172a+ cells were seeded in 24-well plates. cells were infected with LV, 2982 and 3267 PRRSV strains. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed and permeabilized with 0.3% (wt/vol) saponin. the anti-nucleocapsid mAb SDOW-17A was added during the permeabilization step for 15 min, followed by a wash step with 0.1% (wt/vol) saponin. biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG1 conjugate (SouthernBiotech) and Streptavidin SpectralRed\u00ae (SouthernBiotech) were added to the cells to detect intracellular IFN-. the data were acquired using a FACScalibur and analysed using cellQuest Pro software. genome 1 and 2 PRRSV induce IFN- in pDC. incubation of CD172a+ cells with LV or its MARC-145 cell-adapted form, LVP23, at an MOI of 0.1 did not elicit reproducible IFN- expression. pDC production of IFN- was a universal response to PRRSV. pDC were the source of IFN- in enriched CD172a cells. only a proportion of CD4+ cells among the CD172a+ fraction were IFN- positive after PRRSV or CpG-ODN stimulation. no IFN- expressing cells were observed in the CD172+CD4- cells. UV-inactivated type 1 LVP23 and type 2 VR-2332 PRRSV were used to evaluate if PRRSV-induced IFN- responses in enriched pDC required live virus. the intensity of IFN- production was not altered by UV-inactivation indicating that the pDC response did not require replicating PRRSV. IFN- was determined by ELISA in supernatants harvested after 20 h. cytokines known to modulate macrophage are known to modulate macrophage. PRRSV does not infect pDC PRRSV infects macrophages, MoDC, and monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro. but sorted CD172a+ cell populations of pDC were not permissive to infection. high levels of IFN- were detected in these cultures. one million enriched pDC or two millions MoDC alone were exposed to LV at an MOI of 1 TCID50/cell. histograms were obtained from forward/side scatter gated MoDC treated with mock control (tinted line) or LV (black line) one representative experiment out of two is shown. type 2 isolate VR-2332 inhibited CpG-ODN induced IFN- secretion by 34%. all other isolates, including highly virulent type 2 isolates SS144, MN184 and JA-1262, showed lower levels or no inhibitory activity. we analyzed their ability to directly activate pDC secretion of IFN-. we incubated unsorted PBMCs, CD14+, CD14+CD4- and CD14-CD4+ sorted cells with LV, LVP23, and CpG-ODN as a positive control. no IFN- was detected in CD14+ cells excluding the possibility that monocytes induce IFN- in response to PRRSV. Pseudo-color plot of pDC defined as CD172lowCD4high and CD172+CD4- populations are gated. only gated pDC are positive for intracellular IFN-. PRRSV sensing by pDC does not require live virus. IFN- was determined by ELISA in supernatants harvested after 20 h. bars indicate biological triplicates 1 standard deviation in one representative experiment out of two. FN, Flt3-L, GM-CSF and IL-4 were evaluated for modulation of IFN- secretion. cytokines known to modulate macrophage function were able to promote pDC responses to PRRSV. sorted CD172a+ cell populations of pDC were not permissive to infection. one million MoDC co-cultured with one million of enriched pDC or two millions MoDC alone were exposed to LV at an MOI of 1 TCID50/cell. pDC protect MoDCs from PRRSV infection PRRSV appears to be highly sensitive to type I IFN [12-15] neither type 1 nor type 2 PRRSV isolates strongly inhibit CpG-ODN-induced IFN- by enriched pDC. prototype type 2 strain VR-2332, although more inhibitory than genotype 1 viruses tested, was not as inhibitory as previously reported. the responses observed in vitro are relevant to in vivo conditions. the ability of PRRSV to induce IFN- does not seem to be related to the suppression of TLR9 ligand-induced IFN-. the highly pathogenic Chinese strain, SY0608, induced similar levels of IFN- as did LVP23. PRRSV could induce IL-4 in the serum [20] and IFN- both in the serum [54] and in the lungs [48] of infected pigs. it is known to have an antiviral activity against PRRSV [55], to promote natural killer and cytotoxic T-cell activity. authors declare that they have no competing interests. pDC responses induced by PRRSV are relevant to understanding antiviral immune responses and the pathogenesis of PRRS."}
