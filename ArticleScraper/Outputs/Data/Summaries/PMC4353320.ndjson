{"summary": "healthcare workers may be exposed to people with respiratory viral infections more often than other working adults. participants randomized 1:2 to receive the 2008\u20132009 influenza vaccine or daily prophylaxis with 10 mg of zanamivir during the season. the efficacy of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines in eight randomized controlled trials of adults 18\u201365 years of age was 59%. Neuraminidase inhibitors may also be effective in preventing influenza, with estimated efficacy of 31\u201383%. participants in the antiviral prophylaxis arm were prescribed one 10 mg dose of zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae; GlaxoSmithKline) per day for the influenza season. participants who experienced side effects and discontinued antiviral prophylaxis were given either Fluviral\u00ae or Vaxigrip\u00ae (Sanofi Pasteur, Toronto, ON, Canada) sera were extracted and stored, frozen at 70\u00b0C for later testing. participants with any acute respiratory symptom were asked to have a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab collected by study nurses and to self-collect a mid-turbinate nasal swab. HAIs were performed at Dalhousie university, Halifax, Nova Scotia. laboratory technicians were blinded to the arm to which the participants were assigned. acute respiratory illness was defined as a recent onset of at least two symptoms of which at least one was respiratory. people who discontinued antiviral prophylaxis were re-classified as being in the vaccine arm at 14-days postvaccination. participants were eligible if they were 18\u201369 years old, were available for follow-up during the study period and provided written informed consent. participants in the antiviral prophylaxis arm were prescribed one 10 mg dose of zanamivir per day for the influenza season. participants who experienced side effects and discontinued antiviral prophylaxis were given either Fluviral\u00ae or Vaxigrip\u00ae (Sanofi Pasteur, Toronto, ON, Canada) the influenza season was defined, a priori, as starting when the proportion of all specimens tested for influenza in the province was >3% positive

nurses and to self-collect a mid-turbinate nasal swab. laboratory technicians were blinded to the arm to which the participants were assigned. acute respiratory illness defined as a recent onset of at least two symptoms of which at least one was respiratory. the median age of the participants was 41 years, 69% were female and 21% had a chronic disease. two individuals from the vaccine group and two from the prophylaxis group withdrew from the study prior to the start of the influenza season. nia/07/2009 (H1N1) strain started circulating in Ontario during week 17 (26 April 2009) three individuals discontinued prophylaxis due to side effects. one in week 1 with nausea, vomiting and headache and two people in week 4. all three were vaccinated upon discontinuation. in seasonal vaccines produced for Canada, the A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) strain was used in place of the WHO-recommended A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) strain. only 24% of participants seroconverted to A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), the

study were largely able and willing to use antiviral prophylaxis against influenza for an entire influenza season. 90% of participants took at least 90% of scheduled doses for up to 185 weeks of prophylaxis. 75% of people discontinued the antiviral medication due to side effects. people working in acute care hospitals in Germany had higher odds of reporting ARI during the 2006\u20132007 influenza season than those working for other employers. exposure to an ill family member was reported as a risk factor for influenza for healthcare workers during the 2009 pandemic23, while living with 10,22,23 or being otherwise exposed to children9 was a risk for respiratory illnesses. s. Neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in preventing influenza infections. adults can comply with a schedule of once daily doses for a full season, with a low percentage having to discontinue because of side effects."}
