{"summary": "web search engines have released their own dedicated geographic interfaces. they provide the general public with detailed satellite imagery/aerial photography map layers that were once only available to experts and select user communities. Google Maps and Google Earth released Google Maps (http://maps.google.com/) a third-party Google Maps application plots geocoded photographs to their actual locations on Google Maps. all smugmug RSS feeds are now geo-enabled. if a photo has latitude, longitude, and altitude information, it will show up in all feeds. an MSN Virtual Earth Map Control/API (see http://www.viavirtualearth.com/vve/Dashboard/Default.ashx and http://www.viavirtualearth.com/vve/Resources/Default.notitia.ashx) allows users to create their own custom online maps, and add their own data to MSN Virtual Earth. ESRI's response to all of the recent online consumer geoinformatics services described in this article was to announce its new partnership with National Geographic http://www.nationalgeographic.com/, GlobeXplorer http://www.globexplorer.com/, and TeleAtlas http://www.teleatlas.com/. the planned upgrade aims at bringing satellite imagery, aerial photos, and street-level data to MapMachine users. the next generation of MapMachine will include capabilities for 3D globe services. ESRI's mapStudio http://www.mapstudio.com/ also planned is the addition of ESRI's MapStudio http://www.mapstudio.com/. google Earth uses KML (Keyhole Markup Language) to store data. many third-party applications and custom annotated maps have begun to appear. two good UK examples of such applications/custom annotated maps are the health QOF database map. Syndication feeds are now geo-enabled. if a photo has latitude, longitude, and altitude information (geographic metadata), it will show up in all feeds. Gottipati [6] provides a useful comparison of Google Maps API and Yahoo! Maps API. Dedicated Web browser toolbars and extensions have also started to appear, e.g. MutantMaps http://www.mutantdesign.co.uk/maps/help.htm. the national Geographic MapMachine is a map service/online atlas that provides global map coverage for an extensive set of Earth science themes. the planned upgrade aims at bringing satellite imagery, aerial photos, and street-level data to MapMachine users. ESRI's ArcGIS back end will also allow users of the new service to accomplish much more sophisticated tasks. jibble.org list is a free online worldwide city geocoder. the worldKit geocoder also uses jibble.org list. the map features all the standard Google Maps controls for zooming, panning, and displaying satellite and hybrid views. the map features all the standard Google Maps controls for zooming, panning, and displaying/switching satellite and hybrid views. we created a third version of our maps using MSN Virtual Earth Map Control. it was guided by Part 1 of Roodyn's excellent tutorial. it is also possible to add VML polyline overlays to maps created using Google Maps API. gle.com/apis/maps/documentation/ and Gottipati's online tutorial. we produced the Google Maps API version of our interactive SHA map. the map features all the standard Google Maps controls for zooming, panning, and displaying satellite and. Google Mapki is a forum for sharing ideas, implementations, and help for the Google Maps API. the development of the Google Earth KML version of our maps was again guided by Google's online documentation available at http://code.google.com/apis.html#earth. three interactive SHA map demonstrators can be browsed online at http://www.healthcybermap.org/GoogleMapsAPI/, http://www.healthcybermap.org/GoogleEarthKML/ and http://www.healthcybermap.org/MSNVirtualEarth/. geodata-rich society ESRI president predicts supply of satellite and aerial imagery will increase by two folds in the next few years. the internet is already the 'foundation medium' to access, link and use all these data. satellite imagery data are abundantly available from multiple sources. satellite imagery has been made familiar and accessible to millions of people. the 'wiki' concept is not far from this vision. a wiki (from Hawaiian wiki, to hurry, swift) is a collaborative web site. a blog (weBLOG) is a web site that contains dated entries in reverse chronological order (most recent first) about a particular topic. a blog (weBLOG) is a web site that contains commentary and links to other Web sites. a search facility may also be included. some early geowiki examples have already found their way on the web. a simple online demo of worldKit GeoWiki is available at http://brainoff.com/worldkit/geowiki.php. geospatial technology advances and becomes more readily available to the masses. the interrelated issues of GIS and map data confidentiality start to surface. in public health worldwide, any public identification of an individual's health status and residence, regardless of level of contagion or risk, is usually prohibited. the current concern is to find an appropriate balance between public access to spatial information and protection of information considered a priority for national security. many doubts and misgivings that are raised about Internet GIS and map data privacy seem to be ill founded, or at least exaggerated. the lack of a geoDRM capability has been identified as a major barrier to the adoption of Web-based geospatial technologies. the geodata-rich society ESRI president recently predicted that the supply of satellite and aerial imagery will increase by two folds in the next few years. the internet is already the 'foundation medium' to access, link and use all these data. satellite imagery has been made familiar and accessible to millions of people. the different online consumer geoinformatics services have significantly contributed to raising the general public interest in geography and satellite imagery. many of these new online \"gadgets\" or \"toys\" will soon start thinking about becoming active participants. the current 'wiki' concept is not far from this vision. a wiki is a collaborative web site whose content can be edited by anyone who has access to it. a related web information sharing technology is the 'blog' 'geowikis','mapwikis', geo-enabled blogs,'mapblogs'. some early geowiki examples have already found their way on the web. some early geowiki examples have found their way on the web. author calls the ultimate \"wikification\" of GIS, maps and satellite imagery/aerial photography. national security, data confidentiality, and copyrights/digital rights management issues arise. in public health worldwide, any public identification of an individual's health status and residence is usually prohibited with very few exceptions. the current concern is to find an appropriate balance between public access to spatial information and protection of information considered a priority for national security [17,23]. despite all these undeniable, legitimate and real concerns about Internet GIS and map data privacy and confidentiality, many doubts and misgivings seem to be ill founded, or at least exaggerated. arth.google.com/earth_plus.html and google Earth Pro http://earth.google.com/earth_pro.html. the open geospatial Consortium's work on geospatial digital rights management is poised to become an important enabler in the context of geo-data and map copyrights. the lack of a GeoDRM capability has been identified as a major barrier to the broader adoption of Web-based geospatial technologies. ESRI have announced their planned response to Google (and MSN). it remains to be seen how their envisaged plans will materialize and compare to the offerings from Google and MSN."}
