{"summary": "wet disinfection has been found to be the most effective feed mill equipment surface decontamination method. but this is not practical in most current commercial feed production settings. methods to chemically or thermally mitigate the risk of PEDV transmission have been investigated. the FSRC was physically cleaned using sweeping and compressed air. the facility was then chemically cleaned using a 2-step process of a 1:256 dilution of ammonium glutaraldehyde blend (Synergize; Preserve International, Reno, NV) and a 1:32 dilution of sodium hypochlorite solution. the facility was then heated to 60 \u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h. laboratory scale stainless steel paddle mixers (n = 13; Cabela\u2019s Inc., Sidney, NE) were validated for mixer efficiency for 2.5- and 5.0-kg batches using a mix time of 5.0 min. six 2.5-kg chemically treated rice hull batches were prepared using 2% MCFA blend (n = 2; 1:1:1 ratio of hexanoic, octanoic, and decanoic acid) untreated rice hulls (2.5 kg; n = 2) were also weighed and prepared prior to initiation of the experiment. a subsample was collected from 6 locations within each mixer for a total sample size of approximately 225 g. a 5-kg batch of PEDV-negative feed was added to the production scale mixer, allowed to mix for approximately 15 s, and subsequently discharged into the bucket elevator. a 50-kg batch of PEDV-negative feed was then added to the production scale mixer, mixed for 5.0 min, and then discharged into the bucket elevator. 104 TCID50/mL\u2013diluted viral inoculum was added to create 5 kg of 104 TCID50/g\u2013inoculated feed. this batch was mixed for 5 min, at which point it was split into 2 samples, bagged, and stored in a freezer. each of 8 laboratory scale mixers was inoculated with feed, flush step performed, and a subsequent batch of feed was mixed and sampled. a 4.5-kg batch of PEDV-negative feed was added to a clean laboratory scale paddle mixer. 500 mL of 106 TCID50/mL inoculum was slowly added to create a 5-kg batch of PEDV-inoculated feed (105 TCID50/g) Upon conclusion of the addition of the virus, the batch was mixed for 5.0 min to ensure an even mix of virus into the feed inoculum. a 50-kg batch of PEDV-negative feed was then added to the production-scale mixer and allowed to mix for 5.0 min. a 225-g sample was collected from 6 locations of the bucket elevator and collected at the discharge spout. dust samples were also collected throughout the experiment. qRT-PCR analysis was performed within 7 d of inoculation on 1 aliquot per sample bottle. dust samples were subsampled into 1-mL aliquots, and 4 mL of PBS was added. supernatant pulled the following day to be analyzed via qRT-PCR. dust samples included those collected from mixing surfaces after manufacture of 104 TCID50/g\u2013inoculated swine feed, after the 10% MCFA rice hull flush, and subsequent feed after the 10% MCFA rice hull flush. supernatant samples were allowed to thaw prior to inoculation at room temperature, beginning approximately 3 h prior to inoculation. swabs were negative for PEDV, PDCoV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. pigs were allowed 2 d of adjustment to the new pens before inoculation. three pigs were housed per room with all pigs challenged with a single treatment. the FSRC was decontaminated following a standard protocol approved by the Kansas State University Institutional Biosafety Committee. prior to the experiment, the FSRC was physically cleaned using sweeping and compressed air, and then chemically cleaned using a 2-step process of a 1:256 dilution of ammonium glutaraldehyde blend (Synergize; Preserve International, Reno, NV) the production scale mixer used was a 0.113-m3 electric paddle mixer. feed was discharged at a rate of approximately 4.5 kg/min. each kilogram contains 110,000-mg choline. 3 Each kilogram contains 4,400,000 IU vitamin A, 660,000 IU vitamin D3, 17,600 IU vitamin E, 1,760 mg menadione, 3,300 mg riboflavin, 11,000 mg pantothenic acid, 19,800 mg niacin, and 15.4 mg vitamin B12. a 2.5-kg batch of PEDV-negative feed was added to each mixer. the mixer was then shut off, drive coupler removed from drive unit motor. a subsample was collected from 6 locations within each mixer for 225 g. inoculation of feed to be used in each of the laboratory scale mixers was performed in 5-kg batches using an additional laboratory scale mixer in which 4.5 kg of PEDV-negative feed was added to the mixer. 500 mL of 105 TCID50/mL\u2013diluted viral inoculum was added to create 5 kg of 104 TCID50/g\u2013inoculated feed. this batch was mixed for 5 min, at which point it was split into 2 samples using a riff a total of 8 laboratory-scale mixers with 2 replicates of each of the 4 chemical treatments (untreated rice hulls, formaldehyde-treated rice hulls, 2% MCFA-treated rice hulls, and 10% MCFA-treated rice hulls) a 4.5-kg batch of PEDV-negative feed was added to a clean laboratory scale paddle mixer and 500 mL of 106 TCID50/mL inoculum was slowly added to create the rice hull flush batch was discharged into the bucket elevator and collected at the bucket elevator discharge spout. a 225-g sample was collected from the mixer and remaining feed was discharged into the bucket elevator and collected at the bucket elevator discharge spout. dust samples were also collected throughout the experiment. a total of 4 aliquots from each sample bottle were collected and stored at 20 \u00b0C. the remaining 3 samples per bottle were stored at 80 \u00b0C until further use. qRT-PCR analysis was performed within 7 d of inoculation. bioassay samples from the production-scale system included 10% MCFA rice hull flush and subsequent feed for all 4 laboratory-scale treatments. supernatant samples were allowed to thaw prior to inoculation at room temperature, beginning approximately 3 h prior to inoculation. crossbred, 10-d-old pigs were sourced from a single commercial, crossbred herd with no known prior exposure to PEDV. piglets were ear tagged, weighed, and randomly assigned to bioassay treatment rooms. each room had an independent ventilation system. GLIMMIX (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used to determine differences between the treatments. a cycle time value of 45 was used for samples not containing detectible genetic material. rice hull flush samples collected from the mixer or subsequent feed samples from the mixer or bucket elevator discharge spout had detectable PEDV RNA. dust collected immediately following the 10% MCFA rice hull flush had a reduced quantity of viral RNA. subsequent feed following the 10% rice hull flush did not have detectible RNA. 45.0a Subsequent feed 45.0a () Swine feed was inoculated with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) at a concentration of 104 TCID50/g and passed through laboratory scale paddle mixers. subsequent batch of PEDV-negative swine diet was added at a recommended level of 3.25 kg/ton. infectivity was evaluated in a 10-d-old pig bioassay with 3 pigs per dust type. Pigs were individually inoculated on 0 dpi. indicates an individual pig did not have detectable PEDV genetic material in the respective sample using qRT-PCR. pigs inoculated with the positive dust collected following inoculation were shedding PEDV by day 2 after oral inoculation and continued to shed through necropsy at 7 dpi. pigs inoculated with the dust from the 10% MCFA rice hull flush batches or the subsequent feed batch did not have detectible PEDV genetic material. one 10% MCFA rice hull sample collected from the bucket elevator discharge spout had detectible RNA. none of the rice hull flush samples collected from the mixer or subsequent feed samples from the mixer or bucket elevator discharge spout had detectable PEDV RNA. dust collected immediately following the inoculated batch had a reduced quantity of viral RNA. feed was inoculated with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) at 104 TCID50/g. followed by rice hull flush, and subsequent batch of PEDV-negative swine diet. batch size was 2.5 kg with a mix time of 5 min. infectivity was evaluated in a 10-d-old pig bioassay with 3 pigs per dust type. indicates that an individual pig was found to have detectable PEDV genetic material in the respective sample using qRT-PCR. pigs inoculated with positive dust were shedding PEDV by day 2 after oral inoculation and continued to shed through necropsy at 7 dpi in both fecal samples and cecal content. but pigs inoculated with the dust from the 10% MCFA rice hull flush batches or the subsequent feed batch did not have any PEDV genetic material detected in fecal samples. the current experiment was performed in a controlled setting with equipment that is smaller scale than commercial production facilities. however, it serves as a proof of concept that should be further evaluated with additional research. dust generated during the 10% MCFA flush and subsequent batch of feed was not infectious. s are included to reduce risk of disease transmission. the strategy must shift to elimination of the pathogen altogether from the facility. the quantity of detectible genetic material was reduced as subsequent batches of feed were manufactured. use of MCFA\u2019s has shown significant potential to provide substantial efficacy in reduction of PEDV transmission. inclusion rates of MCFA\u2019s used in previous PEDV mitigation studies have used a 2% maximum inclusion on a wt:wt basis. no differences were observed in bioassay among treated and untreated rice hulls. chemical treatment of rice hulls with formaldehyde and 10% MCFA\u2019s reduced the quantity of detectible genetic material."}
