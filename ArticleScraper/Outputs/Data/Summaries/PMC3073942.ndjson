{"summary": "in bacteria, -lactamases are hydrolyzed by -lactamases in an acylation-deacylation-based process. these enzymes are capable of cleaving the amide bond of the -lactam ring so as to inactivate the -lactam antibiotic drugs. metallo--lactamases are the major culprit causing bacteria to resist antibiotics due to the reason that they can degrade all -lactams except monobactams most isolates with NDM-1 are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of severe infections. the most common bacteria that make this enzyme are Gram negative such as Klebsiella pneumonia. the gene for NDM-1 can spread from one strain of bacteria to another by horizontal gene transfer. a Zn-lactamase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [40] was selected as a structural template to perform homology modeling to develop the 3D structure of NDM-1. the entire sequence of 1ko3 contains 230 amino acids. the alignment result thus obtained indicates that the two proteins have a sequence identity of 43%. the amino acids in this figure are colored according to the following four types: (1) acidic, red; (2) basic, dark blue; (3) hydrophobic, green; (4) hydrophilic, light blue. the sequence identity of the two proteins is about 43%. the favorable binding mode thus obtained was further optimized by a short time molecular dynamics simulation (5 ns) the binding energy was calculated using a scoring function London dG [49], [50],[51] in all our calculations, the Merck force field parameters were adopted. in the computational structure, all the bond lengths for the main-chain residues and 91.9% bond angles for the main-chain residues are within the allowed limits. the QMEAN score ranges between 0 and 1 with higher value to reflect a better quality of the model. helices and -strands in 1ko3.pdb are not seen in the NDM-1 model. this is due to the sequence deletion of NDM-1 in its metallo-lactamases. Fig. 3B shows a close view of the binding interactions obtained by docking the antibiotic drug Imipenem to the receptor NDM-1. the binding pocket is formed by nine residues that have at least one heavy atom with a distance within 5 [55] to Imipenem. the constituent residues thus defined for the binding pocket are quite consistent those identified by the online web-server tool Q-SiteFinder. the binding pocket for Meropenem involves six residues, of which Glu88 and Thr126 form three hydrogen bonds with the antibiotic drug. some additional hydrogen bonds are needed to stabilize the ligand during the process of cleaving its amide bond and inactivate the antibiotic drug. the QMEAN score ranges between 0 and 1 with higher value to reflect a better quality of the model. we also calculated a Z-score of the computational model in comparison with the scores of reference X-ray structures of similar size. metallo-lactamases can inactivate the -lactam antibiotic drugs by cleaving the amide (carbon-nitrogen) bond of the -lactam ring. metallo-lactamases can inactivate the -lactam antibiotic drugs by cleaving the amide (carbon-nitrogen) bond. shown in Fig. 3B is a close view of the binding interactions obtained by docking the antibiotic drug Imipenem to the receptor NDM-1. the binding pocket is formed by nine residues that have at least one heavy atom with a distance within 5 [55] to Imipenem. the binding pocket for Meropenem involves six residues, of which Glu88 and Thr126 form three hydrogen bonds with the antibiotic drug. some additional hydrogen bonds are needed to stabilize the ligand during the process of cleaving its amide bond and inactivate the antibiotic drug."}
