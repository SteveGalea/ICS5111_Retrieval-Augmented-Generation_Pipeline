{"summary": "influenza viruses belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae. in most cases infections are self-limiting and restricted to the upper respiratory tract. certain patient groups (such as the elderly) are at risk of developing complications leading to high morbidity and mortality. the vaccine strains need to be updated almost annually to achieve a good antigenic match with the epidemic virus strains. if the vaccine strains do not antigenically match the circulating strains, vaccine efficacy is reduced considerably. seasonal influenza vaccines will afford little or no protection against antigenically distinct pandemic influenza viruses. the use of viral vectors for influenza vaccine production may be a solution to some of the problems discussed above. most viral vectors are considered live vaccines but their replication is attenuated or even deficient. vector-based vaccines are considered safe in general and some of them can even be safely used in immunocompromised. recombinant VV expressing the influenza HA gene and this vaccine was able to induce an antibody response in rabbits. recombinant VV were designed that express all influenza virus proteins. 57 HA/NP n/a H1N1, H5, H5N1, H5N8, H7N2, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2 26,77-81,83,84,89-93 NP n/a\" 77 HA n/a H3N8 96 HA n/a H2N8 49,69-74 NP n/a H3N8 49 HA n/a H2N2 15 this was demonstrated in field trials, where MVA was successfully used as a safe smallpox vaccine in over 120,000 individuals in the absence of any serious adverse events. however, the use of MVA as a vaccine vector has multiple alternative advantages. HA is the surface antigen of choice because it stimulates B-cell responses and the production of virus neutralizing antibodies (VN) in vivo. most antibodies directed to HA are strain-specific and display poor cross-reactivity with HAs of alternative subtypes, or even with HA molecules from other viruses of the same subtype. avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype cause endemic outbreaks in poultry. since 1997, zoonotic transmission of various A(H5) viruses have caused many cases of human infection6,42 of which almost 400 had a fatal outcome. immunization with MVA-H5(A/Vietnam/04) protected macaques from challenge infection with homologous virus and clade 2.1 virus A/Indonesia/5/05.47 This favorable outcome justified testing of MVA-H5(A/Vietnam/04) in a phase 1/2a clinical trial that showed that this vaccine candidate was immunogenic in man. i/2/13) induced VN antibodies and offered partial protection against challenge infection with a closely-related A(H7N9) virus. a similar MVA-NP(A/Vietnam/1203/04) construct failed to induce protective immunity in macaques. MVA expressing the NP gene of an equine A(H3N8) virus offered ponies partial protection from infection. but only after initial priming with a DNA vaccine expressing the same antigen. in mice, vaccination afforded complete protection from infection with the homologous virus. ietnam/1203/04 and the IL-15 gene were tested in mice. recombinant MVA was given in adjunct with recombinant adenovirus expressing the same genes. this vaccination regimen proved immunogenic in pigs, but the protective potential was not tested in this species. some modified influenza viral antigens are being expressed by recombinant viral vectors, including MVA. the vaccine was capable of inducing antibodies that reacted with A(H5N1) viruses from all clades, but did not cross-react with other HA subtypes. influenza virus antigens can be modified to optimize induction of (cross-reactive) immune responses. recombinant NYVAC, Raccoonpox, canarypox and Fowlpox vectors also used as viral vectors. at present, recombinant CNPV are used as influenza vector vaccines for vaccination of horses against equine influenza of the A(H3N8) subtype. maternal antibodies induced by CNPV-HA were passively transferred to foals of vaccinated pregnant horses. pigs and cats were protected from avian influenza virus of the A(H5N1) subtype. virus (A/Turkey/Ireland/1378/83) was extensively tested in chickens. recombinant FPV vaccines were generated expressing the HA gene of avian A(H9N2) influenza virus. however, a FPV-based vaccine expressing both the HA and NA gene protected chickens completely from homologous challenge infection. FPV-HA vaccines expressing influenza viral antigens rarely have been used in non-avian species. but FPV-HA was capable of inducing antibody responses in cats 97 and afforded protection in pigs when challenged with a low-pathogenic influenza virus. several alphaviruses are being developed as vaccine vectors. vaccination of pigs has been studied using different VEE constructs. expressing the HA gene of the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes and an NP gene of an A(H3N2) swine influenza virus. 145 HA Chimeric cH5/1, cH9/1 140 NP n/a H1N1 139 HA/NA n/a H1N1, H5N1 140 HA n/a H5N1, H7N1 142 HA n/a H5N1 144 NDV HA n/a H1N1, H5N1 147,158,159,167 HA Soluble H5N1 158 HA duck enteritis virus (DEV), an alphaherpesvirus and the causative agent of duck plague, has caused fatal infections in many species of waterfowl. however, deletion of glycoprotein C leads to an attenuated DEV that may be exploited for the development of vectored vaccines. chickens are often vaccinated at very young age (1 day after birth) maternal antibodies against the vector or against the protein encoded by the transgene could influence vaccine efficacy. attenuated strains of PrV expressing foreign antigens were generated and are attractive as bivalent vaccines for pigs. the protective efficacy of these vaccines was only assessed in dogs. recombinant EHV-1 were constructed that express the HA gene of influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) mice could only be partially protected from infection with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 after vaccination with VSV expressing the corresponding HA gene. however, combination of the HA and NP constructs resulted in full protection from infection. mice were primed with a recombinant VSV expressing an HA gene with the stalk region of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 and the globular head domain of an A(H9N2) virus. intra-nasal prime-boost regimens performed better than IM vaccination. a recombinant NDV expressing the HA genes of influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) has been licensed as a poultry vaccine in some countries. the vector was shown to have a protective effect against challenge infection with A(H5N1) viruses in chickens and ducks. a recombinant baculovirus vaccine produced in baculoviruses was approved for human use in the united states. however, baculoviruses have also been explored as live vaccine vectors. vaccines for use in clinical trials are therefore not likely. vaccination with PIV-5 expressing the HA of an A(H3) virus afforded protection against homologous challenge infection. recombinant PIV-5-NP(A/Anhui/1/13) in guinea pigs challenged with a homologous A(H7N9) influenza virus. adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is a replication-deficient vector that has been evaluated for gene delivery, anti-cancer therapy and as an infectious disease vaccine. it remains to be determined whether PIV-5 is safe and immunogenic when used in humans. HA n/a H5N1 203,215 NP n/a H5N1 215 HA/NA Consensus H1N1 212 NP/M2 n/a H1N1, H5N1 215,216 HA/NP/M2 n/a H5N1 215 HA n/a H1N1, H3N2 196,200 NP n/a H3N2 196 HA/NP rAd4 expressing the HA gene of an A(H5N1) influenza virus reported enhanced immune responses after co-administration with an HA protein vaccine. a rAd5 expressing the HA gene of an A(H1) virus and co-expressing dsRNA as adjuvant were safe and immunogenic in humans. a second drawback for the use of rAd in humans is the potential of pre-existing immunity against adenovirus interfering with vaccine rAd expressing the HA gene of an A(H5N2) virus protected mice, chickens and ferrets from infection with the homologous virus. rAd expressing the HA gene of an A(H5) virus was immunogenic in chickens and capable of protecting chickens from homologous challenge infection. rAd5 expressing the NP gene of an avian A(H5N1) virus completely protected mice from infection with A(H1N1) virus. rAd5 expressing an M2 consensus sequence could even afford protection from various A(H1N1) influenza viruses181 and abrogated contact transmission to sentinel mice. pentavalent vaccines that expressed the HA, NA and M1 genes from either 1918 pandemic A(H1N1) and the HA and NA genes from 1918 pandemic A(H1N1) performed superior in inducing protection from A(H5N1) infection. rAd5 boost regimen was used, inducing protection against infection with the homologous virus in all cases. drawbacks of using AAV include limited capacity for transgenes, presence of pre-existing immunity in humans and technical challenge of producing high titer stocks. smallpox, caused by variola virus, was the first viral disease widely prevented and eradicated by vaccination. Vaccinia virus (VV), closely related to the causative agent of cowpox, was thereafter used as one of the vaccines to eradicate smallpox. HA/NP n/a, HAstem H1N1, H5N1 36,51-53,68 NP/M1 n/a H3N2 56,57 HA/NA n/a H5N1 54,68 HA/M2 HAstem, M2e repeats H1N1, H5N1, H7N2, H9N2 51 HA/NP/M2 HAstem, M2e repeats H1N1, H n/a H5N1 47,48 NP/M1 n/a H3N2 58-62 Modified vaccinia virus Ankara vectors MVA, an attenuated VV strain, is derived from chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara through serial passaging in chicken embryo fibroblasts. resulting in major deletions in the viral genome that influenced many virulence and immune evasion factors. a second booster vaccination with a MVA expressing an influenza virus HA resulted in potent antibody responses against the protein of interest. similar observations were made in other studies with MVA expressing other proteins. this indicates that recombinant MVA remain immunogenic. intra-subtypic cross-immunity was observed to some extent as MVA-H1(A/Cal/07/09) could also protect mice from infection with various A(H1N1) swine influenza viruses. MVA expressing the HA gene of influenza virus A/Vietnam/1194/04 (clade 1) completely protected mice and chickens from infection with the homologous virus. also offered mice protection against infection with influenza viruses A/HK/156/97 (clade 0), A/HK/156/97 (clade 0), A/Turkey/Turkey/1/05 (clade 2.2), or A/Anhui/1/05 (clade 2.3). avian influenza viruses of the A(H7N9) subtype have caused frequent infection of humans, especially in Southeast China, often with fatal outcome. a candidate MVA-based vaccine expressing the HA gene of one of these viruses (A/Shanghai/2/13) was constructed and tested in ferrets. a similar MVA-NP(A/Vietnam/1203/04) construct failed to induce protective immunity in macaques. a similar MVA-NP(A/Vietnam/1203/04) construct also failed to induce protective immunity against infection. vaccination afforded complete protection from infection with the homologous A(H1N1) and A(H5N1) strains and partial protection from infection with a virus of the A(H3N1) subtype. macaques were only partially protected from infection with the H1N1pdm09 virus. an MVA-NP+M1 vaccine was shown to induce virus-specific CD8+ T-cells in humans and protect from experimental challenge infection with an A(H3N2) virus. this vaccination regimen was again shown to be safe and immunogenic in the elderly,62. a single study has performed vaccination challenge experiments with MVA expressing the HA-stalk, either alone or in combination with other antigens. mice were protected from infection with A(H5N1), A(H9N2), A(H7N2) and A(H1N1) viruses. canarypox (CNPV) is a host-restricted member of the poxvirus family that is unable to produce infectious progeny virus in mammalian cells. recombinant vaccines expressing HA genes of various A(H3N8) strains were immunogenic in horses and protected against infection with virus of this subtype. several attenuated FPV vector vaccines are currently licensed as A(H5N1) influenza vaccines for use in poultry. initial studies showed that FPV as a vector effectively induces both B- and T-cell responses in chickens. however, pre-existing immunity to FPV or influenza antigens could pose a potential problem when using FPV-based influenza vaccines. recombinant FPV vaccines expressing influenza virus NP and NA genes were tested as well. a FPV-based vaccine expressing both the HA and NA genes simultaneously protected chickens completely from homologous challenge infection. FPV-HA was capable of inducing antibody responses in cats 97 and afforded protection in pigs when challenged with a low-pathogenic influenza virus. the use of MVA as a vaccine vector has multiple alternative advantages. this includes easy insertion of antigens of interest into the viral genome, transient expression of heterologous antigens in vivo and induction of humoral and cellular responses. recombinant MVAs expressing the HA gene of the H1N1pdm09 influenza virus A/California/07/09 have been tested for immunogenicity in mice, ferrets and macaques. mice, ferrets and macaques could be fully protected from disease after challenge infection with the homologous virus. avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype cause endemic outbreaks in poultry. since 1997, zoonotic transmission of various A(H5) viruses have caused many cases of human infection6,42 of which almost 400 had a fatal outcome. immunization with MVA-H5(A/Vietnam/04) protected macaques from challenge infection with the homologous virus and clade 2.1 virus A/Indonesia/5/05.47 This favorable outcome justified testing of MVA-H5(A/Vietnam/04) in a phase 1/2a clinical trial that showed that this candidate was immunogenic in man. MVA-NP, MVA-M1, MVA-NA and MVA-PB1 vaccines were constructed and tested in animal models. a similar MVA-NP(A/Vietnam/1203/04) construct failed to induce protective immunity in macaques. gene of an equine A(H3N8) virus (MVA-NP(A/Equine/Kentucky/1/81)) offered partial protection from infection. but only after initial priming with a DNA vaccine expressing the same antigen. recombinant MVA was given in adjunct with recombinant adenovirus expressing the same genes. this vaccination regimen proved immunogenic in pigs, but the protective potential was not tested in this species. the modified influenza viral antigens are being expressed by recombinant viral vectors, including MVA. the vaccine was capable of inducing antibodies that reacted with A(H5N1) viruses from all clades. but that did not cross-react with viruses of other HA subtypes. influenza virus antigens can be modified to optimize induction of (cross-reactive) immune responses. these modified viral antigens can readily be expressed by recombinant MVA vectors. other attenuated poxviruses have been used as viral vectors for the development of candidate influenza vaccines. recombinant CNPV vaccines expressing HA genes of various A(H3N8) strains were immunogenic in horses and protected against infection with virus of this subtype. maternal antibodies induced by CNPV-HA were passively transferred to foals of vaccinated pregnant horses. recombinant FPV vaccines expressing the HA gene of avian A(H9N2) influenza virus were tested in chickens and ducks. recombinant FPV vaccines expressing influenza virus NP and NA genes simultaneously protected chickens completely from homologous challenge infection. 85,89 Similar results were obtained with a recombinant FPV vaccine expressing the HA gene of avian A(H9N2) influenza virus. alphaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses with a positive sense genome of the Togaviridae family. these vectors often are replication deficient replicons. these regions of the genome are replaced by transgenes of interest. vaccination of pigs has been studied using different VEE constructs. pigs could at least be partially protected from infection with the homologous virus. 139 HA/NP n/a H1N1 139 HA/NA n/a H1N1, H5N1 140 HA n/a H5N1, H7N1 142 HA n/a H5N1 144 NDV HA n/a H1N1, H5N1 147,158,159,167 HA Soluble H5N1 158 HA n/a H5N1, H5N2, H6, H duck enteritis virus (DEV), an alphaherpesvirus and the causative agent of duck plague, has caused fatal infections in many species of waterfowl. however, deletion of glycoprotein C leads to an attenuated DEV that may be exploited for the development of vectored vaccines. maternal antibodies against the vector or against the protein encoded by the transgene could influence vaccine efficacy. attenuated strains of PrV expressing foreign antigens were generated and are attractive as bivalent vaccines for pigs. recombinant EHV-1 were constructed that express the HA gene of influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1). this vaccine candidate afforded mice complete and pigs partial protection from infection. 134,135 Herpes viruses have a relatively large genome. a combination of the HA and NP constructs resulted in full protection from infection. a VSV expressing the HA gene of an A(H5N1) virus completely protected chickens from infection with a 6:2 reassortant virus. mice were primed with a recombinant VSV expressing an HA gene with the stalk region of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 and the head domain of an A(H9N2) virus. intra-nasal prime-boost regimens performed better than IM vaccination. the first study using NDV as a vaccine vector for influenza was NDV-H1, that expressed the HA gene of influenza virus A/WSN/1933. a recombinant NDV expressing HA genes of influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) was licensed as a poultry vaccine in some countries. the vaccine was shown to have a protective effect against challenge infection with A(H5N1) viruses in chickens and ducks. baculoviruses can readily be manipulated to express foreign antigens. they can infect mammalian cells without causing cytopathic effect. recombinant baculovirus expressing the HA gene of influenza virus could induce complete protection from homologous challenge infection. PIV-5 has been associated with 'kennel cough' in dogs. vaccination with PIV-5 expressing the HA of an A(H3) virus afforded protection against homologous challenge infection. inant adenoviruses (rAd) have attractive properties to serve as vaccine vectors. high titer stocks can be grown, genes of interest can easily be inserted into the stable viral genome. long-term storage at 4 degrees is possible and rAd can even induce robust immune responses when administered orally or intra-nasally. 2 n/a H5N1 215 HA/NA Consensus H1N1 212 NP/M2 n/a H1N1, H5N1 215,216 HA/NP/M2 n/a H5N1 215 HA n/a H1N1, H3N2 196,200 NP n/a H3N2 196 HA/NP n/a H3N2 196 HA/NP n/ adenoviruses 190,192-194 and low-prevalent adenoviruses 195 are being explored as novel vaccine vectors. adenoviruses expressing HA genes of a number of different subtypes (A(H1, H3, H5, H7 and H9) have been tested in various animal models. the rAd expressing the HA gene of an A(H5) influenza virus was immunogenic in chickens and capable of protecting chickens from homologous challenge infection. the rAd expressing the HA gene of an A(H5) influenza virus, either wildtype or glycosylated, afforded cross-clade protection in mice. rAd5 expressing the NP gene of an avian A(H5N1) virus completely protected mice from infection with some - but not all - influenza viruses of the A(H5N1) subtype. vaccination of pigs with a comparable rAd5-NP construct could not afford protection from homologous challenge infection. pentavalent vaccines that expressed the HA, NA and M1 genes from either 1918 pandemic A(H1N1) and the HA and NA genes from 1918 pandemic A(H1N1) performed superior in inducing protection from A(H5N1) infection. 216 Ad-HA vaccines have been tested in various animal models. rAd5 vaccines expressing the HA gene of an A(H3N2) influenza virus of swine-origin protected mice from challenge infection with a heterologous A(H3N2) virus. rAd5 vaccines expressing the HA gene of an A(H3) virus completely protected mice from homologous challenge infection. rAd expressing modified HA gene shielded the immunodominant head region by glycans to re-direct the immune response from the HA head region. a rAd expressing the HA gene of an A(H5) influenza virus, either wildtype or glycosylated, afforded cross-clade protection in mice. rAd5 expressing an M2 consensus sequence could even afford protection from infection with various A(H1N1) influenza viruses181 and abrogated contact transmission to sentinel mice. a similar rAd vaccine, expressing the NP and M1 genes from an A(H3N2) virus, induced T-cell responses. DNA priming followed by rAd5 boost vaccination completely protected mice from homologous challenge infection and afforded heterosubtypic immunity upon infection with A(H3N2) and some A(H5N1) influenza strains. a limited number of studies evaluating AAV as a vector for influenza vaccination has been performed. Initially, an AAV expressing the HA gene or NP gene was shown to be protective in mice. a more recent study tested AAV vaccines expressing the HA, NP or M1 genes of H1N1pdm09. viral vectors proved to be immunogenic even in the presence of pre-existing immunity. for some vector technologies there are some safety concerns, like the use of herpes viruses that persistently infect their hosts. these properties might restrict their applicability as prophylactic vaccines. cinia virus Ankara BSL-1 Biosafety level 1 NP Nucleoprotein VN Virus neutralizing HI Hemagglutination inhibition M1 Matrix 1 rAd Recombinant adenovirus RCN Raccoonpox virus CNPV Canarypox virus SFV Semliki forest virus SIN Sindbis virus VEE Venezuelan equine encephalitis CMV Cytomegalovirus DEV Duck enterit"}
