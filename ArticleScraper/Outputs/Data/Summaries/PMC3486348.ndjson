{"summary": "pathogenic Leptospira spp. have worldwide distribution and cause a zoonosis that is transmitted from reservoir hosts (typically rodents) to humans via water or contaminated soil. leptospirosis is common in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. leptospires bind to host ligands, including fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, laminin, and elastin. it is likely that leptospires express distinct adhesins during different stages of infection. only partial inhibition was observed for Lsa24, LigA/B, Lsa63, and Lsa66 (8, 19, 75, 98), which partially could be due to nonoptimal conformation of the recombinant protein or low antibody titer. the use of protein microarrays to identify ligand-binding proteins is an innovative approach (51, 60, 73, 106) that could serve as a useful tool for elucidating host-pathogen interactions only LIC10258 (MFn8) has previously been described as a fibronectin protein, Lsa66 (75). specific antisera for MFn1, MFn7, and MFn9 were obtained, which allowed us to demonstrate that MFn1, MFn7, and MFn9 are localized on the surface of in vitro-grown leptospires by surface proteolysis. leptospires were cultivated at 30\u00b0C in Probumin vaccine-grade solution (catalog no. 84-066-5; Millipore, Billerica, MA) diluted 5-fold into autoclaved distilled water. Competent Escherichia coli NEB 5- (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA), and BLR(DE3)pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) were used for cloning and expression. proteins with more than three alpha-helical transmembrane domains were detected and eliminated using the TMHMM version 2.0. transmembrane OMPs were selected using two -barrel prediction programs, PRED-TMBB and TMBETA-NET. leptospiral OMP microarray was prepared at the Protein Microarray Laboratory, University of California, Irvine. protein-specific primers were designed with 20-bp vector recombination site overlap and 20 bp of gene-specific sequences. 401 leptospiral ORFs and their fragments were cloned into the pXT7 expression vector using a high-throughput cloning method. the pXT7 vector incorporated a 5\u2032 polyhistidine epitope and a 3\u2032 hemagglutinin (HA) epitope on each protein. proteins were expressed overnight at room temperature with shaking at 250 rpm. a \u201cno DNA\u201d negative control with an empty plasmid vector provided the baseline signal for fluorescence readout. microarrays were stored in a desiccator and used within 3 months after printing. the arrays were incubated for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing human fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1,000-fold (determined empirically) in Odyssey blocking buffer, followed by washing as described above. the wells were washed three times with PBS-T, the slide modules were then removed, and the slides were washed seven times with PBS-T. imageJ measures the pixel intensities of each spot and converts them to numerical mean the genomic loci proposed names for the genes were as follows: Lic11612 (mfn1), Lic10714 (mfn2), Lic11051 (mfn6), Lic11436 (mfn7), Lic10258 (mfn8), and Lic10537 (mfn9) the PCR products were purified by using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) the plasmids were digested with NdeI and XhoI or NdeI and SalI for mfn1, mfn2, mfn6, mfn7, mfn9, or mfn8, respectively, and ligated to pET-20b(+) digested with either N mfn6 mfn6 mfn6 mfn6 mfn6 mfn6 mfn6 mfn6 mfn6 mfn7 mfn7 mfn7 mfn7 mfn7 mfn7 mfn7 mfn7 mfn8 mfn8 mfn8 mfn9 mfn9 mf new Zealand white rabbits were immunized with 0.25 mg of gel-purified recombinant protein four times over a 9-week period. serum was collected 1 week after the final injection. peptide GYWEEEKRAELGKSK was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein via an N-terminal cysteine. the blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. the flaB1 promoter sequence in pRAT578 was amplified from oligonucleotides flaB1p(Kp)-1F and flaB1p(Xh)-2R. the forward primer Z7_11436F was used for cloning in both E. coli and L. biflexa. the forward primer was used for cloning in both E. coli and L. biflexa. the last 1,998 nucleotides of the Lic12952 gene were amplified from genomic DNA of L. interrogans strain Fiocruz L1-130.

PCR was performed with Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) 578/MFn12 plasmids were digested by KpnI and XhoI to release the plasmids containing PromflaB1 mfn1, PromflaB1 mfn3, PromflaB1 mfn4, PromflaB1 mfn7, PromflaB1 mfn9, PromflaB1 mfn12 were then cloned into the the bacteria were transferred to a 14-ml polypropylene tube and incubated for 24 h. colonies were inoculated into liquid Probumin vaccine-grade solution containing 40 g of spectinomycin/ml. mM MgCl2 and adherent cells were fixed with methanol at 20\u00b0C for 10 min. a total of 171 candidate transmembrane OMPs were selected by combining computer prediction tools with prior genome sequence annotations. fifteen leptospiral proteins with MFIs above the arbitrary threshold of 10 were identified as candidate fibronectin-binding proteins designated MFn1 to MFn15. fourteen of these proteins have not previously been described as fibronectin-binding proteins. some previously characterized leptospiral proteins did not meet the MFI threshold of our assay. the affinity of some previously characterized leptospiral proteins for fibronectin is considerably lower than that of FnbpA-D. leptospiral OMP microarray proteins with the best fibronectin-binding activity were probed with 10 g of fibronectin/ml. the annotation and MFI values of 15 leptospiral proteins exhibited significant binding based on an arbitrary threshold of 10 MFIs. rMFn7n showed weakest binding for higher amounts of rMFn7n (1, 0.5 and 0.25 g) compared to stronger binding for lower amounts of rMFn7n (0.125 and 0.0625 g) rMFn7n showed weakest binding for higher amounts of rMFn7n (1, 0.5 and 0.25 g) the quantity of protein per lane is indicated (2 or 0.2 g) the positions of molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons) are indicated on the left. only FnbpA-D (19, 102) and MFn7 (see Materials and Methods) were purified. immuno rabbit sera recognized MFn1, MFn7, and MFn9 proteins expressed by in vitro grown L. interrogans, with native MFn1 and MFn9 migrating as 45- and 70-kDa bands. the presence of several cross-reactive bands indicates that MFn8 is either not expressed or expressed in very low levels in cultivated L. interrogans. MFn3 (Sph3) and MFn4 (Sph2) were not subjected to surface localization analysis due to uncertainty about expression in L. interrogans. other MFn proteins were not subjected to surface proteolysis due to the lack of specific antibodies. expression of MFn proteins by L. biflexa transformants. whole-cell lysates of 108 leptospires per lane were separated by gel electrophoresis. probed with rabbit immune sera recognizing MFn1 (A), MFn7 (B), MFn9 (C), MFn4 (Sph2) (D) and MFn3 (Sph3) (E). 1, mfn3, mfn4, mfn7, mfn9, or mfn12 gene was not detected by Coomassie blue staining. the lack of antibodies recognizing MFn12 prevented the assessment of MFn12 expression by L. biflexa transformants. only the overexpression of MFn1, MFn4 (Sph2), and MFn7 could be detected by their respective antibodies. MFn3 (Sph3) and MFn4 (Sph2) (62) were examined for their abilities to recognize either MFn3 or MFn4 in L. biflexa transformants. MFn4 expression was detected only by its homologous antiserum. several bands were recognized by MFn4 antiserum in both the control, L. biflexa/pRAT575, as well as L. biflexa/MFn3 and L. biflex L. interrogans L1-130 whole-cell lysates recognized a unique 90-kDa band in L. interrogans L1-130 whole-cell lysates. lack of reports of Sph3 expression by in vitro cultivated leptospires makes it difficult to know whether this band corresponds to one of the sphingomyelinase-like proteins. acquisition of fibronectin supplied at 10 or 30 g/ml increased to similar levels in L. biflexa expressing MFn1, MFn4 and MFn7. no significant increase in fibronectin binding was observed for L. biflexa transformants expressing MFn3, MFn9, or MFn12. the ability of L. biflexa transformants to bind fibronectin was also assessed by a whole-cell ELISA. however, no statistically significant enhancement in binding was observed by MFn protein transformants compared to L. biflexa controls transformed with pRAT575. this was most likely due to the fact that immobilized fibronectin was assayed as opposed to the freely soluble Fn used in other assays described here. positive control, Staphylococcus aureus FnbpA-D, had the highest MFI. lowering the MFI threshold would increase the number of false positives. we focused our studies on proteins with the greatest likelihood of true fibronectin-binding proteins. the affinity of some previously characterized leptospiral proteins for fibronectin is considerably lower than that of FnbpA-D (102) one to two nanoliters of 408 in vitro transcription-translation reactions were printed on the leptospiral OMP microarray. recombinant MFn1, MFn2, MFn6, MFn7, MFn8, and MFn9 proteins were subjected to far-Western and dot blot ligand-binding assays. rFnbpA-D exhibited the strongest binding, followed by rMFn2, rMFn8, rMFn1, rMFn6, and rMFn9 in order of decreasing binding. binding activity of MFn7 is conformationally dependent, requiring native conformation for fibronectin interactions. negative control, bovine serum albumin (BSA), did not exhibit significant binding. rMFn proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis, blotted onto PVDF membranes, and probed with 10 g of human plasma fibronectin/ml. rabbit sera recognized MFn1, MFn7, MFn8, and MFn9 proteins expressed by in vitro grown L. interrogans. only FnbpA-D (19, 102) and MFn7 were purified under native conditions. no detectable alteration in expression levels of MFn1, MFn7, MFn8 and MFn9 was observed in cultivated L. interrogans cultures treated with 120 mM NaCl. all three proteins were cleaved by proteinase K in a dose-dependent manner. flaA2 was used as a negative control for surface proteolysis. rMFn1, rMFn7, rMFn8, and rMFn9 denote the corresponding recombinant proteins. Lane WC contains L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 whole-cell lysate. the presence of inserts of correct size in the pRAT575 vector was verified by PCR using pRAT575-specific oligonucleotides. the expression of recombinant proteins by L. biflexa transformed with pRAT575 vector constructs containing an mfn1, mfn3, mfn4, mfn7, mfn9, or mfn9 gene was not detected by Coomassie blue staining n1 and a band corresponding to the predicted molecular mass (48 kDa) of MFn1 were present only in the L. biflexa/MFn1 transformant. no expression was detected in the control, L. biflexa/pRAT575, whereas the overexpression of MFn7 was achieved in the L. biflexa/MFn7 transformant. antisera recognizing two related leptospiral sphingomyelinases, several bands observed in L. biflexa by MFn3 antiserum were due to nonspecific antibodies present in preimmune serum of a rabbit that was used for immunization with the Sph3 peptide. a 76-kDa band corresponding to a predicted molecular mass of 71.7 kDa for Sph2 was recognized by Sph2 antiserum. this band was not reported for L. interrogans L1-130 grown under normal flexa transformants expressing MFn1, MFn4 and MFn7 bound substantially more soluble fibronectin from the culture media than control L. biflexa transformed with the pRAT575 empty vector. densitometry analysis demonstrates that the expression of MFn1, MFn4 and MFn7 dramatically increases binding of fibronectin by L. biflexa. L. biflexa transformants were tested for their ability to acquire human plasma fibronectin. after a washing step to remove unbound ligand, 108 leptospires per lane were separated by gel electrophoresis, blotted onto PVDF membranes, and probed with rabbit immune sera recognizing human fibronectin (A) or L. biflexa LPS (B) leptospiral surface components are thought to recognize host molecules, counteract host defense mechanisms, and promote the invasion and colonization of various tissues. the identification and characterization of OMPs is critical to the understanding of pathogenesis mechanisms, the development of diagnostic antigens, and the identification of potential vaccine candidates. only one previously characterized fibronectin-binding protein, Lsa66 (75), exceeded the selected binding threshold. affinities of previously characterized fibronectin-binding proteins of leptospira, including LigA/B, Lsa21, Lsa24 (LfhA = LenA), lenB-F, LipL32, Lp95, TlyC, LipL53, OmpL37, LipL53, and Lsa66 two leptospiral sphingomyelinase-like proteins, Sph3 (MFn3) and Sph2 (MFn4), were identified as fibronectin-binding proteins by the microarray assay. sphingomyelinases hydrolyze sphingomyelin, a constituent of animal cell membranes, into ceramide and phosphorylcholine. most bacteria do not produce sphingomyelin; therefore, fibronectin binding was confirmed for MFn1, MFn2, MFn6, MFn7, MFn8, and MFn9 protein by solid-phase binding assays. a previous study on MFn8 (Lsa66) failed to provide convincing evidence for synthesis of the protein in cultivated L. interrogans. fibronectin-binding proteins MFn protein Purified rMFna Antiserum produced Expression in cultivated L. biflexa transformants Presence of homologs in L. biflexa Acquisition of Fn by L. biflexa transformants MFn1 D Whole protein Yes (48) Yes 3 Yes No Yes MFn2 D NAd NDb ND 1 NA Yes NA MFn3 (Sph3) NA Synthetic peptide Yes (90) ND a cell-free coupled transcription-translation reaction has been previously reported as a rapid and successful method to develop protein microarrays against a number of infectious organisms. a cell-free coupled transcription-translation reaction has been previously reported as a rapid and successful method to develop protein microarrays against a number of infectious organisms. the absence of posttranslational protein modifications may adversely affect the identification of functional proteins (64). the lack of posttranslational modification is a limitation to be considered when screening bacterial OMPs for their interactions with host ligands. protein microarrays can be effectively used to identify novel bacterial surface proteins with the capacity to bind host ligands. further studies will be required to determine their functional roles."}
