{"summary": "the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the central site of cellular metabolism and protein synthesis. misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and cause ER stress. the cell will activate several signaling pathways known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (1, 2). phosphorylation of eIF2 results in the shutdown of global cellular protein synthesis and a reduction of the protein load in the ER (1, 6) but enhances the translation of the activating transcription factor ATF4 which activates genes involved in metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis (6, 7). apoptosis leads to the rapid disassembly of cellular structures and organelles. double-membrane vesicles, the coronavirus RNA synthesis site and virus envelopes are derived from the ER membrane (15, 16) the extensive use of the ER membrane usually overloads the ER and triggers UPR. several reports have shown that IBV infection induces caspase-dependent apoptosis at late stages of infection in cultured cells. -ATF4-GADD153 pathway is activated by IBV infection. upregulation of the proapoptotic protein GADD153 plays a critical role in IBV-induced apoptosis. RNA was precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. aqueous phase was mixed with a 1:1 volume of isopropanol. cDNAs were then subjected to PCR using appropriate primers. RNA was transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with DIG-labeled DNA probes overnight at 50\u00b0C. the membrane was rinsed briefly (5 min) in washing buffer and blocked in blocking buffer for 30 min. the signal was detected with CDP-Star (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. antibodies against total eIF2, ATF3, ATF4, and TRIB3 were purchased from Abcam. IBV M protein, N protein, and S protein antibodies were raised in rabbits. after washing three times with TBST, the membrane was incubated with 1:2,000-diluted anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. inal was purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) the same volume of DMSO was added to another group of IBV-infected cells as a negative control. cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and grown to 50 to 60% confluence. inactivation of IBV was performed by subjecting the above-mentioned virus stock to 120,000 mJ/cm2 of 254-nm short-wave UV radiation for 10 min within a CL-1000 cross-linker (UVP) western blotting was used to determine the presence or absence of viral proteins in cells infected with the UV-inactivated virus. RNA was precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the aqueous phase was then mixed with a 1:1 volume of isopropanol. cDNAs were then subjected to PCR using appropriate primers. RNA was transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with DIG-labeled DNA probes overnight at 50\u00b0C. the membrane was rinsed briefly (5 min) in washing buffer and blocked in blocking buffer for 30 min. the signal was detected with CDP-Star (Roche) according to manufacturer's instructions. antibodies against total eIF2, ATF3, ATF4, and TRIB3 were purchased from Abcam. IBV M protein, N protein, and S protein antibodies were raised in rabbits. after washing three times with TBST, the membrane was incubated with 1:2,000-diluted anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. the same volume of DMSO was added to another group of IBV-infected cells as a negative control. cells were harvested at 0, 12, and 20 hpi and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using GADD153 antibody. eIF2 phosphorylation was shown to be severely inhibited in IBV-infected cells at late stages of the infection cycle (25). phosphorylation status of eIF2 in IBV-infected cells was reexamined in more-detailed time course experiments. p-eIF2 was moderately increased at early time points in both cell lines. cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against phosphorylated PERK (p-PERK), total PERK, p-eIF2, total eIF2 and the IBV S protein. tubulin was used as a loading control. the fold increases in phosphorylation are indicated below the blots. late stages of infection, from 12 to 20 hpi in IBV-infected vero cells. lag between detection of ATF4 protein expression and eIF2 phosphorylation may reflect the time required for accumulation of the ATF4 protein. band intensities for ATF4 were determined and normalized to those for rRNA. rRNA intensity at 0 hpi was given a value of 1. (c) ATF3 mRNA is induced upon IBV infection. induction of ATF3 at the protein level coincided with the induction of ATF4 protein. it was then examined by Western blotting of vero and H1299 cells infected with live IBV and UV-IBV. no induction of the protein was observed in both cell lines incubated with UV-IBV. mRNA was increased from 12 to 20 hpi in both IBV-infected vero and H1299 cells. no induction of GADD153 at the mRNA level was detected. expression levels were elevated at 12 hpi and peaked at 20 hpi in UV-IBV-infected cells. the tubulin intensity at 0 hpi was given a value of 1. it was reported that GADD153 suppresses antiapoptotic Bcl2 expression (11) the protective effect of Bcl2 primarily stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane potential. in IBV-infected cells, basal level of TRIB3 protein was quite high. a mere 2-fold induction was observed from 12 to 20 hpi. this is consistent with a 38-fold induction of TRIB3 at the mRNA level. infected cells were not chosen for knockdown experiments due to their very low transfection efficiency. also, vero cells originated from africa green monkeys. so, siRNA duplexes designed according to human sequences may contain mismatches, resulting in a low knockdown efficiency of the siRNAs. significant cleavage of PARP was detected at 18 hpi (19%) and 20 hpi (30%) in cells transfected with siperK. no PARP cleavage was detected at 16 and 18 hpi. knockdown of PKR dramatically reduced IBV-induced apoptosis. tubulin was used as a loading control. for PERK, PKR, IBV N, IBV S, and GADD153, band intensities were determined. intensity for cells transfected with nontarget siRNA at each time point was given a value of 1. 2-AP is widely used to specifically inhibit PKR kinase activity. eIF2 phosphorylation was not suppressed by 2-AP at 16 hpi. PKR may not be the major kinase of eIF2 at this stage. ADD153 was not due to inhibition of IBV replication by 2-AP. these results confirm the role of PKR in IBV-induced eIF2 phosphorylation and GADD153 upregulation. the function of GADD34 in IBV-induced activation of the eIF2-ATF4-GADD153 pathway was further studied by addition of 20 M salubrinal to IBV-infected cells. salubrinal inhibits PP1C activity and prevents eIF2 dephosphorylation. the effect of GADD153 knockdown on IBV replication was examined by Western blotting. both IBV S and N protein expression levels were reduced 10 to 28% in GADD153-knockdown cells at 16, 18, and 20 hpi compared to those in the control cells. H1299 cells were transfected with siTRIB3 (+) or nontarget siRNA. infected with IBV (MOI of 2) or mock infected at 36 h posttransfection. tubulin was used as a loading control. inhibition of GADD153 expression reduces IBV-induced apoptosis. the effect of GADD153 knockdown on ERK phosphorylation was thus studied. a gradual increase in p-ERK1/2 over time was observed in IBV-infected cells transfected with either GADD153 siRNA or control siRNA. higher levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation were detected in TRIB3-knockdown cells infected with IBV. these results indicated that TRIB3, a known effector of GADD153, negatively modulated the IBV-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. this may be related to the proapoptotic activity of GADD153. eIF2 in IBV-infected vero and H1299 cells was reexamined in time course experiments. the level of p-eIF2 was shown to increase 4.6-fold at 8 hpi. a significant increase of p-eIF2 was also observed in IBV-infected vero and H1299 cells. band intensities for p-PERK and p-eIF2 were normalized to 0 hpi. phosphorylation of eIF2 in IBV-infected vero cells was given a value of 1. phosphorylation of eIF2 may inhibit general protein translation. northern blot analysis using an ATF4 probe showed that ATF4 induction was low to moderate at the mRNA level. the upregulation of ATF4 was due mainly to the translational enhancement. induction of the ATF3 gene, an ATF4 target gene (8), was examined by Northern blotting. level of ATF3 mRNA gradually increased from 12 hpi and peaked at 28 hpi in IBV-infected cells. fected with live IBV from 12 to 20 hpi. no induction of the protein was observed in both cell lines incubated with UV-IBV. this suggests that induction of ATF3 depends on active IBV replication. no induction of GADD153 protein was observed in UV-IBV-infected cells. vero and H1299 cells were infected with IBV (MOI of 1) or incubated with UV-IBV and harvested at indicated time points. RNA extraction and Northern blotting were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2b. Western blot analysis of protein lysates showed a gradual decrease in Bcl2 expression from 12 to 20 hpi in IBV-infected H1299 cells. however, the protein was relatively stable in IBV-infected vero cells. this discrepancy suggests that downregulation of Bcl2 during IBV infection may be cell type specific. TRIB3 is highly expressed in certain carcinomas, including lung, esophageal, and colonic tumors. the high basal level of TRIB3 in H1299 cells in our study further confirmed that the high expression of TRIB3 may be a common phenomenon in cancer cell lines. however, the induction of TRIB3 in IBV-infected cells may help to modulate both AKT kinase and ERK activities (28, 35\u201337), 99 cells transfected with siPERK, siPKR, or a nontarget control siRNA were infected with IBV at 36 h posttransfection and harvested at 16, 18 and 20 hpi. cleavage of PARP from the 116-kDa full-length protein [PARP(FL)] to an 85-kDa inactive polypeptide was used as a major biochemical marker of apoptosis. in cells transfected with siPKR, PARP cleavage was barely detectable even at 20 hpi, suggesting that knockdown of PKR dramatically reduced IBV-induced apoptosis. both PERK and PKR are involved in the IBV-induced upregulation of GADD153, which may in turn play a critical role in IBV-induced apoptosis. culture supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and subjected to plaque assay analysis using confluent monolayers of Vero cells. levels of two IBV structural proteins, N and S, were similar in cells transfected with siPERK, siPKR, and nontarget siRNA. this indicates that deficiency in either PERK or PKR did not significantly affect IBV replication in cells. phosphorylation of eIF2 was reduced in 2-AP-treated cells compared to control cells at 8 and 12 hpi. eIF2 phosphorylation was not suppressed by 2-AP at 16 hpi. PKR may not be the major kinase of eIF2 at this stage, possibly due to the dephosphorylation and inactivation of PKR. p-eIF2, total eIF2, GADD153, IBV N protein, and tubulin antibodies were harvested at the indicated time points. the intensities of p-eIF2, eIF2, GADD153, IBV N protein, and tubulin were determined by densitometry. both the phosphorylated form of eIF2 and GADD153 were significantly increased in IBV-infected cells treated with salubrinal and the control cells. levels of IBV N protein were comparable in cells treated with salubrinal and the control cells, suggesting that at 20 M, salubrinal did not significantly affect IBV replication. results show that virus replication is moderately suppressed in GADD153-knockdown cells. effect of TRIB3 knockdown on IBV-induced apoptosis may promote virus replication. effects of TRIB3 knockdown on IBV replication and apoptosis. tubulin was used as a loading control. densitometry and quantification performed as described for panel a. effect of ERK1/2 knockdown on IBV replication was then analyzed. significantly more p-ERK1/2 was detected in TRIB3-knockdown cells than in control cells. regulation of the ERK1/2 pathway by upregulation of GADD153 may play a functional role in modulating IBV-induced apoptosis. the level of ERK1/2 was reduced by 40 to 50% in siERK1/2-transfected cells. the level of IBV N protein was not significantly affected in ERK1/2-knockdown cells. however, PARP cleavage was found to be enhanced significantly in IBV-infected ERK1/2-knockdown cells at 18 and 20 hpi compared with the negative-control cells. IBV infection causes ER stress and induces PERK phosphorylation. GADD153 exerts its proapoptotic activities via suppressing Bcl2 and antagonizing the survival kinases (ERKs) many viruses have evolved strategies to induce ER stress and to modulate UPR. identification of specific IBV proteins involved in induction of UPR would provide insights into the mechanistic details of ER stress-mediated cell survival and apoptosis in IBV infection. however, transient expression of individual IBV proteins failed to induce UPR. this is in contrast to data published for SARS-CoV and MHV (43, 45) a relatively high basal level of p-PKR existed in cells before infection. the high basal level of p-PKR may have masked the detection of IBV-induced p-PKR. p-PERK and p-PKR were noted to be reduced at late infection stages. patitis C virus triggers apoptosis through induction of GADD153 and ER calcium depletion (50\u201353); Tula hantavirus triggers apoptosis through activation of caspase 12, phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun, and upregulation of GADD153 (54); japanese encephalitis virus induces UPR and promotes cell TRIB3 can also bind to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) and modulate MAPKK activity by either a positive-feed-forward or negative-feedback loop. knockdown of GADD153 delayed IBV-induced apoptosis and slightly reduced IBV replication in H1299 cells. our study provides a fuller picture of the activation of the eIF2-ATF4-GADD153 pathway. this work reveals the proapoptotic signaling of UPR in cells infected with IBV and provides new insights into IBV-induced apoptosis."}
