{"summary": "the Muslims Holy pilgrimage to Makkah and Madinah, Saudi Arabia is an annual event that records about 3 million pilgrims for Hajj. nearly 5 million pilgrims participating for the Minor Hajj known as Umrah conducted through the year (1, 2). hajj pilgrims from more than 180 countries across the globe visit Saudi Arabia for the 2 pilgrimages yearly (3). meningococcal quadrivalent (ACYW-135) polysaccharide vaccine is compulsory for intending Hajj pilgrims in line with the Saudi Arabia Government requirement. the vaccine confers immunity to an individual for 2 years (16, 17) both vaccines are strongly encouraged for pilgrims aged 50 years and above. the main purpose of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the uptake of the recommended vaccine among Malaysian Hajj pilgrims in the year 2018. the study is the part of a large quasi-experimental study conducted on Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims in the year 2018 that are traveling through private hajj companies. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out using simple and multiple logistic regression. crude odds ratio, adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as indicators of strength of association. p-value of 0.05 was used as the level for statistical significance. 1,274 of the 1,500 participants recruited from January to November 2018 returned the questionnaires. the age of the pilgrims range from 18 to 80 years with mean age with a standard deviation of 42.42 (15.67) the proportion of \u201cat increased risk\u201d pilgrims was 527 (41.4%) male pilgrims had 47 comorbidities. male pilgrims had 47. self-employed pilgrims and diploma holder had 48 and 84% higher chances of getting vaccinated than civil servants (AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = 0.82\u20132.67) and bachelor degree (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.25\u20132.70) 1 Pneumococcal vaccine Gender Female 1 1 Male 1.72 1.67 1.24\u20132.25 0.001 Marital status Married 1 1 Single 0.39 0.407 0.27\u20130.62 0.001 Divorced/widow 1.15 0.906 0.40\u20132.05 0.813 Occupation Civil servant 1 1 Self employed 1.65 1.70 0.98\u20132.93 0.058 Private sector 1.09 1.86 1.24\u20132.80 0.003 Pensioner 2.75 2.29 1.48\u2013 a previous Umrah experience (AOR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.20\u20132.07, P 0.001) increases the odds of being vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. however, being single (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.25\u20130.56, P 0.001) reduces the odds of being vaccinated against pneumococcal disease (Table 2). 0.85 Occupation Civil servant 1 1 Self employed 1.43 1.35 0.76\u20132.40 0.309 Private sector 1.57 2.39 1.59\u20133.58 0.001 Pensioner 2.35 1.95 1.25\u20133.03 0.003 House wife 1.80 1.42 0.80\u20132.56 0.230 Student 1.85 3.24 1.62\u20136.49 0.001 Educational level Bachelor 1 1 Diploma 1.83 1.90 1.30\u20132.79 0.001 Master 1.26 1.24 0.69\u20132.22 0.464 PhD 0.80 0. the uptake of the pneumococcal vaccine among marital status was 64 (14.9%), 248 (30.7), and 12 (34.3) for single, married and divorced/widowed pilgrims. being single (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.25\u20130.56, P 0.001) reduces the odds of being vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. the uptake of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine among pilgrims is lower than that in a previous study conducted among pilgrims from Saudi. the study also showed a similar low level of recommended vaccines uptake among Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims. french pilgrims (31.8%), Turkish pilgrims (77.1%), and pilgrims from australia (31.0%). this variation could be due to increased awareness and enlightenment following 2009/2010 influenza pandemic. influenza vaccine uptake among females (25.3%) is higher when compared to males (34.7%). the recommended vaccine's uptake among hajj and umrah pilgrims in 2018 is still very low based on the world health organization (WHO) goal of 75% coverage or higher among the \u201cat increased risk\u201d of infection pilgrims. additional studies are required to explore the barriers as well as motivators to bridge the knowledge gap. potential conflict of interest."}
