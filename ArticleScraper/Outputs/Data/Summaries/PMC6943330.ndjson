{"summary": "VSV-MERS/GFP was a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype. the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus was integrated with the GFP gene and coated with the spike protein of MERS-CoV. the infectivity of VSV-MERS/GFP was detected using fluorescence microscopy. serum from a rabbit immunized with recombinant MERS-CoV S protein was used as a positive control for neutralization. a medium composed of Eagle\u2019s MEM supplemented with 5% FBS was used for virus and serum dilution. 0.05 ml of test sera was mixed with equal volumes of 3,000 FFU of VSV-MERS/GFP. the neutralization titer was determined as the highest serum dilution showing at least 50% CPE on the inoculated cells. ELISA microplates were coated with 50 l of 50 ng/ml antigen per well at 4\u00b0C overnight. diluted serum samples were added and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. mammalian expression plasmid pCAGGS-RBD encodes histidine-tagged MERS-CoV RBD (amino acid 358\u2013588) was transfected to 293T cells. at 2 days after transfection, the recombinant RBD was purified from the supernatant of transfected cells. 100 Pseudovirus VSV-MERS/GFP, a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype, was used in the neutralization test. the infectivity of VSV-MERS/GFP was detected based on GFP expression observed using fluorescence microscopy. 293T and Vero cells were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum from a rabbit immunized with recombinant MERS-CoV S protein was used as a positive control for neutralization. a medium composed of Eagle\u2019s MEM supplemented with 5% FBS was used for virus and serum dilution. the neutralization titer was determined as the highest serum dilution showing 50% of the number of positive GFP-positive cells compared with the no serum control. the neutralization titer was determined as the highest serum dilution showing at least 50% CPE on the inoculated cells. ELISA microplates were coated with 50 l of 50 ng/ml antigen per well at 4\u00b0C overnight. after further washing, diluted serum samples were added and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. recombinant plasmid pCAGGS-RBD encodes histidine-tagged MERS-CoV RBD (amino acid 358\u2013588) was transfected to 293T cells. at 2 days after transfection, the recombinant RBD was purified from the supernatant of transfected cells. antibody titers of 16 are treated as positive in neutralization test using VSV-MERS/GFP. dromedary camels and cattle, 31 out of 38 and 1 out of 15, respectively, were MERS antibody positive. in 15 camels, the antibody titer was 16 or 32; in 7, it was 64 or 128; and in 9 and control positive rabbit serum, it was 256. 26 camels and 1 cow were positive in the neutralization test using MERS-CoV. the sera collected as negative controls from animals on the attached farm of Nihon University were all negative in S1-ELISA and cELISA. dromedary camels and cattle, 31 out of 38 and 1 out of 15, respectively, were MERS antibody positive. in 15 camels, the antibody titer was 16 or 32; in 7, it was 64 or 128; and in 9 and control positive rabbit serum, it was 256. all sera collected from animals on the attached farm of Nihon University were negative.
