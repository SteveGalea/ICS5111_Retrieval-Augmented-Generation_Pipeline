{"summary": "mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland, USA. the institutions\u2019 Animal Care and Use Committees approved all protocols for animal experiments. influenza viruses used were A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (3), A/FM/1/47-MA (H1N1) (16), and A/Thailand/SP-83/2004 (H5N1) (17). the plasmid pCR3-M2 was derived by PCR from the vector pCR3-M previously generated from A/PR/8 virus by reverse transcription\u2013PCR. full-length consensus M2 cDNA with Kozak sequence at its 5\u2032 end was generated from 2 overlapping M2 DNA fragments and subcloned into VR-1012. the sequence of the M2 insert was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequence analysis. immunoization Mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 40 g peptide-KLH or unconjugated KLH in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. three weeks later, the mice were given an intraperitoneal booster injection with peptide-KLH in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. in some experiments, mice were given a booster injection of rAd intramuscularly at a dose of 1010 particles/mouse. splenocytes were depleted of erythrocytes and labeled with antimouse B220, CD11b, and PanNK antibodies. surveillance continued until all animals died or were recovering. unlabeled T cells and labeled non\u2013T cells were separated through the Miltenyi AutoMACS system. ELISPOT IP plates were coated with 50 L of Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution containing 5 g/mL of anti\u2013interferon- (IFN-) MAb AN18 (BD Pharmingen) the membrane was washed and then blocked with medium for 60\u201390 min at room temperature. Virus Quantitation Lungs were homogenized in 1 mL of sterile PBS. the limit of virus detection is 1.2 log10 EID50/mL. challenge virus stocks were titrated on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. some virus stocks were propagated in the allantoic cavity of embryonated hen eggs at 34\u00b0C for 48\u201372 h (A/PR/8) or 37\u00b0C for 24 h (SP-83) influenza A NP147\u2013155 and M2e peptides were synthesized in the core facility of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration. full-length consensus M2 cDNA with Kozak sequence at its 5\u2032 end was generated from 2 overlapping M2 DNA fragments. the sequence of the M2 insert was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequence analysis. the replication-incompetent adenovirus expressed the M2 protein with the consensus sequence (M2-Ad) was constructed by using Gateway cloning and the ViraPower Adenoviral Expression System. three weeks later, the mice were given an intraperitoneal booster injection with peptide-KLH in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant; 13 days later blood was collected. DNA vaccination at doses of 50 g/mouse was given intramuscularly in the quadriceps, half to each leg, in 3 doses 2 weeks apart. ELISA ELISA for M2-specific antibodies was performed on plates coated with 15 g/mL of synthetic peptides. splenocytes were depleted of erythrocytes and labeled with biotinylated antimouse B220, CD11b, and PanNK antibodies. ELISPOT IP plates were coated with 50 L of Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution containing 5 g/mL of anti\u2013interferon- (IFN-) MAb AN18 (BD Pharmingen) the membrane was washed and then blocked with medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 60\u201390 min at room temperature. the limit of virus detection is 1.2 log10 EID50/mL. challenge virus stocks were titrated on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. some vaccinations were repeated with independent groups. each M2e-immune serum sample reacted with M2e-PR8, M2e-FM, and M2e-H5(SP-83) peptides. cross-reactions were lower on the M2e-H5(HK) peptide. the mice were given an intraperitoneal booster with KLH or M2e-peptide/KLH in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. immunoglobulin (Ig) G reactive to various M2e peptides by ELISA. plates were coated with M2e-PR8 (panel A), M2e-FM (panel B), M2e-H5(SP-83) (panel C), or M2e-H5(HK) (panel D) ectodomain.m2-DNA Vaccination To investigate whether, like M2e peptide, DNA vaccination could protect against viruses with quite divergent M2e sequence, we tested M- and M2-DNA for efficacy. M2-DNA with the consensus sequence also protected against challenge with A/PR/8. however, M1-DNA did not (data not shown). a/M2 gene with the consensus sequence was cloned into a replication-deficient Ad construct (M2-Ad) Mice were primed with DNA as before and boosted with M2-Ad or control B/NP-Ad. two weeks later, serum samples were collected and assayed for M2-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G by ELISA. protective immunity due to vaccination with M2-DNA+M2-Ad was tested by challenge with A/PR/8 or A/FM virus. of mice vaccinated with M2-DNA+M2-Ad, 100% survived challenge with A/PR/8 and A/FM virus. of mice vaccinated with B/NP-DNA+B/NP-Ad, 20% survived challenge with A/PR/8 and none survived challenge with A/FM. of the B/NP control mice, 100% died of A/PR/8 infection by day 8 after challenge. 100% of M2-immune mice treated with a control MAb (SFR) survived. individual depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells did not abrogate protection. M2e-specific immunity has been reported to be natural killer (NK)-cell dependent (21) five months after mice received the Ad boost, spleen cells were isolated and pooled from immune mice (n = 10) spleen cells were fractionated into T-cell and non-T-cell populations. recipients were challenged with 10 LD50 of A/PR/8 and monitored for survival. all (100%) mice given serum from M2-immune or A/PR/8-infected mice survived. only 50% given control B/NP-immune serum survived. a random subset of animals was killed and their lung virus titers were measured. mice were vaccinated with matrix protein 2 (M2)\u2013DNA plus M2-adenovirus (Ad) seventeen days after Ad boost, mice were challenged with 10 50% lethal dose (LD50) of SP-83 (H5N1) mice were humanely killed on day 5 and their lungs were assayed for virus titer. serum from KLH-immune mice did not react with any of the peptides. each M2e-immune serum sample reacted with M2e-PR8, M2e-FM, and M2e-H5(SP-83) peptides. cross-reactions were lower on the M2e-H5(HK) peptide. mice were immunized intraperitoneally with KLH or M2e peptides conjugated to KLH. after 21 days, the mice were given an intraperitoneal booster with KLH or M2e-peptide/KLH in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. antibody serum was collected 13 days after booster and assayed for immunoglobulin (Ig) G reactive to various M2e peptides by ELISA. M2-DNA Vaccination To investigate whether, like M2e peptide, DNA vaccination could protect against viruses with quite divergent M2e sequence, we tested M- and M2-DNA for efficacy. for challenge with A/FM, M2-DNA was more efficacious than M-DNA (Figure 3B). boosting with rAd induces more potent antibody and T-cell (especially CD8+) responses than does DNA vaccination alone. the A/M2 gene with the consensus sequence was cloned into a replication-deficient Ad construct (M2-Ad) mice were primed with DNA as before and boosted with M2-Ad or control B/NP-Ad. two weeks later, serum samples were collected and assayed for M2-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) protective immunity due to vaccination with M2-DNA+M2-Ad was tested by challenge with A/PR/8 (high-dose) or A/FM virus. of mice vaccinated with M2-DNA+M2-Ad, 100% survived challenge with A/PR/8 and A/FM virus. we immunized mice to M2 by prime-boost and acutely depleted them of T cells just before and during the challenge period. residual CD4+ or CD8+ cells were 1%. of the B/NP control mice, 100% died of A/PR/8 infection by day 8 after challenge. survival rates differed significantly for mice depleted of both T-cell subsets. some protection remained, which differed significantly from that of the B/NP control. mice were immunized with M2-DNA+M2-Ad as described under A. spleen cells were fractionated by magnetic bead separation. non\u2013T-cell fraction did not respond, while the unfractionated cells and T-cell fraction maintained a strong M2-specifc IFN- response. all (100%) mice given serum from M2-immune or A/PR/8-infected mice survived, while only 50% given control B/NP-immune serum survived. all (100%) A/NP-immune mice died of SP-83 infection by day 11 postchallenge. all (100%) A/NP-immune mice and all but 1 M2-immune mouse survived. mice were vaccinated with A/NP-DNA, M2-DNA, or B/NP-DNA. anti-M2 antibodies in the serum of mice immunized with M DNA suggest expression of M2 from this plasmid. however, reactivity could be due to the 9 amino acid portion shared with the M1 sequence. we found cross-reactivity with M2e peptides that had considerable sequence divergence from the human influenza M2 consensus. cross-reactivity was low on avian peptides M2e-H5(SP-83) and M2e-H5(HK) cross-reactivity was low on the HK peptide. serum antibodies induced by peptide conjugates or by prime-boost vaccination could transfer protection to naive recipients. a study of forced escape mutants found limited diversity. the cross-reactivity and protective efficacy of M2-specific antibodies suggest that M2-specific MAbs could be useful for antiviral therapy. a prime-boost regimen is intended to be combined with vaccination against additional antigens. might reduce deaths and severity of disease while strain-matched vaccines were being prepared. could enhance protection afforded by inactivated vaccines."}
