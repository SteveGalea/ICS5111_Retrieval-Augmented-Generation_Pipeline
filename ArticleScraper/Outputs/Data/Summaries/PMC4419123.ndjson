{"summary": "enterovirus 71 (HEV71) is a positive-stranded RNA virus of approximately 7500 nucleotides. the viral genome contains an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of 2194 amino acids. the ORF is flanked by 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions. smaller epidemics have been detected in the united states and european countries. the cause of large epidemics of HFMD and acute neurological disease remains elusive. there are currently no effective clinical therapies or vaccine for HEV71 associated HFMD. natural therapeutic products have been used in many countries in Asia for centuries. they have gradually been adopted by western medical treatment and health care. 80% of the global population still relies on traditional medicine for primary health care. the most widely published natural molecules in association with HEV71 infection are ellagitannins, from the family of hydrolysable tannins. they are characterised by the presence of one or more hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) unit(s) on a glucopyranose core. it was found to block interactions between cell surface glycosaminoglycans and HSV-1 glycoproteins. it is possible that chebulagic acid activity against HEV71 is related to the inhibition of viral absorption and/or entry. further studies are required to elucidate the anti-HEV71 mechanism of hydrolysable ellagitannins, but results thus far suggest that they constitute a potential source for antiviral discovery. chrysosplenetin and penduletin are flavonoids that have all been shown to exhibit in vitro anti-HEV71 activity. chrysosplenetin and penduletin are flavonoids that have been shown to exhibit in vitro anti-HEV71 activity. lycorine treatment significantly enhanced the survival rate of HEV71-infected mice. Deferoxamine (DFO), a marine natural product derived from Streptomyces pilosus, was found to compensate for decreased levels of B cells caused by HEV71 infection in mice. the clinical symptoms, muscle damage and mortality were ameliorated by DFO treatment. high dose of ribavirin may raise serious safety concerns. the life cycle of HEV71 generally involves virus attachment, uncoating and entry, polyprotein translation and cleavage, viral RNA replication, and virus assembly. Pleconaril (WIN 61893) was the first of a new generation of metabolically stable capsid function inhibitors. pleconaril reduced viral titres in all affected organs and prevented death in animals. pyridyl imidazolidinone derivatives demonstrated effectiveness against HEV71 infec tion. soluble form of HEV71 receptors, SCARB2 and PSGL-1, has been shown to block virus-host interaction[55,56] antibodies against these receptors have also been shown to inhibit in vitro virus infection. a 15-mer peptide spanning from position 118 to 132 in the VP1 capsid region, SP40, exhibited antiviral activity in all three genotypes of HEV71. it also reduced viral induced CPE and viral RNA synthesis in vero, HeLa and HT-29 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. a major disadvantage of peptides is their low bioavailability due to their rapid degradation in the gastrointestinal system. rupintrivir, an irreversible peptidomimetic inhibitor of viral 3C protein, has been evaluated in a mouse model[67]. complete protection against HEV71-induced cell death was observed at low nanomolar concentrations, with very little cell toxicity. ATA slows down viral RNA synthesis after a single round of viral replication in HEV71-infected cells. but ATA did not inhibit the activity of HEV71 viral 2A/3C protease activity. NITD008 has been reported to selectively inhibit viruses within the family Flaviviridae. a previous study has shown that HEV71 infection induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandins (PG) E2 expression via mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including ERK and p38. inhibition of HEV71-induced COX-2/PGE2 expression may reduce CNS inflammation. further in vivo studies are required to validate the effectiveness of the drug. the wide existence of cross reactivity between enterovirus antibodies may also become the underlying risk for HEV71 ADE infections. a solution would be to exploit future passive immunotherapy based on monoclonal antibodies. they offer a selective advantage over pooled human sera that are more commonly used in IVIG treatment by reducing the risks mentioned above. ener et al[90] succeeded in isolating a novel mAb against HEV71. the mAb 10D3 targets a conformational neutralisation epitope outside of VP3. all mice prophylactically treated with mAb 10D3 survived the challenge without showing any disease symptoms. study suggested that the adoptive transfer of macrophage cells from adult mice can partly protect young mice from lethal HEV71 infection. the macrophages displayed anti-HEV71 activity in vitro and could alleviate the pathology of infected mice. IFNs with high anti-HEV71 activities at low concentrations, IFNs with moderate anti-HEV71 activity at high concentrations, and IFNs with nearly no antiviral activities. they found that HEV71 could be effectively inhibited by combination of IFN- and a 3Cpro inhibitor such as rupintrivir. oligonucleotides are highly unstable in vivo due to rapid nuclease digestion. phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, locked nucleic acids, and gene-silencing oligonucleotides have been developed. vivo-MO-1 and -2 showed significantly reduced plaque numbers, viral RNA copies, and viral capsid expression in RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. both vivo-MO-1 and 2 remained active when administered within 4 h before or 6 h after HEV71 infection. most natural therapeutic products work as a mixture, and thus it is difficult to characterise the detailed antiviral mechanisms. traditional Chinese medicines have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy by ameliorating the symptoms of the disease and/or shortening the course of the disease[20]. hydrolysable ellagitannins have previously shown medicinal values and antiviral effects. treatment with hydrolysable ellagitannins such as corilagin[26], geraniin[27], punicalagin[25] and chebulagic acid[28] enhanced the survival time and reduce mortality of HEV71-infected mice. flavonoids are a broad class of low molecular weight secondary metabolites that are present in all vascular plants. flavonoids are known to be responsible for the bioactivities of plant crude extracts to confer protection against UV radiation, pathogens, and herbivores. lycorine, one of the most abundant alkaloids of Amaryllidaceae, inhibited HEV71 replication in cultured cells. lycorine treatment significantly enhanced the survival rate of HEV71-infected mice. viral replication in the muscle tissues of DFO-treated mice was slightly inhibited. the possible mechanism of DFO activity against HEV71 was through the upregulation of B cells, and not the direct inhibition of HEV71. lead compounds that inhibit virus attachment, uncoating and entry are being actively pursued. inhibitors of post-infection stages may be suitable for treatment. both pre- and post-infection inhibitors of HEV71 are discussed in detail below. NITD008 In vitro / in vivo Inhibits viral 3D polymerase activity More potent than ribavirin in vivo May have toxicity issue, resistant mutants [82,83] Sorafenib In vitro Block virus induced activation of ERK/p38 Licensed for cancer treatment N/A [84,85] signalling pathways N/A: Not available. Pleconaril (WIN 61893) was the first of lactoferrin (LF) inhibited infection in vitro and in vivo by binding to the VP1 protein of HEV71, as well as to host cells. the anti-HEV71 mechanism of LF is unclear, but may relate to the prevention of viral entry by blocking cellular receptors and/or by direct binding to the virus particles. a major disadvantage of peptides is their low bioavailability due to their rapid degradation in the gastrointestinal system. a major obstacle of this approach is for it to be cost-effective for resource-limited countries where large outbreaks frequently occur. a previous clinical trial for rupintrivir for the treatment of human rhinovirus infection was halted due to a lack of efficacy in natural infection studies. a previous clinical trial for rupintrivir for the treatment of human rhinovirus infection was halted due to a lack of efficacy in natural infection studies. NITD008 potently inhibits HEV71 in cell culture and in a mouse model. their data further showed that mutations in viral 3A and 3D polymerase regions could confer resistance against NITD008. sorafenib is a multi-target tyrosine and serine-threonine kinase inhibitor currently used in cancer therapy. neutralising antibodies stimulated by immunisation with inactivated virus, virus-like proteins, or VP1 subunit vaccines, are cross-protective against heterologous strains of HEV71. studies on patients have indicated that HEV71 infection is cleared by humoral immunity. a mAb (clone 22A12) with strong neutralising activity against HEV71 in an in vitro neutralisation assay was successfully generated. clone 22A12 is a murine antibody, further work is underway to reduce human anti-mouse antibody response for therapeutic application. mAbs must cross-neutralise all existing subtypes to be useful. a combination of synergistic mAbs may also reduce the required dosage. the use of non-human immunoglobulins in the treatment of HEV71 infection has also been investigated. the application of macrophages in antiviral therapy via adoptive transfer is a novel proposal. unlike human macrophage, murine macrophage can be obtained either from the peritoneal cavity or grown from bone marrow precursor cells. all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is the natural ligand for the retinoic acid receptors (RAR) it regulates the expression of a number of IFN-stimulated genes, including retinoid-induced gene I (RIG-I), a pattern recognition receptor involved in the innate immune response. the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASODN) technology to inhibit pathogen replication has shown promising results. unmodified oligonucleotides are highly unstable in vivo due to rapid nuclease digestion. a number of chemically modified oligonucleotides have been developed. vivo-MO-1 and -2 showed significantly reduced plaque numbers, viral RNA copies, and viral capsid expression in RD cells. both vivo-MO-1 and 2 remained active when administered within 4 h before or 6 h after HEV71 infection. vivo-MO-2 was proposed to be a favourable candidate for further development as an antiviral agent. HFMD has become a notifiable disease in many countries in the region. however, concurrent virological surveillance may provide invaluable molecular epidemiological data to help track the spread of the virus across the region. infected children are quarantined and non-infected children are kept from crowds. a vaccine strategy, similar to that against poliovirus infection, could be effective to control HEV71 infection. a successful vaccine strain would also provide cross-protection to different HEV71 genotypes. cynomolgus monkey sera demonstrated a broad spectrum of cross-genotype neutralising activity. reversion of mutants to wild-type virus makes it easier for mutants to return to wild-type virus. replacement of PV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) with that of a non-neurotropic human rhinovirus (HRV) found to stably attenuate PV in animal models. passive transfer of serum from formalin-inactivated and heat-inactivated virus vaccine immunised adult mice could provide protection against HEV71 challenge in neonatal mice[157,158]. the efficacy of this model of maternal vaccination-neonatal challenge is consistent with the results of other similar studies using maternal vaccination to protect offspring from infectious disease[159-162]. key neutralising antibody determinants have been found in the N-terminal half of VP1 when tested with high titre human neutralising antibodies[169,170]. the potential safety advantage of subunit vaccines over conventional whole virus vaccines has prompted researchers to question whether the VP1 subunit of HEV71 is sufficient to provoke adequate protective immunity against viral infection. transgenic tomato fruit expressing the VP1 subunit was developed as a free-feeding oral vaccine[179]. transgenic tomato fruit expressing the VP1 subunit was able to neutralise the infection of HEV71 in RD cells. overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the VP1 capsid protein of HEV71 were used to immunise BALB/c mice in order to identify neutralising linear epitopes. mouse antisera raised against the peptide 208-222, designated SP70, demonstrated in vivo passive protective efficacy in BALB/c mice. a patent for these recombinant baculoviruses has been applied for in Taiwan, the united states and mainland China. a patent for these recombinant baculoviruses has been applied for in Taiwan, the united states and mainland China. ated vaccines generated comparable amount of HEV71-binding antibodies measured by ELISA. but monkeys immunised with inactivated virus showed relatively greater neutralisation titre, proliferation, and cytokine production than those immunised with VLPs. the main problem associated with VLPs is their stability, purification and cost. DNA vaccines encoding several antigens or proteins can be delivered to the host in a single dose at low quantity to induce immune responses. they are also very temperature stable making storage and transport much easier. if DNA vaccines pass all scientific and regulatory scrutiny, they promise to be products of the next generation. comparison of human enterovirus 71 vaccine strategies Vaccines Tested Advantages Disadvantages Ref. oviruses such as CVA8, CVA10, and CVA16 can also cause HFMD. concurrent virological surveillance may provide invaluable molecular epidemiological data to help track the spread of the virus across the region. a vaccine strategy, similar to that against poliovirus infection, suggests. cynomolgus monkeys inoculated with EV71 (S1-3\u2019) via intravenous route had a mild neurological symptom in the form of tremor, but survived lethal challenge by virulent HEV71. a successful vaccine strain would also provide cross-protection to different HEV71 genotypes. a non-neurotropic human rhinovirus (HRV) was found to stably attenuate PV in animal models. deletion of stem-loop domain Z within the 3\u2019-untranslated region attenuates the growth of a HEV71-HRV2-IRES chimera in neuroblastoma cells[151]. another strategy employed to generate stably attenuated vaccine strains is to increase replication fidelity. antisera used against newly emerging subgenogroups could cross-neutralise their ancestor subgenogroups, but not vice versa. co-immunisation of a formaldehyde-inactivated HEV71 vaccine with a commercial pentavalent vaccine contained inactivated polio vaccine did not interfere in antibody production. the potential safety advantage of subunit vaccines over conventional whole virus vaccines has prompted researchers to question whether the VP1 subunit of HEV71 is sufficient to provoke adequate protective immunity against viral infection. the mucosal immune system serves as the first line of defense against HEV71 as it initiates disease following implantation in the gut mucosa[173]. transgenic tomato fruit expressing the VP1 subunit was developed as a free-feeding oral vaccine[179]. the bovine -lactalbumin promoter and S1-casein signal peptide sequence were fused with the VP1 cDNA to generate transgenic mice with mammary gland-specific VP1 expression. mouse antisera raised against the peptide 208-222, designated SP70, demonstrated in vivo passive protective efficacy in BALB/c mice[183]. the amino acid sequence represented by SP70 was totally conserved amongst 25 HEV71 strains from subgenogroups A, B1-B5 and C1-C4. this suggests possible cross-protection against infectivity of all HEV71 strains. the Vac6 comprises the peptides of P70\u2013159, P140\u2013249, P324\u2013443 and P746\u2013876 of the structural proteins. to assemble the HEV71 VLPs, the P1 polyprotein needs to be cleaved by viral protease 3CD into individual structural proteins. immunisation with VLPs has less of a response than inactivated vaccine. but they provide a safer method for preventing viral infection. the main problem associated with VLPs is their stability, purification and cost. Tung et al[190] developed a HEV71 DNA vaccine by inserting the VP1 gene into a eukaryotic expression vector and evaluated the immune response in mice. they showed that while anti-VP1 IgG level was increased in immunised mice, the level declined after boosting immunisation. enterovirus 71 vaccine strategies Vaccines Tested Advantages Disadvantages Ref. Live-attenuated vaccine In vitro / in vivo Broad spectrum, low cost Incomplete attenuation Inability to replicate High cost [150-162] Subunit vaccine In vitro / in vivo Safe to use Unstable, need purification, high cost [162,182-185] DNA vaccine In vitro / in vivo Most resemble native virus, fast production self-propagating live attenuated vaccines can be produced at much lower unit cost. however, self-propagating live attenuated vaccines are likely to be more cost-effective."}
