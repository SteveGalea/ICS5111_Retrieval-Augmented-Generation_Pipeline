{"summary": "by the end of 2002, a novel coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) emerged in china and rapidly spread worldwide causing around 8000 infections leading to death in 10% of the cases. in 2012 a novel coronavirus infecting humans, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) appeared in Saudi Arabia and disseminated to nine additional countries. SARS-CoV E protein is a 76-amino acid transmembrane protein actively synthesized during viral infection. it localizes at the ERGIC region of the cell, where virus budding and morphogenesis take place [15]\u2013[18]. Interestingly, deletion of E gene from mouse hepatitis virus or SARS-CoV does not abolish virus production. the ion channel activity of SARS-CoV E protein was mapped within the transmembrane domain of the protein by using synthetic peptides [31], [34], [35] both ion conductance and selectivity of E protein ion channel were highly controlled by the charge of the lipid membranes. this suggests that lipid head-groups are components of the channel structure facing the lumen of the pore. replacement of genus CoV infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein transmembrane domain lacking this function interfered with an efficient trafficking and release of the viral progeny in the infected cells. mutation of threonine at position 16 to alanine, which is predicted to inhibit IC activity in IBV E protein did not affect virus-like particles formation, suggesting a multifunctional role of E protein [40] coxsackievirus 2B protein alters Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ and H+ concentrations. this delay protein transport through the secretory pathway facilitating virus assembly. mutant versions of M2 protein that conduct Na+ and K+ ions apart from H+ ions more strongly elicit the inflammasome response. rSARS-CoV-E-N15A (N15A) and rSARS-CoV-E-V25F (V25F) were engineered. a set of synthetic peptides representing the transmembrane domain of E protein were first identified for their IC activity. infection of mice with SARS-CoV MA15 accurately reproduces the symptoms of human disease [27], [60]. mutant viruses were efficiently rescued, cloned by three rounds of plaque purification, and their sequence was confirmed. to test whether the introduced mutations may alter E protein subcellular localization affecting other functions of the protein, vero E6 cells were infected with the wt virus, the viruses lacking IC activity (N15A and V25F) vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells were infected either with mutant viruses (N15A and V25F), the parental virus (wt) or a virus lacking E gene (E) at an MOI of 0.3, fixed at 24 hpi and E protein (green) and ERGIC (red) were labeled with specific antibodies. a long-term competition assay was performed between the wt virus and the wt virus in a proportion 73. the proportion of wt virus steadily increased over the passages. from passage 8 on, the wt virus took and maintained majority over the N15A mutant. infected mice were serially passaged 20 times every 24 hours. a ratio of 73 and supernatants was determined by sequencing E gene within viral progeny. Error bars represent the standard deviation from three independent experiments. mice were intranasally inoculated with the wt virus displaying E protein IC activity. wt virus and N15A mutant virus remained stable during the experiment. no changes were found in viral RNA extracted either from lungs of several mice at 2 and 4 dpi or from dead mice. these evolved variants of the V25F virus appeared as early as 2 days after mice infection. group of 11 16 week-old mice were infected with 100000 PFU of either the parental virus (wt) or three clones of the mutant viruses missing IC activity. bars represent different E protein sequences, either that of parental or the mutant viruses. mutant viruses lacking E protein IC activity are prone to evolve and restore ion conductivity. mutant viruses were serially passaged in cell culture. wt virus remained stable during the passages. peptides containing the original mutations N15A and V25F did not show any conductance. all the peptides containing the mutations obtained after viral evolution showed similar conductance values. blue and red circles correspond to amino acids N15 and V25, respectively, originally mutated to inhibit IC activity. mutant viruses lacking IC activity (N15A and V25F) were reconstituted in artificial lipid bilayers. their IC activity was analyzed as mean conductance values. negative controls indicate conductance values obtained in absence of any peptide. a recombinant SARS-CoV containing the mutation restored IC activity in N15A mutant after cell culture passage was engineered rSARS-CoV-E-N15D (N15D) the mutant induced similar morbidity and mortality as wt ( Fig. 8 ). in agreement with the V25F revertants, the mutant induced similar morbidity and mortality as wt. the virus lacking IC activity (N15A) grew to the same extent or even better than the wt and the revertant viruses, respectively, reaching titers higher than 108 and 107 PFU/gr of lung tissue at 2 and 4 dpi. these data indicate that E protein IC activity does not significantly affect virus production in vivo. mutants were collected at 2 and 4 dpi, stained with hematoxylin and eosin. they showed wide free alveolar and bronchiolar airways and no evidence of leukocyte infiltrates in the infected areas. the histopathology caused by IC proficient viruses was even more dramatic at 4 dpi. at 2 and 4 dpi 3 mice from each group were sacrificed and their lungs were collected. asterisks indicate edema accumulation in both bronchiolar and alveolar airways. bronchoalveolar epithelia ARDS originated from the accumulation of a protein rich edema. at 2 dpi many infected cells (around 16%) were observed in lungs of mice infected with either wt or N15A virus. both viruses presented similar cell tropisms within lungs, infecting bronchiolar epithelium and alveolar epithelium. at 4 dpi the number of infected cells was dramatically reduced. dpi mice were mock infected or infected with 100000 PFU of parental virus. dpi mice were sacrificed and their lungs were fixed in formalin. bronchiolar epithelia at an original magnification of 189 are shown in the rows. mRNA expression and translation to generate the inactive form of the protein pro-IL-1. pro-IL-1 is then cleaved by caspase-1 through inflammasome activation. this leads to the secretion of active IL-1 to the extracellular media. groups of six 16 week-old BALB/c mice were mock infected with 100000 PFU of the parental virus (wt) displaying E protein IC activity or mutant virus lacking IC activity N15A. at 2 dpi 3 mice from each group were sacrificed and their lungs were collected. NF and IL-6 levels were more dramatically increased in wt-infected mice. IL-6 levels were at least 2.5-fold lower when E protein IC activity was absent during infection. the presence of E protein IC activity correlates with activation of the inflammasome and an acute inflammatory response that is deleterious for lung tissue. infection of mice with SARS-CoV MA15 accurately reproduces symptoms of human disease [27], [60]. mutant viruses were efficiently rescued, cloned by three rounds of plaque purification, and their sequence was confirmed. to test whether the introduced mutations may alter E protein subcellular localization affecting other functions of the protein, vero E6 cells were infected with the wt virus. rSARS-CoV-EIC cells were infected either with mutant viruses (N15A and V25F), the parental virus (wt) or a virus lacking E gene (E) at an MOI of 0.3, fixed at 24 hpi and E protein (green) and ERGIC (red) were labeled with specific antibodies. nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) original magnification was 126. IC activity formed smaller plaques than wt virus, and V25F virus plaques were smaller than N15A virus. cytopathic effect may be induced when E protein IC is present, rendering bigger plaques. competition assays between parental virus (wt, black circles) displaying IC activity (EIC+) and a mutant virus. vero E6 cells were co-infected with mutant and parental viruses at a ratio 73. supernatants were serially passaged 20 times every 24 hours. relative abundance of each virus was determined by sequencing E gene within viral progeny. the virus genome region containing E gene was sequenced, as it was the target of the point mutations inhibiting IC activity. no changes were found in viral RNA extracted either from several mice at 2 and 4 dpi or from dead mice. wt virus and N15A mutant virus remained stable throughout the experiment. group of 11 16 week-old BALB/c mice were infected with 100000 PFU of either the parental virus (wt) or three clones of the mutant viruses missing IC activity. at 2 dpi and 4 dpi 3 mice of each group were sacrificed, lung RNA was extracted and E gene was sequenced. mutant viruses lacking E protein IC activity are prone to evolve and restore ion conductivity. two clones of mutants were serially passaged in cell culture. wt virus remained stable during the passages, reproducing in vivo observations. the IC activity of these peptides was evaluated in artificial lipid membranes. all the peptides containing the mutations obtained after viral evolution showed similar conductance values than a wild type peptide. blue and red circles correspond to amino acids N15 and V25, respectively, originally mutated to inhibit IC activity. mutant viruses lacking IC activity were reconstituted in artificial lipid bilayers. their IC activity was analyzed as mean conductance values. negative controls (C) indicate conductance values obtained in the absence of any peptide. recombinant mutant was engineered rSARS-CoV-E-N15D (N15D) mutant induced similar morbidity and mortality as wt. mutation restored IC activity in mutant after cell culture passage. mutant N15D induced similar morbidity and mortality as wt. 16 week-old mice were infected with 100000 PFU of viruses displaying E protein IC activity (EIC+), either the parental virus (wt, black columns) or the genetically engineered revertant viruses N15D and V25F T30I displaying IC activity. the virus lacking IC activity (N15A) grew to the same extent or even better than the wt and the revertant viruses. IC revertants and N15A mutant were collected at 2 and 4 dpi. animals showed wide free alveolar and bronchiolar airways and no evidence of leukocyte infiltrates. the histopathology caused by IC proficient viruses was even more dramatic at 4 dpi. BALB/c mice were mock infected with 100000 PFU of viruses displaying E protein IC activity (EIC+), either the parental virus (wt) or the genetically engineered revertant viruses V25F T30I and N15D. at 2 and 4 dpi 3 mice from each group were sacrificed and their lungs were collected. at 2 dpi many infected cells (around 16%) were observed in lungs of mice infected with either wt or N15A virus. both viruses presented similar cell tropisms within lungs, infecting bronchiolar epithelium (between 60\u201370% of the cells) and alveolar epithelium (around 10% of the cells) 16 week-old mice were mock infected with 100000 PFU of parental virus. lungs were fixed in formalin, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for immunofluorescence. bronchiolar epithelia at an original magnification of 189 are shown in rows of the bottom. pro-IL-1 mRNA is then cleaved by caspase-1 through inflammasome activation. this leads to the secretion of active IL-1 to the extracellular media. this leads to the secretion of active IL-1 in the lungs of infected mice. groups of six 16 week-old BALB/c mice were mock infected or infected with 100000 PFU of the parental virus. IL-1 enhances the production of TNF, another key early response cytokine. analysis of IL-6 levels in wt-infected mice at 4 dpi revealed a more sustained increase in wt-infected mice. IL-6 levels were at least 2.5-fold lower when E protein IC activity was absent during infection. the presence of E protein IC activity correlates with activation of the inflammasome. a selective advantage of IC activity has also been shown for influenza virus. a selective advantage of IC activity has also been shown for influenza virus. a selective advantage of IC activity has also been shown. no reversion of E protein IC activity was observed for N15A mutant in mice. mutant restored ion channel activity after long number (>24) of passages in cell culture. replacement of N at position 15 to A is not likely to affect channel architecture. reverting E protein ion conductivity, and not adaptation to mice, was its main goal. mutations restoring ion channel activity appeared both in mice and in cell culture. this is the first time in which a viroporin is directly linked to the virulence of the virus. late stages of ARDS are characterized by pulmonary edema that leads to an impaired gas exchange, hypoxemia and eventually death. infection of mice with rSARS-CoV-MA15 resulted in abundant edema accumulation both in alveolar and bronchiolar spaces at late times post infection (4 dpi) this phenotype was reproduced upon mice with other highly-virulent SARS-CoVs displaying IC activity based on alternative E protein sequence epithelia integrity was clearly preserved in the lungs of animals infected with the virus missing E protein IC activity. differences in viral tropism within lung cells, without affecting viral production, can induce different pathologies. cytokine burst initiated by viral infection is IL-1. IL-1 is implicated in the development of diverse pathologies, including obesity, atherosclerosis, diabetes and several pulmonary illnesses. ARDS progression involves the production of TNF, another early response cytokine, and IL-6, which exerts its function in a more sustained manner accumulating during the disease. mutations at SARS-CoV S gene conferred increased virulence without affecting growth within mice, even at early times. this increased pathogenesis was mainly dependent on an exacerbated host response to the viral infection. this increased pathogenesis was mainly dependent on an exacerbated host response to the viral infection. infected mice were housed in a ventilated rack (allentown, NJ) cells The African green monkey kidney-derived vero E6 cells were provided by Eric Snijder. the mouse delayed brain tumor cells stably expressing the murine receptor for SARS-CoV (DBT-mACE2) were generated as previously described. mutant rSARS-CoVs-MA15 was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome. the mutations inhibited or restored E protein IC activity. the fragments contained different point mutations within the E gene. cell supernatants were harvested, passaged once on fresh cells and recovered viruses were cloned by three rounds of plaque purification. cells were grown to confluency on 12.5 cm2 flasks and infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. RGIC53 (dilution 1200, Alexis Biochemicals) and a rabbit pAb specific for E protein [15] were washed four times with PBS between primary and secondary antibody incubations. coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen) and examined on a leica SP5 confocal microscope. rSARS-CoV wt, rSARS-CoV-E-N15A and rSARS-CoV-E-V25F were infected at an MOI of 0.5 with the viruses rSARS-CoV wt, rSARS-CoV-E-N15A and rSARS-CoV-E-V25F. at 24 hpi, supernatants were collected and passaged on fresh monolayers mice were inoculated with 100000 PFU of the virus rSARS-CoV wt, rSARS-CoV-E-N15A, rSARS-CoV-E-N15A, rSARS-CoV-E-N15A, rSARS-CoV-E-V25F, rSARS-CoV-E-N15D, rSARS-CoV-E-V25F L27S, five micron sections of zinc formalin fixed lungs were deparaffined at 60\u00b0C and rehydrated by successive incubations in 100% xylol, 100% ethanol and 96% ethanol. antigen unmask was performed by boiling the samples in citrate buffer (8.2 mM sodium citrate; 1.8 mM citric acid, pH 6.5) for 5 min at 110\u00b0C in a decloaking chamber. RT-qPCR analysis RNA extracted from lungs of infected mice was prepared.
