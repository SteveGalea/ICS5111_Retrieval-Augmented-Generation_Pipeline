{"summary": "one-third of the annual deaths occurring in the world are thought to be due to infectious diseases. pneumonia kills more children worldwide than any other disease, even more than acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria and measles combined [9,10,11] studies on influenza pandemics over the last 100 years have strengthened the association of bacterial super-infections and influenza infections. pertussis and measles still represent serious medical issues with lower respiratory tract involvement in several countries. influenza B viruses evolve mainly through genetic reassortment between strains of different lineages. this allows for the escape from host immunity and the preservation of the ability to cause disease. influenza C virus is less common than other types of influenza viruses and usually causes mild disease in children. the ACIP highlights the importance of administering 1 dose of any influenza vaccine annually to prevent influenza disease and complications. 2 doses separated by at least 4 weeks for children 6 months\u20138 years who did not receive at least 2 doses of influenza vaccine before 1 July 2018. the need to protect neonates and infants in the first 6 months of life from influenza is so important that many health authorities have recommended influenza vaccinations of pregnant women [49,50,51]. neumococcal polysaccharide Vaccine (PPV) was registered in the united states. it contained purified polysaccharides of 14 pneumococcal serotypes. the first polysaccharide capsular antigen conjugated to a protein was PCV7. a great number of studies have shown that both vaccines are immunogenic, safe, well tolerated and very effective because their contribution reduces the risk of pneumococcal diseases in vaccinated children. the classic manifestation of the disease can be divided into three phases: (1) nonspecific symptoms, such as coryza, fever, and occasional cough. studies in immunized children have reported that antibody responses and protective immunity wane 3\u20135 years after immunization with acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines. the majority of health authorities recommend the administration of 2\u20133 aP vaccine doses in the first year of life with the administration of booster doses at pre-school age. measles Vaccination Measles is an acute viral illness caused by a single-stranded RNA enveloped virus in the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus. it is characterized by a prodrome of fever and malaise, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, followed by a maculopapular rash. it is still responsible for more than 100,000 deaths every year. despite a consensus on the need for an RSV vaccine, there is no licensed product available yet. the ideal vaccine should produce long-lasting immunity characterized by a robust Th1-mediated response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. the ideal vaccine should protect against both RSV-A and RSV-B, in presence of maternal antibodies as well. influenza is the cause of approximately 374,000 hospitalizations of children 1 year of age and 870,000 hospitalizations of children 5 years of age annually. children are the most important cause of the spread of the infection in communities because they shed the virus in greater amounts and for longer periods of time than adults. influenza C virus can circulate infecting humans, dogs, and pigs, sometimes causing severe illness and local epidemics. in the past, recommended vaccines included only one influenza B lineage. currently, quadrivalent vaccines containing both influenza B lineages represent the best influenza prevention strategy [40,41,42] a reduction in influenza cases can have an impact on the abuse of antibiotics prescribed to a large number of paediatric patients with uncomplicated influenza. a reduction in influenza cases can have an impact on the abuse of antibiotics that are irrationally prescribed to a large number of paediatric patients with uncomplicated influenza. the first PCV, the heptavalent preparation (PCV7), quickly exhibited limitations. it was protected against 7 pneumococcal serotypes, significantly fewer than the total number of infective pneumococcal serotypes that circulate. a few vaccines effective against an increased number of pneumococcal serotypes were developed. pertussis Vaccination Bordetella pertussis is a Gram-negative coccobacillus. it causes whooping cough and persistent cough, especially in neonates, school-aged children and adolescents. complications, such as pneumonia, are frequent and are responsible for over 90% of the deaths attributable to the disease in children younger than one year of age. study showed 90% effectiveness of pertussis vaccination of mothers in first 6 months of life. vaccine administration in pregnancy is safe for both mother and foetus. pertussis toxin, particularly if genetically detoxified, represents the main antigen that ensures protection against disease. in the united states, 880 cases were reported from the beginning of 2019 through May [86], with 1,548 cases reported by 22 countries. in the u.s., twenty-seven countries reported measles data for March 2019, with 1,548 cases reported by 22 countries. the ideal vaccine should produce long-lasting immunity characterized by a robust Th1-mediated response and high titers of neutralizing antibodies. the ideal vaccine should protect against both RSV-A and RSV-B. pathogen."}
