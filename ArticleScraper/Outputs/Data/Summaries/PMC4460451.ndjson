{"summary": "RVFV infection inhibits protein production during infection of mammalian cells. previous reports have demonstrated that the translation of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs is inhibited in response to a variety of stresses including attenuation of mTOR signaling (25), thus inhibiting global translation. fold change in 5\u2032-TOP mRNA signal is indicated compared with uninfected U2OS cells as normalized to 28S rRNA with mean SD (n = 3; *P 0.05). RT-qPCR found no change in 5\u2032-TOP mRNA levels in U2OS cells treated with UV-killed RVFV. 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs have Decreased Stability During RVFV Infection. we examined the decay rate of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs or mRNAs lacking a 5\u2032-TOP during RVFV infection. ribosomal protein mRNAs are stable, with half-lives in the range of 12 h in mammals. U2OS cells were transfected with reporter constructs expressing either the WT TOP-containing EEF2 5\u2032-UTR or a TOP-mutant UTR. they then untreated or infected with RVFV (MOI, 5) twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with RVFV. luciferase activity from the WT 5\u2032-TOP reporter was decreased upon infection similar to the endogenous 5\u2032-TOPs. the MUT reporter was less sensitive to infection induced changes in translation, translating significantly more efficiently than the WT 5\u2032-TOP during infection. we hypothesized that the loss of the core translation machinery due to the decay of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs should ultimately impact translation globally. mTOR pathway was attenuated during RVFV infection in MEFs. phosphorylation status of Akt was reduced 18 hpi, whereas total levels were unaffected. this timing coincident with a significant decrease in 5\u2032-TOP mRNA and protein production. 4EBP1/2 regulates 5\u2032-TOP mRNA translation through phosphorylation and inactivation of 4EBP1/2 (19, 23\u201325, 30, 31) mTOR regulates 5\u2032-TOP mRNA translation through phosphorylation and inactivation of 4EBP1/2. we hypothesized that RVFV-induced decay of 5\u2032-TOP\u2013containing mRNAs is dependent upon initial translational shutdown of these mRNAs via 4EBP1/2. mTOR inhibition leads to translational arrest of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs. treatment with the inhibitor Torin 1 (up to 24 h) had no impact on the levels of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs in MEFs. mTOR inhibition by RVFV leads to 4EBP1/2 activation. we examined the architecture of RNA granules during RVFV infection by microscopy. we observed a strong induction of stress granules using a panel of stress granule-associated proteins (G3BP, TIAR, and eIF4G) and P bodies using a panel of stress granule-associated proteins (DCP1a, DCP2, and Rck/DDX6). U2OS cells were infected with RVFV (MOI, 1) for 12 h. total protein lysates were collected and analyzed by immunoblot. a representative of three independent experiments is shown. RNA granule aggregation into visible punctae is not necessary for decay functions. increased mRNA decapping leads to the loss of visible P-body granules. however, translation complexes can be stalled in the absence of visible stress granules. TIAR punctae remained 6\u20138 hpi, but there was a significant loss in TIAR punctae. we observed close proximity of those remaining stress granules and P bodies in infected cells at 6 hpi. this suggests that stalled translation complexes are first accumulated in stress granules as previously reported. we examined whether the mRNA decapping enzymes control the levels of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs using the 5\u2032-TOP luciferase reporters. ectopic expression of either NUDT16 or DCP2 decreased levels of luciferase from 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs. both decappers are limiting and can decay these substrates. luciferase expression was measured by luminescence, with mean SD shown. U2OS cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs. luciferase expression was measured by luminescence, with mean SD shown. 119 snatched sequences aligned with the human genome at 5\u2032-UTRs. the mean length of endogenously cap-snatched sequences was 13.2 nt (SD, 1.7) this is consistent with previous reports that placed bunyaviral cap-snatching products between 10 and 18 nt (46) we found many cap-snatched sequences were from canonical examples of 5\u2032-TOP motifs. the targeting of genes with this motif explains bias toward pyrimidines at the 5\u2032 end of snatched mRNAs. decapping enzymes may selectively impact the ability of RVFV to snatch 5\u2032-TOP targets. RVFV mRNA snatching of these 5\u2032-TOP caps is limited by decapping. the mechanism is unknown as RVFV inhibits the two canonical antiviral pathways that block translation in response to viral infection, PKR and IFN (9, 10) RVFV infection leads to decreased 5\u2032-TOP mRNA and ribosomal proteins. U2OS cells were infected with RVFV (MOI, 2) for 24 h. rRNA was collected and analyzed by immunoblot. 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs have Decreased Stability During RVFV infection. mRNAs lacking a 5\u2032-TOP during RVFV infection have decreased stability. mRNAs are stable, with half-lives in the range of 12 h. RVFV induces 5\u2032-TOP mRNA decay, resulting in decreased 5\u2032-TOP mRNA and protein levels during infection. U2OS cells were infected with RVFV (MOI, 1) for 17 h, and then treated with ActD (5 g/mL) luciferase activity from the WT 5\u2032-TOP reporter was decreased upon infection similar to the endogenous 5\u2032-TOPs. luciferase activity from the WT 5\u2032-TOP reporter was decreased upon infection similar to the endogenous 5\u2032-TOPs. the control of mTOR via the 4EBP1/2 axis (23) is inhibited by the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor Torin 1, which is dependent on the 5\u2032-TOP mRNA cis element (23). we recently showed that RVFV infection attenuates Akt signaling (29) during RVFV infection. mTOR regulates 5\u2032-TOP mRNA translation through phosphorylation and inactivation of 4EBP1/2. mTOR regulates 5\u2032-TOP mRNA translation through phosphorylation. mTOR regulates 5\u2032-TOP mRNA translation through phosphorylation and inactivation of 4EBP1/2. 4EBP1/2 controls both 5\u2032-TOP translation and RVFV infection. treatment with the inhibitor Torin 1 (up to 24 h) had no impact on the levels of 5\u2032-TOP\u2013containing ribosomal protein mRNAs. mRNA decay machinery where many mRNAs are decapped and degraded. accumulation of mRNAs leads to the formation of visible punctae. increased RNA decay leads to their disaggregation without loss of activity. U2OS cells were mock treated or infected with RVFV (MOI, 10) for 12 h. then treated with vehicle or 0.5 mM arsenic for 30 min and analyzed by microscopy for the indicated RNA granule-resident proteins. RNA granules were unable to form in response to either stimuli in infected cells. the dispersal could be due to a loss of RNA granule-resident proteins required for assembly (38) or due to a loss in resident mRNAs necessary for nucleation. the accumulation of stress granules was impacted before P bodies, as early as 6 hpi. this suggests that stalled translation complexes are first accumulated in stress granules as previously reported. this suggests that RNA granule dispersal was dependent on viral replication. mRNA decapping enzymes DCP2 or NUDT16 control the levels of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs using the 5\u2032-TOP luciferase reporters. ectopic expression of either NUDT16 or NUDT16 decreased luciferase levels from 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs. 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs targeted for decay are substrates for competing cap-snatching and RNA decay machinery. U2OS cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs along with reporter constructs expressing either the WT-TOP or a TOP-mutant UTR. RVFV Cap-Snatches from 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs. data suggest bunyaviruses cap-snatch 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs targeted for degradation in infected human cells. mRNAs containing a series of five pyrimidines beginning within four bases of the 5\u2032 end encode 5\u2032-TOP or 5\u2032-TOP\u2013like motifs. previous reports have estimated that, in mice, 16% of mRNAs in the genome encode 5\u2032-TOP or 5\u2032-TOP\u2013like motifs. RNA was examined by RT-qPCR using a primer strategy to amplify specific host mRNAs that are cap-snatched. a forward primer containing a linker followed by 10\u201318 bp of the extreme 5\u2032 end of the indicated 5\u2032-TOP\u2013containing endogenous mRNA was used with a reverse primer specific for RVFV N RNA. we suggest that the decay of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs leads to decreased ribosomal protein levels. this leads to decreased protein levels of other 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs. this leads to decreased levels of global translation (Fig. 2E) inhibition of mTOR is not sufficient to induce decay. 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs are transiently sequestered into stress granules. regenerating core translation mRNAs would be costly in situations of transient stress. the decapping machinery would result in a loss of 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs. this would lead to decreased levels of the 5\u2032-TOP mRNAs encoding the translational machinery. this would ultimately inhibit global translation as ribosomal proteins and other translation factors become depleted. cellular mRNA decay is induced by -herpesviruses and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. the decay of cellular mRNAs is thought to promote viral replication. this alleviates competition between cellular mRNAs and viral mRNAs for the cellular translation machinery. this function of the Sin Nombre nucleocapsid protein evolved as a means to circumvent the inhibitory action of 4EBP1/2. if RVFV snatches coregulated mRNAs in both insect and human hosts, the cohort of genes are distinct. this expands our knowledge of RNA regulation and coordinate regulation of RNA stability. mTOR inhibitors are FDA approved and in use, especially for cancer treatments. rapamycin is the classical inhibitor, but does not block all mTOR functions. ATP-competitive inhibitors, including Torin 1, have been shown to inhibit all mTORC1 functions. anti-Rck/DDX6 (MBL), anti-RPS3A (Abcam; ab96524), anti-RPS8 (Abcam; ab13803), anti-DCP1a (Abcam; ab47811), anti-TIAR (BD Biosciences; BD610352), anti-eIF4G (Santa Cruz; sc-11373), and anti-G3BP (BD Biosciences; BDB611126).
