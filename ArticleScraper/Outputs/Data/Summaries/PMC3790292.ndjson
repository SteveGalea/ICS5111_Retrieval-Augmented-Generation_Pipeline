lower in the knock-down treatment than in the control (supplemental Table S1). anti-BAG3 and Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies can recognize proteins other than BAG3 on the human proteome microarray. anti-BAG3 and Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies can potentially recognize proteins other than BAG3. a substantial fraction of the proteins were shared between the two datasets. some of the known BAG3 interacting proteins, such as Hsp70 (5), sequestosome 1 (9), CCT (44) and HspB6 (45) were recovered in our datasets. transcription factors and receptors are generally expressed at low levels (46), making them hard to identify with QUICK. however, each protein is overexpressed in yeast and individually purified. proteins that function in organized assemblies, such as chaperones, would be preferentially included in the QUICK dataset. 47 proteins were annotated in the \u201ccatabolic processes\u201d term (GO term: 9057, p = 8.33 1012). colored nodes are those that are significantly

database on the BAG3 interactome. several complexes and cellular functions formed prominent, highly connected clusters. for example, many proteasome subunits are connected in a dense protein\u2013protein interaction network that forms the densest cluster (Cluster 1). the network contains 283 nodes and 2,863 edges. 14-3\u20133 belongs to the 14-3\u20133 protein family, which mediates signal transduction by binding to phosphoserine-containing proteins (49). the yeast Apg3 homolog is a protein-conjugating enzyme essential for autophagy (50) no BAG3-interacting bands were

in a significant decrease in 20S proteasome activity. knockdown of BAG3 resulted in a significant decrease in chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome. caspase-like and trypsin-like activities of the 26S proteasome were slightly, but not significantly, less in BAG3 silenced HeLa cells. chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome was significantly lower than that in cells transfected with control siRNA (56 4.5%). knockdown of BAG3 resulted in a marked decrease in proteasome activity. western blotting was carried out with anti-ubiquitin antibody. the 20S proteasome activity of MG-132 treated cells (77% 7.1%) was significantly higher (p 0.01) than that of MG-132-treated cells transfected with a control vector (62% 5.4%) chymotrypsin-like activity of MG-132-treated cells was significantly higher (p 0.05) than that of MG-132-treated cells transfected with a control vector (62% 5.4%) QUICK Identification of BAG3 Interacting Proteins We identified BAG3 interacting proteins first using the QUICK approach. levels of BAG3 proteins were markedly reduced in siBAG3-treated HeLa cells realative to HeLa cells transfected with negative control siRNA (siNC) levels of BAG3 were markedly reduced in siBAG3-treated HeLa cells realative to HeLa cells transfected with negative control siRNA (siNC) 174 proteins were identified as potential BAG3 interaction partners. a total of 174 proteins had p values greater than 0.05. a human proteome microarray was used to identify putative BAG3 interacting proteins. 289 proteins identified as potential BAG3 interacting proteins. a statistical model was developed for estimating false positive rates. the discordant rate of two replicated microarrays could be controlled under 10%. known BAG3 interacting proteins, such as Hsp70 (5), sequestosome 1 (9), CCT (44), and HspB6 (45), were recovered in our datasets. each dataset contained a distinct group of proteins, and functional classification of these proteins allowed characterization of the different properties of the two datasets. in the proteome microarray dataset, adaptor and cytoskeletal proteins were the most overrepresented categories. the QUICK and proteome microarray methods combined the proteins identified by each method. a nonredundant list of 382 human proteins was used in all subsequent analyses. the interactome can be classified into 17 groups according to biological processes. d nodes are those that are significantly overrepresented in the GO biological processes. four major functional groups were strongly enriched in the BAG3 interactome. in the GO molecular function category, we found that the most overrepresented functions were involved in regulating enzyme activity.

BAG3 forms a complex with Hsp90AA1, HspA1A, HSF1 and ST13 (Cluster 4) it is tempting to speculate that the physiological interaction between these two complexes might contribute to the cooperation and/or coordination of their functions in the control of numerous intracellular signaling and regulatory pathways. HSF1 is a DNA-binding protein that specifically binds heat shock promoter elements and activates transcription. no BAG3-interacting bands were observed in the negative control (IgG) in vitro assay system showed that 14-3\u20133, ATG3, PSMB1, MAPK7, HSF1 and Hsp70 interact with BAG3 immobilized on the SPR surface. as expected, we did not observe any appreciable interaction between BAG3 and 14-3\u20133, ATG3, PSMB1, MAPK7, HSF1 and Hsp70. we knocked down BAG3 using RNAi and examined its potential impact in HeLa cells. knockdown of BAG3 alone did not affect apoptosis in HeLa cells. knockdown of BAG3 resulted in a significant decrease in proteasome activity. in cells transfected with BAG3 siRNA, proteasome activity of MG-132-treated cells was significantly lower than that in cells transfected with control siRNA. in cells transfected with BAG3 siRNA, proteasome activity of MG-132-treated cells was significantly lower than that in cells transfected with control siRNA. knockdown of BAG3 resulted in a significant (p 0.05) decrease in the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome in HeLa cells with or without MG-132 treatment. the effects of BAG3 on the specific protease activities of the 20 and 26S proteasomes were further determined using additional A549 cells. chymotryptic, tryptic, and caspase-like activities of the (E) 26S or (F) proteasome in HeLa cells were measured using fluorogenic substrates. experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. like activity of MG-132-treated cells (68% 4.2% for 26S and 71% 6.1% for 20S) was significantly higher (p 0.05) than that of MG-132-treated cells transfected with a control vector (54% 5.4% for 26S and 58% 4.5% for 20S) similar effects of BAG3 overexpression on proteasome activity were also observed in A549 cells. QUICK Identification of BAG3 Interacting Proteins We identified 174 proteins as potential BAG3 interaction partners. a total of 174 proteins had p values greater than 0.05, suggesting that under our experimental conditions, they are likely to interact nonspecifically with BAG3. new tab Identification of BAG3 interacting proteins with QUICK. expression of BAG isoforms in BAG3 knockdown HeLa cells (siBAG3) and negative control cells (siNC) depletion of BAG3 showed no obvious effect on expression of other BAG isoforms. the discordant rate of this study was 10%)2/(1 2*10% + (10%)2) = 1.23%. many stronger signals can be observed from the microarray with BAG3 than from the microarray without BAG3. proteome microarray and proteome microarray datasets were most overrepresented. adaptor and cytoskeletal proteins were the two most overrepresented categories. transcription factors and receptors were the most underrepresented. the interactome can be classified into 17 groups according to biological processes and 23 groups according to molecular functions. the largest group within the BAG3 interactome is the transferase family (12%). other significant functional categories include nucleic acid binding (10%), transcription factors (8%), proteases (7%), and chaperones (6%). the top five GO biological process, molecular function, and cellular component terms enriched in the BAG3 interactome are listed. the top five GO biological process, molecular function, and cellular component terms enriched in the BAG3 interactome are listed. ubiquitin-protein ligase activity 24 7.16 1.78E-21 Molecular function GO:0004298 Threonine-type endopeptidase activity 9 2.69 2.17E-09 GO:0004364 Glutathione transferase activity 7 2.09 1.74E-06 GO:0016765 Transferase activity, transferring alkyl or aryl groups 8 2.39 4.64E-05 GO:0008092 Cytoskeletal protein binding 25 bag3 has a modular structure that contains many domains to mediate potential interactions with chaperones and/or other proteins. it has been reported that the PXXP region of BAG3 can bind to Src homology 3 (SH3)-containing proteins (6). the proteins may use the SH3 domain to interact with the PXXP region of BAG3. 86 1.31E-02 PF00012 Hsp70 protein 3 0.86 1.62E-02 PF00004 AAA 5 1.43 1.65E-02 PF00158 Sigma54-activat 3 0.86 1.95E-02 PF00036 EF hand 5 1.43 2.41E-02 PF10585 Ubiquitin-activating enzyme active site 2 0.57 3.96E-02 PF10584 Proteasome subunit A N-terminal signature 2 0.57 3. pathway analysis of the BAG3 interactome implied direct involvement of the BAG3 interactome in complex physiological and pathological systems. 283 (74%) of the identified BAG3 interacting proteins mapped to the BAG3 interaction network either directly or indirectly. the network contains 283 nodes and 2,863 edges. B\u2013E, the four top-ranked and tightly connected network clusters obtained with MCODE are color-coded. no detectable signals were observed in IgG negative controls. reciprocal immunoprecipitation\u2014Western blot analysis confirmed their specific interactions in cells. the affinity constants (KD) for the interaction between immobilized BAG3 and 14-3\u20133, ATG3, PSMB1, MAPK7, HSF1 and Hsp70 as 51, 170, 1,200, 1,100, 34, and 17 nm respectively. the affinity constants (KD) for the interaction between immobilized BAG3 and 14-3\u20133, ATG3, ATG3, PSMB1, MAPK7, HSF1 and Hsp70 were not determined because of western blotting using anti-BAG3 antibodies in RNAi-treated cells confirmed a significant decrease in the protein level of BAG3 relative to the negative control. knockdown of BAG3 alone did not affect apoptosis in HeLa cells. the 20 and 26S proteasomes have at least three distinct types of proteolytic activities, including chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and caspase-like activities. knockdown of BAG3 resulted in a significant decrease in chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome. knockdown of BAG3 in HeLa cells confirmed by Western blotting. effect of knockdown of BAG3 on proteasome activity and apoptosis in cells. BAG3 was transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells, as confirmed by Western blotting. overexpression of BAG3 reduced sensitivity in HeLa cells relative to cells transfected with a control vector. QUICK Identification of BAG3 Interacting Proteins We identified BAG3 interacting proteins first using the QUICK approach, a SILAC-based quantitative strategy to capture endogenous protein\u2013protein interactions. levels of BAG3 proteins were markedly reduced in siBAG3-treated HeLa cells realative to HeLa cells transfected with negative control siRNA (siNC) level of BAG3 was 4.89-fold lower in the knock-down treatment than in the control (supplemental Table S1). a protein microarray composed of 17,000 individually purified human proteins was incubated with affinity-purified human BAG3 protein. to detect binding events, we applied a BAG3-specific monoclonal antibody to the microarray and followed with incubation with a Cy5-labeled secondary antibody. a control binding experiment was carried out in the absence of BAG3 on the human proteome microarray. many stronger signals can be observed from the microarray with and without BAG3 than from the microarray without BAG3. a substantial fraction of the proteins were shared between the two datasets. some of the known BAG3 interacting proteins, such as Hsp70 (5), sequestosome 1 (9), CCT (44), and HspB6 (45) were recovered in our datasets. array dataset were much less underrepresented than in QUICK (Fig. 3B) transcription factors and receptors are generally expressed at low levels (46), making them hard to identify with QUICK because the affinity purification step will most likely result in a loss of these proteins. a functional class performed a GO analysis to gain insights into the functional roles of the BAG3 interactome. we identified enriched terms in the GO biological process, molecular function, and cellular component analysis. ome proteins identified were localized in non-membrane-bounded organelles (p = 8.83 104), the cytosol (p = 6.23 1015), and the cytoskeleton (p = 2.99 104). GO terms enriched in the BAG3 interactome are listed. 93.4% of the BAG3 interacting proteins contain at least one Pfam-annotated domain. those domains that are significantly enriched in the BAG3 interactome are listed in Table II.
