{"summary": "eGFP-labeled galectins (Gal) detects both subtle and severe endosomal damage in cells treated with a CPMP or CPP. the other uses a fluorescently tagged version of the nonalysine (Lys9) peptide. CPMPs and CPPs do not induce Gal recruitment at submicromolar concentrations (20\u201326) cytosolic -galactosides recruit cytosolic Gal proteins (28, 29) that share a conserved -galactoside binding site. previous work has shown that endosomal damage can be detected by monitoring the translocation of eGFP fusions of Gal3 or Gal8. human osteosarcoma (Saos-2) cells transiently expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 were first treated for 1 h with two known endosomolytic agents at concentrations reported to induce endosomal rupture. the two endosomolytic agents used as positive controls were Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (31, 32) and l-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester 3 and Gal8 recruitment to endolysosomal membranes in multiple cell lines (20, 22, 30, 31) led to significant punctate staining (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B) the average ERC values calculated when Saos-2 cells were treated with RNAiMAX were 62 8 (Gal-3) and 42 5 (Gal-8), values that represent increases of 30- and 14-fold over untreated cells. the average ERC values calculated when Saos-2 cells were treated with 600 nM CPMPs or CPPs 1R\u20135R were all less than 15. this is not significantly above the ERC of untreated Saos-2 cells. CPMPs and CPPs do not induce endosomal damage at a treatment concentration of 600 nM. titration experiments with LLOMe yielded no detectable endosomal leakage of Lys9R. similar titration experiments with LLOMe yielded no detectable endosomal leakage of Lys9R. LLOMe selectively induces lysosomal permeabilization. no significant leakage of Lys9R into the cytosol or nucleus was observed at CPMP or CPP concentrations below 2 M. at 2.4 M, CPMPs 1UL and 2UL induced low levels of Lys9R endosomal leakage. the remaining polypeptides 3UL\u20135UL did not induce significant Lys9R leakage at any concentration tested in this assay. to characterize this mechanism, we designed a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify candidate genes whose knockdown increase or decrease the ability of CPMP 1 to reach the cytosol. we made use of a previously reported glucocorticoid-induced eGFP translocation (GIGT) assay (11, 13, 39) that couples the cytosolic delivery of a molecule tagged with dexamethasone (GR*) to the nuclear translocation of a we then performed a duplicate pilot screen with 320 randomly chosen siRNAs from the human genome library. we assessed assay performance in Saos-2(GIGT) cells treated with the CPMP 1Dex at 1-M concentration, which yielded the highest signal-to-background (S/B) ratio. the observed coefficient of variation, a measure of data variability, was also excellent. the raw TR of each experimental well was converted to a normalized percent effect value. the average TR of Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with a nontargeting siRNA was defined as 0% effect. that of Saos-2(GIGT) cells without 1Dex transfected with nontargeting siRNA was defined as 100% effect. genes implicated in endocytosis (45) were enriched among the set of 428 initial hits (102 genes, 24% of the total) genes implicated in endocytic trafficking (102 genes) were identified using a previously reported system-level survey of endocytosis (45) RNAs could be associated with the GR signaling pathway and affect the cytosolic to nuclear distribution of GR*-eGFP even in the absence of Dex or 1Dex. we discarded a gene if three of the four gene-specific siRNAs significantly increased the TR compared with that measured in Saos-2(GIGT) cells. this process eliminated 61 genes from consideration, leaving 70 genes for subsequent validation. GIGT/Opera combination assay is useful for analyzing effect on siRNA knockdowns on cytosolic access in a high-throughput mode. flow cytometry (FC) and FCS (12) effectively discriminate knockdowns that alter overall CPMP/CPP uptake. efficiency of each siRNA pool was >70% in Saos-2 cells. neither RNAiMAX nor knockdown of the housekeeping gene GAPD affected overall CPMP uptake by Saos-2 cells. Knockdown of only 4 of the 28 candidate genes significantly decreased the overall uptake of 2R. genes whose knockdown strongly reduced the delivery of 2R include multiple cellular activities related to membrane homeostasis. the remaining eight genes consisted of DOCK4 and seven olfactory receptors (ORs: OR4C6, OR4F15, OR51E1, OR51Q1, OR52N1, OR5M8, OR8D1) Knockdown of genes shown in red strongly inhibits (>70%) intracellular (cytosolic and nuclear) access of 2R. each data point (n) represents a 50-s FCS measurement recorded in a single cell. a plot showing the percent effect of each statistically significant knockdown on the cytosolic localization of 2R or 3R showed moderate correlation. Knockdown of five genes inhibited the appearance of both 2R and 3R in the cytosol (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A, blue open circles) the effects of gene knockdowns on cytosolic localization of CPMP 2R and peptide 3R suggest that these genes play common roles in the intracellular trafficking of these two molecular families. the five genes that most strongly regulate cytosolic delivery of both 2R or 3R can be divided into four categories. a fully assembled HOPS complex is required to initiate fusion of Rab7+ maturing and LEs into LYs. depletion of any subunit delays LY maturation and inhibits cargo degradation. HOPS is closely related to a structurally similar complex called CORVET (SI Appendix, Fig. S7C) in VPS41-depleted cells treated with hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3R, we also observed a significant decrease in overall uptake (27%) and in the average intracellular delivery (55%) by FCS. no significant decreases in overall uptake or cytosolic localization were observed upon depletion of the CORVET-specific subunits TGFBRAP1 and VPS8. for each FC replicate, the median fluorescence intensity at 585 nm was measured for at least 10,000 Saos-2 cells. each data point (n) denotes one 50-s FCS measurement recorded in the nucleus or cytosol of a single Saos-2 cell with (B\u2013D) or without (E and F) autocorrelation. Knockdown of TGFBRAP1 or VPS8 led to either no change (5R) or a 30% increase (4R) in overall uptake (as determined by FCS without autocorrelation) knockdown of VPS8 either stimulated (4R) or had no effect (5R) on the average cytosolic fluorescence intensity as determined by FCS without autocorrelation. cytosolic delivery of CPMP/CPPs 1\u20135 demands the presence of a fully assembled HOPS complex. a fluorescence colocalization protocol quantifies HOPS-dependent delivery of dextran to lysosomal compartments. in untreated and nontargeting siRNA-treated cells, the colocalization of dextran and Magic Red was calculated using ImageJ (33). a Fluor 488-dextran and Magic Red were characterized by Manders coefficients of 0.30 0.030 and 0.23 0.020. these values represent the fraction of dextran-containing vesicles that also contain cathepsin B. depletion of HOPS-specific subunits VPS39 and VPS41 significantly reduced the colocalization of the HOPS complex. HOPS is required for the fusion of Rab7+ endosomes, a process initiated by HOPS-mediated membrane tethering and completed by the mechanical action of SNARE proteins. confocal microscopy studies were performed with Saos-2 cells expressing either Rab5-GFP, a marker of EEs and MEs, or Lamp1-GFP, a marker for LEs and LYs. yM201636 inhibits phosphoinositide kinase PIK-fyve that enlarges Rab7+ endolysosomes. yM201636 preincubation had only a modest effect on the extent of colocalization of 2R with each GFP marker. CPMP 2 localizes to the lumen of LEs and LYs. HOPS is required to guide CPMP 2 to Lamp1+ endosomes. genetic depletion of HOPS subunits reduces HOPS-mediated fusion of Rab7+ endosomes and impairs the formation of Lamp1+ LEs and LYs. colocalization with Rab7-GFP (r = 0.25 0.016) and good colocalization with Lamp1-GFP (r = 0.57 0.027) are virtually identical to those observed using 2R. total uptake of 2SiR (as determined using FC) was similar whether cells expressed a GFP-tagged protein or not. HOPS knockdown inhibits trafficking of CPMP 2 to Lamp1+ LEs and LYs. CPMP 2 was transfected with pooled siRNAs against VPS39 or a nontargeting (NT) control siRNA (RISC-free) for 72 h. we used a known ILV marker, the lipid N-Rh-PE, a lissamine rhodamine B-tagged version of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. N-Rh-PE is internalized via the endocytic pathway into ILVs (71\u201373) before it is eventually secreted in exosomes (70, 72, 74) we also performed a four-color confocal microscopy experiment to visualize Saos-2 cells expressing Rab5-, Rab7-, or Lamp1-GFP. as expected, we observed virtually no colocalization of 2SiR with Rab5-GFP (r = 0.071 0.014) but good colocalization with Rab7- and Lamp1-GFP (r = 0.41 0.037) CPMP 2 colocalizes with ILVs found within Rab7+ and Lamp1+ LEs. the effects of CPMPs or more traditional CPPs on endosomal integrity in cultured cells have not been thoroughly evaluated. CPMPs and CPPs evaluated herein include aPP5.3 (1) (model structure from PDB ID code 1PPT); ZF5.3 (2) (model structure from PDB ID code 2EOZ); SAH-p53-8 (3) (model structure from PDB ID code 3V3B); and the cyclic peptide CPP12 (5). CPMPs and CPPs do not induce Gal recruitment at submicromolar concentrations. human osteosarcoma (Saos-2) cells transiently expressing eGFP-hGal3 or eGFP-hGal8 were first treated for 1 h with two known endosomolytic agents at concentrations reported to induce endosomal rupture. the two endosomolytic agents used as positive controls were Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (31, 32) and l-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester treatment of Saos-2 cells with either RNAiMAX or LLOMe led to significant punctate staining (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B) the average ERC values calculated when Saos-2 cells were treated with RNAiMAX were 62 8 (Gal-3) and 42 5 (Gal-8), values that represent increases of 30- and 14-fold over untreated cells. CPMPs and CPPs do not induce endosomal damage at a treatment concentration of 600 nM. CPMPs and CPPs do not induce endosomal damage at a treatment concentration of 600 nM. CPMPs and CPPs do not induce endosomal leakage at concentrations below 2 M. titration experiments with LLOMe yielded no detectable endosomal leakage of Lys9R. similar titration experiments with LLOMe yielded no detectable endosomal leakage of Lys9R, even at the highest tested LLOMe concentration (1 mM) no significant leakage of Lys9R into the cytosol or nucleus was observed at CPMP or CPP concentrations below 2 M. at 2.4 M, CPMPs 1UL and 2UL induced low levels of Lys9R leakage. above 2 M, 1UL and 2UL induce low levels of Lys9R leakage. to characterize this mechanism, we designed a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify candidate genes whose knockdown increase or decrease the ability of CPMP 1 to reach the cytosol. we made use of a previously reported glucocorticoid-induced eGFP translocation (GIGT) assay (11, 13, 39) that couples the cytosolic delivery of a molecule tagged with dexamethasone (Dex) to the nuclear translocation of a we then performed a duplicate pilot screen with 320 randomly chosen siRNAs from the human genome library. we assessed assay performance in Saos-2(GIGT) cells treated with the CPMP 1Dex at 1-M concentration. this yielded the highest signal-to-background (S/B) ratio (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C) the raw TR of each experimental well was converted to a normalized percent effect value. the average TR of Saos-2(GIGT) cells transfected with a nontargeting siRNA was defined as 0% effect. that of Saos-2(GIGT) cells without 1Dex transfected with nontargeting siRNA was defined as 100% effect. genes implicated in endocytosis (45) were enriched among the set of 428 initial hits (102 genes, 24% of the total) a protein\u2013protein interaction analysis using the String database (46) revealed many interactions but no singular enriched mechanism or pathway. gene-specific siRNAs target 131 candidate genes in nontreated Saos-2(GIGT) cells. this process eliminated 61 genes from consideration, leaving 70 genes for subsequent validation. this process eliminated 61 genes from consideration, leaving 70 genes for subsequent validation. 28 of the 70 candidate genes passed this filter (Dataset S4) in the presence of either 1Dex or 2Dex compared with that observed in Saos-2 cells transfected with a nontargeting siRNA. GIGT/Opera combination assay is useful for analyzing the effect on siRNA knockdowns on cytosolic access in a high-throughput mode. real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments confirmed that the knockdown efficiency of each siRNA pool was >70% in Saos-2 cells. RNAiMAX nor knockdown of the housekeeping gene GAPD affected overall CPMP uptake by Saos-2 cells. Knockdown of only 4 of the 28 candidate genes significantly decreased the overall uptake of 2R. knockdown of one candidate gene led to a significant (+49%) increase in the delivery of 2R to the nucleus and cytosol. this finding suggests that inhibitors of ARHGAP9 could improve endosomal release. genes whose knockdown strongly reduced the delivery of 2R encompass multiple cellular activities related to membrane homeostasis. FC and FCS data illustrating the effects of gene knockdowns on total cellular fluorescence (A), the cytosolic (B) and nuclear localization of 2R relative to the effects of nontargeting (RISC-free) siRNA (NT siRNA) Knockdown of genes shown in orange moderately inhibit (>70%) intracellular access of 2R. the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAH-p53-8R (3R) achieves average intracellular concentrations that are only 10\u201350% lower than those attained by ZF5.3R (2R), depending on the cell line used (12). a plot showing the percent effect of each statistically significant knockdown on the cytosolic localization of 2R or 3R showed moderate correlation (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.47, P = 0.17) (SI Appendix, Fig. the effects of gene knockdowns on the cytosolic localization of CPMP 2R and peptide 3R are small. the five genes that most strongly regulate cytosolic delivery of both 2R and 3R can be divided into four categories. the goal of the RNAi screen was to identify candidate genes that significantly enhance or inhibit the intracellular localization of multiple CPMPs and CPPs. a fully assembled HOPS complex is required to initiate fusion of Rab7+ maturing and LEs into LYs. depletion of any subunit delays LY maturation and inhibits cargo degradation. HOPS is closely related to a structurally similar complex called CORVET. VPS41-depleted cells treated with hydrocarbon-stapled peptide 3R showed a moderate decrease (14%) in overall uptake and a strong (78%) decrease in the average intracellular concentration of 1R. however, no significant decreases in overall uptake or cytosolic localization were observed upon depletion of the CORVET-specific subunits TGFBRAP1 and VPS8. n refers to the number of biological replicates. for each FC replicate, the median fluorescence intensity at 585 nm was measured for at least 10,000 Saos-2 cells. each data point (n) denotes one 50-s FCS measurement recorded in the nucleus or cytosol of a single Saos-2 cell. knockdown of the CORVET subunits TGFBRAP1 or VPS8 led to either no change (5R) or a 30% increase (4R) in overall uptake (as determined by FCS without autocorrelation) knockdown of the CORVET subunits TGFBRAP1 or VPS8 either stimulated (4R) or had no effect (5R) on the average cytosolic fluorescence intensity. cytosolic delivery of CPMP/CPPs 1\u20135 demands the presence of a fully assembled HOPS complex. cytosolic access demands the activity of the HOPS complex and cytosolic access demands the inhibition of this activity. to discriminate between these two possibilities, we monitored HOPS activity in the presence of CPMPs 1UL\u20135UL. the colocalization of dextran and Magic Red was calculated using ImageJ (33) in untreated and nontargeting siRNA-treated Saos-2 cells, the colocalization of Alexa Fluor 488-dextran and Magic Red was characterized by Manders coefficients. these values represent the fraction of dextran-containing vesicles that also contain cathepsin B and are comparable to those measured previously. the treatment of Saos-2 cells with CPMPs 1\u20135 is dependent on the presence of a functional, active HOPS complex. HOPS is required for the fusion of Rab7+ endosomes, a process initiated by HOPS-mediated membrane tethering. 2R colocalizes moderately with Rab5+ endosomes and strongly with Rab7+ endosomes. yM201636 preincubation had only a modest effect on the extent of colocalization of 2R with each GFP marker. CPMP 2 localizes to the lumen of LEs and LYs. HOPS is required to guide CPMP 2 to Lamp1+ endosomes. genetic depletion of HOPS subunits reduces HOPS-mediated fusion of Rab7+ endosomes and impairs the formation of Lamp1+ LEs and LYs. rhodamine (SiR) dye that emits at 660\u2013670 nm (69) showed virtually no colocalization between 2SiR and Rab5-GFP (r = 0.05 0.01), moderate colocalization with Rab7-GFP (r = 0.25 0.016) and good colocalization with Lamp1-GFP (r = 0.57 0.027) GFP overexpression (65) was observed in cells treated with a nontargeting siRNA or with siRNAs against the HOPS subunit VPS39. knockdown of HOPS but not CORVET inhibits trafficking of 2SiR to Lamp1+ LEs and LYs. enlarged endosomes in Rab7- or Lamp1-GFP\u2013expressing cells showed presence of smaller vesicles within the boundaries of LE membranes. we used a known ILV marker, the lipid N-Rh-PE, a lissamine rhodamine B-tagged version of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (70) PE and 2SiR showed significant colocalization (r = 0.53 0.028) CPMP 2SiR localizes to ILVs and to Rab7+ and Lamp1+ vesicles that contain ILVs. as expected, we observed virtually no colocalization of 2SiR with Rab5-GFP. CPMP 2 colocalizes with ILVs found within Rab7+ and Lamp1+ LEs. the pathway into the cytosol requires uptake into endocytic vesicles. this second step is widely recognized as the bottleneck hindering the efficient delivery of peptidic materials into the cytosol. CPMPs in the endosomal lumen of Rab7+ and Lamp1+ endosomes colocalize with ILVs. depletion of HOPS activity decreases the amount of CPMP that reaches Lamp1+ vesicles. previous work reported that ZF5.3R colocalizes with Rab5-GFP. the HOPS complex has also been implicated in the cytosolic trafficking of numerous bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. CPMPs such as 2 also require HOPS to reach LEs and LYs. there is no evidence that processing by lysosomal proteases is involved. CPMP or CPP escapes after HOPS-dependent fusion is complete. in the third model, the CPMP or CPP escapes after HOPS-dependent fusion is complete. some evidence for CPP\u2013ILV interactions have been reported. 44116.sd03.xlsx (59.6KB, xlsx) Supplementary File pnas.1812044116.sd04.xlsx (54.6KB, xlsx) Supplementary File Download video file (1MB, avi) Supplementary File pnas.1812044116.sd01.xlsx (47.8KB, xlsx)"}
