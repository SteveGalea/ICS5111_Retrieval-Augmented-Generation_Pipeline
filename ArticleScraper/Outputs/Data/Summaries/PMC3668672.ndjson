{"summary": "prokaryotic translation elongation factors were identified as essential cofactors for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the bacteriophage Q more than 40 years ago. the functions of eEF1A as a protein chaperone and an RNA- and actin-binding protein enable its \u201cmoonlighting\u201d roles as a virus replication cofactor. viral pathogens have adapted to use eEFs as cofactors for viral transcription, translation, assembly eEF1A binds to and delivers aminoacylated tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) to the elongating ribosome. an inactive eEF1A-GDP moiety leaves the ribosome and must be recycled to eEF1A-GTP before binding another aa-tRNA. this is the function of the nucleotide exchange factor eEF1B complex, which exchanges GDP for GTP to regenerate active eEF1A is a highly abundant molecule that makes up 3% of the total cellular protein. eEF1A is a highly abundant molecule that makes up 3% of the total cellular protein. eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 share 92% amino acid identity. deletion of eEF1A2 in mice gives rise to postnatal lethality at the time when eEF1A1 is no longer expressed in muscle and neurons (20) eEF1A proteins have molecular masses of around 50 kDa and have three distinct domains. viral RNA genome may be either a double strand or single strand of RNA. positive-sense viral RNA is similar to mRNA and therefore can be translated into protein by the cellular translation apparatus. eEF1A and other subunits of the eEF1 complex play important roles in RNA virus replication. the minus-sense RNA genome (represented by VSV) must be transcribed into mRNAs before translation takes place. the genomic RNA can also be transcribed into a full-length plus-sense RNA that will be the template for nascent minus-sense genomic RNA replication. eEF1A1 was shown to bind aminoacylatable TLSs in the 3\u2032UTRs of different plant RNA viral genomes. these TLSs can be aminoacylated by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and have important roles in virus replication. mutations of the TLS that decrease affinity for eEF1A strongly decrease translation efficiency. eEF1A-GTP can bind to various RNA structures usually located at the 3\u2032UTR of viral genomes. eEF1A can bind to various RNA structures usually located at the 3\u2032UTR of viral genomes. the secondary structure model emphasizes similarities to canonical tRNA. TBSV is a member of the Tombusviridae family. it produces many more plus-strand than minus-strand RNA molecules during virus replication. eEF1A is present within a highly purified TBSV replicase complex interacting with p33. interaction of eEF1A with TBSV genomic RNA was shown to stimulate minus-strand RNA synthesis in an in vitro system. further studies indicate that an additional eEF1 factor, eEF1B (the plant homolog of the metazoan protein eEF1G) can also bind TBSV RNA, possibly by forming protein complexes involving eEF1A and the viral replicase. eEF1A binding to the 3\u2032 SL RNA also increases minus-strand RNA synthesis in transfected cells. the role played by eEF1A in minus-strand synthesis may be conserved in Flavivirus replication. the small, 1,680-nucleotide genome of HDV encodes only two proteins. the right terminal stem-loop domain of the HDV genome is a 199-nucleotide RNA element that contains the proposed initiation site for HDAg mRNA transcription and negative-strand RNA synthesis. eEF1A was also shown to interact with the 5\u2032-terminal 110 nucleotides of the polioviral RNA genome, an RNA segment whose secondary structure resembles a cloverleaf. eEF1A1 Binds to a tRNA-Like Structure at the 3\u2032UTR in the Genomic RNAs of Some Plant Viruses. eEF1A1 was shown to bind aminoacylatable TLSs in the 3\u2032UTRs of different plant RNA viral genomes (reviewed in reference 24) the interaction of eEF1A with aminoacylated viral RNA has been proposed as a mechanism to regulate virus protein translation and genomic RNA replication. mutations of the TLS that decrease the affinity for eEF1A and diminish the RNA aminoacylation efficiency strongly decrease the translation efficiency. nucleotides in the anticodon loop constitute the valine identity elements (green) that direct specific valylation of the 3\u2032 end of the RNA by plant valyl-tRNA synthetase. the highlighted nucleotides GGGCU, termed the replication silencer element, are proposed eEF1A binding sites (33). unlike many plus-strand RNA viruses, TBSV is noted for producing many more plus-strand than minus-strand RNA molecules during virus long RNA \u201cbulge\u201d sequence located within an internal RNA stem-loop (SL3) structure called SL3. the RSE is capable of intrastrand base pairing with the 3\u2032 terminus of the RNA genome. eEF1A is present within a highly purified TBSV replicase complex interacting with p33. eEF1A has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that is about 10.7 kb long. the conserved SL structure at the 3\u2032UTR was shown to bind eEF1A specifically. eEF1A has conserved tyrosine, threonine, and serine residues that are phosphorylated. eEF1A and the WNV 3\u2032 SL facilitate viral minus-strand synthesis (36) eEF1A was shown to bind with similar efficiency to the 3\u2032-terminal SL RNAs of four divergent Flavivirus members. the small, 1,680-nucleotide genome of HDV encodes only two proteins, the large and small hepatitis D antigens. eEF1A was also shown to interact with the 5\u2032-terminal 110 nucleotides of the polioviral RNA genome. this interaction may be necessary for virus replication, as genetic mutations disrupt the RNA cloverleaf structure inhibit 3CDpro RNA binding and virus replication. eEF1A, eEF1A, interact with Viral Polymerase Proteins and support the formation of Virus Replication Complexes (RCs) a requirement for translation elongation factors in virus polymerase activity was first identified for the Q bacteriophage (44). EF-Tu and EF-Ts (the Escherichia coli counterparts of eukaryotic eEF1A and the eEF1B complex) were copur the interaction of eEF1A with viral RdRps has been studied extensively in plant RNA viruses such as TMV. eEF1A homolog interacts with both subunits of the active TMV RdRp, the 126-kDa and 183-kDa proteins, called 126K and 183K, respectively (51). eEF1A was significantly enriched in membrane fractions of plant lysates. it could be copurified with TuMV RdRp by a tandem affinity isolation method. it is possible that association with cellular membranes and binding of eEF1A by viral RdRp are features common to RNA viruses, such as Flavivirus members. eEF1A, didemnin and gamendazole inhibit replicase activity in vitro. eEF1A acted primarily to recruit and stabilize the viral RdRp complex. eEF1A and other subunits of eEF1 have been reported to interact with viral polymerases from animal viruses. eEF1A is a component of the VSV transcriptase complex. minus-strand RNA includes an RNA leader region (blue) followed by the N gene (black) transcription start site. minus-strand RNA is composed of the viral transcriptase complex. eEF1A was found to colocalize with NS3 (a viral protease/helicase) and NS5b (the viral RdRp) proteins in infected cells. eEF1A is important for minus-strand RNA synthesis through interactions with viral RNA and the replication complex proteins, including NS3 and NS5. eEF1A interacts with viral proteins other than RNA polymerases. eEF1A is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Pestivirus. eEF1A-NS5A interaction was observed for NS5As from all BVDV strains that were tested.

HIV-1 Gag is synthesized on cytosolic polysomes. it was speculated that eEF1A may play a role in releasing viral RNA from polysomes, thereby permitting genomic RNA to be packaged into virions. eEF1A interacts with the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 of cutaneous human papillomavirus (HPV) type 38 (69) and with the X protein of hepatitis B virus (70) both HPV and HBV are double-stranded DNA viruses and are from the papillomaviridae and Hepadnaviridae families. -replicase complex, which also includes Hfq and the ribosomal protein S1 (45, 46), was capable of efficient RNA elongation upon removal of EF-T and EF-Ts. structural studies have shown that hydrophobic interactions between the -subunit and EF-Ts are required for the maintenance of the -subunit catalytic core crevasse of Q replicase. eEF1A can bind to the 3\u2032UTR of TMV genomic RNA (31), its interaction with the RdRp is independent of viral RNA (51) binding of TMV RdRp and eEF1A requires the RdRp M domain, and downregulating levels of eEF1A in plants by gene silencing resulted in dramatically reduced levels of eEF1A in plants. overexpression of an eEF1A mutant (T22S) could result in a reduced half-life of p33 and significantly lowered TBSV RNA replication. this was not attributable to defects in protein translation by the eEF1A mutant because cellular levels of the viral RdRp p92pol were not affected. eEF1A is a component of the VSV transcriptase complex. it was described as a protein complex containing viral proteins L, P, and heat shock protein 60. eEF1A is important for transcription of viral mRNAs but not for genomic RNA replication. minus-strand RNA includes an RNA leader region (blue) followed by the N gene (black) transcription start site. the viral replicase complex is composed of the L protein and N-P complex proteins that initiate transcription from a promoter located in the RNA leader. eEF1A plays an important role in minus-strand RNA synthesis. eEF1A and eEF1G were copurified with RT from reverse transcription complexes (RTCs) by gradient centrifugation and colocalized with RT following infection of cells (62). eEF1A was inhibited when target cells were pretreated with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that downregulated steady-state levels of eEF1A or eEF1G, an outcome that was attributed to the instability of the viral RTCs in BVDV NS5A protein is associated with cellular membranes via an amino-terminal helix that inserts itself into the luminal leaflet of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like membranes. eEF1A interacts with viral proteins other than RNA polymerases Virus family Viral protein interacting with eEF1A Reference Bovine viral diarrhea virus Flaviviridae NS5A 63 Hepatitis C virus Flavivirida eEF1A inhibitory effect could be relieved by addition of purified recombinant eEF1A in in vitro translation system. both intact eEF1A and a C-terminally truncated eEF1A, p36, were identified in chromatographically purified proteins assayed by gel shift assay. p36 is important for several aspects of poliovirus replication. eEF1A was identified as an MA binding protein by using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a library made from human HeLa cells. the interaction required the MA basic region, and the basic amino acid residues, but not the NC zinc finger domains, were required for interaction. the significance of these outcomes is unclear, as Gag has not been reported to have similar effects when overexpressed in cells. eEF1A was shown to interact with the HIV-1 Nef protein in in vitro and cell-based assays. amino acid residues 1 to 74 of eEF1A (domain I) were required for interaction with the Nef C-terminal region (amino acid residues 55 to 204) analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic cell lysate fractions indicated that Nef regulated the nucleocytoplasmic localization of eEF1A. this eEF1A was found to colocalize with viral replication complexes (RCs) and antibodies to eEF1A coimmunoprecipitated viral RC proteins (36), suggesting a role for eEF1A in facilitating virus replication complex formation. eEF1A and eEF1G are crucial for HIV reverse transcription complex formation, stability, and function. plants inhibited TBSV replication and pathogenesis. eEF1A and eEF1B act concertedly to affect TBSV RNA synthesis. downregulation of eEF1B expression inhibits RNA virus replication in plants. the anti-EF-Tu and -EF-Ts association reagents kirromycin and GDP could effectively inhibit Q replicase activity. EF-Tu cross-linked to EF-Ts is far more effective at renaturation of Q replicase activity than untreated EF-T and EF-Ts in vitro. canonical eukaryotic translation elongation factor complex, eEF1, consists in part of two eEF1A molecules bound to the eEF1B complex. the eEF1 complex comprises up to three proteins: eEF1G, eEF1B, and eEF1D. it is not known whether the HIV-1 RTC associates with an intact eEF1 complex or a novel protein complex involving eEF1A, eEF1 eEF1A has been detected specifically in purified HIV-1 virions. but not in Moloney murine leukemia virus virions (66, 95, 96) eEF1A can be cleaved by HIV-1 protease. cytochalasin D is a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization. a \u201cmoonlighting\u201d function of eEF1A in actin bundling may be targeted by viruses. HPVs are small double-stranded DNA viruses from the papillomaviridae family. they are capable of causing lesions or tumors by infecting basal keratinocytes. eEF1A can be found in a stoichiometric complex with activation-induced cytidine deaminase. eEF1A can be found in a stoichiometric complex with activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in chicken. eEF1A is a potent mutator that can be induced by CD40 ligand. a member of the AID family of proteins, APOBEC3, has broad antiretroviral activities. eEF1A-AID interaction is enhanced or inhibited by viral infection. many viruses use eEF1A, and many use eEF1A. eEF1A1 is not the only cellular factor subverted for viral RNA transcription and replication. eEF1A has not been implicated as an influenza virus RNA replication cofactor. there is no evidence that eEF1A is associated with its cofactors when participating in noncanonical functions. the eEF1 complex is essential for cellular metabolism. precise targeting of specific domains may be a promising avenue for further research."}
