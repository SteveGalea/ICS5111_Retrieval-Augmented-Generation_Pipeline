{"summary": "eukaryotic cells dispose of a set of antiviral genes. the effects of anti-HIV-1 factors acting early post-entry and during virus release include SAMHD1, APOBEC3G, Mx2 and tetherin. a final protease-mediated series of cleavage and rearrangement events renders immature virions fully infectious. these rearrangements furthermore trigger the clustering of sparse Env trimers on the virus surface. the right configuration of particles is crucial for assuring a high infectious quality, which is reflected by their ability to efficiently infect new target cells. ISGs constitute a large group of several hundred genes, from which only a few of them have been analyzed in-depth for potential antiviral activity. 90K acts antiviral against HIV-1 by reducing the particle infectivity of newly produced HIV-1 virions [14]. the exact mode of action of 90K remains elusive to date. co-IP experiments failed so far to provide evidence for a detectable interaction of 90K with HIV-1 Env. 90K protein is undetectable in primary CD4+ T-cells and in all analyzed immortalized T-cell lines. 90K protein is undetectable in primary CD4+ T-cells. despite type I IFN-mediated upregulation of 90K mRNA, 90K expression is tightly repressed at the post-transcriptional level in T-cells. it is unclear whether the drawback of reduction of virion infectivity is outweighed by improved immune escape. 90K acts antiviral against HIV-1 by reducing particle infectivity of newly produced HIV-1 virions. a set of modified variants of 90K revealed that the two central protein-binding domains are required and sufficient for 90K s antiviral activity. the exact mode of action of 90K remains elusive to date. 90K protein is undetectable in primary CD4+ T-cells and in all analyzed immortalized T-cell lines. despite type I IFN-mediated upregulation of 90K mRNA, 90K expression is tightly repressed at the post-transcriptional level in T-cells. IFITM proteins are two-pass transmembrane proteins located predominantly at the plasma membranes (IFITM1) or at endosomal and lysosomal membranes (IFITM2 and 3) they belong to the CD225/dispanin protein superfamily, which exists throughout the kingdoms, including bacteria, invertebrates and primates [21] a minor SNP in human ifitm3, rs12252-C, leads to expression of an N-terminally truncated IFITM3 protein, strongly associates with a poor prognosis during pandemic H1N1/09 Influenza A infection. the impact of IFITM proteins on single-round HIV-1 infection has been discussed controversially. the antiviral effect potentiates when IFITM is expressed on donor and target cells. IFITM proteins are incorporated into membranes of nascent virions. they decrease particle infectivity by impairing fusion. an intact nef gene is required in vivo for sustained viremia and development of immunodeficiency. a long-appreciated activity of Nef is the enhancement of HIV-1 particle infectivity. the most pronounced requirement for Nef is seen in lymphoid cells. SERINC proteins are highly conserved, multi-pass transmembrane proteins expressed predominantly at the plasma membrane with poorly elucidated cellular functions. SERINC5 and SERINC3 were reported to inhibit HIV-1 in the absence of Nef in a dose-dependent and synergistic fashion. fusion does probably not account for the far more pronounced infectivity decrease imposed by physiological levels of SERINC5 expression. future work is needed to fully understand the antiviral mode of action of SERINC proteins. a better understanding of the SERINC-imposed antiviral block to infection might be translated into the design of a small antiviral molecule that interrupts Nef-SERINC interaction."}
