{"summary": "pulmonary abnormalities were found in 60% of neutropenic patients with persistent fever (>48 hours) and a normal CXR. a delayed start of appropriate treatment has a negative impact on clinical outcome. LDCT is performed with low mean radiation doses below 1.5 mSv. LDCT is performed with low mean radiation doses below 1.5 mSv. LDCT already acquired on day 1 of febrile neutropenia would improve detection of pulmonary infections. the diagnostic workup was started according to the ESMO guidelines. patients received broad spectrum antibiotics (imipenem) within 2 hours. all patients received selective digestive tract decontamination at the start of chemotherapy. sputum was tested for bacteria (gram, stain, culture) and fungal pathogens (blancophore stain, culture) other microbiological testing was only performed if judged appropriate by the attending physician. serum samples were taken twice weekly for galactomannan (GM) testing at the end of inclusion. IFD was considered to be ruled out in all patients recovering from neutropenic fever within 3 days without appropriate treatment. LDCT images were acquired at a tube potential of 80 kVp and a tube current-time product of 10 mAs or 20 mAs. anonymized images were first independently evaluated by a board certified radiologist and a radiology resident. the observers used a standard imaging scoring table. re-evaluation was performed during consensus reading of the study exams. LDCT could increase detection rate of pulmonary infiltrates by 80%. from 15% with CXR to 27%, considering expected incidence of pulmonary focus of infection in febrile neutropenia of 30%. a temperature of 38\u00b0C for more than 1 hour, accompanied by an absolute neutrophil count of 0.5109/L or a neutrophil count 1.0109/L with a predicted decline to 0.5109/L within 3 days. patients excluded in case of a known focus of infection unrelated to the lower respiratory tract at inclusion, active possible or probable fungal infection at inclusion, or concomitant participation in clinical research. swab was also tested for atypical pathogens with PCR pack 3. sputum was tested for bacteria (gram, stain, culture) and fungal pathogens (blancophore stain, culture) clinical criteria for a pulmonary infection included coughing, sputum production, dyspnea or an oxygen saturation level 93%. microbiological criteria were positive culture or PCR for bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens known to cause pulmonary infections. a throat swab was tested for viral pathogens with PCR pack 1. sputum was tested for bacteria (gram, stain, culture) and fungal pathogens. a broncho-alveolar lavage was performed. consensus diagnosis of a fever episode was defined according to predefined categories as either pulmonary infection or non-pulmonary causes of fever such as line infection, mucositis, other infections (i.e. sinusitis), unknown focus of fever or any combination of the above. LDCT results were not used for consensus diagnosis. clinical criteria included pain when swallowing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/cramping and diarrhea, physical examination and the absence of a positive microbiological test. LDCT images were acquired at a tube potential of 80 kVp and a tube current-time product of 10 mAs or 20 mAs depending on patient\u2019s weight. LDCT is a better diagnostic tool than CXR for detection of pulmonary infections on the first day of neutropenic fever. the primary objective was to investigate whether LDCT is a better diagnostic tool than CXR for detection of pulmonary infections. a p-value of 0.05 was considered significant. a total of 72 consecutive patients were recruited between March 2013 and December 2014. a total of 72 patients were excluded. consensus diagnosis 11 patients (16.4%) had a pulmonary infection, of which 5 had IFD (2 possible, 3 probable), 1 had rhinovirus and 5 pneumonia of unknown aetiology. 5 of the patients with pneumonia underwent bronchoscopy due to persistent fever and abnormalities on HRCT. overall nonspecific mucositis was the most likely cause of fever. causes 16 (23.9) Unknown 15 (22.4) Total 80a aIn 13 patients multiple causes of fever were described in a single fever episode. the mean interval between CXR and LDCT was 3.1 6.3 hours. none of the patients experienced adverse events as a result of LDCT scanning or chest radiography. uncorrected McNemar test showed no statistically significant difference in the proportion of scans positive for pulmonary infection between CXR and LDCT. only one of the patients with a false positive LDCT had respiratory symptoms (cough), however a microbiological respiratory evaluation was negative. XR acquired on day 1 of febrile neutropenia without signs of pulmonary infection. LDCT images showing solid consolidations with halo signs suspect for IFD. no (n = 56) CXR Positive (n = 8) 4 4 PPV 50% (17\u201383%) Negative (n = 59) 7 52 NPV 88% (76\u201395%) Sensitivity 36% (12\u201368%) Specificity 93% (82\u201398%) Pulmonary Infection Yes (n = 11) No (n = 56) LDCT Positive (n = 13) 8 5 PPV 62% (32\u201385%) Negative (n = 54) 3 51 NP 5 patients in this cohort were classified as either probable (n = 3) or possible (n = 2) IFD. the diagnosis of probable IFD was based on a positive BAL GM test in all cases and 2 out of 3 also had a positive serum GM test. we established an improved detection rate from 11.9% of radiographs to 19.4% of the LDCT scans but our primary endpoint was not met. despite the lower than expected incidence of pulmonary infections in this study, the study was underpowered. LDCT is the first study to evaluate LDCT in all patients with febrile neutropenia on day 1 of fever. this is important because detection of a focus of infection in febrile neutropenia is difficult and patients often undergo several diagnostic tests and uncertain treatments which can have negative side effects. in 38 of the 67 patients a CXR was the only imaging modality available for the consensus meeting, since HRCT was only performed in case of persistent fever. clinical symptoms of cough, sputum production and dyspnea are not always evident in a neutropenic patient. the use of LDCT scans for detection of pulmonary lesions seems promising. out of 5 fever episodes classified as either possible or probable IFD, 4 patients already had abnormalities suspect for IFD on their LDCT. this could have had an effect on the incidence of pulmonary infections. CT as imaging tool in patients with suspected IFD in order to decrease radiation exposure."}
