DMSO (0.5%) was used as the solvent in each group. concentration providing 50% protection was defined as the 50% effective concentration (EC50) MDCK cells were infected (MOI = 5.0) and treated or not with test compounds. at 4 h p.i., the cells were fixed and blocked and then reacted with anti-NP primary antibody. real-time (RT)-PCR was performed using MDCK cells. tg16, anti-IKK, anti-p65, anti-p-JNK, anti-p-ERK, anti-p-p38, anti-NP, and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. to detect NF-B p65, the nuclear protein was extracted. mice were housed for 5 days for acclimation and maintained on standard rodent chow with water ad libitum. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg of body weight) and then infected intranasally with five 50% mouse lethal doses of A/PR8 virus in a 50-l volume to achieve 100% lethality. eighty-nine medicinal plants were collected from the Yulin medicine market (Guangxi, China) each specimen was deposited in our laboratory. cytotoxicity of the tested drugs was measured using the MTT method (20) plasmids were inserted into pcDNA 3.0 plasmid. corresponding to amino acids 1 to 159 and 160 to 262, respectively. plasmids were named pMC and pMN, respectively. the cells were infected with IAV (multiplicity of infection = 2.0) after 1 h at 4\u00b0C, the fluorescence intensities were determined using a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite M1000) the FI was measured at 610 and 509 nm after excitation at 488 nm. the cells were fixed using 3% formaldehyde and visualized using an upright fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 90i) TCID50 and antiviral assay were evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) method. t i o n o f t e s t c o m p o u n d ( %) = O D t e s t c o m p o u n d ( %) concentration providing 50% protection was defined as the 50% effective concentration (EC50) the selective index (SI) was defined as the CC50 divided by the EC50. avirin and 0.5% DMSO were used as the positive control (PC) and negative control (NC), respectively. at 4 h p.i., the cells were fixed and blocked and then reacted with anti-NP primary antibody. NP, and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. to detect NF-B p65, the nuclear protein was extracted. DMSO-PBS (10% [vol/vol]), S0 (25 mg/kg/day), S3 (25 mg/kg/day) and ribavirin (75 mg/kg/day) were given twice a day (at 12-hour intervals) for 10 days. three mice per group were euthanized at day 6 when the virus titers in the lungs reached the maximum (28), and the viral titers in their lungs were analyzed. a log rank (Mantel-Cox) 2 test was conducted using GraphPad Prism 5 software. our drug-screening model consisted of three plasmids, pMC-atg5, pMN-atg12, and pEGFP-atg16. the human Atg5 and Atg12 genes were fused with the N and C segments of a red fluorescent protein (mCherry) FI was measured at 610 nm after excitation at 587 nm. subsequently, the FRET reaction took place between the Atg5-Atg12 heterodimer and the Atg16 fusion protein. FI was expressed as the ratio of FI610 to FI509. ##, P 0.01 versus the untreated group; ##, P 0.01 versus the IAV-plus-DMSO group. we determined the influence of DMSO (0.5%) on the model. all drugs were dissolved in 0.5% DMSO. we analyzed 89 medicinal plants using anti-Flag antibody. we also determined the transcriptional activity of the plasmids. no significant differences were observed between the constructs. the anti-IAV activities of S0 and its derivatives were determined using the SRB method. the EC50s of S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and ribavirin were 70.73, 13.83, 5.32, 2.36, 3.81, 25.71, and 43.44 M, respectively. pretreatment of virus suspensions or cells with S0 or S3 before infection had no significant influence on the virus yield. we then investigated whether S0 and S3 inhibited viral protein and mRNA synthesis at this stage (1 to 4 h p.i.) DMSO (0.5%) was used as an NC (virus-only group) the data are expressed as means SD of 3 experiments, each performed in duplicate. *, P 0.05, and **, P 0.01 versus the NC. the fluorescence intensity was measured at 509 and 610 nm after excitation at 488 nm. BiFC-FRETe was expressed as the ratio of FI610 to FI509. ratio of cells containing EGFP-LC3 dots to cells expressing EGFP in the NC group was significantly higher than that of the BG group. the ratios in the ribavirin-, S0-, and S3-treated groups were significantly decreased.

ROS-mediated JNK activation can upregulate the expression of Atg5, Atg7, and Beclin 1 (39). p38 MAPK is reported to link oxidative stress to autophagic gene expression (40). A549 cells were infected (MOI = 0.001) and treated or not with ribavirin, S0, or S3. the cells were simultaneously treated or not with H2O2 (100 M), LPS (10 M), EGF (100 ng/ml) and anisomycin (10 M), respectively. atg5, Atg3, and Atg12 in the NC group were significantly increased compared to those in the BG group. effect on the expression of Atg12 was not significant (P > 0.05) the effects of Atg7 and Atg3 depletion on the viral yield were measured by the SRB method at 24 and 48 h p.i. the data are expressed as the means SD of three independent experiments. the mice treated with the 25-mg/kg/day dose of S3 had at least a 100-fold decrease in virus titers in their lungs. in vivo, we quantified viral titers in the lungs at day 6 postinfection. atg16 was fused to EGFP after cotransfection. FI was determined at 509 and 610 nm after excitation at 488 nm. FI was expressed as the ratio of FI610 to FI509. mut-Atg5, mut-Atg16, and IAV infection on cell viability, as determined by the MTT method. DMSO, mut-Atg5, mut-Atg16, and IAV infection on cell viability. mutation in Atg16 (mut-Atg16) deleted the Atg5-binding domain in the N terminus of Atg16. this disrupted the interaction between Atg5 and Atg16. after cotransfection with pMC-mut-atg5, pMN-atg12, and pEGFP-mut-atg16, the BiFC signal and BiFC-FRETe were significantly decreased compared to the untreated group. the cytotoxicities of S0 and its derivatives (S1 to S5) were shown in Fig. 2A. the estimated CC50 was greater than 400 M. the anti-IAV activities of silybin and its derivatives were determined using the SRB method. the order of anti-IAV efficacy was S3 > S4 > S2 > S1 > S5 > ribavirin > S0. the anti-IAV efficacy of S0 was similar to the anti-HCV and anti-HIV efficacies reported by researchers. S0 and S3 inhibited IAV replication at 1 to 4 h p.i., as determined by a time course assay. before infection, virus was incubated with medium containing S0 or S3 for 3 h. S0 and S3 significantly decreased this elevated BiFC signal and BiFC-FRETe induced by IAV infection (Fig. 4C, D, E, and F). a co-IP assay also showed the same result. 0 and S3 can inhibit the formation of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16 heterotrimer. after IAV infection, cells were collected and subjected to a coimmunoprecipitation assay. A549 cells were infected or not with IAV (MOI = 0.001) and treated or not with ribavirin, S0, or S3. at 8, 16, or 24 h p.i., the cells were collected and subjected to Western blotting using a human LC3 antibody. S0 and S3 inhibit the formation of the Atg12-Atg5/Atg16 heterotrimer. they were related to their antioxidant activities. they inhibited the formation of the Atg12-Atg5/Atg16 heterotrimer. 0.091 0.021c 52.67 7.01c 120.33 14.06c 5.76 0.92d 87.67 8.36c 47.33 3.86c 3.04 0.43c S3 26.67 6.96c 0.087 0.026c 48.33 8.83c 106.67 13.08c 6.73 0.93d 90.33 9.59c 3.21 0.73c. pathways, and S0 and S3 significantly inhibited the activation of the IKK/NF-B and ERK/p38 MAPK pathways induced by IAV infection. an oxidant (H2O2; 100 M), an IKK activator (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]; 10 M), an ERK activator (epidermal growth factor [EGF]; 100 ng/ml) and a p38 activator (aniso KK, ERK, and p38 activators antagonized the anti-IAV activities of S0 and S3. cells were treated or not with ribavirin, S0, or S3. the cells were treated or not with H2O2 (100 M), LPS (10 M), EGF (100 ng/ml) and anisomycin (10 M) in noninfected or infected A549 cells, 0.5% DMSO was used as a BG or NC. ribavirin was used as a PC (MOI = 0.001; incubation time, 24 h) the zones and average gray values of each band were detected and quantified. the depletion of Atg7 and Atg3 by siRNA decreased the formation of the Atg12-Atg5/Atg16 complex and reduced the viral yield. we speculated that the decreased expression of Atg7 and Atg3 induced by S0 and S3 might inhibit the formation of the Atg12-Atg5/Atg16 complex and reduce the viral yield. infected mice were treated with DMSO-PBS (16% [vol/vol]), ribavirin (75 mg/kg/day), S0 (25 mg/kg/day), or S3 (25 mg/kg/day) for 10 days from day 1. a drug-screening model targeting autophagy is very useful for the treatment of these diseases. western blotting is the usual method used to detect the activation of mTOR. but this technique is not amenable to large-scale, high-throughput drug screening. the beclin 1 complex is also a crucial autophagic regulatory mechanism. biFC-FRETe is dependent on the distance between the donor and the acceptor. if the BiFC reaction is completely disrupted, the BiFC-FRET system will lack an acceptor fluorophore, and the BiFC-FRETe will be zero. oxidative stress may be the major contributor to IAV-induced acute lung injury. and S3 may inhibit oxidative stress or the activation of the ERK/p38 MAPK and IKK pathways. silybin (25 to 50 M) can inhibit the activation of the JNK/AP-1, ERK/MEK/Raf, and NHE1/IB signal pathways."}
