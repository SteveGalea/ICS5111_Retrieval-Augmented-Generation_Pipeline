{"summary": "Background Plasminogen (Pg) is converted to the active enzyme plasmin (Pm) by different plasminogen activators (tissue plasminogen activators and urokinase) the bacterial activators streptokinase and staphylokinase activate Pg to Pm and thus are used clinically for thrombolysis. the identification of Pg-activators is therefore an important step in understanding their functional mechanism. plasminogen activators are serine proteases which convert plasminogen to plasmin, thus promoting fibrinolysis. the plasminogen activator system controls not only the intravascular fibrin deposition, but also participates in a wide variety of physiologic and pathologic processes. plasminogen is a single chain polypeptide made up of 414 amino acid residue. it binds with free circulating plasminogen to form a complex (1:1). bacterial SAK is however inactive, until it is converted to an active SAK-plasmin complex by other Pg-activators. no prediction tools are currently available to predict Pg-activators. aryotic genome sequencing requires user-friendly computational tools. 82 genome, 2003 genes and 6200 proteins have been identified as plasminogen activator related sequence sources. a tool should provide additional basic information on input sequences. we have also implemented programs to calculate molecular weight, amino acid residues calculation and percentage of amino acid composition. this tool will serve not only for prediction but also to know basic properties of input sequences. activators against non Pg-activators resulted in a maximum accuracy of 88.37% with 95.24%, 83.50%, 0.87 sensitivity, specificity and Mathew correlation coefficient. individual Pg-activator sub-class (SAK, SK, tPA and UK) predictions, where one sub-class of Pg-activators was considered as positive and all other sub-class activators taken as negative for SVM training. the performance of various SVM models was developed using AC, DC, PSSM profiles and Hybrid methods on the individual Pg-activators SAK, SK, tPA and UK respectively. the performance of various SVM models was developed using AC, DC, PSSM profiles and Hybrid methods. hybrid prediction method combining amino acid composition (AC) and dipeptide composition (DC) was also attempted to solve the Pg-activator protein prediction problem. accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and MCC were 85.63%, 97.71%, 77.06%, and 0.85 respectively. the parameters were subsequently optimized for predicting Pg-activators subclass. they achieved a maximum accuracy of 93.98%, 97.10%, 97.73%, 92.06% with MCC of 0.92, 0.97, 0.98, 0.90 for SAK, SK, tPA and UK respectively. in general all models performed comparatively well as estimated by accuracy and MCC measures. the false positive rate (FPR) estimated on the negative dataset was 0.17, 0.25 and 0.18 respectively. the prediction scores graph was generated by the best model which implemented in our online server. the best model of SAK, SK, tPA and UK was used to generate the prediction scores graph which used in online-server. AC - Method of SAK, SK, tPA and UK Pg-activators, B). DC - method of SAK, SK, tPA and UK Pg-activators. pg-activators in all methods (AC, DC, PSSM and Hybrid). tPA Pg-activators in AC, DC, PSSM and Hybrid methods. tPA Pg-activators in AC, DC, PSSM and Hybrid methods. Cys and Trp are less common in Pg-activators (SK and SAK) of prokaryotic origin compared to eukaryotic Pg-activators. ala, Gly, Argis comparatively higher in eukayotic Pg-activators (tPA and UK) the performance of various SVM models of Pg-activators (SAK, SK, tPA and UK) with non-Pg-activators was developed using AC, DC,PSSM profiles and Hybrid models in five-fold cross validation ACC(%) SN(%) SP(%) MCC Parameters Methods. based on these parameters, we have developed models to discriminate Pg-activators from non-Pg-activators sequences. further classification models for sub-classification of pg-activators have been developed and resulted in accuracy of 86.82%, 86.40%, 92.70%, 87.03% of SAK, SK, tPA and UK respectively. sensitivity, specificity and 0.83 MCC were shown in Table 2. itivity, SP- specificity, MCC- Mathews correlation coefficient,C: tradeoff value, - gamma factor. hybrid prediction method combining amino acid composition (AC) and dipeptide composition (DC) was also attempted to solve the Pg-activator protein prediction problem. accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and MCC were 85.63%. prediction results obtained with optimized kernel parameters on known Pg-act peptides are shown in Additional file 1 a,b,c for SK, Additional file 2-a,b,c for UK and Additional file 4 for tPA of amino acid(AC), dipeptide(DC) and PSSM profiles composition respectively. it can be seen that a large number of activators are predicted over a threshold of 0.9 and all are predicted above threshold 0.5. -act proteins (SAK, SK, tPA and UK) against the SVM best models (implemented in the Pg-act server) prediction scores graph was generated by the best model which implemented in our online server. X-axis is indexed on Pg-activators of (SAK, SK, tPA and UK in respective order) and Y-axis is the score of the prediction. in order to confirm the performance of our models, we plotted the sensitivity versus 1-specificity chart, also known as receiver operating curve (ROC) new pg-activator sequences were retrieved from the latest versions of the Uniprot/Swissprot database. all these sequences were correctly predicted as positive by all pg-activator models (AC, DC, PSSM and Hybrid models) this included vampire bat saliva and Snake Venom pg-activators. Streptokinase (UK) lacks intrinsic protease activity. instead, SK forms a stoichiometric complex with plasminogen. the SK + Pg complex then activates plasminogen. all methods implemented are comparable predictors, including the simple amino acid composition model. a confusion matrix has been produced to cross check the predicted results. all prokaryotic pg-activators (SK, SAK) are correctly classified while few eukaryotic Pg-activators are misclassified. the amino acid composition is the fraction of each amino acid in a protein. the SVM_light requires the encoding of data into vectors. dipeptide composition has been calculated by a vector having a fixed length of 400 (20 20) dimensions. the final performance was calculated by average the results of testing on all five sets. sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and mathew correlation coefficient (MCC) were adopted for performance evaluation of the classifiers. negative dataset contains 356 Pg-activators (positive dataset) negative dataset consisted of 501 non Pg-activator sequences randomly selected out of 19534 regulatory proteins. negative sequence set was selected by the general keyword query for \u201cregulatory proteins\u201d in Uniprot/Swisprot (regulatory proteins from various species) sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and mathew correlation coefficient were adopted for performance evaluation of the classifiers. sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and mathew correlation coefficient were adopted for performance evaluation of the classifiers. authors have declared that they have no competing interests. authors carried developing web server with guidance from CL. MK and CL participated in developing computational methods. SM predicted all tPA proteins, the scores sorted from minimum to maximum displayed according to their predicted scores. the new and unknown tPA proteins can easily identify the similar proteins according to their predicted scores."}
