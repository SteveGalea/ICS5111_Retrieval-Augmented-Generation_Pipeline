{"summary": "emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) at the beginning of the 21st century signaled a new era for emergent viral disease. dozens of viruses have emerged from animal populations to produce significant outbreaks in humans. a decade after SARS-CoV, infections with MERS-CoV continue with periodic reintroductions still occurring 6 years after its discovery. a number of live attenuated strains have been developed targeting both conserved CoV elements or specific approaches that may be strain or group dependent. a number of live attenuated strains have also been developed targeting both conserved CoV elements or specific approaches that may be strain or group dependent. targeting both conserved coronavirus activities produced a stable, attenuated virus capable of protection from heterologous challenge, efficacy in aged mice, and absence of reversion in immunocompromised models. dNSP16 mutant viruses maintain no replication attenuation in vero cells that lack type I IFN responses (18\u201320). despite proof of concept studies, several questions about the efficacy of the NSP16 vaccine remain. despite the absence of replication attenuation, it is especially important to consider the NSP16 vaccine platform in the context of the overall host response. mock group were used to generate clustered expression heat maps. dNSP16 coronaviruses showed no significant attenuation in terms of viral replication in vitro except in the context of type I IFN pretreatment. in vivo characterizations found no deficit in viral replication at early times. network analysis found similar results, with overlapping signatures at early time points. late RNA expression demonstrated waning host responses consistent with reduced viral loads. overlap with WT host responses may indicate potential risk for inducing significant damage prior to attenuation of infection at late times. dNSP16-vaccinated mice were vaccinated with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV dNSP16 (blue) or mock vaccinated (PBS), monitored for 28 days. mice were challenged with 105 PFU of heterologous SARS-CoV expressing SHC014 spike (SHC014-MA15) dNSP16 vaccine protects from heterologous challenge in young mice. the 2\u2032O MTase mutant was equal to WT SARS-CoV infection in terms of weight loss and lethality (Fig. 3A and B) despite replication attenuation, the dNSP16 mutant harbors pathogenic potential at high doses in aged mice. dNSP16-infected aged mice had reduced disease compared to control. reduced pathogenesis corresponded to reduced viral replication at both days 2 and 4. dNSP16 infection resulted in only marginal disease in terms of weight loss. dNSP16 mutant has demonstrated efficacy as a vaccine following both heterologous challenge and in aged models of SARS-CoV disease. previous studies with SARS-CoV wild-type and ExoN mutants found that mice lacking functional B and T cells were unable to clear virus. dNSP16 mutant is not currently a viable vaccine candidate due to reversion to virulence in immunocompromised populations. eight RAG/ mice were infected with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV dNSP16, monitored, and euthanized. three RAG/ homogenates (black) had no disease and no detectable virus. a live attenuated vaccine platform targeting only NSP16 activity should be limited to dire circumstances. one possibility is to expand the mutant beyond the original D130A mutations (two nucleotides) to include other members of the KDKE motif. we infected 10-week-old BALB/c mice with 104 PFU of either dNSP16/ExoN or WT SARS-CoV MA15. similar to the exoN mutant (16), the dNSP16/ExoN mutant produced no weight loss with significant changes compared to WT infection as early as day 2 postinfection. however, viral replication was significantly attenuated at both days 2 and 4. dNSP16/ExoN mice were vaccinated with dNSP16/ExoN or mock vaccinated, monitored for 28 days, and challenged with 105 PFU of WT SARS-CoV MA15 (solid line) or heterologous SHC014-MA15 (dotted line) mice were examined over a 4-day time course for weight loss (E), viral titer (F), and lung hemorrhage (G) double mutant protects aged mice from lethal disease. results indicate dNSP16/ExoN mutant is highly attenuated. dNSP16/ExoN mutant is highly attenuated following primary challenge. twelve-month-old BALB/c mice were challenged with 100 PFU of dNSP16/ExoN (red) or 104 PFU (dotted lines/open circles) of WT SARS-CoV MA15 (black) or dNSP16/ExoN (red) and examined for weight loss (A), survival (B), lung viral titer (C) and lung hemorrhage (D) five RAG/ mice were infected with 104 PFU of dNSP16/ExoN mutant cleared from immunocompromised mice. dNSP16/ExoN showed no significant disease in RAG/ mice during acute infection. after 30 days, mice were euthanized, and lung tissue was harvested. dNSP16 coronaviruses demonstrate no significant attenuation in terms of viral replication in vitro except in the context of type I IFN pretreatment. in vivo characterizations found no deficit in viral replication at early times but a marked attenuation at late times postinfection (19, 20) these results suggest that early portions of dNSP16 infection are equivalent to wild-type (WT) virus infection. waning host responses could be seen as a positive signal for inducing robust immune responses for vaccine responses. overlap with host responses may indicate a potential risk for inducing significant damage prior to attenuation of infection. vaccine approaches must consider exposure to and protection from related, heterologous coronavirus strains. dNSP16 vaccine protects young mice from heterologous challenge. mice were vaccinated with 105 PFU of dNSP16 (blue) or mock vaccinated (PBS) mice were examined over a 4-day time course for weight loss (A), day 4 lung virus titer (B) and day 4 lung hemorrhage (C) the dNSP16 mutant harbors pathogenic potential at high doses in aged mice. twelve-month-old BALB/c mice were challenged with 100 PFU of WT or dNSP16 (green) or mock challenged (PBS, gray) and then examined for weight loss (A), survival (B), and lung viral titer (C) over a time course. dNSP16 infection resulted in only marginal disease in terms of weight loss (5%) and respiratory parameters, including airway resistance (PenH), and midtidal expiratory flow (EF50, Fig. 3H). 12-month-old mice were vaccinated with 100 PFU of dNSP16 and subsequently challenged 28 days later with a lethal dose of wild-type SARS-CoV MA15 (105 PFU) reversion and adaptation of a live attenuated strain represents a significant concern for its use in response to human epidemics. previous studies with SARS-CoV wild-type and ExoN mutants found that mice lacking functional B and T cells (RAG/) were unable to clear virus, allowing continuous passage in vivo. dNSP16 mutant is not currently a viable vaccine candidate due to reversion to virulence in immunocompromised populations. eight RAG/ mice were infected with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV dNSP16. five of eight RAG/ homogenates (green) produced significant weight loss and lethality and had detectable input titers. a live attenuated vaccine platform targeting only NSP16 activity should be limited to dire circumstances. one possibility is to expand the NSP16 mutant beyond the original D130A mutations (two nucleotides) dNSP16/ExoN mutant produced no weight loss with significant changes compared to WT infection as early as day 2 postinfection. viral replication was significantly attenuated at both days 2 and 4. dNSP16/ExoN mutant may serve as possible live attenuated vaccine. sera from dNSP16/ExoN-vaccinated mice were capable of neutralizing both WT SARS-CoV and chimeric spike virus. dNSP16/ExoN vaccination resulted in ablation of viral titer at day 4 postinfection. double mutant protects aged mice from lethal disease. twelve-month-old BALB/c mice were challenged with 100 PFU of WT SARS-CoV (MA15) or the dNSP16/ExoN mutant. the 100-PFU dose of dNSP16/ExoN mutant was highly attenuated. disease scores indicated no evidence of hemorrhage in the aged mice challenged with the high dose of dNSP16/ExoN. twelve-month-old mice were vaccinated with 100 PFU of SARS-CoV dNSP16/ExoN (red) or mock vaccinated. mice were examined over a 4-day time course for weight loss (E) and lung viral titer (F) five RAG/ mice were infected with 104 PFU of SARS-CoV dNSP16/ExoN. dNSP16/ExoN showed no significant disease in RAG/ mice during acute infection. after 30 days, mice were euthanized, and lung tissue was harvested, homogenized, clarified, and used to infect 10-week-old BALB/c mice. despite success in standard young mouse models, the coV NSP16 mutation alone carried significant risk for pathogenesis in aged animals. but pairing the NSP16 mutation with a second attenuating mutation provided a live attenuated vaccine capable of protecting against homologous and heterologous challenge. the study highlights the potential for NSP16 attenuation as a major feature of future live attenuated coronavirus vaccine approaches. mutations of the SARS NSP16 (K46A, K130A) individually resulted in replication attenuation, potential compensatory mutations, and concerns for mutant viability when used in combination. however, the original NSP16 mutation (D130A) produced equivalent replication requiring no need for compensatory mutations. results contrast with similar experiments with SARS-CoV ExoN mutants which maintained the ExoN mutation in immunocompromised mice but failed to revert to virul dNSP16/ExoN-vaccinated animals showed no signs of disease or viral replication. vaccination of aged models induced protection from high-dose SARS-CoV challenges. a multiple-mechanism, attenuation approach may be the fastest route to effective and safe vaccine in the context of an outbreak. despite initial successes, a truly effective MERS-CoV vaccine must also consider vulnerable aging populations and the threat from heterologous challenge. despite initial successes, a truly effective MERS-CoV vaccine must also consider vulnerable populations and the threat from heterologous challenge. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and inoculated with virus or mock diluted in PBS for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. after inoculation, the cells were washed three times, and fresh media were added to signify time zero. all virus cultivation was performed in a BSL3 laboratory with redundant fans in biosafety cabinets. whole-lung homogenate was determined by comparing virus-infected replicates to time-matched mock-infected replicates. criteria for DE in determining consensus ISG list were an absolute log2-fold change of >1.5 and a false discovery rate-adjusted P value of 0.05 for a given time point. mice were infected with vaccination doses of SARS-CoV dNSP16 or SARS-CoV dNSP16/ExoN as described above, monitored for clinical symptoms for 7 days, and challenged 4 weeks postvaccination with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV MA15. infected animals were monitored for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease. becco modified Eagle medium or Opti-MEM (Gibco, CA) and 5% fetal clone serum (HyClone, South Logan, UT), along with antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) RNA isolation, microarray processing, and identification of de dNSP16 mutant viruses were performed as previously described. RNA isolation and microarray processing, quality control, and normalization from whole-lung homogenate was carried out as previously described. mice were infected with vaccination doses of 102 to 105 PFU of SARS-CoV MA15, SARS-CoV dNSP16, SARS-CoV dNSP16/ExoN virus, or a PBS mock treatment. mice were monitored for weight loss, morbidity, and clinical signs of disease. raw microarray data for these studies were deposited in publicly available databases in the national center for biotechnology information's gene expression Omnibus."}
