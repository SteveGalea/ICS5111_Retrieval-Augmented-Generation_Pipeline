{"summary": "novel way to administer micro/nanoparticles to treat lung and systemic diseases. several attempts of such deliveries have been made in experimental analyses on asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung hypoxia, edema, lung injury, lung transplantation fungal infection, pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer. however, existing pulmonary drug delivery devices still have poor efficiencies for delivering drugs to designated sites. elastic acinar model covers the entire alveolated distal airways and alveolar sacs. results indicate that the alveolar wall motion significantly increases particle deposition. particle deposition efficiency increases with higher inhalation tidal volume and aerosol size. a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) epidemic model is described based on an SI ordinary differential equation model. their results indicate that the state-dependent impulsive vaccination strategy could be used as a supplementary approach or under the situation when vaccine stockpile is limited. way and alveolar sacs and simulates particle transport and deposition via CFPD coupled with the fluid-structure interaction method. results indicate that the alveolar wall motion significantly increases particle deposition, and particle deposition efficiency increases with higher inhalation tidal volume and aerosol size. analysis and simulations show that the stochastic disturbance is conducive to epidemic diseases control. results indicate that the state-dependent impulsive vaccination strategy could be used as a supplementary approach or under the situation when vaccine stockpile is limited."}
