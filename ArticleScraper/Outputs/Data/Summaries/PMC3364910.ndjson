{"summary": "the study was done to identify viruses associated with acute lower respiratory tract infection among children less than 5 years. a total of 61.1% (22/36) of positive viruses were detected during the rainy season. systematic analysis also estimated 1.575 million deaths of children worldwide in 2008 as due to ARI. majority of acute lower respiratory tract infections in developed countries have been reported to be due to viral pathogens of which most common are RSV, PIV, influenza viruses, Adv, human Coronaviruses and Bocaviruses. a thousand bed tertiary medical facility is located in Ashanti Region, Kumasi. it is the most accessible tertiary and referral medical facility in Ghana. recruitment was done throughout the year 2008 till two or three patients were recruited. RT-PCR was performed for the detection of RNA viruses using the light cycler version 1.5 (Roche, Germany) the reaction mixture for RNA viruses was made up of 5 l of RNA extract, 1 l deoxynucleotide (dNTP) triphosphate (10 mM) (Qiagen), 12.5 l Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 12.5 l Qiagen One Step Enzyme Mix. DNA virus reaction mixture was made up of 5 l PCR buffer (10X), 1 l of dNTP mix (10 mM each), 1 l of MgCl2 (50 mM), 0.5 l of hot star Taq DNA Polymerase, 0.5 l of probe, 1 l of BSA (1 mg/ml) and 1 l each of sense and antisense primers.

PCR was performed on the purified product and RNA transcripts were synthesized from the lowest dilution using Ambion Megascripts T3 kit (Qiagen, Germany) Statistical analysis Data obtained was double entered into a spreadsheet database. it was then compared and cleaned for abnormal wrongful entries. a non-parametric K-sample test on the equality of medians was used. the maximum of 11 patients recruited for each month should have features of severe pneumonia or very severe pneumonia as defined by the WHO-IMCI protocol. a child was recruited only after the guardian or parents had consented. a standardized case record form was then used to record the history of the illness as well as the clinical features of pneumonia. RT-PCR amplification was performed for the detection of Adv, RSV, Influenza A (Flu A), Influenza B (Flu B), Parainfluenza 1(PIV 1), Parainfluenza 2 (PIV 2) and Parainfluenza 3 (PIV 3) using the light cycler version 1.5 (Roche, Germany) 5'-GGAAACATACGTGAACAAGCTTCA Reverse primer A 5'-CATCATCTTTTTTCTAAGCTTCA Reverse primer B 5'-TCATCATCTTTTTTCTAAGCTTCA Reverse primer B 5'-TCATCATCTTTTTTTTCTAGAACATTGTACTGA Probe 6FAM-TGTGTATGTGGAGCCTT- MGBNFQ Adenovirus Hexon gene [18] Forward primer 5'-GCCCCAGT the in vitro transcripts were prepared by amplifying the genes of interest of the viruses with specific set of primers. PCR was performed on the purified product and RNA transcripts were synthesized from the lowest dilution (with clear band) using Ambion Megascripts T3 kit. the final products were purified using Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) the copy numbers of the RNA transcripts were determined using a spectrophotometer (Themoscientific, U.S.A). the detection limit was determined as the last dilution after which all other replicates gave negative results. a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. a total of 128 patients were recruited over the period of January to December 2008. the median age of the patients was 12 months. 0.596 Parainfluenza 1, no.
