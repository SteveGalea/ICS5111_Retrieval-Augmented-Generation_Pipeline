{"summary": "the number of susceptible individuals has grown to date following cessation of routine vaccination. the threat of bioterrorist attack has led to debates on countermeasures in such an event. a statistical modeling study suggests that a small outbreak could be contained only implementing contact tracing and isolation. Rogers argued that the smallpox epidemic in India is relatively uniform (i.e., not apparently cyclical) compared to that in England and Wales [17, 19, 21]. he implicitly suggested that there is a negative correlation between humidity and smallpox mortality, but there was little association between smallpox and rainfall [17, 18]. despite the rigorous efforts before the global eradication, later progress on this issue was unfortunately subtle. quantitatively and explicitly analyzing time series data. no rigorous statistical analyses were made using observed data. if so, is the seasonality associated with humidity\" magnitude of the epidemics, the annual averages of the disaster size were 10.1 deaths (the Hague), 32.9 deaths (Berlin), 9.9 cases (Zurich), 428.6 deaths (the entire Netherlands), 5.28 deaths per 100 000 (Northwest Frontier province in India), 21.5 deaths (Shanghai) and 2.45 deaths per 100 000 (Bombay) spectral density decomposes a time series function into a sum of sines and cosines. the density plot (i.e., correlogram) was graphically plotted to determine if a sharp peak at a period of 12 months exists. smallpox cases tended to be modeled by generation, the idea of which is applied as follows. the reproduction number is simply given by ratio of successive generations of cases, which was implicitly understood in history by a pioneering epidemiologist. the expected number of cases in the next generation i + 3 is given by product of I i+2 and the reproduction number in the next month j + 1, R j+1, that is, E ( I i + 3 ) = R j + 1 I i + 2. (5) Given (4) and (5), the number of cases in month j + 1, C j+1(:= I i+2 + I i+3) is given using C j(:= I i + multiple linear regression analysis was employed to determine factors contributing to R(t) the monthly periodic terms (as shown in (9) were added to the list of independent variables. statistical data were analyzed using the statistical software JMP version 7.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) data were based on references collected by tracking all the references given in the relevant publications and repeating this task until we could find no further references. figures 1 shows the time series data by location with a monthly reporting interval. spectral density analysis first, the presence of seasonality was examined for all 7 datasets using spectral density analysis. the density plot was graphically plotted to determine if a sharp peak at a period of 12 months exists, corresponding to an annual cycle (i.e., seasonality) if R(t) 1, it suggests that the epidemic is in decline (vice verca, if R(t) > 1). This approach was employed to clearly show the seasonal patterns of transmission and partly address the issue of dependence among cases. the observation of an infected individual is not independent of other infected individuals. a pioneering epidemiologist, Clare Oswald Stallybrass (1881\u20141951) applied the theory to analyze the seasonality of various infectious diseases. monthly data contains exactly two generations, i, i + 1 and i + 2. the expected values are sufficient to characterize Poisson distributions. the assumption indicates that the conditional distribution of the reported number of cases in month j + 1, C j+1, given C j is given by C j + 1 C j Poisson [ ( 1 + R j + 1 ) R j 2 1 + R j C j ]. the relationship was investigated using both univariate and multivariate models. in the multivariate model, the year of occurrence was controlled for, but the sine and cosine of the month were not included due to colinearity with rainfall. the entire Netherlands data covers a relatively short period of time compared to the other datasets (Figure 1(d)) the density plot exhibits a multimodal pattern, reflecting an irregular temporal distribution (Figure 1(e)) the annual cycle is most clearly highlighted in the temporal distribution (Figure 1(g)) spectral densities of death and mortality (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)) did not exhibit a clear annual cycle, but the obvious peak at 12 months is seen for both datasets in terms of R(t) that is, seasonal patterns of smallpox transmission were reasonably shown with the use of R(t) even for the short- and long-term time series. monthly weather patterns and the effective reproduction number of smallpox in Northwest frontier province, India, from 1890\u20131921. no significant correlation was found between R(t) and rainfall. time series data in Zurich and Shanghai clearly revealed a peak at 12 months (Figure 2(c) and 2(f)) the entire Netherlands data covers a relatively short period of time compared to the other datasets. the short-term epidemic data for the entire Netherlands clearly shows that three peaks of R(t) coincide in every January with estimates above unity. spectral densities of death and mortality (Figures 2(d) and 2(b)) did not exhibit a clear annual cycle, but the obvious peak at 12 months is seen for both datasets. in both models, rainfall was not significantly associated with smallpox mortality. however, significant negative association was found for humidity. the study reanalyzed historical records of smallpox to examine the presence of seasonality. the remaining records reasonably showed seasonal variations either in the monthly observation or the reproduction number. even the short-term epidemic data for the entire Netherlands clearly revealed peaks of transmission every January. to date, it is known that the variola virus could survive in an infective state under different conditions of temperature and humidity. however, as temperature and humidity rise above 30\u00b0C and 55%, the virus is known to immediately lose infectivity. this suggests that we cannot ignore the seasonality even in the event of a short-term reintroduction of variola virus due to bioterrorist attack. the present study confirms that the transmission of smallpox does vary with season. however, seasonal factors for directly transmitted diseases are far more complex. experimental evidence supports the role of dry weather in the dynamics of influenza."}
