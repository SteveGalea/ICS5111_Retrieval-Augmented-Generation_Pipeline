{"summary": "IFNs are soluble factors produced by chicken cells of the chorio-allantoic membranes after contact with influenza virus. these IFNs can be produced by many cell types and primarily act as antiviral cytokines. infected and non-infected cells can produce IFN using distinct pattern recognition receptors. most cells express helicases (RIG-I or MDA-5) that sense nucleic acids of viral origin. some cells express TLRs that sense extracellular danger and pathogen-associated molecular patterns from the extracellular milieu. infection, growth of attenuated Herpes virus mutants in the eye and in trigeminal ganglia increased by more than 1000-fold in IFNAR-KO mice. several cases of fatal herpes encephalitis in newborns were associated with genetic deficiencies in genes encoding signal transduction factors of the IFN pathway. the importance of the interferon response against neurotropic viral infection in humans was evidenced by the discovery. ae Increased viral load and neurovirulence [22] Dengue virus Flaviviridae No clear effect of type I IFN [23] Herpes simplex virus 1 Herpesviridae Increased viral load [6] Influenza A virus Orthomyxoviridae Increased viral load in CNS [24] Thogoto virus Orthomyxoviridae Increased viral load in CNS, modified tropism [25] Measles virus Paramyxovirid the low basal IFN activity in the CNS has likely been evolutionary favored given the reported neurotoxicity of IFN. the particular sensitivity of the CNS to high IFN doses is particularly exemplified in the case of the progressive encephalopathy. the type III IFN family comprises three subtypes, IFN-1, IFN-2 and IFN-3. in the mouse, IFN-1 is a pseudogene, whereas all 3 genes are expressed in humans. type III IFNs signal through a receptor distinct from that of type I IFNs. RT-PCR data show an overall weak expression of the IL28R- subunit of the IFN- receptor in the CNS as compared to other tissues. the Mx1 protein, used as a marker of the IFN response, was detected only in epithelial cells of choroid plexus and in few meningeal cells. pDC-produced IFN was found to be instrumental in resistance against coronavirus infection. but other immune cells as well as resident cells may contribute to IFN production. in vitro, the various CNS cell types can produce IFN, including neurons. astrocytes and microglial cells/macrophages accounted for 43% and 41% of luciferase expression respectively. astrocytes and microglial cells/macrophages accounted for 43% and 41% of luciferase expression respectively, although viral antigen-positive cells were mostly neurons. luciferase expression, driven by the IFN- promoter, will be restricted to that specific cell type. a wild-type strain of la Crosse virus was used as well as the delNSs mutant. microglial cells are not infected but produce IFN, likely in a TLR-dependent way. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) spread from the olfactory bulb to the entire CNS was efficiently controlled by a local IFN response occurring at the level of the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb [32,66]. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) spread from the olfactory bulb to the entire CNS was efficiently controlled by a local IFN response occurring at the level of the glomerular layer choroid plexus strongly respond to circulating IFN- and endothelial cells respond to circulating IFN-/. type I IFN produced in the periphery is expected to limit neuroinvasion via Trojan horses. s concur to limit neuroinvasion via infection of cells that form the BBB. however, data are still lacking to circumstantiate this view. how IFN limits transport and/or quasispecies diversity is another open question. oligodendroglial cells were recently reported to be poorly reactive to interferon compared to microglial cells. dozens of ISGs have been identified in cells treated with type I or type III IFN or after viral infection of the CNS. APOBEC3G editing enzyme was discovered as a restriction factor of human immunodeficiency virus [84] or the promyelocytic leukemia proteins (PML) other ISGs act against a broader range of viruses. these include ISGs coding for RIG-like helicases which are involved in a positive feedback loop of IFN production. PKR also acts on a broad range of viruses as it is both an inducer and an effector of the rabies virus is a highly neurotropic virus responsible for a fatal disease in a wide range of animals and in humans. the P protein of rabies virus is a paradigm of non-structural protein interfering with IFN induction, IFN signaling and IFN-induced antiviral effectors. the phosphoprotein of rabies virus thus offers a typical example of multifunctional protein that evolved to interfere with various steps of the IFN pathway. the phosphoproteins of the distantly related neurotropic Nipah and Hendravirus also interfere with various steps of the IFN pathway, yet using additional mechanisms. other neurotropic picornaviruses like theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) evolved to encode a non-structural protein, L, that lacks protease activity but targets very similar functions as those targeted by polio or rhinovirus proteases [30,106,107,108]. eIF4G [121] HIV Retroviridae Pro Sequestration of RIG-I [122] Mouse hepatitis virus Coronaviridae nsp3 Deubiquitination of TBK1 [123] Human coronavirus (HCoV) Coronaviridae papain-like protease (PLP) Non-proteolytic disruption of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKK complexes [124] the role of IFN in axonal transport or in the protection of the BBB requires further studies. it is expected that tools like conditional KO mice lacking an IFN receptor chain would be instrumental in such studies. the last step, viral spread within the CNS, has been the focus of some recent studies. resistance to a specific virus is provided by the combined action of many ISGs that act on a given virus range. a challenge for the future will be unravel the mode of action of those ISGs and to understand the basis of their specificity."}
