{"summary": "in 2013, viral hepatitis became the seventh highest cause of death worldwide. it is responsible for about 1.4 million deaths annually from acute infection, cirrhosis and liver cancer(1,2) of those deaths, about 47% are attributable to hepatitis B virus (HBV), 48 % to hepatitis C (HCV) and the remaining are considered for hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis E (HEV) the term aptamer refers to the Greek aptus, i.e. \u201cto fit\u201d, and merus, i.e. \u201cparticle\u201d(10). aptamers are recognized with high affinity and specificity to target molecule. aptamers present important advantages over antibodies as they can be manipulated entirely. the chronic hepatitis infections are the most frequent cause of death through cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. some useful aptasensors hve recently been verified to detect viral hepatitis in clinic. thiocyanate (FITC) -conjugated RNA aptamer, HBs-A22, detects HBsAg that is expressed on the surface of infected HepG2.2.15 cells in fluorescence microscopy. the group selected specific single strand DNA aptamers by immobilizing HBsAg on the surface of carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles. fluorescent dye-conjugated aptamers appear to be valuable in various types of diagnostic assays. aptamers in the treatment of viral hepatitis include hypermutations and escaping of virouses from the host immune response. many treatment methods have been moderately effective. pha shows 50% efficiency in the infected cases(38,39) aptamers could be directed as potential promising tools against any protein in the infected cells and any components of viral particles. many researches established that the best therapeutic strategy is blocking of virus penetration routes into the host cells. viral genome translates into four overlapping open reading frames. core proteins (C), viral reverse DNA polymerase (P) and surface antigen (S) have been suitably subjected to the selection of aptamers. Aptamer against matrix binding domain (MBD) on the HBV capsid surface were designed by Orabi, et al. after 13 rounds of SELEX using the wild type (WT) capsids for positive selection and the I126A mutant capsids for counter selection AO-01 aptamer with the lowest Kd was selected against WT capsids. CV non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a desired target for aptamer therapeutics. the polymerase activity is a concentration-dependent manner. aptamer molecules were observed intracellularly using confocal microscopy, despite the absence of transfection agent. the helicase domain of HCV NS3 binds preferentially to the poly (U) sequence situated in the 3\u2019-untranslated region of the viral genome (3\u2019-UTR) under normal conditions. the helicase domain of HCV NS3 binds preferentially to the poly (U) sequence situated in the 3\u2019-untranslated region of the viral genome under normal conditions. aptamer AP30 targeted domain I of IRES in 3\u2019 end of the genome antisense strand. AP30 showed approximately 50% replication suppression via in vitro analysis. interferon response to viral infection remains inactive. aptamer 3-07 has positively operated by viral in vitro IRES-luciferase mRNA. a bout 10% depletion in the luciferase activity compared to control levels was detected. aptamer 3-07 aptamer demonstrated inhibition in luciferase activity up to 45%. aptamers are highly potent inhibitory molecules in Huh7.5.1 cells. HH363-24 also inhibited HCV RNA synthesis up to 70% in a subgenomic replicon system in the qRT-PCR assay. commercialization faces with some barriers affecting therapeutic potency in vivo(67). antibodies due to their large size (150 kD) and special recycling system circulate in the bloodstream with extended half-life. clearance of non-modified aptamer happen quickly from the blood, with a half-life of minutes to hours. but some tricks such aptamer conjugation via high molecular weight polymers can significantly enhance its half-life under physiological conditions. the chronic hepatitis infections are the most frequent cause of death through cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma(21,22,23). some useful aptasensors hve recently been verified to detect viral hepatitis in clinic. et al. selected specific single strand DNA aptamers by immobilizing HBsAg on the surface of carboxylated magnetic nanoparticles. three different aptamers with a same hairpin loop structure were successfully separated in vitro. a chemiluminescence aptasensor based on magnetic separation was constructed to indicate HBsAg in pure protein form or actual serum samples. the aptamers against HCV glycoprotein E2 was selected by Park, et al. in 2013. ELASA could be a proper method for evaluation of antiviral treatment. these findings might be important for the early detection of hepatitis C. three different aptamers with a same hairpin loop structure were successfully separated in vitro. a chemiluminescence aptasensor was constructed to indicate HBsAg in pure protein form or actual serum samples. the detection limit of H01 aptasensor was 0.1 ng/mL, which is five times lower than ELISA. aptamers against HCV glycoprotein E2 was selected by park, et al. in 2013. the fluorescent dye-conjugated aptamers seem to be valuable in various diagnostic assays. the aptamers could be modified to improve in vivo biostability and coupled with a variety of secondary therapeutic agents, including small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNAs) and ribozymes(44,45). the aptamers could be modified to improve in vivo biostability and coupled with a variety of secondary therapeutic agents. aptamer is anti-HBV replication, which interacted with viral polymerase with high affinity and competed a binding site of viral genetic material. the new aptamer, Apt.No.28, demonstrated a high affinity and inhibited the assembly of the nucleocapsid. it was suggested as a new targeting molecule to facilitate the strategy for targeted therapy of HBV-related diseases. hepatitis C virus Entry inhibitors are the most commonly studied therapeutic tools which prevent viral fusion with the target cell and penetration. hepatitis C virus Entry inhibitors are the most commonly studied therapeutic tools which prevent viral fusion with the target cell and penetration. rase activity positively illustrated the correlation between aptamer and inhibition of polymerase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. aptamer was selected against same enzyme that suppressed NS5B activity with competition the polymerase-binding site with the viral RNA template. NEO-35-s41 and G925-S50 aptamers showed highest synchronous reduction in both helicase and protease activity of NS3. these results were confirmed using an in vitro enzymatic and in vivo assay. internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence is well-conserved among HCV isolates because it is a potential attractive target for anti-HCV drugs. aptamers can recognize viral proteins, but also detect its nucleic acids. this aptamer has positively operated by viral in vitro IRES-dependent translation blockage. a bout 10% depletion in the luciferase activity compared to the control levels was detected. conjugated forms of two aptamers, named as 2-02 and 3-07, proved a 10 times decrease in binding affinity to the target sequence than the two parental aptamers. symptomatic therapy such as interferon- and nucleos(t)ide analogues (adefovir, lamivudine and entecavir) are usually prescribed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection(46), but their use is restricted by the severe side effects. aptamer, Apt.No.28, demonstrated a high affinity and inhibited the assembly of the nucleocapsid. this aptamer was suggested as a new targeting molecule to facilitate the strategy for targeted therapy of HBV-related diseases. protein was an important target for aptamer selection. it is a co-receptor of human CD81, displayed on hepatocytes and B lymphocytes. the reduction in HCV RNA levels and E2 protein concentrations after treatment were demonstrated by qRT-PCR. aptamer molecules were observed intracellularly using confocal microscopy. nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) showed helicase and protease activity. both domains of NS3 are essential for the replication of the flaviviridae family. nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a zinc-binding and proline-rich hydrophilic phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in RNA replication of HCV and its assembly. aptamers can recognize viral proteins, but also detect its nucleic acids. the binding of IRES to the small ribosomal subunit (40S) in the host cell showed approximately 50% replication suppression via in vitro analysis. two consensus sequences 5\u2019-UGGAUC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-GAGUAC-3\u2019 were completely bound to the SL-E1 and SL-D1 loops in the domain I. aptamers cleaved the HCV genome in 3\u2019 side and inhibited viral translation and replication simultaneously. HH363-24 have proved to be highly potent inhibitory molecules in Huh7.5.1 cells. aptamers possess several key advantages in comparison to antibodies. amer commercialization is serum endo- or exonucleases protection. various chemical modifications can be used into the nucleotide sugars or internucleotide phosphodiester linkages. these modifications decrease obviously aptamer degradation rate, which occur with in vivo nucleases. aptamers are widely supported by a single intellectual property portfolio. antibody technologies are currently applied broadly for lack of patent protection or expiration of intellectual property rights. aptamer commercialization is serum endo- or exonucleases protection. clinical trials of the limited number of aptamers are being conducted. but studies generally indicated moderate or low toxicity effects of aptamers. other investigations have represented some oligonucleotide conjugation partners such as PEG. pharmacokinetic properties."}
