{"summary": "emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have been recognized as one of the most significant public health problems. emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have been described as outbreaks of previously unknown diseases or previously recognized diseases. disease that have resurfaced after a decline in incidence are classified as re-emerging. this review will not focus on one or a select group of pathogens, but rather on the epidemiology of cattle zoonotic diseases. previous reports have documented the characteristics of zoonotic pathogens, such as life cycle, geographic location, method of infection, and symptoms. the human\u2013cattle Nexus Domestic cattle have played a central role in human society for centuries. they provide essential sources of meat, milk, other dairy products, fertilizer for crops, clothing, and animal traction. this role continues to be vital in the lives of the most economically challenged people. the us department of agriculture has projected an increase in the cattle industry over the next decade. the top five countries in terms of numbers of cattle, as well as dairy and meat production comprise more than half of the world's cattle commodity. Enhanced public health awareness and surveillance in these locations will be particularly important in decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with bovine zoonotic diseases. literature review A review of literature was conducted using the PubMed electronic database to identify clinical and epidemiological reports using key search words that included \u201cbovine\u201d and \u201czoonoses\u201d and one or more of the following terms\u2014\u201dseroprevalence,\u201d \u201cepidemiology,\u201d \u201ccase report,\u201d and \u201coccupational exposure\u201d. bovine zoonoses are evenly dispersed around the world, with the majority (69%) having a worldwide distribution. the breakdown of bovine zoonoses by taxonomy is shown in Figure 2. phology Baltimore Bioterrorism Emerging/Reemerging Status Disease(s) Current Geographic Distribution Case Report References Actinobacillus lignieresii Bacteria Gram+bacillus Arcanobacteriosis Worldwide Lynch et al. 1998, Reddy et al. 1997 Bacillus anthracis Bacteria Gram+bacillus III Anthrax Worldwide Cinquetti et al. 2009.

bovine zoonoses as emerging or re-emerging diseases of interest. the CDC pays particular attention to diseases that have the ability to be used as biological weapons based on their ability to create human disease and public fear. twenty-four (53%) of the recognized cattle zoonotic pathogens are on CDC's bioterrorism list. category A pathogens pose the greatest risk to national security. tsche et al. 2004, Davies 2006, de la Rua-Domenech 2006, de Kantor et al. 2008, Shrikrishna et al. 2009, Ingram et al. 2010, Torgerson and Torgerson 2010. both human and bovine cases confirmed or highly suspected to be a result of zoonotic transmission of M. caprae. most human infections occur after drinking or handling unpasteurized milk that is contaminated. atypical pneumonia, hepatitis, and endocarditis among the less common complications of Q fever that have been documented. zoonotic respiratory pathogens of bovine origin develop or have developed the ability to spread as easily as other known human respiratory pathogens. agricultural workers with a history of cattle exposure should include the traditional human pathogens as well as the following bovine zoonoses. contaminated cattle products have been well documented for a number of bacterial species, including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. altekruse et al. 1999, International Society for Infectious Diseases 2007e, International Society for Infectious Diseases 2008b, International Society for Infectious Diseases 2009b, International Society for Infectious Diseases 2009b, International Society for Infectious Diseases 2010d, International Society for Infectious Diseases 2010f, International Society for Infectious Diseases 2010f, International Society for Infectious Diseases 2011f, International Society for Infectious Diseases 2011b, International Society for unpasteurized milk and cheese consumption are associated with the majority of documented outbreaks. many people in both the united states and around the world preferentially consume these products. foodborne disease outbreaks are not restricted to developing countries. the CDC estimates that there are approximately 48 million cases of domestically acquired foodborne illness in the united states every year. zoonoses may originate from many animals (e.g., shellfish, pigs, poultry, cattle) the true contribution of bovine pathogens to the burden of foodborne illness is unknown. bovine zoonotic infections affecting the skin and underlying cutaneous tissues may have the longest history of recognition (Koch 1876) the most commonly reported agents include cutaneous anthrax and poxvirus lesions (cowpoxvirus and parapoxvirus) a number of unusual bacterial cutaneous infections were discovered involving Listeria spp. (Cain and McCann 1986, McLauchlin and Low 1994, Regan et al. 2005), Salmonella spp. (Lazarus et al. 2007), Staphylococcus aureus (Grinberg et al. 2004), and Streptococcus spp. (Tappe et al. 2004), as well as potentially emerging fun Strains accounting for a significant number of infections have origins unrelated to nosocomial strains. a third group has been identified in association with cattle, swine, horses, and poultry. there have been documented events of bovine-associated anthrax that have resulted in cases of neurological manifestations. a common-source outbreak producing two cases of meningoencephalitis and three cases of cutaneous anthrax associated with beef consumption. there is much that is still unknown surrounding the etiology of this disease. clinical disease in humans is acute and almost inevitably fatal without proper prophylaxis or postexposure vaccination. cattle are likely the most significant among domesticated livestock. close contact with infected animals is therefore the greatest risk factor for infection. the most serious cardiovascular presentations, due to the lack of treatment options, are caused by viral or parasitic zoonoses. these pathogens are regionally specific but are important considerations in endemic areas. the most serious cardiovascular presentations are caused by viral or parasitic zoonoses. human infections from leptospira spp. generally occur through contact with broken skin. ingestion of contaminated water or unpasteurized milk may also serve as routes of infection. brucellosis has been controlled in many countries that have strong animal disease control programs. crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is transmitted to humans by infected ticks or livestock. the first cases of crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever identified were a fatal infection in a child bitten by a tick. the ease of transmission and use of animal reservoirs and vectors complicate prevention strategies. bovine tuberculosis has been eliminated from developed countries with strong animal disease control programs. most human infections occur after drinking or handling unpasteurized milk that is contaminated. agricultural workers may become infected by inhaling bacteria that are aerosolized via coughing of infected cattle. bovine zoonotic respiratory infections causing influenza-like illness may be hampered due to a lack of specific diagnostics and the often-indistinguishable clinical presentation from common human respiratory agents. if zoonotic respiratory pathogens of bovine origin develop or have developed the ability to spread as easily as other known human respiratory pathogens, we may very well be underestimating the morbidity and mortality associated with these infections. us anthracis, Brucella spp., C. burnetti, Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycobacterium spp. are among the most common cattle zoonoses, in part because of their ubiquitous nature. outbreaks involving contaminated cattle products have been well documented for a number of bacterial species. a foodborne outbreak involving one of these pathogens is likely to originate from mishandling or inadequate preparation of meat or dairy products. recent studies have shown the presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and E. coli O157:H7 in inline filters and bulk tank milk samples across the united states. the CDC estimates that there are approximately 48 million cases of domestically acquired foodborne illness in the united states and around the world. foodborne disease outbreaks are not restricted to developing countries, because many of the documented cases occur in the United States or other countries with advanced public health networks. a number of unusual cases of nonfoodborne zoonotic transmission of B. anthracis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010), Campylobacter spp. (Gilpin et al. 2008), E. coli (Renwick et al. 1995), and Salmonella spp. (Hendriksen et al. 2007) have been confirmed. cutaneous bovine zoonotic infections affecting the skin and underlying cutaneous tissues may have the longest history of recognition (Koch 1876) most commonly reported agents include cutaneous anthrax and poxvirus lesions (cowpoxvirus and parapoxvirus) a number of unusual bacterial cutaneous infections were discovered involving Listeria spp. (Cain and McCann 1986, McLauchlin and Low 1994, Regan et al.

significant number of infections have origins unrelated to nosocomial strains. nursing home residents, prisoners, athletes, children, and intravenous drug users are groups commonly associated with community-acquired strains of MRSA. c E. coli, leptospira spp., and Borrelia burgdorferi can affect the central nervous system in severe manifestations of neuropathies, meningitis, or encephalitis. there have been documented events of bovine-associated anthrax that have resulted in cases of neurological manifestations. a common-source outbreak producing two cases of meningoencephalitis and three cases of cutaneous anthrax associated with beef consumption. clinical disease in humans is acute and almost inevitably fatal without proper prophylaxis or postexposure vaccination. canine species and bats are the most important vectors of zoonotic transmission to humans. cattle are likely the most significant among domesticated livestock. the most serious cardiovascular presentations are caused by viral or parasitic zoonoses. these pathogens are regionally specific but are important considerations in endemic areas. most serious cardiovascular presentations are caused by viral or parasitic zoonoses. spp. generally occur through contact with broken skin during exposures. ingestion of contaminated water or unpasteurized milk may also serve as routes of infection. brucellosis has been controlled in many countries that have strong animal disease control programs. crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is transmitted to humans by infected ticks or livestock. the virus is acquired through handling of infected animals or exposure to mosquito vectors in connection with enzootic or epizootic infections of livestock. despite advanced public health systems in the developed world, each of the seven geographic regions studied revealed virtually an equal presence of cattle zoonotic pathogens. this is likely a result of a combination of factors: first, the universal presence of cattle around the world coupled with their movement between livestock farms, markets, and abattoirs presents the opportunity for pathogens to adapt to new environments. 80% contained an RNA genome and represented all of the emerging viral zoonoses. this may be best explained by the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, aiding in rapid adaptation to new environments. the CDC and NIAID have listed half of all bovine zoonotic pathogens as both biological weapons (52%) and as potential emerging pathogens (50%). the number of cattle is projected to continue to increase worldwide, thus the role and impact cattle play on the future of public health will likely remain compelling."}
