{"summary": "the use of genomic data in bacterial food-borne outbreaks has been associated with a faster determination of source and fewer persons associated with each outbreak. the use of genomic data in bacterial food-borne outbreaks has been associated with a faster determination of source and fewer persons associated with each outbreak. privacy concerns for infectious pathogen genomic data and metadata are less than those associated with human genomic data. the ability to impute human relations via pathogen genomic data and phylodynamics also raises serious privacy concerns as to what constitutes protected health information (PHI) under the Safe Harbor method, such identifiers may be included in released metadata if a qualified expert statistician deems them non-identifiable. the IRB may grant permission for release of identifying metadata if direct patient consent is obtained to release such information. sample collection date and location are not explicitly named in the 18 protected heath identifiers. however, dates associated with patient care such as admission date and discharge date at finer resolution than the year are considered patient identifiers. clinical laboratory medicine service covers 63,000 inpatient admissions, 200,000 emergency room visits, and 1.6 million outpatient visits each year. the combined enterprise covers 63,000 inpatient admissions, 200,000 emergency room visits, and 1.6 million outpatient visits each year. we attempted to restrict our analysis to clinical microbiology testing for which a positive result was obtained. data were then quality-controlled by removing all entries that had empty or nonsensical values for any of the kept metadata. chart review of select outliers revealed that the above criteria were highly likely to be associated with reference lab testing. we also removed all reference lab testing due to inability to confidently assign admission dates to samples sent from outside hospitals. 2.1 Clinical testing dataset The University of Washington (UW) Laboratory Medicine Department covers 63,000 inpatient admissions, 200,000 emergency room visits, and 1.6 million outpatient visits each year. the combined enterprise covers 63,000 inpatient admissions, 200,000 emergency room visits, and 1.6 million outpatient visits each year. sample accession number collapsed multiple clinical tests from a single sample into one test but did not collapse data by patient. if a patient had one sample taken on Day 1 for two viral tests then another sample was collected the next day for three bacterial tests. the data were then quality-controlled by removing all entries that had empty or nonsensical values for any of the kept metadata. results Information from a total of 286,150 samples was analyzed from microbiological testing at the UW laboratory medicine department from 2010 to 2017. of these, 14,381 samples (5.0%) were removed due to staff testing, computer records testing, and conflicting admission/discharge/collection dates. ED samples accounted for 32,161 (11.8%) of all samples, inpatient for 95,188 (35.0%) and outpatient for 144,420 (53.1%) for 99.9% of samples the collection date was within half a year of the admission date, far greater than the year resolution defined under Safe Harbor method of de-identification. more than 97% of samples were collected within 1 month of the patient admission date. positive microbiological tests had a collection date that was within 1 day of a patient\u2019s admission date 78.8% of the time. collection dates were more strongly correlated with admission dates than for positive bacterial or fungal cultures. virology test coding did not permit ready identification of only positive test results. we extracted 16,434 unique samples for which the test results field either contained \u2018positive\u2019 or a quantity. 99.7% of outpatient samples and 99.5% of ED samples were collected within 1 day of admission date. most of the microbiological testing for inpatients in which admission date and collection date matched was ordered from the ED. ICU had the lowest percent of admission dates being within 1 day of collection. OB/Gyn had the largest percent of collection dates dmission dates being within 1 day of collection at 65.13%. cumulative distribution of days separating collection date and admission date differed significantly between OB/Gyn and each of the other services. sample collection dates associated with microbiological testing at a large tertiary hospital are highly correlated with patient admission date. the average length of stay is 1 week in most hospitals that send clinical specimens to our clinical laboratory. the average length of stay is 1 week in most of the hospitals that send clinical specimens to our clinical laboratory. genome data obtained for detection of antimicrobial resistance can also be used for public health measures and infection prevention. the emergence of these data creates a pressure for clinical laboratories to share sample metadata. the emergence of these data creates a demand for community guidance as to the manner in which such clinical metadata can appropriately be shared. the degree of identifiability of a given patient or case can be fundamentally unknowable. the degree of identifiability of a given patient or case can be fundamentally unknowable, especially when there exists a continuum of other metadata sources. we did not attempt to use this information to identify actual individuals in this study. we did not take into account reference laboratory testing due to inability to confidently ascertain admission dates from outside hospitals. most recent phylodynamic analysis has been performed outside the u.s.
