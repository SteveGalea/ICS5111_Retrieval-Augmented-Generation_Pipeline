{"summary": "oligonucleotides were selected to represent all viral taxa containing at least one virus known to infect vertebrates. oligonucleotides were selected to represent all viral taxa containing at least one virus known to infect vertebrates. oligonucleotide mutant sequences were retained if sequences diverged by more than 90%. the highest probe coverage was evident in divergent genome regions (e.g., yellow fever virus E region; approximately position 1000 to 2500) the highest probe coverage was evident in divergent genome regions (e.g., yellow fever virus E gene region; approximately position 1000 to 2500) the probe library included oligonucleotides that selectively hybridize to genomes of vertebrate viruses but not to those of bacteriophages or plant or fungal viruses. seq-VERT resulted in a 100- to 1,000-fold increase in on-target (viral) reads and a reduction of host background reads from 99.7% to 68.2% in lung and from 99.4% to 38.5% in blood. average coverage increased dramatically, with nearly full-length sequences (>95%) being obtained for all viruses. VirCapSeq-VERT enhances the performance of high-throughput sequencing by increasing the number of mapped viral reads. eight different viral NAs were quantitated by qPCR and used to spike a background of lung-derived (3 viruses) or blood-derived (5 viruses) NA extracts.

VirCapSeq-VERT selectively enriched RHVpl-01 sequence in conserved regions encoding the helicase and polymerase genes. rotavirus and hepacivirus experiments showed the presence of probes with up to 90% nucleotide identity in the VirCapSeq-VERT probe pool.

NA from cell culture or blood, serum, or tissue samples was extracted using the easyMAG system. background NA was quantitated by nanoDrop or Bioanalyzer 2100. clinical samples included a human nasal swab sample known to be positive for EV-D68 (30), liver specimens from deer mice infected with deer mouse hepacivirus (31) and serum samples from hemophilia patients coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), GB virus C (GBV-C), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and torque teno virus (TTV) a library of 1,993,200 oligonucleotide probes was selected. the cleavable array platform was employed for synthesis of the biotinylated, soluble probe library. probe sequences were refined by adjusting lengths to conform to NimbleGen synthesis parameters, such as maximum Tm or homopolymer repeat length. depletion of nondesired host mRNA sequences was achieved using RiboZero magnetic kits. total NA extracts were reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Thermo, Fisher) with random hexamers. cDNA/DNA mix was sheared to an average fragment size of 200 bp using the manufacturer\u2019s standard settings. libraries were then mixed with a SeqCap HE universal oligonucleotide, SeqCap HE index oligonucleotides, and COT DNA and vacuum evaporated at 60\u00b0C for approximately 40 min. sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) resulted in an average of 210 million reads per lane. samples were demultiplexed using Illumina software, and FastQ files were generated. filtered reads were aligned against the host reference databases.
