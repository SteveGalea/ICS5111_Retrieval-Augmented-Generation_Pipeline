{"summary": "the effectiveness of quarantine at the borders of islands was modelled as the relative reduction of the risk of releasing infectious individuals into the community. if rapid diagnostic testing is combined with quarantine, the lengths of quarantine could be shortened to 2.6 and 5.7 days, respectively. a systematic review has reported evidence that interventions that included quarantine (2 studies) and isolation (10 studies) were effective in containing respiratory virus epidemics. some Pacific island nations have included the option of border quarantine in their current influenza pandemic plans. study aimed to assess the potential effectiveness of quarantine. suggests an optimal length, and examine its potential performance. we consider a situation when the disease-free country is fortunate enough to be informed about the possible emergence of influenza. we consider the effectiveness of quarantine as the reduction of the risk of introducing \"infectious\" individuals into the community. we assume that quarantine security would be fully effective and that no secondary transmission would occur in the quarantine facility. a single symptomatic case and an asymptomatic case are 2.0 and 1.0 respectively. the basic reproduction number, R0, is therefore Rs+(1-)Ra = 1.67. this corresponds to an estimate in a previous study [24]. we argue the quarantine period as if all infected incoming individuals experienced this infection upon arrival. a more realistic scenario requires the exact time of infection for all incoming infected individuals. r1(t) and r0(t) are the risks of releasing infected individuals into a new community. the probability of release, r1a(t) is r1s(t) = (1 - F(t))(1 - G(t)) (2) where F(t) and G(t) are respectively the cumulative distributions of the incubation period and generation time. we assume independence between the incubation period and generation time, which most likely yields conservative estimates of the effectiveness. we assume that the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the rapid diagnostic test are 69.0% and 99.0% respectively. the risk of releasing infectious individuals in the presence of quarantine is obtained by multiplying a factor (1-Se) to r1(t) which represents a proportion of cases that are missed even following rapid diagnostic testing. we examined plausible prevalence levels of 1%, 5% and 10% at the source. the highest prevalence, 10%, may represent transmission events within an airport of the country of origin or on an aircraft. fraction (1-p)(1-Sp) and (1-p)Sp will be testing positive (false positives) and negative (true negatives), respectively, to the rapid diagnostic test. r1(t) is the probability of releasing infectious individuals following the quarantine of length t days. PPV measures the preventive performance of quarantine policy to correctly place infected individuals in quarantine (or isolation) during their infectious period. we numerically computed both PPV and NPV for different prevalence levels (from 0\u201315%) and different lengths of quarantine (from 0 to 10 days) the island nation still permits the arrival of 20 aircraft with a total of 8000 incoming individuals. we assume that all incoming individuals are placed into routine quarantine on arrival in the island nation. the impact of imperfect detection on the effectiveness of quarantine is examined in the Appendix. 99th percentile point as the quarantine period could ensure the absence of symptomatic infection with probability of 95% or 99%. the conditional probability of developing symptomatic disease (given infection) has been suggested to be 66.7% [22,23], and detection through quarantine is not relevant for asymptomatic infected individuals who account for the remaining 33.3%. asymptomatic infected individuals account for the remaining 33.3%. the generation time was retrieved from a previous study of volunteers infected with influenza [22], which assumed that infectiousness is proportional to viral shedding. a lognormal distribution was employed to model the generation time. we favoured the use of this dataset as it would give a more conservative result. r1(t) is regarded as the risk of releasing \"symptomatic infected\" individuals. the proportion 100(1-) is as large as 33.3%. the risk r1(t) is the probability of releasing \"infectious\" individuals into the community. we assume that the length of generation time among asymptomatic individuals is identical to that among symptomatic cases. the effectiveness of quarantine, (t), is given by subtracting r1s(t) and r1a(t) from 1: i.e., (t) = 1 - [(1 - F(t))(1 - G(t)) + (1 - ) (1 - - G(t)]. sensitivity was assessed using the number of released infectious individuals after quarantine of length t. the highest prevalence, 10%, may represent transmission events within an airport of the country of origin or on an aircraft. random sampling was performed for the number of infected individuals (80, 400 and 800 times) in each simulation. the simulation was run 100 times for each length of quarantine and prevalence level. fractions (1-p)(1-Sp) and (1-p)Sp will be testing positive (false positives) and negative (true negatives), respectively, to the rapid diagnostic test. r1(t) is the probability of releasing infectious individuals following the quarantine of length t days. we numerically computed both PPV and NPV for different prevalence levels (from 0\u201315%) and different lengths of quarantine (from 0 to 10 days) all analyses were made using the statistical software JMP ver. 7.0. the incubation period alone suggests that 95% effectiveness in preventing release of symptomatic infected individuals is achieved by quarantine of 2.73 days. the dashed line represents the effectiveness of quarantine, measured as the relative reduction of the risk of releasing \"symptomatic infected\" individuals. the quarantine for 2.8 days could miss 11 (5\u201316), 56 (45\u201368) and 114 (92\u2013129) infectious cases for the prevalence of 1%, 5% and 10% respectively in the 8000 arriving travellers considered. however, these misses were reduced to 4 (1\u20137), 20 (13\u201327) and 39 (28\u201353) cases by the quarantine of length 4.8 days, to 3 (0\u20135), 13 (7\u201319) and 27 (16\u201336) by 5.7 days. each dot represents median estimate of 100 simulation runs. the whiskers extend out to 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulations. no secondary transmission was observed in the community in several scenarios. the whiskers extend out to 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulations. PPV and NPV of quarantine combined with rapid diagnostic testing were functions of the length of quarantine and prevalence of influenza at the source. PPV is less sensitive to the length of quarantine and prevalence at the source. NPV is sensitive to both the length of quarantine and prevalence at the source. the incubation period was similar to those reported previously. the incubation period alone suggests that 95% effectiveness in preventing release of symptomatic infected individuals is achieved by quarantine of 2.73 days. the dashed line represents the effectiveness of quarantine, measured as the relative reduction of the risk of releasing \"symptomatic infected\" individuals. sensitivity of the rapid diagnostic test was assumed to be 69.0%. the shortest length, 2.8 days, was suggested by the incubation period as 95% effective in preventing release of infectious individuals by means of quarantine alone. 5.7 days corresponded to 95% and 99% effectiveness in preventing release of infectious individuals by means of quarantine alone. the quarantine for 2.8 days could miss as many as 11 (5\u201316), 56 (45\u201368) and 114 (92\u2013129) infectious cases for the prevalence of 1%, 5% and 10% respectively. each dot represents median estimate of 100 simulation runs. the whiskers extend out to 5th and 95th percentiles of the simulations. no secondary transmission was observed in the community in several scenarios. PPV and NPV of quarantine combined with rapid diagnostic testing functions of the length of quarantine and prevalence of influenza at the source. NPV was on the whole very high and sensitive to both the length of quarantine and prevalence at the source. positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of quarantine combined with rapid diagnostic testing are functions of the length of quarantine and prevalence at the source. PPV is sensitive to both the length of quarantine and prevalence at the source, achieving extremely high estimates to correctly release true negative individuals into the community. 95th percentiles of the incubation period for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and smallpox were suggested to be 11\u201313 days [19,21] and 16\u201317 days [16] since exposure. direct application of this concept to pandemic influenza suggests that the optimal quarantine period for pandemic influenza is only 2.73 days since exposure, which is far shorter than those for SARS and smallpox. a test with both high sensitivity and high specificity would also allow for better use of resources if the travellers who tested negative are released into the community. the effectiveness of quarantine itself is independent of the prevalence, and moreover, lower prevalence among incoming individuals yield a higher chance of extinction. pandemic pandemic plan also includes border quarantine. small countries with land borders and limited entry points could also use these approaches to delay entry of pandemic influenza. some island states may have access to laboratory-based PCR influenza tests. this could offer the test results in a few hours and greatly shorten the length of quarantine. the first is concerned with skewness of the offspring distribution. estimates of the effectiveness of imperfect quarantine would be far more complicated than our simpler model. substantial reductions of travel volumes could make the logistics of quarantine far more feasible for island nations. there is potential usefulness of antiviral prophylaxis during the quarantine period which could theoretically reduce the number of infectious individuals. despite our simplifying assumptions, the present study reasonably suggests that use of quarantine has the potential to substantially reduce the risk of pandemic influenza arriving or at least significantly delay arrival, in small island nations. the effectiveness was modelled as a relative reduction of the risk of introducing infectious individuals as a function of time since arrival. i(t, ) and j(), respectively, be the number of infected individuals at quarantine period t and infection-age and the number of infected individuals at infection-age at the beginning of quarantine t = 0. the density function of the incubation period, f(), is given by f() = ()() (A3) Since there is no secondary transmission during quarantine period, i(t, ) = 0 for t- > 0. The number all quarantined individuals have not experienced symptom onset before quarantine starts at t = 0. the total number of infected individuals satisfies 0 n ( t ) d t = 0 j ( ) d (A6). the density of symptom onset at quarantine period t depends on the infection-age. j() = Q(), leading to h ( t ) = ( t ) 0 ( ) d (A8) which is equivalent to the survivorship of the infected individuals. the simplification in (A8) holds only when a stationary state is the case at the source country, which is not likely to be observed in the event of an influenza pandemic. sensitivity of (t) is calculated as 100 % (i.e. = 0.95 and 0.99) to different ratios of Ga(t) to Gs(t) c is assumed to be equivalent to Gs(t) in the main text. when c is smaller than 1, the effectiveness rises up close to 100% with the assumed lengths of quarantine. the ratio Se, a to Se, s (r := Se, a/Se, s) is smaller than 1. The equation (5) in the main text is replaced by d(t) = 1- [(1 - Se, s) (1 - F(t))(1 - G(t)) + (1 - Se, a) (1 - )(1 - G(t))] (A10) Figure 7C shows the sensitivity of d the difference in (t) between different ratios k is particularly highlighted when the quarantine period is between 2 and 5 days. in the main text, we estimated that quarantine for 8.62 days achieves 99.0% effectiveness of reducing the risk of releasing infectious individuals into the community with k = 1.0. the density function of the incubation period, f(), is given by f() = ()() (A3) Since we assume that there is no secondary transmission during quarantine period, i(t, ) = 0 for t- > 0. The number of new symptomatic cases at quarantine of length t, n(t), is n ( t ) = t ( t ) i ( t ) d (A4), we get n ( the density of symptom onset at quarantine period t always depends on the infection-age distribution (which is informed by j()) at the starting time point of quarantine (t = 0) the density of symptom onset h(t) always depends on the infection-age distribution (which is informed by j()) t = 0 is the time of infection, which is the worst case scenario. we consider the impact of differing generation times between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. the equation (4) in the main text is replaced by (t) = 1. the ratio Se, a to Se, s (r := Se, a/Se, s) is smaller than 1. the equation (5) in the main text is replaced by d(t) = 1-. we estimated that 99.0% effectiveness in reducing the risk of introducing infectious individuals is achieved with t = 5.71 days using the rapid diagnostic test of r = 1.0 in the main text. the effectiveness estimate with the same length of quarantine and r = 0.6 is still as large as 98.1%. the same length of quarantine and k = 0.6 is still as large as 98.2%. the same length of quarantine is still as large as 98.2%."}
