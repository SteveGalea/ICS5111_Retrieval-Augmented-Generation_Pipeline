{"summary": "the impact of CHIKF in terms of burden of disease, work and school absenteeism is particularly high, especially given its formidable epidemic potential. the global impact of CHIKV is constantly growing due to the introduction and spread of the virus into new continents. cases of meningoencephalitis have been documented, especially during Indian outbreaks [1], and fatal encephalitis has been reported with CHIKV infection both in Italy [8] and in la Reunion. persistent arthralgia and joint swelling are common long-term manifestations of CHIKV. 84 confirmed cases (57%) self-reported rheumatic symptoms. of these, 63% reported permanent pain, whereas 37% had recurrent symptoms. an age of over 45 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.9) was independent predictors of nonrecovery. a total of about 40 million cases in the Americas, with a burden of 24 million disability life years (DALYs) lost and about US$185 billion in societal cost. the under-recognition of the potential impact of CHIKF led to undesired political consequences during the epidemic waves. several inactivated and attenuated vaccine candidates and newer platforms have been tested in preclinical and human trials. most development of these vaccines was discontinued decades ago because of high-production costs and risks associated with handling large quantities of virulent, wild-type, virus prior to inactivation. a single dose of the CHIKF vaccine elicits robust neutralizing antibody responses and protects mice and NHPs against virulent CHIKV challenge. the nsP3 deletion vaccine, 5nsP3 (VLA1553), is now in the recruitment stage for a Phase 1 clinical trial. CHIKF vaccines in late preclinical or clinical development. Vaccine name Developer Vaccine type Doses required/tested Current stage of testing (clinicaltrials.gov identifier) promoter replaced by internal ribosome entry site to down-regulate structural proteins and prevent mosquito infection 1 Late preclinical (immunogenicity and efficacy in mice, NHPs) CHIKF vaccine in advanced stages of clinical development employs an attenuated measles virus strain as a vector to express the CHIKV structural proteins. a single dose of a replication-deficient vaccine protects mice and NHPs from all measures of disease and viremia. this remarkable immunogenicity (single dose of a replication-defective vaccine) is mediated, at least in part, but the normal endocytic pathway of the vaccine particles. virus-like particles (VLPs) have also been developed and advanced to clinical trials. only four of these candidates have entered Phase 1 or 2 trials [51\u201353] (Table 1). Whether any of these candidates will advance to Phase 3 trials cannot be easily predicted. barriers to the acquisition of human efficacy data for vaccine candidates may delay the development of a vaccine, even though promising candidates are available. vaccine trials should be designed very carefully to implement quickly and maximize their results during outbreaks. potential opportunities for CHIKF vaccine testing may include cities with histories of recurrent dengue outbreaks (dengue and CHIKV share same human-amplified transmission cycles) if human antibodies against CHIKV develop from individuals vaccinated in phase 1 and 2 trials are transferred to NHPs. this could provide surrogate evidence of vaccine efficacy, leading to a provisional license. the lack of compete understanding of chronic arthritis could limit the value of preclinical CHIKF vaccine testing. a recent example is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), funded by both government entities and private foundations. most development of these vaccines was discontinued decades ago because of high-production costs and risks associated with handling large quantities of virulent, wild-type, virus prior to inactivation. most subsequent vaccine research was directed towards live-attenuated candidates. the first of these rationally attenuated CHIKF vaccines to undergo extensive preclinical testing used a picornavirus-derived internal ribosome entry site to replace the CHIKV subgenomic promoter [41] a single dose of the vaccine elicits robust neutralizing antibody responses and protects mice and NHPs against virulent CHIKV challenge.

CHIKF vaccine in advanced stages of clinical development employs an attenuated measles virus strain as a vector to express the CHIKV structural proteins. a booster raised seroconversion to 100%, and immunogenicity was not affected by preexisting anti-measles immunity. this vaccine is now in Phase 2 trials (Table 1). a single dose of a replication-deficient vaccine is mediated, at least in part, but the normal endocytic pathway of the vaccine particles, which are structurally identical to wild-type CHIKV. virus-like particles (VLPs) have also been developed and advanced to clinical trials. CHIKF outbreak control is hampered by lack of licensed vaccines that can be used in preventive immunization programs and for emergency response. randomized controlled trials may not be feasible during interepidemics periods because of the low expected number of cases. vaccine trials should be designed very carefully to implement quickly and maximize their results during outbreaks. potential opportunities for CHIKF vaccine testing may include cities with histories of recurrent dengue outbreaks. however, ethical concerns with placebo-immunizing populations during an epidemic may need to be overcome with nontraditional designs. if human antibodies against CHIKV develop from individuals vaccinated in phase 1 and 2 trials are transferred to NHPs. this could provide surrogate evidence of vaccine-induced protection. lack of compete understanding of chronic arthritis could limit the value of preclinical CHIKF vaccine testing. the burden of disease caused by CHIKV is very high due to the expanding geographic range of virus activity, increasing numbers of cases worldwide, and to the severe and long-lasting arthralgic sequelae of the disease. barriers to traditional vaccine development and licensure need to be overcome by investing appropriate resources. chikungunya vaccine is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, first-in-man trial. chikungunya virus-like particle vaccine in healthy adults: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial. promising vaccine candidates are currently in Phase 1 and/or 2 clinical trials. public and/or private partnerships are needed to incentivize and accelerate vaccine R&D and licensure. lecuit M.
