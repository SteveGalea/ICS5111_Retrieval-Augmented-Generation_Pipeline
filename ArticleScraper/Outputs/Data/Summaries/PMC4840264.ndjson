{"summary": "atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease mainly associated with uncontrolled complement activation leading to endothelial cell damage. the most frequent manifestation of aHUS is kidney damage, but cardiac complications occur in up to 10% of patients due to the systemic nature of TMA. the most common cause would be Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) however, the rarer atypical form of HUS and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) should also be considered. patient had low C3 levels (79 mg/dL) and a positive complement haemolysis (CH50) test. testing for cobalamin C deficiency, an important differential diagnosis in children, was not available at the time. the patient improved in the first month, with diuresis increasing to 1500 mL/day. but the diuresis soon decreased to 300 mL/day and blood pressure suddenly increased to 180/120 mm Hg. on day 39, blood pressure suddenly increased to 180/120 mm Hg and Hb decreased. eGFR was not measured until 50 weeks after presentation as the patient was anuric. eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate, LDH, lactate dehydrogenase, PE/PI, plasma exchange/plasma infusion were within or near normal ranges. patients with aHUS rapidly develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within the first year after presentation if the TMA process is not rapidly inhibited. it is unclear if a patient already in ESRD for several months has any possibility of renal recovery. eculizumab increased by a mean of 6 mL/min/1.73 m2 after 6 months of eculizumab treatment. renal function in our patient has not normalised, but eGFR improved to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 after 35 months. eculizumab also improved the patient's critical hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy. aHUS occurred due to a complement activating condition (vaccination) and multiple genetic risk factors (mutation and polymorphisms) in CFH. the position of the CFH mutation (1218) is important for binding to C3. eculizumab treatment enabled a patient with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome to discontinue dialysis. despite clinical evidence of neither thrombocytopenia nor haemolysis, extrarenal manifestations progressed over time. despite clinical evidence of neither thrombocytopenia nor haemolysis, extrarenal manifestations progressed over time. complications of aHUS may progress despite no overt thrombocytopenia or haemolysis. eculizumab led to improvement in the function of the kidneys and other organs."}
