{"summary": "traditional medicine is being included in the current updates to the ICD. in 2010, the third edition of the Korean classification of diseases of Oriental Medicine (KCDOM3) was incorporated into the Korean modification of the ICD-10, or KCD 6 using U codes (U00\u2013U99) KCDOM eliminated the overlapping disease classifications between the previous KCDOM and KCD5 and reorganized the remaining disorders and patterns into U codes. this reduced duplicate coding and allowed pattern identification and diagnosis through Korean medicine. one approach towards better health care is quantification of the burden of disease [6] composite indicator disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is being used throughout diverse academic research as a summary measure of the overall burden of disease. the burden of different diseases and risk factors have been analyzed in Korea using nationally representative big data. previous studies have not included the portion of health care utilization classified under the U codes when calculating the burden of diseases by disability and death causes. Korean medicine disorders (U20\u2013U33), Korean medicine patterns (U50\u2013U79) and four constitution medicine patterns (U95\u2013U98) the disorders and patterns in the U codes do not correspond directly to disease names in the KCD. NHIS-NSC data provide information on the utilization of healthcare based on the N. NHIS-NSC of 2012 includes data for 1 million patients. the main disease and subdisease codes were collected for outpatients of Korean medicine clinics from the 2012 NHIS-NSC data. the primary goal was to use the data from the U code visits that also had subdisease codes in 2012 to the remaining visits with only U codes as main disease codes and without any subdisease codes. subdisease codes can be used for diseases other than the main disease in many cases. only subdisease codes that were relevant to the main disease codes were selected by doctors of Korean medicine. the final decision was based on agreement of trained KMD doctors. proportion within the total 151,967 visits that was only coded by U code was converted into a proportion within the total frequency of corresponding KCD 6 codes in the year 2012. this process was designed under the assumption that the diseases in the KCD 6 codes followed a normal distribution. however, when the morbidity of the disease is too low, this process could stretch the proportion over the actual morbidity. the data were analyzed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute) and visualized using Python. the data were analyzed using a data-based approach. brightness disease pattern/syndrome 6 Lesser yang disease pattern/syndrome 6 Greater yin disease pattern/syndrome 3 Lesser yin disease pattern/syndrome 10 Reverting yin disease pattern/syndrome 6 U58 Disease pattern/syndrome of defense-qi-nutrient-blood 9 U59 Disease pattern/syndrome of qi-blood-yin-yang-fluid-humor 30 Disease NHIS-NSC data provide information on the utilization of healthcare based on the NHI claims from medical institutions to the NHIS from inpatient and outpatient clinic visits for each individual patient. main disease and subdisease codes were collected for outpatients of Korean medicine clinics from the 2012 NHIS-NSC data. a reorganizing process was conducted before the redistribution of the main disease U codes to subdisease KCD 6 codes. only subdisease codes relevant to the main disease codes were selected by doctors of Korean medicine. the final decision was based on agreement of trained KMD doctors. inter-U code proportion = Frequency of KCD 6 sub disease code Total frequency of the corresponding U code. each of these proportions was expanded and converted into the proportion within the total 151,967 visits that was only coded by U code. this proportion within the missed data was converted into a proportion within the total frequency of corresponding KCD 6 codes in 2012. the data were analyzed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute), and the data were visualized using Python. the primary goal was to use the data from the U code visits that also had subdisease codes in 2012 to the remaining visits with only U codes as main disease codes and without any subdisease codes. only subdisease codes that were relevant to the main U codes were selected by doctors of Korean medicine. for example, in the case of U303 (neck stiffness), the codes that were not directly related to pain or abnormal sensation of the neck were removed. this process was based on consultation with medical professionals and professors and researchers at the College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University. this process was conducted for each of the KCD 6 codes in the subdisease codes in the U code data: U code Proportion = U code-KCD 6 expected frequency Total frequency of the corresponding KCD 6 code. however, when the morbidity of the disease is too low, this process could stretch the proportion over the actual morbidity. the remaining 151,967 visits had only U codes as the main disease codes, without any subdisease codes. the remaining 151,967 visits had only U codes as the main disease codes, without any subdisease codes. rome 186 U204 Consumptive disease 173 The most commonly reported U code was U303. the most commonly reported U code was related to musculoskeletal diseases (M codes), followed by diseases of the nervous system (G codes) the U code proportions ranged from 1% to approximately 20% of the burden of disease for each KCD 6 code. there were few high proportions for each of the U codes.

U codes that did not show a relationship with musculoskeletal diseases were U280 (food accumulation), U332 (night crying), U600 (qi deficiency pattern/syndrome), and U680 (pattern/syndrome of spleen qi deficiency) two major U codes showed strong relationships with diseases of the nervous system (G codes) and diseases of the digestive system (K codes) there were two major U codes that had strong relationships with mental disorders (F codes) i deficiency 717 U301 Painful impediment 551 U305 Crane-knee arthritis 488 U304 Joint-running wind 480 U241 Insensitivity 462 U651 Pattern/syndrome of liver qi depression 458 U306 Muscle cramp 411 U236 Tremor 392 U221 Depression, melancholy, and depressive syndrome 326 U302 Fixed impediment 325 U650 Pattern/syndrome of ascend the proportions of the U codes to the KCD 6 codes were fairly evenly distributed following the redistribution. the proportions ranged from 1% to approximately 20% of the burden of disease for each KCD 6 code. 9% 16.91% 11.08% 14.29% 2.96% 21.85% 7.75% 10.13% 9.37% M501 M797 M624 20.54% 7.90% 9.37% U240 M179 M626 M759 M758 M541 M538 M175 M171 F453 11.58% 8.49% 5.17% 6.85% 77.35% 7.55% 20.38% 2.70% 10.58% U234 M545 G518 G510 M179 M796 K318 G438 G430 G439 F982 K590 5.06% 6.78% 9.77% 11.10% 8.41% 2.57% 1.80% 3.91% U680 K30 J310 L80 L208 G442 G700 G470 M542 G439 H521 K522 N944 N959 G245 J300 1.89% 6.53% 5.40% 11.96% 2.77% 17.54% 2.71% 0.25% 1.53% 1.49% 5.43% 0.51% U651 M626 M791 G430 M759 M545 M544 M758 F453 G440 M751 G442 M255 F454 F411 F410 1.06% 0.36% 15.46% 0.45% 0.06% 0.19% 0.72% 2.91% 3.35% 1.30% 1.11% 0.22% 0.50% 3.44% 4.92% G438 M624 M750 1.05% 1.01% 0.11% U306 M5 3.76% 0.05% 4.09% 1.21% 1.67% 0.88% 0.32% 0.65% M235 M542 0.51% 0.03% U650 M545 M791 M626 M171 M544 G438 G439 G519 F502 M542 M796 M255 M549 0.21% 0.35% 0.35% 0.97% 0.14% 0.49% 0.60% 0.61% 8.57% 0.06% 0.08% 0.05% 0.21% 332 K30 F982 L211 2.10% 1.20% 6.67% U260 K219 M626 M624 13.19% 0.58% 3.33% U600 F500 K30 K590 5.17% 0.72% 6.42% U204 M545 M750 M759 M796 M170 M544 M626 M255 M772 0.09% 0.67% 0.36% 0.42% 0.85% 0.09% 0.08% 0.09% 0.94% Values are reported hwa-byung has strong psychosomatic symptoms rather than direct mental symptoms. this is the first study to incorporate U codes into the calculation of the burden of disease in Korea. many of the U codes were redistributed within KCD 6 classifications for musculoskeletal diseases. the utilization of Western medicine and Korean medicine did not drastically change over the years. Approximately 30% of patients with musculoskeletal diseases visit Korean medical clinics for treatments such as musculoskeletal diseases. the results of the present study should be understood within the current Korean medicine healthcare utilization, as part of the official health care system. this data-driven approach provides a new perspective in understanding and explaining disorders and patterns in Korean medicine, or within the larger scope of traditional medicine, via the disease classification system in Western medicine [27]. this study analyzed the burden of disease from U codes in the year 2012 using NHIS-NSC data. this data visualization showed that musculoskeletal diseases accounted for a large part of Korean medicine utilization. authors declared there is no conflict of interests regarding publication of this paper."}
