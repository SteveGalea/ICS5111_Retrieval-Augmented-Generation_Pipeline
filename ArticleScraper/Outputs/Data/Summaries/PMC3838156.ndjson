{"summary": "the type I interferon pathway plays a crucial role in mediating the antiviral response through induction of a diverse set of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1). the receptors of the host cell recognize viral-pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are usually viral nucleic acids (single-stranded RNA], double-stranded RNA [dsRNA], and single-stranded DNA [ssDNA]) us3 is also reported to masquerade as the cellular kinase Akt to phosphorylate tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), leading to constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and inhibition of the translational repressor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and enhancing viral gene expression. UL36USP was proven to counteract IFN- production by deubiquitinating tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). ectopic expression of US3 significantly downregulated Sendai virus-activated IFN- promoter activity and that the protein kinase activity of US3. infection with US3 kinase-dead (KD) mutant HSV-1 resulted in increased production of IFN-. this is the first report identifying IRF3 as a US3 substrate. Rabbit antibodies against HSV-1 UL42, UL46, and US3 were made by GL Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai, China) all enzymes except for T4 DNA ligase were purchased from TaKaRa (Dalian, China) to construct US3-Flag, we amplified the open reading frame (ORF) of US3 from plasmid US3-EYFP as previously described. HEK 293T cells were plated on 24-well dishes in DMEM (Corning, NY) with 10% FBS at a density of 1 105 cells per well overnight before transfection. cells were then cotransfected with 1 g of expression plasmid, 500 ng of a reporter plasmid such as IFN--Luc, NF-B-Luc, or (pRDIII-I)4-Luc, and 50 ng of pRL-TK FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) samples were analyzed with fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Germany) the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl. the co-IP assays were repeated twice. two micrograms of purified US3-GST, K220M-GST, or D305A-GST and 0.2 g of IRF3-His were incubated in US3 kinase buffer (pH 9.0), 20 mM MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] and 10 M ATP. PCR product was then transformed into E. coli DY380-compete PCR was performed to amplify the K220M-Zeor, D305A-Zeo, or pUS3-Zeo cassettes with a pair of primers containing a 40-bp-homology flanking sequence of US3. the PCR products were transformed into E. coli DY380 cells containing the pHSV-1 BAC K220M-Zeor and D305A-Zeor clones. HEK 293T cells were infected with the indicated virus for 10 h. cellular lysates were subjected to native PAGE and probed with anti-IRF3 antibody to detect the IRF3 dimer. quantitative PCR assays were performed to detect mRNA levels of IFN-. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged US3 plasmid. twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were infected with SeV. co-IP assays were performed to investigate interaction between endogenous IRF3 and US3. to analyze the integrity of the BAC clones, we digested 15 g of BAC DNA with EcoR I or BamH I. the recombinant viruses were validated by PCR and sequencing using primers upstream or downstream of US3. recombinant viruses were harvested and the growth kinetics of the recombinant viruses were characterized by both plaque assay and luciferase activity assay. HEK 293T cells and Vero cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. the WT HSV-1 F strain and its derivative, US3 mutant HSV-1, were propagated in Vero cells. plasmids used include NF-B-Luc, pcDNA3.1-FlagTBK1 and pcDNA3.1/Zeo-MAVS. cDNA was used as a template for quantitative PCR to investigate expression patterns of human IFN-, ISG54, and ISG56. g of expression plasmid, 500 ng of IFN--Luc, NF-B-Luc, or (pRDIII-I)4-Luc, and 50 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with SeV (100 hemagglutination units [HAU]/ml) for 16 h. whole-cell extracts were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) or nitrocellulose membranes followed by blocking with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline\u2013tween (TBST) the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG. the co-IP assays were repeated twice. gels were prerun with 25 mM Tris and 192 mM glycine [pH 8.4]. two micrograms of purified US3-GST, K220M-GST, or D305A-GST and 0.2 g of IRF3-His were incubated in US3 kinase buffer at 37\u00b0C overnight. construction of the K220M, D305A, and repaired-HSV-1 mutants was based on a luciferase-tagged infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) the Kanr cassette was replaced with the K220M-Zeor or D305A-Zeor cassette by homologous recombination to create the pHSV-1 BAC K220M-Zeor and D305A-Zeor clones. to reconstitute recombinant viruses, vero cells were transfected with 2 g of the corresponding BAC DNA via electroporation. HEK 293T cells in a 24-cell plate were infected with the indicated virus for 10 h. quantitative PCR assays were performed to detect the mRNA levels of IFN-. media from the infected cells were analyzed by ELISA. anti-FLAG antibody or nonspecific mouse antibody IgG2b (control) and subjected to immunoblot (IB) analysis using an anti-IRF3 antibody to detect endogenous IRF3 interaction. a flag tag was inserted into the C terminus of US3 in the HSV-1 genome. hek 293T cells were infected with WT HSV-1 or US3-Flag HSV-1 for 16 h. luciferase activity assay was performed with a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out with culture supernatants collected from infected cells as previously described (36). a human IFN- ELISA kit (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway NJ) was used to detect the IFN- according to the manufacturer's instructions. seV infection resulted in an 450-fold induction of IFN--Luc reporter activity. transfection of 50 ng and 500 ng of US3 expression plasmids inhibited seV-mediated activation of the IFN- promoter by 90.1% and 95.3%. US3 inhibited poly(IC)- and poly(dA-dT)-induced IFN- promoter activity. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with either IFN--Luc (A), ISRE-Luc (B), or (pRDIII-I)4-Luc (C) reporter plasmid. plasmid, TLR3 and US3-expressing plasmid and empty vector were transfected as indicated. data are expressed as means and standard deviation from three independent experiments performed in duplicate. hek 293T cells were transfected with the US3 expression plasmid. hek 293T cells were mock infected or infected with 100 HAU/ml SeV. the dimerization of IRF3 is a hallmark of early activation of the antiviral response. expression plasmids were cotransfected into HEK 293 cells. they were examined for their ability to inhibit seV-induced IFN-, PRD(III-I) and ISRE reporter gene activities. expression of wild-type US3 strongly inhibited seV-induced IFN-, PRD(III-I), and ISRE promoter activity. HEK 293T cells were transfected with empty vector or plasmid. twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were infected with 100 HAU/ml of SeV. cells were stained with mouse anti-Flag MAb and rabbit anti-IRF3 pAb. FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (green) and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (red) were used as secondary antibodies. the results showed that US3-Flag mutant HSV-1 replicated as efficiently as WT HSV-1 in both HEK 293T cells (Fig. 5C and D) also, WB assays detected the expression of US4 in US3-Flag mutant HSV-1- and WT HSV-1-infected vero cells. a trace amount of IFN- transcription was detected in HEK 293 cells. US3 phosphorylates IRF3 at the site of Ser175. kinase activity is required for US3-mediated inhibition of the IFN antiviral response. US3 hyperphosphorylated truncated IRF3 (IRF3-His) lacks typical phosphorylation site Ser396. phosphorylation sites of IRF3 induced by US3 are located between amino acids 1 and 394. IRF3-Ser396-P Ab, phospho-specific antibody against phosphorylated IRF3 (Ser396) cells were transfected with Myc-IRF3 (1 to 394) alone or together with Flag-tagged US3 as indicated. whole-cell extracts were prepared, treated or not treated with CIP for 1 h. a series of IRF3 mutants were constructed to identify the exact IRF3 hyperphosphorylation amino acids. mutants of Del-Myc (Ser173 to Ser188 deleted), 4 M-Myc (Ser173, Ser175, Thr180, and S188 all mutated into Ala) and 3 M-Myc (Ser173, Ser175, and Thr180 all mutated into Ala) could not be hyperphosphorylated by US3. US3 protein kinase interacts with IRF3 and hyperphosphorylates IRF3 at an atypical site of Ser175. US4 was detected in all of the recombinant-virus-infected cells. luciferase activity assays were used to determine the replication kinetics of the HSV-1 mutants and WT HSV-1 in both vero cells. the results showed that both the K220M and D305A mutants decreased the expression of ICP0, UL42, UL46, and US3 in HEK 293T cells but not in Vero cells. native PAGE assays were performed to investigate IRF3 dimerization after infection by recombinant viruses. a higher level of IRF3 dimer was detected after infection by WT HSV-1 and repaired-HSV-1 infections. K220M and D305A mutant HSV-1 infections induced about 6 and 21 ng/ml of IFN-. ELISA kits showed that HSV-1 US3 interacts with and hyperphosphorylates IRF3 at Ser175, contributing to the abrogation of IFN- production. seV infection induced strong IRF-responsive PRD(III-I) promoter activity. transfection of 50 ng and 500 ng of US3 expression plasmids remarkably inhibited SeV-induced PRD(III-I) reporter activities. HEK 293T cells were transfected with flag-US3 and infected with flag-US3. luciferase activity was measured 16 h later, and fold activation was determined relative to that for empty vector with mock infection. real-time PCR analysis was then performed to detect mRNA level of IFN-. PRD(III-I) promoter activation driven by all of the expression constructs was inhibited by US3 in a dose-dependent manner. activation driven by RIG-IN, MAVS, or TBK1 was inhibited more than 90% (Fig. 2A to C) these results indicate that US3 inhibits the IFN antiviral response at or downstream of IRF3. kinase activity of US3 is essential for inhibition of the IFN antiviral response. kinase activity of US3 is essential for inhibition of the IFN antiviral response. expression of wild-type US3 strongly inhibited seV-induced IFN-, PRD(III-I), and ISRE reporter gene activity. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with PRL-TK plasmid and either IFN--Luc, (pRDIII-I)4-Luc, or ISRE-Luc reporter plasmid. twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were infected with 100 HAU/ml of SeV or mock-infected for 16 h. the kinase activity of US3 is essential for US3-mediated inhibition of the IFN antiviral response. cells were transfected with empty vector, flag-tagged US3 WT, US3 K220M, or US3 D305A expression plasmid. luciferase activity assays were used to determine the replication kinetics of US3-Flag mutant HSV-1 and WT HSV-1. the results showed that US3-Flag mutant HSV-1 replicated as efficiently as WT HSV-1 in both HEK 293T cells (Fig. 5C and D) endogenous IRF3 could also be coimmunoprecipitated by Flag MAb. co-IP was carried out to determine if the mutants abrogated their interaction with IRF3 and failed to inhibit IFN- production. RF3 was detected in both seV-infected and uninfected cells. the KD mutants K220M and D305A were unable to hyperphosphorylate IRF3. WB analysis showed that US3 did not induce the typical phosphorylation of IRF3 at the Ser396 site. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged US3 WT, US3 K220M, or US3 D305A expression plasmid as indicated. twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were infected or not infected with SeV for 8 h. whole-cell extracts were prepared, treated or not with CIP for 1 h. a series of IRF3 mutants were cotransfected with or without US3-Flag plasmid. twenty-four hours posttransfection, cell lysates were subjected to WB analysis. the plasmid IRF3/5D with mutant S175A was subjected to DLR assays. both IRF3/5D and IRF3/5D S175A induced more than 500-fold of (pRDIII-I)4-Luc reporter activity. the results show that both IRF3/5D and IRF3/5D S175A induced more than 500-fold of (pRDIII-I)4-Luc reporter activity. replication kinetics in HEK 293T cells decreased significantly compared with replication of WT and repaired viruses. luciferase activity assays were also performed at an MOI of 0.1. the results correlated with luciferase activity assays. both the K220M and D305A mutant viruses induced significantly higher levels of IFN- secretion than WT and repaired HSV-1. ELISAs were also performed to measure the secretion of IFN- when cells were infected with these viruses. infection with US3-null HSV-1 increased IRF3 activation and TLR3 and IFN levels in infected monocytic cells (41) the molecular mechanism remains unclear. in this study, US3 was proven to significantly inhibit seV-induced activation of the PRDIII-I promoter. both the K220M and the D305A mutant HSV-1 induced more IFN- production than WT HSV-1 and repaired virus. all these results indicate that the kinase activity of US3 is required for its inhibitory activity against IFN- production. evasion by HSV-1 through multiple different mechanisms. deletion of one of these proteins would increase IFN- production to a certain extent. viruses are more likely to evolve strategies to counteract innate immunity by targeting IRF3. it was also reported that US3 protein kinases phosphorylated the same substrates as protein kinase A (PKA) it has been previously reported that VZV ORF66 directly phosphorylates IE62 at the nuclear localization signal of IE62. US3-null HSV-1 was more sensitive than WT HSV-1 to IFN- (39) protein kinase was also demonstrated to block IFN-induced ISG expression by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of the IFN- receptor (40)"}
