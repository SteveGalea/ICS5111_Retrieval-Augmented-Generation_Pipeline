{"summary": "Developing cogent NTD policy requires a clear agenda and set of priorities. policymakers can set agendas and priorities independently or collaborate with multiple stakeholders to determine best way to develop effective NTD policy. lack of coordination may mean that no priorities are adequately resourced. this vague goal includes 13 targets impacting maternal mortality, substance abuse, traffic-related deaths, tobacco control, and others. one health-related target (3.3) refers to AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases. many questions need to be addressed as part of agenda setting and policy planning. decisions about where and how to address NTDs, and in what order to combat particular diseases, are critical aspects of agenda setting. decisions about where and how to address NTDs, and in what order to combat particular diseases, are critical aspects of agenda setting. they reflect judgments about which interests, needs, and goals take precedence over others. if choices are not made and priorities are not set, then circumstances and politics will dictate the agenda. questions about the relative significance given to developing and implementing long-term strategies to end NTD epidemics versus responding to the immediate needs of people facing NTDs. value-laden judgments can shape the NTD agenda by establishing the parameters within which specific policies must be developed. the extent to which different stakeholders are represented reflects views about whose perspectives are valuable and can influence the agenda. this can be achieved by building on existing structures, such as the WHO. policy aimed at specific targets requires decisions about balance between funding research, development, treatments, and preventative measures. scientists should acknowledge the need to set priorities to achieve goals. only through explicitly setting priorities will effective and sustainable policies be achieved over time."}
