{"summary": "a randomized controlled trial was conducted in 40 county-level hospitals in 2 provinces of china from October 2008 to February 2010. the trial was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov protocol registration system (NCT01052415) the trial was randomized to either the intervention condition or the control condition. four service providers were randomly sampled from each of the 40 hospitals. a total of 1760 provider participants were recruited from each of the 20 intervention hospitals, yielding a total of 456 POLs. the intervention incorporated group discussion, games, and role-play to encourage full participation of trainees. participants were compensated 50 yuan (US $7.70) for each assessment. 8 items from the original scale were scored from 1 (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d) to 5 (\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d). Example items included \u201cPeople who got HIV/AIDS through sex or drug use got what they deserved\u201d. Statistical analysis Our proposed sample size of 880 service providers per hospital 20 hospitals was powered to examine intervention effects of the 3 primary outcome measures. this sample size provided 80% power at a.05 level of significance to detect a standardized effect size of.30, which Cohen36 considered a medium effect size. covariates included age, gender, occupation, prior contact with PLH, province, number of hospital beds (200, 201\u2013500, > 500), reported HIV cases (none, 1\u201310, > 10), group (control or intervention), visit (baseline or 6- or 12-month follow-up), and group visit interaction. the intervention incorporated group discussion, games, and role-play to encourage full participation of trainees. participants were compensated 50 yuan (US $7.70) for each assessment. 8 items from the original scale were scored from 1 (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d) to 5 (\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d). Example items included \u201cPeople who got HIV/AIDS through sex or drug use got what they deserved\u201d and \u201cAIDS is a punishment for bad behavior\u201d. Statistical analysis Our proposed sample size of 880 service providers per hospital 20 hospitals was powered to examine intervention effects of the 3 primary outcome measures. this sample size provided 80% power at a.05 level of significance to detect a standardized effect size of.30, which Cohen36 considered a medium effect size. models with hospital-level random effects included age, gender, occupation, prior contact with PLH, province, number of hospital beds (200, 201\u2013500, > 500), reported HIV cases (none, 1\u201310, > 10), group (control or intervention), visit (baseline or 6- or 12-month follow-up), and group visit interaction. ported HIV cases.099 None 8 (40) 9 (45) 1\u201310 6 (30) 10 (50) > 10 6 (30) 1 (5) Provider characteristics Gender: female 611 (69.4) 577 (65.6).084a Age, y.096 35 417 (47.4) 376 (42.7) 36\u201345 316 (35.9) 330 (37.5) 46 147 (16.7) 174 (19.8) Mean 38.74 63.74 37.44 8.16.5 ance intent over time was observed in the control group. a decline in avoidance intent over time was observed in the intervention group. the intervention effects on avoidance intent and institutional support were sustained and strengthened at 12 months. contacts with PLH to be associated with lower avoidance intent (P.001) and higher institutional support (P =.011). we conducted 2 further sensitivity analyses, one with POL status as an additional fixed effect and the other with a matched pair as a random effect. measures at baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-ups were 2.72 (13% reduction from baseline) and 4.63 (22.1% reduction from baseline) at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, respectively, whereas those in the control group were less than 5%. the intervention effects on avoidance intent and institutional support were sustained and strengthened at 12 months. the intervention effects on avoidance intent and institutional support were sustained and strengthened at 12 months. DISCUSSION This study was the first large-scale intervention trial to our knowledge to assess the efficacy of an intervention confronting stigma and discrimination. results showed improved attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of the WW intervention with potential confounders controlled. the efficacy of the WW intervention has widespread significance that could go beyond HIV-related stigma reduction in health care systems. the findings will be disseminated through the Chinese health care system. the intervention manual and implementation experiences will be shared with interested organizations and agencies around the world."}
