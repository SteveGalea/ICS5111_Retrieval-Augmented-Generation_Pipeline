Approximately 50 mg of purified protein was extracted from 1 L of a culture of E. coli cells. dihydropyrimidinase (1 mM CoCl2 supplemented into the bacterial culture) was used for all analyses in this study. the activity of purified dihydropyrimidinase toward dihydrouracil was analyzed by the standard assay. as a dihydropyrimidinase, we analyzed the substrate specificity of this dihydropyrimidinase toward dihydrouracil (Fig 1B), phthalimide (Fig 1C), 5-propyl-hydantoin (Fig 1D), allantoin, and dihydroorotate. this bacterial enzyme was suitably identified as a dihydropyrimidinase, not a hydantoinase allantoin and dihydroorotate are structurally similar to hydantoin and dihydrouracil, except for the 5' side chain. allantoin and dihydroorotate are structurally similar to hydantoin and dihydrouracil, except for the 5' side chain. inhibitors or substrate analogs of allantoinase and dihydroorotase can be inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase. 5-hydantoin acetic acid, acetohydroxamate, and orotic acid were used in this study. also, 5-hydantoin acetic acid and acetohydroxamate could only slightly inhibit the activity of dihydropyrimidinase. dihydroorotate, 5-hydantoin acetic acid, and acetohydroxamate inhibited dihydropyrimidinase activity. IC50 values were at the millimolar range and higher than the K m values of dihydropyrimidinase. IC50 determination of flavonoids for dihydropyrimidinase using dihydrouracil as a substrate. myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and galangin at different concentrations were included in the standard assay. derivatives of myricetin can be inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase. IC50 values of dihydromyricetin for dihydropyrimidinase were 48 2 and 40 2 M. dihydromyricetin showed a significant inhibitory effect on the activities of dihydropyrimidinase. the structure of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase has yet to be determined. human dihydropyrimidinase (PDB entry: 2VR2) was the first hit suggested as a template by the program. residues H59, H61, K150, H183, H239, and D316 of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase were crucial for the assembly of the binuclear metal center within the active site. residues Y155, S289, and N337 were crucial for substrate binding. model was directly constructed by superimposing the modeled structure of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase with the crystal structure of S. kluyveri dihydropyrimidinase-dihydrouracil complex. alignment consensus of 497 sequenced dihydropyrimidinase homologs by ConSurf reveals degree of variability at each position along the primary sequence. dihydromyricetin interacted with I95 (light pink), S289 (limon) and D316 (yellow) of dihydropyrimidinase. myricetin interacted with N157, Q194, R212, and N337. ring structure of dihydromyricetin was more flexible than that of myricetin. inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by dihydromyricetin resulted in LineweaverBurk plots with lines that crossed the y-axis at a similar point. the presence of 40 M dihydromyricetin yielded V max and K m values, kinetic constants, of 5.4 0.4 mol/mg/min and 1.6 0.2 mM, respectively. dihydropyrimidinase bound to dihydromyricetin and myricetin was quenched. the intrinsic fluorescence of dihydropyrimidinase was quenched by 56.2% and 89.1%, respectively. dihydromyricetin and dihydromyricetin interacted with dihydropyrimidinase. this suggests that myricetin and dihydromyricetin could form stable complexes with di the decrease in intrinsic fluorescence of protein was measured at 334.5 nm upon excitation at 279 nm and 25\u00b0C with a spectrofluorimeter. the fluorescence emission spectra of dihydropyrimidinase with dihydromyricetin of different concentrations (0\u201350 M) myricetin and dihydromyricetin quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of dihydropyrimidinase by 58.4% and 86.3%, respectively. the max shifts of the N337A mutant by myricetin and dihydromyricetin were similar, but still slightly different, to those of the wild-type dihydropyrimidinase. fluorescence emission spectra of the N337A mutant with dihydromyricetin of different concentrations (0\u201350 M). an aliquot amount of dihydromyricetin and myricetin was individually added to the enzyme solution for each K d. data points are an average of 2\u20133 determinations within 10% error. the addition of 1 mM CoCl2, ZnCl2, or MnCl2 activated dihydropyrimidinase activity. we added 1 mM CoCl2, the best supplement, into the bacterial culture for dihydropyrimidinase expression. the resultant dihydropyrimidinase was purified and analyzed. the gene product of PA0441 has been described as a dihydropyrimidinase. however, the substrate specificities of dihydropyrimidinase and hydantoinase may differ. hydantoinase prefers 5-leucinyl-hydantoin to phthalimide and dihydrouracil. dihydropyrimidinase substrate V max K m V max/K m Fold Dihydrouracil 7.6 0.4 0.7 0.1 10.9 1.0 Phthalimide 2.7 0.6 1.0 0.3 2.7 0.25 5-Propyl-hydantoin 1.2 0.1 8.1 1.5 0.15 0.01 Allantoin not hydrolyzed Dihydroorotate not hydrolyzed The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were determined by fitting allantoin and dihydroorotate only slightly inhibited the activity of dihydropyrimidinase. thus, substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolase may not be strong inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase. dihydropyrimidinase inhibits 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole at 100\u2013750 mM. inhibitors or substrate analogs of allantoinase, dihydroorotase, and glutaminyl cyclase were not potent inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase. IC50 values of dihydroorotate, 5-hydantoin acetic acid, and acetohydr inhibitory capabilities of flavonols myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and galangin were tested. the derivatives of myricetin, dihydromyricetin, and myricitrin were further used and tested. hydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin continued to decrease as the concentrations of the compound increased. however, these compounds caused distinct effects when different substrates were used. the effect of quercetin was insignificant. the order of the inhibitory capability of the flavonoids for dihydrouracil was as follows: dihydromyricetin > kaempferol > myricetin > galangin > quercetin > myricitrin. for the first time, flavonols, especially dihydromyricetin, were established as novel inhibitors of dihydropyrimidinase. (PS)2 is an automatic homology modeling server that combines sequence and secondary structure information to detect homologous proteins with remote similarity and target\u2013template alignment. human and P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase shared a highly similar structure (S3 Fig) only N337A mutant protein was found to be active, but its activity was about 20-fold less than that of the wild-type dihydropyrimidinase. residues H59, H61, K150, H183, H239 and D316 of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase were crucial for the assembly of the binuclear metal center within the active site. the docking models with the highest score in dihydropyrimidinase interacting with dihydromyricetin and myricetin were computationally docked into the 3D model. dihydromyricetin interacted with I95, S289, and D316 (Fig 5A), in which only N337 was crucial. dihydromyricetin is a competitive inhibitor of dihydropyrimidinase. the presence of 40 M dihydromyricetin yielded V max and K m values. without dihydromyricetin, the kinetic constants V max and K m were 7.6 0.4 mol/mg/min. dihydromyricetin could compete with dihydrouracil for dihydropyrimidinase. dihydromyricetin is a competitive inhibitor for dihydropyrimidinase. dihydromyricetin is a competitive inhibitor for dihydropyrimidinase. dihydromyricetin caused a red shift in the dihydropyrimidinase emission wavelength (em) dihydromyricetin and dihydromyricetin interacted with dihydropyrimidinase. this suggests that myricetin and dihydromyricetin could form stable complexes. an aliquot amount of dihydromyricetin and myricetin was individually added to the enzyme solution for each K d. the K d was obtained by the equation: F = Fmax-K d(F/[compound]). the K d value of the N337A mutant bound to myricetin was reduced to 59.3 8.6 M (twofold) however, the K d value of the N337A mutant for dihydromyricetin binding was 24.1 1.7 M, a value nearly identical to that of the wild-type dihydropyrimidinase. this suggested that N337 was important for myricetin binding but not for dihydromyricetin. the flavonols myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and galangin exerted different inhibitory effects on dihydropyrimidinase. the flavonols\u2019 inhibitory effect (IC50) on dihydropyrimidinase was substrate-dependent. flavonoids are the most common group of plant polyphenols with antioxidant, antiradical, anticancer, and antibacterial properties. flavonoids are the most common group of plant polyphenols with antioxidant, antiradical, anticancer, and antibacterial properties. flavonoids are ATPase-inhibiting agents and competitors for ATP-binding proteins. the higher activity of the co2+-substituted enzymes has been proposed. the higher activity followed by metal replacement in Co(II)-thermolysin than in native thermolysin may be due to the enhancement of stabilization of the transition state than those of the native thermolysin. structure of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase was modeled using SWISS-MODEL and human dihydropyrimidinase as a template. amino acid residue 3479 in the modeled structure of P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase (limon) was superimposed with the amino acid residue 5493 in the crystal structure of human dihydropyrimidinase (gray) structure is aligned, indicating a highly similar structure between human and P. aeruginosa dihydropyrimidinase."}
