{"summary": "influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are the major cause of respiratory disease in humans. three influenza types/subtypes circulate in the population, A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B.1 influenza infections in the elderly and young children can lead to secondary bacterial infections that result in severe symptoms and occasional death. a firm molecular definition for these cells came about with the discovery that they express the forkhead-winged helix transcription factor Foxp3. in humans, regulatory activity is mostly confined to the CD4+CD25high subset. interleukine (IL)-7 plays an essential role in the development and maintenance of T lymphocytes. IL-10 and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-.11 participate in the development and/or maintenance of all Treg subsets, whether they originate from Foxp3+ or Foxp3- thymic precursor cells. little is known about Treg responses induced post influenza vaccination. changes of cytokines expression after vaccination were summarized in Table 2. The changes of cytokine profile after vaccination. cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-, and TNF did not show a marked change after vaccination. titers to the influenza A H1N1, influenza A H3N2, influenza B/Yamagata, and influenza B/Victoria below 1:40 were found in 29\u201365%, 20\u201333%, 4\u201340% and 17\u201344% of the subjects before vaccination. correlation of cytokines and antibody titers Since the duration of antibody titer is short that are usually decreased after one year post immunization. fold-increases of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IFN-, or TNF- level showed different correlation to fold-increases of each anti-influenza antibody titer. all subjects received influenza vaccinations for at least two consecutive years. no significant differences in expression frequency for CD4+ (p = 0.025) increased significantly after vaccination. the changes of cytokine profile after vaccination were summarized in Table 2. The changes of cytokines expression in subjects before and after influenza vaccination. the plasma TGF- level (p 0.05) of the subjects elevated significantly after vaccination. magata, and influenza B/Victoria below 1:40 were found in 29\u201365%, 20\u201333%, 4\u201340% and 17\u201344% of the subjects before vaccination. titers above 1:40 for the subjects to influenza A H1N1 were 96\u2013100%, to influenza A H3N2, 85\u2013100%, to influenza B/Yamagata, 78\u2013100%, and to influenza B/Victoria, 85\u2013100%. levels showed different correlation to fold-increases of each anti-influenza antibody titer. increased levels of antibody induced by vaccination decrease the risk for illness caused by endemic strains that are similar antigenically to those in the vaccine. UV-inactivated PR8 virus vaccine expanded the CD4+Foxp3+ Treg pool. Increasing the size of the Foxp3+ Treg pool did not alter the primary PR8-specific B-cell response, but suppressed primary and memory PR8-specific T helper responses induced by vaccination. CD127hi effector cells express more survival factors and undergo apoptosis to a lesser extent in vivo than do CD127lo effector cells. they strongly support the model in which CD127hi effector cells are selected to survive and develop into long-lived memory cells. single immunization led to an expected increase in IFN- and Granzyme B. boosting 16 weeks after the initial dose lead to decreased IFN- and Granzyme B as compared with the single boost group. we did not evaluate the frequency of B cells taken from the human cohort. the altered expression of Treg cells may be used as a surrogate measure of regulatory function that influenced the production of anti-influenza antibody. sample preparation Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from EDTA whole blood using Ficoll separation (Ficoll-Paque plus; Amersham Biosciences) plasma was stored at 80\u00b0C for further use. CD4+ Tregs showed Foxp3 expression as determined by FACS intra-cytoplasmic staining with anti-Foxp3Ab. from the gated lymphocyte population, the total Foxp3 expression and isotype control were analyzed (C) (R2) and (D) (R3). serum HAI antibody titers of 40 were considered protective. a p 0.05 was considered significant. valent inactivated preservative-free split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine were used throughout the trial. sample preparation Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from EDTA whole blood using Ficoll separation (Ficoll-Paque plus; Amersham Biosciences) plasma was stored at 80\u00b0C for further use. cytoplasmic staining with anti-Foxp3Ab (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) gating strategy for each population is demonstrated in Figure 3. cytokines Plasma for cytokine determination was harvested from the subjects within 30 min of venipuncture from EDTA-anticoagulated venous blood samples. the test was conducted with 8 HA units of the appropriate virus and 0.7% (v v) turkey erythrocytes. serum HAI antibody titers of 40 were considered to be protective."}
