{"summary": "RNA silencing is a conserved mechanism for most eukaryotic post-transcriptional gene regulation. siRNAs are derived from the cytoplasmic cleavage of the long doubled RNA(dsRNA) into 21 nt siRNA duplexes by dsRNA-specific endoribonuclease (RNase) Dicer. one strand of the siRNAs is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC inactivation of Dicer could influence the replication of animal viruses. the virus is a small, enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus. it can make sows reproduce unsuccessfully and cause pigs to have respiratory difficultly or to experience a secondary infection. cells of MARC-145 were co-transfected with firefly luciferase expression plasmid CMV-Luc, internal control plasmid RLTK and firefly luciferase-specific shRNA (shLuc) (A); firefly luciferase-specific dsRNA (dsRNA) (B); pcDNA6.2-miR4 and psiCHECK-UL-28 (C); NFIB the endogenous gene NFIB was selected to perform a similar experiment. the results show that PRRSV also inhibited the si-NFIB- and miR-373-induced silencing of NFIB. MARC-145 cells were transfected with dicer-siRNA (A) or Dicer-shRNA (B) after 24 hours, the cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of one or 0.1. also, 24 h after PRRSV infection, cells were ready for qRT-PCR of Dicer, PRRSV ORF-7 and PRRSV nsp1 (A,B) cells of MARC-145 were transfected with Ago-2-shRNA (A) and after 24 hours, the cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 1, 0.1 or 0.01. cells were collected for qRT-PCR of Ago-2, PRRSV ORF-7 and nsp1 (A) or cells were collected for Western blots for Ago-2 (B) MARC-145 cells were co-transfected with firefly luciferase expression plasmid, internal control plasmid RLTK and shLuc. after 48 h, the cells were ready for the dual luciferase reporter assay. nsp1 and nsp1 were from the auto-cleaving of PRRSV nsp1. only nsp1 was the RSS, but nsp1 was not. mutants nsp1C76S and nsp1H146A were unable to suppress the RNA silencing. endoU domain belongs to a small protein family whose cellular branch was prototyped by XendoU, a Xenopus laevis endoribonuclease. mutating one of the three amino acids could abolish the NendoU activity. -145 cells were transfected with expression plasmid of nsp1, nsp1C76S, nsp1H146A, nsp11, nsp11 H129A, nsp11H144A or control plasmid pcDNA3.1-Flag. also, after 48 h, the cells were ready for Western blotting. first, we tested whether PRRSV was capable of restoring the silencing of a luciferase gene induced by shRNA. the shLuc plasmid strongly decreased the expression level of luciferase. dsRNA strongly decreased the expression level of luciferase, while PRRSV infection also inhibited the shRNA-induced silencing of luciferase. a previous study has shown that miR4 of the Marek\u2019s disease virus targeted the viral mRNA UL-28 [19]. the results of qRT-PCR in Figure 4A and the results of Western bots in Figure 4B,C show that downregulation of Ago-2 enhanced the levels of PRRSV RNA and the viral titers in MARC-145 cells. Western blot results for Dicer were quantified by Quantity One Software (D,F) Viral yields in the supernatants were also quantified by TCID50 (G,H). experiments were repeated three times. PRRSV nsp1 and nsp11 were suppressors of RNA-mediated gene silencing (RSS) most discovered RSSs in animal viruses have also been interferon antagonists. previous studies have shown that nsp1 and nsp11 of PRRSV were antagonists against interferon (IFN) luciferase-specific dsRNA (dsRNA) (B,E,H,K), or miRNA plasmids pcDNA-miR4 and psiCHECK-UL-28 (C,F,I,L) after 48 h, the cells were ready for the dual luciferase reporter assay. the experiments were repeated three times. the endonuclease activity essential for nsp11 as a RSS PRRSV nsp11 possessed the activity of nidovirus uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) [31], which is a major characteristic of Nidoviruses [32]. mutating one of the three amino acids could abolish the NendoU activity [32]. MARC-145 cells were transfected with expression plasmid of nsp1, nsp1C76S, nsp1H146A, nsp11, nsp11 H129A, nsp11H144A or control plasmid pcDNA3.1-Flag. after 48 h, the cells were ready for Western blotting. t results were quantified by Quantity One Software (B) it was clear that RNA silencing could be used as a natural antiviral immunity in plants, insects and lower invertebrates. the viral genome could form a double-stranded RNA intermediate, local secondary structures and overlapping virus transcripts during viral replication. the proteins Dicer and Ago-2 are the cellular RNA silencing apparatus. both silencing Dicer and silencing Ago-2 enhanced PRRSV replication. this indicated that RNA silencing could be a defense system against PRRSV. however, it is reasonable that PRRSV would encode RSS to fight RNA silencing. PRRSV nsp1 and nsp11 were the antagonists of the production of IFN- [23,24,25,26], and the activities of PCP and endoribonuclease were respectively required for nsp1 and nsp11 as the RSSs. the relationship between the RNA silencing and the IFN pathway may be an interesting topic in the future, since it suggests that the RNA silencing and the IFN pathway are overlapping. the present work could give a clue that the RSSs of PRRSV must be considered as another target when the siRNA, shRNA and miRNA are used as the therapy against PRRSV. the siRNA, shRNA and miRNA are used as the therapy against PRRSV. in dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), with a Renilla luciferase reporter gene, was applied as an internal control. for the production of shRNA to silence luciferase, the forward oligonucleotides (5\u2032-GATCCCCGAAGCTATGGGCTGAATACTTGTTTTTTGGGG-3\u2032) were synthesized by Sangon Biotech. the pSGH1 vector was digested with reverse oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sangon Biotech. the oligonucleotides were annealed to double oligodeoxynucleotides. then, the oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed to double oligodeoxynucleotides and were cloned into pcDNA6.2 (Promega) to generate psiCHECK2/NFIB 3\u2032 the oligonucleotides were annealed to double oligodeoxynucleotides. then, the oligonucleotides were inserted to the shRNA-generating vector pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR. the forward and reverse oligonucleotides were inserted to the shRNA-generating vector pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR. the PCR product was cloned into psiCHECK-2 (psiCHECK-UL-28). 4.3. anti-actin IgG (Zhongshan Goldenbridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China), rabbit anti-Dicer, rabbit anti-Ago-2 and goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked second antibody. ts. ten percent SDS-PAGE gels were used to separate proteins. then, the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. the cells were infected with PRRSV (BJ-4 strain) at an MOI of 1 or 0.1.
