{"summary": "human Herpesviruses type 1 and 2 (HHV-1 and HHV-2), associated with cold sore and herpes genitalis respectively, are neurotropic and neuro-invasive double-stranded DNA viruses. therapy with nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir has been widely applied for the treatment of herpesvirus infections. leukemia is the fifteenth most commonly occurring cancer and the eleventh cause of cancer death on both sexes worldwide. quinones are phenolic-related secondary metabolites that exhibit diverse pharmacological properties, including antiviral, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. quinones are phenolic-related secondary metabolites that represent a class of important anticancer agents. compounds included in this study were selected as representative members of three families of terpenyl-1,4-NQs (1\u20139), 1,4-AQs (10\u201318) and HetQs (19\u201327) the compounds included in this study were selected as representative members of three families of terpenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) and 1,4-anthraquinone (AQ) derivatives. 4-MeO-Ph-NH- 17 (1:1) 3,4-(MeO)2-Ph-NH- Cl 9 (9:1) I Cl Ph-CH2-NH- 18 (1:9) 3,4,5-(MeO)3-Ph-NH- Cl Figure 1.

HHV-1 and HHV-2 were performed. this experiment was extended to DENV-2 to prove the potential antiviral broad-spectrum of NQ 4. dextran sulfate positive control was active against HHV-1 and HHV-2 at 5 g/mL. in post-infective stages, NQ 4 showed no activity, neither against HHV-1, HHV-2 nor DENV-2. positive controls acyclovir and ribavirin employed against HHV serotypes and DENV-2 respectively, were active. NQ 4 reduces significantly (*** p 0.001) the HHV-1 attachment on vero cells. the effect of this compound on viral entry was not significant. glycoproteins gB, gD and gH/gL are required for both entry pathways. antiviral activity has been described for certain quinones and other structurally related molecules with therapeutic potential. AQs have shown antiviral activities against DNA and RNA viruses by inhibition of viral entry, replication and genome transcription. n-octyl-d-glucoside binding cleft of envelope protein (ENV) pre-fusion form (PDB:1OKE) was run. several amino acids have been reported to be critical for membrane fusion during virus entry. doxorubicin forms hydrogen bonds with Glu26 and His27. the molecule fits into the -OG binding cleft of the dengue virus E glycoprotein dimer. no interactions were formed with any amino acids found for NQ 4. quinones exert anti-HHV-1 activity in early stages, specifically avoiding viral attachment. some quinone derivatives may affect dramatically phospholipidic membranes. this may affect the initial interaction virus-cellular receptor, and the subsequent viral entry to the host cell. la ATCC CRL-1958 Jurkat ATCC CCL-81 IC50 SD r 2 SI IC50 SD r 2 NQs 1 >104.0 na nd >104.0 na nd nd 2 103.8 3.8 0.9 1 6.2 0.2 0.8 15 95.0 2.1 0.9 3 19.5 na >1 1.6 0.1 0.7 8 12.8 2.0 0.8 4 46.6 3.3 1.0 14 36.3 2.0 0.9 18 642.7 na 5 0.4 1.0 10 >126.9 na 16 5.6 0.4 0.9 32 12.4 0.4 1.0 14 179.3 12.9 0.7 17 7.5 0.6 0.9 16 9.6 0.4 0.9 12 118.6 15.9 0.8 18 13.7 na 2 10.1 0.8 0.9 2 24.3 3.8 0.9 0.9 12 118.6 15.9 0.8 18 13.7 na 2 10.1 0.8 0.9 2 24.3 3.8 0.9 0.9 12 the IC50 values corresponding to the most cytotoxic compounds for cancer cells (10 M) or less toxic for normal cells (>100 M), as well as SI values >14, are in bold for better comparisons.
