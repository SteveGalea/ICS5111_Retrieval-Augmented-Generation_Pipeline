RNA interference (RNAi) is a process by which sequence-specific degradation of mRNA takes place. long dsRNA precursors are chopped into shorter (19\u201323 resides) units by a ribonuclease enzyme called dicer. RNAi is a potential therapeutic tool for targeting human viruses. RNAi methodology has many desirable features to use as antiviral agents. it can target diverse types of viral genomes, whether it be double/single stranded DNA or RNA, which make it a suitable candidate for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. siRNA aims at small length of the target mRNA instead of a functional domain of a protein. machine learning techniques have been used to predict effective mammalian siRNAs [29,30] or their efficacy [31,32] researchers have utilised many siRNA features like nucleotide composition [37], thermodynamic parameters [38], nucleotide position etc. to predict the efficiency of siRNAs. this combined dataset of 2294 siRNAs was reduced to 1725 sequences after removal of redundant sequences. from this dataset we randomly selected 345 sequences for validation. the rest 1380 sequences were used in training. the thermodynamic dimensions correspond to the Gibbs free energy stability of the nucleotide pairs of the siRNAs. in total 21 features were used to calculate the energies of the different sets of interacting nucleotides. these features include the binding free energies and stabilities of the folded structures. ALIGN0 algorithm computes the alignment of two DNA sequences without penalizing for end-gaps. ANN was implemented using Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS) package (available at http://www.ra.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/SNNS/) algorithm development Data collection We have chosen our dataset from Viral siRNA database (VIRsiRNAdb) which contains over 1358 siRNA sequences targeting different human viruses and HIV siRNA database (HIVsirDB) having over 750 entries. from these databases we selected 927 and 240 sequences of 19mer which were having numerical (quantitative) efficacy. the information of each siRNA can be encapsulated to a vector of 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024 etc. multi-dimensions using frequencies of its mononucleotide, dinucleotide, triinucleotide, tetranucleotide and pentanucleotide sub sequences respectively. RNAfold are depicted as brackets and dots indicating \u2018paired\u2019 and \u2018unpaired\u2019 nucleotides respectively. these categorical attributes are made readable to SVM by converting them into numeric data representing the structural features as vectors. we have used four hybrid methods to increase the performance of the prediction method as done by earlier researchers. this combined dataset of 2294 siRNAs was reduced to 1725 sequences after removal of redundant sequences. from this dataset we randomly selected 345 sequences for validation. the rest 1380 sequences were used in training (T 1380 ). the thermodynamic dimensions correspond to the Gibbs free energy stability of the nucleotide pairs of the siRNAs. in total 21 features were used to calculate the energies of the different sets of interacting nucleotides. these features include the binding free energies and stabilities of the folded structures. viral siRNA target conservation Target site conservation analysis of all experimental 1725 viral siRNA sequences was done by matching each siRNA sequence with its respective reference viral genome sequences taken from NCBI.
