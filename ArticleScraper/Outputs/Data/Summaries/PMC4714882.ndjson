{"summary": "the causative agent, the PED virus (PEDV), belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales. the devastating effect of PEDV infection is mainly due to the acute watery diarrhea and dehydration induced in infected pigs. the impact of PEDV infection on the reproductive performance of gilts and sows depends on the period of pregnancy. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects between a 1-year period before and after PEDV outbreak on a sow\u2019s reproductive traits on a commercial pig farm in Taiwan. pig owners provided written consent for data collection and publication. ine parvovirus (PPV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and atrophic rhinitis between 24 and 30 weeks of age in replacement gilts. no sows exhibited ADV, PCV2, PPV, PRRSV or bacterial abortion. target replacement rate of sows by gilts was approximately 48% annually. no feedback immunization has been performed in this pig herd since august 2014. 80% of gilts and sows showed clinical signs of mild anorexia, diarrhea and vomiting. pig owners worried about the reemergence of PEDV. the average number of mated females, average parity of farrowed sows, number of matings, number of farrowings, FR, RR, number of abortions, percentage of sows mated by 7 days after weaning, WFSI, FI, NPDs, replacement rates of sows and sow culling rates of pre- and post-PEDV outbreak periods were compared using a two-way ANOVA. no sows exhibited ADV, PCV2, PPV, PRRSV or bacterial abortion. the target replacement rate of the sows by gilts was approximately 48% annually. 80% of gilts and sows showed clinical signs of mild anorexia, diarrhea and vomiting. no feedback immunization has been performed in this pig herd since august 2014. the average number of mated females, average parity of farrowed sows, number of matings, number of farrowings, FR, RR, number of abortions, LMFY, percentage of sows mated by 7 days after weaning. the number of matings showed a 58-point increase during the post-PEDV outbreak period. the number of abortions rapidly increased during the PEDV outbreak period (19 January to 18 February 2014) the abortion rate (AR) after the PEDV outbreak was significantly higher than the AR before the PEDV infection. together, these results indicated that the reduction in reproductive performance was more severe in pregnant gilts than in pregnant sows during the post-PEDV outbreak period. sow culling rate (%) 48.9 48.0 - 0.9 0.921 Sow culling rate (%) 32.2 39.4 + 7.2 0.0575 Lactation length (days) 25.6 25.7 + 0.1 0.751 Gilt pool (average/month) PEDV during the disease outbreak period (19 January to 18 February 2014) had a 41.7 percentage point increase in pre-weaning mortality (17.3% vs. 59%) compared with the same period in the year before the outbreak (19 January to 18 February 2013) comparison of the total number of pigs born per litter, number of pigs born alive per litter and weaning pigs per litter. DV outbreak on the LMFY (P = 0.0681), replacement rate of sows (P = 0.9206) and sow culling rate (P = 0.0575) was not significantly different between the pre- and post-outbreak periods. the influence of the PEDV outbreak on the NPDs was more pronounced in pigs with initial pregnancies. the percentage of sows mated within 7 days post-weaning declined. blue line represents the annual mean of weaning to first service interval in different sow parities (1 and >2) between 1 year pre- (19 January 2013 to 18 January 2014) and post- (19 January 2014 to 18 January 2015) porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreak. the abortion rate (AR) after the PEDV outbreak was significantly higher than the AR before the PEDV infection. together, these results indicated that the reduction in reproductive performance was more severe in pregnant gilts than in pregnant sows during the post-PEDV outbreak period. 0.0575 Lactation length (days) 25.6 25.7 + 0.1 0.751 Gilt pool (average/month) 1019 (84.9) 971 (80.9) - 48 0.385 were considered statistically significant and very highly significant, respectively. pigs born/litter 13.7 12.1 -1.6 0.0001** Pigs born alive/litter 12.6 11.5 -1.1 0.0001** Total weaning pigs (average/month) 50,569 (4214.1) 43,371 (3614.3) -7198 0.126 Weaning pigs/litter 10.7 9.6 -1.1 0.0003** a The Mann-Whitney test was used for comparisons between 1-year pre- and post-PEDV the percentage of sows mated within 7 days post-weaning was related to the WFSI, which is one of the factors that affected the NPDs. the percentage of sows mated within 7 days post-weaning declined (from 86.7% to 45.6%) during the PEDV outbreak period (19 January to 18 February 2014) compared with the same period in the year before and after PEDV outbreaks. weaning to first service interval in different sow parities (1 and >2) between 1 year pre- (19 January 2013 to 18 January 2014) and post- (19 January 2014 to 18 January 2015) porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreak. blue line represents the annual mean of weaning to first service interval. the influence of the PEDV outbreak on FR and RR was more pronounced in primiparous sows that are early in their pregnancy. factors that may affect NPDs include increases in RR, number of abortions, percentage of sows mated within 7 days after weaning, WFSI and FI. primiparous sows showed severe clinical signs of anorexia, diarrhea and vomiting when infected with PEDV. increasing feed intake during lactation can increase luteinizing hormone secretion and reduce the weaning-to-estrous and farrowing-to-estrous intervals in primiparous sows [20], ii) protein (lysine) restriction throughout lactation alters circulating concentrations of somatotropic hormones and insulin at the end of lactation. the impact of PEDV on NPDs in gilts and sows may be controlled or improved by following methods. the pig owners did not alter the gilt and sow management, including lactation length. report to show the influence of PEDV on NPDs in gilts and sows. findings should contribute to an understanding of the effects of PEDV outbreak post-infection on sow herds."}
