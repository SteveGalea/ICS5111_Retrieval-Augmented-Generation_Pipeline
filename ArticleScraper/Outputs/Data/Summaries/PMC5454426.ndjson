{"summary": "the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an acute and highly contagious enteric viral disease in nursing pigs. it is characterized by vomiting and lethal, watery diarrhea, and is becoming a global problem. the disease has emerged in many pig-producing countries in Europe and Asia. some endogenous proteases present in the pig small intestine could facilitate the entry of PEDV virions into intestinal epithelial cells. however, in vitro, PEDV-infected cells produce syncytia only after treatment with an exogenous protease such as trypsin. this exogenous protease cleavage event leads to cell\u2013cell and virus\u2013cell fusion. the role of TMPRSS2 in the release of PEDV from infected cells was clarified. however, the effects of transmembrane serine proteases on host infection by animal coronaviruses, especially PEDV, have not been thoroughly studied thus far. sw-HAT-F ACAACGCACAATAACTCCCTCTG Swine-HAT sw-HAT sw-HAT-R GACATTGTTCTCTTG (XM_013978756) sw-DESC1-R AGGGGGTCCTCTCTTG (XM_013978755) sw-DESC1-R AGGGGGTCCTCTCTTG (XM_013978755) sw-MSPL- sw-GAPDH-F sw-GAPDH-R GCCTTGACTGTGCCGTGGAAC (XM_013991162) Primers for identification of TTSPs in Vero cells m-TMPRSS2-F ACCGCCAGGTGTTACCTTAC m-TMPRSS2 m-TMPRSS2-R GACACGCACCAGTTAG (XM_007968781) m-HAT-F AGTGTGTCTC TTSPs were transfected with pCMV-Myc expressing TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, or MSPL using Lipofectamine LTX & Plus Reagent. the complexes were allowed to form by incubation for 30 min. post-transfection cells were cultured in 6-well plates at 1.5 105/well. cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT for 10 min. then, the cells were blocked in PBS with 0.3% bovine serum albumin. the cells were treated with mouse anti-Myc antibody (Sigma) and rhodamine Red-X-coupled anti-mouse. cytometry, vero cells transfected with TTSP-encoding plasmid were detached, washed with PBS, incubated with ice-cold ethanol for 10 min. cells were stained with mouse anti-Myc primary antibodies (Sigma) followed by DyLight 647-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Dianova, BioLeaf Biotech, Shanghai, China) 3 independent tests were calculated by the 2Ct method. levels of N transcripts were normalized to those of -actin transcripts in the same sample. no specific signals detected in any negative controls. vero cells were transfected with 1 g/well of pCMV-Myc plasmids expressing a TTSP (TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1) or empty pCMV-Myc plasmid (control) and seeded in 24-well plates. the cells were infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and supplemented with 3 g/mL trypsin or PBS. pCMV-Myc-transfected cells were infected with PEDV in absence or presence of 3 g/mL trypsin. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 0.3% bovine serum albumin. after washing, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG the cells were harvested and subjected to sonication and denatured. the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. the PEDV S protein with a HA antigenic tag was detected by staining with mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the HA tag. cells were washed with PBS and infected with PEDV LJB/03. cells were added to target cells after 24 h of co-cultivation. cDNA was produced using a commercially available kit (Promega). pCMV-Myc plasmids expressing human TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, or MSPL were constructed following gene amplification and digestion by EcoRI and BglII. pCMV-Myc plasmids expressing human TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, or MSPL were constructed following gene amplification and digestion. sw-HAT-F ACAACGCACAATAACTCCCTCTG Swine-HAT sw-HAT-R GACATTGTTCTCTGTTGAAGGCTGG (XM_013978756) sw-DESC1-F TGCTGCTGATTTTTAGATTTCTC Swine-DESC1 sw-DESC1-R AGGGGGTCCTCTTG (XM_013978756) Primers for identification of swin sw-MSPL-F sw-MSPL-R TGTAGATGCTCTCCTGGATGGTG (XM_013989517) sw-GAPDH-F sw-GAPDH-R GCCTTGACTGTGCCGTGGAAC (XM_013991162) Primers for identification of TTSPs in Vero cells m-TMPRSS2-F ACCGCCAGGTGTTACCTTAC m-TMPRSS2 the confluent cell monolayer was washed once with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with PEDV LJB/03 supplemented with 21 g/mL trypsin. the cells were washed twice with PBS, and the maintenance medium was supplemented with 5 g/mL trypsin. cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at RT for 15 min. then, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT for 10 min. then, the cells were blocked in PBS with 0.3% bovine serum albumin. -mouse antibody (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) was used as a loading control.

TTSPs are synthesized as inactive single-chain zymogens. TTSPs undergo self-cleavage into active forms during or after transport. no TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1 or MSPL mRNA was detected in the vero cells in this study. the effects of these proteases on PEDV replication in vero cells exogenously expressing TTSPs were examined. MSPL and TMPRSS2 play important roles in PEDV infection. titers following expression of TTSPs in vero cells were determined by plaque assay. TTSPs such as TMPRSS2 and MSPL play an important role in PEDV entry. TMPRSS2 and MSPL promote PEDV replication better than trypsin. transfection with HAT and DESC1 did not promote cell fusion. escence staining of TTSP-transfected Vero cells revealed that the PEDV S protein was extensively co-localized with MSPL and TMPRSS2 but not with HAT or DESC1. the cellular localizations of S protein and TMPRSS2 or MSPL overlap extensively, indicating that MSPL and TMPRSS2 may interact with S protein, activating PEDV replication in vero cells. TMPRSS2 and MSPL cleave the PEDV S protein. the cleavage C-terminal fraction of S protein detected was 160 kDa. the effects of TMPRSS2 and MSPL on PEDV S protein activation may be responsible for the replication of PEDV. small intestines of piglets contribute to viral spread in infected piglets. expression of TTSPs in normal and PEDV-infected porcine small intestine/intestinal epithelial cells. TTSPs facilitate propagation of PEDV Isolates in vero cells. TTSPs were transfected with pCMV-Myc plasmids expressing TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1 or MSPL. expression of most proteases was readily detectable with the proper predicted size for each. TTSPs are synthesized as inactive single-chain zymogens. the most prominent signal was measured in TMPRSS2-expressing cells. the fluorescence signal obtained from HAT-expressing cells was the weakest. expression of type II transmembrane serine proteases was detected via indirect immunofluorescence. titers of PEDV propagated in vero cells transfected with pCMV-Myc expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL were clearly higher than those of PEDV propagated in the empty-plasmid group. the viral titers in vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL were almost 102.5 to 104.5 times higher than those in the empty-plasmid group. p 0.001 vs. empty pCMV-Myc plasmid with 3 g/mL trypsin. TTSP inhibitor AEBSF-HCl was used to evaluate the effects of TTSPs on trypsin-independent PEDV entry. the expression of MSPL and TMPRSS2 in vero target cells significantly promoted fusion with vero effector cells following PEDV infection. transfection with HAT and DESC1 did not promote cell\u2013cell fusion that was observed with the empty plasmid control. results indicate that MSPL and TMPRSS2 facilitate PEDV replication. analysis of TTSP and PEDV S protein co-localization using a laser scanning microscope. TMPRSS2 and MSPL may interact with S protein, activating PEDV replication in vero cells. mRNA levels of TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1 and MSPL increased in the small intestine of normal and PEDV-infected piglets. the endogenous TTSP level is up-regulated in IECs after PEDV infection. the endogenous TTSP level is up-regulated after PEDV infection. TTSP-transfected vero cells were infected with processed viral samples. TMPRSS2 and MSPL facilitated strain A replication to an almost 20-fold higher extent than the TTSP control (pCMV-Myc group) recent outbreaks have emerged in a number of swine-producing countries. PEDV has been spreading rapidly among swine farms in the united states. this has resulted in high piglet mortality in more than 32 states. however, the effectiveness of the vaccine has been questioned. TTSPs are the host proteases of respiratory and digestive tract mucosa. the TTSP expression levels may be low or limited in some conditions or over a period of time, which results in difficulty in obtaining actual porcine TTSP genes. the TTSP family is composed of more than 20 members and divided into four subfamilies. TMPRSS2 and MSPL may be potential candidates for PEDV treatment. additional research is underway to determine whether other members of the hepsin/TMPRSS/enteropeptidase subfamily are able to activate PEDV emergence. TTSPs (TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1 and MSPL) activate PEDV entry into cells in the absence of trypsin. the level of viral mRNA increased in a dose-dependent manner in vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL, but not HAT and DESC1 at the stage of virus entry. TTSPs cleave and activate the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins. cleaved fragments of the S protein may induce subtle conformational changes. TMPRSS2 and MSPL could cleave PEDV S protein with the same size of cleavage fragments, but HAT and DESC1 could not. TMPRSS2 and MSPL facilitate the replication of the animal coronavirus PEDV and play a significant role in viral infection by promoting cell\u2013cell fusion and virus\u2013cell fusion. this study provides insights and novel method for enhancing viral titers, expanding virus production, and improving the adaptability of PEDV isolates in vitro."}
