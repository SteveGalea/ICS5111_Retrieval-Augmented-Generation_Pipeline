{"summary": "the 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea is the largest outbreak outside the Middle East since MERS was discovered in 2012. it was a single imported case after the patient travelled to endemic countries. the outbreak has presented yet another threat to global health security. health officials have a duty to strike a balance between the public\u2019s right to know and the individual\u2019s right to privacy. the key to successful health communications is trust between the health authorities and the citizens. the 2015 MERS outbreak is reminiscent of the 2003 SARS epidemic. the lessons learned about outbreak communication will help the Republic of Korea and other countries better prepare for any future imported cases of MERS and other emerging diseases."}
