{"summary": "LF has a high case fatality rate ranging from 1% in the community to over 60% in hospital settings [1, 4, 5]. LF has a high case fatality rate ranging from 1% in the community to over 60% in hospital settings [1, 4, 5]. LF has a high case fatality rate ranging from 1% in the community to over 60% in hospital settings. this work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions between January 2016 and March 2019. we estimate LF infectivity in terms of the reproduction number (R) and quantify the association between R and state rainfall. the data are publicly available from the weekly situation reports released by the NCDC. the \u2018rainfall\u2019 represents the state rainfall time series with lag of 4\u20139 months. the \u2018rainfall\u2019 represents the state rainfall time series with lag of 4\u20139 months. this lag term corresponds to the time interval between rainfall and the development of rodent population. the blue shading area represents the period with epidemic reported. the intrinsic growth rate is the in Eqn (1), which is estimated from the fitted growth models and used for R estimation. models with a positive partial R-squared (indicating fitting improvement) against the baseline AR(2) model will be selected for further analyses. we estimate the epidemiological features (parameters) of turning point () and reproduction number (R) via the selected models. the i-th selected model has a weight of wi. the model-averaged estimator is the weighted average of the estimates in each selected model, which has been well studied in previous work [16, 29]. t represents the average monthly rainfall of the previous t months from the turning point,, of the j-th region. the range of lag term, t, will be considered from 4 to 9 months. this is explained by the time interval between the peak of the rainfall and the peak of rodent population. the state rainfall records of each state were collected on monthly average basis from the historical records of the world weather online website [15]. panel (a) shows the monthly rainfall in five states in Nigeria. panel (b) shows the weekly number of LF cases in Nigeria. shaded area represents a weekly number of cases lower than 10. we select the model of lagged rainfall with the highest goodness-of-fit. the fitting significance is treated as the initiation of the quantitative association between state rainfall and the LF epidemic. four different nonlinear growth models are adopted to pinpoint the epidemiological features of each epidemic. models are selected by comparing the AIC to that of the baseline (or null) model. only the models with an AIC lower than the baseline model are considered for further analysis. the serial interval (i.e. the generation interval) is the time between the infections of two successive cases in a chain of transmission [21, 23\u201325]. the function h() represents the probability distribution of. h() is the moment generating function (MGF) of a probability distribution [21]. the model-averaged estimates are the univariate meta-analytical response against different regions (states) a P-value 0.05 is regarded as statistically significant. the association between rainfall and reproduction number is modelled by a linear mixed-effect regression (LMER) model. we calculate the percentage changing rate with different cumulative lags (t) from 4 to 9 months and estimate their significant levels. only the lag terms (t) with significant estimates are presented in this work. results and discussion The major LF epidemics usually occur in Nigeria between November and May of the following year. the estimated reproduction number (R) of the epidemics in different regions varies from 1.06 to 1.62. the state of Edo has the highest estimated R (1.62 in 2017\u201318 and 1.09 in 2018\u201319) and this state also has the largest number of LF cases in the epidemics of both 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319 (36.0% of all cases).
