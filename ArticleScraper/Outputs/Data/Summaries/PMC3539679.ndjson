{"summary": "innate immunity plays key roles in activation and orientation of adaptive immunity. receptors recognize microbes or microbial moieties collectively named pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs; Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2010). PRMs can sense endogenous ligands termed \u201cdanger-associated molecular patterns\u201d. pentraxins are pivotal components of the humoral arm of innate immunity with a distinctive multimeric structure. pentraxins are divided into two groups: short and long pentraxins. pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and other subsequently identified proteins represent the long pentraxin arm of the family. pentraxins are characterized by the presence in their carboxy-terminal region of a 200 amino acid domain containing a highly conserved motif known as pentraxin signature (HxCxS/TWxS, where x is any amino acid) in the 1930s, CRP was the first purified PRM, which was named after its ability to bind in a calcium-dependent fashion the C-polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae. studies report microheterogeneity of the glycosidic moiety of SAP due to loss of one or both terminal sialic acid residues. it is proposed that the loss of sialic acid might cause a reorientation of SAP oligosaccharides, which in turn induces conformational changes in the protein tertiary and quaternary structure. CRP recognizes additional pathogens, including fungi, yeasts, and bacteria, thus promoting phagocytosis and resistance to infection. CRP transgenic mice are resistant to infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. it has been suggested that complement activation by short pentraxins might favor removal of the apoptotic debris. it has been suggested that complement activation by short pentraxins might favor removal of the apoptotic debris, with potential implications inpreventing the onset of autoimmune diseases. long pentraxin subfamily has been identified, including guinea pig apexin. neuronal pentraxin 1 (NPTX1 or NP1; Omeis et al., 1996), neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) and the transmembrane protein neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPTXR; Dodds et al., 1997). inflammatory signals induce PTX3 production in endothelial cells and human primary vascular smooth muscle cells. similar inflammatory signals induce PTX3 expression in other cell types. PTX3 is constitutively stored in the specific granules of neutrophils. IL-4, dexamethasone, 1, 25-dihydroxivitamin D3 and prostaglandin E2 also inhibit PTX3 expression in myeloid DCs. PTX3 expression in a model of acute myocardial ischemia is controlled by the NF-B pathway. induction of the protein by TNF- in lung epithelial cells involves the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. PTX3 is composed of a unique N-terminal region and a 203 amino acid C-terminal domain homologous to the short pentraxins CRP and SAP. positions of the Cys residues, the N-glycosylation site at Asn220 and the pentraxin signature motif are indicated. the PTX3 oligosaccharides can adopt different conformations (orange, green, and purple) terminal residues of sialic acid can contact specific amino acids (ball-and-stick) at the protein surface. the N-terminal region (residues 18\u2013178 of the preprotein) is unrelated to any known protein structure. PTX3 oligosaccharides make contacts to polar and basic amino acids at the protein surface (i.e., Lys214, Glu252, Lys255, and Arg332) mainly through terminal residues of sialic acid. these interactions are lost when sialic acid is removed and protein sites become accessible that are potentially relevant to ligands recognition and/or modifications of the PTX3 tertiary/quaternary structure. oligomeric state and asymmetric shape of the molecule make PTX3 unique amongst pentraxins. it displays pseudo 4-fold symmetry along its longitudinal axis. the structural determinants of the PTX3 quaternary organization are mainly localized in the protein N-terminal domain. pentraxin 3 expression is rapidly induced in a variety of additional cell types by several stimuli. inflammatory signals induce PTX3 production in endothelial cells and human primary vascular smooth muscle cells. PTX3 is constitutively stored in the specific granules of neutrophils. IL-4, dexamethasone, 1, 25-dihydroxivitamin D3 and prostaglandin E2 also inhibit PTX3 expression in myeloid DCs. PTX3 expression in a model of acute myocardial ischemia is controlled by the NF-B pathway. production of PTX3 in endothelial cells that is induced by high-density lipoproteins requires the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway PTX3 primary sequence is highly conserved among animal species. PTX3 is composed of a unique N-terminal region and a 203 amino acid C-terminal domain homologous to short pentraxins CRP and SAP. positions of the Cys residues, the N-glycosylation site at Asn220 and the pentraxin signature motif are indicated. the -helical segments of the N-terminal domain are depicted as yellow rods. the PTX3 oligosaccharides can adopt different conformations (orange, green, and purple), where terminal residues of sialic acid can contact specific amino acids (ball-and-stick) at the protein surface. the N-terminal region is unrelated to any known protein structure. a single N-glycosylation site has been identified in the C-terminal domain of PTX3 at Asn220. this is fully occupied by complex type oligosaccharides, mainly fucosylated and sialylated biantennary sugars. this is fully occupied by complex type oligosaccharides, mainly fucosylated and sialylated biantennary sugars with a minor fraction of tri- and scopy (EM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) have generated a low-resolution model of the protein that shows the composing subunits to fold into an elongated structure. this oligomeric state and the asymmetric shape of the molecule make PTX3 unique amongst pentraxins. this region mediates the association of protomers into tetramers via both covalent (i.e., disulfide bonds PTX3 Complement components C1q + + + Factor H + NT + C4BP + + + + M-, L-ficolin + - + MBL - + + Extracellular matrix proteins TNF-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) NT NT + Inter-trypsin-inhibitor (II) NT + Hyaluronan NT - Laminin + + - Collagen IV NT + - Fibronectin + PTX3 binds to plastic-immobilized C1q (Nauta et al., 2003a; Roumenina et al., 2006), and does not require previous aggregation of PTX3. other components of the classical pathway of complement, such as C3 and C4, are not recognized by PTX3. membrane-associated PTX3 acts as an \u201ceat-me\u201d molecule in promoting phagocytosis of late apoptotic neutrophils. PTX3 fosters rapid clearance of apoptotic T cells by peritoneal macrophages. PTX3 is a stronger inhibitor of the C1q hemolytic activity. sialylation of the PTX3 oligosaccharides might provide a strategy to fine tune both the activating and inhibitory activities of this long pentraxin on the classical complement cascade. a number of somatic and immune cell types produce PTX3 at sites of infection/inflammation. ficolin-1-dependent deposition of complement components on the surface of A. fumigatus is enhanced by PTX3. PTX3 triggers ficolin-1-dependent activation of the lectin complement pathway. ficolin-2-dependent deposition of complement components on the surface of A. fumigatus is enhanced. formation of the MBL\u2013PTX3 complex recruits C1q to Candida albicans and enhances C4 and C3 deposition as well as phagocytosis of this pathogen. PTX3 interacts with factor H, the main soluble regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation, and with the classical and lectin pathway regulator C4b-binding protein. interaction of PTX3 with C4BP occurs without interfering with cofactor activity of C4BP in the fluid phase. PTX3 can recruit both complement regulators, FH and C4BP, to limit excessive complement activation on apoptotic cells. PTX3 can also modulate inflammation in sterile conditions. lack of PTX3 promotes autoimmune lung damage in mice. deficiency of PTX3 on an apolipoprotein E knock-out background is associated with increased atherosclerosis, macrophage accumulation within the plaque and a more pronounced inflammatory profile in the vascular wall. the protective role exerted by PTX3 in the lung injury and pleurisy models is selectively linked to the capacity of PTX3 to bind P-selectin. lack of PTX3 glycosylation reversed the inhibitory effect of the wild-type molecule in the pleurisy model. lack of PTX3 on lupus prone genetic background (B6lpr) accelerates the evolution of autoimmune lung disease. pentraxin 3 interacts with selected microbes, including fungi like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, paracoccidioides brasiliensis and conidia from A. fumigatus. the binding of PTX3 to A. fumigatus conidia is abolished in the presence of galactomannan. treatment with recombinant PTX3 or neutrophil-associated PTX3 reverses this phenotype in vitro and in vivo. the molecular mechanisms underlying the opsonic activity of PTX3 and increased phagocytosis of conidia by neutrophils involve Fc receptor II (FcRII)-, CD11b-, and complement-dependent mechanisms (Moalli et al., 2010). pentraxin 3 binds to the outer membrane protein A (KpOmpA), a major component of the outer membrane of Klebsiella pneumoniae. it interacts with different cellular PRMs, such as scavenger receptor lectin-like oxidized lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) and scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cell-I (SREC-I), and TLR2. PTX3 binds to plastic-immobilized C1q (Nauta et al., 2003a; Roumenina et al., 2006). PTX3 binds to plastic-immobilized C1q (Nauta et al., 2003a; Nauta et al., 2003a; Roumenina et al., 2006). X3, an experimental condition that mimics the surface of microbes, results in activation of the classical complement cascade, assessed as C3 and C4 deposition. the presence of PTX3 in solution causes a dose-dependent inhibition of the C1q hemolytic activity. the apparent ambivalence of PTX3 might have important implications in apoptosis. molecule in promoting phagocytosis of late apoptotic neutrophils. soluble form of PTX3 inhibits this process by peritoneal macrophages. either desialylation or complete deglycosylation of the long pentraxin increases binding to C1q. ficolin-2 and ficolin-1 bind PTX3 in a calcium-dependent fashion through their fibrinogen (FBG)-like domain. ficolin-1 and -2 bind PTX3 in a calcium-dependent fashion through their fibrinogen (FBG)-like domain. mutants of ficolin-1 display defective recognition of PTX3. PTX3 and ficolin-2 may recruit each other to the surface of recognized microbes and amplify synergistically complement-mediated innate responses. PTX3 triggers ficolin-1-dependent activation of the lectin complement pathway. this interaction occurs in a calcium-dependent manner. two binding sites for PTX3 are present on FH. primary binding site is located on SCR domains 19\u201320. secondary site on SCR7 binds the glycosylated PTX3 pentraxin domain. PTX3-bound factor H remains functionally active. PTX3 can recruit both complement regulators, FH and C4BP, to limit excessive complement activation on apoptotic cells. interplay with key components of the three complement pathways points to PTX3 as an important player of the complex network of interactions that control complement functions. PTX3 may exert a dual role and contrasting effects on complement activation. it supports clearance of material that is able to bind PTX3, such as microbes, while on the other hand it may protect against unwanted complement activation in the fluid phase. the apparent ambivalence of PTX3 might have important implications in apoptosis. glycosylation status of PTX3 modulates protein interaction with C1q. either desialylation or complete deglycosylation of the long pentraxin increase binding to C1q. sialylation of the PTX3 oligosaccharides might provide a strategy to fine tune both the activating and inhibitory activities of this long pentraxin on the classical complement cascade. Desialylated PTX3 has higher affinity for C1q but loses recognition of ficolin-1 and influenza virus (c) ficolin-2 and ficolin-1 are major soluble receptors of the lectin pathway of complement. both ficolins are ligands of the lectin pathway of complement. PTX3 and ficolin-2 may recruit each other to the surface of recognized microbes and amplify synergistically complement-mediated innate responses. PTX3 triggers ficolin-1-dependent activation of the lectin complement pathway. the potential physiological implications of this interaction remain to be determined. a secondary site on SCR7 binds the glycosylated PTX3 pentraxin domain. PTX3-bound factor H remains functionally active, and PTX3 enhances factor H and iC3b deposition on apoptotic cells. the interaction with FH is strongly affected by PTX3 glycosylation. PTX3 plasma levels increase rapidly and dramatically in different pathological contexts. overexpression of PTX3 confers to Tg mice greater resistance to LPS toxicity. lack of PTX3 promotes autoimmune lung damage in mice. PTX3 is deleterious in a model of ischemia and reperfusion of the superior mesenteric artery, increasing tissue damage and mortality. PTX3 binds to dying neurons, rescuing them from irreversible damage and thus conferring resistance to neurodegeneration. lack of PTX3 glycosylation reversed the inhibitory effect of the wild-type molecule in the pleurisy model. therefore, the regulatory function of PTX3 on inflammation is mediated by the protein glycosidic moiety, which is reminiscent of some properties of the immunoglobulins. lack of PTX3 on lupus prone genetic background (B6lpr) accelerates the evolution of autoimmune lung disease. the binding of PTX3 to A. fumigatus conidia is abolished in the presence of galactomannan, a major constituent of the conidium wall, but not in the presence of dextran, galactose, fucose, or mannose. a direct interaction between PTX3 and galactomannan has not been proved as yet. PTX3-dependent recognition and phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa involves the interplay with complement and FcRs. PTX3 binds to the outer membrane protein A (KpOmpA), a major component of the outer membrane of Klebsiella pneumoniae. PTX3-deficient mice are more susceptible to MCMV infection than wild-type mice. recent studies also showed that PTX3 binds to coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-1/3 and reduced infectivity of MHV-1 in vitro. PTX3 and INFLUENZA VIRUS Pentraxin 3 acts as a sialylated glycoprotein inhibitor of IAVs both in vitro and in vivo. binding of the viral HA to PTX3 also blocks the enzyme function of the viral neuraminidase (NA), the other major surface glycoprotein of IAV. PTX3 is not recognized by IAV and its anti-IAV activity is lost. ficolins-1/2/3 bind IAV to neutralize virus infectivity. PTX3 may also potentiate anti-IAV activity of other innate immune proteins. recombinant PTX3 expressing Neu5Ac2-3Gal may be one factor driving evolution of human IAV. PTX3 may be one factor driving evolution of human IAV with dual specificity toward preferential recognition of Neu5Ac2-6Gal. al mediates potent anti-IAV activity against certain H3N2, but not H1N1 virus strains in vitro. the viral NA plays a critical role in determining PTX3 sensitivity. PTX3 preparations from human DCs and fibroblasts show heterogeneity in the relative amounts of bi-, tri-, and tetrantennary glycans. pentraxin 3 is an evolutionary conserved element of the humoral arm of the innate immune system. it plays a non-redundant role in resistance against selected pathogens. it binds microbial moieties (Jeannin et al., 2005), orchestrates complement activation (Doni et al., 2012), and has opsonic activity. PTX3 and immunoglobulins share fundamental mechanisms of activity, including agglutination, complement activation, opsonization, and glycosylation-dependent regulation of inflammation. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
