{"summary": "members of the family Birnaviridae have 2-segmented genomes. the genus is the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus. the genus comprises marine aquatic birnaviruses (MABV) of fish and shellfish. the physical, antigenic, and genetic features of the VP2/NS junction region of the aquatic birnavirus GC1 isolated from the rockfish Sebastes (S.) schlegeli have been studied. we compared the genetic relationship between aquatic birnaviruses and other genuses within family Birnaviridae. sources of VP1 sequence cited in this study are listed in Table 1. ethidium bromide-stained PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. gel purified and then cloned into pCR2.1 TA cloning vectors according to manufacturer's instructions. seven primer pairs were used for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) the oligonucleotide sequences were deduced according to the published dsRNA sequences of the Western Buxton strains. RT-PCR solution was heated to 95\u00b0C for 3 min and passed through 35 cycles. nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed by Vector NTI ver 10.0. the nucleotide sequence of GC1 was found to be 2,776 bp long. the VP1 protein starts at nucleotide 101 and ends with a single TAA termination codon. GC1 shares 97-98% homology with MABVs; 86% homology with the IPNV strains of aquabirnaviruses from the USA, Japan, and Korea; 87-89% homology with the IPNV strains of aquabirnaviruses from Spain; 46-47% homology with the avibirnaviruses. phylogenetic relationships among the 22 birnaviruses were established. the viruses, including GC1, were clustered into 5 genogroups. the cladogram represents phylogenetic relationships between birnaviruses based on deduced amino acid sequences. the VP1 amino acid sequence was scanned for several functional motifs. there were 8 potential Ser phosphorylation sites and 1 Tyr phophorylation site. the VP1 amino acid sequence was scanned for several functional motifs. GC1 shares 97-98% homology with MABVs; 94% homology with the IPNV strains of aquabirnaviruses from Spain; 46-47% homology with the avibirnaviruses; and 29% homology with the entomobirnaviruses. viral B segment encodes VP1, which is approximately 90 kDa in weight. molecular weight of GC1 has been estimated as 94 kDa. similar to that of the jasper strain. study of genetic relationships using a phylogenetic cladogram revealed that GC1 is more closely related to genogroup 1 than genogroup 2. this result indicates that genetic relationships may be influenced by the geographical distribution of the isolates."}
