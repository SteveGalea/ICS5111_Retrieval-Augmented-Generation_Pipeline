{"summary": "dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus, is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. causes large epidemics and endemic transmission in nonimmune populations. some high-income countries (HICs) or states such as aruba, Brunei Darussalam, Puerto Rico, and Singapore experience dengue-endemic. the dengue vector is established in 47 of the 76 HICs listed by the world bank. 29 have neither a dengue vector nor local DENV transmission. nineteen of the 47 HICs have reported only imported cases of dengue. both states contain areas where Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.), the principal vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, is established. Singapore and Taiwan are dengue-endemic and -nonendemic countries, respectively. table 1 presents epidemiological data for dengue infection in Queensland (Australia), Florida (US), Singapore, and Taiwan. the burden of dengue fever highlights the number of locally acquired cases in Queensland (Australia), Florida (US), Singapore, and Taiwan. 1,314 1,042 73 (5.56) 26.58 6 (0.46) 1 (0.11)

appeared in the Australian Medical Journal in 1873. comorbidity (diabetes, alcoholism, alcoholism) contributed to the severity of dengue. since the early 1990s, DENV outbreaks have increased in severity, frequency, and length in northeast Australia. the risk of local transmission is currently restricted to northeast of Queensland. the largest number of locally acquired dengue cases (over 1,000 cases) recorded in Queensland occurred from 2008\u20132009 [32] the number of locally acquired dengue cases has surged since the 1990s. a retrospective case-control study was performed for the period 01 January to 31 September 2004. in 2005, 14,006 cases were reported, and about 80% were among adults. in 2013, there was a record 22,248 reported dengue cases, with 842 cases in a single week. the risk of acquired dengue for nonimmune visitors ranged from 42/100,000 during a low season of a nonepidemic year to 1,700/100,000 during the high season of an epidemic year in Singapore [96] before 2014, the largest and most severe outbreak happened in 2002 (5,388 and 241 DHF cases) active surveillance from 2004\u20132007 reported a DENV seroprevalence of 1.1% (of 42,150 total cases) and 77% of cases as primary dengue. indirect costs consist of health care costs such as those related to consumption of resources like transport, and household expenditures. a delayed response to dengue outbreaks of 4\u20136 weeks would result in 86 times (or US$13 million in 2003) and 346 times (or US$382 million in 2009) higher dengue illness costs versus a scenario with active surveillance and response within 2 weeks. effective dengue surveillance and response lowers costs associated with dengue. people would pay US$22.8, US$102.3, and US$162.28 per year in order to avoid the increased probabilities of being infected with DENV. comorbidity (diabetes, alcoholism) contributed to the severity of dengue in old patients. early reports of dengue in Florida include outbreaks in the Dry Tortugas in 1903 and Miami in 1904 and 1908. since 1934 in Florida, and since 1945 in rest of continental US, no autochthonous dengue cases were reported until 2009. in 2009\u20132010, an outbreak of dengue was identified in Key West, southern Florida. the number of dengue cases has surged since the 1990s. a retrospective case-control study was performed for the period 01 January to 31 September 2004. in 2005, 14,006 cases were reported, and about 80% were among adults. since 2011, the centers of disease control, ROC (Taiwan) has reported more than 800 imported cases and 18,500 locally acquired dengue cases. most of these cases (53.4%) occurred in Tainan city and 44.5% in Kaohsiung city located in southern Taiwan. most of these cases (53.4%) occurred in Tainan city and 44.5% in Kaohsiung city located in southern Taiwan. since the early 1990s, DENV outbreaks have increased in severity, frequency, and length in northeast Australia. the risk of local transmission is currently restricted to northeast of Queensland. the largest number of locally acquired dengue cases (over 1,000 cases) recorded in Queensland occurred from 2008\u20132009 [32] Florida reported the largest number of locally acquired dengue cases (n = 97) with peaks in 2010 (60%) and 2013 (25%). in 2011 and 2012, only isolated cases of autochthonous DENV transmission were reported in Florida. by late September, a total of 22 locally acquired dengue cases were reported. in 2013, there was a record 22,248 reported dengue cases. the risk of acquired dengue for nonimmune visitors ranged from 42/100,000 during a low season of a nonepidemic year to 1,700/100,000 during the high season of an epidemic year in Singapore. before 2014, the largest and most severe outbreak happened in 2002 (5,388 and 241 DHF cases) active surveillance from 2004\u20132007 reported a DENV seroprevalence of 1.1% (of 42,150 total cases) and 77% of cases as primary dengue. indirect costs consist of health care costs such as those related to health care, non-health care costs. a delayed response to dengue outbreaks of 4\u20136 weeks would result in 86 times (or US$13 million in 2003) and 346 times (or US$382

people would pay US$22.8, US$102.3, and US$162.28 per year in order to avoid the increased probabilities of being infected with DENV. from 1990 to 2008, the cost of lost work and the control cost averaged an estimated US$36.18 million (2.01 million per annum) from 1990 to 2008, the cost of lost work and the control cost averaged an estimated US$36.18 million (2.01 million per annum) gue cases were the highest in Singapore (direct costs: $2,455, indirect costs: $1,821 in 2010 US dollars) in 2000 to 2009, the average economic impact of dengue illness in constant 2010 US dollars ranged from $0.85 billion to $1.15 billion. the probability of being infected by DENV due to climate change ranges from 12% to 43% to 87%. Ae. albopictus and Ae. albopictus are present in Queensland, Florida, Singapore, and Taiwan. the former is not yet established in Monroe County, Florida [119] or in mainland Queensland, where Ae. aegypti is prevalent. aegypti is more abundant in the early dry season than in the late wet season. the latter species may sustain DENV during interepidemic periods. a reduction in the number of large water storage containers likely reduced Ae. aegypti. the potential for vector transportation and virus transmission has increased substantially. in Queensland, Florida, and Taiwan, the arrival of viremic travelers is currently necessary for local transmission. in the united states, Miami, Florida is the most used airport in terms of the number of international passengers boarding American carriers. in australia, 23% originated overseas from 1991 to 1999 and 64% from 2000 to 2012. between 1995 and 2011, the main sources of dengue importation in Australia were from neighboring dengue-endemic countries such as papua new Guinea, papua new Guinea, papua new Guinea, Thailand, East Timor and the Philippines. new apartment blocks are being replaced with screening and air conditioning in Cairns and other far North Queensland centers. these should limit dengue transmission because avoidance of mosquito bites effectively prevents transmission [149] in Queensland, sites such as backpacker hostels are identified as \u201cignition\u201d or starting points, whereas centers where communities congregate are identified as \u201cdissemination\u201d points. free standing properties constituted 70%, 19%, and 11% of the dengue cases. a higher level of urbanization was also associated with increased risk of dengue fever at the township level. it is unclear why the 2015 outbreak clustered in Tainan city. in the laboratory, dry periods cause disproportionately greater mortality of Ae. albopictus eggs compared to Ae. aegypti eggs [163]. in the laboratory, dry periods cause disproportionately greater mortality of Ae. albopictus eggs compared to Ae. aegypti eggs [163]. in the laboratory, dry periods cause disproportionately greater mortality of Ae. albopictus eggs. large areas of standing water accumulated in some parks after flooding and only drained for two to three weeks may have been the primary breeding areas for mosquitoes that sustained the epidemic. regulations mandate or recommend measures to prevent mosquito breeding in tanks, including flap valves and screens with mesh size of no more than 1 mm [169] Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti are present in Queensland, Florida, Singapore, and Taiwan. the former is not yet established in Monroe County, Florida or in mainland Queensland. fewer Ae. aegypti than Ae. albopictus progeny are infected vertically. vertical transmission of DENV-1 from infected female mosquitoes to their eggs may have served as an interepidemic reservoir. three overwinter outbreaks occurred from 1987\u20131988. the potential for vector transportation and virus transmission and spread has increased substantially. in Queensland, Florida, and Taiwan, the arrival of viremic travelers is currently necessary for local transmission. in australia, dengue is now more often diagnosed than malaria in ill travelers who have returned from tropical regions (except Africa) a known source, 23% originated overseas from 1991 to 1999 and 64% from 2000 to 2012. the main sources of dengue importation in australia were from neighboring dengue-endemic countries such as papua new Guinea, papua new Guinea and papua new Guinea. the neighboring dengue-endemic countries Indonesia and Malaysia were the two main sources of dengue importations. the 2006 census shows that the main countries of origins of new Queensland residents were the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, Philippines, Korea, and Papua new Guinea. the 2006 census shows that the main countries of origins of new Queensland residents were the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, Philippines, Korea, and papua new Guinea. the 2006 census shows that the main countries of origins of new Queensland residents were the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, Philippines, Korea, and papua new Guinea. a higher level of urbanization was also associated with increased risk of dengue fever. it is unclear why the 2015 outbreak clustered intensively in Tainan city. a persistent problem of illegal dumping of garbage in local parks possibly contributed through pooling of water. in the laboratory, dry periods cause disproportionately greater mortality of Ae. albopictus eggs compared to Ae. aegypti eggs [163]. in the laboratory, dry periods cause disproportionately greater mortality of Ae. albopictus eggs compared to Ae. aegypti eggs [163]. in the laboratory, dry periods cause disproportionately greater mortality of Ae. albopictus eggs compared to Ae. ae regulations and guidelines mandate or recommend measures to prevent mosquito breeding in tanks. in north Queensland, dengue transmission is also associated with unscreened rainwater tanks. anthropogenic environmental changes have caused anthropogenic environmental changes. the CDC and the department of agriculture cosponsored a meeting of experts to develop guidelines for the surveillance, prevention, and control of west Nile virus and other arboviruses [175]. During the Key West outbreaks, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) used all means available to reduce the populations of Ae. aegypti. the national environment agency adopts a multipronged approach to control dengue. the strategies include active surveillance in areas prone to dengue or where mosquito populations are high, and source reduction when cases are reported. biocontrol approaches may impose evolutionary selective pressures on the virus and vectors. as of august 2014, the NEA has inspected 1.9 million houses or premises. it has deployed more than 1,000 gravitraps in dengue clusters for mosquito-control purposes. since march 14, 2016, owners of homes found to be breeding mosquitoes are fined US$148. fever screening at the airport has been successful in identifying 45% of 542 known imported dengue cases with fever. pyrethroids are also used to control Ae. aegypti and thus suppress epidemics in Taiwan. local residents in Singapore also have the opportunity to volunteer in efforts to control dengue. a smartphone application is available to encourage citizens to identify and report potential breeding sites of Aedes mosquitoes. aegypti, albopictus and ae. albopictus have lost 172 full-time positions in health departments. entomologist Vasquez spends a $1.6 million budget a year, enough for 15 employees. the mosquito-control district of Florida\u2019s Miami Dade County has 2.6 million people. public health authorities in north Queensland have intensified surveillance, control, and education programs. the use of indoor residual spraying targeting resting sites of Ae. aegypti has significantly decreased dengue transmission in Cairns. vector control activities include spraying adulticides within a 200 m radius around homes of case-patients, outdoor residual and spatial insecticide treatments, and finding and eliminating mosquito breeding sites. a 2012 survey of the decision makers involved in the control of the outbreak revealed the need to focus prevention strategies on educational campaigns. biocontrol approaches may impose selective pressures on the virus and vectors. the NEA has inspected 1.9 million homes and has deployed more than 1,000 gravitraps in dengue clusters for mosquito-control purposes. since march 14, 2016, the owners of homes found to be breeding mosquitoes are fined US$148 (in 2016 US dollars) NEA improved its dengue control by i) increasing inspections by creating dedicated construction site teams. iii) publishing list of sites issued with stop-work orders on the dengue microsite to serve as a deterrent to contractors. iii) requesting contractors to put in place temperature-screening regime to identify cases earlier. public health authorities in north Queensland have intensified surveillance, control, and education programs. surveillance activities include larval and adult control within a 200 m radius of the case residence and high-risk contact areas. the use of indoor residual spraying targeting resting sites of Ae. aegypti has significantly decreased dengue transmission in Cairns. activities include spraying adulticides within a 200 m radius around homes of case-patients, outdoor residual and spatial insecticide treatments, and finding and eliminating mosquito breeding sites. a 2012 survey of the decision makers involved in the control of the outbreak

sources of infection other than registered residential addresses. dengue microsite to serve as a deterrent to contractors. iii) requesting contractors to put in place temperature-screening regime to identify cases earlier. iv) encouraging application of insect repellent and v) for dengue-infected workers. habitats [193] involve the community in mosquito control through environmental management, health education, and community ownership. the community-based approach can be slow or demotivating and, as a consequence, unsustainable [195] the community-based approach can be slow or demotivating. some countries, including australia, do not have access to this application. in the us, public health budget cuts have also impaired vector surveillance and control programs. in the us, public health budget cuts have also impaired vector surveillance and control programs. early recognition and notification of dengue cases is critical to reduce medical complications and mortality among patients with severe forms of dengue [206] in the key west 2009\u20132010 outbreak, initial cases were attributed by local physicians to nonspecific viral illness without consideration of dengue [207]. in the key west 2009\u20132010 outbreak, initial cases were attributed by local physicians to nonspecific viral illness without consideration of dengue [207], and the failure of diagnosis and reporting led to delayed detection of DENV introduction. the four countries and states are surrounded by dengue-endemic countries. both Taiwan and Singapore are highly populated and urbanized. both Florida and Queensland are particularly at risk for autochthonous dengue outbreaks due to its nonimmune populations. the countries and states presented in this review have in common i) a competent mosquito vector, ii) introduction of DENV by travelers, iii) increased local transmission of dengue coinciding with population growth and increased mobility, iv) recent budget cuts impacting public health services, and v) a largely nonimmune population. deaths are rare in australia, and absent in Florida, but occur often in Singapore and Taiwan. the recent epidemiology of dengue in Singapore was characterized by a 5\u20136-year cycle [9,56] but since 2013 in Singapore, the incidence rates have markedly increased. in far North Queensland, the number of dengue fever cases in 2015 was 33% lower than the total dengue cases in 2014 [36] control network low herd immunity transmission associated with unscreened housing budget cuts cryptic sites can produce large numbers of Ae. aegypti population growth and movement increase in rainwater tank usage lack of awareness and engagement of residents/tourists. a communicable disease center in Australia is critical for managing and lowering future disease risks. low herd immunity budget cuts usually fines not imposed when breeding sites found population growth and movement lack of awareness and engagement of residents/tourists Singapore proximity to other endemic countries all serotypes circulating and high diversity low herd immunity resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in dengue vectors shift from domestic to nondomestic transmission virus importation by tourists and migrant workers important air traffic/travel population growth and movement high level of urbanization lack of awareness and engagement of residents/tourist re-emergence of dengue in Florida underscores need for strong vector-borne disease surveillance and mosquito-control infrastructure. some strains of Wolbachia can reduce Ae. aegypti lifespan and reproduction. some strains of Wolbachia can interfere with DENV replication and transmission. the development of a climate-driven climate-driven model of early dengue fever warning in southern Taiwan is essential to inform disease prevention and control interventions. the analysis provides the required \u201cone-week-ahead\u201d outbreak warnings based on spatiotemporal predictions of dengue fever distributions. CYD-TDV is a live recombinant tetravalent dengue vaccine. it has been evaluated as a three-dose series on a 0/6/12 month schedule. it is currently being reviewed by around 20 countries in Asia and Latin America. the virulent wMelPop strain has been shown to cause widespread degeneration of tissues and early death in Ae. aegypti adults [220] and eggs [221] but failed to establish following field releases. wMelPop has persisted for at least five years in seven Cairns suburbs. low cost tools for dengue forecasting could be used to enhance decision making on timing and scale of vector control programs. models may also under- or overestimate the projected incidence. global models are not necessarily appropriate for small-scale projections. a single model for disease control is unlikely to be applicable in all settings. the epidemiology of dengue will continue to change. the epidemiology of dengue will continue to change. dengue prevention and 35 years of vector control in Singapore. lack of awareness and engagement of residents/tourists/migrant workers. dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0966-842X(01)02288-0. dengue prevention and 35 years of vector control in Singapore."}
