{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a member of the genus Betacoronavirus, emerged in 2002 in southern china. its subsequent spread, mainly in Asia, wrecked massive economic havoc. another betacoronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, emerged in 2012 and causes a SARS-like disease. a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 but not a cysteine protease inhibitor active against cathepsin B/L protected rodents from influenza A viruses. TMPRSS2 expression is required for spread of several influenza A viruses in mice [16\u201318] and that polymorphisms in TMPRSS2 impact severity of influenza in human patients. cleavage of SARS S at this site could not be visualized so far. it is at present unknown where SARS S is cleaved by TMPRSS2 for S protein activation. however, it is at present unknown where SARS S is cleaved for cleavage by TMPRSS2. plasmids encoding SARS S and TMPRSS2 or empty plasmid were transfected into 293T cells using the CaPO method. plasmids encoding SARS S and TMPRSS2 or empty plasmid were transfected into 293T cells using the CaPO method. cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE healthcare) full length SARS S protein and cleavage fragments thereof were detected by staining with an anti-V5 antibody (Novex) and anti-mouse-HRP (Dianova) as secondary antibody. cells transfected to express SARS S in the presence or absence of TMPRSS2 or treated with trypsin were pelleted by centrifugation at 1, cell washed twice with PBS after 6 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. cells were fixed and stained using mouse monoclonal IgG2a anti-V5 (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) as secondary antibody. 293T target cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with plasmids encoding ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2. at 48 h posttransfection cells were harvested and luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured using a commercially available kit. plasmids encoding SARS S and TMPRSS2 or empty plasmid were transfected into 293T cells using the CaPO method. plasmids encoding SARS S and TMPRSS2 or empty plasmid were transfected into 293T cells using the CaPO method. cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE healthcare) full length SARS S protein and cleavage fragments thereof containing the SARS S C-terminus were detected by staining with an anti-V5 antibody (Novex) and anti-mouse-HRP (Dianova) as secondary antibody. cells transfected to express SARS S in the presence or absence of TMPRSS2 or treated with trypsin were cells were washed twice with PBS after 6 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. cells were fixed and stained using mouse monoclonal IgG2a anti-V5 (Invitrogen) as primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) as secondary antibody. fluorescence images were acquired and colored with the confocal laser scanning microscope. 293T target cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with plasmids encoding ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2. at 48 h posttransfection cells were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. at 60 h post transduction cells were harvested and luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured using a commercially available kit. Western blot employs anti-V5 antibody for S protein detection. cleavage of SARS S fragments reflects differences in amino acid sequence or N-glycosylation status. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. the black filled triangle indicates the SARS S cleavage product generated by trypsin. the product of SARS S processing by TMPRSS2 is marked by the white filled triangle. mutation of K543/R544 inhibited SARS S processing by trypsin. mutation of R563/K566 blocked SARS S cleavage by both trypsin and TMPRSS2. residue R667 but not R797 or T678 is required for SARS S cleavage. escence of transfected COS-7 cells coexpressing SARS S wt and mutants targeted to the plasma membrane revealed that mutants R667A, T678S and R797N were trafficked to the cell surface. in contrast, mutation of residues K543/R544 and R563/K566 resulted in intracellular retention of the mutant proteins. plasmid encoding YFP fused to a golgi marker (red color) the cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. similar results were obtained in a second independent experiment. mutation of K543/R544 and R563/K566 was not compatible with particle infectivity. transduction driven by other S protein mutants was roughly comparable to that measured for SARS wt. mutation of R667, T678, and R797 is compatible with robust S protein-driven cell entry. transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring luciferase activity in cell lysates. results were normalized for SARS S-driven transduction of ACE2 expressing cells. the average of three to eight independent experiments is shown. 293T target cells transfected with ACE2 plasmid or cotransfected with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 plasmid were pretreated with DMSO or the cathepsin B/L inhibitor MDL 28170 for 1 h. results were normalized for transduction of ACE2+, TMPRSS2- cells in the absence of inhibitor, which was set as 1-fold. kDa band increased upon reduction of TMPRSS2 expression. highest signals observed upon transfection of 0.03\u20130.01 g TMPRSS2 plasmid. incubation of SARS S expressing cells with trypsin produced a 100 kDa fragment. cells were treated with PNGaseF to remove all N-linked glycans. the asterisk indicates deglycosylated SARS S cleavage products. mutation of R563/K566 blocked SARS S cleavage by both trypsin and TMPRSS2. residue R667 but not R797 or T678 is required for SARS S cleavage by trypsin and trypsin. mutant proteins were slightly (mutants R667A, T678S) or markedly (R797N) higher than that observed for the wt protein. mutation of residues K543/R544 and R563/K566 resulted in intracellular retention of the mutant proteins. the results were confirmed in a second independent experiment. the experiment was carried out as described for panel A. but GFP fused to a Golgi marker was used instead of YFP with plasma membrane anchor. 293T cells transfected to express ACE2 were examined. mutation of K543/R544 and R563/K566 interferes with normal S protein trafficking and incorporation into retroviral particles. mutation of R667, T678, and R797 is compatible with robust S protein-driven cell entry. amino acids R667 and R797 are required for SARS S activation by TMPRSS2. for this, we cotransfected 293T target cells with ACE2 plasmid. we incubated the cells with DMSO or the cathepsin B/L inhibitor MDL 21870 before addition of SARS S-bearing particles. 2 plasmid were pretreated with DMSO or the cathepsin B/L inhibitor MDL 28170 for 1 h before addition of equal volumes of pseudotypes bearing the indicated glycoproteins. results were normalized for transduction of ACE2+, TMPRSS2- cells in the absence of inhibitor, which was set as 1-fold. cleavage fragments harboring the antibody target irrespective of the presence of the SARS S C-terminus. the major cleavage product observed in the present study exhibited a molecular weight of 85 kDa and comprised the entire S2 subunit. this fragment was increased when TMPRSS2 expression was decreased, suggesting that this fragment might be the major cleavage product generated under physiological conditions. trypsin and TMPRSS2 cleave SARS S at different sites during viral entry. trypsin generated a 100 kDa fragment while TMPRSS2 produced an 85 kDa fragment. differences in the size of the SARS S cleavage products generated by TMPRSS2 and trypsin were also observed in the present study. TMPRSS2 may process SARS S early after import in the constitutive secretory pathway and before N-glycans are fully processed. this defect is compatible with cleavage by TMPRSS2 but not trypsin (cleavage at the cell surface) previous studies showed that mutation of R667 abrogates SARS S activation by trypsin [20,22] while the present work demonstrates that this residue is dispensable for SARS S activation by TMPRSS2. cleavage at R797 occurs in trans but a cleavage fragment could not be detected, potentially due to its low stability. TMPRSS2 may allow for SARS S cleavage-activation at sites other than R667 and R797. cleavage and activation depend on different amino acid residues, R667 and R797. further work is required to elucidate their interplay in S protein activation for membrane fusion."}
