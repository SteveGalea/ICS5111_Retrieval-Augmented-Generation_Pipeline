{"summary": "the primary outcome measure was a determination of the rates of absenteeism caused by influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza. the study was performed over a 12-week period, February 16\u2013May 12, 2008. most schools in Cairo have 1 large restroom with 10 sinks and an additional 8\u201310 sinks on the playground. all children at the intervention schools, regardless of grade, were included in the hand hygiene campaign activities. the hand hygiene team ensured all predesigned activities for the hand hygiene campaign were implemented on a weekly basis. the school nurses and teachers were trained to interview students, collect absenteeism data, interview parents, and complete data collection forms. six independent social workers visited the schools weekly; each visited 10 schools per week (5 intervention and 5 control schools) they observed hand hygiene activities, soap and drying material availability and the process of students washing their hands during the school day. a student episode of absence caused by illness was defined as a student absent for any number of consecutive or nonconsecutive days during 1 calendar week. the incidence of absence due to illness was defined as the number of absences caused by illness per 100 student-weeks. the incidence of in-class illness was defined as the number of reported episodes of illness among the first 3 primary grade students per 100 student-weeks. the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU3) Institutional Review Board. a written letter describing the purpose of the study was distributed to the parents or guardians of all students in the first 3 primary grades. control schools received the same intervention program at the end of the study. average size of each classroom is 48 m2 with 69 students (0.7 m2/student) a total of 27 schools per group were adequate to detect this difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza. six independent social workers visited the intervention schools weekly. each visited 10 schools per week (5 intervention and 5 control schools) hand hygiene teams required students in the first 3 primary grades to wash their hands twice during the school day for 45 seconds. a teacher's guidebook included a detailed description of the students' activities. the primary message was to wash hands with soap and water upon arriving at school, before and after meals, after using the bathroom, and after coughing or sneezing. the incidence of in-class illness was defined as the number of reported in-class episodes of illness among the first 3 primary grade students per 100 student-weeks. children who were absent from school because of ILI were approached by the school nurse, who either visited the child at home or asked the child to visit the school clinic if they returned within 3 days of absence. the number of episodes of absenteeism or illness by the number of student-weeks was multiplied by 100 to obtain rates per 100 student-weeks. the answer was then multiplied by 100 to obtain rates per 100 student-weeks. Absences caused by ILI, diarrhea, and conjunctivitis were reduced by 40%, 33%, and 67%, respectively, in the intervention group. control and intervention schools reported 6,538 and 6,028 in-class illnesses, respectively. in the control and intervention schools, 881 cases (34.5%) of ILI were identified through in-class reported illness. 74.2% of these students (n = 654) were tested for influenza, of which 34.9% (n = 228) were positive. 790 cases (46.3%) of ILI in the intervention schools were identified through in-class reporting. the largest number of confirmed cases reported from any single school was from a control school. control schools were 1.6 (95% CI 1.1\u20132.2) more likely to report at least 1 confirmed case of influenza and 2.8 (95% CI 1.7\u20134.7) more likely to report multiple confirmed cases than intervention schools. the 21% reduction in absenteeism caused by illness in intervention schools is lower than the 42% observed among schoolchildren in the People\u2019s Republic of China (16) this study also demonstrates a decrease in laboratory-confirmed influenza as a result of an intensive hand hygiene campaign. this study also demonstrates a decrease in laboratory-confirmed influenza as a result of an intensive hand hygiene campaign. the incidence of ILIs decreased more than did diarrheal disease (40% vs 33%) in this study. previous studies have shown a greater reduction in diarrheal disease incidence, possibly because it is easier to adopt handwashing behaviors associated with diarrhea such as preparing/eating food. a relatively short duration of observation (12 weeks) may have led to an overestimation of effect. the use of rapid tests for diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed influenza with known low sensitivity likely resulted in an underestimation of illness in each group."}
