Western blot analysis of urinary ACE2 detected immunoreactive bands at 70 kDa in akita mice. this suggests the soluble form of ACE2 is the shed fragment of membrane-bound ACE2 (90 kDa, renal ACE2) this finding is in accord with two recent clinical studies showing ACE2 expression as three bands. treatment with ACEi or ARB diminished urinary albumin excretion but did not affect urinary ACE2 in type 2 diabetic db/db mice (58). urine specimens from 10-wk-old Akita mice were compared with 30-wk-old Akita mice. it was found younger animals had higher urinary ACE2 activity than older animals, indicating that with the progression of disease, the kidney is unable to maintain the same levels of renal ACE2. ACE2 has an endogenous renoprotective function due to its ability to degrade ANG II. it is assumed that ACE2 has an endogenous renoprotective function due to its ability to degrade ANG II, thereby reducing the deleterious ANG II-mediated effects in diabetes (47). the findings are in contrast to other studies reporting on decreased renal ACE2 expression and activity in diabetic mice. diabetes including akita mice (32), STZ mice (8), STZ rats (29, 49), and mouse models of chronic kidney disease (12) an increase in renal ACE2 in cortical tubules could be the earliest positive feedback response to hyperglycemia. we speculate that hyperglycemia decreases renal TIMP3 protein expression in human renal proximal tubular HK-2 cells. Western blotting performed in the present study revealed no significant difference in renal TIMP3 protein expression in Akita mice compared with WT mice. Interestingly, treatment with insulin decreased both urinary and renal ACE2 protein expression and activity in treated Akita mice. hyperglycemia increases renal ACE2 and ADAM17 expression in coalition with a rise in urinary ACE2 excretion mediated by ADAM17. the euglycemic effect of insulin decreased urinary ACE2 excretion, restored renal ACE2 and ADAM17 expression back to physiological levels, and normalized the rate of shedding.
