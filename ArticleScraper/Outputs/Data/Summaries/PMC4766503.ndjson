{"summary": "short peptide P9 exhibited the highest antiviral activity among mBD4-dervied peptides, smBD4 and rmBD4. their antiviral activity against influenza virus H1N1 was evaluated in MDCK cells. the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of P9 was 1.2 g/ml. antiviral activities of smBD4, rmBD4 and 11 short peptides (25 g/ml) against H1N1 viral infection were tested in MDCK cell cultures. white and black colors indicate that the virus was pretreated with peptides in PB and MEM, respectively. Zanamivir was included in the experiment as positive control. survival rate of mice i.n. inoculated with 25 l of PB (VC), P9 or rmBD4 (2 mg/ml) after the virus challenge was significantly higher than those of rmBD4-pretreated mice (20%, P 0.01) and untreated mice (0%, P 0.0001) survival rate in mice (60%) were significantly higher than those of untreated control. infected mice were detected by real-time RT-PCR and plaque assay. viral loads in lung tissues were significantly lower than those in untreated mice. alveolar damage and interstitial inflammatory infiltration in untreated mice were substantially more severe than those in untreated mice. i.n. inoculated with P9 (50 mg/kg) or intra-peritoneally (i.p.) injected with P9 (500 mg/kg) per day for 3 days. less than 10% of body weight loss was observed in the first 3 days. atants were similar to those of the untreated control when the cells were pretreated with P9 followed by infection. together, our results indicated that P9 inhibited viral infections through binding to viral surface glycoproteins. a green fluorescent label was pretreated with P9 and then incubated with the cells at 4 \u00b0C for 3 hours. the virus entered the cells through endocytosis after the virus was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour. the transport of the virus in endosomes from the cell periphery to the proximity of the nucleus was not affected. the cell membrane was stained by Alexa-594 dye and representative images were taken by confocal microscope (original magnification 400) the cell membrane was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h or 2 h. colocalization of virus (green) and P9 (red) was shown after incubation. confocal microscopic images indicated that pH lowering in endosomes was unaffected by P9-aci-1. if P9 acts through perturbation of pH lowering, the addition of acidic residues is expected to relieve the perturbation. the low pH in endosomes of infected cells was stained by pH-sensitive dye (pHrodo, red). representative images were taken by confocal microscope (original magnification 400). P9 showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against respiratory viruses in vitro and in vivo. mice were intratracheally (i.t.) inoculated with 50 l of PB (VC-P), Zanamivir (Zana-P) or P9 (P9-P) mice were i.n. treated by PB (VC-P), Zanamivir (Zana-P) or P9 (P9-P) after viral challenge. weight of all treated and untreated mice decreased at day 2 post-challenge. we compared the viral load in mouse lungs at day 3 post-infection. one dose of P9 for prophylaxis and 5 doses of P9 for therapy significantly inhibited virus infection in mouse lungs. selectivity index of P9 was 316, which was higher than those of smBD4 (87) and rmBD4 (240). smBD4, rmBD4 and 11 peptides derived from mBD4 exhibited the highest antiviral activity and selectivity index. so, P9 was selected for further studies. mice were intranasally (i.n.) inoculated with P9 (50 g/mouse) or rmBD4. the dose of 50 g/mouse was applied for animal experiments. survival rate of mice (100%) was significantly higher than those of rmBD4-pretreated mice (20%, P 0.01) and untreated mice (0%, P 0.0001) survival rates of mice i.n. treated with 25 l of PB (VC), P9 or rmBD4 (2 mg/ml) after virus challenge. Zanamivir (Zana, 2 mg/ml) was included as positive control. viral RNA copies and viral titers in lung tissues of infected mice were detected by real-time RT-PCR. the stability of P9 in vivo was evaluated by P9 biodistribution in mouse lungs. the signal decreased to almost undetectable level at 8 h after P9 administration. each mouse was i.n. inoculated with P9 (50 mg/kg) or intra-peritoneally (i.p.) injected with P9 (500 mg/kg) per day for 3 days. when P9 was supplemented to the culture medium at 1 hour after MDCK cells were infected with H1N1 virus (2 MOI), viral RNA copies inside the cells and in culture supernatants harvested at the indicated hours post-infection were comparable with those in the untreated control. the results suggested that P9 did not inhibit viral replication or release. all data are presented as means + SD of three independent experiments. binding of P9 to viral surface glycoprotein HA was detected by anti-mBD4 antibody. the viral RNA levels in the cells infected with the virus did not increase until 6.5 hours post-infection. these results implicated that P9 perturbed viral uncoating and viral RNA release from late endosomes. NH4Cl and Bafilomycin A1 are well-defined inhibitors of endosomal acidification21,22,23. however, Zanamivir did not show a similar antiviral kinetics in comparison to the endosomal acidification inhibitors. to confirm this, we detected the pH change in endosomes using a pH-sensitive dye. the inhibitory effect of P9 was similar to those of inhibitors of endosomal acidification. cells were infected with diO dye labeled virus (green) pretreated with PB (VC), P9, NH4Cl or Bafilomycin. P9 inhibited infections of influenza virus subtypes H3N2, H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9 in cells. IC50s are indicated by dotted lines. one dose of P9 for prophylaxis and 5 doses of P9 for therapy protected 50% and 50% of mice from lethal challenge of H7N9 virus. the treatment groups provided significantly more protection than the control group (P 0.01). the survival rates of mice treated with prophylactic and therapeutic Zanamivir were 60% and 70%. the production of recombinant BDs is hampered by high cost and low recovery rate. the antiviral activity of BDs might be mediated through either indirect interaction or direct interaction with viral glycoproteins and/or envelopes14,15. the antiviral function of P9 mediated through inhibition of endosomal acidification might be independent of the blocking of M2 ion channel. a short peptide derived from mBD4 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different subtypes of influenza virus. 3N2, H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9 as well as two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. the antiviral effect of P9 is mediated through the following mechanism: (1) P9 efficiently binds to viral particles via viral glycoproteins. (2) P9 is rich in basic amino acids, which prevent acidification in endosomes and inhibit viral RNA release. thus far, no effective antiviral drugs are available for patients 9849 and MERS-CoV strain hCoV-EMC/2012 were cultured in fetal rhesus monkey kidney (FRhK-4) and African green monkey kidney E6 (Vero-E6) cells. their titers were determined by plaque and TCID50 assays. codons of mBD4 were optimized to E. coli-preferred codons based on OPTIMIZER34. mBD4 and short peptides derived from mBD4 were designed as shown in Table 1. the purity and mass of each peptide were verified by HPLC and mass spectrometry. the cells were washed twice with PBS then added with 100 l/well of MEM with various concentrations of peptides. the plate was read at OD570 and OD640 using VictorTM X3 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer) mice were challenged with 3 LD50 of the virus and then i.n. inoculated with P9, rmBD4 or Zanamivir at 6 hours after the viral inoculation. survival and general conditions were monitored for 21 days or until death.
