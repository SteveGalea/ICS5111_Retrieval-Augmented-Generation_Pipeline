{"summary": "genetic analysis provides a window into the epidemic history of a pathogen. the ability to sequence pathogen genomes in real time, for example during the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti [5,6], foretells of the increasingly important role for genetic analysis during outbreak response. the advent of population-level whole genome sequencing has revealed previously unfathomed diversity in pathogenic bacteria. the advent of population-level whole genome sequencing has revealed previously unfathomed diversity in pathogenic bacteria [30], leading to wider interest in integrated approaches to genetics and epidemiology beyond rapidly evolving viruses such as HCV. pathogen populations are metapopulations because they exist as an aggregate of isolated subpopulations within individual hosts. we refer to infection of susceptible hosts as primary infection, and subsequent infection events as secondary infection. the key feature of a metapopulation that distinguishes it from other structured populations is the extinction of individual demes. in a simple SI model, the proportions of all hosts that are susceptible (S) and infectious (I) are modelled using differential equations. in the SIS model, infected individuals clear infection and return to the susceptible class at rate. in the SIS model, individuals that recover from infection become immune. in the SIS and SIR models, R0 determines the equilibrium prevalence. in the SIS model, R0 determines the equilibrium prevalence, whereas it determines the peak prevalence in the SIR model. the only extension to the basic models we make is to consider the dynamics of secondary infection. in the SIS model, hosts clear infection and return to the susceptible class at rate. in the SI model, the whole population is eventually infected. the key feature of a metapopulation that distinguishes it from other structured populations is the extinction of individual demes. in a simple SI model, the proportions of all hosts that are susceptible (S) and infectious (I) are modelled using differential equations. in the SIS model, infected individuals clear infection and return to the susceptible class at rate. in the SIS model, individuals that recover from infection become immune. effective population size The key parameter in a coalescent model is Ne, the effective population size, because it determines the coalescence rate. results (a) are consistent with the results of a simpler model. the SI and SIS models can be solved in closed form. for the SI model, the effective population size simplifies to 3.3. time is measured from the present (t = 0) back into the past (t > 0) model comparison and parameter estimation using BEAST were aided by the following re-parameterization: N0 = NH(1 S0 + log(S0)/(1)/(21S0), the effective population size at present, r0 = 1, the intrinsic growth rate, the rate of clearance and tpeak, the time since the epidemic peaked. in total, 18 datasets satisfied our incorporation criteria. we found that the strongest predictor of diversity was the age of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), followed by population density and subtype (figure 3). the overall predictive power of the regression was very high (R2 = 98.9%) epidemics with older TMRCA had substantially higher diversity as would be expected, whereas increased population density predicted a reduction in diversity. 222 2.73 0.081 0.9374 3a versus 1a 0.981 2.07 0.473 0.6507 4a versus 1a 12.6 3.68 3.41 0.0112 5a versus 1a 3.05 2.43 1.26 0.2495 6a versus 1a 4.33 2.01 2.15 0.0682 6f versus 1a 2.85 2.34 1.22 0.2631 Reconstructing historical changes in Ne revealed that most datasets exhibited strong exponential growth, consistent with the SI model (figure 4 inset for each dataset, the posterior probability (PP) of the underlying epidemiological model (SI, SIS or SIR) is shown as a bar chart. the PP for the endemic model is not shown because it was less than 0.2% for every dataset. RCA was dated to between 1915 and 1936, following which the number of infections grew rapidly with a doubling time between 3.6 and 6.7 years. the epidemic peaked some time between 1969 and 2002 and has fallen since. we dated the TMRCA to between 1955 and 1968. we estimated a doubling time between 1.4 and 3.6 years. we obtained similar estimates for R0 and average duration of infectivity. transmission per infection, m is the rate of secondary transmission per infection, NP is the rate of pathogen population size within a host and k is the number of genotypes transmitted during primary infection. e0 = 1S and m = 2I yield 3.2 where and where NH is the total number of hosts. the effective population size simplifies to 3.4 which is a logistic growth curve with parameters N0, r0 and t50 = log(r0/(1S0)1)/r0, the time at which Ne reached half its maximum. the growth curves describing changes in Ne are simpler than the underlying growth curves that describe changes in prevalence, and have one fewer parameter. a meta-analysis of hepatitis C was conducted using BEAST. we estimated N0 (the effective population size at the time of sampling) and r0 (the intrinsic) diversity varied considerably, ranging from = 20.3 to = 84.3 per kilobase. the strongest predictor of diversity was the age of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), followed by population density. results of the regression of genetic diversity against age of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), subtype, intrinsic growth rate (r0) and population density were not significantly associated with after accounting for the other effects. the endemic model was rejected outright for every dataset (PP 0.002) in 13 cases, the SI model was clearly preferred (PP = 0.62\u20130.99) in the subtype 1a dataset from Belgium, SI dynamics were most probable (PP = 0.44), but there was also support for the SIS and SIR models (PP = 0.20). only in one example\u2014subtype 3a in Belgium\u2014was the SIS model most probable (PP = 0.88) the TMRCA was dated to between 1915 and 1936. the epidemic peaked some time between 1969 and 2002 and has fallen since. subtype 6a is common in Hong Kong, accounting for 23.6 per cent of all HCV infections and 58.5 per cent of HCV infections in intravenous drug users. the rarity of HCV-6a in China led to the suggestion that HCV-6a was introduced from Vietnam, where it is dominant, during peaks of immigration around 1979 and 1992 [61]. we obtained similar estimates for basic reproductive numbers of 1.20 (95% CI 1.04\u20135.51), 1.44 (1.08\u201313.2) and 1.42 (1.07\u201319.0) in all three datasets. we compared the reconstructed prevalence in the three epidemics with contemporary estimates of point prevalence in the three sampling locations. we obtained similar estimates of R0 in the three epidemics (1.2\u20131.4) the duration of the infectious period that we estimated (1.2\u20131.6 years) was substantially shorter than the 10\u201330 years that have previously been supposed [16]. hepatitis C is chronic in 80 per cent of people and has lifelong infectivity. MCMC has been developed to fit stochastic, nonlinear dynamics to gene genealogies. the method is currently limited to simple birth\u2013death processes. random mixing is a common assumption in compartmental models of epidemiological dynamics that is difficult to justify empirically. we used a simple HKY85 substitution model [71], ignoring heterogeneity in the molecular clock rate between sites, codon positions and branches of the tree. however, detailed analyses suggest that such heterogeneity does occur in HCV [26,72] we directly compared the goodness-of-fit of endemic, SI, SIS and SIR models. in practice, a useful approach might be to include the non-parametric Bayesian skyline plot in the model comparison [72]. this would allow rejection of the parametric models if none adequately described the population history of the sample. the role of genetic analysis in real-time prediction of outbreaks will be to complement, but not replace, epidemiological approaches. with richer genetic data, it will become possible to detect microevolution on epidemiological timescales in many more pathogen species. equations (5.4) and (5.6) define a system of differential equations to be solved together. we implemented this as an extension to BEAST [36] in Java using a fifth-order Cash\u2013Karp Runge\u2013Kutta method. all the alignments that we analysed are available in the electronic supplementary material, text S2. for each of the 18 datasets that met our incorporation criteria, we calculated mean pairwise genetic diversity () and collated data on subtype, prevalence, host population size and population density. we obtained point estimates of TMRCA, N0 and r0 averaged over models. equations (5.4) and (5.6) define a system of differential equations to be solved together. we implemented this as an extension to BEAST [36] in Java using a fifth-order Cash\u2013Karp Runge\u2013Kutta method. all the alignments that we analysed are available in the electronic supplementary material, text S2. for each of the 18 datasets that met our incorporation criteria, we calculated mean pairwise genetic diversity (and collated data on subtype, prevalence, host population size and population density)"}
