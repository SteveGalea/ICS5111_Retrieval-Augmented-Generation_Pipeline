{"summary": "HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HKU1 are known to circulate in the human population. only HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HKU1 are known to circulate in the human population. the virus has been identified as an enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus. the eight accessory open reading frames encode for ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b. the ORFs encoding for the replicase genes (ORF 1a and ORF 1b) and structural genes, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) are also shown. ORFs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b will be summarized and will include: (i) expression and processing; (ii) the effects on cellular processes; and (iii) functional studies. ORF3a encodes for a 274 amino acid (a.a.), 31 kDa accessory protein [21,22,25,26]. the diacidic domain ensures that ORF3a is efficiently exported from the endoplasmic reticulum [32] to the golgi apparatus. transport of ORF3a to the cell surface requires two protein sorting and tracking signals. membrane-bound ORF3a interacts with structural proteins S, M and E and with SARS-CoV ORF7a. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is also expressed by a certain population of peripheral CD14+ monocytes. the expression of ORF3a in a murine macrophage osteoclast precursor cell line enhances osteoclast differentiation. the first attempts to elucidate the functions of coronaviral group-specific genes involved the generation of recombinant MHV. a study used small interference RNAs (siRNAs) to knockdown the expression of ORF3a in FRhK-4 cells. the transfection of vero E6 cells with siRNAs specific to ORF3a significantly reduced the yield of progeny SARS-CoV. this could have been a combinational effect due to the concurrent knockdown of ORF3a. transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) up-regulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. these changes to host cellular homeostasis imply a role for ORF3a in the pathogenesis of SARS. the pro-apoptotic function of ORF3a is reliant on its ion channel activity. sera from rabbits immunized with recombinant ORF3a (a.a. 125\u2013274) does not exhibit any significant neutralizing activity on SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. contrasting results could be explained by differences in the immunogenicity of the central region and C-terminal domain compared to the N-terminal ectodomain. mice immunized with full-length 3a DNA elicit strong humoral and Th1-based cellular immune responses. the vaccine stimulated IFN- production mainly by CD8+ T cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) mainly by CD4+ T cells. if ORF3a will be useful as a subunit vaccine for humans, remains to be seen though. SARS-CoV deletion mutants lacking the 3b gene replicate to levels similar to those of wild-type virus in several tissue culture cell types [17], suggesting that ORF3b is dispensable for viral replication in vitro. a role for this protein in viral pathogenicity has been inferred through its ability to modulate the host innate immune response. p6 is a small 63 amino acid membrane protein with no known homologues. the protein is found on cytoplasmic membranes in the endoplasmic reticulum [82,83] and Golgi-complex of cells overexpressing ORF6 [82,83]. sucrose gradient purification of SARS-CoV particles and virus capture assays show that ORF6 is associated with purified virions. the presence of SARS-CoV proteins E, M and S sufficient for incorporation of ORF6 into virus-like particles (VLPs) ORF6 partially co-localized with nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a marker for virus replication complexes. it also interacted with nsp8, another replicase protein [87] pointing to a putative role for ORF6 in replication. however, it down-regulated the mRNA level of co-transfected constructs. ORF9b immunoprecipitated with ORF6 from extracts of SARS-CoV infected cells. this interaction has been validated by co-localization of both proteins in biologically relevant conditions. findings support the hypothesis that ORF6 could be a minor structural protein and an important virulence factor during SARS-CoV infection in vivo. the ectodomain of ORF7a binds to the alpha integrin I domain of human lymphocyte function-related antigen 1 (LFA-1) on Jurkat cells, suggesting that LFA-1 may be an attachment factor or even the receptor for SARS-CoV on human leukocytes [99] there are discrepancies in the literature as to the exact subcellular localization of the protein. the presence of 7a protein in the cytoplasm could explain why ORF7a is able to inhibit protein translation. the protein is encoded by the second ORF of sgRNA7 and may be expressed by \"leaky scanning\" of ribosomes. studies have shown that infection with mutant SARS-CoV bearing deletions in gene 7 does not result in significant changes to replication kinetics, tissue tropism, morbidity or mortality. one study utilizing siRNAs targeting specifically ORF7a and ORF7b has demonstrated that the silencing of these proteins significantly reduces the yield of progeny virus. overexpression of Bcl-XL protein blocks ORF7a-induced apoptosis in 293T cells. it suggests that ORF7a regulates host cell apoptosis at or upstream of the Bcl-2 family in the apoptotic pathway. the actual levels at which ORF7a is expressed in infected tissues is still unknown. the ORF7b protein is likely to be expressed in vivo because anti-7b antibody has been detected in SARS convalescent patient serum. a 29 nucleotide deletion in the mRNA8 of SARS-CoV from some animal species encoding 39- and 84-residue polypeptides. this difference is due to a 29 nucleotide deletion in the mRNA8 of SARS-CoV. ORF8a and ORF8b interact with SARS-CoV proteins S, M, ORF3a and ORF7a [118], all of which have been shown to be structural proteins. antibodies to ORF8a have been detected in a small number of SARS patients, proving that the protein is indeed expressed during virus infection. overexpression of ORF8b in mammalian cells also induces DNA synthesis. but co-expression of SARS 8b and SARS 6 did not elicit synergistic effects on DNA synthesis. biological function of this induction is still to be elucidated. cellular CRM1 (Exportin1) protein functions as a nuclear export receptor for proteins carrying a Rev-like NES. the interaction of ORF9b with Crm1 is essential for the proper degradation of ORF9b and blocking the nuclear export of the latter induces apoptosis. the ORF3a N-terminal ectodomain (a.a. 1-34) is separated from the C-terminal endodomain (a.a. 209-264) by a central region containing a cysteine-rich domain (a.a. 127-133), a Yxx domain (a.a. 160-163; where x is any a.a. and is an a.a. with a bulky hydrophobic side-chain) membrane-bound ORF3a interacts with structural proteins S, M and E. in lung sections, expression of ORF3a is restricted to the cytoplasm of pneumocytes and to multinucleated giant cells, a rare feature of the lung pathology in SARS-CoV. coronaviral group-specific genes play a role in virus-host interactions. the biological functions of ORF3a may be closely linked to those of the structural proteins with which they interact. co-localization of ORF3a with M and E proteins suggests that ORF3a is important in viral assembly or budding. a study has shown that there is a significant reduction in viral release in FRhK-4 cells transfected with ORF3a specific siRNAs. the mechanism whereby ORF3a influences viral release warrants further investigation. apoptosis and necrosis imply a role for ORF3a in the pathogenesis of SARS. ORF3a is induced via caspase-8 and -9 dependent pathways, i.e. through both the death receptor- and mitochondria-mediated pathways. it has been reported that Bax, p53 and p38 MAP kinase also play roles in ORF3a-induced apoptosis. mutant 3a genes encode for proteins with distinctively shorter N-termini than the wild-type forms [24,60] neutralizing activity of anti-3a sera has subsequently been assessed in vitro. sera from rabbits immunized with recombinant ORF3a (a.a. 125\u2013274) does not exhibit any significant neutralizing activity on SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. a study has reported that ORF3b is localized primarily in the nucleus with no evidence of mitochondrial localization. a role for this protein in viral pathogenicity has been inferred by its ability to modulate the host innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV-infected cells do not produce IFN [71,72]. it is possible that ORF3b provides the SARS-CoV with a mechanism to subvert the IFN response, and therefore the innate immune response. however, when mice are infected with mutant SARS-CoV lacking 3b genes, the deletion viruses grow to levels similar to those of wild-type virus in the lungs of mice at day 2 post infection [17] p6 is a small 63 amino acid membrane protein with no known homologues. the protein is found on cytoplasmic membranes in the endoplasmic reticulum [82] and Golgi-complex of cells overexpressing ORF6 [82,83] the membrane topology of this protein is N-endo C-endo. recombinant studies with SARS-CoV lacking ORF6 remained viable in vitro and in vivo at a high multiplicity of infection (moi) recombinant studies with attenuated MHV expressing SARS-CoV ORF6 showed accelerated MHV replication [92] and lead to higher viral titers in both cell culture and the mouse central nervous system [83,93]. ORF6 suppresses the expression levels of co-transfected expression constructs. it down-regulated the mRNA level of co-transfected nsp8. but they linked the N-terminus diacidic cluster motif, DDEE, to this suppression. ORF7a is a 122 a.a. long, type 1 transmembrane protein with an N terminal signal peptide sequence of 15 aa, an ectodomain of 81 aa, and a C terminus transmembrane domain containing 21 aa residues. the ectodomain bears high structural and similar sequence homology to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, namely the D1 domains of ICAM-1 and I there are discrepancies in the literature as to the exact subcellular localization of the protein. the presence of ORF7a in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment could explain how ORF7a becomes incorporated into purified SARS-CoV particles. the presence of ORF7a in the cytoplasm could explain why ORF7a is important in the viral replication cycle. the protein is found in association with intracellular virus particles and also in purified virions [102] there is very little experimental evidence to support a role for ORF7a or ORF7b in the replication of SARS-CoV. in airway epithelial cultures generated from Golden Syrian hamster tracheas, SARS-CoV replication titers are comparable to infected human cultures. the importance of ORF7a and ORF7b during the replication cycle of SARS-CoV remains uncertain. ORF7a activates NF-kappaB and the IL-8 promotor [52] downstream from that, augments the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines such as RANTES [52] ORF7a may induce apoptosis by interfering with the pro-survival function of Bcl-XL protein. it is not the only apoptosis-inducing factor during SARS-CoV infection. the actual levels at which ORF7a is expressed in infected tissues are still unknown. Vaccinia virus expressed SARS-CoV ORF8ab contains a cleavable signal sequence, which directs the movement of the precursor protein to the ER and then mediates its translocation into the ER lumen. both ORF8a and ORF8b also bind to monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin, suggesting the potential involvement in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV [116]. the 9.6 kDa ORF8b localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of vero E6 and CHO cells. a soluble, unmodified and monomeric ORF8b protein was expressed in the cytoplasm. in the absence of the ORF8a region, ORF8b undergoes rapid degradation by proteasomes. bi-cistronic mRNA9 encodes for ORF9b which is translated via a leaky ribosomal scanning mechanism. anti-9b antibody and ORF9b antigen have been detected in clinical samples from SARS patients [37,59], with the latter also detected in virus infected cells [37], respectively. the protein co-localizes with intracellular vesicles. it has been speculated that the protein has a role in virus assemble via membrane association. the interaction of ORF9b with another SARS-CoV accessory protein, ORF6, was discussed earlier in this review. it would be interesting to determine whether the high SARS-CoV accessory gene number correlate with the increased virulence of SARS-CoV when compared to the other known human CoVs. the role of the accessory proteins in pathogenesis must be elucidated. apoptosis through mitochondria-dependent pathway [119] ORF8b Induces DNA synthesis [120] ORF9b Induces apoptosis. effects of accessory proteins on cellular functions in cells transfected with DNA constructs."}
