{"summary": "Background Complement proteins and activation products have been found associated with neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 3xTg mice deficient in C1q (3xTgQ-/-) were generated and both 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/- were backcrossed to the BUB mouse strain which has higher hemolytic complement activity. 3xTg mice may not be influenced by fibrillar amyloid mediated activation of the classical complement pathway. this suggests that the alternative complement pathway activation or a C3-independent cleavage of C5 could account for the detrimental effects in these mice that are prevented by the C5a receptor antagonist. a transgenic mouse model of AD was crossed to a C1q-/- mouse to generate the APPQ-/- mouse which lacks C1q. we observed a decrease in reactive glia associated with fibrillar amyloid plaques in the APPQ-/- compared to the APP mice at all ages analyzed. the treated animals showed a decrease in plaque and glia pathology, an increase in the SYN staining and cognitive improvement. a caveat for the use of standard mouse models for studying the involvement of complement in human AD is the reported weak hemolytic activity of mouse complement [19]. a possible consequence in vivo would be a lower or less efficient C5 cleavage and thus a lower generation of both C5a, a proinflammatory peptide, and the membrane attack complex composed of C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9 (C5b-9) transgenic mice harboring the Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL), a human four repeat Tau (P301L) mutation and a knock in mutation of presenilin1 (PS1M146V) [18] in a mixed background were generously provided by Dr. Frank LaFerla (UCI, Irvine, CA) these mice were backcrossed for 6 generations to the BUB/BnJ strain (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) to generate 3xTgBUB mice mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (67/27 mg/kg) and perfused with PBS. fixed tissue was stored in PBS/0.02% Na azide at 4\u00b0C until use. primary antibodies were detected with biotinylated secondary antibodies against the corresponding species. primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti mouse C1q (4 ug/ml, #1151 [27] rat monoclonal anti CD45 (1 ug/ml), mouse monoclonal anti hyperphosphorylated tau (AT8 or AT100, 0.2 and 0.02ug/ml respectively) three antibodies were used to detect C3.

C1q deposition is not detected on plaques in 3xTg in contrast to other APP mouse models. no detectable staining of C1q in 3xTg at 22 m. expression of C3 and cleaved C3 fragments in 3xTg brain compared to other APP transgenic models C3 immunoreactivity was tested using two monoclonal antibodies, the anti mouse C3 antibody (Clone 11H9) that recognizes both intact C3 and the cleaved fragments C3b, iC3b and C3d. in the Arc48 mice at younger ages the 11H9 antibody stained only astrocytes, but at later 3 since C3d contains the thioester that can form covalent binding with an activator (here the fibrillar amyloid) the association of C3d on plaques was not detected in either Tg2576 (data not shown) or in the 3xTg with this antibody. the monoclonal 2/11 which reacts with activated/cleaved C3 only (C3b/iC3b/C3c), stained plaques in Arc48 (13 astrocytes clustered around plaques in the subiculum of the 3xTg mice at 18 and 22 m respectively. the anti C3/C3d antibody labels astrocytes (red) and colocalizes with thioflavine plaques (yellow) anti mouse properdin antibody in the hippocampus of 17 mo Tg2576 (A) and 17 mo wild type littermate (B) and the subiculum of 16 mo 3xTg (C) and 18 mo 3xTgQ-/- (D) Similar increases in inflammatory gene expression are detected in the 3xTg Q-/-BUB as in 3xTgBUB Expression of inflammatory gene transcripts in cortex and hippocampus of 18 m old 3xTgBU no significant differences in IL-6 or TNF mRNA levels were identified in either region of the brain. comparison of IL-1, Il-1\u00df and CCL2 transcript expression with the level of immunohistochemical CD45 reactivity showed a trend toward a positive correlation with the expression of these elevated transcripts. this reached significance only in the case of IL-1 (p = 0.038, Figure 8B) 3xTg mice were first bred to generate C1q-deficient 3xTg mice. to eliminate classical complement pathway activation, mice were first bred to generate C1q-deficient 3xTg mice. to enhance complement activity, 3xTg were backcrossed 6 generations to the BUB background. the presence of properdin, an alternative complement pathway component, supports the possibility that the alternative pathway is activated in this AD model. an additional contribution of the C3-independent generation of C5a cannot be ruled out at this point. the abrogation of AD pathology backcrossed to the C5 deficient FVB strain. thioflavine positive plaques and glial accumulation were detected earlier (by approximately 2 months) in the 3xTg mice relative to the 3xTg. there was no evidence of C1q and C4b associated with plaques in the 3xTg. greater alternative pathway complement activation or greater C3-independent C5 cleavage in the 3xTg may be the basis for this accelerated pathology. C1q-/- and APPPS1C1q-/- mice showed less reactive glia surrounding plaques and increased synaptophysin than the Tg2576 or APPPS1 [16]. the protection given by the lack of C1q (and thus lack of the classical pathway for complement activation) was substantial but not complete, suggesting that the alternative pathway and/or other non complement mediated events contribute to the inflammatory reaction around the plaques. the accelerated progression of pathology in the 3xTg on BUB background is consistent with a role for complement in determining the rate of progression of the disease. the potential polymorphism in CR1 associated with human AD also suggests a point of control of complement activation. polyclonal antibody labeled mainly astrocytes in all three models. lack of astrocyte labeling by 2/11 anti C3b/iC3b/C3c that recognizes only cleaved C3 supports the conclusion that the astrocyte labeling in these models represents native, uncleaved C3. the absence of definitive evidence for some late complement factors has been reported [32,49] suggesting that there might not be quantitatively comparable complement activation in mouse models as in human AD. authors declare they have no competing interests. authors thank Tracy Cole and Rahasson Ager for generous excellent assistance.
