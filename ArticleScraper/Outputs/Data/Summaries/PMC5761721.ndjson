{"summary": "microtubule severing enzymes are a family of AAA-ATPase proteins that participate in fundamental cellular processes such as mitosis, ciliary biogenesis and growth cone motility. mutations in microtubule severing enzyme genes SPG4, KATNB1 and KATNAL2 are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, cerebral malformations and autism. mutant mice showed both male sterility and circadian phenotypes. this mutation is associated with anxiety and memory deficits. further investigations demonstrated that catnal11H/1H mice show neuronal migration. mice were placed into a walled arena (grey polyvinyl chloride; 45 45 cm) and allowed to explore for 20 min. video tracking in the home cage Activity in the home cage was recorded by video tracking as previously described. ependymal lining of the lateral ventricle was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, incubated in 2% osmium tetroxide, and dehydrated through ethanol solutions. samples were critical point dried using an Emitech K850 (Quorum Technologies, East Sussex, UK), coated with platinum using a Quorom Q150R S sputter behavioural phenotyping Spontaneous alternation Mice were placed in a walled T-maze. the mouse was confined in the goal arm for 30 s, before being allowed a second free choice of goal arm. an alternation was recorded if the second choice differed from that of the first. one trial was performed per day for 10 days. neuronal migration assessment was performed as previously described18 using embryos at either E13 or E15 (three mothers per age group) cell counts were performed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) de in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, incubated in 2% osmium tetroxide, and dehydrated through ethanol solutions. samples were critical point dried using an Emitech K850 (Quorum Technologies), coated with platinum using a Quorom Q150R S sputter coater (Quorum Technologies) dian and sterility phenotypes to the same region on chromosome 5 and subsequent sequencing identified the causative mutation as a T to G single point mutation within exon seven of the catnal1 gene. this mutant allele was designated Katnal11H, and results in a leucine to valine substitution at residue 286 of the protein. 3D modelling of the protein suggests that this loss of function is due to hydrophobic changes in the AAA domain of the enzyme. compared to wild-type littermates, catnal11H/1H mice show increased non-REM delta power in the dark phase of the light/dark cycle (f) and following sleep deprivation (g). compared to wild-type littermates, cats show increased non-REM delta power in the dark phase of the light/dark cycle (f) and following sleep deprivation (g). catnal11H/1H mice display behavioural deficits. both working memory and spatial memory were significantly poorer. both working memory and spatial memory were significantly poorer in mice. catnal11H/1H mice show a spectrum of abnormal behaviours. we separated pups at postnatal days 7\u20138 (the age at which mice show peak of USV emission24) to test whether catnal11H/1H animals vocalised differently to wild types. analysis of hematoxylin and eosin stained brain sections revealed that catnal11H/1H animals had less tightly packed pyramidal cell layers in the hippocampus (Figures 3a and b) and a narrower cortical layer 1 and wider cortical layer 6 (Figures 3c\u2013e). calbindin and CUX1 labelling were more intense closer to the cortical surface, which is consistent with an increase in the size of layer 1. al11H/1H mice had substantially larger ventricles than wild types. CUX1 immunofluorescence demonstrates that catnal11H/1H animals have a higher proportion of labelling towards the cortical surface than wild types. catnal11H/1H mice have larger ventricles than wild types. histological phenotypes of catnal11H/1H mouse brains described above suggestive of neuronal migration defects. golgi labelling shows that catnal11H/1H animals have larger soma (k), shorter axons (l), thinner axons (m) and fewer dendritic spines (n) than wild types. catnal1 1H/1H associated with defects in motile. mutations in microtubule severing enzymes can cause defects in cilia. mutations in some microtubule severing enzymes can cause defects in cilia. ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of catnal11H/1H animals was significantly attenuated compared to wild-type. ependymal motile cilia in the lateral ventricle of wiltype and catnal11H/1H animals have a significantly reduced CBF (a) and a higher proportion of ciliary dyskinesia (b) compared to wild-type littermates. cilia kinks in the cilia (h) and swellings along the length of the cilia (i). Arrows in (e\u2013i) indicate ciliary abnormalities. c\u2013i=5 m; j, 500 nm (***P0.001). genetyping confirmed that the mutation was homozygous in affected circadian animals and wild type or heterozygous in unaffected animals. more extensive circadian phenotyping conducted on catnal1 homozygotes (Katnal11H/1H) and wild-type littermates. compared to wild-type littermates, catnal11H/1H mice show increased non-REM delta power in the dark phase of the light/dark cycle (f) and following sleep deprivation (g) the non-REM delta power of catnal11H/1H mice was higher in the dark phase of baseline sleep (mixed ANOVA, interaction factors \u2018genotype X time, F(1,88)=8.91, P=0.0175) both working memory and spatial memory were significantly poorer in catnal11H/1H mice. mutants take longer to find the platform in acquisition trials. mutants show poorer improvements in the latency to find the platform. catnal11H/1H mice show a spectrum of abnormal behaviours. we separated pups at postnatal days 7\u20138 and recorded their USVs. compared to wild types, cats produced fewer (Figure 2g) and shorter (Figure 2h) vocalisations. cortical layer markers calbindin (layers 2/3 and 5; Figures 3f and g), CUX1 (layers 2/3 and 4; Figures 3i and j), FOXP2 (layer 6a) and CTGF (layer 6b) similar quantification revealed that FOXP2 labelling extended further from layer 6b (as labelled by CTGF) in the Katnal11H/1H cortex. CUX1 immunofluorescence demonstrates that catnal11H/1H animals have a higher proportion of labelling towards the cortical surface than wild types. FOXP2 (green) and CTGF (red) immunofluorescence in cortical sections of wild-type (l) and Katnal11H/1H (m) animals. catnal11H/1H mice showed abnormal neuronal migration using BrdU labelling of E13 and E15 embryos and quantified labelled cells in the cortex of P9 pups. at both ages catnal11H/1H animals had greater numbers of labelled neurons in bins close to the cortical surface. golgi labelling shows that catnal11H/1H animals have larger soma (k), shorter axons (l), thinner axons (m) and fewer dendritic spines (n) than wild types. we also hypothesised that neuronal morphology is modulated by Katnal1. the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of Katnal11H/1H animals was significantly attenuated compared to wild-type. the abnormal cilia always showed a dyskinetic beat pattern and lower beat frequency. of catnal11H/1H cilia identified ciliary abnormalities including bifurcated cilia (Figure 5g), abnormal kinks and bends in the cilia (Figure 5h) and swellings along the length of the cilia (Figure 5i). vesicular aggregates were present within the ciliary swellings described above (Figure 5j). tubule severing enzyme Katnal1 is poorly defined in the context of CNS development and function. at present the microtubule severing enzyme is poorly defined in the context of CNS development and function. phenotypic analysis shows that the mutation is associated with changes in circadian rhythms, sleep and behaviour. phenotypes are limited to motor dysfunction in mice lacking the Spg4 gene27 and head shaking and circling in the Fign mutant. loss of function of Katnal1 is associated with a range of behavioural phenotypes, including changes in circadian activity, poor learning and memory, hyperactivity in a novel environment. a rare mutation in KATNAL1 has been associated with schizophrenia. a similar discrepancy has also been noted for the intellectual disability candidate gene CTNNB1.17. the data we present here also demonstrate defects in motile cilia in catnal11H/1H mice. ciliary dysfunction in mice has been linked with learning and memory39 and vocalisation phenotypes. defects in microtubule severing and ciliary abnormalities may contribute to the phenotypes we describe in catnal11H/1H mice. however, they are far less prominent in catnal11H/1H mice than in other mouse ciliopathy models. the ciliary component of KATNAL1 dysfunction may be mild compared to other ciliopathies.
