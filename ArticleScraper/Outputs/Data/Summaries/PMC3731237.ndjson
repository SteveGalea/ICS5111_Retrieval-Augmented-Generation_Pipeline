{"summary": "VZV is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus, as evidenced by a seroprevalence of more than 95% worldwide. the virus has the smallest genome of approximately 125 kbp. it contains at least 70 open reading frames (ORFs) and consists of two unique regions, unique long (UL) and unique short (US) fetal dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are typically free of latent VZV. apoptosis inhibition mediated by VZV in neurons is mediated by VZV. human stem cells provide an alternative source of neurons. the 3D NHNP TLA culture system maintains partially differentiated normal human neural progenitor cells as tissue-like assemblies (TLAs) the 3D NHNP TLAs can be maintained for at least three months following VZV infection. NHNP cells were cultured in 3D on a scaffold of Cultispher beads in a rotating wall vessel. multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH), flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and RT-PCR compared with 2D NHNP cells. NHNP TLAs expressed neuronal progenitor markers CXCR4, CD133, CD105-Endoglin, CD 90-Thy-1 and CD49f-6 Integrin at levels comparable to the parental NHNP (2D) cell population. early progenitor markers CXCR4 and CD133 in NHNP TLAs than in human TG. later stage developmental markers, CD105, CD90 and CD49f, were expressed to a lesser extent in NHNP TLAs than in human TG. lower expression levels in the NHNP TLAs than in human TG were observed for the neuronal marker neurofilament 200 (NF-200) NP Marker description CXCR4 2.0 8.0 neural progenitor marker CD133 4.0 5.0 primitive neural stem cell/HSC* CD105 (Endoglin) 98.0 96.0 neural stem cell/MSC** CD90 (Thy-1) 99.0 91.0 early progenitor maturation regulated by CD90 CD34 2.0 1.0 early hematopoietic marker (negative control) eGFP and mRFP encoding the immediate-early protein 63 (IE63) were mutated to identify expression originating from each gene. the fluorescent proteins eGFP and mRFP were inserted at the C-terminus of ORF63 and 70 respectively. correct incorporation of eGFP and mRFP sequences was confirmed by PCR, DNA sequencing and multiple RFLP analyses. generation of fluorescently labeled VZV P-Oka facilitates analysis of ORF63 and ORF70 expression. eGFP (green arrow) and mRFP (red arrow) are indicated respectively. v63G/70R replicates comparable to parental virus in vitro. v63G/70R infection of NHNP TLAs Cell-free v63G/70R efficiently infected NHNP TLAs, as evidenced by an approximate 50-fold increase in VZV genome copies from 0 to 18 days post-infection. each culture was maintained initially for 39 days to establish a baseline glucose consumption rate. qRT-PCR analysis of ORF63/70 transcript copies normalized against GAPDH mRNA copies. data of two independent experiments analyzed in triplicate is shown as mean relative copies. cell-free supernatants from infected NHNP TLAs were titrated using permissive MeWo cells and plaques stained using an anti-VZV IE63 antibody. NHNP TLA cells express progenitor and mature neuronal markers. NHNP TLAs were infected with v63G/70R, fixed 21 days post-infection and stained for the progenitor marker Nestin (upper panels, A\u2013C) and the mature neuronal marker -Tubulin-III (lower panels, D\u2013F) both ORF63-eGFP and ORF70-mRFP are expressed in NHNP TLA cultures infected with v63G/70R. confocal microscopy confirmed that both ORF63-eGFP and ORF70-mRFP are expressed in NHNP TLA cultures. NHNP TLAs were cultured in 3D on a scaffold of Cultispher beads in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. NHNP cells were cultured in 3D on a scaffold of Cultispher beads in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor and analyzed by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH), flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and RT-PCR. progenitor (Nestin) and mature (-Tubulin-III) neuronal markers were detected by immunohistochemistry in human TG removed at autopsy. lower expression levels in the NHNP TLAs than in human TG were observed for the neuronal marker neurofilament 200 (NF-200), again indicating NHNP TLAs are generally less differentiated. % positive 2-D NHNP % positive 3-D NHNP Marker description CXCR4 2.0 8.0 neural progenitor marker CD133 4.0 5.0 primitive neural stem cell/HSC* CD105 (Endoglin) 98.0 96.0 neural stem cell/MSC** CD90 (Thy-1) 99.0 91.0 neural progenitor cell/HSC*/MSC** CD49f (6 integrin) 98.0 99.0 early progenitor maturation regulated gene eGFP and mRFP were inserted at the C-terminus of ORF63 and 70 respectively, respectively, in the parental VZV Oka strain. correct incorporation of eGFP and mRFP coding sequences was confirmed by PCR, DNA sequencing and multiple RFLP analyses. plaques developed in which only eGFP or mRFP were expressed in infected MeWo cells. no significant effect on virus replication due to insertion of fluorescent proteins into ORF63/70. generation of fluorescently labeled VZV P-Oka facilitates analysis of ORF63 and ORF70 expression. data is shown as mean viral genome copies with standard deviations (error bars) v63G/70R infection of NHNP TLAs Cell-free v63G/70R efficiently infected NHNP TLAs. each culture was maintained initially for 39 days to establish a baseline glucose consumption rate. each culture was maintained initially for 39 days to establish a baseline glucose consumption rate. two independent NHNP TLAs were established, infected with v63G/70R. qRT-PCR analysis of ORF63/70 transcript copies normalized against GAPDH mRNA copies. cell-free supernatants from VZV infected NHNP TLAs were titrated using permissive MeWo cells. NHNP TLA cells express progenitor and mature neuronal markers.

VZV appears to be unique among alphaherpesviruses. NHNP TLAs maintained in 3D cultures are persistent and not latent. meanwhile, virus-induced CPE was not detected microscopically or by monitoring total glucose uptake. this suggests that many cells could express these transcripts and potentially produce infectious virus. infected NHNP TLAs in 3D cultures provide an excellent means to investigate chronic virus-neuron interactions. they allow introduction of autologous VZV-specific CD8 T-cells with the aim of immune surveillance that would remove cells actively producing virus. this in turn could be true for VZV and could allow the establishment of latently infected NHNP cultures. NHNP cells were grown as monolayers in human fibronectin-coated flasks. NHNP cells were grown as monolayers in human fibronectin-coated flasks. NHNP cells were tested for viral contaminants as pre-certified by the manufacturer's production criteria. 3105 NHNP cells/ml were seeded into a 55 ml rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV; Synthecon, Houston, TX) cells were allowed to attach to the beads for 48 h in the bioreactor before re-feeding with GTSF-2 containing 10% FBS. 20\u201390% of the media was replaced as required with fresh GTSF-2 media every 48 h. infected cells were harvested at 96 h post-infection (p.i.) and resuspended in reticulocyte standard buffer (10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) cells were disrupted by Dounce (type A) homogenization (cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL), debris removed by centrifugation at 900g for 15 min. cultures were incubated for 20 min with 50 nM calyculin-A (Waco Chemicals, Japan), treated with 0.075 M KCl hypotonic solution at 37\u00b0C for 20 min. Chromosome-containing slides were hybridized with Spectra Vysion Tm probes (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL) to detect specific chromosome pairs. images of NHNP TLAs were taken using a Philips XL gents were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN.) with the exception of CXCR4 obtained through ABCAM (Cambridge, MA.) Flow cytometry followed the method of Morrison et al. [81] with minor modifications. trigeminal ganglia were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. samples were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol. antigen was retrieved by soaking the sections in 10 mM sodium citrate. complementary DNA was synthesized from 100 ng of DNase-treated RNA. we used specific primers and probes to quantify VZV ORF9, ORF 40, ORF 63/70 and the cellular GAPDH gene. PCR amplification using the 7500-Fast real-time PCR system was previously described.

NHNP TLA 3D cell culture system NHNP cells were obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, MD, USA) and propagated in GTSF-2, a unique media containing glucose, galactose and fructose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u00b0C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. three-dimensional (3D) NHNP TLAs were generated by seeding 3105 NHNP cells/ml onto 3 mg/ml Cultispher beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) into a 55 ml rotating wall vessel bioreactor. cells were allowed to attach to the beads for 48 h before re-feeding with GTSF-2 containing 10% FBS. infected cells were harvested at 96 h post-infection (p.i.) and resuspended in reticulocyte standard buffer (10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) cells were disrupted by Dounce (type A) homogenization. metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis Multicolor mFISH for the analysis of chromosome integrity was conducted as described [74], [75]. NHNP cells and TLAs were cultured as previously stated, with the exception of being subcultured at a low density for 36 h. all reagents were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN.) confocal and flow cytometry used the same reagents. NHNP TLAs from RWV culture vessels were collected into a 50 mL conical tube. trypsin was inactivated with 35 mL cold 10% FBS in PBS. samples were either analyzed by confocal microscopy on a Leica TCS/SP2 3-laser confocal microscope or a Beckman Coulter XL2 Flow Cytometer. the collection and use of human cadaver tissue was approved by the University of Colorado Internal Review Board and removed only after receiving informed consent from next-of-kin. color reaction was developed for 2 min using the fresh fuchsin substrate system (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) in the presence of levamisole at a final concentration of 24 g/ml. nucleic acid quantification DNA and RNA were extracted from cell pellets using DNeasy and RNeasy kits according to manufacturer's protocol.
