{"summary": "mumps is an acute generalized infection caused by a virus of the Rubalavirus genus of the paramyxoviridae family. it occurs mainly in school-aged children and adolescents. the most prominent clinical manifestation is nonsuppurative swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands. sporadic suspected cases of parotitis may be caused by the parainfluenza virus (PIV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), influenza virus (InV), rhinovirus, adenovirus or other viruses. results Patient characteristics Study cases ranged in age from 8 mo to 50 y (median 6 y), and 64% were male. 0.3 Male sex, No. (%) 65 (64.4%) 32 (61.5%) 33 (67.3%) 0.7 Unilateral mumps or other salivary gland, No. (%) 88 (87%) 43 (82.7%) 45 (91.8%) 0.2 Fever, No. (%) 34 (33.7%) 21 (40.4%) 13 (26.5%) 0.2 Prodromal Symptoms, No. (%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) __ Vaccination 0 MMR Doses, No. (%) most cases were male (72%), with a median age of 6 y (range 1\u201338 y) no seasonal pattern was observed. sporadic cases of parotitis according to the virus detected. patients, the oral sample was collected on the first day after the swelling. 52.7% corresponded to samples collected in the 2 first days and 41% (11/27) to samples collected later (3\u20138 d), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.4) no statistically significant differences were observed in patients according to whether they had a positive or negative result for the study viruses. sporadic suspected cases of parotitis were detected according to viral screening of salivary samples. mumps detection was non-significantly lower in the typical mumps season (January to May) than in the remaining months (47.7% and 54.4%, respectively). most cases were male (72%), with a median age of 6 y (range 1\u201338 y) the median age of children with PIV2 infection was higher than in children with PIV3 infection (9 y vs 4 y) both infections presented unilateral swelling and seasonality. the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.4) the sensitivity of RT-PCR is 87% in oral samples collected on the first day, 78% for the first 2 days and 41% for the first 3 d. sensitivity of RT-PCR is 87% in oral samples collected on the first day, 78% for the first 2 days and 41% for the first 3 d. 89 patients had received the MMR vaccine (24 one dose and 65 two doses) in 78.5% (51) of patients who had received two doses, the sample had been collected in the first 2 days after the onset of swelling. in the other 14 patients, the sample was collected 3 days after swelling onset. 57.4% (58/101) of cases classified as suspected mumps cases were not caused by the mumps virus. Finland is the only country where mumps has been eliminated using a two-dose MMR policy. sporadic suspected cases of mumps are generally assumed to be caused by the mumps virus, even when laboratory tests are negative. in a high proportion of suspected sporadic cases of mumps reported to public health services a possible etiologic origin due to other viruses was found. a suspected case was considered sporadic if the patient was not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case or to another case of parotitis. RNA and DNA was extracted from a total volume of 200 l of sample. the lysis buffer included an internal control in each reaction tube. sensitivity of this assay is 100-fold greater than previously widely-used RT-PCR assay amplifying the SH gene. the median incidence rate was 2.4/100 000 persons-year; range 1.8 - 7.1/100 000 persons-year. in 2007, there was a mumps epidemic, while the years 2008\u20132011 were interepidemic years. the analytical sensitivity of this assay is, on average, 100-fold greater than the previously widely-used RT-PCR assay amplifying the SH gene. in cases where RT-PCR was negative for mumps, EBV and respiratory viruses were tested for."}
