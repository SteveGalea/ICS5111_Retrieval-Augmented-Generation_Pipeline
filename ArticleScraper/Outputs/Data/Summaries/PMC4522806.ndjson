Ile80 and Val83 of 1, Leu177 of 3, and Val282 and Phe286 of 6 form hydrophobic interactions with Val294, Tyr296, Pro297, Ile299, Leu411, Pro412, and Leu419. nsp14 is functionally and structurally more similar to the proofreading exonuclease domain. nascent RNA is synthesized at the polymerization sites (red circle) of the nsp12 RdRp domain (gray) or is mismatch excised at the proofreading site (red circles) of nsp14 ExoN (green surface) nsp14 was coexpressed with nsp10 in Escherichia coli and purified as a preformed complex. the unliganded, SAM-bound, and S-adenosyl homocysteine

the N terminus of N7-MTase are marked red, green, marine, and pink. invisible residues from 454 to 464 of nsp14 are shown by a dashed line. three zinc fingers (ZF) of nsp14 are highlighted with residues shown as sticks. space group C2 2 21 C2 2 21 C2 2 21 Wavelength, 0.984 0.979 0.979 Resolution, * 50.0 (3.46) 3.4 50.0 (3.31) 3.2 50.0 (3.36) 3.30 No. of all reflections 346,535 747,221

of the reflections that was not included in prior refinement calculations. the electron density for the ExoN catalytic center (A) and the N7-MTase catalytic center (B) are contoured at 2. the nsp14 ExoN domain contains a central,. the nsp14 domain contains a central,. twisted -sheet made up of five -strands form a parallel -sheet. the strands form a parallel -sheet with the exception of 3 and are flanked by -helices on either side. nsp14 is reminiscent of the structures of the DEDD superfamily exonucleases. the structure of the E. coli subunit of polymerase III (Pol III) is shown in the same orientation as nsp14. metal ions are shown as spheres, and bound ligands are shown as sticks. nsp14 share a similar two-metal-ion\u2013assisted mechanism for removal of misincorporated nucleotides (30\u201332) the absence of the second metal ion could be attributed to the lack of the substrate or product binding (30). asp243, previously mistaken as a catalytic residue (5, 16), is the fifth highly conserved acidic amino acid located between motifs II and III. the exoN activity of D243A mutant is completely lost (Fig. 2D) zinc finger 1 contributes the structural stability of nsp14. asp90, Glu92, Glu191, His268, and Asp273 of nsp14 are essential. the second region of intermolecular interactions is extensive and encompasses residues from the loop region following helix 2 and residues around zinc finger 1. a salt bridge formed between His80 of nsp10 and Asp126 of nsp14 stabilize the structural elements between 5 and 6 of nsp14. regions of nsp10 contacting nsp14 and nsp16 overlap substantially. comparison of nsp14\u2013nsp10 complex with nsp16\u2013nsp10 complex surprisingly reveals a significantly larger surface area of nsp10 contacts with nsp14. a small 2-sheet is positioned almost perpendicular to the central 1-sheet. a cavity between sheets 1 and 2 functions as a ligand-binding pocket. a zinc finger of nsp14 formed by Cys452, Cys477, Cys484, and His487 is located at the tip of this helix. amino acids within 4 of the ligands SAH (blue) and GpppA (red) are labeled and numbered. the magenta arrow indicates the methyl transfer. dashed lines between residues indicate hydrogen bonds. substrates SAM (A) and GpppA (B) bind in pockets formed by the 1-sheet, 2-sheet, and 1\u2032. the purine ring is bound in a hydrophobic environment created by amino acids. substitution of Asp352 with alanine reduces the N7-MTase activity of nsp14 by 20%. mutations disrupting the interaction of the N7-MTase with ribose and methionine moieties of SAM impair activity greatly or completely. but those affecting interactions with adenine are not important for activity (41) p385 stacks against the adenosine moiety of GpppA reduced activity by more than one third. mutations R310A, P335A, K336A, D352A, and Y420A have been reported. methyl donor SAM and acceptor GpppA are held in a highly constricted pocket. nsp14 and its mutants were tested for their ability to methylate 32P-labeled G*pppA-RNA. they were digested by nuclease P1 into single nucleotides and methylated m7G*pppA or unmethylated G*pppA. nsp14 is functionally and structurally more similar to the proofreading exonuclease domain of DNA polymerases. in this context, nsp14 is functionally and structurally more similar to the proofreading exonuclease domain of DNA polymerases. further experiments are necessary to shed more light on the relative orientation of the nsp13\u2013nsp12 interactions. nsp14 is synthesized at the polymerization sites (red circle) of the nsp12 RdRp domain (gray) or is mismatch excised at the proofreading site (red circles) of nsp14 ExoN (green surface) the relative orientation of the polymerization and proofreading domains is built on the Klenow fragment. atypical MTase fold and ropes in a second -sheet to bind substrates in a highly constricted cavity to accomplish methyl transfer. nsp10 and nsp14 of SARS-CoV isolate were synthesized and

DNA fragments including the optimized T7 class II promoter 2.5 with ATP as initial nucleotide (52) and the 5\u2032-terminal 259 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome were used as a template for in vitro transcription. nsp10 with an N-terminal GST tag and nsp14 with a C-terminal His tag were coexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C and induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl -d-thiogalactoside when OD600nm reached 0.8. cells were harvested, resuspended, and lysed by sonication in 20 mM Hepes each crystallization drop consisted of 1 L of nsp14\u2013nsp10 complex (10 mg/mL) mixed with 10 mM DTT and 0.25 mM SAM and 1 L of the mother liquor equilibrated over 200 L of reservoir solution. diffraction-quality crystals grew in 15% (vol/vol) Tacsimate (pH 7.0), 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.0) and 2% (wt/vol) ssRNA made up of 22 nucleotides was used as a substrate for activity assays. to obtain 5\u2032-labeled RNA22, it was incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and -[32P]-ATP (PerkinElmer) 0.1 g nsp14\u2013nsp10 complex or nsp14 mutant\u2013nsp10 complex was mixed with 1,000-cpm labeled RNA in a buffer made up of 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 6 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM SAM. 0.05 U inorganic pyrophosphatase (New England Biolabs"}
