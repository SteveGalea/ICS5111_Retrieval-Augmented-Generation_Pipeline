{"summary": "concussions and other forms of mild traumatic brain injuries occur at least 1.7 million times a year in north America. sports-related head trauma is a common cause of TBI in youth. nearly half million youth aged 14 years or less need hospital-based care for this injury. social learning theory proposes that aggressive play is encouraged in ice hockey culture. understanding the media portrayal of TBI in sports like ice hockey is important for evaluating whether the clinical severity of these injuries is being appropriately communicated. the purpose of our paper was to inductively identify themes in Canadian and American newspaper reports of ice hockey-related TBIs. key scientific and colloquial terms were included in the search algorithm. newspapers were likely to use both sets of terms. newspaper articles published before January 1st, 1985 were not available from ProQuestTM. the MUs from each article were coded using HyperRESEARCHTM. three members of the research team independently completed all coding. a comparison time period was four years before the 2004\u20132005 NHL lockout. four newspapers had a cumulative average weekly circulation of over 13 million copies in 2011 [20], [21] data collection We retrieved all newspaper articles electronically from the ProQuestTM database. key scientific and colloquial terms were included as newspapers were likely to use both sets of terms. data analysis We used the grounded-theory approach as a framework for a thematic analysis to provide rich descriptions of the nature and character of newspaper articles. categories and themes were allowed to emerge from the data inductively and were not pre-identified by a priori hypotheses [23], [24]. we recorded data into meaningful pieces of information known as meaning units (MUs) the five main themes, each comprised of several subthemes, emerged and they are described in Table 1. the five main themes \u2013 and associated sub-themes \u2013 were highly recurrent across all media sources in all time intervals and prominent in both countries. ice hockey can survive and thrive without it \u2013 TS, 2010 Canadian newspapers consistently reported that TBIs in ice hockey were serious injuries. however, these injuries are just a part of the game, and that they are essentially an unavoidable occupational hazard. recent reports placed responsibility on the NHL to make the game safer. 1998\u20132000 2009\u20132011 Aggression Gratuitous violence should be removed from the NHL Without question, the gratuitous violence, hacking, slashing, cross checking and fisticuffs that so dominate the game today is the main factor in my own loss of interest in the NHL. VS, 2009 Perceptions of brain injury Brain injuries are viewed as occupational hazards It's a physical game, so we all have to accept that there are going to be injuries \u2013 VS, 2010 The need for a culture TS, 1999 Various research has shown bodychecking is the leading cause of serious injuries - including concussions and fractures -in kids' hockey. in both time periods, American newspapers reported that aggression was an integral ingredient to ice hockey and that brain injuries should be accepted as part of ice hockey. the NHL has dropped its historically cavalier attitude toward concussions \u2013 NYT, 1998 Calls are proliferating for changes to the culture of a sport that many see as too accepting of reckless body contact and serious injury. the need for the league to strengthen rules in an attempt to make the game safer by preventing brain injury became more prominent. NYT, 1999 Hockey is probably the fastest team sport out there, and it can get pretty violent... Getting hurt happens a lot. the league intends to apply a much stricter standard of supplementary discipline for any deliberate action by a player that is either directed to the head of an opponent or results in an injury to the head. ns effects of country, or time period, on each of the identified categories. the content of discussions of TBI in the more recent time period more often dealt with the severity and impact of the injury. all Meaning Unit codes (N = 1535) were sorted under one of the above themes. Canadian newspapers disapproved of and condemned needless aggression and violence in ice hockey as expressed in these excerpts. the league took some half-hearted steps to protect players against the worst effects of head-injuries \u2013 TS, 2011 Recently, reports began to state there is enough inherent excitement in ice hockey given the finesse of the sport that the need for aggressive and violent play is unnecessary. table 2 provides quotes from Canadian newspapers that represent trends in reporting of brain injury in ice hockey. a new helmet, mouthguard and visor should, hopefully, prevent that. TS, 1999 There is talk of upgrading the quality of NHL helmets to reduce head injuries. new jersey Devils GM lou Lamoriello says improved equipment only makes players take more liberties. more recent reports stressed the need for a serious culture change within the sport because of TBIs. only in the past few years has the NHL dropped its historically cavalier attitude toward concussions \u2013 NYT, 1998 Calls for changes to the culture of a sport that many see as too accepting of reckless body contact.

TS, 1998 What's unacceptable is the willful inability to grasp this issue of serious brain injury in hockey \u2013 and every \u201cconcussion\u201d is serious. TS, 1999 Various research has shown bodychecking is the leading cause of serious injuries - including concussions and fractures -in kids' hockey. the league is concerned about the growing number of concussions that sidelined such headliners last season \u2013 CT, 1998. more recent reports stressed the need for a serious culture change within the sport because of TBIs. only in the past few years has the NHL dropped its historically cavalier attitude toward concussions \u2013 NYT, 2010 Reference to better equipment as a hazard as opposed to a protective factor was also noted in more recent reports. hockey is probably the fastest team sport out there, and it can get pretty violent... Getting hurt happens a lot. NYT, 1999 Hockey is probably the fastest team sport out there, and it can get pretty violent... Getting hurt happens a lot. ns effects of country, or time period, on each of the identified categories. the content of discussions of TBI in the more recent time period more often dealt with the severity and impact of the injury. report of brain injury as an unchanging \u201coccupational hazard\u201d reflect a stark contrast to the calls for rule changes and action by the most elite professionals in these newspaper articles. some useful models help us understand how the media shapes individuals' knowledge, attitudes, and practices of injury-related risk-taking. studies show that youth exposed to themes of aggression and aggression in the media view violence and aggression as the appropriate means for solving conflict in all aspects of life [40] studies show that youth who are repeatedly exposed to violence and aggression in the media view violence and aggression as the appropriate means for solving conflict in all aspects of life [42] similar trends were reported in other newspapers, on radio, television and through other online sources. to assess impact on such media reports on the public would require prospective studies with large numbers of people, a study beyond the scope of the present investigation."}
