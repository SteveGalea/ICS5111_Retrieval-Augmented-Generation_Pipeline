{"summary": "aims to assess the profile of respiratory viruses in young children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) and its association with disease severity defined as need for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) are the most frequent causes of acute respiratory infections in children. in the Netherlands, the most frequent viruses detected in children presenting to the ER or outpatient clinic with ALRI were RSV, RV and parainfluenza viruses. avirus (HCoV) and RSV detection correlated with longer duration of oxygen therapy. there was no association between the virus species and hospital length of stay. there was no association between the species and hospital length of stay. aliquots mixed with 750L of TRIzol to DNA/RNA extraction. two 500L backup aliquots mixed 1:1 with 500L of viral transport medium. all backup aliquots were stored at -70\u00b0C until analysis. a microgram of total RNA was extracted following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. cDNA was primed with random hexamers and followed manufacturer\u2019s protocol. all PCR reactions were performed on a Thermocycler 7300. negative controls were total RNA or DNA extracted from uninfected Hela cells and ultrapure water treated in the same way as clinical samples. data were expressed as median (range) or number (%). patients were grouped according to need for PICU admission. ALRI was defined by cough, tachypnea, respiratory distress with prolonged expiratory time. patients with a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia were excluded from analysis. need for PICU admission was considered the main indicator of disease severity. donkey anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline. slide preparation and IF protocols are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.w8rfhv6 and http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.w8vfhww. RNA and DNA respiratory viruses were extracted by real-time PCR TRI HCoV detection was performed by a nested RT-PCR method. all PCR reactions were performed on a Thermocycler 7300. negative controls were total RNA or DNA extracted from uninfected Hela cells. thestudy population comprised 236 patients who had at least one respiratory virus detected in respiratory specimens. the most common underlying diseases were neurological impairment (n = 17), congenital anomalies (n = 13) and chronic lung disease (n = 11). 8 (1\u2013254) 18 (3\u2013254) 7 (1\u2013210) data are expressed as median (range) or n (%). most frequently detected virus was RV (85.6%), followed by RSV (59.8%), HBoV (23.7%), HMPV (17.8%), HCoV (11.4%), HAdV (10.6%), PIV (10.2%) and FLU (8.5%) insufficiency (n = 4), cardiogenic shock (n = 2) and septic shock (n = 2). the patient who had the longest hospital stay (254 days) had pulmonary hypoplasia, a severe underlying condition, and ultimately died of sepsis. surprisingly, the number of detected viruses has not been associated with illness severity. HCoV was detected in 11% of children admitted to hospital with ALRI. OC43 was the most prevalent type (40.1%) and 41% of patients with HCoV in co-infection with RV-C were admitted to the PICU. this high frequency of antibiotic use is similar to that reported in developed countries. the present study was done in a single health center. this raises concern that epidemiologic data may not be generalizable. the results obtained are similar to those reported from Europe and North America."}
