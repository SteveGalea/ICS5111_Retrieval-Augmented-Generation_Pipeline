{"summary": "despite literature and guidelines recommending infection control practices, numerous barriers have been identified in ICUs. the use of PPE among critical care clinicians has not been extensively evaluated, especially during the pandemic influenza. as of September 6, 2009, the WHO had reported more than 277,607 cases, with at least 3,205 deaths. studies estimated that up to 2.7 million patients would be hospitalized. about 25% of these patients might experience rapid deterioration, leading to intensive care unit admission within 1 day after hospitalization. evidence does exist suggesting nosocomial transmission within hospital settings. 82.3% of the ICU HCWs expressed willingness to work in a pandemic, with professions, knowledge training prior to patient care, and the confidence to know how to protect themselves and the patients independently associated with more likelihood to care for H1N1 patients [17] questionnaires were collected and sent back by e-mail before January 15, 2010. respondents were asked to report their experience of caring for H1N1 patients. they were also required to report the level of knowledge and confidence in their ability to protect themselves and their patients from influenza at work. Statistical Analysis All Likert-scale responses were dichotomized into complete agree/agree versus neither agree nor disagree/disagree/disagree/complete disagree, and expression in proportions. self-reported compliance to PPE use of >80% was considered as high compliance [16] results Respondents In the 21 ICUs surveyed, 733 eligible participants were identified. an OR of less than 1 was associated with low compliance to PPE use. an OR of greater than 1 was associated with high compliance to PPE use. knowledge Significantly more physicians than nurses reported to have adequate knowledge of 2009 H1N1 influenza (61.1% vs. 33.7%, p0.001) the most commonly identified component of PPE was hand hygiene (95.4%), followed by gloves (90.0%), gown (88.6%), N95 respirator (88.3%), and goggles (81.4%) 87.5% of respondents believed that use of appropriate PPE would confer adequate protection for HCWs. only 68.5% stated that this protection was adequate for vulnerable patients. no significant correlation was found between self-reported adequate knowledge of both self-protection and patient protection. use of PPE will keep patients from getting H1N1 influenza 85.6% (196) 88.6% (373) 87.5% (569) Use of PPE will keep patients from getting H1N1 influenza 61.6% (141) 72.2% (304) 68.5% (445) PPE use inconvenient 47.1% (108) 51.3% (216) 49.8% (324) PPE use interfere with patient care 20.1% (46) 21.9% (92) 21.2% (138) 92.1% vs. 86.4%, p = 0.020) reported being reprimanded by supervisor for noncompliance. 361 (55.5%) reported high compliance (>80%) to PPE use. a similar proportion reported themselves to forget to change PPE between patients. univariate analysis OR (95%CI) multivariate analysis OR (95%CI) Profession Physician Ref.
