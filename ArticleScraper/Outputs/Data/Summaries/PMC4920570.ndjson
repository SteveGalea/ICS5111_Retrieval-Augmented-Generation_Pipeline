{"summary": "results The mean IPSS and mean age for males was 13.458.24 and 75.036.20 years, respectively. daily average temperature and daily temperature difference ranged from-3.4-28.3oC and 2.2-16.9oC. seasonal variations of visiting hospital patients between summer (June to September) and winter (january to March, November, December), it was highest in 2011 (29.0%) and lowest in 2009 (22.6%). seasonal variations of LUTS were reported in several small longitudinal studies. cold environmental stress and ambient temperature change elicited urinary sensations and frequent urination along with increasing heart rate and blood pressure. the study was conducted 36 times in 34 cities within seven major areas of south Korea. the numbers in parentheses refer to population. study area south Korea is located in the southern portion of the Korean peninsula. research, exclusion criteria were prior urological surgery, prior treatment for BPH, prostate cancer or OAB. evidence of a neurological condition; history of a malignancy; evidence of psychiatric illness; and evidence of alcohol or substance abuse. winters can be extremely cold with the minimum temperature dropping below -20oC (-4oF) in the inland region of the country: in Seoul, the average January temperature range is -7 to 1oC (19 to 34oF), and the average August temperature range is 22 to 30oC (72 to 86oF) the questionnaire consists of seven 6-point scale questions about symptoms of residual urine sensation, urinary frequency, interrupted stream, urinary urgency, weak urinary stream, urinary hesitancy, and nocturia. one 7-point scale question on patient satisfaction with their urinary condition was divided into three groups. the severity of LUTS associated with OAB for females was measured by using the OABSS questionnaire. the population was divided into two groups: coastal area (Incheon, Busan) and inland area (Seoul, Gyeonggi, Daejeon, Daegu, Gwangju) to examine the relationship between BPH/OAB and age, an analysis of variance (11) and a post hoc analysis were performed to identify any differences in IPSS/OABSS among each age group. the population was divided into two groups: coastal area (Incheon, Busan) and inland area (Seoul, Gyeonggi, Daejeon, Daegu, Gwangju) to examine the relationship between BPH/OAB and age in the population, an analysis of variance (11) and a post hoc analysis were performed to identify any differences in IPSS/OABSS among each age group. over 80 212 (23.0) 260 (16.6) IPSS severity groups Mild 284 (30.8) 1,117 (71.5) Moderate 454 (49.2) 378 (24.2) Severe 185 (20.0) 68 (4.4) Daily average temperature groups Low 267 (28.9) 452 (28.9) Medium 296 (32.1) 590 (37.7) High 360 (39.0) 521 (33.3) Daily temperature difference groups Low 349 (37.8) 475 (30.4) 3.1 2.2 46 2.9 6.0 36 2.3 2.6 27 2.9 6.2 23 2.5 2.6 25 1.6 6.2 43 2.8 3.7 17 1.8 6.5 59 6.4 3.7 15 1.0 6.5 70 4.5 4.8 22 2.4 7.0 64 6.9 4.8 61 3.9 7.0 91 5.8 5.4 36 3.9 7.3 24 2.6 5.4 33 2.1 7.3 12 0.8 6.0 25 2.7 6.0 63 4.0 7.5 37 2.4 7.9 39 22.2 24 2.6 11.0 13 1.4 22.2 12 0.8 10.7 25 1.6 24.2 23 2.5 11.5 30 3.3 24.2 43 2.8 11.0 29 1.9 25.4 123 13.3 11.6 19 2.1 25.4 45 2.9 11.5 89 5.7 25.7 29 3.1 14.4 21 2.3 25.7 36 2.3 11.6 13 0.8 25.8 28 3.0 16.9 61 6.6 25.8 35 2.2 14.4 38 2.4 26.1 42 4.6 26.1 43 0.000 172 2.83* 1.754 0.001 70 \u2013 79 539 13.01* 7.981 911 4.47* 3.082 538 2.70* 1.688 Over 80 212 15.21 8.860 260 4.90* 3.459 212 3.21 1.525 IPSS = International prostate symptom score; OABSS = Overactive bladder symptom score; QoL = Quality of life; IPSS & QoL are for male and OABSS is for female. 1 Frequency (OABSS 1) L 452 0.40 0.622 0.723 M 296 1.75 1.591 M 295 2.70 1.614 M 590 0.41 0.621 H 360 1.84 1.622 H 360 3.09 1.673 H 521 0.43 0.595 Frequency (IPSS 2) L 267 1.86 1.617 0.501 Nocturia (OABSS 2) L 452 1.94 0.898 0.774 M 296 1.95 1.511 M 590 1.
