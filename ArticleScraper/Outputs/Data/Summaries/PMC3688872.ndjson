{"summary": "rhesus macaques cloned with recombinant adenoviruses carrying a synthetic gene encoding hemagglutinin (HA) mAbs showed over 97% homology to human antibodies. in vivo protection experiments showed that the mAbs effectively protected the mice even when administered up to 3 days after infection with the virus. a method to rapidly generate and select neutralizing antibodies is urgently needed for the defense against new virulent pathogens. a method to rapidly generate and select neutralizing antibodies is urgently needed for the defense against new virulent pathogens. a human survivor may not be available during every outbreak. there are ethical and legal issues associated with using human subjects for immunizing an individual with a pathogen or antigen. there are concerns about the possibility of a catastrophic influenza pandemic. adenoviral vectors carrying synthetic genes encoding the target antigens allowed the rapid preparation of antigens without the need for the pathogen in hand. rhesus macaques (Macaca Mulata) cloned the macaque immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable regions and combined them with human constant regions to generate human-macaque chimeric mAbs. HA(04VN), and Ad5-HA(06ZJ) carry the full-length HA genes representing three different clades of H5N1 viruses. adenoviral vector-mediated expression of the HA proteins was confirmed using Western blot analysis of HEK293 cell lysates. the expression cassette, containing the HA gene under the control of the CMV promoter and BGH polyA signal, was cloned into the adenoviral neutralizing antibodies were determined using a micro-neutralization assay. the arrows indicate the time of immunization. the binding specificity of the sera against HA was determined. mRNA was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of immunized macaques. PCR products were used to construct scFv-presenting phage libraries for each macaque. each library contained approximately 2.4 x 107 clones. mAbs 4E6 and 4D5 showed the most similarity to the human VH4 family. the VH in 1H10 most closely resembled the human VH1-69 family. the immunofluorescent analysis confirmed the binding of these mAbs to viruses in cells infected with the three clades of the recombinant H5N1 viruses. infected with r97HKHA-PR8, r04VNHA-PR8, r06ZJHA-PR8 or A/Puerto Rico/8/34 were used to determine the binding of the mAbs. the mAbs demonstrated cross-clade neutralizing activities against these H5N1 viruses but not against the H1N1 virus PR8. 4E6 likely bound to an epitope on the globular head of HA. 1H10 bound to conformational epitope that is not associated with cell receptor binding but is important for the post-attachment step. the mAb 1H10 exhibited a high affinity (27.2 nM) to the HA protein of H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/04. both 4E6 and 4D5 mAbs contained a somewhat longer CDR-H3 (19 amino acids), which might have contributed to the high affinity and slow dissociation rate. mAbs were cloned from individuals infected with influenza virus CR6261. the human-macaque chimeric mAbs contain the human IgG constant region. the overall human homology of the most chimeric mAbs was greater than 97%. the mice were first infected intranasally with 10 LD50 of the H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1194/04. at 24 hours, 48 hours, or 72 hours post-infection, the mice were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of 4E6 or 1H10 at 10 mg/kg body weight. the mice that received the control IgG1 at 24 hours post-infection succumbed to infection. nucleoprotein (NP) demonstrated the strong expression of NP in the cytoplasm of the pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells in the mice treated with 4E6. 1H10 conferred 88% protection in the mice treated at 24, 48 or 72 hours after the lethal infection. data suggested that mAb 1H10 exhibits in vivo therapeutic efficacy against the H5N1 virus. mice treated with mAb 4E6 and 1H10 at 24 hours post-infection were used as the control group. the mice injected with an irrelevant IgG at 24 hours post-infection were used as the control group. recombinant replication-incompetent adenoviruses (Ad5), Ad5-HA(97HK), Ad5-HA(04VN) and Ad5-HA(06ZJ) carried the full-length HA genes representing three different clades of H5N1 viruses. adenoviral vector-mediated expression of the HA proteins was confirmed using Western blot analysis of HEK293 cell lysates. rhesus macaques were immunized with a mixture of 1x1011 viral particles of each Ad5-HA at weeks 0, 4, and 8 via intramuscular injection. the sera were collected from the macaques from 2 to 22 weeks. the neutralizing antibodies were maintained at high levels for at least 22 weeks. adenovirus-mediated expression of HA effectively elicited the production of neutralizing antibodies against HA proteins in rhesus macaques as early as two weeks after immunization. mRNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of immunized macaques and was used to construct an antibody phage library. each library contained approximately 2.4 x 107 clones. chimeric mAbs (8 in total) demonstrated strong neutralizing activities against all three clades of H5N1 viruses using a plaque-reduction assay and the r04VNHA-PR8, r97HKHA-PR8 and r06ZJHA-PR8 viruses. mAbs 4E6 and 4D5 contained a somewhat longer CDRH3 measuring 19 amino acid residues. mAbs 4E6 and 4D5 showed the most similarity r97HKHA-PR8, r04VNHA-PR8, r06ZJHA-PR8 and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 were used to determine the binding of the mAbs. the mAbs demonstrated cross-clade neutralizing activities against these H5N1 viruses but not against the H1N1 virus PR8. we performed a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay for the three mAbs. results indicated that 4E6 and 4D5 blocked the binding of the virion to the cell surface receptor, whereas 1H10 likely affected the post-attachment process. the mAb 4E6 exhibited an extremely high affinity of 22.3 pM. the mAb 1H10 exhibited a high affinity (27.2 nM) to the HA protein. both 4E6 and 4D5 mAbs contained a somewhat longer CDR-H3 (19 amino acids), which might have contributed to the high affinity and slow dissociation rate for the HA protein. the association rates (ka), dissociation rates (kd) and affinity constants (K D) were evaluated using a 1:1 Langmuir binding. we analyzed the amino acid sequence in the macaque framework region. all three mAbs scored within the range for human-derived mAbs. mAbs 4E6 and 1H10 in mice infected with a lethal dose of the H5N1 virus. the mice were first infected intranasally with 10 LD50 of the virus. at 24 hours, 48 hours, or 72 hours post-infection, the mice were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of 4E6 or 1H10 at 10 mg/kg body weight. mAb 1H10 conferred 88% protection in the mice treated at 24, 48 or 72 hours after the lethal infection. 1H10 conferred 88% protection in the mice treated at 24, 48 or 72 hours after the lethal infection. mAb 4E6 represents a unique mAb with superior potency for inhibiting the H5N1 virus. mice were infected via intranasal inoculation with 10 LD50 of A/Vietnam/1203/4. mice injected with an irrelevant IgG at 24 hours post-infection were used as the control group. mAbs are a good alternative in the event of a virulent infectious outbreak. immunizing rhesus macaques using adenoviral vectors carrying a synthetic gene encoding the antigen will be of great practical use and significance. overall process could be completed in approximately two months and entail the following five major steps. the corresponding rhesus VH and human VH genes are approximately 92%. chimeric antibodies on the market contain murine-derived VH and VL and human immunoglobulin constant regions. 40% of human-mouse chimeric antibodies encounter significant human anti-antibody responses. mAbs showed high affinities at sub-picomolar to nanomolar levels. the mAb 4E6 exhibited the highest affinity for H5N1 VN04HA. 4E6 mAb showed a slow dissociation rate to the HA protein. mAb 4E6 conferred 100% protection in mice at 24 and 48 hours after infection. mAb 4E6 conferred 88% protection in mice at 72 hours after infection. a single treatment completely inactivated the H5N1 VN/04 virus in all the treated groups. a single mutation at D183 or K/R189 in HA did not diminish binding of 4E6. a virus would need two mutations, at both D183 and K189, to escape neutralization by 4E6. mAbs could be cloned from single B cells or antibody-secreting plasma cells (ASC) d5-HA from influenza virus H5N1 was generated based on homologous recombination. the expression cassette was cloned into the adenoviral E1 region. recombinant adenoviruses were produced in 293 cells. rhesus macaques were immunized with a mixture of the three AdH5-HA viruses. one micro liter of blood from each rhesus macaque was collected every two weeks for plasma antibody examination. the animals were housed in adjoining individual primate cages allowing social interactions. primers targeted the conserved motifs in framework region 1 and the joining and constant regions of the H- and L-chain genes. based on the reported macaque light-chain sequence, we designed primers for 3 IGKV subgroups and 4 IGLV subgroups. the sequences were analyzed using the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (IMGT) the selected scFvs were converted into full-length antibodies by cloning the VH and VL sequences in-frame into the human IgG1 constant regions, HC and LC. the expression vectors were modified based on the backbone of the pGI-neo vector. 50 l of influenza virus at 100 TCID(50) was incubated with 50 l of a two-fold dilution of the purified IgG for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C in a 96-well plate containing an MDCK cell monolayer. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 days in minimal essential medium containing bovine albumin. the neutralization titer was defined as the highest dilution of antibody. the HA protein was injected over each flow cell in HBS-EP buffer at a flow rate of 30 l/min at concentrations 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.625 nM. the experiments included an additional anti-human IgG Fc antibody control surface to account for changes in the refractive index of the buffer. mice were inoculated intranasally with 10LD50 of H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1194/04 in a volume of 50 l. a human IgG was used as the negative control and was injected at 24 hours after infection. 3 mice from each group were sacrificed on day 6 post-infection. replication-incompetent adenoviruses were generated based on homologous recombination. recombinant replication-incompetent adenoviruses were produced in 293 cells. the HA genes were optimized according to preferred codon usage. the recombinant influenza viruses were generated using a reverse genetics system. at forty-eight hours after transfection, the supernatant from the transfected cells was collected and inoculated into the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. the correct sequences of the recombinant viruses were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. primers used to amplify the rhesus macaque heavy-chain and light-chain variable regions were designed based on previous publications of the rhesus macaque immunoglobulin gene sequences. the sequences were grouped into the 7VH, 6V, 11V, and 7JH families in accordance with the IMGT nomenclature. ANTab 5E phage display vector was performed as described previously. positive clones from the enriched phage pools were analyzed using ELISA against influenza viruses. the sequences were compared with the sequences of human immunoglobulin genes. the bound antibodies were detected using Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG secondary antibody under confocal microscopy. the neutralizing antibody titers were determined as described previously [40]. anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Biacore) was covalently attached to the flow cell surfaces of a CM5 sensor chip. the mAbs were captured by the anti-human Fc surface. the HA protein was injected over each flow cell in HBS-EP buffer. in vivo protection experiment, 10 mice per group were inoculated intranasally with 10LD50 of H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1194/04 in a volume of 50 l. 3 mice from each group were sacrificed on day 6 post-infection. the lung sections were stained using an anti-influenza nucleoprotein mAb (HB65; ATCC) at a 1:5,000 dilution, goat anti-mouse IgG, H and L chain-specific biotin conjugates (Calbiochem) at a 1:2,000 dilution, and streptavidin/peroxidase complex reagent (Vector Laboratories) GI value was achieved by online analysis at http://www.imgt.org/3Dstructure-DB/cgi/DomainGapAlign.cgi. alignment rhesus macaque heavy chain and light chain variable regions with closest human germline genes."}
