{"summary": "traditional medical approaches dealing with migrant health have focused on the recognition, identification and management of specific diseases, illnesses or health concerns in mobile populations at the time and place of their arrival [2]. migrant medical screening has been used to quantify and document aspects of health and disease in migrant cohorts, most commonly. the growing international importance of migration has stimulated interest in other aspects of migrant health. attention is now focused on pre-existing non-infectious diseases [9] and other health domains, including behaviour [10], morality [11] and genetic or ethnic profiles [12] in migrant populations. interest in the global implications of the epidemiological aspects of migration is growing. population health-based approach to migration health is based on the standardised examination of two factors: (1) sustained disparate health environments and (2) the movement of populations between regions of differential prevalence of health indicators and outcomes. population-based methods reflect the nature and role of globalisation and can be used to support and rationalise strategies to deal with health challenges at their source. diseases include vector-borne conditions, for which environmental factors determine the distribution of disease transmission. environmentally-related non-communicable disease epidemiological disparities include micronutrient deficiencies [27] and geographically-defined exposure risks, such as health outcomes related to extreme weather or altitude [28] social and economic influences can be significant factors in the creation and maintenance of differences in health and disease outcomes between populations. poverty, education, housing and nutrition are directly related to disease prevalence and illness outcomes. the impact of different health environments and the phases of population mobility Occurrence Examples Consequence at Destination Pre-departure existing medical condition - prevalence of endemic disease - level of development - access to care - availability of care. changes in health outcomes can be observed over relatively short periods of time. in the thirty years following 1965, the difference between life expectancy for males increased by more than ten years. conflict, environmental change, natural disasters and population growth can result in new risk exposures. migration and concomitant movement of other mobile populations has been markedly influenced by: 1. the decolonialisation of many nations, including those in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. between 1960 and 2000 the legal and administrative restrictions on the ability to travel, work and move internationally have changed for hundreds of millions of individuals. this has been associated with a profound shift in the demography of people on the move and the nature of migration itself. movement and resettlement of these populations are now global in scope and planning, involve an increasing number of nations and take place more rapidly than historical refugee resettlements. travel patterns have been affected by changes in transportation technology, accessibility, and affordability. growth in air travel has functionally reduced previous limits on rapid international movement of large numbers of individuals. the epidemiological consequences of mobility across differentials in disease prevalence In much of the developed world, infections that were historically significant causes of illness and death have decreased in incidence and prevalence. this was accomplished through sanitation, immunisation, antibiotic therapy, and improved healthcare and public health practices. by the end of the last millennium, several globally important infections had reached the point where they were no longer of public health significance. global extension of regional epidemiological differences can have marked impact on local epidemiology of disease. foreign-born migrants from hyper-endemic areas represent the majority of national case burden in low incidence or non-endemic nations. similar patterns of epidemiological evolution exist for long-term infections such as hepatitis B and C, as well as HIV/AIDS in some European nations. migration-associated influences on the epidemiology of disease have both immediate and long-term effects on host country health indicators. for diseases of rare or limited occurrence, the presentation of even a single case can have important implications locally and internationally. this can result in a heightened perception of threat to the public health of the local population. migration-associated pressures result from need to provide service delivery in culturally or linguistically sensitive programmes. reintroduction of diseases into low incidence locations through migration coupled with the growth of new populations can create difficulties in recognition, diagnosis and treatment. growing needs for cultural and linguistic competencies in the health sector increases this complexity [98] global health programs in universities and medical/nursing schools. development of specialized reference centers and international networks. migration and migration of health professionals from migrant source regions. some nations with large immigration medical programs maintain specific screening or intervention programs for targeted diseases such as tuberculosis, syphilis and HIV/AIDS. international collaboration is underway to track and monitor disease in the global context. mobility will become a more important determination factor influencing many health outcomes, along with age, sex, genetics, biology, behaviour and educational and wealth attainment. international intervention programs for specific diseases at the migrants' country of origin may be more effective than national intervention programs dealing with low incidence diseases. epidemiological impact of population mobility is now evident in a considerable amount of infectious disease surveillance information. similar impacts can be anticipated for non-infectious illnesses in immigration receiving nations. national health programs and policies in migrant receiving nations will be challenged by illness and disease arising beyond their jurisdiction. medical and health sectors can affect health through availability, accessibility and affordability of health promotion, disease prevention and treatment services [31,32] additional factors that influence health risks and outcomes include language skills [33], behavioural and cultural practices [34,35], such as the use of tobacco, dietary practices and population norms for body mass and physical exercise [36],. migration-specific health influences are observed in refugees, displaced persons and disadvantaged migrant populations such as trafficked or smuggled persons [39-41] migrant populations may be limited by immigration status, poverty, language and culture Working conditions may be associated with health risks. health systems improvements or declines Children born to foreign-born parents have no exposure to risks present at origin. differences in health determinants and disease outcomes are not absolute, but change over time. health outcomes for current departing migrants may differ significantly from previous cohorts originating at the same location, as health indicators change over time at the migrants' place of origin. some of these changes are significant, as indicated by the changing mortality data due to hypertensive cardiac disease in Korea. patterns of migrant origin have shifted from Europe to source countries in Asia, Africa, Central and South America and the Middle East. this evolution has not been limited to regulated, traditional immigration and emigration. it has also involved refugee and humanitarian movements and an increase in irregular arrivals. complex humanitarian emergencies are often associated with large population displacements of refugees, humanitarian evacuees and other displaced populations. the international labour force estimates the foreign-born migrant labour force to be nearly 90 million persons worldwide [60] in several locations, there is a repetitive flow of workers between regions of origin and regions of employment. modern population pressures and economic push-pull factors are increasingly associated with irregular population flows facilitated by either smuggling or trafficking of those seeking a better life. migrant-receiving nations can become the source for outbreaks of non-infectious diseases. the ability to treat and manage non-infectious diseases in highly developed regions of the world likewise differs from the situation in many developing regions. migrants may present with disease in more advanced stages than normally observed by providers in the destination country. migration-associated epidemiological changes relate to situations where migrants are less advantaged than the host population. the continued arrival of new residents from high prevalence areas will contribute to the existing disease base of low incidence migrant-receiving locations. the continued arrival of new residents from high prevalence areas will contribute to the existing disease base of low incidence migrant-receiving locations. in these situations, domestic epidemiology comes to reflect global disease distribution through the process of migration. growing needs for cultural and linguistic competencies in the health sector increases complexity. such preparedness requires education, training and maintenance of competence of healthcare providers and the associated infrastructure for diagnosis and care. global efforts to reduce global disparities and impacts of disease and ill health are underway. the longer inter-regional disparities in health and health outcomes persist, the longer they will continue to influence the health of migrants, as well as mobile and non-mobile populations. the greater the challenge and cost will be to effect control of these conditions. international collaboration is underway to track and monitor disease in the global context. some of these activities are represented by the internationalisation of epidemiological surveillance, reporting and response reflected in the recent revision to the International Health Regulations [105]. migration and population mobility are evolving at a rate that creates health challenges for existing policy and programme frameworks that differ from those observed in historic migratory movements. national and international health programs and policies in migrant receiving nations will continue to be challenged by illness and disease arising beyond their jurisdiction."}
