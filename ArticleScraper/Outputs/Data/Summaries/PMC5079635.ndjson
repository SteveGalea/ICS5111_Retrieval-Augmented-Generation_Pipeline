{"summary": "in 2000, the university of Alberta reported that transplantation of purified islet products resulted in sustained C-peptide levels, improved glycemic control, and prevention of hypoglycemia. the results were later confirmed by Brennan et al. in a multicenter trial reporting the 12-year follow-up of seven subjects with type 1 diabetes. manufacturing information was submitted to a DAIT/NIAID-sponsored U.S. Investigational New Drug application and a Clinical Trial Application in Canada. chemistry, manufacturing, and controls monitoring committee was responsible for the harmonization of manufacturing processes. each product was manufactured and transplanted at the same institution. identification/quantity (dithizone [DTZ]) (35), and biological potency (glucose stimulated insulin release [GSIR] by ELISA) (41) were qualified at each facility before that facility\u2019s participation in the trial. all operations were conducted using aseptic processing in accredited cGMP facilities.

Individuals who have received pituitary human growth hormone 15. pancreas was perfused with one of three enzyme blend solutions containing a collagenase and a protease. perfusion occurred for 4\u201310 min at 60\u201380 mmHg followed by 4\u20136 min at 160\u2013180 mmHg at 4\u201314\u00b0C. a sample of the preservation solution was taken for sterility testing. digestion step Tissue digestion began with recirculation of the Enzyme Solution (phase 1) to dissociate the pancreas followed by a dilution phase (phase 2) in which the enzymes were neutralized by cooling and dilution. the flow rate was set to 210\u2013250 mL/min until the set temperature was reached and then reduced to 90\u2013130 mL/min. to dilution was based on the number of islets, percent free islets, and percent fragmented islets (23) the flow rate was increased back to 210\u2013250 mL/min, and the temperature was reduced to 30\u00b0C. the eluate containing the islets was pooled, centrifuged, washed with cold CIT Wash Solution (27), and resuspended in cold CIT Purification Solution (22). culture Step Purified islets were cultured for 36\u201372 h in nontreated flasks. high-purity islet fractions were cultured at 37\u00b0C/5% CO2 for the first 12\u201324 h and at 22\u00b0C/5% CO2 for the remaining time. the final product was kept at room temperature and transplanted within 6 h of bag fill. lots were released for transplant by using an interim COA (ICOA) the final COA was issued when the sterility and postculture GSIR tests became available. DTZ staining was used for identification of islets, quantification of IEQ, purity determination, and categorization by size ranges (35). the results are expressed as the stimulation index. process yield refers to the proportion of IEQ recovered relative to the starting IEQ. categorical variables are displayed as number and percent. relationship of donor characteristics to IEQ recovery was analyzed by stepwise regression. the perfused pancreas was cut into 5\u201315 pieces and placed in a digestion chamber. the weight of tissue trimmed during perfusion was calculated by subtracting the weight of tissue trimmed during perfusion. the flow rate was set to 210\u2013250 mL/min until the set temperature was reached and then reduced to 90\u2013130 mL/min. freed islets were eluted in the diluting buffer and collected. samples were taken throughout digestion and assessed by DTZ staining (35) to determine the time to switch from phase 1 to phase 2 (45) purified fractions were classified as high (70%), middle (40\u201369%), and low (30\u201339%) purity. supplementary purification was performed using biocoll (Biochrome AG, Berlin, Germany) (25), polysucrose discontinuous gradients (Mediatech) (24), or OptiPrep (Nycomed/Takeda, Osaka, Japan) (26). all purity fractions were pooled into a single infusion bag. if total settled tissue volume was 7.5 mL, the tissue was divided into two or three infusion bags. the final product was maintained at room temperature and transplanted within 6 h of bag fill. in and microscopic examination Islets present in each product bag Volumes in bags Suspension volume Direct measurement 200 mL per product bag 600 mL total in three product bags Settled tissue volume Direct measurement after 5-min settling 7.5 mL per product bag 15.0 mL total in three product bags Potency GSIR (high-purity islets, preculture sample) ELISA Stimulation index >1 Islet quantity DTZ stain and microscopic examination 70% in each product a total of 324 pancreata were processed for use in all CIT clinical protocols. the overall success rate in producing PHPI lots was 52.5%. the main factor associated with manufacturing failure was insufficient number of islets to meet the required product dose. values are expressed as median (IQR) as a measure of variability. 57 27 44 39 35 58 19 37 324 PHPI lots transplanted. 93 (46) 109 (28) 103 (40) 101 (63) 102 (64) 112

digested tissue collected from the Ricordi chamber. the mean duration of phase 2 was 34 9 min (range 8\u201357 min) the median tissue volume after phase 2 was 44 (16) mL. middle- and low-purity islet fractions were incubated at 22\u00b0C/5% CO2 for the remainder of the culture period. all fractions were cultured at 22\u00b0C/5% CO2 for the remainder of the culture period. each of the 75 PHPI lots was released for transplantation in 1 (n = 54), 2 (n = 20), or 3 (n = 1) infusion bags. median settled tissue volume was 4.0 (3.8) mL and contained 6,694 (2,800) IEQ/kg recipient BW. median viability was 94% (6%) in the high-purity sample. final recovery of IEQ correlated with donor sex and BMI. no other donor or pancreas characteristics were significantly related to IEQ recovery after adjustment for donor sex and BMI. the decision to switch to dilution (phase 2) was based on visual examination of 1\u20132-mL samples of digested tissue collected from the Ricordi chamber. the mean duration of phase 2 was 34 9 min (range 8\u201357 min) the median (IQR) packed tissue volume after phase 2 was 44 (16) mL, and contained 708,470 (382,000) IEQ. middle- and low-purity islet fractions were incubated at 22\u00b0C/5% CO2 for the remainder of the culture period. median total islet count postculture was 490,174 (226,835) IEQ, representing a total islet recovery of 4,730 (2,156) IEQ/g trimmed pancreas. each of the 75 PHPI lots was released for transplantation in 1 (n = 54), 2 (n = 20), or 3 (n = 1) infusion bags. median settled tissue volume was 4.0 (3.8) mL and contained 6,694 (2,800) IEQ/kg recipient BW at a concentration of 134,813 (131,407) IEQ/mL settled tissue. methods for large-scale isolation and purification of adult human pancreatic islets have substantially improved over the past three decades. advances in islet processing technology, immunosuppression, immunomodulation, and peritransplant anti-inflammatory strategies have contributed to progressive improvement of clinical results. a major standardization effort was undertaken to ensure product and process consistency. we identified the donor pancreas and the enzyme blends as critical components of the PHPI manufacturing process. in 2007, the most widely used enzyme for manufacture of islet products became unavailable. cGMP manufacturing process defined in common CIT documents yielded product lots that met prespecified criteria for safety, purity, potency, and identity. no case of primary nonfunction was observed after transplantation of PHPI lots (18). product licensure will be important to improve patient access (with third-party coverage) to PHPI transplantation and to facilitate the development of second-generation islet products.
