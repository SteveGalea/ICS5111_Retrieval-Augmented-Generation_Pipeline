{"summary": "traditional vaccines have been developed using live attenuated organisms. the use of attenuated pathogens can revert to a more active form. the use of attenuated pathogens can revert to a more active form. successful adjuvants need to be safe and well tolerated, simply produced and with inexpensive compounds, biodegradables, compatible with many different antigens. if adequate epitopes were identified for a certain disease, antigens could be synthesized on demand. if adequate epitopes were identified for a certain disease, antigens could be synthesized on demand. in response to microbes, DCs undergo a process of maturation into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) they migrate from the periphery to the draining lymph nodes, where they present antigens to the T lymphocytes. cytolytic cells must specifically recognize pathogen-derived antigens presented in MHC class I or in the CD1-lipid complex. micro- and nanoparticulated delivery systems can lead good opportunities in the development of synthetic peptide-based vaccines. the difference in size between micro- and nanoparticles may change the immune response achieved. this can lead to a substantial loss of payload or to a lower maximum drug loading for smaller particles. alum is the most widely used adjuvant for human vaccines. it is used in various vaccines, such as the combined vaccine containing antigens against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertusiss [20] and against hepatitis B. more recently, other particulate adjuvants have been licensed for human use. fluad MF59 Influenza/pandemic flu [20] Pandemrix AS03 Pandemic flu [21] Fendrix AS04 Hepatitis A [24] Epaxal Virosomes Hepatitis A [22] Inflexal Virosomes Influenza [23] Cervarix AS04 + VLPs Human papillomavirus [25, 26] Gardasil VLPs + Alum Human papillomavirus [27] alum aluminiu salts have been widely used in humans for more than 80 years. alum adjuvancity is associated with enhanced antibody responses. alum enhances the production of IL-10, a Th2 cytokine. alum inhibits IP-10 (IFN-inducible protein), a chemokine specific for Th1 cells. it has been shown that alum induces rapid cell recruitment at the injection site. it has been shown that alum induces rapid cell recruitment at the injection site. Eisenbarth et al. [37] and Li et al. [38] found an abrogation of the antibody responses to coadministered antigen in absence of NALP3 signaling. however, these results may be explained by the fact that different alum formulations were used in each study or different levels of agonist were used. alum adjuvants intranasally administered with five synthetic peptide antigens of Plasmodium vivax in alum and microparticles. addition of alum to CpG increased four-fold the antibody titers and triggered a predominance of IgG2a/2b isotypes. there are two formulations approved for human use in Europe, MF59 and AS03. Tsai et al. analysed the clinical trial database of Novartis Vaccine studies from 1991 to 2009. found that distribution of pregnancy outcomes was similar in subjects exposed to MF59 compared to non exposed ones at any time of pregnancy. despite the wide use of MF59, its mechanism of action is not well understood. a recent clinical trial suggests that pandemrix used in children 6\u201335 months old is highly immunogenic and that overall reactogenicity profile is acceptable. however, to our knowledge, no study has been published that combines the use of synthetic peptides and MF59 or AS03. the results of this study are not yet published. the most commonly used polymers are poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and its derivates. they are biodegradable and biocompatible, are able to release molecules during long periods of time. PLGA has been approved for human use in sutures [61], bone implants [62], and screws [63] as well as in implants for sustained drug delivery [64]. intradermally administered small-sized polystyrene particles (200 nm) were rapidly transported to the lymph nodes, where they were taken up by resident DCs. however, large particles (500\u20132000 nm) depended on cellular transport by skin DCs. the administration route of particles may influence the immune response elicited. PLGA microspheres loaded with antigen (ovalbumin) were preferentially internalized by DCs. these particles elicited potent humoral and cellular immunity against ovalbumin. PLGA micro- and nanospheres can be used for systemic or mucosal immunization. PLGA microspheres have been extensively studied by our research group. different synthetic peptides have been entrapped into these microspheres. they have been administered by subcutaneous, intradermal, oral [17] or nasal [90] routes in mice. phipathic antigens are integrated into the phospholipid bilayer, and lipidic antigens are adsorbed to the liposomes surface. cationic liposomes have a better ability to initiate and potentiate the immune response. liposomes composition may also affect the type of immune response achieved. liposomes grafted to synthetic peptides derived from DCs maturation signals, such as HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1), are able to target macrophages and DCs in vitro and in vivo. liposomes can also induce antigen-specific antitumor immunity. UC1-conjugated VLPs were subcutaneously administered to MUC1 transgenic mice. this led to a robust activation of bone marrow-derived DCs. the vaccine induced MUC1-specific CTL delayed the growth of MUC1 transplanted tumors. virosomal approved vaccines are composed of influenza virosomes. virosomes maintain the receptor-binding and membrane fusion activity of the viral haemagglutinin. virosomes enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. IgG antibodies against UK-39 inhibited invasion of hepatocytes by P. falciparum sporozoites. a second peptide (AMA49-C1) based on domain III of apical membrane antigen 1 induced antibodies that inhibited blood-stage parasite growth in vitro. both vaccines resulted safe, as no serious or severe adverse events were observed. ISCOMATRIX adjuvant particles are typically rigid, hollow, spherical, and cage-like particles approximately 40 nm in diameter. different results have been obtained when evaluating ISCOMs immunogenicity. ISCOMATRIX adjuvants can be used in vaccines for induction of mucosal immune responses. protective ability of ISCOMATRIX adjuvanted vaccines has been reported [135], and they have been used in some veterinarian vaccines [136]. nanobeads are as effective as ISCOMs in inducing antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. beads of 40\u201350 nm are better internalized by DCs than higher ones. larger beads facilitate CD4+ response. alum induces rapid cell recruitment at the injection site. alum targets NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3 or NALP3) to mediate caspase-1 activation and IL-1 release in LPS- primed macrophages. Eisenbarth et al. [37] and Li et al. [38] found an abrogation of the antibody responses to coadministered antigen in absence of NALP3 signaling. however, these results may be explained by the fact that different alum formulations were used in each study or different levels of agonist were used. alum adjuvants intranasally administered with five synthetic peptide antigens of Plasmodium vivax in alum and microparticles. addition of alum to CpG increased four-fold the antibody titers and triggered a predominance of IgG2a/2b isotypes. Tsai et al. analysed the clinical trial database of Novartis Vaccine studies from 1991 to 2009. found that distribution of pregnancy outcomes was similar in subjects exposed to MF59 compared to non exposed ones at any time of pregnancy, specifically in early pregnancy. a recent clinical trial suggests that pandemrix used in children 6\u201335 months old is highly immunogenic and that overall reactogenicity profile is acceptable. however, to our knowledge, no study has been published that combines the use of synthetic peptides and MF59 or AS03. the most commonly used polymers are poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) due to their inherent advantages over other systems. they are biodegradable and biocompatible, are able to release molecules during long periods of time (weeks or months), and ease to administer via injection [59] or orally [60]. PLGA has been approved for human use in sutures [61], bone implants [62], as well as in implants for sustained drug delivery [64]. NPs were efficiently phagocytized by macrophages and elicited lower antibody titers. NPs (200\u2013600 nm) were effectively phagocytized by macrophages and elicited lower antibody titers. however, higher levels of IFN- production, upregulation of MHC class II molecules and antibody isotypes favouring Th1-type immune response. PLGA microspheres loaded with antigen (ovalbumin) were preferentially internalized by DCs compared to nonmodified particles. these particles elicited potent humoral and cellular immunity against ovalbumin, and wild-type macrophages increased the release of IL-1. PLGA microspheres have been extensively studied by our research group. different synthetic peptides have been entrapped into these microspheres. they have been administered by subcutaneous, intradermal [89], oral [17], or nasal [90] routes in mice. cationic liposomes have a better ability to initiate and potentiate the immune response. cationic liposomes have a better ability to initiate and potentiate the immune response. liposomes composition may also affect the type of immune response achieved. liposomes grafted to synthetic peptides derived from DCs maturation signals, such as HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1), are able to target macrophages and DCs in vitro and in vivo. liposomes can also induce antigen-specific antitumor immunity. MUC1-conjugated VLPs were subcutaneously administered to MUC1 transgenic mice, leading to a robust activation of bone marrow-derived DCs. in addition, immunization of human MUC1 transgenic mice delayed growth of MUC1 transplanted tumors and elicited complete tumor rejection. virosomal approved vaccines (Inflexal and Epaxal) are composed of influenza virosomes. virosomes maintain the receptor-binding and membrane fusion activity of the viral haemagglutinin. virosomes enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. IgG antibodies against UK-39 inhibited invasion of hepatocytes by P. falciparum sporozoites. a second peptide (AMA49-C1) based on domain III of apical membrane antigen 1 induced antibodies that inhibited blood-stage parasite growth in vitro. both vaccines resulted safe, as no serious or severe adverse events were observed.

ISCOMATRIX adjuvants can be used in vaccines for induction of mucosal immune responses. protective ability of ISCOMATRIX adjuvanted vaccines has been reported [135], and they have been used in some veterinarian vaccines [136]. nanobeads are as effective as ISCOMs in inducing antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. beads of 40\u201350 nm are better internalized by DCs than higher ones. larger beads facilitate CD4+ response. signalling receptors act as primary sensor of pathogens and damage. receptors can be located on plasma membrane, in different internal compartments, or in membranes from intracellular vesicles. other PPRs have a critical role in activating antigen presentation. most of the novel vaccine formulations comprise a combination of adjuvants. the most common combination of adjuvants with different action mechanism is the use of a vaccine delivery system which contains the antigen and an immune potentiating adjuvant. some of the licensed vaccines are comprised of a mixture of adjuvants, such as Gardasil and alum. a much higher uptake was observed for mannose-, WGA-, and RGD-grafted microspheres. the uptake was not significantly different from ungrafted microspheres. TLR activation leads to upregulation of CD40, CD80, CD86, and CD70 costimulatory molecules. ed RNA [158], TLR5 attaches to flagellin [159], TLR7 and TLR8 recognize single-stranded viral RNA [160] and synthetic imidazoquinolines [161], and TLR9 recognizes DNA rich in nonmethylated CpG (cytosine-phosphorothioate-guanine) [162]. poly(I:C) induces maturation of DCs [166], is a potent IFN inducer PLGA microparticles are effectively phagocytized by DCs ex vivo. they induce a maturation similar to that achieved with a cytokine cocktail. other delivery systems have been prepared which target other DC receptors. these carriers incorporate antibodies or molecules that specifically interact with receptors. targeting antigens to dendritic cells Vaccine delivery systems can incorporate ligands in order to specifically target APCs receptors. ligand grafting can enhance the uptake of microparticles by immune cells. ligand grafting can enhance the uptake of microparticles by immune cells. antigens and TLR ligands can generate more potent immune responses when coencapsulated into the same particle. there are at least 13 members of TLRs, which recognize different microbial components. TLR2 recognize bacterial lipoproteins and lipopeptides. intranasal administration induced mucosal immunity able to protect mice from the virus challenge. other frequently used TLR ligands are those directed to TLR3. poly(I:C) induces maturation of DCs [166]. delivery systems have the ability to trigger the phagocytosis of entrapping synthetic peptides by DCs and promote their maturation. they can be degraded by proteases, possess limited bioavailability, and present relatively low immunogenicity. delivery systems can improve and/or modulate the response achieved with soluble peptides alone."}
