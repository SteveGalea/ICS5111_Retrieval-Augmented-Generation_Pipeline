{"summary": "intracellular pathogens evade humoral immune responses of the host by hiding inside cells of the host organism. these activities require the manipulation of the normal host cell processes to avoid killing by the host cell. one group of intracellular bacteria resides in specialized membrane compartments that derive from the endosomal system of the host cell. the formation of SIF in epithelial cells starts from 3\u20134 h after invasion by fusion events of the SCV with endosomal vesicles. these early SIF are highly dynamic tubules which often exhibit a thinner appearing part at the distal end, termed leading SIF (LS) from 8 h post infection (p.i.) a complex tubular network is established which appears stable and less dynamic. intracellular Salmonella deploy the SPI2-T3SS to translocate a set of effector proteins across the membrane of SCV. effector proteins enable intracellular survival and proliferation of Salmonella. most severe phenotype is mediated by the SPI2 effector SifA [15] a combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) of live infected cells followed by ultrastructural analyses by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron tomography provide a novel view on the intracellular activities of Salmonella leading to unique compartmentalization of the host endosomal membranes. single and double membrane SIT extend from the SCV in salmonella-infected cells. Electron micrographs of ultrathin sections through HeLa cells infected with p.i. cells were subjected to HPF-FS at 10 h post infection (p.i.) extended analyses of ultrathin sections by TEM revealed a variety of SIT morphotypes and an unexpected membrane organization of the tubular compartments. the latter tubules were characterized by a lumen containing electron-dense granules and vesicles, reminiscent of the luminal content of late endosomes or endolysosomes. 74.2% displayed type 2 SIT, 6.5% of cells showed both types. diameters revealed for type 1 SIT average diameters for single membrane tubules of 12046 nm (N = 7 cells with 5 measurements per SIT) and for type 2 SIT, the average diameter of double membrane tubules was 22165 nm (N = 30 cells with 5 measurements per SIT) microtubules and microtubules were not successful, probably due to insufficient preservation. the ultrastructure-based localization of cytoskeletal filaments inside type 2 SIT clearly emphasizes their prominent role in the biogenesis of SIT. the inner space of all double-membrane SIT (A\u2013E) also contains ribosomes. the interior space of type 2 SIT (A\u2013E) is either continuous with the host cell cytosol or represents a partial volume of cytosol enwrapped by double membranes during formation of the tubule. LAMP1-GFP and Gold-BSA-Rhodamine showed comparable high co-localization in either non-infected cells. the intensity of Rhodamine fluorescence increased with the duration of the pulse and consequently with the amount of the marker accumulated. live cell imaging was performed 8 h p.i. to visualize LAMP1-GFP-positive SIF. the cells were fixed and processed for CLEM to reveal the ultrastructure of selected cells. this approach allowed us to follow the integrity and dynamics of LAMP1-GFP-positive tubular structures in living infected cells. the inner and outer membrane of a SIF and SCV are outlined in orange and yellow. light and dark red arrowheads indicate inner and outer membrane of the Salmonella cell envelope. a cell representative for 10 biological replicates is shown. LS in light microscopy correlated with single membrane SIT of thinner diameter and electron-dense content, similar to type 1 SIT. the observed type 1 SIT or LS are of late endosomal/lysosomal origin and serve as precursor of type 2 SIT or TS. both morphological structures represent LAMP1-positive SIF in salmonella WT-infected cells. double membrane SIF with luminal membrane vesicle. orange and yellow arrowheads indicate inner and outer membranes if double membrane SIF, respectively. white arrowheads indicate single membrane SIF. CLEM of activated and Salmonella WT-infected RAW264.7 LAMP1-GFP cells revealed single membrane tubules at 8 h p.i. CLEM of activated and Salmonella WT-infected RAW264.7 LAMP1-GFP cells revealed single membrane tubules at 8 h p.i. microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is a well-established marker of autophagy and its proteolytically processed form, LC3-II, associates with membranes of the phagophore, autophagosome and autolysosome [28], [29] microscopy of living cells showed a small fraction of intracellular bacteria (app. 5\u201310%) was associated with LC3b. transfected cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding mCherry-ATG5-K130R. CLSM revealed a reduction in SIF formation compared to non-transfected HeLa cells. non-transfected HeLa cells infected by Salmonella WT showed only 56.66.1% SIF formation. infected cells were first pulse-chased with either BSA-Rhodamine (without gold NP) or HRP (Figure S10) to allow accumulation of the reagent within endocytic compartments including SCV and SIF. the outer lumen of double membrane SIF is in interchange with endocytosed material. live cell CLSM (D, H, single Z plane) and TEM (E\u2013G, I\u2013K) micrographs show a higher magnification of double membrane SIF. a cell representative of three biological replicates is shown (1\u20133 technical replicates with each 2\u20134 cells) membrane tubules with cytosolic content inside the inner lumen (i.e. type 2 SIT) and electron-dense DAB product localizes inside the SCV with direct contact to Salmonella and inside the outer lumen of double membrane SIF. the inner lumen was virtually devoid of the marker (Figure 7F). PFA-fragmented SIF in sseF or sseG-infected HeLa cells are also known as pseudo-SIF [21]. tubular membrane compartments induced by the sseF strain were maintained after fixation with para-formaldehyde (GA) used conventionally for TEM. sseF-infected HeLa cells exhibit thin LAMP1-positive tubules. the single membrane tubule is indicated by arrowheads. CLEM experiments with HRP showed a similar phenotype. expressing sseF200\u2013205 contained only thinner single membrane SIF. CLEM analyses of cells infected with the sseG-deficient strain showed results similar to the sseF strain. sseG-infected cells displayed single membrane SIF with electron-dense content. the effector proteins SseF and SseG are not required for formation of single membrane SIF (type 2 SIT) but are essential for biogenesis of double membrane SIF (type 2 SIT), while ectopic expression of SifA is sufficient to induce single membrane tubules. a type 2 SIT with an inner space filled by a bundle of actin-like filaments, while SIT in F are associated with F-actin filaments adjacent to the SIT (light blue arrowheads). a 3D reconstruction of partial cell volumes revealed both types of SIT previously observed by TEM on ultrathin sections. the inner membrane can enwrap portions of cytoplasm including electron-dense ribosomes. the tip of this SIT was captured within the data set of the tilt series. the 3D-rendering indicates that the tip of the captured SIT is closed. intracellular Salmonella induce various types of host cell membrane tubule tubules. the majority of intracellular WT Salmonella (82.7%, N = 208 bacteria) were contained within membrane compartments. membrane compartments were reminiscent of cytosolic pockets enclosed within the complex 3D structure of the SCV. la cells infected with Salmonella enterica wild type (S) were subjected to HPF-FS at 10 h post infection (p.i.) representative micrographs of SCV and SIT are shown. most frequently, we observed extended tubules with luminal content of low electron density (Figure 1Cvi, vii) these SIT were delimited by two adjacent membranes which we discriminate as outer and inner membrane. both type 1 and type 2 SIT were also found in the same cells. we determined the diameter of type 2 SIT as 22.052.29 nm (N = 15) which is consistent with the diameter of microtubules (22\u201324 nm) microtubules were detected only in a subpopulation of sections through type 2 SIT, suggesting that their presence or absence may be related to a certain developmental stage of the tubules. microscopy cannot reveal if cytoskeletal filaments are on the outside of SIT, or within the lumen. the density of cytoskeletal filaments inside type 2 SIT was variable. the ultrastructure-based localization of cytoskeletal filaments inside type 2 SIT was variable. the lumen of SIT and endosomes was analyzed by live cell imaging. we used lentiviral transfection to generate a HeLa cell line constitutively expressing LAMP1-GFP. this cell line was indistinguishable from the parental cell line with respect to the intracellular phenotypes of Salmonella. we also observed the fluid tracer within the SCV, decorating the bacterial cell body. the intensity of Rhodamine fluorescence increased with the duration of the pulse and consequently with the amount of the marker accumulated in the endosomal system of the cell. type 2 SIT are of late endosomal/lysosomal origin and identical to the previously described SIF. any similar tubular compartments were neither observed in non-infected HeLa cells, nor in cells infected with an ssaV-deficient strain. we analyzed infected cells shortly after onset of SIF formation. previous work showed that SIF are highly dynamic at this early stage. phenotype was reminiscent of previously described leading SIF (LS) and trailing SIF (TS) [9], [10]. early-stage SIF in HeLa cells exhibit leading and trailing phenotypes. the observed type 1 SIT or LS are of late endosomal/lysosomal origin. both morphological structures represent LAMP1-positive SIF. we first investigated non-infected RAW264.7 macrophages activated by IFN. CLEM showed thin LAMP1-GFP-positive single membrane tubules. these tubules were thicker and with stronger LAMP1-GFP signal compared to LAMP1-GFP-positive tubules in non-infected cells. GFP cells revealed single membrane tubules at 8 h p.i., as well as double membrane tubules at 12 h p.i. Pulse-chase experiments with BSA-Rhodamine showed similar results as for HeLa cells. results suggest induction of double-membrane tubules by intracellular Salmonella is common phenomenon. microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a mammalian homolog of yeast ATG8, is a well-established marker of autophagy. microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) associates with membranes of the phagophore, autophagosome and autolysosome [28]. non-transfected HeLa cells infected by Salmonella WT showed 72.33.5% of infected cells with SIF formation. erry-ATG5-K130R-infected cells previously transfected with dominant-negative ATG5 showed only 56.66.1% SIF formation. infected cells were first pulse-chased with either BSA-Rhodamine (without gold NP) or HRP (Figure S10) to allow accumulation of the reagent within endocytic compartments including SCV and SIF. the reaction with DAB was performed post fixation before sample processing for TEM. TEM (E\u2013G, I\u2013K) micrographs show a higher magnification of double membrane SIF. the pseudocolored micrograph indicates the organization of inner and outer SIF membrane and the DAB polymer deposition in intermembrane lumen. CLEM analysis of infected HeLa LAMP1-GFP cells pulse-chased with HRP also revealed DAB product inside the outer lumen of double membrane SIF (type 2 SIT) and within the SCV at 8 h p.i. la cells with 67.65.1% pseudo-SIF formation, fixation by GA resulted in 4.32.1% pseudo-SIF and 95.72.1% continuous SIF, as judged by light microscopy. but SIF in sseF-infected cells at 8 h p.i. were delimited by a single membrane with electron-dense content. CLEM experiments with HRP showed a similar phenotype. cells infected with sseF strain expressing episomal sseF 200\u2013205 contained only thinner single membrane SIF. sifA-deficient strain fails to induce SIF and loses the SCV membrane. transient ectopic expression of SifA in epithelial cells leads to LAMP1-positive aggregations and also thin SIF-like tubular structures. we investigated the ultrastructure of SifA-induced tubules in non-infected HeLa cells. HeLa cells were infected with WT Salmonella, fixed 10 h p.i. and 300 nm sections were used to generate tilt series from 60\u00b0 to +60\u00b0. this approach identified Salmonella inside SCV with connecting SIT. branched SCV-derived tubular membrane structures appeared as intertwined type 1 and type 2 SIT. tomograms also revealed structural continuity between distant portions of SIF which otherwise appeared as separate structures on ultrathin sections. this suggests that both, inner and outer membrane, are in continuum. the space between the inner and outer membrane of these structures is the bona fide luminal space of SCV/SIT containing endocytosed cargo and bacteria. the space between the inner and outer membrane of these structures is the bona fide luminal space of SCV/SIT. the limit of spatial resolution in light microscopy does not allow to obtain sufficient details in the organization of SCV and SIF. the study revealed for the first time two morphologically distinct types of Salmonella-induced tubules (SIT) in salmonella-infected epithelial cells and macrophages. type 1 SIT were identified as the earlier described leading SIF (LS) and type 2 SIT as the appropriate trailing SIF (TS) double membrane compartments are typical for autophagosomes. SIF cross sections and tomograms demonstrate continuity of SIF inner and outer membrane. we postulate that such a process ultimately results in membrane fusion and formation of double membrane SIF. the sseF and sseG mutant strains induce thin SIF consisting of one membrane (K, L) the sseF mutant strains induce thin SIF consisting of one membrane (K, L) and N show scenarios for conversion of single to double membrane SIF (blue boxes) we demonstrated that SIF networks are in continuous interchange with endocytosed material. the multiple interactions may result in a continuous network of SIF lumen with a very large volume connected to SCV. a luminal content comparable to late endosomes, endolysosomes or, in part, lysosomes. intracellular Salmonella would be able to generate extensive lgp-positive membrane compartments without exposure to lysosomal hydrolases. a further explanation could be the dilution of antimicrobial effectors in a large volume of SCV continual with volume of extensive network of SIF. expression of GFP-SifA in uninfected epithelial cells leads to LAMP1-positive aggregations and also thin SIF-like tubular structures. action of SifA is insufficient to induce double membrane SIF. mutant strains lacking SseF and SseG are attenuated in intracellular replication. eF- or sseG-deficient Salmonella may also be explained by a missing direct interaction of these effectors after membrane insertion. this model would imply that Salmonella transfers an autonomous membrane fusion machinery into the host cell in order to induce extensive membrane aggregations resulting in double membrane compartments. alternative models for biogenesis of SIF are shown in Figure 11N, P, Q. d in Figure 11O and P occur simultaneously, since both originate from lateral tubulation. we consider three consecutive scenarios: i) by means of the SPI2-T3SS effector SifA intracellular Salmonella induce the formation of single membrane tubules extending from the SCV. the formation of double membrane SIF through the entrapment of cytosol and especially the entrapment of cytoskeletal filaments into double membrane SIF will result in a stabilized tubular network. the previously observed phenotype of microtubule bundling in Salmonella-infected cells may be explained by accumulation of microtubules inside double membrane SIF [14]. the strains harbored pFPV25.1 [51], pFPV-mCherry/2 [10] or pETco1-PrpsM-mCherry2 [52] for constitutive expression of GFP or mCherry. the strains harbored pFPV25.1 [51], pFPV-mCherry/2 [10] or pETcoco1-PrpsM-mCherry2 [52 cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 gl1 glucose, 4 mM stable glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Biochrom) and supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C. 0.5\u20132 g of plasmid DNA were solved in 25\u2013100 l DMEM without iFCS and mixed with 1\u20134 l FUGENE reagent. before infection the cells were provided with fresh medium without transfection mix. cells were pulse-chased with Dextran-Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) and Dextran-Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen) the same threshold was applied to each dataset for LAMP1-GFP and Gold-BSA-Rhodamine to calculate co-localization rates and Pearson's correlation coefficient. DMEM was replaced by imaging-medium consisting of Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) with Earle's salts, without NaHCO3, without L-glutamine and without phenol red (Biochrom) supplemented with 30 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) live cells were imaged at various time points post infection to track the co-localization of GFP-LC3b with Salmonella or Salmonella-induced tubular structures. transfected cells were washed thrice with PBS and incubated in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the gridded coverslip was removed from the Petri dish. cells were infiltrated and flat-embedded in mixes of acetone and EPON812 (Serva) the engraved coordinates were transferred to the EPON surface and allowed trimming around the ROI.
