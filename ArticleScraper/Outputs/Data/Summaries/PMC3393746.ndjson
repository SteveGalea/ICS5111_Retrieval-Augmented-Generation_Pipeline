Virus isolation was negative for all tissues assayed including brain tissue where high levels of viral genome, antigen, and lesions were detected with and without neutralizing antibody. all animals that developed clinical disease were positive for a binding antibody response to HeV sG by Luminex assay. four asymptomatic mice (one aged and three juvenile) had encephalitis and viral antigen in the brain, with a further two asymptomatic, mice having encephalitis only. a further two asymptomatic mice had encephalitis and viral antigen in the brain, with a further two asymptomatic, mice having encephalitis only. aged mice are more susceptible to clinical disease than juvenile animals. 80% of aged animals developed clinical disease (s.e. = 12.7%) and only 10% of juvenile animals (s.e. = 9.5%) suggesting a real difference (70%, s.e. = 15.8%) in susceptibility to the development of disease between the aged and juvenile animals. t/IHC vRNA VI Hist/IHC 101 2 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 live virus was reisolated from the lungs of mice sampled between 4 and 10 DPI. the viral titres detected were comparatively low with a maximum titre (102.3 TCID50) recovered from a mouse on day 6. in brain, immunopositive cells were first detected 6 DPI (Table 4), and from 8 DPI lesions characterised by neuronal degeneration, microglial activation, glial reaction, perivascular cuffing and non-suppurative meningitis were also identified. all other tissues excluding brain were assessed for viral genome by qPCR. blood samples were also collected at euthanasia from each animal in the time-course study. RNA extracted using a Ribopure blood extraction kit. previous work showed this extraction method to be the most sensitive for qPCR detection of HeV RNA in experimentally infected horses. olfactory bulb was first detected in clinically healthy mice euthanased on day 6. it involved periglomerular cells, mitral cells, granule cells and associated cell processes. empty cells indicate neither lesions nor antigen detected. clinically healthy mice euthanased between days 12 and 20 post infection were uniformly positive for antigen and also inflammatory lesions in the piriform lobe, olfactory tubercle and amygdala. the latter feature was especially seen in those mice euthanased in the latter part of the time-course study (day 17 onwards) co-localisation studies were performed using confocal imaging. perfused brains were collected from three aged BALB/c mice. antigen appeared to be present in cells with neuronal morphology only. HeV antigen (red) was detected in cells of distinctly neuronal morphology at day 11 post infection (PI) in the piriform lobe. it was not seen in cells identified as oligodendrocytes through positive staining for GFAP (green) in olfactory bulb at day 9 PI. mice exposed to HeV by parenteral route did not develop clinical or pathological signs of infection. mouse model of HeV infection is most likely established via non-haematogenous route of neuroinvasion. olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) project cilia out into the lumen of the nasal cavity to detect odorants. minal nerve may provide another possible route of neuroinvasion from the nasal cavity to the glomeruli of the olfactory bulbs. peptidergic fibres of the trigeminal nerve innervate the olfactory epithelium and some of these fibres will send collaterals to the olfactory bulb. the contribution of these fibres to viral invasion of the olfactory bulbs requires closer investigation. transneuronal spread via synapses without budding of infectious virions may explain how HeV could not be reisolated from infected mouse brains. encephalitis represents a significant complication of HeV infection in humans. of the seven people known to have contracted Hendra infection three have died from encephalitis. the most likely route of human infection is contact droplet infection of the nasopharynx. the pattern of spread of HeV through the brain of mice is best explained by an ability of the virus to employ direct trans-neuronal transmission without concomitant generation of an infectious virion. mice are susceptible to HeV infection after intranasal exposure with aged animals reliably developing encephalitic disease. encephalitis is a feature of both recrudescent human HeV [1] and NiV [41], [42] infection. the mouse HeV model could be employed to explore mechanisms of viral suppression. animals are resistant to systemic vasculitis and fulminating HeV disease. they are resistant to systemic vasculitis and fulminating HeV disease. these findings have opened up new areas of investigation. mice were anaesthetised, placed in dorsal recumbency and exposed to 50,000 TCID50 in 50 l saline by subcutaneous injection. animals were monitored daily thereafter and euthanased when reaching a previously determined end-point or at 21 days post infection (pi) the humane endpoint was defined as a constant weight loss recorded over 3 days or reaching a 20% loss of pre-infection weight. mice were exposed to 50,000 TCID50 of HeV using the intranasal route described above. deeply anesthetised mice were perfused with paraformaldehyde. blood was collected via cardiac puncture, placed into EDTA and serum separator tubes. animals were deeply anesthetised and euthanased by perfusion with paraformaldehyde. mice were placed under 4% paraformaldehyde soaked tissues for 1 hour. after initial fixation, the brain was removed and immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (volume/volume) for a further 24 hours. qPCR was performed using the AgPath-ID one-step reverse transcription-PCR kit. positive results were defined by a cycle threshold (CT) value of 39.6 based on a standard curve where this CT represented one copy of target RNA. all samples were normalised against the housekeeping gene 18S. sera were serially-doubly diluted in a 96 well plate. 200 TCID50 HeV was added and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. assay read after 3 days incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. human neurofilament protein (DakoCytomation) 150, anti-NeuN, (Millipore) 150, and a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against whole HeV (AAHL) sections were washed 3 times for 5 minutes with PBS and nuclei labelled with DAPI diluted 11000 in dH2O for 30 minutes. mice were anaesthetised, placed in dorsal recumbency and exposed to 50,000 TCID50 virus in 200 l saline by subcutaneous injection. animals were monitored daily thereafter and euthanased when reaching a previously determined end-point or at 21 days post infection (pi) the humane endpoint was defined as a constant weight loss recorded over 3 days or reaching a 20% loss of pre-infection weight. mice exposed to 50,000 TCID50 of HeV using intranasal route described above. deeply anesthetised mice perfused with paraformaldehyde. blood was collected via cardiac puncture, placed into EDTA and serum separator tubes. blood was collected via cardiac puncture and 500 l whole blood was placed into 1.3 ml RNAlater for Ribopure RNA extraction. animals were deeply anesthetised and euthanased by perfusion with paraformaldehyde to achieve optimal fixation of tissues. mice were placed under 4% paraformaldehyde soaked tissues and allowed to fix for 1 hour. RNA was extracted from whole blood mixed in RNAlater using the Mouse RiboPure-Blood RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion), targeting the N gene of HeV as previously described. positive results were defined by a cycle threshold (CT) value of 39.6 based on a standard curve where this CT represented one copy of target RNA. a strong positive control was assayed for each mouse strain. a positive result was defined as samples with a median fluorescence intensity (MFI) greater than the mean of all pre-challenge samples plus 3 x the standard deviation, MFI >406. sera were serially-doubly diluted in a 96 well plate (final volume 50ul/well) to which 200 TCID50 HeV was added and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. mouse Ig Blocking Reagent (Vector Laboratories) was used with mouse primary antibodies. anti-Human Neurofilament protein (DakoCytomation) 150, anti-NeuN, (Millipore) 150, and a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against whole HeV."}
