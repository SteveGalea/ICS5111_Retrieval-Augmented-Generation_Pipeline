{"summary": "most human cases of H5N1 infection present as progressive pneumonia. the ultimate cause of death is the most severe form of acute lung injury (6, 7) many viruses, including H5N1, are mutating and producing strains resistant to currently known vaccines or antiviral drugs. in this study, we investigated the roles of T cells in the defense against HPAI H5N1 viral infection. we found that T cells provided crucial protective function during HPAI H5N1 viral infection. T cells were expanded from human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) as described previously (20) PBMCs separated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco BRL, USA) all mice were bred from B6.129P2-Tcrbtm1Mom/Tcrdtm1Mom mice provided by professor Mingzhao Zhu. Lung injury was induced via the intratracheal instillation of AF vehicle or virus as previously reported (21). a new construct containing the bacteriophage T4 fibritin fold on trimerization sequence was generated to allow the efficient secretion of trimeric rHA proteins. transfection and virus amplification were carried out according to baculovirus expression system manual. Flow Cytometric Analysis Freshly isolated T cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. cells were then incubated with PE-conjugated anti-CD69 or isotype control antibodies for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. T cells were incubated with fluorescein-labeled Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA, Vector, USA; 10 g/ml; specific for SA2,3Gal) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in the dark. survival data were subject to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Gibco Invitrogen, USA) medium. dilutions of the virus were used to inoculate MDCK cells in a 96-well plate. infected cells were maintained in culture for 72 h. the survival percentages and body weights in each group of 10 mice were monitored daily for 14 days. survival data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using GraphPad Prism 5 software. gel filtration chromatography was conducted using P4000 and P2500 columns (Malvern, UK) with a running buffer (pH 8.0) composed of 135 mm NaCl, 135 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4 and 1.0 mm Na2HPO412H2O. after isolation and washing, 50 l of a 0.75% human red blood cell suspension was added to 50 l volumes of serial dilutions of pur T cells were washed, resuspended in HBSS and seeded on lab-TekTM glass chamber slides for 1 h at room temperature. when indicated, HA-his (3 g/ml), HAF (3 g/ml) and an anti-CD3 mAb (5 g/ml) were added. survival data were subjected to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. all statistical tests were performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) P 0.05 indicates statistical significance. the interplay between HPAI H5N1 virus and human T cells has not been reported. the interplay between human T cells and human T cells has not been reported. H5N1 virus induces agglutination and activation of T cells. T cells were infected with HPAI H5N1 viruses or H1N1 viruses at an MOI of 4 for 12 h. gel filtration chromatography was further conducted to analyze oligomerization of rHA proteins. the majority of the HAF protein appeared as an HA trimer, while the HA-his protein appeared as an HA monomer. a few oligomeric proteins were present in both groups. rH5HA proteins induce the agglutination and activation of T cells. rH5HA trimers but not the monomers could directly induce the agglutination and activation of T cells. sialic acid receptors mediate HA binding and T cell activation. the expression level of -2,3 and -2,6 sialic acid receptors was higher than that of -2,3 sialic acid receptors. both HAF and HA-his proteins bound directly to the surface of T cells. orescence detection of binding activities of rHA proteins to T cells before and after neuraminidase digestion. ELISA detection of IFN- secretion by T cells following endo H treatment of rHA. T cell activation could be blocked by the phosphatase calcineurin inhibitor CsA. effects of pharmacological inhibitors on HA-induced T cell activation. WT and TCR-/ mice were intranasally inoculated with 0.8 105 TCID50 H5N1 virus. values are the means SEMs from 10 mice. the viral M1 protein could not be detected after HPAI H5N1 infection. T cells were infected with HPAI H5N1 viruses or H1N1 viruses at an MOI of 4 for 12 h. 5HA proteins were confirmed by Coomassie blue staining (Figure 3B) and Western blotting with anti-His antibodies. gel filtration chromatography was further conducted to analyze the oligomerization of rHA proteins. the majority of the HAF protein appeared as an HA trimer, while the HA-his protein appeared as an HA monomer. rH5HA proteins induce the agglutination and activation of T cells. rH5HA trimers but not the monomers could directly induce the agglutination and activation of T cells. Graphs represent the kinetics of the intracellular Ca2+ levels in T cells following stimulation by HAF or HA-his proteins. data are presented as means SEMs. sialic acid receptors mediate HA binding and T cell activation. ELISA detection of IFN- secretion by T cells following neuraminidase digestion. HA-induced T cell activation could be blocked by the phosphatase calcineurin inhibitor CsA. T cells play an important role in the defense against HPAI H5N1 infection. the number of T cells resident in the lung was increased after influenza A virus (H3N2) infection (10). the resistance of mice to influenza A virus (H3N2) infection was abrogated (11) the HPAI H5N1 virus could directly induce severe T cell agglutination and activation in vitro. the ability of the HPAI H5N1 virus to activate T cells was higher than that of H1N1; this result is consistent with in vivo virulence of these strains. the rapid activation response and ability to resist HPAI H5N1 infection increase the advantage of T cells in controlling viral infection compared with that of other immune cells. in its mature form, natural HA is a homotrimer with multiple glycosylation sites. both -2,3 and -2,6 sialic acid receptors could be detected on T cells. expression level of -2,3 sialic acid receptors is lower than that of -2,3 sialic acid receptors. this is consistent with previous report that -2,6 sialic acid is dominant on epithelial cells in the human nasal mucosa. TCR and NKG2D play critical roles in antigen recognition and T cell activation. rHA trimer-induced activation was inhibited by CsA but not by wortmannin or LY294002. HA trimer-induced activation was inhibited by CsA. this ability was dependent on sialic acid receptors on the surface of T cells and on the HA glycosylation. HA-induced T cell activation can be inhibited by CsA but not by wortmannin or LY294002. a novel strategy for controlling influenza virus infection in the future."}
