{"summary": "theiler s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-infection is a widely used animal model for studying demyelinating disorders, including human multiple sclerosis (MS) resistant mouse strains develop viral persistence with delayed-type hypersensitivity and myelin-specific autoimmunity with spinal cord myelin loss, resembling chronic progressive MS lesions. mutations affecting IL-10R contribute to the development of very early-onset-IBD in children. IL-10 also influences the disease outcome in several persistent viral infections [29\u201333]. IL-10 also influences the disease outcome in several persistent viral infections. the aim of the present study was to gain insights into IL-10-mediated immune regulation in SJL mice prone to developing a variety of immune-mediated disorders. IL10R deficiency was induced by administration of cytokine receptor blocking antibodies during the acute and chronic demyelinating TME phase. results illustrate the ability of systemic IL-10R deficiency to cause an immune enhancement and progressive colitis in an infectious MS model. experiment II included three animal groups (groups \u201cIL-10Rlate/TMEV\u201d and \u201cisotypelate/TMEV\u201d) but IL10R Ab and isotype controls were administered at later time points to investigate IL-10R blockade during chronic TMEV-infection. a second group received IgG1-specific isotype control instead of IL-10R Ab. a third group was mock-infected only (#) (C) for negative controls. animals received IL-10R Ab once weekly at day 0, 7 and 14. animals of experiment I and II were inoculated with the beAn-strain of TMEV. intracerebral inoculation was carried out under general anesthesia. each animal was scored once weekly for the following clinical parameters. animals reaching the maximum of points in one or multiple parameters were excluded from the experiment. animals were euthanized with medetomidine (1.0 mg/kg) and ketamine (200 mg/kg) i.p. immunohistochemistry (intestine) and flow cytometry (spleen) were taken at day 7, 14 and 21. inflammatory responses in the small intestine, cecum and colon were scored by using a four-part, semiquantitative scoring system. leukomyelitis was graded in cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord cross sections using a two-part, semiquantitative scoring system. a final score was determined by averaging the scores of the three segments from each animal and adding the scores of PVI and hypercellularity. specific monoclonal Ab (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) for detecting B cells, a polyclonal rabbit anti-TMEV-specific Ab for detecting TMEV-Ag and a rat anti-forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)-specific monoclonal Ab (eBioscience, Frankfurt, Germany) for detecting Treg. damaged axons were labeled with a goat anti-non-phosphorylated neurofila Cytomation polyclonal Ab rabbit Citrate buffer / microwave 1:1000 T cells CD45R/B220 553085 clone RA3-6B2 BD Biosciences monoclonal Ab rat Citrate buffer / microwave 1:1000 B cells Foxp3 14-5773 clone FJK-16s eBioscience monoclonal Ab rabbit Citrate buffer / microwave 1:50 Treg CD107b MCA2293B clone M3/84 the white matter area was measured by manual mapping at 100x magnification. the total numbers in the white matter of all three spinal cord segments were enumerated.

TMEV-infected mice showed reduced activity, hunched backs and scurfy hair. at 42 dpi, increased clinical scores were observed in IL-10R-blocked infected mice. theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-infection causes worsening of systemic clinical signs (increased clinical scores) at 22 dpi in SJL mice with early anti-IL-10 receptor antibody (IL-10R Ab) treatment compared to non-infected mice following anti-IL-10R Ab treatment (red asterisks) and TMEV-infected mice without anti-IL-10R Ab treatment (black asterisks) no differences were detected between group \u201cIL-10Rlate/TMEV\u201d and group \u201cisotypelate/TMEV\u201d mice. IL-10R neutralization causes systemic clinical signs in infected mice. previous studies in SJL mice have demonstrated the occurrence of progressive leukomyelitis with TMEV-induced demyelination starting at 28 dpi. histological scoring revealed significant inflammatory responses at 14, 22, and 42 dpi in mice with and without Ab treatment. black box = mock-infected mice with IL-10R treatment (group \"IL10Rearly/mock\") no differences were found between group \"IL-10Rearly/TMEV\" and \"isotypeearly/TMEV\" RT-qPCR was performed during the initial phase of virus-induced leukomyelitis at 14 and 22 dpi. lack of group differences was confirmed, showing similar messenger RNA expression levels of Foxp3. results show early systemic IL-10R blockade is unable to significantly influence CNS inflammation in TME. the amount of TMEV-Ag and -RNA in the spinal cord was measured by IHC and RT-qPCR. animals were investigated by histology and IHC in the chronic demyelinating phase at 42 and 49 dpi. mRNA expression of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF, TGF-, IFN- and Foxp3 remained unchanged. results indicate a rather mild but not absent effect of IL-10R neutralization upon spinal cord inflammation and pathology. IL-10R neutralization during the late TME phase did not influence virus concentration in the spinal cord at 42 and 49 dpi. IL-10R neutralization during the late TME phase did not influence virus concentration in the spinal cord at 42 and 49 dpi. TMEV-infected mice with and without early Ab treatment were mock- or TMEV-infected. IL-10R blockade led to colitis at 14 and 22 dpi in infected and non-infected mice. significantly increased severity of colitis at 14 days post infection (dpi) in TMEV-infected mice with IL10R antibody (Ab) treatment (group \u201cIL10Rearly/TMEV\u201d) compared to Ab treated animals without infection (group \u201cIL10Rearly/TMEV\u201d). TMEV-specific IHC and ISH were performed at 7, 14, 22, and 42 dpi. IL-10R blockade at later time points did not induce group differences at day 14 after Ab treatment onset (49 dpi, Table F in S1 File). animals receiving isotype control Ab showed no signs of colitis (Table G in S1 File). of CD69 on CD4+ T cells at 22 dpi in group \"IL-10Rearly/TMEV\" compared to isotype treated mice with virus infection at 22 and 42 dpi. phenotypical changes were associated with increased transcription of IL-1 (14 and 22 dpi), IL-5 (14 dpi), IL-6 (14 dpi) and TGF- (14 and 22 dpi) expression of activation markers CD69 and CD44 on both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ CTL were significantly enhanced in TMEV-infected animals (group \u201cIL-10Rearly/mock\u201d) compared to non-infected animals following cytokine receptor blockade (group \u201cIL-10Rearly/mock\u201d). gMFI of CD69 (M) and CD44 (N) gated on CD4+ cells increased at 14 dpi. gMFI of CD69 (O) and CD44 (P) gated on CD8+ cells increased at 14 dpi.

RT-qPCR was performed at 49 dpi in mice with Ab treatment. a reduced percentage of CD4+ T cells together with an increased IFN- mRNA expression was observed in TMEV-infected mice following IL-10R blockade. Flow cytometry revealed a relative increase of CD8+ cells in the spleens of TMEV-infected mice with IL-10R Ab treatment at 49 dpi. splenic cytokine expression in chronically infected mice was determined 14 days after the onset of Ab treatment (49 dpi) treatment successfully induced severe lymphohistiocytic to neutrophilic colitis. IL-10R blockade causes an early significant increase of CD3+ T cells, Foxp3+ Treg and Iba-1+ macrophages. Fig 10.

RT-qPCR was performed during the initial phase of virus-induced leukomyelitis at 14 and 22 dpi. results show early systemic IL-10R blockade is unable to significantly influence CNS inflammation in TME. yelination and axonal damage determined by MBP- and np-NF-specific IHC, IHC for CD3 revealed significantly increased numbers of T cells within the spinal cord at 49 dpi. mRNA expression of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF, TGF-, IFN- and Foxp3 remained unchanged. a significant increase of CD3+ T cells in TMEV-infected mice with IL-10R blockade compared to isotype-treated animals at 49 dpi. IL-6 mRNA expression significantly decreased in TMEV-infected animals following IL-10R blockade. theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus-infection Clinical examination revealed that acute TMEV-infection causes a temporary exacerbation of systemic clinical signs in IL-10R neutralized mice. theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-infection exacerbates enteric disease. TMEV-infection exacerbates enteric disease following interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) blockade. results revealed no viral Ag or RNA in the small intestine, colon, or caecum. in experiment II histology of the colon was performed at 42 and 49 dpi in TMEV-infected mice with or without Ab treatment. flow cytometry and RT-qPCR were performed at 7, 14, 22, and 42 dpi in mice with and without IL-10R blockade during acute TME. results revealed an increased CD44 expression on CD4+ T cells at 14 dpi and an increased frequency of CD19+ B cells. significantly elevated spleen weights were found in IL-10R blocked mice with virus infection compared to isotype treated mice with virus infection at 22 and 42 dpi. results revealed an increased percentage of CD19+ B cells (Fig 8) and decreased percentage of CD4+ T cells (Fig 8) within spleens. relative numbers of Foxp3+ Treg were elevated (Fig 8) in animals receiving IL-10R Ab and TMEV (group \u201cIL-10Rearly/TMEV\u201d) compared to control animals (group \u201cIL-10Rearly/mock\u201d). IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, TNF, IFN-, TGF- and IL-10 in spleens of infected mice compared to non-infected animals following IL-10R antibody (Ab) treatment. relative numbers of CD19+ B cells and a simultaneous decrease of CD4+ T cells (K) in the spleen were increased following TMEV-infection and IL-10R blockade. the highest cytokine transcription levels were measured in group \"IL-10Rearly/TMEV\" animals primarily at 14 dpi, associated with exacerbated colitis. significantly higher levels of IL-2 (p = 0.066) and TNF (p = 0.066) were observed at 14 dpi compared to 22 dpi. effects of chronic Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-infection on cytokine expression and phenotypical changes in spleens of infected mice. mRNA levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF, IFN-, TGF- and IL-10 in spleens of infected mice compared to non-infected animals following IL-10R antibody (Ab results confirm ability of acute CNS infection to cause prominent cytokine enhancement in IL-10R neutralized SJL mice. interleukin-10 receptor blockade causes clinical deterioration without influencing motor coordination in acutely infected mice. er\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-infected mice were compared to mock-infected mice at 42 dpi. no differences were observed between IL-10R Ab and isotype-treated animals. IL-10R Ab treatment caused increased clinical scores at 22 dpi. affected animals displayed reduced activity, hunched backs and scurfy hair. unformed feces ascribed to enteric disease were observed in ab-treated mice. treatment compared to non-infected mice following anti-IL-10R Ab treatment (red asterisks) and TMEV-infected mice without anti-IL-10R Ab treatment (black asterisks) results suggest a triggering effect of virus infection upon IL-10R deficiency-mediated systemic signs. clinical soring revealed significantly increased scores in infected mice at 42 and 49 dpi after late Ab application. results show that IL-10R neutralization causes systemic clinical signs in SJL mice which are temporarily (22 dpi) enhanced by acute TMEV-infection (experiment I) histological scoring of the spinal cord revealed significant inflammatory responses at 14, 22, and 42 dpi in mice with and without Ab treatment. no differences were observed between these two groups at any time point. no differences were found between group \"IL-10Rearly/TMEV\" and \"isotypeearly/TMEV\" animals. the same degree of spinal cord demyelination, determined by densiometric analyses, was found in both TMEV-infected groups. RT-qPCR was performed during the initial phase of virus-induced leukomyelitis at 14 and 22 dpi. results show early systemic IL-10R blockade is unable to significantly influence CNS inflammation. no differences were observed between group \"IL-10Rearly/TMEV\" and group \"isotypeearly/TMEV\" animals were investigated by histology and IHC in the chronic demyelinating phase at 42 and 49 dpi. mRNA expression of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF, TGF-, IFN- and Foxp3 remained unchanged. results indicate mild but not absent effect of IL-10R neutralization on spinal cord inflammation and pathology. TMEV-infection and concurrent intraperitoneal application of IL-10R antibody lead to an increase of CD3+ T cells in the spinal cord at 49 days post infection (dpi) compared to isotype-treated animals at 49 dpi. systemic anti-IL-10R blockade is unable to alter antiviral immunity during acute and chronic TME. increased CD3+ T cell influx together with reduced IL-6 transcription in the spinal cord during chronic TME clearly demonstrates a limited but general ability of systemic IL-10R neutralization to alter the inflammatory environment within the CNS (experiment II). IL-10R blockade led to colitis at 14 and 22 dpi in infected and non-infected mice. simultaneous infection of mice treated with Ab resulted in transient worsening of colonic disease compared to mock-infected mice. TMEV-specific IHC and ISH were performed at 7, 14, 22, and 42 dpi. results revealed no viral Ag or RNA in the small intestine, colon, or caecum at any investigated time point. no TMEV-Ag or -RNA was detected in the intestinal tract by IHC and ISH at 42 and 49 dpi in TMEV-infected mice. acute TMEV-induced neuroinflammation has the ability to deteriorate immune-mediated colitis in IL-10R neutralized SJL mice. phenotypical changes were associated with increased transcription of IL-1 (14 and 22 dpi), IL-5 (14 dpi), IL-6 (14 dpi) and TGF- (14 and 22 dpi), indicative of peripheral immune enhancement following IL-10R neutralization. results revealed an increased percentage of CD19+ B cells and decreased percentage of CD4+ T cells within spleens following ab treatment. CD69 and CD44 expression on both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ CTL were significantly enhanced in TMEV-infected animals (group \u201cIL-10Rearly/TMEV\u201d) compared to non-infected animals following cytokine receptor blockade. gMFI of CD69 (O) and CD44 (P) gated on CD8+ cells were increased at 14 dpi in infected mice following IL-10R ab treatment. IL-10R Ab treated mice without TMEV-infection (group \u201cIL10Rearly/mock\u201d). the highest cytokine transcription levels were measured in group \u201cIL-10Rearly/TMEV\u201d animals primarily at 14 dpi associated with exacerbated colitis.

IHC revealed that IL-10R blockade causes an early significant increase of CD3+ T cells, Foxp3+ Treg and Iba-1+ macrophages in the lamina propria of the colon at 7, 14, and 21 day. a delayed significant infiltration of the colonic mucosa was found at day 21 after the first Ab treatment. grey box with vertical lines = control animals (group \u201cisotype\u201d), white box with vertical lines = IL-10R blocked animals (group \u201cIL-10R\u201d). results confirm the ability of IL-10R neutralization to breakdown gut immune homeostasis and induce immune-mediated colitis in SJL mice. phenotypical changes in the spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry at day 7, 14 and 21 of ab treatment. gMFI of CD69 was significantly higher in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets in IL-10R-blocked animals. increased gMFI of CD44 gated on CD8+ cells was detected at day 21. grey box with vertical lines = control animals (group \u201cisotype\u201d) and white box with vertical lines = IL-10R blocked animals (group \u201cIL-10R\u201d) were detected at day 21. autoantibodies against IL-10 and IL-10R can be found in a subset of human IBD patients. disturbed mucosal homeostasis in IL-10-deficient mice is accompanied by a loss of intestinal regulatory myeloid cells (CX3CR1highCD11b+CD11c+) and Treg (CD4+Foxp3+) leading to aberrant Th1/Th17-mediated responses towards commensal gut microbiota mice infected with the pathobiont Helicobacter hepaticus responded to ab-mediated IL-10R neutralization by colitis development. the predominately detrimental response of SJL mice to IL-10 signaling defects is also exemplified by therapeutic effects of ab-mediated IL-10 or IL-10R blockade observed in WNV-infected C57BL/6 mice. extraintestinal infection can enhance enteric disease. similar effects have been described in experimental respiratory influenza virus infection. exacerbated colitis following TMEV-infection might be caused by unspecific stimulation of colitogenic T cells. concurrent IBD has been observed in a subset of MS patients. the cause of this co-morbidity is still unclear. genetic factors that predispose individuals to develop immune mediated disorders are assumed. exogenous IL-6 inhibits TMEV replication in cultured macrophages. exogenous IL-6 inhibits TMEV replication in cultured macrophages. no treatment effects on viral load or neuropathology were found in the present study. IL-6 reduction is apparently insufficient to alter local CNS inflammatory responses. in TMEV-infected mice local Ag presentation and plasma cell differentiation in the spinal cord together with an intact blood spinal cord barrier are supposed to cause a CNS-restricted inflammation. IL-10 signaling in TME causes severe systemic immunopathology in mouse strains with a susceptible genetic background. identifing critical factors that regulate IL-10 in different organ compartments is crucial for understanding how IL-10 restores protective immunity. cells were first gated for granularity, size and singlets followed by Live/Dead staining for exclusion of death cells. cells were first gated for granularity, size and singlets followed by Live/Dead staining. living cells were tested for surface expression of CD3 and CD19.
