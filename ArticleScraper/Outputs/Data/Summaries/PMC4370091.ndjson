{"summary": "public health is a main field to understand this rebuilding. aim was to map the scientific research on public health in Rwanda after the genocide and to present the links between different financing systems. in the advanced search, we obtained the articles by this formula: TS=(public health AND Rwanda) the aim was to see any differences before and after genocide (occurred in 1994). the funding agencies were numerous and very few from Africa (table 2). we noted 4/70 (5,7%) fundings from Rwanda. a small part were form Rwandan institutions.
