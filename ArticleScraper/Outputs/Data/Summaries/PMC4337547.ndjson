{"summary": "spherical, enveloped RNA viruses cause enteric, respiratory, and generalized diseases in humans and animals. coVs contain three major structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) the nucleocapsid protein is the most abundant viral protein and is associated with the positive-stranded RNA genome (1). both viruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, Coronavirinae subfamily, and Alphacoronavirus genus (4). TGEV belongs to Alphacoronavirus 1 species within the Alphacoronavirus genus. it also includes porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and canine coronavirus (CCV) (13) ated Purdue strain at passage level 115 (P115) was characterized by monoclonal antibodies (20\u201322) a TGEV variant with a large deletion (aa) in the N terminus of the S protein emerged naturally in swine as a nonenteropathogenic but respiratory variant. the large deletion within the S protein of PRCV is also responsible for the loss of hemagglutination (HA) activity (23) and two antigenic sites (24) compared to strains were reported in the united states. one strain had a 197-aa deletion (S 197del) in the N-terminal S protein. one strain had a 197-aa deletion (S 197del) in the N-terminal S protein. titers of homologous and heterologous antibodies by CCIF and VN assays. results enhance understanding of the antigenic diversity among PEDV strains. titers of homologous and heterologous antibodies by CCIF and VN assays. two reference strains of TGEV, virulent Miller M6 and attenuated Purdue P115, originated from our laboratory (20, 22) two reference strains of TGEV, virulent Miller M6 and attenuated Purdue P115, were collected from gnotobiotic pigs (PE312 and PE342) (7) or conventional pigs (PV109 and PV151) were inoculated. confluent monolayers of vero cells in 96-well plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline without Mg2+ or Ca2+. each row of a 96-well plate was inoculated with either the Miller or Purdue strain of TGEV at an MOI of 0.01 in EMEM. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-swine IgG (KPL, West Chester, PA) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Serotec, Oxford, United Kingdom) at a 1:100 or 1:500 dilution in PBS was added to each well. after 1 h of incubation, plates were rinsed twice with PBS for 5 min each time. the serum-virus mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. then inoculated onto confluent Vero cell monolayers, 50 l/well. cells were washed twice with PBS and 100 l of DMEM supplemented with 10 g/ml of trypsin was added. the PCR product was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET23b (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) at corresponding restriction enzyme sites. the recombinant plasmid for full-length TGEV Miller N protein expression was generated in our previous study (15) recombinant PEDV and TGEV proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min in 1 loading buffer (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) in presence of 200 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) protein concentration was measured by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) the purified recombinant proteins (2 g/lane) were then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes mouse anti-PEDV N or anti-TGEV N MAbs were serially diluted using 2% NFDM in PBS. the plates were then washed 8 times with 0.05% PBST, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. inoculum was discarded and cells were washed twice with PBS. treatment of PEDV with 10 g/ml of trypsin in DMEM over 12 h reduced HA titer. lysates were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. incubation was performed in U-bottom microtiter plates for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. lysates were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. 197-aa deletion in the S protein acquired upon cell culture passage (11) PC22A, S indel strain Iowa106, and S 197del strain PC177 at passage levels 9, 3, and 2, respectively, were used in this study. MAbs 3F12 and 6C8-1 against the S protein of PEDV strain DR13 were provided by daesub Song (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon, South Korea). each row of a 96-well plate was inoculated with either the Miller or Purdue strain of TGEV. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-swine IgG (KPL, West Chester, PA) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Serotec, Oxford, United Kingdom) at a 1:100 or 1:500 dilution in PBS was added to each well. serum-virus mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then inoculated onto confluent Vero cell monolayers, 50 l/well with duplicates. after centrifugation at 1,000 g for 30 min, microtiter plates were further incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. PEDV gene was amplified from the strain PC22A by RT-PCR. recombinant plasmid was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET23b. expression of target proteins was then induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) recombinant PEDV and TGEV proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min in 1 loading buffer (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) in presence of 200 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) protein concentration was measured by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) the purified recombinant proteins (2 g/lane) were then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes mouse anti-PEDV N or anti-TGEV N MAbs were serially diluted using 2% NFDM in PBS. the plates were then washed with 0.05% PBST and then blocked with 5% NFDM in PBS. tination (HA) assay was conducted as described previously. monolayers of vero cells in T175 flasks were washed twice with PBS. after 2 h of incubation, the inoculum was discarded and cells were washed twice with PBS. giving 32 HA units (HAUs) and mock-inoculated Vero cell lysates were used as positive and negative controls. incubation was then performed in U-bottom microtiter plates for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the ratio between the HAU and RNA copy number of the PEDV genome was calculated. PEDV CV777 antigen was observed in various sizes of fused cells. positive signals of PEDV PC22A antigens were detected as scattered pinpoints or diffuse fluorescence within the cytoplasm of syncytia. the size of PEDV CV777-induced fused cells was larger (B) no difference in fluorescence staining pattern was observed between TGEV Miller and Purdue P115-inoculated ST cells. antigenic cross-reactions as determined by CCIF among various strains of PEDV and TGEV using pig polyclonal antisera. no difference was observed in fluorescent staining patterns of PEDV antigen. other 2 pig TGEV Purdue hyperimmune and one convalescent-phase antiserum showed the same or slightly higher (4-fold) titers of CCIF antibody against homologous TGEV but did not cross-react with any PEDV strains. TGEV antigen stained by MAbs were the same as those stained by polyclonal pig antisera. titer of homologous antibody was 163,840, while titers of heterologous antibody were 10,240 (U.S. PEDV strains) and 160 (PEDV CV777) none of the PEDV N and S protein MAbs tested cross-react with any PEDV isolates. in CCIF assay against homologous (PC22A) than heterologous (S indel Iowa106, S 197del PC177 and CV777) PEDV DR13 S protein MAb (3F12) reacted with PEDV CV777 at a 4-fold-higher titer than with U.S. PEDV strains. two PEDV PC22A-like antisera (PE125 and PE276) had 4- to 16-fold-higher titers of VN antibody against homologous PC22A than against heterologous PEDV CV777. one PEDV CV777 antisera (PC13) had 4-fold-higher titers of VN antibody against PEDV CV777 than against U.S. PEDV strains. only anti-TGEV N MAb 14G9.3C cross-reacted with the recombinant N of PEDV PC22A (A and C) in one way. TGEV MAb (14G9.3C) reacted with both TGEV and PEDV recombinant N proteins. the conserved regions of different viruses are in the boxes. the GenBank accession numbers of the viruses are listed in the text. without trypsin treatment, no PEDV strains tested in the present study showed HA. morphology of PEDV- and TGEV-associated CPE and antigen distribution patterns in vitro. no difference in morphology was observed among PEDV PC22A, S indel strain Iowa106, and S 197del strain PC177. pig convalescent-phase PEDV PC22A-like antiserum (PE125) against PEDV PC22A-inoculated (A) and PEDV CV777-inoculated (B) Vero cell monolayers and hyperimmune anti-TGEV Miller antiserum (S409) against PEDV PC22A-infected vero cells (C) and TGEV Miller-inoculated ST cells (D) were at 160- and 40-fold antigenic cross-reactions determined by CCIF among various strains of PEDV and TGEV using hyperimmune or convalescent-phase pig PEDV and TGEV antisera. two hyperimmune TGEV Miller antisera (S409 and M20) and one TGEV Miller N protein MAb (14G9.3C) showed cross-reactivity with all PEDV isolates. um showed the same or slightly higher (4-fold) titers of CCIF antibody against homologous TGEV but did not cross-react with any PEDV strains. all 3 U.S. PEDV strains had the same antigenic reactivity patterns with the same panel of hyperimmune and convalescent-phase antisera. logous antibody were 10,240 (U.S. PEDV strains) and 160 (PEDV CV777) none of the PEDV N and S protein MAbs tested cross-reacted to TGEV Miller or Purdue. all PEDV MAbs reacted with all PEDV strains at various titers. TGEV Miller and Purdue hyperimmune or convalescent-phase antisera neutralized the homologous virus at titers ranging from 1,024 to 16,384. none of the pig PEDV hyperimmune or convalescent-phase antisera had detectable TGEV viral neutralization antibodies by PRVN assays. none of the PEDV S or N MAbs tested in the present study showed virus neutralizing activity against PEDV or TGEV. all MAbs reacted with the homologous antigens at titers ranging from 640 to >40,960. full-length PEDV PC22A and TGEV Miller N proteins were expressed with a six-His tag on the C terminus. fusion proteins were expressed with a six-His tag on the C terminus. TGEV MAb (14G9.3C) reacted with both TGEV and PEDV recombinant N proteins. PEDV N MAb (6-29) recognized the recombinant PEDV N protein only. without trypsin treatment, all the PEDV strains exhibited HA. the ratios between the PEDV genomic equivalent (GE) and HA titer ranged from 5.51 to 6.13 log10 GEs per HA unit. trypsin-treated TGEV Miller and Purdue also showed HA. the impact of TGE is more limited, but current outbreaks of PED in swine cause significant losses in North America (9, 27) and Asia (5, 29, 30). the serological cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV was assessed by using pig antisera or MAbs. pig antisera cross-reacted with all PEDV strains at lower CCIF antibody titers. the lack of cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV detected in previous studies (9, 16, 19) may result from several possibilities. n pigs in the present study ensured that the antibody present in the TGEV-inoculated Gn pigs was induced only by TGEV antigen and totally free of PEDV antibodies. in 1992, have et al. reported a high prevalence of serum antibodies against a putative mink coronavirus that cross-reacted with both TGEV and PEDV. there are 3 distinct antigenic sites, N1, N2, and N3, on the TGEV N protein that are recognized by MAbs 25H7.3C, 14E3.1, and 14G9.3C. only anti-TGEV Miller N protein MAb (14G9.3C) cross-reacted with all PEDV strains. this may correspond to PEDV CV777 having a single amino acid (AG at position 84) change in the second motif. the presence of a strong immunodominant site in the N-terminal region of N protein is a common feature of the N protein from TGEV and PRCV and even the betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. truncation of the antigenic site in the N-terminal region to exclude the immunodominant cross-reactive epitope of the PEDV N protein can help to improve the specificity of the immunoassays. only one of three distinct antigenic epitopes (15, 20) located on TGEV N harbored a conserved amino acid sequence. only one corresponding TGEV N MAb, 14G9.3C, cross-reacted with PEDV strains. PEDV CV777 showed more differences in the genetic (3, 28), biologic (33), and antigenic features. similar to previous report that PEDV CV777 induced larger syncytia than PEDV DR13 (33) PEDV neutralizing epitopes were located on aa 499 to 638, 748 to 755, 764 to 771, and 1368 to 1374 of the S protein (3, 40), respectively. current outbreaks of highly virulent U.S. PEDV-like strains are still causing significant economic losses in Asia (5, 29, 30), despite the availability of inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines. the large deletion within the N-terminal portion of the S protein of PRCV is responsible for the loss of HA activity (23). the PEDV S 197del PC177 strain may lack HA activity and may be less pathogenic. this result suggests that components of the S protein responsible for HA activity could differ between PEDV and PEDV. edward et al."}
