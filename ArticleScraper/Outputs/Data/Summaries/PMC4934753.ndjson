{"summary": "MERS-CoV has an unusual broad host tropism that includes humans and dromedary camels. a better understanding of the molecular basis of the host tropism will help determine the restrictions of potential host species and improve the functional design of animal models. 5 out of 14 interacting amino acids (aa) allowing haDPP4 to function as a receptor for MERS-CoV. this restriction is caused by the minimal combination of these 5 amino acids (aa) which differ between hDPP4 and haDPP4. strain HCoV-EMC/2012 was propagated on vero E6 cells using DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml of streptomycin. cells were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus and scored for the cytopathic effect 5 days later. samples were collected using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) ten thousand gated events were analyzed for each sample. data for transfected BHK cells were compared with those for untransfected BHK cells. MERS-CoV was propagated on vero E6 cells using DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml of streptomycin (complete DMEM) cells were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of virus and scored for the cytopathic effect 5 days later. samples of cells were stained with secondary antibody only. only viable cells were selected using 7-aminoactinomycin D (Life Technologies) expression of the other single amino acid substitutions (V341L and I346V) resulted in virus titers similar to those from BHK cells transfected with wild-type hDPP4. expression of mutants with these mutations on BHK cells did not result in MERS-CoV replication. hamster origin with quadruple mutations to amino acids representing human DPP4. Mean viral titers were calculated from three independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviation. residues 291 and 336 were found to be the most critical, followed by residue 295. haDPP4 contains a hydrophilic residue at position 291 (E) and a neutral residue at position 295 (T) haDPP4 is predicted to contain a glycosylation site at position 336 which is absent in hDPP4. 341 and 346 form small hydrophobic patches with RBD residues. these residues are replaced by L341 and V346 in haDPP4. this effect is much less critical than the interaction between RBD and residues 291, 295 and 336."}
