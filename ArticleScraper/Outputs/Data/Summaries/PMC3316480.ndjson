{"summary": "exercise was designed to provide participants with an opportunity to evaluate current concepts, plans, and capabilities for a response to a multistate foodborne outbreak. the exercise was structured in 5 modules, representing the phases of an infectious disease outbreak (Figure 2). each module consisted of a multimedia depiction of. students present at a student health service with a virus that includes febrile lymphadenopathy and general malaise. five diagnostic tests are negative for infectious mononucleosis. about 20-30 students have presented with these symptoms over the last few days. an eye care center reports 2 cases of acute retinitis attributed to toxoplasmosis. a second implicates coleslaw. the owner is still on the move, and efforts to contact him have been unsuccessful. toxoplasmosis is a cause of foodborne disease rarely implicated in outbreaks. the organization selected toxoplasmosis as the cause of the outbreak. players affirmed the importance of personal relationships and contacts. the exercise revealed many gaps in communication with other institutions and agencies. the need for better communication and coordination across disciplines and jurisdictions was apparent. participants urged development of trigger points for notifying the \u201cnext level\u201d of responsibility. academic players recommended increasing situational awareness by communicating with the university community about the presumptive diagnosis. universities should be included on distribution lists for alerts from local and state health departments. there was no concurrence on the need for an incident command structure (ICS) participants questioned whether such an outbreak should be considered a public health emergency of international concern. most agreed on the need to engage the pan-american health organization and the ministry of health in the country of origin of the implicated pork. a review of responses to federally declared disaster events concluded academic institutions' participation in community disaster response has contributed to community resilience. each evaluator received a survey of 9 open-ended questions and a checkbox table to evaluate whether the exercise \u201ccompletely,\u201d \u201cpartially\u201d or \u201cmarginally\u201d met the objectives for each goal. participants recommended a role for SECEBT in enhancing coordination between state and university laboratories to ensure free flow of data and information during outbreaks. participants strongly supported the one health model, which emphasizes that mitigating zoonoses requires an integrated, interdisciplinary approach at the convergence of human health, animal health, and environmental science at the local, regional, national, and global levels. the tabletop exercise was not designed to test or assess the ability of stakeholders to respond to, manage, and recover from a public health threat. participants and evaluators advised expanding the group to include representation from local health departments, clinicians and basic science, maternal and child health, and legal groups. participants discussed trigger points for escalation of an investigation. the trigger points would be the university's student health service experiencing 3 or more temporally related cases. the trigger points would be the university's student health service experiencing 5 or more cases in the same day. participants agreed on the usefulness of scenario-based exercises to explore opportunities within the region for strengthening preparedness and response capacities. academic institutions are an untapped resource for public health preparedness and emergency response."}
