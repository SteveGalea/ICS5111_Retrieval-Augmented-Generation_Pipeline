{"summary": "respiratory viruses can cause mild to severe illnesses as well as frequent complications. adult patients in the ICU account for 28% of pneumonia cases. mortality rates are comparable to those of bacterial pneumonia. biorobot EZ1 and MgaNA pure Compact (Roche) were evaluated for stool, nasal, and nasopharyngeal aspirate samples in previous study [16\u201318]. however, these automated nucleic acid extraction systems were evaluated using multiplex PCR or multiples real-time PCR assays. only recently, multiple real-time PCR assay which is capable of detecting more than 14 viruses simultaneously was developed and widely used. mini kit v2.0 (Qiagen) and MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) were evaluated. three aliquot samples were separated from each specimen. nucleic acid of each aliquot samples was extracted on the same day. a real-time PCR reaction mixture was prepared with as follows: 8 L cDNA, 4 L 5x RV primer, 4 L 8-methoxypsoralen solution, and 4 L 5x Master Mix. the melting peaks were derived from the initial fluorescence (F) versus temperature (T) curves. fluA viral reference strains were obtained from the Korean Bank for Pathogenic Viruses (Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea) the reference strains were serially diluted with 10-fold saline buffer. each diluted sample was extracted 5 times using the 3 different automated nucleic acid extraction systems. oV-NP1F (GAC CTC TGT AAG TAC TAC), HBoV-NP1R (CTC TGT GTT GAC TGA ATA CAG) were performed using SPSS Statistics 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Analyse-it 2.22 (Analyse-it Software Ltd., Leeds, UK) 84 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 20 adult and cDNA was synthesized using the cDNA Synthesis Premix. it included reverse transcriptase and a random hexamer. cDNA was synthesized using the cDNA Synthesis Premix. CFX96 real-time PCR detection was performed using CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) the melting peaks were derived from the initial fluorescence (F) versus temperature (T) curves by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence over temperature versus temperature (dF/dT versus T) diluted sample was extracted 5 times using the 3 different automated nucleic acid extraction systems. diluted sample was extracted 5 times using the 3 different automated nucleic acid extraction systems. the results were considered a true positive and a true negative. 58 pathogens were detected in 44 nasopharyngeal swab specimens. proportions of single and dual infections were 75.0%, 18.2% and 6.8% respectively. RV (32.8%) was more than one-third of detected pathogens. the numbers of positives for respiratory viruses ranged from 54 to 59. the nucleic acids extracted by EZ1 Advanced XL showed higher positive rates for virus detection than the others. sensitivity, specificity, concordance rate, and kappa coefficients ranged from 87.2% to 93.3%. the QIAcube system showed the highest sensitivity for the RNA viruses. the EZ1 Advanced XL system showed the best percent sensitivity for the ADV. bVirus detected by only 1 of the three automated nucleic acid extraction systems.
