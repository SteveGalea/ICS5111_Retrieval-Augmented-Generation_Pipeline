{"summary": "Skeletal muscle homeostasis is achieved by finely balancing catabolic and anabolic processes. anabolic processes can be modulated by growth factors, nutrient availability, and physical activities. disuse and pathological conditions can compromise the fine homeostatic balance. pSTAT3 dimerizes and enters the nucleus to activate transcription of various genes. STAT3 signaling has been shown to be activated in skeletal muscle and promotes skeletal muscle atrophy in muscle diseases, such as duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) deletion of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) gene in mice injected with dimethylnitrosamine resulted in increased activation of STAT3 in liver cells. the aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of STAT3 signaling with a special focus on its role in skeletal muscle health and diseases. phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) was detected in satellite cells after acute injury while satellite cells engage in tissue repair. this correlates with the expression of MyoD, suggesting that STAT3 might play a role on the fate of satellite cells. at3 protein levels were 1.6- and 2.4-fold higher in satellite cells from young (2\u20134 months) and older adult (16\u201320 months) mice compared to adolescent mice (3 weeks), respectively. satellite cells treated with a siRNA against STAT3 showed a 2-fold increase in symmetric cell division. conditional knockdown of STAT3 in muscle satellite cells did not affect normal muscle development or number of Pax7+ satellite cells in muscles from STAT3 knockout (KO) mice compared to WT mice. cardiotoxin injured muscles from STAT3 KO mice showed a greater deficit in muscle regeneration after repeated cardiotoxin injections. STAT3 KO affects satellite cell myogenic progression by impairing proliferation and inducing premature differentiation. previous studies showed that IL6 upregulation and STAT3 activation are essential components for the adaptive responses to resistance training. a recent study showed that transient STAT3 activation in muscles is not required for exercise induced muscle hypertrophy. activation of STAT3 in immune cells in the muscles may also play significant roles in regulating muscle responses to exercise training. extensive studies have been done to investigate the benefit of exercise training to different diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer cachexia. axonal STAT3 is activated by the injury and provides a retrograde signaling to the nucleus. it promotes regeneration of both sensory and motor neurons [45,46,47,48,49]. Table 1. List of genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by STAT3. the prevalence of cachexia accounts roughly for 80% of upper gastrointestinal cancer patients and 60% of lung cancer patients at the time of diagnosis. physiological changes associated with cancer cachexia are anorexia, inflammation, insulin resistance, and, more importantly, an increase in the breakdown of muscle proteins. IL6 plasma levels have also been examined in cancer patients. they were significantly correlated to the degree of tumor progression and symptoms of cachexia in humans. the studies limited their analysis to serum IL6 and did not analyze total or activated STAT3 protein, in either skeletal muscle or other tissues. a contributing factor to skeletal muscle wasting is the decrease protein synthesis due to the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-dependent repression of mTOR signaling. it is now known that skeletal muscles of cachectic mice are subject to damaging stimuli due to circulating cytokines produced by tumor and host-defense. STAT3 signals in inflammatory myopathies The most well documented function of STAT3 has been linked to its role on the immune system. the purpose of the immune system is to protect the body against pathogens, but disorders in the immune system can lead to conditions such as autoimmune diseases. pSTAT3 was found in cells expressing the IL22 receptor 1, suggesting an autocrine inflammatory loop is present in affected muscles from PM/DM patients [88] a patient with a known STAT3 mutation reported complaining of pain on the right lower leg for 3 days and did not affect his ability to ambulate. an MRI scan reveled inflammation of the peroneus brevis and longus muscle, and the patient\u2019s serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were also studies will be needed to evaluate if STAT3 also plays a role in different inflammatory myopathies and if other patients with STAT3 mutations develop a muscle phenotype. there are over 30 types of MD caused by mutations in different genes. IL6 levels were up-regulated in the diaphragm muscle from 4 week old mdx mice. this was associated with increased expression of pSTAT3. expression of several transcription factors, including STAT3, was shown to be upregulated in diaphragm muscles from 6 week old mdx mice compared to WT mice. early onset of damage in the diaphragm, joint contractures, kyphosis, and premature death. mdx/utr/ mice administered an anti-IL6R antibody had a decrease in levels of pSTAT3. findings suggest that pSTAT3 activation might ameliorate the disease phenotype in some muscles. IL6 expression correlated with muscle immaturity. increased activation of the IL6/STAT3 pathway leads to decrease in muscle mass. underlying mechanisms contributing to MD disease pathology are complex. studies have shown that increased activation of TGF-1 leads to apoptosis of skeletal muscle precursor cells, endomysial fibrosis, muscle atrophy, and myoblast differentiation into fibrotic cells in vivo. studies have shown that increased activation of TGF-1 leads to apoptosis of skeletal muscle precursor cells. AT3 has been shown to increase cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. increased apoptosis and reducing activation of antitumor immunity. other studies have also shown different interactions between TGF-1 and STAT3. respiratory syndrome coronavirus papain-like protease was shown to induce a TGF-1-mediated pulmonary fibrosis via activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/p38 MAPK/STAT3/Egr-1 pathway. STAT3 can interfere with the TGF-1 signaling cascade by directly competing with SMAD4 for SMAD3 binding in epithelial cells. C2C12 cells were used to evaluate the effects of TGF-1 in STAT3 activation in vitro. results showed that C2C12 cells treated with recombinant TGF-1 protein had approximately an 8-fold increase in the levels of pSTAT3. this was the first study demonstrating an interaction of TGF-1 and STAT3 in skeletal muscles from mice."}
