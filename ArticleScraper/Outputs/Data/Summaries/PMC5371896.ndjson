{"summary": "the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002/2003. it spread across the globe causing 8000 infections and 800 deaths in 28 countries. mortality rates approached 50% in aged individuals [1,2,3] asymptomatic infections were rare during the SARS-CoV epidemic. asymptomatic infections often result in asymptomatic infections leading to asymptomatic spread. molecular mechanisms governing virus pathogenesis and disease severity remain understudied. the genome encodes for four structural proteins, the S (spike), E (envelope), M (matrix), and N (nucleoprotein) protein. these genes are interspersed with several additional luxury ORFs, which differ significantly among coronavirus in number, nucleotide sequence, gene order, and function. many have been shown to antagonize the innate immune response and influence disease severity. signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), TLR4, TLR7 and TLR3/TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- (TRIF) also play critical roles in controlling SARS-CoV in vivo and in vitro. nsps show high homology to proteins of other human coronaviruses. downstream open reading frames also antagonize sensing or signaling pathways, or block karyopherin 2 nuclear import [13,21] epigenetic modifications change the chromatin structure or modify the nucleic acid without altering the genetic code. this makes epigenetic modifications reversible, flexible, and quickly responsive to changes in the environment and other exposures. over the last decade epigenetics research has made rapid progress in understanding developmental biology, memory, and inheritability functions. epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) provide systematic identification of genome-wide epigenetic variants associated with disease outcomes. they can collect information about variation of epigenetic markers, global epigenetic patterns, and genome-wide distribution of epigenetic markers. they can provide functional correlation with genotypes and phenotypes associated with particular pathological or non-pathological outcomes, defining new disease-associated marks. the euchromatin and heterochromatin were originally distinguished cytogenetically by Giemsa staining procedures. the heterochromatin indicates tightly packaged protein and nucleic acid complexes found at centromers and telomers. they contain mostly inactive satellite DNA as opposed to the lighter-stained loosely-packed euchromatin. modifications on the same or different histone tails may be interdependent and generate various combinations on any one nucleosome, thereby supporting the modification-induced recruitment of chromatin-associated proteins. a specific crosstalk between histone modifications is possible [49,51] sine residues (K) can be methylated, acetylated, phosphorylated, and ubiquitinated. particular serine residues (S) can be also phosphorylated. many modifications have been associated with active or non-active transcription. a promoter occupied with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 can be rapidly activated or inactivated for transcription, making both modifications signature configurations for poising bivalent promoters. 'writers' are responsible for encrypting the information capacity of nucleosomes by adding distinct post-translational modifications to the histone tails. histone modifications are mediated by \u2018readers\u2019; proteins tightly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation through signaling pathways, recruitment and binding of co-factors.'readers' are often organized in protein complexes, containing a bromodomain, chromodomain, and tudor domains and harboring several putative modification-dependent binding sites. these proteins regulate DNA accessibility together with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, which are media chromatin-modifying enzymes play an important role in maintaining chromatin structure and dynamics. they can rapidly respond to external stimuli, thereby regulating the accessibility of the underlying DNA to the transcriptional machinery and ensuring the correct association of expressed genes. the presence of 5mC CGIs plays a critical role in regulation of gene expression. more than 60% of coding genes contain CGIs in promoter-associated regions. methylation of those promoter-associated CGIs will repress and silence promoter activity. epigenetics and miRNAs control each other to form a regulatory circuit. miRNAs control epigenetic pathways, like DNMTs and histone methyltransferases. expression of miRNAs on the other hand is regulated by histone modification. many modifications have been associated with active or non-active transcription. methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 is now associated with transcriptional repression of the particular gene. methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 is now associated with transcriptional repression. the state of the chromatin is modulated by a large number of proteins. \u2018writers\u2019 are responsible for encrypting the information capacity of nucleosomes. \u2018writers\u2019 are responsible for encrypting the information capacity of nucleosomes. \u2018writers\u2019 are responsible for encrypting the information capacity of nucleosomes by adding distinct post-translational modifications to the histone tails. these proteins regulate DNA accessibility together with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. this mediates pioneer transcription factors that are involved in recruiting transcription machinery complexes to bind at nucleosome-free DNA regions and initiate gene expression. this guarantees a specific modification and response to environmental stimuli. methylation occurs at the 5\u2032 position of the cytosine ring within CpG nucleotides. the modification is mediated by a family of enzymes, the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) DNMT1 functions as maintenance methyltrasferase, ensuring that the methylation status is maintained during DNA replication. non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) evolved from its historic origins as \u201cjunk RNA\u201d and quickly expanded into its own field of research. ncRNAs can be divided into long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) based on whether each RNA is greater than or less than 200 bp in length. FAIRE is a method to isolate regulatory elements from eukaryote chromatin. the method involves crosslinking the chromatin by adding formaldehyde. phenol-chloroform is added to separate protein (nucleosome-depleted) DNA fragments from nucleosome-covered DNA. cross-linked chromatin is sheared and the DNA-binding protein of interest is precipitated by using a protein-specific antibody. the bound DNA is then isolated by reverting the cross-linking and can be analyzed by utilizing microarrays (ChIP-on-chip), next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), and quantitative PCR (ChIP-PCR) methylated DNA is sheared and precipitated with a monoclonal antibody. the resulting enrichment of methylated DNA can be determined by PCR. methylated DNA can be combined with large-scale analysis. FAIRE is a method to isolate regulatory elements from eukaryote chromatin. the method involves crosslinking the chromatin by adding formaldehyde. phenol-chloroform is added to separate protein (nucleosome-depleted) DNA fragments from nucleosome-covered DNA. the combination of the ChIP technology with next-generation sequencing allows and improves the characterization of binding sites for transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins. the advancement in high resolution is crucial in profiling nucleosome positioning, the systematic cataloguing of histone modification patterns, and the establishment of precise histone modification maps throughout the entire genome. cross-linked chromatin is sheared and the DNA-binding protein of interest is precipitated by using a protein-specific antibody. the bound DNA is then isolated by reverting the cross-linking and can be analyzed by using microarrays (ChIP-on-chip), next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and quantitative PCR (ChIP-PCR) approach based on immune precipitation is the Methyl-DNA binding protein ChIP. the resulting enrichment of methylated DNA can be determined by PCR. precipitated methylated DNA can be combined with large-scale analysis using microarrays or next-generation-sequencing. the innate immune system accomplishes this by being able to generate and drive a transcriptional response that is both cell- and stimulus-specific. many of the innate immune response is regulated by membrane-bound and intracellular PAMPs, like TLRs, RIG-I, MDA-5 and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. studies have involved epigenetic factors in every aspect of activation and shaping innate and adaptive immune responses. the main players of the innate immune system are primary response genes like IFN and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) the promoters of these genes also contain CpG islands which are resistant to epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation and histone tail modification. fang et al. correlated the levels of H3K9me2 modification with the level of interferon expression in vitro. the overall levels of H3K9me2 mark in the promoter region of the type I interferon and the expression of ISGs inversely correlate in dendritic cells. 104,105 viruses have evolved antagonistic mechanisms to overcome specific ISG effectors. innate immune responses are subject to extensive epigenetic regulation. a viral NS1 protein mimics the histone tail of the H3 histone. it thereby interacts with the transcription complex. infected cells mounted a robust IFN-induced antiviral state starting at 3 h post infection. the response was significantly delayed with peak expression at 24 to 48 h post infection. in 2012, the newly emerged MERS-CoV showed delayed ISG production with effects visible at 18-h post infection. merS-CoV infection drives H3K27me3 enrichment and depletes H3K4me3 for a subset of genes, favoring a closed chromatin conformation that inhibits interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. we then applied ChIP-Seq data to the expression data. HM (histone modification) indicate occupancy with H3K27me3 (K27, blue) and H3K4me3 (K4, yellow), respectively. the responsible binding motif is not contained in NS1 protein encoded by H5N1-VN1203. NS1 may inhibit ISG expression by mimicking different histones, targeting histone-modifying enzymes, or disrupting a histone adaptor protein complex. novel patterns of virus-induced regulatory control are revealed by filtering expression changes to specific subsets of cytokine specific gene sets after infection. the same set of ISGs are either globally induced rapidly or differentially induced following SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, respectively. integration across data types Host\u2013pathogen relationships are plastic and dynamic. selective pressure put on the pathogen increases the degree of plasticity and adaptability of the pathogen. for a successful viral life cycle, viruses have co-evolved with the host, which often means that the virus has to adjust to the host\u2019s immune system. integration across systems-based data types will allow us to predict gene expression and to infer new gene regulatory networks. these genome-wide based predictions are essential to define and interpret gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by linking epigenetic features to gene activation, gene expression levels are integrated into enrichment profiles. u3 cells are then infected with different highly pathogenic emerging or contemporary respiratory viruses and global proteomic and transcriptomic expression patterns. new patterns of virus-induced regulatory control are revealed while identifying novel gene sets for downstream epigenetic and virus studies. the same set of ISGs are either globally induced rapidly or differentially induced following SARS-CoV and H5N1 infection. selective pressure put on the pathogen increases the degree of plasticity and adaptability of the pathogen. selective pressure put on the pathogen by the host increases the degree of plasticity and adaptability of the pathogen. for a successful viral life cycle, viruses have co-evolved with the host. systems biology approaches allow the development of models to make comparisons of data across pathogens to better predict complex biological systems. integration across systems-based data types will allow us to predict gene expression and to infer new gene regulatory networks. a growing number of studies also show modulation of viral infection by chromatin in lytic virus infections. the emerging parallels between the existing knowledge of chromatin\u2019s effect on and interaction with latent and persistent viruses and the emerging understanding of its comparable interaction with lytic viruses suggest a greater focus on chromatin-based therapies for a variety of virus families."}
