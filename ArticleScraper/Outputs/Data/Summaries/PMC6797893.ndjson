{"summary": "the 2017-18 epidemic proved to be the most severe since 2003-04. worldwide, the 2017-18 epidemic proved to be the most severe since 2003-04. a universal vaccination program is the only safe and effective method of filling the gap. the usual length of the influenza season is 8-12 weeks, from late autumn to early spring. but this time-frame is arbitrary, as the definition varies widely across surveillance studies. influenza affects almost 10-20% of the world\u2019s population every year. it causes between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths and 3-5 million hospitalizations. despite the availability of antiviral drugs, the only effective method of preventing influenza and influenza-related complications is vaccination. despite the availability of antiviral drugs, the only effective method of preventing influenza and influenza-related complications is vaccination. different formulations of influenza vaccines exist: inactivated, live attenuated and recombinant. IIVs are egg-based compounds, which may contain whole inactivated virus, split virion or subunits, and induce specific antibodies against the hemoagglutinin component. IIVs are licensed for use in adults and children. the trivalent vaccine included an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. overall, the effectiveness of influenza immunization is estimated to be around 40-60%. influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) were diagnosed according to the \u201cWHO surveillance case definitions for ILI and SARI\u201d [24]. influenza season was defined according to the time-frame proposed by Smetana et al. to early spring ILI An acute respiratory infection with: history of fever or measured body temperature of 38C\u00b0+ cough. with onset within the last 10 days, and requiring hospitalization Severe flu Influenza presenting as SARI, requiring ICU admission and/or ECMO Influenza initially presenting as non-severe disease, and developing any of the signs and symptoms of progressive disease. influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) were diagnosed according to the \u201cWHO surveillance case definitions for ILI and SARI\u201d [24]. influenza season was defined according to the time-frame proposed by Smetana et al. measured body temperature of 38C\u00b0+ cough; with onset within the last 10 days; and requiring hospitalization Severe flu Influenza presenting as SARI, requiring ICU admission and/or ECMO Influenza initially presenting as non-severe disease, and subsequently developing any of the signs and symptoms of progressive disease. the patients admitted was 48 years (range 0-87 years); there was an equal distribution of genders (51.7% men, 48.3% women) two women were pregnant: one in the first trimester and one in the second. the seasonal peak was reached in the first two months of 2018, with 68.9% of all severe cases notified between January and February. the median duration of antiviral therapy was 7 days. the majority of these had respiratory syndromes: 44.8% complicated with bacterial pneumonia. none of the 3 patients aged under 50 years had been vaccinated. ARDS was diagnosed in 4 cases, acute heart failure in 2 cases, and myocarditis in 1 case. information on the type of influenza vaccine is not available. every patient presenting with symptoms compatible with respiratory or systemic illness should undergo the following work-up. for patients without any risk factor for severe Influenza forms: no routine testing nor routine antiviral treatment, unless no spontaneous improvement in 1 week. an adequate treatment for community-acquired pneumonia should be selected. oral antibiotics are the preferred choice; parenteral treatment should be selected. antibiotic escalation should be considered in the case of insufficient improvement within 72 hours. in the 2017-18 season, a total of 30,453 influenza-related hospitalizations were reported in the 2017-18 season. in the 2017-18 season, a total of 30,453 influenza-related hospitalizations were reported. in the 2017-18 season, a total of 30,453 influenza-related hospitalizations were reported. 84 (49%) were infected with virus A/H1N1pdm09, 76 (44%) with B virus, and 13 (7%) with an unsubtyped influenza A virus. the results of our analysis reflected the global and national epidemiology in the 2017-18 influenza season. virological confirmation of influenza cases contributes to epidemiological monitoring. high-risk subjects and those with serious respiratory or systemic symptoms should be hospitalized and managed according to the best practice."}
