{"summary": "the prevalence of RV-specific antibodies was detected using a polyclonal antibody-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA) out of 394 serum samples, 255 (64.72%) samples were found to be positive for RV-specific antibody in i-ELISA. RV belongs to the genus RV under the family Reoviridae[6]. RVs are classified into G-type and P-type based on the VP7 and VP4 structural genes. infected viruses preferentially multiply in the intestinal epithelia and cause extensive damage to the enterocytes. study was conducted in six districts of Arunachal Pradesh, viz., lower Subansiri, upper Subansiri, East Siang, West Siang, Papumpare, and Lohitwhere pig farming is commonly practiced. in organized farms, animals were reared following modern scientific managemental practices such as regular deworming. the samples were obtained from the ear vein or cranial vena cava. the samples were labeled properly, transported in ice-box to the laboratory. a total of 394 numbers of serum samples were collected from the pig population. dilution of the serum sample was done with initial dilution of 1:10 in blocking buffer containing 5% lactalbuminhydrolysate. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. washing was repeated as before. in unorganized farms, animals were reared following modern scientific managemental practices such as regular deworming, proper vaccination, etc. piglets (2-4 months age) and corresponding sows (mothers\u2019) were targeted for studying the RV prevalence. freeze-dried virus was reconstituted in 0.5 ml of distilled water. the working virus dilution was determined following chequerboard titration technique. out of 394 serum samples, 255 (64.72%) were found positive for RV antibodies. papumpare district of Arunachal Pradesh showed highest number of seropositive animals. there is no data available on the prevalence of RV infection from pig population of achal Pradesh. results of the present serological study carried out in pigs of Arunachal Pradesh have shown that RV specific antibodies were prevalent in 64.72% of pigs. the highest prevalence of RV-specific antibodies was found in adult animals (sows) study confirms the prevalence of RV infection among the pig population of Arunachal Pradesh. further studies are needed to elucidate the transmission, epidemiology, and characterization of the prevalent RV in the pig population ofArunachal Pradesh."}
