{"summary": "the surface epithelia of the mucosa are the major entry site of most pathogens in the host. the IFN family is categorized into three different types: type I IFN (IFN-/), type II IFN (IFN-), and type III IFN (IFN-). type II IFN exerts limited direct antiviral activity and plays a key role in controlling viral infection (4\u20138) the spectrum of genes elicited by the two types of IFNs shows a high overlap (2). however, recent studies have demonstrated that type III IFNs are critical non-redundant antiviral mediators of type I IFNs. IFN-1, IFN-3, and IFN-induced genes have not been compared. previous studies have focused on the gene profiles induced by human or mouse IFN-1 and IFN-. but the mechanisms underlying the difference remain less clear. the biological antiviral activity of porcine IFN-lambda 3 was calculated using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) the weight-activity unit (U/ml) of samples was calculated using porcine prokaryotic-derived IFN- (4.0 108 U/mg) as a reference. the plate was filled with Complete IntestiCult Organoid Growth Medium. the plate was seeded into a 48-well plate at 50 crypts per well. the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min until the Matrigel solidified. the synthesized cDNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the PrimeScriptTM II First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, China) the synthesized cDNA was subjected to qPCR performed in triplicate using a lightCycler\u00ae 480 II real-time PCR instrument (Roche, Switzerland) and SYBR Green PCR mix (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was purified using the TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. total RNA from each sample was quantified and qualified using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. first-strand cDNA was synthesized using ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase. second-strand cDNA was synthesized using a second-Strand Synthesis Enzyme Mix. the product was subjected to T\u2013A ligation to add adaptors to both ends. fragments of 360 bp (with an approximate insert size of 300 bp) were recovered. RNA-Seq was performed and analyzed using the HiSeq instrument. the analysis of the microarray data to identify differentially expressed genes was performed using edgeR software. the data are subjected to differential expression analysis. pRSAD2/pMX2-HA expression plasmid was cloned into pCAGGS-HA. vero E6 cells were grown in 48-well plates to 70\u201380% confluence. the expression of pRSAD2/pMX2 was verified by anti-HA IFA. 777 of genotype 1 (GenBank Accession No. KT323979) was maintained at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin. biological antiviral activity of recombinant porcine IFN-lambda 3 was prepared in our laboratory and evaluated in MDBK cells. the intestine crypts were resuspended in 25 l of IntestiCult Organoid Growth Medium and 25 l of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) per 50 crypts. the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min until the Matrigel solidified. the culture medium was exchanged every 3\u20134 days. PCR Total RNA (1 g) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Simply P Total RNA Extraction Kit (BioFlux, China) the synthesized cDNA was subjected to qPCR performed in triplicate using a lightCycler\u00ae 480 II real-time PCR instrument (Roche, Switzerland) and SYBR Green PCR mix (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was purified using the TRIzol reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. total RNA from each sample was quantified and qualified using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. poly mRNA isolation was performed using a NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB) or Ribo-ZeroTM rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina) mRNA fragmentation and priming were performed using a second-stranded cDNA. the purified double-stranded cDNA was then treated with End Prep Enzyme Mix to repair both ends and add adaptors to both ends. 150-bp paired-end (PE) configuration and image analysis were conducted using HiSeq Control Software (HCS) + OLB + GAPipeline-1.6 (Illumina) provided with the HiSeq instrument. RNA-Seq was performed and analysed using edgeR software. the PCR products were purified, digested, and cloned into pCAGGS-HA. pRSAD2/pMX2-HA expression plasmid was verified by anti-HA IFA. differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann\u2013Whitney test. IFN- and IFN-3 significantly suppressed PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. IFN- reduced number of PEDV genomes by 24-fold. IFN-3 decreased number of PEDV genomes by approximately 342-fold. the differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test. P 0.05 was considered significant, and the p values are expressed as follows. the IFN-3-stimulated cells showed a total of 997 differentially expressed genes, including 983 upregulated genes and 14 downregulated genes. the number of IFN-3-modified genes was approximately 10-fold higher than that of IFN--modified genes. these results indicate that the intestine epithelia respond better to IFN-3 than to IFN-. IFN-3 (1,000 ng/ml) and IFN- (1,000 ng/ml) for 24 h. venn map analysis of common differentially expressed genes elicited by either IFN-3 or IFN-. differentially expressed genes were concentrated on five functions: the cellular process, the single-organism process, the biological regulation, the metabolic process, and the response to stimulus. however, the numbers of differentially expressed genes after IFN- treatment were notably lower than those obtained after IFN-3 treatment. differentially expressed genes were most abundantly involved in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, followed by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway. the results showed that the differentially expressed genes were most abundantly involved in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, followed by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. differentially expressed genes induced by IFN-3 or IFN- were analyzed using software kobas3.0. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes induced by IFN-3 or IFN-. lucidate the mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity discrepancy between IFN-3 and IFN-. we divided them into three subgroups (classical ISGs, weakly IFN-3-induced genes, and strongly IFN-3-induced genes) the expression of the 100 top genes in all three subgroups induced by IFN-3 was significantly higher than that induced by IFN-. IFN-3 induces a stronger antiviral innate immune response compared with IFN-. the analysis of the three subgroups confirmed that IFN-. IFN-3 upregulated the expression of large distinct classes of ISGs in the classical ISG subgroup. the OASL and OAS1 fold changes induced by IFN-3 were up to nearly 10-fold higher than those induced by IFN-. RSAD2, PLAC8, and IFIT2 were more substantially upregulated by IFN-3 than by IFN-. 0.05, **p 0.01, ***p 0.005, and ****p 0.001 represent a unique ex vivo model for studying the intestine. we stimulated enteroids with IFN-3 or IFN- under the same conditions as IPEC-J2 cells. in the classical ISG subgroup, the upregulated levels of MX2 and IFIT3 elicited by IFN-3 were 3- to 5-fold higher than those induced by IFN-. porcine enteroids were primed with IFN-3 (1,000 ng/ml) or IFN- (1,000 ng/ml) for 24 h. total RNA from enteroids was extracted and used for RT-qPCR. differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test. pMX2 or pRSAD2 selectively elicited pMX2 or pRSAD2. overexpression of pMX2 or pRSAD2 inhibited PEDV infection. pMX2 or pRSAD2 was expressed in the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS-HA. IFN- and IFN-3 significantly suppressed PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 cells. IFN- reduced the number of PEDV genomes by 24-fold. IFN-3 decreased the number of PEDV genomes by approximately 342-fold. DV CV777 at an MOI of 1, and the PEDV viral genome numbers (A) and titers (B) at 48 hpi were determined by RT-qPCR and TCID50 titration. differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test. the IFN-3-stimulated cells showed a total of 997 differentially expressed genes, including 983 upregulated genes and 14 downregulated genes. the number of IFN-3-modified genes was approximately 10-fold higher than that of IFN--modified genes. results indicate that the intestine epithelia respond better to IFN-3 than to IFN-. IPEC-J2 cells were primed or not with IFN-3 (1,000 ng/ml) and IFN- (1,000 ng/ml) for 24 h. the total RNA isolated from the cells was used for RNA sequencing. differentially expressed genes were concentrated on five functions: the cellular process, the single-organism process, the biological regulation, the metabolic process, and the response to stimulus. however, the numbers of differentially expressed genes after IFN- treatment were notably lower than those obtained after IFN-3 treatment. differentially expressed genes induced by IFN-3 involved in much broader signal pathways compared with IFN. the differentially expressed genes were most abundantly involved in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway followed by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway. the differentially expressed genes were most abundantly involved in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway. AK2, STAT2, PTEN, PIK3CA, IRS1, KRAS, and IL6ST are closely related to other proteins. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes induced by IFN-3 or IFN-. the differential genes induced by IFN-3 or IFN- were analyzed using software kobas3.0. IFN-3 induces Specific Antiviral Gene Expression Compared With IFN-. we divided the top 100 IFN-3-induced genes into three subgroups. expression of the 100 top genes in all three subgroups induced by IFN-3 was significantly higher compared with that induced by IFN-. activity that can inhibit both DNA and RNA viruses, is the top gene upregulated by IFN-3 (28). activity that can inhibit both DNA and RNA viruses is the top gene upregulated by IFN-3 (28). activity that can inhibit both DNA and RNA viruses is the top gene upregulated by IFN-3 (28). the analysis of the three subgroups confirmed that IFN-3 most substantially upregulated the expression of ISGs. IFN-3 upregulated the expression of large distinct classes of ISGs in the classical ISG subgroup, such as MX2, ISG15, and IFIT3, the ISG fold changes induced by IFN-3 were up to nearly 10-fold higher than those induced by IFN-. p values are expressed as follows: *p 0.05, **p 0.01, ***p 0.005, and ****p 0.001. the different Transcription Profiles in Enteroids Induced by IFN-3 or IFN- Enteroids derived from intestinal crypt stem cells constitute a unique ex vivo model for studying the intestine. porcine enteroids suggest that IFN-3 exerts a greater effect in gastrointestinal epithelial cells than IFN-. the differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test. the differences between groups were compared using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test. pMX2 or pRSAD2 selectively elicited pMX2 or pRSAD2. pMX2 or pRSAD2 was cloned and expressed in pCAGGS-HA. pMX2 or pRSAD2 was cloned and expressed in eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS-HA. the transcriptional profile induced by type III IFN in the intestinal epithelia was unique compared with that induced by type I IFN. stimulation with IFN-3 resulted in higher levels of most ISGs but also substantially increased diversity in the gene profiles involved in various cellular functions. studies of different signaling pathways induced by IFN-3 or IFN- will help dissect the complex interaction of IFN-induced signaling pathways. most somatic cells can induce and respond to type I IFNs, but certain specialized cells selectively produce and respond to type III IFNs during various virus infections. the differential expression in IPEC-J2 or enteroids detected by qPCR is not related to the selection of housekeeping gene GAPDH. the different antiviral activities of IFN-3 and IFN-induced gene expression in enteroids are likely due to the different degrees of ISG induction by these two cytokines. the functions of some of the genes that were strongly induced by IFN-3 have been reported, but the functions and mechanisms of more genes remain unclear. porcine MX2 inhibits PEDV infection in vero E6 cells. we compared the transcriptional profiles of IFN-3 and IFN- in IPEC-J2 cells. we identified a unique set of genes strongly induced by IFN-3 compared with IFN-. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
