{"summary": "infection must be recognized by the cell via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) one major class of receptors, often implicated in the recognition of RNA viruses, are the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a negative-strand RNA virus, is a member of the Nairovirus genus (family Bunyaviridae) the CCHFV genome encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, surface glycoproteins, and a nucleocapsid (N) protein. recombinant CCHFV stocks were obtained after 2 passages in human adrenal carcinoma cells (SW13) cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% sodium pyruvate. in vitro growth kinetics were characterized and were undistinguish. secreted levels of human IFN- were quantified using the veriKine or veriKine-HS human interferon beta ELISA kit. the absorbance of individual test samples was converted into picograms per milliliter using a standard curve generated by serially diluting the standard. cell nuclei stained with nucBlue live cell stain for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cytoplasm stained with HCS CellMask red stain. RNA was isolated using the MagMAX-96 total RNA isolation kit. a 124-nucleotide CCHFV fragment was amplified in triplicate for each sample. cells were lysed in sample buffer (2% SDS, 20 mM Tris, 5 mM NEM, and 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) before analysis, nuPAGE loading buffer and reducing agent were added. iMAX (Life Technologies) and specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) against RIG-I (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), IFIH-1/MDA5 (ON-TARGETplus smart siRNA pool from GE Dharmacon), MAVS, or control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) the amount of siRNA used was 60 pmol/well, 10 pmol/well, or 3 luciferase activity was expressed either as relative luciferase units (RLU) or as percent activity of respective negative-control digests. optimization experiments revealed peak immunostimulation with 50 ng of transfected CCHFV virion RNA (vRNA) increased CCHFV input RNA up to 5-fold did not increase the IFN response under the conditions used. RNA was isolated from the bead-bound RNP complexes with 100 g/ml proteinase K (Ambion) at 55\u00b0C for 30 min. RNA was purified using acid\u2013phenol-chloroform (pH 4.5) solution. ten microliters of this RNA was used to transfect 293T-IFN-FF cells. fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin were rescued. recombinant CCHFV stocks were obtained after 2 passages in human adrenal carcinoma cells. cell nuclei were stained for 2 h at room temperature with anti-CCHFV HMAF, washed with PBS, and stained with HCS CellMask red stain. RNA was isolated using the MagMAX-96 total RNA isolation kit. a 124-nucleotide CCHFV fragment was amplified in triplicate for each sample using a superscript III platinum one-step qRT-PCR kit. a 124-nucleotide CCHFV fragment was amplified in triplicate for each sample using a superscript III platinum one-step qRT-PCR kit. Membranes were processed with target-specific primary antibodies, visualized with species-specific horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody. protein imaging and quantification were performed using a FluorChem system and AlphaView software. protein levels were standardized to those of actin. vero-E6 cells were infected with CCHFV (IbAr10200 strain) or RVFV (rRVFV-NSs:GFP-NSm strain), respectively. supernatants were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. samples were extracted in Tripure isolation reagent (Life Technologies) supernatants from centrifugation-clarified lysates were diluted 1:5 in NT2 buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.05% NP-40. precleared samples were incubated with 50 g of total RNA from CCHFV-, RVFV-, or mock-infected SW13 cells at 4\u00b0C for 30 min to data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0c (GraphPad, laJolla, CA), by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni multiple comparison posttest. RESULTS CCHFV infection induces a type I IFN response. human IFN- expression was measured by ELISA in samples collected 24 and 48 h postinfection. CCHFV infection (WT; MOI, 1) results in increased total STAT1 and activated (phosphorylated) pSTAT1. mRNA levels of ISG56, an early immune-stimulated gene that inhibits translation in virus-infected cells, were detected as early as 8 hpi in cells infected with CCHFV. a sustained increase in mRNA levels of both ISG56 and MxA was dependent on productive virus replication. RIG-I and MDA5 expression is upregulated in CCHFV-infected cells. a549 cells were infected with CCHFV (MOI, 0.1 or 1.0) and samples were collected for RNA isolation. levels were quantified by qRT-PCR, standardized to -actin. levels were expressed as the fold change from the levels of mock-infected cells. a549 cells were infected with CCHFV or UV-treated CCHFV (MOI, 5.0) increased expression of RIG-I and MDA5 in the context of CCHFV infection is consistent with induction of a type I IFN response. targeted siRNA reduced MDA5 RNA expression by 30% and that of RIG-I by over 70% in mock-infected cells. after 24 h, cells were infected with CCHFV (MOI, 1.0), 24 h later, cells were harvested either for total cellular RNA isolation and qRT-PCR. decreased RIG-I expression reduced secreted IFN- in A549 cells. previous reports suggest RIG-I is not involved in recognition of CCHFV due to characteristics of the 5\u2032 termini of the genome. dpi indicates a direct effect of RIG-I-mediated immune responses on viral replication. we used mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines: WT, RIG-I knockout (RIG-I KO) and a RIG-I KO cell line that endogenously expresses human RIG-I (hRIG-I) CCHFV infected significantly more RIG-I KO cells than WT or hRIG-I reconstituted cells. CCHFV virion RNA is sufficient to stimulate a RIG-I-mediated IFN response. a 5\u2032p RNA genome is thought to be a strategy to evade host antiviral responses. we measured the IFN-dependent luciferase reporter activity 24 and 48 h after CCHFV infection. increased luciferase activity then was measured to investigate the nature of the PAMP synthesized during CCHFV replication. the identity and integrity of bunyavirus vRNAs were confirmed using denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. bands corresponding in size to CCHFV and RVFV segments confirmed vRNA enrichment and relative purity of these preparations. transfection of CCHFV vRNA resulted in significantly increased IFN- promoter activity over that of mock-transfected cells. total RNA from CCHFV- or RVFV-infected cells was incubated with recombinant RIG-I. RNA complexes were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-RIG-I antibody or control antibody (IgG) RNA was transfected into 293T-IFN--FF-Luc cells. luciferase activity was measured by luciferase assays. a single asterisk indicates a significant difference (P 0.05) from control. phosphate groups abolished the IFN- promoter activity induced by CCHF and RVF virion RNA preparation. we digested virion RNA with 5\u2032-polyphosphatase, an enzyme that sequentially removes the - and -phosphates but does not affect the -phosphate group. adding 5\u2032-polyphosphatase will convert a 5\u2032ppp RNA genome to 5\u2032p, while 5\u2032p RNA will remain unchanged RNA digested with APex heat-labile alkaline phosphatase, 5\u2032-polyphophatase, or RNase V1 was transfected into 293T-IFN-FF reporter cells. no enzyme added or enzyme was heat inactivated in the case of APex-treated RNA. ion was observed in infected cells than in mock-infected cells. increased IFN- gene expression (MOI, 1.0) was not observed until 12 hpi. increased IFN- gene expression was not observed until 12 hpi. mRNA levels of the indicated genes were assessed by qRT-PCR. data are represented as means standard deviations (SD) from a minimum of triplicate samples. xA was dependent on productive virus replication, as UV-inactivated CCHFV induced these genes poorly. CCHFV infection with a higher MOI resulted in increased vRNA synthesis at early time points after infection. higher levels of CCHFV RNA were associated with an increased IFN response. expression of RIG-I and MDA5 is upregulated in CCHFV-infected cells. a549 cells were infected with CCHFV (MOI, 0.1 or 1.0) samples were collected for RNA isolation and analysis at the indicated time points. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize RNA viruses differently (35, 36) some viruses are recognized by both RIG-I and MDA5 (1, 37, 38), but most are recognized predominantly by one or the other. increased expression of RIG-I and MDA5 is consistent with induction of a type I IFN response. RIG-I, MDA5, and MAVS knockdown by siRNA transfection in CCHFV-infected A549 cells with or without CCHFV or RVFV infection. after 24 h, cells were reverse transfected with RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, or nontargeted control (ct) siRNA. after 24 h, cells were harvested either for total cellular RNA isolation and qRT-PCR. to investigate the effects of RIG-I on viral replication, we determined CCHFV titers in cells treated with siRNA against RIG-I. when RIG-I expression was decreased by siRNA in A549 cells, mean viral titers increased by 3.95-fold compared to those of infected cells without knockdown at 2 and 3 dpi. supernatants collected for TCID50 determination. CCHFV infected significantly more RIG-I KO cells than WT or hRIG-I reconstituted MEFs. CCHFV vRNA has a terminal 5\u2032p instead of the 5\u2032ppp group. IFN responses to incoming RNA virus nucleocapsids occur only if the genome contains a 5\u2032-triphosphate (43) thus, a 5\u2032p RNA genome is thought to be a strategy to evade or delay host antiviral responses. total RNA from CCHFV-infected cells induced an IFN- and ISG56 response. RNA from uninfected cells (mock) did not. identity and integrity of bunyavirus vRNAs were confirmed using denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. atants of CCHFV- and RVFV-infected cells (D) were transfected into 293T-IFN--FF reporter cells. cells were transfected with siRNA or control (ct) siRNA. reporter activity was assessed 24 h later. CCHFV RNA coimmunoprecipitates with RIG-I. RNA was transfected into 293T-IFN--FF-Luc cells. a single asterisk indicates a significant difference (P 0.05) from control. alkaline phosphatase was used to remove phosphate groups from RNA. CCHFV immunostimulation was due to 5\u2032p and not 5\u2032pp or 5\u2032ppp RNA. 5\u2032-polyphosphatase digestion did not significantly reduce immunostimulation by CCHFV RNA. virion RNA digestion with dsRNA-specific RNase V1 abolished the luciferase induction seen with RVFV RNA. 11% of CCHFV activity was retained. nairoviruses and hantaviruses employ this strategy by processing the 5\u2032 termini of their genome RNA to generate 5\u2032-monophosphorylated RNA (14). despite previous assumptions about 5\u2032p recognition, RIG-I and MAVS mediated the upregulation of type-I IFN and ISGs in response to virus infection. the mechanism of 5\u2032 terminus processing for nairoviruses has not been described yet. it involves an endonuclease that removes the 5\u2032 terminal extension of the genome, leaving the 5\u2032 pU at position +1 (47) production of 5\u2032p termini by CCHFV may involve the generation of 5\u2032ppp intermediates or truncated defective interfering particles. nairoviruses have been shown to target activated RIG-I to control innate immune signaling. CCHFV OTU overexpression in this way can block RIG-I signaling. however, it remains to be seen if CCHFV infection can induce a general reduction of protein ubiquitination levels. potential for 5\u2032p genomes to serve as RIG-I ligands."}
