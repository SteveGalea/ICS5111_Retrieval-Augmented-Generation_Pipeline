DNA was dissolved in 0.1 TE buffer (10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and stored at 20 \u00b0C. promoter polymorphisms at nt 550 (H/L, rs11003125), 221 (Y/X, rs7096206), and +4 (P/Q, rs7095891) were selected for genotyping. the accuracy of genotyping data for each SNP was validated by masking, choosing at random, and resequencing 5% of the samples from the opposite strand. differences of mean age between TB patients and controls were analyzed using the unpaired t test (SPSS software, version 10.0) haplotypes of the MBL2 gene of the case-control population were assigned by the PHASE program36. P values of association between haplotypes and disease risk were evaluated using the haplo.score-function37 in the haplo.stats package (version 1.7.7) of R."}
