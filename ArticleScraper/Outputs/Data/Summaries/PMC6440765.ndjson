{"summary": "acute respiratory viral infections are estimated to cause 5.8 million deaths worldwide. up to 650, 000 deaths are related to respiratory diseases from seasonal influenza (5). influenza-like illness is a common presentation among working-age adults. international evidence has shown an association between rapid viral diagnosis and reductions in hospital length of stay (LOS) (12) and other laboratory test ordering practices (13\u201315) the impact of the introduction of a rapid PCR has not yet been investigated in Australia. the standard PCR used in this study consisted of patients tested for respiratory viruses using the standard multiplex PCR during the preimplementation (standard PCR group) the standard PCR used in this study consisted of patients tested for influenza or RSV using the rapid PCR during the postimplementation (rapid PCR group) it was available as a referral test at a large referral laboratory located at hospital B. rapid PCR testing was available 24 h a day, 7 days a week, and outside the influenza season, the test was available on demand with approval from the pathologist or registrar on duty. the control groups were selected randomly from the population after matching during the respective study periods on study hospital, age quartile, mode of separation from the hospital. descriptive statistics, including medians with interquartile ranges, were calculated. the impact of a rapid PCR on hospital LOS was assessed using a median regression. median regression is robust to extreme values and therefore well suited for modeling LOS (20). the study period was between July and December 2016 (preimplementation) and between July and December 2017 (postimplementation) the inclusion criteria were patients (aged >18 years) admitted with a respiratory illness. the standard PCR used in this study consisted of allplex respiratory panels 1, 2, and 3 (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea) bocavirus (types 1, 2, 3, and 4), coronavirus (types OC43, 229E, and NL63), and rhinovirus (types A, B, and C) (16). rapid PCR used in this study was a cepheid Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) LOS was calculated by subtracting the admission date/time from the hospital separation date/time. we compared utilization of commonly ordered microbiology tests, including blood culture, urine microscopy, culture, and sensitivity (urine MC&S); sputum culture; respiratory bacterial serology (e.g., Parainfluenza Ab complement fixation test [CFT], Adenovirus CFT and RSV Ab CFT) analyses were conducted using Stata version 15 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) RESULTS Demographic and clinical characteristics. intervention group included 2,162 patients (953 preimplementation [standard PCR group] and 1,209 postimplementation [rapid PCR group].
