{"summary": "new techniques and growing data constantly challenge our existing understandings. a vast pool of information is required for ensuring correct folding of polypeptide into its native structure. mRNA molecule obviously contains more information than primary protein sequence. a major focus was placed on regulatory signals in major mRNA coding sequences rather than a specific mRNA fragment such as translational ramp at 5' end. a major focus was placed on regulatory signals in major mRNA coding sequences rather than a specific mRNA fragment such as translational ramp at 5' end. nascent polypeptide folds co-translationally while it is being synthesized. mRNA, ribosome and nascent polypeptide form a complex. current models linking mRNA structure to protein folding are all based upon co-translational folding pathway. -helix within exit tunnel has been directly confirmed by FRET. additional evidence suggested exit tunnel could entropically stabilize both -helix (Ziv et al., 2005) and distinct conformations of nascent polypeptide via extensive contacts with ribosomal components. mRNA features implicated in modulating elongation speed and thus regulating co-translational protein folding. codon optimality influences translational efficiency and/or accuracy. the current mechanistic model of translational elongation dictates codon optimality. pechmann and colleagues modeled efficiency of translational elongation in 10 closely related yeast species. they found evolutionarily conserved distribution of codon optimality that is associated with secondary structure of translated polypeptides. mRNA sequences, and in particular synonymous codon choices, are generally under selection to optimize co-translational folding of corresponding polypeptides. secondary structure of nascent mRNA might lower local mutation rate. more importantly, specific mRNA structure could interfere with the movement of translating ribosome. experimentally determined protein secondary structures were directly compared with computationally predicted mRNA secondary structures (Jia et al., 2004). -helices and -strands within a folded protein tend to be encoded by double-stranded mRNA regions whereas random coils within polypeptide were more likely to be encoded by single-stranded mRNA regions. ribosome profiling used high-throughput sequencing of segmental mRNA shielded by translating ribosomes from endonuclease digestion. translational elongation rate was not uniform among different mRNAs or along a single mRNA molecule. ribosomal pauses lasting over a couple of seconds were widely distributed. mal codons failed to reveal any signal in genomic ribosome profiling data of several species. these studies explicitly tested the correlation between codon optimality and elongation speed. negative results so that other determinants of elongation speed were examined. a high expression of heterologous gene perturbed the balance between codon usage and tRNA supply. tRNA shortage was therefore proportionally less serious for optimal than non-optimal codons. results suggest no correlation between codon optimality and ribosomal velocity are not without their own problems. ribosome profiling was poor at codon resolution since signals at this level were not well-reproduced in experimental replicates. previous theoretical and experimental results have confirmed the regulation of co-translational protein folding by clusters of non-optimal codons through modulation of elongation speed. techniques have been developed for detecting pairing partners, including RPL (Ramani et al., 2015), PARIS (Lu et al., 2016), SPLASH (Aw et al., 2016) and LIGR-seq (Sharma et al., 2016). these advanced techniques have cleared the obstacles of genomic RNA structure investigation and enhanced the profiling accuracy of RNA secondary structure. the distance between adjacent ribosomes was approximately 20-35 nm in eukaryotes. it was translated into 50-90 nt or 17-30 codons, allowing enough time for intervening mRNA to refold. new genomic data were used for directly testing the connection between mRNA structure and protein folding by comparison among genes. regulatory role of mRNA structure in protein folding has become the only model capable of explaining stronger mRNA secondary structures in highly expressed genes. co-translational misfolding is a form of phenotypic mutation. mRNA structure may lead to a quantitative coupling between genotypic and phenotypic mutation rates. understanding the subtle roles of mRNA structure in protein misfolding and aggregation will reveal new therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.
