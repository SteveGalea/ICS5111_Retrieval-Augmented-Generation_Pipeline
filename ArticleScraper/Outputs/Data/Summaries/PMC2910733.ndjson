{"summary": "adenoviral (Ad) vectors have been used as vaccine vectors because of several attributes. the viral genome is readily manipulated allowing derivation of recombinant viruses. replication-defective Ads can be derived and propagated easily in complementing cell lines. an eight amino acid sequence of the VP1 capsid protein of poliovirus type 3 was inserted into two regions of the adenovirus serotype 2 hexon. one of the chimeric vectors produced from this methodology grew well in tissue culture and antiserum raised against the Ad with the polio insert specifically recognized the VP1 capsid of polio type 3. the major capsid protein hexon has been used for these antigen capsi we genetically incorporated identical model epitopes of increasing size within HVR2 or HVR5 of the Ad5 hexon. previous study showed that hexon-incorporated model antigens elicit a range of immune responses depending on antigen placement or antigen size at either the HVR2 or HVR5 locales. human monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 gp41 is specific for ELDKWA epitope [23]\u2013[25]. human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were obtained from and cultured in the medium recommended by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). resultant clone was designated as Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15. plasmid was digested with PmeI restriction enzyme. resulting plasmid was then recombined with the deleted Ad5 backbone. iter = 10101 + d(S 0.5)/ml, in which d is the log 10 of the dilution and S is the sum of ratios from the first dilution. modifications of the hexon gene was confirmed by PCR

monoclonal antibody (2F5) (11,000) the proteins were detected on the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane by staining with 3\u20323\u2032-diaminobenzidine tablets (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) ELISA plates were coated with 10 M of the MPER peptide in 100 l of 50 mM carbonate (pH 9.6) per well. plates were washed and then blocked with 3% BSA/PBS. after washing, 60 l of 120 diluted sera was added. cells were infected with Ads at 5 VPs/cell in 500 l growth medium. 1.5 ml more growth medium containing 10% FBS was then added into each well after 2 h incubation at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 humidified incubator. cells were monitored and harvested with medium at various time points post-infection. mouse immunization The following experiment was performed to determine antibody response after immunization with Ad vectors. female BALB/c (H-2Kd) mice at 6\u20138 weeks of age were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) cells were incubated with 140 dilution of monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 p24 (AG3.0) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. cells were washed again and incubated with 110 diluted PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (BD Farmingen) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. data were acquired with cellQuest software and analyzed on Flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) analysis of 3,000 CD8 T cells was collected per sample. statistical significance was defined as P0.03. human monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 gp41 is specific for ELDKWA epitope. ds were digested with EcoRI and PmeI. they were then recombined with a SwaI-digested Ad5 backbone vector. the resultant clone was designated as Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15. the resulting plasmid was digested with PmeI restriction enzyme. d against phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol. aliquots of virus were stored at 80\u00b0C until use. final aliquots of virus were determined by tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. the proteins were detected on the polyvinylidene fluoride membrane by staining with 3\u20323\u2032-diaminobenzidine tablets (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and staining was performed with HIV-1 gp41 monoclonal antibody (2F5) (11,000). colormetric reaction was performed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as recommended by the manufacturer. optical density at 405 nm (OD405nm) was determined with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) for the anti-MPER response ELISA plates were coated with 10 M of the MPER peptide (GenScript Co, Piscataway, NJ) in 100 l of 50 mM carbonate ( HEK293 cells were plated in 6-well plates at the density of 3105 cells per well 24 h before infection. cells were infected with Ads at 5 VPs/cell in 500 l growth medium containing 2% FBS. 1.5 ml more growth medium containing 10% FBS was then added into each well after 2 h incubation. eight serial dilutions of the virus ranging from 103 to 1010 or 106 to 1013 were made in medium containing 2% FBS depending on the virus. 100 l of each dilution was added into 96-well plates, one row for each dilution. mice at 6\u20138 weeks of age were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. 106 293AD cells were infected at 10 VP/cell with either AdCMVGag or Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) cells were permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Bioscience) cells were washed again and incubated with 110 diluted PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (BD Farmingen) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. one to two million lymphocytes were stained with or without Gag Tetramer (APC) and a cocktail of CD4-Alexa488 and CD8-PE antibodies (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, California) cell washed with 1%BSA, 2mM EDTA in PBS. analysis of 3,000 CD8 T cells was collected per sample. the gene was subcloned into an E1 shuttle vector under control of the CMV promoter. a control vector was generated, which contained an E1-deleted Ad5 genome expressing the Gag gene under the CMV promoter with no hexon modification (AdCMVGag) hexon specific PCR on the Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) construct revealed a 500 bp fragment, suggesting the expected insertion. both AdCMVGag and Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) were found to be positive in a Gag-specific PCR assay, producing a 1500 bp product. cell lysates were prepared 24 hours post-infection and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Gag-specific antibody. no Gag protein expression was detected in the lysates from cells infected with either hexon-modified Gag expressing vector. the arrow indicates MPER protein genetically incorporated into the hexon protein. purified unmodified Ad5, Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) or Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15E1 were subject to Western blot analysis with anti-gp41 antibody. the size of the 119 KDa band corresponds to the expected size of the Ad5 hexon protein with MPER peptide genetically incorporated into the HVR the reactive MPER epitope was properly exposed on the virion surfaces when incorporated in HVR2. binding was detected with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. our data suggest that the MPER epitope is presented within the hexon in its native conformation as it can be recognized by a monoclonal HIV neutralizing antibody. HEK293 cells were infected with the vectors respectively, at 5 VP/cell. cells were harvested with medium at different time points until full CPE was reached and total IFU were determined by TCID50. the thermostability assays are important due to the complex nature of the incorporated antigens. the sera were collected from mice for ELISA assays at various days after priming and boosting. purified MPER antigenic peptide was bound to ELISA plates. the plates were then incubated with the immunized mice sera. the binding was detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. the epitope inserted into the Ad5 hexon and the peptide were identical sequences with the 89.6 Env MPER region. there were no point mutations within the transgene expressed from the 89.6 HIV variant. -L15E1 and Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) vectors produced an isotype-specific anti-MPER humoral response in vaccinated mice. there was no isotype-specific response seen in vaccinated mice with Ad5, AdCMVGag or AdCMVEnv. the frequency of cells expressing Gag after infection with AdCMVGag or Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) was 81.8% and 80.6% respectively. the presence of the HIV-1 epitope did not alter neutralization by anti-Ad5 NAb present in the human ascites. therefore the HIV-1 epitope did not facilitate escape from pre-existing anti-adenoviral humoral immune response. hexon-modified vectors can induce a greater number of Gag-specific CD8 T cells and memory T cells than wild type vectors. hexon-modified vectors can induce a greater number of Gag-specific CD8 T cells and memory T cells. gag-specific CD8 T cells were detected in the peripheral blood of mice 2 weeks following the initial vaccination. they were given a boost immunization in the same manner on day 40. Flow cytometric analyses bivariate pseudocolor plots are shown for a single mouse. the HIV Gag gene is a major structural protein of the HIV virus. the gene was subcloned into an E1 shuttle vector under control of the CMV promoter. a control vector was generated, which contained an E1-deleted Ad5 genome. hexon-specific PCR was found to have a wild type hexon PCR profile producing 450 base pairs (bp) PCR fragment using the hexon-specific primers designed to amplify a regions between HVR2 and HVR5. both AdCMVGag and Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) were found to be positive in a Gag-specific PCR assay. expression and display of HIV antigens within adenoviral vectors. HEK293 cells were infected with unmodified Ad5 (as a negative control) or one of the HIV-Gag containing viruses (Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) or AdCMVGag, respectively. the proteins were separated on 4 to 15% polyacrylamide gradient SDS-PAGE gel. the arrow indicates MPER protein genetically incorporated into the hexon protein. the size of the 119 KDa band corresponds to the expected size of the hexon protein. the binding was detected with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. the binding was detected with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. PER-L15E1 was applied to ELISA plates, followed by the addition of serial dilutions of gp41 antibody. the anti-gp41 antibody bound to Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) and Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15E1 in a dose dependent manner. hexon-modified vectors were subject to heating at 45\u00b0C for various time points (0,5,10, 20 and 45 minutes) the viral infectious titers were re-determined after heating using TCID50 assays. the sera were collected from mice for ELISA assays at various days after priming and boosting. the binding was detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. adenovirus expressing capsid-incorporated HIV antigens elicit an HIV humoral immune response. adenovirus expressing capsid-incorporated HIV antigens elicit an HIV humoral immune response. purified MPER antigenic peptide was bound to ELISA plates. plates were then incubated with immunized mice sera followed by isotype specific antibodies. binding was detected with HRP conjugated secondary antibody. we compared infectivity of Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) to that of the original AdCMVGag virus. in the absence of ascites, the frequency of cells expressing Gag was 81.8% and 80.6% respectively. the presence of the HIV-1 epitope did not alter neutralization by anti-Ad5 NAb present in the human ascites. the previous experiments rely on the immune recognition of capsid proteins. they do not address the capacity of these modified vectors to transduce cells and direct expression of the delivered antigen-encoding transgenes in vivo. Cohorts of BALB/c mice (n = 8) were immunized (prime) by injection of 1010 vp i.m. with of one of the following Ad vectors: AdCMVGag, Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag), and Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15E1. Gag-specific T cells were detected in the peripheral blood of mice 2 weeks following the initial vaccination. in this study we successfully incorporated the HIV MPER in the Ad5 HVR2 region as evidenced by PCR, Western blot analysis, and the purified, whole-virus ELISAs. we performed additional ELISA experiments using purified gp41 protein and sera from our vaccinated mice. the results were similar to that seen with purified gp41 protein. we were able to detect the presence of MPER by the use of human HIV monoclonal antibody 4E10. this binds a 6 amino acid linear epitope immediately C-terminal to the 2F5 epitope and contained with MPER. this suggests that the non-glycosylated MPER may be more immunogenic because of the absence of glycan-shielding. vaccination with hexon-modified vectors in this study resulted in a humoral anti-HIV response. this is noteworthy, because HVR2 has not been fully explored for \u2018antigen capsid-incorporation\u2019 strategies. anti-MPER IgG1 and IgG2b isotype-specific responses were observed in mice vaccinated with the MPER capsid-modified vectors. similar results were seen with IgG2a, however; no MPER IgA-specific response was observed. we plan to further investigate IgA-specific response in the context of targeted hexon-modified vectors. if a monoclonal antibody was used in the presence of ascites fluid, Ad5/HVR2-MPER-L15(Gag) might escape neutralization largely as compared to AdCMVGag. this result was statistically significant at p0.03. this is an important finding for two reasons: (1) it indicates the potential for a second administration of the same vector without the diminished production of transgene. human rhinovirus (HRV) and Ad-based vector systems have been used to derive a HIV vaccine. researchers have constructed HRV:HIV chimeras in an effort to stimulate immunity against HIV-1. they have generated combinatorial libraries of HRV capid-incorporated gp41 epitope. previously mentioned development of mutagenic libraries of human rhinovirus 14 chimeras. each display randomized residues representing HIV-1 V3 or MPER epitopes. mutagenic libraries of human rhinovirus 14 chimeras have been developed. our future plans include transitioning these vectors to a 'gutless' [53]\u2013[57] system. in combination with the 'gutless system' we plan to decrease Ad5 PEI through the use of chemical conjugates such as polyethylene Glycol [58], [59] and/or Ad vector chimeras."}
