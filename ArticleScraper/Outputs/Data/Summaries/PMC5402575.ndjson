{"summary": "steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is the most common clinical nontraumatic ONFH. the matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (MMP/TIMP) system was found to play a significant role in the development of ONFH. genetic variants of MMP8 contribute to steroid-induced ONFH susceptibility. steroid-induced ONFH occurs in 39% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome within a few months of treatment with glucocorticoid therapy. a family of zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes are expressed by stromal cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, cancer cells, and osteoclasts. MMPs play central roles in morphogenesis, wound healing, tissue repair, and remodeling in response to injury. study aims to determine the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of the TIMP/MMP system and the risk of steroid-induced ONFH. study participants A total of 285 patients with steroid-induced ONFH were recruited between September 2014 and January 2016 at Zhengzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Traumatology Hospital. individuals with excessive use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, or significant familial hereditary disease were excluded. our study protocol adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. polymorphisms and the risk of steroid-induced ONFH were evaluated under different genetic models. a total of 285 patients were recruited between September 2014 and January 2016 at Zhengzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Traumatology Hospital. the controls did not have steroid-induced ONFH or other related diseases. individuals with excessive use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, or significant familial hereditary disease were excluded. informed consent was obtained from all candidates. allele and genotype frequencies among the cases and controls were calculated by chi-squared test/Fisher exact test. association between genotype polymorphisms and risk of steroid-induced ONFH was evaluated under different genetic models. allele frequencies in cases and controls and OR estimates for steroid-induced ONFH. rs1940475 significantly increased the risk of steroid-induced ONFH. rs2011390 showed a negative effect on steroid-induced ONFH. 4 SNPs of MMP8 (rs3740938, rs2012390, rs1940475, and rs11225395) had a negative effect on steroid-induced ONFH. in the stratified analysis, there was no association between rs3740938 or rs2012390 and the risk of steroid-induced ONFH among males. a total of 285 cases (112 females and 173 males) and 308 controls were recruited for our study. the mean age of the patients was 41.88 12.79 years and that of the controls was 49.47. the mean age between patients and controls was not matched in present study. the groups were well matched by sex (P = 0.413) the groups were well matched by sex (P = 0.413) 4 SNPs of MMP8 (rs3740938, rs2012390, rs1940475, and rs11225395) had a negative effect on steroid-induced ONFH. rs2012390 was found to be associated with an increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH. rs3740938, OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.50\u20134.83, P = 0.001; rs2012390, OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.31\u20134.03, P = 0.012) and the additive model (rs3740938, OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.24\u20133.29, P = 0.010; rs2012390, OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.12\u20132.80, P = we investigated the associations between 34 SNPs of the MMP/TIMP system and the risk of steroid-induced ONFH in the population of northern China. we found that gender differences might interact with MMP8 polymorphisms to affect the development of steroid-induced ONFH. of the 4 SNPs in MMP8 that were associated with increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH, rs3740938 and rs1940475 were located in exon coding regions. rs2012390 was located in an intron; rs11225395 was located in a promoter region. rs1940475 and rs11225395 polymorphisms have been reported to have an association with atherosclerosis. 1940475 and rs11225395 have a functional role in MMP8 expression. rs3740938, rs2012390, and rs1940475 showed a suggestive association with knee OA. rs1940475 showed a suggestive association with knee OA. 4 susceptive SNPs (rs3740938, rs2012390, rs1940475, and rs11225395) of MMP8 from the MMP/TIMP system exhibit a significant association with increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH. further functional studies and larger population-based studies are needed to confirm our results."}
