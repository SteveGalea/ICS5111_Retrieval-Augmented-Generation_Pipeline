{"summary": "despite widespread use of vaccines against them in breeding catteries, infections with these viruses are still common. despite widespread use of vaccines against them in breeding catteries, infections with these viruses are still common, especially when cats are kept in groups. despite routine vaccination, the numbers of cats with URTD referred to veterinary clinics are increasing. despite routine vaccination, the numbers of cats with URTD referred to veterinary clinics are increasing. 300 L of PBS containing virus samples and 500 L lysis buffer were mixed by vortex. samples were incubated at 55 C for 10 min and centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. a volume of 8 L RNA, 1 L random hexamer primer (50 ng concentrations) and 1 L dNTP mix (10 mM) were mixed and incubate in 65 C for 5 min. 0.5 L M-MuLV reverse transcriptase enzyme (100 unit) and 2.5 L of 10X Buffer M-MulV and 7.5 L nuclease-free water were added. reactions were subjected to 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 C, 1 min at 53 C and 1min at 72 C and final extension of 7 min at 72 C. each 15 L of reaction products was electrophoresed through a 1.50% agarose gel and were stained with ethidium bromide. prevalence was higher for FCV (100%) than for FHV-1 (43.00%) in clinically normal cats. prevalence rate of co-infection in both viruses was 30.00% totally (in sick and healthy animals), which just half showed clinical disease. es Healthy cats (%) Cats with URTD (%) FHV-1 and FCV 23.00 43.00 FIV and FeLV 42.00 87.00 FHV-1, FCV, FIV, FeLV 11.00 43.00 Also, prevalence rate of FIV and FeLV infections in cats with URTD (87.00% and 93.00%, respectively) male and outdoor cats were more infected than female and indoors. PCR and RT-PCR assays were used to detect FHV-1 and FCV infections using the PCR methods developed by Sykes et al. and Scansen et al. in cats with URTD was higher than FHV (43.00%) that is in agree-ment with other reports. high prevalence of FCV may relate to high resistance of Calicivirus in environment. the infections in healthy cats and cats with URTD have been reported 0 to 2.00% and 6.5 to 7.50% in Australia, 2.90% and 9.80% in Japan, 3.60% and 3.20% in Germany, respectively and 64.00% (FIV) in Iran. the infections are declining in most parts of the world due to prevention and vaccination programs. FIV was detected in 87.50% and FeLV in all cats showing stomatitis. a study in western canada showed oral diseases were significantly associated with FIV positivity. cats which are negative for FHV-1 should be sampled periodically. it seems that FCV and FHV-1 infection rates are higher in infected cats."}
