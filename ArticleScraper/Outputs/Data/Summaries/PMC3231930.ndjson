{"summary": "administration of therapeutic molecules via mucosal routes is a very efficient prophylactic and therapeutic strategy. mucosal immunisation is more easily performed, without the need for needles and syringes, thereby eliminating the requirement for trained personnel. lactic acid bacteria (LAB), notably lactococci and lactobacilli, are excellent candidates as delivery vectors of therapeutic proteins. several detailed reviews of vector delivery strategies, based on LAB, have been published within the last five years. we will be summarizing our current research and advances on the use of lactococci and lactobacilli as live delivery vectors of proteins with health interest. the use of LAB as DNA-vaccine-delivery vehicles to deliver DNA directly to antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. several studies have compared the production of different antigens in LAB. the highest immune response was usually obtained with cell wall anchored antigens exposed to the surface of LAB. lactis is considered to be a good candidate for heterologous protein production. the nisin inducible promoter (PnisA) is the major element of the NICE (Nisin Induced Controlled Expression) system. the nisA gene encodes for the structural nisin gene, whereas nisRK encodes for the dual-component system responsible for the induction of other genes within the cluster. pSEC:LEISS contains a synthetic propeptide identified as a production-secretion booster. these vectors have been successfully used to produce approximately 50 different heterologous proteins in L. lactis up to date. more recently, we also developed a new bile salts-inducible promoter, which is currently being tested in in vivo experiments. tis as a mucosal vaccine was performed with killed recombinant lactococci producing a cell wall-attached form of a protective antigen (PAc) recombinant strains developed PAc-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies. these results demonstrated, for the first time, that L. lactis can efficiently present an antigen to the immune system. the intracellular production of E7 antigen led to its rapid degradation in the cytoplasm of L. lactis, even when produced in a protease-free clpP strain. antigen-specific humoral (production of E7 antibodies) and cellular (secretion of IL-2 and IFN-cytokines) responses were observed after intranasal administration of recombinant lactococci expressing E7 as a cell wall-anchored form. use of recombinant lactococci in cow\u2019s milk allergy model. CMA develops early in infancy within 12 to 24 months of birth. 80-90% of affected children recover by acquiring tolerance to cow\u2019s milk by age of 5 years. intranasal pre-treatment of mice with LL-BLG reduced airway eosinophilia influx. intranasal administration of recombinant strain elicited a protective Th1 immune-response, inhibiting the allergic response in mice without affecting specific BLG IgE secretion. leptin inhibits food intake and stimulates energy expenditure to control body weight. a significant reduction of body weight was only observed if serum leptin concentrations were 20- to 30-fold higher than normal physiological levels. this poor response was attributed in part to insufficient transport of leptin across the blood brain barrier in obese patients. the adaptive immune response was significantly higher than in mice immunized with LL-E7 only, demonstrating the adjuvanticity of leptin. we then analyzed the effect of daily intranasal administration of LL-LEP in ob/ob mice. this treatment induced a significant reduction in body weight gain and food intake. recombinant strain of lactobacillus casei capable of producing BLG. intranasal pre-administration of the recombinant strain led to inhibition of BLG-specific IgE production in sensitized mice. recombinant LAB may be critical for immunomodulatory properties. the two most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, which are associated with an influx of neutrophils and macrophages. the two most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, which are associated with an influx of neutrophils and macrophages. LAB, such as lactobacilli, may play a preventative role in IBD. we then cloned MnSOD from lactococcus lactis into Lb. casei BL23. we then compared the effect of intragastric administration of Lb. casei BL23 MnSOD alone or in combination with Lb. casei BL23 MnCAT. however, there was no improvement in inflammation reduction with the administration of Lb. casei BL23 MnSOD alone. delivery of DNA vaccines leads to the expression of post-translationally modified antigens by host cells. the use of food-grade lactococci and lactobacilli as DNA delivery vehicles is a promising alternative to attenuated pathogens. no BLG was detected 6 days after the last oral administration. in situ production elicits a specific immune response protecting the mice from further sensitization with cow\u2019s milk proteins. invasion of the host cell is a limiting step to achieve efficient DNA vaccine delivery efficiency. eGFP expression plasmid delivery into guinea pig enterocytes. in vivo, L. lactis InlA+ invaded guinea pig enterocytes after oral administration. lactic acid bacteria as mucosal delivery vectors of antigens and cytokines. lactis is the most widely used LAB in the production of fermented milk products. the most commonly used laboratory L. lactis strain (MG1363) is plasmid-free and does not produce any extracellular proteases. nisA gene encodes for the structural nisin gene, whereas nisRK encodes for the dual-component system responsible for the induction of other genes within the cluster. all of our genes of interest were cloned downstream of PnisA and the resulting plasmid was introduced in L. lactis. have been successfully used to produce approximately 50 different heterologous proteins in L. lactis up to date. we also developed a new bile salts-inducible promoter, which is currently being tested in in vivo experiments. the secretion machinery for L. lactis has also been complemented with B. subtilis SecDF. nisin inducible promoter (PnisA) is the major element of the NICE (Nisin Induced Controlled Expression) system. nisRK encodes for the structural nisin gene, whereas nisRK encodes for the dual-component system responsible for the induction of other genes. pCYT, pSEC, and pCWA were developed to allow protein targeting to be either intracellular, secreted, or cell wall anchored. we also constructed a fourth expression vector called pSEC:LEISS. these vectors have been successfully used to produce approximately 50 different heterologous proteins in L. lactis up to date. more recently, we also developed a new bile salts-inducible promoter. a number of studies support the use of recombinant L. lactis to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses against a desired antigen. in 1990, the first attempt to use L. lactis as a mucosal vaccine was performed with killed recombinant lactococci producing a cell wall-attached form of a Streptococcus mutans protective antigen (PAc) these results demonstrated, for the first time, that L. recombinant recombinant lactis producing human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen. the viral protein is considered as a major candidate antigen for vaccines against HPV-related cervical cancer, the second cause of cancer death in women. more than 50 peer-reviewed publications have validated this potential. use of recombinant lactococci as mucosal vaccines continues to grow. recombinant lactococci is the most common allergy in young infants. the intensity of the Th1 immune response induced correlate with the amount of recombinant BLG produced. the most effective strains were those producing the highest amount of BLG. intranasal pre-treatment of mice with LL-BLG reduced airway eosinophilia influx and IL-5 secretion in broncoalveolar lavage. kDa protein encoded by the obese (ob) gene is an adipocyte-derived pleiotropic hormone that modulates a large number of physiological functions. leptin inhibits food intake and stimulates energy expenditure to control body weight. leptin treatment induced remarkable weight-loss in patients with rare congenital leptin deficiency. the adaptive immune response was significantly higher in mice immunized intranasally with LL-LEP and LL-E7. the adaptive immune response was significantly higher than in mice immunized with LL-E7 only, demonstrating the adjuvanticity of leptin. LL-LEP strain regulated in vivo antigen-specific immune responses, as well as body weight and food consumption. studies analyzing expression of viral, bacterial or eukaryotic origin proteins in Lb. plantarum and Lb. casei have been conducted. use of recombinant Lb. casei in cow\u2019s milk allergy model. recombinant LAB may be critical for immunomodulatory properties. a recombinant Lb. casei BL23 strain can attenuate moderate Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) induced colitis in mice orally pretreated. BL23 strain producing manganese CAT (MnCAT) did not improve the protective effect of inflammation reduction. other recent studies have successfully reported the use of either recombinant Lb. gasseri or Lb. plantarum strains to produce and deliver in situ biologically active manganese SOD (MnSOD) to treat colitis. use of recombinant lactococci in cow\u2019s milk allergy model is a complex disorder. CMA develops early in infancy within 12-24 months of birth. 80-90% of affected children recover by acquiring tolerance to cow\u2019s milk by the age of 5 years. intranasal pre-treatment of mice with LL-BLG reduced airway eosinophilia influx and IL-5 secretion in broncoalveolar lavage. intranasal administration of recombinant strain reduced IgG1 production but did not influence specific BLG IgE or IgG2a secretion. leptin inhibits food intake and stimulates energy expenditure to control body weight. a reduction of body weight was only observed if serum leptin concentrations were 20- to 30-fold higher than normal physiological levels. this poor response was attributed in part to insufficient transport of leptin across the blood brain barrier in obese patients. the adaptive immune response was significantly higher than in mice immunized with LL-E7 only, demonstrating the adjuvanticity of leptin. we then analyzed the effect of daily intranasal administration of LL-LEP in ob/ob mice. this treatment induced a significant reduction in body weight gain and food intake. recombinant strain of lactobacillus casei produces recombinant Lb. plantarum. recombinant strain of lactobacillus casei is capable of producing BLG. recombinant lactobacillus casei is capable of producing BLG. the two most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, which are associated with an influx of neutrophils and macrophages. the two most common forms of IBD are Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, which are associated with an influx of neutrophils and macrophages. LAB, such as lactobacilli, may play a preventative role in IBD. a significant reduction of caecal and colonic inflammation was observed with either administration of Lb. casei BL23 MnSOD alone or in combination with Lb. casei BL23 MnCAT alone. however, there was no improvement in inflammation reduction with the administration of Lb. casei BL23 MnSOD as compared to administering Lb. casei BL23 MnSOD alone. L. lactis strains have been used to deliver an expression cassette encoding BLG cDNA into the Caco-2 epithelial cell line. no production of BLG was observed when Caco-2 cells were co-incubated with purified plasmid alone or mixed with L. lactis. no BLG was detected 6 days after the last oral administration. in situ production elicits a specific immune response protecting the mice from further sensitization with cow\u2019s milk proteins. invasion of the host cell is a limiting step to achieve efficient DNA vaccine delivery efficiency. in vivo, L. lactis InlA+ was able to invade guinea pig enterocytes after oral administration. no BLG was detected 6 days after the last oral administration. no BLG was detected 6 days after the last oral administration. ized pre-treated mice, IgE and IL-5 concentrations decreased by 70 and 40%. splenocytes from pre-treated mice secreted IFN- after BLG specific re-activation. invasion of the host cell is a limiting step to achieve efficient DNA vaccine delivery efficiency. a biocontainment strategy to prevent the dissemination in the environment of these genetically modified LAB should be developed before they can be used in humans. the chromosomal thymidylate synthase (IL-10) gene was replaced by the gene encoding for IL-10 to generate a thymidine auxotroph phenotype. in the absence of thymidine or thymine, the viability of the thyA LL- the results did not reveal a statistically significant difference in mucosal healing versus placebo. the authors of this pioneering human clinical trial and other teams involved in this promising field should now consider the optimization of some aspects of their LAB delivery strategy."}
