{"summary": "infected chickens are highly susceptible to infection between 3 and 6 weeks after hatching. surviving chicks present severe immunosuppression and unresponsive to vaccination against other pathogens. virus causes acute local infection, which peaks at between 2 and 5 days postinfection. secreted IFN- could in turn activate macrophages, leading to the production of proinflammatory factors, e.g., nitric oxide and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which can contribute to tissue damage. apoptosis of IBDV-infected cells, both in vivo, in bursal, thymic, and splenic cells has also been documented. apoptosis in bursal lymphocytes and thymic cells lacking detectable levels of IBDV proteins has also been documented. viral polypeptides VP5, VP3, and VP2 have been linked to the induction and/or control of the IBDV-induced apoptosis at the early stage of virus infection. VP5 may play a dual role, preventing IBDV-induced apoptosis at the early stage of virus infection (31) and also acting as a proapoptotic polypeptide to facilitate virus dissemination (32). proteins implicated in apoptosis are tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), Fas-FasL, the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and the 2\u2032-5\u2032A-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) there is also a growing body of information that points to detrimental effects of type I IFNs on heLa cells were pretreated with increasing amounts of human IFN- (hIFN-) for 16 h before infection. infections were performed by using two multiplicities of infection (MOIs), 0.05 and 2 PFU/cell. cultures were harvested at 24 h p.i. bars indicate means standard deviations based on duplicate samples from two independent experiments. to investigate whether the virus counteracts the antiviral activity triggered by IFN once infection has been established, we performed a different set of experiments. the rate of cell death was markedly higher when IFN was added at an early time p.i. (I+3) than when it was added at a late time (I+12). Morphological changes observed in IFN-treated infected cells were reminiscent of those occurring during apoptosis. IFN treatment triggers apoptosis of IBDV-infected HeLa cells. cells mock infected or infected with IBDV were treated with hIFN- (1,000 IU/ml) at 3, 6, 9, or 12 h p.i. caspase values from infected cell samples were normalized to those from mock-infected cells. bars indicate means standard deviations based on duplicate samples from two independent experiments. we analyzed the effect of IBDV infection on the expression of several ISGs after treatment with hIFN- by Western blotting. for this, HeLa cells infected with IBDV (MOI of 2) were treated with 1,000 IU/ml of hIFN- at different times p.i. the addition of IFN at 3 h p.i. caused a minor reduction (2-fold) in the production of extracellular virus, which was not statistically significant. PKR is a crucial protein in the apoptosis pathway triggered by IFN- in IBDV-infected HeLa cells. PKR silencing also caused a significant reduction of the extent of PARP cleavage triggered by IFN treatment. ml of hIFN- at 3, 6, 9, or 12 h p.i. (samples named M+3, M+6, M+9, and M+12 and I+6, I+9, and I+12, respectively, throughout the text) cells were analyzed at 24 h p.i. (samples named M+3, M+6, M+9, and M+12, respectively, throughout the text) a conspicuous absence of phosphorylated eIF2 was observed in PKR-silenced cells. PKR is responsible for the phosphorylation observed in both wild-type and silencing control HeLa cells. the results indicate that PKR is responsible for the eIF2 phosphorylation observed in both wild-type and silencing control HeLa cells. h p.i. Mock-infected (M and M+3) and IBDV-infected (I and I+3) cells were harvested at 24 h p.i. and subjected to RNA extraction. expression levels of each cellular target gene were normalized to the HPRT mRNA content. bars indicate means standard deviation based on data for triplicate samples. ISG-56 and Mx expression levels were enhanced by about 10-fold in PKR-silenced cells with respect to infected control cells. we also analyzed the expression levels of different apoptosis-related genes, namely, BAK, FAS, TRAIL, TNFA, and BCL2. the next step in our research was to silence TNF- expression in HeLa cells. TNFA expression levels were reduced up to 81% and 79% in cells transduced with the shRNA TNF- 1 lentivirus (sh1) and sh4, respectively. a moderate reduction in TNF- expression (ca. 50%) was observed with the other three constructs. h to induce TNF- gene expression, and levels of TNF- mRNA were determined by RT-qPCR. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data from triplicate samples. apoptosis enhancement during IBDV infection in cells treated with IFN-infected cells correlate with increasing levels of PKR phosphorylation and upregulation of IFN- gene expression. a gradual increase in PARP cleavage was observed over time in I+3 samples. in mock-infected cells, either M or M+3, only a negligible band corresponding to cleaved PARP could be observed. in I+3 cells, there was an increase of apoptosis from 12 h p.i. until the end of the experiment. cells treated with hIFN- were treated or not with 7DMA (0.2 mM) after virus adsorption. cells were treated or not with 7DMA (0.2 mM) after virus adsorption. expression levels of the selected genes were determined by RT-qPCR. a gradual increase in PKR phosphorylation was observed in I+3 cells. the level of PKR phosphorylation was much lower than that in I+3 cells. to monitor virus infection, we analyzed the expression of the VP3 protein by Western blotting. -specific RNA level, reaching a plateau at 18 h p.i., was detected in I cells. there was only an minor, although statistically significant, increase of 1 log in I+3 cells at between 4 and 12 h p.i., which reached maximum values at 24 h p.i., ca. 8-fold lower than those observed for untreated cells. the production of extracellular virus was significantly reduced in IFN-treated cells. IBDV-infected cells were mock treated or treated with 7DMA. cells were harvested at 1, 4, and 24 h p.i. for RNA extraction. one set of cells from each group, treated and not with 7DMA, was treated with IFN at 3 h p.i. and harvested at 24 h p.i. PKR and TNF- appear to play a key role in the induction of apoptosis. for this, cells were infected with IBDV and treated with IFN at 3 h p.i. samples were harvested at 1-h intervals starting from 12 to 15 h p.i. and at 3-h intervals from 15 to 22 h p.i. each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with serum anti-p65. the Western blots corresponding to histone H2B and -tubulin were used as protein loading controls for nuclear and cytosolic fractions. NF-B activation is essential for triggering apoptosis. a significant reduction of caspase activity was observed in I+3 cells. the results indicate that NF-B activation plays an important role in the triggering of apoptosis by IFN in IBDV-infected cells. antibodies against -tubulin and H2B were used as cell fractionation controls. the amount of p65 in the cytosolic fraction was enhanced in cells treated with both inhibitors. however, IB degradation was prevented in cells treated with both inhibitors. a significant reduction in caspase activity was observed in the I+3 samples treated with both NF-B activation inhibitors compared with mock-treated cells. a minor reduction was also seen in the I samples treated with the inhibitors. these results confirm the involvement of the NF-B pathway in the triggering of apoptosis by IFN in IBDV-infected cells. caspase values for infected cells were normalized to those for mock-infected cells. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data from duplicate samples. apoptosis-triggering mechanism in IBDV-infected cells treated with hIFN- was measured at 14 h p.i. cells were either transfected with purified genomic dsRNA or incubated with purified IBDV virus-like particles (VLPs) after 3 h, cultures were treated with hIFN- (1,000 IU/ml) and then harvested 21 h later. apoptotic cell death was measured by using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data from duplicate samples. all the experiments described in this report were performed with the Soroa strain of IBDV. cells were infected with different strains of IBDV (MOI of 2), soroa, P2, or Bursine. they were treated with hIFN- (1,000 IU/ml) at 3 h p.i., and collected at 24 h p.i. for western blot and caspase 3/7 activity analyses. antibodies to -actin were used for a protein loading control. apoptosis was measured from duplicate samples using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data for duplicate samples. caspase activity in DF-1 cells was significantly higher in the I+3 samples than in the M, M+3 or I samples. DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV (MOI of 2) and treated or not with 1,000 U/ml of chIFN- at 3 h p.i. samples were analyzed to determine caspase 3/7 activity. IBDV is sensitive to the antiviral action of IFN- in HeLa cells. heLa cells were pretreated with increasing amounts of human IFN- (hIFN-), ranging from 1 to 1,000 IU/ml, for 16 h before infection. pretreated with different doses of hIFN- (0, 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 IU/ml), as indicated, for 16 h before infection with two MOIs of IBDV, 0.05 or 2 PFU/cell. both the culture medium and infected cells were harvested at 24 h p.i. infected cells treated with IFN showed a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) not observed in either infected cells without IFN or mock-infected cells treated with IFN. the rate of cell death was markedly higher when IFN was added at an early time p.i. (I+3) than when it was added at a late time (I+12). lo 3/7 assay kit used different amounts of hIFN-, ranging from 1 to 105 IU. extents of apoptotic cell death at 24 h p.i. were similar in samples treated with doses of >100 IU/ml. hIFN- at the indicated times p.i. with different antibodies: anti-PARP, anti-total PKR (t-PKR), anti-phosphorylated (Thr446) PKR (p-PKR), anti-total eIF2 (t-eIF2), anti-Mx, anti-ISG-56, and anti-VP3. IFN treatment of IBDV-infected cells triggers a massive apoptosis. extent of cell death is significantly greater when IFN is added early during the infection cycle. the Mx and ISG-56 proteins showed similar patterns of expression in mock-infected and infected cells treated with IFN. for both proteins, there were higher levels of accumulation in the I+3 and I+6 than in the I+9 or I+12 samples. the addition of IFN at early times p.i. resulted in a major reduction of VP3 expression. treatment with IFN after IBDV infection did not cause drastic morphological changes or the mortality observed in wild-type or silencing control cells. PKR silencing also caused a significant reduction of the extent of PARP cleavage triggered by IFN treatment. apoptosis was measured for duplicate samples by using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit. apoptosis was quantified using the caspase 3/7 assay. we found a drastic reduction of this activity in PKR-silenced cells. a conspicuous absence of phosphorylated eIF2 was observed in PKR-silenced cells. cells were harvested at 24 h p.i. for RNA extraction. purified RNAs were then analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. the results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 4. level of IFNB gene expression was significantly lower in I+3 samples from PKR-silenced cells than in either M or M+3 cell samples. however, Mx, ISG-15, and ISG-56 gene expressions were induced by IFN treatment to similar levels in infected and mock-infected cells. intriguingly, ISG-56 and Mx expression levels were enhanced by about 10-fold in PKR-silenced cells with respect to inf we were keen to assess the possible role of TNF- in the generalized apoptosis observed in IBDV-infected cells. for this, we generated lentiviral particles expressing five short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting human TNFA. effects of TNF- knockdown on apoptosis by IFN in IBDV-infected HeLa cells. cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing shC, sh1 and sh4. at 4 days p.t. (A) and 12 days p.t. (B), cells were transfected with poly(IC) for 16 h to induce TNF- gene expression. infected cell samples were normalized to those for mock-infected cells. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data from duplicate samples. in mock-infected cells, either M or M+3, only a negligible band corresponding to cleaved PARP could be observed. the gradual increase in apoptosis observed in I+3 cell samples was confirmed by real-time quantitative cell death analysis. Western blot analysis of total cell extracts with anti-PARP, anti-t-PKR, anti-p-PKR, and anti-VP3 antibodies was used as a protein loading control. the Western blot corresponding to -actin was used as a protein loading control. the caspase values for infected cell samples were normalized to those for mock-infected cells. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data from duplicate samples. a gradual increase in PKR phosphorylation was observed in I+3 cells. cell samples were harvested at 3-h intervals from 4 to 24 h p.i. a progressive upregulation of IFNB transcription was observed in I+3 cells. a modest increase in IFNB gene expression (2-fold) was detected in I and M+3 samples harvested at 24 h p.i. dsRNA produced by a polymerase inhibitor, 7-deaza-2\u2032-C-methyladenosine (7DMA) could be the trigger of the massive apoptotic response. first, heLa cells were treated with different doses of 7DMA (0.05 to 2 mM), and a toxicity assay was performed to determine the highest dose of the drug that could be used without compromising cell viability. from this assay, the 0.2 mM dose was a significant reduction in apoptosis in the I+3 samples. a slight reduction was also observed for the samples not treated with IFN. NF-B activation upon treatment with IFN in IBDV-infected HeLa cells. each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with serum anti-p65. MG132 blocks proteolytic activity of the proteasome and NF-B. accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins did not have a significant effect on cell viability (5%). cultures were harvested at 16, 18, and 20 h p.i., when activation of NF-B was previously detected. however, cytoplasmic NF-B levels remained unchanged in all cases. we wished to confirm the effectiveness of the treatments in our HeLa cell system. for this, HeLa cells were treated with the selected doses, 50 and 25 M SC-514 and JSH-23, respectively, or with the solvent DMSO as a control during 2 h, followed by treatment with 20 ng/ml of TNF- during 30 min. then, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p65 and anti a reduction in caspase activity was observed in the I+3 samples treated with both NF-B activation inhibitors compared with mock-treated cells. a minor reduction was also seen in the I samples treated with the inhibitors. this confirms the involvement of the NF-B pathway in triggering of apoptosis by IFN in IBDV-infected cells. Western blot analysis of p65 in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions. samples were subjected to subcellular fractionation. each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with serum anti-p65. IBDV-infected HeLa cells treated with IFN at 3 h p.i. (I+3) were treated with SC-514, JSH-23 (50 and 25 M, respectively), or DMSO as a control ( at 14 h p.i.) nuclear and cytosolic fractions were analyzed by using antibodies against p65, IB, and VP3. some caspase 3/7 activity was detected in cells transfected with viral dsRNA (R) however, the activity was significantly higher when cells were treated with IFN (R+3). incubation of cells with IBDV VLPs did not elicit an apoptotic response. these results suggest that genomic IBDV dsRNA might be the viral component that contributes to this effect. IFN- treatment of HeLa cells infected with different strains of IBDV also causes apoptosis. cells were treated with hIFN- (1,000 IU/ml) at 3 h p.i. and collected at 24 h p.i. IFN treatment triggers apoptosis of HeLa cells infected with different strains of IBDV. cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml of hIFN- at 3 h p.i. (M+3 and I+3, respectively), as indicated, or remained untreated. chicken DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV (Soroa strain) at an MOI of 2. cells were treated or not with 1,000 U/ml of chIFN- at 3 h p.i. treatment with IFN also exacerbated the CPE caused by IBDV. cells were incubated with the incuCyte caspase 3/7 apoptosis assay reagent. images were recorded with an incuCyte Zoom system apparatus at 16 h p.i. DF-1 cells were treated with different doses of staurosporine. IFNs promote selective induction of apoptosis in cells infected with a variety of viruses, thereby limiting virus spread (35, 54, 55) the potential contribution of IFN to IBDV pathogenesis has not been addressed. the apoptosis of infected cells can be considered a protective mechanism limiting virus spread. however, there are some well-documented examples evidencing that this phenomenon might also contribute to virus-induced pathogenesis. PKR activation correlated directly with the phosphorylation of eIF2, its best-characterized substrate, and with a significant reduction of VP3 accumulation. the extent of PKR activation also correlated positively with the magnitude of the apoptotic response. PKR is involved in apoptosis induction by different mechanisms (42, 63) we observed a higher level of IFNB induction in infected cells treated with IFN at 3 h p.i. than in PKR-silenced cells. this increase correlated positively with PKR activation in HeLa control cells. progressive IFNB induction was observed at later times after IBDV infection. dsRNA shields the virus genome from host RNA sensors, thus preventing apoptosis. a stoichiometric analysis of IBDV structural components showed that infectious IBDV particles harbor four dsRNA genome segments associated (in form of RNPs) with ca. 450 VP3 molecules (19) dsRNA complexes are poorly stable over time and highly dependent upon the VP3 concentration. viral dsRNA transfected into cells would not exactly mimic the IBDV genome in the context of an infection, where the dsRNA is structured in RNPs, being complexed to VP3 and the RNA polymerase VP1. the first signs of apoptosis are detected between 12 and 15 h p.i. blocking viral RNA replication/transcription with the RNA polymerase inhibitor 7DMA drastically reduced the extent of apoptosis in TNFA upregulation did not occur in PKR knockdown cells. TNF- would then act downstream in the PKR-related apoptotic pathway. similar situation has been described for severe acute respiratory syndrome. the well-known feedback mechanism between TNF- and NF-B (74) seems to operate during the development of apoptosis in cells treated with IFN-. but the activation of NF-B alone is not sufficient for cell killing, requiring further signals to trigger the apoptotic route (76) the effect of IFN on IPNV replication was moderate when IFN was added after infection (4 or 10 h p.i.) compared with IFN pretreatment. the study also showed that Mx expression induced by IFN treatment was reduced in cells previously infected with IPNV. this indicates that some viral products interfere with ISG expression. human immunodeficiency virus (78), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (79, 80), classical swine fever virus (81, 80), avian influenza virus (58), and SARS coronavirus (57) are examples of this direct relationship between the type I IFN response and the clinical outcome of viral infection. we have contributed for the first time to elucidating a potential mechanism driving the apoptotic death of IBDV-inf apoptosis of infected cells can be considered a protective mechanism limiting virus spread. but there are some well-documented examples evidencing that this phenomenon might also contribute to virus-induced pathogenesis. PKR activation correlated directly with the phosphorylation of eIF2, its best-characterized substrate, and with a significant reduction of VP3 accumulation. the extent of PKR activation also correlated positively with the magnitude of the apoptotic response. PKR is involved in apoptosis induction by different mechanisms. we observed a higher level of IFNB induction in infected cells treated with IFN at 3 h p.i. than in PKR-silenced cells. this increase correlated positively with PKR activation in d and wild-type control cells. however, progressive IFNB induction was observed at later times after IBDV infection. a stoichiometric analysis of IBDV structural components showed that infectious IBDV particles harbor four dsRNA genome segments associated with ca. 450 VP3 molecules. this is consistent with the notion that the binding of VP3 to IBDV dsRNA shields the virus genome from host RNA sensors, thus preventing PKR-mediated apoptosis. nude viral dsRNA transfected into cells would not exactly mimic the IBDV genome in the context of an infection. the first signs of apoptosis are detected between 12 and 15 h p.i. blocking viral RNA replication/transcription with the RNA polymerase inhibitor 7DMA drastically reduced the extent of apoptosis in infected cells treated with IFN. infected cells treated with IFN could be primed to undergo apoptosis through TNF- but not via TRAIL or Fas signaling. TNFA upregulation did not occur in PKR knockdown cells; TNF- would then act downstream in the PKR-related apoptotic pathway, mediating the clearance of IBDV-infected cells. the well-known feedback mechanism between TNF- and NF-B (74) seems to operate during the development of apoptosis in cells infected with IBDV and treated with IFN. however, the activation of NF-B alone is not sufficient for cell killing, requiring further signals to trigger the apoptotic route (76). similar experiments have been carried out with IPNV, another birnavirus (77) the effect of IFN on IPNV replication was moderate when IFN was added after infection (4 or 10 h p.i.) compared with IFN pretreatment, it also showed that Mx expression induced by IFN treatment was reduced in cells previously infected with IPNV. human immunodeficiency virus (78), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (79, 80), classical swine fever virus (81), avian influenza virus (58), and SARS coronavirus (57) are examples of this direct relationship between the type I IFN response and the rigor of the clinical outcome of viral infection. the cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% chicken fetal serum (Sigma-Aldrich) these cells were deficient in PKR (HeLa PKR silenced) and control cells (HeLa control), stably expressing an shRNA targeting the PKR gene and a scrambled shRNA, respectively, were generated. mock- or IBDV-infected cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml of IFN- at the indicated times p.i. samples from mock-infected cells (M) treated with IFN are denoted M+3 and M+6, etc., where the number indicates the time in hours p.i. at which IFN was added to the culture. the clarified supernatant was incubated with the resin for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. after several washes with 50 mM Tris-HCl, the protein was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) chIFN- was titrated according to procedures described previously by Schwarz and coworkers. the live/dead cell imaging kit was used to discriminate live from dead cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. at the specified times p.i., an equal volume of the reagent was added to HeLa cell monolayers grown in 24-well plates. yl sulfate [SDS], 0.01% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 5% -mercaptoethanol were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. immunoblots were incubated with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS] containing 0.05% Tween 20 [TBST] and 5% nonfat dry milk) a goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) or a goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction (GE Healthcare) cell monolayers grown in 24-well plates were infected and treated in duplicate. gene expression levels were normalized to the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 gene. the results were calculated as fold changes in gene expression relative to mock-infected cells. plasmid pLKO.1-Puro with a U6 promoter was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. the successful 21-nucleotide human TNF- targeting sequence was GCAGGTCTACTTTGGGATCAT (sh4) cells were infected with VT7LacOI/POLY at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell. cells were collected and used to purify VLPs by ultracentrifugation. dsRNA was extracted from preparations of sucrose gradient-purified IBDV. nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared from HeLa cells grown in 24-well plates and treated under different experimental conditions by using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents.

PKR and TNF- appear to play a key role in the induction of apoptosis. for this, cells were infected with IBDV and treated with IFN at 3 h p.i. samples were harvested at 1-h intervals starting from 12 to 15 h p.i. and at 3-h intervals from 15 to 22 h p.i. each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with serum anti-p65. the Western blots corresponding to histone H2B and -tubulin were used as protein loading controls for nuclear and cytosolic fractions. NF-B activation is essential for triggering apoptosis. a significant reduction of caspase activity was observed in I+3 cells. the results indicate that NF-B activation plays an important role in the triggering of apoptosis by IFN in IBDV-infected cells. antibodies against -tubulin and H2B were used as cell fractionation controls. the amount of p65 in the cytosolic fraction was enhanced in cells treated with both inhibitors. however, IB degradation was prevented in cells treated with both inhibitors. a significant reduction in caspase activity was observed in the I+3 samples treated with both NF-B activation inhibitors compared with mock-treated cells. a minor reduction was also seen in the I samples treated with the inhibitors. these results confirm the involvement of the NF-B pathway in the triggering of apoptosis by IFN in IBDV-infected cells. caspase values for infected cells were normalized to those for mock-infected cells. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data from duplicate samples. apoptosis-triggering mechanism in IBDV-infected cells treated with hIFN- was measured at 14 h p.i. cells were either transfected with purified genomic dsRNA or incubated with purified IBDV virus-like particles (VLPs) after 3 h, cultures were treated with hIFN- (1,000 IU/ml) and then harvested 21 h later. apoptotic cell death was measured by using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data from duplicate samples. all the experiments described in this report were performed with the Soroa strain of IBDV. cells were infected with different strains of IBDV (MOI of 2), soroa, P2, or Bursine. they were treated with hIFN- (1,000 IU/ml) at 3 h p.i., and collected at 24 h p.i. for western blot and caspase 3/7 activity analyses. antibodies to -actin were used for a protein loading control. apoptosis was measured from duplicate samples using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data for duplicate samples. caspase activity in DF-1 cells was significantly higher in the I+3 samples than in the M, M+3 or I samples. DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV (MOI of 2) and treated or not with 1,000 U/ml of chIFN- at 3 h p.i. samples were analyzed to determine caspase 3/7 activity. IBDV is sensitive to the antiviral action of IFN- in HeLa cells. heLa cells were pretreated with increasing amounts of human IFN- (hIFN-), ranging from 1 to 1,000 IU/ml, for 16 h before infection. pretreated with different doses of hIFN- (0, 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 IU/ml), as indicated, for 16 h before infection with two MOIs of IBDV, 0.05 or 2 PFU/cell. both the culture medium and infected cells were harvested at 24 h p.i. infected cells treated with IFN showed a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) not observed in either infected cells without IFN or mock-infected cells treated with IFN. the rate of cell death was markedly higher when IFN was added at an early time p.i. (I+3) than when it was added at a late time (I+12). lo 3/7 assay kit used different amounts of hIFN-, ranging from 1 to 105 IU. extents of apoptotic cell death at 24 h p.i. were similar in samples treated with doses of >100 IU/ml. hIFN- at the indicated times p.i. with different antibodies: anti-PARP, anti-total PKR (t-PKR), anti-phosphorylated (Thr446) PKR (p-PKR), anti-total eIF2 (t-eIF2), anti-Mx, anti-ISG-56, and anti-VP3. IFN treatment of IBDV-infected cells triggers a massive apoptosis. extent of cell death is significantly greater when IFN is added early during the infection cycle. the Mx and ISG-56 proteins showed similar patterns of expression in mock-infected and infected cells treated with IFN. for both proteins, there were higher levels of accumulation in the I+3 and I+6 than in the I+9 or I+12 samples. the addition of IFN at early times p.i. resulted in a major reduction of VP3 expression. treatment with IFN after IBDV infection did not cause drastic morphological changes or the mortality observed in wild-type or silencing control cells. PKR silencing also caused a significant reduction of the extent of PARP cleavage triggered by IFN treatment. apoptosis was measured for duplicate samples by using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit. apoptosis was quantified using the caspase 3/7 assay. we found a drastic reduction of this activity in PKR-silenced cells. a conspicuous absence of phosphorylated eIF2 was observed in PKR-silenced cells. cells were harvested at 24 h p.i. for RNA extraction. purified RNAs were then analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. the results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 4. level of IFNB gene expression was significantly lower in I+3 samples from PKR-silenced cells than in either M or M+3 cell samples. however, Mx, ISG-15, and ISG-56 gene expressions were induced by IFN treatment to similar levels in infected and mock-infected cells. intriguingly, ISG-56 and Mx expression levels were enhanced by about 10-fold in PKR-silenced cells with respect to inf we were keen to assess the possible role of TNF- in the generalized apoptosis observed in IBDV-infected cells. for this, we generated lentiviral particles expressing five short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting human TNFA. effects of TNF- knockdown on apoptosis by IFN in IBDV-infected HeLa cells. cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing shC, sh1 and sh4. at 4 days p.t. (A) and 12 days p.t. (B), cells were transfected with poly(IC) for 16 h to induce TNF- gene expression. infected cell samples were normalized to those for mock-infected cells. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data from duplicate samples. in mock-infected cells, either M or M+3, only a negligible band corresponding to cleaved PARP could be observed. the gradual increase in apoptosis observed in I+3 cell samples was confirmed by real-time quantitative cell death analysis. Western blot analysis of total cell extracts with anti-PARP, anti-t-PKR, anti-p-PKR, and anti-VP3 antibodies was used as a protein loading control. the Western blot corresponding to -actin was used as a protein loading control. the caspase values for infected cell samples were normalized to those for mock-infected cells. bars indicate means standard deviations based on data from duplicate samples. a gradual increase in PKR phosphorylation was observed in I+3 cells. cell samples were harvested at 3-h intervals from 4 to 24 h p.i. a progressive upregulation of IFNB transcription was observed in I+3 cells. a modest increase in IFNB gene expression (2-fold) was detected in I and M+3 samples harvested at 24 h p.i. dsRNA produced by a polymerase inhibitor, 7-deaza-2\u2032-C-methyladenosine (7DMA) could be the trigger of the massive apoptotic response. first, heLa cells were treated with different doses of 7DMA (0.05 to 2 mM), and a toxicity assay was performed to determine the highest dose of the drug that could be used without compromising cell viability. from this assay, the 0.2 mM dose was a significant reduction in apoptosis in the I+3 samples. a slight reduction was also observed for the samples not treated with IFN. NF-B activation upon treatment with IFN in IBDV-infected HeLa cells. each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with serum anti-p65. MG132 blocks proteolytic activity of the proteasome and NF-B. accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins did not have a significant effect on cell viability (5%). cultures were harvested at 16, 18, and 20 h p.i., when activation of NF-B was previously detected. however, cytoplasmic NF-B levels remained unchanged in all cases. we wished to confirm the effectiveness of the treatments in our HeLa cell system. for this, HeLa cells were treated with the selected doses, 50 and 25 M SC-514 and JSH-23, respectively, or with the solvent DMSO as a control during 2 h, followed by treatment with 20 ng/ml of TNF- during 30 min. then, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-p65 and anti a reduction in caspase activity was observed in the I+3 samples treated with both NF-B activation inhibitors compared with mock-treated cells. a minor reduction was also seen in the I samples treated with the inhibitors. this confirms the involvement of the NF-B pathway in triggering of apoptosis by IFN in IBDV-infected cells. Western blot analysis of p65 in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions. samples were subjected to subcellular fractionation. each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with serum anti-p65. IBDV-infected HeLa cells treated with IFN at 3 h p.i. (I+3) were treated with SC-514, JSH-23 (50 and 25 M, respectively), or DMSO as a control ( at 14 h p.i.) nuclear and cytosolic fractions were analyzed by using antibodies against p65, IB, and VP3. some caspase 3/7 activity was detected in cells transfected with viral dsRNA (R) however, the activity was significantly higher when cells were treated with IFN (R+3). incubation of cells with IBDV VLPs did not elicit an apoptotic response. these results suggest that genomic IBDV dsRNA might be the viral component that contributes to this effect. IFN- treatment of HeLa cells infected with different strains of IBDV also causes apoptosis. cells were treated with hIFN- (1,000 IU/ml) at 3 h p.i. and collected at 24 h p.i. IFN treatment triggers apoptosis of HeLa cells infected with different strains of IBDV. cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml of hIFN- at 3 h p.i. (M+3 and I+3, respectively), as indicated, or remained untreated. chicken DF-1 cells were infected with IBDV (Soroa strain) at an MOI of 2. cells were treated or not with 1,000 U/ml of chIFN- at 3 h p.i. treatment with IFN also exacerbated the CPE caused by IBDV. cells were incubated with the incuCyte caspase 3/7 apoptosis assay reagent. images were recorded with an incuCyte Zoom system apparatus at 16 h p.i. DF-1 cells were treated with different doses of staurosporine. IFNs promote selective induction of apoptosis in cells infected with a variety of viruses, thereby limiting virus spread (35, 54, 55) the potential contribution of IFN to IBDV pathogenesis has not been addressed. the apoptosis of infected cells can be considered a protective mechanism limiting virus spread. however, there are some well-documented examples evidencing that this phenomenon might also contribute to virus-induced pathogenesis. PKR activation correlated directly with the phosphorylation of eIF2, its best-characterized substrate, and with a significant reduction of VP3 accumulation. the extent of PKR activation also correlated positively with the magnitude of the apoptotic response. PKR is involved in apoptosis induction by different mechanisms (42, 63) we observed a higher level of IFNB induction in infected cells treated with IFN at 3 h p.i. than in PKR-silenced cells. this increase correlated positively with PKR activation in HeLa control cells. progressive IFNB induction was observed at later times after IBDV infection. dsRNA shields the virus genome from host RNA sensors, thus preventing apoptosis. a stoichiometric analysis of IBDV structural components showed that infectious IBDV particles harbor four dsRNA genome segments associated (in form of RNPs) with ca. 450 VP3 molecules (19) dsRNA complexes are poorly stable over time and highly dependent upon the VP3 concentration. viral dsRNA transfected into cells would not exactly mimic the IBDV genome in the context of an infection, where the dsRNA is structured in RNPs, being complexed to VP3 and the RNA polymerase VP1. the first signs of apoptosis are detected between 12 and 15 h p.i. blocking viral RNA replication/transcription with the RNA polymerase inhibitor 7DMA drastically reduced the extent of apoptosis in TNFA upregulation did not occur in PKR knockdown cells. TNF- would then act downstream in the PKR-related apoptotic pathway. similar situation has been described for severe acute respiratory syndrome. the well-known feedback mechanism between TNF- and NF-B (74) seems to operate during the development of apoptosis in cells treated with IFN-. but the activation of NF-B alone is not sufficient for cell killing, requiring further signals to trigger the apoptotic route (76) the effect of IFN on IPNV replication was moderate when IFN was added after infection (4 or 10 h p.i.) compared with IFN pretreatment. the study also showed that Mx expression induced by IFN treatment was reduced in cells previously infected with IPNV. this indicates that some viral products interfere with ISG expression. human immunodeficiency virus (78), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (79, 80), classical swine fever virus (81, 80), avian influenza virus (58), and SARS coronavirus (57) are examples of this direct relationship between the type I IFN response and the clinical outcome of viral infection. we have contributed for the first time to elucidating a potential mechanism driving the apoptotic death of IBDV-inf apoptosis of infected cells can be considered a protective mechanism limiting virus spread. but there are some well-documented examples evidencing that this phenomenon might also contribute to virus-induced pathogenesis. PKR activation correlated directly with the phosphorylation of eIF2, its best-characterized substrate, and with a significant reduction of VP3 accumulation. the extent of PKR activation also correlated positively with the magnitude of the apoptotic response. PKR is involved in apoptosis induction by different mechanisms. we observed a higher level of IFNB induction in infected cells treated with IFN at 3 h p.i. than in PKR-silenced cells. this increase correlated positively with PKR activation in d and wild-type control cells. however, progressive IFNB induction was observed at later times after IBDV infection. a stoichiometric analysis of IBDV structural components showed that infectious IBDV particles harbor four dsRNA genome segments associated with ca. 450 VP3 molecules. this is consistent with the notion that the binding of VP3 to IBDV dsRNA shields the virus genome from host RNA sensors, thus preventing PKR-mediated apoptosis. nude viral dsRNA transfected into cells would not exactly mimic the IBDV genome in the context of an infection. the first signs of apoptosis are detected between 12 and 15 h p.i. blocking viral RNA replication/transcription with the RNA polymerase inhibitor 7DMA drastically reduced the extent of apoptosis in infected cells treated with IFN. infected cells treated with IFN could be primed to undergo apoptosis through TNF- but not via TRAIL or Fas signaling. TNFA upregulation did not occur in PKR knockdown cells; TNF- would then act downstream in the PKR-related apoptotic pathway, mediating the clearance of IBDV-infected cells. the well-known feedback mechanism between TNF- and NF-B (74) seems to operate during the development of apoptosis in cells infected with IBDV and treated with IFN. however, the activation of NF-B alone is not sufficient for cell killing, requiring further signals to trigger the apoptotic route (76). similar experiments have been carried out with IPNV, another birnavirus (77) the effect of IFN on IPNV replication was moderate when IFN was added after infection (4 or 10 h p.i.) compared with IFN pretreatment, it also showed that Mx expression induced by IFN treatment was reduced in cells previously infected with IPNV. human immunodeficiency virus (78), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (79, 80), classical swine fever virus (81), avian influenza virus (58), and SARS coronavirus (57) are examples of this direct relationship between the type I IFN response and the rigor of the clinical outcome of viral infection. the cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% chicken fetal serum (Sigma-Aldrich) these cells were deficient in PKR (HeLa PKR silenced) and control cells (HeLa control), stably expressing an shRNA targeting the PKR gene and a scrambled shRNA, respectively, were generated. mock- or IBDV-infected cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml of IFN- at the indicated times p.i. samples from mock-infected cells (M) treated with IFN are denoted M+3 and M+6, etc., where the number indicates the time in hours p.i. at which IFN was added to the culture. the clarified supernatant was incubated with the resin for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. after several washes with 50 mM Tris-HCl, the protein was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) chIFN- was titrated according to procedures described previously by Schwarz and coworkers. the live/dead cell imaging kit was used to discriminate live from dead cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. at the specified times p.i., an equal volume of the reagent was added to HeLa cell monolayers grown in 24-well plates. yl sulfate [SDS], 0.01% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 5% -mercaptoethanol were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. immunoblots were incubated with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS] containing 0.05% Tween 20 [TBST] and 5% nonfat dry milk) a goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) or a goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction (GE Healthcare) cell monolayers grown in 24-well plates were infected and treated in duplicate. gene expression levels were normalized to the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 gene. the results were calculated as fold changes in gene expression relative to mock-infected cells. plasmid pLKO.1-Puro with a U6 promoter was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. the successful 21-nucleotide human TNF- targeting sequence was GCAGGTCTACTTTGGGATCAT (sh4) cells were infected with VT7LacOI/POLY at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell. cells were collected and used to purify VLPs by ultracentrifugation. dsRNA was extracted from preparations of sucrose gradient-purified IBDV. nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared from HeLa cells grown in 24-well plates and treated under different experimental conditions by using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents. GraphPad Prism version 5.03 software was used to determine statistical significance, using the Student unpaired two-tailed t test. cells, viruses, and infections. IBDV infections were performed on preconfluent cell monolayers with the soroa strain, a cell-adapted serotype 1 virus, diluted in DMEM at an MOI of 2 PFU per cell. after 1 h of adsorption at 37\u00b0C, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS. chIFN- was produced as a recombinant protein expressed by a vaccinia virus recombinant harboring the sequence encoding IFN- from Gallus gallus. the sequence was retrieved from the NCBI, fused to a sequence corresponding to a histidine tag, and cloned into the pVOTE transfer vector (86) purified chIFN- was titrated according to procedures described previously by Schwarz and coworkers. luciferase activity was determined after 6 h by using a luciferase report assay kit. cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in Laemmli's sample buffer. immunoblots were incubated with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS] containing 0.05% Tween 20 [TBST] and 5% nonfat dry milk) rabbit polyclonal sera specific for IBDV VP3 (85), ISG-56 (catalog number sc-82946; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PKR (catalog number sc-6282; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), total eIF2 (catalog number sc-11386; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p-eIF2 (catalog number 44728G; Invitrogen), PARP (catalog number 9542; Cell Signal twenty-five microliters of the cell lysates under study per well was added to 25 l of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent in a 96-well plate. plates were shaken gently and then incubated in the dark for 60 min before the luciferase activity was recorded by using an appliskan luminometer. cDNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by using a random primer and superscript III (invitrogen the successful 21-nucleotide human TNF- targeting sequence was GCAGGTCTCTTTGGGATCAT (sh4). the successful 21-nucleotide human TNF- targeting sequence was GCAGGTCTCTTTGGGATCAT (sh4) plasmids pMDLg/pRRE, pMD2.G, and pRSV-Rev were acquired. lentiviral particles were produced in HEK-293T cells. supernatants were collected at 36 h posttransfection. genomic IBDV dsRNA was extracted from preparations of sucrose gradient-purified IBDV as previously described (20) dsRNA concentrations were determined by using a nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific)"}
