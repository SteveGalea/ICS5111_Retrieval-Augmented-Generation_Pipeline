{"summary": "infectious diseases are one of the primary worries of public health systems worldwide. misuse of antibiotics, interrupted courses of treatment, and antibiotic usage in agricultural settings have had a confounding effect on the increase of resistance. nanoparticles (NPs) are emerging as a great candidate due to their unique qualities. nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cancer therapy [10,13,14,15,16], orthopedic engineering [17], and the synthesis of contact lenses [18]. ND production includes chemical vapor deposition, detonation, and high-pressure/high-temperature [20], which allows for classification based on their primary particle or grain size from 200 nm down to 2 nm [2,21]. nanomaterials have revealed intrinsic immunomodulatory properties, being able to act as immune potentiators [7], increasing the immune response. NDs can also be used as co-adjuvants, stimulating the proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. a 20\u201330-g weight of nanoparticles can carry a 1 g dried weight of protein. NDs have the ability to bind to Complement component 1q (C1q), a protein of the complement pathway involved in many physiological and pathological processes. NDs can remain in the circulation without being excreted. biodistribution studies in mice revealed that NDs predominantly accumulate in the liver and lungs, although they can also be found in the spleen, kidneys, or even in bone. these deleterious effects can be overcome, and there are several research groups working on that. NDs are highly biocompatible, tunable surface structures that allows for the attachment of other molecules such as drugs or antibodies. 5 nm NDs are more toxic than 100 nm ND, probably due to the disordered carbon surface. results showed fluorescent nanodiamonds could be used as a bio-label to image any live organism without any level of toxicity. the use of NDs for drug delivery is relatively recent, but their small size, high bounding properties, and low cytotoxicity make them highly promising for their use in different areas of microbiology and infectious diseases. NDs also have an intrinsic bactericidal activity [63,64] NDs have been bound to several antimicrobial compounds, including antifungal and antibiotic compounds such as polymyxin B [67], aflatoxin B1 [68], tetracycline, and vancomycin [69]. NDs conjugated with amoxicillin were able to internalize into T24 bladder cells containing uropathogenic E. coli. the authors revealed that internalization of these molecules happens in only 2 hours and that internalization is necessary to effectively kill bacteria. NDs have the ability to bind to viruses, such as hepatitis B or C, from blood plasma isolated from infected patients. NDs can circulate in the blood without being secreted, and accumulate in the liver (within macrophages) and lung tissues. NDs have great potential in the field of infectious diseases. NDs possess remarkable mechanical and optical properties and a large surface area. they have the ability to modulate the host immune response. this is a key feature to fight against pathogens."}
