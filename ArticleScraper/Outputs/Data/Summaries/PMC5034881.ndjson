{"summary": "chikungunya virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Zika virus are among the most recent emerging viral pathogens. chikungunya virus, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and zika virus,3\u20135 are of great concern to the world health organization. new and improved ways to study viral processes and understand the adverse effects on the host are in need. protease inhibitors (PIs) on the market against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease exemplifies this fact. proteolysis in the context of viral infection is a much more complex process, defined by the cleavage of both viral and host proteins by either the viral-encoded protease or host-encoded enzymes. cleavage should elucidate the cellular requirements for cleavage in a natural cellular milieu and facilitate the discovery of more biologically relevant specific antivirals. this assay was adapted to the premembrane protein of DenV, which is also cleaved in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network. viral aspartyl PR is responsible for the posttranslational cleavage of the viral proteome, cleaving all but one site. it is also known to possess autocatalytic properties as it cleaves itself from the precursor Gag-Pol polyprotein. the host enzyme furin processes the boundary between gp120 and gp41 of Env. a family of enzymes known as proprotein convertases are responsible for the removal of inhibitory domains, leading to the activation and maturation of certain viral proteins during infection. the classical secretory pathway houses a multitude of enzymes responsible for posttranslational modifications including signal peptidases and signal peptidases. multiplexing can be applied to a wide variety of systems and formats in flow cytometry54\u201359 or microscopy. Specifically, our laboratory has successfully combined the use of fluorescent proteins and genetic engineering through retroviral technology to obtain cell lines. chikungunya virus, chikungunya virus and zika virus are among the most recent emerging viral pathogens. chikungunya virus, chikungunya virus, coronavirus, and zika virus are of great concern to the world health organization. new ways to study viral processes and understand the adverse effects on the host are in need. protease inhibitors (PIs) on the market against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease (when this exists) has been an obvious target for antivirals. the viral protease is cleaved by the viral-encoded protease or host-encoded enzymes. this is particularly so with proteolysis, as proteolytic events occur in various subcellular compartments. monitoring cleavage in these compartments should elucidate the cellular requirements for cleavage in a natural cellular milieu and facilitate the discovery of more biologically relevant specific antivirals. viral aspartyl PR is responsible for posttranslational cleavage of the viral proteome, cleaving all but one site. it is also known to possess autocatalytic properties as it cleaves itself from the precursor Gag-Pol polyprotein when two molecules dimerize before processing the rest of the viral proteome. the classical secretory pathway houses a multitude of enzymes responsible for posttranslational modifications including signal peptidases and signal peptide peptidases. a family of enzymes known as proprotein convertases are responsible for the removal of inhibitory domains. multiplexing can be applied to a wide variety of systems and formats in flow cytometry. this allows us to ensure stable, nondeteriorating expression of different fluorescent proteins at different intensity levels. this allows us to ensure stable, nondeteriorating expression of different fluorescent proteins at different intensity levels. the two assays are based on fluorescence but are very different in nature. the first relies on eGFP fluorescence, and the second on classical fluorescently labeled antibodies. the color of the circles indicate whether cleavage occurs (green) or not (red) in the respective assay, PR (1) or Env (2). the rate of this decline is dependent on several key factors including the protein half-life and the stability of the protein. the percentage of eGFP expressing cells within the green gates is shown in each case. the individual PR assay shows a robust shift to the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel (HA positive; bottom panels) the mixed population depicts the expected phenotype at the anticipated rate of approximately 50%. human SupT1 cells clonal for both previously described assays (HIV-1 PR and HIV-1 Env) were analyzed for their respective activity. bottom panels depict cells harboring the individual Env assay either unstained (left panel) or stained with anti-HA antibody. a cell line expressing the assay for the HIV-1 PR was transduced with retroviral particles carrying the HIV-Env assay construct. the first panel in Figure 5A shows the negative controls (untreated and unstained, without or with Dox) the cells were stained with HA antibody and APC-coupled secondary antibody to corroborate that the scaffold protein traveled to the cell surface. SupT1 cells were engineered to express both PR and Env assays. cells were analyzed by flow cytometry following each treatment and their combination. emission spectrum does not overlap with eGFP. the engineered cell line expresses two distinct assays. cleavage occurs in both PR and Env assays. cells were induced with doxycycline (Dox) and analyzed for inhibition in the presence of the PI darunavir (DAR) as observed by the presence of eGFP-positive cells. the individual PR assay shows a robust shift to the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel (eGFP positive following DAR treatment; top panels) the mixed population depicts the expected phenotype at the anticipated rate of approximately 50%. when treated with the PI DAR, a shift of approximately half of the population to FITC positive is observed. the gated FITC positive (green population) and APC positive (red population) can be combined and yet be clearly distinguished. a cell line harboring two independent assay readouts can be used as a platform where each one of the assays can be de-convoluted or distinguished from each other. a cell line expressing the assay for the HIV-1 PR was transduced with retroviral particles carrying the HIV-Env assay construct. cells were treated with the furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (DCK) and stained with FLAG and APC-coupled secondary antibody. similar single-positive (red window) or double-positive population (purple window) appears following DCK treatment. cell-based platforms are a critical and reliable tool for enhancing early-stage drug discovery. due to their cellular nature, they provide a straightforward approach that circumvents the need for independent or additional cytotoxicity testing or drug intake through cell membranes. the cellular nature also provides a better milieu for investigating biological processes such as protein\u2013protein interactions. expression experiments have shown the power of combining biological applications that monitor/test the proteolytic activity or cleavage of different viral proteins. the assay relies on fluorescently labeled antibody staining and thus can use any fluorescent channel distinguishable from the fluorescence channel of eGFP (FITC) this was possible due to the different fluorescent nature of each individual assay. the mixing experiment showed that each population kept the distinct characteristics of each assay. each assay functions as an internal control for compound specificity for the other. each assay functions as an internal control for compound specificity for the other. human T-cell line SupT1 was maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin\u2013streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine.
