{"summary": "cDNA was synthesized from extracted viral nucleic acids with non-poly(A) random hexamers. cDNA was synthesized from extracted viral nucleic acids with non-poly(A) random hexamers. short DNA sequences were analyzed and filtered at the nucleotide level. a contig was predicted as viral origin if the best tBLASTx hit was from the kingdom of viruses. a cluster was defined as a candidate if it contained a contig with viral origin. the 3,780-bp contig was composed of three major ORFs. the putative capsid protein (CP) encoded by ORF2 included a PLA2-like motif that is highly conserved among the members of the Parvoviridae. there was no homology at the nucleic acid level between the 3,780-bp contig and known viruses. eight pairs of PCR primers were designed, based on the sequence predicted. the 3,629-bp contig, composed of the entire coding region plus about half of the ITRs from both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini, aligned exactly with that of the de novo-assembled 3,780-bp contig. the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV because the samples were collected in a hospital in Chongqing. circular form of NIH-CQV was designated NIH-CQV-Co. Phylogenetic and Evolutionary Analyses of NIH-CQV. phylogenetic analysis of the two ORFs was performed separately. phylogenetic analysis of rep and CP of NIH-CQV based on alignment of amino acid sequences. tree was constructed by neighbor joining based on alignments generated with CLUSTAL V. a higher value of Ka/Ks reflects selection favoring amino acid mutation. lower values are consistent with selection against nonsynonymous variants. negative selection acts to eliminate variants with a diminished capacity to complete the virus-replication cycle. the average values of Ka/Ks ratios of cap or rep of NIH-CQV from 22 individual patients are indicated. the y-axis is the averaged values of Ka or Ks within a sliding window of 100 amino acids. Genomic regions with significant high Ka/Ks are shown in gray. a synthetic DNA fragment encoding a 184-amino acid polypeptide of the C-terminal portion of CP was cloned into an expression vector. the affinity-purified recombinant CP (rCP) was used for serological studies. cross-reactivities between NIH-CQV and other human parvoviruses were tested. specificity test for rCP of NIH-CQV. cell lysates derived from cells transfected with plasmids expressed capsid proteins of AAV2, Parv4, HBoV, and B19V were subjected to SDS/PAGE and then were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. after blocking with 5% (wt/vol) nonfat milk for 2 h, the membrane was incubated with respective antisera at 1:1,000 10 pools were made of sera from 92 patients with non-A\u2013E hepatitis. cDNA was synthesized from extracted viral nucleic acids with non-poly(A) random hexamers. cDNA was synthesized from extracted viral nucleic acids. contigs from different samples were clustered based on nucleotide-level similarities. a contig was predicted as viral origin if the best tBLASTx hit was from the kingdom of viruses. a cluster was defined as a candidate if it contained a contig with viral origin. the first 100 amino acids of the PPV VP1 region constituted an active phospholipase A2 (PLA2). the putative capsid protein (CP) encoded by ORF2 included a PLA2-like motif. there was no homology at the nucleic acid level between the 3,780-bp contig and known viruses. eight pairs of PCR primers were designed to amplify overlapping DNA fragments from the pooled patient samples. eight amplified DNA fragments were of the expected lengths. the 3,629-bp contig aligned exactly with that of the de novo-assembled 3,780-bp contig. a 419-bp region composed of both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ITRs present in the linear virus genome was absent in the inverse PCR product. the circular form of NIH-CQV was designated NIH-CQV-Co. whole-proteome phylogeny analysis of NIH-CQV with 14 circoviruses and 21 prototypes of parvoviruses was conducted using a dynamic language model (24), which correctly divided the 35 selected viruses into two families. phylogenetic relationship of the CP of NIH-CQV and other related parvoviruses based on an alignment of amino acid sequences. a higher value of Ka/Ks reflects selection favoring amino acid mutation. negative selection acts to eliminate variants with diminished capacity to complete virus-replication cycle. the average Ka/Ks ratio of the cp of the virus was greater in patients with chronic hepatitis than in patients with acute hepatitis (0.98 0.27 versus 0.71 0.17; P 0.01) the average values of Ka/Ks across the whole gene region of NIH-CQV from 22 individual patients (acute: n = 13; chronic: n = 9) are indicated. the average values of Ka/Ks across the whole gene region of NIH-CQV from the 22 patients are indicated. patients with cryptic HAV and HCV infection were negative for NIH-CQV by qPCR. each dot represents one specimen. bars show the average copy numbers of virus genome. cross-reactivities between NIH-CQV and other human parvoviruses were tested by immunoblotting. a significant difference in NIH-CQV\u2013specific IgM, but not in IgG, between the patients with acute and chronic hepatitis and from healthy controls using rCP of NIH-CQV. the cell lysates derived from the cells transfected with the plasmids that expressed capsid proteins of AAV2, Parv4, HBoV, and B19V were subjected to SDS/PAGE. NIH-CQV appears to lie at the interface of parvoviruses and circoviruses. the genome of NIH-CQV has no homology to any known viruses in GenBank. CP protein of NIH-CQV is minimally homologous to porcine and goose parvovirus VP1 (27) the homologous region is mainly in the N terminus of CP and contains the conserved PLA2-like motif, which is present in the N-terminal extension of the VP1 unique region of members of Parvoviridae (23). a BLASTp search revealed that the Rep of NIH-CQV is more related to circoviral recombination and high mutation rate are often cited as key in evolutionary innovation. recombination allows single-step acquisition of multiple genetic changes. a high mutation rate enhances adaptation to new hosts. cp gene contained three regions in which the Ka/Ks ratio exceeded 1, suggesting positive selection. selective pressure on the rep appeared to be dominated by purifying selection. the average Ka/Ks ratio for the rep from 14 patients was 0.42. no causative agent may be defined in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. several human viruses, such as GB virus C (38), Torque teno virus (39), and SEN virus (40), have been putatively claimed to be hepatitis viruses. subsequent investigation revealed no conclusive association between these viruses and liver disease. the limited number of samples available, we cannot exclude the possibility of reactivation of a latent virus in the course of liver inflammation. clinical manifestations of the infection range from none to acute systemic manifestations involving skin and joints. in immunocompromised populations, B19V chronic infection causes pure red cell aplasia; in immunocompromised populations, B19V chronic infection causes pure red cell aplasia. total bilirubin 174 130 mol/L (range: 14\u2013735 mol/L), alanine aminotransferase 421 623 IU/L (range: 5\u20133,150 IU/L) serological tests for anti-HAV IgM (HAV IgM, ELISA Kit; Wantai Biological Pharmacy), anti-HEV IgM (HDV IgM ELISA Kit; Wantai Biological Pharmacy) were all negative viral DNA was extracted from sera as described in the Solexa deep sequencing. extracted DNA (5 L) was used as template for the PCR. extracted DNA (5 L) was used as template for the PCR. a synthetic DNA fragment encoding a 184-amino acid polypeptide of the C-terminal portion of CP was cloned into an expression vector. the affinity-purified rCP was used for immunoblotting. 33 patients were diagnosed with acute hepatitis by clinical and biochemical parameters. anti-HCV antibodies (HBsAg and HBeAg; Roche Diagnostic Systems) were negative. additional tests for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, antimitochondrial antibody (HIV ELISA Kit; Wantai Biological Pharmacy) were negative. d of 1 Platinum Taq PCR Buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 mM MgCl2, each dNTP at 0.2 mM, and 25 pmol each of the primers were performed. inverse PCR with a primer pair that oriented outwardly with respect to each other was used for amplification. PCR was performed as described above, and amplified products were visualized on an agarose gel. cross-reactivities between NIH-CQV and other human parvoviruses, including B19V, Parv4, HBoV, and AAV2, were tested by immunoblotting."}
