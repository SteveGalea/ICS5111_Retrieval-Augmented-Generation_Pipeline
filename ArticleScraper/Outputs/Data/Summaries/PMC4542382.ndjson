{"summary": "host cells have evolved cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic immune defense mechanisms. the type I IFN response pathway is activated after the detection of nonself pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) the binding of PAMPs triggers a signaling cascade that results in the transcriptional activation of type I IFN and its secretion from infected cells. human and mouse IFIT1 proteins were identified as proteins that distinguish between self and nonself RNA species. IFIT1 restricted infections by flaviviruses, poxviruses, and coronaviruses that were deficient in 2\u2032-O methyltransferase activity (10\u201315) binding studies with the various RNA ligands of human and rabbit IFIT1 proteins demonstrated that IFIT1 has a higher affinity for cap 0 RNA than for 5\u2032-ppp RNA or cap 1 RNA. we infected human and mouse cells deficient in IFIT1 protein expression with four different negative-sense RNA viruses corresponding to three distinct families. RNA specific for human IFIT1 (GCTGCATATCGAAAGACAT) was cloned into the gRNA expression plasmid. transfected cells were treated with 2 g/ml of puromycin for 2 days. the target area was amplified by PCR (primer sequences are available upon request) two distinct alleles were identified for IFIT1 and IFIT1B. only a single allele was identified for IFIT1. bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated as described previously. the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (IAV-Cal) and A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (IAV-PR8) were obtained from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonic eggs. mouse-adapted Ebola virus (maEBOV; adapted from Ebola virus [Zaire ebolavirus] isolate Mayinga as described previously [ l of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after sedation with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (Avertin; Sigma-Aldrich) mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the footpad with 106 or 105 focus-forming units (FFU) of OROV or LACV. tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of minimal essential medium, centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 g to remove viral burdens in sera and organs were measured using OROV- and LACV-specific primers and probes. level of viral RNA was normalized to Gapdh gene expression in the tissue samples. growth of IAV-PR8 was assessed in wild-type A549, IFIT1mu/mu A549, and A549-CRISPR ctrl cells. OV, 1.5 105 M were seeded in a 12-well plate 7 to 8 days prior to infection. 8 hours prior to infection, M were pretreated with 100 U/ml of mouse IFN-. titers were determined by a TCID50 assay on vero E6 cells. samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. membranes were blocked and probed with the following panel of primary antibodies. the antibodies were anti-rabbit\u2013Alexa 690 and anti-mouse\u2013Alexa 800 (Li-Cor) all flow cytometry studies were performed using a flow cytometer. the relative infection level was calculated as the percent infection of transfected cells divided by the percent infection of untransfected cells. the percentage of the viral antigen+ Flag+ population was determined by dividing the percentage of the viral antigen+ population by that of the Flag+ population. unlabeled RNA with cap 0 or 5\u2032-OH (125 nM) was added to the murine Ifit1 protein (0.3 M) and radiolabeled 5\u2032-ppp RNA (5 nM) samples were applied to a dot blot apparatus (Whatman) with one nitrocellulose (NC) membrane on top of one nylon (NY) membrane. fraction bound = RNA signal on NC/(RNA signal on NC + RNA signal on NY) all data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad6). differences in viral titers, cytokine levels, gene expression data, and cell numbers were analyzed by the log rank test. cco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES. DNAs were extracted from these clonal A549 cells. target area was amplified by PCR (primer sequences are available upon request) two distinct alleles were identified for IFIT1 (A) and IFIT1B (B) genes from IFIT1mu/mu A549 cells. only a single allele was identified for IFIT1. mouse-adapted Ebola virus (maEBOV; adapted from Ebola virus [Zaire ebolavirus] isolate Mayinga as described previously [28] was propagated in Vero E6 cells. samples inactivation/removal was performed according to standard operating protocols approved by the local institutional biosafety committee. Lungs were collected on day 3, 6, or 9 after inoculation with 104 EID50 of IAV-Cal. tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of minimal essential medium, centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 g to remove cellular debris. supernatant was used to quantify the amount of infectious virus present in the lungs. cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. the supernatant was collected at 24, 48, and 72 h postinoculation. the virus titer in the supernatant was quantified on MDCK cells. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed by lavaging the trachea and lungs three times by injecting a total of 2.5 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) all samples were processed on an LSRII machine (BD Biosciences) the Western blots were imaged on a Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imager. they were then analyzed with Image Studio Lite. expression was measured by fluorogenic qRT-PCR using primers and probes. the relative infection level was calculated as the percent infection of transfected cells divided by the percent infection of untransfected cells. the percentage of the viral antigen+ Flag+ population was divided by that of the Flag+ population. the calculation was done for each sample and then normalized to the value for luciferase control-transfected cells. samples were applied to a dot blot apparatus (Whatman) with one nitrocellulose membrane on top of one nylon membrane. fraction bound = RNA signal on NC/(RNA signal on NC + RNA signal on NY) data were fitted to the Hill equation by using Origin. 49-WT, A549-IFIT1mu/mu, and A549-CRISPR ctrl cells were determined by linear regression analysis. we first established an in vitro growth system with Ifit1-sufficient and -deficient mouse and human respiratory epithelial cells that are permissive for IAV infection. mTECs from WT and Ifit1/ mice were treated with 50 U/ml (dark colors) or 1,000 U/ml (light colors) of recombinant IFN- or mock treated for 18 h before cellular RNA was extracted. mTECs from WT and Ifit1/ mice were treated with 50 U/ml (dark colors) or 1,000 U/ml (light colors) of recombinant IFN- or mock treated for 18 h before IFIT1mu/mu cells were treated with 100 U/ml of recombinant human IFN- or mock treated for 18 h. cellular RNA was extracted and used to quantify IFIT2, IFIT3 and RSAD2 gene expression. the loss of expression of IFIT1 proteins was corroborated by Western blotting. IFIT1mu/mu A549 cells expressed WT levels of IFIT3 protein and IFIT2, IFIT3 and RSAD2 mRNAs after IFN- treatment. human IFIT1 was transfected into HEK293T cells. 16 h later the cells were infected with IAV-PR8 at an MOI of 5. ectopic expression of human IFIT1 did not affect IAV infection. the relative infection level was calculated as the percent infection of transfected cells divided by the percent infection of nontransfected cells for each sample. the data represent the mean relative infection levels SD for two independent experiments performed in triplicate. bunyaviruses were chosen for study because ectopic expression of IFIT1 reportedly inhibited infection by Rift Valley fever virus (19), a phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family. we performed a multistep growth analysis with LACV and OROV in WT and Ifit1/ murine embryonic fibroblasts. a dotted line represents the limit of detection of the assay. the data represent the means SD for two independent experiments performed in triplicate. a filter-binding assay was used to measure the binding affinity of murine Ifit1 to the 5\u2032-UTR of IAV. a filter-binding assay was used to measure the binding affinity of murine Ifit1 to the 5\u2032-UTR of IAV. the data are means SD and are representative of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. a nonradiolabeled RNA representing the 5\u2032 end of PB2 of IAV-Cal was modified to contain a cap 0 or 5\u2032-OH structure. we infected WT and Ifit1/ mice with IAV, OROV, or OROV. we monitored morbidity, mortality, and viral burden in vivo. no difference in viral burden in the lungs was observed on days 3, 6, and 9 after IAV infection. a scatterplot of the data is shown, with each individual point representing a single animal (n = 8 to 12) the dashed line represents the limit of detection of the assay. the data were pooled from three independent experiments.

WT and Ifit1/ mTECs expressed high levels of Ifit1 and Rsad2 mRNAs. Ifit1/ cells expressed high levels of Rsad2 mRNA but no Ifit1 mRNA. absence of antiviral effect of Ifit1 in mTECs against IAV was not due to absence of expression of other Ifit genes. data were pooled from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. expression of ISGs in WT and IFIT1mu/mu A549 cells after IFN- stimulation. data represent means standard deviation (SD) for two independent experiments performed in triplicate. the two alleles of IFIT1 in IFIT1mu/mu A549 cells contained 1- and 7-nucleotide deletions at position 757 from the translation start site. only a single allele of IFIT1B was identified, and the 2-nucleotide deletion resulted in a premature stop codon approximately 60 nucleotides downstream of the modification. we saw no statistically significant differences in replication of IAV in WT and IFIT1mu/mu A549 cells. an absence of an effect of murine and human IFIT1 on IAV infection was unexpected, because a previous report suggested that IFIT1 bound to viral RNA displaying 5\u2032-ppp moieties. HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged luciferase, IFITM3 or IFIT1. cells were harvested at 6 h postinfection and stained with MAbs specific for IAV-NP. the data represent the mean relative infection levels SD for two independent experiments performed in triplicate. we then assessed whether Ifit1 restricted infection by three other negative-sense RNA viruses, including two bunyaviruses. maEBOV does not restrict infection by OROV, LACV, and maEBOV. supernatants harvested at indicated times for titration by a focus-forming assay. mouse Ifit1 binding to the 5\u2032-UTRs of all three gene segments was detected when they displayed cap 0, cap 1, and 5\u2032-ppp RNA structures. however, Ifit1 bound 5\u2032-ppp RNA and cap 1 RNA less avidly than it bound cap 0 RNA (5- to 17-fold lower affinity) murine Ifit1 has a lower affinity for RNA with 5\u2032-OH than for 5\u2032-ppp and cap 0 RNAs. a filter-binding assay was used to measure the binding affinity of murine Ifit1 for the viral RNA (vRNA) of influenza A virus (IAV-Cal) a filter-binding assay was used to measure the binding affinity of murine Ifit1 for IAV 5\u2032-UTR cap 0, cap 1 and 5\u2032-ppp. the data presented are fold differences in KD values between cap 0 and cap 1 or cap 0 and 5\u2032-ppp RNA, calculated from two independently repeated assays. murine Ifit1 does not affect virus infection, pathogenesis, or cellular infiltrates in vivo after infection with IAV-Cal. a scatterplot of the data is shown, with each individual point representing a single animal. the data were pooled from three experiments, each containing at least three WT and Ifit1/ mice. no statistical differences were observed as judged by the test. 4 32 2 821 76 772 51 235 49 259 45 IL-13 ND ND 79 32 92 22 90 28 74 26 IL-17 ND ND 8 21 12 11 37 34 33 34 Eotaxin 613 76 455 79 489 58 657 50 6 11 5 14 G-CSF 294 41 315 67 743 70 821 89 299 63 114 23 GM-CSF 63 31 64 4 52 41 55 21 38 53 lungs were harvested, homogenized, and analyzed by the bio-Plex Pro 23-plex mouse cytokine and chemokine assay. ND, levels were below the threshold of detection. a scatterplot of the data is shown, with each individual point representing a single animal (n = 10 to 12) the dashed line represents the limit of sensitivity of the assay. Statistical significance was judged by the Mann-Whitney test. the genome of IAV is composed of eight single-stranded, negative-sense RNA gene segments. the 5\u2032 end of each segment displays a triphosphate motif that could be recognized and sequestered by IFIT1 during trafficking from the endosome to the nucleus or from the nucleus to the cell membrane prior to budding of new virus particles. ectopic expression of IFIT1 at very high levels overcomes lower-affinity binding to 5\u2032-ppp RNA and inhibits infection of some negative-sense RNA viruses. ectopic expression of IFIT1 at very high levels overcomes the lower-affinity binding to 5\u2032-ppp RNA. IFIT1 expression or activity toward negative-sense RNA viruses is greater in HeLa cells (19) than in the A549 cells or mTECs used in our study. several groups have reported significant inhibitory effects on positive-strand RNA (flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and coronavirus) viruses lacking 2\u2032-O methylation of their viral RNAs. \u2032-ppp moiety present in negative-sense RNA viruses."}
