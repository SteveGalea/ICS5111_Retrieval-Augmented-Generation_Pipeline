{"summary": "a total of 13 RV genotypes, which represent 2 clades, have been recognized, but 2 genotypes, 1E and 2B, are currently the most common worldwide. a distinct feature of RV is the ability to persist in the placenta and fetus and in immune privileged body sites of immunologically competent individuals. granuloma formation, a well-recognized disease in PID patients, is an accumulation of histiocytes and other immune cells near sites of chronic infection. the estimated granuloma prevalence in PID patients is 1\u20134%. 4,000 individuals in the us are expected to be affected. iVDRV was isolated from the skin biopsies of four PID patients. it was unclear whether loss of infectivity is a common feature of RA27/3-derived viruses within PID patients or a characteristic of vaccine virus evolution within that particular patient. we have determined full genomic sequences of these iVDRV. only RV antigen was detected in the available tissue sections of cutaneous granulomas (LA, OR, and RI cases) by fluorescent immunohistochemical staining for measles and rubella antigens. data indicate that only rubella component of MMR vaccine persists in these four lesions.

RA27/3 vaccine strain was basal to all sequenced iVDRV. 142 substitutions (57.5%) occurred at invariant amino acids in wtRV. the spectrum of amino acid substitutions appears to be different between wtRV and iVDRV persisting in immunodeficient individuals. additional studies of cross sectional diversity are needed to confirm this observation. the RVi chromatograms show the existence of different populations of viruses (quasispecies) in tissues and clinical isolates. iVDRV quasispecies in tissue and viral isolates. gene fragment was amplified with high fidelity DNA polymerase. 39 RVs and 30 RVi clones were sequenced and analyzed for diversity and complexity. iVDRV quasispecies in the granuloma were highly heterogeneous. a constant increase in the number of substitutions per a RV genome with time indicates continuous sequence evolution of iVDRV in PID patients. either or both substitution types may be useful as molecular clocks for the determination of the time iVDRV genomes have persisted in patients. the overall iVDRV evolution rate was estimated to be 1.8 x 103 subs/site/year. the consensus genomic sequences and protein sequences of iVDRV from anatomically separated body sites of the LA case were substantially different from each other. synonymous substitutions were distributed evenly throughout the genomes. nonsynonymous substitutions occurred predominately in the genes encoding structural proteins and the hypervariable regions in the p150 gene. dN/dS ratio is one of the means to estimate the presence and direction of selection. functional and structural domains in E2 have not been defined in detail. mutation profile and strand bias agree with previously suggested roles of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme. the scores were calculated for 60 [A to_G] mutations in the positive strand and for 141 [A_to_G] mutations in the negative strand of the viral genome. the prediction scores for positions containing A to G mutations exceeded prediction scores for adenines in positions that were not mutated at all ([A\u2013[A_to_G]]). most mutations were in cytosines of the viral positive strand. the capability for cytidine deamination in RNA was well established for APOBEC1. APOBEC3 enzymes are commonly viewed as acting exclusively in DNA. fish\u2019s exact test = 0.01 in each case. additional studies are needed to understand connections between dynamics of viral RNA secondary structure and the relative impacts of APOBEC and ADAR editing activities. mutation hotspot I involves residues I32, A34, K158, Q351, P415 in van der Waals contact with one another. mutation hotspot I involves residues I32, A34, K158, Q351, P415. mutation hotspot II includes hydrophobic residues I50, V57, F84, V87 and the residue E118. mutation hotspot II, which includes hydrophobic residues I50, V57, F84, V87 and the residue E118, is located near the fusion loops. several substitutions occurred in E1 neutralizing epitopes NT2-NT4 in three iVDRV strains, while NT1 epitope was invariant. the spatial location of the NT3 epitope and two mutations in the NT4 epitope, S282A and I280T/M, were located in the proposed membrane contact region of E1 in close proximity to the fusion loops. granuloma-associated rubella virus is under selective pressure from both neutralizing antibodies and T cells. growth properties of four iVDRV strains with growth properties of RA27/3 and RV-Dz in WI-38 human fetal fibroblasts. iVDRV spread after low MOI infections was reduced compared to RA27/3. iVDRV yields and percentages of RV-positive cells after infection of WI-38 with iVDRV, wtRV and RA27/3 strains at MOI = 5 (2 dpi) and MOI = 0.1 (3 dpi) titers in the media were determined by titration on Vero cells. dpi were counted; the percentage of remaining adherent cells in each well was calculated relative to the mock infected well. the cells in the second duplicate well were immunostained for E1. the cells in the second duplicate well were immunostained for E1. all cells were RV-positive in the infected monolayers at 36 dpi except those infected with CA6944 and OR5810. the fraction of CA6944 infected cells was reduced from 40% initially to less than 10% at 36 dpi concurrent with 2-log titer reduction. neutralization since 7 out of 10 sera failed to effectively neutralize it. a neutralization titer was expressed as a log2 reciprocal of the serum dilution that protected 50% of the input virus. the cutoff of the assay (NT = 10) was depicted by the red dashed line. the presence of RV IgM antibodies in sera of PID patients long after MMR vaccination may be a marker of vaccine virus replication and persistence. the presence of rubella, measles, and mumps IgM, rubella IgG and neutralization titers in serum samples of PID patients.

RA27/3 vaccine strain was basal to all sequenced iVDRV. these viruses were somewhat more distantly related to other vaccine strains. invariant amino acids in wtRV circulated worldwide during a period 1961\u20132012. the spectrum of amino acid substitutions appears to be different between wtRV and iVDRV persisting in immunodeficient individuals. the number of substitutions are shown for each RVi on the right. the regions in the genomic sequence which encode proteins are indicated by green pointed bars. the region in the genomic sequence which encode proteins are indicated by the green pointed bars. RNA isolated from the granuloma biopsy or from the CA6944 viral stock was cloned and sequenced. in total, 39 RVs and 30 RVi clones were sequenced and analyzed for diversity and complexity. iVDRV quasispecies in the granuloma were highly heterogeneous. trend is a positive linear association between the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions and the duration of persistence. either or both substitution types may be useful as molecular clocks for the determination of the time iVDRV genomes have persisted in patients. the overall iVDRV evolution rate was estimated to be 1.8 x 103 subs/site/year. the consensus genomic sequences and protein sequences of iVDRV from anatomically separated body sites were substantially different from each other. dN/dS ratio is one of the means to estimate the presence and direction of selection [23]. the SP genes were less constrained and more diverged than the NSP genes. the iVDRV proteins are often under a different selection pressure. evolution of most of the protein appears to be neutral since dN and dS curves were similar. the region between aa 110 and 200 could be under positive selection. functional and structural domains in E2 have not been defined in detail. all mutations in iVDRV data file are listed as changes in the positive strand. the negative strand [A to G] mutations are presented in this Table as [U to C] changes in the positive strand. the black horizontal line in the graphs denotes the median value of the prediction scores. the APOBEC3 subfamily may act on pathogen and host RNA in certain types of cells. the preferred motif for APOBEC3G deamination is cCn. the other members of the APOBEC3 family are characterized by a preference for tCn motif with higher preference for tCw (w = A or T) additional studies are needed to understand connections between the dynamics of viral RNA secondary structure and the relative impacts of APOBEC and ADAR editing activities. the E1 glycoprotein plays a crucial role in RV infectivity by mediating receptor binding and membrane fusion.

RV-Dz is a well-characterized wild type strain of genotype 1E. to compare virus yields and percentage of infected cells, cell monolayers were infected at high (5 ffu/cell) and low (0.1 ffu/cell) multiplicity of infection (MOI) wtRV and RA27/3 strains at MOI = 5 (2 dpi) and MOI = 0.1 (3 dpi) titers in the media were determined by titration on Vero cells. the number of infected cells was estimated by immunostaining for E1 protein. WI-38 cells were mock infected or infected with the RV strains at MOI = 5 for two days. the total amounts of genomic RV RNA per a cell were substantially higher in RA27/3 than RV-Dz infected WI-38 cells. iVDRV isolates to persist in WI-38 cells were compared after high and low MOIs. 6944 infected cells were reduced from 40% initially to less than 10% at 36 dpi concurrent with 2-log titer reduction. consensus genome sequences of all iVDRVs at 36 dpi were identical to the consensus sequence of the initial inoculums. iVDRV isolates were less cytopathic in cell culture than RA27/3 and had the capability to persist. a neutralization titer was expressed as a log2 reciprocal of the serum dilution that protected 50% of the input virus. the cutoff of the assay (NT = 10) was depicted by the red dashed line. rubella, measles, and mumps IgM status, rubella IgG and neutralization titers in serum samples of PID patients. the patient sera completely neutralized the indicated viruses at the highest dilution of 1:640 used in the neutralization experiments. wt RV strains were not cytopathic in most cell types tested, including fibroblasts. no easily available animal model for rubella virus pathology exists. changes in tissue tropism of iVDRVs would be a significant observation. mutant spectrum complexity could be a factor in predicting disease progression and response to antivirals. a viral population structure in chronically infected patients could be more complicated than currently appreciated. a viral population structure in chronically infected patients could be more complicated. RNA editing by the host ADAR system has been proposed as a factor of evolution of many positive and negative-sense RNA viruses. the ability of APOBEC3 family members to restrict viral replication has been reported only for four RNA viruses, measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus. more studies are needed to assign RV RNA editing activity to specific members of the APOBEC family. the majority of amino acid substitutions were specific for iVDRV strains. many of them occurred in positions that are invariant in wtRV. the structural proteins were less constrained with E1 being more conserved than C or E2. poor understanding of antigenic structure of RA27/3 vaccine and wtRV strains hampers investigations of possible mechanisms of iVDRV escape from immune surveillance. the observed lack of viremia in all three tested patients was most likely due to continual removal of iVDRV from the bloodstream by these neutralizing antibodies. hepatitis C specific IgM antibody has been observed in patients with chronic hepatitis. hepatitis C specific IgM antibody has been observed in patients with chronic hepatitis and their levels correlate with the level of viral replication and treatment outcome. iVDRV secretion by these individuals may have implications for rubella and CRS elimination programs. iVDRV evolution in a PID host and properties of persistent iVDRV can be drawn from the analysis of the limited number of diagnostic biopsy samples described here. we hypothesize that cellular immune defects delay viral clearance and exacerbate what would be a limited persistent infection in persons with normal immunity. however, we cannot accurately predict the effect of mutations found here on teratogenic potential from the tissue culture results presented here. in granuloma, iVDRV is only 1.3 years compared to decades-long RV replication in granuloma. poliovirus and influenza virus are also under purifying selection. but selection for and against specific changes is found as well. this is the first study detailing mRNA editing signatures associated with APOBEC enzymes in an RNA virus. iVDRV genome is under negative selection and random genetic drift is the primary mechanism for the evolution of iVDRV genomes with positive selection playing a role. results may provide information useful in designing therapies for PID patients with granulomas associated with rubella vaccine. s paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks of skin biopsies for LA, RI and OR case patients were also submitted to the CDC for testing. verbal consent was obtained from the OR case patient and parent for diagnostic skin biopsy and documented in the patient's chart. a modified virus isolation technique allowed improved recovery of infectious virus from samples containing low amounts of RV. 1x104 cells were seeded on chamber slides after each transfer of cells into a larger flask. high titer P4 virus stocks were harvested either at day 14 or day 21. rubella, measles and mumps serology Rubella IgG titers were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) with the ZEUS ELISA Rubella IgG Test System (ZEUS Scientific, Branchburg, NJ) titers were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) with the ZEUS ELISA Rubella IgG Test System. at 36 dpi, phase contrast images were taken with a fluorescent inverted microscope. the remaining cells in mock infected and infected well were collected by trypsinization and counted using a Scepter cell counter. infected cells were immunostained for E1 at 2 dpi (RA27/3), 3 dpi (LA3331 and CA6944), 4 dpi (RI6318) or 6 dpi (OR5810) as described. the neutralization titer of a serum sample expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution of the serum that neutralized 50% of added virus was calculated by a dose-response regression analysis using Graph-Pad P sequences were aligned using the Muscle algorithm [78] and alignments were annotated according to the RA27/3 genome using Geneious software version 11.1.2 (Biomatters LTD) the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and nonsynonymous substitution per nonsynonymous site (dN), the dN/dS ratios and the average behavior of each codon for synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations were calculated.

Mutation signature analysis We first created the list of 993 (out of 1074) mutations in which ambiguous nucleotides were excluded from the analysis (S1 Data) these mutations were used to evaluate enrichment of APOBEC mutation signatures and the prediction scores for ADAR activity. the prediction scores for ADAR activity on adenines were generated using the web-based tool InosinePredict and [85]. all four patients received MMR vaccination at about one year of age and one patient received the second dose at age 5. no pathogenic organisms were identified by the histochemical staining or bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures. the RI case patient was deceased at age 19 years. cell cultures Vero cells (ATCC #CCL81) and human primary fetal fibroblasts WI-38 (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals) half of each snap-frozen skin biopsy was used for virus culture. high titer virus stocks were harvested either at day 14 or day 21. a bioreactor was described elsewhere. the iVDRV isolates were passaged in vero cells three additional times using our standard protocol. titers in the medium were determined by titration on vero cells using immunocolorimetric assay. the cells were then fixed with 100% methanol, stained for E1 by immunofluorescence assay. the percentage of infected cells was determined as previously described. 50 l of each serum dilution and 50 l of each virus strain (50\u2013100 ffu) were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 hour. a serum sample from a donor lacking RV neutralizing antibody was included in each assay as a negative control. a serum sample from a donor lacking RV neutralizing antibody was included in each assay as a negative control. real-time RT-qPCR for rubella, measles and mumps viruses has been described elsewhere. five overlapping genomic fragments were produced by RT-PCR using primers listed in Table 4. sequences of genomic ends were determined using the 5\u2019/3\u2019 RACE kit as directed by the manufacturer. PCR fragments were cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector. PCR fragments were cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector. genebank accession numbers Complete sequences of iVDRV genomes have been deposited in the NCBI database under accession numbers MK787188\u2014MK787191 and MK780807- MK780812. the structures of the rubella E1 protein (PDB entries 4ADG, 4ADI and 4ADJ) were used as templates for computer modeling. this Table displays bases in DNA format to allow compatibility and comparison with mutation signature outputs of APOBEC mutagenesis in DNA. this allowed us to minimize possible distortion of enrichment calculations by the influence of local RNA secondary structure on mutagenesis. ines were generated using the web-based tool InosinePredict. a one-sided test for the prediction scores was performed to obtain P-values shown above the scatter plots. the list of 993 (out of 1074) mutations in iVDRV RVs genomes with unambiguously identified base substitutions.
