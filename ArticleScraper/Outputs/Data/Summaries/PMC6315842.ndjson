{"summary": "the one health concept dates back to the ancient world and was compatible with the dominating scientific philosophy of the time, the theory of humours. as early as 350 BC, Aristoteles (384 BCE\u2013322 BCE) presents the first documented approach to comparative medicine. he diversified humans from animals through their possession of a rational soul. a pioneering epidemiologist, physician and veterinarian, was the author of papers in which he identified the role the environment plays in the spread of diseases both to human and to animals. the seventeenth and eighteen century movements provided great insight and proved ancient Greek theories were correct in principle by bringing humans and animals into even greater proximity. he correlated human and animal diseases with climatic and geographical conditions. macrocycles in one health are built around contemporary scientific knowledge. the 1860s\u20131870s marked the development of the germ theory. in france, Louis Pasteur (1822\u20131895) discovered the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization. avian and pandemic influenza outbreaks have urged funding agencies and international organizations to include wildlife in their studies. this special issue was assembled with the intention of collecting diverse experiences and points of view of colleagues who share the One Health methodology. we have stimulated authors to look into novel frontiers of One Health. the big data environment, the \u201comics\u201d revolution, social media, and scientific and technological breakthroughs offer great opportunities to expand the frontiers of existing areas of research and to create novel ones."}
