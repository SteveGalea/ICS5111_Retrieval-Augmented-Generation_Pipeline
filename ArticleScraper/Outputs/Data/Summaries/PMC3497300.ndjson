{"summary": "the identification of chemical leads against these targets is a key step in the drug discovery process. starting-points for chemical leads include natural products, high throughput screening of large chemical libraries, and most recently fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) the latter is a method that has evolved over the past 20 years for generating high affinity ligands. fragment libraries tend to be smaller in size (in the order of 103 compounds) compared with libraries of larger compounds used in HTS. fragment-screening techniques need sufficient sensitivity to detect hits with Kd values in the mM to high M range. validation of hits is a vital component of the FBDD strategy. it should include a technique to estimate binding affinity. ITC is highly sensitive and can be used to determine binding affinity. fragment libraries tend to be biased toward planar, achiral heterocycles. fragments richer in sp3-centres should result in increased hits on distinct sites on biological targets. a recent study on the size of chemical space estimated to be as high as 1060 compounds. all libraries use the aforementioned \u201crule of three\u201d criteria [21] and in several cases, additional (proprietary) filters for shape and chemistry in library development. the most important requirement for crystallographic FBS is the availability of target protein crystals for which a structure solution is available. techniques and tools are available to aid in the crystallization of difficult targets. proteases are used to form stable fragments of proteins for crystallization. this strategy may fail due to incomplete proteolysis leading to sample heterogeneity. protein crystallizability can be improved by protein engineering. a free cysteine residue (C162) in kinase p38 was prone to modification. in fragment screening, crystals are typically soaked in cocktails containing 3\u201310 compounds. the hit rate should be less than one compound per cocktail so as to avoid ambiguous electron density resulting from multiple hits bound with partial occupancies. commonly used CCDs are made up of a two-dimensional array of p-n diodes joined to a readout chip. PADs enable readout times of less than 5 milliseconds compared with about 1 s for CCDs. commercial packages include PrimeX by Schr\u00f6dinger (New York, NY, USA), Rhofit by Global Phasing (Cambridge, UK) and Afitt by OpenEye (Santa Fe, NM, USA). the autoSolve platform developed by Astex Therapeutics automates X-ray data processing, structure solution and the interpretation of electron density maps. uncertainties in the placement of asparagine, glutamine and histidine occur because of their internal pseudo-symmetry. in the case of asparagine and glutamine, the side-chain N and O atoms of the imidazole ring will usually be indistinguishable. structures of ligands found in complexes with biological molecules may be less reliable than those of the macromolecule itself. crystal structure modeling programs, e.g., COOT [43] can generate geometric restraints for ligands based on SMILES strings. potential blocking of target site by crystal contacts can result in false-negatives upon soaking ligands. lipinski and co-workers analyzed a diverse set of fragment hits against a range of targets. they developed the so-called \u201crule of three\u201d [21]. fragment libraries tend to be biased toward planar, achiral heterocycles. the number of fragments in the cocktail is dictated by the required concentration and the concentration of DMSO tolerated by the crystals. the number of fragments in the cocktail is dictated by the required concentration and the concentration of DMSO tolerated by the crystals. techniques in molecular biology and protein chemistry can aid in crystallization of difficult targets. proteins produced naturally or through recombinant expression may contain flexible or disordered regions. removal of flexible and heterogeneous glycosidic groups to improve crystallizability is a well-established strategy. a single-point mutant, F185K, showed a dramatically improved solubility. in mutants where a single hydrophobic amino acid was targeted, it was changed to lysine. in mutants in which two or three hydrophobic amino acids were changed simultaneously, more conservative substitutions for alanine were made. there are over 140 such beamlines available worldwide. the intensity of synchrotron X-radiation facilitates short data collection times. the most popular detectors for synchrotron utilize charge-coupled device (CCD) robot systems for sample changing on synchrotron beamlines include the Stanford Automated Mounter (SAM), the ACTORTM system (Rigaku, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the ALS Automounter. diffraction experiments and data collection runs can be controlled at the synchrotron or remotely using the Blu-Ice/Distribute Control System. the use of X-ray crystal structures in fragment screening and lead design is non-trivial and depends on the skill of the crystallographer. the automation of electron density maps (such as that provided by the aforementioned AutoSolve platform) is inherently objective, but unambiguous interpretations can only be produced if recognizable shapes are present in the difference maps. ligands may exhibit greater thermal motion or conformational disorder than the surrounding protein, leading to poor electron density. ligands may exhibit greater thermal motion or conformational disorder than the surrounding protein. ligands may exhibit greater thermal motion or conformational disorder than the surrounding protein, leading to poor electron density. crystals of the drug target, lactose dehydrogenase A were not appropriate for soaking because the active site loop was held open by crystal contacts. residues surrounding the site of interest could be held in an inappropriate conformation for ligand binding, or could be blocked by other ligands. se by crystallography (Section 3.3) provides an interesting case of cooperative fragment binding (from fragments soaked into crystals in cocktails) complementary use of NMR and crystallography in the development of Hsp90 inhibitors is described. structure-based design of potent and ligand-efficient inhibitors of CTX-M class A -lactamase -lactamase CTX-M docking/X-ray crystallography SPR [64] Discovery and optimization of new benzimidazole- and benzoxazole-Pyrimidone Selective PI3K Inhibitors for the Treatment of Phosphatase and TENsin homologue (PTEN)-Deficient Cancer ase is known to cleave amyloid precursor protein to yield the N-terminus of the -amyloid peptides. beta secretase-1 is an aspartyl protease responsible for -amyloid production and this enzyme is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of AD. fragments were ranked and 65 were selected for crystallographic screening against BACE-1. 2-Amino-3-(benzylamino)pyridine (Figure 2c) was found to bind with an IC50 of 310 M. a cyclic secondary amine, 4-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperidine (Figure 2d) was also identified from virtual screening. the next compound synthesized was the indole-substituted aminopyridine (IC50 = 94 M) which displayed more favorable interactions with the S1 pocket compared with the phenyl-substituted compound. a 3-methoxy-biaryl group replaced the indole substituent (IC50 = 25 M) which also made favorable interactions with the pocket. 2-amino-3-((3-(5-methoxypyridin-3-yl)benzyl)amino)pyridine; 2-amino-3-((3-(5-methoxypyridin-3-yl)benzyl)amino)pyridine; 2-amino-3-((3-(5-propyloxypyridin-3-yl)benzyl)amino)pyridine. cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) family of enzymes is a potential target for therapeutics for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, depression and neurodegenerative diseases. human PDE4A is difficult to crystallize, making screening by crystallography impractical. the hydrolysis of cAMP measured at 21 \u00b0C. the assay was validated using the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors pentoxifylline and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) a 160-compound fragment library was screened for competitive inhibitors. hPNMT human phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (hPNMT) catalyses the last step in adrenaline synthesis. a cocktail was considered to be a false positive if examination failed to identify a specific fragment. a total of 12 compounds were ultimately identified, binding in the noradrenaline-binding site. a series of simulations and re-assessment of the electron density led to a model in which compounds shown in Figure 7a,b are bound cooperatively. the structures corresponding to these structural interpretations are shown in Figure 8. Hsp90 inhibitors work synergistically with several other drugs in the treatment of both solid tumors and leukemias. about 1600 compounds were screened against Hsp90 using ligand observed NMR via waterLOGSY. the pyridine ring substituted for phenyl groups with methoxy- and chloro- substitutions at the 2- and 6-positions. these substitutions relieved the strain and better filled the proximal lipophilic pocket. the result was the incorporation of an N-ethylmorpholino-group at the 5-position of the phenyl ring. radicicol, a known Hsp90 inhibitor, was developed into drug candidates. the final lead was developed into drug candidates under clinical trial. a library containing 347 fragments was screened in cocktails. two hits containing aminopyridine motifs formed hydrogen bonds with catalytic aspartate residues D32 and D228. in both cases the amine groups form hydrogen bonds with D228 and the protonated pyridine group donates a hydrogen bond to D32. this charged bidentate interaction had not been described previously in aspartyl proteases. a phenyl group was predicted to make suitable hydrophobic interactions with the S1 region. the next compound synthesized was the indole-substituted aminopyridine (IC50 = 94 M), which displayed more favorable interactions with the S1 pocket compared with the phenyl-substituted compound. biaryl substituted 2,3-diaminopyridines were synthesized to better fit the S1-S3. 3-pyridyl group introduced into these compounds appeared to form favorable contacts with the pocket. the best compound in this series had an n-propyloxy group in place of the methoxy group (IC50 = 24 M) this compound was considered to be a high quality lead and was prioritized for further development. two ligands were made containing a 2-pyridinylmethyloxy group or benzyloxy group. the benzyloxy-containing compound was too insoluble to allow high-quality crystal structure determination. the benzyloxy-containing compound is the most potent inhibitor with IC50 of 690 nM. enthalpy arrays perform enzyme activity-based fragment screen for inhibitors of PDE4A activity. array uses small sample volumes (250 nL) and short assay times (typically 5 to 10 min) not possible in conventional calorimetry. cAMP contains a purine ring; 4-[3-(methoxyphenyl)amino]-6-(methylsulfonyl)quinoline-3-carboxamide contain a quinoline system. ligand nitrogen atoms accept a hydrogen bond from active-site residue Q581. the use of enthalpy arrays in fragment screening has several benefits. a cocktail was considered a false positive if examination of the electron density failed to identify a specific fragment. a total of 12 compounds were ultimately identified, binding in the noradrenaline-binding site. 3 compounds were ruled out. heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an ATP dependent molecular chaperone that modulates protein stability. many client proteins of Hsp90 have been identified and several are involved in cellular signaling. over-expression of Hsp90 has been demonstrated in cancer types. the pyrimidine moiety binds in a structurally analogous way to the purine ring of ADP. the molecule forms an extensive network of hydrogen bonds with the side chain of D93 and water molecules. a 4-chloro-substitution on the ring further improved occupancy of the lipophilic pocket. the structure of the complex of this fragment with Hsp90 indicated that the methoxy-group could be replaced with substituents that occupied the proximal lipophilic pocket. a tert-butyl or isopropyl group at this position improved the affinity 100-fold. the carbonyl group was kept to maintain the hydrogen-bond with an adjacent threonine residue and adjacent water molecules. crystallography has contributed to the development of nanomolar IC50. in the case of BACE-1 inhibitors, the screening program benefited from the new enthalpy array technology to pre-select fragments."}
