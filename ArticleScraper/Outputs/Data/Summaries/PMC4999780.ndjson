{"summary": "there are approximately 22,000 malignant primary brain tumors diagnosed each year in the united states, with malignant gliomas accounting for the majority of these cases. this dismal prognosis is due in part to the lack of therapeutic options for patients diagnosed with these tumors. the current standard-of-care for GBM includes surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. complex nature of the immune response in the central nervous system poses a unique challenge to the field of brain tumor immunotherapy. tumor immunotherapy is particularly challenging due to the specialized relationship between the CNS and the immune system. ts in the periphery suggest the afferent and efferent arms of the immune system are intact in the CNS, contrary to initial hypotheses. more recent studies have examined the efflux of proteins out of the CNS and found fluid (carrying potential antigens) leaving the brain enters the blood or drains to the ipsilateral cervical lymph nodes. a new concept in neuroimmunology has emerged. immunotherapy for tumors within the CNS requires overcoming hurdles. despite complex nature of CNS immunology, immunotherapy for the treatment of brain tumors is still an active area of research. treatment of mouse models with antibodies targeted to EGFRvIII has resulted in tumor regression. similar therapies have entered clinical trials for EGFRvIII and IL13RA2 specific CAR therapy. mAb against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is a regulatory receptor upregulated on activated T cells. ipilimumab allows for sustained signaling through CD28 to occur without inhibition, effectively \u201cremoving the brakes\u201d from the immune response. costimulatory molecules include members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, such as 4-1BB, glucocorticoid-induced TNFR (GITR) and OX40. several approaches have been used to activate costimulatory signaling pathways including, agonistic mAb and ligand fusion proteins. control of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases may be achieved by inhibiting these signals. the majority of these peptides are MHC I-restricted epitopes generated with the intent to stimulate the CD8 T cell response to tumor [56] this approach excludes CD4 T cell activation or incorporation of additional immune cell responses. human epidermal growth factor 2 (Her2) is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast cancers. administration of Herceptin\u00ae (trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against Her2) has shown efficacy in Her2 positive breast cancer patients. treatment of mouse models with antibodies targeting EGFRvIII has resulted in tumor regression. ipilimumab is a humanized mAb against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), a regulatory receptor upregulated on activated T cells. ipilimumab allows for sustained signaling through CD28 to occur without inhibition, effectively \u201cremoving the brakes\u201d from the immune response. blocking CLTA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 allows for the potentiation of an antitumor response in a non-specific manner. several additional costimulatory molecules are upregulated on the surface of the APCs and T cells. these additional costimulatory molecules include members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. DC vaccines account for the majority of ongoing clinical trials for brain tumors. these clinical trials have been well tolerated by the patients. these clinical trials have shown promising signs of immune response correlating with radiographic response and modest improvements in overall survival. despite multiple papers indicating activation of a Th1 response to vaccine none of these therapies has moved past phase III clinical trials or demonstrated cure in patients. overemphasis on CD8 T cell stimulation may be a factor hindering progress in therapeutic efficacy. the focus on CD8 T cells as the central immune cell for tumor clearance is well reasoned. however, there are a number of limitations to this approach in many cancers. despite the immune suppression of CD8 T cell response many other immune cells are in the CNS. CD4 T cells themselves have been described as more efficient at tumor rejection than CD8 T cells. there is evidence for \u201ccytotoxic\u201d CD4 T cells, particularly in viral infection models. the absence of CD4 signaling results in progressive loss of CD8 activity over time. tumor-secreting cytokines are responsible for recruitment of naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs) and the conversion of CD4 Th cells into inducible Tregs (iTregs) at the tumor site. the suppressive capacity of these cells is a major hurdle to overcome when developing an effective antitumor response. NK cells can infiltrate the CNS in human GBM and mouse models. mouse models continue to provide evidence for the importance of NK cells in tumor clearance and immunotherapy. NK cells can infiltrate the CNS in human GBM and mouse models. mouse models of GBM suggesting innate immune cells are crucial for efficacy of immunotherapy. macrophages can be divided into two main subsets, conventionally activated M1 macrophages or alternatively activated M2 macrophages. agonist anti-CD40 antibody was expected to promote antigen presentation by DC leading to enhanced CTL activity. tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) have correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer patients, including glioma. the function of these cells depends of the microenvironment, with polarization of these cells into pro-tumor (N2) or anti-tumor (N1) neutrophils dependent of the cytokine milieu. mast cell involvement in cancer has presented conflicting reports of both pro- and anti-tumor roles. the involvement of mast cells in tumor biology and immunotherapy has been more extensively reviewed elsewhere. the role of mast cells in gliomas and the potential to therapeutically alter their function to promote tumor clearance remains to be seen. the role of mast cells in gliomas is necessary to provide crucial cues to surrounding cells and generally orchestrate the immune response to tumors or pathogens. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4 T cells with the capacity to negatively regulate the immune response, maintaining homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled immune responses and autoimmunity. cytokines are responsible for recruitment of naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs) and the conversion of CD4 Th cells into inducible Tregs (iTregs) at the tumor site. NK cells are also able to kill antibody coated target cells through antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), in which the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin protein binds the Fc receptor (FcR) on an effector cell. NK cells can infiltrate the CNS in human GBM and mouse models. the role of B cells as APCs is less studied than DC. the role of an antibody response in the efficacy of immunotherapy for brain tumors has been diminished. a correlation between the presence of tumor-reactive antibodies in GBM patients and survival has been diminished. tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) have correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer patients, including glioma, and have been viewed as a potential target in immunotherapeutic approaches [89,90,91] tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) have correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer patients, including glioma. myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC) MDSC constitute a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells in which terminal differentiation is blocked by tumor-derived cytokines. elevated levels of circulating or tumor-localized MDSC have been associated with poor prognosis in a number of tumors. there is a shortage of data concerning mast cells in gliomas. a greater number of mast cells were seen in human GBMs compared to grade II gliomas, suggesting a tumor-promoting role of mast cells. the role of mast cells in gliomas and the potential to therapeutically alter their function to promote tumor clearance remains to be seen. recruitment of a combination of immune responses may generate an overwhelming antitumor immune response, overcoming immune suppression and resulting in tumor clearance. the failure of current therapy for GBM may be due to a lack of incorporation of the full immune response for glioma."}
