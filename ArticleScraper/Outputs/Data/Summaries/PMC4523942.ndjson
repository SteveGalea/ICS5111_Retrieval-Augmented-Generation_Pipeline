{"summary": "the filamentous bacteriophage (genera Inovirus and Plectrovirus) are non-enveloped, rod-shaped viruses of Escherichia coli. the first filamentous phage, f1, was isolated in Loeb (1960) and later characterized as a member of a larger group of phage (Ff, including f1, M13, and fd phage) specific for the E. coli conjugative F pilus. many excellent reviews are available on phage-display libraries and their applications. the phage has a number of unique structural and biological properties that make it highly useful in areas of research that have received far less attention. a final section is dedicated to recent developments in filamentous phage ecology. the display mode determines the maximum tolerated size of the fused polypeptide, its copy number on the phage, and potentially, the structure of the displayed polypeptide. display may be achieved by fusing DNA encoding a polypeptide of interest directly to the gene encoding a coat protein within the phage genome. for the purposes of this review, we use the term \u201cphage display\u201d to refer to a recombinant filamentous phage displaying a single polypeptide sequence on its surface. the term \u201cphage-displayed library\u201d to refer to a diverse pool of recombinant filamentous phage displaying an array of polypeptide variants (e.g., antibody fragments; peptides) such libraries are typically screened by iterative cycles of panning pVIII Fully recombinant (landscape phage; type 8 system) No 27003 5\u20138 residues Kishchenko et al.

(1991), and Fernandez (2004) pIX Fully recombinant ( the idea of using the phage as carrier to elicit antibodies against poorly immunogenic haptens or polypeptide was a natural extension of the ability to display recombinant exogenous sequences on its surface. the phage particle\u2019s low cost of production, high stability and potential for high valency display of foreign antigen also made it attractive as a vaccine carrier. protein 1 were immunogenic in mice and rabbits. antibodies raised against the latter cross-reacted with the full-length protein. peptide vaccines are no longer an area of active research. studies using filamentous phage as an immunogenic carrier for peptide B-cell epitopes.

(2000) showed that a cytotoxic T-cell epitope from HIV-1 reverse transcriptase could elicit antigen-specific CTLs in vitro and in vivo without addition of exogenous helper T-cell epitopes. efficient priming of CTLs was observed against phage-displayed T-cell epitopes from Hepatitis B virus. a primary goal of vaccine-induced immune protection for infectious diseases is to elicit therapeutic CTL responses. a primary goal of cancer vaccines is to elicit therapeutic CTL responses and/or suppress CD4+ regulatory T cells against tumor antigens. melanoma tumor CTL epitopes elicited anti-B16 tumor CTL responses. despite their large size, filamentous phage particles can elicit vigorous CTL responses. despite their large size, filamentous phage particles can elicit vigorous CTL responses compared to soluble exogenous proteins. hepatitis B core antigen and hepatitis B surface antigen all elicited antibody responses when displayed on pIII. none of these studies compared immunogenicity of phage-displayed proteins with that of the purified protein alone. the filamentous phage may trigger different types of immune responses than recombinant protein antigens. the low copy number of pIII-displayed proteins, as well as potentially unwanted phage-associated adjuvanticity can make display of recombinant proteins a suboptimal vaccine choice. no published study has directly compared the effect of administration route on filamentous phage immunogenicity. antibodies are generated against only three major sites on the virion. the filamentous phage activates innate immunity (macrophages, neutrophils, and possibly natural killer cells) the phage likely activates T-cell independent antibody responses, either via phage-associated TLR ligands or cross-linking by the pVIII lattice. anti-phage TH2 responses were enhanced through display of CTLA-4 peptides fused to pIII. the filamentous phage is self-adjuvanting through multiple mechanisms. the phage particle is self-adjuvanting through multiple mechanisms. innate immunity plays an important but largely uncharacterized role in activation of anti-phage adaptive immune responses. the first filamentous phage-based vaccine immunogens displayed short amino acid sequences derived directly from proteins of interest as recombinant fusions to pVIII or pIII. some of the pioneering work in this area used peptides derived from infectious disease antigens (or peptide ligands of antibodies against these antigens; Table 2). the list of animal and human infections for which phage-displayed peptide immunogens have been developed continues to expand and includes bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens. in many cases, peptides incompletely or inadequately mimic epitopes on folded proteins. gillus fumigatus MIRB Mouse (BALB/c) Linear Chemical conjugate + + Raymond-Bouchard et al.

(2008) Candida albicans HSP90 Mouse (C57BL6/, BALB/c) MHC class II pVIII hybrid + Yang e min CTL epitope on pVIII and an scFv against DEC-205 (a dendritic cell marker) on pIII could elicit stronger anti-B16 tumor CTL responses that further improved survival rates. filamentous phage virion may induce stronger and more durable CTL responses compared to soluble exogenous proteins. two studies of anti-idiotypic vaccines have used the phage as a carrier for antibody fragments bearing immunogenic idiotypes. the phage displaying the 1E10 idiotype scFv elicited antibodies that protected flounder fish from Vibrio anguillarum challenge. a chemically linked phage-BCL1 tumor-specific idiotype vaccine was weakly immunogenic in mice. the phage particle is immunogenic without adjuvant in all species tested to date. no published study has directly compared effect of administration route on filamentous phage immunogenicity. antibodies are generated against only three major sites on the virion. serum antibody titers against the phage typically reach 1:105\u20131:106 after 2\u20133 immunizations. primary antibody responses against the phage appear to be composed of a mixture of IgM and IgG2b isotypes. secondary antibody responses are composed primarily of IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes. anti-phage antibody titers appear to be partially T-cell dependent. many circulating pVIII-specific B cells in the blood are devoid of somatic mutation even after repeated biweekly immunizations. phage particles can be processed by antigen-presenting cells and presented on MHC class II molecules. virion\u2019s immunogenicity and its removal by polymyxin B chromatography reduces antibody titers against phage coat proteins. the phage\u2019s single-stranded DNA genome contains CpG motifs. the antibody response against the phage is entirely dependent on MyD88 signaling and is modulated by stimulation of several toll-like receptors. filamentous phage engineered to express either BglII restriction endonuclease (Hagens and Blasi, 2003; Hagens et al., 2004) or a lethal catabolite gene activator protein (Moradpour et al., 2009) effectively killed E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells. phage encoding a GFP expression cassette and displaying a HER2-specific scFv on pIII were internalized into breast tumor cells. phage displaying either a targeting peptide or antibody fragment and tethered to chloramphenicol by a labile crosslinker were more potent inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus growth than high-concentration free chloramphenicol. specific for tumor antigens delayed tumor growth and improved survival, owing in large part to activation of tumor-associated macrophages and recruitment of neutrophils to the tumor site. phage displaying an immunodominant peptide epitope derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein depleted pathogenic demyelinating antibodies in brain tissue. filamentous phage is a therapeutic for autoantibody-mediated autoimmune conditions. phage displaying immunodominant autoantigen epitopes can selectively deplete autoantibodies of defined specificities. the filamentous phage\u2019s production in bacteria complicates its use in humans. many types of bacteriophage and engineered phage variants have been proposed for prophylactic use ex vivo in food safety. filamentous phage displaying a tetracysteine tag on pIII were used to detect E. coli cells through staining with biarsenical dye. biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance (Nanduri et al., 2007), piezoelectric transducers (Olsen e filamentous phage is enclosed by a rod-like protein capsid, 1000 nm long and 5 nm wide, made up almost entirely of overlapping pVIII monomers. each of which lies 27 angstroms from its nearest neighbor. the regularity of the phage pVIII lattice and its diversity of chemically addressable groups make it an ideal scaffold for bioconjugation. interest in the filamentous phage as a building block for nanomaterials has been growing because of its unique physicochemical properties. it has long been known that above a certain concentration threshold, phage can form ordered crystalline suspensions. this pioneering work became the basis for construction of two- and three-dimensional nanomaterials with more advanced architectures. Nam et al. (2006) produced a thin, flexible lithium ion battery. it could be stamped onto platinum microband current collectors. pIII-display of single-walled carbon nanotube-binding peptides. the filamentous phage has additional practical uses in protein engineering and directed protein evolution due to its unique tolerance of genetic modifications that allow biomolecules to be displayed on the virion surface. libraries of variant Fabs and single chain antibodies can be generated via random or site-directed mutagenesis and selected on the basis of improved or altered binding. Esvelt et al. (2011) elegantly linked phage infectivity and production of offspring with the presence of a desired protein phenotype. PACE selection stringency could be modulated by providing small amounts of pIII independently of protein phenotype. this approach represents a promising avenue for both basic research in molecular evolution. there was some evidence of seasonal fluctuation of filamentous phage populations in tandem with the relative abundance of free-living heterotrophic bacteria. the existing data suggest that filamentous phage comprise minor constituents of viral communities in freshwater. but have much higher frequencies in wastewater and sewage. filamentous phage treatment has been proposed as a hypothetical means of inhibiting bacterial conjugation and horizontal gene transfer. the filamentous phage may also play a future role in the preservation of biodiversity of other organisms in at-risk ecosystems. the filamentous phage represents a highly versatile organism. its uses extend far beyond traditional phage display and affinity selection of antibodies and polypeptides of desired specificity. it is likely to retain its position as a workhorse for therapeutic antibody discovery for many years to come. could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
