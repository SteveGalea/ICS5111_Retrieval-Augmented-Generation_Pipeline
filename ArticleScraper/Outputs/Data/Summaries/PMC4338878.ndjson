{"summary": "around 350 to 400 million people are chronically infected, many of whom are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) the outcome of HBV infection is thought to be the result of complex interactions between replicating HBV and the host immune system. significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding how the innate immune system detects nonself DNA molecules or DNA-containing pathogens. the downstream signaling activated by most of these DNA sensors converges on an essential signal transducer, the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) (21\u201324) pIFN--Luc (Rongtuan Lin, McGill University, Canada); pEF-STING and p-55C1B-Luc (Takashi Fujita, Kyoto University, Japan); pFlag-MITA, pcDNA3.1-HA-MITA, pFlag-TRIM32, and pFlag-TRIM56 (Hongbing Shu, Wuhan University, China); and pcDNA3.1-CMV-HBV1.1 mutants pHA-Ub-K48R and pHA-Ub-K63 were derived from pcDNA3-HA-Ub. mutants pHA-Ub-K48R and pHA-Ub-K63 were mutated to arginines. anti-actin, anti-Flag M2, anti-GFP, and anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. anti-TRIM32 antibody was a gift from Hongbing Shu (Wuhan University, China) proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was purchased from Calbiochem. cGAMP and poly(dA dT) were purchased from Biolog and Amersham Biosciences. the cell pellet containing PHHs was resuspended in the plating medium of Williams E medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 g ml1 transferrin, 5 ng ml1 sodium selenite, 3 g ml1 insulin, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 g ml1 penicillin, and 100 g ml1 streptomycin. at approximate 100 genome equivalent copies of HBV per cell (1 volume of infectious pooled sera from 10 chronic hepatitis B patients diluted in 10 volumes of culture medium) after incubation, cells were rinsed three times. the HBeAg secretion and the viral DNA in the medium were determined every 2 or 3 days postinfection. the cells successfully infected with HBV were processed for further treatment. feron-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) and human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were expressed as the mean fold induction SD relative to control levels. transcript of IFN- and ISG56 was normalized to that of GAPDH. the supernatants were collected, precleared with protein A/G Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 30 min, and incubated with anti-Flag or anti-HA antibodies at 4\u00b0C. the immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in 1% (wt/vol) sample buffer. hek293T cells in a 60-mm-diameter dish were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000. cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid Huh7 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate and transfected with the indicated plasmids. after 36 h, the cells were mock treated or treated with 100 nM cGAMP for 16 h. pHBV1.3, pFlag-Pol (pcDNA3.1-Flag-Pol and pQCXIP-Flag-Pol) mutants of pol, pcDNA3.1-Flag-Core, pcDNA3.1-Flag-Core, pcDNA3.1-Flag-Precore, pcDNA3.1-Flag-HBsAg, pFlag-TBK1, pHA-RIG-I, pCMV-Myc-Pol in mutant pHA-Ub-K48R, all lysines except at position 63 were mutated to arginines. pRL-TK was purchased from Promega. Newcastle disease virus tagged with green fluorescent protein (NDV-GFP) was propagated and purified from chicken eggs maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions. HepAD38 cells were grown in presence or absence of 1 g ml1 doxycycline (Dox) to regulate HBV pregenomic RNA transcription. a simian virus 40 large T antigen-immortalized nonneoplastic human hepatic cell line with intact capacity for type I IFN induction was maintained as described previously. the dHepaRG cells or PHHs were incubated overnight with HBV-positive sera at around 100 genome equivalent copies of HBV per cell (1 volume of infectious pooled sera from 10 chronic hepatitis B patients diluted in 10 volumes of culture medium) the cells successfully infected with HBV were processed for further treatment and experiments at least 9 days postinfection. 24-well plate were cultured overnight and then transfected with the indicated stimulator plasmid (such as pSTING), a reporter plasmid (pIFN-Luc, or p-55C1B-Luc), and the indicated plasmids using either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Fugene HP (Roche) at 36 h posttransfection, cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer and assayed using a dual-luci the level of IFN- in the culture medium was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for human IFN- (PBL Interferon Source) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3 105 HEK293 cells were seeded into a 12-well plate, cultured overnight, and then transfected with the indicated amounts of pEF-STING and pQCXIP-Flag-Pol. after 24 h, cells were selected with puromycin (1.5 g ml1) for 36 h. HEK293T cells in a 60-mm-diameter dish were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Vero cells in 24-well plate were incubated with the filtered Huh7 supernatants overnight. then challenged with 80 hemagglutinin units (HAU) ml1 of NDV-GFP for an additional 24 h. RESULTS HBV inhibits STING-mediated IFN- induction and the antiviral immune response. ation was tested using the reporter plasmid p-55C1B-Luc. the luciferase expression was driven by a promoter containing repeated IRF-binding sites. the results showed that HBV effectively inhibited the STING-mediated IFN- induction and antiviral response. 125 ng, 250 ng, or 500 ng of pHBV1.3 together with pSTING (25 ng) or empty vector. the remaining supernatants from Huh7 cells were collected and transferred to Vero cells for overnight incubation with a positive control. cGAMP has been identified as a specific upstream activator of STING to induce type I IFN production (19, 20, 38, 39) cGAMP expression was barely detectable in Huh7 cells and HepaAD38 cells. cGAMP-STING-mediated signaling pathway was suppressed by HBV. supernatants from cGAMP- and IFN-treated Huh7 cells lost antiviral activity depending on the transfected dose. cGAMP-stimulated IFN- promoter activation in the stably HBV-producing cell line was remarkably decreased in the presence of HBV. the cGAMP-elicited IFN- gene production in HBV-infected cells was obviously lower than that in uninfected cells. the results indicated that HBV may have developed strategies to evade the STING-mediated host antiviral immune responses. 93 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding HBV Pol and STING. expression of Pol resulted in decreased production of both IFN- and ISG56 mRNAs. the results showed that the expression of Pol resulted in decreased production of both IFN- and ISG56 mRNAs. 293 cells were cotransfected with pQCXIP-Flag-Pol (300 ng or 600 ng) and pSTING (200 ng) the cells were harvested at 36 h posttransfection for the measurement of IFN- and ISG-56 mRNAs by quantitative RT-PCR. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were treated with puromycin (1.5 g ml1) for 36 h. the cells without the plasmids were transfected with poly(dA dT) for 8 h. the cells were then harvested for the measurement of IFN- mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. cGAMP and poly(dA dT) as STING activators. first, we used cGAMP as an IFN- stimulus. consistently, Pol also inhibited STING-mediated IFN- promoter activation upon cGAMP stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. similar results were obtained in Huh7 cells transfected with either the wild-type pCMV-HBV construct or the corresponding pol-null mutant pCMV-HBV-Pol. to test this point, we constructed the polymerase-inactive mutant pHBV1.3-YMHD, with which none of HBV DNA replication intermediates was detected. we tested its effect on the STING-mediated IFN- production in the context of viral replication. pol-expressing stable cell line 293T-Flag-Pol and control cell line 293T-GFP were transfected with HA-tagged STING. the results showed that the flag-tagged Pol could efficiently coprecipitate with the STING protein. however, we did not detect any interaction between Pol and the retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I) a series of truncated mutants of Pol were constructed. we cotransfected cells with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged truncated mutants. we examined the association between them by coimmunoprecipitation analysis. the results showed that HA-tagged STING could bind to full-length Pol, RT/RH, RT, and RH domains of Pol but barely to the TP/spacer region. plasmids encoding RT or RH domain of Pol were collected for luciferase assay. results showed that the inhibition of IFN- promoter activation was greatly inhibited in the cells expressing full-length Pol, RT/RH, RT, and RH. overexpression of the RT mutant reduced the IFN- promoter activation by approximately 50% compared to the control. RT domain of HBV polymerase makes relatively more of a contribution to the inhibition of STING-mediated IFN- induction by Pol. the binding affinity positively correlated with the degree of the inhibitory effect. a dramatic decrease in ubiquitination was observed in cells expressing Pol compared to that in control cells. the expression levels of STING in the presence and absence of HBV Pol expression remained comparable. the linkage of STING ubiquitination impaired by Pol is most likely K63. 293T cells transfected with HA-tagged STING and Flag-tagged Pol were treated with 20 mM MG132 for 6 h prior to harvest. whole-cell lysates (WCL) were blotted to evaluate expression of the indicated proteins (lower panels) -Actin expression was examined as a protein loading control. expression of truncated mutants of Pol downregulated K63-linked ubiquitination of STING to different extents. the greatest decrease exhibited by the full-length Pol, RT/RH domain, followed by the RT and RH mutants, and with a weak decrease exhibited by the TP/spacer and RH domains. analysis of the immunoprecipitated products showed that pol had little effect on the binding of STING to endogenous TRIM32. however, we failed to detect interaction between STING and endogenous TRIM56 in 293 cells. this may be because the expression of TRIM56 in the cells is rather low. two types of HBV replicative constructs, pHBV1.3 or pCMV-HBV. plasmids were cotransfected with pIFN-Luc (A) or p-55C1B-Luc (B), pRL-TK, and 100 ng, 200 ng, or 400 ng of the plasmid pHBV1.3 or pCMV-HBV together with pSTING (80 ng) or empty vector. the expression of STING in cells was examined by Western blotting. the level of core capsids was detected using anti-Core antibody. after 36 h, the cells were mock treated or treated with cGAMP for 16 h. doxycycline cells were mock treated or treated with 200 nM cGAMP. at day 10 after HBV infection, the cells were either collected for immunofluorescence or mock treated or treated with 200 nM cGAMP for 6 h. after 36 h, the cells were harvested for luciferase assay. reporter plasmids and plasmids containing HBV genome or control vectors were transfected into the cells. the amount of cGAMP-triggered IFN- production in Huh7 cells was also decreased in the presence of HBV replication in a dose-dependent manner. cGAMP-stimulated IFN- promoter activation in the hepaAD38 cell line. it expresses HBV under the control of an inducible tetracycline-off promoter. both 100 nM and 400 nM cGAMP-stimulated promoter activation were statistically lower, almost 35%, in the cells without doxycycline than in those with doxycycline. HBV polymerase (Pol) suppresses STING-induced IFN- production. to determine which viral proteins are responsible for the inhibition of STING-mediated IFN- induction by HBV, we performed a functional screening assay. the results showed that only expression of HBV Pol suppressed the IFN- promoter activation induced by ectopic expression of STING. Huh7 cells were cotransfected with pIFN--Luc, pRL-TK, and the plasmids (300 ng) encoding the indicated proteins. expression of the plasmids pFlag-Pol and pPol-Flag was detected. after 36 h, the cells were extracted and assayed for luciferase activity. the cells were cotransfected with pIFN--Luc, pRL-TK, and flag-tagged Pol. after 36 h, the cells were mock treated or treated with cGAMP. after 36 h, the cells were then harvested for luciferase assay. Huh7 cells were cotransfected with pIFN--Luc, pRL-TK. cells were mock treated or treated with cGAMP (100 nM) for 16 h. they were then harvested for luciferase reporter assay. results are representative of three independent experiments. PH5CH8 cells expressing Pol or not were further transfected with poly(dA dT) to activate the STING signaling. the results showed that less IFN- mRNA was detected in cells expressing Pol than in control cells upon poly(dA dT) stimulation. in addition, the impaired antiviral response mediated by STING was also observed in Huh7 cells expressing Pol. pFlag-Pol-YMHD exhibited a suppression effect on the IFN- promoter activation that was comparable to that of the wild-type Pol in Huh7 cells. a similar observation was made with the mutant pFlag-Pol-YMHD (Fig. 2I, bottom) thus, the results indicate that Pol suppresses STING signaling in a manner that is independent of its catalytic activity. Huh7 cells were cotransfected with Flag-tagged Pol or Core and pSTING. after 36 h, cells were collected for immunofluorescence assay. equal amounts of HA-tagged STING (B) or HA-tagged RIG-I (C) were transfected into the stable cell line 293T-Flag-Pol. 293T cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged Pol or its truncated constructs. after 36 h, the cells were collected for coimmunoprecipitation analysis. asterisks indicate expression of relevant proteins. the greatest inhibition, of more than 80%, was exhibited by the RT/RH region of Pol. results showed that just 100 ng of the Pol RT domain could decrease the IFN- promoter activation by almost 70%. the RT mutant only modestly downregulated the IFN- promoter activation. the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STING is drastically decreased by HBV polymerase. modification of signaling molecules by ubiquitination plays a central role in transmitting signals important for activation of innate antiviral responses (44, 46). ubiquitination events structurally contain several distinct ubiquitin chain linkage types (47) lysines except K63 were mutated to arginines. the cells transfected with pHA-Ub-K48R showed a reduction in the level of ubiquitinated STING in the presence of Pol. pol inhibits IFN- production by specifically targeting the K63- rather than the K48-linked ubiquitination of STING. the cell lysate was prepared for coimmunoprecipitation analysis. the level of HBV DNA replication intermediates was determined by Southern blotting. the positions of relaxed circular (RC) and single-stranded (SS) DNAs are indicated. the ubiquitin ligases tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32) and TRIM56 have been identified to target STING for K63-linked ubiquitination (45, 46) pol disrupts the K63-linked ubiquitination of STING by competitively binding to STING that associates with these two E3 ligases. to further confirm this result, we pulled down the endogenous TRIM32 or TRIM56 with or without pol. 293 cells were cotransfected with pHA-STING and pFlag-TRIM32. after 36 h, the cells were harvested, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. the coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed as described in Materials and Methods. HBV polymerase interacts with STING and inhibits its K63-linked ubiquitination. it is associated with loss of STING function and consequent impairment of IRF3 activation and IFN-induction and the antiviral response. many viruses have been reported to target it for subversion of the host innate immunity. in this study, we demonstrated that HBV Pol markedly impaired K63-linked ubiquitination of STING by physically associating with it through the RT/RH region. however, it had a moderate effect on STING dimerization, which is essential for STING self-activation and subsequent downstream signaling culminating in the induction of type I IFN (21) the recruitment of TBK1 and IRF3 by STING is also required for the activation of STING signaling overexpression of DDX3 could restore the inhibitory effect of HBV polymerase on STING signaling. this result partly excludes the possibility that Pol inhibits STING-mediated type I IFN production mainly by dampening its K63-linked ubiquitination. however, the precise delineation of how Pol affects STING-mediated signaling requires further understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in STING activation. pol was also shown to abrogate IFN- signaling by suppressing the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 in Huh7 cells (79). detailed studies of the TP domain of Pol revealed its association with protein kinase C-delta (PKC-), resulting in inhibition of PKC- phosphorylation. the RH domain was able to interfere with nuclear transportation of STAT1/2 through competitive binding to importin-5 (80)."}
