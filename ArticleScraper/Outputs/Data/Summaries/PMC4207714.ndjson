{"summary": "results Approximately 38.6% of the patients considered hepatitis C to be a traumatic experience. of these, 60.7% had a PTSD diagnosis. hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common throughout the world. the most common route of HCV transmission is intravenous drug use. the disease can manifest in a wide spectrum of effects. medical and psychiatric illnesses can be underestimated in non-clinical populations [15]\u2013[17], [19]. PTSD has already been cited in HCV populations in a small number of studies, most of which were focused on other specific populations. PTSD has already been cited in HCV populations in a small number of studies. patients with a comorbid psychiatric disorder and HCV-infection are well documented to have reduced HRQoL [41], [42]. the impact of depression on HRQoL in these patients is well-investigated [43], [44]. the secondary objective is to investigate the relationship between PTSD diagnosis and HRQoL in HCV-infected patients. thq was a 24-item self-report measurement to assess subjects' history of traumatic life events. subjects who answered \"Yes\" to question 15 were analyzed separately. hepatitis C clinical syndromes were diagnosed using SF-36. all interviews were conducted face-to-face by trained mental health professionals. each patient's disorder was recorded and fulfilled the criteria, according to STATA 9.0 software. all subjects answered an orally-administered questionnaire to gather clinical and socio-demographic data. 127 patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C were enrolled in the study. a total of 127 patients were enrolled in the study. short, structured diagnostic interview compatible with DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. SF-36 has been used for numerous studies in order to assess quality of life. the scale was translated and made suitable for socio-economic and cultural conditions. a multivariate analysis was performed using the significance level of 5% (p0.05) results The HCV-control group was predominantly male (68.7%), ranging in age from 23 to 68 years. most subjects had a stable partner (64.65%); over 69% had a paid occupation; 49% were eligible for a liver transplant. CV-PTSD (99 subjects) p value Gender Male N (%) 68 (68.70) 14 (50.00) Female N (%) 31 (31.31) 14 (50.00) 0.06* Age Mean (SD) 53 (8.80) 52 (9.27) 0.57** Civil state Single N (%) 21 (21.21) 5 (17.86) With stable partner N (%) 64 (64.65) 15 (53.57) Divorced N (%) 12 (12.12) 4 (14.29) 0.03* Widower N ( the perception of hepatitis C as a traumatic experience was not associated with disease severity (needing a transplant), however it showed a significant association with diagnosis of PTSD (p = 0.003) multivariate analysis revealed a negative association in the following domains: role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. the prevalence of PTSD in this sample was 28%, which is extremely high compared to mean prevalence in the general world population. a recent survey carried out in Brazil, in the two largest cities in the country, has estimated the prevalence of PTSD in one year to range between 1.2% and 7.8% [50]. disease severity was not significantly associated with perception of hepatitis C as a traumatic experience or PTSD diagnosis. this unexpected result is possibly related to the small sample size. PTSD was associated with quality of life scores significantly lower in seven of the eight SF-36 domains. a cross-sectional design may cause bias for assessment of other psychiatric correlations with PTSD. the study design also made it impossible to know whether the perception of HCV as a traumatic experience was impacted by pre-existing PTSD."}
