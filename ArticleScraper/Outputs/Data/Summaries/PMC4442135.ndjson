{"summary": "nine out of 11 ring-dried swine blood meal samples from different manufacturing sources. 18 out of 48 fecal samples amplified a 326-bp S1 fragment with orthoreovirus group-specific primers. 11 samples were further sequence verified using MRV3-S1 gene-specific primers amplifying a 424-bp fragment. porcine orthoreovirus induces syncytia in BHK-21 cells and dwarfing in developing chicken embryos. mock-infected cells (E), cells infected with FS03 (F) and cells infected with BM100 (G) are shown. 12 samples of feces and plasma each were obtained from a farm in Iowa. none of these samples was found to be positive for orthoreovirus by RT-PCR. chloroform extracts of feces from a few randomly selected samples were blindly passaged twice on BHK-21 cells. tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin (6.7 to 7.7 log10/ml) increased after treatment with tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin (6.7 to 7.7 log10/ml) this property could be specifically inhibited with MRV3 anti-1 monoclonal antibody. cytoplasm of an FS03-infected Vero cell and a single virus particle in an enlarged view. no other contaminating viral sequences were detected in the deep sequence data. the total length of the porcine orthoreovirus genome is 23,561 nucleotides (nt) RNA-dependent polymerase 32 ACUCAUC L2 3,915 GCUAUU 12 13\u20133882 1,289 2 Guanyltransferase, methyltransferase 33 AUUCAUC L3 3,901 GCUAAU 13 14\u20133841 1,275 1 RNA binding, NTPase, helicase, RNA triphosphatase 60 AUUCAUC M1 2,304 GCUAUU 13 14\u20132224 736 2 Bin the deduced amino acid sequences of FS03 and BM100 are homologous except for 1 protein, with 1 amino acid (aa) change between them. the percentage of homology of each of the different proteins coded by these two viruses is provided in Table S1 in the supplemental material. novel viruses possessed 31 and 11 unique amino acid substitutions in the 1 and 1s proteins. phylogenetic analysis of the FS03 and BM100 isolates revealed a strong evolutionary relationship with MRV3 strains. both isolates were monophyletic with MRV3 of bat origin. Branches of FS03 and BM100 in lineage III are boxed. the metadata layers, including virus strain, isolation year, and place of origin, are color coded. the scale bar shows the evolutionary distance of 0.3 substitution per site. the scale bar shows the evolutionary distance of nucleotide substitutions per position. the branches with less than 75% bootstrap support were collapsed. the final trees were drawn using FigTree v1.4.2. the cumulative macroscopic lesion scores of FS03 and I03 were higher than those of other groups on day 4 dpi. small intestines of the virus-infected pigs showed mild to severe villous blunting and fusion. small intestines of the virus-infected pigs showed mild to severe villous blunting and fusion (crypt/villous ratio of 1:1 to 1:4) lesions from different organs were scored on a scale of 0 to 6. virions disrupt microvilli before release and were still surrounded by the cell membrane of microvilli. virions egress from infected intestinal villous epithelial cells by lysis. multinucleated villous epithelial cell with apoptotic nuclei (arrows) virions egress through microvilli as a string of beads (thick arrow) virions released from villi in the lumen of intestine (arrow) RT-PCR-positive fecal and blood meal samples were filtered through 0.2-m-pore membrane filters. the chloroform extracts of a 20% fecal suspension and 10% ring-dried blood meal samples were inoculated into 9- to 11-day-old, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Embryos and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days. crude virus pelleted from clarified supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 3,700 g for 2 h using an SW-28 rotor. the virus pellet was resuspended in 1 ml TN buffer (20 mM Tris, 400 mM NaCl, 0.01% N-lauryl sarcosine [pH 7.4]) ultrathin sections of virus-infected BHK-21 cells (3 dpi), intestines of experimentally infected pigs, or purified virions were placed on Formvar-carbon-coated electron microscope grids. the specimens were negatively stained with 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate or 1% sodium phosphotungstic acid for 30 s. the virus strains were subjected to five different temperature treatments at 34, 37, 56, 100 ng of viral RNA was fragmented to 250 nucleotides at 94\u00b0C for 10 min. after adapter ligation, 350- to 375-bp libraries (250- to 275-bp insert) were selected using Pippin Prep (Sage Science, United States) the assembly yielded 3,444 contigs that were annotated according to Gene Ontology terms with the Blast2Go program (44) the assembly was executed as a plugin of CLC by mapping against the UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot database with a cutoff E value of 1e05. the reference-based mapping produced identical sequences. five 2-day-old piglets were housed as 7 animals/group in level 2 biosecurity facility. pigs were tested for most common enteric RNA viruses, such as rotavirus, PEDV, swine deltacoronavirus, and TGEV. the animals were anesthetized, and 2 ml of each virus strain was homogenized in 12.5 ml DMEM to get a 20% solution that was extracted with an equal volume of chloroform a board-certified pathologist blind to the experimental groups euthanized animals. the RT-PCR was performed to confirm the production of orthoreovirus in the intestine using the intestinal contents of the experimentally infected piglets. Observed mutations with respect to T3D are boxed. Observed mutations with respect to T3D are indicated by dashes. table S2, DOC file, 0.1 MB (76.5KB, doc) Table S3 GenBank accession numbers of U.S. porcine orthoreovirus isolates and prototype sequences used in this study."}
