{"summary": "animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University. PDCoV titers were determined by tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. study design Birds were floor housed in a temperature-controlled BSL-2 containment room with wood litter shavings. each group was inoculated with 200 L of unfiltered, undiluted small intestine contents (SIC) from a GP-8. we euthanized 2 chicks and 2 poults from each group at 3 and 7 dpi. the remaining 33 birds, including sentinel birds, were euthanized for blood and tissue collection. we read plates at an absorbance of 450 nm by using a SpectraMax F5 plate reader. we used analysis of variance to compare multiple groups and a 1-tailed Student t-test to compare groups of 2. Histopathology and IF Staining. we extracted RNA by using GenCatch Viral RNA Miniprep Kit (Epoch Life Science, https://www.fishersci.com) we further processed samples containing fecal matter by using oneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research Corporation, https://www.zymoresearch.com). we determined viral RNA titers by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR), as reported previously (23). animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University. PDCoV titers from intestinal contents of pigs were determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. the uninfected group was inoculated with 200 L of unfiltered, undiluted small intestine contents (SIC) from an uninfected gnotobiotic pig (GP-8) the infected group was inoculated with SIC from a PDCoV-infected pig (DC175) with 6.87 log10 TCID50/mL. we added 50 L of serum diluted 1:1,000 to the PDCoV antigen-coated and mock antigen-coated wells and incubated for 90 m at 37\u00b0C. then added 100 L of biotin-conjugated antichicken IgY (H+L) biotin pAb. we examined gross tissues from small intestines, duodenum to ileum, and large intestines, cecum and colon. then fixed tissues in 10% neutral formalin for 1\u20132 days at room temperature for histopathology. we embedded, sectioned, and then stained samples with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopy examination. RT-PCR purified the PCR products by using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagen.com), sequenced. the detection limit of the rRT-PCR was 10 genomic equivalents (GEs)/reaction. uninfected birds were inoculated with small intestine contents from uninfected gnotobiotic pig. one chick consistently had a score of 3 for 7 d, another briefly scored a 2 at 7 dpi. cause of diarrhea was unknown. at 14 dpi, all 5 sentinel poults had moderate diarrhea. two infected chicks necropsied at 3 dpi had distended gastrointestinal tracts. similar but less extensive findings were seen in infected chicks at 7 dpi. at 2 dpi, infected poults were gaining weight at a much higher rate than uninfected poults. however, by 4 dpi, poult weight gain was severely curtailed. by 7 dpi, the infected poults recovered and gained weight at a slightly higher, but not statistically significantly different, rate than the uninfected poults. IF tissue staining in infected poults showed PDCoV antigen detectable in epithelial cells lining the villi of the jejunum. we also detected PDCoV antigen in numerous epithelial cells. serum samples collected at 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 dpi. we used indirect ELISA to test samples at 2 and 14 dpi for PDCoV-specific IgY antibodies in all birds from each group, including sentinel birds. rRT-PCR on samples from chicks All experimentally infected chicks rapidly shed detectable viral RNA postinoculation. all 5 sentinel chicks became positive for PDCoV RNA in both tracheal and cloacal swabs. inoculum viral titer represents the genomic equivalent (GE) of inoculum administered at onset, 9.71 log10 GE/mL. boxplots represent distribution of values; tops and bottoms represent 10%\u201390% range of values. dpi, days postinoculation; GE, genomic equivalent. gray dots represent infectivity at 7 and 14 dpi, expressed in log10 TCID50/mL. shapes represent individual birds necropsied at each time point. dpi, days postinoculation; GE, genomic equivalent; LIC, large intestine contents; SIC, small intestine contents; TCID50, 50% tissue culture infectious dose. viral RNA shedding patterns in samples collected from cloaca (A) and trachea (B) of infected and uninfected poults and from cloaca (C) and trachea (D) of sentinel poults. inoculum viral titer represents the genomic equivalent (GE) of inoculum administered at onset, 9.71 log10 GE/mL. uninfected birds were inoculated with small intestine contents from uninfected gnotobiotic pig. one chick consistently had a score of 3 for 7 d, another briefly scored a 2 at 7 dpi. both tested negative for porcine deltacoronavirus, salmonella, and for parasites. the rate of diarrhea increased, and poults did not recover by 14 dpi. at 14 dpi, all 5 sentinel poults had moderate diarrhea. weights were taken at 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 dpi. differences were averaged by the number of days between time points. weights for sentinel birds are excluded after 2 dpi. n = 6 Infected, n = 6 Sentinel, n = 5 Villous height 370 353 547 Crypt depth 64 84 94 Ratio of villous height to crypt depth 6.15 4.26 5.87 *Values are expressed in millimeters and represent the average of 10 measurements/bird at 14 d postinoculation with porcine deltacoronavirus. IF tissue staining in infected poults demonstrated IF-stained jejunum of a poult (no. 42) at 14 dpi with no antigen-positive cells. white arrows indicate several PDCoV antigen-positive cells in the villous epithelial cells. porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)\u2013specific IgY antibody titers in serum collected from chicks and turkey poults. uninfected (n = 6) and infected chicks (n = 6). uninfected (n = 5) and infected poults (n = 6) all 5 sentinel chicks became positive for PDCoV RNA in both tracheal and cloacal swabs within 2 days of comingling with infected birds. inoculum viral titer represents the genomic equivalent (GE) of inoculum administered at onset, 9.71 log10 GE/mL. dpi, days postinoculation; GE, genomic equivalent. inoculum viral titer represents genomic equivalent (GE) of inoculum administered at onset, 9.71 log10 GE/mL. gray dots represent infectivity at 7 and 14 dpi, expressed in log10 TCID50/mL. TCID50 assay tested infectivity of intestinal contents of infected and sentinel poults. we isolated viral RNA from the SIC of 1 infected and 1 sentinel bird at 14 dpi. the samples sequenced had >99% identity with the original inoculum. a protein that exhibits enzymatic activity, peptide processing, cholesterol uptake, and chemotaxis to cell signaling and cell adhesion. aPN is widely distributed and highly conserved in amino acid sequences across species of the animalia kingdom. our data suggest that chicks and poults are susceptible to infection with PDCoV. ELISA results showed both chicks and poults developed PDCoV antibodies by 14 dpi. PDCoV can infect and kill cells of other species through APN receptors. differences in susceptibility to PDCoV infection could be related to differences in APN expression levels between the species. avian species act as potential passthrough or intermediate hosts for PDCoV. in vivo confirmation of avian susceptibility suggests in vitro data implicating human susceptibility should be evaluated further."}
