{"summary": "monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are highly specific, continuously generating antibodies derived from a single B cell clone that target only a single site (epitope) on a single antigen. breakthroughs have highlighted the role that monoclonal antibodies may play in the future development of immune therapies and rational vaccine design for rapidly changing pathogens such as influenza. modern antibody treatments are rooted in classic experiments performed in 1890 by Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburo. the use of antitoxins generated in animals was such a major advance in the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases that it earned a Nobel prize in 1901. monoclonal antibodies are immune cells that circulate in the blood, each producing antibodies with unique amino acid sequences and binding specificities. this gave way to technologies that relied on the cloning of antibody genes and their production in vitro. cell hybridoma technology produces an immortal monoclonal antibody factory. it retains B cell specificity and secretory abilities. recombinant DNA technologies were developed to re-engineer nonhuman antibodies so that they were \u201chumanized\u201d monoclonal antibodies are raised in primates and engineered to express human structural domains. antibodies raised in monkeys will presumably be less cross-reactive to human proteins than antibodies raised in rodents. the use of human antibodies overcomes several complications. a recent breakthrough in human hybridoma technology came when James Crowe and colleagues developed an electroporation technique that increased fusion events significantly compared with traditional methods. the electrical current opens micropores in cell membranes allowing nearby cells to fuse during the resealing process. this protocol, used in combination with viral transformation technologies discussed below, created a much more efficient method to produce libraries of immortalized human B cells. dilution down to one single cell clone from the starting pool of B cells enabled researchers to apply this technology to monoclonal antibody production. this technology allows for the relatively large-scale transformation of human memory B cells into monoclonal antibody-secreting cell lines. this technology allows researchers to quickly identify potential sources of clinically relevant antibodies. phage display allows the production of a large variety of potentially high-affinity monoclonal antibodies that may be rare or nonexistent in the human body. the anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor alpha) inhibitory antibody HUMIRA (Human Monoclonal Antibody in Rheumatoid Arthritis) is the world\u2019s first monoclonal antibody. the ability to iteratively screen for reactive molecules in the lab also allows for the isolation of exceedingly rare antibodies by phage display. in 2009, two papers described the crystal structure of phage-display antibodies that bound to a region of the hemagglutinin protein on the surface of influenza. this region is highly conserved on many divergent influenza strains and is critical for viral function. ing is the production of fully human monoclonal antibodies by isolating single B cells from human blood and expressing their antibody genes in vitro. this method requires only hundreds of B cells and allows for the production of antibodies that are natural (fully human) from highly discrete subsets of B cells that have become specialized within the body. monoclonal antibody technology has propelled monoclonal antibody technology from crude beginnings to the elegant and evolving technology currently available. this technology promises to become higher throughput and more efficient, allowing scientists to screen for exceedingly rare antibody specificities and B cell subsets. monoclonal antibody technology promises to become higher throughput and more efficient, allowing scientists to screen for exceedingly rare antibody specificities. the current state of monoclonal antibody technology is enabling exciting advancements in immunotherapies and understanding of host\u2013pathogen interactions. the current state of monoclonal antibody technology is enabling exciting advancements in immunotherapies and understanding of host\u2013pathogen interactions."}
