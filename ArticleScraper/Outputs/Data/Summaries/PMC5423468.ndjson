{"summary": "stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils and other immune cell types. prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors, including members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family. stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor, preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor. stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor, preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor. the extracellular tumor make-up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms have been reviewed elsewhere. the interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards. a high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops. a high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops. i Forest virus has an outer diameter of about 60 nm. stroma blocks virus spread within tumors. the first option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure is to use matrix-degrading enzymes. these act by digesting collagen-, fibrin- and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits. topic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP9 with oncolytic HSV achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors. similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS26T overexpressing MMP1 or MMP8 were injected with oncolytic HSV. other enzymes and protein effectors, either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously, include hyaluronidase, decorin, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti-tumor efficacy. vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor. this effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor. a promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane-fusogenic genes (MFGs), such as gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) glycoprotein, reptilian reovirus p14 protein (FAST) or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus. the potential limitation of cell-to-cell-dependent spread may be that membrane-free physical barriers, such as the ECM, may still pose a barrier to spread. tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors, including ZO-1, cadherins, claudins and occludin. tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor-promoting signaling. adenovirus type 3 uses PtDds to promote its own infection. JO-1 facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own [47]. JO-1 synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models [48]. a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight-junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the. ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer cell motility. long term relaxin exposure reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness. the authors did not detect treatment-induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness. clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo. 80% reduction in peripheral CD163+ macrophages in animal spleens. CD163+ cells could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo. monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection. depletion of either CD11b+ cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV-1 greatly increased oncolytic efficacy. high CXCR4 expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers. interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards. a high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops. for therapeutic virus, interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle. a representative section of human A2058 melanoma xenografts stained with polyclonal Semliki Forest virus (SFV) antibodies (in brown) shows that even after intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM, which formed a physical barrier for virus infection. the first option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure is to use matrix-degrading enzymes. these act by digesting collagen-, fibrin- and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits, creating more vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 9 resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increased virus penetration into tumor. similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS26T overexpressing MMP1 or MMP8 were injected with oncolytic HSV. other enzymes and protein effectors, either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously, include hyaluronidase, decorin, various other MMPs anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti-tumor efficacy than when given after the virus. vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor. a promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane-fusogenic genes (MFGs), such as gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) glycoprotein, reptilian reovirus p14 protein (FAST) or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus. lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity. adenovirus B2 group (serotypes 3, 7, 11 and 14) entry occurs using desmoglein-2 (DSG-2). complement receptor CD46 was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E-cadherin/catenin network. adenovirus serotype 3 creates dodecahedral particles. adenovirus type 3 uses PtDds to promote its own infection. JO-1 facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue. JO-1 synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models. a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM. loss of E-cadherins via proteases or non-specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM-modulating therapy could trigger pro-tumorigenic Wnt/-catenin signaling, possibly driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. injection of oncolytic HSV-1 directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD68 and CD163 monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus. authors observed a 5-fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an80% reduction in peripheral CD163+ macrophages in animal spleens. macrophage presence indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy, unless depleting preconditioning would be used. depletion of either CD11b+ cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV-1 greatly increased oncolytic efficacy. another key pro-tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up-regulation of CXCR4 receptor for chemokine CXCL12. peter bergen: a delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor-specific oncolytic adenovirus [66] bergen: a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor-specific oncolytic adenovirus. bergen: viruses may be modified for increased receptor binding or uptake. mice knocked out for the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) typically succumb within a day of multi-organ infection. there have been no reported cases of genetic defects in the type I IFN receptor in humans. three unrelated cases of complete signal transducer and activator of T cells (STAT 1) have been recorded to date. tumor responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting. cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma. responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging. a triad of type I IFN-signaling pathway genes formed a pan-tumor-type negative prognostic factor. a broader seven-gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment-resistant breast cancer. resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers 5-AZA-dC, a methyltransferase inhibitor, and LBH589 or MGCD0103, both histone deacetylase inhibitors, was correlated with increased expression tively high levels of unphosphorylated forms of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9 form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF3-like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus. these ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents. stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins. oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines. this variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN-sensitive. however, SFV vector VA7 effectively replicated and destroyed a variety of IFN-responsive cancer cell lines in vitro. sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV. sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV. sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV. a study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN. the non-permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense, associated with PKR, MxA or 2'5'-OAS mRNA up-regulation, in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN adenovirus deleted for VA RNA should be capable of replicating in Ras-overexpressing (tumor) cells expressing Ras may down-regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG-I signaling. PKR activation shuts down E2F-dependent translation, including translation of virus messenger RNAs. some oncolytic viruses, such as members of the poxvirus family, are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro. in most cases, sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro. glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN, which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV. a broad class of tumors may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses; oncovirus-induced cancers. in an intriguing study, oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV-negative head- and neck cancer cells. ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN-dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV. resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR-associated Janus kinase. ruxolitinib successfully abrogated type I IFN-mediated antiviral effects. more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK1/2 signaling in cancer therapy. this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses. however, antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells. neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT1 or STAT2 phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN. authors observed clear induction of ISG15, GBP1 and MX1 in response to type I IFN in glioma cells. other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction. sunitinib and several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK [133], arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers. rapamycin (mTOR) enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activating its effector proteins 4E-BP and S6K. a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus-induced type I IFN, TNF- or TRAIL [138]. Interestingly, since virus infection-triggered cytokines act on nearby non-infected cells, SMAC mimetics may also cause significant bystander tumor-destruction. many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses. the outstanding question for most of them seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses. if one virus fails, could another be used in its stead\" oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT1 and OASL2. in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT1 or OASL2. reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors. in vivo, P-gene encoded proteins control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains. V causes LGP2 protein to bind and inactivate STAT2, IRF7, MDA5 and the Rel homology domain of the NfB subunit p65 but not of p50 [152] gene product V is a stronger inhibitor of MDA5-mediated activation of IRF-3 and IFN-I than V from Edmonston strain [148] measles vaccine strain (Edmonston) N, P, L measles wild type (IC-B) N, P, L compared to the construct above, addition of N and L created a chimera with stronger IFN antagonistic capacity [149] newcastle disease virus F3aa (lentogenic Hitchner B1) F cytomegalovirus TRS1 or IRS1 PKR-antagonists TRS1 and IRS1 conferred increased replication capacity to oncolytic HSV-1, yielding greater therapeutic efficacy in glioma models in mice [158] vesicular stomatitis virus 51 vaccinia virus (Western reserve) B19R Similar to the recombinant but with the enhanced oncolytic capacity of the maraba backbone. vaccinia virus E3L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN. ebola virus VP35 protein partially rescued EMCV but not VSV. heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy, similar to heterologous prime-boost vaccination. the entire oncolytic parvovirus genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus, resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor-specificity. the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied. a triad of type I IFN-signaling pathway genes formed a pan-tumor-type negative prognostic factor, and a broader seven-gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment-resistant breast cancer. resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers 5-AZA-dC, a methyltransferase inhibitor, and LBH589 or MGCD0103, both histone deacetylase inhibitors, was correlated with increased expression in many cancers, STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form (U-STAT) it is known that U-STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts. in many tumors, constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT1 and STAT2. oncolytic virus infection of tumors may be exploited to increase therapeutic efficacy. expression of beta 2 defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti-tumor immune responses mediated by TLR4-dependent activation of dendritic cells. oncolytic SFV vector VA7 effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN-responsive cancer cell lines in vitro. however, only tumors generated from IFN-unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA7 so far. however, only tumors generated from the same cell types have seemed infectable in vivo by VA7 so far. sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV, an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling [100,101] in eight sarcoma cell lines, basal up-regulation of RIG-I and IFIT1 and rapid induction of STAT1 phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus. antiviral defense associated with PKR, MxA or 2'5'-OAS mRNA up-regulation, in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN. adenoviruses are often deleted for E1A, which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E2F. however, such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses. similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus, against which Ras-independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo. this implies that human tumors treated with MEK-inhibitors, such as Trametinib, may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses. oma-interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus. oma-interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus. as attenuated SFV or M-mutated VSV, may function well against oncovirus-induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defenses. a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade. a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade. clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib-treated normal animals. this makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of interference with JAK1/2 signaling in cancer therapy. more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK1/2 signaling. a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting antiviral signaling mediated by p65 using NfB inhibitors BMS-345541 or TPCA-1. the authors observed clear induction of ISG15, GBP1 and MX1 in response to type I IFN in glioma cells, with the latter two dependent on NfB signaling. sunitinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF-R and PDGF-R signaling. antiviral defenses, specifically RNAseL and PKR, resulted in cancer cells being exposed to sunitinib. kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) enhances antiviral effects of type I IFN. rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti-tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN-mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR. a novel virus sensitizer, Vse1, was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types. ase IRE1, which was identified in a genome-wide siRNA screen, greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase-2-induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice [139]. this effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN. however, such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses. many oncolytic viruses used today have stronger capacity to induce or weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains [78,144,145]. an open question is whether strain-specific or virus-specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti-tumor efficacy. chimeric and recombinant IFN-I-antagonistic viruses have proven safe in animals. chimeric and recombinant IFN-I-antagonistic viruses have proven safe in animals. not all constructs have been tested as oncolytics. not all constructs have been tested as oncolytics. vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger is ambiguous in the literature. herpes simplex type 1 34.5/ human cytomegalovirus TRS1 or IRS1 PKR-antagonists TRS1 and IRS1 conferred increased replication capacity to oncolytic HSV-1. a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS1 from influenza strain H1N1/09 did show increased pathogenicity in chickens. vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B19R has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses. oncolytic 34.5 gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR-antagonists from human cytomegalovirus, TRS1 and IRS1, generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. colytic VSV and SFV yielded tumor-model-dependent increases in therapy efficacy. such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy. anti-tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses. colytic virus advances than previously thought, with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non-permissive antiviral state. some tumor cells harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells, which may promote and propagate virus resistance."}
