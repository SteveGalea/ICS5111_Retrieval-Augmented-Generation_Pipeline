{"summary": "450 million pneumonia cases occur per year and have %7 mortality incidence increasing by age. bacterial pneumonia accounts for 13\u201350% of single pathogen diagnosed CAP cases and 8\u201327% of mixed bacterial-viral pneumonia. atypical radiological involvement are common clues. ten days ago he admitted to his family physician with non-productive cough and fever. at the third day of this treatment complaints of abdominal pain, anorexia and headache were also added. both patients were not using any regular medication for any of chronic disease. patients\u2019 sputum culture, microscopy and blood culture were unremarkable. sputum was negative for Acid resistant bacillus (ARB) and mycobacterium tuberculosis complex wasn\u2019t detected in culture. in case 1 chest radiograph revealed bilateral heterogeneous infiltration from top to lower zone of lung. ten days ago a 42-year-old man admitted to his family physician with fatigue, myalgia, and headache. at the third day of this treatment complaints of abdominal pain, anorexia and headache were also added. both patients were not using any regular medication for any of chronic disease. patients\u2019 sputum culture, microscopy and blood culture were unremarkable. sputum was negative for Acid resistant bacillus (ARB) and mycobacterium tuberculosis complex wasn\u2019t detected in culture. multiple patchy consolidations accompanied by ground glass areas without pleural effusion on computed thorax tomography (Case 1). RESULT In accordance with these data both patients had severe pneumonia. influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus constitute %13\u201350 of CAP. supplementary therapies like oxygen, intravenous hydration or bronchodilators must be added to antibiotics in viral pneumonias. bronchiolitis, inflammatory cell infiltration in alveoli and diffuse alveolar damage in severe cases. bilateral ground glass opacities and patchy infiltrates are common radiological findings. if patient is highly suspected clinically and radiologically oseltamivir should be initiated in 48 hours to prevent viral replication. 75 mg twice a day for five days is standard therapy."}
