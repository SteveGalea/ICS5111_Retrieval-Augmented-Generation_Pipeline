{"summary": "pBRT7Q was used as a template for introducing UAG codons by site-directed mutagenesis. full-length PCR amplicons were obtained from 500 pg of template. pBRT7Q was originally provided by Ren\u00e9 C. Olsthoorn (Leiden University) cultures were thoroughly mixed, split into 24 aliquots of 0.5 ml containing on average N i = 33 pfu each, and incubated for 2 hr in a Thermomix shaker at 37\u00b0 at 650 rpm. to check N i, the inoculum was diluted 1/10 and plated on 225 cells. the fraction of cultures containing no mutants was determined for each test. the reversion rate was calculated as m = ln ( P 0 ) / ( N f N i ), where N f is the average of the six N f values. z\u2032 is a correction factor for incomplete plating in the N f determination. we numerically solved m given P 0, N f, N i, z, and z\u2032. after implementing this correction m-values increased only very slightly. even assuming a plating fraction as low as z = 0.05, estimates changed less than twofold. correction for selection bias in fluctuation tests. 225 cells were inoculated with 104 pfu of each virus. after 2 hr 45 min of incubation, cells were removed. supernatants were plated on 225 and IJ1862 cells. fitness was calculated as the growth rate difference. mutation frequencies f can be transformed into mutation rates (s/n/c) we modeled mutational fitness effects using an exponential distribution truncated at s = 1 plus a class of lethal mutations occurring with probability pL. mutational fitness effects in bacteriophage Q were measured as growth rate ratios. mutations were assumed to have independent fitness effects (no epistasis) and back mutations were ignored. the rate of appearance of mutants escaping an artificial microRNA was 5.55 105 s/r. pBRT7Q was used as a template for introducing UAG codons by site-directed mutagenesis. full-length PCR amplicons were obtained from 500 pg of template. 225 cells expressing an amber suppressor Gln tRNA were electro-transfected, plated on top agar. only plaques showing a titer ratio 1/1000 in nonsuppressor/suppressor cells were used for fluctuation tests. titer of each amber mutant phage was adjusted to 105 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml and 15 ml of 225 cells was inoculated with 103 pfu. the number of mutational events per culture was assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, such that the probability of observing no mutants is P 0 = P ( 0 | m ( N f N i ) = e m ( N f N i ) where P denotes the Poisson distribution and m is the reversion rate. the replication of Q conforms to a stamping-machine model (Garca-Villada and Drake 2012) such that there is essentially only one replication cycle per cell. therefore, the number of mutants should be approximately equal to the number of mutation events. we thus assumed Q k = P ( k | m ( N f / z \u2032 N i ) because this titration was affected by centrifugation only. revertants were found to be fitter than the amber mutant, the growth rate difference being w = (0.34 0.18) hr\u20131. if progeny sizes are assumed to be Poisson distributed then the revertant has an excess progeny R (assumed integer) over the amber mutant. RT was carried out with MMLV reverse transcriptase directly from 2 l of plaque suspension. 2.5 l of cDNA was then used for PCR amplification with Phusion DNA polymerase. observed mutation frequencies f can be transformed into mutation rates. selection was applied by picking individuals for the next cell infection cycle with weighted probability 1 \u2013 s\u2032. mutations assumed to have independent fitness effects (no epistasis) and back mutations ignored. the rate of appearance of mutants escaping an artificial microRNA was 5.55 105 s/r (de La Iglesia et al. 2012) the rate of appearance of mutants escaping an artificial microRNA was 5.55 105 s/r (de La Iglesia et al. 2012) reversion estimated by the null-class (P0) method were m = (8.1 2.9) 105, m = (9.3 1.5) 105, and m = (9.4 2.6) 105 for sites 432, 696, and 1067, respectively. the per-nucleotide mutation rate expressed as s/n/r can be obtained as = 3 m / T s. initial number of revertants in 24 cultures determined from three independent titrations of the inoculum. each test consisted of 24 parallel cultures. d Arithmetic mean of N f obtained from 6/24 random cultures. e Harmonic mean of N f obtained from the same random cultures. cultures showing no revertants, excluding cultures with >100 revertants from total. 3 0 0 UAG UCG (Ser) 0 9 0 UAG UUG (Leu) 0 0 UAG UAC (Tyr) 1 0 0 UAG UAU (Tyr) 0 2 0 Observed Ts 5 3 1 To ascertain the reliability, we considered several sources of error and bias. first, differences in titer among cultures introduce variance in N f. if some substitutions were selectively neutral but occurred at very low rates, they may not be observed in plaque sequences but should be included in T s anyway. this is an unlikely scenario, because most single-point mutations are deleterious or lethal in bacteriophage Q. plated each of the 48 cultures in 225 amber suppressor cells. none of the 48 plaques showed any mutation in the UAG codon. mutation frequency does not seem to depend on whether amber mutants or revertants were scored. the mutated genome positions (432, 696, and 1067) mapped to the A2 maturation protein. for each mutant, we performed three independent tests to determine the rate at which the UAG codon reverted to other, viable codons. six of the eight possible nucleotide substitutions transforming UAG into a sense codon were observed. the number of different substitutions observed at sites 432, 696, and 1067 were 5, 3, and 1. the number of different substitutions observed at sites 432, 696, and 1067 were 5, 3, and 1. 0 0 3 0 0 P0f 9/23 21/24 12/24 9/24 6/24 18/24 13/21 20/24 11/24 Reversion rateg m 104 1.1 0.24 1.1 0.69 1.2 0.90 0.42 1.1 1.3 Reversion rateh m 104 4.4 0.60 1.6 2.0 2.3 1.1 1.0 1.6 1.9 Reversion ratei m(z) 104 1.4 0.29 1.3 0.86 1.5 1.1 0. k Q k ( 1 z ) k, where Q k = l = 1 k P ( l | m ( N f / z \u2032 N i ) / N f ( j ) because N f N i. recalculated the average reversion rate as m = ln. incomplete plating of total and/or revertant viruses should reduce the probability of detecting revertants. inefficient suppression of amber mutants could confer a fitness advantage to revertants in 225 cells and therefore lead us to overestimate the mutation rate. we infected 48 E. coli 225 cultures with the am1067 mutant. we set N i = 30 and N f = 3.1 104 pfu; plated each culture in nonsuppressor cells; picked one plaque per culture; and sequenced genome positions 890\u20131489. it has been suggested mutations in RNA viruses tend to be clustered in hypermutated genomes. previously characterized the distribution of mutational fitness effects in this same phage. 29% were lethal, viable mutations reduced fitness by 10.3% on average. estimated mutation rate after correcting for selection is f /0.4, or = 1.3 104 s/n/c. a mutant carrying a nonfunctional read-through gene produced 2.9 times fewer progeny per infection cycle than the wild-type phage in RTH cells. the authors obtained = 1.8 105 s/n/c, a value nearly 10 times higher than the one obtained by scoring stop codons in RTH cells. a read-through nonsense mutant was grown in trans-complementing (RTH) cells. this gave a reversion rate of m = 2.5 105 but, since the mutational target size Ts was not determined, the corresponding per-nucleotide mutation rate is uncertain. the most likely mutation rate for bacteriophage Q should be on the order of 104 s/n/c. correlation is strongly determined by the bacteriophage Q single data point. it is also supported by the presence of 3\u2032-exonuclease activity in coronaviruses. the correlation is noisier for riboviruses, in addition to the estimate for bacteriophage Q. the lowest rate among riboviruses corresponds to the dsRNA bacteriophage 6. the lowest rate among riboviruses corresponds to the dsRNA bacteriophage 6, despite its genome size being less than half of those of coronaviruses. infinite asexual populations should maximize their adaptability for a genomic mutation rate U* = sH, where s H is the harmonic mean of selection coefficients against deleterious mutations. if beneficial mutations are sufficiently strong to offset the effect of deleterious mutations, then U* = sb. riboviruses replicate close to the optimal mutation rate defined by the balance between deleterious and beneficial mutational fitness effects (U*) the rate of molecular evolution in nature increases less than linearly with the mutation rate and appears to stagnate in ssRNA viruses and reverse-transcribing viruses, suggesting that their mutation rates are close to maximizing evolvability. Drake\u2019s rule may be a result of the interplay between mutational loads, the costs of fidelity, and the drift barrier. mutation rate per cell infection cycle (s/n/c) should be similar because replication mode of this phage is essentially stamping machine-like. a mutant carrying a nonfunctional read-through gene produced 2.9 times fewer progeny per infection cycle than the wild-type phage in RTH cells. this was inflated by transitory bouts of hypermutation. the authors found no genetic changes in the polymerase of the phage that may explain hypermutation. the most likely mutation rate for bacteriophage Q should be on the order of 104 s/n/c. the geometric mean is 1.4 104. a negative correlation between genome size and mutation rate is statistically significant in log-scale. the correlation with genome size is again negative, but not significant. however, the statistical power is lower due to the smaller size of the data set. measles virus shows an estimated mutation rate higher than expected from its genome size. after removal of this single data point the correlation becomes significant again. the lowest rate among riboviruses corresponds to the dsRNA bacteriophage 6. the lowest rate among riboviruses corresponds to the dsRNA bacteriophage 6. in riboviruses, the log-log slope is more negative. genetic drift sets a limit on the ability of natural selection to minimize mutation rates. genetic drift sets a limit on the ability of natural selection to minimize mutation rates. if beneficial mutations are sufficiently strong to offset the effect of deleterious mutations, then U* = sb. riboviruses replicate close to the optimal mutation rate defined by the balance between deleterious and beneficial mutational fitness effects (U*) the rate of molecular evolution in nature increases less than linearly with the mutation rate and appears to stagnate in ssRNA viruses and reverse-transcribing viruses, suggesting that their mutation rates are close to maximizing evolvability. DNA viruses show lower per-nucleotide and per-genome mutation rates (Sanju\u00e1n et al. 2010), slower adaptation and molecular evolution (Duffy et al. 2008), and better tolerance to chemical mutagenesis."}
