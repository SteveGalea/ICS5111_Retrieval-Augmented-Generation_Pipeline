{"summary": "BMDC BMderived DC cKO conditional KO IFNAR1 IFN receptor 1 IRF4 IFN regulatory factor 4 VertX IL10eGFP reporter mouse (Vert, fr. green; X, roman numeral 10) Supporting information This journal provides supporting information supplied by the authors. such materials are peer reviewed and may be reorganized for online delivery, but are not copyedited. direct type I IFN signaling is modestly required for IL10 production by CD4+ T cells during influenza infection. WT and Ifnar1/ mixed bone marrow chimera mice were infected with influenza. IL10EGFP MFI in IL10eGFP+ of lung CD4+ T cells from WT VertX or Ifnar1/ VertX mice was measured through flow cytometry at day 7 post infection. data are representative of at least two separate experiments."}
