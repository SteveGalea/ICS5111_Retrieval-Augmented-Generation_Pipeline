{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) are highly pathogenic viruses that infect humans. they undergo a distinct replication cycle, involving virion entry, RNA genome replication and transcription of viral mRNAs, protein translation, virion assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate complex, and egress by exocytosis of assembled virions. the virus is a previous study of FDA-approved drugs identified imatinib as a potent inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (13). abl kinases are reversible non-receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate several cellular pathways, including cell migration, adhesion, and actin reorganization. in mammals, there are two Abl kinases, Abl1 (Abl in mice) and Abl2 ( HEK293T cells and Huh-7 cells were grown in high-glucose dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1% l-glutamine (Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gemini Bio-Products) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pseudotyping plasmids 8.2 and pMM310 (vpr-BlaM) were provided by C. Broder (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences) a codon-optimized sequence for MERS S (EMC strain) was synthesized by Genescript. phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Quality Biological Inc.), imatinib (Cell Signaling), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control (Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and the cells were cultured for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were then washed once in PBS, and normal growth medium was added. RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Ambion) and phenol-chloroform extraction. levels of MERS-CoV UpE, M mRNA, and a transferrin receptor (TRFC) endogenous control were assessed as previously described. one milliliter of transfection buffer-DNA mixture was added dropwise. cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. supernatants were cleared twice by centrifugation. cells were spinoculated at 250 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. PTB containing virions was replaced with fresh PTB. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min. ions using the \u201cAnalyze Particles\u201d tool were compared to nonlocalized virions. percent virion/endosome colocalization using the Image J Colocalization Finder was graphed. in both cases, transfected cells were left for 48 h and then infected with 85 TCID50 of either SARS-CoV (MA15) or MERS-CoV (Jordan) supernatants and TRIzol extracts were collected at 18 h postinfection for SARS-CoV or at 18 h and 48 h postinfection for MERS-CoV. levels of abl1 and abl2 were assessed by Western blotting using anti-cAb cells (human lung fibroblast cell line, ATCC CCL-171) and BSC1 cells (monkey kidney epithelial cells, ATCC CCL-26) were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% l-glutamine (Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gemini Bio-Products) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% a codon-optimized sequence for MERS S (EMC strain) was synthesized by Genescript. the coding sequence was then subcloned into the pCAGGS expression vector. cells were prechilled at 4\u00b0C for 30 min, infected with 850 50% tissue culture infective doses. 850 TCID50 of either SARS-CoV (MA15) or MERS-CoV (Jordan) for 5 h. supernatants collected to assess infectious virus titers. effects of imatinib on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RNA production. HEK293T cells were seeded into 10-cm plates and cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the next day, 9 ml of fresh medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% supplemented calf serum (SCS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 0.01% active G418) was added. mM NaCl, 20% sucrose, pH 7.4), centrifuged 2 h at 112,398 g at 4\u00b0C, resuspended in 250 l of sucrose buffer, and stored overnight on ice at 4\u00b0C then 80\u00b0C for long-term storage. eighteen to 24 hours later, cells were pretreated for 1 h with pretreatment buffer (PTB), which consisted of 10 M imatinib (Cell Signaling) diluted secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse\u2013fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and anti-rabbit\u2013FITC (Sigma, F0257) and anti-mouse\u2013Alexa 633 (Invitrogen, A21052) and anti-rabbit\u2013Alexa 633 (Invitrogen, A21071) all antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution. cells were washed with loading buffer (LB) and incubated for 1 h in the dark in CCF2 solution. percent CCF2 cleavage was assessed by flow cytometry on an LSRII instrument. RESULTS Imatinib inhibits production of infectious SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. imatinib significantly inhibits replication by treating cells with imatinib for the first 4 h of infection. imatinib inhibits SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication. cells were treated with imatinib for the first 4 h (squares) or at 5 h postinfection (triangles) in all cases. Imatinib significantly inhibits SARS-CoV in Vero E6 (A) and Calu-3 (B) cells. RNA was harvested at 12 h postinfection and assessed for genomic RNA and mRNA expression. imatinib significantly inhibited the production of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomic RNA (pp1a) and mRNA (upE) when added at the time of virion entry. imatinib does not inhibit RNA production when added at 4 h postinfection. if imatinib is given after coronavirus genomic RNA entry into the cytoplasm, there is no significant inhibition of RNA replication or mRNA production. BSC and Huh-7 cells were pretreated for 1 h with imatinib. at 2 h postinfection for PS/SARS-S and 1 h postinfection for PS/MERS-S, cells were fixed. we quantified PS/SARS-S colocalization with Lamp-1, a late endosome/lysosome marker. results with PS/SARS-S and the late endosomal marker Lamp-1 showed 55% colocalization in the absence and 65% colocalization in the presence of imatinib at 2 h postinfection. this suggests that imatinib does not significantly affect localization of the SARS-S pseudovirions to the late endosomes. 70% of MERS-CoV localized with EEA1 at 1.0 h postinfection. imatinib does not interfere with trafficking of live MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV to early or late endosomes. a chimeric protein (BlaM-vpr) incorporated into the virion were used to investigate the effect of imatinib on fusion of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. a -lactamase\u2013Vpr chimeric protein (BlaM-vpr) incorporated into the virion were used to investigate the effect of imatinib on fusion of the virus and endosomal membrane. imatinib inhibits fusion of PS/SARS-S and PS/MERS-S with endosomal membranes. this suggests that imatinib blocks SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication. cells were infected with or without a 1-h 10 M imatinib pretreatment. we observed no inhibition of SARS-CoV replication (Fig. 6C) or MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 6D) when Abl2 mRNA was knocked down, we observed a significant inhibition of SARS-CoV replication (Fig. 6C) and MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 6D) these data suggest that Abl2, but not Abl1, expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication. imatinib was added for the first 4 h of infection in vero E6 cells. virus production, as quantified by TCID50, was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. when imatinib was added at 5 h postinfection, levels of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1A, squares) and MERS-CoV (Fig. 1B, squares) were significantly higher than when the drug was added before infection. imatinib inhibits a step in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication cycles. RNA was harvested at 12 h postinfection and assessed for genomic RNA and mRNA expression. we found that imatinib significantly inhibited the production of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genomic RNA. imatinib does not significantly inhibit RNA production when added at 4 h postinfection. if imatinib is given after coronavirus genomic RNA entry, there is no significant inhibition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RNA. imatinib does not affect intracellular trafficking of pseudotyped viruses, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV. in order to achieve productive infection, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV must be internalized by the host cell and traffic to the appropriate endosomal compartments for fusion and entry. cal microscopy showed 37% colocalization of PS/MERS-S virions with early endosomal marker, EEA-1, in the absence of imatinib and 47% in the presence of imatinib at 1 h postinfection. these data suggest that imatinib does not significantly affect localization of the PS/MERS-S pseudovirions to early endosomes. cells were fixed at 1 h postinfection for imaging colocalization of PS/SARS-S with LAMP1. Graphs represent percent colocalization of virions to endosomes for 100 cells. ns, not significant, was performed using live virus in vero E6 cells. Graphs represent percent colocalization of virions to endosomes for 100 cells. ns, not statistically significant, suggest imatinib inhibits replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. imatinib inhibits fusion of PS/SARS-S and PS/MERS-S with endosomal membranes. uninfected cells incubated with CCF2 show no cleavage in absence of BlaM. in mock-treated cells, PS/SARS-S released BlaM into cytoplasm. Flow cytometry of pseudovirus entry from one representative experiment. Error bars represent mean standard deviation. Imatinib was designed as an Abl1 and Abl2 inhibitor. ed down protein relative to scrambled siRNA inhibits production of infectious SARS-CoV (C) and MERS-CoV (D) from transfected cells. previous work identified abl kinase inhibitors as potent antagonists of coronavirus replication in vitro (13) but did not identify a mechanism of action. other groups have reported roles for Abl kinases in replication of Ebola virus (14, 15), coxsackievirus (16), and vaccinia virus (17). other groups have reported roles for Abl kinases in replication of Ebola virus (14, 15), coxsackievirus (16), and vaccinia virus (17). the abl2 SH2 and SH3 domains fold back onto the kinase domain. the conformation can switch from inactive to active upon substrate binding to either the SH2 or the SH3 domain itself (24). the open, active conformation allows for ATP binding at the active site and subsequent kinase activity. coronaviruses rely on an Abl2-specific signaling event. this may play a role in trafficking or activation of specific cytoskeletal or endosomal proteins. this leads to cleavage of coronavirus S proteins in the lumen of endosomes. other studies have shown cleavage of coronavirus S by TTSP TMPRSS2. the concentration of imatinib needed to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in this current study is within the range previously reported for Ebola virus, CVB, and vaccinia virus (14\u201317). the need for this high concentration of drug could be due to experimental factors of cell line resistance or the amount of virus used in these experiments."}
