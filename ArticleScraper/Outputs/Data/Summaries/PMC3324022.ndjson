{"summary": "protein arrays have been used to detect seroreactive peptides in several infectious agents (4\u20137). this approach has been shown to be a fast, efficient, and accurate alternative to detect antigens compared with traditional methods such as mass spectrometry and Western blots (8). it has the advantage of enabling the screening of a large number of potential antigens and detecting them independently of their natural abundance during infection. at least three of the four strains of mice commonly used in salmonella research. a number of antigens were shown to be recognized during salmonella infection and have the potential to be further studied. a number of antigens were shown to be recognized during salmonella infection. this study provides an approach that could be used to identify antigens for the improvement of current typhoid vaccines. the proteomic array developed should be used to test a larger number of typhoid sera and unveil new targets for the improvement of the efficacy of current vaccines."}
