{"summary": "antiviral cytokines act in a paracrine or autocrine fashion to induce the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) these antiviral cytokines activate intracellular signaling pathways that culminate in production of interferons (IFNs) ligase activity and ability to recognize E2-conjugating enzyme. coiled-coil domains facilitate self-association, turning oligomerized TRIM proteins into scaffold for assembling multiprotein complexes. TRIMs can be classified into up to 11 subfamilies (C-I to C-XI), with nine TRIMs that lack a known C-terminal domain setting up subfamily C-V (8, 9) TRIM56 possesses antiviral activity against yellow fever virus (YFV) and dengue virus (DENV), two classical flaviviruses that are threatening the well-being of approximately half of the world's population. TRIM56 does not impact propagation of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a picornavirus. pcDNA5/FRT/TO-HA-TRIM56 tagged with two copies of hemagglutinin. pcDNA6-YFVpro contained full-length NS2B-NS3 coding sequence of YFV-17D in the pcDNA6/V5-HisB backbone (15). pcDNA6-YFVpro contained the full-length NS2B-NS3 coding sequence of YFV-17D in HEK293 cells constitutively expressing wild-type (WT) or E3 Ub ligase-deficient CC21/24AA mutant (Cys21 and Cys24 in the RING domain substituted with alanines) TRIM56 (designated 293-T56 and 293-T56-CC21/24AA, respectively, were generated by transducing HEK293 cells with replication-incompetent retroviruses carrying C-termin FIT-T56 and 293-FIT-T56-Mut were used to induce HA-TRIM56 expression in 293-FIT- and HeLa-FitA2-derived cells. yFV-17D (NR-115; BEI Resources) and DENV2 (Thailand 16681 strain) were propagated in vero-E6 and C6/36 cells. a viral stock of HCoV-OC43 (ATCC VR-1558) was prepared replicons were synthesized from ClaI-linearized plasmid templates. 293-FIT-T56 cells cultured in the absence or presence of Tet were transfected with 1 g of the WT or the NS4B mutant replicon RNA. we custom-synthesized a small interfering RNA (siRNA) from Fisher Scientific that specifically targets the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of human TRIM56 transcript. this siRNA had a target sequence of 5\u2032-GCCGCTGCTATATAGTTTA-3\u2032 and was transfected into cells at a final concentration of 100 nM by Lipofectamine 2000. yFV and HCoV-OC43 RNAs were calculated using serially diluted pcDNA6-YFVpro and pEF6-OC43-N-V5His DNA. the relative abundance of each target was normalized to that of 28S rRNA. the following monoclonal (MAb) and polyclonal (pAb) antibodies were used. anti-EMCV 3D polymerase (Pol) MAb (a gift from Ann Palmenberg); rabbit anti-TRIM56 pAb (12); mouse anti-HA tag MAb (12); mouse antiactin MAb (12); and goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse pAbs (Southern Biotech) densitometry quantification of protein bands of interest was performed using ImageJ software (NIH) pEF6-OC43-N-V5His construct was amplified from the cDNA of virally infected BSC-1 cells. heLa, mosquito C6/36, vero-E6, and BSC-1 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. HEK293 cells constitutively expressing wild-type (WT) or E3 Ub ligase-deficient CC21/24AA mutant TRIM56 HEK293 cells were conditionally expressing WT or various mutant versions of TRIM56 using the Flp-In T-REx expression system (Invitrogen) the resultant cells were named 293-FIT-T56 or 293-FIT-T56-Mut, respectively. yFV-17D (NR-115; BEI Resources) and DENV2 (Thailand 16681 strain) were propagated in Vero cells. titration of virus yield was performed on vero-E6 cells at 7 days postinfection (dpi) for YFV-17D and HCoV-OC43. titration of virus yield was performed on vero cells at 3 dpi. the target sequence is 5\u2032-GCAGCAGAATAGTGTGGTAAT-3\u2032. the shRNAs were packaged into replication-incompetent lentiviral particles in 293FT cells. surviving cell colonies were pooled for further analysis. TRIzol, cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were implemented as described elsewhere (12, 22) the following primers were used: ISG56 and 28S (14); IFN- (22); interleukin 29 (IL-29); 5\u2032-GAAGAGTCACTCAAGCTGAAAAACTG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GAGAAGCCCAATT-3\u2032 (reverse); TRIM56 3\u2032 UTR, 5\u2032-CCGA ly diluted pcDNA6-YFVpro and pEF6-OC43-N-V5His DNA were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as previously described (20). the following monoclonal (MAb) and polyclonal (pAb) antibodies were used: rabbit anti-YFV NS3 pAb. TRIM56 has no demonstrable effect on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus (12). to understand the specificity and spectrum of the antiviral activity of TRIM56 against positive-strand RNA viruses, we determined the impact of human TRIM56 overexpression on multiplication of four RNA viruses of three distinct viral families. 93-FIT-T56 cells cultured in the presence of Tet compared with those in the absence of Tet. similar results were obtained for HeLa cells with Tet-inducible expression of HA-TRIM56, i.e., HeLa-FitA2-T56 (Fig. 1B), confirming that the finding is not a cell-type-specific phenomenon. progeny virus production determined by TCID50 assay in culture supernatants of 293-FIT-T56 cells with or without Tet treatment. asterisk indicates statistical differences exist between Tet and +Tet cells with a P value of 0.05. a 4-fold decrease in N protein abundance in HA-TRIM56-expressing cells (lane 4) compared to nonexpressing cells (lane 3). TRIM56 overexpression inhibited prM protein expression at 36 h after infection with DENV2 (MOI = 0.1) ectopic expression of TRIM56 impedes multiplication of flaviviruses (YFV and DENV2) and HCoV-OC43. TRIM56 expressed at physiological levels restricts infections by YFV, DENV2 and HCoV-OC43. ectopic expression of TRIM56 impedes multiplication of flaviviruses. TRIM56 expressed at physiological levels poses a barrier to infection with the three RNA viruses identified above. compared with that in HeLa cells bearing a nontargeting, scrambled control (Ctrl) shRNA, TRIM56 protein abundance in pools of HeLa cells stably transduced with a TRIM56 shRNA (HeLa-shT56-094 cells) was reduced by 80%. TRIM56 knockdown experiments corroborate the physiological relevance of the finding that TRIM56 is an intrinsic host restriction factor of YFV, DENV2 and HCoV-OC43. the endogenous TRIM56 protein restricts propagation of YFV, DENV2 and HCoV-OC43. immunoblot analysis of TRIM56 and N protein (N) expression in HeLa-Ctrl and HeLa-shT56-094 cells at 60 h after infection with DENV2-16681 (MOI = 0.5) the mean percentage of cells with discernible prM expression was quantified from three independent images. there was no significant upregulation of transcripts for ISG56, IFN-, or IL-29 in 293-FIT-T56 cells with (+Tet) or without (Tet) HA-TRIM56 induction when infected with YFV, DENV2 or HCoV-OC43. the antiviral effects of TRIM56 do not result from upregulation of IFN response or from modulation of cell growth. seV-infected cells served as a positive control of ISG expression. the asterisk indicates a nonspecific band detected by the anti-ISG56 antibody. growth curves of 293-FIT-T56 cells cultured in the absence or presence of Tet were assessed by cell number counts over a 7-day observation period. 293-FIT-T56 cells cultured in the absence (Tet) or presence (+Tet) of Tet were transfected with a negative-control siRNA. TRIM56 positively regulates TLR3 signaling by interacting with TRIF. this is consistent with our previous report that TRIM56 has no appreciable role in RIG-I signaling. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were mock treated, infected with YFV-17D or HCoV-OC43 for 24 h (MOI = 0.1), or treated with extracellular poly(IC) (pIC; 20 g/ml) or Sendai virus (SeV; 100 HAU/ml) for 10 h (as a positive control for activating TLR3 or RIG-I pathway, respectively) HEK293 cells that conditionally express individual TRIM56 mutants were localized to the cytoplasm similar to WT TRIM56. TRIM56 mutants were localized to the cytoplasm similar to WT TRIM56. HEK293 cells that conditionally express TRIM56 mutants in a Tet-inducible. HA-TRIM56 and actin expression in 293-FIT-T56 and the indicated 293-FIT-T56 Mut cells with or without Tet treatment for 48 h. the RING domain and the integrity of the C-terminal portion of TRIM56 are critical for the antiviral activity against YFV and DENV2. the CC21/24AA mutant inducible cells were subjected to YFV-17D infection. Tet induction of CC21/24AA mutant had no effect on YFV NS3 expression. this notion was supported by data obtained from YFV-17D-infected 293-T56 and 293-T56-CC21/24AA cells. the decline in progeny viral yield upon Tet induction was not seen in 293-FIT-T56-CC21/24AA, -RING, -355\u2013433, -621\u2013695, or -693\u2013750 mutant cells. this mutant retained the ability to inhibit YFV-17D, but was less effective than WT TRIM56 or the B-box mutant. the suppression of DENV2 multiplication by TRIM56 requires its E3 ligase activity and the integrity of the C-terminal portions. the functional TRIM56 mutants exert their antiviral effects independently of the endogenous, WT TRIM56 protein. qRT-PCR was performed to measure the abundance of endogenous TRIM56 transcript including the endogenous and exogenously overexpressed TRIM56 mRNAs (panel A, using primers amplifying the coding region of TRIM56 mRNA), and intracellular YFV RNA (panel C, using primers amplifying the NS2B region of YFV RNA) il, 293-FIT-T56-B-box cells cultured with or without Tet and transfected with a negative-control siRNA (Ctrl) or siRNA targeting the 3\u2032 UTR of TRIM56 (siT56) cell were either mock infected or infected with YFV-17D for 24 h. progeny virus production in culture supernatants of 293-FIT-T56 WT or Mut cells in the absence or presence of Tet at 24 after infection with HCoV-OC43. the suppression of HCoV-OC43 multiplication by TRIM56 depends on its E3 ligase activity but not the integrity of the C-terminal parts. analysis of progeny virus production confirmed that all TRIM56 mutants but CC21/24AA and RING retained the ability to curtail HCoV-OC43 propagation. TRIM56 inhibits YFV/DENV2 propagation by impairing intracellular viral RNA replication, while it curbs HCoV-OC43 spread. at 1 hpi, intracellular viral RNA levels for YFV-17D or HCoV-OC43 were indistinguishable. at 1 hpi, intracellular viral RNA levels for YFV-17D or HCoV-OC43 were indistinguishable between cells cultured without and with Tet. qRT-PCR analysis of intracellular YFV RNA abundance in 293-FIT-T56 (WT), -CC21 293-FIT-T56 cells induced (+Tet) or repressed (Tet) for HA-TRIM56 expression were transfected with the replication-defective NS4B mutant DENV2-TSV01 replicon RNA (designated DEN-Rep-WT or -Mut) at the indicated time points posttransfection, cells were lysed and assayed for Renilla luciferase activity as a readout 293-FIT-T56-WT and -621\u2013695 cells were infected with HCoV-OC43. there was no difference in luciferase activity in cells transfected with either a WT or mutant replicon regardless of HA-TRIM56 expression status. in cells with induced HA-TRIM56 (+Tet), the WT replicon did not replicate in the first 48 h. the replication-deficient NS4B mutant replicon failed to synthesize viral RNAs. TRIM56 acts on the viral RNA replication step of DENV2 infection. the resultant cell line, designated 293-FIT-T56, exhibited no detectable HA-TRIM56 protein when cultured in the absence of Tet (Tet) but showed robust HA-TRIM56 expression upon tet addition to culture medium (+Tet) cells without HA-TRIM56 expression (Tet) harbored high levels of viral NS3 antigen at 24 h postinfection (lane 3) ectopic expression of TRIM56 inhibits multiplication of YFV, DENV2 and HCoV-OC43 but not that of EMCV. immunoblot analysis of expression of N-terminally HA-tagged TRIM56 (using anti-HA antibody) and YFV NS3 (using anti-YFV NS3 antibody) in 293-Flp-In T-REx-TRIM56 cells (293-FIT-T56) in immunoblot analysis of HA-TRIM56 and viral protein expression in mock-infected (lanes 1 and 2) or virus-infected (lanes 3 and 4) 293-FIT-T56 cells with (lanes 2 and 4) or without (lanes 1 and 3) Tet treatment. progeny viral titers in cell-free supernatants of infected cells in the absence or presence of Tet treatment. antiviral effect of TRIM56 observed in 293-FIT-T56 cells infected with HCoV-OC43. cells with or without HA-TRIM56 induction supported comparable production of 3D polymerase protein, the replicase core of. ectopic expression of TRIM56 impedes multiplication of flaviviruses (YFV and DENV2) and HCoV-OC43. TRIM56 expressed at physiological levels restricts infections by YFV, DENV2 and HCoV-OC43. compared with that in HeLa cells bearing a nontargeting control (Ctrl) shRNA, TRIM56 protein abundance in pools of HeLa cells stably transduced with the effects of TRIM56 depletion on DENV mirrored with those seen in YFV-17D-infected cells. TRIM56 knockdown experiments corroborate the physiological relevance of the finding that TRIM56 is an intrinsic host restriction factor of YFV, DENV2 and HCoV-OC43. Actin served as a loading control to demonstrate equal sample loading. culture supernatants of virus-infected cells were harvested at 36 hpi. TCID50 assay for determination of progeny virus production. s indicate that statistical differences exist between Ctrl and shT56 cells with P values of 0.05 and 0.01 respectively. TRIM56 possesses the ability to promote the type I IFN response induced via the TLR3 signaling pathway (14) in light of this, we examined whether heightened induction of the IFN antiviral response is responsible for the retarded viral propagation in TRIM56-expressing cells. we conclude that general augmentation of the IFN antiviral response is not responsible for the antiviral effects of TRIM56 against flaviviruses and HCoV-OC43. the antiviral effects of TRIM56 do not result from upregulation of IFN response or from modulation of cell growth. the antiviral actions of TRIM56 do not depend on TLR3/TRIF, RIG-I, or STING. TRIM56 has been reported to form a complex with TRIF and STING. TRIM56 has been reported to form a complex with TRIF and STING. this thereby potentiating TLR3 and STING-dependent antiviral signaling pathways. HA-TRIM56's antiviral activities against YFV and HCoV-OC43 remained unchanged. TRIM56 does not rely on TLR3/TRIF, RIG-I, or STING to restrict YFV and HCoV-OC43. progeny virus production was determined in cell-free supernatants following silencing of TRIF or RIG-I and infection of YFV-17D (middle) or HCoV-OC43. single and double asterisks indicate statistical differences exist between Tet and +Tet cells (C and D) or between control and knockdown cells (A and B) with P values of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. HEK293 cells conditionally express individual TRIM56 mutants in a Tet-inducible manner. HA-TRIM56 and its mutants were localized to the cytoplasm similar to WT TRIM56. the integrity of the C-terminal portion of TRIM56 is critical for the antiviral activity against YFV and DENV2. Tet induction of the B-box mutant blunted YFV NS3 protein abundance (compare lanes 12 and 11) in infected cells. this inhibitory effect was found to be absent when comparing cells expressing RING, 355\u2013433, 621\u2013695, and 693\u2013750 mutants with cells in which expression was not induced. the RING domain and the integrity of the C-terminal parts are critical for the antiviral function of TRIM56 against mutant version of TRIM56 was expressed in constitutive fashion. HA-tagged wild-type and mutant TRIM56 and YFV NS3 protein expression in 293-FIT-T56 WT or Mut cells in the absence or presence of Tet. there were eight lines of 293-FIT-T56 WT or Mut cells examined in total, data from which are shown in eight blocks of immunoblot collections. the coiled-coil domain is involved in the restriction of YFV by TRIM56. the part this domain plays is not as crucial as those played by the E3 ligase activity and the C-terminal portions of the protein. the coiled-coil domain involvement profile uncovered was almost identical to that required for anti-YFV action. the functional TRIM56 mutants exert their antiviral effects independently of the endogenous, WT TRIM56 protein. one caveat is that some mutants functioned by pairing with the endogenous, WT TRIM56 protein. this scenario is unlikely. qRT-PCR was performed to measure the abundance of endogenous TRIM56 transcript including the endogenous and exogenously overexpressed TRIM56 mRNAs. TRIM56-3\u2032 UTR siRNA only knocked down endogenous TRIM56 transcript and not the exogenously introduced (Tet-inducible) WT or mutant TRIM56. the TRIM56-3\u2032 UTR siRNA had no demonstrable effects on the antiviral activity of any exogenously expressed TRIM56 forms. single and double asterisks indicate statistical differences exist between Tet and +Tet cells (C) or between control and knockdown cells (A) with P values of 0.05 to 0.06 respectively. inhibition of HCoV-OC43 propagation by TRIM56 is dependent on its E3 ligase activity but not upon the integrity of we compared the HEK293 Tet-inducible cell lines expressing WT or various TRIM56 mutants for the ability to support HCoV-OC43 infection. TRIM56 inhibits YFV/DENV2 propagation by impairing intracellular viral RNA replication, while it curbs HCoV-OC43 spread. three cell lines were included in the analysis: 293-FIT-T56-WT, 293-FIT-T56-CC21/24AA, and 293-FIT-T56-621\u2013695. cells were cultured in the absence or presence of Tet to repress or induce TRIM56 (or mutant TRIM56) expression, followed by infection with YFV-17D (Fig. 10A) or HCoV-OC43. TRIM56 blunts YFV and DENV2 infection by targeting intracellular viral RNA replication. inhibits HCoV-OC43 propagation by acting on a later step in the viral life cycle. qRT-PCR analysis of intracellular YFV RNA abundance in 293-FIT-T56 (WT), -CC21/24AA, and -621\u2013695 cells cultured in the absence or presence of Tet. in the case of YFV-17D, intracellular viral RNA abundance peaked at 24 hpi. there was no significant further increase at 36 hpi. however, the peak level of viral RNA in 293-FIT-T56 cells was 1 log lower than in uninduced cells. this implies that TRIM56 blunts YFV infection by targeting intracellular viral RNA replication. TRIM56 curbs flaviviral RNA replication, we performed transient viral RNA replication assay in 293-FIT-T56 cells using WT or a replication-defective mutant (NS4B P104R) DENV2 replicon encoding Renilla luciferase. at 4 h posttransfection, there was no difference in luciferase activity. SSION In this study, we have examined the role of human TRIM56 in acting as an antiviral host factor against diverse positive-strand RNA viruses. our data show that TRIM56 bears antiviral activities against two medically important flaviviruses (YFV and DENV2) and extend the antiviral spectrum of this TRIM. TRIM56's antiviral activity against a human coronavirus substantially broadens our understanding of the antiviral spectrum of this TRIM. he says the discovery of TRIM56's antiviral activity against a human coronavirus substantially broadens our understanding of the antiviral spectrum of the virus. TRIM56 is among a few TRIMs that were recently shown to positively regulate innate antiviral pathways leading to IFN production. TRIM56 promotes the TLR3-dependent signaling pathway that recognizes viral double-stranded RNAs by forming a complex with TRIF. TRIM56 also interacts with and activates STING, enhancing the cytosolic dsDNA-sensing pathway. TRIM56 is also involved in cellular processes that fend off these classes of parasites. the RING domain executes E3 ligase activity that promotes ubiquitination of viral proteins or host factors critical for viral replication. the RING domain executes E3 ligase activity that promotes ubiquitination of viral proteins. suppression of MLV requires its B box domain alone, independent of the E3 ligase activity or the C-terminal SPRY domain (32). TRIM56-mediated antiviral activities against YFV, DENV2 and HCoV-OC43 share the requirement for the RING domain-based E3 ligase activity. however, they differ in the requirement of other molecular determinants. complex domain requirements for TRIM56-mediated inhibition of distinct RNA viruses illustrate a remarkable example of host restriction factor evolution. TRIM56 promotes ubiquitination (12), the best-known enzymatic activity for most TRIMs (7, 9, 35) but the results of this modification to the target proteins responsible for the antiviral effects are unknown. protein-protein interactions via the C-terminal portion may participate in TRIM56's antiviral actions against YFV and DENV2. we favor the notion that host factors are likely targeted by TRIM56, given that we did not find any BVDV replicase proteins to interact with TRIM56 in a previous study. a transient replicon assay using a DENV2 replicon confirmed that TRIM56 curbs flavivirus RNA replication but not translation. the effect on YFV and DENV2 thus mirrored those observed with TRIM56 on BVDV RNA replicons. TRIM56 targets viruses in the family Flaviviridae at the intracellular RNA replication step. TRIM for development of broad antivirals."}
