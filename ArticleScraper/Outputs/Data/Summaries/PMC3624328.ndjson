{"summary": "HCoV-EMC is phylogenetically related to the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS-CoV (3, 6). the alarming parallels in terms of taxonomy and of pathogenesis sparked the fear that HCoV-EMC could cause an epidemic similar to SARS-CoV, which in 2003 had infected more than 8,000 people. the mucins that accumulated over time on the apical side of the cultures were removed by washing the cultures 10 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the cultures were inoculated with either SARS-CoV or HCoV-EMC at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 to enable multistep growth. be cultures grown on transwell permeable membrane supports were apically inoculated with HCoV-EMC isolate (3) at an MOI of 0.1. virulence is the extent to which viruses are able to cope with the antiviral type I interferon (alpha/beta interferon [IFN-/] system, a major part of the innate immune response (15) HCoV-EMC was unable to grow in the nondifferentiated primary HTBE cells. the addition of IFN- clearly had an antiviral effect. HCoV-EMC showed a much more pronounced IFN sensitivity. HCoV-EMC is much more sensitive to the antiviral action of type I IFNs than SARS-CoV is. multiplication and type I IFN sensitivity of HCoV-EMC in comparison to SARS-CoV were studied by applying high or low doses of IFN. analysis for two sensitive markers of the IFN response, IFN- and ISG56 (interferon-stimulated gene 56) (26), and IP-10 (IFN-induced protein 10) was included as a marker of antiviral chemokines. HCoV-EMC showed a similar phenotype, as neither innate immune marker was induced above 10-fold. infection experiments with nondifferentiated HTBE cells and with the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 confirmed the absence of IFN induction by replicating HCoV-EMC. the human bronchial epithelium cell line Calu-3 was infected with SARS-CoV, HCoV-EMC, or the recombinant RVFV mutant RVFVNS::Ren (control [CTRL]) at an MOI of 1. IRF-3 (24), viral dsRNA (29) and RVFV N protein (38) were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 1, fixed, and stained for endogenous IRF-3 (24), viral dsRNA (29), and RVFV N protein. the contrast was enhanced using the autocontrast feature of Adobe Photoshop. HCoV-EMC is similar to SARS-CoV in the ability to inhibit IRF-3 and prevent an antiviral IFN response. this apparent difference from SARS-CoV raises hopes that current isolate of HCoV-EMC will not spread at the same speed and scale as SARS-CoV did."}
