{"summary": "the use of standard case definitions can improve the usefulness of data generated by a surveillance system. the usefulness of a case definition depends on the characteristics of the condition of interest, the characteristics of other conditions with which the condition of interest may be confused. case definitions for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were revised multiple times between 1982 and 2014. in other instances, the language used in a case definition has been simplified and/or an attempt has been made to reduce multiple definitions for the same condition to a single global one. the lack of standardization in case definitions and lack of a systematic approach to the surveillance of mild and severe influenza greatly hampered efforts to monitor and understand the burden and severity of the 2009\u20132010 pandemic. a global standardized case definition for influenza is essential if we are to make valid comparisons of surveillance data collected in different areas of the world. clinical influenza was defined as a sudden onset of fever, a temperature >38\u00b0C and cough or sore throat in the absence of another diagnosis. clinical influenza was defined as a sudden onset of fever, a temperature >38\u00b0C and cough or sore throat in the absence of another diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of the definition was generally only about 60% and its specificity ranged from 0%. the proposed clinical case definition of ILI became an acute respiratory illness with a measured temperature of 38 \u00b0C and cough, with onset within the past 10 days. the proposed changes to the case definition of ILI should result in enhanced specificity without greatly compromising the definition\u2019s sensitivity. three WHO Regions had independently developed their own definitions before the 2009\u20132010 influenza pandemic. these definitions were based on the case definition published by the pan American Health Organization in 2005. they were based on criteria set as part of the integrated management of childhood illness strategy. pneumonia in this age group, i.e. cough or difficulty breathing, requiring hospitalization and showing at least one of five danger signs. the five danger signs were: unable to drink or breastfeed; vomiting everything ingested; having convulsions; being lethargic or unconscious; and showing chest indrawing or stridor while calm. concerns raised about use of pneumonia symptoms \u201cshortness of breath\u201d and \u201cdifficulty breathing\u201d. SARI cases that present between seven and 10 days after symptom onset appear no less likely to be laboratory-test-positive for influenza. increase the time frame to 10 days should therefore allow more cases to be captured, without markedly increasing the use of resources. clinical influenza was defined as a sudden onset of fever, a temperature >38\u00b0C and cough or sore throat in the absence of another diagnosis. clinical influenza was defined as a sudden onset of fever, a temperature >38\u00b0C and cough or sore throat in the absence of another diagnosis. the sensitivity of the definition was generally only about 60%. the proposed clinical case definition of ILI became an acute respiratory illness with a measured temperature of 38 \u00b0C and cough, with onset within the past 10 days. the proposed changes to the case definition of ILI should result in enhanced specificity without greatly compromising the definition\u2019s sensitivity. studies have shown a lack of association between a sore throat and influenza in individuals with respiratory disease. sore throat is also difficult to assess in infants. change prevents exclusion of cases with underlying chronic conditions. severe influenza without pneumonia represents a substantial proportion of the burden posed by hospitalized influenza patients. criteria used were those for pneumonia in this age group, i.e. cough or difficulty breathing and a breathing rate above 60, 50 and 40 breaths per minute for those younger than two months. concerns raised about use of pneumonia symptoms \"shortness of breath\" and \"difficulty breathing\" both of these symptoms are difficult to quantify and are often misinterpreted to include conditions such as nasal obstruction. substantial shortness of breath only occurs as a late sign in the course of respiratory infections. \"onset within the past 10 days\" was added to the most recent version of the SARI definition. a period of seven days was originally considered. a review of available data indicated that patients with SARI that presented between seven and 10 days after symptom onset were no less likely to be laboratory-test-positive for influenza. SARI cases that present between seven and 10 days after symptom onset appear no less likely to be laboratory-test-positive for influenza. increasing the time frame to 10 days should therefore allow more cases to be captured, without markedly increasing the use of resources. the accuracy of influenza identification was investigated among hospitalized patients in Kenya using case definitions of both SARI and pneumonia. compared with the pneumonia definition, the SARI case definition gave higher sensitivity and lower specificity when applied to patients younger than five years. this was suggested that hospital-based influenza surveillance could be integrated within the existing platforms for pneumonia surveillance. infections with respiratory syncytial virus have been shown to decrease the performance of a WHO clinical case definition when that definition was used for influenza surveillance. primary goal of influenza surveillance is not to capture every influenza case, but to follow patterns in transmission and disease burden and changes in the influenza viruses circulating."}
