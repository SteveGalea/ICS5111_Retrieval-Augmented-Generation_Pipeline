{"summary": "pomegranates have a long history of antibacterial use dating back to biblical times. it was used as a traditional remedy for thousands of years under the Ayurvedic system of medicine. extracts from the rind of the fruit and bark of the tree were effective against diarrhea and dysentery. Bacteria Pomegranate extract Growth inhibition () or promotion (+) Citation Enteric Escherichia coli O157:H7 Peel, bark [2, 12] Salmonella Typhi Peel [14, 15] Salmonella Typhimurium Peel [21] Salmonella enterica serovars Peel [19] Vibrio cholerae Peel [16, 17] Yersinia enterocolitica Peel [7] Shigella spp. Peel [16, 18] Shig pomegranate has positive effects on both probiotic and pathogenic bacteria. it also shows promise in food preservation by protecting against pathogenic bacteria that can cause food poisoning. an ethanolic extract of pomegranate had MICs of 0.49 to 1.95 mg/mL and MBCs of 1.95 to 3.91 mg/mL against E. coli O157:H7. pomegranate has exhibited bactericidal activity against other food and waterborne pathogenic bacteria. pomegranate peel extract at 250 g/mL was most effective at inhibiting antibiotic resistant strains of salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. pomegranate juice powder was heated to 100 degrees C for 0, 30, 60, or 120 minutes and added at 2% (wt/wt/wt) to ground top round beef. samples of meat stored at 5\u00b0C were taken at days 1, 8, 14 and 21 and plated on media for evaluation of bacterial one study examined the effectiveness of pomegranate peel to inhibit growth of L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and Salmonella enterica in cheese at room temperature (23\u00b0C) pomegranate treatment increased the stability of cheese against lipid oxidation, improving shelf life. pomegranate peel (5% methanolic extract) prepared as an ointment was applied to guinea pig wounds daily for 12 days. the treatment significantly enhanced wound healing by increasing collagen, DNA and protein synthesis as well as contraction rate. the extract-treated diabetic rats showed significant reduction in the wound area when compared with the control group. another study in which flower extracts of pomegranate were applied to wounds resulted in decreased wound size compared to the control group. the MICs of adherence of pomegranate gel against the bacteria were 1 : 16 for S. mutans and S. sanguis. the results suggest that pomegranate gel might be useful in the control of adherence of different bacteria in the oral cavity. the pomegranate extract rinse was effective against dental plaque microorganisms, decreasing the CFU/mL by 84%, similar to chlorhexidine (79% inhibition), and significantly different from the control rinse (11% inhibition). authors speculate that the ellagitannin and punicalagin may be responsible for the antibacterial activity of the pomegranate extract rinse. the pomegranate chips or placebo chips were implanted in 20 patients with gum pocket depths of 5\u20138 mm. levels of bacterial attachment, bleeding, gingival and plaque indexes were initially measured and again at 3 and 6 months. a marker of inflammation (IL-1beta) was also lower at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline. pomegranate extract caused alterations in the bacterial cell walls after 2 hours of treatment. multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is considered to be one of the most difficult bacterial infections to treat. ciprofloxacin was enhanced by a methanolic pomegranate peel extract against resistant strains of beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa. synergy with ciprofloxacin was observed in 19 of 49 strains. pomegranate inhibited quorum-sensing signals in two bacterial strains. they interfer with purple pigment production and bacterial swarming motility. inhibition may be due to direct or indirect interference on quorum-sensing by pomegranate polyphenols. pomegranate extract had MICs of 0.49 to 1.95 mg/mL and MBCs of 1.95 to 3.91 mg/mL against E. coli O157:H7. pomegranate has exhibited bactericidal activity against other food and waterborne pathogenic bacteria. ethanolic pomegranate extracts showed greater antibacterial activity than the antibiotic chloramphenicol, but lower activity than trimethoprim. pomegranate peel extract at 250 g/mL was most effective at inhibiting antibiotic resistant strains of Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. one study examined the effectiveness of pomegranate peel to inhibit growth of L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and Salmonella enterica in cheese at room temperature (23\u00b0C) pomegranate treatment increased the stability of cheese against lipid oxidation, improving shelf life. pomegranate sour sauce had an antimicrobial effect when mixed with lettuce, spring onion, and parsley. enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 can lead to hemorrhagic diarrhea. these infections can be life-threatening to young children and the elderly. there is incentive to find alternative control measures, such as plant and herbal extracts. extracts of pomegranate fruit pericarp were tested by agar well diffusion. strong antibacterial activity was exhibited by the methanol extracts of pomegranate. pomegranate peel extracts showed greater antibacterial activity than the antibiotic chloramphenicol. pomegranate juice powder was heated to 100 degrees C for 0, 30, 60, or 120 minutes. the meat was then cooked and inoculated with individual L. monocytogenes strains. heat-treated pomegranate juice powder treatments significantly inhibited growth of all five strains in refrigerated beef. faecal bacteria resulted in formation of the dibenzopyranone-type urolithins. pomegranate ellagitannins had a beneficial effect on rumen bacterial populations in lactating cows. the peel extract was fed at levels of 1, 2, or 4% on voluntary intake. methanolic extract of pomegranate peels formulated into a 10% (wt/wt) water-soluble gel showed similar enhancements in wound healing in a Wistar rat model compared to a commercial topical antibacterial product. participants' wounds were completely healed after 10 days, compared to 16\u201318 days for the group receiving a blank control gel. extract concentrations of 8 mg/mL and 12 mg/mL were effective against Actinomyces viscosus. the extract did not inhibit Actinomyces viscosus. pomegranate extract also inhibited strains of periodontal bacteria. pomegranate extract rinse prevented plaque buildup (P 0.05) at day 5, volunteers used either pomegranate extract, chlorhexidine, or a placebo rinse twice daily. pomegranate extract rinse was effective against dental plaque microorganisms, decreasing the CFU/mL by 84%. placebo-controlled human clinical trial of 32 young adults examined salivary measures relevant to oral health and gingivitis. participants using pomegranate extract mouth rinse three times per day for 4 weeks or a placebo rinse. pomegranate extracts were implanted in 20 patients with gum pocket depths of 5\u20138 mm. extract concentrations of 8 mg/mL and 12 mg/mL were effective against Actinomyces viscosus. extract did not inhibit Actinomyces viscosus. pomegranate extract also inhibited strains of periodontal bacteria. was measured at days 0 and 5 in thirty periodontally healthy volunteers who refrained from all mechanical oral hygiene measures for 4 days. the pomegranate extract prevented as much plaque as the chlorhexidine rinse. pomegranate extract rinse was effective against dental plaque microorganisms, decreasing the CFU/mL by 84%. placebo-controlled human clinical trial of 32 young adults examined salivary measures relevant to oral health and gingivitis after using a pomegranate extract mouth rinse three times per day for 4 weeks or a placebo rinse. pomegranate peel extract impregnated into biodegradable chips for use subgingivally as an adjunct to scaling and root planning for maintenance of periodontal disease. MRSA can cause life-threatening infections in people with weakened immune systems, especially in lesser-developed countries where antibiotics are not readily available. pomegranate extracts moderately inhibited cultured MRSA strains at MICs of 0.2\u20130.4 mg/mL. pomegranate extract showed strong activity against H. pylori with a mean inhibition zone diameter of 39 mm at 100 g disc1. pomegranate extracts from nine Iranian cultivars showed significant in vitro anti-H. pylori activity. ethanolic pomegranate peel extract against resistant strains of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa. synergistic activity between a methanolic pomegranate extract and the antibiotics chloramphenicol, gentamicin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and oxacillin pomegranate inhibited quorum-sensing signals in two bacterial strains. pomegranate inhibited quorum-sensing signals in two strains. antiviral effects have been reported against influenza virus, herpes virus, poxviruses, and human immunodeficiency virus. natural antimicrobials from plant extracts have become increasingly popular for use as alternative antivirals. these include the absence of reported/observed toxic effects at recommended doses along with additional benefits such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. studies indicated that HNoVs are solely responsible for up to 2.3 million infections, 50,000 hospitalizations, and 300 deaths per year in the us alone. cultivable surrogates such as feline calicivirus (FCV-F9) [70], bacteriophage MS2 [71], and murine norovirus (MNV-1) [72] are used in infectivity assays to study antiviral or inactivation effects. the most potent effect was on FCV-F9 after treatment with 8, 16, or 32 mg/mL of pomegranate polyphenol. low initial titers of FCV-F9 were reduced by 1.30, 2.11, and 3.61 log10 PFU/mL and high initial titers by 1.56, 1.48, and 1.54 log10 PFU/mL. pomegranate juice exhibited consistently greater antiviral effects against all viruses at both high and low titers. this difference may be due to variability in composition and bioavailability of polyphenols in juice versus those extracted in pure form. pomegranate juice is quite resistant to most treatment conditions, including pH and heat. 1% of 3 log PFU poliovirus/0.05 mL survived after storage at 4\u00b0C for 24 hours in pomegranate juice. pomegranate juice and polyphenols may play a role in preventing virus binding to the host cell receptors by blocking the cell surface receptors or the virus surface ligands. HBGAs are complex carbohydrates present on red blood cell surfaces, the mucosal epithelium of respiratory, genitourinary, and digestive tracts. cranberry juice at concentrations of 10 and 100% and cranberry-pomegranate at concentrations of 1% to 100% were found to reduce the binding of human noV strains specifically to certain types of human HBGAs. punicalagin was found to be the most effective anti-influenza component. the acidity of pomegranate juice and concentrated liquid pomegranate extract contributed to rapid anti-influenza activity. a 5-minute treatment at room temperature with 800 g/mL PP was shown to result in at least a 3 log titer reduction of influenza viruses PR8 (H1N1), X31 (H3N2), and a reassortant H in 2003, the AIDS pandemic claimed 30 million lives that resulted in 14,000 new HIV-1 global infections daily. antiretroviral chemotherapeutics have been used to decrease HIV-1 symptoms mainly in developed countries. human noroviruses are the main cause of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. human noroviruses (HNoVs) belong to the family of Caliciviridae. they are nonenveloped and round with a diameter of 27 to 40 nm. pomegranate juice and polyphenols have significant antiviral effects against foodborne viral surrogates, FCV-F9, MNV-1, and bacteriophage MS2. the juice could decrease low titers (5 log10 PFU/mL) of FCV-F9, MNV-1, and MS2 by 2.56, 1.32, and 0.32 log10 PFU/mL. pomegranate was reduced by 0.41, 0.45, and 0.93 log10 PFU/mL. pomegranate juice contains total phenolics of 3.6 mg/mL. this difference may be due to variability in composition and bioavailability of polyphenols in juice versus those extracted in pure form. titer reduction for FCV-F9, MNV-1, and MS2 followed the order of cranberry juice > grape juice > orange juice in general. grape juice had a greater effect on high-titer FCV-F9 than cranberry juice. for all three viruses, 50% of total reduction was achieved within 20 minutes. pomegranate juice and polyphenols may play a role in preventing virus binding to the host cell receptors by blocking the cell surface receptors or the virus surface ligands. a cranberry-pomegranate juice blend was shown to reduce the specific binding ability of human noV P particles to salivary human histoblood group antigens (HBGAs) pomegranate polyphenols were virucidal against influenza virus, suppressed the replication of the virus in host cells, and inhibited agglutination of chicken red blood cells caused by the virus. pomegranate juice and concentrated liquid pomegranate extract (POMxl) solutions contributed to rapid anti-influenza activity, whereas PP powder (POMxp) did not. influenza viruses PR8 (H1N1), X31 (H3N2), and a reassortant H5N1 virus derived from a human isolate were inactivated when treated for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C with pomegranate juice. the antiviral activity was less against avian isolates of one coronavirus and reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses. nonpomegranate polyphenols exert a direct action on the viral particles, inhibiting the adsorption of the virus to the host cell receptors. one study found that proanthocyanidin A-1 inhibited viral attachment and penetration. a method for determining ellagitannin levels using a novel pomegranate standard has been published. current studies do support potential benefit of pomegranate extracts in food preservation and decontamination."}
