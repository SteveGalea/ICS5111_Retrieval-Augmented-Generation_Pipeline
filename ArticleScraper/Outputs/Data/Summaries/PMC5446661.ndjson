{"summary": "RVA is a member of the genus Rotavirus within the family Reoviridae. 11 segments of double-stranded RNA are encapsulated, with most of them encoding single polypeptides except for segment 11. reassortment is prone to occur when a cell is infected with more than one strain (2). RVA strains from several other animal species show more or less conserved genotype constellations, such as I2-R2-C2-M2-A3/A13-N2-T6-E2-H3 for cattle (10), I1/I5-R1-M1-A1/A8-N1-T1/T7-E1-H1 for pigs (12), and I3-R3-C2-M3-A3/A9-N2-T3-E3-H3/H6 for the first RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-wt/KEN/KE4852/2007/G25P[6], was detected in fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in Kenya. the first strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/CHN/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3] and RVA/Bat-tc/CHN/MYAS33/2013/G3P[10] and had the more than 10% of bats were RVA seropositive, indicating a widely distributed exposure to RVAs. 4 RVA strains from 3 insectivorous bats and 1 frugivorous bat were identified. four samples were positive for RVA. us leschenaultii 2012 F ND 30/142 (21.1) Guangxi Beihai Scotophilus kuhlii 2015 I 1/74 (1.4) 13/50 (26.0) Xing'an Hipposideros larvatus 2015 I 0/8 (0.0) 0/9 (0.0) Long'an H. larvatus 2015 I 0/8 (0.0) 0/15 (0.0) Lingshan S. kuhlii 2015 I 0/15 the complete genotype constellations of the 4 strains are shown in Fig. 1. 10 gene segments of RVA strain LZHP2 (except for VP6), 10 segments of BSTM70 (except for VP1), and 8 segments of YSSK5 (except for VP3) were shared. fruit bat-originated strain GLRL1, identified in Guangdong Province, did not share a single genotype with any other known RVA strain. none of the strains in this study shared any genotypes with bat RVA strains detected from Cameroon and Kenya. phylogenetic analysis of VP7 (A) and VP4 (B) of RVAs identified in this study (circles), previously reported bat RVAs (triangles), and representatives of each genotype. all strains were classified into two major phylogenetic clades representing mammalian and avian RVAs. the genotype of each sequence is indicated at the last part of the strain name. phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 (A), VP2 (B), VP3 (C) and VP6 (D) genes of RVAs identified in this study (circles), previously reported bat RVAs (triangles), and representatives of each genotype. all strains were classified into two major phylogenetic clades representing mammalian and avian RVA strains. the genotype of each sequence is indicated at the last part of the strain name VP7, VP4, VP6, and NSP5 genes shared nucleotide identities as high as 95% to 98% to these genes of M2-102. VP1 gene shared the highest identity (96%) to that of strain 11D034-1. strain LZHP2 shares same genotype constellation as argentean horse strain E3198. these prevalences were shown to be overall significantly different by 2 test (2 = 30.3303; P 0.0001) seroprevalence levels between bats in the western provinces Yunnan and Guangxi were not different. the rates in Yunnan and Guangxi were much higher than in the eastern provinces Fujian and Zhejiang (P 0.00883) a serum sample from Beihai, Guangxi (sample code YSA2) was applied in five different dilutions. Western blotting analyses of cross-reactivity of mouse hyperimmune sera against recombinant GLRL1 VP6. these lanes were taken from different gels. four samples were positive for RVA (Table 1). These strains were detected from swabs of Scotophilus kuhlii in Beihai. strain YSSK5, Hipposideros pomona in Luzhai, and Taphozous melanopogon in Baise, Guangxi.

RNA detection significantly underestimates the true prevalence of RVA in the bat population. all RNA-tested samples were from apparently health adult bats. infections appear to be more prevalent in Guangxi and Yunnan than in more eastern provinces. SLH14-like RVAs are true bat viruses widely distributed in insectivorous bat populations in this region. red circles indicate that the bats were positive by serological investigation, while yellow ones indicate positivity for RVA RNA. strain M2-102 was previously identified as the pathogen causing diarrhea in a 3-year-old boy in 2014. the unusual equine RVA strain E3198 may also be the result of a cross-species transmission of an MSLH14-like bat RVA strain to a horse. this would suggest that MSLH14-like bat RVA strains should also be present in south american bat populations. YSSK5 was identified from a palm-roosted bat in Beihai coast. it also contained 8 gene segments belonging to the MSLH14-like genotype constellations. the VP1 gene was shown to contain yet another novel genotype: R20. this finding adds further evidence for the role bats might play as a reservoir for pathogenic human RVA strains. VP7, VP1, VP3, and NSP5 genes were located at the root of the mammalian RVA cluster. this feature was also observed for the VP7, VP1, VP3, and NSP4 gene segments of the cameroonian bat RVA strains. this suggests that some of the bat RVA strains might have diverged from other mammalian RVA strains a very long time ago. animals such as pigs, rabbits, and rodents (38\u201341) and animal-associated RVAs in humans (32, 42) evidence for interspecies transmission and for genetic reassortment between human and animal rotaviruses was illustrated in recent years. some animal species (cows, pigs, cats, and dogs) appear to contribute frequently to the antigenic/genetic diversity found in human RVAs. vancomycin, 160 U/liter of nystatin, was stored in liquid nitrogen prior to transport to the laboratory. all captured bats were released after sample collection, with the exception of 38 bats from Guangdong in 2005. anal specimens as well as gut contents of bats from each location were pooled and subjected to viral metagenomic analysis as per our published method (22) PCR amplicons were ligated into pMD18T vectors (TaKaRa) and transfect competent Escherichia coli DH5 cells (Tiangen) five clones of each amplicon were randomly picked for sequencing by the Sanger method on an ABI 3730 sequencer (ComateBio) phylogenetic reconstructions were performed using MEGA v.6 and the maximum likelihood method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA) was performed according to a previous protocol. a total of 10 g of protein was boiled in 2 loading buffer (Tiangen) for 10 min, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) the blocked membrane was then incubated with mouse antibodies against MLSH14 and His. all captured bats were released after sample collection, with the exception of 38 bats from Guangdong in 2005, which were euthanized humanely. total RNA of each anal swab and gut was extracted automatically using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) the cDNA was amplified using the 1stcDNA synthesis kit (TaKaRa) the amplicons were ligated into pMD18T vectors (TaKaRa) five clones of each amplicon were randomly picked for sequencing by the Sanger method on an ABI 3730 sequencer. the best-fit nucleotide substitution models were determined using Model Generator. for VP1, VP2, VP3, and NSP1, the HKY+ + I model was selected. for VP7, NSP4, and NSP5, the HKY+ model was selected. a total of 10 g of protein was boiled in 2 loading buffer (Tiangen) for 10 min, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) the blocked membrane was then incubated with mouse antibodies against MLSH14 and His at a 1:1,000 dilution. this study have been deposited under accession numbers KX814921 to KX814963."}
