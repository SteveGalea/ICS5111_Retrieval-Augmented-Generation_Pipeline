{"summary": "study of emotion classification belongs to the area of affective computing (AC) that aims to build computer systems capable of detecting and reacting to the user\u2019s emotions. a sub-branch of it, which is the focus of this study, concentrates on classifying emotions using physiological data. a viable approach is to combine a physiological approach with self-reporting. the latter is used to verify the existence of the target emotion. boredom can contribute to serious medical issues such as cardiovascular disease. study data Source Number of participants Shen et al. [2] HR, GSR, BP, EEG 1 Mandryk and Atkins [11] HR, GSR, Facial 12 Kim et al. [6] Eye-tracking, EEG 16 Giakoumis et al. [8] ECG, GSR 21 Seo et al. [7] EEG 28 D\u2019Mello et al. [12] Facial, Gesture 30 Ja physiology-based emotion detection based on physiological data are a vibrant research field that has produced a large body of studies. in our literature review, we searched previous studies in google Scholar with searching keywords of \u201cEmotion\u201d, \u201cBoredom\u201d, \u201cClassification\u201d, \u201cPhysiology\u201d and \u201cSensor\u201d. a universally accepted definition of boredom does not exist. some previous studies categorized boredom as a trait, while others handled it as a state. the meaning of a state is the current state of boredom that the person is experiencing. analysis on boredom suggested that boredom should be associated with increased autonomic nervous system activity. this linkage implies that a correlation may exist between boredom, EEG and GSR, but so far it has not been investigated in previous studies. study Accuracy Method Jaques et al.

[9] 94.2% Linear Discriminant Analysis Man an emergency kit was prepared as a countermeasure for accidents. all collected data were anonymized and stored securely in a password-protected data storage. a data collection protocol was designed with consideration of the participants\u2019 legal rights. Grove GSR sensor was used in this study, along with the finger band electrodes. the sensor calculates skin resistance using the MV input in ohms. the sensor was connected to an Arduino Uno device. participants answered a questionnaire to measure the strength of boredom that they felt. the questionnaires were designed to be answered on a 5-point scale. participants ages ranged from 20 to 34, with an average age of 23.62. the EEG sensor manufacturer, the electrodes are located at the positions FP1, FP2, TP9, and TP10 of the head [36]. the mapping of head locations was defined by Jasper [38], and it is used in neuroscience. the sensor captured raw EEG at a 220 Hz sampling rate. participants were presented a page showing a consent form of the experiment. the information on the consent form stated that we would use the collected data only anonymously for academic purposes. participants were instructed to stop the experiment anytime when they feel uncomfortable. the shortest data length was 7.13 s, thus only the last 7 s of each participant\u2019s data were extracted to build the models. other window sizes, such as 1 s and 0.5 s, were also tested. DASM and RASM are based on DE and utilize the electrical current asymmetry between the electrodes of the EEG sensors. in this study, we use the asymmetry between the electrodes and the values from each electrode at the same time to train classification models. RASM and DASM use locational symmetry for each electrode and DE value. MV, normalized MV (NMV) and SR were secured from the GSR data. six features were secured from the GSR data.

DASM and DASM are based on DE and utilize the electrical current asymmetry between the electrodes. MV, normalized MV (NMV) and SR were secured from the GSR data. similar to the feature extraction of the EEG data, we calculated the average and the standard deviation for each feature of the GSR data. a = (number of features + number of labels)/2, i = number of features, o = number of labels, t = number of features + number of labels, Ex) if 10 features and 2 labels are used, a, i, o, and t are 6, 10, 2, and 12, respectively (single hidden layer) istic Default Random Tree (RT) Default Random Forest (RF) Default Simple Logistic Default JRip Default REP Tree Default Zero R Default Nave Bayes (NB) Default KStar Default One R Default Network design parameter of MLP (Number of node per layer) if 10 features and 2 labels are used, a, i, o, and t are 6, 10, 2, and 12, respectively (single hidden layer) RF, MLP, and NB were ranked as the best algorithm for the EEG-GSR combined and EEG datasets.

Muller et al. [42] defined a model\u2019s discriminatory ability with AUC as follows: (1) excellent discrimination (AUC > = 0.90), (2) good discrimination (0.80 = AUC 0.90), (3) fair discrimination (0.70 = AUC 0.80), and (4) poor discrimination (0.60 = AUC 0.70). 0.655 11.9 MLP 70.03 76.79 60.71 0.744 0.796 0.683 163.49 5.4.2. analysis of the selected features Table 9 presents the features that the WSE algorithm selected for each model. all selected Gamma band features occur on FP2 as the right pie chart shows. all selected Gamma band features occur on FP2 as the right pie chart shows. an important property of a good classification model is the robustness of performance over multiple executions. a good model should be able to produce good classification results for different training and testing datasets. from this aspect, the MLP models classified boredom more robustly than the other models. shen et al. [2] separated their data into training sets but did not consider the random effect. the proposed model\u2019s performance (79.98%) is lower than that of the model proposed in our previous study. the findings are aligned with Bench and Lench [34]\u2019s suggestion that boredom should increase the autonomic nervous system activity. in our feature refinement results, the WSE algorithm recommended the EEG and GSR features on the best performing model for increasing performance. the recommended models may not be applicable to other age groups and people with health issues. we collected the data from Korean participants using non-boredom stimuli purposefully picked for this cultural context."}
