{"summary": "bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most significant health problem faced by feedlots worldwide. it is responsible for 70\u201380% of morbidities and 40\u201350% of mortalities in the united states. losses of at least $1 billion annually have been estimated considering costs of prevention, treatment, loss of productivity and labor. genetic dissection of loci underlying phenotypic variation has yet to be tackled. bronchial lymph nodes were chosen for analysis because immune response to pathogens in the lung is important to the host response. bronchial lymph nodes provide the best window into lymphocyte responses within the infected lung compartment. animal sampling and challenge The sampling of the experimental animals are described in a companion paper. steers produced by mating Angus sires to advanced generation Angus-Hereford crossbred dams were obtained from the University of California Davis. two control animals were aerosol administered with 8.5 ml of tissue culture media via a nebulizer and two additional control animals were inoculated by intratracheal instillation with 8.5 ml of phosphate buffered saline. one animal challenged with M. bovis was euthanized early due to extreme disease and tissues were not collected. RNA isolation and sequencing One milliliter of Trizol Reagent was added to 50\u2013100 mg of frozen bronchial lymph node sample. samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and 200 l of chloroform was added after another centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. RNA purity and concentration was established using a nanoDrop 1000 v1.3.2 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) polyadenylated RNA was purified from the total RNA using oligo dT magnetic beads. then fragmented with divalent cations under elevated temperature. cDNA underwent end repair and the 3\u2019 ends were adenylated. universal adapters were ligated to the cDNA fragments. topHat extracted transcript sequences and used Bowtie to align reads to the virtual transcriptome build. reads that could not be mapped to the virtual transcriptome were next mapped to the genome assembly. a total of 2 mismatches were allowed in alignment. iff estimates the FPKM for each transcript, primary transcript, and gene in each sample. the 200 with the largest FPKM variances across all biological replicates were used to construct a heatmap by hierarchical clustering analysis. us-hereford crossbred dams were obtained from the Sierra Field Station of the University of California Davis. steers seronegative, or with the lowest titers against each bacterial and viral pathogen, were selected. challenge studies were performed sequentially starting with the control animals. one animal challenged with M. bovis was euthanized early due to extreme disease. tissue culture media was given by aerosol to mimic one mechanism of viral exposure. clinical scores were recorded daily from 3 days before challenge. RNA isolation and sequencing One milliliter of Trizol Reagent was added to 50\u2013100 mg of frozen bronchial lymph node sample. samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and 200 l of chloroform was added after transferring the aqueous layer to a fresh tube. double-stranded cDNA underwent end repair and the 3\u2019 ends were adenylated. universal adapters were ligated to the cDNA fragments and solid phase PCR was performed to produce the sequencing library. each library was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and equimolar amounts from each library were pooled to create 5 pools. mapped to the virtual transcriptome were next mapped to the genome assembly. reads were converted to genomic mappings (spliced as necessary) and merged with novel transcriptome mappings and junctions. a total of 2 mismatches were allowed in alignment. genes, the 200 with the largest FPKM variances across all biological replicates were used to construct a heatmap by hierarchical clustering analysis. all data exploration and visualization was performed using the CummeRbund package [18] implemented in the R environment. the database for annotation, visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 [20] was used to annotate and interpret the DE gene lists produced by Cuffdiff. paired-end reads for each sample ranged from 78.7 to 87.5%. the overall read alignment rate achieved by TopHat ranged from 78.7 to 87.5%. a transcriptome assembly was merged across all animals using Cuffmerge. intron overlaps reference intron on opposite strand 0 0.00 Exonic overlap with reference on opposite strand 1,294 1.46 Repeat 0 0.00 Multiple classifications 0 0.00 Unknown, intergenic transcript 166 0.19 Total 88,581 100 Quality control and exploration of relationships between challenge groups. bact_0, bact_1 and bact_2 are M. bovis challenged; bact_3, bact_4, bact_5 and bact_6 are P. multocida challenged; bact_7, bact_8, bact_9 and bact_10 are M. haemolytica challenged; virus_0, virus_1, virus_2 and virus_3 are BRSV challenged. no. of Differentially Expressed Genes Comparison Up-regulated BRSV vs control 1,543 1,942 BVDV vs control 1,560 1,758 IBR vs control 2,071 2,052 M. haemolytica vs control 960 1,393 M. bovis vs control 366 778 The functional annotation analysis performed by DAVID for the DE genes found in the comparison of the BRSV challenged to control animals (S2 Table) the most important upstream regulators predicted for the response to BRSV challenge included lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tretinoin, TNF, TGFB1 and beta-estradiol. all other regulators were predicted to be activated in the challenged animals. the IPA identified the role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis (p2.38E-11), role of osteoblasts, osteoblasts and chondrocytes in rheumatoid arthritis (p5.15E-10), B cell receptor signaling (p3.81E-09), acute phase response signaling (p4.65E-09) and PI3k signaling in B lymphocytes (p only the activation statuses of TGFB1 and IFNG could be predicted. differences were found among the most significant of the upstream regulators. IL1B was identified for the M. bovis challenge. 200 genes, 25 were DE in all challenge groups, indicating that these genes are predictive of infection regardless of specific etiology. these genes are of significant biological interest for understanding the bovine pathogen-specific immune response. RSAD2, S100A8, S100A9, SFRP2, SFRP4, SLC6A15, TF, TGM3, ULBP3, VCAN and ZBP1 At least two viral pathogens FOSB, GFRA2, GZMB, NUPR1, WSCD2, AIRE, BPI, CDHR1, CHODL, CLEC10A, EDIL3, ESR2, IFITM3 and MCHR1. a GWAS has reported 116 genomic regions associated with BRDC susceptibility in Holstein calves. the 1 Mb regions flanking each QTL harbor 649 annotated candidate genes. some of the QTL regions contain at least six genes that were DE in response to multiple challenge pathogens. pathogens most commonly associated with BRDC, we first searched for bronchial lymph node transcript abundance variation among the 23 challenge and four control animals. one of the control animals failed to cluster with the other three biological control replicates in the MDS plot (PC1 vs PC2) and, consequently, it was excluded from the analysis. we generated an average of 49,360,049 (2 50 bp) paired-end reads for each sample and the overall read alignment rate achieved by TopH transcripts % Complete match of intron chain 25,197 28.45 A transfrag falling entirely within a reference intron 72 0.08 Potentially novel isoform (fragment) 60,526 68.33 Single exon transfrag overlapping a reference exon and at least 10 bp of a reference intron 0 0.00 Generic exonic overlap with a reference transcript 1,323 1.49 Possible polymerase run-on fragment 1 0.00 An intron of the transfrag overlaps a log10 transformed FPKM values for each gene calculated for each biological replicate. the median FPKM values across the challenge groups were similar. the ranges indicate that depth of sequence coverage was sufficient. differential expression and functional annotations were performed separately for each pathogen challenge group. these analyses identified from 329 DE genes for the M. bovis vs control comparison to 4,123 for the IBR vs control comparison. log2(fold change) was used to partition DE genes into up- and down-regulated groups. mitochondrial dysfunction (p4.15E-20), protein ubiquitination (p3.06E-11), role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis (p3.24E-09) and glucocorticoid receptor signaling (p2.33E-08) the most important upstream regulators predicted for the response to BRSV challenge included: lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tretinoi most significant upstream regulators were predicted to include PPBP (TGB1), TNF, IRF6 (LPS), TP53 and dexamethasone (S5 Table). the IPA identified the role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis (p2.38E-11), role of osteoblasts, osteoblasts and chondrocytes. agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis (p8.84E-15), type I diabetes mellitus signaling (p1.7E-08) and role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis (p4.12E-08) were identified by IPA. only the activation statuses of TGFB1 and IFNG could be predicted. clusters for IBR and M. haemolytica each contained a member from a different challenge pathogen and replicates for M. bovis and P. multocida were not well clustered. this is consistent with the finding that these challenge groups had the fewest DE genes (Table 2) since the strategy for gene sampling primarily selected genes with large expression variances.

Regulatory Subunit 15A (PPP1R15A) were located in the syntenic QTL region at 55\u201356 Mb. the 10 genes in this QTL region were found to only be DE in response to challenge by the three viral pathogens. the innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) the list of PRRs which are known to sense PAMPs is extensive. the list of PRRs which are known to sense PAMPs is extensive. kines by innate immune cells occurs as an acute response to inflammation and infection across diverse etiologies. the release of cytokines orchestrates immune responses through communication with other cells. an effective immune response to BRSV, IBR and BVDV requires the development of cytotoxic T cells. our results suggest that TLR1 and TLR6 mediate the innate immune response to M. haemolytica while TLR2 and TLR4 mediate response to infection by IBR and other viruses. we also found evidence of adaptive immune response mechanisms, in particular the enrichment of DE genes within the B and T cell receptor signaling pathways. the most enriched functional clusters were mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation (S2 Table) neurodegenerative disease-related pathways including Huntington\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases were induced in the animals challenged with BRSV and IBR. anti-TNF is currently being used to treat human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, for example, rheumatoid arthritis. 20 of the 5,757 DE genes were common to all pathogen challenges. this drug has been associated with decreased immune responses. bronchial lymph node gene expression signatures characterize the immune response and are predictive of the pathogens responsible for BRDC in cattle. the difficulty in achieving a single infection with any of the BRDC pathogens was underscored by our use of commercial animals. a set of the 200 most variable of the DE genes was able to partially classify each replicate into its respective challenge group. key upstream regulators were identified which provide possible targets for the development of novel molecular therapies and studies exploring the effects of manipulating their signaling on bovine immune function should be considered. list of differentially expressed genes found for the BVDV vs control comparison and enriched GO terms from the DAVID analyses. tabs are identified according to the type of DAVID analysis performed. tabs are identified according to the type of DAVID analysis performed. list of differentially expressed genes found for the P. multocida vs control comparison and enriched GO terms."}
