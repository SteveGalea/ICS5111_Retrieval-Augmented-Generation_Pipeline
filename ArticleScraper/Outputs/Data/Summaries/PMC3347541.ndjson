{"summary": "in its simplest form, a DNA\u2013vaccine is a plasmid containing a gene of the pathogenic protein and the elements needed to transcribe this gene in mammalian cells. it is then transcribed, and the encoded antigen is synthesized initiating an immune response. this approach is promising because of the simplicity and low cost of production and transportation of DNA\u2013vaccines as compared to the traditional vaccines. novel methods of DNA\u2013vaccine administration include supplementing vaccine formulation with cytokines and/or chemokines or their genes. modifying the immunogen can be achieved by \u201clabeling\u201d the protein with specialized signal sequences. this review focuses on the signals directing protein into various cellular compartments and their use for DNA\u2013vaccine design. processing of an antigen via the MHC\u2013I pathway determines the type of immune response it induces. antigen localization Main processing compartment Antigen presenting complex Recognition cells of the immune system Stimulated immune response Inside the cell Proteosome MHC-I CD8+ Cytotoxic Outside the cell Lysosome MHC-II CD4+ Cellular. ubiquitin\u2013conjugating system recognizes various proteasome degradation signals. signals can represent a specific amino acid sequence, a specific pattern of protein phosphorylation, or alterations in the protein structure, often missfolding. the first signal discovered was the N\u2013degron. the antigen (re)targeting into proteasome can be achieved by cloning an Ub\u2013encoding sequence onto the 5 \u2013terminus of the target gene. in the cell, Ub is cleaved off in a posttranslational modification of the chimeric protein catalyzed by the C\u2013terminal ubiquitin hydrolase, thus exposing the N\u2013degron. fusion with the proteasome\u2013targeting signals did not result in an increased degradation rate. no enhancement in immunogenic performance was observed after a similar modification of DNA\u2013immunogen expressing nucleocapsid (core) protein of Hepatitis C virus. the antizyme binds to the N\u2013terminal region of ODC, directing it to the proteasome while the antizyme is released. the minimal signal required for rapid degradation of ODC in the proteasome is a 37\u2013residue C\u2013terminal stretch of amino acids. the ubiquitin\u2013conjugating system is a multi\u2013stage mechanism with a complex regulation. fusion of calreticulin to the tumor antigens was used to improve the immune response against tumor cells. a DNA\u2013vaccine encoded a fusion of CRT with 7 protein of human papilloma virus 16 (HPV\u201316) was created. a fusion\u2013protein of CRT with another HPV\u201316 protein E6 also improved the antigen\u2013specific CD8+ T\u2013cell immune response in mice. antigen is cleaved by acidic proteases and the resulting peptides are loaded onto the MHC\u2013II molecules and brought to the cell surface. this leads to the stimulation of cellular (Th1\u2013type) and humoral (Th2\u2013type) immunity. tyrosine\u2013 and dileucine signals have a consensus motif NPXY or YXX. the consensus sequence of the dileucine signals is (DE)XXXL(LI) or DXXLL. signals are recognized by the adaptor protein AP or by related complexes. a strong immune response of the mixed Th1/Th2\u2013type was raised against the wild and drug\u2013resistant HIV\u20131 reverse transcriptases. fusion with LAMP\u20131 increased the immunogenicity of DNA immunogens encoding flavivirus envelope proteins. cytoplasmic domains of E were replaced by similar domains of LAMP\u20131. a similar prototype DNA\u2013vaccine was designed against the west Nile virus. a plasmid was constructed expressing a chimeric fusion protein of HCV nuclecapsid protein with signal\u2013 and C\u2013terminal LAMP\u20131 sequences. direction into the lysosome by fusing the immunogen to LAMP\u20131 does not necessarily ensure an enhancement of the Th\u20132 type immune response. two sorting signals were found in the cytoplasmic domain of Ii. autophagy effectively directs cytoplasmic proteins into presentation via the secretory pathway. fusion of HIV\u20131 Gag and E proteins to the secretory chemokine MCP3 directed these viral proteins into the secretory pathway. macaques immunized with the chimeras and infected with a pathogenic SIVmac251 had lower viral loads than the infected na ve animals. DNA\u2013vaccine technology opens a wide range of possibilities for creating effective vaccines. signal sequences can be introduced into the immunogens to direct them into a predetermined processing and presentation pathway. direction onto the MHC\u2013II pathway would activate T\u2013helper cells and stimulate both cellular and humoral responses."}
