{"summary": "renin angiotensin system (RAS) converts angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang II. ACE2 counterbalances activated ACE/Ang II pathway through degradation of Ang II. in kidney disease secondary to subtotal nephrectomy, kidney ACE and Ang II are increased [9\u201313]. short-term DIZE decreased kidney cortical ACE activity and ameliorated the reduction in kidney ACE2 expression and activity in STNx rats [13] ramipril lowered blood pressure and inhibited cardiac ACE2 activity. we also showed that ramipril lowered blood pressure and inhibited cardiac ACE2 activity. rats were randomly allocated to the presumed ACE2 activator DIZE (2 weeks s.c. 15mg/kg/day, n = 8) via osmotic minipump. on day 14, rats were anaesthetised with intraperitoneal (i.p.) sodium pentobarbitone (60 mg/kg/body weight), and cardiac haemodynamics were determined using a micro-tipped pressure transducer catheter (Millar, 1.5F) plasma was separated, snap-frozen and stored at 80\u00b0C. the heart was removed, weighed and the LV was transversely dissected. the remainder of the LV was snap-frozen in isopentane and stored at -80\u00b0C. LV sections were homogenised in 5mM EDTA solution containing protease inhibitor. aprotinin, bestatin, 1.4mM E-64, 2mM leupeptin and 1.5mM pepstatin A were frozen at -80\u00b0C to aid in cell disruption. radioimmunoassays for Ang II and Ang 1\u20137 have been described previously. 100g of membrane protein was incubated in duplicate with an ACE2 quenched fluorescent substrate (QFS), 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-acetyl-Ala-Pro-Lys (2, 4-dintirophenyl); Auspep, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. the specific activity was determined using 100M EDTA which has a similar effect to inhibit ACE2 as the specific ACE2 inhibitor, MLN4760. effect of DIZE on cardiac ACE binding was also assessed using ex vivo autoradiography on LV sections (20m) sections were incubated with serial dilutions of DIZE or the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat (1010 to 103 mol/l) (n = 4 per concentration) cDNA was synthesized with a reverse transcriptase reaction using standard techniques. cDNA was synthesized with a reverse transcriptase reaction. rats were housed in a 12:12h light-dark cycle, with ad libitum food containing 0.4\u20130.6% NaCl (Norco) and water. rats were randomly allocated to the presumed ACE2 activator DIZE (2 weeks s.c. 15mg/kg/day, n = 8) via osmotic minipump. rats were anaesthetised with intraperitoneal (i.p.) sodium pento plasma was separated, snap-frozen and stored at 80\u00b0C. LV was transversely dissected into 3 pieces, with one piece fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for histopathology. plasma and cardiac angiotensin peptides Blood for the measurement of angiotensin peptides were collected and stored as described above. angiotensin peptide content is expressed per mg of protein content of each individual sample. the rate of substrate cleavage was determined by comparison to a standard curve of the product His-Leu. 100g of membrane protein was incubated in duplicate with an ACE2 quenched fluorescent substrate (QFS), (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-acetyl-Ala-Pro-Lys (2, 4-dintirophenyl); auspep, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. ACE and ACE2 activity was measured as described above. results expressed as nmole of substrate cleaved/mg of protein/hr. effect of DIZE on cardiac ACE binding was also assessed. the percentage area of chromogen staining was determined by calculating the number of selected pixels (positively stained areas) as a percentage of the total area within a given field. cDNA was synthesized with a reverse transcriptase reaction using standard techniques. two-tailed P-values 0.05 were considered significant. rats had reduced body weight (P0.01) and kidney impairment. treatment with DIZE did not alter circulating RAS components. systolic blood pressure and cardiac function and structure STNx rats had increased systolic blood pressure (Fig 1A, P0.001) and cardiac hypercontractility (Fig 1B, P0.05) diastolic dysfunction was present with impaired active relaxation shown by a reduction in min dP/dt (Fig 1C, P0.05) nephrectomy (STNx) rats (n = 8/group) consists of representative photomicrographs of left ventricular total collagen content (red staining) (magnification x200) data expressed as meanSEM. 1.00 0.23 1.48 0.24 3.92 0.54*** 2.52 0.37# ADAM17 (arbitrary units) 1.00 0.16 1.12 0.14 1.80 0.27* 1.13 0.09# Data expressed as meanSEM. s. DIZE treatment reduced cardiac Ang II levels (P0.05) and Ang 1\u20137 levels remained unchanged. in control rats, DIZE reduced cardiac Ang II levels (P0.05) ex vivo effect of DIZE and ACE inhibition with ramiprilat on cardiac ACE was also examined. ramiprilat inhibited cardiac ACE but DIZE had no effect on ACE binding. rats had reduced body weight (P0.01) and kidney impairment. plasma RAS Components ACE activity (nmol/ml/hr) 5.6 0.6 5.3 0.2 7.1 0.4* 6.5 0.4 Ang II (fmol/ml) 28.4 3.4 29.6 2.9 70.9 18.4* 60.6 11.2 Ang 1\u20137 (fmol/ml) diastolic blood pressure (A), ventricular contractility (B), ventricular relaxation (C) and time constant of isovolumic relaxation (Tau; D) in Control (Cont) and subtotal nephrectomy (STNx) rats (n = 8/group) data expressed as meanSEM. control subtotal nephrectomy Vehicle DIZE Vehicle DIZE (15 mg/kg/day) (15 mg/kg/day) (n = 8) (n = 8) (n = 8) ACE (arbitrary units) 1.00 0.22 1.34 0.24 1.99 0.32* 1.69 0.33 ACE2 (arbitrary units) 1.00 0.13 1.16 0.18 1.46 0.17* 1.41 0.12 BNP (arbitrary units) 1.00 0.22 0.97 0.19 4.13 0.56*** 2. DIZE shifts the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile in STNx. left ventricular (LV) ACE (A) and ACE2 activity (B), ACE/ACE2 activity ratio (C), LV Ang II (D) and Ang 1\u20137 (E) peptide content were increased in control rats compared to control. correlation analysis shows increased left ventricular (LV) ACE2 activity is associated with increased LV ACE activity (A) and plasma ACE2 activity (B), with no correlation between LV tissue and plasma ACE. control and subtotal nephrectomy rats without active treatment were used for the correlation analysis. correlation analysis shows increased left ventricular (LV) ACE2 activity is associated with increased LV ACE activity (A) and plasma ACE2 activity (B), with no correlation between LV tissue and plasma ACE. control and subtotal nephrectomy (STNx) rats without active treatment were used for the correlation analysis. activity in LV membrane preps (100g per well) from control (n = 4) and subtotal nephrectomy (n = 4) rats. the ACE inhibitor, ramiprilat caused a concentration-dependent displacement of specific 125I-MK351A binding from rat LV ACE and DIZE had no effect on ACE binding (C) ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart and is an important regulator of cardiac function [31, 32] in vivo, the effect of DIZE on cardiac ACE2 contrasts with previous results. the finding that DIZE was associated with down regulation of ADAM17 mRNA led us to speculate that DIZE may have indirect effects to maintain cardiac ACE2 activity levels and thus reduce cardiac Ang II. this hypothesis would be consistent with reports that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of ADAM17 prevented shedding of ACE2. in hypercholesterolemic mice on a wild-type or ACE2 deficient background with Ang II induced abdominal aortic aneurysms [34], 4-weeks of intramuscular DIZE (30mg/kg) increased kidney ACE2 mRNA and activity in wild-type mice. the precise mechanism of action of DIZE remains unclear. the reduction in cardiac ACE activity in STNx with DIZE is likely to be an indirect effect due to reduced cardiac damage and thus less ACE activation. the degree of ACE inhibition with DIZE is less than that would be expected with an ACE inhibitor [14, 19], and ACE inhibition usually results in a fall in blood pressure. DIZE is used for the treatment of trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness. side effects may preclude its widespread clinical use. specific compounds that selectively amplify ACE2 activity will be needed."}
