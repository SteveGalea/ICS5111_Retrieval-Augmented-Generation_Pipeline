{"summary": "syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. there is no vaccine approved to prevent RSV infection or minimize symptoms of infection. there is no specific and effective treatment against RSV. the importance of EPAC in other viral infections has not been explored. there have been no studies investigating the role of EPAC in host responses to viral infections. this is the very first demonstration of regulatory functions of EPAC2 in RSV infection. ESI-09 inhibited the activity of EPAC1 and EPAC2 with respective apparent 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 10.8 M and 4.4 M. these IC50 values are well below the concentrations shown to induce protein denaturation. cells were exposed to ESI-09 for 2 h, followed by RSV infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 15 h. RPMI 2650 cells with ESI-09 posttreatment had significantly decreased replication compared to control cells. nontoxicity of ESI-09 on cells was also supported by its inhibitory effect on cytopathic effect (CPE) formation in RPMI 2650 cells. infected control cells also had a significant drop in genome copies at 24 h p.i. compared with control cells at 15 h p.i.. this drop was possibly due to RSV-induced pathogenic environment. many cells detached and became unhealthy at 24 h p.i. at 15 h p.i., total viruses were harvested and titers determined. the effect of ESI-09 on RSV replication was also done for RPMI 2650 cells (right, posttreatment only) data shown are representative of three independent experiments. at 6, 15, or 24 h posttreatment, total RNA was extracted and subjected to qRT-PCR to measure RSV genome copies. at 48 h p.i., total viruses were harvested for titration. single and double asterisks represent P values of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. a549 or RPMI 2650 cells were infected with ESI-09 at a much higher dose (MOI of 5), so that detectable cytokines/chemokines can be induced at early time points p.i. some cytokines/chemokines became detectable in A549 and RPMI 2650 cells at 4 h p.i., and the induced mediators were significantly inhibited. no significant difference in RSV genome copies was observed in response to ESI-09 treatment. ESI-09 treatment led to significantly less infectious particles in infected SAE cells. ESI-09 could suppress RSV-induced cytokines/chemokines directly. NF-B is a superfamily of ubiquitous transcription factors composed of NF-B1 or p50, NF-B2 or p52, RelA or p65, and c-Rel proteins. in response to viral infection, the nuclear translocation of IRFs and NF-B proteins is a key step to the transcription of target genes, including those critical for inflammation. ESI-09 inhibits RSV-induced NF-B and IRF-3 activation. p50 was blocked by ESI-09 at 6 and 15 h p.i. in both A549 and RPMI 2650 cells. p65 in RPMI 2650 cells was blocked by ESI-09. the NF-B and IRF band intensity was normalized by the mean intensity of lamin B. the mean intensity of lamin B was expressed as mean SE. EPAC1 and EPAC2 are present in the lung. scrambled siRNA was used as a negative control (siCN) at 1 for 15 h posttransfection, cells were mock infected or infected with RSV at an MOI of 1. progeny viruses had impaired function in CPE formation. syncytia developed by progeny viruses from EPAC2 KD were significantly smaller. HEp-2 cells were used to titrate total viruses harvested and shown in panel A. at day 2 postinfection, HEp-2 cells were fixed, followed by immunostaining. plaques were observed using a phase-contrast microscope. most control and EPAC1 KD RPMI 2650 cells fused together after infection. however, the configuration of EPAC2 KD cells was kept intact after infection. fewer infectious particles were found in EPAC2 KD RPMI 2650 cells. luciferase reporter plasmids harboring binding sites of transcriptional factors NF-B or IRF-3 were transfected into the MEFs. luciferase reporter plasmids harboring binding sites of transcriptional factors NF-B or IRF-3 were transfected into the MEFs. we compared the nuclear translocation of NF-B and IRF-3 in WT and EPAC2 KO cells. the effect of EPAC2 on the activation of transcription factors confirmed a direct role of EPAC2 in innate response to RSV infection. at 2 h p.i., 20 M cycloheximide was added as indicated. untreated cells were used as controls. at 6 or 15 h p.i., total cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting using an anti-RSV antibody. a small-molecule ESI-05 has been characterized as a specific and potent EPAC2 antagonist (45) it inhibits cAMP-mediated EPAC2 guanine exchange factor (GEF) activity with an IC50 of 0.5 M but shows no inhibition of EPAC1 activity at 25 M. ESI-05 treatment led to less induction of chemokines/cytokines. EPAC2 is of importance to regulate both RSV replication and associated inflammation. therefore, it could be a promising therapeutic target to control pulmonary RSV load and RSV-induced pathogenesis. the EPAC2-specific siRNA and inhibitors also have a therapeutic application for RSV treatment. MERS-CoV is a positive single-stranded virus, while RSV is a negative single-stranded virus (19, 20). both are respiratory RNA viruses: MERS-CoV is a positive single-stranded virus, while RSV is a negative single-stranded virus (19, 20). to investigate whether EPAC also plays a general role in RSV replication. posttreatment with 5 M ESI-09 also led to remarkable reduction of RSV titer. RPMI 2650 is a human nasal epithelial cell line that has been widely used as an upper respiratory tract cell model for RSV infection. treatment with 10 M H89 did not affect RSV production in either A549 or RPMI 2650 cells. the anti-RSV effect of ESI-09 was confirmed by examining viral genome copies using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) in response to RSV infection, ESI-09 treatment led to fewer viral genome copies at 24 h p.i., compared with control cells at 15 and 24 h p.i. ESI-09 treatment resulted in a log10 reduction in infectious particles at 48 h p.i., suggesting the long-lasting efficacy of ESI-09. the results demonstrate that ESI-09 has an anti-RSV effect in both lower and upper airway epithelial cells. at 15 h posttreatment, cells were observed using a phase-contrast microscope. A549 or RPMI 2650 cells were infected with RSV, followed by treatment with 10 M H89. at 15 h posttreatment, viruses were harvested for titration. ESI-09 inhibits RSV-induced cytokines and chemokines in A549 and RPMI 2650 cells. at 2 h p.i., the whole medium replaced with fresh medium containing 5 M ESI-09. at 2 h p.i., the whole medium replaced with fresh medium containing 5 M ESI-09. some cytokines/chemokines became detectable in A549 and RPMI 2650 cells at 4 h p.i., and the induced mediators were significantly inhibited by ESI-09. ESI-09 treatment led to significantly less infectious particles in infected SAE cells (MOI of 1 for 15 h) the direct effect of ESI-09 on cytokines/chemokines was also assessed. titration data shown in panel A, net induction data shown in panel B and genome copies shown in panel C are representative of three independent experiments. ESI-09 inhibits proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines via blocking IRF- and NF-B-dependent pathways. in ESI-09-free cells, infection led to enhanced nuclear translocation of IRF-3, p65, and p50 at 6 and 15 h p.i. but the inhibitory effect of ESI-09 on RSV-activated p65 in RPMI 2650 cells was not as significant as its effect on p65 in A549 (A) or RPMI 2650 (B) cells were infected with ESI-09. nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blotting. lamin B was used as a control for equal loading of the samples. the role of EPAC1 and EPAC2 as a target for cancer therapeutics has been extensively demonstrated (42) therefore, it is possible that EPAC1 and EPAC2 also have distinct roles in controlling virus infection and/or inflammation. for precise drug design and therapy development against RSV pathogenesis and virus replication, it is important to determine which EPAC isoform(s) contribute to antiviral responses and inflammation. the scrambled siRNA was used as a control (siCN) at 48 h posttransfection, cells were mock infected or infected with RSV at an MOI of 1. at 15 h p.i., cells from a 6-well plate were harvested for RSV titration. whole-genome sequencing suggested there were no mutations in other regions of RSV. since F protein was suppressed by EPAC2 KD, it is possible that the viral progeny had less assembled F proteins on their surfaces, resulting in impaired viral entry and subsequently smaller plaques. total viruses harvested from RPMI 2650 cells were titrated in HEp-2 cells using immunostaining. data are representative of three independent experiments and means SE. abundance of viral proteins in wild-type (WT) and EPAC2 knockout (KO) cells were comparable at both 6 and 15 h p.i., suggesting that regulated cellular responses by EPAC2 are unlikely to be associated with virus replication. luciferase reporter plasmids harboring binding sites of transcriptional factors NF-B or IRF-3 were transfected into the MEFs. EPAC2 KO MEFs produced less IL-1, MIP-1, MIP-1, MCP-1, and TNF- than WT MEFs. these data demonstrate that EPAC2 directly regulates RSV-induced host immunity. at 30 h posttransfection, cells were mock infected or infected with RSV. at 15 h p.i., nuclear extracts of cells were prepared and subjected to Western blotting using an anti-IRF-3, anti-p65, or anti-p50 antibody. induction of inflammatory mediators was significant after SAE cells were infected with RSV for 4 h. ESI-05 treatment led to less induction of chemokines/cytokines. data supported the importance of EPAC2 in controlling RSV replication and associated inflammation. natants were harvested, followed by RT-PCR to quantify the genome. the net induction of proinflammatory mediators and viral genome data are representative of three independent experiments. DISCUSSION RSV is a leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in children as well as in other populations. chemokine inhibition by RANTES antibodies showed a profound reduction in airway hyperreactivity in mice, resulting in a decrease in lung pathology and damage (12). properly regulating RSV-induced airway epithelial host responses can be a key step for intervention strategies. cAMP is a second messenger which plays an essential role in many biological processes. the effect of cAMP/PKA and cAMP/EPAC signaling on viral replication seems virus dependent. replication of MERS-CoV is controlled by EPAC1 (48) EPAC2 has three subtypes: EPAC2A, EPAC2B, and EPAC2C. compared to other EPACs, EPAC2C is the only isoform with two additional domains, cNBD-B and RA. viral titer was determined by immunostaining in HEp-2 cells. monoclonal antibody against -actin was from Sigma (A1978) primary antibodies against lamin B (sc-374015), p50 (sc-8414), IRF-3 (sc-9082) and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (sc-2031) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. total cellular lysates or cytosol and nuclear extracts were prepared for uninfected or infected cells as previously described. protein quantified with a protein quantification kit from Bio-Rad. membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS-Tween 20 and incubated with the proper primary antibodies according to manufacturer's instructions. cells were transfected with luciferase reporter gene plasmids containing multiple copies of NF-B binding sites (NF-B-Luc) or the IRF-3 binding site (PRDIII-I-Luc and IRF-3-Luc) at 30 h posttransfection, cells were infected with RSV for 15 h and lysed to measure luciferase reporter activity. monoclonal antibody against -actin was from Sigma (A1978) primary antibodies against lamin B (sc-374015), p50 (sc-8414), IRF-3 (sc-9082) and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (sc-2031) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) protein quantification kit from Bio-Rad followed by fractionation using denaturing gels. membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS-Tween 20. Embryos were placed in prechilled phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) MEFs cells were transfected with luciferase reporter gene plasmids. at 30 h posttransfection, cells were infected with RSV for 15 h. a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant."}
