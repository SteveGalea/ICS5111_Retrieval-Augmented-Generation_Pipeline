{"summary": "access to investigational products during the EVD epidemic occurred via uncontrolled single-patient-use Emergency Investigational New Drug (EIND) authorization from the FDA. many investigational products did not have existing clinical protocols for humans and had limited data available on pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing, and safety in humans. development of protocols was influenced by uncertainties in the international research community regarding the ethical acceptability of withholding treatments with inadequate prior testing in humans. clinical data were shared in weekly international clinical calls to inform care of new EVD patients. this was made possible through both federal and local efforts, as well as private industry participation. federal agencies coordinated information sharing regarding medical countermeasures and compassionate use. NETEC was created to increase the capability of public health and healthcare systems to safely and effectively manage individuals infected with suspected and confirmed special pathogens13. NETEC was charged with several core responsibilities, including readiness assessment and metric development, education, training, and provision of technical assistance. in 2016, NETEC expanded to include developing infrastructure to support clinical research readiness for future epidemics. the SPRN is developing infrastructure through which research can be incorporated into the care of patients at the RESPTCs. the goal of the network is to markedly improve clinical research readiness for EVD and other special pathogens in the united states. the MCM working group is assessing existing literature and unpublished findings from federal, academic, and industry partners. to acquire this supporting scientific evidence, the working group is assessing existing literature and unpublished findings from federal, academic, and industry partners. this includes EVD as well as other special pathogens that would utilize investigational MCMs as the primary therapeutic. Currently being used in N. Kivu outbreak in DRC. Approved for monitored emergency use of unregistered and investigational interventions (MEURI) in current outbreak in DRC. treatment study during west africa outbreak used historical controls; lower CFR (20%) if cycle threshold (CT) 20; 91% if 20.23 Approved for MEURI in current outbreak in DRC. convalescent plasma Varies Biologic Provide anti-EBOV antibodies Studies have not shown a clear benefit. nine deliverables were created in the SPRN contract to benchmark progress in the creation of a network that can support special pathogen research. these activities meet several of the goals and objectives outlined in the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy. the SPRN central IRB has capitalized on this rapid response model with preexisting signed reliance agreements. this allows for review of clinical protocols on an expedited timeline. this was used successfully during the outbreak to review research protocols associated with several investigational drugs. the lack of a standardized protocol to guide the administration of MCMs and prospectively collect clinical data during the course of a patient's illness was one of the challenges during the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic. the SPRN protocol workgroup is taking on the development of a master clinical observation protocol that is similar to existing protocols. this protocol can be amended to include use of an investigational MCM, all working through the central IRB. the biorepository working group continues to develop standard operating procedures for processing and storing specimens from these patients. the SPRN has created a governance structure responsible for prioritizing specimen use by potential collaborators. this was established to ensure a fair, transparent, and safe process for providing access to valuable and likely limited specimens. the SPRN couples testing and assessment of research readiness with field exercises for special pathogens research. exercises serve as a cornerstone of the all-hazards approach to preparedness, including for infectious diseases. the concept of integrating special pathogens research in the field has not been implemented widely. the SPRN central IRB has capitalized on this rapid response model with preexisting signed reliance agreements. these are signed by 2 or more institutions engaged in human subjects research and allow 1 or more institutions to cede review to another IRB. other partners could potentially be brought into the network, as needed, during an epidemic. the SPRN protocol workgroup is taking on the development of a master clinical observation protocol that is similar to existing protocols. the goal is to standardize the clinical data that are collected at all SPRN institutions, thus allowing data analysis in aggregate. this information will also be available to other institutions if they sign a reliance agreement for the central IRB. the SPRN has developed biocontainment unit standard operating procedures to address staffing models and requirements, risk mitigation, informed consent, data collection and documentation, use of investigational therapeutics, handling and local storage of specimens, specimen processing and transport. the SPRN couples testing and assessment of research readiness with field exercises for special pathogens research. annual NETEC site consultations to RESPTC facilities have recently incorporated clinical care exercises during the visits. options include activation of the research infrastructure needed to support a scientific evaluation of prophylactic and containment measures, diagnostics, and therapeutics related to Ebola virus."}
