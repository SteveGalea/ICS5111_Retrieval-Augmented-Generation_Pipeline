{"summary": "mRNA was held near zero force for 3 s to allow time for folding. tethered RNA was held near zero force for 3 s to allow time for folding. these force ramps mimicked the situation during 1 PRF. changes in structure were monitored by plotting force as a function of the molecular extension, generating force-extension curves (FECs) repeated unfolding of the same molecule revealed different patterns of rips of different length in these FECs. the same set of LcU values from the WLC fits were seen for refolding as for unfolding (SI Appendix, Table S2) the same set of intermediate structures were sampled. seven structures were found to match the observed LcU values within experimental error. partially folded version of PKD, denoted by PKD, which unfolded over a broad range of forces. fully and partially folded versions of the double-hairpin also proposed by Moomau et al. tertiary structure unfolding generally involves broader force distributions and higher forces than secondary structure unfolding (16, 39) the sole exception was PKD, whose unusually low unfolding force reflected the low-stability contacts at the 3\u2032 end of stem 2, as revealed in SHAPE data (21). FECs with antisense oligos showed only the low unfolding forces characteristic of secondary structures. with oligo 2 present, high-force unfolding events corresponding to PKA and PKD were observed, but transitions corresponding to DHP and DHP were not, consistent with the structural models in A. states with the LcU and unfolding force values expected for DHP, DHP, and PKD were not observed in the presence of oligo 2. oligo 2 can invade stem 2 of PKD by 2 nt, shortening the expected length change on unfolding by 1.3 nm. PKD and DHP had similar unfolding forces and contour lengths. PKD unfolded only via PKD, which could be readily identified by its distinctive LcU value and unfolding force. the same 2 distinct pathways are seen for both unfolding and refolding. the low occupancy of DHP compared with DHP could reflect the presence of transitions into DHP occurring at forces sufficiently low so as to preclude their ready identification. attempts to detect such transitions using an analysis sensitive to low-force transitions were unsuccessful. the unfolding force of pseudoknots is often sufficiently high so as to make hairpin intermediates very short-lived. only the stem 1 intermediate (S1A) of PKA was seen, and none of the hairpin intermediates for PKD or PKD were observed. however, this behavior is contrary to the standard hierarchy of events seen during unfolding. the existence of direct transitions from the double hairpin to PKA suggests that unfolding of the 3\u2032 hairpin in DHP is likely coordinated cooperatively with stem 2 formation in PKA. the seemingly incompatible structures proposed on the basis of bioinformatic predictions were in fact all present, with their incompatibility resolved by their existence on separate, mutually exclusive pathways. the probability of undergoing some form of structural transition in the FECs as a function of force is highly peaked in the range of forces just below the force at which ribosomes have been observed to stall during translation. the stimulatory structure would be expected to pass through the force range most likely to induce conformational transitions multiple times, analogous to the conditions present in the SMFS measurements. the diversity of structures formed by the WNV frameshift signal at zero force raises the question of whether it is meaningful to speak of a single \u201cnative\u201d structure stimulating frameshifting. the fact that the WNV frameshift signal exhibits the most complex, heterogeneous dynamics yet observed in any frameshift signal. RNA transcripts were made containing the Renilla luciferase gene in the 0 frame upstream of the firefly luciferase in the 1 frame. frameshifting efficiency was then measured from the luciferase luminescence ratio as described previously (58) and compared with values for negative and positive controls."}
