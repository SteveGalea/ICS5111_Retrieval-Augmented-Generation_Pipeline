{"summary": "the net benefit to health and well-being afforded by vaccination has been triumphant across nearly 300 years of use. a recent analysis of public records in the united states concluded that vaccines prevented 103.1 million cases of communicable and environmental disease over the past 90 years. this accomplishment supported another benefit, the increase in life expectancy of 30.4 years over the same time period. the value of prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases remains undisputed in the scientific, medical, and public policy communities. significant advances in knowledge and technology are now helping to rapidly expand product development goals for immunization beyond the traditional and proven capabilities of vaccinology. adjuvants are presently developed through more deductive design and testing. the informed incorporation of adjuvant materials will continue to be an essential component of forthcoming vaccines. the informed incorporation of adjuvant materials will continue to be an essential component of forthcoming vaccines. the first immunologic adjuvants emerged from medical necessity, regulatory pressures, and scientific discovery. in the early 20th century, difficulties accompanied the initial toxoid type vaccines which comprised dilute active toxin administered with antitoxin. tanus-contaminated diphtheria antiserum caused the death of 13 children in St. Louis. shortly afterward 9 children died in new jersey from tetanus contaminated smallpox vaccine. the biologics control Act of 1902 launched federal requirements for annual licensing and inspections of biologics manufacturers. aluminum phosphate improves precipitation of diphtheria toxoid. aluminum phosphate improves precipitation of diphtheria toxoid. aluminum salt adjuvants for some licensed vaccines are not publically released. the blue bars represent the time needed to develop and implement one or more vaccines derived from the same technology. the only other adjuvant classes used in currently licensed vaccines include emulsions systems, liposomes and toll-like receptor (TLR-based compounds) o/w emulsion formulations without mycobacterium were less viscous so easier to prepare and inject. o/w emulsion adjuvants are being evaluated in preclinical and clinical testing. the synthetic compound MPL is the only TLR class of adjuvant presently used in a US licensed vaccine. the discovery of bacterial endotoxin in the late 1890s spurred the advance of immunologic adjuvants. the wide study of immune-stimulating bacterial components converged in the 1990s. the identification of TLRs (10 in human), nod-like receptors (NLRs, 3 classes), and other PRRs has revolutionized the science and practice of vaccine adjuvant characterization and development. single driver of innovation and improvements in adjuvant technology is now scientific knowledge and information. this shared endeavor will benefit from comprehensive, descriptive reporting and networking of data and results from testing that is designed and performed with standards then communicated with universal scientific meaning. immunologic adjuvants are now being engineered to alter the natural adaptive immune response to an antigen for increased potency and duration. ated, inactivated and split virion vaccines do not require adjuvant because they are T-cell independent. carbohydrate antigens directly bind B-cells to elicit activation and proliferation without MHC-restricted T-cell help. this response generally is of short duration with no affinity maturation and fails to elicit immunologic memory. s1-6 located on the plasma membrane of immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, etc.) recognize PAMPs from the surface of bacterial and fungal pathogens such as LPS and flagellin. endosomally located TLR3 and TLRs7-9 recognize viral and microbial RNA and DNA. many of these reviews provide generalized summary illustrations. many of these reviews provide generalized summary illustrations. current evidence does not connect the functioning of aluminum salt gels and polyelectrolyte adjuvants to known TLR pathways. aluminum salts and MF59 act on monocytes, macrophages, or granulocytes to induce cytokines eventually leading to DC activation. iNKT activation by a-GalCer presented on CD1d leads to DC activation. beta glucans activate DC through dectin-1 and ISCOMATRIX directly promote cross-presentation in DCs. phosphate with alhydrogel (aluminum oxyhydroxide) saline formulation resulted in hydrated antigen and re-established soluble-like structure compared to plain Alhydrogel formulation [85]. recent reports provide convincing evidence of internalization [89,91]. lumogallion was used to confirm intracellular location of aluminum oxyhydroxide adjuvants taken up by a monocytic T helper 1 cell line. the clinicalTrials.gov registry database lists 869 clinical trials worldwide that involve vaccine adjuvant. the number and proposed indications for vaccine adjuvants continues to expand as increasing knowledge and information enables rational justification for new combination products or testing a new potential ligand, receptor, or pathway. aluminum salt adjuvants have a long history of use and the most comprehensive safety record of all adjuvants incorporated into human vaccines. aluminum salt adjuvants enhance vaccines to induce high titer IgG. aluminum-based adjuvants can also induce IgE antibodies and stimulate little or no cell-mediated Th1 or cytotoxic CD8 T-cell responses. aluminum-based adjuvants can also induce IgE antibodies. alums used in vaccine formulations commonly refer to the potassium salt of aluminum sulfate. but the salts of other triply charged metal cations may replace or be mixed with aluminum sulfate. inaccurate use of the term \"alum\" confounds efforts to compare adjuvant safety and efficacy. aluminum oxyhydroxide has a very high surface area (500 m2/g) only the outer layer binds antigen. the point of zero charge (PZC) is 11.4, creating a positively charged surface at neutral pH to which antigens bind principally via their negative charges. calcium phosphate Commercial calcium phosphate used in vaccines is a non-stoichiometric hydroxyapatite. study has identified the structure as Ca10x(HPO4)x(OH)2x, where x varies from 0 to 2. aluminum salts are not equivalent in surface chemistry or particulate size. aluminum salts and metal oxide materials investigated immune signaling by in vitro and in vivo studies. the nanometer size range of 150-200 nm is particularly active, which may be due to cell presentation and effects on cellular uptake or membrane perturbation. studies have also demonstrated strong effect by surface chemistry of aluminum salts adjuvants on their immune potenti. the surface density of hydroxyl groups correlate positively with proinflammatory responses. this is in agreement with prior findings regarding the effects of phosphate counter ion on antigen binding and biological function of the commercially available aluminum oxyhydroxide, Alhydrogel. phosphate at 4 mM was shown to convert thermodynamic control of binding of antigen from endothermic to exothermic. aluminum salt adjuvants have a long history of use and the most comprehensive safety record of all adjuvants incorporated into human vaccines. aluminum salt adjuvants have a long history of use and the most comprehensive safety record of all adjuvants incorporated into human vaccines. aluminum salt adjuvants are all gels comprising an oxide, phosphate, or sulfate salt of aluminum. aluminum salt adjuvants enhance vaccines to induce high titer IgG. they induce strong Th2 immune polarization which has been effective in creating protective immunity against extracellular pathogens. aluminum-based adjuvants can also induce IgE antibodies and stimulate little or no cell-mediated Th1 or cytotoxic CD8 T-cell responses. hydroxyphosphate with other adjuvants to create Th1 immunity have been used in Europe for decades. alum \"Alum\" defines a heterogeneous class of hydrated aluminum double salts. alums used in licensed human vaccines commonly refer to the potassium salt of aluminum sulfate. aluminum salt gels are described as poorly crystalline and amorphous with a pseudo-boehmite mineral structure. aluminum oxyhydroxide has a very high surface area (500 m2/g) and only the outer layer binds antigen. aluminum hydroxyphosphate has an amorphous mineral structure, with planar particles of 3 mm average diameter. the specific ratio of surface phosphate to hydroxyl depends on manufacturing conditions. aluminum hydroxyphosphate dissolves more readily than does aluminum oxyhydroxide following injection, releasing about three times as much radiolabeled aluminum. aluminum salts and aluminum salt adjuvants are an original candidate model for aluminum mode of action. evidence supports both models by which aluminum adjuvant is internalized [91] and by which it does not enter the cell but instead delivers admixed antigen for passage across the membrane [90]. aluminum salt gels are partly crystalline and populated in the same range of sizes. the effect can vary from no proinflammatory response, to functional adjuvanticity, to frustrated phagocytosis. studies have also demonstrated strong effect by surface chemistry of aluminum salts adjuvants on their immune potentiating activities. phosphate formulated vaccine showed an estimated 53 months shelf life at 4\u00b0C. the phosphate formulated vaccine showed an estimated 53 months shelf life at 4\u00b0C. a substantial improvement in potency and stability was engineered into a conventional alhydrogel vaccine simply using a defined change in phosphate counter ion concentration. aluminum sulfate forms in situ on mixing with component salts. the terms \"alum\" and \"AL(OH)3\" have been frequently interchanged with aluminum hydroxide. inaccurate use of the term \"alum\" confounds efforts to compare vaccine adjuvant safety and efficacy. aluminum phosphate \"Aluminum phosphate\" used in vaccines is gel made of aluminum hydroxyphosphate. the surface charge is positive at neutral pH in contrast to unmodified aluminum oxyhydroxide. aluminum hydroxyphosphate dissolves more readily than does aluminum oxyhydroxide following injection. studies have established involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome for adjuvant activity by aluminum salts [104,105], and that the role may not be essential. studies have established involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome for adjuvant activity by aluminum salts. crystalline particles are not fully engulfed by macrophages in vitro. they create a \"frustrated phagocytosis\" effect that activates proinflammatory responses. chronic exposure may contribute to the toxicity of fibrous materials such as asbestos. phosphate at 4 mM was shown to convert thermodynamic control of binding of antigen from endothermic to exothermic. this was due to altered binding created via lignd exchange of phosphate for surface hydroxyls. the 4 mM phosphate Alhydrogel formulation increased potency more than 5-fold as compared to the 0.25 mM phosphate concentration of conventional phosphate buffered saline formulations. polyelectrolytes-ionic macromolecules of either synthetic or natural origin-serve as immunostimulants are introduced as mixtures with typical antigens. this effect is increased by orders of magnitude if the antigen is chemically bound to synthetic polyelectrolytes. this effect is increased by orders of magnitude if the antigen is chemically bound to synthetic polyelectrolytes. chitosan Chitin is a long-chain polymer of a N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. it is produced by partial deacetylation of chitin and is more amendable for water-soluble and hydrogel nanoparticulate formulations. it is conceivable that chitin could be a potent innate immune stimulator of macrophages. chitosan formulations are prepared by hydrolysis and are either water-soluble mixed polymers or hydrogel nanoparticulates. chitosan was shown to be mucoadhesive, can promote prolonged retention times following mucosal vaccination, and additionally acts as a permeation enhancer by opening tight junctions. chitosan induced a mixed Th1/Th2 humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. chitosan is superior to Imject Alum (aluminum hydroxide + aluminum magnesium hydroxide) chitosan can synergistically enhance the immunoadjuvant properties of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. alginic acid is a copolymer containing (1-4)-linked -D-mannuronate (M) and its C-5 epimer -L-guluronate (G) residues, covalently linked together in different sequences or blocks. alginic acid is a linear copolymer containing (1-4)-linked -D-mannuronate and its -L-guluronate (G) residues. polyoxidonium polyoxidonium-a water-soluble cationic polymer is a polyelectrolyte. it is a derivative of poly(1,4-ethylenepiperazine), it is synthesized by partial oxidation of the parent polymer with hydrogen peroxide to introduce N-oxide groups. the addition of alginate improved both encapsulation efficiency and immune responses. a dose-dependent increase in the intracellular killing by blood phagocytes was also observed for this polymer. polyoxidonium was also shown to have antioxidant activity at all dose range of 100 to 500 g/mL [130]. 50 million recipients were vaccinated in a clinical study polyoxidonium was also evaluated with live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. authors note that the detected increase in TNF- level and skewing the dominant immune responses from Th1 to Th2 type could not be appreciated as positive effect of polyoxidonium. a potent immunoadjuvant effect of PCPP has been well-documented. it has been well-documented when administered with a variety of bacterial and viral antigens. it has been reported that polyphosphazene adjuvants induced significant increases in antibody responses as early as 2 weeks after immunization for a number of antigen. a single intramuscular dose of PCPP formulated rotavirus VLPs induced rotavirus-specific serum IgG and IgA. a single intramuscular dose of PCPP formulated rotavirus VLPs induced rotavirus-specific serum IgG and IgG titers that were enhanced 5- to 90-fold by the adjuvant [149] polyphosphazene immunoadjuvants are well-defined macromolecules. poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene], PCPP (Fig. 7) is by far the most investigated representative of this class, which has been successfully advanced to the development state. its track record in human clinical trials includes significant improvement in seroconversion and seroprotection rates for a seasonal influenza vaccine [144]. PCPP-antigen sparing-PCPP adjuvanted X:31 influenza formulations injected in mice were as potent as non-adjuvanted counterparts containing 25 times higher dose of the antigen. this important feature has been demonstrated in lethal challenge studies with H5N1 influenza vaccine in ferrets, which is a highly relevant preclinical model. the effect of PCPP was found to be more robust than that of \"alum\" PCPP also induced an innate immune transcriptome in human adult and newborn DCs. authors note that the ability of PCPP to activate neonatal monocyte derived DCs to levels similar to their adult counterpart is particularly noteworthy. phosphazene the IgG isotype profiles of the immune response can vary. PCPP enhances IgG1 antibodies, which are typically associated with Th2-type response. its sister polymers have been shown to also enhance IgG2a [141,151] polyphosphazene nanoparticulates, microneedles, and synergy with other immunoadjuvants provide for their straightforward formulation. polyphosphazenes provide for their straightforward formulation, however conformation-activity and molecular weight-activity relationships may play an important role in biological activity. polyphosphazenes provide an attractive basis for the development of combination adjuvants. polyphosphazene adjuvants are compatible with various intradermal immunization techniques. the concept of fabricating microneedles using PCPP as a construction material stems from the macromolecular nature of this adjuvant. polyphosphazenes enable straightforward production of coated or dissolvable microneedles with excellent skin penetration capabilities. characterization of compound structure and use of relevant naming is of critical importance to comparing effectiveness and safety of vaccine adjuvants. characterization of compound structure and use of relevant naming is of critical importance to comparing the effectiveness and safety of vaccine adjuvants. polymers in the field of vaccine delivery and immunopotentiation are largely explained by their physicochemical properties. they can integrate physical characteristics of vaccine carriers with powerful immunopotentiating properties. chitosan is a mixture of copolymers with varying compositions, random distribution of repeating units, and molecular sizes. nuclear magnetic resonance, size exclusion chromatography, field flow fractionation, capillary electrophoresis, dynamic and static light scattering are among the techniques that can be and should be successfully applied. further development of this important class of immunopotentiators and vaccine delivery vehicles builds on the reliability of their production and characterization methods. adjuvants are devised and compared [96]. this is important for research and development efforts as well as in manufacture and preclinical testing. characterization of compound structure and use of relevant naming is of critical importance to comparing effectiveness and safety of vaccine adjuvants. chitin and chitosan are a mixture of copolymers with varying compositions, random distribution of repeating units, and molecular sizes. chitosan is a mixture of copolymers with varying compositions, random distribution of repeating units, and molecular sizes. important class of immunopotentiators builds on reliability of their production and characterization methods. adjuvants have established value for vaccinology and the vaccines industry. this review has updated just a few aspects of adjuvants and adjuvantation and traced the current state of knowledge back to the origin of adjuvant use and science."}
