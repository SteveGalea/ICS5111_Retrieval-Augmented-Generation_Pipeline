{"summary": "TEXT Porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) causes large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea in pigs and an 80 to 100% fatality rate in suckling piglets (1\u20133) no vaccine or antiviral drug is currently available to keep the spread of PEDV in check. PEDV belongs to the genus of the coronavirus family (7, 8) TGEV S1-CTD recognizes porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) and its S1-NTD recognizes two sugar coreceptors, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) (15\u201318). it is not known whether PEDV recognizes porcine APN from other species or whether it uses sugar coreceptors. to characterize the receptor usage of PEDV, here we identified the two S1 domains of PEDV based on the sequence similarity between PEDV and TGEV S1 subunits. however, expression of the two domains individually gave low yields. instead, we expressed and purified a longer fragment (residues 19 to 638) using the same procedure. a glycan screen array was performed to identify the type(s) of sugar most favored by PEDV S1-NTD-CTD (with a C-terminal Fc tag) using antibodies against its C-terminal Fc tag. the readout was described arbitrarily as relative fluorescence units (RFU) both porcine and human APN serve as efficient receptors for PEDV. TGEV S1-NTD-CTD binds porcine and porcine mucins, both of which contain a mixture of different types of sugar. glycan screen array identified Neu5Ac as the type of sugar most favored by PEDV. TGEV pseudoviruses efficiently entered MDCK cells exogenously expressing porcine APN but not those expressing human APN. these entries could be blocked by anti-APN antibody and mucins. PEDV spike-mediated pseudovirus entry into host cells. PEDV strain Ohio VBS2 was used to infect each of the above-named cell lines at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. the results showed that PEDV efficiently infects cells from pig, human, monkey, and bat. PEDV recognizes porcine APN and infects pig cells. TGEV also recognizes porcine APN and Neu5Ac. PEDV and TGEV are evolutionarily closely related. neither receptor recognition nor other host cellular factors pose a hurdle. material Supplemental material supp_89_11_6121__index.html (830B, html)."}
