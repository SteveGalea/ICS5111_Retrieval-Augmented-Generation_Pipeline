{"summary": "qRT-PCR and viral metagenomic analysis of extraction efficiency of four commonly used Qiagen extraction kits. sample contained an adenovirus (ADV), influenza virus A (Flu A), human parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), human coronavirus OC43 (OC43) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) the most effective rate of NGS data was observed with the RPMK. the RPMK was most applicable for the metagenomic analysis of viral RNA. the results highlighted the importance of nucleic acid extraction kit selection. the choice of extraction method for a given viral pathogen needs to be carefully considered."}{"summary": "qRT-PCR and viral metagenomic analysis of extraction efficiency of four commonly used Qiagen extraction kits. sample contained an adenovirus (ADV), influenza virus A (Flu A), human parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), human coronavirus OC43 (OC43) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) the most effective rate of NGS data was observed with the RPMK. the RPMK was most applicable for the metagenomic analysis of viral RNA. the results highlighted the importance of nucleic acid extraction kit selection. the choice of extraction method for a given viral pathogen needs to be carefully considered."}
