{"summary": "proximal socio-ecological factors mediate the activation, duration, and intensity of immune responses. an animal\u2019s sex, diet, sociality, life-history stage, and pathogen pressure can influence its immune function. reduced parasitic helminth exposure has been correlated with increased prevalence of allergy and autoimmune disease in some human populations. spotted hyenas are known to harbor an abundance of parasitic worms of several genera. in the wild, spotted hyenas live in large social groups, which increases the probability of acquiring socially transmitted pathogens. high pathogen exposure rates coupled with low mortality rates from infectious disease suggest that immune function may be particularly robust in wild spotted hyenas. immune defense component model was modified from Schmid-Hemp and Ebert [28] to compare immune defenses in wild and captive hyenas along two continua: 1) constitutive to induced defenses, and 2) non-specific to specific defenses. specific defenses are most effective upon repeated exposure to the same pathogen, because they are maintained after initial infection. specific antibodies produced by B-2 cells are primarily of the IgG isotype in non-mucosal regions. nAbs are primarily of the IgG isotype, but can also be of the IgG and IgA isotypes. ANA is a subset of autoantibodies that bind to intracellular self-antigens. gG (aIgG) and natural IgM (aIgM) bind nuclear antigens, natural IgG (nIgG) and natural IgM (nIgM) against keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and complement-mediated bacterial killing capacity (BKC) of serum. hyenas were born and housed at the field station for Behavioral Research at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) the captive hyenas are fed only meat and standard carnivore chow. the wild hyenas feed on fresh ungulate carcasses and rotting carrion. the captive hyenas exhibit most of the same behaviors as wild hyenas. yenas were immobilized with blow dart-delivered intramuscular injections of ketamine (4\u20136 mg/kg) and xylazine (1 mg/kg) blood was drawn from the jugular vein and serum was aliquoted. serum was frozen at -80\u00b0C until use. the plates were washed three times with TBST before adding 100 l of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-IgG detection antibodies to the plates at concentrations of 0.2 g/ml and 0.25 g/ml. non-specific binding was then blocked 1% BSA in TBS. nAbs were quantified using the same protocol as above. nAbs were quantified using the same protocol as above. the pooled sera again underwent 12 doubling dilutions. Escherichia coli (ATCC# 8739) was chosen because it has been used as a standard bacterial strain in several other studies of bactericidal capacity [52] Proteus mirabilis (ATCC# 35659) was chosen because, like E. coli, it is a gram negative bacterium that is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of many animals. the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the negative log2 of the lowest dilution that exhibited over 90 percent inhibition compared to the mean of the control wells. the plates were visually inspected to ensure that there was no bacterial growth at the calculated MIC. age and sex are known to affect aspects of immune function in some species. the full models included captivity status, sex, and age as input variables. all subset models were ranked according to Akaike\u2019s information criteria. the top models, those with AICc 2, were then averaged using the 'MuMIn' package in R. one wild hyena was excluded from the study prior to data analysis. it contained a large lipid globule and could not be filtered in a manner consistent with the other serum samples. we ran out of sera from two wild hyenas prior to performing the anti-ANA assay. the captive hyenas used in our study have been in captivity for less than four generations. no disease outbreaks have ever occurred in the captive population. many virulent viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens have been documented in wild spotted hyenas in east africa. wild spotted hyenas were immobilized with blow dart-delivered intramuscular injections of ketamine (4\u20136 mg/kg) and xylazine (1 mg/kg) wild hyenas often feed on carcasses from which lions, jackals, and vultures have also fed. total IgG and IgM total IgG and IgM were quantified using sandwich ELISAs. first, capture antibodies were diluted into coating buffer at 10 g/ml. plates were washed twice with TBST and non-specific binding was then blocked 1% BSA in TBS. the plates were incubated 60 minutes and washed four times. the color change reaction was stopped using 0.2 M H2SO4. nAbs were quantified using the same protocol as above. sera were diluted 1:1,600 and 1:400 for IgG and IgM. we again used HRP-conjugated anti-IgG or anti-IgM detection antibodies added to the plates at concentrations of 0.2 g/ml and 0.25 g/ml. E. coli or P. mirabilis were inoculated into MHBII and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C while shaking at 120 rpm. bacterial cell concentration was adjusted to approximately 108 CFU/ml by diluting bacteria in sterile PBS until optical density at 600 nm matched the corresponding turbidity of the McFarland turbidity standard. we used version 3.0.3 of the software package R [47] to create linear regression models to assess the effects of captivity on immune function in spotted hyenas. the full models included captivity status, sex, and age as input variables, and all two-way interactions between input variables. the input variable age was normalized using a square root transformation. all continuous response and predictor variables were then centered and standardized by subtracting the mean. standardization allows for more interpretable comparisons of effect sizes by measuring all effects on a common scale. hyenas had significantly higher serum concentrations of total IgG than captive hyenas. captivity status was the only input variable in this model. wild hyenas had significantly more total IgM than captive hyenas. anti-KLH natural IgG (A) is significantly higher in wild hyenas (n = 14) than in captive hyenas (n = 11), but there is no difference in anti-KLH natural IgM (B) between wild (n = 14) captive (n = 11) hyenas. anti-nuclear IgG (A) and anti-nuclear IgM (B) are significantly higher in wild hyenas (n = 14 for IgG; n = 12 for IgM) than in captive hyenas (n = 15 for IgG and IgM) females are indicated by open circles and males by filled circles. r d.f P total IgM 0.344 27.000 0.068 nAb IgG 0.421 23.000 0.036 total IgG nAb IgM -0.520 23.000 0.805 ANA IgG 0.550 27.000 0.002 ANA IgM 0.389 25.000 0.045 BKC -0.001 27.000 0.995 nAb IgG 0.217 23.000 0.298 nAb IgM 0.4 total IgG (A) and total IgM (B) are significantly higher in wild hyenas (n = 14) than in captive hyenas (n = 15). females are indicated by open circles and males by filled circles. anti-KLH natural IgG (A) is significantly higher in wild hyenas (n = 14) than in captive hyenas (n = 11), but there is no difference in anti-KLH natural IgM (B) between wild (n = 14) captive (n = 11) hyenas. we assessed BKC for 15 captive and 14 wild hyenas. neither captivity status (p = 0.336) nor sex (p = 0.433) significantly affected BKC. 0.045 BKC -0.001 27.000 0.995 nAb IgG 0.217 23.000 0.298 nAb IgM 0.464 23.000 0.019 total IgM ANA IgG 0.134 27.000 0.488 ANA IgM 0.734 25.000 0.001 BKC 0.113 27.000 0.558 nAb IgM 0.131 23.000 0.533 nAb IgG ANA IgG 0.332 23.000 0. devalapalli, Lesher, et al. [15] reported significantly greater concentrations of total IgM in wild-caught rats than in laboratory rat strains. this suggests that over the long-term nIgM is the least inducible antibody type described in Fig 1. nAbs, particularly natural autoantibodies, are important for self-tolerance. in humans, autoimmune diseases are more common in women than men. high levels of aIgG are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and multiple sclerosis. both aIgG and aIgM levels are significantly higher in wild hyenas than in captive hyenas. aAbs are critical for efficient clearance of virally-infected apoptotic and necrotic cells. further research is needed to differentiate between high- and low-affinity ANAs in hyenas. wild hyenas from the Masai Mara in Kenya had significantly higher serum antibody concentrations than hyenas born and raised in a captive facility. however, we would need serum samples collected at multiple time points from the same individuals to rule out this hypothesis altogether. the groundwork for this type of comparative research is already in place in the form of zoos and wildlife research studies. results of AICc based multimodel weighted-averages for natural anti-KLH IgG and IgM. results of AICc based multimodel weighted-averages for anti-ANA IgG and IgM."}
