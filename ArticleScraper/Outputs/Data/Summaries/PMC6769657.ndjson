{"summary": "secretory proteins are synthesized on ER bound ribosomes and attain native conformation thanks to a plethora of specific ER folding factors and enzymes. only proteins that achieve their native structure pass the first step of protein quality control (QC) localized at the ER level. correctly folded proteins can pass the first step of QC located in the endoplasmic reticulum (proximal QC) and have access to transport vesicles at the ER exit sites. a second step of QC ensures that only correctly assembled proteins can proceed along the secretory pathway. assembly intermediates are retrieved to the ER for another chance of being incorporated into a polymer. PERK activation is part of a specific stress response system, the unfolded protein response (UPR) that protects the ER folding environment by detecting and responding to the presence of misfolded proteins in its lumen. ER holds a vast repertoire of ER-resident chaperones and folding factors that direct and monitor each error-prone step in protein biosynthesis. the event of mannose trimming to degradation by ER mannosidase I likely occurs in specific sub-compartments of the ER, recently named quality control vesicles (QCVs) [20] or in the cisGolgi region [21], suggesting some substrates of ERAD need to reach the Golgi before being degraded. some proteins move forward following the so called bulk flow. proteins can be incorporated into vesicles departing from the ER simply by bulk flow. this interaction is mediated by specific amino acids in their cytosolic tail. some of them require specific adaptors, as it is case of AMPA receptors and TGF. transmembrane proteins bind cargoes in the ER thanks to their luminal domain and interact with their cytosolic tail with COPII components. the interaction with the cargoes is generally mediated by glycan recognition, as all those transporters act as lectins. the assembly of COPII vesicles is started by the activity of sec12. the vesicle is completed with the addition of Sec13/Sec24 heterodimer. sec16, another molecule part of the COPII coat, can be activated by ERK2. the activation of a tyrosine kinase present at the ERES (LTK) can phosphorylate Sec12, thus activating Sar1 and starting the assembly of the COPII coat [52] the complexity of the protein maturation steps implies the existence of several machineries sequentially distributed along the secretory pathway. the complexity of the protein maturation steps implies the existence of several machineries sequentially distributed along the secretory pathway. folding in the ER is slow and coupled to covalent disulfide formation, transmembrane insertion, N-glycosylation. folding in the ER is coupled to covalent disulfide formation, transmembrane insertion, and n-glycosylation. the ER holds a vast repertoire of ER-resident chaperones and folding factors that direct and monitor each error-prone step in protein biosynthesis. many secretory proteins undergo asparagine-linked glycosylation on specific sites (Asn/X/Ser-Thr) the outer glucose units are co-translationally trimmed by glucosidases I and II. idase I occurs in specific sub-compartments of the ER, recently named quality control vesicles (QCVs) [20] or in the cisGolgi region [21], suggesting some substrates of ERAD need to reach the Golgi before being degraded. ubiquitinated proteins are then retro-translocated from the ER to the cytosol and delivered to the 26S proteasome for degradation. proteins can be incorporated into vesicles departing from the ER simply by bulk flow or can be actively concentrated at the ERES by cargo receptors (active transport) this interaction is mediated by specific amino acids in their cytosolic tail, which allows their specific recognition by the COPII components. the COPII coat is a multimeric protein assembly whose formation is necessary for the secretion of the majority of proteins in eukaryotic cells. the assembly is initiated by the transmembrane protein Sec12, which activates the small GTPase Sar1. sec16 acts as a scaffold for COPII assembly. a chronic increase in cargo load in the secretory pathway often causes ER stress. a chronic rise in cargo load induces increased size and numbers of ERES. the nature of the cargo can also regulate and modify the generation of COPII vesicles. ERK2 which phosphorylates Sec16 stimulates COPII vesicles biogenesis. the activation of a tyrosine kinase present at the ERES (LTK) can phosphorylate Sec12. thus activating Sar1 and starting the assembly of the COPII coat. CF is the most common lethal monogenic autosomal recessive disease among the Caucasian population. it is caused by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) glycoprotein, which normally functions as a chloride/bicarbonate channel at the apical membrane of epithelia [53,54,55]. CFTR belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. nascent F508-CFTR is initially recognized by the Hsp70 machinery. a trafficking checkpoint acts at the levels of recognition of the four three-residue arginine-framed tripeptides of CFTR, which function as an ER retention motif. CFTR modulators include potentiators that promote channel activity, correctors (VX-809) that promote channel activity, and readthrough agents that restore full-length CFTR by suppression of premature termination codons. progress has been made toward accomplishing the goal of effective CFTR modulator therapy. trypsin 1-Antitrypsin (1AT) is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. the primary role of 1AT is to inhibit the proteolytic enzyme elastase secreted by activated neutrophils. 1AT maintains the structural integrity of lung elastin [73,74] the accumulation of mutated 1AT in the ER of hepatocytes is a risk factor for the development of childhood liver disease (gain-of-toxic function phenotype) the most frequent disease-associated mutations include a point mutation in the 1AT gene, which is named the ATZ variant. this causes ER stress, low secretion of 1AT, and eventually end-stage pathology requiring liver transplantation. autophagy-enhancing drugs promote ATZ clearance and attenuate hepatic fibrosis. a peculiar characteristic of the cellular response to the ER accumulation of ATZ is the lack of significant activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). different genetic diseases originate from mutation (loss of sense or missense) in COPII components. mutations in one of the COPII components should be incompatible with life or at least should cause very severe diseases with effects spread all over the body. the disease is caused by a missense substitution (F382L) in Sec23A. Especially osteoblasts, which have very low levels of the Sec23 B isoform [100] suffer from the lack of activity of this protein. KO mice for Sec23B die very soon after birth because of degeneration of professional secretory tissues. ERGIC-53 is a transmembrane protein of about 53 kDa shuttling from the ER to the cis-Golgi. it presents a luminal lectin domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytosolic domain ending with the sequence KKFF. the double lysine is a specific sequence needed for interaction with sec24 for ER export. Factor V and Factor VIII are bulky proteins characterized by a huge number of N-glycosylations. the lack of ERGIC-53 slows down the velocity of exit from the ER. the most common symptoms are epistaxis, menorrhagia and excessive bleeding during or after trauma. mutation result in inability of ERGIC-53 to interact with FV and FVIII. lysosomal enzymes cathepsin C and Z have been described as substrates of ERGIC-53. lysosomal enzymes cathepsin C and Z have been described as substrates. 1AT patients with hepatic disease have mutations in ERGIC-53 or MCFD2. a common substrate of the ERGIC-53/MCFD2 pair is the IgM heavy chain. this decreases both IgM polymerization efficiency and intracellular accumulation of a mutant IgM heavy chain lacking the first constant domain. different genetic diseases originate from mutation (loss of sense or missense) in COPII components. mutations in one of the COPII components should be incompatible with life or at least should cause very severe diseases with effects spread all over the body. the disease is caused by a missense substitution (F382L) in Sec23A.

ERGIC-53 presents a luminal lectin domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytosolic domain ending with the sequence KKFF. the double lysine at the C-terminus is a specific sequence needed for interaction with Sec24 for ER export. the formation of dimeric structures is not required for ERGIC-53 exiting from the ER. Combined Deficiency of Factor 5 and Factor 8 (F5F8D) is an autosomal recessive mild coagulation disorder characterized by very low levels in the blood of Factor V and Factor VIII. most common symptoms are epistaxis, menorrhagia, and excessive bleeding during or after trauma. lysosomal enzymes cathepsin C and Z have been described as substrates of ERGIC-53 [108,121], as localization in the lysosomes is reduced in the absence of the lectin or when mutants unable to exit the ER are expressed. a physical interaction between ERGIC-53 and these lysosomal enzymes has been demonstrated. hepatic disease, have mutations in ERGIC-53 or MCFD2. downregulation decreases both IgM polymerization efficiency [126] and the intracellular accumulation of a mutant IgM heavy chain lacking the first constant domain [127]. RGIC-53 presents a luminal lectin domain, a transmembrane region, and a short cytosolic domain ending with the sequence KKFF. the double lysine at the C-terminus is a specific sequence needed for interaction with Sec24 for ER export. the double lysine instead are needed for interaction with COPI. Factor V and Factor VIII are bulky proteins characterized by a huge number of N-glycosylations. most common symptoms are epistaxis, menorrhagia, and excessive bleeding during or after trauma. lack of ERGIC-53 slows exit from the ER (and hence secretion) lysosomal enzymes cathepsin C and Z have been described as substrates of ERGIC-53 [108,121], as localization in the lysosomes is reduced in the absence of the lectin or when mutants unable to exit the ER are expressed. a physical interaction between ERGIC-53 and these lysosomal enzymes has been demonstrated [122]. 1AT patients with hepatic disease have mutations in ERGIC-53 or MCFD2. a common substrate of the ERGIC-53/MCFD2 pair is the IgM heavy chain. this decreases both IgM polymerization efficiency and intracellular accumulation. only folded proteins are given the permit to leave the ER and continue their journey along the secretory pathway. misfolded proteins must be stopped and redirected to other destinations not to accumulate in the ER."}
