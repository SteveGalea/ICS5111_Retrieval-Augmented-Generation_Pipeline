{"summary": "a novel reporter virus-based assay was developed for measuring neutralization and ADE activity. a stable Renilla luciferase reporter DENV (Luc-DENV) can produce robust luciferase signals in BHK-21 and K562 cells. a typical positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus encodes three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) the genome is about 11 kb in length and encodes three structural proteins (C, prM and E) Luc-DENV was developed by engineering the Renilla luciferase gene into the capsid-coding region by reverse genetic technology [9] Luc-DENV replicates efficiently in both mammalian and mosquito cells with high stability. the results showed that all three mAbs significantly reduced the numbers of plaques in a dose-dependent manner. a linear correlation (R2 > 0.95) was demonstrated between PFU and RLU assay. the linear equation between RLU and PFU is calculated as RLU = 86.74 PFU + 2256 (Figure 1D). our results supported the application of Luc-based assay for neutralization antibodies against DENV. the results obtained with 2A10G6 were plotted on a scatter graph. as expected, the enhancing antibody titer determined by RLU was linear correlated to PFU. the linear equation between RLU and PFU obtained was RLU = 3.657PFU + 1152. the enhancing activity of #175 is higher than that of #52. no enhancement was observed for #NS as expected. no enhancement was observed for #NS as expected. LRNT50 was calculated to 80 and 10-fold dilution separately. no neutralizing activity can be observed in serum #37-30 at detected dilutions. luciferase activity was measured in lysed K562 cells. the PRNT50 of 4G2, 2B8 and 2A10G6 was 8.55, 0.45 and 0.35 g/mL. LRNT50 of three mAbs calculated from a fitting curve were 6.80, 0.86 and 0.26 g/mL, respectively. an unrelated mAb against EV71 showed no neutralization for both plaque and Luc-based assay. the results showed that the viral yield was markedly enhanced in the presence of 2A10G6 at dilutions ranging from 100 g/mL to 0.01 g/mL. the peak enhancing was 8.19-fold at a concentration of 1.00 g/mL (Figure 2A, right ordinate), of the similar magnitude with plaque based assay. sera from Rhesus Monkeys (#175, #052) immunized with a live attenuated DENV-2 showed strong neutralizing activity. negative control from healthy monkey showed no neutralizing activity as expected. three convalescent sera from DF patients (#19-20, #37-20, #37-30) were validated with the newly developed assay in K562 cells. all three samples were able to enhance DENV infection at dilutions from 2 10-2 to10-4 (#19-20), 10-2 to10-5 (#37-20), and 10-1 to10-4 (#37-30), respectively. Pseudo infectious deNV reporter virus particles (RVP) carrying green fluorescent protein reporter were also used to measure neutralization antibodies with rapidity, stability and reproducibility. luciferase reporter virus replicates almost the same as wild type virus, representing a more advanced tool. ADE infection of DENV has been well demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. different methods based on infection rate, progeny viral yield and number of infectious centers have been reported to measure the ADE activity. Luc-DENV replicates well in multiple cells including BHK-21, K562, Vero and THP-1 and A549 cells. new assay method is easy to adapt for a high-throughput manner. it is of critical importance for large-scale clinical samples assays. new assay method is rapid, low-cost, and time-saving. control serum negative for DENV (#NC) were from Guangzhou No.8 People\u2019s Hospital, Guangzhou, China. all samples were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min before assay. data was collected using a continuous-read luminometer (GLOMAX 96 Microplate Luminometer, Promega) integrated over 10 seconds with a 2 second delay. each sample was assay in triplicate. antibody dilution resulting in 50% reduction of RLU value referred to negative control was defined as LRNT50. human erythroleukemic K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone) and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2. reporter Luc-DENV has been previously described. DMEM served as negative control, and each sample was assayed in triplicate. Plaques were counted and PRNT50 is defined as the antibody dilution referred to negative control. Luc-based enhancement assay was operated similar with plaque-based enhancement assay as above described in 12-well plates. serial dilutions of antibodies mixed with Luc-DENV were incubated for 72 hours on K562 cells. cell lysates were then subjected to luciferase activities assay as described above. cells were infected with virus at MOI of 0.5. each data point represents the mean obtained in three separate assays with SDs (indicated by bars)"}
