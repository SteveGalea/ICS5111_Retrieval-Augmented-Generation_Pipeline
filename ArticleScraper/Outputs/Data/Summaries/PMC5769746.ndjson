{"summary": "long RNA molecules control many aspects of gene expression, such as mRNAs, regulatory RNAs, viral genomes, components of the machinery for translation, RNA processing, and many other processes. this limitation is limited by the low processivity of the reverse transcriptase enzymes (RTs) that are used to copy RNA molecules into DNA products, or cDNAs. conventional RTs have limited utility on highly structured or post-transcriptionally modified RNA. the most well-studied and commonly used RTs derive from retroviruses. RTs can be classified into several families based on sequence and structural homology. the C-terminal region of maturase RTs, known as the \u201cX domain,\u201d is analogous to a polymerase thumb. each maturase RT forms a specific complex with its parent intron RNA, resulting in a stable RNP complex that carries out reverse-transcription during the course of retrotransposition. the PDB ID for E.r. maturase RT domain is 5HHL. the model for X domain (thumb) in E.r. maturase was created as a threading model by I-TASSER. a group II intron maturase RT with improved physical properties. we solved their structures to exceptionally high resolution (1.2 and 2.1) this provided first-in-class structures of the distinct family of RT enzymes found in group II introns and non-LTR retrotransposons. cDNA synthesis from the genome of hepatitis c virus (HCV) is a highly structured viral genome. the genome is very long (9.6 kb, Fig. 2A) and is among the most highly structured RNA genomes known. cDNAs were extended efficiently and without prevalent stops. the yield of full-length radiolabeled product was 90% for all fragments 8000 nt in length. the yield of full-length radiolabeled product was 90%. RTs have been compared with SSII (Mohr et al. 2013) and retroelement RTs have been compared with AMV (avian myeoloblastosis virus) RT (Bibillo and Eickbush 2002) there have been no studies comparing relative performance of RTs on long templates with direct analysis of first-strand cDNAs. RT reactions for SSIV and TGIRT were performed with optimal temperature. lengths of cDNA products under multiple-cycle conditions do not reflect the continuous extension activity of an individual RT molecule along RNA template (processivity) processivity is described as the probability that a polymerase will continue to copy the template rather than falling off. RT reactions for SSIV and TGIRT were performed under the optimal temperature and buffer condition. cDNA products are not observed when trap is preincubated with the RT/template complex (rather than upon initiation of reaction with dNTPs) SSIV can generate a small amount of full-length product under single-turnover conditions. but primarily produces shorter fragments (Fig. 4A,B). SSIV has a higher intrinsic processivity than either SSIV or TGIRT. 99% of all enzymes that initiated reverse-transcription reached the end of the template. from this value, one can estimate that the absolute processivity on a per nucleotide basis is 99.998%. this value is very high, suggesting that the MarathonRT can be used to copy genomes as large as that of a coronavirus (30,000) in a single pass. the structure of the RT domain (finger and palm) was determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB ID: 5HHL) the structure of thumb subdomain was created as a threaded model using the coordinates for LtrA (PDB ID: 5G2Y) a green arrow indicates the entry site for RNA template. ases, the -hairpin within the finger subdomain, enclose the RT active site, and prevent dissociation of the RNA template. a loop structure that is unique to this RT family (the -loop) is located in the finger subdomain of the MarathonRT. this loop is proximal to the -hairpin and it fully encloses the active site. atsuura et al. 1997; Wank et al. 1999; Qu et al. 2016; Zhao and Pyle 2016. some of these motifs are expected to detract from its ability to function as an RT, suggesting that the MarathonRT could be engineered to function more optimally as a tool enzyme. mut1, mut2, and mut3 constructs were shown as sticks. we measured primer incorporation efficiency using RepA D1 as template. mut3 mutants were shown as sticks. the mut1 construct displays a 2.03(0.2)-fold increase in primer incorporation efficiency relative to the wild-type enzyme. mut1 + mut2 construct has a 2.67(0.25)-fold increase in productive primer binding relative to the wild-type enzyme. however, even after incorporating six alanine mutations on positively charged surface, the mut1 + mut2 construct is still only able to utilize 19% 3% of RepA D1 template. the calculated percentage of misincorporation has historically been estimated in various ways. in the pre-NGS era, the lacZ mutation selection assay was the most widely used method. this approach underestimates the misincorporation frequency since the genetic code is degenerate/redundant. results suggest that the MarathonRT is as accurate as other high-fidelity reverse transcriptases such as SSIV and TGIRT. only errors that are consistent in all sequencing reads that share the same product barcode are considered as RT errors (red stars) total nucleotides (row 6) is calculated by multiplying nucleotide/product (row 5) with the number of unique products (row 4), which is the total number of nucleotides analyzed. substitution frequency (row 7) was calculated by dividing the number of total nucleotides (row 6) by the number of mutated nucleotides. cDNA synthesis from the genome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is examined by the marathonRT. the genome is very long (9.6 kb, Fig. 2A) and is among the most highly structured RNA genomes known. this one RNA molecule contains long stem\u2013loops, pseudoknots, and stable tertiary structures. representative denaturing alkaline agarose electrophoresis gel shows products of MarathonRT from multi-turnover RT reactions using full-length HCV genome as template. the ratio of signal intensity from full-length product divided by total products for each primer is indicated under each gel lane. MV (avian myeoloblastosis virus) RT (Bibillo and Eickbush 2002), there have been no studies comparing the relative performance of RTs on long templates with direct analysis of first-strand cDNAs. results show that, using multiple-cycle conditions (RT enzyme excess), the MarathonRT performs exceptionally well compared with other high-performance RTs in copying a 5 kb viral RNA template. RT reactions for SSIV and TGIRT were performed with optimal temperature (55\u00b0C for SSIV and 60\u00b0C for TGIRT) and standard buffer conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol. the lengths of cDNA products under multiple-cycle conditions do not reflect the continuous extension activity of an individual RT molecule along RNA template (processivity) RT reactions for SSIV and TGIRT were performed under the optimal temperature and buffer condition. cDNA products are not observed when trap is preincubated with the RT/template complex. SSIV can generate a small amount of full-length product under single-turnover conditions. however, it primarily produces shorter fragments (Fig. 4A,B) thus, MarathonRT has a higher intrinsic processivity than either SSIV or TGIRT. the results suggest that SSIV may have weak affinity for the trap. the probability that the RT will extend one nucleotide rather than dissociate is 99.998%. this value is very high, suggesting that the MarathonRT can be used to copy genomes as large as that of a coronavirus (30,000) in a single pass. the measured processivity of SSIV is only 19 1 nt on the D3 template. -loop is in an open conformation in the cryo-EM structure of LtrA\u2013LtrB intron complex (PDB ID: 5G2Y) disassociation from the template is the major factor in reducing processivity of a polymerase. extending the -hairpin by 15 amino acids improved RT processivity. the thumb domain plays a key role in mediating polymerase processivity. a loop structure that is unique to this RT family (the -loop) is located in the finger subdomain of the MarathonRT. tron, are expected to detract from its ability to function as an RT. this suggests that the MarathonRT could be engineered to function more optimally as a tool enzyme. in contrast, SSIV extends 98.6% 1% of provided primer (Fig. 6B) primer incorporation efficiency is the ratio of all extension products relative to the total amount of primer in the reaction. the crystal structure of the E.r. RT domain (Zhao and Pyle 2016), and the cryo-EM structure of a related group II intron-maturase complex from L.l. (Qu et al. 2016) revealed a highly positively charged region that is located on the protein surface opposite the RT active site. mut2 construct has almost no change (1.09[0.09]-fold increase). mut1 + mut2 construct has a 2.67(0.25)-fold increase in primer binding relative to the wild-type enzyme. this gradual increase in primer incorporation efficiency by decreasing the positive charge on the intron binding surface suggests that template and/or maturase depletion is likely to play a role in the primer incorporation problem. high-throughput sequencing has been used to monitor fidelity by directly counting the mutational frequencies in the sequencing reads. this method is sensitive to PCR bias, as it cannot discriminate RT error from subsequent PCR amplification or base-call errors derived from the sequencing platform. the substitutional mutational frequency determined from these unique RT products is 9.9 105 for MarathonRT, 1.8 104 for SSIV and 1.3 104 for TGIRT. this result suggests that the MarathonRT is as accurate as other high-fidelity reverse transcriptases such as SSIV and TGIRT. only errors that are consistent in all sequencing reads that share the same product barcode are considered as RT errors (red stars) total nucleotides (row 6) is calculated by multiplying nucleotide/product (row 5) with the number of unique products (row 4), which is the total number of nucleotides analyzed. substitution frequency (row 7) was calculated by dividing the number of total nucleotides (row 6) by the number of mutated nucleotides. the reverse transcriptase within the MarathonRT enzyme displays exceptionally high processivity. it can synthesize an entire HCV viral genome (9.5 kb cDNA) with few detectable stops. such extreme RT processivity opens the door to new RNA sequencing methods. long-read direct RNA sequencing techniques would be particularly useful for single-cell RNA-seq experiments in which the RNA species are heterogeneous. the MarathonRT contains a loop motif (the -loop) that encloses the RT active site and prevents RNA template dissociation. interactions with intron domain 4 (D4) may regulate RT activity of maturase proteins. in solution, the -loop is likely to be flexible, which would accommodate the association of RNA template. in general, the MarathonRT surpasses the performance of the related RT enzyme. the marathonRT is an excellent choice for an RT enzyme. if one needs to conduct the RT reaction at high temperatures (>60\u00b0C) it should be possible to optimize this enzyme and improve its properties. the error rate is typical of high performance RT enzymes. a single RNA template and a single-molecule barcoding strategy were used. similar experiments would provide a more complete understanding of the confidence intervals in the error rate. le mutant consisting of R58A, K59A, K61A, and K163A. construct mut2 contains all six points mutations. residues 182\u2013192 have been replaced with two glycines. the proteins were passed over a superdex S200 Increase column (10/300 GL, GE Healthcare), and the peak fraction was pooled, concentrated to 2\u201320 mg/mL, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. each RT primer was 5\u2032 end labeled with 32P by T4 PNK. first-strand cDNA products synthesized from the HCV genome were resolved on a 0.8% (w/v) alkaline agarose gel (SeakKem LE) gels were run in 1 alkaline gel running buffer at room temperature for 5 h at 2 V/cm. to avoid cracking, gel was dried at 80\u00b0C for 1 h under vacuum. then it was allowed to slowly cool to room temperature for another 1 h. RNA templates were first diluted to 100 nM (10 stock) in an RNA storage buffer containing 10 mM K-MES (pH 6.0) and 1 mM EDTA. mixture was heated to 95\u00b0C for 1 min, and then snap cooled on ice for 10 min. the intensity profile for each gel lane was extracted using imageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare) the corresponding pixel position for each gel lane was calculated by using a rolling-ball algorithm with 100 m radius. RT reactions were conducted in 20 L final volumes using 0.2 pmol RNA template (1.2 1011 molecules) annealed to 0.2 pmol RT primer, which is much less than the number of molecules encoded by combined UMIs from both primers. ds-cDNAs were then purified on 90 L AMPure XP beads. the ds-cDNAs were then eluted in 30 L H2O. the ds-cDNAs were then adjusted to the same concentration (5 1015 M) in different groups. the PCR program involved denaturing at 98\u00b0C for 5 min, anneal at 64\u00b0C for 30 sec, and extend at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. the specificity of PCR reactions was confirmed using an agarose gel stained with PicoGreen (Invitrogen) there were 2,012,287, 3,349,439, and 4,069,588 reads sequenced in total for marathonRT, SSIV, and TGIRT. 147,303 (MarathonRT), 133,750 (SSIV), and 146,757 (TGIRT) unique product barcodes. the low-quality bases at the ends were then trimmed, resulting in only 260 nucleotides for MarathonRT and 72 nucleotides for the codon-optimized cDNA was synthesized by Thermo Fisher. all mutant constructs were generated using a Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB) bound protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient that reaches 50% high salt buffer after 50 mL elution (starting from 8% high salt) for the mut1 + mut2 construct, the supernatant was loaded on the column after clarifying the SUMO tag-cleavage reaction. for all constructs, the proteins were passed over a Superdex S200 Increase column (10/300 GL, GE Healthcare), and the peak fraction was pooled, concentrated first-strand cDNA products synthesized from the HCV genome were resolved on a 0.8% (w/v) alkaline agarose gel (SeakKem LE) gels were run in 1 alkaline gel running buffer at room temperature for 5 h at 2 V/cm. the size ladder was a 1 kb double-stranded (ds) DNA ladder. RT primers were 5\u2032 end labeled with 32P by T4 PNK. before use, RNA templates were first diluted to 100 nM (10 stock) in an RNA storage buffer containing 10 mM K-MES (pH 6.0) and 1 mM EDTA. annealed primer\u2013template was incubated with 400 nM RT enzymes (10 stock) in reaction buffer as follows. the RT reaction was performed for 5 min at 42\u00b0C for MarathonRT, 55\u00b0C for SSIV, and 60\u00b0C for TGIRT. first-strand cDNA products were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. a similar procedure was followed except that trap (10 mM RepA D1 annealed to a primer at position 387 [Supplemental Table 1] was included in the preincubation step for annealed template\u2013primer and RT 0.965% of primer extension events did not go to completion because of polymerase dissociation. in this case, a template of 32,240 nt is required to have 50% disassociation event. however, given the limitations on resolution of the gel at position 616 nt, the calculated processivity is slightly overestimated. 0.2 pmol RNA template (1.2 1011 molecules) annealed to 0.2 pmol RT primer. reaction time was 1 h. reaction mixture was then combined with 0.2 pmol second-strand synthesis primer. the PCR products were then purified with 45 L AMPure XP beads (Beckman) and eluted in 15 L H2O. after this cleaning step, 1 L of each PCR product was further amplified in PCR reactions (25 L total volume) for 13 more PCR cycles using the Illumina universal primer and Illumina index primers (NEBNext) errors were recorded only when the same substitutional mutation or insertion\u2013deletions were observed in all reads that belong to the same unique product group. only RT products with UMIs that appear no less than three times were used in estimating substitutional frequency. otides sequenced in our experiment are sufficient to estimate the substitutional frequency. in our data, we did not observe insertion-deletion events."}
