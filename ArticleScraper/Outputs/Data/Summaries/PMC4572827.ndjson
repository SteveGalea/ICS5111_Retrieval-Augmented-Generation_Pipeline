{"summary": "the presence of even a single, asymptomatic, persistently infected calf has demonstrable effects on growth performance and the need for antibiotic treatment. bovine viral diarrhea viruses are members of the Flaviviridae family consisting of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (3). these viruses are able to affect both innate and adaptive immune cells, including macrophages, granulocytes, antigen-presenting myeloid cells, CD4+ experimental BVDV-2 infection would delay and reduce the humoral response to ovalbumin in calves. experimental BVDV-2 infection would increase co-infection risk and BRD incidence. biosecurity measures including physical separation of animals and restrictions on movement of staff and materials between pens were also approved. 8 of the calves received an ovalbumin inoculation (OVA+) and 8 were sham-treated (OVA) each group consisted of 8 animals: BVDV+/OVA+, BVDV+/OVA, BVDV/OVA+ and BVDV/OVA. a final concentration of 107.2 Tissue Culture Infective Dose 50% (TCID50) per 4 mL inoculum received DMEM only. the ovalbumin-challenged calves were inoculated intramuscularly on D3 and D15 with 2 mg ovalbumin solubilized in sterile water. a serial dilution of RNA extracted from BVDV-infected cell culture supernatant served as an external reference for absolute quantification. the qRT-PCR results are given as TCID50 equivalents per mL of sample (11\u201313) this does not imply a measurement of actual infectivity. 14, 17, 21, 26, and 34 tested for neutralizing antibodies against BVDV. duplicates of all samples were serially diluted 1:2 in DMEM with 5% horse serum (HS) and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (all Life Technologies) to a final dilution of 1:4096, then 3 102 TCID50 of BVDV 1373 were added. plates were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (IX51; Olympus, Center Valley Pennsylvania, USA), and 50% neutralizing titers were calculated by the Spearman-K\u00e4rber formula. the plates were coated with 400 ng of ovalbumin per well (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.05M carbonate/bi-carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from EDTA blood diluted 1:2 with PBS. cells were washed with PBS, aliquoted into 96-well cell culture plates. PBMCs were centrifuged for 5 min at 400 g, washed in PBS. images of stained cells were acquired using the IN Cell 2000 Analyzer. percentage of cells with CD4+, CD20+, and WC1+ markers was quantified using the IN Cell analysis software package for each sample. the group consisted of 27 steers and 5 heifers with weights ranging from 155 to 311 kg and a herd median weight of 230 kg. all animals received tulathromycin (Draxxin; Pfizer Animal Health, Kirkland, Quebec), 2.5 mg/kg body weight (BW), SC, and a multivalent clostridium vaccine. all individuals were monitored daily for health, with direct veterinary oversight. individual identification, weight, temperature, and clinical signs occurred on D-7 and D-5, then daily from D0 to D15, and periodically thereafter through D37. intra-nasal BVDV challenge (BVDV+) occurred on D0. incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (IFA; Sigma-Aldrich) was collected in a final volume of 2 mL. serum was inactivated by incubation at 56\u00b0C for 1 h and stored at 20\u00b0C. the relationship between infectious titer and viral RNA content is highly variable (14) but it allows comparisons of viral RNA content across different sample types and PCR runs. swabs were incubated with 1 mL of medium at room temperature (RT) for 30 min and then centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) after 72-hour incubation. cells were permeabilized for 30 min at RT in permeabilization buffer. cells were stained with 300 nM 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. in a 96-well polypropylene plate (VWR, Mississauga, Ontario), serum samples were prepared in 1:10 dilutions (IgM) or 1:1 dilutions (IgG) in a blocking buffer (10% v/v FBS in PBS-TSM), transferred to the ovalbumin-coated ELISA plate. between each step, the plates were washed 3 times with PBS-T. cells were washed with PBS, aliquoted into 96-well cell culture plates. PBMCs were centrifuged for 5 min at 400 g, washed in PBS and incubated. cells were stored at 4\u00b0C, protected from light until analysis. statistics All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20 (IBM, Armonk, New York) or JMP 11.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) normal distribution of the data was assessed for D0, D5 and D7 using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality with an alpha level of 0.05. BVDV RNA in serum was non-detectable through D4, was significantly elevated on D6 and peaked on D7 to D8, declining to non-detectable by D12. a peak in nasal excretion was noticeable around D6 to D12 PI in the animals, except for 1 calf. the BVDV RNA became detectable in the BVDV challenged animals D3 PI in both the OVA and OVA+ groups. the black diamonds and squares represent the mean virus RNA in serum (primary/left Y-axis), the error bars indicate the SEM. diamonds are OVA+, squares are OVA. the mean antibody titer (secondary/right Y-axis) was detected using a commercial IDEXX ELISA. BVDV antibody titer was detected in 50% of BVDV+ animals on D9. calf that became severely ill and was euthanized had no impact. calf was excluded from PBMC analyses because therapeutic fluids administration was expected to have affected cell counts. innoculation with OVA had no significant effect on CBC parameters. no difference was observed on any sampling day between the BVDV+ and BVDV groups. euthanized calf was excluded from ovalbumin analyses because therapeutic fluids were expected to have influenced the titers. there were no IgM or IgG antibodies to OVA in the OVA groups. there were no IgM antibodies to OVA in the OVA groups. sample, IgM titers continued to rise to D26, then fell almost to baseline on D37, at which time there were higher titers for OVA+ (P 0.0001) and for BVDV+ (P 0.02) with a significant interaction term (P 0.05), which indicated that BVDV+/OVA+ had significantly higher IgM titers than the other 3 groups. however, the BVDV+/OVA+ group was just reaching peak levels seen for hematocrit was 31.9 2.7% and white blood cell parameters were normal across 32 animals with regard to leucocytes (9.8 1.4 103), lymphocytes (6.8 1.1 103), monocytes (0.8 0.2 103), and granulocytes (2.2 0.7 103) cells/L. there was no evidence of fever, weight loss, elevated GCS, WBC alterations, the presence of BVDV viral RNA in serum or on swabs, or neutral swabs at D2 post-infection (PI) and peak in nasal excretion were noticeable around D6 to D12 PI. by D21 PI, very limited or no BVDV RNA was detected by nasal swabbing in the animals, except for 1 calf. peak viral RNA in serum occurred in both groups on D8 pi. there was no evidence of effects of OVA+/ on any measures of acute disease progression. anti-BVDV antibody ELISA reached detectable titers in the interval between D10 and D15. the BVDV antibody titer continued to increase and was still increasing at the last sample on D37. there was no evidence of an effect of OVA+/ status on the BVDV antibody titer. all BVDV+ fractions went down on D2 PI with the leucocyte count reaching a minimum of 5.0 0.2 103 cells/L on D5 PI. lymphocyte count reached a minimum of 3.5 0.2 103 cells/L on D7 PI. the relative amount of WC1 (-T cell marker) positive cells fluctuated. the absolute numbers were significantly lower in the first few days following infection for CD4+ and WC1+ cells. however, the CD20+ B-cells showed an initial depletion on D2 PI followed by an increase in absolute CD20+ cell numbers during D13 to D26 PI. there were no differences observed between OVA+ and OVA groups. OVA+ animals are represented by white squares (BVDV+) and white diamonds (BVDV). the grey area indicates the time when the rectal temperature was > 39\u00b0C in the BVDV-challenged group. DV+ (P 0.05) and an interaction term (P 0.05) matched the prediction that BVDV+ infection would delay initiation of the humoral immune response. clinical progression and viral load in blood replicated previous challenge experiments for this strain (16\u201318) specific IgM responses in the BVDV group peaked early and showed a decline (indicating a class-switching process) around D37. the BVDV+ group only reached the IgM levels seen for BVDV on D26. low-virulence BVDV decreased CD4+, CD8+ and -T subsets (5). it is also around the time that it was possible to detect a delay in IgG response to ovalbumin in the presence of BVDV. calves of mixed origin will be infected with BVDV shortly after their arrival. they will be exposed to variable temperature and environmental conditions. the study confirms that one important consequence of a BVDV infection may be that immune system responses to the vaccines used at processing or against newly encountered pathogens will be delayed."}
