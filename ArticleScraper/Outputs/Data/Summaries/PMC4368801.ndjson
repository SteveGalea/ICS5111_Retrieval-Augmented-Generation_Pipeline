{"summary": "the basic reproductive number (R0) is the average number of secondary cases a primary case will infect, assuming a completely susceptible population. if secondary cases occur shortly after the primary cases, a rapidly growing outbreak will result. the timing of secondary cases is most easily measured by the SI distribution, an observable quantity. Becker et al. [13] introduced a Bayesian framework to estimate R0 and the SI distribution by augmenting the likelihood function. they obtained posterior estimates through MCMC methods. they also made recommendations about the number of observations from the epidemic curve and contact tracing sample needed to obtain reliable estimates. prior distributions are necessary for each parameter of interest: in this instance R0 and p = pi,..., pk. a natural choice for a prior distribution for p is the Dirichlet distribution, which is the conjugate prior for the multinomial distribution. this prior will be referred to as the uniform prior in the following sections. the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet distribution can be updated with the number of observed serial intervals corresponding to each day of the SI. Previously, Becker et al. incorporated this information by augmenting it with the likelihood. the likelihood function only considers data from the epidemic curve, N. contact tracing sample is used to inform hyperparameters of the SI prior, P(p|r) Dirichlet( = 1). a sample from another outbreak of the same pathogen could be used to inform the prior. the simulation study was designed to assess the validity and utility of our proposed approach and provide guidance in selecting prior distributions. the following simulation study was designed to assess the validity and utility of our proposed approach. the first informative prior (prior 2) has 20 observed SIs, which corresponds to 40%, 10%, and 4% of the epidemic sizes listed above. the second (prior 3) includes only 10 observed SIs. this corresponds to 20%, 5%, 2% of the epidemic sizes listed above. we limit these analyses to only these outbreaks because of outbreak length limitations. the maximum k considered (k = 20) is larger than some simulated outbreak lengths. the uniform prior with corresponding k is used for each model. a 10,000 iteration burn-in was examined to explore sampler convergence. we apply our method to data from the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) outbreak in south africa and to the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and Singapore. a database of laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 during the 2009 pandemic. first appeared in the first 39 days of the outbreak (February 15th\u2014March 25th), while Singapore had 57 cases in the first 20 days of the outbreak [29]. Statistical model The method proposed in white and pagano [6] can simultaneously estimate the R0 and the SI by maximizing the likelihood shown in equation 1. a natural choice for a prior distribution for p is the Dirichlet distribution, which is the conjugate prior for the multinomial distribution. in the absence of prior information, we want to select hyperparameters such that the distribution will be noninformative [17\u201322] Becker et al. [13] incorporated this information by augmenting it with the likelihood (in equation 1) and used a Bayes-Laplace prior distribution for the SI. our approach directly informs the SI prior distribution with the observed SIs, which enables us to guide the estimation of the SI by weighting each day of the SI. contact tracing sample can be weighted as appropriate, P(p|r) Dirichlet( = r w). if the contact tracing sample is not available, a sample from another outbreak could be used to inform the prior. it may not be appropriate to combine data sources from different populations via the likelihood function, as in Becker et al. R0 assumes the values of 1.25, 3, and 6, and we examine epidemic sizes of 50, 200 and 500 cases. for each scenario discussed, 300 epidemics are generated, with all cases on the first day assumed to be index cases. the first misspecified prior (prior 4) is informed using an SI distribution that differs from the true distribution. however, the overall shape and mean of the SI distribution are very similar to the distribution used to generate the data. the second misspecified prior (prior 5) has a SI distribution that differs dramatically from the distribution used to generate the data. the Becker likelihood function is based on the White and Pagano model (equation 1). the rj represents the number of observed serial intervals for each increment of the serial interval distribution. the serial interval prior for the Becker method differs from our approach. for each scenario discussed, 300 epidemics are generated, with all cases on the first day assumed to be index cases. a description of the epidemic curves for each scenario is shown in Table 1. Means and Ranges of the Epidemic Lengths for each Simulation Scenario. the second misspecified prior (prior 5) has a SI distribution that differs dramatically from the distribution used to generate the data. both priors 4 and 5 are composed of 20 observed SIs. this corresponds to 40%, 10% and 4% of the epidemic sizes. rj represents the number of observed serial intervals for each increment of the serial interval distribution. rj represents the number of observed serial intervals for each increment of the serial interval distribution. the serial interval prior for the Becker method differs from our approach because it remains the same across all scenarios. we randomly select one imputed outbreak, and only the initial epidemic growth phase is examined. this includes 2,423 cases from days 15 to 35 of the epidemic. large gaps in cases occurred during the first two weeks of the epidemic due to no sustained transmission from these presumably imported cases. the national Institute for Communicable Diseases (NHLS) in south africa maintained a database of laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 during the 2009 pandemic. we randomly select one imputed outbreak, and because we are interested in estimating R0, only the initial epidemic growth phase of the outbreak is examined. the SI prior distribution is based on 179 (314% of the Singapore incidence data and 27% of the Hong Kong data) observed SIs in Singapore with a mean SI of 8.41 days [30]. results Simulation Results Detailed results from the simulations are provided in the supplement. the DIC selects the model with k = 5 most often. a range of possible models with reasonable choices of k should be considered. the choice of k can be determined by prior knowledge of similar outbreaks or general knowledge about. each model can be analyzed using a uniform prior distribution for the SI. smallest DICs indicate best fit, which can be used to narrow down the best model and value for k. these estimates can also be updated and confirmed as the outbreak continues and more cases are observed. 42 2.19 2.66 2.07 2.62, 2.42 1.92, 2.81 2.06, 2.85 1.66, 2.67 2.03, 3.29 1.08, 3.70 1.35, 4.37 p1 0.55 0.45 0.42 0.56 0.49 0.57 0.50 0.43, 0.67 0.38, 0.61 0.31, 0.52 0.43, 0.70 0.35, 0.63 0.08, 0.96 0.10, 0.85 p2 0.19 0.15 0.21 0.15 0.22 0.09, 0.32 0.07, the estimates for the average serial interval range from 2.00\u20132.66 days. the results from the white and pagano maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method are consistent with those from the Bayesian models. the DIC assessment compared 16 possible models with differing values of k, each with a uniform prior. the results for the informative Singapore analysis are similar to those observed in Lipsitch et al. [30], who observed a mean SI of 8.4 days. our estimate of R0, 3.86 (95% CI: 2.86\u20135.01) is similar to the estimate calculated by Wallinga and Teunis before the global health alert, R t = 3.1 (95% CI: 2.3, 4.0) and to the R0 calculated by Lipsitch et al., R 0 = 3.5 (95% CI: 1.5, 7.7). contact tracing sample size was 27% of the total outbreak size. simplest prior we consider is the uniform prior and with k = 20 this is already equivalent to 3% of the total outbreak size. k = 10 was not included due to the short total outbreak length. the DIC selects the model with k = 5 most often. some outbreak lengths are small relative to the largest maximum SI length (k = 20) that was considered, which could affect the estimates. k = 5, k = 7, k = 10, k = 15, k = 20. Simulation Conclusions When contact tracing samples are available this data should be used to inform the SI prior distribution. if enough generations of transmission have been observed to properly estimate a SI of a given maximum length k then the SI prior should be weighted to be no more 4% of the total outbreak size. a range of possible models with reasonable choices of k should be considered. the choice of k can be determined by prior knowledge of similar outbreaks or general knowledge about the pathogen. smallest DICs indicate best fit, which can be used to narrow down the best model and value for k. informative prior Uniform Prior White and Pagano C ILI P ILI Australia K = 5 K = 6 K = 5 K = 6 R0 1.36 1.41 1.43 1.38 1.46 1.36 1.47 1.27, 1.45 1.32, 1.51 1.35, 1.53 1.28, 1.49 1.34, 1.60 1.06, 2.65 1.08, 2.81 2.00 2.33 2.42 2.19 2.66 2.07 2.70 1.62, 2.42 1.92, 2.81 2.06, 2.85 1.66, 2. informative and Uniform priors are 95% credible intervals. DIC, Means and 95% CIs for South Africa Influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm for various uniform priors are 95% credible intervals. the estimates for the average serial interval range from 2.00\u20132.66 days. the results from the White and Pagano maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method are consistent with those from the Bayesian models. the results are consistent with those from the Bayesian models. the results for the informative Singapore analysis are similar to those observed in Lipsitch et al. [30], who observed a mean SI of 8.4 days. the epidemic curve data from Singapore is composed of cases prior to March 12th, the date in which WHO released their first global SARS alert. the results from the analysis of the Singapore data should be interpreted with caution given the limited outbreak size and short total epidemic length. we would recommend down weighting the contact tracing sample in the prior in this instance, but due to the large k this may not be feasible. the uniform prior may be most appropriate for this analysis. the results of the south africa influenza A(H1N1)2009pdm outbreak are shown in Table 3. five separate MCMC analyses were conducted, each with a different SI prior distribution, as well as two additional analyses using the white and pagano method. the first three MCMC analyses were performed using the informative priors shown in Fig. 2. 0.35, 0.63 0.08, 0.96 0.10, 0.85 p2 0.19 0.15 0.15 0.22 0.20 0.09, 0.32 0.07, 0.25 0.12, 0.31 0.04, 0.29 0.04, 0.28 0.00, 0.54 0.00, 0.49 p3 0.04 0.08 0.08 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.01, 0.11 0.03, 0.15 0.06, 0.19 0.00, 0.10 0.00, 0.09 0.00, 0.42 0.00, the results from the White and Pagano maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method are consistent with those from the Bayesian models. the confidence intervals for white and pagano are wider than the credible intervals obtained from the Bayesian approach. the results for the informative Singapore analysis are similar to those observed in Lipsitch et al. [30], who observed a mean SI of 8.4 days. we observe the smallest DIC for models with k = 6 or k = 7, which supports our findings above and our choice of k. our estimates for R0 (2.02 for the informative prior; 2.78 for the uniform prior) are smaller than what Wallinga and Teunis calculated. the estimates from white and Pagano are substantially larger, especially for Singapore. the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong was analyzed using three models with varying lengths of k (k = 10, 15, and 20) and a uniform prior for the SI; Singapore was not included due to the short total outbreak length. larger values for k were not considered due to a limited epidemic curve length of 39 days in Hong Kong. the increase in prior information led to a slight increase in the estimates of the reproductive number and the mean of the serial interval. the posterior mean of was almost identical to the prior mean, which indicates that a heavily weighted prior can bias the posterior results. for the SARS outbreak in Singapore and Hong Kong the contact tracing sample size was much larger relative to the number of cases in epidemic curve. the SARS outbreaks highlighted the improvements of a Bayesian approach. we observe more reasonable estimates for the posterior means compared to the MLEs. the white and pagano method has been shown to overestimate R0 as R0 increases. the best results were observed for large epidemic sizes. outbreaks based on smaller reproductive numbers resulted in better posterior estimates regardless of outbreak size. the issues with estimating the parameters with the larger R0 could be resolved. te beest et al. introduced an interval-censored approach that considers the time of symptom onset on the interval between consecutive days. one potential solution would be to modify the model to obtain time-updated estimates of the SI. we obtain better estimates for these measures when incidence data are sparse and comparable estimates with larger epidemic sizes compared to the traditional frequentist approach. our approach also allows for more flexibility when contact tracing samples contain a large number of observed SIs."}
