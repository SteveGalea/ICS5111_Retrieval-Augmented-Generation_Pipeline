{"summary": "information on age-specific hospitalizations and deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 infection from 2001 through 2009 was obtained from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (14, 15). over 50 sentinel general practitioners were available as the weekly proportion of outpatients reporting a fever of >37.8\u00b0C plus a cough or sore throat. data were stratified into 8 age groups: 0\u20134 years, 5\u201314 years, 15\u201329 years, 30\u201339 years, 40\u201349 years, 50\u201359 years, 60\u201369 years, and 70 years. each regression model, we included one of the measures of influenza activity as a covariate, lagged by 1 week to allow for a delay between infection and death. data on temperature and humidity were obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory. age-specific estimates of the cumulative incidence of pH1N1 infection in the first wave were determined in separate serological surveillance studies. 4 statistical models were used to estimate the excess deaths. influenza-associated excess mortality rates were calculated by subtracting the predicted mortality rate estimated from each fitted regression model based on the observed weekly influenza activity. all analyses were conducted in R, version 2.13.1, language and environment (20) ILI data tended to overestimate the lower levels of pH1N1 incidence rates. the product of ILI data and LAB data had the strongest correlation with pH1N1 incidence rates. estimates of excess mortality based on proxy measures of influenza activity gave estimates similar to those based on estimated pH1N1 incidence rates. in comparison, 54 deaths in patients with laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 before December 31, 2009 (7). point estimates of excess deaths were lower when influenza activity was lagged by 2 weeks and when it was not lagged. point estimates of the IFRc increased with age from 0.4 to 164 deaths per 100,000 infections for individuals from 5\u201314 years to 60\u201369 years of age. point estimates of the IFRc increased with age from 0.4 to 164 deaths per 100,000 infections for individuals from 5\u201314 years to 60\u201369 years of age. 3.8 1.1, 7.5 6 12.5 3.4, 51.4 8 16.7 51.2, 119 50\u201359 1,085,400 5.0 2.4, 8.3 15 27.9 14.6, 61.7 1 1.9 59.2, 49.9 60\u201369 555,500 0.8 0.2, 4,657 70 671,400 NA 14 NA 184 NA abbreviations. excess influenza deaths in the elderly tend to exceed confirmed deaths because of nonspecific presentation of influenza infections. the association with nonrespiratory causes of deaths in this age group (22, 23) 4 different statistical methods each gave similar estimates of the excess deaths associated with pH1N1. studies on previous influenza pandemics in 1918, 1957, and 1968 estimated the fatality risk among clinically apparent illnesses to be 100\u20132,500 per 100,000 patients. but estimates of the cumulative incidence of symptomatic infection are likely to vary depending on the case definition and health-care\u2013seeking behaviors and surveillance systems. individuals who died would not have had a chance to seroconvert. this would be a relevant consideration for studies of diseases with much greater severity than pH1N1."}
