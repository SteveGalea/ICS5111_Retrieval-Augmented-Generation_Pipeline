{"summary": "four closely related dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) of the genus Flavivirus, of the family Flaviviridae. deNV has a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 11 kb in length that encodes an open reading frame (ORF) of nearly 10,200 nucleotides processed by proteases of viral and cellular origin into three structural proteins. two types of virions are known: the mature extracellular virions, containing the M protein, and the immature intracellular virions, containing the precursor M (prM), which is proteolitically cleaved during maturation for the production of M glycoprotein (26,31). dengue viruses enter target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis through the direct interaction of viral E glycoprotein with host cell receptors, including DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin animals were sacrificed and the brains were removed in a sterile environment. the animals were sacrificed, and the brains were removed in a sterile environment. the macerate was then harvested and centrifuged at 2,800 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. after centrifugation, the macerate supernatant fluid was kept in ice to prevent further microbial loss. after centrifugation, the macerate supernatant fluid was kept in ice to prevent further microbial loss. the animals were fed twice daily with a commercial chow supplemented with fresh fruit, eggs, and vegetables, with water ad libitum. the animals were identified by \u201cmicrochip\u201d and a specific tattoo mark on the inner side of the hind limb. the deNV-2 antigen was diluted 1:2 with coating buffer. a 96-well EIA flat bottom high binding microplate was coated with antigen. the plate was washed three times with PBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20. the threshold (cutoff) was calculated with mean OD of negatives control plus three times the standard deviation (SD) group 1 received a dose of CLQ orally (25; 10; 5 mg/kg) on days 5, 6, 7 and 8; and a dose of 5 mg/kg on days 9 and 10. group 3 received a dose of CLQ (25 mg/kg) and 48 h later was infected s.c. with DENV-2. this group received a dose of CLQ (25 mg/kg) on days 1, 2, 3, and 4; a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 5, 6, 7, and 8; and a dose of 5 mg/kg on days 9 and 10. s was performed using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. each RT-PCR contained 5 L of buffer, 1 L dNTPs (10 mM), 1 L of multiscribe (50 U/L), 0.75 L of primers (20 nM) DV2U (5\u2032-AAG GTG AGA TGA AGC TGT AGT CTC-3\u2032) and 10 L of RNA. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was used to assess differences of cytokine production and liver enzymes at time-defined intervals from serum monkeys infected in contact with CLQ and control group (without the drug) p-values of 0.01 and 0.05 were considered statistically significant. C6/36, an Aedes albopictus cell line, was cultured in L-15 medium. supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine, 10% triptose phosphate, 1% penicillin G (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 g/mL), at 28\u00b0C in the absence of CO2. each brain was homogenized in 900 L of bovine skin gelatin 4%. the monkeys were kept in the colony of NHPs in the national primate center. they were fed twice daily with a commercial chow supplemented with fresh fruit, eggs, and vegetables. each animal had a protocol of five letters, according to the records of CENP. monkey sera were analyzed for antidengue immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the animals were weighed using a digital scale and the temperature of the animals was measured. peroxidase-conjugated antimonkey IgG goat IgG was added to the plate. the plate was washed six times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. the reaction was stopped by adding 100 L/well of 1 M phosphoric acid. animals were infected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 0.1 mL of DENV-2 (2106 PFU/mL) suspension (in the upper arm) blood was collected daily from the femoral vein for 10 days to detect viremia. infection of animals with 104.3\u2013106.1 PFU of DENV is usually considered to mimic the inoculum in a mosquito bite. viral replication is much lower than in humans (23). the assay was performed by a flow cytometry application that allowed the quantification of multiple cytokines simultaneously. the experiment was carried out in duplicate, and the results are shown as the mean values obtained from two individual experiments. the monkeys were released to their colonies. gG anti-DENV Group 1 Before infection After infection 1 AH-AKO Negative AH-ADA Negative AH-BBU Negative Negative 2 AH-BBL Negative Positive AH-BBL Negative Negative Positive AH-BBM Negative Positive 3 AH-BBN Negative AH-AKI Negative AH-AEV Negative Negative 4 AH-ADI Negative Negative AH-AIZ Negative Negative * Mock infection with fluid from mac viremia was detectable in only two animals (AH-BBR and AH-BAF) monkeys presented 1\u20132 days of viremia (mean duration of 1.5 day/animal) compared with controls. viremia in aotus azarai infulatus monkeys infected or uninfected with DENV-2. mock infection with fluid from macerate supernatant of the brain of 1- to 2-day-old suckling Swiss mice for the dengue virus serotype 2 stock. comparison of serum cytokines (IFN-, TNF-, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6) between the studied groups showed higher concentration of the cytokines. no statistically significant difference was observed in the production of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-2 in groups 1, 3, 4 and 5 compared with controls. the animal (AH-AIR) that was inoculated with mock macerate supernatant fluid of the brain of 1- to 2-day-old suckling Swiss mice failed to produce the cytokines.

Discussion NHPs have been used to investigate several aspects of DENV. these studies included those involved with the effect of natural and experimental infection. study showed that treating HIV-positive patients with CLQ resulted in an increase in TCD4+ cell counts in these patients. study showed an accumulation of CLQ 234 times in colostrum cells of HIV-infected African mothers who took CLQ 100 mg per day. dengue-infected individuals had significantly higher levels of IFN-, IFN-, and MDA compared to controls (8,29,34) previous studies showed that the blocking of proinflammatory cytokines by CLQ has been shown to be protective against inflammation and/or sepsis induced by LPS and DNA of Escherichia coli in mice. the presence of IgG antidengue antibodies in the serum of animals shows that these animals are able to respond to infection of DENV. the absence of IgG antibodies specific to antidengue serum of animals that received CLQ before infection demonstrates the efficacy of this drug in the prophylactic treatment."}
