{"summary": "epidemics and pandemics of emerging and re-emerging viral infectious diseases have posed a great threat to public health, human safety and economic stability worldwide. safety concerns have arisen over the use of whole inactivated or live-attenuated viruses for the development of antiviral vaccines. however, new concerns have been raised over the use of full-length viral spike proteins for developing subunit vaccines. the RBDs in the spike proteins of other viruses cause emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as influenza virus (Figure 2B), heV and NiV (Figure 2C) may also serve as targets for developing vaccines to prevent corresponding infectious diseases. the first new infectious disease identified in the twenty-first century is an acute and severe respiratory disease. a total of 8098 SARS cases with 774 deaths were reported during the 2003 outbreak. there is urgent need for effective strategies against this devastating viral agent. the virus replicates and is released to infect new target cells. the production and activation levels of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines are remarkably elevated, causing significant lung tissue damage. S protein of SARS-CoV is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with its N terminus on the surface of the infected cell or the virus particle. its precursor, consisting of 1255 amino acids (aa), can be cleaved by proteases into the surface subunit S1 (aa 17\u2013680) and the transmembrane unit S2 (aa 681\u20131195)28,29. receptor binding and membrane fusion make it a perfect target for vaccine and antiviral development. several vaccine candidates based on the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV have shown high immunogenicity in inducing neutralizing antibody responses. however, these vaccines may also induce harmful immune responses that cause liver damage. sal immunization of animals with the adeno-associated virus-based vaccine could elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV challenge. this strategy could also be applied to the development of vaccines against other infectious diseases. receptors such as dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin and/or liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing integrin determine SARS progression and tropism. mutations may enhance animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission. protein since depletion of the RBD-specific antibodies resulted in elimination of the neutralizing activity. recombinant RBD could absorb and remove most neutralizing antibodies from the antisera of mice, rabbits and monkeys immunized with a live-attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara virus. in 2003, another avian IAV subtype was reported to infect 89 humans with one death during a fowl plague outbreak in the Netherlands. the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAI) H5N1 has become a continuing threat to public health worldwide since its first report in 2003. each monomer is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide, HA0. it is then cleaved into two subunits, HA1 and HA2. different HAs of IAVs recognize different sialic acid receptors. current influenza vaccines and disadvantages The latest influenza pandemic caused by 2009 swine-origin IAV H1N1 and highly pathogenic strains of H5N1 makes it essential to develop efficacious vaccines to prevent future influenza pandemics. antibodies may neutralize various viruses by first recognizing and targeting specific positions (epitopes) of viral antigens. a number of neutralizing epitopes have been identified by binding of the neutralizing antibodies to the exposed loops surrounding the receptor binding site of HA protein. neutralizing epitopes at residues 260, 117, 118, 120 and 123.56 were also identified using H5N1-specific neutralizing monoclonal Ab 9F4. several immunodominant epitopes were identified by selection of escape mutants using neutralizing mAbs. studies on the development of such vaccines have been initiated. recombinant vaccines targeting the globular head RBD region fused to flagellin of Salmonella typhimurium fljB gene induced protective immunity to H1N1 and H5N1 infections in challenged mice. HA1-Fdc vaccine containing RBD neutralizing region induced high titers of antibodies that cross-neutralized clades 0, 1, 2.2 and 2.3.4 of H5N1 strains. vaccinated mice against high-dose lethal challenge of different strains of H5N1 covering clades 0, 1 and 2.3.4.64. HA and NA are two important envelope glycoproteins of the virus. different HAs of IAVs recognize different sialic acid receptors. swine bind preferentially to sialic acids in the (2,6) linkage. avians and equines recognize (2,3) linkages. influenza vaccines have been prepared on the basis of inactivated virus. viruses are grown in embryonated chicken eggs and then inactivated with formalin. these vaccines are mainly administered parenterally, limiting their ability to induce high immunity and efficacy in preventing heterologous virus infection. a group from the us food and drug administration map the epitopes of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) FLD21.140 into two aa clusters in the RBD, 121-SWS-123 and 164-YNNT-167. the highly conserved sequences among clades 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 of H5N1 viruses. neutralizing epitopes were identified by selection of escape mutants using neutralizing mAbs. these neutralizing epitopes cover residues at positions 138, 140, 155, 159, 189, 194, and 218 of RBD. recombinant vaccines targeting the globular head RBD region fused to flagellin of Salmonella typhimurium fljB gene induced protective immunity to H1N1 and H5N1 infections in challenged mice. it was demonstrated that a recombinant oligomeric protein covering H5N1 neutralizing epitopes elicited potent neutralizing antibodies in the vaccinated mice. HeV and NiV are emerging zoonotic viruses discovered during outbreaks in australia in 1994 and in Malaysia in 1998. the broad species tropism and the ability to cause severe diseases in both humans and animals distinguish HeV and NiV from other zoonotic viruses. both HeV and NiV have non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA genosomes encoding six major structural proteins. the G protein, which contains a length of 602 aa, is responsible for virus binding to the receptor and entry into the host cell. the first human neutralizing mAb, m101, with exceptional potency against HeV and NiV, was identified in 2006. it was found that the binding of HeV G mutants D260A, G439A, K443A and K465A to both m101 and m102.4 was almost completely eliminated. the binding activity of mutants G449A and D468A was significantly decreased. a safe vaccine candidate has been shown to induce the most effective immune response and protective immunity against SARS-CoV. it is expected that an RBD-based SARS vaccine will be one of the first SARS vaccines going to clinical trials. the first human neutralizing antibody, m101, is highly potent in neutralizing both HeV and NiV. the first human neutralizing antibody, m101, is highly potent in neutralizing both HeV and NiV,71. this suggests the potential of developing RBD-based vaccines. against HCV in the near future."}
