{"summary": "a cross-sectional study was conducted among 402 first year university students at Yeditepe university in Istanbul, Turkey between 1st and 30th of November 2009. the questionnaire was distributed by the students affiliated with SANITAS, a university club of students in health related sciences. the risk perception of males was significantly lower than that of females. new strategies should be developed to promote positive health behaviour among university students compatible with the international guidelines. new strains of influenza, H5N1 in recent years [1,2] and now H1N1 swine influenza [3-5], have made pandemic planning a priority for health authorities. public perceptions, beliefs and knowledge have a critical impact on the spread of pandemics. higher education institutions with large concentrations of young people have the potential to become serious outbreak centers. this indirectly may have a negative effect in the community. the target population was first year university students at Yeditepe University. in 2009, 13000 undergraduate students were registered in 11 colleges and 61 departments. one in every four students in student enrollment lists was selected for the study. the timing of the study was just after the peak point of the H1N1 pandemic in northern countries, including Turkey. the MOH initiated studies to increase public awareness very early including providing information on the internet, educating school teachers and elementary school children. the public information provided included guidance on hand washing, cough etiquette, face mask usage and general hygiene. survey questionnaires were pilot tested with eight students in an English prep class at Yeditepe university on 22 October 2009. SANITAS is a student club at SANITAS whose members are volunteer students from Faculties of Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry and Health Sciences. 82.1% (329/402) believed there was also a seasonal influenza outbreak in Turkey. 62.4% (250/402) believed that swine influenza was a modified form of seasonal influenza. 53.8% (224/402) believed it was fatal. there is a swine influenza outbreak in the world currently 47(11.7) 16 (4.0) 324 (80.6) 15 (3.7) There is a seasonal influenza outbreak in the world 47 (11.7) 50 (12.5) 304 (75.6) 1 (0.2) Swine influenza is a varied form of seasonal influenza 79 (19.7) 71 (17.6) 250 (62.2) 2 (0.5) anyone who comes to contact with someone infected with swine influenza is required to use antiviral drug 169 (42.0) 109 (27.1) 123 (30.5) 2 (0.5) Swine influenza vaccine needs only be provided to those in high risk groups 132 (32.8) 92 (22.9) 178 (44.3) 0 (0.0) Seasonal influenza vaccine keeps also from swine influenza 204 (50.7) 144 (35.8) 52 (13.0) 2 (0.5) 59.6% (221/402) of the participants thought that insufficient information had been provided regarding the vaccine against swine influenza. the vast majority of participants said they were unwilling to be vaccinated against influenza A/H1N1 while only 7.2% of participants said they would be. 370 of the 402 participants answered the survey's one of open-ended questions. only a 14.7% of those who answered said they did nothing for protection. participants' main source about the H1N1 pandemic was the media (72.1%, 290/402) while 19.9% (80/402) came from the internet and 8.0% (32/402) from the health personnel consultation. there was no significant difference between the information sources of males and females. most of the students thought that swine influenza was a modified form of seasonal influenza and that there was also a seasonal influenza outbreak in Turkey. most of them thought that swine influenza was a modified form of seasonal influenza and that there was also a seasonal influenza outbreak in turkey. the self-risk perception was not high in most of the students. risk perception was higher in females than males in the whole group. this difference was not observed among students in health sciences. 64.2% reported either \"no anxiety\" or \"disinterest\" at the beginning of the study. most of the students believed healthy people do not get swine influenza very easily. hand washing, wearing face mask and quarantine were the most effective measures. 60% of university students and staff were willing to be vaccinated in pre-pandemic period. but the percentage of those willing to be vaccinated in our study group was -7.2%. participants expressed negative attitude toward influenza A/H1N1 vaccine. unless scientific evidence was available, the rate of vaccination in the general populations would be low. risk perceptions of students are low to moderate and will remain so unless a change in characteristic of pandemic status occur. new strategies should be developed to promote positive health behaviour among university students compatible with the international guidelines. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
