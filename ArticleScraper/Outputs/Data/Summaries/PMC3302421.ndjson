{"summary": "IFNs are divided into three distinct types (types I to III), characterized by sequence, receptor usage, and biological activity (18). IFN-, which is expressed as multiple subtypes (13 in humans), is produced primarily by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (19). IFN-, on the other hand, is produced by a wide variety of cell types. IRF-3 is constitutively expressed in most cell types and becomes phosphorylated following the recognition of a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (33), including viral nucleic acids (74) homodimeric complexes accumulate in the nucleus, where an interaction with the transcriptional cofactor p300/CBP potentiates the transcription of IFN- (30, 40, 75), human IFN-1 (23, 38), and murine IFN-4 (58 3 of the 4 vIRFs encoded within KSHV can individually inhibit the induction of IFN and IFN-induced signaling by disrupting the functions of cellular IRF-1, IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7 (9, 10, 20\u201322, 29, 43, 71, 76) the inhibitory mechanisms employed by each of the vIRFs are varied, suggesting that each vIRF plays a unique and significant role. ence analysis suggests that RRV likely acquired the first 4 vIRFs (ORFs R6 to R9) initially and that these genes later underwent a duplication event to result in a total of 8 vIRFs within the RRV genome (60). the duplicated vIRFs (R10 to R13) share redundant functions with their respective antecedents, as is case for the KSHV vIRFs. vIRFs play a critical role in dampening antiviral responses early during RRV infection. rhesus fibroblasts (RFs), telomerized RFs (tRFs) and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. megalovirus (RCMV), simian foamy virus (SFV) and simian foamy virus (SFV) used plaque-purified isolates of RRV17577 (WTBAC RRV17577) (16) and RRV17577-GFP. all RRV stocks were purified through a 30% sorbitol cushion and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. the 10.9-kb region (nucleotides) encoding the 8 vIRFs (ORF R6 to ORF R13) within RRV was then cloned into pSP73. the linearized cassette was then cloned into recombinogenic Escherichia coli strain EL250 (35), which contains the WT RRV17577 BAC. EL250 clones with successful recombination vIRF-ko RRV17577 BAC DNA from EL250 clones was transfected. recombinant virus subsequently went through two rounds of plaque purification in RFs to obtain purified clone of vIRF-ko RRV. RFs were infected with BAC-derived WT or vIRF-ko RRV (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 0.01) and allowed to progress to complete CPE before the supernatant and cells were collected and digested overnight with proteinase K. RNA was isolated from tRFs and rhesus macaque PBMCs by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and DNA endonuclease, RQ1, was used to remove DNA from RNA preperations according to kit protocols.

IRF-3-mediated transcription was measured by using a reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase driven by 5 copies of the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE-LUC) gene-specific sequences are in boldface type; gene-specific sequences are in uppercase type. HEK293 cells were transfected overnight with 250 ng pISRE-LUC, 10 ng pRL-SV40, and 240 ng empty pcDNA3.1(). cells were then transfected with poly(IC) (10 g) for 6 h. data were made relative to luciferase units recorded for an empty vector stimulated with poly(IC) vIRFs are encoded within a 10.95-kbp region (nucleotides 78436 to 89386) between ORF 57 and ORF 58. tRFs were infected (MOI = 2), and RNA was extracted at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hpi. the deletion of the vIRFs and the Flp removal of the Kanr cassette resulted in a 199-bp lesion. to verify this, BAC DNA from the vIRF-ko RRV clone was isolated. the genomic region containing the vIRF deletion was amplified and sequenced to confirm targeted deletion. vIRF-ko RRV clone was subsequently transfected into RFs to produce infectious virus. BAC DNA from the vIRF-ko clone was then transfected into RFs to produce infectious virus. this virus was then used to infect RFs transiently expressing Cre recombinase. CGH is a sensitive, array-based analysis used to identify single-nucleotide changes, insertions/deletions, and rearrangements between highly similar genomes. the analysis did not detect any changes in the vIRF-ko RRV isolate compared to WTBAC RRV viral DNA. RFs were infected with recombinant RRV isolates in single-step (MOI = 2.5) (A) and multistep (MOI = 0.1) (B) growth curves. infected RFs were harvested at specified time points and subjected to a serial-dilution plaque assay on RFs. a and b) utilized 2 distinct poly(A) sites (shaded in gray) the stop codon is underlined, and the addition site of the poly(A) tail is noted. the most prevalent transcript is marked (arrow) (F) and was subsequently cloned and sequenced to identify a single poly(A) site (>) the poly(A) site further downstream of the stop codon is preferentially used during vIRF-ko RRV infection. there was also a third, less abundant product identified for ORF 57 in vIRF-ko RRV-infected cells. vIRFs are necessary for efficient infection of rhesus macaque PBMCs. the vMIP transcript was present in both WTBAC RRV- and vIRF-ko RRV-infected PBMCs throughout the 48-h time course. as expected, the vIRF R10 transcript was present only in WTBAC RRV-infected PBMCs. the transcript was present at 3 hpi and persisted through 48 hpi. leukocytes were isolated from the spleens of six RMs. clones of vIRF-ko RRV and vIRF-ko RRV were used to infect leukocytes. compared by flow cytometry at 24 and 48 hpi. infected PBMCs were surface stained to delineate T cells, B cells, monocytes, myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (8). vIRF-ko RRV infects T cells, B cells, monocytes, and mDCs at a reduced efficiency. rhesus macaque PBMCs were infected with WTBAC RRV or vIRF-ko RRV. RNA was extracted at the indicated time points and used to prepare and amplify cDNA for real-time RT-PCR specific for IFN- (A), IFN-1 (B) and IFN- (C) transcripts were normalized to levels of GAPDH in each sample and made relative to a positive-control sample included on each induction of IFN-1 in tRFs was unremarkable during 72-h time course. levels between 0.5 and 1% of magnitude of IFN-1 induction after poly(IC) stimulation, the positive control. vIRF-ko RRV infection resulted in a progressive increase in IFN-1 transcript levels. vIRFs limit IFN- production by pDCs in RRV-infected PBMCs. the vIRF-dependent inhibition of IFN was also detected at the protein level. freshly isolated PBMCs from six expanded-specific-pathogen-free rhesus macaques were infected with WTBAC or vIRF-ko RRV (MOI = 1) for 12, 24, and 48 h. only 6% of pDCs still producing IFN- at 24 hpi in RRV-infected cultures. deletion of vIRFs resulted in sustained production of IFN-. pDCs were mock infected or infected with WTBAC or vIRF-ko RRV. the total levels of IRF-3 present in whole-cell extracts remained unchanged. both WTBAC and vIRF-ko RRV induced similar levels of IRF-3 dimerization. however, vIRF-ko RRV infection did result in an increase in the nuclear accumulation of IRF-3 at 6 hpi. RFs were infected with WTBAC RRV or vIRF-ko RRV (MOI = 1). Whole-cell extracts were analyzed for total IRF-3 (FL-425) and phospho-Ser396 IRF. data were analyzed by using densitometry to quantify the amount of IRF-3 present in the dimeric form. full-length PARP and GAPDH were used as loading controls. N.S., not significant; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. R6 vIRF independently inhibits IRF-3-mediated transcription. KSHV vIRF-1 inhibits 80% of IRF-3-mediated transcription. expression of R6 vIRF inhibits IRF-3-mediated transcription by at least 60%. RRV vIRFs were tagged with HA, cloned into pcDNA3.1(). HEK293 cells were transfected as described above for panel B. RFs were nucleofected with R6-HA, R7-HA, or pEGFP or mock transfected (no DNA) for 48 h. immunoprecipitated lysates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. RFs and immunoprecipitated with IRF-3 pAb or HA MAb followed by Western blot analysis. the spatial relationship between R6 vIRF and IRF-3 within the cell was also examined by immunofluorescence analysis. RRV encodes 8 vIRFs (ORFs R6 to R13) encoded in a cluster between ORF 57 and ORF 58. RT-PCR revealed an early and sustained expression of all eight vIRFs during the first 24 h of infection. the vIRFs are encoded within a cluster in the RRV genome. to verify the targeted recombination of the vIRFs, BAC-derived DNA was digested with BamHI. the deletion of the vIRFs and the Flp removal of the Kanr cassette resulted in a 199-bp lesion, including a single FRT site (48 bp) vIRF-ko RRV clone was isolated, and the genomic region containing the vIRF deletion was amplified and sequenced to confirm targeted deletion. the genomic region containing the vIRF deletion was amplified and sequenced to confirm targeted deletion and that there were no changes in the surrounding genomic sequence. vIRF-ko clone was transfected into RFs to produce infectious virus. BAC DNA from the vIRF-ko clone was then transfected into RFs. this virus was then used to infect RFs transiently expressing Cre recombinase. a purified isolate of vIRF-ko RRV was purified via comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) vIRF-ko RRV showed growth kinetics and magnitude similar to those of WTBAC RRV. vIRF-ko RRV showed growth kinetics and magnitude similar to those of WTBAC RRV. a representative image is shown (magnification, 200), with the percentage of GFP-expressing cells included within each image. RNA was harvested at 72 hpi and analyzed via 3\u2032 RACE to verify the transcription of ORF 57 and ORF 58. a third transcript was also detected in vIRF-ko RRV infection but resulted in a truncated transcript (#) RRV ORF 58 is also conserved among gammaherpesviruses (51) and encodes a protein with a putative epithelial binding function. coding regions for ORF 57 and ORF 58 are oriented in opposing directions, both being transcribed toward the vIRF region. a third, less abundant product identified for ORF 57 in vIRF-ko RRV-infected cells. vIRFs are necessary for efficient infection of rhesus macaque PBMCs. RRV ORF R3, which encodes viral macrophage inflammatory protein (vMIP), was examined. RT-PCR was initially used to verify the presence of RRV transcripts as a marker of RRV infection. rhesus macaque PBMCs were isolated from (RRV-seronegative) RMs. RNA was harvested at the indicated time points and analyzed by RT-PCR for RRV vMIP (ORF R3), RRV vIRF (ORF R10), and GAPDH, as a loading control. 5% of PBMCs were infected with vIRF-ko RRV compared to 15% and 19% of PBMCs in vIRF-ko RRV-infected cultures. vIRF-ko RRV infects T cells, B cells, monocytes, and mDCs at a reduced efficiency. we measured the induction of type I (IFN- and IFN-) and type II (IFN-) IFN in tRFs and rhesus macaque PBMCs using real-time RT-PCR. gene expression was normalized to GAPDH expression and determined relative to the positive control. the induction occurs early during viral infection in a variety of cell types. positive control was cDNA from tRFs transfected with poly(IC) (10 g/ml for 6 h) positive control was cDNA from PBMCs treated with recombinant human IFN-2 (10 units/ml for 6 h) data are average data from at least three independent experiments each with tRFs and PBMCs. vIRF-ko RRV infection induced IFN- expression at 48 to 72 hpi. RRV infection of PBMCs induced IFN- with kinetics similar to those of IFN-1 induction. vIRF-ko RRV infection induced 3-fold more IFN- at 6 hpi. IFN- production within pDCs was measured by ICCS. HSV-1 stimulation of rhesus macaque PBMCs was used as a positive control. approximately 15% of the pDC population was producing IFN- at 12 hpi in both WTBAC RRV- and vIRF-ko RRV-infected PBMC cultures. however, only 6% of the pDCs were still producing IFN- at 24 h PBMCs were stimulated with HSV-1 for 12 h as a positive control for IFN- production. surface marker expression was used to delineate pDCs. vIRFs inhibit nuclear accumulation of IRF-3 during RRV infection. vIRF-ko RRV infection specifically results in an earlier and sustained accumulation of hyperphosphorylated forms of IRF-3 within the nucleus from 2 to 8 hpi. vIRF-ko RRV infection did not result in a similar nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated forms of IRF-3. RFs were fixed and analyzed via indirect immunofluorescence for IRF-3 (SL012.1) and nuclei were detected by using Hoechst dye (blue) RFs were transfected with poly(IC) (10 g for 6 h) as a positive control for IRF-3 activation/nuclear localization. a representative image at 6 hpi is shown (magnification, 400) tRFs and HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a firefly luciferase plasmid under control of an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)-containing promoter. cells were stimulated 24 h later with poly(IC) to induce the activation of IRF-3. the expression of R6 vIRF resulted in the most significant effect. RRV vIRFs (R6, R7, R10, and R11) were C-terminally tagged with HA. whole-cell lysates were collected from RFs transfected with a single vIRF construct at 36 h posttransfection. HEK293 cells were transfected overnight with 500 ng total DNA. immunoprecipitated lysates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. half was used to probe for HA, and the other half was used to probe for IRF-3. image is representative of 3 separate experiments. the colocalization of R6 vIRF and IRF-3 does not seem to be restricted to either the cytoplasm or the nucleus. however, there was no apparent colocalization between R7 vIRF and cellular IRF-3, even following poly(IC) stimulation. vIRF expression did not inhibit the nuclear localization of IRF-3 following poly(IC) stimulation. the deletion of the vIRFs using WTBAC RRV has finally allowed an evaluation of the impact of vIRFs during de novo RRV infection. the deletion of the vIRFs results in increased gene expression and production of IFN and increased nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated IRF-3 during de novo RRV infection. vIRF-ko RRV infection did not affect viral growth in RFs. it is unlikely that the less abundant, truncated transcript interferes with the efficient expression of ORF 57. vIRF-ko RRV infection resulted in an earlier and more robust induction of type I and type II IFN during RRV infection. pDCs are unique in their sole expression of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9. detection of RRV transcripts by 3 hpi in RRV-infected PBMC cultures imply that pDCs are likely responding to direct infection with RRV, potentially through the recognition of its genomic DNA. a further characterization of the relationship between R6 vIRF and IRF-3 revealed that R6 vIRF can directly or indirectly interact with endogenous IRF-3. a role for vIRFs in the stimulation of IRF-mediated transcription (41) could promote the cytokine-enhanced reactivation of the virus. the inhibition of type I IFNs by vIRFs could disrupt both the innate and adaptive immune responses during in vivo RRV infection. previous in vitro analyses demonstrated that KSHV vIRF-1 and vIRF-3 can also interfere with type II IFN signaling. however, the vIRF-mediated inhibition of IFN- may be important for other cell types that were not examined here. focus on the impact of vIRFs during in vivo RRV infection in the rhesus macaque to further our understanding of their role in immune evasion and pathogenesis."}
