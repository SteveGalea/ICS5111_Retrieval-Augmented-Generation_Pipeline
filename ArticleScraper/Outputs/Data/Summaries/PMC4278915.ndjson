{"summary": "studies on single gene/protein/metabolite molecular signatures offer limited insight into the complex interplay between the molecules responsible for progression of complex diseases such as cancer. there is a shift toward the identification of a panel of genes that interact directly or indirectly in the form of pathway or complex network to evaluate their association to cancer 2,3. challenges lie in high false positive rate of the candidate biomarkers identified from omics data; lack of attention on the study of the context of biomarkers identified from omics data; lack pathway and network-based analyses are applied to omics data to gain more insight into the underlying biological function and processes. a number of pathway /network approaches have also been used for improving the prediction of cancer outcome, providing novel hypotheses for pathways involved tumor progression 7 and exploring cancer associated biomarkers 8. a variety of computational tools and algorithms have been proposed for biomarker discovery based on pathway and network methods. the most commonly used methods are categorized roughly into statistical 17, graph theory 18, Bayesian methods 19, text mining 20, machine learning 21-23 and integrative methods summarized in Table 1. aNOVA model approach is widely used in multiple types of omic data. it was used to model microarray data with the effects of array, condition, and condition-array interaction. it was applied to capture the effects of controlled groups, batches, condition, and condition-array interaction separately on LC-MS data 40. the complexity of graphical modeling can be either simple only with nodes and edges or more complex where edges have weights. recent publications have applied graphical modeling in computational biology to study biological networks, enhance the ability to draw causal inferences from functional MRI experiments. Cytoscape 31, one of the free open source platforms providing biological network analysis and visualization with more than 172 registered plugins contributed by the community. IPA 56 provides powerful graphical visualized pathways and networks overlaid by diseases, drugs and biological process. STRING provides abstractive graphical interface for users to analyze gene expression, protein interaction and metabolic data. Bayesian inference is one of the very important methods widely used in cancer biomarker discovery, signaling pathway and network inference 65,66. it has previously been applied to gene expression data for inference of gene regulatory networks 67,68, infer both protein signaling networks 69,70 and gene regulatory networks 71. the difference between Bayesian and frequentist inference lies in: 1) Bayesian inference provides answers conditional on the observed data and not based on the distribution of estimators or test statistics over imaginary samples not observed. 2) it includes uncertainty in the probability model, yielding more realistic predictions. text mining has been widely used in industrial large scale knowledge base. IPA (Ingenuity) 56, KEGG 81, Pathway Studio 82 and HPRD 83 use text-mining to integrate gene/protein-phenotype associations linking genes and protein variants to diseases, toxic effects and drug response to their knowledge databases. machine learning methods have been used for the biomarker discovery from high-throughput omics data, inferring causal relations between genes and proteins 86-88 and relations between environmental features and cancer 89. the other is supervised machine learning which needs known knowledge from data train a model. the methods described in Sections A-E have proven useful for discovering biomarkers from high-throughput omic data, analyzing protein-protein, protein-DNA, and kinase-substrate interactions. current omic technologies provide only limited fragmented reality of the biological functions within cell or cancer mechanism. different biological types of data, such as sequences, protein structures and families, proteomics data, ontologies, gene expression and other experimental data sets show a growing complexity. the integration of heterogeneous data is therefore becoming more and more important. linear discriminant analysis (LDA) requires more observations to estimate each variance-covariance matrix for each class 43. logistic regression analysis has been successfully used to evaluate biomarker performance of prostate cancer with mRNA profiling 44. network analysis can yield important information on how expression variation relates to differences between observed states 52. a standard system-based approach to biomarker and drug target discovery consists of placing putative or known biomarkers in the context of a network of biological interactions. the goal of graph visualization is to find patterns and structures that remain hidden in the raw unstructured datasets. Bayesian methods include Bayesian inference, Bayesian network, Naive Bayes classifier and Bayesian variable selection. the primary application of Bayesian methods include Bayesian inference, Bayesian network, Naive Bayes classifier and Bayesian variable selection. a dependency structure and local probability model also named probabilistic graph models. dynamic Bayesian Inference was proposed to interrogate dynamic signaling responses within a Bayesian framework. existing signaling biology incorporated through an informative prior distribution on networks 66. a number of new methods bypass this limitation. text mining comprises the discovery and extraction of knowledge from free text to generate new hypotheses particularly relevant and helpful in biomedical research 14. the primary application of text-mining in biomedical research roughly lies in three aspects: 1) simple text-mining such as transforming textual information into database content and integrating with existing knowledge resources. text-mining is prone to integration with machine learning, statistical techniques. the trend is to integrate information from literature with data sets from other domains such as gene expression profiles 84, genome-wide association studies, biochemistry and phenotype 84,85. hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subclasses were significantly correlated to Wnt pathway, MYC, AKT and hepatocyte differentiation respectively. omic technologies provide only limited fragmented reality of the biological functions within cell or cancer mechanism. integration of multiple disparate data types remains a significant challenge in systems biology research. integration of multiple high-throughput omics data remains a significant challenge in systems biology research. therapy with sorafenib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinase receptors (RAS/VEGFR) may prolong survival by about three months. however, due to the redundancy and compensation of the signaling network in HCC, a significant reorganization of the signaling network observed such as down regulation of tumor suppressors. KEGG and Zheng et al 129 found four subnetworks called normal-cirrhosis, cirrhosis-dysplasia, dysplasia-early and early-advanced HCC networks. from each of the subnetworks they identified functional modules and hub genes. by comparison, they observed changes of pathways and network activities. t-statistic map (TM) and transcriptome correlation map (TCM) approaches. found 50 driver genes with significant prognostic relevance to HCC key signaling pathways such as mTOR, AMPK, and EGFR. siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments were used to evaluate the functional significance of the 50 driver genes 131. uHCVdb/hepatitis Virus Database (HVDB) 136 http://s2as02.genes.nig.ac.jp Los Alamos National Laboratory in the united states137 http://hcv.lanl.gov LiverAtlas138 http://liveratlas.hupo.org.cn dbHCCvar139 http://GenetMed.fudan.edu.cn/dbHCCvar Limitations mRNA levels and DNA alterations may not accurately reflect the corresponding protein levels. the signaling network constructed using these approaches does not reflect the dynamic signal flow in a spatial relationship. current proteomic technologies provide only limited coverage of the proteome. biomarker discovery is changing research away from identification of individual biomarkers to searching for perturbed pathways and network activities. the treatment of most cancers is based on the tissue types and clinical stages. this approach is often ineffective due to the heterogeneity of the tumors."}
