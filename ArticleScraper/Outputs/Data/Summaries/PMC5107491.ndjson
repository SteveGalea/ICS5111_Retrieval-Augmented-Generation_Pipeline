{"summary": "pneumonia is a type of lung disease characterized by proliferation of granulation tissue in the alveoli or alveolar duct, with or without obliteration of distal bronchioles. there are several reports of organizing pneumonia after coronavirus infections, especially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. there is limited information on lung disease caused by MERS-CoV infection. hemoglobin, 11.1 g/dL, platelet count, 115,000/L; international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (PT-INR), 1.52; aspartate aminotransferase, 165 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 79 IU/L; total bilirubin, 11.76 mg/dL; direct bilirubin, 8.85 mg/dL; total protein, 6.4 g/dL; chest radiographs showed newly developed consolidative opacity in the right lower and left upper lung zones. neither bacteria nor fungus were detected on a sputum examination. a chest radiograph showed improvement in the lung lesions. methylprednisolone was tapered gradually over 2 months. he was discharged 10 days after re-admission with oral methylprednisolone. methylprednisolone 32 mg 25 Fever disappearance Improvement of chest radiographs 30 Discharge (oral methylprednisolone 28 mg) 30\u201382 Gradual tapering of methylprednisolone in outpatient clinic 110 Complete resolution on follow-up chest CT, computed tomography; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. secondary organizing pneumonia can result from infections (including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi), connective the majority of patients were infected by person-to-person transmission in healthcare facilities or households (11-13), with a median incubation period of 5.2 days (12). most fatal cases were frequently associated with significant comorbidities such as obesity, renal disease, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, lung disease, and immunosuppressive conditions. coronavirus infections (3-5,8) present case suggests that organizing pneumonia can occur in a patient with a MERS-CoV infection. corticosteroid use may be helpful for treating suspected organizing pneumonia in a patient with MERS-CoV infection."}
