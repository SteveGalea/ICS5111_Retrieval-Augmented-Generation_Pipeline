{"summary": "Lassa virus is a member of the Arenaviridae family of viruses. more than 20 cases of imported Lassa fever have been reported. no vaccine against the virus has been approved for human use. -dystroglycan (-DG) is a binding receptor for LCMV. -DG binds components of the extracellular matrix, such as laminin. -DG spans the cellular membrane and binds the intracellular cytoskeleton. laminin is a ligand for DG and blocks binding of Lassa virus to DG (35) but it cannot block LCMV-mediated infection of Vero cells (34) this suggests that DG is not the sole receptor for Lassa virus or LCMV. a human liver cDNA library in the pMX plasmid was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) a human liver cDNA library in the pFB plasmid was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) a human liver cDNA library in the pFB plasmid was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) jurkat cells were infected with the Josiah strain of Lassa virus at an MOI of 0.2. cDNAs inserted into the Venus-positive colonies were amplified and sequenced as described previously. antibodies to the TAM family (clone 108724, clone 96201, goat polyclonal antibody AF154) and to dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGNR) and recombinant human chimeric proteins (Axl/Fc and anti-actin (AC-74) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO); anti-DG (IIH6C4) and anti ulin G1 Fc region at the N and C termini, respectively, were expressed from pCAGGS/MCS plasmids in 293T cells. buffers containing the purified proteins were changed to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) infectivity was calculated as (titer in the presence of genistein)/(titer in the presence of the vehicle) 100. data are means standard deviations (n = 3). a system based on the MLV retroviral vector was used to infect Jurkat cells. a human liver cDNA library in the pFB plasmid was purchased from Stratagene. a human liver cDNA library in the pFB plasmid was purchased from Stratagene. the proteins were used to pseudotype a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based lentiviral vector or VSV as described previously (60, 63) jurkat cells were incubated with an HIV lentiviral vector carrying Lassa virus GPC as an envelope protein and feline CD2 gene as part of the genome. the backbones of the pseudotyped viruses are HIV (A) and VSV (B) serially diluted pseudotyped viruses were inoculated onto cells. cells were inoculated with authentic Lassa virus at an MOI of 0.2. antibody against hemagglutinin (HA) tag (clone HA-7) and anti-actin (AC-74) purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) anti--DG (IIH6C4) and anti-DG (43DAG1/8D5) purchased from upstate (Lake Placid, NY) and abcam (Cambridge, MA), respectively. the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein was purchased from Sigma. it was used at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 4. cells were infected with pseudotype viruses in the presence of genistein. chimeric proteins fused with the Fc portion of human IgG were incubated with HIV-LaGPC(Venus) on ice. 30 minutes later, protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the HIV antigen was measured as described for the cell-based assay. cDNA libraries from vero E6 cells and liver were introduced into Jurkat cells. cells were then incubated with HIV-LaGPC(fCD2), an HIV-based lentiviral vector carrying Lassa virus GPC as an envelope protein. cells were then incubated with HIV-LaGPC(Venus) expression of human Axl, Tyro3, Mer, LSECtin, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGN-related (DC-SIGNR), macrophage galactose lectin (MGL), and fCD2 (a negative control) in Jurkat cells. we evaluated the susceptibility of cells expressing these molecules by using the HIV pseudotype virus HIV-LaGPC(Venus) no significant changes in titers were the members of the C-type lectin family DC-SIGN and LSECtin bind Ebola virus particles and mediate viral entry (2, 23). we tested their specificity with respect to enhancing virus entry. we selected three viral glycoproteins\u2014VSV G, SARS-CoV Spike (SARSSpike), and MLV Env. the titers of HIV-SARSSpike(Venus) and HIV-MLVEnv(Venus) were 1.5 105 IU/ml in ACE2-expressing cells and 1.6 106 IU/ml in mCAT-expressing cells. these results indicate that the four molecules Axl, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, and LSECtin enhance the susceptibility of cells to HIV and VSV pseudotyped with Lassa virus GPC cells were first incubated with virus particles and then washed to remove unbound particles. expression of Axl, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, or LSECtin, but not Tyro3, enhanced the binding of HIV-LaGPC(Venus) to Jurkat cells. expression of LARGE, which is a putative N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (52) resulted in increased virus binding. DGFc5, a soluble form of DG fused with Fc, bound to HIV-LaGPC(Venus) particles, but DGFc1, a truncated form of DG (36), did not. binding of HIV-based pseudotype particles to soluble chimeric proteins was measured by using an HIV-1 p24 antigen ELISA. we performed the cell-based and Fc chimera-based binding assays using the Lassa VLPs to find out whether results similar to those observed with the pseudotypes would be obtained. in the cell-based assay, Lassa VLPs bound to cells expressing Axl, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, or LSECtin to a greater extent than to control cells. this results suggest that Axl, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, and a series of Axl mutants had various truncations in the extracellular region and an HA tag in a region proximal to the transmembrane domain. to measure the binding of the pseudotype virus to the Axl mutants, we performed cell-based virus binding assays. we also examined the abilities of the Axl mutants to render Jurkat cells susceptible to Lassa virus infection.

Axl delCT, which lacked the entire intracellular region, was detected at higher levels on the cell surface and bound to HIV-LaGPC(Venus) more efficiently than intact Axl, but it did not confer HIV-LaGPC(Venus) susceptibility on cells. this mutation abolished the ability of Axl to confer HIV-LaGPC(Venus) susceptibility on cells. 103 73 2 Axl Y821F 92 106 31 a Schematic structures of Axl mutants are shown in Fig. 3B. b The binding of HIV-LaGPC(Venus) particles to Axl mutant-expressing Jurkat cells was measured by using an HIV p24 antigen ELISA. o3 mutants were fused to immunoglobulin Fc (Fig. 3D) in a chimera-based assay. both immunoglobulin domains were present, indicating the importance of these domains for Tyro3-mediated Lassa virus infection. tyrosine kinases contribute to axl- and Tyro3-mediated Lassa virus infection. genistein reduced the infectivity of HIV-LaGPC(Venus) more efficiently than that of HIV-VSVG(Venus) mannan, a polymer of mannose, is one of its high-affinity ligands. mannan and GlcNAc1-2Man inhibited the binding of lectin-expressing cells. mannan and GlcNAc1-2Man performed the cell-based virus binding assay. lectins lead to endocytosis mediated by internalization signals of lectins. effects of carbohydrates (500 g/ml) on binding of HIV-LaGPC(Venus) to Jurkat cells expressing DC-SIGN or LSECtin. mannosylation failed to show a positive signal for Jurkat cells by flow cytometry or Western blotting. MAb 43DAG1/8D5, which is specific for the cytoplasmic tail of DG, showed a positive band for Jurkat cells in Western blot analysis. the low infectivity of Lassa GPC pseudotype viruses in Jurkat cells is probably due to the carbohydrate modification status of DG. b, with Jurkat cells expressing the indicated molecules. an isotype-matched antibody (thin lines) was also used. effects of knockdown (KD) by shRNA for LacZ (shlacZ) (control) or shDG on infection-enhancing effects of the four molecules indicated. lentivirus expression system did not work efficiently in ES cells. pCAGGS/MCS expression plasmid was used to express molecules of interest. titers of VSV-LaGPC(GFP) were 10-fold higher than those in control cells. soluble form of O-mannosylated -DG partially reduced HIV-LaGPC(Venus) infection in this cell line. but in the presence of DGFc5, an anti-Axl antibody was inhibitory. both Axl and O-mannosylated DG are Lassa virus receptors but that O-mannosylated DG is more efficient as a receptor than Axl. screens identified members of the TAM family and the C-type lectin family as facilitators of Lassa virus cell entry. we introduced the cDNA libraries from vero E6 cells and liver into Jurkat cells by using an MLV vector to identify the gene(s) that conferred susceptibility to Lassa virus cell entry into cells. cells were then incubated with HIV-LaGPC(fCD2), an HIV-based lentiviral vector carrying Lassa virus GPC as an expression of human Axl, Tyro3, Mer, LSECtin, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGN-related (DC-SIGNR), macrophage galactose lectin (MGL) and fCD2 (a negative control) in Jurkat cells. no significant changes in titers were observed when Mer, DC-SIGNR, or MGL was expressed. gene (GP)-mediated infection is enhanced by the TAM family members Axl and Tyro3 (61) the members of the C-type lectin family DC-SIGN and LSECtin bind Ebola virus particles and mediate viral entry (2, 23). the members of the C-type lectin family bind Ebola virus particles and mediate viral entry (2, 23). the titers of HIV-SARSSpike(Venus) and HIV-MLVEnv(Venus) were 1.5 105 IU/ml in ACE2-expressing cells and 1.6 106 IU/ml in mCAT-expressing cells. this results indicate that the four molecules Axl, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, and LSECtin enhance the susceptibility of cells to HIV and VSV pseudotyped with Lassa virus GPC cells were first incubated with virus particles and then washed to remove unbound particles. expression of Axl, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, or LSECtin, but not Tyro3, enhanced the binding of HIV-LaGPC(Venus) to Jurkat cells. DGFc5, a soluble form of DG fused with Fc, bound to HIV-LaGPC(Venus) particles, but DGFc1, a truncated form of DG (36), did not. binding of HIV-based pseudotype particles to soluble chimeric proteins was measured by using an HIV-1 p24 antigen ELISA. we performed the cell-based and Fc chimera-based binding assays using the Lassa VLPs to find out if results similar to those observed with the pseudotypes would be obtained. in the cell-based assay, Lassa VLPs bound to cells expressing Axl, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, or LSECtin to a greater extent than to control cells. the nonexistent or low binding of Lassa virus pseudotypes or VLPs to Tyro3-expressing cells was due to the low expression level of Tyro3. we constructed a series of Axl mutants that had various truncations in the extracellular region and an HA tag in a region proximal to the transmembrane domain. to measure the binding of the pseudotype virus to the Axl mutants, we performed cell-based virus binding assays Axl mutants with mutations in extracellular regions and HIV-LaGPC(Venus) binding and titers Axl varianta Level of detectionb Virus bindingc Titer ratiod Axl HA 100 100 100 Axl del1D 135 3 0 Axl 1D 419 38 46 Axl 1D2D 104 92 101. Axl delCT was detected at higher levels on the cell surface and bound to HIV-LaGPC(Venus) more efficiently than intact Axl. this mutation abolished the ability of Axl to confer HIV-LaGPC(Venus) susceptibility on cells. a tyrosine residue at position 821 in Axl is phosphorylated by the Axl kinase upon signaling (7). c The binding of HIV-LaGPC(Venus) particles to Axl mutant-expressing Jurkat cells was measured by using an HIV p24 antigen ELISA. ratios were calculated as (titer in mutant-expressing cells)/(titer in intact Axl-expressing cells) 100. similar experiments were performed with Tyro3 to understand its role in Lassa virus cell entry. extracellular regions and HIV-LaGPC(Venus) particles were fused to immunoglobulin Fc. soluble forms of Tyro3 mutants were detected only when both of the two immunoglobulin domains were present (Fig. 2F), indicating the importance of these domains. tyrosine kinases contribute to Axl- and Tyro3-mediated Lassa virus infection. genistein reduced the infectivity of HIV-LaGPC(Venus) more efficiently than that of HIV-VSVG(Venus) in both Axl- and Tyro3-expressing cells. DC-SIGN mainly recognizes high-mannose-type glycans. binding can be blocked by mannan, a polymer of mannose. mannan is one of its high-affinity ligands. LSECtin as a result of the recognition of the carbohydrate on its GPC by these lectins, leading to endocytosis mediated by the internalization signals of these C-type lectins. DG is not involved in the ability of Axl, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, or LSECtin to enhance the efficiency of Lassa virus infection. al antibody (MAb) IIH6C4 whose reactivity is dependent on O-mannosylation (16, 17, 46) failed to show a positive signal for Jurkat cells by flow cytometry or Western blotting. MAb 43DAG1/8D5 is specific for the cytoplasmic tail of DG. the low infectivity of Lassa GPC pseudotype viruses in Jurkat cells is probably due to the carbohydrate modification status of DG. an isotype-matched antibody (thin lines) was also used. effects of knockdown (KD) by shRNA for LacZ (shlacZ) (control) or shDG on the infection-enhancing effects of the four molecules indicated. fCD2 served as a control. DG knockout ES cells (clone B11) was used to express the molecules of interest. the plasmid transfection efficiency was reasonable with B11 ES cells. in this experiment, DG expression resulted in titers approximately 10-fold higher than those in control cells. soluble form of O-mannosylated -DG partially reduced HIV-LaGPC(Venus) infection in this cell line. however, DGFc5 (10 g/ml), a soluble form of O-mannosylated -DG, partially reduced HIV-LaGPC(Venus) infection in this cell line. four molecules, Axl, Tyro3, DC-SIGN, and LSECtin, are receptors for Lassa virus. they function as receptors independently of the known Lassa virus receptor DG (10) if a single cell coexpresses O-mannosylated DG, infection likely occurs via DG. studies with more-specific inhibitors will clarify the significance of tyrosine kinase activity in Lassa virus infection. genistein treatment simply results in the downregulation of Axl and/or Tyro3. a soluble chimeric Tyro3/Fc protein showed binding to Lassa virus pseudotype particles. a point mutation at amino acid position 59 of Axl, Glu to Arg, dramatically reduces ligand binding (58), we expressed the mutant (Axl E59R; already reported in reference 60) in Jurkat cells and used it to titrate HIV-LaGPC(Venus) no differences in virus titers were observed between Axl HA- and Axl E59R-expressing Jurkat cells. a DG ligand blocks the interaction between Lassa virus GPC and DG. however, it does not block the interaction between DG and DG. these findings strongly suggest the existence of an alternative receptor(s) for Lassa virus infection in Vero cells. sylation status of hepatocyte DG in cell culture may be different from that in vivo. we observed a positive signal in another hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) by using flow cytometry with the antibody. caution must be used in interpreting experiments designed to improve understanding of the molecular basis of Lassa virus tropism. DG is not involved in Lassa virus GPC-mediated infection. the cathepsin cellular proteases and the endosomal membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 are not required for Ebola virus infection."}
