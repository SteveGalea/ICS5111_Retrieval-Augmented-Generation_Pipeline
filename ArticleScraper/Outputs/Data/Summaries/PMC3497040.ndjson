{"summary": "arenaviruses are classified as segmented negative-sense RNA (nsRNA) viruses. they are closely related to other segmented nsRNA viruses belonging to Bunyaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae. the three virus families share basic features of the intracellular replication cycle. at least seven arenaviruses are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. at least seven are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. these viruses, except SABV, LUJV, and CHAPV, are included in the NIAID\u2019s Category A priority pathogens list. non-fatal Guanarito GTOV Venezuela Zygodontomys brevicauda Yes High Junin JUNV Argentina Calomys musculinus Yes High Latino LATV Bolivia Calomys callosus not reported Machupo MACV Bolivia Bolomys obscurus not reported Parana PARV Paraguay Oryzomys buccinatus not reported Pichinde PICV Colombia Oryzomys albigularis not both genomic segments have an ambisense gene organization. the L RNA (7 kb) encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the small RING finger zinc-binding protein (Z) the S RNA (3.4 kb) encodes the glycoprotein precursor protein (GPC) and the nucleoprotein (NP) arenaviruses use a cap snatching strategy to acquire the cap structures of cellular mRNAs. the SL structure has been proposed to stabilize the 3\u2019-termini of the viral mRNAs. the matrix protein Z exhibits a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on viral RNA synthesis. at least two viral proteins, NP and Z, have been proposed to modulate the host cell response to infection. NP is the most abundant viral protein both in infected cells and in virions. NP is involved in virus-induced inhibition of type I IFN signaling. a serological survey among patients admitted with a history of fever and missionaries that had experienced a febrile illness showed that LASV was also present in Ivory Coast, Mali, and Central African Republic. the notion that LASV was endemic in larger areas of West Africa was further supported by the results of an imported case of Lassa fever in Germany in 2000. studies addressing the importance of M. natalensis for the circulation of LASV in nature showed that newborn animals inoculated intraperitoneally develop persistent asymptomatic infection. no significant histopathological alterations were observed in these animals. a moderate chronic meningoencephalitis was observed in adult animals. the clinical disease begins as a flu-like illness characterized by fever, general weakness, and malaise, which may beaccompanied by cough, sore throat, and severe headache. the differential diagnosis of Lassa fever based on the presenting symptoms can be problematic due to the many other acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses circulating in west africa [58,59] viremia peaks between 4 and 9 days after the onset of symptomatic disease. patients who presented with viremia 103 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/ml on day of hospitalization had 3.7 times greater chance of survival than those admitted with higher levels of viremia. hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis, splenic necrosis, adrenocortical necrosis, mononuclear interstitial myocarditis without myocardial fiber necrosis, alveolar edema with capillary congestion and mild interstitial pneumonitis, lymph nodal sinus histiocytosis with mitoses, gastrointestinal mucosal petechiae, renal tubular spherical, hyaline, acidophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in cells near junction of zona reticularis and medulla. in most cases these cells appeared to be adrenocortical cells of the zona reticularis. in all examined cases adrenal necrosis was mild and 90% of the cells of adrenal cortex appeared viable. phase may represent late stage of viremic spread and early cellular injury. second phase, peak of Lassa hepatitis, is characterized by 20-50% necrosis of hepatocytes, widespread focal cytoplasmic degeneration and limited phagocytic infiltration. third phase, hepatic recovery, is defined by 10% of hepatocellular necrosis, absence of focal cytoplasmic degeneration and clear evidence of mitoses, which indicate liver regeneration experimental data obtained from a case of fatal Lassa fever imported into germany in 2000. the proinflammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN-) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) rose to extremely high levels shortly before death. however, in another study no elevation of both cytokine levels was observed in the examined fatal cases. neutralizing antibodies appear months after acute infection is resolved. the titers are often low, which may indicate constant stimulation of B cells due to low levels of virus persistence. some antibodies are highly LASV strain-specific, while others react with a broad range of arenaviruses. mice are highly resistant to peripheral routes of inoculation. guinea pigs develop asymptomatic infection upon inoculation with LASV. inbred animals have higher viral titers in all target tissues than outbred guinea pigs. terminally ill animals are viremic and contain virus in nearly every organ tested. viremia persisted in all animals for up to 28 days after infection. viremia persisted in all animals for up to 28 days after infection. the spleen and lymph nodes, myocarditis, acute arteritis, renal tubular necrosis and regeneration, chronic inflammation of the choroid plexus, ependyma, and meninges, and cerebral perivascular cuffing were also observed. viremia appeared between days 5 and 10 in all animals and increased progressively until the animals died. eritis with intraluminal mononuclear cell aggregates and mononuclear cell infiltration of the subendothelium and the pulmonary arterial wall accompanied by endothelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia. rhesus monkeys showed pathologic lesions similar to human Lassa fever. meningoencephalomeningitis, pulmonary vasculitis, systemic arteritis, and skeletal myositis were significantly aques is initiated with dendritic cells in the lymphoid tissues. aques progresses to infection of Kupffer cells in liver and parenchymal cells in liver and adrenal glands. hepatic necrosis associated with mild inflammation and hepatocyte proliferation, adrenal necrosis, lymphoid depletion, and interstitial nephritis."}
