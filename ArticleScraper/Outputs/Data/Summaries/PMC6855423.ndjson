{"summary": "4,079 LAIs resulting in 168 deaths occurred in the u.s. from 1930 to 1978. thereafter, Harding and Byers identified 1,267 LAIs resulting in 22 deaths. the causes in many cases of LAI have not been clearly identified in the past. in 2004, three researchers at Boston University developed tularemia after accidental exposure to F. tularensis supposedly due to their failure to comply with safety protocols [11]. Considering these accidental infections with SARS-CoV, B. anthracis and F. tularensis, laboratory workers should pay careful attention when handling pathogens. pathogenic microorganisms that pose a threat to public health are categorized into four risk groups according to the laboratory biosafety manual. tularensis subsp. tularensis is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacterium. it is classified into four subspecies (subsp. tularensis), holarctica, mediasiatica, and novicida. infection with subsp. novicida has only been detected in immunocompromised humans. tularensis subsp. tularensis SCHU S4 dried on acrylic, glass, polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. treatment with 1% PFA for 24 h failed to inactive infected cells. bacterial pellets were resuspended in CDM containing 10% glycerol and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. all procedures with regard to living bacterial cultures were performed in a BSL-3 facility in accordance with the regulations established by the NIID, Japan. inactivation by heat treatments Five microliters of F. tularensis SCHU P9 (average, 5.2 105 CFU) suspended in 100 L of deionized water, CDM, PBS or undiluted FBS was added to a 0.2 mL PCR tube. control samples were incubated at 94\u00b0C and 56\u00b0C using an astec thermal cycler PC-806 (Astec Co., Ltd., Fukuoka, Japan) five microliters of F. tularensis SCHU P9 was mixed with 100 L of deionized water, 10%\u201390% ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 100% acetone (Sigma-Aldrich), a mixture of 50% methanol and 50% acetone, 10% formaldehyde neutral buffer solution. the samples were serially diluted and cultured on Eugon chocolate agar plates at 37\u00b0C for 4\u20137 days. all samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 2 min at 4\u00b0C. after the bacterial pellets were resuspended in 100 L of CDM, the viable bacteria were counted. these experiments were conducted using four replicates. the pellets were suspended in 100 L of RLT buffer supplied in RNeasy Mini Kit. the pellets containing live bacteria were suspended in CDM. these experiments were conducted using four replicates. eria were heated at 94\u00b0C for 3 min and 56\u00b0C for 30 min. filtered using millipore PVDF Hydrophilic Millex-HV Sterile Syringe Filter Unit 0.45 Micron (SLHV033RS, EMD Millipore Corporation) and 0.22 Micron (SLGV033RS, EMD Millipore Corporation) the experiments were conducted in four replicates. the results are expressed as the mean number of CFU SD. bacterial pellets were resuspended in CDM containing 10% glycerol. all procedures with regard to living bacterial cultures were performed in a BSL-3 facility in accordance with the regulations established by the NIID, Japan. inactivation by heat treatments Five microliters of F. tularensis SCHU P9 (average, 5.2 105 CFU) suspended in 100 L of deionized water, CDM, PBS (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA) or undiluted FBS was added to a 0.2 mL PCR tube (Bio-Bik Ina Optica, Nagano, Japan) the control samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C five microliters of F. tularensis SCHU P9 was mixed with 100 L of 1% Triton X-100, 1% NP-40 and 1% LDS (Nacalai Tesque) buffer. the samples were serially diluted and cultured on Eugon chocolate agar plates at 37\u00b0C for 4\u20137 days. the average CFU number in 100 L was calculated from the average number of colonies of four replicated samples. detergents and bacteria were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 10 min, 1 h, and 24 h. all samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 2 min at 4\u00b0C. after resuspended in 100 L of CDM, the viable bacteria were counted. samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. the pellets containing live bacteria were suspended in CDM and the CFU was counted. these experiments were conducted using four replicates. teria were heated at 94\u00b0C for 3 min and 56\u00b0C for 30 min. filtered using millipore PVDF Hydrophilic Millex-HV Sterile Syringe Filter Unit 0.45 Micron (SLHV033RS, EMD Millipore Corporation) and 0.22 Micron (SLGV033RS, EMD Millipore Corporation) the experiments were conducted in four replicates. the number of live bacteria was approximately 1.2 106 CFU at 0 min. thereafter, no bacteria incubated at 4\u00b0C for 10 weeks (w), 23\u00b0C for 2 weeks or 37\u00b0C for 1 day (d) were detected. no significant change in the number of CFU was detected between 0 min and 1 h. 5.2 105 CFU/100 L of F. tularensis SHCU P9 were incubated at 94\u00b0C for 3 min and 56\u00b0C for 30 min. heat treatment at 94\u00b0C for 3 min and 56\u00b0C for 30 min completely inactivated. no viable bacteria were detected after incubation at 94\u00b0C for 45 s. heated at 94\u00b0C (C) and 56\u00b0C (D) for the indicating times in the figure were immediately cooled on ice for identical time periods. the white and black symbols indicate the CFU numbers of the treated and control samples. a sterilizing filter is often used to remove contaminating bacteria from liquid samples. (C to F) Bacteria suspended in 0%\u201390% ethanol (C and D), various solvents (E) and the final concentration of 0%\u20131% sodium hypochlorite (F) were incubated at room temperature for 10 min (C, E, and F) and 0\u201360 s (D) bacteria spiked into 10% formalin neutral buffer solution, 4% PFA, 100% methanol, 100% acetone, a mixture of 50% methanol/50% acetone and 100% acetonitrile were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. the viable bacteria in pellets resuspended in CDM were counted. all samples were centrifuged to remove the detergent solution. no sample was completely inactivated, although CFU numbers in samples treated with detergents were significantly lower than in the control samples.

Bacteria suspended in 0%\u201390% ethanol were incubated for 10 min at room temperature (23\u00b0C) then centrifuged to discard the ethanol solution. after treatment with >50% ethanol for 10 min, no viable bacteria were detected. there were no viable bacteria in any of the samples treated with organic solvents. the results showed that the final concentration of 0.1% sodium hypochlorite had sufficiently inactivated the bacteria. there were significant differences in bacterial viability between the treated and control samples. Bacteria suspended in CDM, undiluted FBS and RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS were homogenated. the mean CFU number SD was determined by two-way ANOVA. the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Ltd., Valencia, CA, USA) and the RLT buffer were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. there was an abundance of bacteria in the samples treated with Cell Lysis Buffer but none in the samples treated with the RLT buffer. the viability of F. tularensis SCHU P9 was evaluated after the treatment using cell signaling technology. F. tularensis SCHU P9 cells spread onto Eugon chocolate agar were completely inactivated by UV radiation at room temperature for 60 min. bacteria in undiluted FBS were completely inactivated by UV radiation at room temperature for 60 min. samples were detected after the treatments with 94\u00b0C for 3 min (Fig 7A black bars), 56\u00b0C for 30 min (Fig 7A gray bars), 0.22 m filtration (Fig 7B gray bars), 50% ethanol for 10 min (Fig 7C black bars), 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (Fig 7C gray bars) and UV radiation in deionized water. is is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, highly pathogenic and an intracellular bacterium. the results of the present study showed that F. tularensis SCHU P9 was readily and easily inactivated by heat treatments (94\u00b0C for 3 min and 56\u00b0C for 30 min) filtration using a 0.22 m filter and treatments with 70% ethanol, methanol, acetone, 10% neutral buffered formalin and 4% PFA solution. high concentrations of viable bacteria were detected in CDM for up to 10 weeks. viability of F. tularensis SCHU P9 suspended in deionized water was confirmed at 8 weeks at 4\u00b0C. incubation within 1 h did not affect viability of F. tularensis SCHU P9. heat treatment at 56\u00b0C for 30 min was sufficient to inactivate F. tularensis. semipermeable membrane filters with average pore sizes of 0.45 and 0.22 m are often used to remove bacteria, fungi, cells, aggregated proteins, and debris in liquid samples. UV radiation is classified as UVA (315\u2013400 nm), UVB (280\u2013315 nm) or UVC (200\u2013280 nm). UV light at 254 nm, which is near the maximum absorbance in DNA, can induce the accumulation of dimers between adjacent thymidine residues in the same DNA strand. virulent strain was initially isolated by Foshay from an ulcer of american patient in 1941. the strain was attenuated by 373 passages in artificial media over 30 years in Japan. the experiments were performed using bacterial suspensions. the samples were heated at 56\u00b0C for 10 min and then immediately cooled on ice. the black and white bars indicate the CFU numbers of the treated and control samples."}
