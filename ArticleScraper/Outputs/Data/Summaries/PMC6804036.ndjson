{"summary": "herbal medicine has been referred to as phytotherapy in some european countries. herbal medicine has been a part of ayurvedic medicine in india and Chinese traditional medicine (TCM) in china. herbal medicine has been referred to as phytotherapy in some countries. herbal medicine and TCM formulas have potential for both benefit and harm. orthodox western medicine therapy involves fitting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of a drug to the disease pathophysiology. this is not the case for orthodox western medicine. TCM is widely popular in East Asia and forms the Kampo medicine in eastasia. traditional medicines form the mainstream of healthcare in these countries. traditional medicines form the mainstream of healthcare in these countries. indications of A-physicians\u2019 Formulas A-physicians focus on the indication of a preformed TCM formula in medicinal textbooks. they start with one indicated formula, then add on or delete ingredients according to the symptoms, therefore the composition is relatively unchanged. however, clinical experiences of the past do not support management of infectious diseases. indications of R-physicians\u2019 Formulas R-physicians propose that diseases develop from disharmony between Yin and Yang or imbalance between Five Elements. orthodox medicine proposes that diseases develop from disharmony between Yin and Yang or imbalance between five Elements. A-physicians focus on the indication of a preformed TCM formula in medicinal textbooks. they start with one indicated formula, then add on or delete ingredients according to the symptoms, therefore the composition is relatively unchanged. antibiotics, but not A-physicians\u2019 formulas, can easily control acute endemic bacterial infection. complex interplay between active molecules of a TCM formula makes therapeutic responses unpredictable. complex interactions between active molecules of a TCM formula may be worsened when combined with therapeutic agents of orthodox medicine. effects of TCM formulas have been reported [11,12,13,14,15,16,17] that raise the safety issue of TCM formula. some A-physicians believe the side effects may come from the misuse of TCM formulas without fulfilling their indications. some patients respond well while others do not, while others show responses opposite to the in vitro pharmacological effects. different concentrations of active molecules support the unique pharmacokinetic profile based on individual genes. individual gene-based metabolism could be one of the major factors affecting the molecular mechanisms and subsequent clinical effects of TCM formulas. metabolomics integrative approach accepts a \u2018top-down\u2019 strategy to express the function of organisms through terminal symptoms of metabolic network. understanding the molecular mechanisms of a TCM formula requires analysis of the mechanisms of the TCM formula as a whole. understanding the molecular mechanisms of an active molecule can facilitate its development into an investigational new drug (IND) the more drugs used, the more adverse drug reaction (ADR) occurred. this is commonly caused by drug-drug interactions. interactions may be found between herb and drug, herb and food, herb and microbiome. the intakes of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages, containing baicalin and rutin, might compete with the binding site of calcium channel blockers on human serum albumin to affect their clinical effects. baicalin and rutin will increase the binding affinity of curcumin on human serum albumin to change its bioavailability. liquiritin, glycyrrhizin, amygdalin, prunasin, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and methylephedrine can be found in RSV pneumonia-infected rats vis-\u00e0-vis normal rats. there are highly complex interactions between herbs and drugs, foods, herbs, microbiome, and diseases, and most of these complex interactions are not completely discovered or remain unseen. metabolomics have been considered a powerful tool in diagnosis and treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. the Xiang-Fu-Si-Wu formula has been demonstrated to affect some significant perturbations in sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism as well as steroid hormone biosynthesis. understanding the molecular mechanisms of a TCM formula can help validate its traditional use and avoid its misuse and side effects. plants harvested in different seasons might contain variable amounts of active molecules thereby affecting their activities. confirmation of its authenticity is the cornerstone. fingerprints of the active molecules are needed to confirm the authenticity of a plant or a formula and to confirm the amount of active molecules. interactions may be found between herb and drug, herb and food, herb and food, herb and microbiome, and even between herb and disease. interactions between S. baicalensis and drugs are found due to baicalin affecting metabolic enzymes of drugs, displacing plasma protein binding, and regulating various transporters involved in the pharmacokinetics of drugs. berberine and baicalin are coexisting molecules of the combination of S. baicalensis and Coptidis chinensis. berberine, but not baicalin, can increase glucose consumption. foods have been reported to modify the intestinal microbiome. airway viruses infect epithelia, produce inflammation, induce immune response, and cause symptoms. five formulas of A-physicians will be used as examples against airway infections. Ge-Gen-Tang has been reported to be effective in the treatment of common colds, chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and pneumonia. uralsaponins from Glycyrrhiza uralensis [54] and procyanidin from Cinnamomum cassia [55] may effectively inhibit the replication of the influenza virus. paeoniflorin, a major constituent of Paeonia lactiflora, exerts anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects by balancing the function of Th1/Th2 [50] glycyrrhizin suppresses nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, inhibits the production of nitric oxides (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE Cinnamaldehyde, from Cinnamomum cassia, inhibits the secretion of PGE2, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and the activation of NF-B to show the anti-inflammatory effect. e-cinnamaldehyde down-regulate NO and TNF- production to show anti-inflammatory activity. cinnamaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, 2-methoxy cinnamaldehyde, 6-methoxy cinnamaldehyde Ephedra sinica Stapf 4.5 Aerial part Ephedrine, L-ephedrannin, ephedrannin A and B, pseudoephedrine alkaloid, flavonoids, and organic acids Glycyrrhiza airway viruses infect the epithelium to cause tissue injury. ge-Gen-Tang contains several active molecules to inhibit viral replication. the indication to use MHT is patients with chills, fever without sweating, headache, shortness of breath, and joint pain. clinically, MHT can effectively reduce fever and flu symptoms, including myalgia, headache, arthralgia, fatigue and cough in patients with seasonal influenza type A.

Molecular mechanism of Ye-Gan-Ma-Huang-Tang against airway viral infections. several active molecules inhibit viral replication and signal transduction of inflammatory response. a specific gene or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) largely affects the pharmacokinetic profile. may a specific gene be prone to a specific ADR of a TCM formula or herbs. may these inactive ingredients be omitted? there is a wrong perception that a naturally derived product is relatively safe. but evidence-based research in the field of CAM therapies is still limited. it is highly important to identify both usefulness and safety of CAM and integrate these health approaches with orthodox medicine. MXGST, Ge-Gen-Tang (GGT), and Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang (XQLT) are among the top ten most common TCM prescriptions for patients with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in Taiwan. without tough clinical evidence and clear molecular mechanisms, physicians tend to avoid herbal therapies. some herbal treatments containing aristolochic acid (AA) can cause AA nephropathy requiring renal replacement therapy. AA is associated with urothelial cancers [132] the mechanisms of these interactions can be divided into molecular mimicry and pharmacologic interactions. for pharmacokinetic interactions, several herbs naturally has coumarin or salicylate analogue that may potentiate the bleeding risk of warfarin and salicylate. for pharmacokinetic interactions, Ephedra sinica (Ma huang) should not be used with sedative or anti-hypertensive agents. many diseases can be triggered by oxidative stress under high levels of ROS/RNS. these diseases include cancer, inflammation, and degenerative diseases. blocking the generation of ROS/RNS might prevent and/or manage these diseases. studies published in Chinese are usually not translated into English. the terminology of TCM is also difficult to translate, particularly those used by R-physicians. education of herbal medicine and TCM has been neglected worldwide, except in Germany and china. herbal therapies are based on bench studies that do not possess external validity to support their conclusions. using animal-derived cancer cell lines to study antiviral effects in humans; using cancer cell lines to study physical changes; using intraperitoneal injection to study oral medications. complex interactions are not Fully Understood TCM formulas have numerous bioactive compounds to form a kind of cocktail therapy. however, the amounts of each bioactive compound in herbs and TCM formulas are very low. this may raise questions about the likelihood of interactions with others during administration in a decoction. dra sinica should not be used with sedative or anti-hypertensive agents. herb-drug interactions may be individualized, e.g., in combination with warfarin, Panax ginseng may cause thrombotic event [20], bleeding [21,22], or neither [23]. Currently, most of the molecular mechanisms of these identified interactions are not fully understood. there are insufficient data to establish the ability of TCM to decrease ROS/RNS levels and establish its effects on the disease. however, much work remains to be done to validate such claims of benefits of herbal medicine and TCM."}
