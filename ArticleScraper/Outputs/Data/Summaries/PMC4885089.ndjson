{"summary": "the first description of recombinant DNA techniques, many advances have been achieved in the field of molecular biology and genetic modification. the genetic modification of viruses has become one of the best strategies for introducing nucleic acids into different cells, tissues or even in in vivo models. this review aims to highlight the main aspects of the genetic modification of VACV and the generation and application of reporter-expressing virus. VACV have a complete replicating cycle inside the cytoplasm of the host cell, even though it is a DNA virus. this fact determines the genetic characteristics of the virus, being completely independent of the replication and transcription machinery of the host cell. this replication cycle is an appropriate model for molecular and genetic investigations of cis and trans factors that are mainly required for gene expression. in some cases, patients treated with retroviral vectors have developed cancer years after they have been treated. recombinant viruses are produced by homologous recombination inside the infected cell. the recombinant viruses are produced by homologous recombination inside the infected cell. this method allows the introduction of site-directed mutations into the VACV genome. the presence of the protein encoded by gpt allows the recombinant viruses to grow in the presence of mycophenolic acid, xanthine and hypoxanthine. after this first metabolic selection, a second recombination event must occur to eliminate the selection marker, maintaining the mutation introduced into the VACV genome. puromycin resistance could be used as a selection marker in TDS, increasing the recombinant viruses\u2019 generation efficiency. recombinant viruses can be easily recognized by their disability to bind erythrocytes in a hemagglutination test [35,36,37]. the diagram of the VACV genome with the HindIII restriction sites is shown. the TK gene is the most common site of insertion in the VACV genome. some authors have used temperature-sensitive VACV strains, allowing the recombinant viruses to be selected in culture at 40 \u00b0C. the most common way for easy identification of recombinant viruses is the use of reporter genes as selectable markers. reporter genes commonly used in the generation of recombinant vaccinia virus. CAT is an enzyme from Escherichia coli that detoxifies the antibiotic chloramphenicol. CAT is an enzyme from Escherichia coli that detoxifies the antibiotic. CAT can be detected either by thin-layer chromatography, autoradiography or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) there is a strong link between CAT gene transcript levels and enzymatic activity, which is easy to quantify. CAT has become a suitable reporter gene for investigating transcriptional elements in a wide variety of experiments implicating animal and plant cells. lacZ gene can be stimulated with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) lacZ is used to detect -galactosidase activity in immunological and histochemical experiments. other uses include the selection of transformed bacterial colonies. chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-glucuronide (X-Gluc) can be used as substrates. they lead to a fluorogenic or blue product after cleavage. the most known fluorescent protein is green fluorescent protein (GFP) firefly luciferase oxidizes the D-luciferin, in the presence of oxygen and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the energy source. the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes and flavin mononucleotides (FMNH2) in the presence of oxygen to yield green-blue light. the VACV genome has about seven known insertion sites where foreign genes can be inserted. the recombinant viruses are able to grow in the presence of 5-bromo-2\u2019-deoxyuridine (BrdU). the VACV growth factor gene (VGF) is located in both inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) [39]. some strains of VACV have only one copy of VFG, such as the VACV Lister variants. the TK gene is the most common site of insertion in the VACV genome. reporter gene is located downstream of a viral promoter to study biological pathways or fused with other viral or foreign genes. reporter genes have additional applications in vitro and in vivo, as the reporter gene acts as a substitute of the gene of interest. reporter genes commonly used in the generation of recombinant VACV. Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase CAT was the first reporter gene used in transcriptional assays in mammalian cells. CAT is an enzyme from Escherichia coli that detoxifies the antibiotic chloramphenicol. this gene is not found in eukaryotes, so eukaryotic cells do not present any basal CAT activity. -galactosidase catalyzes the cleavage of the disaccharide lactose to form glucose and galactose. it can hydrolyze substrates such as ortho-nitrophenyl beta-galactoside (ONPG), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) and 3,4-cyclohexenoesculetin beta- the -glucuronidase protein catalyzes the breakdown of complex carbohydrates. this reporter gene system has been widely used in transgenic plants. it has also been successfully used in mammalian cells for VACV recombinant virus selection. luciferases are enzymes that catalyze a chemical reaction resulting in the production of light. they catalyze the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes and flavin mononucleotides (FMNH2) in the presence of oxygen to yield green-blue light. the use of luciferase is extremely widespread in biological systems studies. it includes cell proliferation assays, protein folding/secretion analyses, in vivo imaging and control of in vivo viral spreading. the main advantage of using this system is its high sensitivity when compared to other systems such as CAT. -galactosidase catalyzes the cleavage of the disaccharide lactose to form glucose and galactose. it can hydrolyze substrates such as ortho-nitrophenyl beta-galactoside (ONPG), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) and 3,4-cyclohexenoesculetin beta- lacZ is used to detect -galactosidase activity in transfected eukaryotic cells. other uses are the visualization of the -galactosidase expression in transfected eukaryotic cells. the use of fluorescent proteins allows a variety of applications: cell lineage tracker, reporter for gene expression assays or measure of protein-protein interactions. one limitation of using GFP is its low sensitivity [66], another is that its signal cannot be exogenously amplified [50]. the luciferase identified in bacteria (luxCDABE operon) catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes and flavin mononucleotides (FMNH2) in the presence of oxygen to yield green-blue light. the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes and flavin mononucleotides (FMNH2) in the presence of oxygen to yield green-blue light. the lacZ gene has been used mainly for the selection of recombinants. several studies have reported the different transgenes\u2019 insertion points and VACV promoters. these studies are essential for improvement of the development of vaccines based on recombinant VACV. the most common uses of recombinant VACV in vivo are the production of prophylactic vaccines and treatments against cancer. the most common uses of recombinant VACV in vivo are the production of prophylactic vaccines and treatments against cancer [4,85]. the recombinant VACV expresses the rabies virus glycoprotein and has been used to vaccinate raccoons, red foxes, skunks and coyotes in the united states and the united states. this battle has successfully purged rabies in some parts of the u.s. and the united states [91].
