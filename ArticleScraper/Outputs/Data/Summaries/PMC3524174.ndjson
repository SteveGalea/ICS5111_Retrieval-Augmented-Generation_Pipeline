{"summary": "a convenient animal model of HCV infection will greatly facilitate the development of an effective HCV vaccine. a convenient animal model of HCV infection will greatly facilitate the development of an effective HCV vaccine. a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus (VV), we generated three recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVVs) that encoded one of three different HCV proteins. one recombinant virus (rVV-N25) resolved pathological chronic hepatitis C symptoms in the liver. cDNA was cloned downstream of the CAG promoter, neomycin-resistant gene (neo) and poly A (pA) signal flanked by two loxP sequences. the transgene was almost fully recombined in transgenic mouse livers 7 days after poly(I:C) injection. CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice analyzed serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver HCV core protein levels after poly(I:C) injection. ALT levels increased and reached a peak at 24 h after the first poly(I:C) injection. this elevation appeared to be a direct result of the poly(I:C) treatment, which causes liver injury. rVVs can express a variety of proteins and induce strong and long-term immunity. each rVV encoded a different HCV protein; rVV-CN2 encoded mainly structural proteins. rVV-CN5 encoded the entire HCV protein region. blood, liver, and spleen tissue samples were collected 7 and 28 days after poly(I:C) injection. sections stained with H&E, silver, oil-red-O, or PAS. treatment with rVV-N25 induced the same effect in other strains of HCV transgenic mice. rVV-N25 reduced the HCV core protein levels in the mice. rVV-N25 reduced the HCV protein levels in the mice. rVV-CN5 encoded HCV structural and non-structural proteins did not show any significant effects. it may be important to exclude the HCV structural proteins (aa 1\u2013541) as antigenic proteins when developing therapeutic vaccines against chronic hepatitis C. serum ALT levels were not significantly different in the rVV-N25-treated mice and control mice. this finding indicated that rVV-N25 treatment did not cause liver injury. we analyzed the core protein levels in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice immunized with rVV-N25 in the absence of CD4 or CD8 T cells. as expected, the mice lacking CD4 or CD8 T cells failed to show a reduction in HCV core protein levels. the steatosis score of rVV-N25-treated mice was significantly lower than that of control mice. rVV-N25 Immunization Induced an NS2-specific Activated CD8 T cells Response Because HCV protein reduction in the liver required CD8 T cells, we performed a CD107a mobilization assay and intracellular IFN- staining. rVV-N25 treatment increased the frequency of HCV NS2-specific activated CD8 T cells. the ratio of CD8+IFN-+ cells to all CD8 T cells for rV-N25-treated mice was significantly higher than that for mice treated with any other rVV. rVV-N25 immunoization affected serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice. inflammatory cytokines were responsible for liver pathogenesis in the transgenic mice. inflammatory cytokines were responsible for liver pathogenesis in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice. inflammatory cytokines were responsible for liver pathogenesis in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice. inflammatory mediators played a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis. we neutralized TNF- and blocked the IL-6 receptor in the livers of these mice. rVV-N25 treatment affected the number of macrophages, cytokine production by macrophages. rVV-N25 treatment appeared to suppress activated macrophages. results showed that rVV-N25 had a suppressive effect on activated macrophages. this suppression ameliorated the histological indicators of chronic hepatitis. the transgene was almost fully recombined in transgenic mouse livers 7 days after poly(I:C) injection. most hepatocytes expressed the HCV core protein within 6 days after injection. infiltrating lymphocytes (arrows) were observed on days 6 and 180. expression of HCV proteins caused chronic hepatitis in the CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice because a weak, though persistent, immune response followed an initial bout of acute hepatitis. a number of pathological changes were observed in these mice. V-N25 encoded nonstructural proteins and rVV-CN5 encoded the entire HCV protein region. rVVs can express a variety of proteins and induce strong and long-term immunity, they have been evaluated as potential prophylactic vaccines. rosis in the four groups of CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice 7 days after inoculation. histological evaluation of steatosis in the four groups of CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice. treatment with rVV-N25 reduced the HCV core protein levels in the Livers. rVV-HCV immunization had a dramatic therapeutic effect on both types of HCV transgenic mice. H&E staining and immunohistochemical analysis for HCV core protein in the LC16m8-, rVV-CN2-, rVV-CN5-, or rVV-N25-treated CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice 28 days after the inoculation. the reduction in the levels of HCV core protein in rVV-HCV-treated mice was not caused by cytolytic elimination of hepatocytes that expressed HCV proteins. the recombined transgene was similar in rVV-N25-treated and control mice 28 days after immunization. the steatosis score of rVV-N25-treated mice was significantly lower than that of control mice. the steatosis score of rVV-N25-treated mice was significantly lower. splenocytes from immunized mice were co-cultured with EL-4CN2 or EL-4NS2 cell lines for 2 weeks and analyzed. rVV-N25 treatment increased the frequency of HCV NS2-specific activated CD8 T cells. rVV-N25 induced CD8 T-cell degranulation, a marker for cytotoxicity, and IFN- production. the ratio of CD8+IFN-+ cells to all CD8 T cells was significantly higher than that for mice treated with any other rVV. inflammatory cytokines increased in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice. immunization with rVV-N25 suppresses serum inflammatory cytokine levels. in wild-type mice, cytokine levels remained unchanged after immunization. CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) and CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) were the main producers of TNF- and IL-6 in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice following poly(I:C) injection. immunoization with rVV-N25 reduced the number of macrophages in liver samples. macrophages produced small amounts of TNF- and IL-6 during continuous HCV expression in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice. those in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(+/) mice produced much larger amounts of these cytokines. rVV-N25 treatment appeared to suppress these macrophages. transgenic mice develop tolerance to the HCV protein. this mouse model relies on conditional expression of the core, E1, E2 and NS2 proteins. the injection of an Ad-Cre vector increased the frequency of HCV-specific activated CD8 T cells in the liver of these mice and caused liver injury. poly(I:C) injection caused hepatitis in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(/) mice. serum ALT levels in CN2-29(+/)/MxCre(/) mice increased, reached a peak one day after injection, declined from day 1 to day 6. this time-course indicated that poly(I:C) injection alone did not induced continuous liver injury. rVV-N25 treatment in the absence of CD4 and CD8 T cells had no effect on HCV clearance. this important observation indicated that rVV-N25-induced HCV clearance was mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells. this important observation indicated that rVV-N25 treatment effectively induced the accumulation of NS2-specific CD8 T cells. the rVV-CN construct included the core and envelope proteins. core-specific CTL activity is present in transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV structural proteins. however, only the core protein suppressed vaccinia-specific CTL responses. pathological symptoms in the HCV transgenic mice were completely blocked by intravenous injection of TNF- and IL-6 neutralizing antibodies. the progression of chronic hepatitis depended on inflammatory cytokines in serum, rather than the HCV protein levels in hepatocytes. both cytokines contribute to the maintenance of hepatosteatosis in mice fed a high-fat diet. rVV-N25 reduced the number of macrophages, but precise mechanism is still unknown. rVV-N25 immunization can be used for prevention of HCV infection and as an antiviral therapy against ongoing HCV infection. xCre(+/) mice were induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic acid\u2013polycytidylic acid. 300 L of a poly(I:C) solution was injected three times at 48-h intervals. all animal care and experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines established by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science Subcommittee on laboratory animal care. pBR322-based plasmid vector pBMSF7C contained the ATI/p7.5 hybrid promoter within the hemagglutinin gene region of the vaccinia virus. each cDNA was inserted into a separate pBMSF7C vector downstream of the pBMSF7C ATI/p7.5 hybrid promoter. the final designation of each plasmid was pBMSF7C-CN2, pBMSF7C-N25, GraphPad Prism 5 for Macintosh (GraphPad) was used for all analyses.
