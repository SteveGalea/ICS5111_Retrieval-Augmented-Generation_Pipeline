{"summary": "vRNAs form viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs), where vRNAs are coated with multiple subunits of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) vRNAs are used as templates by the viral polymerase to synthesize two positive-sense RNA molecules, the complementary RNAs (cRNAs), and the mRNAs for viral protein synthesis. coding capability of the viral genome is extended by encoding multifunctional proteins that act at different steps during virus infection. each viral segment contains non-coding regions (NCR, black) and the packaging signals (PKS, gray) at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 termini in each of the viral segments. matrix 2 (M2) protein is also found in the viral membrane. in the viral envelop, there is an inner shell composed of the matrix 1 (M1) protein, which interacts in the virion with the vRNP and the HA and NA proteins. NEP is also located in the virion and may interact with M1 in the viral particle. ISG encodes two proteins, the polymerase component PA and PA-X. PA-X modulates host inflammation, immune responses, apoptosis, and virus pathogenesis. IAV are divided into multiple subtypes, based on the HA and NA glycoproteins. the effectiveness of current vaccination approaches is suboptimal [16,31,32,33,39,40,41,42,43,44]. concerns associated with IAV are further aggravated by the adaptive capacity of the viruses to infect new hosts or escape to the immune system. vaccines have to be reformulated yearly to guarantee that the viral glycoproteins in the vaccine match seasonal viruses circulating worldwide. IFNs are mainly recognized by the endosomal, membrane-associated PRR Toll-like receptors 3 (double-stranded RNAs, dsRNAs) or 7/8 (ssRNAs), respectively [50,51] by the cytoplasmic PRR retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which detects dsRNA and 5\u2032- triphosphates of the negative ssRNA viral genome [50,52], by the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and Janus protein tyrosine kinase 1 (JAK1) critical for phosphorylation. STAT1 and STAT2 associate with IRF-9 forming the heterotrimeric ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. this heterotrimeric complex then translocates to the nucleus, and binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) located in the promoters of ISG adaptive immune responses initiated upon innate immune activation are required for protection and viral clearance. NLRP3 is expressed by myeloid cells such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells [71] or by human bronchial epithelial cells [72]. the complement system is an important branch of innate immunity that plays an essential role in the clearance of pathogens. spontaneous hydrolysis of native C3 results in the formation of C4bC2a (C3 convertase) the three pathways converge at the cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b by C3 convertases (C4b, 2a and C3b, Bb) then, the C3b molecules formed bind covalently to the C3-convertases that cleave C5 into C5a and C5b. SNPs affect a single nucleotide or base pair and they are one of the most frequent types of genetic variations in the genome. they need to be presented into the population with a frequency equal to or greater than 1% to be considered as polymorphisms. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a variation on a single nucleotide. an SNP is a variation on a single nucleotide which may occur at some specific point in the genome. genetic significance and function for most of the SNPs found in the human genome remain unknown. vRNAs form viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs), where vRNAs are coated with multiple subunits of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and are associated with the heterotrimeric polymerase basic 2 and 1 (PB2 and PB1) and acidic (PA) proteins. vRNAs are used as templates by the viral polymerase to synthesize two vRNAs. the small IAV genome encodes for up to 16 viral proteins through multiple mechanisms, although there are some differences between strains. the coding capability of the viral genome is extended by encoding multifunctional proteins that act at different steps during virus infection. neuraminidase protein mediates virus entry by binding to sialic acid-containing cell receptors and then fusing endosomal and viral membranes during endocytosis. the matrix 2 (M2) protein is also found in the viral membrane, although in much lower abundance than HA or NA glycoproteins. NS1 is a multifunctional protein and a key viral factor that counteracts the host antiviral responses. NS1 has been shown to inhibit the production of interferon (IFN) and the processing and nuclear transport of host mRNAs causing cellular shut-off. seasonal vaccines have to be reformulated yearly to guarantee that the viral glycoproteins (HA and NA) in the vaccine match seasonal viruses circulating worldwide. avian H5, H7, and H9 subtypes eventually cross the species barrier to infect humans. IAV RNAs are mainly recognized by the endosomal, membrane-associated PRR Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 (double-stranded RNAs, dsRNAs) or 7/8 (ssRNAs), respectively [50,51], by the cytoplasmic PRR retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which detects dsRNA and 5\u2032- triphosphates of the negative ssRNA viral genome type I and III IFNs signal through different receptors in a paracrine or autocrine way to induce the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) cytokines contribute to proliferation and migration of different immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells to the infected tissue. cytokine signaling improves dendritic cells (DC) maturation. adaptive immune responses initiated upon innate immune activation are required for protection and viral clearance. complement system is an important branch of innate immunity that plays an essential role in the clearance of pathogens. complexes activated after the classical and lectin pathways, cleave C4 and C2. spontaneous hydrolysis of native C3 results in the formation of C3b-like C3 that binds factor B and after cleavage by factor D forms the initial C3 convertase. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect a single nucleotide or base pair. they are one of the most frequent types of genetic variations in the genome. there are multiple types of SNPs, depending on their location. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be synonymous if they do not produce an amino acid change (silent mutation) or non-synonymous changes can be divided into missense or nonsense (producing a truncated or longer protein) the biological significance and function for most of the SNPs found in the human genome remain unknown. the scientific community recognizes the importance of this kind of genome variations that can act as biological markers. this kind of variations can act as biological markers and assist researchers in multiple aspects. c.991G>T occurred in the final nucleotide of exon 7. disrupted the essential splice site at the boundary of exon 7 and intron 7. c.577+1G>T, was localized in the donor splice site of introns 5 and 6. 1143627, located 31 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site, on the IL-1B promoter. the nucleotide change is located in a TATA-box motif of IL-1B. multiple pieces of evidence have suggested that IL-1A and IL-1B play relevant roles in innate immunity against viral infections. galectin-1 Recognizes galactose-containing oligosaccharides present in the cellular plasma membranes and in viruses, such as IAV. deletion of Tmprss2 in mice impairs the spread of H1N1 influenza viruses, including the pH1N1. a study of 51 italian children diagnosed with IAV H1N1 infection identified an additional TLR3 SNP (rs5743313, genotype C/T) this TLR3 SNP was found in all the children developing IAV-associated pneumonia (18 cases). however, the SNP was found in significantly less proportion in children with milder disease, suggesting a link between TLR3 and IAV pathogenicity. a patient with severe IAV H1N1 infection during the 2009 swine flu pandemic showed two heterozygous variants (one in each chromosome) p.R71H (SNP rs72710678) and p.P885S (SNP rs138425677), located in the caspase activation domain (CARD) and RNA binding domains of RIG-I. these variants significantly decreased the recognition function of RIG the rare allele A of two IRF-7 SNPs, rs12272434 and rs12290989, were significantly associated with impaired levels of IFN production by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells. these polymorphisms may affect the ability of humans to control HIV-1 infections, reinforcing the role of IRF-7 in controlling viral infections. IRF9-deficient cells showed a profound defect in inducing the expression of multiple ISGs. the antiviral protein IFITM3 abrogates the release of IAV content from late endosomes into the cytoplasm. mice in which expression of IFITM3 is abolished showed severe disease after IAV infection. CC genotype found in 25% of Chinese patients showing mild disease after pH1N1 virus infection compared to 69% in patients developing a severe pH1N1 virus infection. CC genotype was estimated to confer a six-fold increased risk for severe infection than the CT and TT genotypes. the risk allele disrupted a CpG site that becomes differentially methylated in CD8+ T cell subsets. the risk allele disrupted a CpG site that becomes differentially methylated in CD8+ T cells in the airways during natural influenza infection in the carriers of the risk allele. the SNP rs17561 introduces a nonsynonymous mutation (A114S) in IL-1A protein, suggesting that this genetic variant may lead to a functional variation in host susceptibility to pH1N1. a minor allele (A) at position -238 of TNF (SNP rs361525) was more frequent in Greek patients infected with pH1N1 virus compared to control subjects [130], and developing pneumonia was more uncommon in Greek and CCR5 mediates leukocyte chemotaxis in response to its ligands, including MIP-1a, MIP-1b, and RANTES. it can help direct multiple immune cell subsets, including regulatory T cells or Th17 cells to sites of infection. homozygosity for the CCR5-32 allele prevents its expression on the cell surface. the polymorphism rs2564978 in gene CD55 was linked to disease severity in adult Chinese cases of avian (H7N9) and human pH1N1 IAV in another study [100]. the effect of this SNPs on gene expression and function is undescribed. galectin-1 knockout mice showed increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection than wild-type mice. a genome-wide association study was performed to study human genetic susceptibility to avian IAV H7N9 infection. SNPs in genes that influence the IAV Vaccine Response Currently, IAV vaccines are the main strategy to prevent IAV infection, though their effectiveness is suboptimal in many cases. factors such as previous exposure to IAV infections or vaccines, age, and the closeness of the match between the vaccine and circulating strains are important to explain differences in vaccine effectiveness. a cohort of HLA-typed donors at risk was investigated. a correlation between HLA class II alleles and IAV HAI titers was found. a positive association between non-responsiveness to influenza vaccine and HLA-DRB1*07 and a negative association with HLA-DQB1*0603-9/14 [154] was reported. SNPs from three genes, IL-6 (rs1800796), IL-12B (rs3212227) and IL-1R1 (rs3732131) revealed links with IAV H1N1-induced antibody responses in an allele dose-related way. a variant GA for non-synonymous SNPs within the IL-12 receptor gene (rs2307153; D465G) and TNF receptor 2 gene (rs5746026; K232 IIV [156] TNFRSF1A Cytokine receptor involved in inflammatory and immune responses. IIV [156] IL-10RB Cytokine receptor that mediates the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway leading to the expression of ISG. IIV [165] IL-28B (IFNL3) Type III IFN molecule, with brad functions in antiviral responses rs8099917 (NCR). IIV: inactivated seasonal vaccine. IL-6, interleukin 6. IL-12B, interleukin 12. IFN-B1, interferon beta 1 (IFN). the presence of the T/G or G/G genotype (rs8099917, minor-allele) in IL-28B (IFN3), a type III IFN, was linked with increased seroconversion in recipients of an inactivated influenza vaccine. authors also reported that the IL-28B rs8099917 polymorphism affected humoral responses to the IAV vaccine. current research and data reflect the importance to obtain a better understanding of these relations and the mechanisms underlying the effect of SNPs in the human immune system. in the future, this knowledge could be used to better understand host factors affecting viral replication and disease severity."}
