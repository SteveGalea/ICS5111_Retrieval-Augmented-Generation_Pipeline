{"summary": "simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) has caused lethal outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in captive primates. the virus was detected directly from blood plasma using pyrosequencing, without prior virus isolation and with minimal PCR amplification. the two new SHFV variants, SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 are highly divergent from each other (51.9% nucleotide sequence identity) agic fever virus (SHFV) was discovered during an \"explosive\" outbreak of hemorrhagic disease in rhesus macaques in 1964 [1]. sporadic epidemics have occurred in macaques, likely as a result of contact with, or iatrogenic transmission from, infected but asymptomatic captive african monkeys [2], [3], [4]. the clinical manifestations of SHFV resemble those of other prim two novel and highly divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single male red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) from Kibale National Park, Uganda. the discovery sheds new light on the natural history and diversity of SHFV. however, it is unclear whether the unusual 3\u2032 genomic architecture of SHFV is typical. a wild adult male red colobus in Kibale was captured as part of a larger study of primate ecology, health, and conservation. the animal was anesthetized with a combination of Ketamine (5.6 mg/kg) and Xylazine (1.7 mg/kg) the animal was given a reversal agent and released after recovery back to its social group without incident. the eluted RNA was treated with DNase I (DNA-free, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and double stranded DNA was generated using the Superscript double-stranded cDNA Synthesis kit. DNA was purified using the Agencourt Ampure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) thermocycling conditions included cDNA synthesis at 50\u00b0C for 30 min and denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min. a similar sequence gap at the 3\u2032 terminal open reading frame of one contig was filled by 3\u2032 RACE according to manufacturer's protocol. phylogenetic analyses were conducted on concatenated, non-overlapping regions of aligned, cleaned ORFs. alignments were concatenated, and uncorrected percent sequence identities for the resulting full-length coding genomes were calculated using the computer program MEGA4 [14] a wild adult male red colobus in Kibale was captured as part of a larger study of primate ecology, health, and conservation. the animal was anesthetized with a combination of Ketamine and Xylazine (1.7 mg/kg) administered intramuscularly using a variable-pressure air rifle. blood was drawn from the femoral vein into an evacuated plasma collection tube. the animal was given a reversal agent (Atipamezole, 0.6 mg/kg) and released after recovery. samples were shipped in an IATA-approved dry shipper to the us. raw sequences were first screened to remove redundancy using Galaxy software. the remaining reads were then imported into CLC Genomics Workbench. singleton and assembled contiguous sequences were queried against the GenBank database. first-strand cDNA synthesis with an oligo(dT)-containing adaptor primer was performed at 42\u00b0C for 50 min. followed by amplification of target cDNA with platinum Taq DNA polymerase. abridged universal amplification primer (5\u2032 GGCCAGGCGTCGACTAGTAC) DV, and PRRSV (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, with reference to the EAV genome) were compiled from the literature. strains chosen from available full-length genome sequences to represent the known within-species diversity of each virus. de novo assembly of singleton non-host reads resulted in a 15.5 kb contiguous sequence (contig) that aligned to the SHFV type strain LVR 42-0/M6941. two additional contigs with lengths of 13 kb and 1.9 kb also aligned to the SHFV genome. SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 both possess two large putative replicase-encoding ORFs and several smaller downstream ORFs. both new viral genomes contain homologs of the type strain SHFV ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3 in same genomic positions. a ORFb LVR krc1 krc2 LVR - krc1 LVR - krc2 - krc2 1a 2105 2048 1978 39.7 40.6 40.1 1b 1491 1464 1485 57.8 58.1 59.3 2a 281 232 223 28.6 34.2 32.3 2b 204 220 202 37.3 30.5 38 3 205 194 166 29.5 32.5 SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 are highly divergent from each other and from the type strain SHFV LVR 42-0/M6941. the degree of phylogenetic diversity within SHFV is remarkably high and approximately equal to that between PRRSV and LDV. phylogenetic tree of newly discovered simian hemorrhagic fever viruses and other arteriviruses. novel variants SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 are highlighted. both new viruses contain homologs of the type strain SHFV ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3 in the same genomic positions. phylogenetic analysis of SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 demonstrate the diversity of SHFV to be higher than has been documented for any other arterivirus. no instance of co-infection of a single primate host with such highly divergent arteriviruses has previously been reported. however, it is also possible that SHFV-krc1 or SHFV-krc2 may have been transmitted to this animal from another species. b, and 3, which are not present in the other arteriviruses. the unique 3\u2032 genomic architecture of SHFV in comparison to the other arteriviruses is authentic and characteristic of SHFV. future studies of isolated viruses should clarify stability of SHFV in cell culture."}
