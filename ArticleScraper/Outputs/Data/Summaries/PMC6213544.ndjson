{"summary": "ebolaviruses are single-strand RNA filoviruses that can induce a high mortality in some hosts, including apes and humans. the different ebolaviruses have caused localised but dramatic human outbreaks in the last 40 years. the recent west africa outbreak gave an outline of the pandemic potential of these pathogens. some mammal species played a major role in triggering human outbreaks. apes such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes and P. t. verus) and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) were at the origin of several human outbreaks. EBOV PCR positive duiker carcasses (Cephalophus sp.) have also been found. several bat species are needed to create a maintenance community for EBOV. each bat species cannot complete EBOV maintenance alone. if it exists, it is known that it can transmit ebolaviruses to some bat species. no EBOV replicative strain has been isolated from healthy wild bats. the main hypotheses for EBOV maintenance are a single bat species as Rousettus aegyptiacus is considered the maintenance host for marburg virus. there is still a possibility that bats are not part of or that non-bat species are involved in the EBOV maintenance system. alternative scenarios should be considered and explored. bats are not the maintenance host for EBOV or bat species are involved with alternative host(s) in the maintenance community. current data and knowledge support both scenarios. bats are sometimes in contact with the virus and experience waves of exposure during outbreaks. the range of potential transmission pathways available to infect bats seems to be much more limited. for example, bats seldom use the ground floor: transmission routes requiring direct contact or environmental transmission on the ground do not expose bats. in other terms, direct contact with strictly ground-dwelling animals would be very unlikely. tree-canopy cave roof Feeding Roosting - Vector feeding habit (blood meal) to identify vector feeding host range, including bats. EBOV screening in vector populations [61,62,63,64,65] Food-borne (insects) Open air surface water Feeding Drinking - Genetic screening of prey species in bat guano- EBOV screening in vector populations. EBOV and other filovirus particles seem to be able to persist for at least 90 min as aerosol. experimental airborne transmission of EBOV between animals from different species, e.g., from pigs to non-human primates, also seems possible. experimental airborne transmission of EBOV between animals from different species, e.g., from pigs to non-human primates. studies on mosquito blood meals have revealed that mosquito could feed on bats and other mammals. this specificity would preclude interspecies pathogen transmission. ectoparasitism provides a solid source of indirect contacts between the alternative maintenance host and bats. bats actively search for prey in many different habitats hosting hematophagous insects that feed on habitat-specific fauna. insectivorous bat diet analysis could indicate the relative proportion of hematophagous insect fed upon by bats and their identity. the probability of infection will depend on the capacity of the virus to survive in the environmental conditions available in the specific habitat. EBOV and filoviruses have been shown to persist for some time (3 to 7 days) in the environment, depending on the biotic and abiotic conditions. in addition, EBV can be shed in some bat faeces [22] and have been cultured from human urine and saliva. this transmission route is therefore possible, but restrained to the fauna feeding at same height as bats. the upside-down vertical position of bat roosting does not favour disease transmission from an alternative host. for bat species roosting in tree-holes, the situation can be different as they can share temporally or directly their nest space with other animals. if bats are not the maintenance hosts for EBOV then there is only a limited number of candidate species to play the role of alternative maintenance hosts. the observation of this limited number of hosts calls for testing them, even if only to exclude them from the list of hypotheses. the hypothesis of human playing a role in ebolavirus maintenance has not been addressed here. a lot of sampling of potential alternative hosts has been undertaken during ebolaviruses outbreaks. investigations should also target the same and other alternative hosts during inter-outbreak periods with ecologically driven hypotheses. this is what is currently done for bats following the main maintenance hypothesis (e.g., [30]), but not often for alternative hosts. behavioural ecology could inform and help targeting protocols. chimpanzees and monkeys can feed at the same height as bats. camera trap protocols could inform host interactions networks. the ecology of EBOV and its maintenance system can be expected to be complex, ecosystem dependent and dynamic due to global changes. aiming at this moving target will require out-of-the-box thinking."}
