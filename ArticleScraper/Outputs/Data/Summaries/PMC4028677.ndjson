{"summary": "a 19 bp mutation in tcdC, the repressor of toxins A/B, is associated with hypervirulent North American pulsotype 1 strains that were proportionally most prevalent across British Columbia during a one-month period in 2008. the 2013 proportion of NAP1 strains in Vancouver Island is 30.6% less than that in 2008, while t. the isolates were identified as part of the 2012 CNISP CDI surveillance. the patient had been hospitalized for 118 days prior to the CDI. cdC association and susceptibility remain the same. the clinical relevance is unknown, but spread of a strain with an elevated VAN MIC would be globally disastrous. further studies are underway to examine the mechanisms explaining the elevated VAN MIC. 69 of the 235 hospital sites reported 1 VRE-B, totalling 361 VRE-B(s) from 2009 to 2013, 69 of the 235 sites reported 1 VRE-B. 45 of the total were incorrectly reported (12%). a point-prevalence survey of MRSA, VRE, and CDI was performed in adult inpatients at Canadian acute-care hospitals with 50 beds. information was also obtained regarding institutional characteristics and IP&C policies of each participating hospital. clinical trials in IPAC are difficult to conduct but possible. a total of 239,475 stool samples were analysed retrospectively. a total of 239,475 stool samples were analysed retrospectively. acetate concentration and a Kinyoun-hematoxylin stained slide were performed on all samples. an additional 8655 commercial pinworm paddle samples were received for Enterobius vermicularis. CANWARD is an ongoing national surveillance study that assesses pathogens causing infections in patients attending hospitals. Candida species isolated from bloodstream infections were collected from 12 participating medical centres during the 2013 study period. the prevalence and MIC distribution of CA and CP candidemia have not significantly changed over several years of CANWARD surveillance. however, there was a significant increase in the number of CG isolates and rate of antimicrobial resistance in these isolates. nineteen isolates (3%) of A fumigatus had non-WT VORI MICs (2 mg/L to 4 mg/L), up from 0.7% in 2012. 84% tested only one dilution above the ECOFF. nine genotypes identified from 78 cases: A (vaccine), C, D, F, G, H, I, K and N. measles and rubella genotypes reflect importation from endemic regions and verifies elimination status in Canada. newly detected 2013 isolates were closely related (99.8%) to the WNv isolated four years ago in neighbouring states, WA and OR. this suggests that this strain may already be established in the Pacific Northwest. number were repeated 30 times each on the COBAS\u00ae. 20 of 30 replicates with 140 cp/mL by in-house PCR were called 150 cp/mL. at low copy numbers, a weaker correlation was identified. a singleplex SG-rtPCR with melting curve analysis was developed and optimized. cNPCR primers for rotavirus G (VP7) and P (VP4) typing were used in this study. sensitivity of SG-rtPCR was comparable to cNPCR. the new SG-rtPCR assay is a fast, sensitive and specific method for rotavirus genotyping. the methodology is easy to perform and has minimal risk for PCR end-product contamination. a stepwise algorithm targeting the most common G and P types will reduce reagent and labour costs. profiles A1 to A7 were closely/possibly related subtypes of Profile A. all non-\u2018A\u2019 cases were fim3A genotype. cases were reported in all zones, with the South Zone reporting the highest rates. LP serogroup-1 (LPS-1) with respiratory infection; 2) symptom onset on/after November 1, 2012; 3) resided/visited/worked in a 2 km radius of an inner city neighborhood 2 weeks prior to symptom onset. all cases were administered CDC\u2019s Legionellosis Hypothesis-Generating Questionnaire. this study describes an LP1 ST222 outbreak in a Calgary neighborhood temporally associated with construction. unusual factors include prior low LP incidence, seasonality and ST. OBJECTIVE(S): Genetic determinants of virulence in Escherichia coli and their association with diseases such as hemolytic uremic syndrome remain largely unknown. efa2, ent, espG, espJ, espK, espM1, espM2, espN, espV, espW, espX7, katP, nleA, nleH1-1, nleH1-2, terE, toxB and ureD were significantly more prevalent in clinical than in cattle non-O157 strains. the development of HUS seems to be dependent on age-associated factors. eight of 181 isolates had a mutation in the inhA gene (4.4%) katG and inhA promoter accounted for 89.5% of INH-associated mutations. twenty-three of 23 RMP-resistant isolates (100%), 45 of 48 PZA-resistant isolates (93.7%) and 14 of 15 EMB-resistant isolates (93.3%) had mutations associated with drug-resistance in rpoB, pncA and embB gene respectively the occurrence of human MDR-AmpC varied from 9.1% (n=16 of 175) in 2003; 1.5% in 2009 (n=2 of 136); 6.6% in 2012 (n=9 of 137). a total of 354 isolates from food/animal sources underwent susceptibility testing; 108 (30.5%) were MDR-AmpC. whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out using miSeq (Illumina) and phylogenetic analysis was conducted using bioinformatics pipelines. PFGE analysis of MDR and susceptible isolates from both animals and humans lacked discriminatory power. a commercial DNA microarray system can genetically determine the serotype designation of a known Salmonella isolate. a total of 471 Salmonella subsp. enterica isolates were serotyped by conventional methods. 406 isolates had a complete antigenic formula and serovar determined. four single day audits were conducted by the antimicrobial Stewardship Program. patients had to be on at least one antimicrobial to be included in the audit. the most common reason for suboptimal therapy was duration too long. iuria (ABU) does not require treatment in the majority of patients. we aimed to identify risk factors for inappropriate antibiotic use. 97 (59.9%) of positive urine cultures were inappropriately treated with antibiotics. a decision tree model was used to perform cost-consequence and sensitivity analyses to determine the financial impact of incorporating fosfomycin as a treatment option. most (96.1%) of the potential variation in cost was associated with the probability of progressing to pyelonephritis (55.8%), hospitalization for pyelonephritis (35.9%), and contracting an infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole the probability of pyelonephritis surpassed 3.2% and probability of hospitalization due to pyelonephritis surpassed 15%. fosfomycin is comparable in cost to other reimbursed antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: To determine antimicrobial resistance trends for cephalosporins and azithromycin. use of higher 800 mg dose of cefixime increased from 5% to 8% (2006 to 2011) to >50% (2012 to 2013), ceftriaxone increased from 2% to 11%, and co-treatment with azithromycin increased from 18% to 26%, to >50%. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate surveillance programs against a rubric of surveillance system characteristics and attributes. the main Canadian public health programs CNISP, CIPARS and CBSN performed well in 12 of 22, 11 of 18, 20 of 29, and seven of 21 of 21 of 21 of attributes judged to be potentially within scope. 10 recommendations for reorganization of existing resources and gradual expansion of AMR-AU surveillance in Canadian jurisdictions will be released. three P-T resistant non ESBL E coli isolates were not clonal, by PFGE analysis. the FN protocol is being changed with discussion of the relative merits of aminoglycosides and carbapenems. at counts of 1.2106 CFU/mL, 1.7107 CFU/mL and 3.5108 CFU/mL, respectively, was applied as 7 cm2 spots to textured armrests, seat topside and seat underside. seeding experiments revealed the presence of moderate-heavy growth of VRE and E fecalis on the seat underside plus arm-rests and light growth of CD from all cultures. human blood samples were prepared by spiking bacterial and fungal cells to whole blood collected from healthy volunteers. one millilitre of blood was transferred to a sample pre-treatment tube containing reagents for selectively lysing blood cells. microbial cells in whole blood can be detected and identified using molecular methods without involving nucleic acid extraction techniques. established real-time PCR assays specific for 36 respiratory and enteric pathogens was adapted for nanofluidic detection using the Fluidigm BioMark HD. the nanofluidic method adaptation included a combined onestep reverse-transcription and pre-amplification process to streamline workflow. four hundred consecutive respiratory samples received in the microbiology lab were tested using both assays. for the RealStar assay, extraction, amplification and detection are performed in the self-contained Disc. for discrepant results, a fresh aliquot of the original sample was sent to altona Diagnostics for repeat testing using the same kit version as well as a new version with a different target region. for RSV, a third independent assay was also used. the emergence of a new pandemic strain can be challenging for laboratories. the real-time RT-PCR was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of all norovirus genotypes currently circulating in Canada. the two end-point RT-PCRs displayed poor analytical sensitivity. a total of 9435 (98.8%) specimens had no evidence of HIV infection. pre-seroconversion AHI cases were not detected by 3rd gen EIA. all EIAs and PNAT detected all individuals with early sero-conversion AHI. gen EIAs demonstrated improved sensitivity for AHI diagnosis compared to 3rd gen EIAs. Specificities were high for all three EIAs. test is a useful strategy to identify AHI in settings with high rates of HIV infection. seroprotection to H1N1 was lowest (20%) in young children 5 years of age and highest (30%) in school-aged children and elderly adults 70 years of age. seroprotection to H3N2 showed a similar peak in school-aged children and elderly adults 70 years of age. seroprotection to H3N2v peaked (60%) in adults 20 to 39 years of age. 10 had detectible titres 10, of whom three had titres 20, and all were 60 years of age. broad susceptibility to the virus suggests it would pose a threat if adapted for efficient human-to-human spread. sixty samples did not grow from Uriswab; 56 did not grow from BD. nineteen uropathogens were isolated from Uriswab and 16 from BD. pooled broth enrichment results (gold standard) were compared to the results from the direct PCR assay (Eswab) and Chrom agar (Eswab and rayon swab) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV are as follows. qPCR duplex is a replacement for the commercial geneProbe Accuprobe TM hybridization assay currently in use in the mycobacteriology laboratory. sensitivity and specificity of the primers were assessed by conventional PCR against 206 known mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial isolates. 98% of the ITS amplicons were successfully sequenced in-house using the primers of park et al with identification matching that of hsp65. 83 mitis group isolates, including 14 isolates referred to the reference lab for serotyping, were tested by our real-time PCR assay. 68 of the 83 isolates submitted were unable to be identified at the species level by biochemical and 16S rDNA testing. a suspension of B pertussis at 0.5 McFarland (1.5108 CFU/mL) standard was subject to a serial 10-fold dilution series from 1.5108 CFU/mL to 1.5102 CFU/mL. 200 L was inoculated onto each of three swabs, one ACTM and two VTM collection vials, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 24 h. BD Canada has introduced a rapid immunochromatographic assay for the identification of MTBC directly from liquid culture. eighty-eight MTBC and 28 NTM cultures (representing 11 species) were tested using the TBcID assay, real-time PCR and the TBcID kit (BD) real-time PCR provided accurate results for 88 of 116 cultures. TBcID assay was able to provide 97.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity. there is no specific identification of NTM that might be present in the culture. nearly all were susceptible to daptomycin and linezolid. >85% of isolates were susceptible to rifampin, tetracycline, gentamicin and meropenem. using a multiplex PCR assay targeting carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae genes, extended-spectrum -lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC -lactamases was completed on NDM-1 K pneumoniae and E cloacae isolates from 2008 to 2013 from four hospitals. PFGE and NDM-1 plasmid fingerprinting were also carried out on a subset of isolates. a total of 227 perianal swabs were accessed in a retrospective blinded fashion using the B-LACTATM test directly from perianal swabs or swabs that were soaked in Tryptic soy broth (TSB) for 4 h at 37oC. the reagents were added to the swab directly or to broth-soaked swabs and incubated of 5 min to 15 min at room temperature. a total of 500 rectal swabs for VRE surveillance were inoculated in parallel to Oxoid Brilliance VRE, Bio-Rad VRESelect and Colorex media. a total of 50 VRE isolates were detected at 24 h, 36 h and 48 h. Oxoid Brilliance and Bio-Rad VRESelect performed better at 36 h than 24 h incubation. however it had more breakthrough growth of suspicious colonies that proved not to be VRE. seven of seven S boydii reacted blue and one of one reacted red in Reagent-2. two reacted reproducibly with Reagent-1 blue latex (suggesting S flexneri) both were E coli by VITEK 2 GNI, API 20E, and were non-reactive with Remel Shigella anti-sera. a total of 858 VRE screens were inoculated onto Oxoid Brilliance chromogenic VRE directly (B) the incubated broths were also subcultured onto Brilliance VRE plates (+B) the incubated broths were also subcultured onto Brilliance VRE plates. pre-analytical interactions, reagent and sample preparation and loading, in-process, post-analytical and maintenance hands-on times were measured for 96 and 192 tests. there was no amplification inhibition. lamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2 and L3 is now endemic in MSM in canada. diagnosis of LGV requires genotyping of all suspected chlamydia-positive cases. 70% of gonorrhea cases are diagnosed by NAAT in canada yearly. there is no antimicrobial resistance data available. novel methods to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae would aid in surveillance and treatment recommendations. RT-PCR assay has high sensitivity and specificity to known antimicrobial resistance markers. it is hoped we will be able to adopt this assay from NAAT specimens in our national surveillance program. 119 strains consisted of 39 N gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence types (NG-MAST, ST) that grouped into nine phylogenomic clades labelled A\u2013I. all 13 Clade B isolates had low MICs. Isolates in Clades G, H and I (n=8) had moderate ceftriaxone MICs 0.008 g/mL to 0.032 g/mL. penA mosaic genotype represented 51% (n=65) and penA type XXXIV was most predominant (n=60) public health policy makers and practitioners may benefit from easy access to ND information that is jurisdiction specific and comparable. OBJECTIVES: PCV7 vaccination resulted in declines in IPD due to PCV7 serotypes (STs), but increases in IPD due to non-conjugate vaccine STs. 19A (four of 28, 14%) and 22F (four of 28, 14%) were the most common STs. incidence of PCV13/not7 ST IPD decreased from 14.8 per 100,000 per year to 1.6 per 100,000 per year. in 2012/2013 56% of PCV13 ST cases occurred in VEC. hepatitis E antibody testing was performed on a subset of 4000 donors using the Wantai HEV IgG ELISA. out of 3071 donors tested for HEV and anti-HEV, there are zero HEV PCR positives and 95 of 1773 donors tested for anti-HEV positive. 133, 81 and 12 patients tested positive for RV, NV, and SV. baseline risk of fever was 44.4% (95% CI 33.6% to 55.2%), 4.7% (95% CI 0.2% to 9.3%) for dehydration. retrospective cohort study of adults admitted to four hospitals. ninety-five patients were identified; nine excluded. main outcomes were length of stay (LOS), need for intensive care (ICU) or mechanical ventilation (MV), and all-cause mortality. non-O157 Escherichia coli infections are difficult to identify using current culture approaches. a chromogenic culture medium for non-O157 E coli was evaluated. a total of 1151 stools were cultured on a chromogenic selective medium. Stool culture using STEC medium led to isolation and screening of many suspect colonies. stx PCR identified non-O157 STEC infections in seven patients. the current CDC recommendation is to screen all stools submitted for enteric pathogen detection for Shiga toxins. enriched sample pools were 14.88 to 38.58 and 12.83 to 34.92. pooling of pre-enriched specimens resulted in a loss of test sensitivity. but all positive samples were detected with minimal Ct changes. the survival rate of O157, clinical and cattle non-O157 STEC dropped to 18%, 4% and 5% respectively. PCR was positive for 51 individual patient samples, of which 69% were non-O157 serotypes. EIA was performed on 175 CGM-positive isolates, of which 44 were PCR-positive. on these, EIA sensitivity was 95.5%, and PPV was 100%. together, the CGM-EIA sensitivity and specificity were 89.8% and 100% respectively. sporadic cases have decreased from 0.91 cases per 100,000 per year in 2007 to 0.48 cases per 100,000 per year in 2013. intriguingly, the rate of HUS and TTP reported is rising since 2009. other non-O157 STEC serotypes may be responsible for the increase. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether co-administrations of antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents may improve survivals of influenza virus H5N1 infected animals. survival, body weight, histopathology, inflammatory markers, viral loads, responses to neutralizing antibody were documented in infected mice. there is growing interest in the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genetic diversity and clinical outcomes. there is growing interest in the role of Epstein-Barr virus. the biological form of CMV DNA in plasma (virions versus free DNA and fragmented versus unfragmented DNA) is uncertain. an assay combining DNase I digestion and CMV-QPCR was developed to differentiate CMV free DNA from encapsidated virions in plasma. the log10 (copies/mL) result difference was 0.52 and 0.57 between two Taqman and two SYBR assays. the size of the amplicon may result in quantitative bias and variability in CMV DNA QNAT assay results. NK cells expressing KIR2DL2 or KIR3DL1 were significantly lower at EOT 24 weeks after therapy. exhausted B cell subsets were significantly lower at EOT. however, increased after viral recurrence in relapsers. lack of HCV specific response is associated with increased HCV specific immunity. a total of 420 specimens from individuals with established HIV infection were tested to investigate false recency rate (FRR) RESULTS: Biorad exhibits a higher rate of recent infections within four months when compared to Sedia. a seroprevalence survey for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi was conducted from June to august 2012. a convenience sample of residual sera submitted for diagnostic testing was used. a total of 1855 sera were submitted and screened. of these, 215 (11.6%) were sent to the NML for further testing. a total of 161 serum specimens were tested using PAB Lyme EIA (Mikrogen) that uses three recombinant proteins. results were compared with our current C6 peptide ELISA kit (Immunetics) and those performed by immunoblot (IB) at NML. primer and probe (PP) mixes were prepared in large volume and dispensed into two sets of 8-strip tubes. sample extracts were mixed with QuantiTect RT mastermix (Qiagen) PP mixes were then added to 16 wells of a 96-well plate. PCR reactions were performed simultaneously in an ABI7500 instrument. 73 pathogens were identified by our in-house PCR panel. the cost of the in-house assay is 75% lower than the commercial assay. a PRNT was developed by CDC previously described methods. 87 NP swabs were positive for viruses: influenza (24%), RSV (14%), coronavirus (32%), rhinovirus (17%), human metapneumovirus (9%) and parainfluenza (5%). high senescent CD8 T-cells were associated with increased risk of infection. -cells were not associated with increased risk of infection. high CD8 TD and senescent T-cells were predictive of reduced risk during the ensuing influenza viral season. OBJECTIVE: Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) has been shown to have higher sensitivity and specificity than non-amplification methods. three samples were found to be CT positive by NAAT with confirmation and CT negative by DFA. follow-up of these patients confirmed consistent clinical findings. real-time PCR is known to be more sensitive than DFA. a retrospective chart review was performed for patients with discordant results between the two PCR targets and/or DFA. of 143 specimens tested, 125 were negative for PJ by PCR. four specimens were negative by mtLSU rDNA and had Ct values >36. 422 clinical samples were blindly tested in parallel by duplex and 4-plex qPCR. this resulted in decreased turnaround time (TAT) and labour and consumables costs. the 4-plex qPCR assay is as least as sensitive as the two-tube duplex. swabs from various anatomical sites were evaluated by HSV-Qx and HSV-LC. discordant results were resolved using a third commercial molecular method. HSV-Qx showed a slight reduction in specificity for HSV-1 at 98.6%. PCR results were compared with those of virus detection by electron microscopy and latex agglutination antigen detection. real-time reverse transcription-PCR resulted in 111% increases in the rates of detection of rotavirus A compared with latex agglutination testing. the most coverable HPV genotypes in this round were 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, 58 and 70. the patients who were infected with high-risk HPV were younger than the rest. sensitivity and precision were comparable in all four methods. 90% were concordant including noV (n=32), RV (n=26), AdV (n=31), AsV (n=18), SaV (n=10), mixed viruses (n=4) and negative (n=60). MP-PCR and TP-PCR were highly specific, but their LoDs were less sensitive than the screening PCR assays. TP-PCR identified an additional 19 types in specimens that had low bacterial loads due to its increased sensitivity. a large proportion of Spn-positive specimens remained untypeable. a total of 5282 N gonorrhoeae were submitted to the NML between 2008 and 2012. antimicrobial susceptibility was performed to eight antimicrobials using agar dilution. NG-MAST sequence typing was performed on all isolates from 2010\u20132012. antimicrobial susceptibilities and sequence types of N gonorrhoeae are needed to inform treatment guidelines and mitigate the impact of antimicrobial resistance in gonorrhea. penemase activity in one Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate identified as carbapenemase-negative by PCR. MALDI-TOF MS can detect carbapenemase activity with high specificity/sensitivity. it has greater sensitivity than the Carba-NP assay. VMS found all 814 BP-coloured isolates to be E coli. all 282 CPS E coli were BP (CPS BP-sensitivity [Sn] 100%. 10 of 280 (3.6%) UTI E coli were \u2018cream-translucent\u2019 (CR) 98.6% of MB and 98% of MY with an associated ID from VMS produced correct ID with high confidence. only 0.2% of all ID were incorrect with high confidence. 305 ENT included 35 (11.5%) 3GC-susceptible (S) and 270 (88.5%) 3GCR. ENT included two C freundii, eight E aerogenes, 44 E cloacae, 89 E coli, 12 K oxytoca, 129 K pneumoniae, six M morganii, five P mirabilis, one P stuartii, four R ornithinolytica, five S marcescens. 153 BLT were performed on 103 (66.9%) EC, 37 (24%) KP, five (3.3%) KO, eight (5.2%) PR. twenty-two (14.3%) were BLT+ (red), 131 (85.1%) BLT-negative (yellow) and one (0.7%) BLT-indeterminate (IND) ESBL EC (seven CTX-M, four TEM/SHV), seven A-ESBL KP (four CTX-M, three TEM/SHV), two A-ESBL KO (two CTX-M), two KO K1/OXY] the single BLT-IND and four of the 131 (3.1%) BLT-negative isolates were 3CGR due to Class C -lactamases. Isolates naladixic acid, ciprofloxacin, naladixic acid, naladixic acid and ciprofloxacin. the addition of nalidixic acid disk diffusion did not detect any additional isolates. 102 suspensions were inoculated to a blood agar plate for colony count. a pair of glass and plastic media bottles stimulated with human blood before loading into BACTEC instruments. time for detection and morphology of growth of each organism was also monitored. essential agreement (EA) and categorical agreement (CA) were compared to BMD using CLSI M100-S23 breakpoints. most MICs in EA were either in exact agreement or one dilution lower than BMD for AMX, MER, and PEN. 26% of isolates tested two dilutions lower than BMD for CRO. ciprofloxacin-containing media detected CR-E from rectal swabs. nine (18%) of the swabs grew CR-E (all E coli with ciprofloxacin MIC 4 g/mL) the media failed to identify a resistant organism in which only one colony grew on an Alere plate. ninety-three sequential unselected clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were screened for potential ESBL production using ESBL Plus panels between November 2010 and October 2012. the BIOMIC V3 provided accurate turbidity readings and interpretations of MicroScan ESBL Plus panel results. ESwab preserves better than M40 at 22\u00b0C, and may be accepted after up to 48 h transportation. Swabs transported at 4\u00b0C may lose fastidious organisms by 24 h. the OD method is in line with the 100uL volume the CLSI M40A document recommends. the other absorption method saturates the entire swab with 1.0 mL of water or serum. results of the OD method are in agreement with those of SEM, RT or the RT methods. RADTs failed to detect some patients with serious complications of GAS pharyngitis. RADTs failed to detect a substantial number of adult patients with significant GAS pharyngitis that can benefit from treatment. non-pathogenic bacteria were isolated in 16 of 27 versus 12 of 27. two of the rejected specimens grew significant pathogens from SP. a total of 3516 isolates were collected: 41.3%, 38.8%, 10.5% and 9.4% from blood, respiratory, urine and wound/IV site specimens. resistance rates for E coli were 0% for meropenem (MER), ertapenem (ERT), gentamicin (GEN), 10.9% ceftriaxone (CTR), 21.8% ciprofloxacin (CIP), 25.8% trimethoprim/sulfame antibiotic exposure and decreased stomach acidity are well recognized risks for CDI. no resistance was observed in MRSA with VAN, LZD, TGC or DAP. SSTIs (30.2%), suspected urinary tract infections (11.9%) and suspected C difficile infections (10.3%). a reduction in utilization conferring an estimated cost savings of $8,500. the prevalence of fully expressed ESBL, AmpC and CPM in the Okanagan region of British Columbia from 2010 to 2013 was consistent throughout the study period. increased in 2012 (4.25%; P=0.109) and 2013 (4.125%; P=0.173), notably due to an increase in OP ESBL prevalence. fully expressed AmpC is twice as common as ESBL in the Okanagan region. from 2008 to 2012, the proportion of ESBL+ GNB rose significantly from 3.8% to 11.3% (P=0.003, 2 test for trend) ESBL+ E coli had reduced susceptibility to A/S, CFT, CAX, CAZ, CPE, CP and LVX compared with ESBL-negative isolates. an average of 221 patients were reviewed for each of the four audits. a third of these patients were receiving antimicrobial therapy. serial spot audits are a novel approach to measure the appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy. cip-R coliforms were identified in 60 of 293 (20.5%) of patients. cip-R organisms were isolated from 11 of the self-collected versus 13 of the nurse-collected swabs. proportions of TST and IGRA agreement were analysed for those in/outside the borderline zone (TbAg-Nil 0.20 IU/mL to 1.00 IU/mL) 170 (30.9%) cases were classified as low-risk and had both IGRA and TST induration values for analysis. CW smears were examined under light and fluorescent microscope. culture, performed using standard mycological media, was used as a gold standard for determining the sensitivity and specificity of each staining method. the rate of growth was similar for the three media. growth of bacteria was 4.2%, 9.3% and 7.2% respectively. the first 13 cases of human infection in HIV-infected patients were recently described in south africa. emmonsia brain abscess, had no prior medical history. five patients (19%) had a history of proven TB. all patients had disseminated disease at presentation. the results were interpreted using CLSI M27-S4 guidelines for AND, FLU, MF and VOR. AB \u2013 MICS showed 19 MD compared with both VTK and SENS for a CA of 59%. POS \u2013 MICS showed 3 MD compared with SENS for a CA of 93.5%. AND \u2013 MICS showed 2 mD and 1 MD for a CA of 93% compared with SENS. VORI concentrations were verified externally by a reference laboratory. six of seven sites used liquid chromatography-based methods. one used a bioassay site and the lowest concentrations. 71-year-old female had history of hypertension, coronary artery disease and stage III serous ovarian cancer. she was allergic to penicillin, streptomycin, sulfa and flagyl. she denied any symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria or diarrhea. leclercia adecarboxylata is a rare pathogen to cause bacteremia mostly in immunocompromised patients. she was discharged home after seven days of hospital stay. she was given botulinum antitoxin prior to laboratory confirmation. well owners are responsible for the bacteriological potability of their drinking water. current literature is lacking in private well water submission information. 80% of well owners did not meet current Ontario guidelines in any given year. instructors can make games to review lectures and by asking students to complete the game of the day, get good feedback about potential problems. individual student performance on game questions is one parameter useful for identification of students who need more attention. a major useful function of the game system is the ability to make a quiz game and receive an item analysis on individual multiple choice questions. 14 (26.4%) patients treated with tigecycline expired. four of 11 patients treated with HAP/VAP, two of three (66%) with C.difficile infection, three of seven (43%) with endovascular infection, three of 14 (21%) with cIAI, one of one with an infected prosthetic joint and one of three (33%) with sepsis. 62 (8%) were CT positive, 32 (52%) symptomatic and 30 (48%) asymptomatic. the frequency of MICA*008 allele was higher in control group than patients infected with CT (P0.05) prospective study provided data for 5236 patients from six hospitals in Quebec and Ontario studied over 15 months from 2006 to 2007. a total of 212 (4.05%) patients were colonized with CD on admission, and 5024 patients were not. 73.5% of isolates demonstrated a MDR phenotype. four were associated with PMEN clones Taiwan19F-24, Spain23F-1, Spain9V-3 and England14-9. outpatient parental antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has become a common practice. there is no clear Canadian standard of care with regard to discharging intravenous drug users from hospital with intravenous (IV) access. most physicians surveyed have discharged IVDUs from hospital with IV access for antibiotic administration. all putative isolates were characterized by PCR and sequencing. PFGE and phylogenetic grouping were carried out to assess clonal spread. the prevalence of ESBL-EC increased significantly between 2007 and 2012. salmonella isolates were serotyped and colonic contents underwent PCR-based screening for E coli intestinal pathogenicity genes. of the 397 rats, 15 were positive for Stx 1, Stx 2, and eae. nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are an increasingly recognized cause of chronic otomastoiditis in children with tympanostomy tubes. there are no previous reports of topical boric acid as a therapeutic option for this infection. chronic otitis due to NTM is difficult to treat with combination systemic antibiotic therapy. topical boric acid powder has been shown to be effective in chronic otitis media caused by typical bacterial pathogens. no studies have evaluated trends in -hemolytic streptococci (HS) in north America. a total of 19,864 positive blood cultures were identified. a total of 1025 (5.16%) episodes of bacteremia attributable to HS were identified. HS causing oro-pharyngeal infection may reduce workload and cost. OBJECTIVES: Chromogenic agars may reduce workload and cost. no study has compared efficiency between products. mean total cost per specimen for identification only was $3.97 (95% CI 3.51 to 4.42) for BM, $2.94 (95% CI 2.67 to 3.21) for Alere, and $2.53 (95% CI 2.23 to 2.82) for BD. influenza complicated by bacterial pneumonia is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. the mecA gene was detected most often in the ICU group in nine of 80 (12%). it was detected eight of 80 (10%) of ward patients, four of 86 (4.7%) outpatients and six of 90 (6.7%) patients in the respiratory virus negative group. OBJECTIVE: C difficile shedding is most prominent during diarrhea. a screening OCMC questionnaire was administered at all hospitals in a large health region in a large health region in 2012 and March/April 2013. direct hospital and laboratory costs associated with a screening and pre-emptive isolation (PreIso) program were excluded. a retrospective study assessed the impact of mandatory ID consultation for SAB in a Canadian setting. there were 128 SAB cases in 2011 and 124 in 2012. the majority were methicillin-susceptible (97 of 128 [75.8%] and 100 of 124 [80.6%], respectively) nosocomial gram-negative bacteremia in critically ill patients is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. AB led to an increase in ID involvement, a significant decrease in time to ID involvement, and better adherence to IDSA guidelines. a total of 119 organisms were sub-cultured onto CLX and set up directly to Vitek 2\u00ae (bioM\u00e9rieux) automated susceptibility testing (AST) panels. each AST result was compared to the SUC AST result and categorized as total agreement (TA), minor disagreement \u2013 mD (no change in report), major disagreement \u2013 MD (clinically significant change in report) 1 VMD were seen giving a TA of 99.6% for PA. overall TA for all AB/organism combinations in this study was 99.2%. VE of RV vaccine was 75.0% for a one-dose, 91.7% (95% CI 60.8 to 85.7%) for a 1-dose, and 92.3% (95% CI 81.7 to 97.4%) for a two-dose regimen. traumatic splenectomy had the highest vaccination rates overall (30%). in-patients known to carry methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) typically kept in contact precautions. discontinuing CP once patients have cleared MRSA or VRE carriage can improve patient care and reduce costs. a scenario-based survey describing two hypothetical cases of febrile infants without an infectious focus three and five weeks of age was sent to tertiary care pediatric ED and hospitalist physicians at a single center. participants were asked multiple-choice questions on management decisions with and without results of respiratory virus testing. a retrospective case-control analysis was performed comparing refugees with HBV to a control HBV population. RESULTS: NCHC referred 68 cases; 57 HBV, 10 HCV and one HBV-HCV. most were born in Asia or Africa (47.1%) refugees from NCHC represent about 3% of hepatitis referrals, but about 10% of our HBV referrals over this timeframe. further studies are needed to document the epidemiology of HBV and HCV in refugees to Canada. the chimera clone reduced nematocidal activity at 20% compared to 82% for the WT-CMRSA6 strain. the chimera clone had reduced nematocidal activity at 20% compared to 82% for the WT-CMRSA6 strain at day 5 respectively. antibiotics used included cephalexin, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin and clindamycin. the organism was found in a range of infections, including genitourinary, eye, and prosthetic infections. increased use of MALDI-TOF will lead to higher rates of identification. three consecutive urine cultures grew 108 cfu/mL of a Gram-negative cocci on CLED media. the isolate did not grow on MacConkey, blood, chocolate or Martin-Lewis agar, but grew anaerobically. experts must be aware of the ability and limitations of their local laboratory\u2019s urine culture method. 84 isolates from 63 patients by may of 2013 lacked clonality. apparent clusters of organisms argues towards evidence of inter-patient organism transmission. there is a possibility of transmission of mobile elements between organisms. llium species, A versicolor, and A ochraceus were negative. vaporizer cultures were negative. diabetes was a risk factor for invasive aspergillosis. 91 isolates tested by these methods were considered very major errors. CA for ceftriaxone and Vitek\u00ae 2, Etest\u00ae and M.I.C.E.TM was 76%, 77% and 68% respectively. Isolates from environmental cultures were identical or closely related to patient isolates. one patient was changed from an anti-tuberculosis treatment regimen to a regimen for M fortuitum. negative clinical impact was observed in one patient. load of 100,000 copies/mL in whole blood was statistically significant at P=0.0073. two patients developed EBV disease, both with elevated transaminases. cationic liposomes have antibacterial activity against H pylori. decreased inhibition (77%) was observed after 24 h. a total of 149 core-HVR1 sequences from 133 patients were obtained. twenty sequence clusters were found. a subset of 95 partial NS5b sequences was used for comparison. 318 requests for Bordetella PCR were from the emergency department (ED) at CHEO. viral studies were also ordered in 226 (53%) of all samples. each regimen was categorized as \u2018concordant\u2019, \u2018discordant\u2019 or \u2018not assessable\u2019. one hundred and eighty audits were performed in 143 patients over four randomly selected days. of 180 audits, 110 involved at least one antimicrobial. a small number of studies have looked at non-healthcare workers. factors affecting their decision whether to come to work sick have not been studied. no data exists in any capacity on SP among physicians in Canada. expression levels were determined by RNA sequencing of the blood of adult patients with suspected sepsis (n=72) twelve patients undergoing elective surgery were enrolled as negative controls. clinical data including clinical adjudication of sepsis status among the sepsis patients was determined by retrospective chart review. the VitekMS correctly identified 78 of 78 isolates after an average 5.7 h incubation. time to identification by the VitekMS was an average 22.8 h earlier (range 2 h to 70 h, median 23 h) compared to routine methods. hemoglobin was 78 g/L, WBC 38.4109/L with left shift, platelets were 55109/L. he had mild transaminitis (ALT 108 U/L; AST of 196 U/L), evidence of hemolysis, and acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 234 mol/L. 58 of 199 students followed iiimemoryhangers. over seven weeks, 35 memory hangers were uploaded with 85 likes. the tool was evaluated with usage analysis and student surveys."}
