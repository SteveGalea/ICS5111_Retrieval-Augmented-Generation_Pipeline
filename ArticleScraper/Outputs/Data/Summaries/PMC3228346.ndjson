{"summary": "diseases caused by zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely as strictly human pathogens to be classified as emerging or reemerging. zoonotic pathogens are regulated by multiple reservoir and nonreservoir hosts. in some cases emerging zoonoses can be traced back to contact with contaminated urine or feces from the deer mouse. over two-thirds of pathogens classified as zoonoses infect multiple nonhuman vertebrate species. over two-thirds of pathogens classified as zoonoses infect multiple nonhuman vertebrate species [1, 19\u201321]. more holistic syntheses are rarely performed, preserving the paradigm that zoonotic pathogens have a primary reservoir host species. over 70% of 1672 publications focused on a zoonotic pathogen investigated a single vertebrate host species. nearly 74% of the 865 zoonotic pathogens with documented host-species infect multiple host species. the focus on a single reservoir species obscures the basic biological features of zoonotic pathogens. several species of horseshoe bats have been implicated as reservoirs of SARS-like CoV [23\u201325] but their roles in amplifying and transmitting the pathogen remain obscure. active infections have been discovered in at least six nonbat species at a prevalence greater than 15%, but their roles in maintaining and transmitting the virus similarly are unknown. pathogens exist in analogous landscapes consisting of multiple reservoir hosts of various quality (sources) and nonreservoirs (sinks), with the enrichment that each vertebrate species is mobile so that the landscape is constantly shifting. ecology of zoonotic pathogens as complex of interactions with the animal community and relate the evolutionary fitness of the pathogens to human disease risk. species that contribute positively to the abundance of the zoonotic pathogen and to human disease risk are all qualitatively reservoirs of the pathogen. the quantitative effect of a reservoir species on the abundance of a zoonotic pathogen is a function of five commonly used parameters that vary depending on the reservoir species and on the pathogen. cows show visual signs of infection and have traditionally been associated with infected humans. new evidence suggests that the community of reservoir species is even more complex as new reservoir species continue to surface. the transmission strategies of zoonotic pathogens often depend on the species host that is infected. interspecies connectivity (among reservoir species) can be essential to pathogen success. cowpox cannot be maintained in a rodent community consisting solely of wood mice. extinction of cowpox occurs shortly after introduction into a wood mouse population. reservoir species often differ quantitatively in their effect on the magnitude and duration of pathogen transmission, and thus human disease risk. high connectivity among individuals within a reservoir species or among reservoir species can be essential to pathogen success. low-quality habitats, or \u201cdilution species,\u201d negatively impact the abundance of pathogens. presence of species other than reservoir species can dilute disease risk. presence of species other than reservoir species can act to regulate abundance of the vector itself, thereby modulating pathogen transmission. many mammalian species, such as raccoons, have high seroprevalence for WNV. there is no demonstration to date that they transmit the virus to feeding vectors. a healthy vector population is imperative for vector-borne disease connectivity. the majority of zoonotic pathogens infect, and are amplified by, multiple vertebrate species. the community-based approach will help deter false leads and ineffective public health interventions based on an oversimplified ecology of the zoonotic pathogen."}
