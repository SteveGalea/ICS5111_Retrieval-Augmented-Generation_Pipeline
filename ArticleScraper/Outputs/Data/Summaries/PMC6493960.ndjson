{"summary": "global recognition of threats in the early 2000s pushed alert, outbreak, and response mechanisms. in 2013, world attention was focused on the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV and avian influenza A (H7N9) since 2014, we have had two major Ebola virus disease outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a Marburg disease outbreak in Uganda. disease lists have a glaring original sin, says john sutter. sutter: lists implicitly communicate what is most important to their creator. sutter: a list of priority pathogens is most likely to cause a health emergency. sutter: this is thinking done in the wrong direction; this is thinking done wrong. the list is a multi-stakeholder funding entity formed for the purpose of bringing vaccine and related products against potential epidemic threats that are close to licensure to completion. the list is built around laboratory and specimen handling requirements, but is used as a guidepost for the generation of subset of lists that drive advanced development of medical countermeasures meant for stockpiles. NIH-reported research funding awards in the context of known or estimated disease burden focusing on diseases discussed in the R&D Blueprint. we focused on NIH funding for its breadth and transparency to illustrate the issues, although the figure does not incorporate other funders in this space. in 2016, this accounted for 1/5 of that spent on Zika, 1/10 that on Ebola, and 0.4% that on HIV. the NIH spends on what researchers request of it, but must submit proposals, and do so in ways that result in preferentially choosing calls that are well funded. a quick review of WHO Disease Outbreak News reveals that plague-related news postings easily are in the top 10 if not in the top five of reported events. the common response from colleagues is that antibacterial drugs exist and can be easily distributed against plague. a list and priority process performed completely differently might have focused on the need for easily disseminated antibacterial therapies. a modified approach for setting priorities could result in more funding stability, unlike what has been experienced recently. from 2013 to 2016, NIH awards for research on Ebola and related viruses increased 6-fold. funding for Zika virus increased 6-fold and funding for Zika virus went from zero to more than 60 million dollars. a list and priority process performed completely differently might ask what resources are needed to stop outbreaks rather than what pathogens need to be stopped. the list might have focused on the need for easily disseminated antibacterial therapies, as soon as they are needed. the list might have sparked logistics or drug formulation research. research awards fell 50\u2013100% between 2013 and 2016, despite all three being listed in the WHO R&D Blueprint. cnn's john sutter: this change in strategy could have beneficial impacts on mitigating large, transformative infectious disease emergencies that traditional R&D programming finds difficult. sutter: we need to focus on positively influencing prevention and response rather than too much on the tools themselves."}
