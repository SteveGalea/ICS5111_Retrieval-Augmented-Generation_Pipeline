{"summary": "microbes herpes simplex virus Detection by polymerase chain reaction Encephalitis is the most serious complication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. although rare, HSV is commonly included among causes of viral encephalitis. it is critical to rapidly and accurately establish the diagnosis and initiate treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. the diagnosis of encephalitis is made via PCR of CSF samples. testing of plasma or serum is critical to diagnose disseminated disease. there are 2 FDA-cleared assays to test CSF for HSV. studies have shown that monitoring patients with viral load testing during the first 2 years after transplant can dramatically reduce the development of PVAN. a renal biopsy may be performed to assess for PVAN and immunosuppressive therapy is reduced based on the results of the biopsy. preemptive therapy of high-risk patients based on increasing CMV load in peripheral blood was shown to be effective in the 1990s16,17. however, the first FDA-approved IVD test did not appear on the market until 2012. the availability of such methods has likely saved many lives over the years. 4 assays are FDA approved for detecting high-risk HPV genotype strains in cervical specimens. these tests are routinely used to confirm the presence of an HPV infection, screen for cervical cancer, and refer cases with an indeterminate cytology examination. papilloma virus\u2013positive head and neck cancer is biologically distinct from HPV-negative disease. chikungunya virus, chikungunya virus, chikungunya virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and zika virus. no FDA-approved tests were available to detect any of these pathogens. clinical laboratories developed, validated, and implemented the LDPs needed to care for patients at their institutions. in many areas, turnaround times for Zika virus testing exceeded 4 to 8 weeks. these delays critically impact patient care, particularly for pregnant women with possibly affected fetuses. many hospital-based and national reference laboratories are able to report results within hours. the first rapid diagnostic tests for influenza was directly associated with reduced length of hospital stay, decreased mortality, and reduced costs. access to diagnostic tests early in the course of an outbreak and in hospital laboratories has a positive public health impact. a frequency of 1:3500 to 1:5000 deliveries in the united states. the infection is acquired by exposure to maternal genital secretions. rapid diagnosis is needed to prevent morbidity and sequelae from encephalitis. the key to preventing allograft loss is to identify at-risk renal transplant recipients early and reduce immunosuppressive therapy before PVAN develops. there is a critical balance between too much immunosuppressive therapy, which can lead to PVAN, and too little immunosuppression causing rejection. preemptive therapy of high-risk patients based on increasing CMV load in peripheral blood was shown to be effective in the 1990s16,17. the first FDA-approved IVD test did not appear on the market until 2012. the availability of such methods has likely saved many lives over the years. more than 200 HPV genotypes have been described,24. approximately 40 are capable of infecting the human genital tract. a relative few are known to cause cervical cancer and other malignancies. recent examples of emerging or reemerging pathogens causing substantial human morbidity and mortality include avian influenza virus (\u201cbird flu\u201d), chikungunya virus, Ebola virus, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and Zika virus. no FDA-approved tests were available to detect any of these pathogens. federalregister.gov/documents/2016/03/28/2016-06888/authorization-of-emergency-use-of-an-in-vitro-diagnostic-device-for-diagnosis-of-zika-virus. turnaround times for Zika virus testing exceeded 4 to 8 weeks. rapid identification of pathogens during other outbreaks facilitates rapid treatment and appropriate isolation of patients, leading to improved patient outcomes. access to diagnostic tests, early in the course of an outbreak and in hospital laboratories, has a positive public health impact. 204 laboratories reported results from testing 3 blinded proficiency-testing specimens. the specimens contained recurring somatic mutations in KRAS exons 12 or 13 (NM_004985.3), c.35G>T (p.G12 V) and c.38G>A (p.G13D) Activating mutations in BRAF can lead to increased proliferation and prolonged cell survival in a variety of tumor types. 60 Laboratories will typically test for BRAF mutations in low-grade gliomas (for diagnosis), colorectal cancer (for diagnosis), hairy cell leukemia (for diagnosis), lung adenocarcinomas (to predict response to therapy), thyroid cancer (for preoperative detection of thyroid cancer in FNA samples and prognosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma) or mel ID BRAF kit (bioMerieux, Boston, MA, USA) does detect both BRAF V600E and BRAF V600K mutations. it is necessary to distinguish between alternate therapeutic options (single agent vs combination therapy) it is therefore important to identify all BRAF activating mutations to assist in the selection of appropriate therapy. microsatellite instability occurs in approximately 15% of all colorectal carcinomas. a microsatellite-stable phenotype if none of the markers show instability, and an MSI-low phenotype if only 1 of 5 or less than 30% of the markers show instability. some reports indicate that MSI-H tumors may not be responsive to 5-fluorouracil\u2013based therapies. however, there are currently no FDA-approved tests for the evaluation of microsatellite instability. both assays tested for the exon 19 deletions and the exon 20 L858R point mutation. each test was approved for specific therapeutic indications and specimen types. as new drugs became available, approval for new claims was needed. the complexity of cancer biology and the ever-evolving therapeutic approach to management of the patient with cancer more often requires expanded knowledge of the tumor beyond single-gene mutation status. despite this approval and the routine use of NGS in LDPs setting, there are no currently FDA-approved NGS tests for application in oncology. 111 laboratories recently participated in a CAP-sponsored proficiency assessment of NGS cancer panel testing. each test can be designed to detect hotspots of known mutations in those genes, to sequence the entire coding region of the genes, or to sequence the entire gene. the end result is a comprehensive profile of the tumor genome that can be used to tailor therapy for the individual patient. a reduction in posttreatment BCR-ABL1 RNA levels was shown to be the best available test for predicting therapeutic response and long-term progression-free survival in TKI-treated patients with CML. clinical laboratories have been offering accurate and sensitive PCR-based laboratory-developed procedures for BCR-ABL1 for at least the last 15 years. the CAP has been offering semi-annual BCR-ABL1 PT surveys for at least 10 years. 90% of these accredited laboratories now report their PCR results using the standardized IS. the primary driving force behind the remarkable increase in longevity and quality of life for patients with CML over the past 15 years has no doubt been the availability of novel-targeted therapies. a landmark study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in 2007 demonstrated that patients harboring a mutated KRAS failed to respond to targeted therapy with cetuximab. at the time, there were no clinical tests for KRAS mutations available. 204 laboratories reported results from testing 3 blinded proficiency-testing specimens. the specimens contained recurring somatic mutations in KRAS exons 12 or 13 (NM_004985.3), c.35G>T (p.G12 V) and c.38G>A (p.G13D) the vast majority of reporting laboratories utilized LDPs. afenib (TAFINLAR) is a kinase inhibitor indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation or in combination with trametinib (MEKINIST) the THxID BRAF kit (bioMerieux, Boston, MA, USA) does detect both BRAF V600E and BRAF V600K mutations (but not other BRAF V600K mutation 420 samples but discordant for 28 (6.7%). of 10 samples with BRAF V600 mutations detected by the LDPs, 5 were V600K, D, or R mutations, and 2 contained only 20% tumor cells. 4 samples with retesting, 1 was not mutated, and 2 were considered invalid results. the appropriate cutoff for determining an MSI-H phenotype is the finding of instability in 30% or more of the markers tested. the finding of an MSI-H phenotype is consistent with the presence of defective DNA MMR in the tumor. the definitive establishment of a diagnosis of LS requires the finding of a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA MMR genes. non-small cell lung cancer tumors with EGFR-activating mutations are responsive to gefitinib and erlotinib, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR. the FDA followed with approval of the Roche Cobas EGFR Mutation Test in 2013 along with the Qiagen therascreen EGFR RGQ Kit. these mutations were detected by 98.3% (178 of 181), 99.0% (190 of 192) and 94.1% (144 of 153) of laboratories. the denominator is often less than 192.77 as patients being treated with these new targeted anti-EGFR therapies began to relapse. in multiple genes results in information that can allow the oncologist to develop a more accurate treatment strategy including therapies selected based on a \u201cresponsive\u201d tumor profile and those not selected based on the presence of resistance mutations. despite this approval, there are no currently FDA-approved NGS tests for application in oncology. 111 laboratories recently participated in a CAP-sponsored proficiency assessment of NGS cancer panel testing (NGSST-A-2016), with data collection on 10 gene mutations. 993 (98.3%) were called concordantly (unpublished data) clinical laboratories have been offering accurate and sensitive PCR-based laboratory-developed procedures for BCR-ABL1 for at least the last 15 years. the CAP has been offering semi-annual BCR-ABL1 PT surveys for at least 10 years, with a progressive increase in the number of participating laboratories. this 15-year targeted therapy program for CML occurred entirely without the availability of FDA-approved BCR-ABL diagnostic reagents. these assays were based upon those developed in clinical laboratories; they are not approved for diagnosis of CML nor do they cover the spectrum of breakpoints that occur in the disease. the negative consequences to patient care in the past and the future would have been substantial. PCR primers and Southern blot reagents are available commercially as analyte-specific reagents (ASR) or as investigational use only. the ACMG has published standards and guidelines for clinical laboratories that perform this test. the CAP has developed inspection checklists for laboratories performing NGS for detection of somatic mutations in cancers and germline mutations that cause heritable diseases. progress has also been made in the planning and production of reference materials and proficiency samples. the aCMGG has issued guidance on how to deal with the incidental identification of variants in the so-called \u201cactionable\u201d genes in patients tested for unrelated conditions. the genetics and pathology communities are increasingly embracing data sharing. these interpretative tasks would be beyond the scope of an FDA approval for a kit, or the CLIA oversight of an LDP. a third of the genes for which the ACMG recommends return of results are made up of these cardiomyopathy genes. these disorders are heterogeneous, which can lead to clinical diagnostic uncertainty or error. genetic testing can also identify phenocopies such as Fabry disease, which can masquerade as isolated HCM. it is important to avoid treatment with sodium channel blockers as these can worsen seizures in Dravet syndrome. it is important to classify newly found variant quickly and accurately. TBCK-related intellectual disability syndrome is rare with developmental delay, hypotonia, and seizures. patients who carry a germline mutation of BRCA1 or 2 have a lifetime risk of breast cancer of 60% to 70%. patients who carry a germline mutation of BRCA1 or 2 have a lifetime risk of breast cancer of 60% to 70%. rare disease Detection by Next-Generation Sequencing: Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is an inherited skin and connective tissue disease that causes skin and oral blistering with only mild trauma. 99% of patients with biopsy-proven EB will have mutation(s) in 1 of 18 genes known to cause the disorder. Whole-exome sequencing involves evaluating the coding regions of all 20 000 human genes at once, to search for the molecular cause of an undiagnosed but presumed genetic disorder. the tests are highly complex and involve capture of the relevant DNA segments, sequencing of those segments, bioinformatics approaches to sequence alignment and identification of variants, and interpretation of the identified variants. 136,137 Huntington disease falls under the category of a rare (orphan) disorder. no commercial genetic testing platform has been developed or submitted to the FDA for review. the relatively small number of laboratories offering diagnostic or predictive (presymptomatic) testing for this disorder must therefore rely entirely on LDPs. studies are still in an early phase with no outcome data yet available. they give patients hope for the future, perhaps for themselves but also for future patients. the earlier such intervention is initiated the higher the chances of success. over 50 laboratories in the united states offer testing for FX. PCR primers and Southern blot reagents are available commercially as analyte-specific reagents. the repetitive sequence reads in a single region ensure an enhanced level of quality. the repetitive sequence reads in a single region ensure an enhanced level of quality. the CAP has developed inspection checklists for laboratories performing NGS for detection of somatic mutations in cancers. nih.gov/clinvar/ serves as a centralized site for managing genomic knowledge surrounding genes and variants. guidance issued by the ACMGG on how to deal with incidental identification of variants in the so-called \u201cactionable\u201d genes in patients tested for unrelated conditions. nearly a third of the genes for which the ACMG recommends return of results are made up of these cardiomyopathy genes. these disorders are heterogeneous, which can lead to clinical diagnostic uncertainty or error. genetic testing can also identify phenocopies such as Fabry disease, which masquerade as isolated HCM. epilepsy is most efficiently accomplished using an NGS panel to provide accurate information to the physician for treatment planning. it is important to avoid treatment with sodium channel blockers as these can worsen seizures in Dravet syndrome. TBCK-related intellectual disability syndrome is rare with developmental delay, hypotonia, and seizures. 119-122 Congenital muscular dystrophies and limb\u2013girdle muscular dystrophies are the 2 major subgroups. these are genetically heterogenous, with many new genes being implicated in recent years. lack of pathognomonic signs or specific biochemical markers make diagnosis difficult. extensive diagnostic workup involving protein studies on muscle biopsy may be used to narrow the number of single genes to be tested. rare disease Detection by Next-Generation Sequencing: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is an inherited skin and connective tissue disease that causes skin and oral blistering with only mild trauma. the severity of the disorder depends on the layer of skin where the tissue separation occurs. the laboratory participates in ongoing PT to demonstrate assay quality. the disease is rare (200 children born with EB annually),133 the cost of bringing such a test through FDA for approval is prohibitive. without an available LDP, patients and families affected would go without specific diagnoses. the time delay involved in bringing this test and its frequent modifications to the FDA is prohibitive. the cost of bringing WES through FDA approval would be a major deterrent. 136,137 Huntington disease falls under the category of a rare (orphan) disorder. the results can afford the affected patients the opportunity to enroll in clinical trials involving drugs or neuronal stem cells. these studies are still in an early phase with no outcome data yet available. the earlier such intervention is initiated the higher the chances of success. too high a dose puts the patient at risk of either graft failure or early relapse. 139,142 Hepatic SOS refers to the occlusion of terminal hepatic venules and hepatic sinusoids. it is one of the most feared complications of HCT and accounts for a significant fraction of HCT-related mortality. busulfan testing is currently available from reference laboratories. many busulfan regimens call for intravenous infusions every 6 or 24 hours for 3 to 4 days. a number of sensitive and specific assays using MS have been described for Te.153-155 The lack of sufficient accuracy and standardization of Te assays is a major concern for the clinical and public health communities. a number of assays using MS have been approved by the CDC HoST program. no FDA-approved assays for ethylene glycol are currently available. the 3 most common methods for the analysis of ethylene glycol are GC with flame ionization detector, GC with MS, and enzymatic assays. newer FDA-cleared Tg assays are immunometric immunoassays (Tg-IA) and can detect Tg at concentrations down to approximately 0.1 ng/mL. the signal is directly proportional to the amount of Tg. the assay design is susceptible to interference from endogenous anti-Tg-Ab. Tg-IA, Tg-RIA, and Tg-MS in both Tg-Ab and Tg-Ab+ patients. the ATA guideline mentions it as a promising new technique. without Tg-MS, thyroid cancer recurrence in Tg-Ab+ patients can be missed. as many as 1821 additional carriers of MDRO Enterobacteriaceae were estimated to have occurred in orange County, California. the disastrous spread of MDRO Enterobacteriaceae can be mitigated by laboratories validating testing methods that enable use of updated antimicrobial breakpoint interpretations. without the option of using an LDP, one is left reporting outdated interpretations that miss resistant strains leading to unacceptable patient care. busulfan testing is currently available from reference laboratories. many busulfan regimens call for intravenous infusions every 6 or 24 hours for 3 to 4 days. testosterone Very sensitive measurements of serum androgens are important in adult and pediatric endocrinology and oncology. most commonly used methods for steroid analysis are FDA-approved immunoassays because they are rapid and sensitive enough for most routine applications involving healthy adult males. testosterone is a perfect example of an LDP that is indispensable for patient care. it allows for accurate measurements to be made on children, women, and male patients receiving antiandrogen medication. no FDA-approved assays for ethylene glycol are currently available. chromatography with mass spectrometry is considered the gold standard for the analysis of ethylene glycol. the ethylene glycol blood concentration is used to determine when hemodialysis has cleared ethylene glycol to undetectable levels. the death rate is almost 2000 per year. the method used, up to 36% of treated patients with DTC are Tg-Ab positive (Tg-Ab+) the degree of Tg interference cannot be predicted from the magnitude of the Tg-Ab result. up to 20% of patients with recurrence are missed by Tg-IA testing. FDA clears automated instruments used to determine MIC values. new breakpoints added to the instrument software require a revised 510k application. manufacturers may elect to use outdated breakpoints rather than face the expense of a 510K resubmission. laboratory testing should be consistent with national/international consensus treatment guidelines. in such cases, laboratories must be able to perform additional validation of new sample types or develop additional assays to include new mutations or analytes that are needed. the current structure for FDA approval requires review of assay kits individually or in comparison with the predicate method. a quality pilot has emerged from the Sustainable Predictive Oncology Therapeutics and Diagnostics working group. the pilot proposes that laboratories use assays that best serve the needs of their patients based on performance, quality, clinical needs, and the test menus and volumes of that particular laboratory. the overarching goal is the efficacy and safety of our clinical laboratory tests and procedures for patients."}
