{"summary": "pentraxins are a superfamily of evolutionarily conserved molecules with multi-functional roles in innate immunity and inflammation. pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is the prototype of the long pentraxin subfamily, originally identified as an IL-1 or TNF-inducible gene. PTX3 is an essential mediator of innate resistance to selected pathogens of fungal, bacterial and viral origin. expression of long pentraxin PTX3 is inducible in a wide variety of cell types. PTX3 is mainly induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF. expression is inducible in a wide variety of cell types, including fibroblasts and endothelial cells. high density lipoproteins (HDL and ox-LDL) induce PTX3 production in endothelial cells. PTX3 expression is negatively regulated by IFN-, IL-4, dexamethasone, 1,25-dihydroxivitamin D3 and prostaglandin E2. PTX3 expression is also induced by ovulatory stimuli in granulosa cells. a second enhancer was found 230 kb upstream of the PTX3 gene promoter. the enhancer 2 was found only to bind NF-B after TNF- stimulation in macrophages, suggesting that this regulatory element could be important in the activation of tissue-specific transcription factors. the enhancer 2 could have a direct role in activating the expression of PTX3. PTX3 gene is located in chromosome 3 and is organized in three exons. the promoter of PTX3 contains several transcription factor binding sites. the second enhancer\u2014containing the transcription factor binding site for NF-B\u2014encompasses the second PTX3 exon (A) two of these SNPs are located in PTX3 intronic non-coding regions. the third is an exonic polymorphism that causes an amino acid substitution at position 48 (D48A, or rs3816527) it is not currently possible to exclude a direct local effect of amino acid substitution on protein structure (therefore function) ea pig apexin, rat, human, and murine neuronal pentraxins 1 (NP1, or NPTX1) and 2 (NP2, also known as Narp or NPTX2), the putative integral membrane pentraxin NRP, and PTX4 (27) the PTX3 protomer is organized into an N-terminal region and a 203 amino acids long C-terminal domain with homology to the short pentraxins C complex type glycosylation occurs in the natural protein made by human cells too (32) and mediates some of the PTX3 biological functions, including inhibition of influenza A virus hemagglutination (35, 36) and recognition of P-selectin (37). protein glycosylation (with major regard to sialylation) modulates the interaction of PTX3 with C1q. PTX3 is made of covalent octamers (i.e., with a molecular mass of 340 kDa) both domains have been implicated in the recognition of complement factor H (43, 44), and Ficolin-1 (45). oligomeric organization has important implications in its ligand binding properties. long pentraxin PTX3 can act as a nodal molecule in cross-linking hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix (41, 50) high resolution models are urgently needed to disentangle structural complexity of this long pentraxin and shed light on its structure/function relationships. innate immunity is involved in initiating the process of tissue repair (51\u201353) PTX3 interacts with fibrinogen/fibrin and collagen domains of other fluid-phase PRMs. by interacting at acidic pH with fibrinogen/fibrin and collagen, PTX3 favors pericellular fibrinolysis. this anti-tumor potential of PTX3 is hampered by genetic or epigenetic silencing of PTX3 leading to enhanced tumor growth. PTX3-deficient mice reverted the IL-6/STAT3-dependent interstitial fibrosis in a mouse model of acute kidney injury (76). PTX3 administration reverted the IL-6/STAT3-dependent interstitial fibrosis in a mouse model of acute kidney injury (76). defective fibrinolysis is described as an etiopathological factor leading to reduced remodeling and altered connective tissue formation. PTX3-deficient macrophages and fibroblasts showed defective fibrinolytic activity (15), thus suggesting that PTX3 contributes to the progression of a normal and efficient pericellular fibrinolysis which promotes repair. interaction of PTX3 with fibrin and Plg is restricted to PTX3, since no similar function has been reported for short pentraxins. only one study reported the interaction of SAP with fibrin and consequent modulation of in vitro formation of clots. in arterial thrombosis PTX3 disfavored pro-thrombotic activity of fibrinogen and collagen (62) PTX3 interacts with P-selectin and tunes P-selectin-dependent neutrophil extravasation (37) however, PTX3 did not influence P-selectin-dependent platelet-leukocyte and platelet-endothelium aggregation (62, 92) invasiveness at the site of damage exerted a compromised therapeutic effect causing delayed healing (68) similar results were obtained in a mouse model of acid aspiration-dependent acute lung injury (69) mimicking acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by aspiration of gastric contents (99) the expression of PTX3 was associated with non-hematopoietic/non-endothelial periosteal cells. PTX3 reversed the negative effect of FGF2 on osteoblast differentiation from bone marrow stromal cells in vitro. further studies are needed to address the relevance of PTX3-dependent modulation of the fibrinolytic system in bone repair. PTX3-deficiency caused increased susceptibility to mesenchymal and epithelial carcinogenesis in mice. infiltrating macrophages and endothelial cells were the major source of PTX3 in response to locally produced IL-1. PTX3-deficient tumors were characterized by increased macrophage infiltration, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, complement activation, and angiogenesis. the role of PTX3-mediated anti-angiogenic activity has not been addressed so far in primary carcinogenesis. PTX3 behaves as an extrinsic oncosuppressor gene by acting at the level of complement-mediated, macrophage-sustained, tumor promoting inflammation. in basal-like breast cancers, PTX3 was found to be a critical target of oncogenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling and NF upregulation of PTX3 gene expression was observed in ovarian cancer (116), anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (120), soft tissue liposarcoma (121), prostate cancer (122), and glioblastoma (123). increased circulating levels of PTX3 were observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms (124), soft tissue sarcomas (125), lung cancers (126\u2013128), pancreatic carcinomas (129), glio cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (132), and with overall survival and disease-free survival in small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (133) PTX3 levels were not predictive of pathology occurrence (128) in prostate cancer patients, circulating levels of PTX3 were higher compared to patients with prostatic inflammation, while serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and CRP were not different. in hepatocellular carcinoma, PTX3 expression was analyzed after liver resection in tumoral and adjacent normal tissue. a higher PTX3 expression was observed in the tumoral area. PTX3 expression was correlated with advanced stage, larger tumor size, presence of intra-hepatic metastases, portal vein tumor thrombosis and liver cirrhosis. PTX3 is involved in tissue remodeling and repair in sterile conditions through the recognition of matrix molecules. other humoral PRMs interact with ECM components (e.g., C1q, collectins, CRP, SAP) and several ECM molecules recognize microbial moieties and have opsonic activity (e.g., fibronectin, mindin, osteopontin, vitronectin) wound-healing responses favoring tumor growth are activated in the tumor microenvironment. these include extravascular deposition of fibrin that acts as a provisional stroma for stromal and immune cells migration. fibrin degradation, vascular resorption and collagen synthesis result in formation of dense fibrous connective tissue. PTX3 inhibits the FGF-driven tumor cell proliferation in vitro, tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastatic potential in vivo. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
