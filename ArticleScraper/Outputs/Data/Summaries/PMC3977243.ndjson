{"summary": "second-generation E1/E3-deleted Ad5 vectors are configured to minimize outgrowth of wild-type (WT) virus and to reduce immunogenicity (15). to develop adenoviruses for expressing hDPP4 in mouse lungs, we cloned a FLAG and myc-tagged cDNA into a replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad5-hDPP4). after Ad5-hDPP4 transduction, there was widespread hDPP4 expression in airway and alveolar epithelial cells. we infected 6- to 12-wk-old and 18- to 22-mo-old mice with MERS-CoV 5 d after transduction. innate responses triggered by the Ad vector would be dissipated by 5 d after transduction (16) hDDP4 expression was monitored by Western blot assay (A) or flow cytometry (B) five days after transduction with 2.5 108 pfu of Ad5-hDPP4 or Ad5-Empty, mice were infected with 1 105 pfu of MERS-CoV in 50 L of DMEM. to obtain virus titers, lungs were homogenized at the indicated time points. lungs were titered on Vero 81 cells. data are representative of two independent experiments. each in MERS-CoV\u2013infected mice, Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced mice impaired in RLR or TLR signaling. infection of MyD88/ but not MAVS/ mice resulted in up to 20% weight loss. poly I:C delivered 6 h after infection also accelerated virus clearance. administration of IFN-2b to MERS-CoV\u2013infected macaques improved clinical, radiological, and virological parameters of infection. sections of paraffin-embedded lungs from Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice were stained with hematoxylin/eosin. mice were treated with 20 g of poly I:C, 2,000 units of IFN-, 200 ng of IFN- or PBS. equine encephalitis replicon particles (VRP-S) expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein reduced MERS-CoV titers to nearly undetectable levels by day 1 p.i. anti-S antibody, which blocked virus attachment, was sufficient for this effect because transfer of sera from VRP-S\u2013immunized mice also accelerated the kinetics of virus clearance. as pfu/g tissue (n = 3\u20134 mice per group per time point) data are representative of two independent experiments. data are representative of five independent experiments. peptides S291, S823, and N214 combined. data are representative of two independent experiments. low level of cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. mice were treated before infection with serum obtained from SARS-CoV. mice received 300 L of immune serum from mice previously (5 wk) infected with a sublethal dose of SARS-CoV (500 pfu) Mortality (A) and weight (B) were monitored daily (n = 12 in all groups) 105 pfu of MERS-CoV were monitored daily (n = 12 in all groups) titers in the lungs were measured at the indicated time points. data are representative of two independent experiments. mice were resistant to MERS-CoV whereas MERS-CoV replicated to high titers in Ad5-hDPP4\u2013transduced cells. after Ad5-hDPP4 transduction, only endogenous mouse DPP4 expression was detected. innate responses triggered by the Ad vector would be dissipated by 5 d after transduction (16) mice were transduced with Ad5-hDPP4 or Ad5-Empty at an MOI of 20 at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. hDDP4 expression was monitored by Western blot assay (A) or flow cytometry (B) mice were infected with 1 105 pfu of MERS-CoV in 50 L of DMEM. weight changes in 6- to 12-wk-old (young) and 18- to 22-mo-old (aged) B6 (E) and BALB/c (F) mice were monitored daily. to obtain virus titers, lungs were homogenized at the indicated time points and titered on Vero 81 cells. MERS-CoV does not induce significant amounts of IFN/ expression in vitro (18\u201320) but the role of type-I IFN induction and signaling in vivo is unknown. infection of MyD88/ but not MAVS/ mice resulted in 20% weight loss. edema and increased infiltration of granulocytes, especially eosinophils, were observed only in infected IFNAR/ lungs. we transduced B6 mice with Ad5-hDPP4 and, 5 d later, treated them with poly I:C, a TLR3 agonist. poly I:C delivered 6 h after infection also accelerated virus clearance. data are representative of two independent experiments. n = 3\u20134 mice per group per time point. data are representative of two independent experiments. Virus was not cleared in mice lacking T cells (TCR/, RAG1/), or in SCID mice. despite persistent infections, none of these mice lost weight. anti-S antibody reduced MERS-CoV titers to nearly undetectable levels by day 1 p.i. mice were transduced and infected with 1 105 pfu of MERS-CoV 2\u20134 wk after booster. peptides were efficiently lysed to identify MERS-CoV\u2013specific CD8 T cells. cytotoxicity assays were performed on day 7 (BALB/c mice; peptides S395, S434, and S1165 combined) or day 8 (B6 mice; peptides S291, S823, and N214 combined) p.i. data are representative of five independent experiments. the reciprocal initial infection with SARS-CoV resulted in a statistically significant but minor decrease in MERS-CoV titers at day 5 p.i. after challenge. this decrease may reflect a cross-reactive T-cell response because no differences were detected at early times p.i. control mice received 300 L of immune serum from mice previously (5 wk) infected with 1 105 pfu of MERS-CoV. innate, antibody, and T-cell responses are important for protection from MERS-CoV. hDPP4 expression after AD5-hDDP4 intranasal inoculation is restricted to the lungs. transgenic expression may not be targeted to the correct organ (29, 30) mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) was a kind gift from Dr. Kanta Subbarao. a human DPP4 ORF clone was purchased from Origene. MLE15 cells were transduced with Ad5-hDPP4 or Ad5-Empty at multiplicity of infection = 20 for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. extracts were prepared 48 h posttransduction. Identical amounts of protein were separated on a 4\u201320% SDS/PAGE gel. mice were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. lungs were removed into PBS and homogenized using a manual homogenizer. animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by zinc formalin. lated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was detected with an alkaline phosphatase\u2013biotin\u2013avidin mixture. sections were visualized with vector blue and counterstained with nuclear fast red. mice were killed at the indicated time points. 106 cells per well were cultured in 96-well dishes at 37 \u00b0C for 5\u20136 h. cells were then labeled for cell-surface markers, fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution (BD Biosciences), and labeled with anti\u2013IFN- antibody. VRPs were packaged using helper RNAs encoding structural proteins. a hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to the C terminus of S protein for titering in BHK21 cells. titers of 1010 1011 pfu/ml in A195 buffer (29.5 mM histidine, 54 mM TrisHCl, 10.8 mM MgCl2, 108 M EDTA, 0.0216% ethanol, 5% sucrose in PBS) MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were cultured in 2% FBS RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 g/mL insulin, 5 g/mL se protein was separated on a 4\u201320% SDS/PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. membranes were stained with a mouse anti-human antibody (clone 11D7; Origene), a rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), or a mouse anti\u2013-tubulin (clone DM1A; Sigma) cell titers are expressed as pfu/g tissue for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by zinc formalin. sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin for histological analysis. splenocytes from CD45.1 congenic naive mice were stained with either 2 M or 100 nM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) then pulsed with the indicated peptides (3 M each) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h for 1 h. at 12 h after transfer, total lung cells were isolated. 106 cells per well were cultured in 96-well dishes at 37 \u00b0C for 5\u20136 h. cells were then labeled for cell-surface markers, fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution (BD Biosciences), and labeled with anti\u2013IFN- antibody. was used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. all results are expressed as means SEs of the means."}
