{"summary": "NiV is an enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the family Paramyxoviridae, genus henipavirus. from 1998 to 2015, more than 600 cases of NiV human infections were reported. from 1998 to 2015, more than 600 cases of NiV human infections were reported. human NiV infection was first recognized in a large outbreak of 276 reported cases in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore from September 1998 through May 1999. three years later, a genetically distinct NiV independently emerged in India as well as in Bangladesh, where human NiV outbreak events have been reported nearly every year since. RT-PCR assays detected RNA from NiV in urine samples. a second outbreak was reported in 2007 in Nadia district of west Bengal. all five fatal cases were found to be positive for NiV by RT-PCR. six genes code are the nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion glycoprotein (F), attachment glycoprotein (G) and the large polymerase. the viral G protein activates the F protein to initiate viral envelope and host membrane fusion and viral entry. infected bats shed virus in excretion and secretion such as saliva, urine, semen, and excreta. emergence of bat-related viral infection communicable to humans and animals has been attributed to the loss of natural habitat of bats. seasonal preference of transmission in P. lylei was recently demonstrated in a study in Thailand. the period April\u2013June was the time (highest in May) when viral RNA could be mainly detected in urine. there were focal outbreaks of NiV in Bangladesh and India in 2001 during winter. NiV was cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid of two patients in 1999. it was causing the syncytial formation of Vero cells after 5 days. it was found to be a previously undescribed paramyxovirus related to the Hendra virus. NiV-M and NiV-B range from 92 to 100%. a seroepidemiologic study in Malaysia implicated four fruit bat species. fected bats shed virus in their excretion and secretion such as saliva, urine, semen, and excreta. direct contact with infected pigs was identified as the predominant mode of transmission in humans when it was first recognized in 1999. there is circumstantial evidence of human-to-human transmission in india in 2001. During the outbreak in siliguri, 33 health workers became ill after exposure to patients hospitalized with NiV illness. strong evidence indicative of human-to-human transmission was found in Bangladesh in 2004. the most intriguing complication of Nipah is probably relapsing encephalitis. relapsing encephalitis is distinct from acute NiV encephalitis. NiV is classified internationally as a biosecurity level 4 agent,[5] and the laboratory at National Institute of Virology (ICMR), Pune, India is prepared to diagnose NiV in the country. diagnostic initial signs and symptoms of NiV infection are nonspecific, and the diagnosis is often not suspected at the time of presentation. a 36 amino acid HR2-based fusion inhibitor (NiV-Fc2) has been proposed as a specific therapy against henipaviruses. in case of severe disease, when no treatment with a proven record of safety and efficacy is available, they may appear as the only available therapeutic option. antiviral drugs Ribavirin Ribavirin is a guanosine analog and broad-spectrum nucleoside antimetabolite antiviral drug that features on the WHO Essential Medicines List. an inhalation solution of ribavirin is also indicated for the treatment, in young children, of severe lower respiratory tract infections due to the respiratory syncytial virus. monoclonal antibodies targeting the surface glycoproteins of HeV have shown efficacy against both HeV and NiV as pre- and postexposure prophylaxis in animal models. as these antibodies must be administered before the onset of clinical signs, they are unlikely to be useful for treating symptomatic patients, while probably beneficial for postexposure prophylaxis in potentially exposed individuals. limiting disease and increasing survival of NiV-infected hamsters. when administered at 3 mg/kg of body weight daily from the day of infection to 10 days postinfection, prevented the mortality in 5 of 6 infected animals. infected animals with close supervision of burial or incineration of carcasses may be necessary to reduce the spread of the disease. establishing an animal health surveillance system, using a One Health approach, to detect new cases is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public health authorities. the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to and decrease infection from NiV. the first known outbreak in Malaysia in 1998 killed 105 people and required the culling of over one million pigs. deforestation and urbanization of some areas in Bangladesh have contributed to greater overlap between human and bat habitats. a more important route through which humans acquire NiV from bats is the consumption of date palm sap, a delicacy in Bangladesh. the sap is collected underneath trees, where it can be contaminated by virus-containing secretions from bats. some bats have been caught and have been sent for lab examination. a total of 60 different samples have been collected from the spot. the field team has advised hospitals to follow intracranial pressure guidelines. enhancing active fever surveillance in the community; strengthen contact tracing in close contacts of cases, relatives, healthcare workers; ensure isolation facilities, ventilator support, and hospital infection control practices. efforts are in place to reduce the panic created by social media by educating people that NiV is not an airborne infection. the concept of global health diplomacy holds a promise to address the needs of global health security through its binding or nonbinding instruments enforced by the global governance institutions. there is a great need to strengthen intersectoral coordination, review the treatment procedures, infection control practices, and ensure use of PPE and availability of drugs."}
