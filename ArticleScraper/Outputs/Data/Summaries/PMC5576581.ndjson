{"summary": "new information will advance our understanding of the interaction between the airway epithelium and inflammatory cells in the context of RV infection and disease exacerbation. the anti-RV16 monoclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. Waiming Lee. hypothalamus extract (15 mg/ml), bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml), and all-trans-retinoic acid (30 nM) uninfected epithelial cells (A549 or primary HBE) were cultivated for 24 h in serum-free or growth-factor\u2013free media. the media were collected and filtered through a 0.2 m sterile filter. cDNA was prepared from 2 mg of total RNA and diluted to 100 l with water. cDNA was then analyzed using a PCR master mix on a veriti thermal cycler. the relative amount of mRNA was calculated based on the Ct method. pLX304-ICAM1 plasmid was purchased from the DNASU Plasmid Repository at Arizona State University (Phoenix, CA) 293T cells were transfected overnight with pLX304-ICAM1, VSVG, and 8.7 using Lipofectamine 2000. supernatants were collected and pooled together. hRNA and shRNA against ICAM1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) monocytes were infected at an MOI of 10. cell culture, conditioned media, and RV Infection THP-1 and A549 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. uninfected epithelial cells were cultivated for 24 h in serum-free or growth-factor\u2013free media. the cells were washed three times in PBS to remove viral particles. a modified 50% tissue culture infective dose protocol was developed. we calculated TCID50 by immune staining infected cells using an anti-RV16 antibody. cDNA was prepared from 2 mg of total RNA and diluted to 100 l with water. anti-ICAM1 and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Biological duplicates were shown in a representative image. 293T cells were transfected overnight with pLX304-ICAM1, VSVG, and 8.7 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) the cells were then treated with 10 M sodium butyrate for 8 h. supernatants were collected and pooled together. a simple CC system in which epithelial cells (A549) and monocytic cells (THP-1) were cocultivated in the same culture dish. after extensive washing, there were no monocytes left in the adherent epithelial culture. in the suspension, less than 0.1% of floating epithelial cells was usually detected by a differential cell count. thus, cross-contamination between the two cell types was negligible. CC and IC were significantly enhanced in monocytes when it was cocultivated with airway epithelial cells. THP-1 cells were cocultivated with A549 cells for 24 h. then, RV16 or RV1A was added to the coculture (CC) for 24 h. cells were separated and extensively washed as described in Materials and Methods before they were harvested. the CM treatment recapitulated the CC effect by significantly enhancing RV16 mRNA (Figure 2A) and coat protein (Figure 2B) a substantial amount of infectious RV16 was detected by TCID50 assay from the CM-treated cells, but not from the base medium (BM)-treated cells. infectious viral particles were measured using a modified 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay. RV16 mRNA was measured in THP-1 cells in the presence of CM from primary HBE cells for 24 h. RV16 replication in monocytes significantly induced cytokine expressions by RV16 infection of CM-treated cells. RNA was isolated, followed by qPCR analysis. CM treatment also stimulated ICAM1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. a markedly increased ICAM1 expression appeared to be a common monocytic response to the CC condition or to CM from epithelial cells. however, it appeared to be heat resistant, as its stimulating effect was not abolished by heat inactivation. NF- was previously documented to increase ICAM1 expression (27) however, we ectopically overexpressed ICAM1 using a lentiviral transduction system. we found that PMA markedly increased ICAM1 expression and RV16 production. lenti-ICAM1 successfully drove a significant ICAM1 expression in monocytes. lenti-ICAM1\u2013transduced cells were infected with RV16. lentiviral particles containing ICAM1 were used to transduce monocytes. RV16 coat protein and ICAM1 were measured by Western blot analysis. Actin was used as a loading control. Arrows represent viral coat proteins: VP0 (upper band) and VP4 (lower band). shRNA, short hairpin RNA. RNA was detected in monocytes (Figure 1A) than in epithelial cells (Figure 1B), suggesting that either more viruses entered monocytes in CC or more active viral replication occurred in CC than in IC. a greater RV16 replication was most likely present in CC than in IC. RV1A mRNA was measured by qPCR analysis in individual culture (IC) and CC. experiments were repeated at least three times. CM from Epithelial Cells Were Able to Enhance RV16 production in monocytes. RV16 replication was significantly enhanced in monocytes in the presence of CM from epithelial cells. CMp was also found to dramatically increase RV16 replication in monocytes. UV-irradiated RV16 had no effect on the expression of IL-6, IL-8, IFN-, TNF-, CCL2, CXCL2, and CXCL10 in CM-treated cells. however, slight changes in the expression level of these cytokines might merely reflect random fluctuations when the expression levels were low. CM treatment also stimulated ICAM1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. a markedly increased ICAM1 expression appeared to be a common monocytic response to the CC condition or to CM from epithelial cells. ICAM1 protein in primary PBMC cells was measured by qPCR analysis. ICAM1 protein in THP-1 cells treated with CMp or BM was measured by Western blot analysis. lenti-ICAM1 successfully drove a significant ICAM1 expression in monocytes. lenti-ICAM1\u2013transduced cells successfully drove a significant ICAM1 expression. lenti-shICAM1 dramatically reduced ICAM1 expression. monocytes with ICAM1 knocked down (lenti-shICAM1) were more resistant to RV infection than the control group (lenti-shC) taken together, these observations indicate that ICAM1 is sufficient and necessary for active RV production in monocytes. RV1B, a minor-group RV, was shown to induce eotaxin-1 (28), IL-4 (28), IL-13 (28, 30), CCL2 (31), TNF- (32, 33), CXCL1 (32), IL-6 (32), IFN- (33), and IL-12p40 (33) in mouse macrophages. however, no RV-specific, pathogen-associated molecular pattern that bound and activated TLR2 was identified ICAM1 expression was highly elevated in monocytes cocultivated with epithelial cells or treated with CM from epithelial cells. overexpression or knockdown of ICAM1 confirmed the causal role of ICAM1 in mediating RV16 replication in monocytes. there is no evidence supporting the replication of minor-group RVs in monocytic cells. however, a majority of the studies on minor-group RVs were done in mice or mouse cells. epithelial secretions direct robust RV replication in monocytes via significantly increased ICAM1. this new information will advance our understanding of the interaction between the airway epithelium and inflammatory cells in context of RV infection and disease exacerbation."}
