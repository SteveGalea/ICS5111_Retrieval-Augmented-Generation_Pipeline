{"summary": "the study examined the psychological sequelae related to SARS at 1 month and 3 months after discharge from hospital. the first category included pre-SARS variables: sex, age, education level, family income, availability of emotional support as indicated by the number of persons with whom one could talk and share worries. the second category included parameters for severity of disease and treatment regimen. the total steroid dosage used for treatment ranged from 0 to 86,900 mg. the total steroid dosage used for treatment ranged from 0 to 86,900 mg. 68 (52%) indicated 1\u20132, 41 (31%) indicated 3\u20134, and 16 (12%) indicated 5. IES-R intrusion (mean 1.12, SD 0.73), hyperarousal (mean 1.05, SD 0.79), and HADS anxiety (mean 5.87, SD 3.89) were significantly higher than the 3-month scores for IES-R intrusion (mean 0.91, SD 0.73), F1, 130 = 18.52, p0.001), hyperarousal (mean = 0.85, SD = 0.74), F1, 130 = 13.96, p0.001 and IES-R intrusion IES-R avoidance IES-R hyperarousal HADS anxiety HADS depression M (SD) F M (SD) F M (SD) F History of psychiatric consultation Yes (n = 4) 2.31 (0.80) 17.24 1.71 (0.084) 5.73 2.33 (0.80) 18.70 11.50 (4.12) 8.61 9.50 (5.25) 4.21 No (n = 127) 0.86 (0.68) 0.84 (0.70) 0. the lowest level of SaO2 during hospitalization, the rating for subjective sense of threat, and the number of persons with whom one could talk and share worries were entered into the regression model as predictor variables. the lowest level of SaO2 during hospitalization was the most significant predictor for intrusion and avoidance scores.
