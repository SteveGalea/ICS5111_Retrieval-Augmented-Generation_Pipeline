{"summary": "several diseases and disorders are known to be caused by genetic variation within components of the immune system. a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12979860, in the promoter region of IFN-3 (IL28B) was significantly associated with spontaneous virus clearance and a sustained virological response (SVR) to HCV infection. IFN-: Production, Signalling and Biological Effects IFNs provide the first line of innate immune defence against viruses and intra-cellular bacteria. the type I IFN family (13 subtypes of IFN-, IFN- and the minor IFNs IFN-, IFN- and IFN-) induce expression of ISGs via STAT1 homodimers or STAT1 homodimers. differences in IFN expression, receptor utilisation and subsequent ISG induction suggest they are likely to have complementary roles in host defence against invading pathogens. IFN- family exerts anti-viral activity against a range of RNA and DNA viruses responsible for diverse infections. anti-viral effects suggest a major role for IFN- in the protection of the epithelium from viral infection. IFN-s have been shown to possess pro-apoptotic and anti-metastatic effects in mouse models [39, 40] as well as in human lung cancer cell lines in vitro [41] IFN-s have been shown to have pro-apoptotic and anti-metastatic effects in mouse models [39, 40] as well as in human lung cancer cell lines in vitro [41] GWAS aims to identify genetic determinants of therapy response in HCV patients identified multiple SNPs within the IFN- locus on chromosome 19q13. the minor G allele at rs12980275 and rs8099917 was found to be strongly linked to a failure to clear infection (null virological response; NVR) [5, 6]. the minor G allele at both rs12980275 and rs8099917 was found to be strongly linked to a failure to clear infection. IFN-X4 AG/TT HCV: poor response to PegIFN-/ribavirin treatment (associated with lower rates of viral clearance) AA, S 9, 45 rs11881222 IFN-3 (7.5 kb upstream) G/A HCV: decreased effectiveness of PegIFN-/ribavirin treatment (associated with lower rates of viral clearance) rs12979860 is the strongest predictor of disease outcome in the japanese population. an increased number of TA dinucleotide repeats at rs72258881 in the promoter region of IFN-3 is also strongly linked to a successful viral response in individuals. the high LD observed between rs12979860 and rs368234815 gives the latter SNP limited use as a marker in this population. however, the evidence that the rs368234815 genotype actually provides a better prediction of therapy outcome in Caucasians co-infected with HIV-1 and HCV highlights the difficulties in forming reliable associations between disease and SNPs. the CG rs12979860/rs8099917 haplotype block was found to be associated with HBV seroclearance [55], and both rs12979860 and rs1298025 have been positively linked to response to pegylated IFN- therapy [56, 57] consensus on its role is yet to be reached [59, 60] a recent investigation into the transcriptional regulation of IFN- suggests that the majority of the control occurs within the first kilo base pair upstream of IL28B. it is well established that the risk alleles at these SNPs alter the mRNA and protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, sera and the liver in HCV patients. slated region (UTR) of IL28B, rs4803217, was found to be resistant to post-transcriptional regulation and AU-rich element-mediated decay via HCV-induced miR-208b and miR-499a-5p. current guidelines recommend IL28B genotype testing if the results would influence management plans. infection of retinal epithelial cells by CMV causes retinal damage. reduced IFN-3 expression as a result of this G mutation may contribute to higher replication levels of CMV and an increased likelihood of developing retinitis. genetic variation in IFN-s has also been linked to infection with 2 potentially oncogenic viruses. despite being the major IFN expressed in airway cells in response to infection, little is known about the effect of IFN- SNPs on respiratory infectious diseases. one study exploring the SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 in infants hospitalised with RSV-associated bronchiolitis found no link to the course of clinical infection or viral load. the risk T allele at rs12979860 is overrepresented in a cohort of allergy sufferers. contradictory reports of elevated IFN- levels in asthma patients indicate need for further studies to elucidate the role of IFN- and its polymorphisms in inflammatory disease. the ethnicity-dependent distribution of the protective CC genotype also partially explains the differences in SVR between African Americans and European Americans. such variation in allele frequencies is also likely to contribute to the global variations in \u2018predictor\u2019 genotypes. risk allele at rs12979860 may confer some as yet unidentified genetic advantage to some populations whilst simultaneously rendering others susceptible to chronic diseases such as HCV. this bias was supported by a later study showing a similar rate of spontaneous viral clearance in women with the 'protective' CC genotype. rs12980275, rs8105790, rs8103142, rs10853727, rs8109886 and rs8099917 were found to be overrepresented in patients who failed to respond to treatment. the minor G allele at both rs12980275 and rs8099917 was strongly linked to a failure to clear infection. frame shift expresses IFN-X4 AG/TT HCV: poor response to PegIFN-/ribavirin treatment (associated with lower rates of viral clearance) AA, S 9, 45 rs11881222 IFN-3 (7.5 kb upstream) G/A HCV: decreased effectiveness of PegIFN-/ribavirin treatment. rs12979860 is the strongest predictor of disease outcome in the japanese population. an increased number of TA dinucleotide repeats at rs72258881 in the promoter region of IFN-3 is also strongly linked to a successful viral response in Japanese individuals. rs368234815 genotype gives the latter SNP limited use as a marker in this population. evidence that the rs368234815 genotype actually provides a better prediction of therapy outcome in Caucasians co-infected with HIV-1 and HCV. several SNPs have been studied in HBV patient cohorts. the CG rs12979860/rs8099917 haplotype block was found to be associated with HBV seroclearance [55], and both rs12979860 and rs1298025 have been positively linked to response to pegylated IFN- therapy. a recent investigation into the transcriptional regulation of IFN- suggests that the majority of the control occurs within the first kilo base pair upstream of IL28B. it is well established that the risk alleles at these SNPs alter the mRNA and protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, sera and the liver. the favourable G allele at a second polymorphism in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of IL28B, rs4803217, was found to be resistant to post-transcriptional regulation and AU-rich element-mediated decay via HCV-induced miR-208b and miR-499a-5p. a patient's IL28B genotype is known to be associated with their likelihood of achieving an SVR to pegylated IFN a more recent study in HIV-infected patients found that individuals homozygous for the G mutation at SNP rs368234815 had a higher incidence of developing CMV retinitis. the reduced IFN-3 expression as result of this G mutation may contribute to higher replication levels of CMV and an increased likelihood of developing retinitis. HTLV-1 mono-infected patients in comparison to HTLV-1/HCV co-infected patients. relevance of IFN- polymorphisms and generally a type III IFN response in HTLV-1 infection and associated inflammatory diseases is not clear. surprisingly little is known about the effect of IFN- SNPs on respiratory infectious diseases. risk T allele at rs12979860 is overrepresented in a cohort of allergy sufferers. contradictory reports of elevated IFN- levels in asthma patients [91, 92] indicate need for further studies to elucidate role of IFN- and its polymorphisms in inflammatory disease. this disparity in C allele frequency correlates with the observed clinical differences between these populations. the ethnicity-dependent distribution of the protective CC genotype also partially explains the differences in SVR between African Americans and European Americans. risk allele at rs12979860 may confer some as yet unidentified genetic advantage to some populations while simultaneously rendering others susceptible to chronic diseases such as HCV. there is also evidence for a gender bias with respect to the association between IL28B SNPs and HCV. polymorphisms affecting IFN- expression or signalling have been implicated. many studies have been limited by small sample sizes and small effect sizes. variations in patient characteristics make inter-study comparisons difficult."}
