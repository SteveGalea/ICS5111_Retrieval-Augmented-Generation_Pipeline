{"summary": "lentivirus is closely related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that naturally infects numerous wild and domestic feline species. infection with the domestic cat (Felis catus) strain of FIV results in CD4+ T-cell depletion and pathogenic disease which progresses to AIDS-like immune dysfunction. cellular cytidine deaminase-mediated viral restriction [22\u201325] suggests that cellular restriction likely plays a role in control of PLV infection in domestic cats. previously we have studied whether infection of domestic cats with PLV can impart resistance to subsequent infection with virulent FIV. however, the exact nature of PLV-induced protection remains to be elucidated. the study focused on PLV and FIV infection and innate immune response in multiple infected cat tissues at a later chronic infection timepoint. we found that PLV co-infection altered the magnitude and variability of FIV infection and innate immunity in tissues compared to FIV single infection. results 2.1. multivariate analysis of PLV/FIV co-infection parameters in infected organs. for each organ we determined the following parameters: PLV proviral load (an indicator of residual PLV infection), FIV proviral load (an indicator of residual FIV infection), FIV mRNA load (an indicator of productive FIV infection), and mRNA expression of the cytokines IL-10, IL-12p40 and IFN. provirus and IFN significantly differed between single and co-infected cats for each individual tissue. results for parameters which did not significantly differ between FIV single and PLV/FIV co-infection are available in Supplementary Data. test allowed us to evaluate if provirus, mRNA and cytokines of cats with co-infections were more similar to one another than the same measurement in cats with single virus infections. this suggests that PLV co-infection generally constrains productive FIV infection as indicated by limited variability in FIV mRNA expression across tissues. FIV proviral load was significantly greater in PLV/FIV co-infected cats than in FIV single infected cats in the pre-scapular lymph node, mesenteric LN and ileum. previous PLV infection appeared to increase the ability of FIV to colonize the pre-scapular LN, mesenteric LN and ileum. FIV proviral load (mean SE) among tissues for single and co-infected cats. significant GLM comparisons are indicated by * above bars (see Table 1). presence of FIV provirus indicates ability of the virus to infect cells. PERMANOVA analysis showed a significant difference (p 0.01) between the FIV mRNA single-infected:co-infected ratio and the FIV provirus single-infected:co-infected ratio. mRNA single-infected:co-infected ratio was significantly less than the provirus single-infected:co-infected ratio for liver, pre-scapular LN, ileum and colonic LN. 0.05) are indicated by * and trends (p 0.10) by above bars (see Table 2). Table 2. Inhibition of productive FIV infection in PLV/FIV co-infected cats. viral load from both single and co-infected cats was relatively similar to FIV proviral load in duodenum, jejunum and ileum. however, PLV mRNA transcripts are present in extremely low abundance compared to FIV mRNA transcripts. this suggests that PLV productive infection is inhibited during chronic infection of domestic cats to a significantly greater extent than FIV infection in co-infected cats. permutational based multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) examines the overall distribution and amount of provirus, viral mRNA and cytokines. this test allowed us to evaluate if the overall distribution and amount of provirus, viral mRNA and cytokines differed between single and co-infection. permutational analysis of multivariate dispersion (PERMDISP) evaluates if provirus, mRNA and cytokine loads of co-infected cats were more constrained among tissues than cats with single virus infections. provirus, mRNA and cytokines of cats with co-infections were more similar to one another than the same measurement in cats with single virus infections. /PLV co-infected cats in thymus, spleen and pre-scapular LN. a trend (p 0.1) was observed in duodenum. thus multiple tissues showed a substantially altered innate immune response to FIV attributable to previous PLV infection. FIV proviral load was significantly greater in PLV/FIV co-infected cats than in single infected cats in the pre-scapular lymph node (LN), mesenteric LN and ileum. previous PLV infection appeared to increase the ability of FIV to colonize the pre-scapular LN, mesenteric LN and ileum. significant GLM comparisons are indicated by * above bars. we compared the single-infected:co-infected ratio of FIV mRNA to the single-infected:co-infected ratio of FIV provirus. all possible pair-wise combinations of single-infected:co-infected ratios were first calculated for mRNA and provirus (n = 25 in each case) mRNA single-infected:co-infected ratios were then compared using PERMANOVA, PERMDISP and NMDS ordination plot of single:co-infected ratios. above line indicates greater provirus or mRNA in single than co-infected tissues. significant GLM comparisons are indicated by * and trends (p 0.10) by above bars. RNA transcription (productive infection) appeared to be inhibited by co-infection with PLV. Previously we found that PLV proviral load decreased during chronic infection to almost undetectable levels in PBMC and lymphoid tissue though provirus was detectable at low levels in gastrointestinal tissues. at day 0, two groups were intravenously inoculated with PLV-1695. two groups were sham inoculated with FIV-C. at day 159 post PLV infection, cats were euthanized and tissue samples were collected at 80 \u00b0C. 100 mg tissue was homogenized in RNAproTM Solution and Lysing Matrix D. RNA was then purified, resuspended in 100 L H2O and stored at 20 \u00b0C. cellular RNA was then converted to cDNA using random primers. viral mRNA expression was normalized to mRNA expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for each sample using the 2Ct method. expression of IL-10, IL12p40 and IFN mRNA was quantitated relative to expression of GAPDH mRNA. 20 cats in a specific pathogen-free breeding colony were randomly divided into 4 groups of 5 cats. at day 0, two groups were intravenously inoculated with PLV-1695 and two groups were sham inoculated with FIV-C. at day 159 post PLV infection, cats were euthanized and tissue samples were collected at 80 \u00b0C. RNA extraction and cDNA Synthesis RNA was extracted from tissues using the fastRNA pro green kit (M.P. Biomedicals, Irvine, CA, USA) after extraction, DNA was eluted with 100 L H2O and stored at 20 \u00b0C. the abundance of gag and pol-containing mRNAs during feline lentiviral infection is very similar [32], suggesting that these assays are reasonable for comparing viral mRNA levels of FIV and PLV. qPCR efficiencies were within the accepted range of 90\u2013110%. analysis of data dispersion demonstrated that variability in IFN and FIV mRNA was much more constrained in the co-infected cats than single infected cats. we found that production of FIV mRNA was highly restricted in co-infected cats. the magnitude and variability of productive FIV infection in multiple tissues was broadly inhibited in the face of prior PLV infection. however, most studies of HIV infection in humans are limited to blood samples in which analysis of infection in circulating cells capture only a small fraction of the host infection. co-infected cats detected increased IFN expression at 159 days post-PLV infection. increased IFN expression occurs well beyond the end of apparent active PLV viral replication. previous characterization of FIV proviral load in PBMC of co-infected and single infected cats showed a slight trend toward greater levels of provirus in single infected cats. this finding suggests that several tissues of co-infected cats had significantly higher FIV proviral load than single infected cats. if PLV infection were to limit subsequent FIV infection to a cell type with a longer circulating half-life (i.e., a cell with a memory phenotype) than the cell type preferred in a single infection, it is possible that proviral loads in co-infection could ultimately exceed those of single infection. the exact mechanism underlying this observation is not clear. mRNA transcription in gastrointestinal tissues is severely restricted suggests that PLV genomes are defective and/or there is very effective host control of viral replication. this suggests that FIV replication may also be affected by cellular cytidine deaminase restriction. future studies will be directed at further defining the basis for this protection by examining how cellular subsets in blood and tissues are altered by co-infection. these studies will contribute to a more clear understanding of correlates of protection against lentiviruses."}
