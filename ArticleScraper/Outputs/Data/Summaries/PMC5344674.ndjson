{"summary": "the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has been used as an important model organism for studying biological processes such as development, metabolism, aging, cell cycle and gene regulation. but it was not until the year 2011 that Orsay, the first virus that naturally infects C. elegans in the wild, was discovered. two other nematode viruses, Santeuil and le Blanc, have also been identified. alphanodavirus B2 folds into an -helical structure that dimerizes in solution and binds dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner [16\u201318] a recent study showed that the RNAi pathway plays an important role in the C. elegans antiviral response. the RNAi pathway plays an important role in the antiviral response. the function of the Orsay protein remains a mystery. it was recently demonstrated that during infection could be expressed as a CP- fusion protein. the RNA motif mediating the ribosomal frameshifting is conserved in all three nematode-infecting viruses. CP- fibers are expected to occupy five-fold vertices in the capsid. reverse genetics confirmed that the structural integrity of CP- is essential for Orsay infection. close examination of individual molecules reveals several fine structural details. at one end there is a globular head domain with a diameter of 50-. a second globule, which is slightly smaller, is found at roughly two-fifths of its length. a small globular domain in the middle, and a large globular head at the C-terminus. a quantitative analysis of the CD spectra was done using the program BeStSel [32] which estimated that. each fiber molecule in the TEM images is likely a linear oligomer of that is arranged in either a parallel or an anti-parallel manner. the protein fiber is a parallel oligomer with a C-terminal head domain, because these two protein truncates formed fibrous molecules. sequence in CP- can be translated as a CP- fusion protein by ribosomal frameshifting. the amount of CP- only counts for 5% of the total CP. totiviruses (e.g. yeast LA virus), a group of dsRNA viruses with non-segmented genomes express the viral RNA polymerases as gag-Pol fusion proteins. mini-fusion protein, also called CP-(215\u2013485), is comprised of the CP spike domain, a 29-aa linker, and the first 66 residues of the protein that were predicted to form -helices. the CP spike domain forms trimeric surface protrusions [23], but is not able to oligomerize any further in the absence of the rest of the CP polypeptide. (1\u201366) forms a pentameric helical bundle. it remains to be determined whether the 29-aa linker sequence adopts a specific conformation with a specific function or simply acts as a flexible linker. 3.9 (14.5) Mean I/ (I)* 12.7 (2.2) 31.7 (5.1) Rmerge (%)* 11.8 (43.5) 9.8 (5.1) Phase determination Number of HA sites 5 Figure of merit 0.242 Refinement Rwork/Rfree 20.64/23.14 R.m.s. deviations Bond lengths () 0.008 Bond angles (\u00b0) 0.846 Ramachandran statistics Preferred regions 278 (97.89%) Allowed regions 6 (2.11% longer -helix contains three regular heptad repeats. helix contains amino acid sequences arranged in periodicity of (a b c d e f g) a total of 18 residues have their side chains pointing towards the interior of the channel. it remains to be found whether the Orsay N-terminal helical bundle has specific ligand binding activity like the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. symmetry and shape of the (1\u201366) structure bear some resemblance to a class of pentameric viroporins, such as the small hydrophobic SH protein encoded by human respiratory syncytial virus. the experimental mass of the intact complex is 192214.8 1 Da. there is no indication of the existence of an alternative stoichiometry, including monomer. resolution of the isotopic distribution of the monomer mass spectrum confirms the assigned charge state. this mass of 38440.12 Da is based on the most abundant isotope and fundamentally differs slightly from the average (S4B Fig). we co-expressed CP and CP- in insect cells by co-infection with two baculoviruses each expressing a different protein. the use of two baculoviruses would allow the control of the relative amount of CP and CP- to optimize particle assembly. the most pentameric fibers we observed in a single VLP were seven. it is possible that some fibers were not visible due to staining. (1\u201366) constructs bearing either the K43E or the L44R mutation could no longer form regular pentamers. Fig 6. Site-directed mutagenesis and infectivity assays. only a portion of the structure is shown. ant viruses, one with the K43E mutation and the other with the L44R mutation, were generated on nave worms sensitive to Orsay infection. the percentage of worms with such symptom was drastically reduced with the two mutant viruses. the addition of recombinant in trans inhibits Orsay infection. if CP- functions in viral entry steps such as receptor-binding at the cell surface then adding purified in the culture medium would compete against the virus CP- for such binding sites. ed to a superdex-200 gel filtration column, produced a sharp peak at 58 ml, corresponding to an apparent molecular size of 670 kDa. TEM images showed that forms fibrous molecules of extended length. the length of the fibers was determined to be 41952-. the orsay CP can be divided into three parts, the N-terminal peptide, shell, and the spike domain. on the right are five enlarged aligned in the horizontal direction. the experimental data and the fitting curves are shown in red and blue. a valine-rich region in the middle of the Orsay sequence is known to form regular arrays of -strands in a number of exo/cytoskeleton-related proteins. the region is known to form regular arrays of -strands in a number of exo/cytoskeleton-related proteins including putative insect cuticle proteins and a putative adhesin in Parabacteroides distasonis (PDB ID: 3LJY) fibers measured to be 21530- (n = 96) and 35932- (n = 35) long. the length of these two mutants is roughly proportional to the size of their respective sequence. the large globular head domain was absent from both (1\u2013162) and (1\u2013241). a mini-fusion protein is comprised of the CP spike domain, a 29-aa linker, and the first 66 residues of the protein that were predicted to form -helices. the CP spike domain forms trimeric surface protrusions but is not able to oligomerize any further in the absence of the rest of the CP polypeptide. the length of the midi-fusion protein is about 29329- (n = 66) the length of the midi-fusion protein is about 29329- (n = 66), which is slightly longer than the (1\u2013162) fiber. the presence of the CP spike domain, which is 35- in height according to the structure of the VLP, likely counts for the length discrepancy between the midi-fusion protein and (1\u2013162) crystallographic statistics were able to establish the final structure to 2.2- resolution (Table 1, Fig 3). native (1\u201366) SeMet-substituted (1\u201366) Data collection Wavelength. each (1\u201366) molecule folds into two -helices connected by a 9-aa linker (i.e. residues 21 to 29) each molecule folds into two -helices that are connected by a 9-aa linker (i.e. residues 21 to 29) the longer -helix has a kink at around residue 40. the core of the entire helical bundle is mostly hydrophobic, except for a single location at T14. it has been reported that the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein contains a five-stranded coiled-coil domain with a continuous axial pore. it remains to be found whether the Orsay N-terminal helical bundle has any specific ligand binding activity. a mass consistent with a homo-pentamer was the only major mass observed. this compares favorably to the average mass according to the sum of the relative atomic masses of 192210 Da and to the extremes of isotopic composition of 192187.4 and 192226.5 Da. no intermediates were observed with minimal covalent bond cleavage. this resulted in a protein of observed mass 38441.1 Da which again compares well with the theoretical average mass of a monomer. the absence of alternate stoichiometries further supports the pentamer as the likely near exclusive stoichiometry. a molar mass transformation of this peak resulted in a weight-average molar mass of 191.0 kDa, in excellent agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 192.2 kDa for the pentameric form of this protein. the transformation to absolute molar mass is based on an estimated partial specific volume of 0.740 ml/g. some of the fibers even show a head domain at their distal end. in principle there can be up to 12 copies of the CP- fibers in each capsid. the most fibers we observed in a single VLP were seven. structural integrity of CP- is critical for Orsay infectivity. two residues K43 and L44 were targeted for mutation. both mutations were expected to disrupt the structure of /CP-. arrow indicates the viral concentration used for the protein-competition assay. bars and error bars show mean and standard deviation from three independent trials. recombinant viruses collected from transgenic worm lysate were applied on nave worms sensitive to Orsay infection. a high percentage of worms infected with this mutant virus showed the transparent intestine symptoms. the lack of infectivity from mutants suggested that CP- is required for infection. the lack of infectivity from mutants suggested that CP- is required for infection. the CP- fusion protein plays a specific function in host cell entry during Orsay infection. CP- is incorporated into viral capsid as a minor structural protein. recombinant worm medium reduced Orsay infectivity. the diameter of the -fiber in the Orsay is only 25-, smaller than that of the helical bundle at the tail end. another globular domain, which is smaller in size, is found at the two-fifths position from the N-terminal end. the observation of a globular head at the distal end of the /CP- fibers is consistent with our domain assignment. reovirus 1 fiber protein is organized into three modules: a coiled coil tail domain at the N-terminus, a -filament body domain in the middle, and a C-terminal head domain. the adenovirus fiber does not have a coiled coil region, but also has a head-and-tail morphology with a long shaft made of 20 -spiral repeats. the Orsay CP- forms pentameric fibers the binding of CP- to the host receptor should allow virus attachment to the host intestinal cells for the subsequent cell entry. the cell receptor molecule for Orsay has yet to be determined. it is unclear whether having only 1 to 2 copies of the CP- fiber would negatively impact Orsay\u2019s infectivity. the coding sequence of the full-length Orsay was inserted into a modified pETDuet-1 vector that would add a 6xHis-SUMO tag to the recombinant protein. removal of the fusion tag using the SUMO protease Ulp should leave a dipeptide HM at the N-terminal end of the recombinant protein. midi-fusion protein coding for residues 215\u2013485 of CP- was cloned into modified 6xHis-SUMO pETDuet-1 vector. the recombinant baculovirus was subsequently generated following the Bac-to-Bac Expression System manual. lycerol (v/v), 5 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 1 mM NaN3 and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were first purified by affinity chromatography using the Ni-NTA resin. the eluates were collected and incubated with a SUMO protease (Ulp: His6\u2014SUMO - (1\u201366) overnight at 4\u00b0C for affinity chromatography cell pellets were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sonicated in a cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaN3, 1 mM PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 g/ml DNase, and 15 a number of different protein concentrations ranging from 1 mg/ml to 0.01 mg/ml were prepared simultaneously to optimize particle spread. the grids were then rinsed twice with distilled water and stained with freshly prepared 0.75% Uranyl formate solution for 60 s. the structure of (1\u201366) was determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) the protein model was built with PHENIX Autobuild and COOT [59] and refined with phenix.refine. the final structure contains 284 residues and 197 waters. MS2 ETD 0.1 ms reaction time, Quadrupole isolation of 3300 m/z with a 500 m/z window and 15,000 resolution in an Orbitrap analyzer. these conditions produce effective intact protein complex observation and do not result in substantial dissociation of the non-covalent complex. all data were analyzed with UltraScan-III ver. 3.5, release 2174. hydrodynamic corrections for buffer density and viscosity were estimated by UltraScan to be 1.010 g/ml and 1.036 cP. plasmids pHIP_RNA1 and pHIP_RNA2 were obtained as a gift from Dr. David Wang [5]. plasmids K43E, L44R, and ATGCTG were introduced to the ORF in pHIP_RNA. 50 ng/l mutant pHIP_RNA2, 50 ng/l pHIP_RNA1 and 100 ng/l pRF4 [67] were mixed and microinjected into N2 day-1 adults. glp-4(bn2) worms were used as nave worms because they are sterile at high temperatures. rde-1(RNAi) were used to make the worms sensitive to Orsay infection. the viral product was normalized to ama-1, then normalized to the values of the wild-type recombinant virus. three technical replicates were performed for qRT-PCR, and their average was used as one data point for Fig 6D. c-terminal truncation mutants (1\u201366), (1\u2013101), (1\u2013162) and (1\u2013241) were made by introducing a termination codon at desired sites by PCR using complementary primers. a single nucleotide \u201cA\u201d was inserted in front of the last nucleotide before the stop codon of the CP ORF to shift the ORF to the same coding frame. two baculoviruses were each cloned into pFastBac1. one expressing CP and the other expressing CP-. protein expression and purification For protein expression in E. coli, cells at the phase of exponential growth were induced using 1 mM Isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) midi-fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity followed by gel filtration chromatography. recombinant orsay capsids containing CP- were co-infected with 100 ml of baculovirus expressing CP- and 100 ml of the recombinant baculovirus expressing CP. the cell pellets were washed with cold PBS and sonicated in a cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaN3, 1 mM PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 g/ml DNase, and 15 g/ml RNase. the clarified l of mother liquor containing 1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M MES monohydrate and 12% (v/v) dioxane appeared within 4 to 5 days. crystals were cryo-protected using 25% (v/v) glycerol. mass spectrometry A solution of 10ug/mL of protein complex in 5% ACN, 0.1% FA was directly infused at 3 uL/min with a nano-spray source into an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo) the intact complex was best observed with MS2 ETD 0.1 ms reaction time, Quadrupole isolation of 3300 m/z with a 500 m/z window. isotopic resolution of the intact 192kDa was not possible, nor expected. for isotopic resolution of the monomer the following conditions were used: MS2 with CID 50% Collision energy, 70V Source Fragmentation. the data were analyzed by the 2DSA Monte Carlo analysis to identify particle distributions in the frictional ratio\u2013sedimentation coefficient domain. the distribution suggested that a decreasing sigmoid parameterization is suitable for fitting the data with the parametrically constrained spectrum analysis (PCSA-DS) the calculations were performed on the Lonestar cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin and on Comet and Gordon at San Diego Supercomputing Center. 30 L4 rollers from each stable transgenic line were picked onto a 6-well plate (5 worms/well), and cultured for 5 days at 20\u00b0C. the worms were heat induced at 33\u00b0C for 2 hours and then at 25\u00b0C for 2 days. qRT-PCR was performed using a stereoscope for the transparent intestine phenotype. worms were washed off plates and rinsed four times with S Basal. cDNA was extracted using the RETRO script Kit (Ambion) a plate with over 50% transparent worms was scored as an infected plate. the percentage of infected plates was calculated to measure viral infectivity. state assignment of the intact monomer mass spectrum results in a calculation of the monomeric mass of 38440.12 for the most abundant isotope. this differs slightly from an average mass, but further confirms the previously assigned mass. over 9 independent lines of transgenic C. elegans were screened for infectivity using the transparency test. most lines showed consistent results."}
