{"summary": "Diarrhea in neonatal calves is the leading cause of calf\u2019s morbidity and mortality worldwide. it is a major cause of economic loss due to inefficient feed conversion, reduced live body weight, delay marketing, costly preventive and therapeutic program. several enteropathogens have been incriminated in calf diarrhea. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) may also be referred to as verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) they produce shiga-like toxins (stx1 and stx2) and form A/E lesions. neonatal calves were divided into two main groups: apparently healthy (n = 70) and diarrheic (n=100). animals were then subjected to laboratory and bacteriological examinations. cultural identification of E. coli Fecal swabs from all examined animals were placed in 5 ml nutrient broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. pink colony from macConkey agar was streaked on Eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar medium (Oxoid, Thermo Scientific Uk) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. two drops of saline were put on a glass slide and a portion of the colony from the suspected culture was emulsified with the saline solution. to one suspension, control, one loopful of saline was added and mixed. another loopful of undiluted polyvalent \u201cO\u201d antiserum was added and tilted backward and forward for one minute. PCR was performed according to Fagan et al. (1999) in a total volume of 25 L composed of 12.5L of EmeraldAmpGT PCR Master Mix (Takara Bio Europe, France) and 1M final concentration of both reverse and forward of sta, stx1 and stx2 primers. stx1 (F) 5\u2032ACACTGGATGATCTCAGTGG\u20323 614 Dhanashree and Mallya (2008) stx1 (R) 5\u2032CTGAATCCCCCTCCATTATG\u20323 stx2 (F) 5\u2032CCATGACAACGGACAGCAGTT\u20323 779 stx2 (R) 5\u2032CCTGTCAACTGAGCAGTT\u20323 244 Choi et al. (2001) blood samples were collected from all animals under investigation by means of jugular vein puncture. whole blood samples were analyzed for complete blood picture. swabs were placed in 5 ml nutrient broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. MB positive isolates include indole production test, methyl- red test, Voges- Proskauer test, triple sugar iron test and urease test. set 1 includes polyvalent antisera 1 (O1, O26, O86a, O111, O119, O127a and O128), polyvalent antisera 2 (O44, O55, O125, O126, O166 and O166), polyvalent antisera 3 (O18, O114, O142, O aline was added and mixed to the other suspension. a loopful of undiluted polyvalent \u201cO\u201d antiserum was added. a further portion of it was inoculated onto a nutrient slant. total number of PCR cycles was 30 cycles for stx1 and stx2. reference strains for EHEC were E. coli O157:H7 Sakai (positive for stx1 and stx2) and E. coli K12DH5 (a non-pathogenic negative control strain that does not possess any virulence genes) moderate and severe diarrheic neonatal calves passed thin scanty feces with frequent defecation. moderate diarrheic neonatal calves passed thin to profuse watery feces. mental state was exaggerated in few cases with convulsions. biochemical and serological identification of E. coli Based on results of biochemical tests, 100 were biochemically identical as E. coli (70 diarrheic and 30 apparently healthy calves) 100 random biochemically positive samples (35 from diarrheic and 15 from apparently healthy calves) were further subject to serotyping.
