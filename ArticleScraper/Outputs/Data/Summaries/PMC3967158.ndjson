{"summary": "IB is an acute, highly infectious and contagious disease of domestic chickens worldwide caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of genus Gammacoronavirus, subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae. multiple serotypes of IBVs confer little or no cross-protection against the others. the genetic diversity and viral evolution of IBV are monitored by analysis of the S1 gene because of its high variability and close serotype correlation. pathogenicity of IBV is associated with the spike gene as well as genes outside of the spike gene. change this protein will affect the efficiency of virus particles formation and subsequent transmission of the virus. IB is still a major problem in Guangxi province [15,17], which produces a total of 700 million birds per year. it is very important to know the genetic characteristics of prevalent strains of IBVs in this region. results 2.1. Alignment analysis of nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence identities of the S1, M and N genes among the 23 isolates were 76.1%\u201399.9%. all the isolates had lower nucleotide sequence identities (S1: 76.2%\u201383%; M: 87.9%\u201390.2%; N: 85.7%\u201387.9%) except for GX-NN1 and GX-NN2 (99.5% and 99.7) in the S1 gene, GX-NN1, GX-NN2 and GX-NN5 (99.8%, 99.7% and 99.8%) in the M gene, GX-NN5 ( Isolates GX-NN1 and GX-NN2 showed a close relationship with commonly used vaccine strains H120, H52, Ma5, M41 and other China vaccine strains W93, H94, D41, IBN, HK and grouped as Mass-type. phylogenetic trees of gene (a) S1, (b) M and (c) N of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs), where the 23 IBV strains are marked with filled triangle. no significant evidence for positive selection of S1 protein of Taiwan-type and Mass-type groups was observed (P > 0.05) however, 33.3% (5/15) of the pairwise comparisons of 4/91-type strains and 75.8 % (50/66) of the pairwise comparisons of CK/CH/LSC/99I-type strains were under positive selection (P 0.05) positive selections were identified between any pair of groups in the corresponding genes. percentages of entropy bigger than 0.4 in amino acids sequences of S1, M and N gene were 29.87% (164/549), 6.61% (15/227) and 11.46% (47/410), respectively. the descending average entropy order were S1 (0.2651) > N (0.0953) > M (0.0831) therefore, the S1 gene amino acid sequences had the largest variation; the M gene had less variation than the N gene. of the S1 gene sequence of these five isolates showed high similarity with CK/CH/LSC/99I-type isolate GX-YL2 (98.5\u201399.2%) and 4/91 strain (99.3\u201399.5%), respectively. significantly discrepant topologies of phylogenetic trees supported further recombinant events of them. all the isolates had lower nucleotide sequence identities (S1: 76.2%\u201383%; M: 87.9%\u201390.2%; N: 85.7%\u201387.9%) except for GX-NN1 and GX-NN2 (99.5% and 99.7) in the S1 gene, GX-NN1, GX-NN2 and GX-NN5 (99.8%, 99.7% and 99.8%) in the M gene, GX-NN5 ( phylogenetic trees of gene (a) S1, (b) M and (c) N of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs), where the 23 IBV strains are marked with filled triangle. the bootstrap values were determined from 1000 replicates of the original data. no significant evidence for positive selection of S1 protein of Taiwan-type and Mass-type groups was observed (P > 0.05) however, 33.3% (5/15) of the pairwise comparisons of 4/91-type strains and 75.8 % (50/66) of the pairwise comparisons of CK/CH/LSC/99I-type strains were under positive selection (P 0.05) the percentages of entropy bigger than 0.4 in amino acids sequences of S1, M and N gene were 29.87% (164/549), 6.61% (15/227) and 11.46% (47/410), respectively. descending average entropy order were S1 (0.2651) > N (0.0953) > M (0.0831) therefore, the S1 gene amino acid sequences had the largest variation. both the N-terminal and the C-terminal of the S1 gene sequence of these five isolates showed high similarity with CK/CH/LSC/99I-type isolate GX-YL2 (98.5\u201399.2%) and 4/91 strain (99.3\u201399.5%), respectively. significantly discrepant topologies of phylogenetic trees supported further recombinant events of them. genotypes based on the whole S1 gene are not representative of that based on the whole S1 gene. mutations in non-HVR I of the S1 gene were also detected. the discordance of topology in the S1-based tree and other gene-based trees were also described. IBV has been diagnosed in China since the early 1980s [20], indicating IBV strains within this region are unique and distinct. no Taiwan-type strain occurred in recent year in our study. positive selection was observed on S1 protein of 4/91-type and CK/CH/LSC/99I-type strains, M protein of CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and BJ-type strains, N protein of CK/CH/LSC/99I-type and LX4-type strains. it is the first time to analyze the positive selection of S1, M and N genes of IBVs. the average entropy of amino acid sequences, the percentages of entropy bigger than 0.4 and the number of amino acid sites with high entropy of S1 gene are biggest. the M gene had less variation than the N gene. the variation of amino acids will have an important effect on the biological function and evolution of viruses. the pathogenicity of 4/91-derived recombinants should be assessed in further studies. the pathogenicity of 4/91-derived recombinants should be assessed. the first cDNA strand was synthesized in 25 L mixture consisting of 9 L of RNA extract, 1L of 50 M/L Random 9 mers, 5L of 5 reverse transcriptase first strand buffer, 1 L of 40 U/L RNase inhibitor. mixture was incubated at 42 \u00b0C for 1 h, and then inactivated at 99 \u00b0C for 5 min. the PCR products were purified, cloned and then sequenced by Sangon Bio-company. for each gene, three independent clones were selected randomly and sequenced twice from both directions. the nucleotide sequences of S1, M and N genes have been submitted to GenBank database and assigned accession numbers. codon-based tests of positive selection (Z-test, MEGA5) were used to estimate the number of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS ratio) within the proteins. the window size was adjusted to 40 bp from the default setting 30 bp because IBV has a high mutation rate, which can mask recombination signals. the anticipated amplification segments for M and N genes are 750 bp and 1236 bp respectively. the anticipated amplification segment for M and N genes is about 1760 bp. cDNA, 2.5 L of 10 PCR buffer, 2 L of 2.5 mmol/L dNTPmix. 1 L of 25 mol/L of each primer and 0.25 L of 5 U/L Taq DNA polymerase. PCR conditions for the S1 gene amplification were 94 \u00b0C for 6 min. phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the amino acid sequences of S1, M and N genes with the Neighbor-joining method (Jones-Taylor-Thornton) model and Maximum-likelihood method (JTT) model. bootstrap values were determined from 1000 replicates of the original data. recombination events and recombination breakpoints were further confirmed. multiple IBV genotypes co-circulated; genetic diversity and positive selection existed in S1, M and N genes; 4/91 vaccine recombinants emerged in china."}
