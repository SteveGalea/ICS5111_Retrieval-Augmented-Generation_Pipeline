{"summary": "the world health organization defines AST or ALT1000 units/liter (U/L) as a criterion for severe dengue. we aimed to assess the clinical relevance and discriminatory value of AST or ALT for dengue hemorrhagic fever. liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are common in acute dengue illness, occurring in 65\u201397% of dengue patients. in dengue-endemic countries, dengue is an important cause of acute viral hepatitis [7], [4], [6] and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) retrospectively reviewed for demographic, serial clinical and laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data. cases were categorized using serial clinical and laboratory data from the entire clinical course as dengue fever (DF), DHF, or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) using WHO 1997 classifications. severe dengue includes severe plasma leakage, severe bleeding, and severe organ impairment. we excluded severe dengue due to isolated elevation of AST or ALT1000 U/L from our definition of severe dengue outcome. patients with pre-existing liver diseases were excluded. the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) determines three-month mortality based on following formula: 3.8(log serum bilirubin [mg/dL]+11.2(log INR)+9.6(log serum creatinine [mg/dL])+6.4 [17]. chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables were used to determine statistical significance. by WHO 1997 classification, 38% of patients with DHF/DSS needed close monitoring, while by WHO 2009 classification, 86% of patients with severe dengue required close monitoring. median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR: 3\u20135 days) intravenous fluid was administered to 641 (93%) and platelet transfusion to 86 (12%) death occurred in 1 patient due to pneumonia. median AST values for patients with DF, DHF, and DSS were 83.5 U/L, 92 U/L, and 124 U/L respectively (p0.001) median ALT values were 49 U/L, 53 U/L, and 73.5 U/L (p = 0.001) median ALT values were 49 U/L, 53 U/L, and 73.5 U/L (p = 0.001) median AST values for dengue without WS, dengue with WS, and severe dengue were 84 U/L, 114 U/L, and 147 U/L (p0.001). median ALT values were 56 U/L, 73 U/L, and 97.5 U/L (p = 0.01). median AST values were 105 U/L, 130 U/L, and 129 U/L (p0.001) and median ALT values were 68 U/L, 78 U phase of illness Dengue Dengue with warning signs Severe dengue P value AST, U/L Febrile phase (days 1\u20133) 56.5 (39\u2013107) 68 (48\u2013103) 106 (57.5\u2013167) 0.004 Critical phase (days 4\u20136) 93 (61\u2013158) 108.5 (64\u2013189.5) 143.5 (82\u2013265) 0.004 Convalescent phase (days 7\u201310) 196 (112\u2013227) 278 (171\u2013413) AST = aspartate aminotransferase. U/L = units/liter. AST = aspartate aminotransferase. ALT = alanine aminotransferase. U/L = units/liter. AST = aspartate aminotransferase. ALT = alanine aminotransferase. AUC = area under the curve. ALT = aspartate aminotransferase. AST = aspartate aminotransferase. ALT = alanine aminotransferase. seven patients (1.0%) had severe dengue according to WHO 2009 criteria concurrent with AST or ALT1000 U/L. AST or ALT values were above the ULN but below 1000 U/L. no patients developed acute liver failure under AASLD or King's College criteria. severe dengue (n = 164) P value AST, U/L 83.5 (48.5\u2013153.5) 92 (57\u2013167) 124 (75\u2013244.5) 0.001 ALT, U/L 49 (28\u2013113) 53 (32\u2013100) 73.5 (40\u2013147.5) 0.002 AST = aspartate aminotransferase. U/L = units/liter. all values are expressed as median (interquartile range) median ASTALT ratios for DF, DHF, and DSS were 1.68, 1.68, and 1.88 (p = 0.29) and for dengue without WS, dengue with WS, and severe dengue, they were 1.60, 1.68, and 1.78 (p = 0.10). AST and ALT values were significantly higher for severe dengue compared to dengue with and without warning signs during both the febrile and critical phases but not the convalescent phase. AST = aspartate aminotransferase. U/L = units/liter. all values are expressed as median (interquartile range) AST = aspartate aminotransferase. U/L = units/liter. AST and ALT levels are insufficient to differentiate among the WHO 2009 dengue classifications. the areas under the curve were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.52\u20130.61) and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.51\u20130.59) respectively. median AST values were significantly higher in those with AST1000 U/L: WHO 1997 classifications. AST = aspartate aminotransferase. U/L = units/liter. DF = dengue fever. DHF = dengue hemorrhagic fever. DSS = dengue shock syndrome. two studies in Singapore found liver aminotransferase levels to be significantly elevated among DF and DHF patients [12] and survivors and non-survivors of dengue [24] on univariate analysis. AST and ALT were significantly higher during the febrile phase compared to DF or DSS, and for severe dengue by WHO 2009, AST and ALT were significantly higher during the febrile phase. the etiology of elevated aminotransferase levels during acute dengue illness is unclear. AST is expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, red blood cells, kidneys, brain, and liver. ALT is secreted primarily by the liver [28], [29] because dengue infection can cause acute damage to these non-hepatic tissue types. early diagnosis and proper management may improve outcome in most patients without comorbidities. but in resource-limited countries, patients with severe disease may present late to the hospital with shock, with or without organ impairment."}
