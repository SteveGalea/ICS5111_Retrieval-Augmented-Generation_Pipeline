{"summary": "HCWs (n = 10) experienced in EVD care donned and doffed PPE following unit protocols that incorporate trained observer guidance. a mixture of 6 (enveloped), MS2 (nonenveloped), and fluorescent marker was applied to 4 PPE sites, approximating body fluid viral load. all protocols were approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board. participants had extensive training in the biocontainment unit in the donning, doffing, and use of EVD-specific PPE. most had direct patient care experience with patients with confirmed EVD. ator hood Anteroom Step 13 Sanitize inner gloves Anteroom Step 14 Remove inner gloves using the beaking method Anteroom Step 16 Remove belt, battery, and motor All steps indicating \u201csanitize\u201d use alcohol-based hand rub. simulations took place in the anteroom and patient room of the biocontainment unit used for patient care. the inoculum of 6 and MS2 applied to each site was based on reports of viral load in body fluids during acute phases of EVD [2, 18, 19], as well as nonenveloped viruses such as norovirus. both participants and observer were instructed to close their eyes during application so they were not aware of the exact location of contamination. the HCW then entered the patient room and emptied a urinary catheter bag attached to a mannequin, disposing of the contents in the face was swabbed on each cheek for virus using a polyester swab dipped in eluent. hands were sampled for virus using whole-hand sampling. samples were placed on ice and immediately transported back to the laboratory. MS2 was detected on the inner gloves for most participants (7/10; mean, 8.8 105 PFU; 7% of original inoculum), and on scrubs (2/10; mean, 1.5 103 PFU; 100 PFU; 0.00003% of the original inoculum) most (n = 8) had detection of MS2 at only 1 site, while 2 had virus at 2 sites (inner gloves and either scrubs or hands) a total of 21 surface sites were sampled because fluorescent tracer was visible by examination under UV light. no bacteriophage was detected on any of these sites. previous simulations have shown that hand contamination with a nonenveloped virus is common with standard contact isolation PPE [7] human factors analyses suggest that the mishandling of certain items of PPE during doffing contributes considerably to the probability that a HCW\u2019s gloves, scrubs, and hands become contaminated. when ABHR does not have adequate time to dry after application, it may make gloves slippery and harder to manipulate. if contamination occurs, hand hygiene plays a vital role. defects in hand hygiene may be an important risk factor for HCWs to acquire EVD. the world health organization and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res recommend use of 0.5% chlorine for all hand hygiene events, which has been supported by some data using 6 [29] s causing severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Ebola, are enveloped viruses. the use of MS2 provides a model for possible nonenveloped viral threats. the use of MS2 serves as a very conservative surrogate for measuring the effectiveness of disinfection and hand hygiene steps. there was a low risk of self-contamination with a nonenveloped virus. improved doffing protocols that are highly protective against all types of viruses may need to incorporate changes in the removal process."}
