{"summary": "the use of restrictive measures such as quarantine draws into sharp relief the dynamic interplay between the individual rights of the citizen on the one hand and the collective rights of the community on the other. a final sample of 500 individuals was achieved through standard random-digit dialing. despite the long and controversial history of quarantine, little is known about lay perceptions of and attitudes toward the use of quarantine as a means of infectious disease control. despite the long and controversial history of quarantine, little is known about lay perceptions of and attitudes toward its modern-day use. survey instrument was developed by Toronto Public Health for use in a telephone survey of the general public following the SARS outbreak. respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement/disagreement with each item; the response format was a 5-point Likert-type design (1 = \"Strongly Disagree\" and 3 = \"Neutral\" potential participants were screened for eligibility at the beginning of each call. minimum age of 18 years, primary residence located within the study area during the SARS outbreak, English comprehension skills, and ability to provide informed consent. final sample of 500 individuals was achieved through standard random-digit dialing. study sample was stratified to include an equal number of participants from Toronto and york. there was no age or gender stratification. all participants provided verbal consent over the telephone prior to the survey interview. potential participants screened for eligibility at the beginning of each call. minimum age of 18 years, primary residence located within the study area during the SARS outbreak, English comprehension skills, and ability to provide informed consent. a final sample of 500 individuals was achieved through standard random-digit dialing. no 307 172 479 Yes, myself but nobody else in my home 8 1 9 Yes, not myself but someone else in my home 2 1 3 Total 322 177 499 Table 2 presents the distribution of responses for each of the 15 Likert-type survey items. most respondents indicated agreement (either \"Strongly Agree\" or \"Somewhat Agree\") that sufficient justification exists for the use of quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. during outbreaks 77% 18% 3% 1% 0% Qx is a good way to stop the spread of infectious disease outbreaks 76% 18% 3% 3% 0% If someone is given a Qx order, they should follow it no matter what else is going on in their life at work or home. people who break Qx orders on purpose should face legal penalties like a fine or jail 53% 25% 14% 4% 3% Public Health should be able to lock people up if they fail to obey Q 59% responded that breaking quarantine is most like 'physical assault' 27% chose 'driving above the speed limit' and 8% chose 'parking in a no-parking zone' 4% of participants were personally impacted by quarantine during the SARS crisis. the majority were middle-aged (56%) and female (64%). the majority of respondents were in favour of safeguards against unwarranted and/or inappropriate use of quarantine. the proportion of respondents indicating \"Strongly Agree\" versus \"Somewhat Agree\" varies significantly across the 15 items, as indicated in Table 2. people in Qx 77% 16% 4% 2% 1% Public Health should ensure that people have food and shelter while in Qx, and pay for it with public money if need be 68% 19% 7% 4% 3% Government should pay for counselors and support groups so that people coming out of Qx have someone to talk to about it 43% 29% 14% 9% 6% Safeguards Public Health should ensure that there is no discrimination in the use of Qx 91% 8% 1% 0% 0% a total composite index was computed by summing scores across the four sub-scales. female respondents scored significantly higher than males on the 'Justification' sub-scale. older respondents indicated greater agreement that use of quarantine is justified. a qualitative study of factors influencing compliance with quarantine in Toronto identified 'protection of the health of the community' as a prominent motivating factor. researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the U.S. centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed residents of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and the united states. a conceptual framework for the ethical use of restrictive measures should be considered provisional and, as such, is open to further testing and refinement. the model explicitly contemplates the four primary functions of public health as regards the use of restrictive measures in infectous disease outbreaks. the concept of 'voluntary quarantine' features prominently in many of the current plans for pandemic influenza. there remains a pressing need to engage the citizenry more fully in the process of preparedness planning. there remains a pressing need, however, to engage the citizenry more fully in the process of preparedness planning. public opinion polls have indicated high levels of acceptance of quarantine. a study of factors influencing compliance with quarantine in Toronto identified 'protection of the health of the community' as a prominent motivating factor. the authors partially attributed the observed differences to prior experience with infectious disease outbreaks in which quarantine and other restrictive measures were implemented. the global community of public health experts is itself conflicted about the use of quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. the concept of 'voluntary quarantine' features prominently in many of the current plans for pandemic influenza. there remains a pressing need, however, to engage the citizenry more fully in the process of preparedness planning in order to ensure that the plans reflect the common will. a relatively small proportion of our survey respondents were directly affected by quarantine during the outbreak. authors say public support for quarantine is contingent on the implementation of legal safeguards to protect against inappropriate use and psychosocial support to provide for individuals who are adversely affected. the revising of the manuscript will act as
