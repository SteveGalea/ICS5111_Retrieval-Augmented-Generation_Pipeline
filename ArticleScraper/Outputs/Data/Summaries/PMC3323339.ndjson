{"summary": "the study was part of an ongoing epidemiologic study of viral respiratory infections in children. all respiratory specimens were also screened for parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, influenza A and B viruses, and adenoviruses (10). all RSV-positive children admitted to PICU during this yearlong period were identified. PCR reactions were performed by using HotStar (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and amplification cycles were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 55\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. a clinical severity score was adapted from the severity score described by Martinello et al. (11). power calculations were performed by using PASS 2002 (J. Hintze, NCSS and PASS, Number Cruncher Statistical Systems, Kaysville, Utah) by using a power of 90% and a of 0.05, a sample of 12 patients in each group would be sufficient to support these findings. comparisons were made by using the chi-square test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate. dRSV, respiratory syncytial virus, eDFA, direct fluorescent antibody screen. fCCS, clinical severity score. gPPV, positive pressure ventilation. hND, non-comparable because patients requiring PPV are admitted to the PICU. iHMPV, human metapneumovirus. 3.9%) of 23 PICU patients and 10 of these 17 patients needed it for >5 days. none of the patients screened in either group of RSV-DFA positive patients had evidence of HMPV infection. the observed rate of HMPV in respiratory specimens in our previous study (8.1%) (13) is comparable to rates observed elsewhere (6,14) an increased prevalence of HMPV in Liverpool, UK, may account for the high rate of RSV/HMPV co-infection observed by Greensill et al."}
