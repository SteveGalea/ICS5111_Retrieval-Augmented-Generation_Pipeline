{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) initiated the eradication programme in 1958 and intensified it since January 1967. it is assumed that about 300 million people died of smallpox in the twentieth century alone. the last naturally occurring case was reported in Somalia on 26th October 1977. participants of the inquiry comprised a rare blend of research scholars, students, and clinicians from biotechnology, life sciences, medicine, veterinary, and dentistry who attended a one-day stem cell meeting. the meeting had a quiz, a symposium, and plenary lectures as various components. questionnaire given to the participants of the inquiry on the option of preserving/destroying the variola virus. participants were 200, out of which 23.93% were students in faculty of medicine, 61.59% were from the field of biotechnology and allied basic sciences, 11.59% were from dentistry and 2.89% were from veterinary sciences. the questionnaire had totally 10 questions with ample space provided to express their views on the possibility of preserving/destroying the variola virus. the forms were collected at the end of two hours and the results were analysed. 90% of participants who answered the questionnaire were born in the posteradication era of smallpox. major reasons given by participants to preserve/not to preserve variola virus. major reason quoted was threat of bioterrorism if the virus stocks are preserved. many dangerous viruses can also be misused. the current vaccine stock available with the WHO is only about 0.5 million doses [11], which is insufficient by any stretch of imagination to control an outbreak. there are no back-up laboratories to produce vaccines immediately on a mass scale if any need arises. there have been reports of several adverse effects in laboratory studies of the virus. there currently exists at least two compounds which are considered remedial measures for smallpox. the fully sequenced genome of smallpox virus is also available [18], which can be used to recreate the virus for laboratory drug testing. research in biology for developing newer vaccines, newer antivirus drugs, and diagnostic tests against smallpox requires appropriate live strain of viruses. controversies on lab-bred Avian Influenza viruses throw light on the fact that there are more deadly viruses which can cause accidental outbreaks and can be used for bioterrorism than variola virus. the meeting is a unique gathering of clinicians and basic scientists, in life sciences, under one roof. the basic scientists would have understood the difficulties to recreate the virus artificially after destroying the natural virus. but the recent synthetic biology technologies can use chemically synthesized DNAs to produce a pathogen in the laboratory [27]. this could be one of the explanations to the results wherein most basic scientists have opted for preserving the organism while among the clinicians it is a mixed reaction. majority of the basic science researchers voted for preservation of the variola virus stocks. authors stand in line with the verdict of the majority that the variola (smallpox) virus need to be preserved for future biological research as well as vaccine preparation."}
