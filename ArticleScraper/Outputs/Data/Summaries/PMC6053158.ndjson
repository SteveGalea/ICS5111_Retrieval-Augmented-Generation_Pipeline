{"summary": "bats serve the ecosystem as pollinators, agents of seed dispersal and sources of guano-based fertilizers. the formation of bat guano is an interesting interplay among bats as primary producers, the nutrients present in the food they eat and the biological and environmental changes inside the cave ecosystem. oligotrophic cave-dwelling microbial species have been described as phylogenetically diverse with lineages across the breadth of the bacteria. oligotrophic cave-dwelling microbial species have been described as phylogenetically diverse with lineages across the breadth of the bacteria. high-throughput screening allows the paradigm shift on microbiology and bioinformatics towards modern metagenomics. there have been no reports on the bacterial diversity of guano from the Philippines. there is limited local information in terms of benefits and harmful effects as well as ecological importance. the first guano sample, C1, was collected from a chamber located 50 meters from the cave entrance. patches and pool of powdery guano were collected in between rocks, rock crevices and on pot holes of the breakdown pile of about 3\u20134.5 m high and 3\u20135 m from the ceiling. the second sample, C2, was collected 77 m further up near the flyway of bats. elemental compositions of bat guano C1 and C2 were analyzed semi-quantitatively using handheld X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer. light elements, Silver (Ag), Cadmium (Cd), Tin (Sn) and Antimony (Sb) were removed to normalize the results. bioinformatic and statistical analyses of C1 and C2 guano Data preprocessing and taxonomic classification were carried out in Mothur pipeline. microbial diversity was analyzed using QIIME software [42]. bat guano microbiome C1 and C2 data were compared with published microbiome profiles retrieved from NCBI SRA. good quality sequences, defined as sequences having a length of at least 100 bases, contain homopolymers of not more than 5 bp. non-bacterial OTUs were removed from the dataset. o were collected in between rocks, rock crevices and on pot holes of the breakdown pile of about 3\u20134.5 m high and 3\u20135 m from the ceiling using sterile hand trowel. the second sample, C2, was collected 77 m further up near the flyway of bats. the floor of the site was uneven, made of large boulders and rock formations that holds pool of guano. escence Spectrometer (Delta Professional, Olympus, Japan) dried Guano samples at 105\u00b0C. elemental analysis was done in triplicates. light elements, Silver (Ag), Cadmium (Cd), Tin (Sn) and Antimony (Sb) were removed. Sequencing was performed by Chunlab Inc. (Seoul, Republic of Korea) using a DNA 7500 chip. bioinformatic and statistical analyses of C1 and C2 guano Data preprocessing and taxonomic classification were carried out. all the filtered sequences were merged into a single fasta file. SILVA123_QIIME_release was used as reference to pick OTUs. non-bacterial OTUs were removed from the dataset. bats inside Cabalyorisa Cave were mainly insectivorous and identified as Miniopterus australis, little long-fingered bat or little bent-winged bat. microarthropods included isotomid, sminthurid and an unidentified springtail, Geolaelaps, Oplitis, Deraiophorus, two uropodids and one oribatd mite, and an unidentified brown ant. differences may be a total of 220,152 and 169,161 reads were obtained from two guano samples. a total of 220,152 and 169,161 reads were obtained from C1 and C2 respectively. analysis of within-sample alpha diversity suggests that the bacterial community of C1 and C2 samples exhibited high biodiversity in all tested metrics. Shannon, Simpson, and Chao1 diversity indices suggest adequate sampling of the communities in both samples. the differences between C1 and C2 microbiome profiles were attributed to these factors: a) the physico-chemical properties of guano; b) decaying process or age of the sampled guanos. fourteen genera have relative abundance greater than 1% which is dominated by unassigned Xanthomonadaceae and Mycobacterium. several insects consumed by insectivorous bats harbor harmful bacteria. many members of identified core microbiome of C1 and C2 were uncultured or unclassified. obiotics and other compounds were also predicted. the enrichment of genes related to pathways involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, lipid, and energy were comparablely abundant in C1 and C2 guano microbiome. at least 28 and 22 bacterial phyla were detected in the study of de Mandal et al. (2016) [22]. Proteobacteria (54.2%), Bacteroidetes (24.4%) and Actinobacteria (8.6%) were the most dominant phyla in the CGS sample of de Mandal et al., (2016) [22]. core microbiome of CGS, SRR1793374, C1 and C2 samples shared 27 bacterial genera. majority of the 27 identified core genera are from Actinobacteria, 12, and from Proteobacteria, 11. differences can be explained by origin, host bat species and its diet, duration of the decaying process or age of the guano. herbivorous and reproductively active bats carried more diverse microbiota than carnivorous. Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan Mabini is a third-class municipality located in the Western district of the Province of Pangasinan. the municipality lies at about 15\u00b055\u201900\u201d and 16\u00b052\u201900\u201d longitudes and about 119\u00b056\u201900\u201d and 120\u00b004\u201900\u201d latitudinal lines. the town was formerly named Balincaguin because of its numerous karstic and limestone caves. XRF spectrophotometric analyses of C1 and C2 samples revealed significant differences in the composition of both the major and trace elements. guano had high levels of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ti and Cu while C2 samples yielded high concentrations of Ca, P, S, Zn and Cr. a total of 220,152 and 169,161 reads were obtained from two guano samples. valid reads for C1 and C2 were assigned to 12,435 OTUs. 104,764 and 87,379 valid reads were obtained for C1 and C2 respectively. effective genus number was calculated as a function of the natural exponent raised to a Shannon entropy value. C1 was computed to have an effective genus number of 11.33, while C2 effective genus number was 2.04. the bacterial diversity at genus level in C1 is five times higher compared to C2. guano samples harbored potentially pathogenic genera such as burkholderia, corynebacterium, Francisella, Legionella, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Rickettsia. guano may act as source of microorganisms that could potentially be pathogenic to humans and animals. ylobacter species and several enteric pathogens were uncultured or unclassified. many members of identified core microbiome of C1 and C2 were uncultured or unclassified. pathways involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, xenobiotics and other compounds were also predicted. bat guano microbiome have been reported from composite guano collected on the cave floor and on fresh and decaying guano. analysis of C1 and C2 microbiome data along with previous data from NCBI GenBank database revealed differences in terms of composition and relative proportion of bacterial communities. core microbiome of CGS, composite guanos, and C1 and C2 showed 35 core OTUs. major phyla common to all samples are Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria, and Saccharibacteria. other genera include Telmatobacter (from Acidobacteria), uncultured Chloroflexi, Leptospirillum (Nitrospirae) and an uncultured Saccharibacteria. a number of genera in the core microbiome, such as Streptomyces and Actinomyces, were known to have pathogenic species. dietary overlap among frugivorous and insectivorous bats explained the similarities in gut microbial communities. microbiome profiles observed in fresh and decaying guano may have been affected by the age of the guano or by the decaying process dependent on physical and environmental factors. the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria may impose health hazards to local folks harvesting guano for agricultural purposes. the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria may impose health hazards to local folks harvesting guano."}
