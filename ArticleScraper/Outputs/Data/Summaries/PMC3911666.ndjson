{"summary": "coVs are found in a wide variety of animals, in which they can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of various severities. on the basis of genotypic and serological characterization, coVs were traditionally divided into three distinct groups (1\u20133). a novel human CoV (HCoV) of the genus Alphacoronavirus, HCoV-NL63, was reported in 2004 (12, 13), and the identification of SARS-CoV a novel genus, Deltacoronavirus (19\u201327) has emerged as a cause of severe respiratory infections associated with high rates of mortality (28\u201330) a novel CoV, named Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has emerged as a cause of severe respiratory infections associated with high rates of mortality (28\u201330) a total of 18 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), 20 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and 7 harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) were tested in this study. RNA was extracted using a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin), 200 M each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 1.0 U Taq polymerase. the mixtures were amplified by 60 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 48\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. cDNA was amplified by degenerate primers designed by multiple alignments of the genomes of other CoVs with complete genomes available. additional primers were designed from the results of the first and subsequent rounds of sequencing. sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce final sequences of the viral genomes. porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV; DQ811787), mink coronavirus (MCoV; HM245925), mink coronavirus (PRCV; DQ811787), miniopterus bat coronavirus 1A (Mi-BatCoV 1A; NC_010437), miniopterus bat coronavirus 1B (Mi-BatCoV 1A; NC_010437), human coronavirus 229E ( rabbit coronavirus HKU14 (RbCoV HKU14; JN874559), rabbit coronavirus HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4; NC_009019), Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5; NC_009020), MERS-CoV; JX869059, SARS-related human coronavirus (SARS-CoV; NC_00 virus HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15; JQ065042), white-eye coronavirus HKU16 (SpCoV HKU16; JQ065044), sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (SpCoV HKU17; JQ065044), magpie-robin coronavirus HKU18 (MRCoV HKU18; JQ065046), night-heron coronavirus HKU19 (NHCoV HKU19; primers 5\u2032-TACAGCTAGCATGGCCTCTACATCGGGAAAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCATGCTAGCTTAAGACCATTCAAG-3\u2032 were used to amplify the gene encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein of BdCoV HKU22. sequence coding for amino acid residues 1 to 380 of the N protein was amplified and cloned into the NheI sites of expression vector pET- the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) for each coding region between each pair of strains were calculated using the Nei-Gojobori method (Jukes-Cantor) in MEGA (v5) (33). a root-to-tip genetic distance determined from a maximum likelihood tree was plotted against the year of sampling using the PhyML program (37). RNA was extracted from the respiratory, fecal, and blood samples using a QIAamp viral RNA minikit. the RNA was eluted in 60 l of AVE buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and was used as the template for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) the PCR products were gel purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit. both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer. sequences of the PCR products were compared with known sequences of the RdRp genes of CoVs in the GenBank database. sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce final sequences of the viral genomes. the nucleotide sequences of the genomes and the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) were compared to those of other CoVs using the EMBOSS needle program. miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (Mi-BatCoV 1B; NC_010436), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E; NC_002645), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63; NC_005831), Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU10 (Ro-BatCoV HKU10; JQ989270), Hipposideros bat coronavirus HKU MERS-CoV; NC_004718; MERS-CoV; NC_004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 004718; 00 cDNA was amplified with a fastStart DNA Master SYBR green reagent kit. 20 l of reaction mixtures containing 2 l cDNA, 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.25 M forward and reverse primers (5\u2032-CTGCTTATGCCAACAGTGCTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AAGTCCATATCGGGCTTAT-3\u2032) were thermal cycled at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 the sequence coding for amino acid residues 1 to 380 of the N protein was amplified and cloned into the NheI sites of expression vector pET-28b(+) in frame and downstream of the series of six histidine residues. the recombinant N protein was expressed and purified using an Ni2+-loaded HiTrap chelating system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) total of 193 samples, including 58 respiratory, 31 blood, and 104 fecal samples, were obtained from Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, California sea lions, and harbor seals. no positive results were obtained from any of the California sea lions and harbor seals tested. the amounts of BdCoV HKU22 RNA ranged from 1 103 to 1 105 copies per ml in the three fecal samples positive for CoV. the sizes of the three genomes of BdCoV HKU22 were 31,750 to 31,759 bases, and their G+C contents were 39%.

Gammacoronavirus also contains the species Avian coronavirus. the species includes alphacoronavirus, betacoronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses. despite their close relationships, BdCoV HKU22 and BWCoV SW1 represent two CoVs that probably use different receptors in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins and white beluga whales. there is a more than 25% difference between the amino acid sequences of the S protein in BdCoV HKU22 and that of BWCoV SW1."}
