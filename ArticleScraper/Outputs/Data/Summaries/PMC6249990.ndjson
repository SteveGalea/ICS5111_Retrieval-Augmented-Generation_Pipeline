{"summary": "whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been championed as the inevitable future of diagnostics in multiple reviews and opinion pieces dating back to 2010 1, 2, 3, 4. common applications of WGS in diagnostic microbiology include isolate characterization, antimicrobial resistance profiling, and establishing the sources of recurrent infections and between-patient transmissions. g-informed strain identification could be of particular significance for bacteria with large accessory genomes. g2 has acquired one point mutation (small black line) in one of the genes of the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) typing. all three strains share two plasmids (red and blue) carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) elements (shapes), and G1 has an additional private plasmid (purple) the schematic grouping of these three strains based on MLST typing. several tools have been developed for the prediction of resistance profiles from WGS. these include those designed for prediction of resistance phenotype from acquired AMR genes. tools include ResFinder [10] and ABRicate (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) and CARD [12]. there are over 2000 described -lactamase gene sequences responsible for multiresistance to -lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. -lactam resistance in some pathogens, including S. pneumoniae, can be predicted through penicillin-binding protein typing. the majority of efforts to predict phenotypes from bacterial genomes have been on AMR profiling. some tools have been developed for multispecies virulence profiling. virulence is often a context-dependent trait. WGS can reveal which isolates are part of an outbreak lineage. timed phylogenies can provide likely time-windows on inferred transmissions. approaches based on transmission chains can also be used to identify sources of recurrent infections (so called \u2018super-spreaders\u2019) in some cases insufficient genetic variation will have accumulated over the course of an outbreak, and a transmission chain simply cannot be inferred without this signal 57, 58. a \u2018one-size fits all\u2019 bioinformatics approach to outbreak analyses simply does not exist. surveillance initiatives have the potential to identify the likely geographic origin of emerging pathogens and AMR genes. WGSA allows the upload of genome assemblies through a drag-and-drop web browser. at the time of writing WGSA comprises 20 649 genomes predominantly from S. aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. a draft bacterial genome can currently cost less than 1 USD to generate [62] raw sequencing costs have dropped over time but the True Sequencing Cost Per Bacterial Genome Has Stabilised. the cost is based on our calculations for the output and consumable costs for the 454 GS Jr and Illumina Miseq 2 150. eq platform in 2011, new sequencing kits generating higher output have only marginally affected true microbial genome sequencing costs. these costs have remained stable over time and are unlikely to go down significantly in the near future. economic theory predicts price decrease will not favor price decrease. WGS is more appealing as a microbiological fast diagnostics solution when combined with procedures that circumvent (or shorten) the traditional culture step. such enrichment methods are a particularly tractable approach for viruses due to their small genome size. the removal of the culture requirement can drastically reduce turn-around time from sample to data and enable identification of both rare and novel pathogens. different samples however present different challenges. easy-to-collect sample sites can be challenging to distinguish the etiological agent of disease from colonizing microbes. genetic material from the human patient present in clinical samples represents contamination, a major obstacle to obtaining a high yield of microbial DNA. microbially focused clinical metagenomics cannot be avoided by introducing human WGS into routine healthcare. metagenomic samples from multiple body sites can be used to identify individuals in datasets of hundreds of people [73]. Managing clinical metagenomics data should be taken seriously, not only as a barrier to implementation but because of the real risks to patient privacy. analysis pipelines for microbial genomics have generally been developed for fundamental research or public health epidemiology. a user requires in-depth knowledge about the purpose each tool serves, the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and a functional understanding of the important parameters. sophisticated phylogenetic inference could be omitted from a default pipeline. a clinical pipeline would only encompass a small subset of the research pipeline aimed at generating rapid and interpretable output. a correlation between pairwise genetic distance and sampling date could be performed to test for evidence of temporal signal in the data. the lack of uptake of WGS-based diagnostics may also be due to an understandable desire to maintain the \u2018status quo\u2019 in a busy hospital environment with already established treatment and intervention systems. the main proponents of WGS tend to be based in the public health/research environment and are rarely actively involved in clinical decision-making. there is a genuine risk that precious knowledge in basic microbiology will be lost after the transition to WGS in clinical microbiology. there is also a genuine risk that precious knowledge in basic microbiology will be lost after the transition to WGS. the availability of extensive genomic data has been instrumental in the development of routine non-WGS typing schemes. can clinical metagenomic data be managed safely in line with ethical considerations applicable to identifiable human DNA\" can current expertise in traditional clinical microbiology be maintained in the transition to WGS\""}
