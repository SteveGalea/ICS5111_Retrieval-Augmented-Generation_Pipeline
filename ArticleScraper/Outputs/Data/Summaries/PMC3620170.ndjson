{"summary": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Coronavirinae [1]. in 2002\u20132003, the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) renewed the interest in this group of viruses. nsp1 is the first mature viral protein expressed in the host cell cytoplasm. exogenous expression of MHV nsp1 in mammalian cells inhibited cell proliferation. nsp1 may participate in multiple stages of the coronavirus life cycle. sequence alignment of nsp1 from SARS-CoV and MHV-A59. conserved amino acids are indicated in the middle line. a region (LLRKxGxKG: amino acids 191\u2013199) in nsp1 that is conserved in different coronaviruses, such as MHV. the plaque morphology of MHV-nsp1-27D was the same as that of WT MHV-A59. both mutant and WT viruses began to replicate at 8 h post-infection (p.i.) both mutant and WT viruses began to replicate at 8 h post-infection (p.i.) and reached maximal titers at 12 h p.i. mutant virus MHV-nsp1-27D was infected intracranially (200 or 2104 pfu/mouse) with either MHV-nsp1-27D or MHV-A59. all mice infected with MHV-nsp1-27D by the intracranial route survived the 14-day observation period. mice infected intracranially with MHV-nsp1-27D or MHV-A59 began to die at day 5 p.i. 33% (2 of 6) of the mice infected with virus at 200 pfu/mouse died on or before day 9 p.i. all the mice (6 of 6) infected with virus at 2104 pfu/mouse died on or before day 7 p.i. hepatitis is the first clinical sign of disease after MHV infection. serum ALT levels may be used as a marker for MHV-induced acute hepatitis. MHV-nsp1-27D is highly attenuated in vivo. titers in the liver (E) and spleen (F) were measured at the indicated time points. to exclude the possibility that a reduced replicative capacity of the mutant virus may have resulted in a delayed hepatitis, ALT levels were also measured for a longer period of time. hepatocytes showed unclear borderlines and increased gaps on day 8. this was restored to a normal state on day 15. no evidence of hepatic damage was evident at this time point. titers can replicate in secondary lymphoid organs, and is strongly attenuated in vivo. groups of C57BL/6 mice were either immunized with MHV-nsp1-27D or treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control. mice were challenged with 5106 (A) or 2104 (B) pfu/mouse of WT MHV-A59. deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region reduced the inhibition of MHV nsp1 on different promoters. some viruses indirectly antagonize the antiviral response. expression of MHV-nsp1-27D significantly decreased luciferase activity by about 2-fold (P0.01) for the CMV promoter, 1.5-fold (P0.01) for the SV40 promoter and 1.5-fold (P0.01) for the ISRE. deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region attenuates this effect. plasmids, pcDNA3.1-nsp1 or pcDNA3.1-nsp1 mu were stimulated with NDV. the levels in the supernatant were decreased (130.8 pg/ml and 122.4 pg/ml) compared with cells transfected with control pcDNA3.1 (149.9 pg/ml) nsp1-coding region of MHV-nsp1-27D was sequenced after five passages in tissue culture. sequence analysis showed no nucleotide changes were detected. genome is a 29.7-kb positive-sense RNA molecule. 17Cl-1 cells were infected with MHV-A59 or MHV-nsp1-27D. samples of culture medium were obtained at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 h p.i. each time point indicates the mean titer and standard deviation obtained from a triplicate series of infections. mice were infected intracranially (A, B) or intraperitoneally (C) with the indicated dose of MHV-nsp1-27D or MHV-A59. each time point represents the mean data from at least five individual mice. mice infected with MHV-nsp1-27D began to die at day 2 p.i. 87.5% (7 of 8) of the infected mice had died. MHV-nsp1-27D or MHV-A59 at concentrations of 50, 5103 or 5106 pfu/mouse. serum ALT levels increased at day 5 from 50 to 260 IU/L with virus at 50 pfu/mouse, and from 20 to 500 IU/L with virus at 5103 pfu/mouse. MHV-nsp1-27D is not capable of inducing hepatitis in mice significantly, in contrast to MHV-A59. both viruses replicated in the spleen and liver, but MHV-nsp1-27D titers were consistently lower than those of MHV-A59. hepatocytes showed unclear borderlines and increased gaps on day 8. the liver of the MHV-WT infected mice showed obvious lesions on day 5. in MHV-nsp1-27D infected mice, the hepatocytes showed unclear borderlines and increased gaps on day 8. MHV-nsp1-27D is strongly attenuated in vivo, but retains the ability to replicate in secondary lymphoid organs. mice were challenged with MHV-nsp1-27D by the same route. the mortality determined 14 days post-challenge. the results showed that 70% of the mice died on or before day 7. a recent report suggested that SARS-CoV nsp1 suppressed host cell gene expression. the activity of the reporter gene, luciferase, was assessed. co-expression of MHV-nsp1-27D significantly reduced luciferase activity. MHV nsp1 and nsp1-27D reduce expression of reporter genes controlled by different promoters. nsp1 and nsp1-27D were without significant effect on IFN-\u00df expression in L929 cells expressing either nsp1 or nsp1-27D. MHV is a group II coronavirus that has long been used as a tool for studying coronavirus biology and pathogenesis in vivo. a mutant of MHV-A59, with a deletion of 99 nucleotides in the C-terminal portion of nsp1 (nts: 829\u2013927), was found to replicate with similar kinetics and to a similar titer as WT virus in vivo. LRKxGxKG is a relatively conserved domain, LRKxGxKG (L191-G199) the amino acids deleted in this study were included in the region K124-L241, which has been reported to have no effect on virus replication. the deletion of LRKxGxKG region would not be expected to cause instability of NSP1. MHV-nsp1-27D is strongly attenuated in vivo, but retains the ability to replicate in secondary lymphoid organs. this strongly suggests that the mutant virus, MHV-nsp1-27D, has potential for use as an attenuated live vaccine. both MHV-nsp1 and nsp1-27D were expressed in cultured cells. 17Cl-1, L929 (mouse fibrosarcoma), CV-1 (monkey kidney fibroblast), BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) and HeLa-D980R (human cervical) cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5\u201310% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 5% tryptose vMHV-inf-1 nsp1 gene was first replaced by pGPT-in-nsp1 gene. plasmid contains GPT gene flanked to its left by MHV-A59 nts 1\u2013446, and to its right by MHV-A59 nts 856\u20131310. clones were selected by three rounds of plaque purification on CV-1 cells in the presence of xanthine, hypoxanthin p1-27D DNA was electroporated into BHK-MHV-N cells. cells were mixed with a four-fold excess of 17Cl-1 cells. recombinant coronaviruses were plaque purified three times. a single plaque was used to produce a virus stock. serum was used for measurements of ALT levels using a Hitachi 747 autoanalyzer. images were acquired using an OLYMPUS BX61 microscope. groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 6 or 8) were infected with different doses of mutant MHV-nsp1-27D. luciferase reporter plasmid, p(-110-IFN-)-CAT, was used for monitoring IFN- promoter activation. reporter plasmids, pRLuc-CMV and pGL3-control were used to monitor activation of the interferon-stimulated response element. induction with NDV was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. data were analyzed using the paired Student's t-test. p-value of 0.05 was considered to be indicative of statistical significance. recombinant mutant viruses based on vaccinia virus, vMHV-inf-1. nsp1-27D (nsp1 with deletion of nts 780\u2013807) amplified by overlap PCR. vMHV-inf-1 nsp1 gene was first replaced by Escherichia coli guanine-phosphoribosyl-transferase. vMHV-nsp1-27D was rescued from cloned cDNA using purified, EagI-cleaved vaccinia virus vMHV-nsp1-27D DNA. recombinant mutant MHV-nsp1-27D virus was rescued from cloned cDNA using purified, vaccinia virus vMHV-nsp1-27D DNA. viral titers and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were determined using a plaque assay. mice were infected with different doses of WT MHV-A59 or mutant MHV-nsp1-27D. blood was incubated at RT to allow coagulation to occur. mice were infected with a low dose of mutant MHV-nsp1-27D. the mice were monitored for clinical symptoms and death. the mice were challenged with a high dose (5106 pfu/mouse) of MHV-A59. at 18 h post-transfection, the cells were induced with either NDV (16 HAU/well) or 2000 U/ml hIFN- (Sigma, Shanghai, China), or were left un-induced. luciferase assays were performed using the CAT ELISA kit."}
