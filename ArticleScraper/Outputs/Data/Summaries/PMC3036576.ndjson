{"summary": "rt-PCR and reverse transcription (RT) PCR techniques are rapid and versatile diagnostic procedures broadly used in clinical virology where there are mostly considered as diagnostic \u201cgold standards\u201d [1]. commercial kits including such control systems are being increasingly improved for the molecular diagnosis of a number of pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis viruses, influenza viruses etc. external controls (ECs) Important criteria for design include (i) the possibility to use quantified or semi quantified controls (in order to manage the detection level of the diagnostic test used), (ii) the possibility to distinguish amplicons obtained from ECs from those obtained from the detected pathogen (in order to detect false positives due to accidental amplification of EC) e MS2 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC ref. 11303-B4 & 15597-B1, respectively) protocols for real time PCR detection of phages TA and MS2 were elaborate in various formats. rt-PCR detection was evaluated by comparing detection of enterovirus (EV) and CMV in serial dilutions of cell culture supernatant media. positive clinical samples spiked with T4-MS2 mix in either two-step or one-step rt-PCR format. a total of 8,950 clinical specimens received in the virology laboratory of the Public Hospitals of Marseille with a demand of PCR detection for at least one of the viruses listed in Table 1 were included in the approval of the relevant Ethics Committee (IFR48, Marseilles, France) was obtained for investigating the benefit of using phage spiking. a 200l volume of each 8,950 clinical specimens was spiked (according to the procedure described above) before extraction. rt-PCR reactions were performed for RNA viruses using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents kit (Roche) and random hexanucleotides as per manufacturer's instructions. rt-PCR reactions for detection of T4 or MS2 were performed under a 15 L reaction format. external controls (ECs) Important criteria for design of ECs include (i) the possibility to use quantified or semi quantified controls (in order to manage the detection level of the diagnostic test used), (ii) the possibility to distinguish amplicons obtained from ECs from those obtained from the detected pathogen (in order to detect false positives due to accidental amplification of EC) real time PCR detection of phages TA and MS2 were elaborated in various formats. primers and probes targeting phages TA and MS2 were designed from genomic sequences. a suspension of phages was used for spiking clinical samples. rt-PCR detection was evaluated by comparing detection of enterovirus (EV) and CMV in serial dilutions of cell culture supernatant media. positive clinical samples spiked with T4-MS2 mix in either two-step or one-step rt-PCR format. protocols for real time PCR detection of phages TA and MS2 were elaborate in various formats. oligonucleotide concentrations were 10pmol for primers and 4pmol for probes for both T4 and MS2 detection assays. both phages were diluted to provide a similar level of detection by rt-PCR. influence of spiking on performance of viral nucleic acid extraction was evaluated by comparing detection of enterovirus (echovirus 30) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) [10] J Clin Microbiol 2001 Human Herpes Virus 6 (HHV6) Locatelli et al.

[17] J Clin Microbiol 2001 Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) Van El a 200l volume of each 8,950 clinical specimens was spiked. rt-PCR reactions were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. rt-PCR reactions for detection of T4 or MS2 were performed. if the Ct value was equal to or lower than the mean Ct value of the series +1SD, it was recorded as \u201ccorrect detection of the phage\u201d (IDP) it was associated with the absence of detectable inhibitor or technical problem while processing the corresponding sample. negative results were considered unresolved (UNR). et al.

[13] J Clin Microbiol 2001 Parvovirus B19 Abeham et al. rt-PCR reactions were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. rt-PCR reactions for detection of T4 or MS2 were performed under 15 L reaction format. the mean Ct value and the standard deviation within the series were calculated. IDP was associated with a positive PCR (detection of a pathogen) a new assay was performed using a tenfold dilution of the nucleic acid extract. positive results were validated. MV (a) or EV (b) cell cultures unspiked (A) or spiked (B) with T4-MS2 IC were presented here. each sample was tested in triplicate. the Wilcoxon test were used to compared Ct values (NS = non significative) results represent the number of PCR tests performed for each type of samples. samples with less than 10% of IDPs are highlighted in yellow, between 10 and 30% of IDPs in orange, between 30 and 50% of IDPs in pink and more than 50% of IDPs in red. the presence of phage-specific primers and probe in the reaction mix (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.77 for CMV and 0.18 for EV) did interfere with the Ct value associated with viral detection in two-step (Table 2 and 3) and One-step rt-PCR. each sample was tested in triplicate (the mean value was calculated) -MS2 IC were tested either with the CMV or EV detection system alone (A) or the multiplex system (B) each sample was tested in triplicate (the mean value was calculated) the Wilcoxon test were used to compared Ct values (NS = non significative) 8.950 clinical samples were spiked with phages. IDPs were significantly more frequently detected for MS2 (RNA) than T4 (DNA) in plasma, BAL and stools. Conversely, IDPs were significantly more frequently detected for T4 than MS2 in stools. samples were spiked with both T4 and MS2 phages, allowing the detection of inhibitors for both DNA and RNA viruses. the use of phages as internal controls proved extremely versatile and could be adapted to a broad range of methods and pathogens. specific samples such as heparinized blood (72,9% of inhibitors for DNA virus detection), bone marrow (73.8% of inhibitors for DNA virus detection) and stools (36.6% and 20.8% of inhibitors for DNA and RNA viruses detection, respectively) may also benefit from the detection of inhibitors and the identification of \u201cunresolved\u201d tests. a detailed analysis may reveal that specific techniques give better results when used for testing specific samples.
