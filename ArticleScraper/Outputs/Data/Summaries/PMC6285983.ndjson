{"summary": "no effective antiviral strategies are yet available for viruses causing chronic infections such as HBV [2], as well as for tropical viruses like dengue virus that is causing 390 million infections per year. despite the huge effort to find antivirals, the research community was not able to execute in time an efficient antiviral plan. in this scenario, the possibility to find antiviral molecules directed against viral envelopes is of particular interest in order to identify broad spectrum antiviral drugs. virolytic antiviral peptides derived from mastoparan were shown to inhibit different enveloped viruses acting on the envelope and causing its detachment from the viral core [14]. virolytic antiviral peptides derived from mastoparan were shown to inhibit different enveloped viruses acting on the envelope and causing its detachment from the viral core. evenagel condensation with aldehyde 4 or 6 in refluxing acidic EtOH led to compounds 15a and 15b. rhodanine derivatives belonging to this series of compounds are potential microbicide active against HIV-1 and HSV-1/2. compounds were tested with a plaquing efficiency assay, preincubating with the virus for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. compound 9d showed a potent antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested at not cytotoxic doses. compound 9d retained its antiviral activity also against HSV-2 acyclo. type of virus EC50* [nM] (95% C.I.#) EC90\u00b0 [nM] (95% C.I.#) CC50 [M] SI Enveloped HSV-2a 1.60 (1.54\u20131.66) 24.3 (18.7\u201331.5) 2.09 1306 Enveloped HSV-1 2.18 (0.91\u20135.20) 35.1 (6.70\u2013184) 2.09 958.7 Enveloped HCMV 4.22 (2.89 d was added on cells before the virus in order to determine if the antiviral activity was due to an interaction with the cells. results showed that the antiviral activity of 9d is not due to an interaction with cells, since the compound was not active in pre-treatment assays. we observed a significant reduction of activity in the during-infection assay (EC50 = 0.147 M) suggesting that the loss of activity could be related to a competition between the viral envelope and the cell membrane. ants and cells were harvested and subsequently titrated with plaque assay. percentage of infection was calculated comparing viral titer in treated wells and wells treated with equal volumes of solvent. viral titers were calculated at dilutions of compounds at which, in plaquing efficiency assay, did not show any inhibitory activity. the percentage of infection was calculated comparing viral titer in treated wells and wells treated with equal volumes of solvent. cells were subjected to qPCR (A) or immunostaining (B) or IF (C) subsequently cells were fixed and subjected to ICC (D) or IF (E).

NH2NH2; iii. compound 9d has a broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses. it showed a potent antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested at not cytotoxic doses. compound 9d retained its antiviral activity also against HSV-2 acyclovir resistant strain. the antiviral activity is directed to the virus rather than the cell, but is maintained in post-treatment assays. we observed a significant reduction of activity in the during-infection assay (EC50 = 0.147 M), if compared to the pre-incubation assay. compound 9d was added on cells 2 h before infection (PRE-TREATMENT CELLS) and subsequently the inocula were removed. cells were fixed and stained 24 h later and plaques were counted. percentage of infection was calculated comparing wells to wells treated with equal volumes of solvent. 105 pfu of HSV-2 were incubated for 0, 15\u2019, 30\u2019, 45\u2019 or 60\u2019 at 37\u00b0C with 10 M, 5 M or 1 M of compound and subsequently titrated on Vero cells. in this condition the infectivity was not regained further verifying the permanent virucidal activity. the compound is not altering viral binding capability, differently from heparin, a known attachment inhibitor [16]. with this assay, the signal from the virus could be related to virus in the cytoplasm or blocked in the endosomes. the treatment with acidic glycine is affecting only the virus at the surface of the cell. compound 9d is a model lipid substrate, incorporated in a DPPC liposomes. the lipid peroxidation was evaluated by monitoring the production of the lipid degradation end-product malondialdehyde. the results of the TBA assay suggest the peroxidant activity of the compound. a broad-spectrum activity against a panel of seven enveloped viruses suggests a mechanism of action on the viral envelope that is affecting viral and cell membrane fusion. this is of particular interest if we consider that all the recent epidemics of emerging and re-emerging viruses are caused by enveloped viruses. the contents of the vessel were stirred by a rotating magnetic plate and a teflon-coated magnetic stir bar. all experiments were performed using a stirring option, whereby the contents of the vessel were stirred by a rotating magnetic plate located below the floor of the microwave cavity. the crude product was purified by flash chromatography using PE/EtOAc = 4:1 as eluent to yield the wished product 5 as a light orange solid (yield: 96%); mp = 150\u00b0C (decomposition); 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) the reaction mixture was heated at 90\u00b0C for 10 min under microwave irradiation. the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness, then MeOH and a drop of HCl 2N were added. the final rhodanine derivatives were obtained as a pure precipitate. xo-2-thioxothiazolidin-5-ylidene)methyl)furan-2-yl)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (9a) (Yield: 55%); brown solid; mp = 254\u00b0C (decomposition); 1H NMR: (DMSO, 400 MHz) = 8.93\u20137.91 (d, 1H, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.76\u20137.74 (d, 1H, J = 8 Hz), 13C NMR (DMSO, 100 MHz): 194.07, 171.54, 166.68, 161.86, 156.87, 150.49, 137.55, 134.85, 131.72, 131.50, 131.34, 123.05, 120.02, 119.43, 118.48, 115.51, 114.05, 112.90, 112.53, 45.32, 31.96 ppm. 13C NMR (DMSO, 100 MHz): = 193.97, 171.77, 166.62, 161.83, 156.68, 150.46, 134.89, 131.76, 130.05, 129.82, 123.13, 120.00, 118.39, 115.53, 114.33, 113.60, 113.06, 112.42, 55.37, 45.85, 31.67 ppm. m/z 496.0 [M-H]- was dissolved in 3 mL of acetone.
