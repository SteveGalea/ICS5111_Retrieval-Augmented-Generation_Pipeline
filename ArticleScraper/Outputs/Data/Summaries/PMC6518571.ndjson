{"summary": "the article by Kraemer et al. provides a nice review of several tools used in the analysis of viral disease epidemics. it calls for increased, and timelier integration of these tools. only five published their findings as preprints in advance of final publication in a peer-reviewed journal. a digital object identifier (doi) is provided for each preprint identified. three types of findings (geographic origin, geographic spread, number of cases) were reported relatively close to one another during fairly early stages of three of the epidemics (zika, Ebola, MERS) similar value applies to the use of preprints to disseminate time-sensitive findings during disease epidemics. similar value applies to preprints to disseminate time-sensitive findings during disease epidemics."}
