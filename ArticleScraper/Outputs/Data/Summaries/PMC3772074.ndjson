{"summary": "CHIKV disease is characterized by acute and chronic polyarthritis/polyarthralgia, which is usually symmetric and often incapacitating and occasionally protracted. atypical and severe clinical forms of CHIKV disease and some fatalities appear to be restricted to the very young and elderly patients with comorbidities. a peptide created by cleavage of the polyprotein to release E2 and E1 is incorporated into particles at a low level [12], [13]. the atomic structure of CHIKV glycoproteins in virions was solved by x-ray crystallography [15], both for mature particles and for immature p62 Env precursor polyprotein. polyclonal immunoglobulins derived from humans recovered from CHIKV infection can mediate protection prophylactically, or soon after exposure. a recent study described two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 5F10 and 8B10, which were isolated from CHIKV infected individuals. these mAbs specifically neutralized CHIKV and o'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV), but none of the other alphaviruses tested two human mAbs, C9 and E8, were found from patients infected with CHIKV. the binding epitopes for C9 and E8 both mapped to CHIKV E1 and E2 glycoproteins. the characterization of binding epitopes using a library of alanine scanning mutants. SS-VH cassettes were cloned into a pCAGGS mammalian expression vector. cDNAs bearing human IL-2 signal sequences were synthesized by Genscript. CHIKV envelope (E3/E2/E1) in a pCAGGS vector was used for pseudoparticle preparation. -type pseudovirus neutralization assay HEK 293T cells were plated at 2104 cells/well in DMEM (HyClone) containing additives and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 overnight. the following day, serial dilutions of antibody and virus pre-incubated for 45 min were added to the HEK 293T cells. 250 l of the antibody-virus mixture was added to the confluent Vero cell monolayer for an additional hour. the virus was removed and an overlay of 4% agarose in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS was added. the plaques were stained and counted as described above. the immune FAb phage display library was constructed from peripheral blood donated by three CHIKV-infected individuals during the 2006 outbreak. RNA was converted to cDNA using Super Script First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR. the final library was transformed into E.coli TG1 cells (Invitrogen) using electroporation. CHIKV VLPs diluted to 20 g/ml were loaded for 45 minutes. tips were then transferred to PBS buffer supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA. antibody association was measured for 5 minutes followed by 50 minute dissociation. mAbs were detected using 3.75 g/ml AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody in 10% NGS for 1 h. mAbs were detected using the Intellicyt high throughput flow cytometer (HTFC, Intellicyt) Mutations were identified as critical to the epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test human mAb, but did support reactivity of other CHIKV antibodies. mice were injected with (i) PBS; (ii) purified C9 mAb or (iii) purified control human mAb at 0.5 mg/mouse by intraperitoneal route. arthritis was monitored by measuring the height and width of the metatarsal area of the hind feet using digital calipers. mice were infected with 5105 PFU of CHIKV (S27 strain) intradermally in the ventral thorax. some mice were also intraperitoneally injected with C9 or control human IgG/mouse in 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline. SS-VH cassettes were cloned into a pCAGGS mammalian expression vector. cDNAs bearing human IL-2 signal sequences were synthesized by Genscript. CHIKV wild-type envelope pseudovirion production CHIKV envelope (E3/E2/E1) was used for pseudoparticle preparation. HEK 293T cells were plated at 2104 cells/well in DMEM (HyClone) containing additives and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 overnight. the following day, serial dilutions of antibody and virus pre-incubated for 45 min were added to the HEK 293T cells. 250 l of the antibody-virus mixture was added to the confluent Vero cell monolayer for an additional hour. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 hrs. PBMCs for EBV transformed B cell isolation were obtained from two CHIKV infected individuals. b phage display library constructed from peripheral blood donated by three CHIKV-infected individuals during the 2006 outbreak. total RNA was prepared using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) with standard protocols. RNA was converted to cDNA using Super Script First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) CHIKV VLPs diluted to 20 g/ml were loaded for 45 minutes. tips were then transferred to PBS buffer supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA (PBS-B) for subsequent antibody binding studies. mAbs were detected using 3.75 g/ml AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody in 10% NGS (Sigma) mAbs were detected using 3.75 g/ml AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody in 10% NGS for 1 h. Mutations were identified as critical to the epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test human mAb. arthritis was monitored by measuring the height and width of the metatarsal area of the hind feet using digital calipers. viremias were measured by collecting 40 l of blood from a tail vein into 0.8-ml miniCollect serum separation tubes (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Kremsmunster, Austria) mice were infected with 5105 PFU of CHIKV intradermally in the ventral thorax. some mice were also intraperitoneally injected with C9 or control human IgG/mouse in 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the antibody heavy and light chains for C9 and E8 were cloned into human full length IgG vectors for protein production and evaluation. mAbs C9 and E8 neutralized CHIKV pseudoviruses at approximately 0.1 g/ml and 1.0 g/ml (IC50) respectively. antibody concentration is shown in the x-axis. the results are expressed as the percentage of no antibody control. a comparable level of neutralization was also observed with the LR2006 OPY-1 strain. E8 failed to recognize CHIKV envelope protein on intact CHIKV VLPs. this finding is consistent with the inability of E8 to neutralize live CHIKV. both C9 and E8 recognize conformation specific epitopes. mAbs were screened against a comprehensive CHIKV mutation library. nearly every residue within the E2, 6K, and E1 envelope subunits were individually mutated to an alanine. each clone was expressed in HEK-293T cells and assessed for C9 and E8 antibody binding using immunofluorescence staining. HEK-293 cells expressing mutant CHIKV envelope proteins were immunostained with E8 antibody. mutation of six individual E2 residues to alanine significantly reduced E8 binding (red bars) but did not affect binding of C9 (green bar) or other control antibodies (gray bars) the acid-sensitive region (ASR) was sandwiched in a critical pocket between CHIKV E1, E2 and E3, as determined by the CHIKV envelope crystal structure [15], [40]. residue E2-A162 when mutated to serine, reacted at 12% of WT reactivity against C9 but reacted at greater than 70% of WT reactivity against other anti-CHIKV antibodies. the critical residue A162 was visualized on the CHIKV env crystal structure. the monomer (PDB Entry #3N41) is depicted in yellow, red, and blue. in the side-view and top-down trimeric representations, the viral membrane is positioned at the bottom of the figure. infection experiments were conducted with wild type and mutant pseudovirions. in both control groups, CHIKV infection of 6-week old mice resulted in a 5\u20136 day viremia and increased foot swelling similar to that described previously in control animals. in contrast, 6 week old mice injected with C9 IgG 24 hours prior to exposure to virus showed no detectable viremia or foot swelling. this results demonstrate that the C9 antibody completely protected adult animals prophylactically against viremia and arthritic disease. C9 (100 g/mouse or 25 mg/kg), when administered therapeutically at 8 hours and 18 hours after CHIKV challenge, completely protected 100% of mice. the protective nature of C9 mAb at different concentrations is represented as Kaplan-Meier survival curves. chikungunya protection in mice with human anti-CHIKV mAbs is thought to require close to the IC90 levels of antibodies in the serum. we performed in vivo antibody titration experiments and dosed neonates immediately before CHIKV challenge. over 50% of mice survived after receiving 0.25 mg/kg of C9 mAb concurrent with viral challenge. Fab fragment (E8) was isolated from a phage display library constructed from multiple CHIKV infected and recovered individuals from the 2005\u20136 epidemic on la R\u00e9union. a virus-like particle (VLP) binding assay was used as the primary screen for panning phage, followed by use of the CHIKV pseudovirus (HIV- backbone based, without CHIKV capsid) neutralization assay. CHIKV envelopes with a naturally occurring mutation at a critical site near the fusion loop in E1 (A226V) are associated with increased CHIKV infectivity for and transmission by the mosquito vector, Aedes albopictus. mAbs C9 and E8 neutralize CHIKV pseudovirions. antibody binding to intact CHIKV VLPs was detected using the FoteBio OctetRed biosensor tips. antibody binding to the immobilized particles was measured using bioLayer Interferometry (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA) the antibody failed to recognize CHIKV envelope protein on intact CHIKV VLPs. raw data curves for antibody associating and dissociating from captured CHIKV VLPs are shown in black and fitted curves are shown in red. data were fitted to a 11 binding model to determine association rate (kon) and dissociation rate (koff), and equilibrium binding affinity (KD) was calculated. es E2-Y69, E2-F84, E2-V113, E2-G114, E2-T116, and E2-D117, when mutated to alanine, all reacted at less than 20% of WT reactivity when screened with E8, but had high reactivity compared to three other antibodies. HEK-293 cells expressing mutant CHIKV envelope proteins were immunostained with E8 antibody. similar epitope mapping studies using Shotgun Mutagenesis alanine scanning identified residue E2-A162 as a critical residue required for C9 recognition. the residue is solvent exposed and predicted to be easily accessible when CHIKV Env is in the native trimer conformation. the infectivity of the mutants compared to WT was tested. the mutants did not hinder CHIKV env folding or function. the critical residue A162 was visualized on the CHIKV env crystal structure. mice received an intra-peritoneal injection of purified C9 IgG (0.5 mg/mouse or approximately 20\u201325 mg/kg) the day before being infected with the Reunion Island isolate of CHIKV. in both control groups, CHIKV infection of 6-week old mice resulted in a 5\u20136 day viremia and foot swelling. mice infected with CHIKV survived for 5 days, while mice given control human IgG survived for 4 days. 100% of neonate mice injected with C9 at 100 g (25 mg/kg) co-incident with infection survived (P0.001 compared to virus alone or human IgG) IgG control 100 +18 5 20 4.25 Human C9 mAb 100 +8 8 100 - 0.01 Human C9 mAb 100 +18 7 100 - 0.01 1 All mice were infected with CHIKV at hour 0. data on CHIKV infected mice without antibody treatment and mice treated with control or C9 antibody at hour 0 are also shown. study describes isolation and characterization of two human monoclonal antibodies, C9 and E8, from CHIKV infected and recovered individuals. we previously developed a CHIKV pseudovirus assay [28] that we found amenable in our current study for high-throughput screening and selection of clones expressing CHIKV neutralizing antibodies. the critical E2-A162 residue is located in the ASR of E2 that encompasses amino acids 159\u2013171 and 231\u2013258 [15] it is possible that neutralizing antibodies such as C9 that bind to the ASR region could fully or partially prevent the disordering and dissociation of E2 from E1 following pH triggering. antibody R6/R13 is specific to SINV and has been previously documented to have an escape mutant at position K159N (equivalent to CHIKV residue E2-T160) in the ASR of SINV E2 glycoprotein. the isolation and characterization of additional CHIKV mAbs should offer insight into the proportion of antibodies elicited against this particular epitope. 100% of mice were protected with 1 mg/kg of C9 mAb. over 50% of mice were protected with only 0.25 mg/kg of C9. the data is consistent with what has been determined for in vivo protection from viral infection by neutralizing antibodies. studies have demonstrated that the use of combinations of mAbs is advantageous for in vivo protection by limiting development of resistance [26] and different mechanisms of viral spread [24]."}
