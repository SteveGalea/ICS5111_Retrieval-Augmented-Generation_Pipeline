{"summary": "two research teams led by Dr Yoshihiro Kawaoka (University of Wisconsin at Madison) and Dr Ron Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) generated avian influenza virus H5N1 variants that acquired the ability to transmit via aerosols between ferrets. their papers were submitted to Nature and Science for publication. however, such studies are considered by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) as \u2018dual use research' we have recently analyzed the conservation rate of the four key residues in H5 HA reported in Imai's Nature paper. we found that three of the four residues are highly conservative. but some of the man-made mutations, such as N158D, N224K and T318I, are indeed present in the viruses in their nature hosts. the objective of biosecurity is to prevent loss, theft or misuse of microorganisms, biological materials and research-related information. investigators should also use appropriate analytical tools to determine the risks and benefits associated with contemplated dual use research on emerging infectious diseases. containment principles, facility design, practices and procedures are designed to reduce laboratory-acquired infections to researchers handling infectious materials and other biologically hazardous materials. adherence to biosafety procedures is absolutely essential for researchers working with emerging pathogens because the exact transmission pathways of these pathogens are unclear. gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5): it is not necessary to be overcautious in handling some non-airborne microbes. experiments using research-laboratory-scale quantities of human immunodeficiency Virus can be performed in a biosafety level-2, rather than biosafety level-3 facility."}
