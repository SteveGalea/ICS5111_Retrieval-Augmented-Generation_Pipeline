{"summary": "pathogens from a nasopharyngeal swab were measured by multiplex PCR analysis. asthma exacerbations occurred after a common cold in 48 inpatients. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) are known to be major causes of asthma exacerbation in children. prevalence of virus detection in adult asthmatic exacerbation was reported to the range of 41\u201378%. mast cells induce a subset of genes that include a Th2 cytokine and chemokines that recruit Th2 cells and eosinophils. TLR7 activation inhibits viral replication in the lung and prevents virus-induced airway hyperreactivity. fifty-five adult asthmatic patients were admitted to our hospital due to asthma exacerbations from may 2011 to December 2012. asthmatic inpatients who were admitted to our hospital for other disease or who did not require systemic steroid treatment were excluded. 20 stable asthmatic patients without any asthmatic attack in previous year were recruited from the outpatient clinic in our hospital. nasopharyngeal swab was taken from each patient as soon as possible after hospital admission. the nasopharyngeal swab was dipped in PBS buffer, and the appropriate volume of RNAlater was added. PCR products were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. the sputum culture from patients was performed for detection of bacterial infection. data analyses were performed with SPSS statistics version 17.0.0. asthma exacerbation inpatients n 48 20 Male (%) 39.6 45.0 Age (y) 57.6 60.2 Asthma onset age (y) 38.4 39.9 Duration of disease (y) 20.2 21.3 Current smoker(%) 37.5* 5.0 Sinusitis (%) 29.2 15.0 COPD (%) 16.7 5.0 Atopic type (%) 81.9 84.2 IgE(IU/mL) 617.2 574.9 AC the dominant viruses were HRV A/B/C, RSV A, influenza A virus, and metapneumovirus. the method of bacterial detection was sputum culture (20.8%), multiplex PCR (41.7%) and both (37.5%). the infected patients were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, higher IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, and pneumonia. there were no differences between the two groups in lymphocyte counts, CD4 absolute counts, and immunoglobulin levels. after intensive treatment of the asthma exacerbation for one month, ACQ and FeNO levels decreased without any difference between the two groups. 32.3 21.4 32.0 13.0 44.4* 10.0 Pneumonia (%) 20.6 7.1 12.0 0.0 16.7* 0.0 COPD (%) 21.0 7.1 20.0 13.0 22.2 13.3 IgE(IU/mL) 649.8 340.5 722.9* 507.0 373.3 768.6 ACQ 3.6 3.6 3.7 3.6 3.7 FeNO (ppb) 42.6 69.4 34.2 68.1 52.2 50.5 Post ACQ 0.6 0.4 za 1 6.3 5.0 Respiratory syncytial virus B 4.2 5.0 Coronavirus 22 2.1 5.0 Bacteria S. pneumoniae 18.8* 0.0 H. influenzae 12.5 30.0 CNS 4.2 0.0 M. catarrhalis 2.1 0.0 K. pneumoniae 2.1 0.0 H. pneumoniae 2.1 0.0 H. parainfluenzae 2.1 0.0 C. pneumoniae 2.1 0.0 *p 0.05 by Pearson\u2019s 2 test p compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had higher incidences of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, and pneumonia. there was no difference in the pathogen detection rate between inpatients and outpatients. the dominant viruses were HRV A/B/C, RSV A, influenza A virus, and metapneumovirus. the dominant viruses were 9 (18.8%), 9 (18.8%), and 14 (29.2%), respectively. the infected patients were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, higher IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, and pneumonia. there were no differences between the two groups in lymphocyte counts, CD4 absolute counts, and immunoglobulin levels. 6 164.7 174.3 160.6 153.8 175.9 Sinusitis (%) 32.3 21.4 32.0 13.0 44.4* 10.0 Pneumonia (%) 20.6 7.1 12.0 0.0 16.7* 0.0 COPD (%) 21.0 7.1 20.0 13.0 22.2 13.3 IgE(IU/mL) 649.8 340.5 722.9* 507.0 373.3 768.6 ACQ 3.6 3.8 3.6 3.7 3.7 FeNO (ppb) 42.6 69 6.3 20.0 Parainfluenza 2 6.3 10.0 Parainfluenza 1 6.3 5.0 Respiratory syncytial virus B 4.2 5.0 Coronavirus 22 2.1 5.0 Bacteria S. pneumoniae 18.8* 0.0 H. influenzae 12.5 30.0 CNS 4.2 0.0 M. catarrhalis 2.1 0.0 K. pneumoniae 2.1 0.0 H. parainfluenzae 2.1 0.0 B. pertussis 2.1 0.0 C bacterial infection has not been the focus of previous studies of asthma exacerbation. comorbid sinusitis may be the most important factor related to susceptibility to bacterial infection in asthmatic patients. the exacerbation group had a higher number of smokers versus the stable asthmatics in our study. a pathogen was detected from nasopharyngeal swabs in only 70% of patients. infection with S. pneumoniae was related to adult asthma exacerbation. a fast and easy method for the detection of pathogens is required."}
