{"summary": "in recent years, viral zoonotic diseases have caused outbreaks marked by rapid spread and high mortality. the 2002 emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1], the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic [2], and the 2013 Ebola outbreak in west africa [3]. such outbreaks are difficult to predict as new strains emerge or reemerge from zoonotic reservoirs. preclinical vaccine development for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has largely aimed to stimulate a robust immune response against the viral envelope-protruding spike (S) glycoprotein [28,29], a class I fusion protein, and/or the nucleocapsid (N) protein [30,31] the centrality of S to viral entry helps explain why antibodies that target it are potently neutralizing [35], likely because N is not displayed on the viral surface. however, vaccination with SARS-CoV N may help induce cell-mediated immunity to CoV infection [40], as may S. immunogenic components derived from a pathogen have gained popularity in recent decades due to ease of production and reduced risks in vivo compared to vaccine types that involve live virus. antibodies generated against the receptor binding domain (RBD) are both long-lasting (>3 years) and neutralizing [48]. uvanted with AddaVaxTM (MF59-like), the RBD protein vaccine was protective when administered intramuscularly to transgenic mice expressing human DPP4. no evidence of immunological toxicity or eosinophilic immune enhancement. a monomeric RBD protein vaccine has been developed and tested in rhesus macaques. a variation of the full-length S glycoprotein vaccine is a trimer of S ectodomain (all but the transmembrane domain) conformationally locked in the prefusion state by the substitution of two proline residues in the S2 domain. targeting epitopes in S2 may provide broader protection against different MERS-CoV strains. a range-refined RBD protein vaccine has been stably expressed in a modified high-yield CHO vaccine. this range-refined RBD protein vaccine has been stably expressed in a modified high-yield CHO vaccine. a monomeric RBD protein vaccine has been developed and tested in rhesus macaques. it reduced MERS-associated lung pathology and reduced viral loads when adjuvanted with alum and administered intramuscularly to transgenic mice expressing human DPP4. a trimer of this RBD protein vaccine has been generated containing a foldon trimerization motif. a variation of the full-length S glycoprotein vaccine is a trimer of S ectodomain (all but the transmembrane domain) conformationally locked in the prefusion state by the substitution of two proline residues in the S2 domain. targeting epitopes in S2 may provide broader protection against different lineage C CoVs. DNA Vaccines: Efficient Protection DNA vaccines offer a rapid platform to design and deliver immunogenic proteins. the in vivo expression of plasmid-encoded proteins recapitulates native post-translational modifications. integration using various plasmids and inserts appears to be extremely rare. the pVax1TM vaccine (GLS-5300) has completed a Phase I clinical trial. a second vaccine platform utilizes pVRC8400 [72,73], a plasmid vector engineered for high transgene expression and enhanced cell-mediated responses. a vaccine regimen consisting of intramuscular administration of MERS-CoV strain England1 full-length S encoded on pVRC8400, with electroporation, and an AlPO4-a this vaccine induced NAb in mice when given intramuscularly and antigen-specific cytokine production. the vaccine protected adenovirally hDPP4-transduced mice against challenge with MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012. this result was attributed to increased secretion of the S1 protein. the pVax1TM vaccine (GLS-5300) has completed a Phase I clinical trial. a second vaccine platform utilizes pVRC8400 [72,73], a plasmid vector engineered for high transgene expression and enhanced cell-mediated responses. a vaccine regimen consisting of intramuscular administration of MERS-CoV strain England1 full-length S encoded on pVRC8400, with electroporation, and an AlPO4-a pVax1TM induced NAb in mice when given intramuscularly and antigen-specific cytokine production. the vaccine protected adenovirally hDPP4-transduced mice against challenge with MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012. this result was attributed to increased secretion of the S1 protein. a VRP encoding MERS-CoV S elicited NAb in both young and aged mice [38]. immunization with an N protein-expressing VRP protected adenovirally hDPP4-transduced mice from MERS-CoV challenge in a CD4+ T cell- and IFN-dependent manner. a specific N protein epitope was stimulatory in mice transgenic for human leukocyte antigen DR2 and DR3 pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) was shown to result in reduced CD8+ T cell responses against an Ad5-vectored transgene. this study did not detect immunity against the Ad5 vector in dromedary camels, the intended vaccination population. chimpanzee adenoviruses have been developed as viral vaccine vectors. a chimpanzee adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1) was shown to induce high levels of NAb and cell-mediated responses in mice 4 weeks post-immunization. this vaccine was constructed with a codon-optimized S glycoprotein sequence and the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) gene leader sequence. NVD vector expressing MERS-CoV S was shown to induce long-lasting (up 14 weeks post-immunization) NAb titers in camels. a rabies virus vector has been explored. virus-like particles (VLPs) comprise self-assembling immunogenic proteins, but no genome. baculovirus VLP elicited RBD-specific IgG and IFN- responses in rhesus macaques. a subsequent baculovirus VLP vaccine was developed. immunization with a gamma-irradiated MERS-CoV vaccine adjuvanted with either alum or MF59 elicited NAb and reduced viral titer upon challenge in hDPP4-transgenic mice. eosinophil-mediated vaccine-related pathology was not observed in this animal model. nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) contains an exoribonuclease (ExoN) essential to replication fidelity that is found in all known nidoviruses with genome sizes greater than 20 kb. a stable deficiency in nsp14 attenuated SARS-CoV in young, aged, and immunocompromised mice. inactivated vaccines for MERS-CoV have been stymied by prior concerns with inactivated vaccines. a gamma-irradiated MERS-CoV vaccine adjuvanted with either alum or MF59 elicited NAb and reduced viral titer upon challenge in hDPP4-transgenic mice. methylated CpG motifs were shown to elicit levels of NAb on par with those elicited by an S glycoprotein-only vaccine. the vaccine offered better protection than S alone based on reduction of lung viral titer in adenovirally hDPP4-transduced mice after MERS-CoV challenge. eosinophil-mediated vaccine-related pathology was not observed in this animal model. nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) contains an exoribonuclease (ExoN) essential to replication fidelity. a stable deficiency in nsp14 attenuated SARS-CoV in young, aged, and immunocompromised mice. exoN mutants for MERS-CoV have not been reported. MERS-CoV vaccine development efforts have multiplied since its emergence. key barriers to vaccine efficacy first noted for SARS-CoV may hold true. mortality from MERS-CoV has disproportionately affected the aged. vaccines with SARS-CoV may be capable of inducing protection in young animals while failing to protect aged animals. vaccines may be capable of inducing protection in young animals while failing to protect aged animals. mmunosuppressed macaques underscoring the immunopathogenic component of respiratory disease caused by CoVs [132] a successful vaccine must strike a balance between protection and excessive immune activation. as seen with full-length S [44] as well as inactivated virus [116], vaccination may produce immunopathology under certain conditions."}
