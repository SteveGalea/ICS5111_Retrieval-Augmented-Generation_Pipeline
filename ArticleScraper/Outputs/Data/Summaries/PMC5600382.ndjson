{"summary": "proteins in ingested food are hydrolyzed to small oligopeptides and amino acids on their way from the oral cavity to the small intestine where they are absorbed across the mucosa. they are transported mostly across epithelial cells by being imported through their luminal membrane and sequentially exported across their basolateral membrane. prevention of loss of amino acids via urine is necessarily important. expression and function of B0AT1 have also been shown to depend on co-expression of members of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) in ACE2 nullizygous mice, B0AT1 was absent in the intestinal but present in the renal but present in the intestinal brush-border membrane. ACE2 is an abundant carboxypeptidase of the small intestine and has been identified as the severe acute respiratory syndrome receptor. nutrient transporters should be repressed if costs exceed their benefits. there is yet not much known about the dietary regulation of amino acid transporters. a high protein diet leads to an increased uptake of some amino acids. a glutamine-enriched diet was shown to increase glutamine uptake in jejunal bbmv from rats compared to a control diet. some experiments in which high concentrations of amino acids were administered in small intestinal loops of rats also suggested a short-term (20 min) amino acid-induced regulation of amino acid absorption [31]. acute regulation of B0AT1 Rats were fed ad libitum a standard diet. rats were either starved for 4 h, 16 h or fed ad libitum followed by an intragastric application of the amino acid cocktail. after 1 h, rats were anesthetized with AttaneTM Isoflurane ad us. vet. diets Rats were fed ad libitum a standard protein diet (NP), a high protein diet or a standard diet with supplemented single amino acids (AA) in the same ratio as in the HP diet. the pellet was suspended in 200 l buffer 2 containing 300 mM mannitol, 20 mM Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4 supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) the final pellet was resuspended in 100 l buffer 2 and homogenized by passing at least 10 times through a 25-gauge needle.

C: Protein expression of B0AT1, ACE2 and CD13 along the small intestine. Western blotting experiments of bbmv with antibodies directed against B0AT1, ACE2, CD13 and -actin were performed. no dietary effect on the expression of B0AT1 and/or ACE2 mRNA was observed. both transcripts showed at both times of the day a higher level in duodenum compared to ileum. abundance of these proteins displayed an axial gradient opposite to the one of the corresponding mRNAs. nocturnal rats fed different diets (NP, HP or AA diet) were euthanized 3 h after light-onset (ZT3) or 3 h after light-offset (ZT15) the distal B0AT1 protein expression was higher than the proximal one, independent of the diet or time point. this effect is not visible in Fig 2 due to the normalization to ZT3. the transport function of B0AT1 was tested by measuring the uptake rate of L-isoleucine in intestinal rings. the results of these experiments performed with rings of proximal and distal jejunum and in the presence and absence of sodium are shown in Fig 2. proximal and distal jejunum at ZT3 and ZT15 was measured in the presence and absence of sodium and sodium-dependent uptake was calculated. data represent mean values of 9 different animals from 3 independent experiments. rats food-deprived for 16 h were gavaged with water or an isomolar amino acid cocktail containing 0.34 mmol of each of the proteinogenic amino acids. analysis of protein expression in bbmv of proximal and distal jejunum from the same rats showed no obvious differences between the two groups. data represent mean values of 5 rats SEM, each uptake condition was measured in triplicates. no significant difference of sodium-dependent uptake by paired two-tailed Students t-test. animals fed NP, HP or AA diet for 7 days were euthanized 3 h after light-onset (ZT3) or offset (ZT15) data represent mean values of 3 intestinal ring uptakes of 9 different animals. jejunum was significantly increased under HP and AA diet in the active (ZT15) as well as in the inactive phase (ZT3). however, in the distal jejunum there was no significant change in B0AT1 protein expression under HP or AA diet compared to NP diet, neither at ZT3 nor at ZT15. a diet with elevated free amino acid levels increases B0AT1 protein expression in the proximal jejunum and ACE2 protein expression as well as the transport by B0AT1 in the distal jejunum. results suggest that a diet with elevated free amino acid levels increases B0AT1 protein expression in the proximal jejunum. -isoleucine that accumulated in mucosal cells was substantially higher in the proximal part of the small intestine compared to the middle or distal part. this latter observation supports the idea that free amino acids were to a large extent absorbed within the first section of the small intestine. animals were fed NP, HP or AA diet for 7 days. a diet with either elevated free amino acids or elevated protein increases the expression of functional B0AT1 and its auxiliary peptidases in small intestine. this study shows that the luminal membrane expression of B0AT1 and its associated peptidases ACE2 and CD13 on villi of the small intestine of rats displays an axial gradient toward the villi tips. -actin is a highly abundant cytoskeletal protein with a structural function in brush-border microvilli. the proportion of single amino acids relative to peptides is higher in the distal section of the small intestine compared to the proximal one. mRNA level of pepT1 peaks three hours before onset of the dark cycle. mRNA expression peaks 6\u201312 h earlier than protein expression. mRNA expression was upregulated in the evening only under normal protein diet. the amino acid L-alanine was shown to exert an inhibitory effect on its jejunal absorption. it was also shown to exert an inhibitory effect on its absorption from the ileum. we tested whether B0AT1 was also acutely regulated in vivo by its own substrates. in rats, mice and sheep intestinal glucose transport had been shown to be increased in response to a high carbohydrate diet. the peptide transporter PepT1 had been shown to be upregulated by dietary proteins at the transcriptional level. ring uptake experiments in vivo were consistent with a more efficient absorption of this B0AT1 substrate L-isoleucine. in the present study, we observed an increased expression of CD13 protein under HP diet at ZT15 only in the proximal section of the jejunum. the sensing and regulatory mechanisms underlying the observed dietary adaptation of small-intestinal neutral amino acid transport are not yet understood."}
