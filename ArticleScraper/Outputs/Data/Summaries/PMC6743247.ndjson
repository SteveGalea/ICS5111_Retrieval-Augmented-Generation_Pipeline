{"summary": "entry into a host cell is a critical stage in the life of a virus 1, 2. blocking viral entry stops infection early on, preventing viral replication. blocking viral entry stops infection early on, preventing viral replication. viruses, flaviviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and rhabdoviruses 1, 2, while macropinocytosis is linked to the uptake of larger viruses that do not fit into clathrin-coated vesicles 4\u20136. this tactic is indicative of a change of focus for viral therapeutics. high-molecular-weight molecules with a high degree of sulfation have the highest antiviral activity in vitro. these compounds tend to bind to plasma proteins and have poor bioavailability 11, 12. virucidal activity may also be required to increase in vivo efficacy. virus- and cell-targeted approaches have been studied to prevent the interaction between influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and sialic acids (SA) on glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors. the most promising cell-targeted strategy is the attachment inhibitor DAS181, a recombinant protein made of a sialidase catalytic domain (which removes SA from influenza receptors) maraviroc is currently used in HIV-infected patients showing resistance to other compounds 23. this is usually associated with multiple mutations in the HIV envelope protein that generally cause a significant decrease in viral fitness 24. an alternative tactic is to inhibit synthesis of cellular membrane glycoproteins that function as receptors for specific viruses. a bispecific antibody bound to EBOV is internalized into endo-lysosomal compartments where it potently blocks Ebola interaction with its intracellular receptor 28. this strategy, already tested for HIV 29, has been shown to protect mice, even when administered 2 days after challenge with EBOV 28. a conserved VP1\u2013VP3 interprotomer interface in the viral capsid has been proposed as an alternative druggable target. a conserved VP1\u2013VP3 interprotomer interface in the viral capsid has been proposed as an alternative druggable target. d viruses selectively bind to non-enveloped virus capsid proteins to prevent interaction with cellular receptors. the most promising cell-targeted strategy is the attachment inhibitor DAS181, a recombinant protein made of a sialidase catalytic domain (which removes SA from influenza receptors) this compound, highly potent in vitro (IC 50 between 0.04 and 0.9 nM), has been shown to be non-toxic to cells and effective in vivo when administered pre- and post-exposure 19. maraviroc is currently the only drug that inhibits viral entry. fonamide (CADA), a small-molecule inhibitor of HIV replication, has been found to specifically inhibit the synthesis of the HIV receptor CD4 by binding to the protein signal sequence in the Sec61 translocon. decreased levels of CD4 render potential host cells refractory to HIV-1 infection and presumably HIV-2, HHV6. a bispecific antibody bound to EBOV is internalized into endo-lysosomal compartments where it potently blocks Ebola interaction with its intracellular receptor 28. this strategy, already tested for HIV 29, has been shown to protect mice, even when administered 2 days after challenge with EBOV 28. tryptophan dendrimers that target the 5-fold-axis of the enterovirus-A71 capsid have also been shown to have antiviral potential in vitro. endocytosis can be blocked by compounds that interfere with signaling cascades necessary to activate endocytosis or inhibit the endocytosis machinery directly. a study by Harper et al. showed that Dyngo-4a can inhibit botulinum neurotoxin type A endocytosis in neurons in vitro. however, in vivo administration only delayed the onset of symptoms by 3 hours in 60% of infected mice. fusion is the next necessary step that allows a virus to release its genome into the cytoplasm. fusion is mediated by virally encoded envelope glycoproteins displayed on the virion surface. a common cue is the acidic pH of endosomal environments 1, 3, 51. ine analogues have been used against influenza virus infection 54. but their activity is directed through inhibition of the viral M2 protein, rather than inhibition of endosomal acidification. an alternative cue to low pH is proteolytic cleavage of envelope proteins by endosomal proteases. compounds that inhibit endosomal potassium channels 62 may offer an effective approach to inhibiting a range of different viruses. fusion inhibitors that block the fusion of other paramyxoviruses, including measles, Nipah, and dengue viruses have also been developed. a number of compounds are likely to intercalate into the endosomal membranes and prevent fusion 45, 75. this is possibly the mode of action of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and similar amphipathic compounds, including amiodarone 76, 77 and amodiaquine 78. the concentrations required to achieve similar antiviral effects in vivo are likely to be high, and the risk of side effects significant. a new antiviral strategy is being developed to prevent virus infection. many approaches target host rather than viral components. this is in line with a recent trend in the development of antiviral strategies 51, 81. potential toxicity of targeting host cell pathways is a viable option for controlling infection. most of the virus infections that might benefit from this approach establish acute infections for which drug administration could be as short as a few days. this concern is counterbalanced by the potential for broad-spectrum effectiveness of many cell-targeted approaches. limited in vivo efficacy of many treatments to date may be due to the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the compounds. limited availability of adequate small models that recapitulate disease also contributes to the problem."}
