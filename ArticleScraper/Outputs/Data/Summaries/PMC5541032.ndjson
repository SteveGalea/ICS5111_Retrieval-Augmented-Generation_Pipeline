{"summary": "ZIKV is a single-stranded RNA virus that encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved to form mature proteins. other flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and west Nile virus (WNV) are closely related to ZIKV. in males, ZIKV can infect testes (Govero et al., 2016), prostate and seminal vesicles. virus can be maintained in the vagina, uterus (Hirsch et al., 2017), vaginal epithelium (mice), and in uterine fibroblasts. persistence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid and lymph nodes appears to enhance activity of rapamycin (mTOR), pro mosquitoes play a primary role in ZIKV transmission. male-to-female, female-to-male, and male-to-male transmissions have been reported. infected human patients serve as a source of ZIKV. advances in the design and development of anti-viral drugs are not yet available to combat ZIKV. acetaminophen is used to control fever and pain. anti-histamines are used for pruritic rashes. conditioned medium obtained from PHT cells has been found to inhibit ZIKV growth in trophoblastic and non-trophoblastic cells by stimulating the secretion of IFN-1. TIM receptors mediate viral entry after binding with viral phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Peptide (GQASNGVFVIHWGKFDSFGIAV) derived from the japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) E protein stem is able to prevent ZIKV infection with IC50 even at the nanomolar scale (3.93 nM) it also decreases the viral load and prevents histopathological damages in brain and testes in AG6 mouse. nanchangmycin, a polyether obtained from Streptomyces nanchangensis, has been shown to block ZIKV replication in U2OS cells in in vitro. nanchangmycin, a polyether obtained from Streptomyces nanchangensis, has been shown to block ZIKV replication in in vitro. Obatoclax is a potential anti-neoplastic and pro-apoptotic synthetic small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor. it is reported to reduce the acidity of endolysosomal vesicles in in vitro model. despite this limitation, it works as a broad-spectrum anti-viral agent. activity against HIV (Alexandre et al., 2011), HPV (Levendosky et al., 2015), HCV (Takebe et al., 2013), and SARS (O\u2019Keefe et al., 2010). potent drugs can be used as an anti-viral agent against ZIKV too. alaninal-containing lipopeptide of fungal origin has recently been found to inhibit ZIKV polyprotein processing and cleavage of host protein signal peptides. synthetic 25-hydroxycholesterol has been shown to inhibit ZIKV entry into the host in an in vivo assay using mouse and rhesus macaque models. methyltransferase domain is responsible for transferring mRNA cap. Sinefungin inhibits S-adenosyl-1-methionine (SAM), the natural substrate for methyltransferases and inhibit the methyltransferase activity. NS5 is also involved in IFN antagonism. mutant ZIKV is unable to prevent IFN-stimulated signaling. sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) is a nucleotide analog inhibitor commercially available for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. its active metabolite is 2\u2032-fluoro-2-C-methyl-UTP, which binds to the active site of NS5. it is a class B drug and can be used in men and non-pregnant women to prevent tissue damage. an NS5 methyltransferase null mutant was found to be lethal for the virus. adenosine derivative originally isolated from Streptomyces griseoleus is a potential anti-fungal and anti-parasitic compound that competitively inhibits S-adenosyl-1-methionine (SAM) sinefungin is a potential anti-fungal and anti-parasitic compound that competitively inhibits S-adeno the ZIKV helicase crystal structure has revealed a conserved triphosphate pocket and a positively charged tunnel. this critical substrate-binding pocket may be a good target for anti-virals. drugs that target the helicase of these viruses could also be explored for the control of ZIKV. inhibition of protease activity was evaluated by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay. myricetin showed the strongest inhibition of the NS2B-NS3 protease. CN-716, a capped peptidomimetic boronic-acid compound, has been found to form ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitor complex. e is a host enzyme responsible for pyrimidine biosynthesis. the host enzyme exhibited anti-ZIKV activity with an EC50. a low therapeutic index for Brequinar has restricted its clinical use. the NS5 polymerase was inhibited by an andrographolide from Andrographis. bisabolol and levomenol from Matricaria recutita and Myoporum crassifolium blocked NS3 protease in virtual screening. a virtual screen of 36 million compounds led to the selection of two molecules. scientists are evaluating repurposing of several FDA approved drugs against ZIKV infections. chloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline, readily increases the pH of acidic vesicles and inhibits conformational change essential for fusion between the virus envelope and endosomal membrane. a pro-caspase inhibitor, emricasan, successfully protected both neural cell monolayers and three-dimensional organoid cultures of neural cells by decreasing ZIKV-induced caspase-3. the selection criteria included a selectivity index, maximum activity, and the EC50 of compounds. azithromycin, a commercially available antibiotic, was also found to inhibit ZIKV proliferation in cultured brain cells. bromocriptine inhibits the activity of the ZIKV-NS2B-NS3 protease. it inhibits the early steps of ZIKV binding/entry. the safe pediatric anti-protozoan and anti-viral drug nitazoxanide was found to affect post-attachment steps of ZIKV infection. Memantine was found to bind non-competitively with NMDAR. it blocked only the pathologically active NMDAR and left its physiological activity unaffected. it could be used safely to reduce neurological complications associated with ZIKV infection. alasubramanian et al., 2016), and daptomycin B (Barrows et al., 2016), category C drugs chloroquine (Delvecchio et al., 2016), amodiaquine, quinacrine hydrochloride (Balasubramanian et al., 2016), auranofin, clofazimine, deferasirox, methoxsalen, micafungin, sertra convalescent serum neutralizes multiple strains of infectious ZIKV or ZIKV RVPs. antibodies present in convalescent serum can cross the placental, as well as the blood-brain barrier of fetuses. at all of the tested pHs, C10 bound ZIKV E protein at different positions. at pH 8.0, it bound at the intradimer interface; at pH 6.5, it bound the virus surface; and at pH 5.0, it blocks raft structure. different structural rearrangements of the virus were blocked by C10 antibodies. viremia is increased in the presence of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies against a heterologous flavivirus strain. preincubation of human myeloid cells (U937) resulted in increased ZIKV infectivity. two EDI/II cross-reactive mAbs developed against ZIKV (ZKA78) and DENV (DV82) were tested for their capacity for ADE of DENV and ZIKV infection in animal models. wild-type mAbs ZKA78 and DV82 (without the LALA mutation), when administered prior to DENV-2 infection, resulted in severe disease and death of mice on the 5th day post-infection. the binding of the Fc region of an antibody with gamma receptors triggers their effector function. in the case of ZIKV or DENV, the virus-antibody immune complex is internalized by FcRs. such engineered antibodies are incapable of interaction with FcRs. anti-ZIKV mAbs with the LALA mutation have been engineered for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. the EDIII-specific neutralizing mAb ZKA64 blocked ADE in ZIKV infections in K652 cells in the presence of convalescent serum. mAbs such as Z23 and Z3L1 are of great importance in limiting ZIKV. a patent has been granted to Baehner et al. (2015), who modified the Fc region of human antibody, reducing its affinity for FcRs by 1.15 to 100 folds and resulting in the inhibition of signaling cascades that lead to downstream immune response such as ADE in the case of DENV and ZIKV infection. out of 2263 plant-derived secondary metabolites tested, 43 compounds docked with at least one of the ZIKV enzymatic proteins. some of these include balsacone B from Populus balsamifera, kanzonol V from Glycyrrhiza glabra, cinnamoylechinaxanthol from Echinacea, cimiphenol from Actaea racemosa, and rosemarinic acid from Rosmarin Carba-nucleoside analogs for antiviral treatment WO2009132123A1 29.10.2009 Application Cho et al., 2009 2.

Compositions and methods for bithionol inhibits caspases and has been found to be effective in reducing the negative effects of ZIKV and bacterial and plant toxins. elucidation of such host proteins that further disease can be used to design drugs for ZIKV. Metadichol has shown activity against ZIKV, EBOV, SARS coronavirus, JEV, WNV, and YFV. it is sold as a nutritional supplement in some Asian countries and is well tolerated. testing of other broad-spectrum anti-viral agents for anti-ZIKV activity will aid in rapid drug discovery to combat this virus. synthesis Kok, 2016 7-deaza-2\u2032-C-methyladenosine \u2013 Zmurko et al., 2016 2\u2032-C-ethynyl analog of 5\u2032-triphosphates \u2013 Lu et al., 2016 Active metabolite 2\u2032-fluoro-2-C-methyl-UTP Bind to active site present on NS5 \u2013 Reznik and Ashby, 2017 NITD008 adenosine er serum Reduction in caspase activity \u2013 Li et al., 2016 Prevent thinning of the cortical plate (CP) and ventricular zone (VZ)/subventricular zone (SVZ) \u2013 Prevention of neural progenitor cell death in infected fetal brain tissue and prevention of microcephaly. purine and pyrimidine synthesis C Barrows et al., 2016 Cyclosporine A Immunosuppression by selectively inhibiting cytokine-induced DNA binding of activator protein-1 and NF-B. cytokine-induced DNA binding of activator protein-1 and NF-B. azole Antihelminthic microtubule inhibitor C Albendazole Anthelmintic microtubule inhibitor C Azithromycin Antibacterial B Retallack et al., 2016 Quinacrine, Mefloquine, and GSK369796 Antimalarial drug inhibiting autophagy C Balasubramanian et al., 2016 Sinefungin Antifungal antibiotic Not approved Albulescu et al., 2017 Suramin African trypano al., 2012; Tang et al., 2012; Ching et al., 2016; Saxena et al., 2016; Saxena et al., 2016 Anti-inflammatory drugs + Andrographispaniculata Inhibit ZIKV replication. Feranchuk et al., 2016 Bisabololand levomenol from Matricariarecutita and Myoporumcrassifolium In therapies include cytokines, TLRs, siRNA, RNA interference, probiotics, immunomodulatory interventions, and nanodrug delivery. prospective aspects of these valuable therapies could be given a due focus for designing and developing effective drugs, medicines, therapeutics and immunomodulatory pharmaceuticals. ZIKV first binds to cell receptors, including AXL (Nowakowski et al., 2016), DC-SIGN, Tyro3, TIM, and TAM (Hamel et al., 2015), and then enters cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. TIM1 receptors mediate viral entry after binding with viral phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine. virions are released by exocytosis at endoplasmic reticulum. virions are released by exocytosis at endoplasmic reticulum. nanchangmycin is a polyether obtained from Streptomyces nanchangensis. it is considered to act by targeting AXL receptors and blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis. however, the exact mechanism of action of nanchangmycin is unknown. Chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, raises endolysosomal pH and inhibits ZIKV infection in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, human neural stem cells, and mouse neurospheres. a molecule under pre-clinical study was tested as an inhibitor of endocytosis to obstruct ZIKV infection. nanchangmycin, a polyether obtained from Streptomyces nanchangensis, has been shown to block ZIKV replication in in vitro. it is considered to act by targeting AXL receptors and blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis. but the exact mechanism of action of nanchangmycin is unknown. chloroquine raises endolysosomal pH and inhibits ZIKV infection in human brain microvascular endothelial cells, human neural stem cells, and mouse neurospheres. saliPhe, a molecule under pre-clinical study and vATPase inhibitor, was tested as an inhibitor of endocytosis to obstruct ZIKV infection. the NS5 protein plays an important role in viral RNA synthesis. the helicase domain of NS3 is activated by GTPS (triphosphate) it facilitates the unwinding and translocation of RNA at the time of replication. numerous drugs involved in inhibition of virus replication have been portrayed in Figure 2. nascent NS5 has two major catalytic domains: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and methyltransferase domain. inhibition of NS5 The flaviviral NS5 protein has two major catalytic domains. the first domain is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the second is a methyltransferase domain. NS5 is also involved in IFN antagonism. 7-deaza-2\u2032-C-methyladenosine, developed as an HCV replication inhibitor, was also evaluated for inhibition of ZIKV replication in vero cells and a mouse model. the drug delayed the onset of viremia and virus-induced morbidity and mortality in infected mice. the regimen containing sofosbuvir was found to be clinically safe and efficacious. it is a class B drug and can be used in men and non-pregnant women. the 2\u2032-C-ethynyl and 2\u2032-C-methyl analog of 5\u2032-triphosphates were found to be incorporated by the RdRp of ZIKV. the helicase action of NS3 is inhibited by divalent cations that cause GTPS to adopt an extended conformation. this critical substrate-binding pocket may be a good target for anti-virals. tetrapeptide-boronic acid would be a potent inhibitor of the NS2B-NS3 protease. berberine, an FDA-approved quaternary ammonium salt used against DENV, has a high binding affinity to the NS3 protease of ZIKV. a \u2018Hybrid Combinatorial Substrate Library\u2019 approach has also been used to determine the substrate specificity of the NS2B-NS3 protease. inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and viral polymerase is key to anti-viral activity of ribavirin against flaviviruses. mycophenolic acid (MPA) is an IMPDH inhibitor and exhibited potent dose-dependent anti ZIKV activity (EC50 >50 M) ST-148 mediates the self-interaction of capsid proteins and imposes structural rigidity. the concept of capsid protein stabilization may also be applicable to ZIKV. NS5 is also involved in IFN antagonism. nucleosides do not target the active RdRp site; they terminate elongation of the nascent viral RNA chain. another nucleoside analog, 7-deaza-2\u2032-C-methyladenosine, developed initially as an HCV replication inhibitor, was also evaluated for inhibition of ZIKV replication in vero cells. the regimen containing sofosbuvir was found to be clinically safe and efficacious. it is a class B drug and can be used in men and non-pregnant women. the 2\u2032-C-ethynyl and 2\u2032-C-methyl analog of 5\u2032-triphosphates were found to be incorporated by the RdRp of ZIKV. sinefungin was able to attach to methyltransferases and methyltransferase activity. toxicity was observed with this drug in animal studies conducted in dogs and goats while its usage as an anti-parasitic agent. less toxic and better tolerated derivatives must be obtained and tested against ZIKV. -2\u2032-C-methyladenosine at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day delayed the onset of viremia and virus-induced morbidity and mortality in infected mice. the drug remained unsuccessful in the phase I clinical trial conducted. adenosine derivative originally isolated from Streptomyces griseoleus is a potential anti-fungal and anti-parasitic compound that competitively inhibits S-adenosyl-1-methionine (SAM) sinefungin is a potential anti-fungal and anti-parasitic compound that competitively inhibits S-adenosyl-1-methionine (SAM) the helicase action of NS3 is inhibited by divalent cations that cause GTPS to adopt an extended conformation. the helicase of ZIKV is closely related to those of other members of the family Flaviviridae. drugs that target the helicase of these viruses could also be explored. CN-716, a capped peptidomimetic boronic-acid compound, has been found to form ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitor complex. inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and viral polymerase is key to anti-viral activity of ribavirin against flaviviruses. a single small-molecule inhibitor (ST-148) has been identified. it is non-mutagenic and selectively inhibits flaviviruses. the concept of capsid protein stabilization may also be applicable to ZIKV. understanding the ZIKV structure would aid in designing anti-viral therapies to curtail ZIKV infections. the NS5 polymerase was inhibited by an andrographolide from Andrographis. bisabolol and levomenol from Matricaria recutita and Myoporum crassifolium blocked NS3 protease. the therapeutics based on enzyme, nucleoside, and capsid inhibitors are currently in their infancy. in vivo validation is a prior requisite to move them from bench to bedside. scientists are evaluating repurposing of several FDA approved drugs against ZIKV infections. Xu M. et al. (2016) screened a panel of compounds containing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials, and pharmacologically active compounds to suppress infection-induced caspase activity. a pro-caspase inhibitor, emricasan, successfully protected both neural cell monolayers and three-dimensional organoid cultures of neural cells. bromocriptine inhibits the activity of the ZIKV-NS2B-NS3 protease, possibly by occupying the active site pocket. a fluorescence-based enzymatic assay also revealed that bromocriptine inhibits the activity of the ZIKV-NS2B-NS3 protease. memantine, MK-801, agmatine, and ifenprodil were found to prevent neuronal cell death caused by ZIKV under in vitro conditions without reducing viral titers. repurposing earlier approved drugs could help in formulating fascinating approaches to counter ZIKV. niclosamide (Xu M. et al., 2016), palonosetron (Pascoalino et al., 2016), mefloquine (Balasubramanian et al., 2016) and daptomycin B (Barrows et al., 2016), category C drugs chloroquine (Delvecchio et al., 2016), amodiaquine, quinacrine hydrochloride (Bala convalescent serum was able to neutralize multiple strains of infectious ZIKV or ZIKV RVPs. antigens present in convalescent serum can cross the placental and blood-brain barrier of fetuses. a human monoclonal antibody has been found to neutralize ZIKV E protein. mAbs were studied in extracellular (pH 8), early (pH 6.5) and late endosomal (pH 5.0) stages. at all the tested pHs, C10 bound ZIKV E protein at different positions. of 13 human mAbs from a single ZIKV patient, two mAbs (Z23 and Z3L1) potently bound and neutralized ZIKV, but it did not cross react with any DENV strains. studies regarding the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) are controversial. two EDI/II cross-reactive mAbs developed against ZIKV (ZKA78) and DENV (DV82) were tested for their capacity for ADE of DENV and ZIKV infection in animal models. in an AG129 mouse model, wild-type mAbs ZKA78 and DV82 resulted in severe disease and death of mice on the 5th day post-infection. the mutations are a leucine (L)-to-alanine (A) substitution at positions 234 and 235 (LALA) in the Fc region of antibodies. the binding of the Fc region of an antibody with gamma receptors (FcRs), expressed on various immune cells, triggers their effector function. anti-viral, is reduced (9), which results in an increase in the number of infectious virus particles (10) IFN/ are inhibited (11), diffuse out from the cell (12) and bind to their own receptors to reduce JAK-STAT signaling. anti-ZIKV mAbs with the LALA mutation have been engineered for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. a patent has been granted to Baehner et al. (2015), who modified the Fc region of human antibody, reducing its affinity for FcRs by 1.15 to 100 folds. curcumin, a common food additive, is able to reduce ZIKV infectivity by hindering the virus binding to host cell in a dose- and time-dependent manner. the structures of ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease, NS3 helicase, NS5 methyltransferase, and NS5-RdRp were generated by homology modeling. 43 compounds docked with at least one of the ZIKV enzymatic proteins. some of these include balsacone B from Populus balsamifera, kanzonol V from Glycyrrhiza gla Compounds used for the treatment of various flaviviral diseases that are readily adaptable to ZIKV are presented in Table 1.
