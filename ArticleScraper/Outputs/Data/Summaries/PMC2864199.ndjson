{"summary": "anoikis-resistant clone (HEK293ar) survived anoikis by the formation of cell-cell contacts. anoikis resistance in HEK293ar cells also required E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. pretreatment with LY294002 a phosphoinositide 3-kinase disrupted cell-cell contacts. cell-cell contact mediated resistance to anoikis implicates PI3K pathway in highly relevant cell model (HEK293ar) findings provide new evidence that HAb18G/CD147 cell-cell contact confers resistance in an E-cadherin-dependent manner. resistance to anoikis is emerging as a hallmark of metastatic cancer cells. it increases survival times in the absence of cell anchorage, facilitating migration and reattachment, and therefore increasing the probability of metastasis. CD147 has been reported as an anoikis suppressor, promoting anchorage-independent growth. a transformed cell line, human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293, was chosen as the model because our previous results confirmed that these cells express HAb18G/CD147. together, these two cell types provide an ideal model for exploring the role of cell-cell contacts in preventing anoikis. the mean sub-G1 proportions were 8.7, 11.7, and 15.1% respectively. this subpopulation maintained the anoikis resistance phenotype in vitro for 6 months. after 6-10 h suspension culture, the HEK293ar cells spontaneously and gradually formed cell-cell contacts and generated multi-cellular spheroids that could still grow as adhesion cultures. anoikis-resistant HEK293 cell subpopulation was obtained by sequential cycles of adhesion and suspension culture. apoptosis rate changed little during suspension culture of HEK293ar. the x and y-axes indicate the size of DNA and the number of cells counted. HAb18G/CD147 promotes HEK293ar cell survival in suspension. HEK293ar cells expressed significantly more HAb18G/CD147 than the parental cells after 24 h. positive immunofluorescence staining for CD147 was restricted to the cell-cell contacts of HEK293ar. two major forms of HAb18G/CD147 (43-66 and 35 kDa) were analyzed. -Tubulin was used as a loading control (n = 4-6) increased E-cadherin expression was confirmed in HEK293ar cells after 24 h suspension culture. no significant expression of E-cadherin was found in completely suspended parental HEK293 cells or in the initially suspended HEK293ar cells. HEK293ar and HEK293ar cells revealed by western blotting (n = 4-6) p 0.05, HEK293 versus HEK293ar. Figs. 4A, B and 4C show that E-cadherin expression decreased dramatically in HAb18G/CD147 siRNA-treated HEK293ar cells according to immunofluorescence staining density. blocking of E-cadherin binding by an anti-E-cadherin and inhibition of cell-cell contacts with EDTA showed no significant effect on HAb18G/CD147 expression. HAb18G/CD147 knockdown reduces expression of E-cadherin. Western blotting to reveal E-cadherin in HEK293 cells in suspension culture. ar cells in E-cadherin RNA interference (n = 4-6) p 0.01, siRNA versus scrambled. PI3K pathway involved in cell-cell contact-directed survival. HEK293ar spheroids were treated with LY294002 (a specific competitive PI3K inhibitor) LY294002 treatment decreased the cell number of HEK293ar in suspension in a dose-dependent manner. the cellular DNA content via fluorescent dye binding is closely proportional to cell number based on the instruction of the assay kit. PD98059 did not significantly affect the relative fluorescent intensity even at 50 mol/l. anoikis-resistant HEK293ar cells survive anoikis by the formation of cell-cell contacts. apoptotic ratio in HEK293ar cells was lower than in the parental cells. this subpopulation maintained the anoikis resistance phenotype in vitro for 6 months. cells within the multi-cellular spheroids adhered laterally to each other through diverse intercellular junctions. cells within the spheroids adhered laterally to each other through diverse intercellular junctions. pretreatment with EDTA solution to disrupt calcium-dependent cell-cell contacts also disrupted the adhesions. the morphology of HEK293ar and parental HEK293 cells in suspension and adhesion culture revealed by microscopy (n = 4-10) the cells were viewed in 4-10 independent sections (at least 100 cells/section) positive immunofluorescence staining for CD147 was restricted to the cell-cell contacts of HEK293ar. these results may imply a correlation between HAb18G/CD147expression and cell-cell contacts-directed anoikis resistance. the level of HAb18G/CD147 expression was similar in both cell types in adhesion culture. the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) -Tubulin was used as a loading control. -Tubulin was used as a loading control. 93 cells or in the initially suspended HEK293ar cells were found by immunofluorescence. a 70-80% reduction of E-cadherin expression by siRNA (Fig. 3D, E; ** p 0.01) totally inhibited cell-cell contacts formation and decreased the degree of cell aggregation. the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. the cells were viewed in 4-6 independent sections (at least 300 cells/section) escence staining density was analyzed by Image Pro Plus 6.0 3-DS software, **p 0.01, data not shown. blocking of E-cadherin binding by an anti-E-cadherin and inhibition of cell-cell contacts with EDTA showed no significant effect on HAb18G/CD147 expression at the single cell level. bulin was used as loading control. p 0.01, siRNA versus scrambled. each value represents the mean SD of triplicate determinations. PI3K pathway is involved in cell-cell mediated resistance to anoikis. HEK293ar spheroids were treated with LY294002 (a specific competitive PI3K inhibitor) or PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor) ly294002 (50 mol/l) inhibited cell-cell contacts formation. suppression of anoikis in HEK293ar mediated by cell-cell contacts involves the PI3K/Akt pathway. the cells were counted in 4-10 independent sections (at least 300 nuclei/section) the effect of signal pathway inhibition on the survival of cells in suspension. anoikis resistance is a key to the survival of cells in malignant transformation and metastasis [18,19] it may also be a key to the adaptation of cells to suspension culture and spheroids growth used in engineering. cell-cell adhesion suppresses anoikis in an E-cadherin-dependent manner. in addition, cell-cell adhesion-based survival signals may inhibit anoikis in a PI3K/AKT-dependent manner. the role of HAb18G/CD147-mediated cell-cell contacts in HEK293ar cells remains obscure. cell contact-triggered cell survival involves anti-apoptotic signalling through E-cadherin-, Src-, and PI3K/Akt-dependent pathways [15,25] in squamous carcinoma and normal proximal tubular cells. high levels of E-cadherin expression inhibited anoikis by mediating cell-cell contacts upon cell-matrix detachment, which was required by HAb18G/CD147. ly294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, significantly reduced the effect of HAb18G/CD147 on cell survival. ly294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, significantly reduced the effect of HAb18G/CD147 on cell adhesion and metastatic invasion (p 0.01) of human hepatoma cells. a sophisticated anoikis-resistant model has developed a novel role of HAb18G/CD147 in cell-cell adhesion leading to anoikis resistance and cell spheroid growth. the results support the observation that HAb18G/CD147 confers anoikis resistance through E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts. the results should be relevant to a bitter understanding of the cell survival mechanism seen in tumor progression. flasks were coated with 1.5-2.0% sterilized agar and supplemented with RPMI 1640/10% FBS. every 2-3 days, the culture flask was refed regularly by carefully removing the old medium and adding 10-15 ml fresh methocel medium. all cultures were monitored routinely and to ensure they were free of mycoplasma, fungal and bacterial contamination. each sample was viewed in 4-10 independent sections (at least 100 cells/section) each sample was viewed in 4-10 independent sections. cells from detached and attached cultures were scored for incidence of TUNEL (+) staining using phase-contrast microscopy. a minimum of 1/104 cells was examined at least three times. gating of the side-scatter plot excluded debris and gating of the pulse width plot excluded any remaining cell aggregates from analysis. cells seeded at 2 105/ml were treated with 0 or 10 mmol/l EDTA. two major forms of HAb18G/CD147 (43-66 and 35 kDa) were analyzed as previously described. the immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate detection system (GE, Healthcare, USA) the treated cells were cultured under cell-detachment conditions for the indicated times. cell-cell contacts were observed with an inverted phase-contrast microscope. cell number was evaluated with a CyQUANT\u00ae NF Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. all cultures were monitored routinely to ensure they were free of mycoplasma, fungal and bacterial contamination. all cell lines were discarded after two months and new lines were propagated from frozen stocks. siRNA transfection A small interfering RNA targeting E-cadherin was generated. each sample was viewed in 4-10 independent sections (at least 100 cells/section) to detect the fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells, a DeadENDEM Colorimetric TUNEL System (Promega, USA) was used to detect the fragmented DNA of apoptotic cells. cells seeded at 2 105/ml in agar-coated six-well plates were treated with 0 or 10 mmol/l EDTA for 12 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were treated with 10 g/ml mouse anti-E-cadherin (Abcam Ltd.
