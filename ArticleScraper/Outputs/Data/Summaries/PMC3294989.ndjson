{"summary": "the study investigated all respiratory outbreaks in long-term care facilities. the number and timing of specimens collected was left to the discretion of the attending physicians. the regional clinical laboratories cultured specimens for bacteria and performed rapid viral antigen testing for influenza A/B and RSV. a total of 987 specimens were tested (average 3.7 samples/outbreak) of the 234 (79%) outbreaks for which a pathogen was identified, 174 (59%) pathogens were determined to be ENT/HRV. other viruses were identified for 2% of outbreaks. samples from patients involved in these outbreaks were confirmed to contain HRV; no other causative bacteria or viruses were identified. clinical data were available for 7 of 13 of the patients who died. tree was constructed by using a 549-bp nt region encoding viral capsid protein (VP) 4/VP2 along with strains representative of HRV species A, B, and C. Scale bar represents 0.1% of nucleotide changes between close relatives. a causal association between HRV and severe disease must be made cautiously. despite limitations for epidemiologic data collection, no pathogens other than HRV could explain these outbreaks and associated deaths."}
