{"summary": "a four-fold or greater increase of IgG-titres against respiratory viruses in pair sera was tested. viral etiology was considered definitive if at least one of the above tests was positive. pneumonia ranks fifth among all causes of death in humans. there are limited data regarding the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) worldwide and in china. this may lead to inappropriate antimicrobial therapy and emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. CAP was defined as the presence of a new infiltrate on the chest radiographs. a new cough or sputum or change in respiratory symptoms, or fever, or sign of consolidation of lung or rales, or leucopenia. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. volunteers without clues of acute illnesses within one month were also enrolled and sampled for throat swabs. logistic regression analysis was applied to test whether or not certain clinical features on admission were associated with specific virus infection. the other variables included age (years), sex, current smoking status, sick contact with febrile patients, numbers of comorbidity, presence of fever 39\u00b0C, myalgia, headache, fatigue, dry cough, coryza, sore throat, hemoptysis, chest tightness or pain, dyspnea. CAP was defined as the presence of a new infiltrate on the chest radiographs. a new cough or sputum or change in respiratory symptoms, or fever, or sign of consolidation of lung or rales, or leucopenia. the study was approved by the ethics committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. the study was routinely performed by hemagglutination inhibition assay [10] for detection of seasonal influenza virus type A and B (Flu A and B) and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A virus (A[H1N1]pdm09), indirect immunofluorescence (EUROIMMUN, L\u00fcbeck, German) for detection of parainfluenza virus type logistic regression analysis was applied to test whether clinical features on admission were associated with specific virus infection. other variables included age (years), sex, current smoking status, sick contact with febrile patients, numbers of comorbidity, presence of fever 39\u00b0C, myalgia, headache, fatigue, dry cough, coryza, sore throat, hemoptysis, chest tightness or pain, dyspnea, and neutrophilia. eighty-nine patients had at least one underlying condition (Table 1). Swab samples were available in all patients and volunteers. paired sera in 70 cases of CAP patients and in all ILI patients. 58 viruses from CAP patients were detected by shell-vial cell culture system. 18 viruses were detected by shell-vial cell culture system. 47 viruses by NATs and 20 viruses by serological survey. fected patients manifested hemoptysis and chest pain. leukocytosis and neutrophilia were less common in viral pneumonia patients. fatigue and neutrophilia were less common in viral pneumonia patients. 2(40.0) 9(17.3) 10(10.3) 0.222 Current smoking 3(12.5) 1(20.0) 0 0 2(20.0) 0 0 1(25.0) 7(13.5) 19(19.6) 0.348 Clinical symptoms Fever 39\u00b0C 14(58.3) 3(60.0) 2(100) 1(50.0) 6(60.0) 1(50.0) 0 0 1(25.0) 7(13.5) 19(19.6) Hemoptysis 2(8.3) 0 0 0 2(20.0) 0 0 0 4(7.7) 3(3.1) 0.391 Chest tightness or pain 6(25.0) 0 0 0 1(10.0) 2(100) 1(50.0) 0 10(19.2) 22(22.7) 0.625 Dyspnea 12(50.0) 3(60.0) 0 1(50.0) 4(40.0 leukocytosis was defined as leukocyte count >10 109/L. neutrophil count was defined as lymphocyte count 0.8 109/L. data were available only in some patients. 0 0 1(10.0) 0 0 0 4(7.7) 5(5.2) 0.720 ICU admission 1(4.2) 0 0 0 0 0 1(1.9) 3(3.1) 0.912 30-days mortality 1(4.2) 1(20.0) 0 0 1(10.0) 0 0 0 3(5.7) 2(2.1) 0.343 Note: *All data were shown as numbers (%) unless otherwise specified. only one infected patient received oral oseltamivir before and during his hospitalization. all but five CAP patients recovered during our one month observation. one COPD patient who was diagnosed with seasonal influenza A pneumonia developed respiratory failure and denied invasive ventilation and ICU admission. the extreme sensitivity of the NATs was thought to be due to false-positive previously. in both ILI and pneumonia patients, seroconversion of IgG did not happen in all viral positive patients. in both ILI and pneumonia patients, seroconversion of IgG did not happen in all viral positive patients. bations of COPD and concomitant pneumonia in Hongkong, while in new Zealand, rhinovirus was the most commonly identified pathogen, followed by influenza virus and RSV. differences in prevalence of specific virus infection may relate to diverse geographical, climate, activity of the virus pandemic in the community locally, testing assays applied and the viral pattern studied. virus infection predisposes the respiratory tract to superinfection by another pathogen, with bacteria the most common [27-29]. neuraminidase inhibitors are a variable in the severe disease model. neuraminidase inhibitors can be used to treat viral pneumonia patients. atypical pathogens and bacteria were not studied. comparisons of clinical characteristics were only made between virus positive patients and virus negative patients. authors declare that they have no competing interests. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. prepub Acknowledgement The authors thank Qundi Huang, Shiguan Wu and other staff members."}
