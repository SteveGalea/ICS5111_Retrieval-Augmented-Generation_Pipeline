{"summary": "herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is an important pathogen for humans. the first symptoms include a prodromal flu-like syndrome with fever, headache, malaise, diffuse myalgias, followed by local symptoms consisting of itching and painful papules. recurrent herpes labialis is the most frequent clinical manifestation of reactivated HSV-1 infection. Medicinal plants produce a variety of chemical constituents with the potential to inhibit viral replication. compounds from natural sources are of interest as possible sources to control viral infection. natural products are still major sources of innovative therapeutic agents for various conditions. tea tree oil [27], thyme oil [28] and manuka oil [14] have been published. some phenylpropanes, triterpenes and sesquiterpenes had been tested for their antiviral activity against different herpesviruses and rhinovirus. only limited information about sesquiterpenes concerning the inhibition of the viral replication cycle is currently available. all phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenes met high purity standards. high contents of eugenol in clove oil and trans-anethole in star anise oil have been reported previously. infectivity titers were determined by a standard plaque assay on confluent RC-37 cells. cells were seeded onto 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. the medium was removed and fresh DMEM containing the appropriate dilution of the essential oil or compounds was added onto subconfluent cells. DMEM or phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenes were incubated for 1 h at room-temperature. the residual inoculum was replaced by medium containing 0.5% methylcellulose. monolayers were fixed with 10% formalin and plaques were counted. each concentration was performed in three replicates. the selectivity index (SI) was determined by the ratio of TC50 to IC50. all experiments were performed in triplicate, and three independent experiments were conducted. a P-value of.05 was considered statistically significant. cell culture and HSV-1 RC-37 cells were grown in monolayer culture. cells were plated onto 96-well and 6-well culture plates for cytotoxicity and antiviral assays. the monolayers were serially passaged whenever they became confluent. 1% ethanol but no drug were also included on each plate as controls. cytotoxic concentration of the drug that reduced viable cell number by 50% was determined. the maximum noncytotoxic concentration was always used to evaluate the mode of antiviral action. cell monolayers were pretreated with drugs prior to inoculation with virus by adding the oil or compounds to the medium. the effect of essential oil or components against HSV was also tested during the replication period by addition of drugs after cell infection to the overlay medium. the maximum noncytotoxic concentrations were determined between 9 g mL1 and 100 g mL1 for star anise oil. similar results were found for TC50 values, for example, 18 g mL1 for -caryophyllene oxide and 160 g mL1 for star anise oil. star anise oil, trans-anethole, eugenol, -eudesmol, farnesol, -caryophyllene and -caryophyllene oxide were ted for 1 h at room-temperature with various concentrations of star anise oil, trans-anethole, eugenol, -eudesmol, farnesol, -caryophyllene and -caryophyl Diluted drugs were tested up to the maximum noncytotoxic concentration. number of virus plaques was determined 3 days after infection and compared to untreated control. results are presented as percentage of plaque reduction. number of virus plaques was determined 3 days after infection and compared to untreated control. results are the mean of three independent experiments SD and marked with asterisk. l 60 11.1 85 8.1 35 6.2 2.4 -Eudesmol 9 1.3 35 5.4 6 0.3 5.8 Farnesol 10 0.4 40 3.7 3.5 0.1 11.4 -Caryophyllene oxide 9 1.1 18 1.2 0.7 0.1 25.7 (a)Experiments were repeated independently and data presented are the mean of three experiments. star anise oil with a SI of 160 was the most effective drug. the essential oil of star anise suppressed herpesvirus infectivity by >99%. only trans-anethole, -caryophyllene and farnesol suppressed herpesvirus infectivity by >90%. acyclovir showed the highest antiviral activity when added during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of >99%. this drug inhibits specifically the viral DNA polymerase during the replication cycle when new viral DNA is synthesized. however, when the oil or compounds were added to the overlay medium after penetration of the viruses into the host cells, plaque formation was not significantly reduced. star anise oil and most compounds showed high levels of antiviral activity against HSV-1 in viral suspension tests. plaque formation was significantly reduced by >99% for star anise oil, phenylpropanoids and sesquiterpenes were able to suppress viral infection by 60\u201380% and 40\u201398%. eucalyptus essential oil inhibits cytomegalovirus [35], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [49] and rhinovirus [37]. sesquiterpene coumarins inhibit cytomegalovirus [35], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [49] and rhinovirus [37]. the application of tea tree oil, the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia, for the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis has been reported recently. the complex mixture of the essential oil revealed a higher antiviral activity and SI of 160. however -caryophyllene revealed a SI of 140, which is in the same range as the index value of 160. the essential oils and their components are known to be active against a wide variety of microorganisms. drugs with a high SI are preferable for antiviral treatment in patients. star anise oil as a complex mixture and -caryophyllene as single constituent might be applied as topical therapeutic agents."}
