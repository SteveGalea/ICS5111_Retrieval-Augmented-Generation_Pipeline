{"summary": "study case identification numbers were matched between the June 26, 2015, world health organization (WHO) line list (2) and daily text-based MERS reports from the south Korean MOHW (1). outcomes and covariates were publicly available for 159 of 186 case-patients as of July 15. logistic regression models for each risk factor showed that older age and having a concurrent health condition were associated with death. odds of dying were 7 times higher for persons with concurrent health conditions than for persons without these conditions. for every 1-year increase in age, odds of dying increased by 12%. time from onset to discharge decreased from 27 days during outbreak week 2 (IQR 22.0\u201332.0 days) to 19 days during week 7 (IQR 17.0\u201323.0). a 34% average increase in the hazard of discharge per week (p0.001), a 63% increase for health care workers (p = 0.046), and an 8% decrease for every 1-day increase in time-to-diagnosis. total cumulative cases over time were calculated by date of symptom onset. when date of outcome was unavailable, date of reporting was used. only case-patients with known outcomes (e.g., recovered, died) and dates of onset were included in the analyses. MERS in south Korea who had known outcomes were similar to those identified for MERS case-patients in Saudi Arabia (8\u201310) the CFR difference might be caused by differential prevalence of risk factors but also by treatment or surveillance disparities."}
