{"summary": "human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has occurred in household, work environment, and health care settings (4, 5), raising concerns of its potential to cause a pandemic similar to that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003 (6). the extended region in MERS-CoV S-RBD is much longer than that in SARS-CoV S-RBD. it has been proven that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) is the functional receptor of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV S-RBD-Fc could be recognized by an MERS-CoV S-specific polyclonal antibody (1:1,000). SARS-CoV S-RBD-Fc could not react with this antibody, as detected by Western blotting. the binding of MERS-CoV S-RBD to DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells could be blocked by sDPP4. the binding of MERS-CoV S-RBD-Fc to Huh-7 cells could be blocked by sDPP4. MERS-CoV S-RBD-Fc (red line) bound strongly to Huh-7 cells that express a high level of DPP4. SARS-CoV S-RBD-Fc did not bind to Huh-7 cells (blue line) a clear band (corresponding to the size of DPP4 at 110 kDa) was detected from the beads that were preincubated with the mixture of MERS-CoV S-RBD-Fc and COS-7 or the mixture of SARS-CoV S-RBD-Fc and ACE2 in the ACE2/293T cell lysates. ELISA showed no significant binding of MERS-CoV S-RBD-Fc with sDPP4. results consistent with those detected by flow cytometry. fusing MERS-CoV S-RBD plus a 6His tag and stop codon into the Fc vector. titers were determined as the highest serum dilutions that completely prevented cytopathic effect (CPE) in at least 50% of the wells. the titers were relatively lower than those of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody induced by SARS-CoV. neutralizing antibody responses induced by MERS-CoV S-RBD-Fc protein may be strong enough to protect vaccinated animals against MERS-CoV infection. a 286-amino-acid fragment (residues 377 to 662) of the MERS-CoV S protein contains the viral RBD."}
