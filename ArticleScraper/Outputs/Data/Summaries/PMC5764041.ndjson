{"summary": "Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) occurs most commonly in pigs at 16 to 20 wk of age. affected pigs exhibit cough and fever, and stop eating. commercial vaccines Two inactivated M. hyopneumoniae bacterins were used in this study. all vaccines used in this study were administered according to manufacturer's label claims. hyopneumoniae strain SNU98703 induced severe pneumonia in lungs and lymphoid depletion in the lymph node in infected pigs (7). co-infection with the identical PCV2 strain SNUVR000463 and PRRSV strain SNUVR090851 also induced similar symptoms as did the previous co-infection (8). the pigs in UnVac/UnCh (n = 12) group were randomly placed into 12 pens in the one remaining room. each dose contained 2.0 mL, and was administered into separate anatomical sites on the neck to prevent the vaccines from forming a mixture. the pigs in Zoetis-VacA/Ch were concurrently administered one dose of each of Fostera PCV MH on the left side of the neck. the pigs in unvac/Ch and unvac/UnCh groups were inoculated with PRRSV and M. hyopneumoniae. pigs in Zoetis-VacA/Ch, Zoetis-VacB/Ch, BI-Vac/Ch, and unVac/Ch were intranasally administered a 3 mL inoculation of PCV2 containing 1.2 105 TCID50/mL. blood and nasal swabs were collected at 35, 28, 14, 7, 0, 7, 14, 56, and 119 dpc. the live weight of each pig was measured at 35 dpc (21 d of age), 0 dpc (56 d of age), 28 dpc (84 d of age), 56 dpc (84 d of age), 84 dpc (140 d of age), and 119 dpc (175 d of age) the average daily gain (ADG; grams/pig/day) was analyzed over 5 time periods. serum samples were tested for antibodies to PRRSV (IDEXX PRRS X3 Ab test; IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA), M. hyopneumoniae (M. hyo. Ab test; IDEXX Laboratories), and PCV2 (PCV2 Ab Mono Blocking; Synbiotics, Lyon, France) mycoplasmal pneumonia lesions were scored (0 to 4) based on the severity of interstitial pneumonia as previously described (15). the PCV2-associated lymphoid lesions were scored (0 to 3) based on the severity of lymphoid depletion and granulomatous inflammation (22). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH) for PRRSV and PCV2 was done as previously described (24). measures or proportion test was used for the dichotomized endpoints. clinical score PRRSV induced lung microscopic lesion score, mycoplasmal lung microscopic lesion scores, PCV2-associated lymphoid lesions core, and ISH of M. hyopneumoniae. all vaccines used in this study were administered according to manufacturer\u2019s label claims. all vaccines were administered according to the manufacturer\u2019s label claims. inocula The PRRSV strain SNUVR090851 was used as inocula. the pigs in groups were randomly assigned into 8 out of 9 rooms. each room had 12 pens and each pig was housed individually in a pen. each dose contained 2.0 mL, and was administered into separate anatomical sites on the neck. at 49 d post-challenge, the pigs in Zoetis-VacA/Ch group were concurrently administered one dose of each of Fostera PCV MetaStim on the left side of the neck. pigs were intranasally administered a 3 mL inoculation of PRRSV containing 1.2 105 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL. pigs were anesthetized with a mixture of 2.2 mg/kg BW tiletamine hydrochloride and 2.2 mg/kg BW tiletamine hydrochloride. the live weight of each pig was measured at 35 dpc (21 d of age), 0 dpc (56 d of age), 28 dpc (84 dpc), 56 dpc (112 d of age), 84 dpc (140 d of age), and 119 dpc (175 d of age) the average daily gain was analyzed over 5 time periods. real-time PCR for the vaccine viruses was also done to quantify PRRSV genomic cDNA copy (16,17) Quantification of M. hyopneumoniae DNA in nasal swabs. serum samples were tested for antibodies to PRRSV (IDEXX PRRS X3 Ab test; IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA) pathology The total extent of gross lung lesions was estimated and calculated as previously described. the frequency distribution of the lung lesion scores for each lung lobe was calculated by treatment. mycoplasmal pneumonia lesions were scored (0 to 4) based on the severity of interstitial pneumonia. 10 fields were randomly selected and slides were scored ranging from 0 (no signal detectable) to 3 (intense labeling on the surface of several airway) the mean values were also calculated. the overall mortality rate was significantly lower (P 0.05) in pigs from Zoetis-VacA/Ch (0.06%, 1/18), Zoetis-VacB/Ch (0.06%, 1/18), BI-Vac/Ch (0.06%, 1/18), and UnVac/UnCh (0%) group. diagnostic results indicated mortality was primarily related to severe pneumonia and granulomatous lymphadenitis. pigs in the Zoetis-VacA/Ch, Zoetis-VacB/Ch, and BI-Vac/Ch had a significantly lower (P 0.05) number of genomic copies of PRRSV in their sera than pigs in unVac/. no genomic copies of PRRSV were detected in any of the serum samples from UnVac/UnCh group. Pigs in BI-Vac/Ch group had a significantly higher number of genomic copies of M. hyopneumoniae in their nasal swabs than pigs in Zoetis-VacA/Ch, Zoetis-VacB/Ch, and BI-Vac/Ch groups. tis-VacB/Ch groups had a significantly higher number of genomic copies of PCV2 in their sera than pigs in Zoetis-VacA/Ch, Zoetis-VacB/Ch, and BI-Vac/Ch groups from 7 to 119 dpc. no genomic copies of PCV2 were detected in any of the serum samples from any of the 5 groups. pigs in the Zoetis-VacA/Ch and Zoetis-VacB/Ch and unVac/UnCh groups had significantly higher anti-M. hyopneumoniae antibody levels. no anti-M. hyopneumoniae antibodies or M. hyopneumoniae-specific IFN--SC were detected in the unvac/UnCh group. pigs from Zoetis-VacA/Ch, Zoetis-VacB/Ch, and BI-Vac/Ch groups had significantly lower (P 0.05) scores for macroscopic lung lesions than pigs from BI-Vac/Ch group at 119 dpc. no macroscopic lung lesions, and microscopic lung and lymphoid lesions in pigs from unvac/UnCh group. Pigs from Zoetis-VacA/Ch, Zoetis-VacB/Ch, and BI-Vac groups had significantly lower amounts of PRRSV antigen, M. h. pigs from unVac/UnCh group had significantly lower amounts of PCV2 antigen in their lymph nodes compared to pigs from unVac/UnCh group at 119 dpc. no PRRSV antigen, M. hyopneumoniae nucleic acid, and PCV2 antigen in lung and lymph node was detected in pigs from unVac/UnCh group at 119 dpc. different letters within a sampling point mean statistically significant differences (P 0.05) the overall ADG (from 3 to 25 wk of age) in pigs from Zoetis-VacA/Ch, Zoetis-VacB/Ch, BI-Vac/Ch, and UnVac/UnCh groups was significantly higher (P 0.05) compared to UnVac/Ch group from 7 to 119 dpc. pigs in the Zoetis-VacA/Ch, Zoetis-VacB/Ch, and BI-Vac/Ch group had a significantly lower (P 0.05) number of genomic copies of PRRSV in their sera than pigs in unVac/Ch group from 7 to 56 dpc. no genomic copies of PRRSV were detected in any of the serum samples. Pigs in unVac/Ch group had a significantly higher (P 0.05) number of genomic copies of M. hyopneumoniae in their nasal swabs than pigs in Zoetis-VacA/Ch, Zoetis-VacB/Ch, and BI-Vac/Ch groups at 0 to 28 dpc. Pigs in BI-Vac/Ch group had significantly higher (P 0.05) number of genomic copies of PCV2 in their sera than pigs in Zoetis-VacA/Ch and Zoetis-VacB/Ch groups from 7 to 56 dpc. no genomic copies of PCV2 were detected in any of the serum samples from UnVac/UnCh group. pigs in the Zoetis-VacA/Ch and Zoetis-VacB/Ch groups had significantly higher anti-M. hyopneumoniae antibodies and numbers of M. hyopneumoniae-specific IFN--SC compared to pigs in the BI-Vac/Ch and UnVac/Ch groups. pigs from BI-Vac/Ch group had significantly lower scores for macroscopic lung lesions than pigs from unvac/UnCh group at 119 dpc. there were no macroscopic lung lesions, and microscopic lung and lymphoid lesions in pigs from unvac/UnCh group at 119 dpc.
