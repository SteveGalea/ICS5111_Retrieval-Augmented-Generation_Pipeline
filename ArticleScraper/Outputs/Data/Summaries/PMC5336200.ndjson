{"summary": "a subgroup of immunity-related IFITMs (IFITM1-3) has been recognized to inhibit multiplication of a broad range of viruses. IFITM proteins consist of a variable cytoplasmic N-terminus followed by a conserved intramembrane domain, an intracellular loop, a transmembrane domain and a short variable and luminal C-terminus [4\u201311]. s are incorporated into lentiviral particles thereby reducing viral infectivity even though inhibition by IFITMs and virion incorporation of IFITMs were not intimately related. absence of IFITM3 expression was found to be associated with reduced FLUAV spread and pathogenesis in experimentally inoculated mice [26, 27] IFITM expression was shown to be a major contributor to the blockade of HIV-1 by treatment of cells with IFN [34], suggesting that IFITMs constitute important defenses against HIV-1 infection. some primate IFITM gene products were recently shown to have antiviral activity against SIV and HIV-1 infected humans. 293T cells were cotransfected with vector pQCXIP harboring rhIFITM3 proteins, huIFITM3 or CAT, an MLV gag-pol encoding plasmid and a plasmid encoding the viral glycoprotein to be tested. the antiviral activity of rhIFITM3 was analyzed as described previously. 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate were spin-oculated at 4,000g for 30 minutes with IFITM3 or CAT encoding vectors. the medium was replaced by 50l of fresh culture medium followed by the addition of 50l of MLV vectors harboring the viral glycoproteins. luciferase activities in cell lysates were analyzed at 72h post infection. animals included in the first cohort were previously used as a \u2018screening cohort\u2019 to search for polymorphisms influencing AIDS-free survival time and viral load in SIV infection. the second cohort consisted of macaques more recently infected, and viral load data were available for all animals. the DPZ is permitted to breed and house non-human primates under license number 392001/7 issued by the local veterinary authorities. all macaques were under daily surveillance by veterinarians and animal caretakers. the animals were usually housed in groups of 2\u20133 animals per cage. primers were designed using primer-BLAST [42] to avoid amplification of rhIFITM3(2) (LOC697564) or rhIFITM3 pseudogenes. PCR products were gel purified and sequenced using primers mamuIFITM3gen5-1forA, mamuIFITM3gen5-1rev and IF3gi-for. AIDS-free survival analysis, including a log-rank test for rhIFITM3 genotype-related differences, was performed using the SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) all p-values were two-sided. 293T cells were cotransfected with vector pQCXIP harboring rhIFITM3, huIFITM3 or CAT, an MLV gag-pol encoding plasmid and a plasmid encoding the viral glycoprotein to be tested. the antiviral activity of rhesus macaque IFITM3 was analyzed as described previously. rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of Indian origin were screened retrospectively for rhIFITM3 polymorphisms. the 39 animals included in the first cohort were previously used as a \u2018screening cohort\u2019 to search for polymorphisms influencing AIDS-free survival time. cohort 1 Cohort 2 No of macaques 39 55 Sex (%) Male 28 (72) 47 (85) Female 11 (28) 8 (15) Infecting SIVmac (%) 251 9 (23) 17 (31) 251/32H 13 (33) 0 251/32H/ex vivo, spleen 14 (36) 0 239 3 (8) 38 (69) Route of infection (%) Intravenous 25 (64) 25 (45) Intrarectal 4 (10) 13 (24) Tonsill animals were housed in groups of 2\u20133 animals per cage, with a minimum enclosure height of 180 cm and a cage volume of 3 to 4.5 m3. procedures for animal welfare and to minimize discomfort and suffering were undertaken in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall report. primers mamuIFITM3gen5-1forA, mamuIFITM3gen5-1rev and mamuIFITM3gen5-1rev were designed using primer-BLAST [42] to specifically avoid amplification of rhIFITM3(2) (LOC697564) or rhIFITM3 pseudogenes. PCR products were gel purified and sequenced using ABI Big Dye chemistry. log-rank test for rhIFITM3 genotype-related differences was performed using the SAS software version 9.4. the association between rhIFITM3 polymorphisms and virus load was assessed for statistical significance by either a Kruskal-Wallis test (three genotypes) or a Mann-Whitney test (two genotypes), as appropriate, using the GraphPad Prism software. rhIFITM3 exerts antiviral activity but does so less efficiently than huIFITM3. 293T cells expressing human (hu) and rhesus macaque (rh) IFITM3 as negative control were transduced with MLV particles encoding luciferase and harboring the indicated viral glycoproteins. three polymorphisms were located in the coding region but did not change the amino acid sequence. seven polymorphisms had a low level of heterozygosity (10%) but the two cohorts were found to be characterized by similar major allele frequencies. the missing introns in the pseudogenes are drawn as dashed lines. for each gene, the chromosome, gene symbol and reference accession number are indicated. polymorphisms g.270 C>T (genotype GT) and g.678 G>T (genotype GG) showed a nominally significant association with faster disease progression when all animals from both cohorts were considered. however, these associations were not observed when each cohort was analyzed separately. the polymorphisms are indicated above each diagram along with the p-values obtained by the log-rank test.
