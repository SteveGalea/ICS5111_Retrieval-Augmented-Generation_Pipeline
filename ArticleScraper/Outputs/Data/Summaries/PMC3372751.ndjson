{"summary": "a distinct CD4+ T-cell subset with immune suppressive properties called regulatory T (Treg) cells has been identified. this bottleneck has been overcome with the identification of a distinct CD4+ T-cell subset with immune suppressive properties called regulatory T (Treg) cells. mice with naturally occurring or targeted defects in foxp3 develop clinical features associated with systemic autoimmunity. studies using mouse models of parasitic, viral and bacterial infections have described an important role for CD25+ CD4 T cells in compromising host defence by suppressing the activation of protective immune components. however, the conclusions of initial studies using CD25 expression as a surrogate marker for Treg cells deserve critical re-evaluation using experimental strategies that identify and manipulate these cells based on Foxp3 expression. effects of Foxp3+ cell manipulation on host defence References Virus Herpes simplex virus 2 Protective Foxp3+ cell ablation accelerates mortality and increases viral load 22 Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Protective Foxp3+ cell ablation increases viral load 22 Parasite Plasmodium berghei No effect Foxp3+ cell ablation from baseline levels has no impact on survival or pathogen burden. sis detrimental Adoptive transfer of pathogen-specific Foxp3+ cells blunts effector cell expansion and increased pathogen burden 70 Host defence against acute infection. innate immune components keep infection at bay until pathogen-specific adaptive immune effectors more efficiently mediate pathogen eradication. first studies investigated infection susceptibility using Foxp3DTR mice to ablate Treg cells based on Foxp3 expression established protective roles for these cells in host defence against specific viral pathogens. despite potential for other inherent differences in these more recent studies where Treg cells were ablated based on Foxp3 expression compared with CD25 expression, these findings suggest that differences in how Treg cells are manipulated can lead to discordant conclusions. DT-induced ablation eliminated the impacts of IL-2 cytokine antibody complex treatment. more complex roles for Treg cells, immune stimulation and immune-related disease sequelae for human malaria infection in humans that are not recapitulated in mice. mice with expanded maternal Treg-cell expansion are markedly more susceptible to infection with intracellular bacterial pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica. fetal tolerance maintained by expanded maternal Treg cells also triggers fetal resorption and pregnancy loss. a significant portion of disseminated maternal infection cases occur without evidence of fetal direct invasion. the expansion of maternal Treg cells during pregnancy compromises host defence, and these immune defects are exploited by pathogens like Listeria and Salmonella with a predisposition for prenatal infection. the increasingly established heterogeneity and functional specialization among Foxp3+ cells opens up the exciting possibility of therapeutically dissociating the Treg-cell-mediated detrimental impacts on infection susceptibility against some pathogens. the ablation of each Treg-cell intrinsic molecule throughout development using this approach precludes the investigation into how each molecule impacts host defence against infection. cell intrinsic molecules to reconstitute Foxp3+ cell ablated mice overcome this technical barrier for interrogating the importance of each Treg-cell intrinsic molecule in host defence against acute infection. establishing the Treg-cell intrinsic molecules that compromise or augment host defence represent pivotally important next steps in this exciting area with enormous translational implications. id fever caused by persistent Salmonella infection in Nramp1-resistant mice. Treg-cell ablation in Foxp3DTR mice accelerates the activation of effector T cells with significant reductions in recoverable bacteria. expression of the transcription factors signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-3, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-4, B cell lymphoma protein (BCL)-6 and GATA-3 have each been shown to suppress other specialized effector CD4+ T-cell subsets that would otherwise cause unchecked self-reactive inflammation. the specialization and dynamic regulation among these various Treg-cell subsets also play important roles in coordination and fine-tuning immune responses after Foxp3+ Treg cells in the spleen progressively lose CTLA-4 expression. this is replaced by increased glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor expression. establishing the role of individual Treg-cell intrinsic molecules in dictating the progression of persistent infection. microbe-specific Foxp3+ Treg cells with specificity to defined species of enteric commensal bacteria are found in intestinal tissues. these cells selectively avert intestinal inflammation in colonized mice. in this regard, interrogating the differentiation stability for pathogen-specific Treg cells. agonists and inflammatory cytokines have been reported to override Treg-cell suppression through IL-6-independent pathways. cell-intrinsic stimulation through defined TLRs can also trigger shifts in Treg-cell suppression. microbial ligands can also increase Treg-suppressive potency. increased suppressive potency is associated with increased parasite burdens for patients with severe malaria infection. however, no significant changes in suppressive potency were found for Foxp3+ Treg cells isolated directly ex vivo after Plasmodium berghei infection in mice. overriding immune suppression by Treg cells probably plays pivotally important role in stimulating protective T-cell responses in vivo. however, overriding active suppression by Treg cells probably represents a more fundamental prerequisite \u2018signal zero\u2019 essential for stimulating effector T-cell activation in vivo. heterogeneity and functional specialization for Foxp3+ Treg cells in host defence have been uncovered. in addition, paralleled differentiation along effector CD4+ T-cell lineages and use of individual cell intrinsic molecules to mediate context-specific immune suppression have been established."}
