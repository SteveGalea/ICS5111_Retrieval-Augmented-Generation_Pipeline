{"summary": "the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of cloth masks to medical masks in hospital healthcare workers. participants 1607 hospital HCWs aged 18 years working full-time in selected high-risk wards. disposable medical masks and respirators have long since replaced the use of cloth masks in hospitals. despite widespread use, cloth masks are rarely mentioned in policy documents, and most available studies are observational or in vitro. trial of medical and cloth mask use for HCWs was conducted in 14 hospitals in hanoi, Vietnam. participants were followed during the same calendar time for 4 weeks of facemasks use and then one additional week for appearance of symptoms. one hospital did not meet the eligibility criteria; therefore, 74 wards in 15 hospitals were randomised. clinical end points could not be blinded as facemask use is a visible intervention. clinical end points could not be blinded. clinical end points included compliance with mask use. intervention Participants wore the mask on every shift for four consecutive weeks. participants in the medical mask arm were supplied with two masks daily for each 8 h shift. participants in the cloth mask arm were provided with five masks in total for the study duration. Viral RNA was extracted from each respiratory specimen using the Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. only extracted samples with the house-keeping gene detected by real-time RT-PCR were submitted for multiplex RT-PCR for viruses. positive controls were prepared by in vitro transcription to control amplification efficacy and monitor for false negatives. the equipment used was a TSI 8110 Filter tester. to test the filtration performance, the filter is challenged by a known concentration of sodium chloride particles of a specified size range and at a defined flow rate. we fitted a multivariable log-binomial model, using GEE to account for clustering by ward, to estimate RR after adjusting for potential confounders. the initial model included all the variables that had p value less than 0.25 in the univariable analysis, along with the main exposure variable (randomisation arm) a backward elimination method was used to remove the variables that did not have any confounding effect. randomisation Seventy-four wards were selected as high-risk settings for occupational exposure to respiratory infections. cluster randomisation was used because the outcome of interest was respiratory infectious diseases. 74 wards were randomly allocated to the interventions. confirmation was by nucleic acid detection using multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for 17 respiratory viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), influenza A (H3N2), (H1N1)pdm09, influenza B, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, influenza C, rhinoviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), cor mask wearing was measured and documented for all participants, including the control arm. participants were followed up daily for 4 weeks (active intervention period) and for an extra week of standard practice, in order to document incident infection after incubation. the reverse transcription and PCRs were performed in oneStep (Qiagen, Germany) to amplify viral target genes. then in five multiplex RT-PCRs: RSVA/B, influenza A/H3N2, A(H1N1) and B viruses, hMPV (reaction mix 1); parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134 (reaction mix 2); rhinoviruses, influenza C virus, SARS-CoV (reaction mix 3); corona we would need eight clusters per arm and 530 participants in each arm. we calculated p values from cluster-adjusted 2 tests25 and ICC. controls who used both types of mask (n=245) or used N95 respirators (n=3) or did not use any masks (n=2) were excluded. we fitted a multivariable log-binomial model, to estimate RR after adjusting for potential confounders. 'Hand wash' variable was created by taking average of the number of hand washings performed by. 'Hand wash' variable was created by taking average of the number of hand washings. 'number of patients had contact with' variable was created by taking average of the number of patients in contact with a HCW over the trial period. the rate of CRI was highest in the cloth mask arm, followed by the control arm, and lowest in the medical mask arm. p Value from cluster adjusted 2 tests is 0.510 and intracluster correlation coefficients is 0.065. 58 (85%) were due to rhinoviruses. no influenza A or RSV infections were detected. d viral infection (RR=0.66, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97) d viral infection (RR=0.66, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97) d viral infection (RR=0.66, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97) d viral infection (RR=0.66) univariate analysis, all outcomes were significantly higher in the cloth mask group compared with the medical masks group. ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) remained significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. controls who exclusively wore a medical mask were categorised and analysed with the medical mask arm participants. CRI, clinical respiratory illness; HCWs, healthcare workers; ILI, influenza-like illness; RR, relative risk. the most common approach to washing cloth masks was self-washing (456/569, 80%), followed by combined self-washing and hospital laundry (91/569, 16%). general discomfort (35.1%, 397/1130) and breathing problems (18.3%, 207/1130) were the most frequently reported adverse events. it is also unknown whether the rates of infection observed in the cloth mask arm are the same or higher than in HCWs who do not wear a mask. the physical properties of a cloth mask, reuse, the frequency and effectiveness of cleaning, and increased moisture retention, may potentially increase the infection risk. circulating influenza and RSV were almost completely absent during this study. the measured efficacy is against a different range of circulating respiratory pathogens. the study suggests medical masks may be protective, but the magnitude of difference raises the possibility that cloth masks cause an increase in infection risk. a limitation of this study is that we did not measure compliance with hand hygiene. the results reflect self-reported compliance, which may be subject to recall or other types of bias. the lack of a no-mask control group and high use of masks in the controls makes interpretation of the results more difficult. data from this study show potential clinical efficacy of medical masks. medical masks are used to protect against droplet spread, splash and spray of blood and body fluids. shortages of PPE may result in HCWs being forced to use cloth masks."}
