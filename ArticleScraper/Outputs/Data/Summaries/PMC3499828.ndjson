{"summary": "the most studied mechanism is the accumulation of point mutations on immunodominant regions of surface proteins. other known escape mechanisms include glycosylation of functionally pivotal residues (the glycan shield) or their association with host serum components (e.g., lipoproteins) to mask them from the immune system. interfering Abs are able to bind viral proteins at the level of immunodominant but functionally irrelevant regions of viral proteins. a candidate antiviral monoclonal antibody should not be subjected to this mechanism of interference. novel vaccinal approaches should avoid the elicitation of interfering Abs that could even worsen the disease in case of a real infection. nonneutralizing/interfering Abs are depicted in black while nAbs in yellow. binding of nonneutralizing/interfering Abs may induce conformational changes on the viral protein, thus affecting nAb binding to the antigen. seven major genotypes, varying by up to 30% in nucleotide sequence, and several subtypes are recognized. the development and use of anti-HCV mAbs capable of targeting structurally and functionally conserved regions of the highly variable viral particles are being considered as novel therapeutic tools. a sustained Ab response to envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 correlates with reduced viremia. in vitro use of anti-HCV polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations in both chimpanzees and humans has been disappointing. a recent paper has suggested that the effect of some of these nAbs could be hindered by the presence of non-nAbs binding residues within epitope II on HCV/E2 (aminoacid residues 434\u2013446). epitope II-directed Abs are masked and can no longer be recognized by specific nAbs. a low prevalence (less than 2.5%) and a low titer of epitope I-reactive Abs in sera from chronic and acute resolved infections. this suggests that a conformational masking by adjacent regions may induce conformational changes on E2 that inhibit the binding by epitope I-directed Abs. a recent study by Tarr et al. using murine (AP33) and rat (2/69a) mAbs, as well as human immunoglobulin fractions affinity-purified on linear peptides representing distinct HCV/E2 domains. the authors failed to demonstrate any inhibition between these two groups of Abs. e509 does not interfere with the activity of two other broadly cross-neutralizing human anti-HCV/E2 mAbs, named e20 and e137 [49,69]. Interestingly, both e20 and e137 bind also residues within epitope II, thus displacing it from the interfering epitope and keeping unaltered their neutralizing activity. influenza viruses circulate worldwide in animal reservoirs, especially water fowl, potentially affecting humans of any age group. influenza viruses are classified into types A, B or C based on antigenic differences of their nucleoprotein and matrix protein. HA is synthesized as inactive precursor that transits into its active form upon cleavage by host cell proteases. HA trimers bind to 2,6-linked sialic acid molecules on cell membrane proteins or lipids through domains located in the globular head of each monomer. occlusion of the receptor-binding site on HA by Abs is the main mechanism of influenza viral neutralization. the authors concluded that an exaggerated non-nAb response during the early stage of infection was associated with severe disease. the authors speculated that non-nAbs present in patients\u2019 sera during the early stage of infection were likely to be either preexisting or the result of a secondary heterosubtypic humoral immune response. a steric competition for binding to HA by Abs with different neutralization efficiency could increase the overall viral neutralization. if there is a steric competition for binding to HA by Abs with different neutralization efficiency, then a mutation that reduces the binding of Abs with low neutralizing activity could increase the overall viral neutralization. however, it has been shown that Abs that bind to a certain HA epitope can prevent further binding of Abs to other epitopes of the same HA protein steric hindrance by Abs that bind epitopes could greatly reduce the extent of mutation required for a virus to evade neutralization by host Abs. a decrease in affinity of Abs for epitopes with low-neutralization efficiency epitopes could lead to an increase in viral neutralization. more than 8,000 cases, including almost 800 deaths, were reported during the outbreak period. since 2003 only sporadic cases have been reported; however, the possibility that SARS outbreaks could reemerge naturally or be deliberately released is a public health concern. SARS-S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein of approximately 1,255 amino acids in length. it is divided into two functional domains: S1 (aminoacid residues 15\u2013680) and S2 (aminoacid residues 681\u20131,255) in many coVs, the S protein is cleaved during biogenesis and these two functional domains are held together non-covalently. the authors proposed a possible explanation to what observed. the epitope of the non-neutralizing mAb 240C partially overlaps by at least 2 aminoacids with that of the neutralizing mAb 341C. mAb 240C mAb could sterically interfere with the binding of the 540C mAb. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a positive single-stranded RNA retrovirus. the virus is a positive single-stranded RNA retrovirus, causing substantial morbidity and mortality across the globe. gp120 undergoes conformational change, resulting in exposure of epitopes bound by co-receptor molecules. in the pre-hairpin intermediate, the gp41 molecules reorganize so that the N-terminal peptides form a trimer of helices that expose the fusion peptide to the target cell. the C-terminal helices remain anchored to the viral membrane. a vaccine is widely viewed as crucial for the control of the epidemic. but several advanced efforts to develop an effective prophylaxis resulted unsuccessful. a candidate passive immunotherapy could consist, as previously suggested for SARS-CoV infection, in the administration of a cocktail of broadly neutralizing mAbs. mAbs 2F5 or 50\u201369 were combined with the non-neutralizing anti-gp41 mAb 98\u20136 [137]. mAbs 50\u201369 and 98\u20136 recognize distinct epitopes on gp41. mAb 2F5 recognize a different epitope from mAb 98\u20136, within the gp41 membrane-proximal external region. p120 and anti-gp41 Abs are induced in HIV-1-infected individuals. they are predominantly non-neutralizing, since the functionally important regions of HIV surface proteins are almost completely hidden to the immune system. the effect of the extremely rare anti-gp41 and anti-gp120 nAbs may be hindered by the overwhelming amount of interfering non-nAbs."}
