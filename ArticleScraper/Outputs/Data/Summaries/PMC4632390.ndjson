{"summary": "viruses do not constitute a monophyletic group, in which the phylogenetic history can be traced back to a common ancestor. it is unclear whether viruses have evolved by reduction of genes from cellular species or whether they precede cellular life. a certain clade of giant viruses may represent a fourth domain of life. a comparison of capsid proteins allowed for proposing a novel classification of viruses into so-called lineages. a lineage unites several viral families, whose capsid proteins have similar folds, but otherwise, their proteins can share little or no sequence similarity. virions are suggested to be called \u201ccapsid-encoded organisms\u201d [12]. a subset of DNA viruses has been shown to be related to polintons, a class of eukaryotic transposons and mitochondrial plasmids. this approach does not provide a unified picture of viral evolution due to the lack of structural data and of our ability to compare structures sharing little similarity. it is recognized to play a major role in the evolution of bacterial virulence and resistance [17,18]. the major goal of the study was to detect the unlikely event of horizontal gene transfer between seemingly unrelated viruses. we have identified proteins from several protein families that appear in very distant viruses, with a conserved function. the sequence similarity in viral proteins quickly becomes undetectable with the increase of evolutionary distance. maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed with RAxML (Version 8.0.24) [29] using the PROTGAMMAJTT model and 100 replicates for the calculation of the bootstrap support. the trees were visualized with Dendroscope (Version 3.2.10) [30] for the calculation of the bootstrap support. structural similarities with a Z-score greater than two were considered significant. similar structures were superimposed and displayed with UCSF Chimera (Version 1.10.2) [39] dsDNA viruses Hema esterase 3I27 4 Influenza C virus (negative-strand ssRNA) \u2013 Coronaviridae (positive-strand ssRNA) MMTV SAg \u2013 2 Betaretrovirus (retro-transcribing ssRNA) \u2013 Velarivirus (positive-strand ssRNA) \u2013 MMTV SAg \u2013 2 Betaretrovirus (retro-transcribing ssRNA) \u2013 Rha the dUTPase family has the highest number of hits. we analyzed the conservation profile in all families and in the identified viral proteins. dUTPase family has the highest number of hits. dsDNA viruses are colored red, ssDNA viruses green, positive-strand RNA viruses blue, ssRNA viruses cyan, proteins from cellular organisms in black and internal branches that do not lead to proteins from monophyletic clades in gray. functional motifs and catalytic sites are presented in sequence logos and protein 3D structure, where appropriate (discussed in the text) 62% of sequences identified as members of the parvo NS1 family in our analysis are E1 proteins from Papillomaviridae. three and six proteins come from Betaherpesvirinae and Adenoviridae respectively. each of these groups is located on a separate branch with a high bootstrap support. dUTPases are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP to prevent the incorporation of dUTP into DNA. dUTPases catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP to prevent the incorporation of dUTP into DNA. the viral protein and the dUTPase from its host is 72% identical to the human dUTPase and has a GC content that is closer to that of human than the virus itself. the bifunctional nucleocapsid-dUTPase protein from pfizer monkey Betaretrovirus (MPMV) and protease from simian retrovirus exhibit significant sequence similarity to this family. the MPMV protein has been proven to be an the phage integrase from the single-strand DNA Pseudomonas phage Pf1 is the only representative from ssDNA viruses in this family. the key catalytic residues characteristic of phage integrases [49] are conserved in this protein (marked with arrows in Figure 2C) it is plausible that the introduction of this protein into Pseudomonas phage Pf1 is due to the extensive HGT that takes enterobacteria phage If1 is 99% identical to the Escherichia coli transposase. its GC content is more similar to that of E. coli than to that of the phage itself. MMTV SAg family is a small protein family consisting of the mouse mammary tumor virus superantigen. the similarity of coat proteins is borderline and does not allow for definitive conclusions. we have identified 28 additional families that have their representatives in viruses from different Baltimore classes. RMSD is a poor measure for comparing structural similarity across different protein folds. small protein segments tend to be aligned with smaller RMSD than large and complex structures. TM-score is devoid of these weaknesses and was normalized by the alignment length. clusters of similar viral structures with the respective PDB identification codes are reported. for each dataset, clusters of similar viral structures are reported. for each dataset, clusters of similar viral structures with the respective PDB identification codes are reported. unclassified virophage (Sputnik) 1M3YA, 3J26A Envelope Group 1 4HJ1A, 3J0CA, 4ADIA. large-populated folds In the non-redundant set of. the first group comprises protein chains of 50 known structures with an average TM-score of 0.61. all of them share the presence of the jelly-roll capsids. there are no structural homologs of the jelly-roll capsids among the proteins from cellular organisms. hepatitis C virus JFH-1, positive-strand ssRNA (green), influenza A virus, strain A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/060/2010 (H17N10) helicase domains of DNA replication protein from adeno-associated virus 2, ssDNA (orange), replication protein E1 from bovine papillomavirus type 1, dsDNA (green), large T antigen of simian virus 40, d the virophage is from the same Baltimore class, dsDNA, as its host, Mimivirus, and excessive HGT from the host has been reported in this case [24]. the fold in these structures has been dubbed double jelly roll, and it is also a frequent motif in viral capsid proteins. the 43 envelope proteins also comprise two structural groups (Table 2). no structural homologs of RdRPs have been found among the proteins from cellular organisms. dsRNA and positive-strand ssRNA viruses have previously been reported to be related. this agrees with earlier hypothesis that negative-strand ssRNA RdRPs evolved from positive-strand ssRNA viruses. structurally-similar superfamily 1 helicases (S1H) containing proteins from viruses with dsDNA genome (Enterobacteria phage T4) and two structures of HCV NS3 protease/helicase proteins belonging to positive-strand ssRNA viruses (hepatitis C virus subtype 1b and Dengue virus 4) helicases of superfamily 3 have significant similarity to several human proteins, in particular the human AAA+ ATPase Tip ubiquitin-specific protease of murine herpesvirus 1 shows similarity with papain-like fold belonging to viruses with positive-strand ssRNA. ubiquitin-specific protease of murine herpesvirus 1 has a dsDNA genome. homologs of protease of the foot and mouth disease virus can be found only within the genus of Aphthovirus. each viral protease is more similar to proteases from vertebrates than to other viral proteases. the absence of a reliable evolutionary model precludes us from suggesting a definitive evolutionary scenario. further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the origin and evolution of proteases. from 12 methyltransferases, we detect structural similarity between mRNA cap methyltransferases of viruses with dsDNA genome (Vaccinia virus) and positive-strand ssRNA genome (SARS coronavirus and wesselsbron virus) a cellular homolog of the methyltransferase from SARS coronavirus can be found in several other poxviruses. strand ssRNA viruses (Asian influenza, a subtype of influenza A, influenza B virus strain B/Memphis/13/03, influenza C virus strain C/Johannesburg/1/66) and to betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family with positive-strand ssRNA genome. similarity between hemagglutinin esterases of betacoronavirus and influenza C virus is detectable already on the sequence level, but does not allow for re a common ancestor of Coronaviridae and subsequent loss in all other genera is unlikely. potential route of horizontal gene transfer of hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) from Orthomyxoviridae to Coronaviridae is reported as TM-score. one hit pair did not show significant similarity to any of the Pfam family. the dUTPase family has the highest number of hits. we analyzed the conservation profile in all families and in the identified family. the analysis of these trees reveals two distinct patterns of the distribution of viral sequences. either sequences from viruses from two Baltimore classes are present in comparable and large numbers. we will consider each of these scenarios in detail and discuss the possible evolutionary implications. dsDNA viruses are colored red, ssDNA viruses green, positive-strand RNA viruses blue, ssRNA viruses cyan, proteins from cellular organisms in black and internal branches. functional motifs and catalytic sites are presented in sequence logos and protein 3D structure, where appropriate. RNA helicases of superfamily 3 (S3H) are established hallmark viral proteins and were proposed to be present already in the ancient virus world. ae, 62% of sequences identified as members of the parvo NS1 family are E1 proteins from Papillomaviridae. three and six proteins come from Betaherpesvirinae and Adenoviridae. each of these groups is located on a separate branch with a high bootstrap support. dUTPases are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP to prevent the incorporation of dUTP into DNA. dUTPases are also present in a large number of dsDNA viruses from Herpesvirales, Poxviridae and various bacteriophages. dUTPase is a bifunctional nucleocapsid-dUTPase protein from simian retrovirus. it has been proven to be an active dUTPase. dUTPases are distinct from other viral dUTPases with a high bootstrap support. single-strand DNA Pseudomonas phage Pf1 is the only representative from ssDNA viruses in this family. key catalytic residues characteristic of phage integrases are conserved in this protein (marked with arrows in Figure 2C) it is plausible that the introduction of this protein into Pseudomonas phage Pf1 is due to extensive HGT that takes place in bacteria. MMTV SAg family is a small protein family consisting of the mouse mammary tumor virus superantigen, several endogenous copies in the mouse genome and, surprisingly, two proteins from the Herpesrvirus genus. superantigens of the MMTV SAg family cause nonspecific activation of T-cells. the similarity of coat proteins is borderline and does not allow for definitive conclusions. we have identified 28 additional families that have their representatives in viruses from different Baltimore classes. dsDNA viruses are colored red, ssDNA viruses green, positive-strand RNA viruses blue, ssRNA viruses cyan, proteins from cellular organisms in black and internal branches. RNA-directed RNA polymerases (RdRP) and RNA helicases of superfamily 3 (S3H) are established hallmark viral proteins. 62% of sequences identified as members of the parvo NS1 family in our analysis are E1 proteins from Papillomaviridae. three and six proteins come from Betaherpesvirinae and Adenoviridae respectively. each of these groups is located on a separate branch with a high bootstrap support. dUTPases are ubiquitous in cellular organisms and catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP to prevent the incorporation of dUTP into DNA. dUTPases are also present in a large number of dsDNA viruses from Herpesvirales, Poxviridae and various bacteriophages. dUTPase is 72% identical to the human dUTPase and has a GC content that is closer to that of human than of the virus itself. the bifunctional nucleocapsid-dUTPase protein from. Betaretrovirus (MPMV) and protease from simian retrovirus exhibit significant sequence similarity. the MPMV protein has been proven to be an active dUTPase. the phage integrase from the single-strand DNA Pseudomonas phage Pf1 is the only representative from ssDNA viruses in this family. the key catalytic residues characteristic of phage integrases [49] are conserved in this protein (marked with arrows in Figure 2C) it is plausible that the introduction of this protein into Pseudomonas phage Pf1 is due to the extensive HGT that takes the MMTV SAg family is a small protein family consisting of the mouse mammary tumor virus superantigen and several endogenous copies in the mouse genome. superantigens of the MMTV SAg family cause nonspecific activation of T-cells. the similarity of coat proteins is borderline and does not allow for definitive conclusions. we have identified 28 additional families that have their representatives in viruses from different Baltimore classes. we have performed a more sensitive search among all viral proteins with HMMer [28] using all Pfam HMMs. TM-scores greater than 0.5 almost always correspond to the alignment of structures with a similar fold. phylogenetic reconstruction is hardly applicable in the absence of detectable sequence similarity. we have analyzed 696 three-dimensional structures from the following functional classes. we refrain from calling them \u201cfamilies\u201d and refer to these two groups as widely populated and confined folds. for each dataset, clusters of similar viral structures with the respective PDB identification codes are reported. for each dataset, clusters of similar viral structures with the respective PDB identification codes are reported. dsDNA, unclassified virophage (Sputnik) 1M3YA, 3J26A Envelope Group 1 4HJ1A, 3J0CA, 4ADIA, Envelope glycoproteins positive-strand ssRNA, 3J27A, 2GG1A negative-strand ssRNA Poly- 4GZKA, 4A8OA, 2R7RA. first group comprises protein chains of 50 known structures with an average TM-score of 0.61. all of them share the presence of the jelly-roll fold. there are no structural homologs of the jelly-roll capsids among the proteins from cellular organisms. the unclassified virophage is from the same Baltimore class, dsDNA. the virophage is from the same Baltimore class, dsDNA, as the virophage Sputnik. the fold in these structures has been dubbed double jelly roll. it is also a frequent motif in viral capsid proteins. the 43 envelope proteins also comprise two structural groups. e phi6, simian rotavirus, mammalian orthoreovirus 3 Dearing, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, positive-strand ssRNA viruses. hepatitis C virus JFH-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus 1, japanese encephalitis virus, foot and mouth disease virus C-S8c1, murine norovirus 1, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus. no structural homologs of RdRPs have superfamily 1 helicases (S1H) containing proteins from viruses with dsDNA genome (Enterobacteria phage T4) and two structures of HCV NS3 protease/helicase proteins belonging to positive-strand ssRNA viruses (hepatitis C virus subtype 1b and Dengue virus 4) helicases of superfamily 3 have significant similarity to several human proteins, in particular the human AAA+ ATPase Tip49b (D superfamily 1 and 2 helicases are also known to be conserved in cellular organisms, including bacteria and humans. ubiquitin-specific protease of murine herpesvirus 1 has a papain-like fold belonging to viruses with positive-strand ssRNA and dsDNA viruses. despite the lack of sequence similarity, these proteins share the same papain-like fold. the absence of a reliable evolutionary model precludes us from suggesting a definitive evolutionary scenario. further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the origin and evolution of proteases with a papain-like fold in viruses. mRNA cap methyltransferases of viruses with dsDNA genome (Vaccinia virus) and positive-strand ssRNA genome (SARS coronavirus and wesselsbron virus) the superposition of these three structures reveals significant structural similarity, especially between the methyltransferases of the SARS coronavirus and the of Vaccinia virus that have different genomes. a cellular homolog of the methyltransferase from Vaccinia similarity between hemagglutinin esterases of betacoronavirus and influenza C virus is detectable already on the sequence level. similarity between hemagglutinin esterases of betacoronavirus and betacoronavirus has been reported to be a result of lateral gene transfer events. hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) from orthomyxoviridae to Coronaviridae. the first group comprises protein chains of 50 known structures. the first group comprises proteins from positive-strand ssRNA, ssDNA, dsDNA and dsRNA viruses. helicase domains of ATP-dependent DNA helicase uvsW from Enterobacteria phage T4, dsDNA (cyan), replicase large subunit from tobacco mosaic virus strain tomato/L, positive-strand ssRNA (dark red), positive-strand ssRNA (green), ATP-dependent DNA helicase dda from Enterobacteria phage T4, dsDNA, (light red), replicase polyprotein 1a reted icosahedral virus 1, Pseudoalteromonas phage PM2 and Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1) and the structure of the capsid protein V20, belonging to the unclassified virophage Sputnik [60]. the fold in these structures has been dubbed double jelly roll, and it is also a frequent motif in viral capsid proteins. the analogy of the fusion mechanism between the viral and eukaryotic proteins has been suggested [66]. the second structural group among envelope proteins represents an example of HGT and will be discussed in the subsequent section. superfamily 3 helicase family is one of the viral hallmark protein families. similarity between these helicases in viruses with different genome types can be detected already at the sequence level. helicases with different genome types can be readily superposed using their C-terminal RecA-like domain. ubiquitin-specific protease of murine herpesvirus 1 has a dsDNA genome. homologs of the protease of the SARS coronavirus can be found in a variety of beta- and gamma-coronaviruses. structural homologs in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms suggest gene transfer events. the absence of a reliable evolutionary model precludes us from suggesting a definitive evolutionary scenario. further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the origin and evolution of proteases with a papain-like fold. strains C/Johannesburg/1/66, negative-strand ssRNA, influenza B virus, strain B/Memphis/13/2003, negative-strand ssRNA, (light green), bovine coronavirus, positive-strand ssRNA (light magenta) from 12 methyltransferases, we detect structural similarity between mRNA cap methyltransferases of viruses with dsDNA genome (Vaccinia virus) and positive-strand s structural similarities were previously reported between hemagglutinins of influenza A, B and C in the HA2/HEF2 chain. similarity between hemagglutinin esterases of coronaviruses and orthomixoviruses has not been analyzed. hemagglutinin esterases of betacoronavirus and Torovirus are more similar to each other than to the respective spike glycoproteins. introduction into a common ancestor of Coronaviridae and subsequent loss in all other genera is unlikely. the number of resolved three-dimensional structures of viral proteins lags far behind the number of available sequences of them. a sequence comparison identifies all known members of each protein family, while structural comparison provides information on distant homologies. vo NS1 ssDNA (34) Families with unbalanced sequence distribution / confined folds positive-strand ssRNA (1) negative-strand ssRNA (3) Group 2 negative-strand ssRNA (3) Functionally, a unifying theme is that almost all of the proteins are related to nucleic acid processing or modification. comparison on the structural level adds viral structural proteins (capsid, envelope) and some protein- and RNA-modifying enzymes (proteases we use terms \u201cwidely represented folds\u201d and \u201cconfined fold\u201d for the two patterns mentioned above. for families with unbalanced sequence distributions, all other families with widely represented folds correspond to viral hallmark genes. we can propose a scenario involving horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in most cases. MMTV superantigen family proteins are specific to very particular viruses. the proteins exhibit significant sequence similarity and conserved structure and function and, therefore, share the same evolutionary origin. further investigations will be needed in order to elucidate the origin and evolution of these two classes of viral proteins. the simplest, but practical measure is the GC content of the corresponding nucleotide segment. phylogeny-based methods for HGT detection are inapplicable. the only case, when the GC content analysis reliably supports HGT, involves DNA phages (or dsDNA poxviruses) much more complex picture of viral evolution than previously expected."}
