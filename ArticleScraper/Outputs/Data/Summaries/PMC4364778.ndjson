{"summary": "Isatis tinctoria L. (woad), the biennial herb of Brassicaceae family, is a popular medicinal crop widely cultured in Europe and Asian countries. its roots (Radix isatidis) known as Ban-Lan-Gen has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years for the clinical treatment of pestilence, epidemic hepatitis and infections [2], especially for influenza such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 [ cell suspension cultures are best exemplified by Agrobacterium rhizogenes-based hairy root cultures (HRCs) they possess comparable biosynthetic capacity of secondary metabolites to native plant roots with advantages of fast growth rates independent of phytohormones. rhizogenes-mediated hairy root system in I. tinctoria could produce valuable FL. ITHRCs may offer a promising and continuous product platform for naturally-derived, high quality and valuable nutraceuticals. a. rhizogenes strain LBA9402 was grown overnight in the dark at 28 1\u00b0C. the explants were immersed into the overnight grown bacterial suspension of A. rhizogenes strain LBA9402 (OD600 nm = 0.6\u20130.8) after 2 days of co-cultivation, the explants were transferred to hormone-free MS/2-based solid medium containing sodium cefotaxim (300 mg/L) the root initials were isolated from the explants and sub-cultured on fresh hormone free MS/2-based solid medium at 25 1\u00b0C in genemic DNA isolated from I. tinctoria aseptic plantlets and Ri-plasmid (pRi) DNA from A. rhizogenes strain LBA9402 were used as negative and positive controls. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2.5% (w/v) agarose-ethidium bromide gel along with 1000 bp DNA marker. i j X i X j, jj and ij are regression coefficients for intercept, linearity, square and interaction respectively. X i and X j are independent coded variables; k represents the number of variables. extraction of FL was repeated for 3 cycles. DPPH radical-scavenging assay and -carotene bleaching inhibition percentages (mg/mL) compared to concentrations of samples (mg/mL) seeds were surface sterilized with 70% (v/v) ethanol for 45 s and 4% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 8 min, then rinsed 5 times with sterilized water. the petioles of 3-week-old seedling were used as explants for hairy root induction. bacterial suspension of A. rhizogenes strain LBA9402 (OD600 nm = 0.6\u20130.8) for 6 min, dry-blotted on sterile filter paper. explants were transferred to hormone-free MS/2-based solid medium containing sodium cefotaxim (300 mg/L) to eliminate the residual bacteria. products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2.5% (w/v) agarose-ethidium bromide gel along with 1000 bp DNA marker. a certain amount of hairy roots was transferred into 250 mL flasks containing 150 mL of MS/2 liquid medium and incubated on a rotary shaker at an appropriate temperature in the dark. the experiment data were analyzed statistically with Design-Expert 7.0 (State-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis MN) analysis of variance was performed to calculate and simulate the optimal values of the tested parameters. extraction of FL The powders (0.5 g DW) of hairy roots and 2 year-old field grown roots were extracted with 80% ethanol solution (20 mL) in an ultrasonic bath for 120 min. column temperature was maintained at 30\u00b0C, the flow rate 1.0 mL/min and the injection volume 10 L. mass spectra of analyses were performed in the selected reaction monitoring transitions with an electrospray ionization source operating in the negative ion mode. the content of each target compound was determined by the pervious method reported by Wu et al. [15] the optimal transformation rate was obtained when 3 week-old petiole explants were co-cultured for 2 days with the supplementation of 125 M acetosyringone and 1.5 mM arginine. the independently transformed hairy roots were excised and sub-cultured on MS/2 solid medium with antibiotics to eliminate bacteria. thRL I\u2013VIII with vigorously growing phenotype were evaluated by comparing their performance of biomass production and FL accumulation. however, ITHRL V exhibited the most intensive ability of FL biosynthesis among them. the cultivation of ITHRL V on MS/2 solid medium and its prolific growth in MS/2 liquid medium are shown in Fig. 1C, D. rolB (670 bp), rolC (534 bp), aux1 (350 bp) and virD (438 bp) genes in hairy roots. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2.5% (w/v) agarose-ethidium bromide gel along with 1000 bp DNA marker. optimization of culture conditions Once the high-productive hairy root line was established, the optimization of culture conditions can further improve the product yield the experimental design matrix and the relevant data are illustrated in S2 Table. Effect of different culture media on (A) biomass production and (D) FL accumulation of ITHRCs after 3 weeks of cultivation.
