{"summary": "mRNA translation can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation and termination. the control of mRNA translation plays a central role in most stress responses. initiation is regarded as the rate-limiting step. the regulation of eIF2 phosphorylation has been implicated in biological processes as diverse as synaptic plasticity, inflammation and metabolic diseases. most of the available biochemical and genomic data about eIF2 biology were obtained during the study of the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) only correctly folded proteins are exported to the Golgi apparatus. ER stress can be induced by stressors, such as ROS, leading to IRE1-dependent XBP1 mRNA splicing and translation. ER stress can be induced by stressors, such as ROS. BP1 nuclear translocation drives the transcriptional activation of multiple genes involved in ER and molecular chaperones homeostasy. other UPR transcription factors, such as ATF4, and CHOP, are induced upon eIF2 phosphorylation by PERK. this stress response is embedded within the larger innate defense gene expression signature driven by microbe recognition. we propose that this stress response should be considered as microbe specific and not just a reflection of accentuated ER stress. no upregulation of Bip, Ero1, ERdj4 and p58IPK. CHOP induction is limited both transcriptionaly and translationaly. each kinase is associated with the response to different kinds of stress. HRI is activated under conditions of low haem, as well as by oxidative, osmotic or heat shock. PERK is mostly activated in response to ER stress, through quenching of the ER-resident HSP70 chaperone BiP. regulatory subunits of PP1 promote eIF2 dephosphorylation and counteract eIF2 kinases activity. under normal conditions, translation can now initiate at the AUG of downstream coding regions. viral infection or accumulation of misfolded proteins can result in a sustained eIF2 phosphorylation by PKR, GCN2 or PERK. GADD34 transcription is also known to involve other transcription factors, such as the pro-apoptotic CHOP, ATF3 and potentially ATF6, whose proteolytic activation contributes to the UPR. eIF2 phosphorylation and its inhibitory impact on translation initiation are essential to promote ATF4 synthesis. most of our current knowledge on ATF4 and GADD34 was obtained by investigating their role during artificial induction of the UPR. eIF2 and viral detection also induce eIF2 phosphorylation via PKR to inhibit cellular protein synthesis and viral replication. initial analysis revealed that the PKR/ mice are healthy and presented normal antiviral responses after intravascular inoculation of EMCV or Vaccinia virus. differences in genetic backgrounds that may compensate for the PKR deficiency were later observed. PKR-deficient mice in the 129terSv BALB/c background died due to intranasal infection with VSV. GCN2 and PERK eIF2-kinases can thus phosphorylate eIF2 upon viral detection. these three eIF2 kinases contribute to a powerful antiviral pathway. many viruses have evolved strategies to ensure completion of their infection cycle and efficient spreading. eIF2 phosphorylation-mediated GADD34 induction in infected cells would be counter productive for the host. eIF2 phosphorylation-mediated GADD34 induction in infected cells would be counter productive for the host. bacterial LPS detection by TLR4 and exposure to inflammasome agonists induce PKR autophosphorylation and activation. PKR deficiency in these stimulated cells significantly inhibits the expression of cytokines, like type-I IFN (Diebold et al, 2003), and prevents the secretion of IL-1, IL-18 and HMGB1 (Lu et al, 2012) a striking distinctive feature of this pathway is the translational inhibition of CHOP synthesis, together with enhanced level of eIF2 de-phosphorylation, GADD34 and expression. XBP1 is likely to favour the expression of cytokines through the targeting of yet undefined partners at the translational, signal transduction and transcriptional level. phosphorylation of eIF2 by its cognate kinase induces translation inhibition while favouring ATF4 synthesis and subsequent GADD34 expression. cytosolic poly I:C induces a near to complete and irreversible protein synthesis extinction within 8 h of cytosolic delivery, despite a rapid and concomitant induction of GADD34 and eIF2 dephosphorylation. eIF2 phosphorylation and GADD34 expression represent common consequences of PERK and PKR activation, but their impact on the cell physiology are absolutely not equivalent. the functional importance of GADD34 induction in response to dsRNA remained unclear until it was demonstrated that GADD34-deficient cells were unable to produce type-I IFN and IL-6 proteins in response to poly I:C. the role of GADD34 for cytokines production makes this molecule a novel actor in the antiviral arsenal. this role is particularly obvious in neonates mice that are exquisitely sensitive to ChikV infection and die of myocarditis in the absence of functional GADD34. PKR activation in response to TLR triggering was found not to increase further the levels of phosphorylated eIF2 (P-eIF2). eIF2 dephosphorylation was shown to be mediated by GADD34 induction. this type of transcriptional response has been also observed in macrophages infected with L. monocytogenes. induced in DCs by west Nile virus infection suggests that GADD34 represents a key signature gene associated to the triggering of RLRs and of mitochondria-associated adapter molecule. it could depend on IRF5 translocation for its expression. expression of ATF4 and several of its downstream targets, including GADD34, normally requires increased eIF2 phosphorylation to allow their translation at the right initiation codon. IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7, a master regulator of type-I IFN gene expression, upregulates ATF4 activity and expression. ATF4 in return inhibits IRF7 activation. this suggests a cross-regulation between the IFN response and a participation of ATF4 in a negative-feedback loop of the IFN antiviral response. 34 inactivation was found to decrease cytokines expression. microbial stimulation alleviates the synthesis of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP. however, expression of CHOP is prolonged and cell death induced. experiments performed in human monocyte-derived DCs have demonstrated that CHOP participates in the enhanced production of IL-23 p19. this suggests that CHOP expression is not always inhibited by LPS sensing and associated with increased apoptosis. this extinction of CHOP synthesis is occurring at the translational level. induction of several mRNAs was suppressed during a chemically induced UPR. XBP1 synthesis did not promote the transcription of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 or TNF-. in the context of microbial activation, XBP1 clearly enhanced the transcription of these different cytokines. characterization of non-canonical roles of ATF4/GADD34 and IRE-1/XBP-1 suggests existence of a specific microbial stress response (MSR) distinct from the now \u2018classical\u2019 UPR. the MSR could allow individual cells to cope with the considerable and deleterious impact of microbe detection on their physiology. FN stimulation may have an additional purpose than mediating eIF2 dephosphorylation. a cross-talk between stress-inducible GADD34 and the mTOR-signalling pathway might exist. this complex has been proposed to be part of a negative-feedback loop. transduction cascades downstream of TLRs could be seen as parallel and complementary signalling modules. the MSR should be considered as a novel signal transduction and transcription module involved in the coordination of inflammatory cytokines induction (e.g., IFN-/IRFs and IL6/NFkB) and cellular antimicrobial pathways (e.g., PKR and eIF2) during the detection of microbial products and pathogens."}
