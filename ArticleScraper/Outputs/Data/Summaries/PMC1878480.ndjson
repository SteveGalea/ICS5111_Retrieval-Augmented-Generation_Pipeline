{"summary": "a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the first intron of the human IFN- gene can putatively influence the secretion of cytokine with an impact on infection outcome. IFNG+874T/A SNP could be involved in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis by influencing the amount of cytokine released by CL patients. american tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) is a vector born disease caused in Brazil mainly by leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, an intracellular pathogen. ML is not as common as CL, affecting approximately 5% of patients infected almost exclusively by L. braziliensis. a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the first intron of the human IFN- gene, at the 5' end adjacent to a CA repeat region can putatively influence the secretion of IFN- [11] this finding can explain why a high frequency of +874A carriers are low IFN- producers in different population [12-16]. 136 leishmaniasis patients were enrolled in this study. patients were referred from endemic areas of l. braziliensis infection in braziliensis. al blood mononuclear cell culture and IFN- measurement PBMC from a total of 60 patients (31 ML and 29 CL) was obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation. cells stimulated in vitro for 5-days with crude extract of L. braziliensis promastigote antigens (50 g/well), as described previously. a total of 609 healthy individuals (288 females and 321 males) were involved in the study. written informed consent was obtained from all individuals according to protocol approved by the Ethical Committee for Human Research of the Funda\u00e7o Oswaldo Cruz. the minimum IFN- levels detected were 62.5 pg/mL. the case-control study was analyzed using logistic regression model. results obtained from quantitative variables were analyzed by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer post-test. healthy controls 224 (0.37) 273 (0.45) 112 (0.18) 0.59 0.41 The analysis of IFN- production upon Leishmania antigens stimulation showed differences in the IFN- secretion between CL and ML were very significant (p 0.001) in ML patients, similar levels of IFN- were produced independently of the IFNG +874 genotype (p = 0.09) the detectable IFN- values were lower for +874AA individuals (844 1,099 pg/mL, median = 244 pg/mL, n = 10); moderate for +874TA (2,700 1,818 pg/mL, median = 2,556 pg/mL, n = 2). in 11 CL and 2 ML the IFN- values were under the minimum detectable levels. an association between reduced +874TT IFN- homozygous frequency and chronicity of the disease was also observed in ML patients [16]. on the other hand, this SNP seems to impact on in vitro production of IFN- in CL, where the T allele was associated with higher levels of this cytokine. IFNG +874 SNP could be involved in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis by influencing the amount of IFN- released by CL patients. the complex interactions which occur after parasite infection predict that the clinical course of the disease could not be explained by a unique mechanism. authors do not have a commercial or other association that might pose a conflict of interest Authors' contributions All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
