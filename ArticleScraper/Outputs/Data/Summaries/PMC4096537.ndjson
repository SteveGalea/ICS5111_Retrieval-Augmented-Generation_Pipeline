{"summary": "the functional state of glial cells, like astrocytes and microglia, critically modulates the course of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. recent studies provide evidence that in particular chemokines are important modulators of glial cell function. chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 are abundantly expressed at sites of glial activation. deficiency of CXCR3 reduced expression of microglial activation markers CD45 and CD11b. chemokine system is critically involved in the intrinsic glial activation during cuprizone-induced demyelination. glial cells are key participators during pathological changes within the diseased brain. chemokine receptor CXCR3 mediates distinct functions like integrin activation, cytoskeletal changes, suppression of angiogenesis or chemotactic migration. recent data argue for the functional existence of CXCR3 on microglia [23,41,42] and astrocytes [41,43] cuprizone was mixed into a powdered ground standard rodent chow. before cuprizone administration, all mice were adapted to powdered normal chow for one week. cuprizone diet was then maintained for five weeks following four additional days on normal chow. microglia cells were labeled using biotinylated tomato lectin. primary antibody treated sections were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Axxora; 1:200) before horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin was applied (Axxora; 1:200) samples were carefully disrupted and homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem Tissue Grinder (10 ml; Wheaton), a needle (0.6 25) and a syringe (5 ml) after centrifugation, homogenates were dissolved in 75% Percoll (GE-healthcare) microglia were collected from the 25%/75% interface. bound antibody was detected using a BD FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) data were analyzed using the flow cytometry software, FlowJo (TreeStar) microglia were gated using forward and side scatter characteristics and identified by labelling with CD11b+/CD45dim microglia populations. animals and administration of cuprizone was induced in 8-week-old wild type C57BL/6 (WT, Charles River) and CXCR3-deficient mice (CXCR3-/-; B6.129P2-Cxcr3tm1Dgen/J, Jackson Laboratory) fed with 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone. before cuprizone administration, all mice were adapted to powdered normal chow for one week. sections were rehydrated in graded ethanol series after deparaffination in xylene. sections were blocked with PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. antibodies specific for the proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP, Dako; 1:200) were incubated for one hour at room temperature. gated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen; 1:200) were used to visualize the primary antibody. sections were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium. Isolated cells were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to detect CD3e (PerCP-Cy5.5), CD11b (APC), CD11c (PE-Cy7), CD45 (FITC), CD45 (eFluor 450), Ly6G (PerCP-Cy5.5), B220 (APC-eFluor 780) and NK1.1 (PE-Cy7). qManTM Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) for Gapdh, Plp1, Mbp, Cnp, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Tnf, Il6, Ifng, Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl5 samples were analyzed simultaneously for Gapdh mRNA as the internal control. each sample was assayed in duplicate, normalized to the internal control and data was presented as copies of mRNA/Ga withdrawal of cuprizone after five weeks resulted in rapid body weight recovery in WT and CXCR3-/- mice. gain of body weight during withdrawal of cuprizone was significantly higher in mice deficient for CXCR3 compared to wild type (WT) mice. the body weights were monitored twice a week and plotted in comparison with values of control animals fed with powdered normal chow (gray symbols) the body weight recovery after offset of cuprizone feeding was found to be significantly improved in CXCR3-deficient mice after 5.5 weeks (n = 7 per group; ***P 0.001). sagittal brain sections of wild type (WT) and CXCR3-/- mice were analyzed for the localization of activated microglia at regions of the corpus callosum (Cc), thalamus (Th) and cerebellum (Cb) these observations were made within regions of the thalamus (Th) and cerebellum (Cb) we analyzed the CD68+ content in both genotypes and found significantly reduced particle perimeters in all studied central nervous system regions in CXCR3-/- compared to WT brains. we also found widespread lectin+ cells in the medulla in CXCR3-/- mice. in cuprizone-treated mice, tight clusters of activated Iba1+ microglia cells were visible. microglia in these clusters displayed large CD68+ lysosomes. in CXCR3-/- mice microglia distribution was loose and intracellular CD68+ lysosomes were smaller in size. a small population of CD11b+/CD45high cells was slightly increased in WT compared to CXCR3-/- mice after 3 weeks. a small population of CD11b+/CD45high cells was slightly increased in WT compared to CXCR3-/- mice after 3 weeks. Flow cytometry further confirms reduced microglial activation in cuprizone-treated mice compared to wild type controls. characterization of microglia in cuprizone-treated mice outlined a differential spatial distribution, accumulation and attenuated activation in CXCR3-/- mice. cuprizone intoxication induces a robust demyelination of different brain regions in wild type (WT) and CXCR3-/-mice. cuprizone intoxication induces a robust demyelination of different brain regions in wild type (WT) and CXCR3-/-mice. we further analyzed the CD11b+/CD45dim microglia population. we found strongly reduced surface expression of CD45 on CXCR3-/- microglia. after three weeks of cuprizone ingestion, the reduction of CD45 and CD11b molecules on CXCR3-/- microglia was most intense compared to WT mice. we could not detect significant differences in the composition of CD11b+/CD45dim and CD11b+/CD45high microglia/ macrophages between cuprizone-treated CXCR3-/- mice compared to wild type controls. hypertrophic astrocytic cell bodies were found in close proximity to the corpus callosum (Cc) and within the thalamus (Th) of WT. in all three regions of interest, GFAP+ cells were quantified using sections of both genotypes from corresponding brain regions. thalamic regions and the corpus callosum showed significantly reduced numbers of GFAP+ cells in CXCR3-/- compared to WT animals. the findings were detectable close to zones of microglia activation in the Cc and Th (overview together with enlarged insets below). we compared the brain levels of key inflammatory cytokines during cuprizone treatment of CXCR3-deficient and WT mice. at that time point we could detect no (IL6, Ifng, Cxcl9 and Ccl5) or only minimal (Tnf, Ccl2, Ccl3 and Cxcl10) upregulated transcripts in CXCR3-/- mice compared to untreated controls. copies of mRNA/Gapdh peaked in WT but were strongly reduced in CXCR3-/- animals. total RNA was isolated from freshly prepared brain homogenates using Trizol before cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III enzyme. Cuprizone ingestion induces a highly reproducible and robust demyelination of multiple brain regions in WT and CXCR3-/- mice. qPCR of myelin basic protein (Mbp), proteolipid protein (myelin) 1 (Plp1) and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase (Cnp), which indicates oligodendrocytic gene transcription. no significant differences were detectable between WT and CXCR3-/- animals. withdrawal of cuprizone diet did not alter the levels for myelin specific transcripts detectable between WT and CXCR3-/- animals. a rapid drop of body weight was detectable after the first week of cuprizone feeding. the body mass of WT mice was reduced to 80.4 0.9%. in CXCR3-/- mice dropped to 90.8 1.9% of the initial weight. cuprizone administration induces a less overt body weight decline in CXCR3-/- compared with wild type (WT) mice. from 8 weeks of age, WT and CXCR3-/- mice were fed with 0.2% cuprizone for five weeks (dotted grid lines) with a subsequent four days of recovery to normal chow (5.5 weeks) lectin staining was found in the thalamus (Th), the midbrain and the hypothalamus of CXCR3-/- mice. sagittal brain sections of wild type (WT) and CXCR3-/- were analyzed for the localization of activated microglia at regions of the corpus callosum (Cc), thalamus (Th) and cerebellum (Cb) we also found a differential spatial distribution of microglia surrounding the cerebellar nuclei together with a consistent cluster at the vestibular nuclei of the medulla after 5 weeks. we further investigated microglia using double fluorescence immunolabeling for CD68 (red) and MBP (green) lectin+ microglia in the corpus callosum of WT and CXCR3-/- mice showed larger and round-shaped CD68+ compartment in WT than in CXCR3-/- animals. microglia localized in white matter components exhibit larger and round-shaped CD68+ compartment in WT compared to CXCR3-/- mice in the corpus callosum. microglia of both genotypes were phenotyped using flow cytometry. a small population of CD11b+/CD45high cells was slightly increased in WT compared to CXCR3-/- mice after 3 weeks. glia population of WT (black dots) and CXCR3-/- (red dots) mice over the course of the cuprizone experiment. fundamentally reduced MFI of CD45 (3 and 5 weeks) and CD11b (3 weeks) were documented in CXCR3-/- compared to WT microglia (**P 0.005, ***P 0.001) cuprizone intoxication induces a robust demyelination of different brain regions in wild type (WT) and CXCR3-/-mice. cuprizone-fed mice showed decreased MBP+ fluorescence signal in frontal corpus callosum (Cc), thalamus (Th) and the nucleus of the cerebellum (Cb) p1 and Cnp transcripts document equal level in WT and CXCR3-/- mice at all dissected time points of the experiment. upregulation of the level of myelinogenic transcripts was found after withdrawal of cuprizone for 4 days (5.5 weeks) data represent mean SEM, n = 4 to 5 for each genotype and time point. the percentage of CD11b-negative CD45+ events continuously lay below 1.3% in WT and CXCR3-/- animals. however, we could not detect significant differences in the composition of CD11b+/CD45dim and CD11b+/CD45high microglia/ macrophages between WT and CXCR3-deficient mice. hypertrophic astrocytic cell bodies were found in close proximity to the corpus callosum (Cc) and within the substantial overlapping of neighboring astrocyte processes with confluent cellular signals were detected in WT but not in CXCR3-/- animals. in thalamic regions and the corpus callosum, we could find significantly reduced numbers of GFAP+ cells in CXCR3-/- compared to WT animals. GFAP+ cells in both regions of interest indicate increased numbers in WT compared to CXCR3-deficient mice. attenuated levels of proinflammatory transcripts in CXCR3-deficient mice correlate with diminished accumulation and activation of microglia and astrocytes. 10-5, copies of mRNA/Gapdh), Il6 (3 weeks, WT: 1.2 0.3 10-4 versus CXCR3-/-: 3.8 0.4 10-6, copies of mRNA/Gapdh) and Ifng (3 weeks, WT: 6.2 2.5 10-5 versus CXCR3-/-: 1.4 3.6 10-6, copies of mRNA/Gapdh) peaked in WT but were strongly reduced. the findings of the qRT-PCR analysis outline a striking attenuation of proinflammatory cytokines in CXCR3-/- mice compared to WT animals during cuprizone feeding. Cuprizone-mediated demyelination is not significantly altered in CXCR3-deficient mice Cuprizone ingestion induces a highly reproducible and robust demyelination of multiple brain regions in WT mice. no significant differences were detectable between WT and CXCR3-/- animals. withdrawal of cuprizone diet did not alter the levels for myelin specific transcripts detectable between WT and CXCR3-/- animals. we examined the impact of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on glial activation in cuprizone-induced demyelination. this is in contrast to most of the previous studies examining CXCR3 in the context of neuroinflammatory models with a high influx of hematogenous immune cells. this is in contrast to most of the previous studies examining CXCR3 in the context of neuroinflammatory models. a lack of astrocytes during cuprizone feeding results in less demyelination and less microglial activation. a lack of astrocytes during cuprizone feeding results in less demyelination. a lack of astrocytes during cuprizone feeding results in less demyelination. cerebral CXCL10 could not detect a significant change in the course of de- and remyelination between CXCR3-competent and CXCR3-deficient mice. the lack of CXCR3 on microglia and microglia has a synergistic effect on the activation of the cell types. oligodendrocyte precursor cells are recruited, proliferate and have to undergo maturation. remyelin-related RNA levels have been increased after cuprizone demyelination. this argues against a function of CXCR3 in remyelination after cuprizone demyelination.
