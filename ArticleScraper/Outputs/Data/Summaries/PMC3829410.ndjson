{"summary": "Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) are associated with IFN- receptors. IFNAR1 plays a key role in all aspects of IFN-mediated effects. COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a protein complex composed of eight subunits. TYK2 contributes to the IFN-induced signaling through its kinase activity. TYK2 stabilizes basal IFNAR1 protein expression and ligand binding ability by kinase-independent mechanisms. PCR was used to amplify the cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 868\u20131187. the bait plasmid, pGBKT7/TYK2, was stably expressed in yeast strain AH109. all yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously. human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells were purchased from Kurabo (Osaka, Japan) and maintained in HuMedia-SG2 (Kurabo), supplemented with 5% FCS, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, 50 g/ml gentamycin, 0.5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 2 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor-B, and 5 g/ml insulin. 293T cells were trans horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare. plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged JAB1 and TYK2 proteins were transfected into HeLa cells by jetPEI.

HeLa cells were incubated with either IFN-, NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor or both for 24 h. fixed cells were centrifuged to remove ethanol and the pellets were resuspended in propidium iodide. full-length human JAB1 cDNA was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) full-length human JAB1, JAB1 D151N, and JAB1 N mutants were generated by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the FLAG-tagged mammalian expression plasmid pSF1. immunoprecipitates from indicated cell lysate resolved by SDS-PAGE. membranes were then immunoblotted with the different primary antibodies. primary antibodies were rabbit anti-FLAG and mouse anti-Myc antibodies. a rabbit anti-JAB1 antibody (FL-334; Santa Cruz) and a monoclonal anti-TYK2 antibody (clone 51; BD Transduction Laboratories) were used for endogenous protein detection. DNA was visualized by staining with DAPI (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 g of total RNA with ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) the primers used for qPCR were: IRF1, 5\u2032-AGCTCAGCTGTGTGTA-3\u2032 (sense) and 5\u2032-TAGCTGCTGTGGTCATCAGG-3\u2032 (antisense); CXCL11, 5\u2032-AGAGGACGCTGTCTTTGCAT-3\u2032 (sense) and 5 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with appropriate amounts of the self-inactivating lentiviral vector pCSII-CMV-MCS-IRES-hrGFP. the viral supernatants were collected 72 h after transfection and concentrated 300-fold by ultracentrifugation for 2 h. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening To generate a bait construct with human TYK2, PCR was used to amplify the cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 868\u20131187. the bait plasmid, pGBKT7/TYK2, was stably expressed in yeast strain AH109. keratinocytes (HaCaT) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS. a human leukemia cell line (Jurkat) and a human pre-B cell leukemia were maintained in RPMI 1640. plasmids encoding TYK2 and JAB1 proteins were transfected by jetPEI. the primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-FLAG and mouse anti-Myc antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) AB1), 5\u2032-GCUCAGAGUAUCGAUGAAA-3\u2032; TYK2, 5\u2032-GGAGAAACCTCCAATCTCA-3\u2032; COPS4 (CSN4), 5\u2032-GGGGCTTACATAAAT-3\u2032; and NEDD8, 5\u2032-AGGUGGAAUCAAGGA-3\u2032. cells were plated on 24-well plates at 2 104 cells/well and incubated with an siRNA (10 pmol) and Lipofectamine 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with appropriate amounts of the self-inactivating lentiviral vector pCSII-CMV-MCS-IRES-IRES-hrGFP. the lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (31) was generated according to previously described procedures (32). the viral supernatants were collected 72 h after transfection. they were concentrated 300-fold by ultracentrifugation at 23,200 rpm. for infection, cells were plated on 48-well plates and cultured in DMEM. all yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously. the full-length human JAB1 cDNA was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) the full-length human JAB1, JAB1 D151N, and JAB1 N mutants were subcloned into pCS2-MT vector. MG132 was purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan) NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor was purchased from LifeSensors (Malvern, PA) immunoprecipitates from the indicated cell lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. membranes were then immunoblotted with different primary antibodies. the primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-FLAG and mouse anti-Myc antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) for endogenous protein detection, a rabbit anti-JAB1 antibody (FL-334; Santa Cruz) and a monoclonal anti-TYK2 antibody (clone 51; BD Transduction Laboratories) RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Quantitative Real Time PCR cells were harvested and assayed for their luciferase activities using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) the cells were stimulated with human IFN- (provided by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with appropriate amounts of the self-inactivating lentiviral vector pCSII-CMV-MCS-IRES-hrGFP. the viral supernatants were collected 72 h after transfection and concentrated 300-fold by ultracentrifugation at 23,200 rpm. a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the kinase domain of TYK2 fused to the Gal DNA-binding domain (Y2H bait) as bait. a human placenta cDNA library was screened. one clone encoded the N terminus-truncated portion of previously described JAB1 (Y2H clone) we also generated a JAB1C mutant (JAB1 N) which lacks the nuclear export signal-containing C-terminal potion of JAB1. we tested whether the JAB1-TYK2 interaction requires an intact JAMM motif. the mutant was transfected into 293T cells with the TYK2 construct. cells were stimulated with or without IFN- (1000 units/ml) for 5 min. the cells were then lysed, immunoprecipitated with control IgG or anti-TYK2 antibody. cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (for TYK2) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody (for JAB1) unexpectedly, TYK2KD interacted with JAB1 similarly to the full-length TYK2. endogenous TYK2 co-localized with endogenous JAB1 in cells in absence or presence of IFN- stimulation. their co-localization was observed in both nuclei and cytoplasm (20, 33, 34) these data suggest that JAB1 has the ability to interact with TYK2 in mammalian cells. knockdown of JAB1 attenuates transcriptional activation induced by IFN-. cells were transfected with control or JAB1 siRNA. the cells were then stimulated with IFN- (1000 units/ml) for 2 h. knockdown of JAB1 significantly reduced luciferase activities by ISRE-Luc and STAT3-Luc after IFN- stimulation. results suggest that JAB1 is involved in the optimal IFN--induced signaling and gene expression. TYK2 siRNA induced a significant decrease in the IFNAR1 protein level. TYK2 siRNA also induced a decrease in the protein level of IFNAR1. the decrease was more severe. the results are the means of eight independent experiments. the error bars represent the S.E. (n = 8). the error bars represent the S.E. (n = 8). 2 or CSN4 subunit by siRNA induced a reduction in JAB1 protein amounts. previously reported results show that down-regulation or deletion of one CSN component can affect expression of other CSN subunits. neddylation generally results in the subsequent activation of ubiquitin ligases. MG132 treatment did not stabilize IFNAR1 protein at all. however, this MG132-induced degradation of IFNAR1 was largely cancelled. FNGR1 knockdown also resulted in a decrease of IFN-induced activation of STAT1 in HeLa cells. this is because the NAE inhibitor, MLN4924, effectively inactivates SCF E3 by blocking Cullin neddylation. the levels of IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation were enhanced by the pretreatment with NAE inhibitor. these results suggest that inhibition of the neddylation pathway can augment STAT1 activation effects of IFN- by stabilizing the IFNAR1 protein level. the results are the means of five independent experiments. the error bars represent the S.E. (n = 5), p 0.05 and **, p 0.01. HeLa cells were treated with IFN- (1000 units/ml) in absence or presence of NAE inhibitor (1 m) for 24 h. the results are the means of three independent experiments. we also analyzed the cell cycle in HeLa cells treated with NAE inhibitor in the absence or presence of NAE inhibitor. we also examined effects of NAE inhibitor on endogenous IFNAR1 protein level in nontransformed cell (human smooth muscle) a clone encoded the N terminus-truncated portion of previously described JAB1 (Y2H clone) the cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCS2-MT. the resulting expression vector produced a protein that interacted with TYK2 in 293T cells. cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-TYK2 antibody. aliquot of total cell lysate was also analyzed. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. cells were left untreated or treated with IFN- (1000 units/ml) TYK2 domains responsible for interaction with JAB1 were then determined. a human cervix carcinoma cell line, HeLa, expressed both JAB1 and TYK2. the cell line was stimulated with IFN- to activate TYK2. a part of TYK2 spontaneously associates in HeLa cells. tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2 was clearly detected in control HeLa cells within 5 min after IFN- stimulation. tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was greatly decreased by knockdown of JAB1. TYK2 knockdown had a larger influence on STAT1 phosphorylation than knockdown of TYK2 alone. the cells were transfected with control or JAB1 siRNA. the cells were then stimulated with IFN- (1000 units/ml) 24 h after stimulation. the cells were then harvested, and the luciferase activities were measured. IFN--induced IRF1, CXCL11, and PML mRNA expressions were all significantly reduced in JAB1 knockdown HeLa cells. we also analyzed the mRNA levels of JAB1 itself and IFNAR1 which are important components of the IFN- receptor complex. JAB1 maintains the protein level of IFNAR1 at protein levels. the cells were transfected with control, or TYK2 siRNA. lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. neddylation increased from 29.9% in control cells to 44.4% in JAB1 knockdown cells. NEDD8 is involved in the IFNAR1 protein level. ligand-induced degradation of IFNAR1 is slowed down by knockdown of NEDD8. cells were transfected with control or NEDD8 siRNA. the cells were then lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis. the time-dependent decrease of IFNAR1 protein after the stimulation with IFN- was delayed in the NEDD8 knockdown cells. we also tested the effects of JAB1 knockdown on protein levels of other IFN receptors. lysosomal inhibitors (NH4Cl or chloroquine) or proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 12 h, and then total cell extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis. the results are consistent with the data showing that the protein turnover of IFNAR1 requires NEDD8. HeLa cells were treated with NAE inhibitor (1 m), NH4Cl (20 mm), chloroquine (50 m), or MG132 (10 m) for 12 h. the cells were lysed and lysate was immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. the results are the means of three independent experiments. the error bars represent the S.E. (n = 3) the results are the means of three independent experiments. we evaluated the combination effect of NAE inhibitor with IFN- on the growth of HeLa cells. either IFN- or NAE inhibitor has been shown to suppress tumor cell viability. we also examined effects of NAE inhibitor on endogenous IFNAR1 protein level in nontransformed cell. a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the kinase domain of TYK2 fused to the Gal DNA-binding domain (Y2H bait) as bait. one clone encoded the N terminus-truncated portion of previously described JAB1 (Y2H clone) the resulting expression vector produced a protein that interacted with TYK2 in 293T cells. single amino acid substitution from the conserved Asp to Asn at codon 151 (JAB1 D151N) is impaired in its activity. we also generated a JAB1C mutant (JAB1 N) which lacks the nuclear export signal-containing C-terminal potion of JAB1. AG-JAB1 was transfected into 293T cells with the TYK2 constructs. cells were stimulated with or without IFN- (1000 units/ml) for 5 min. aliquot of total cell lysate was also analyzed. the full-length TYK2 or TYK2KD construct was transfected into 293T cells. cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (for TYK2) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody (for JAB1) unexpectedly, TYK2KD interacted with JAB1 similarly to the full-length TYK2. endogenous TYK2 co-localized with endogenous JAB1 in cells in absence or presence of IFN- stimulation. TYK2 knockdown had a larger influence on STAT1 phosphorylation than JAB1 knockdown. knockdown of JAB1 attenuates TYK2 and STAT activation induced by IFN-. cells were transfected with control or JAB1 siRNA. cells were then stimulated with IFN- (1000 units/ml) for 2 h. the data represent the levels of mRNA normalized to the ACTB internal control and are expressed relative to the value of control siRNA-treated samples without IFN- stimulation. we did not observe any changes in the protein levels of TYK2 or downstream STAT proteins by transfection of JAB1 siRNA. TYK2 siRNA also induced a significant decrease in the protein level of IFNAR1. eddylated and unmodified bands were quantified by densitometry. the percentage of neddylated to the total of neddylated bands is indicated. the results are the means of eight independent experiments. NEDD8 is involved in the IFNAR1 turnover. previously reported results show that down-regulation or deletion of one CSN component can affect expression of other CSN subunits. sate was immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. the increase in CUL1 neddylation generally results in the subsequent activation of SCF ubiquitin E3 ligases and the ubiquitin proteasome system (8\u201310). JAB1 knockdown decreased endogenous IFNGR1 as well as IFNAR1 level, but not IFNAR2 level. also resulted in a decrease of IFN-induced activation of STAT1 in HeLa cells. NAE inhibitor treatment successfully reduced the CUL1 neddylation level but did not alter the JAB1 amount. the levels of IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation were enhanced by the pretreatment with NAE inhibitor. these results suggest that inhibition of the neddylation pathway can augment STAT1 activation effects of IFN- by stabilizing the IFNAR1 protein level. the data are expressed as percentages relative to DMSO-treated cells stimulated with IFN- (15 min) the results are the means of five independent experiments. the results are the means of three independent experiments. the error bars represent the S.E. (n = 3); the results are the means of three independent experiments. FN- effectively suppresses HeLa cell viability better than either of these agents alone. we also analyzed the cell cycle in HeLa cells treated with NAE inhibitor in the absence or presence of NAE inhibitor. a human placenta cDNA library was screened. to determine whether this clone encoded a protein able to interact with TYK2 in mammalian cells, the cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCS2-MT. the expression vector produced a protein that interacted with TYK2 in 293T cells. cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. aliquot of total cell lysate was also analyzed. localization of endogenous JAB1 and endogenous TYK2 was analyzed. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. cells were left untreated or treated with IFN- (1000 units/ml) for 30 min. a human cervix carcinoma cell line, HeLa, expressed both JAB1 and TYK2, and the cell line was stimulated with IFN- to activate TYK2. a part of JAB1 spontaneously associates in HeLa cells. a subcellular localization of TYK2 was examined. tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2 was clearly detected in control HeLa cells within 5 min after IFN- stimulation. tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was greatly decreased by knockdown of JAB1. TYK2 knockdown had a larger influence on STAT1 phosphorylation than knockdown of TYK2 alone. knockdown of JAB1 attenuates transcriptional activation induced by IFN-. HeLa cells were transfected with control or JAB1 siRNA. the cells were then transfected with ISRE-LUC or STAT3-LUC using jetPEI. IFN--induced IRF1, CXCL11, and PML mRNA expressions were all significantly reduced in JAB1 knockdown HeLa cells. we also analyzed the mRNA levels of JAB1 itself and IFNAR1 which are important components of the IFN- receptor complex. results suggest that JAB1 is involved in the optimal IFN--induced signaling and gene expression. JAB1 maintains the protein level of IFNAR1 at protein levels. the cells were transfected with control, or TYK2 siRNA. lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. IFNAR1 level decreased to 58.5% of control value by knockdown of JAB1. CUL1 neddylation increased from 29.9% in control cells to 44.4% in JAB1 knockdown cells. this data suggest that JAB1 may be involved in the IFNAR1 protein level through CSN deneddylation activity. proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 m) was added and incubated for 5 h. ligand-induced degradation of IFNAR1 is slowed down by knockdown of NEDD8. cells were transfected with control or NEDD8 siRNA. neddylation, but not the proteasome activity itself, correlates to IFNAR1 degradation. neddylation induces polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IFNAR1 in an SCFTrcp-dependent manner (6). lysosomal inhibitors (NH4Cl or chloroquine) or proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment reduced the IFNAR1 level. the results are consistent with the data showing that the protein turnover of IFNAR1 requires NEDD8 and that IFNAR1 is degraded. HeLa cells were treated with NAE inhibitor (1 m), NH4Cl (20 mm), chloroquine (50 m), or MG132 (10 m) for 12 h. the cells were lysed, and lysate was immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. the results are the means of three independent experiments. the error bars represent the S.E. (n = 3) the results are the means of three independent experiments. keratinocyte haCaT, human hepatoma Hep3B, human pre-B cell leukemia NALM-6 were treated with NAE inhibitor (1 m) for 12 h. either IFN- or NAE inhibitor has been shown to suppress tumor cell viability, we evaluated the combination effect of NAE inhibitor with IFN- on the growth of HeLa cells. endogenous IFNAR1 protein level in nontransformed cell (human smooth muscle) treatment of NAE inhibitor increased the IFNAR1 content in these cells as well as HeLa cells. expression of TYK2 and JAB1 was not influenced by the treatment with NAE inhibitor, whereas expression of NRF2 a Cullin-RING ligase substrate (47) was significantly increased. this NEDDylaton effect on IFNAR1 is likely to be general. CF complex is controlled by neddylation and deneddylation of Cullin subunits (12) these previous observations have implicated the involvement of the neddylation/deneddylation mechanism in the regulation of IFNAR1 protein stability. we tested the effect of JAB1 knockdown on the protein level of IFNAR1. endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response is correlated well with degradation of IFNAR1 in cells. MG132-induced degradation of IFNAR1 was enhanced by JAB1 knockdown and suppressed by NEDD8 knockdown. neddylation-defective CUL1 K720R mutant protein is more stable than wild type in cells. we demonstrated that JAB1 interacted with TYK2 constitutively and that JAB1 knockdown induced an approximately 40% decrease of the amount of IFNAR1 protein. in the absence of TYK2 protein, we did not observe any changes in IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation after knockdown of JAB1."}
