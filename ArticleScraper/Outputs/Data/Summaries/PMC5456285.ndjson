{"summary": "human coronaviruses (HCoVs) represent a major group of coronaviruses (CoVs) associated with multiple respiratory diseases of varying severity, including common cold, pneumonia and bronchilitis. HCoVs are recognised as one of the most rapidly evolving viruses owing to its high genomic nucleotide substitution rates and recombination. phylogenetic studies pointed to the bat origin of SARS-CoV based on sequences of SARS-like virus found in bats. the epidemic surfaced in 2012 with similar clinical symptoms as SARS-CoV. transmission of MERS-CoV is geographically limited. onavirus HCoV-229E 1966 Human Aminopeptidase N (CD13) Bats [1,2,21] HCoV-NL63 2004 ACE2 Palm Civets, Bats [3,21] Beta-coronavirus HCoV-OC43 1967 9-O-Acetylated sialic acid Cattle [4,5] HcoV-HKU1 2005 9-O-Acetylated sialic acid Mice [6,7] HCoV genomes range from 26 to 32 kilobases (kb) in size. overlapping open reading frames (ORF) ORF1a and ORF1b comprise two-thirds of the coronavirus genome. the other one-third encodes for a set of structural (orange) and non-structural proteins (green) or Betacoronaviruses, including Alphacoronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, and Betacoronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. helically symmetrical nucleocapsid encloses a single-stranded and positive sense viral genomic RNA viral genome. replicase-transcriptase is the only protein translated from the genome. the viral products of all downstream open reading frames are derived from subgenomic mRNAs. the replicase gene makes up approximately 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome. coV infection begins with the attachment of the S1 domain of the spike protein (S) with its cognate receptor. this drives the conformational change in the S2 subunit in S, promoting the fusion of the viral and cell plasma membrane. the replicase-polymerase is involved in the coronaviral replication. the host receptor is a major determinant of pathogenicity, tissue tropism and host range of the virus. the attachment to specific host cellular receptors via the spike (S) protein triggers a conformational change in the S protein, which then promotes membrane fusion between the viral and cell membrane through the S2 domain. the low pH in the cellular environment and endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins may help to facilitate membrane fusion and endosomal coV cell entry. other host proteases, such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and airway trypsin-like protease TMPRSS11D, could also perform S1/S2 cleavage to activate the S protein for non-endosomal virus the downstream ORF1b is translated into polyproteins pp1a (4382 amino acids) and pp1ab (7073 amino acids) this repositioning is enabled by two RNA elements. polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are cleaved into at least 15 nsp, which assemble and form the replication-transcription complex. nucleocapsid containing the genomic RNA interacts with other viral structural proteins (S, E and M proteins) to form the assembled virion. the assembly of coV particles is completed through budding of the helical nucleocapsid through membranes early in the secretory pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) the host in this phase of the infection cycle has rarely been explored. host cell receptors are known as aminopeptidase N by HCoV-229E [26], angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by SARS-CoV [27] and HCoV-NL63 [28,29], dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) by MERS-CoV [30] and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 [ IFITM could inhibit global circulating HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 S protein mediated entry. cell-to-cell fusion assays suggest that IFITM blocks the enveloped virus entry by preventing fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane or endosomal membranes. hnRNPA1, PTB, SYN-CRYP have been found to be essential for efficient RNA replication. other RNA-binding proteins have also been suggested to play a role in coV replication. the helical nucleocapsid containing the genomic RNA interacts with other viral structural proteins to form the assembled virion. human Coronavirus Infection and Apoptosis Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that is tightly regulated and anti-inflammatory. when cells undergo apoptosis, they demonstrate specific hallmarks such as cell shrinkage, extensive plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear pykosis, DNA fragmentation and asymmetrical distribution of plasma membrane. to date, two main mechanisms of apoptosis have been established\u2014the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. ation of initiator caspase 9 in the intrinsic pathway results in proteolytic cleavage effector caspases 3 and 7. pro-apoptotic Bcl2-like family members contain all four BH domains. a second class, known as BH3-only proteins, lacks the BH4 domain. BH3-only proteins act as direct activators to induce Bak-Bak insertion. these BH3-only proteins can be suppressed by Bcl2-like protein. apoptosis is induced as one of the host antiviral responses to limit virus replication. autopsy studies of HCoV-infected tissues revealed apoptosis induced in lung, spleen and thyroid [75]. HCoVs have also been shown to infect the immune system and induce apoptosis in immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, T lymphocytes and dendritic cells [69,76,77,78,79]. infection of HCoV-OC43 was shown to promote BAX translocation to the mitochondria in human neuronal cells. caspases 3 and 9 were activated in HCoV-OC43-infected murine and human neuronal cells. addition of pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK did not affect viability of these infected neuronal cells. recombinant HCoV-OC43 harbouring point mutations at its S protein induced stronger caspase 3 activation and nuclear fragmentation than the wild-type virus. localisation of SARS-CoV N and 9b protein is associated with induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis by HCoVs. autopsy studies of SARS-CoV-infected tissues revealed apoptosis induced in lung, spleen and thyroid. HCoVs have also been shown to infect the immune system and induce apoptosis in immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, T lymphocytes and dendritic cells. apoptosis can also be induced by the less pathogenic strains of HCoVs. caspases 3 and 9 were activated in HCoV-OC43-infected murine and human neuronal cells. a non-classical programmed cell death mechanism induced in HCoV infection is likely to be manipulated by viral proteins. HCoV-OC43 wild type S protein has been shown to induce unfolded protein response (UPR) in human neuronal NT2-N and LA-N-5 cell lines. recombinant HCoV-OC43 harbouring point mutations at its S protein induced stronger caspase 3 activation and nuclear fragmentation than the wild-type virus. the immune response is modulated during pathogen exposure in a cell-type dependent fashion. the host and virus can manipulate innate immune mechanisms as a form of defence or evasion strategy. other TLRs, such as TLR2 and 4, sense viral proteins as exemplified in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis virus, measles virus and human immunodeficiency virus. TLRs recruit toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-containing signalling adaptor molecules, such as MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- adaptor protein MAVS is localized at the mitochondria and peroxisomes. MAVS activates transcription factors such as interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), IRF3 and NF-B to trigger the expression of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. e-1 induces the cleavage of pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 into their active forms. type I IFNs are classified into type I, II and III based on their preference for specific IFN receptors. a huge rise in type I IFNs were detected in cells infected with HCoV strain 229E [80,124,128]. two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the HCoV-mediated inhibition of type I IFN production. structural proteins, nonstructural proteins and accessory proteins of HCoVs have been shown to modify innate immune responses. nsp1 of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been demonstrated to modify capped non-viral RNAs to facilitate endonucleolytic cleavage of host messenger RNA. this induces the host shutoff mechanism, as transcription and translation of viral RNA are more favoured over that of host mRNA. expression of MERS-CoV PLpro also antagonizes IFN production. it has been identified that the ADP-ribose-1-monophosphatase macrodomain encoded within nsp3 in HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV is responsible for suppressing IFN induction. accessory proteins of HCoV, ORF4a, -4b and -5, could similarly suppress IRF3 nuclear translocation. TLRs are a type I transmembrane protein localized to either the cell surface or endosomal vesicles. their leucine-rich repeats domain mediates the recognition of PAMPs and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from various sources including bacteria, fungi and viruses. retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation associated factor 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) possess two caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs) at their N terminal, a DExD/H-box RNA helicase domain (x can be any amino acid) and a repressor domain (RD) at the C terminal. the yellow-orange boxes show the viral proteins that have been reported to modulate host innate immunity at multiple stages. the viral proteins are organized into three main domains: a CARD domain, pyrin domain (PYD) or baculovirus inhibitor repeat domain at the intermediate region. the LRR motifs detect viral PAMPs to induce a structural rearrangement. ISFG3 is a transcription factor that binds to its cognate DNA sequence known as IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) to activate transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) many of these ISGs such as 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylatesynthetase and protein kinase R confer resistance against virus invasions [121] nsp1 of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been demonstrated to modify capped non-viral RNAs to facilitate endonucleolytic cleavage of host messenger RNA (mRNA) nsp1 of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been demonstrated to modify capped non-viral RNAs to facilitate endonucleolytic cleavage of host messenger RNA (mRNA) several residues of SARS-CoV nsp1 were identified to affect IFN-dependent signalling. nsp1 and nsp3 proteins possess papain-like protease (PLpro) domains also antagonize IFN production. expression of PLpro also antagonizes IFN production. accessory proteins of MERS-CoV, ORF4a, -4b and -5, could also suppress IRF3 nuclear translocation. this could significantly reduce IFN- promoter-driven luciferase activity in cells transfected with accessory proteins. this inhibition was not observed when expressing the M protein of HCoV-HKU1. several residues of SARS-CoV nsp1 were identified to affect host mRNA translation. this induces the host shutoff mechanism, as transcription and translation of viral RNA are more favoured than that of host mRNA. accessory proteins of MERS-CoV, ORF4a, -4b and -5, could also suppress IRF3 nuclear translocation. this inhibition was not observed when expressing the M protein of HCoV-HKU1. this activity is not conserved among all HCoV strains. nsp1 of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV nsp3 proteins has been demonstrated to modify capped non-viral RNAs to facilitate endonucleolytic cleavage of host messenger RNA. nsp1 interacted with the 40S subunit of ribosome to prevent host mRNA translation. this induces the host shutoff mechanism, as transcription and translation of viral RNA are more favoured over that of host mRNA HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV are responsible for suppressing IFN induction. accessory proteins disrupt IFN signalling by preventing IFN-induced activation of interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in promoter region of ISG. in cases of prolonged and irreversible ER stress, apoptosis mechanisms are triggered. the host mounts UPR as its antiviral response 145. PERK signalling pathway Activation of PERK is initiated by its dissociation of the luminal domain from the ER chaperone, binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation was detected in SARS-CoV-infected cells. inhibition of PKR using antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers did not affect eIF2 phosphorylation. PERK was also found to be activated during SARS-CoV infection [75], possibly through its S and 3a proteins [151,152] PKR, PERK and eIF2 were moderately induced at the early stages of IBV infection. but the moderate and transient increase in eIF2 phosphorylation was sufficient to activate ATF4 protein translation and upregulate the downstream targets of ATF4, ATF3 and GADD153. IRE1 signalling pathway IRE1 is believed to be the last UPR branch to be activated in cells undergoing ER stress [162]. IRE1 signalling pathway IRE1 is believed to be the most conserved among all UPR arms. a 252-nucleotide intron from homologous to atf/Creb1 (HAC1) mRNA in yeasts and a 26-nucleotide intron from X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA in humans. XBP1u also promotes the transcription of E3 ubiquitin ligase synoviolin to enhance IRE1 ubiquitination. 1 splicing was observed in recombinant SARS-CoV-infected cells. deletion of E protein in recombinant SARS-CoV resulted in significant XBP1 splicing and higher rate of apoptosis. ire1-XBP1 pathway is activated during IBV infection. poptotic function of IRE1 during IBV infection could be mediated by its splicing of XBP1. IRE1 induction was shown to mediate JNK hyperphosphorylation and Akt hypophosphorylation to potentiate the IBV-infected cells to apoptosis. PERK signalling pathway Activation of PERK is initiated by its dissociation of the luminal domain from the ER chaperone, binding immunoglobul PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation was detected in SARS-CoV-infected cells. inhibition of PKR using antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers did not affect eIF2 phosphorylation but significantly reduced SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis. PERK was also found to be activated during SARS-CoV infection. TF4 protein translation and upregulate downstream targets of ATF4, ATF3 and GADD153. upregulation of GADD153 is postulated to induce pro-apoptotic protein TRIB3 and inhibit pro-survival ERK protein. more studies could be done on HCoV infection to analyze the activation of the PKR/PERK/eIF2 pathway. IRE1 signalling pathway IRE1 is believed to be the last UPR branch to be activated in cells undergoing ER stress [162]. IRE1 signalling pathway IRE1 is believed to be the last UPR branch to be activated in cells undergoing ER stress [162]. splicing of XBP1 generates luciferase activity. transcription factor, XBP1s, promotes expression of genes related to protein entry into the ER, folding and ERAD. the unspliced variant XBP1u contained a nuclear exclusion signal to sequester XBP1s from the nucleus. IRE1 can cleave ER-associated mRNA species through regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) during late stages of ER stress. IRE1-XBP1 pathway is activated during HCoV-OC43 infection. spliced and unspliced forms of XBP1 were shown to be anti-apoptotic. overexpression of a dominant-negative XBP1 enhanced IBV-induced apoptosis. multiple MAPK pathways have been identified in mammals. in all MAPK pathways, the signals are transduced downstream via a three-tier protein kinase cascade. in each tier, the kinases are activated by upstream kinases by phosphorylation. HCoVs and their viral proteins (yellow-orange boxes) have been shown to induce these MAPK pathways. modulation of MAPK Pathways Phosphorylation of all three MAPK members has been detected in cells infected with SARS-CoV. ERK activation did not contribute to phosphorylation of its downstream target, p90RSK in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. CCL2 is believed to be responsible for respiratory inflammatory symptoms in SARS patients. expression of SARS-CoV PLpro was shown to increase ERK1 ubiquitin-mediated degradation to suppress IFN-induced responses. other viral proteins of SARS-CoV have also been shown to induce ERK activation. expression of SARS-CoV N protein is associated with downregulation of prosurvival factors and apoptosis induction in COS-1 cells. findings suggest that JNK could act as a pro-apoptotic protein during SARS-CoV infection. however, phosphorylation of JNK was required for the maintenance of vero E6 cells persistently infected with SARS-CoV. downstream effectors of p38, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and activation transcription factor-1 were also activated in SARS-CoV-infected cells. phosphorylation of eIF4a was attenuated by p38 MAPK inhibitor. phosphorylated p38 MAPK level was found to be increased in leukocytes of SARS patients. p38 activation likely contributes to elevated IL8 levels and abnormal cytokine profile in SARS patients. p38 may also be involved in HCoV replication, as exemplified. vimentin, a type III intermediate filament protein, was shown to be critical for entry of SARS-CoV via direct interaction with the viral S protein [184]. binding of SARS-CoV S protein to ACE2 receptor stimulates upregulation of chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) mediated by ERK/AP-1 activation. JNK Pathway Phosphorylation of JNK and its upstream kinases, MKK4/7, was detected in SARS-CoV-infected cells [191] overexpression of SARS-CoV 3a and 7a protein increased JNK activation and augmented IL8 promoter activity. expression of SARS-CoV N protein is associated with the downregulation of prosurvival factors and apoptosis induction in COS-1 cells. the discrepancy of the involvement of JNK in HCoV-229E infections could be attributed to the different virus strains used in the experiments. p38 MAPK Pathway Activation of p38 MAPK has been reported in cells infected with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E. downstream effectors of p38, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2), cAMP response 7a and 3a proteins are likely to co-interact in virus-infected cells. simultaneous co-expression of 7a and 3a proteins may further enhance p38 phosphorylation. p38 may also be involved in HCoV replication, as exemplified by HCoV-229E. ERK1 has been shown to suppress p90RSK phosphorylation compared to ERK2 in the SARS-CoV-infected cells. vimentin, a type III intermediate filament protein, was shown to be critical for entry of SARS-CoV via direct interaction with the viral S protein. phosphorylation of ERK was not significantly affected by HCoV-229E infection. but the level of phosphorylated ERK can be enhanced by the use of chloroquine. targeting the ERK pathway might have significant antiviral potential. p38 MAPK Pathway Activation of p38 MAPK has been reported in cells infected with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E. downstream effectors of p38, MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and activation transcription factor-1 (ATF-1) were also shown to be phosphorylated. p90RSK Ser380 phosphorylation could be negated by p38 MAPK inhibitor. p38 may also be involved in HCoV replication, as exemplified by HCoV-229E. NF-B proteins are a family of transcription factors that regulate expression of genes to control a broad range of biological processes. it has been established that NF-B pathway is often targeted by viral pathogens to enhance viral replication, host cell survival and host immune evasion. p52/RelB heterodimer translocates to the nucleus to activate target genes related to a number of cellular functions. NF-B was activated in lungs of mice infected with recombinant SARS-CoV. NF-B pathway has been shown to play an important role in HCoV infections. NF-B via upregulation of an upstream protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme PKC. deletion of E protein in recombinant SARS-CoV reduced NF-B activation. overexpression of SARS-CoV N protein significantly increased NF-B luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. PLpro domain found within nsp3 of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was shown to antagonize IFN and NF-B activities. expression of SARS-CoV 3a and 7a proteins was shown to significantly induce NF-B-dependent luciferase activity. expression of MERS-CoV ORF4b and ORF4b was shown to moderately attenuate NF-B-dependent luciferase activity induced B inhibitors did not affect virus titres but reduced expression of TNF, CCL2 and CXCL2. HCoV-229E was also shown to mediate IL8 induction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. modulation of NF-B is mediated via several viral proteins of HCoVs. co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that SARS-CoV M protein physically bind to IKKb to sequester it in the cytoplasm. but the MERS-CoV M protein did not affect the luciferase activity controlled by a promoter with NF-B binding sites. expression of its N protein alone was unable to activate NF-B unless under stimulation of TNF. expression of SARS-CoV 3a and 7a proteins was negated by mutating the NF-B binding site on the promoter. expression of MERS-CoV ORF4a, but not ORF4b and ORF5 was shown to inhibit Sendai virus-induced firefly luciferase activity under control of a NFB-responsive promoter. luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner in vero, heLa and Huh-7 cells suggests this induction of NF-B might be cell-specific. but the MERS-CoV M protein did not affect the luciferase activity controlled by a promoter with NF-B binding sites. expression of its N protein alone was unable to activate NF-B unless under the stimulation of TNF. expression of SARS-CoV 3a and 7a proteins was shown to significantly induce NF-B-dependent luciferase activity. expression of MERS-CoV ORF4a, but not ORF4b and ORF5 was shown to moderately attenuate NF-B-dependent luciferase activity induced upon TNF treatment. the recent MERS-CoV outbreak has been mostly limited to the Middle East region. it is likely that more emerging or re-emerging HCoVs might surface to threaten the global public health."}
