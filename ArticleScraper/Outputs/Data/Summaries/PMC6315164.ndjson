{"summary": "ovarian, endometrial, vulvar, fallopian tube and cervical cancers are the leading cause of mortality in women (9.8% of cancer related deaths in women) the most lethal malignancy is ovarian cancer (2, 3) there are many factors that cause gynecologic cancers. the development of a preventive vaccine to limit the infectivity and transmission of the HPV is a tremendous positive step forwards. the design of peptide-based vaccines involves the challenge of ensuring correct antigen processing into MHC class I restricted epitopes to promote CD8+ T cell priming. peptide-based vaccines are non-infectious, completely defined, relatively easy to produce, and generally considered safe. polymorphisms in patients make it difficult to develop a peptide-based vaccine. the usually low immunogenicity of cancer associated antigens also needs the selection of powerful vaccine adjuvants and carriers able to promote strong immune responses. our PSNPs-peptide vaccine formulations have shown protective and therapeutic efficacies in various murine tumor models with multiple diverse peptide antigens. a major challenge in translation remains in understanding the rules by which to select useful peptides that can be appropriately processed and presented to stimulate CD8+ T cell immunity. peptides HPV01, HPV05, HPV08, SV01, SV02, and WT1B were synthesized by auspep. peptides HPV12, SV03 to SV09, WT1A, WT1C, WT1D, and WT1E were synthesized by CS Bio (Menlo Park, CA, United States) each peptide was covalently conjugated to 40\u201350 nm carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs, Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA, United States) each peptide was covalently conjugated to 40\u201350 nm carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles.

Splenocytes (50 l) from immunized mice were added to triplicate wells. plates were then washed 6 times in PBS and incubated with 100 l biotinylated detection antibodies. plates were then washed again, with a final wash using Reverse Osmosis. the magnitudes of the IFN- induction in response to the recall antigen were compared either directly for its spot forming unit (SFU) or normalized against the background response (media alone response) from the same treatment group, calculated as stimulation index (SI) of SFU over background (SI = [SFU from the media alone stimulation in mice under the same treatment] for each corresponding recall antigens) peptides from HPV, Survivin and WT1 were designed, conjugated to nanoparticles and evaluated for their ability to induce antigen specific T cell responses. if this is not confirmed the vaccine combination would not go forward into development for use in humans. if this is not confirmed the vaccine combination would not go forward into development for use in humans. chimeric peptide consisting of two HLA-A2.1-restricted minimal CD8+ T cell epitopes from HPV16-E7 (E78293) and a CD4+ T cell helper construct from HPV16-E6 (E64165) (HPV12) HPV08 VQSTHVDIRTLEDLLMGTLGIVCPI HPV16-E76993 Consists two HLA-A2.1-restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes HPV16-E78290, 8693 (47) and a HLA-DRB1 CD4+ T cell epitope (HPV16-E77387) (50) the quality of the peptide conjugated nanoparticle formulations (peptide-PSNPs) was determined by sizes and polydispersity index (Pdl) as well as conjugation efficiency and antigen loading per particle. the final pH range to generate acceptable sizes for all HPV(peptide)-PSNPs conjugates was selected on the basis of conditions which produce particle-conjugates in the range of 40\u201360 nm with nanoparticle polydispersity (Pdl) 0.2 the dotted lines indicated the acceptable nanovaccine formulation size range at 40\u201360 nm. the dotted lines indicated the acceptable nanovaccine formulation size range at 40\u201360 nm.
