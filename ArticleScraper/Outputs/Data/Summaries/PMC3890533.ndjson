{"summary": "study aimed to estimate TB prevalence of the province in 2010. compared with the 2000 survey, TB prevalence has declined by 80%. 53% of bacteriologically confirmed cases did not present persistent cough. population representative samples were drawn in the surveys of 2000 and 2010 using similar methods. the study aimed to estimate the TB prevalence in Shandong based on the 2010 survey. the survey was conducted from March to June 2010 by survey teams. the study did not involve children under 15 years old. written informed consent was obtained from all participants of 16 years old or above. a positive smear had at least one acid fast bacillus identified during examination of at least 100 fields. participants with positive sputum smear or culture sputum specimens were classified as sputum positive cases. study population The target population of the TB prevalence survey was residents of 15 years old or above who had lived in the selected clusters for more than 6 months. a stratified multi-stage random sampling was used to select the 35 clusters within 17 prefectures in Shandong province. a cluster was defined as a community with a population of 1250 to 1750 adults. if the community contained less than 1250 adult residents, the neighboring community to the north was annexed. if the community contained less than 1250 adults, we randomly selected households and then included all adults in the household for the survey until the total number of selected adults reached 1750. sputum smears were cultured using the L\u00f6wenstein\u2013Jensen medium. samples were excluded from TB when non-tuberculosis bacilli were identified. a positive smear had at least one acid fast bacillus identified. all three samples of sputum positive, bacteriologically confirmed and all TB cases were randomly selected. the survey identified 172 new cases, including 19 new bacteriologically confirmed cases, and 153 CXRAY suggestive bacterially negative cases. four cases with culture positive non-tuberculosis bacilli excluded from TB patients. symptom consultation alone identified 308 suspects, including 6 (1.9%) sputum smear positive TB. 42% of the 512 suspected cases completed the additional questionnaire, 42% were farmers and 31% were current smokers. smoking rate was higher among TB cases compared with non-TB cases, but no significant differences were found (P > 0.05). 158 (31) Non smokers 6 (55) 12 (63) 116 (67) 238 (70) 354 (69) per capita household income (RMB per year) 3297 3374c 4971c 7272 6495 aIlliterates had the highest proportion of TB cases compared with people with other educational backgrounds. bPeople with high education or above had the lowest proportion of TB cases compared with people with other educational backgrounds.
