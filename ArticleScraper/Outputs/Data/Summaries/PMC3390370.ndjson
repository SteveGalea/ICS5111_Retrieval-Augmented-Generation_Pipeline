{"summary": "pregnancy has been an acknowledged risk factor for severe complications from influenza virus infection for nearly a century [15], and has been observed during every major influenza pandemic including the pandemics of 1918 [15], 1957 [16], 1968 [17], 2009 [18]\u2013[20]. consequences to the fetus range from behavioral alterations and low birthweight, to preterm birth and spontaneous abortion [21]\u2013[24]. studies have been performed to empirically define the increased severity of influenza infections during pregnancy [14], [18], [21] for safety and ethical reasons, these studies are conducted in a setting without viral challenge. the increased mortality to influenza infection during pregnancy can be observed in mouse models [28]\u2013[31]. peak viral titers were reached in both sets of mice by 3 day post-infection (dpi) by 7 dpi, non-pregnant mice showed significantly lower pulmonary viral titers, suggesting they were able to clear virus more efficiently than their pregnant counterparts. fetuses from influenza-infected mice failed to achieve the weight of their counterparts. by E18.5 they were nearly 35% below the weight of controls. the length of gestation was also significantly impacted by infection with influenza virus. a biodegradable pellet was implanted beneath the skin and release 17-estradiol (E2) serum levels of 17-estradiol were found to be at third trimester levels [38] through the experiment. we have previously demonstrated that E2 was at least partially responsible for the delayed viral clearance found in pregnant animals. we measured transcription of IFN and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by quantitative real-time PCR. antiviral instruction of peripheral leukocytes is important for effective control of viral infection. cytokine-mediated early immune activation is inefficient in pregnant animals. cytokine-mediated early immune activation is inefficient in pregnant animals. unaltered Kinetics of Innate Immune Cells Given the significant changes observed in early cytokine and chemokine expression, we investigated whether these changes lead to variations in migratory kinetics of early immune mediators. we did not observe any significant differences in the absolute number of cells infiltrating lung tissue during infection with X31 in pregnant mice (Figure 5A) we found strongly reduced levels of CD86 expression on CD11c+ cells at critical early time points after infection in both pregnancy and estrogen-treatment. the maturation state of DCs at these time points is a critical junction bridging innate and adaptive immunity. the adaptive immune response is critical for efficient clearance of viral infection. target cells were injected at 8dpi and analysis followed 16\u201318h later. percentage of CD8+ CD3+ T cells in the lung expressing high levels of Granzyme B or (E) IFN- were calculated in X31 infection. at 4dpi, we analyzed draining lymph nodes for CFSE dilution and found fewer CD8 T cells proliferating in estrogen-treated mice. the total number of CD8 T cells is not significant reduced in the draining lymph node. this likely reflects the large number of T cells present in a lymphoid tissue. data suggest two mechanisms of cytotoxic T cell deficiency. the first involves delayed proliferation and migration of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells to the lung. the second involves a functional effect of estrogen treatment that occurs after activation of T cells. iters were measured in pregnant and non-pregnant mice following an infection with aerosolized X31. weight gain resulting from pregnancy outpaced any potential weight loss incurred during infection. this weight loss was delayed by approximately 2 days when compared to the weight loss of non-pregnant controls. pregnant mice have an impaired ability to control influenza virus infection in both lethal and non-lethal models. despite significant morbidity associated with fetal gestation, pregnant mice have an impaired ability to control influenza virus infection. elleted mice continued to lose weight throughout the latter part of infection. we found more significant weight loss in non-pregnant controls. x31 virus analysed viral clearance in both groups. spleenocytes were pretreated for 18h with 10g/mL 17-estradiol. they were directly stimulated with 1000U/mL of murine IFN for 6h. bars represent mean of 3 samples +/ SD. *p0.05. we repeated the experiment using our estrogen model. bars represent mean of 3 samples +/ SD. *p0.05, ** p0.01, ***p0.001. both models establish a significant anti-inflammatory environment. CD86 expression was determined on CD11c+ DCs in the mediastinal lymph node at 3 days post infection in pregnant and (D) estrogen-treated mice. representative histograms are shown. bars represent mean of 3 mice +/ SD *p0.05. significant reductions in antigen-specific cytotoxicity in pregnant and estrogen-treated mice. differences represent delays in the ability of pregnant and E2-treated mice to clear antigen specific targets. target cells were injected at 8dpi and analysis followed 16\u201318h later. despite the fact that more virus is present in E2-pelleted mice at 7dpi, we found significant reductions in granzyme B production by intracellular cytokine staining. we also measured IFN- production, a common measure of T cell activation. these results suggest that while strongly reduced Granzyme B levels were equivalent in both placebo and estrogen treatment. a single 100g dose of E2 was administered to infected mice 6h prior to adoptive transfer of target cells. this dose was sufficient to partially replicate the defect in cytotoxicity observed in E2 mice. the second involves a functional effect of estrogen treatment that occurs after activation of T cells. high-dose estrogen treatment has been used to alleviate symptoms in models of rheumatoid arthritis [34], [49] and multiple sclerosis [32], [33], [50] in response to clinical observations showing a reduction of symptoms in pregnant women with these diseases. high levels of estrogen have been associated with an anti-inflammatory phenotype, including in the context of influenza virus infection. mouse models of influenza virus infection during pregnancy often rely on a high dose intranasal inoculum of pathogenic virus strains such as the 2009 Pandemic H1N1 strain. cytokine phenotypes have been reported in these models, and delays in viral clearance are often not supported. pregnancy presents additional layers of complexity in cytokine regulation. over-expression of several regulated cytokines has been associated with morbidities in influenza infection [52], and spontaneous pregnancy loss [56], [64]. type-I IFNs play a critical role in early immune responses to influenza. impairment of this pathway during pregnancy implicates a significant alteration in the response to virus. we did not find any evidence that estrogen treatment interfered with downstream signaling pathways. significant estrogen-associated delays in CD8 T cell proliferation in the lymph node at 4dpi and significantly reduced numbers of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells in the lung and lymph node at 7dpi. the timing of this observation is critical because the observed phenotype results in delays in CD8 T cell recruitment to the lung. early recruitment of leukocytes is equivalent and early viral titers are controlled equally well in pregnant and wild type mice. early recruitment of leukocytes is equivalent and early viral titers are controlled equally well in pregnant and wild type mice. animal work was conducted in accordance with approved protocols by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) the program is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment & Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC) titers were determined by tissue culture infectivity assay (TCID50) as previously described. lungs were extracted and homogenized in PBS-gelatin (0.1%) and frozen in dry ice-ethanol for storage at 80\u00b0C.
