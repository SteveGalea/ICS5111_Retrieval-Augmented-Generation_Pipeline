{"summary": "complex array of oligosaccharides (glycans) are attached to membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. they are involved in the initial interactions of viruses or other pathogens with cells or mucosal surfaces. the chemical diversity of these glycans contributes to their complex functional roles in controlling cell-cell, cell-pathogen, and cell-environment interactions. recombinant sialoglycan-recognizing probes (SGRPs) recognizing different O-acetylated Sia forms allows their display at the cellular and tissue levels to be analyzed in more detail. the 9-O-acetyl-modified Sias have been detected in human and some other animal tissues with influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) proteins. modified 4-O-Ac Sias appear to be distributed in fewer species than the O-acetyl modifications on the Sia glycerol side chain. they act as functional receptors for influenza virus infection as they are recognized and bound by the HA. modified Sias have been reported to affect influenza virus infections by altering the activities of HA and NA. the 9-O-Ac Sias were also reported to reduce the sialidase activity of NA by almost 3-fold (39). a number of inhibitors of influenza viruses were identified historically. pathogens and commensals bind to Sia and often express sialidases (neuramindases) that cleave it from glycans. an acetylesterase (NanS) is encoded within the Sia operon to remove human 9-O-Ac modifications and improve NanH sialidase function (54). understanding the differences in the display and cell or tissue distribution of these modified Sia forms between various animals would therefore be of general interest mouse hepatitis virus S strain (MHV-S) HE recognizes 4-O-Ac Sia, bovine coronavirus Mebus strain (BCoV-Mebus) HE primarily recognizes 7,9-O-Ac Sia, and porcine Torovirus P4 strain (PToV-P4) HE recognizes 9-O-Ac Sia. proteins are fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 and to a hex the use of solutions at pH 6.5 during esterase treatments prevents O-acetyl migration on the Sia glycerol side chain. esterase controls performed alternatively at pH 7.5 confirmed previous findings of BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc binding to 7,9-O-Ac Sias present in bovine mucin. the sia of that serum did not react with the probes on tissue slides or in testing performed by spLBA. the binding specificity of the probes was tested on a glycan microarray containing Neu4,5Ac2 (n = 1), Neu5,9Ac2 (n = 20), and Neu5Gc9Ac (n = 1). both PToV-P4 HE-Fc and BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc bind specifically to 9-O-Ac sialic acids. the 4-O-Ac Sias were found in cultured cells derived from horses. between 10% and 30% of the cells showed positive staining results. the 4-O-Ac Sias were not detected on the human (HEK-293, A549) or canine (MDCK) cells examined. the 9-O-Ac and 7,9-O-Ac Sias were widely but variably displayed on cells from different hosts. the specificity of the SGRPs for their modified Sia target on cells was confirmed by 9-O-acetylesterase-active treatment of MDCK cells prior to PToV HE-Fc probing. mice displayed 9-O-Ac (and 7,9-O-Ac) Sias in the trachea, often in the submucosal glands but also at some tracheal epithelium, and in the lung at pneumocytes of alveolar tissue. lectin stains identified limited 2-6-linked Sias (SNA), with more-robust staining for 2-3-linked Sias (MAH) being particularly abundant in the the MHV-S HE-Fc SGRP showed a widespread display of 4-O-Ac Sias in the tracheal and lung tissues of horses and guinea pigs. in horses, the 4-O-Ac Sia was displayed in the airway-exposed respiratory cells, including tracheal epithelia and alveolar pneumocytes. the distribution of 9- and 7,9-O-acetyl Sias in mammalian influenza virus host respiratory tissues appeared to contain no 4-O-Ac Sias. we probed respiratory tissues using PToV-P4 HE-Fc. the 7,9- and 9-O-Ac Sias were present in tissues of all mammals screened here. the 9-O-Ac and 7,9-O-Ac Sias generally appeared to have similar patterns of distribution. human tissues displayed 7,9- and 9-O-Ac Sias in the tracheal submucosal glands and throughout the lung. tracheal epithelium of dogs was enriched for 2-3-linked Sias. human tissues show abundant staining at the tracheal epithelium. ferret tissues display large amounts of 2-6-linked Sias in the submucosal glands and lung. enteric ganglia displayed 7,9- and 9-O-Ac Sias within the cloaca. an additional reported site of influenza replication, the pancreas, was screened. lectin staining (SNA, MAH) confirmed the abundant presence of Sias. Embryonated chicken eggs are used for the amplification of influenza viruses. they have been shown to display primarily 2-3-linked Sias. a solid-phase assay performed on allantoic fluid extracted from the eggs failed to identify any O-acetylated Sias. recombinant soluble HE proteins from three nidoviruses were used as SGRPs. hexahistidine (His6) sequence was fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 and to a hexahistidine (His6) sequence. proteins contained N-linked (but not O-linked) glycans. spLBA tested the specificities of the SGRPs in a solid-phase lectin binding assay (spLBA) with either horse serum proteins (displaying 4-O-Ac Sias) or bovine submaxilliary gland mucin (7,9-O-Ac Sias and 9-O-Ac Sias). the use of solutions at pH 6.5 during esterase treatments prevents O-acetyl migration on the Sia gly Nidovirus HE ectodomains were expressed with a C-terminal tag of the human IgG Fc domain and a 6-His sequence. MHV-S HE-Fc treated with various glycosidases and resolved on SDS-PAGE shows presence of N-linked (but not O-linked) glycosylation. glycan microarray results correlated with our spLBA observations. binding is presented in heat map form. cell lines of human (HEK-293, A549), canine (MDCK) and equine (NBL-6) origin were screened with the SGRPs for the display of O-acetyl modified Sias. the display of 4-O-Ac Sias was isolated to horse origin NBL-6 cells. all screened cells displayed 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac Sias intracellularly. cellular localization of 9-O-Ac Sias in human cells has been previously described. a horse cell line (NBL-6) displayed both 7,9- and 9-O-Ac Sias. the distribution of Sias in mouse respiratory tissues has been previously described. mice were highly enriched in 9-O-Ac (and 7,9-O-Ac) Sias. the 3-O-Ac Sias are enriched in the mouse lung. the 4-O-Ac Sia was displayed in the airway-exposed respiratory cells. 4-O-Ac Sias were predominately found in the respiratory tissues of horses and guinea pigs. trace signal was seen in ferret and dog tissues. human and pig tissues appeared to contain no 4-O-Ac Sias. 7,9- and 9-O-Ac Sias were displayed in the tracheal epithelia of pigs, horses, and dogs. overall, 7,9- and 9-O-Ac Sias appeared most abundant within the respiratory tissues of humans. both sia forms were identified in respiratory tissues of all species examined. Ferrets displayed more 2-6-linked Sias in the lung and in the submucosal glands of the trachea. pigs displayed both Sia linkages, though 2-3-linked Sias were more likely to be detected at the tracheal epithelium. horses showed fairly equivalent levels of both Sia linkages in the respiratory tissues examined here. 9-O-Ac Sias were detected on the tracheal epithelia and within the lung pneumocytes in parallel to the 4-O-Ac. in the intestines and colon, enteric ganglia displayed 7,9- and 9-O-Ac Sia forms. an additional reported site of influenza replication, the pancreas, was screened with no display observed. both 4-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac Sias are displayed in enteric ganglia of the intestines. epithelial cells of the cloaca display abundant mono-9-O-Ac Sias. Embryonated chicken eggs are used for the amplification of influenza viruses. staining with lectins for Sia linkage largely confirmed the significant presence of 2-3-linked Sias (MAH) in both the embryo and CAM. only mono-9-O-Ac Sias were detected in embryonic tissue and on CAM. our findings in this study are summarized in Table 1. TABLE 1. Summary of results of survey of influenza virus hosts for presence of varied Sia formsa Host 4-O-Ac (MHV) 9-O-Ac (PToV) 7,9-O-Ac (BCoV) 2-6 (SNA) 2-3 (MAH) Mouse, BL6 + ++ ++ + ++ Human ++ + ++ + Ferret +/ + ++ Guinea pig ++ +/ + guinea pigs and horses at high levels, as was likely based on previous reports of the presence of modified Sias on eyrthrocytes and blood proteins from those hosts. previous reports showed that 4-O-Ac Sias in mice are highly tissue regulated and most abundantly found in the gastrointestinal tract. horses and guinea pig sera have long been known to be potent inhibitors of several H2 and H3 human influenza strains. resistance to those sera could be selected through mutations in the HA at residue 145 (H3) that ablate 4-O-Ac binding (61) the presence of various amounts of sialidase-resistant Sias may therefore contribute to selection of influenza virus populations with HA variants. 9-O-Ac Sias are the primary receptor for influenza C viruses. their expression in the respiratory tissues of humans and on chicken egg membranes allows infection by that virus (69) however, the 9-O-Ac group may block binding of some viruses, including strains of influenza A virus. genetic manipulation of expression in cells will allow testing of the functional effects of the modification. the modified Sias may further impact influenza viruses at the population level, selecting for HA variants of Sia-binding avidity. the nonmodified forms or of other multiply modified forms would require either the use of SGRPs that recognize only the nonmodified forms or HPLC analysis of tissue lysates for the presence of modified Sias. previous HPLC analysis has allowed quantification of the ratios of the modified to unmodified Sias. the presence of 4-O-Ac Sias in horses and guinea pigs is of interest. horses have been the natural host of the H7N7 influenza virus. guinea pigs are naturally infected by and transmit many strains of human influenza virus. be potent inhibitors of several H2 and H3 human influenza strains. resistance to those sera could be selected through mutations in the HA at residue 145 (H3) that ablate 4-O-Ac binding. presence of various amounts of sialidase-resistant Sias may therefore contribute to selection of influenza virus populations with HA variants. the presence of 9-O-Ac Sias in the submucosal glands of the human trachea suggests that they would be displayed in mucus as part of the biophysical barrier to influenza virus contacting epithelial cell receptors. the animal with the distribution of 9-O-Ac Sias that most closely mirrored that of humans was the mouse. the modified Sias may further impact influenza viruses at the population level. the modified Sias are present at high levels in many natural influenza virus hosts. CMAH has been independently lost by mutation in several influenza virus hosts. guinea pig liver tissue shows reduced or blocked Sia binding when the 9-O-Ac modification is present. previous HPLC analysis has allowed quantification of the ratios of the modified to unmodified Sias. human tissue samples are exempt from Institutional Review Board review. expression and isolation of HE-Fc viral SGRPs. sequences for expressing the ectodomains of the hemagglutinin-esterase.
