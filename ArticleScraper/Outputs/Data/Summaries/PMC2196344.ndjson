{"summary": "FITC, phycoerythrin or tricolor conjugated rat monoclonal antibodies against murine CD4 and CD8 were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) all studies were done with freshly isolated cells from 6\u20138 wk-old B10.A mice. soluble chimeric protein CHE-Fc was generated by treating CHE-Fc with 1 mM DFP to inactivate the esterase activity as described (3). CHE-Fc specifically releases 9-O-acetyl esters from Sias (i.e., it functions as an esterase), while CHE-FcD specifically recognizes and binds to 9-O-acetylated Sias (3). the CHE-FcD + anti-human IgG Fc immunocomplex was allowed to bind to the cells for 2 h on ice. for all double and triple-color stainings, the CHE-Fc was allowed to bind to the cells before staining with the remaining antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. the CHE-Fc was used under identical conditions as a negative control for CHE-FcD binding. fresh mouse lymphocytes from either spleen or lymph nodes were prepared. cells were stained with rat anti\u2013mouse CD4 conjugated with magnetic beads. the purity of the sorted population, confirmed by flow cytometry, was 90%. CHE-FcD probe in amounts ranging from 0.5 to 3 g was allowed to bind overnight at 4\u00b0C on to Staph protein A\u2013coated 96-well plates. 0.5 106 lymphocytes from peripheral lymph nodes were then incubated with 200 l of EHAA growth medium per coated well. CHE-Fc or CHE-FcD (50 g/ml final) was used in combination with the varying amounts of PMA or anti-CD3. cells were incubated for 4 d before being pulsed with 1 Ci/well of [3H]thymidine. radioactivity quantitated as described earlier. to purify gangliosides, the washed cell pellets were sequentially extracted by 10\u201320 vol CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 vol/vol) the extracts were pooled, dried down, and brought up in CHCl3/MeOH/water in the ratio of 4:8:5.6. after phase separation, the gangliosides were enriched in the hydophilic upper phase. electrophoresed material was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in 1 TBS for 2 h. biotinylated monoclonals S7 (anti-CD43 115-kD isoform) and 23G2 (anti-CD45RB) were used at a concentration of 1 g/ml in 1X TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. 75 g of CHE-FcD was allowed to complex with 50 l of protein A\u2013sepharose by end over end rolling at 4\u00b0C for the same length of time. the whole mixture was then incubated overnight with the precleared sample in a volume of 500 l with end over end rolling at 4\u00b0C for the same length of time. the beads were spun, washed in TBS, pH 7.4 and 6.8, successively and boiled in SDS sample buffer with the anti CD45RB monoclonal antibody recognized the 115-kD isoform of CD43. the 23G2 clone was used in all FACS\u00ae staining and Western blots. the anti-mouse CD3 hamster hybridoma 2C11 was prepared in ascites form. freshly obtained live cells from B10.A mouse thymus, lymph nodes and spleen were prepared after hypotonic lysis of RBCs and 1 106 cells were washed and suspended in ice cold PBS. the CHE-FcD probe was allowed to bind to the cells after being immunocomplexed with FITC or phycoerythrin conjugated goat anti\u2013 human secondary antibody. psin with 0.5 mM EDTA in Hank's balanced salt solution for 1 h in a 37\u00b0C water bath, then washed twice with cold PBS before staining. cells were then washed twice with cold PBS before staining. the loss of anti-CD4 binding was used to confirm trypsin activity. total lymph node cells or 0.5 106 CD4 T cells from mouse lymph nodes were activated in EHAA medium (from GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) at 37\u00b0C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in the presence of 2 ng per ml of PMA. incorporated radioactivity was determined on a betaplate reader (Wallac 1205; Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) cross-linking with 2C11 was done as a positive control. CHE-FcD was allowed to bind to CD4 cells in solution without cross-linking its ligands. the cells were washed with 1 PBS three times followed by hypotonic lysis. they were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation and spun at 500 g at 4\u00b0C. the cloudy supernatant was then spun at 100,000 g at 4\u00b0C to obtain a total membrane pellet. the membranes were then extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in 1 Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0 (TBS), separated from the membrane debris by recent the effects of base (de-O-acetylation) on reactivity were assessed by treatment with 0.1 M NaOH at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. after treatment, the plates were extensively washed with PBS, blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated with CHE-FcD (20 g/ml) for 2 h. goat anti\u2013human Fc conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. reaction was allowed to progress for 5\u201315 min before washing with water. 75 g of CHE-FcD was allowed to complex with 50 l of protein A\u2013sepharose by end over end rolling at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. Flow cytometry analysis of dispersed thymocytes showed that 8\u201310% have surface 9-O-acetylation. positively staining cells are very heterogenous with respect to their degree of 9-O-acetylation. one aliquot was pretreated with CHE-Fc to remove 9-O-acetyl groups. the dashed line indicates the background level of staining with the secondary antibody alone. quadrant boundaries were determined based on background staining profiles seen with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti\u2013human IgG. 9-O-acetylation is present on 75% of all the CD4+ SP cells, 40% of the DN cells and only 8% of CD8+ SP cells. the lowest amount of 9-O-acetylation was seen in the CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes (1\u20132%) progressive increase in 9-O-acetylation during maturation of CD4+ cells. individual gates delineate cells with progressing maturity from the CD4CD8 DN to the CD4+CD8+ DP stage to the CD4+CD8 and CD8+ SP stages. 100,000 total events were acquired so significant number of cells within the indicated regions could be gated. 9-O-acetyl+ cells have a CD5hi phenotype. the 9-O-acetyl+ cells are most likely the transitional cells. the 9-O-acetyl+ cells appear to be equally divided with respect to CD69 expression. Varying levels of 9-O-acetylation were found on lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes. in different preparations from spleen and lymph nodes the percentage of 9-O-acetylated CD4 T cells varied from 85\u201390%. trypsinization of thymocytes caused partial loss of 9-O-acetylation in most of the positive cells. most glycoproteins are expected to be trypsin sensitive, while the trypsin-resistant 9-O-acetylated glycoconjugates are likely to be sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides) CD4+ SP thymocytes were treated with trypsin or OSGPase. after OSGPase treatment, CD4+ SP cells were gated on a CD4/CD8 plot to examine the CHE-FcD staining profile. similar trypsin and OSGPase treatments done on purified peripheral CD4 T cells from the spleen and lymph nodes also indicates that most of the 9-O-acetylated glycoprotein almost all CD4 cells that have 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins may also have 9-O-acetylated gangliosides. the molecule was preserved after protease treatment with OSGPase. this provides an internal control for the selectivity of the enzyme in cleaving only mucintype proteins with many clustered sialylated O-linked chains. this antibody was also unable to bind to mouse thymocytes and peripheral CD4 T cells. there is also no correlation between 9-O-acetylation and the presence or absence of epitopes recognized by antibody SM3G11 (35, 36), which is known to detect the mouse T cell ganglioside GD1c. these data suggest that certain gangliosides on murine CD4 cells constitute a significant proportion of total 9-O-acety 9-O-acetylation is lost on mucin-type proteins, but not on gangliosides. this is confirmed by direct analysis of gangliosides from activated cells. there was no correlation of 9-O-acetylation with expression of CD69, CD25, CD45R(exonB), Mel14 or Pgp1 on any of the days after activation. however, 9-O-acetylation of gangliosides persist soluble CHE-FcD in concentrations up to 50 g/ml neither potentiates nor inhibits T cell activation mediated either by PMA or by anti-CD3. the experiment was done over a range showing a typical dose response relationship to the stimulating agent to see if there are noticeable differences at submaximal doses of PMA or anti-CD3. removal of the sialomucins by OSGPase actually gives an increase in CHE-FcD binding to CD8 T cells. the same result was confirmed by treating cells with trypsin or by a combination of trypsin followed by OSGPase. this pattern of increased CHE-FcD binding after trypsin or OSGPase treatment was also reproduced on CD8 SP thymocytes. CD43 and CD45 are two major, well-characterized T cell surface glycoproteins known to carry large amounts of O-linked oligosaccharides with terminal sialic acids. both thymic and peripheral T cells express high molecular weight isoforms of CD45. the 23G2 clone had shown better binding on splenic CD4 T cells (41). anti-CD43 and anti-CD45RB antibodies treated with or without OSGPase. expression of these cell surface glycoproteins showed higher levels of CD43 and CD45R(exonB) containing isoforms on CD8 cells than on CD4 cells. this observation is consistent with earlier results using the same anti-CD43 S7 clone (43) and anti-CD45RB (41). the CHE-FcD probe reveals several high molecular mass proteins. the specificity of recognition is confirmed by the absence of any binding with the CHE-Fc at similar concentration. pre-incubation of the proteins with OSGPase destroys all the positive bands. two of the major bands coincided in molecular mass with that expected for CD45RB and CD43. CD43 and CD45R (exonB) are among the 9-O-acetylated membrane mucins in splenic cells. it is evident from these data that CD43 and CD45(exonB) are among the cell surface mucins that are 9-O-acetylated. this may be due to the fact that only a single round of depletion was done. 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids mask binding of recombinant soluble CD22 (CD22Rg) to its ligands on some cells in murine lymphoid organs. treatment with CHE-Fc did not significantly increase binding of CD22Rg to either mature peripheral CD4 cells or to CD4+ SP thymocytes. this result is consistent with fact that most of the 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins on CD binding with CHE-FcD was substantially abrogated when cells were treated with CHE-Fc esterase before staining. thymocytes were stained with CHE-FcD followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti\u2013human IgG. 9-O-acetylation is present on 75% of all the CD4+ SP cells, 40% of the DN cells and only 8% of CD8+ SP cells. the lowest amount of 9-O-acetylation was seen in the CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes. cells in the CD4+ SP subset varied in levels of 9-O-acetylation. these levels correlated inversely with CD8 levels. three-color flow cytometry was done after staining with CHE-FcD, anti-CD4 and anti-CD8. ly gated to study the relationship of 9-O-acetylation with other well defined traits that mark the progression of cells from DP to CD4+CD8 stage. thymocyte maturation to a CD4+ SP stage occurs with upregulation of CD5 and CD69, both of which are responsive to signals delivered through the TCR during positive selection. anti-CD3 mAb 2C11 was detected using phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti\u2013hamster IgG. anti-CD69 and anti-CD5 were directly conjugated to FITC and anti-CD4 to tricolor reagent. only CD4+ thymocytes were gated to show dot plots relating 9-O-acetylation with other thymocyte markers. Flow cytometry was done after three color staining using anti-CD4 and CHE-FcD along with anti-Mel14, anti-Pgp1 or anti-CD45R(exonB) all peripheral T cell markers were used as biotinylated antibodies. the data displayed here represents only CD4+ gated cells. thymocytes were treated with trypsin or OSGPase. thymocytes were treated with trypsin or OSGPase. they were then washed before staining. thymocytes were treated with trypsin or OSGPase. cells were activated by cross-linking with anti-CD3 on a 96-well plate. the profiles displayed in the right panels represent gated CD4 cells from the third day after activation. similar trypsin and OSGPase treatments done on purified peripheral CD4 T cells from the spleen and lymph nodes also indicates that most of the 9-O-acetylated glycoproteins are of the O-linked mucin-type. however, there is also 9-O-acetylated gangliosides are present in purified lipid extracts from CD4 cells. this molecule was not detectable on mouse thymocytes or on mouse peripheral CD4 T cells using both JONES and 27A antibodies. this antibody was also unable to bind to mouse thymocytes and peripheral CD4 T cells. binding was detected with HRPO-conjugated second antibody and substrate. results shown are mean values from triplicates. effect of CD4 Cell Activation on cell surface 9-O-Acetylation. soluble CHE-FcD in concentrations up to 50 g/ml neither potentiates nor inhibits T cell activation mediated either by PMA or by anti-CD3. soluble CHE-FcD in concentrations up to 50 g/ml does not inhibit T cell activation mediated either by PMA or by cross-linking with anti-CD3 antibodies. sialomucins on CD8 T cells are not 9-O-Acetylated, but they mask Recognition of 9-O-Acetylated Gangliosides by CHE-FcD. the level of 9-O-acetylation detected on mature CD8 T cells was considerably lower than on CD4 T cells. removal of the sialomucins by OSGPase actually gives an increase in CHE-FcD binding to CD8 T sialomucins on CD8 T cells can mask the recognition of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides. mice spleen cells were stained with CHE-FcD before or after OSGPase or trypsin treatment. staining profiles were traced from gated CD4 and CD8 subpopulations. 45, and the exon 5 (coding for RB) specified isoforms are relatively predominant as compared to RA and RC specified isoforms (41, 42). since these were the cells we were focused on, we chose this antibody for all FACS\u00ae and Western blot studies. this antibody would be specific to only a major subset of all CD45 isoforms. this was further confirmed by Western blot analysis of T cell membrane protein extracts treated with or without OSGPa alomucin 9-O-acetylation is not due to differences in expression of the parent molecules between CD4 and CD8 cells. freshly isolated mouse splenic lymphocytes were incubated with OSGPase or with buffer alone, under identical conditions. this was followed by three-color staining with anti-CD4, CD8 and either anti-CD43 (S7) or CD45RB (23G2) at dilutions of 5 g/ml. Fig. 12 demonstrates that the proteins precipitated by CHE-FcD include molecules recognized by anti-CD43 and anti-CD45RB, that comigrate at the same position with bands from total membrane proteins recognized by the same antibodies. the weaker intensity of the bands reflects the lower amounts of CD43 and CD45 present in the immunoprecipitates. this might be due to differential mobilities of different CD43 glycoforms (43) the right panel shows a Western blot of total membrane proteins, proteins precipitated by CHE-FcD, and CHE-Fc controls. each probed with antiCD43 and anti-CD45RB monoclonal antibodies as indicated. the expected positions of CD45RB (190 kD) and CD43 (115 kD) are indicated in each panel. sialic acids with different -ketosidic linkages from the 2- position to the underlying glycoconjugate can confer a fair degree of diversity. modifications of the sialic acids enhance this diversity further. this approach is limited by the purity and stability of the virus preparations. the availability of a soluble recombinant chimera (CHEFcD) derived from influenza C makes it possible to look for 9-Oacetylation on cell surfaces. we have studied the cell surface expression of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on intact fresh lymphocytes isolated from normal mice. 9-O-acetylated sialic acids detected by CHEFcD are shown as low (lo), intermediate (int) and high (hi), along with a representative percentage of positive cells. phenotype of cells that actually progress to a DP stage is not defined by current data. mucin 9-O-acetylation as thymocytes mature to CD4+CD8 stage from the DP stage establishes this as a novel marker identifying cells committed to the CD4 lineage. a significant fraction of cells with high 9-O-acetylation that must be CD4+ SP cells seem to have lost their CD69 expression, which fits in with their expected downregulation on mature SP thymocytes. OSGPase recognizes sialylated clustered glycans and cleaves the adjacent polypeptide backbone. it is unclear if the increase in CD4+ cell 9-O-acetylation occurs at a peripheral location after emigration from the thymus. more than 95% of the naive CD4 T cells and only 60% of the cells with a memory/activated phenotype are 9-O-acetylated. this could be relevant either to the specific recirculation patterns of these cells in the mouse and/or recognition of some costimulatory molecule involved in T cell activation. there is a substantial decrease in the mean density of 9-O-acetylation on activated cells. there is no significant difference in the percentage of cells that are 9-O-acetylated. the presence of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides in the resting and activated cells was confirmed in an ELISA using the CHE-FcD. recognition of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides on resting CD4 cells could be of some relevance to their biology. a masking phenomenon in vivo could be of some relevance to their biology. CD43 (leukosialin) is a major cell surface glycoprotein on T cells. it is also present on cells of erythroid and myeloid lineages. differences in expression of its two major glycoforms 115 and 130-kD species, have been shown between CD4 and CD8 T cells. 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids has been studied by others in human lymphoid tissue. human peripheral blood T lymphocytes are also positive for the marker CD60. this antibody binds to 25% of normal circulating human lymphocytes. trisaccharide with GD3 has been identified by mAbs 3G11 and YK-3 (73) on mouse T cells with a preference for cells with a Th1 phenotype (73). it is possible that this structure is the functional homologue of GD3 seen on human peripheral T cells. however, there is no antibody currently available against 9-O-acetylated GD1c. a specific mAb directed against the 9-OAc-gangliosides would be needed. a specific mAb directed against the 9-OAc-gangliosides in murine T cells would be needed to make a valid comparison with CD60 activation in human T cells."}
