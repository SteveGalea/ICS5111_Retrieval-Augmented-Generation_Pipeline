{"summary": "hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family (5). the virion contains a single copy of viral genomic DNA in a relaxed open circular (RC) form (2, 5\u20139) the virus is endocytosed into the cell and the viral RC DNA is transported into the nucleus to form the episomal covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form of the genome. type I interferon (interferon alpha/beta [IFN-/] is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that plays a pivotal role in the innate defense against viral infection. the virus is vulnerable to artificially activated intrahepatic innate immune responses or IFN- treatment (15\u201324). STAT pathways to induce an array of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) which manipulate cellular functions or directly target viral components to restrict virus infection and propagation. a few ISGs have been identified to possess specific antiviral mechanisms against HBV replication in cell cultures. tetherin (also known as BST2, CD317, and HM1.24) is a small transmembrane protein that physically tethers enveloped viruses at the virus budding site to prevent virion release from infected cells. it was first reported to be a host antiretroviral factor that impedes the departure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 progeny virions from the cell surface in the absence of the viral accessory protein Vpu. IFN- or IFN- treatment of HepAD38 cells with established HBV replication reduced virion secretion without inhibiting intracellular viral replication. expression of tetherin alone in HepAD38 cells demonstrated the same selective inhibition of HBV virion egress as did IFN. penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 1 g/ml tetracycline were withdrawn from the culture medium. tetracycline was withdrawn from the culture medium, and the cells were cultured for the indicated time periods. cells were incubated with 2 ml of Opti-MEM containing pseudotyped control retroviruses, wild-type tetherin-expressing retroviruses, or tetherin-C19-expressing retroviruses. cells were then pooled and expanded into cell lines designated HepAD38-control, HepAD38-tetherin, and HepAD38-TC19 respectively. the knockdown level of tetherin in HepAD38-tetherin_K.D cells upon IFN- treatment was confirmed by Western blotting. total cellular RNA was resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred onto a Hybond-XL membrane. DNA was resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel. the gel was then subjected to denaturation in a solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl. the gel was then subjected to neutralization in a buffer containing 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1.5 M NaCl. the membrane was exposed to a phosphorimager screen. membranes were blocked with a monoclonal antibody against HBV surface antigen (catalog number N1597; Dako), with polyclonal antibodies against HBV core protein (catalog number B0586; Dako), or with tetherin antibodies (catalog number 13560-1-AP; Proteintech) cells were lysed in 150 l of 1 Laemmli buffer and denatured at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. proteins were transferred onto an immobilon FL membrane (Millipore) membranes were blocked with WesternBreeze Blocker and probed with antibodies against the FLAG tag. the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, air dried, and dissolved in nuclease-free water. cell nuclei were stained with the corresponding Alexa Fluor 405 and 594 dye-conjugated secondary antibodies. the cells were washed with PBS and then subjected to confocal microscopy analysis under an Olympus FV1000MPE microscope with a 60 objective. cells were fixed in modified Karnovsky's fixative, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through a graded series of ethyl alcohol from 70% to 100%. plasmid pCDNA5-BST2 cloned into pQCXIP vector. 1 106 GP2-293 cells were cotransfected with 1 g of pCMV-VSV-G, 1.5 g of pCDNA3-HIV1-vpu. the culture supernatant was harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection. ted with 2 ml of Opti-MEM containing pseudotyped control retroviruses, wild-type tetherin-expressing retroviruses, or tetherin-C19-expressing retroviruses. cells were cultured in DMEM\u2013F-12 medium containing puromycin (3 g/ml) and tetracycline (1 g/ml) for 2 weeks. antibiotic-resistant cells were then pooled and expanded into cell lines. total cellular RNA was resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel. the gel was then subjected to denaturation in a solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl, followed by neutralization in a buffer containing 1 M Tris-HCl and 1.5 M NaCl. membranes were probed with an [-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer)-labeled plus- or minus-strand-specific full-length HBV riboprobe. the membrane was exposed to a phosphorimager screen. bound antibodies were revealed by using IRDye secondary antibodies (Li-Cor) and visualized by using the Li-Cor Odyssey system. for the detection of HBV DNA, the DNA-containing particles on the membrane were denatured with a solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl. 50 microliters of the cell lysate was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. proteins were transferred onto an immobilon FL membrane (Millipore) membranes were blocked with WesternBreeze Blocker and probed with antibodies against the FLAG tag (clone M2) amplification settings included 0.8 M primers and 0.2 M probe, annealing, and extension at 64\u00b0C for 45 cycles. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. fixative (2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) dehydrated through graded series of ethyl alcohol. ultrathin sections (80 nm) were cut with an ultramicrotome and stained with the heavy metal uranyl acetate. delayed IFN treatment after 6 days of HBV induction did not alter steady-state levels of HBV RNA and DNA in HepAD38 cells. but significantly reduced the accumulation of HBV virion particles in the culture supernatant (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 to 6) group 1 was mock treated or treated with IFN- (1,000 IU/ml) or IFN- (100 ng/ml) simultaneously with tetracycline withdrawal (tet) for 6 days. another group of cells received interferon treatment after 6 days of HBV induction. we have developed an assay in which IFN fails to block intracellular HBV de novo synthesis but is still able to inhibit virion egress. we have also observed the same phenomenon in another HBV-inducible stable cell line, HepDE19 (data not shown) however, the mechanisms underlying the resistance of viral DNA replication to IFN treatment under conditions of established HBV replication await further investigations. interferon induces tetherin expression in primary human hepatocytes. PHHs were cultured in a 12-well plate and treated with IFN- (1,000 IU/ml), IFN- (100 ng/ml) or IFN- (100 ng/ml) 19 tetherin did not affect intracellular HBV core expression, capsid formation, or DNA replication. interferon-inducible tetherin mimics antiviral activity of interferons against HBV virion secretion. interferon inhibits HBV virion secretion through the induction of tetherin. TC19 exhibits dominant negative activity and attenuates IFN-mediated inhibition of HBV virion secretion. this is consistent with a previous report that the C-terminal 19-aa GPI anchor is functionally indispensable for the antiviral activity of tetherin against HIV-1 egress. we treated HepAD38-control and HepAD38-TC19 cells with IFN. tetherin tethers HBV through incorporation into virions. tetherin tethers homodimers in parallel orientation by intermolecular disulfide bonds between the coiled-coil ectodomains. retrovirus-transduced cell lines HepAD38-control, HepAD38-TC19, and HepAD38-tetherin produced the same amounts of enveloped HBV particles in the absence of tetracycline (mainly subviral particles) when the particle gel was stained with antibodies against tetherin, the viral particles liberated from HepAD38-TC19 cells displayed a strong tetherin signal, indicating that TC19 is associated with the enveloped viral particles. a weak signal for tetherin was detected on the HBV particle gel samples from HepAD38-control and HepAD38-TC19 cells. the signal remained present in samples from the same cell lines cultured in the presence of tetracycline. however, when the enveloped HBV particles were purified by immunoprecipitation with HBsAg-specific antibodies, the signal of tetherin vanished, except for TC19 associated with HBV virions tetherin inhibits HBV virion release through blocking tetherin-dependent virion assembly and/or secretion. tetherin inhibits HBV virion release through blocking MVB-dependent virion assembly and/or secretion, which represents a novel intracellular tethering mechanism. the inset in the merged image shows the colocalization signals (yellow) at a higher magnification. the inset shows the colocalization signals (yellow) at a higher magnification. the colocalization signal (white) is further shown in the inset with an expanded view. the indicated cells were cultured in tetracycline-free medium for 10 days. ultrathin sections were prepared and negatively stained for TEM analysis. tetherin mediates the antiviral activity of IFN- against HBV virion egress. tetherin attenuates IFN-mediated suppression of HBV virion release. cells were cultured in presence of tetracycline until they became confluent. cells were untreated or treated with IFN- (1,000 IU/ml) for another 4 days. a tetracycline-inducible cell line was used to test the antiviral effect of IFN treatment on HBV DNA replication and viral particle secretion. both IFN- and IFN- posttranscriptionally inhibited HBV DNA replication when the treatment was started simultaneously with tetracycline withdrawal. delayed IFN treatment after 6 days of HBV induction did not alter steady-state levels of HBV RNA and DNA in HepAD38 cells. the reduction in accumulation of virions by IFN treatment did not change the EIA signal of total enveloped particles in the particle gel assay. the HBsAg ELISA and HBV virion DNA IP-qPCR results further confirmed that IFNs selectively inhibited HBV virion secretion but not the secretion of subviral particles. group 2 cells at endpoint of treatment were analyzed by a particle gel assay. enveloped HBV particles, including virions and subviral particles, were revealed by an EIA using HBsAb. in situ-denatured HBV virion DNA and nonenveloped capsid DNA were detected by hybridization. tetherin was induced by IFN in hepatocyte-derived cells. all three types of IFN (IFN-, -, and -) significantly upregulated tetherin expression in primary human hepatocytes. we hypothesized that the inhibition of HBV virion secretion is induced through the induction of tetherin. in order to achieve overexpression of tetherin in every HBV-replicating cell, we generated cell lines stably expressing wild-type or GPI-anchor-deleted tetherin through retroviral vector transduction of HepAD38 cells. under forced expression of tetherin, HBV expression and replication were induced in HepAD38 cells by removal of tetracycline. 38-tetherin and HepAD38-TC19 cells were cultured in complete maintenance medium until they became confluent. tetracycline was then removed from the culture medium to induce HBV DNA replication. tetherin expression, HBV core protein expression, capsid formation, and core DNA replication were analyzed. TC19 is dominant negative form of tetherin in terms of HBV inhibition. the dominant negative effect of TC19 was reported in a previous study of tetherin-mediated inhibition of HIV particle egress in the absence of Vpu. tetherin tethers HBV through incorporation through incorporation. tetherin dimer inserts one pair of membrane anchors into the virus envelope. the other pair remains embedded in the cell membrane (56) the integrity of the GPI anchor pair is essential for tetherin to inhibit HBV virion egress. culture medium of the indicated cell lines was collected between days 8 and 10 in the absence or presence of tetracycline. the blot was stained for HBsAg and tetherin by specific antibodies. a weak signal for tetherin was detected on the HBV particle gel samples. natant samples from tetherin-transfected HepG2 cells also showed tetherin signals in the absence of any HBV component. tetherin, per its reported antiviral mechanism, forms a dimer and inhibits HBV virion release. tetherin exerts a broad blocking effect against enveloped virus release, regardless of whether budding occurs at the plasma membrane or intracellular compartments (51) the association between tetherin and HBV virions in the MVB compartment was confirmed by triple staining. these data indicate that tetherin inhibits HBV virion release through blocking MVB-dependent virion assembly and/or secretion. this represents a novel intracellular tethering mechanism distinct from the reported tetherin-virus interaction on the cell surface. pAD38-TC19 cells exhibited classical intracellular budding of mature HBV virions in cytoplasmic cisternae, presumably MVBs. we did not find any HBV virion budding through the cell surface (data not shown) in HepAD38-TC19 cells expressing dominant negative tetherin, virion secretion was slightly increased, and exocytosed Dane particles were found in the extracellular space. however, in HepAD38- tetherin is an end effector of interferon-mediated suppression of HBV virion secretion. we established HepAD38-based cells with stable knockdown of tetherin by lentiviral shRNA transduction. the control knockdown cell line HepAD38-control_K.D with IFN- for an additional 4 days induced tetherin expression and reduced HBV virion production by 40%. the harvested cell and supernatant samples were analyzed for tetherin expression, HBV core DNA replication, and extracellular accumulation of particle-associated HBV DNA. the virion-associated DNA from 1 ml of the harvested supernatant was quantitated by HBsAg IP-qPCR and plotted as a percentage of the DNA signals from untreated HepAD38-control_K.D cell samples. induction of tetherin by IFN seemed to indicate that IFN signaling is, at least partially, functional to induce certain ISGs. however, such experimental conditions allow the study of IFN-mediated inhibition of HBV particle egress to become practical. we previously reported that overexpression of tetherin by transfection inhibited HBV DNA replication primarily. tetherin selectively inhibits virion egress but not release of naked capsids. tetherin selectively inhibits virion egress but not release of subviral particles and naked capsids. tetherin selectively inhibits virion egress but not release of naked capsids. tetherin colocalizes with HBV virions intracellularly at the MVB complex. but we could not detect an association between tetherin and HBV envelope proteins (L/M/S) by coimmunoprecipitation assays with cell lysates prepared by a detergent-based lysis method. tetherin is able to incorporate into HBV virions through its N-terminal TM domain, likely in a dimeric formation. the observed modest anti-HBV activity of tetherin is probably due to the possibility that HBV either is inherently unsusceptible to tetherin or has evolved countermeasures to antagonize tetherin. however, we compared expression levels of tetherin in HBV-transfected cells with those in mock-transfected cells. however, we did not observe a noticeable alteration of tetherin expression by HBV. IFN- is an approved medication for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (70). tetherin mediates the inhibition of HBV virion egress by IFN in cell cultures. tetherin could be developed into antiviral therapies to potentiate the efficacy of IFN treatment."}
