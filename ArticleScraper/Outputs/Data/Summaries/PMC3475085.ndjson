RNA was quantified by spectrometry (NanoDrop ND1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Wilminton, Delaware USA) RNA was eluted with 10 microliter of RNase-free H2O. 300 ng of purified total RNA were used to produce Cyanine 3-CTP-labeled cRNA using the Quick Amp Labeling kit. microarray data sets have been uploaded to the ArrayExpress microarray data repository. changes were verified in microarray gene expression for representative genes of our analysis by qPCR using real-time Ready plates purchased to Roche. the original data was cleansed and normalized using the robust multichip average (RMA) algorithm. acute exacerbation of COPD was defined as a patient showing 2 symptoms (at least 1 major) for 2 consecutive days. major symptoms were increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence. minor symptoms were increased cough, wheeze, sore throat, or coryzal symptoms. sputum samples were routinely Gram stained and cultured on general purpose media (blood agar, chocolate agar, and the differentials mediums McConkey agar and Chapman agar) viral diagnosis was performed on RNA from pharyngeal swabs collected in first 24 hours following admission to the hospital by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Arrays were scanned in an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent p/n 5190\u20130442) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Arrays were scanned in an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent G2565BA) following the Agilent protocol GE1-v5_95_Feb07. ingenuity pathway analysis 8.5 (IPA) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to select, annotate and visualize genes by function and pathway (gene ontology) male patients accounted for the vast majority of the cases in the non-ICU group. ICU group: A. fumigatus (n = 1); C. pneumoniae (n = 1); S. pneumoniae (n = 3); S hominis (n = 1); P aeruginosa (n = 1); S. epidermidis (n = 1). all patients were treated with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and systemic steroids. mphocytes / mm3 in blood (Mean,SD) 8249.7 964.1 0.000 (6108.6) (437.9) Neutrophils / mm3 in blood (Mean,SD) 1255.0 13301.2 0.000 (1845.8) (11858.8) Gene expression analysis T-test evidenced 1501 genes differentially expressed between ICU and non ICU patients. 92 BPI 0,018 7,06 APCS 0,046 2,88 INHBA 0,007 7,12 MEFV 0,020 2,83 CHIT1 0,009 4,19 CTSD 0,037 2,82 HP 0,037 6,71 PYDC1 0,013 2,77 PRTN3 0,030 6,33 GNAO1 0,032 2,67 AZU1 0,038 6,13 ELN 0,038 6,13 ELN 0,038 6,13 CTSG 0,034 5,71 IPA p-Value 5,66E-19 and 7,46E-18 respectively GeneSymbol Corrected p-value FCAbsolute LCN2 0,004 10,37 LTF 0,004 9,86 BPI 0,012 7,20 HP 0,015 6,71 CEACAM8 0,027 4,80 PGLYRP1 0,016 4,54 CEBPE 0,009 4,49 TCN1 0,017 3,86 RNASE2 0,007 3,69 DEFA3 0,024 3,68 CD24 genes with relative higher expression in the ICU compared to the no ICU group are depicted in red. signal intensity data are color-coded so that the intensity of red indicates a relatively high level of expression, while the intensity of blue represents a relatively low level of expression. ICU patients showed higher expression levels of 558 genes and lower expression levels of 943 than non critically ill patients. patients in the ICU group showed increased neutrophil counts in blood, but also higher levels of RNAm corresponding to a group of proteins known to participate in neutrophil-mediated antimicrobial defense. 71 MGLL 0,023 2,61 MPO 0,024 4,97 VEGFA 0,027 4,80 AKT2 0,007 2,49 PGLYRP1 0,016 4,54 GRK6 0,014 2,39 CEBPE 0,009 4,49 MAP2K3 0,045 2,37 GAST 0,020 4,09 TIMP1 0,009 2,33 PGF 0,039 4,07 ABCA7 0,007 2,32 APP 0,004 4,06 ITGAX 0,021 BPE 0,009 4,49 TCN1 0,017 3,86 RNASE2 0,007 3,69 DEFA3 0,024 3,68 CD24 0,029 3,54 S100A12 0,031 3,40 HIST1H2AC 0,011 3,04 HIST1H1C 0,010 2,90 APCS 0,046 2,88 RAB13 0,019 2,63 STXBP2 0,034 2,55 GAPDH 0,039 2,52 TIMP1 0,009 2,86 ELAN genes with relative higher expression in the ICU compared to the no ICU group are depicted in red (modified from KEGG) those with relative higher expression in the ICU compared to the no ICU group are depicted in red (modified from KEGG) the intensity of red indicates a relatively high level of expression, while blue represents a relatively low level of expression. genes ELANE (Elastase, neutrophil expressed), CTSG (cathepsin G) and PRTN3 (proteinase 3) are neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) produced during neutrophil development in bone marrow and stored in the azurophilic granules of mature neutrophils. cigarette smoke induces expression of CTSD in pulmonary macrophages. AZU1 (azurocidin 1), BPI (bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein) and alpha-defensins (defensin, alpha 3, neutrophil-specific) are as NSPs, major constituents of neutrophil azurophilic granules. the protein encoded by AZU1 is an antibiotic protein, with monocyte chemotactic and antibacterial activity. a number of other gene transcripts related to neutrophils were identified as more represented in the ICU group. the gene encodes a receptor for the Fc region of IgA. it triggers several immunologic defense processes, including phagocytosis. ic level of neutrophils ready to fight infection but also ready to produce mediators. migration of these cells from the blood vessels could certainly help clear the causative microbe, but also to damage the pulmonary parenchyma, contributing to the explanation of the severity of respiratory conditions of these patients. VEGFA (Vascular endothelial growth factor A) is a glycosylated mitogen that acts on endothelial cells. it has various effects, including mediating increased vascular permeability, inducing angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and endothelial cell growth. VEGF up-regulated in patients with acutely exacerbated COPD and decrease after recovery from exacerbation. the presence of increased nitro-oxidative stress environment could down-modulate the expression of genes involved in the response against pathogens. patients lacking 1-Pi, the main physiological inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, are at greater risk of developing lymphopenia and monocytopenia. cigarette smoke induces expression of CTSD in pulmonary macrophages. MPO (Myeloperoxidase) constitutes the major component of neutrophil azurophilic granules. MPO is important in bacterial killing, but also drives inflammatory reactions. fungi, yeast, and enveloped viruses also play important roles in promoting inflammation in the lungs. both have been described to affect the integrity of the epithelial layer, decrease the frequency of ciliary beat, increase the secretion of mucus and induce the synthesis of epithelium-derived mediators. this \u201cneutrophil signature\u201d supports the notion of the existence at the systemic level of neutrophils ready to fight against infection but also ready to produce mediators. migration of these cells from the blood vessels could certainly help clear the causative microbe, but also to damage the pulmonary parenchyma. this gene encodes a sialoglycoprotein that is expressed on mature granulocytes and in many B cells. other interesting gene relatively up-regulated in critical patients was VEGFA (Vascular endothelial growth factor A) neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) produced during neutrophil development in bone marrow. they are stored in azurophil granules of mature neutrophils. NSPs contribute to the neutrophil oxygen-independent system-mediated protection of the host against invading pathogens. the absence of MPO reduced inflammatory damage with suppression of leakage of total proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid associated with alteration of claudins in the lung. in this sense, inhibition of MPO may be a novel and useful therapeutic treatment for COPD [15]. the frequency of ciliary beat, increase the secretion of mucus, and induce the synthesis of epithelium-derived mediators. this gene encodes a receptor for the Fc region of IgA. it triggers several immunologic defense processes, including phagocytosis. neutrophils are major actors in antibacterial defence in patients with COPD. this signature is probably related to the fact that the vast majority of patients showed bacterial infection. a limitation of our work is that we did not isolated neutrophils for gene expression profiling assays. VEGFA (Vascular endothelial growth factor A) is a glycosylated mitogen that acts on endothelial cells. this protein has various effects, including mediating increased vascular permeability, inducing angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and endothelial cell growth. VEGF is up-regulated in acutely exacerbated COPD and decrease after recovery from exacerbation. study of transcriptomic signatures in blood suggests the existence of an intense activity of neutrophil proteases in COPD patients. these enzymes are involved in antimicrobial defense but could also mediate tissue damage in the lungs. further studies will determine whether measurement / modulation of the expression of these genes could represent an option for clinical monitoring.
