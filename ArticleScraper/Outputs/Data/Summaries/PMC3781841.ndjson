{"summary": "multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are inflammatory diseases characterized by lymphocyte infiltration, demyelination, and axonal injury. in both MS and EAE, proinflammatory cells and toxic molecules migrate into the brain via the damaged BBB, resulting in cerebral edema, demyelination, and neural cell death. disease severity during acute phase of EAE is directly associated with the extent of BBB permeability [12]. disease severity during the acute phase of EAE is directly associated with the extent of BBB permeability [13]. matrine (MAT) is a natural alkaloid component extracted from the herb Radix Sophorae Flaves. it has been reported that MAT suppressed immune activities of T cells, B cells, and macrophages. it has long been used for the treatment of viral hepatitis, cardiac arrhythmia, and skin inflammation. guinea pig weighing 300\u2013350 g was emulsified with the same volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing 6 mg/mL Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine. each rat received subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mL emulsion divided among 5 sites draining into the nape and back. the 8 rats remaining in each group were anesthetized using Evans Blue (EB) dye. the EB dye was extracted in 2.5 mL of PBS, and 2.5 mL of 60% trichlor. the amount of EB dye in supernatants was determined at 610 nm by spectrophotometry and quantified to g/g brain tissue. cervical spinal cords were harvested on day 17 p.i. and were prepared for analysis of collagen IV and ZO-1 mRNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction. MP-9 and TIMP-1 Serum collected on day 17 p.i. was assayed for concentrations of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 by ELISA. samples were quantified by comparison with the standard curves of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 (0\u2013200 ng/mL) guinea pig weighing 300\u2013350 g was emulsified with the same volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing 6 mg/mL Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine. each rat received a subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mL emulsion divided among 5 sites draining into the nape and back. two independent observers randomly selected 8 rats from each group. when animals were sacrificed, sera and spinal cords were collected. the lumbar enlargement of spinal cords was embedded in paraffin. d and centrifuged for 40 min at 4000 rpm, and the amount of EB dye in supernatants was determined at 610 nm by spectrophotometry. the cervical spinal cords were harvested on day 17 p.i. and were prepared for analysis of collagen IV and ZO-1 mRNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction. 17 p.i. was assayed for concentrations of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 by ELISA. samples were quantified by comparison with the standard curves of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 (0\u2013200 ng/mL) treatment with DEX also delayed disease progression and reduced clinical scores compared to the vehicle-treated group (P 0.05). there was no significant difference between animals treated with DEX and the two different doses of MAT. no significant difference was observed between MAT-H and DEX groups. at day 17 p.i., spinal cord lumbar enlargements were harvested. transverse sections were stained with H&E and C-2R-B. MAT Protects Collagen IV and ZO-1 mRNA expression. the brightest band was exhibited in the naive group. the faintest band was in the vehicle-treated group. MAT-L-treated group showed lower collagen IV expression than the DEX group. MAT Adjusts the Balance between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 was measured by ELISA. the amount of MMP-9 was dramatically increased in the vehicle-treated group compared to the naive group (P 0.01) MAT treatment largely reduced MMP-9 content compared to the vehicle-treated group. MMP-2 expression was significantly increased in the vehicle-treated group over the naive group (P 0.01). the effect of DEX in decreasing MMP-2 content was stronger than low-dose MAT (P 0.05), but there was no significant difference compared with the MAT-H group. clinical decline typically started on day 10 p.i., while EAE onset for MAT-treated rats occurred on day 12 p.i. (low dose) and 13 p.i. (high dose) both MAT-treated groups exhibited significantly lower mean maximum clinical scores (Figure 1(c)) and body weight loss (Table 1). dex showed a stronger inhibition in cellular infiltration than MAT-treated groups. MAT- and DEX-treated groups showed only a few areas of demyelination. no significant difference in demyelination was observed between MAT-H and DEX groups. Evans Blue was i.v. injected at day 17 p.i. and brains were harvested at 60 min. results are expressed as mean SD (n = 8 each group). MAT Adjusts the Balance between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in Serum Serum concentration of MMP-9 was measured by ELISA. the amount of MMP-9 was dramatically increased in the vehicle-treated group compared to the naive group (P 0.01). MAT Regulates the balance between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in the CNS. expression in the spinal cord was measured by immunohistochemistry. the difference in MMP-2 expression was significantly increased in the vehicle-treated group over the naive group. MAT-L-treated group showed lower TIMP-2 expression than the DEX-treated group (P 0.05) there was no significant difference between MAT-H and DEX groups. MAT administration reduced CNS inflammatory infiltration and demyelination. decreased collagen IV mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the vehicle-treated group compared to the naive group. results indicate that collagen IV degradation plays an important role in BBB disruption and that MAT treatment effectively preserves the content of collagen IV. upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 resulted in the degradation of TJs after focal ischemia/reperfusion. a selective upregulation of MMP-9 in the central canal of the cervical spinal cord is a sign of inflammation in acute EAE [38]. a significant increase in MMP-2 expression in the central canal of the cervical spinal cord is a sign of inflammation in acute EAE. a significant increase in the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio also correlates with MS activity [17]. we could speculate that overexpression of MMP-9/-2 in EAE was counterbalanced by MAT-mediated increase in TIMP-1/-2 expression. MAT at a low dose showed a weaker effect than DEX, but a comparable effect was observed between DEX and MAT-H groups. study demonstrates that improving BBB integrity is one of the mechanisms of MAT action in EAE therapy. this effect is at least partially through inhibiting activities of MMP-2/-9 and protecting the basement membranes and tight junction proteins. this effect is at least partially through inhibiting activities of MMP-2/-9 and protecting the basement membranes and tight junction proteins."}
