{"summary": "a new strain, AdV-55, has been a major AdV pneumonia pathogen in immunocompetent adolescents and adults in china since 2008. most severe cases were previously reported to be associated with AdV-3, 4, 7 and 21 [2,3]. but those strains are not necessarily associated with bad outcomes, and pathogenesis of fatality is still unknown. sputum or respiratory tract aspiration, blood and urine were collected at admission and submitted to the Infectious Disease and Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. subjects with positive adenovirus results who were negative for other etiologies during the study period were enrolled. quantitative and Typing of Adenoviruses Respiratory tract samples were processed by equal volume 1% trypsin digestion. the viral DNA was extracted from 1 milliliter (ml) digested respiratory sample and 1 ml whole blood sample using a QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) 187 H-3as ACCCTGTCCGATCTCAC 19591\u201319607 H-4as AGATGAACTTCTCCCAACTACTACTGT 19466\u201319487 H-4as ACTTGTATGTGGAAAGGCAC 19908\u201319927 H-5s CGGACGTTTTTTC 19898\u201319916 H-5as GAGGGAGTTTTTT 20293\u201320311 H-6as AATTGACCTCATCAACCACC 20654\u201320673 PCR detection includes rhinovirus, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza 1\u20134, coronavirus OC43 and 229E, and metapneumovirus. only subjects with positive adenovirus results who were negative for other etiologies during the study period were enrolled. we used a commercial FQ-PCR kit (Daan Gene, Cat. #DA-B067, Guangzhou, China) targeting the DNA polymerase gene. we used a commercial FQ-PCR kit (Daan Gene, Cat. #DA-B067, Guangzhou, China) data analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc; Chicago, IL) Results Demographic characteristics From March 2013 to June 2013, a total of 14 admitted cases were confirmed with adenovirus as the only pathogen of pneumonia. only two patients had co-morbidities, one with tuberculous pleuritis for 2 months and one with congenital heart disease. 1.8 0.330 Clinical features PSI Score (Mean SD) 46.5 26.7 101.3 8.0 0.002 Tmax (\u00b0C) (Mean SD) 39.70.6 39.5 0.4 0.620 Dyspnea (%) 2/10 (20%) 4/4 (100%) 0.015 Hemoptysis (%) 1/10 (10%) 2/4 (50%) 0.176 Yellow sputum (%) 4/10 (40%) 0/4 (0%) 0.25 Diarrhea (%) 32 Mechanical ventilation (%) 1/10 (10%) 4/4 (100%) 0.032 ECMO (%) 1/10 (10%) 3/4 (75%) 0.041 ICU admission (%) 1/10 (10%) 4/4 (100%) 0.005 LOS (Mean SD) (days) 13.39.2 13.56.5 0.969 Note: ARDS = Adult Respiratory Distress Symptom. ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. onset to initial PCR test for respiratory tract samples and whole blood was 6.23 days. adenoviral load in respiratory tract samples and whole blood was expressed as log10 DNA copies per ml samples. fatal cases had a higher initial viral load (8.578 2.115 vs 6.263 1.225, p = 0.023) viremia was common at admission (on 5\u20137 day after onset of illness) however, it persisted in 100% (4/4) of the fatal cases with 33.3% (2/6) of the surviving cases (p = 0.017) for surviving severe patients, we found that the clinical manifestation recovered gradually with a downward trend in viral load in respiratory tract and whole blood samples. the viral load in tracheal aspiration gradually decreased during the first 20 days, and the lung infiltrate absorbed partially. however, the viral load trended up again and the patient died. the patient maintained a viral load in whole blood before death. CK-MB = Creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (CTNI) went down to normal levels in parallel. viral load level is presented with log10 DNA copy numbers per ml of sample. times of death were on days 14, 16, 22 and 28 after disease onset. chest CT showed a typical crescent sign and halo sign indicative of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. the patient recovered from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis after voriconazole treatment for 12 months. 1.8 0.330 Clinical features PSI Score (Mean SD) 46.5 26.7 101.3 8.0 0.002 Tmax (\u00b0C) (Mean SD) 39.70.6 39.5 0.4 0.620 Dyspnea (%) 2/10 (20%) 4/4 (100%) 0.015 Hemoptysis (%) 1/10 (10%) 2/4 (50%) 0.176 Yellow sputum (%) 4/10 (40%) 0/4 (0%) 0.25 Diarrhea (%) the fatal cases had a higher PSI score (101.3 8.0) and dyspnea incidence (4/4) compared to the PSI score (46.526.7) and dyspnea incidence (2/10) in surviving cases. all of the fatal cases described bilateral involvement on chest radiography and 75% noted pleural effusion. to initial PCR test for respiratory tract samples and whole blood was 6.23 days. there were no significant difference between the fatal group and surviving group. the fatal cases had a higher initial viral load (8.578 2.115 vs 6.263 1.225, p = 0.023) viremia was common at admission (on 5\u20137 day after onset of illness) however, it persisted in 100% (4/4) of the fatal cases with 33.3% (2/6) of the surviving cases (p = 0.017) for surviving severe patients, we found that the clinical manifestation recovered gradually with a downward trend in viral load in respiratory tract and whole blood samples. the viral load in tracheal aspiration gradually decreased during the first 20 days, and the lung infiltrate absorbed partially. however, the viral load trended up again and the patient died. the patient maintained a viral load in whole blood before death. ine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (CTNI) went down to normal levels in parallel. viral load level is presented with log10 DNA copy numbers per ml of sample. times of death were on days 14, 16, 22 and 28 after disease onset. the patient recovered from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis after voriconazole treatment for 12 months. viremia is common and sustained viremia for 14 days or more may be associated with mortality. pathogenesis of mortality in Adv pneumonia is still unknown. 100% (4/4) of patients in fatal cases presented with viremia on day 12\u201314 after disease onset, compared with 60% (p = 0.126) of the patients in surviving cases. in one case, even though the patient presented with a higher viral load (108.32 copies / ml) in tracheal aspiration, his clinical manifestation recovered gradually with a downward trend in the viral load in respiratory tract and whole blood samples. the choice of the antiviral medicine was decided by the patient\u2019s physician. none of these medicines have been confirmed to be effective for AdV infection. the relationship between viral shedding and clinical outcomes in this study was not associated with anti-adenoviral treatment effect."}
