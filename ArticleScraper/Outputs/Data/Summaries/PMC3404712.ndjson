{"summary": "METHODS Recruitment and Follow-up of participants In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, we randomly allocated children aged 6\u201315 years to receive 2008\u20132009 seasonal trivalent influenza inactivated vaccine. participants were followed up for illnesses through symptom diaries and telephone calls, and illness reports in any household member triggered home visits. participants were followed up for illnesses through symptom diaries and telephone calls. participants were followed up for illnesses through symptom diaries and telephone calls, and illness reports in any household member triggered home visits. acute respiratory illness (ARI) determined by self-reported signs and symptoms as 2 of the following signs or symptoms: body temperature 37.8\u00b0C, headache, sore throat, cough, presence of phlegm, coryza, and myalgia [16]. duration of follow-up varied by participant. 11 years 41 (59) 27 (59) 12\u201315 years 9 (13) 3 (7) Female sex, No. (%) 30 (43) 23 (50) Median duration of follow-up, days 272 272 Mean no. of individuals per household 3.7 3.6 Abbreviation: TIV, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. to collect 73 NTSs for testing from participants for 65 of 134 (49%) ARI episodes. the delay between ARI onset and collection of first NTS was 1.22 days. 5% of NTSs were collected >3 days after illness onset. piratory Virus Detection by Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction and Multiplex Assay Variable TIV (n = 69) Placebo (n = 46) P Value No. Ratea (95% CI) Any seasonal influenza 3 58 (19\u2013180) 3 88 (28\u2013270) Seasonal influenza A (H3N2) 1 19 (3\u2013140) 0 0 (0\u201388). in TIV recipients there were 4 detections with both rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus, and 1 detection with both coxsackie/echovirus and coronavirus NL63. the ResPlex II multiplex array tested for 19 virus targets including influenza types A and B. we identified a statistically significant increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients. significant increases in the risk of rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus infection. increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection could be an artefactual finding. respiratory viruses reported in children for 1\u20132 weeks after receipt of live poliovirus vaccine [29\u201332] despite this limitation, we were able to observe a statistically significant increased risk of confirmed noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients. a negative association between serologic evidence of influenza infection and confirmed noninfluenza virus infection in winter 2009 was not statistically significant. additional community-based observational cohort studies and community-based experimental studies may be particularly suitable for investigating temporary nonspecific immunity. most acute URTIs do not require medical attention."}
