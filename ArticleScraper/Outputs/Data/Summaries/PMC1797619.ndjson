{"summary": "the fusion of the viral with a cellular membrane is a key step in the life cycle of these viruses. this entry step is controlled by specific proteins at the viral surface that are primed to undergo dramatic structural changes. this entry step is controlled by specific proteins at the viral surface that are primed to undergo dramatic structural changes and thus drive membrane fusion. class II proteins of flaviviruses and alphaviruses lie tangentially to the viral membrane and form an icosahedral oligomeric network at the virion surface. a third category of fusion proteins with features of both class I and class II has been recently described for vesicular stomatitis and herpes simplex 1 viruses. in the case of the class II alphavirus fusion protein E1, it was possible to stabilize an intermediate trimeric core by the addition of one of its domains in soluble form. this prevents the formation of the final postfusion hairpin-like structure and thus inhibits fusion. in this work, we use tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus as a model to dissect the class II flavivirus membrane fusion pathway. the internal FP loop is buried at the dimer interface (Figure 1A and 1B) the internal FP loop is located at the tip of domain (D)II. the internal FP loop is buried at the dimer interface (Figure 1A and 1B) the stem forms two -helices (H1 and H2) lying on the viral membrane. ninety E dimers form a rigid glycoprotein cage enclosing the viral membrane. the structure of the TBE virus sE is translocated to a lateral position. sE trimer-stabilizing role of DIII in hairpin-like conformation of molecule. it is possible to trigger conformational changes of E at the virus surface in discrete steps. the monomeric conformation of E is obtained by exposing TBE virions to alkaline pH instead of the physiological acidic pH. this leads to hairpin formation and E trimerization. virions were exposed to alkaline pH, back-neutralized, and solubilized with Triton X-100. virions were exposed to alkaline pH, back-neutralized, and solubilized with Triton X-100. alkaline pH causes a considerable weakening of the interaction forces of the E dimer. alkaline pH\u2013treated virions were readjusted to pH 8.0. then solubilized with Triton X-100 and centrifuged at pH 8.0. sedimentation direction is from left to right, and positions of E monomer (M), dimer (D) and trimer (T) are indicated. alkaline pH\u2013treated particles showed a significantly rougher surface. the control sample treated at low pH revealed heavily aggregated virus particles studded with bulky spikes corresponding to the trimeric \u201cpostfusion\u201d structure of the E protein. in all cases, the core diameter of the best-preserved virions has a similar value. alkaline pH is required for initiating membrane fusion because it exposes the internal FP and allows its interaction with the target membrane [39] almost all of the E protein was recovered from the top of the gradient, indicating its association with the liposomes. liposomes at different pHs compared with the control at pH 5.4. it was not yet clear whether the interaction with liposomes at alkaline pH was indeed mediated through the internal FP loop. a monoclonal antibody (designated A1) was used as controls. in vitro liposome fusion assay with pyrene phospholipid\u2013labeled virus and unilamellar liposomes. results obtained at pH 10.0 were negative and comparable to the control at pH 8.0. virions and liposomes were preincubated at pH 10.0 for 10 min before adjustment to pH 5.4. virions were incubated for 10 min at pH 10.0 (boxes), pH 5.4 (diamonds), or pH 8.0 (open circles), solubilized, and analyzed as described. we further analyzed whether the E protein in particles bound to liposomes at alkaline pH was still competent for fusion at acidic pH. the extent and rate of fusion were the same as observed in the control. ized to pH 7.6 did not exhibit any reduction in infectivity titers in BHK-21 cells compared with untreated controls. mixtures of virions and liposomes were treated at pH 5.4 and 10.0, respectively, fixed with formalin. electron microscopy of a virion in the process of acidic pH\u2013induced membrane fusion suggests that those E proteins in the particle that cannot contact the target membrane form postfusion trimers. phosphotungstic acid adjusted to pH 8.0. effects of alkaline pH on the Virion Envelope Organization. similar treatments had no functional effect. virions were incubated for 10 min at pH 10.0 (boxes), pH 5.4 (diamonds), or pH 8.0 (circles), solubilized with Triton X-100. material from the alkaline pH\u2013induced E monomer peak in Figure 2A was readjusted to pH 8.0 and then centrifuged at pH 8.0 into 7% to 20% sucrose gradients (w/w) in buffer containing 0.1% Triton X- SDS-PAGE of TBE virus samples cross-linked with DMS at pH 8.0 and 10.0 without pretreatment and after pretreatment at pH 5.4 (B). positions of the E monomer (M), dimer (D), and trimer (T) are indicated. radial projections likely represent E monomers. all micrographs have been recorded at the same magnification. in (B) and (C), the virions lose their shell-like icosahedral envelope structure. in (C), the virions are aggregated, a characteristic of TBE virus maintained at low pH. Virus was incubated for 10 min with liposomes at 37 \u00b0C at pH 10.0 (boxes) and as controls at pH 5.4 (diamonds) or pH 8.0 (circles), back-neutralized, and then subjected to centrifugation in sucrose step gradients. the top fractions containing virus bound to liposomes are indicated by a bracket. no evidence for E trimerization induced by virus attachment to liposomes was obtained. sedimentation analysis in the presence of Triton X-100 revealed only E monomers. we investigated whether alkaline pH can substitute for acidic pH to cause membrane fusion. virions were preincubated at pH 10.0 for 10 min, adjusted to pH 5.4. virions were solubilized, and subjected to sucrose density centrifugation. the corresponding curves are labeled pH 5.4, pH 8.0, pH 10.0, and pH 10.0. the alkaline pH\u2013mediated attachment of E monomers to target membranes leaves the proteins in a state that is still competent for fusion upon acidification. the other entry functions of E in virions are apparently preserved or can be completely restored after alkaline pH treatment. virions and liposomes were treated at pH 5.4 and 10.0 respectively. samples, on the other hand, are compatible with an attachment through the distal ends of monomeric E projections. samples are compatible with an attachment through the distal ends of monomeric E projections. they are compatible with an attachment through the distal ends of monomeric E projections. the smooth icosahedral glycoprotein cage of mature virions is sensitive to the environmental pH being stable in a limited pH range. such \u201copening up\u201d of the cage appears to be caused by simultaneous dissociation of the 90 E dimers that at neutral pH are interlocked in a \u201cherringbone\u201d pattern at the virus surface. this is likely to allow an efficient multivalent interaction of the FP with the target membrane. the sE dimer is apparently needed in the sE dimer for the FP to fit in a pocket between DI and DIII in the partner subunit. it is likely that the sE segment also forms a straight rod in the monomeric form. it is therefore likely that the sE segment also forms a straight rod in the monomeric form. exogenous DIII is unconstrained and can bind and stabilize an intermediate form of E before the endogenous DIII can reach its correct location to form a hairpin. the formation of a monomeric prehairpin intermediate suggests a new possibility because only a subset of the E protomers can reach and interact with the target membrane. virions were metabolically labeled with 1-pyrenehexadecanoic acid. liposomes were mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1:2 from stock solutions in chloroform. phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids), phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and cholesterol were subjected to five cycles of freeze-thawing. purified virions in TAN buffer were incubated for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C at pH 10.0, 8.0, or 5.4 and solubilized with 1% Triton-X 100. the samples were then incubated for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C at the respective pH. ifuged for 20 h in an SW 40 rotor at 38,000 rpm and 15 \u00b0C. the amount of E in each fraction was determined by four-layer ELISA. purified virus preparations at a concentration of 9 g/ml were cross-linked with dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) at pH 8.0 and pH 10.0. virions were incubated in the presence of liposomes at pH 5.4. the 2-ml virus\u2013liposome mixture was then applied to a 50% cushion. centrifugation was carried out for 1.5 h at 50,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. fractions were collected by upward displacement. a CM12 electron microscope operated at 80 kV and the micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO163 image plates developed for 5 min in D19. fluorescence was recorded continuously for 60 s at 480 nm using a Perkin Elmer. virions were labeled with 1-pyrenehexadecanoic acid as described previously. liposomes were hydrated in liposome buffer (10 mM triethanolamine, 140 mM NaCl [pH 8.0] and subjected to five cycles of freeze-thawing. the samples were readjusted to pH 8.0 using 50 mM MES. low pH\u2013treated samples were back-neutralized with 150 mM triethanolamine. for cross-linking at pH 10.0, the CAPS buffer was replaced by 0.2 M TEA. l were cross-linked with dimethyl suberimidate (DMS; Pierce Biotechnology, http://www.piercenet.com) at pH 8.0 and pH 10.0 with or without pH 5.4 pretreatment for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. cross-linked virions were concentrated by pelleting in a Ti90 rotor (Beckman) at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. centrifugation was carried out for 1.5 h at 50,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C in a Beckman SW 55 rotor. fractions were collected by upward displacement. virions (final protein concentration 37.5 g/ml) were incubated with purified E protein\u2013specific monoclonal antibodies. fluorescence recorded continuously for 60 s at 480 nm using a LS 50B Fluorescence Spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 343 nm. pyrene-labeled virions (0.5 to 1 M) were mixed with 0.3 mM liposomes at pH 8.0 in a continuously stirred fluorimeter cuvette at 37 \u00b0C. virus TBE virus strain Neudoerfl is TEU27495."}
