{"summary": "ebolaviruses in the family Filoviridae have caused multiple lethal human disease outbreaks. the first filovirus discovered, MARV, originated from a zoonotic transmission from infected monkeys shipped from Uganda. a child in Guinea became the index case of an Ebola disease epidemic in Western Africa that spread through multiple nations. the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) lists immunological responses to a wide variety of pathogens, including filoviruses. the Ebola Genome Browser hosts the Ebola Genome Browser with viral sequences from previous and current EVD and MVD outbreaks. virus Database originated as part of the larger biothreat HFV database. it covers viruses belonging to over 80 viral species. the database uses the same framework as the HIV and Hepatitis C Virus Los Alamos databases (21, 22), and many tools are similar. 1975' corresponds to the point in Zimbabwe on the marburg inset map. if the year of sampling is later than a corresponding year in the map, it is because the disease outbreak spanned a year. the 2013\u201315 EVD outbreak in western Africa began with an index case infected in December 2013. the stored sequences can be accessed through the web-based interfaces. users can tailor queries to relevant subsets of the data. the reference sequences of each species and the annotation obtained from NCBI\u2019s RefSeq database are used across our site. the sequences can be accessed via a user-friendly interface that allows searches on > 30 such fields. the search interface also enables the exclusion of problematic sequences. Species and viruses are named following the most recent nomenclature. the species reference alignments contain only eight filovirus reference sequences. the species reference alignments contain 34 sequences representing a virus that seeded a distinct human EVD or MVD outbreak. RESTV and LLOV were included in the outbreak set. full-length membrane-bound GP trimer of ebolavirus and Cuevavirus GPs requires the insertion of an extra adenine residue. otherwise a soluble glycoprotein (sGP) is produced. sGP is produced 70% of the time, GP 25% and ssGP 5% (33). IEDB entries and database tools aligning the epitope are all linked via the browser. each epitope presented in its proteomic/genomic location relative to the alignment of eight filovirus reference sequences (2). the HFV database uses the same framework as the HIV and Hepatitis C Virus Los Alamos databases. the taxon representing this infection is labeled \u2018ZW -> ZA 1975\u2019. it corresponds to the point in Zimbabwe on the marburg inset map, labeled 1975. if the year of sampling of the sequence in the tree is later than a year in the map, it is because the disease outbreak spanned a year. 1700 sequences, including 1361 ebolavirus, 336 marburgvirus and 2 cuevavirus sequences, and 24 tables containing related metadata. our database and analysis tools were built using HTML, Javascript, Mason, Perl and CGI:Perl. the sequences can be accessed via a user-friendly interface that allows searches on > 30 such fields. users can design tailored sequence names with additional metadata concisely incorporated to facilitate subsequent analysis. ome and individual gene and protein sequence alignments are available for all filoviruses, as well as separate alignments for ebolavirus and marburgvirus sequences. automated alignment using MAFFT (31) serves as a basis for these alignments, which are hand checked to determine if the boundaries of internal gap regions and boundaries encompassing codon regions are sensible. EBOV 3.5 1.8 SUDV 1.5 0.9 MARV 10.9 5.9 Virus differences between species. alignments maintain proper reading frame for all proteins in the genome. soluble glycoprotein (sGP) is produced 70% of the time, GP 25% and ssGP 5% (33). epitope database entries include detailed information describing how each epitope was first characterized, vaccines used to elicit immune responses, continuous and conformational antibody epitope binding details. publications, IEDB entries and database tools aligning the epitope are all linked via the browser. phylogenetic, geographic and temporal data among outbreak sequences. a maximum likelihood tree was built using our outbreak alignment as input for the HFV database interface for PhyML. the tree was based on only coding regions, which can be much more readily aligned across genera than the highly divergent variable length inter-genic regions. two bats that had been tagged in the Kitaka cave were later identified in the Python Cave, suggesting that bats could readily move virus between sites. a clear example of this can be seen in the three EVD outbreaks due to SUDV in S. Sudan (42). the isolates are highly similar, but were sampled over a period spanning 28 years between 1976 and 2004. the 2014 EBOV COD isolate is genetically more similar to the 1976 isolate than it is to many viruses isolated during EBOV-caused EVD outbreaks in the intervening years. the international effort that enabled rapid sampling and sequencing of the Western Africa\u2019s 2013\u201315 outbreak sequences (43, 45, 46) has allowed an unparalleled view of evolution of EBOV as it moved through a human host population. the middle panel shows cumulative silent and non-silent changes along the GP, codon-by-codon. the bottom panel shows the normalized difference between non-synonymous and synonymous changes (dN-dS) the projecting highly glycosylated mucin-like domain dominates GP surfaces available for host interaction (51), is highly enriched for non-synonymous substitutions. Sequence colors correspond to the sequence colors on Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1. Synonymous (green) and non-synonymous (red) substitutions in each sequence with respect to EBOV consensus sequence are shown by vertical bars. grey bars represent insertions and deletions. random effects likelihood (REL) methods combined found 6 sites of positive selection, supported by two or all three methods, in or very close to the mucin-like domain region. a Sequence WebLogo was constructed over 34 sequences from the one-per-outbreak alignment. the epitope was completely conserved within each species, but only species reference sequences are shown under the logo. rary, geographical clusters and outbreaks can result from separate introductions of diverse local viruses into humans. a series of nine introductions of distinct viruses into humans between 1998 and 2000, with different MARV and RAVV sequences among them. in 2007, both MARV and RAVV infections were identified in miners who worked in the kitaka cave mines in Uganda. the MARV that was transferred to Europe from Uganda in 1967 was genetically most similar to a MARV sequence obtained from a Dutch tourist infected while visiting Uganda in 2008, 41 years later. the sequence from the first EVD outbreak due to EBOV in 1976 in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (COD), (44) was much more similar to a sequence sampled in COD in 2014 EVD outbreak (43) than the sequences from the 2013\u201315 Western African EVD the international effort that enabled rapid sampling and sequencing of the Western Africa\u2019s 2013\u201315 outbreak sequences has allowed an unparalleled view of evolution of EBOV as it moved through a human host population. despite high filovirus GP variability, up to 70% in protein sequence (52, 53) several regions stand out by all three methods as negatively selected throughout all species and genera, suggesting strong functional constraints. MR78 is the first isolated cross-reactive antibody that binds both MARV and EBOV GPs. it overlaps a region of negative selection across filoviruses. similar conserved regions are evident in all filovirus genes aligned to EBOV consensus sequence. rapidly rising regions (i.e. mucin-like domain) in non-synonymous plot correspond to high accumulation of non-synonymous changes. slowly changing regions on non-synonymous plot indicate negative selection. the HFV database provides carefully annotated nucleotide and protein sequences and multiple sequence alignments at the Filoviridae family, genus, species and outbreak levels. the database has about 30 computational tools for analysis, many of which are tailored to filoviruses specifically. known HFV protein variation can inform next-generation vaccine design to help protect against new disease outbreaks in an uncertain future. the BDBV, first discovered in an outbreak in 2007 (a full 30 years after the first known EVD outbreak in 1976), belongs to a distinct species.
