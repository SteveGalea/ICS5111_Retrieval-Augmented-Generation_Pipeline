{"summary": "hepatitis A virus, normally considered non-enveloped, can temporarily acquire a lipid envelope which may help the virus to spread in the presence of an immune response. the difficulty in disrupting this process is due to a poor understanding of the mechanics of assembly. four mechanisms have been proposed to explain how highly curved membranes and vesicles are formed. in the first, the membrane wraps around intrinsically curved proteins that have a high affinity for the membrane. in the second mechanism, locally high concentrations of lipid-binding protein can drive curvature by a crowding mechanism [8], although it is not clear how readily the necessary protein concentrations can be achieved in living cells. bBorna disease virus M protein contains a YXXL motif that has not yet been demonstrated to function as an L-domain. arenavirus virions assemble as a flat raft inside the plasma membrane, which then forms a bud by a poorly understood mechanism that involves Z [41]. the viral nucleoprotein NP may facilitate this process in some viruses [43,44] arenavirus proteins accumulate at flat membranes before bud formation [47\u201350] this suggests that bud formation is unlikely to be driven directly by protein crowding, asymmetric protein distribution or intrinsic curvature of the virus proteins. the proposed mechanism involves coordinated removal of amphipathic wedges from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. this would be energetically equivalent to a mechanism of curvature driven by amphipathic wedge insertion. this would be energetically equivalent to a mechanism of curvature driven by amphipathic wedge insertion. several cellular [5,10,11] and viral [12] proteins have been proposed to induce membrane curvature in a similar way by inserting amphipathic protein domains into one face of the membrane. for the sake of simplicity, proteins are assumed to cover an axisymmetric region on a spherical cell. electron micrographs show that Z forms a layer along the underside of the viral membrane in round virions. experimental work indicates that membrane protein is strongly associated with membrane curvature. a mathematical model shows that membrane curvature is sufficient to produce fully formed buds. results 2.1. the curved \u2018tips\u2019 of ellipsoidal particles (GP, p 105;

Tacaribe (TCRV the mean ratio of each virion's maximum diameter to its minimum diameter was 1.029, 1.039 and 1.041, respectively. it follows from equations (4.7) and (4.8) that 2.5. 2.3. changes in the local innate curvature of the membrane are alone sufficient to drive bud formation. the steady state of the system increases with protein covering a region commensurate with the surface area of a vesicle with radius. a bud can be closed under any far-field tension T0. the model predicts that the proposed protein-induced curvature mechanism will yield buds of a similar size to those observed experimentally. in the absence of all other interactions, this would be the predicted energy required to remove all the switches within the budding region. results show that there is significantly less of each protein at the flatter \u2018sides\u2019 of ellipsoidal virus particles than at the curved \u2018tips\u2019 of ellipsoidal particles (GP, p 105;

Tacaribe (TCRV) (|r| 0. the continuum model does not extend to the limit where the bud pinches off. we further confirm that such behaviour is possible within realistic biological parameters. bud development occurs in the biologically relevant regime. increased stiffness of the budding region ( > 1) can produce a tighter bud with a smaller radius, thus increasing the potential to pinch off for smaller budding regions. if sufficient protein is present, a bud can be closed under any far-field tension T0, provided is sufficiently large. a viable mechanism for viral-protein-driven budding has been identified. such viral proteins are significantly associated with virion membrane curvature. the mechanism takes account of the fact that proteins embed in the inner but not outer leaflet of the membrane. the membrane model is valid only to the point of pinch off, but the mechanism whereby the connection between the virion and cell are severed has already been established. the models could potentially be applied to the budding of other pleomorphic viruses. virions were sampled in pairs consisting of one nearly round particle (dmax/dmin 1.07) and one elliptical particle (dmax/dmin > 1.20) of similar size from the same micrograph. 7845 data points from 109 particles were used for this analysis. virions and vesicles were categorized as spherical if the ratio of maximum to minimal axis was less than 1.04. virions and vesicles were categorized as spherical if the ratio of maximum to minimal axis was less than 1.04. the cell membrane is modelled as an area-conserving thin shell with an intrinsic mean curvature. the constant of proportionality is the bending stiffness B. we assume that the membrane offers negligible resistance to in-plane shearing. to describe the membrane mathematically, we define s as the radial arc-length distance along the membrane from the centre of the budding region. we then define s as the innate mean curvature is given by 4.1 whereas the bending stiffness is given by 4.2. the thin-shell assumption of the model remains valid as long as the radius of curvature of the membrane is large compared with the membrane thickness. the radius of mammalian cells rc can be measured by direct observation using electron microscopy. the possible thickness of the cell membrane is based on a lower estimate of the distance between the inner and outer phosphate groups. the radius of arenavirus virions rv has also been measured by electron cryomicroscopy [66] arenavirus proteins collect in discrete patches, approximately 200 nm in diameter, at the surface of infected cells [49]. the patches appear to bend the effectively planar membrane into a virus-sized sphere, which then pinches off from the plasma membrane to form a new virion. hexagonal packing implies the area of the hexagon is shared by three protein groups. the surface density of Z-proteins is then given by 4.3 where n is the number of proteins in a group. we estimate the value of the protein-induced change in curvature. we define the relative deformation D of a vesicle or virion by 4.7. for vesicles without viral protein the mean value of D was 0.070. for virions and vesicles that exhibit small deformations from a sphere, it is reasonable to suppose that the relative deformation D will be proportional to the bending stiffness B of the membrane. the internal forces in the membrane are a tension T(s), a bending moment M(s) and a shear moment Q(s) these forces are also depicted in figure 5. only one component of the shear moment is non-zero, owing to the axisymmetry. Equations (4.9)\u2013(4.11), (4.12) and (4.15)\u2013(4.17) may be recast a set of explicit first-order equations. s = 0 at the centre of the bud and s = smax, the as-yet unknown arc-length at the opposite side of the cell. the seventh-order system has a conserved quantity whose value is consistent with both sets of boundary conditions and one free parameter smax. the conserved quantity arises from a vertical force balance, and is given by 4.27 The equations imply dF/ds = 0, and the boundary conditions at s = 0 determine F = 0. asymptotic solution for small buds (R1) should match on to that of a sphere with uniform curvatures 4.35 Substituting (4.35) and (4.1) into (4.14) implies that M = 0 in the spherical region, from which it follows that Q = 0 by (4.22). this implies that by (4.24), T = T0 is constant. equations (4.23) and (4.24) are consistent with boundary conditions (4.25) at and (4.37) as. the system of interest then reduces to 4.42 4.43 4.44 4.45 4.46 with and given by (4.40) and (4.31), respectively. condition (4.47) is applied at a large value of : in practice, proved sufficiently small for accurate results. the solution of the system is not unique, although we ever found only one physically appropriate solution for any set of parameters. the relative length scales of the problem, and model dynamics, are determined by the parameters of the system. virions were sampled in pairs consisting of one nearly round particle (dmax/dmin 1.07) and one elliptical particle (dmax/dmin > 1.20) from the same micrograph. total of 7845 data points from 109 particles were used for this analysis. to test the association of viral protein with membrane curvature, a comparison of the relatively flat \u2018sides\u2019 of elliptical particles versus their more curved \u2018tips\u2019 was then undertaken. to evaluate the role of viral protein in the membrane stiffness, the major and minor axes of each particle were measured and compared. the cell membrane is modelled as an area-conserving thin shell with an intrinsic mean curvature. the constant of proportionality is the bending stiffness B. we assume that the membrane offers negligible resistance to in-plane shearing. to describe the membrane mathematically, we define s as the radial arc-length distance along the membrane from the centre of the budding region. the innate mean curvature is given by 4.1 whereas the bending stiffness is given by 4.2 The thin-shell assumption of the model remains valid as long as the radius of curvature of the membrane is large compared with the membrane thickness. the mean radius of mammalian cells rc can be measured by direct observation using electron microscopy. the possible thickness of the cell membrane is based on a lower estimate of the distance between the inner and outer phosphate groups. the radius of arenavirus virions rv has also been measured by electron cryomicroscopy. arenavirus proteins collect in discrete patches, approximately 200 nm in diameter, at the surface of infected cells [49]. the patches appear to bend the effectively planar membrane into a virus-sized sphere, which then pinches off from the plasma membrane to form a new virion. hexagonal packing implies the area of the hexagon is shared by three protein groups. surface density of Z-proteins (i.e. the number per unit area) is then given by 4.3 where n (equal to two or four) is the number of proteins in a group. estimates of the likely change in stiffness owing to protein attachment are based on the observed differences in deformation between arenavirus virions and protein-free vesicles released from the same set of cells. the latter are made up of cell membrane which appears not to have undergone changes induced by viral protein. for vesicles without viral protein the mean value of D was 0.070. model coordinate system: a sketch of the axisymmetric cell with a virus bud forming near r = z = 0; b) a close-up of the centre of the budding region, showing the coordinates (s,) used describe the membrane in the model. internal forces in the membrane are a tension T(s), a bending moment M(s) and a shear moment Q(s) these forces are also shown in figure 5. Equations (4.9)\u2013(4.11), (4.12) and (4.15)\u2013(4.17) may be recast a set of explicit first-order equations. the equations are to be solved between s = 0 at the centre of the bud and s = smax, the as-yet unknown arc-length at the opposite side of the cell. the seventh-order system has a conserved quantity whose value is consistent with both sets of boundary conditions and one free parameter smax. the conserved quantity arises from a vertical force balance, and is given by 4.27 The equations imply dF/ds = 0, and the boundary conditions at s = 0 determine F = 0. asymptotic solution for small buds (R1) If the bud is small compared with the size of the cell, then away from the budding region, the cell surface is expected to remain spherical to good approximation. we can neglect the terms in the non-dimensionalized system (4.18)\u2013(4.24).
