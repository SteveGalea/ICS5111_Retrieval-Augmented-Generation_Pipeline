{"summary": "a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders are associated with conformational conversion of the cellular prion protein, PrPC, into a -sheet-rich form, PrPSc [1]\u2013[5]. the mechanism by which PrPC is converted to the abnormal isoform is presumed to involve a PrPC\u2013PrPSc complex, with the latter serving as a conformational template. this raises the issue of whether there are critical contact sites that mediate conversion. nal antibodies have a range of inhibitory effects on the PrPC\u2013PrPSc conversion process. the degree of inhibition is Mab specific and more dependent on the antibody targeting region than on the specific epitope being recognized. the PMCA-based method is dose-dependent and rapid. the immunoreactivity of all the Mabs was analyzed on western blots against denatured, PK-digested and undigested PrP derived from uninfected and infected brain homogenates. each of the individual Mabs had equivalent immunoreactivity against murine and hamster PrPSc on an immunoglobulin concentration basis. the supernatant was combined with 6X Laemmli sample buffer. 50 l was electrophoresed in a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. membrane was blocked for 1 hr in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) with 5% non-fat dry milk. membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk/tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) probed with antibody diluted 15000 in 1% normal goat serum/TBS at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary. membranes were regenerated for re-use by shaking with dimethylformamide for 30 minutes, then twice for 30 minutes the amount of PrPSc in 200 g cell lysate aliquots of the N2a/22L cells was determined by PK digestion (1 g/l PK for 30 min at 37\u00b0C), SDS-PAGE on 12.5% Tris-tricine gels. each Mab was tested in three independent experiments using independently infected cell lines. all procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in accordance with the United States Department of Agriculture Animal Welfare Act and the National Institute of Health policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals. Tissue samples from uninfected and prion agent-infected mice and hamsters were obtained using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center. a 10% 263K brain homogenate was prepared in PBS only and diluted to a final concentration of 104. each sample was sonicated (QSONIC at 480W power, 60 Amplitude, 40,000 J energy, 90 sec process time, 3 sec pulse on1 sec pulse off) at the end of every five cycles, an additional 10 l of 10% NBH (with or without Mab) was added. the membrane was washed 3 times (10 min each) with PBST, incubated for 60 min in HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) followed by 3 additional PBST washes and detection of proteins with ECL Supersignal West Dura kit (Thermo Fisher) membranes spotted with 99 overlapping 13-mer PrP peptides were produced as previously described. membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk/tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) probed with antibody diluted 15000 in 1% normal goat serum/TBS at 4\u00b0C overnight. each Mab was tested in three independent experiments using independently infected cell lines. each experiment included both a positive control (untreated N2a/22L cells) and a negative control (N2a cells), which were subjected to PK digestion. the level of PK-resistant PrPSc was measured in western blots. treatment with the 22L mouse-adapted scrapie strain (N2a/22L) did not result in any cytotoxicity to the N2a/22L cells throughout the incubation period. incubation of the cells with 10 g/ml purified, irrelevant mouse IgG had no effect on PrPSc formation compared to untreated N2a/22L cultures lacking Mab. the addition of 8E9 to 5D6 and 11F12 caused a 45% PrPSc inhibition. this was slightly better than 8E9 alone. the predicted additive inhibitory effect of 63% for the three Mab combination was not observed. the 263K-infected brain homogenate displayed the 3 band pattern typical for the multiple glycosylated forms of PrPC and PrPSc. the sPMCA40 products in the positive controls consisted of only a single diglycosylated 30 kDa PrPSc band observed after PK digestion at the higher levels of inhibition. Mabs 7E4, 10E4, 11F12, 8E11, and 8E9 completely inhibited the conversion process at 50 g/ml while Mabs 1B11 and 2F7 inhibited the conversion process to a lesser degree. the inhibition caused by the Mabs was a specific response since sPMCA40 studies replacing Mabs with purified normal mouse IgG did not cause any inhibition of PrPSc formation. a separate study using sPMCA40 showed that Mabs 3F4 and 5D6 caused complete inhibition of PrPSc formation at 12\u201350 g/ml. compared to other antibodies in this study, Mabs 3F4 and 5D6 had the most pronounced effects on PrPSc formation. many compounds efficient in in vitro studies were only effective in animal models if treatment was begun before or close to the time of inoculation with the infectious agent. many of the candidate compounds have limited usefulness clinically due to toxicity or their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier [e.g. Congo red [45], iododoxorubicin, -sheet breakers] es Mab 6H4 is resistant to prion infection via IP injection. previous studies have reported that the 132\u2013140 portion of PrPC [8] or the 132\u2013156 region of PrP [50]\u2013[53] are important for the generation of PrPSc. we screened Mabs produced in our laboratory for their capacity to inhibit PrPSc formation. this screening was performed using N2a/22L cells and cell-free sPMCA. the ability to inhibit PrPC to PrPSc conversion was not restricted to a single epitope or limited to a specific region of the protein. anti-PrP antibodies targeting different regions of PrP may have therapeutic effect in vitro. but it is not clear how this relates to their efficacy in vivo. only partial inhibition of conversion is required in vivo allowing cells to \"recover\""}
