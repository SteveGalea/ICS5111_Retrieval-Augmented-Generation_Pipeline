{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), EBOV, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are highly infectious zoonotic viruses. they are the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (7), severe acute hemorrhagic fever (EBOV) (8), and fatal encephalitis (9, 10). the first antiviral drug to be approved for treating HIV, zidovudine (AZT), is also a nucleoside analog that blocks reverse transcriptase (20) the second class of antivirals includes inhibitors of viral proteases, which are involved in the processing of viral proteins required for the final viral assembly and release. the use of these neuraminidase inhibitors is restricted to neuraminidase-containing viruses. the use of these neuraminidase inhibitors is restricted to neuraminidase-containing viruses. a high-throughput screening assay (HTSA) optimized in our laboratory. assays of different pseudotypes bearing SARS-CoV-S, EBOV-GP, HeV-G and -F, NiV-G and -F, and vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) glycoproteins were synthesized and labeled on the N terminus with 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) as a light quencher. OV-GP-, HeV-F0-, NiV-F0-, host pro-NPY-, and host pep F-derived labeled and unlabeled peptides (1 M) were incubated with 1 g/ml of human CatL (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 4 mM EDTA and 8 the EBOV-GP, HeV-F0, NiV-F0, MHV-S, host pro-NPY, and host pep F peptides were tested by incubating 1 M peptide with different concentrations of CatL (0.25, 0.5, and 1 g/ml) the rate of the reaction was measured from the slope of the curve. inhibited cleavage of EBOV-GP, SARS-CoV-S, HeV, NiV, and VSV-G were screened in duplicates. pCAGG expression plasmids coding for G (15 g) and F (5 g) protein of HeV or NiV were transfected. different pseudotyped viruses (EBOV-GP, SARS-CoV-S, and VSV-G as a negative control) were added to 293FT cells in the presence of a 10 M concentration of the candidate inhibitory small molecules identified in the HTS. on the following morning, the medium was changed, and 4 h later, the cells were treated. 293FT cells were seeded at a density of 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. luciferase expression was determined using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) the small-molecule concentration was plotted against the percent inhibition of viral entry. 100 l of 10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl was added to each well with vigorous mixing and further incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. the optical density (OD) was measured at 595 nm, and the percent viability was calculated relative to the untreated control. the cytotoxicity was measured at 72 h postincubation as described above. a cDNA encoding the SARS-CoV-S ectodomain (amino acids 12 to 1184) was amplified using the pcDNA3.1-S expression plasmid, expressing full-length SARS-CoV-S protein, as a template. the forward primer with a 5\u2032 NheI 6His tag and a reverse primer with a 5\u2032 BamHI Flag tag were used in the PCR. purified recombinant SARS-CoV-S protein was incubated for 4 h with 2 g/ml catL. cleavage was detected by Western blotting using anti-Flag mouse monoclonal antibody. 293FT cells were transfected with the human SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 plasmid alone (1 g) or with the receptor plus increasing amounts of transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2) protease plasmid (10 to 800 ng) the entry was quantified by measuring the luciferase expression, as relative light units (RLU), in cell lysates. the catB inhibitor supplied in the kit was used as a control at concentrations of 10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 M. 293FT cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mM) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) (Invitrogen), minimal essential medium (MEM) nonessential amino acids (In amino acids 674 to 683) (28), EBOV (GP, amino acids 196 to 205) (29), HeV (F0, amino acids 105 to 114) (13, 31), host pro-neuropeptide Y (pro-NPY) (amino acids 34 to 43) (32), and host peptide F (Pep F) (amino acids 1 to 10) (33) containing the CatL cleavage sites were synthesized and labele high-throughput screening assay (HTSA) used in this study is a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay. the labeled SARS-CoV-S protein-derived peptide was used as a substrate in the primary screen. a library of 5,000 small molecules was tested in duplicates for inhibiting catL-mediated cleavage of viral peptides. the top 50 hits that inhibited the cleavage of EBOV-GP, HeV-F0, and NiV-F0 were screened in duplicates for the inhibition of cleavage of peptides. pCAGG expression plasmids coding for G (15 g) and F (5 g) protein of HeV or NiV were transfected with HIV vectors. different pseudotyped viruses (EBOV-GP, SARS-CoV-S, and VSV-G as a negative control) were added to 293FT cells in presence of 10 M concentration of candidate inhibitory small molecules identified in the HTS. the small molecule 5705213 and its derivative 7402683 were used at a final concentration of 100 M during both pseudotyped virus preparation and transduction. seventy-two hours later, cells were lysed and the luciferase expression was determined using a luciferase assay kit. cathepsin L inhibitor III (catalog no. 219427; Calbiochem) was used as a control. 293FT cells were seeded at a density of 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. the cells were treated with different concentrations (10, 30, 50, and 100 M) of the selected small molecule. a cDNA encoding the SARS-CoV-S ectodomain (amino acids 12 to 1184) was amplified using the pcDNA3.1-S expression plasmid expressing full-length SARS-CoV-S protein as a template. the forward primer with a 5\u2032 NheI 6His tag and a reverse primer with a 5\u2032 BamHI Flag tag were used in the PCR. the recombinant plasmid with His-S-Flag DNA was transformed into DE3 BL21 cells. the cells were induced, at an OD of 0.8, with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside) for 2 h. the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (80 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 15% SDS, 0.006% bromophenol blue 293FT cells were plated at a density of 2 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. they were transfected with 2 g of Nipah or Hendra virus F0 expression plasmid. the cells were lysed 48 h later using a lysis buffer. the entry was quantified by measuring the luciferase expression, as relative light units (RLU), in cell lysates. all inhibitors were used at a 10 M concentration except the small molecule 5705213. control at concentrations of 10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 M. peptides composed of 10 amino acids derived from the glycoproteins of viruses and human pro-neuropeptide Y and peptide F were synthesized in the protein research laboratory at UIC. the peptide derived from MHV-S glycoprotein was used as a negative control. EBOV-GP protein-derived peptide (amino acids 196 to 205); EBOV-GP fusion protein (F0)-derived peptide (amino acids 105 to 114); EBOV-GP fusion protein (F0)-derived peptide (amino acids 105 to 114); human pro-neuropeptide Y (pro-NPY)-derived peptide (amino acids 34 to 43); f-derived cathepsin L (0.5 g/ml) was incubated with 1 M labeled SARS-CoV-derived peptide at RT. fluorescence emitted was measured over time compared to that for untreated peptide (16 replicates each) mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) glycoprotein (S)-derived peptide was used as a control. 12 small molecules out of 50 showed inhibition of cleavage of all viral peptides relative to a much lower level of inhibition of the cleavage of the pro-NPY-derived peptide.

SARS-CoV-S-Flag protein was incubated with 0.5, 1 and 2 g/ml of catL for 4 h at RT. the control (Ctrl) lane represents the S-Flag protein in the absence of the enzyme and inhibitor. catL inhibitor I was used as a positive control of inhibition. Nipah and Hendra virus fusion (F0) proteins are inhibited by the small molecules 5705213 and 7402683. a combination of the small molecule 5705213 and a TMPRSS2 inhibitor can more dramatically inhibit pseudotyped virus entry. a 1.5-fold increase in pseudotyped virus entry into 293FT cells expressing ACE2 receptor with or without TMPRSS2. however, the viral entry decreased upon increasing the amount of TMPRSS2 expression. this may be due to the nonspecific proteolytic effect of highly expressed TMPRSS2 protease. small molecule 5705213, a commercial protease inhibitor (camostat) and a combination of both in 293FT cells expressing human ACE2, were able to inhibit the entry by 75 and 60%, respectively, in the absence of the TMPRSS2. the protease inhibitor inhibited the entry by 48%, while a combination of our small molecule and the protease inhibitor completely blocked the entry of pseudotypes bearing SARS-CoV-S. 1/V = Km + [S]/Vmax[S] = Km/Vmax 1/[S] + 1/Vmax. different concentrations (2 to 64 M) of labeled peptides were incubated with 0.5 g/ml of catL in the presence or absence of the small molecule 5705213. 5705213 is a mixed enzyme inhibitor and has more affinity to free enzyme than to enzyme-substrate complex. small molecule 5705213 and its derivative 7402683 inhibited cathepsin B activity by 16.4% and 38%, respectively, at a 50 M concentration. inhibitions observed for CatB were lower than those for CatL at the same concentrations of the small molecules. inhibition of catB activity was compared to inhibition of catL activity against SARS-CoV-S-derived peptide in the presence of a 50 to 200 M concentration of the small molecules 5705213 and 7402683. the catL inhibitor III and CatB inhibitor were used as controls in the catL and catB assays. all labeled and unlabeled peptides were cleaved at the expected sites. the fluorophores did not affect the catL-mediated cleavage. the cleavage was measured in the form of increased fluorescence over time. cathepsin L (0.5 g/ml) was incubated with 1 M labeled SARS-CoV-derived peptide at RT. the fluorescence emitted was measured over time compared to that for untreated peptide (16 replicates each) the validity of the assay was determined based on the Z factor. the validity of the HTSA for small-molecule screening was reconfirmed using the means and standard deviation of positive and negative values. this yielded a Z factor value of 0.61 and confirmed the reliability of the catL-mediated cleavage inhibition assay. the top 50 hits were tested for their ability to inhibit catL-mediated cleavage of viral peptides. 92 14.40 1.34 5.3 7793889 3.4 51.07 7.77 76.53 6.1 7951692 10.2 16.58 0.34 14.51 0.7 7950181 8.6 6.45 9.26 8.55 7.0 7888659 66.9 80.96 73.49 79.93 64.8 7808526 9.6 40.80 4.08 69.24 1.2 6572698 34.0 31.81 7.92 65.51 12.1 5182554 11.6 HTSA-selected inhibitors differentially inhibit host cell entry of pseudotyped viruses. nine uncolored small molecules out of 50 showed higher inhibitions of viral peptide cleavage while minimally inhibiting the cleavage of pro-NPY-derived peptide. small molecules 7910528, 7914021, 5705213, and 51825554 showed 23.3% and 30.3%, 51.5% and 27.1%, 39.8% and 64.7%, and 60.45% and 49.3% inhibition of EBOV-GP and SARS-CoV-S glycoprotein-bearing pseudotypes. compound 5705213 methyl-N-[4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]-N-cyanoglycinate (D) and (E) its derivative 7402683 methyl-N-[4-(tert-butylamino)-6-(ethylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]-N-cyanoglycinate (D) and small molecules 7914021 and 5182554 were found to be toxic to the 293FT cells when treated at concentrations of 10 M or above. cytotoxicity increased over the next 2 days even at a 10 M concentration. small molecules 5705213 did not show significant cytotoxic effects on the 293FT cells. the commercial cathepsin L inhibitor III showed IC50s of 5 and 7 M against EBOV-GP and ARS-CoV-S pseudotypes. the CC50s for the small molecule 5705213, its derivative, and the commercial CatL inhibitor III were found to be 400 M, 350 M, and 420 M, respectively. the calculated SI for CatL inhibitor III were 84 and 60 against EBOV-GP and EBOV-GP pseudotyped viruses. small molecule 5705213 and its derivative 7402683 were tested for dose-dependent inhibition of the entry of pseudotypes bearing SARS-CoV-S and EBOV-GP. the concentration causing 50% entry inhibition was determined from the linear portion of the curve. small molecule 5705213 and its derivative 7402683 inhibit in vitro catL-mediated cleavage of recombinant protein. small molecules 5705213 and 7402683 inhibit endogenous processing of Nipah and Hendra virus fusion glycoproteins and entry of pseudotyped viruses. both molecules and catL inhibitor I inhibited the entry of pseudotyped viruses into 293FT cells by 80 to 100%. as expected, the VSV-G pseudotyped virus entry was unaffected by the small molecules 5705213. a combination of the small molecule 5705213 and a TMPRSS2 inhibitor can more dramatically inhibit pseudotyped virus entry. the transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to activate the entry of several viruses, including influenza virus (39, 40), MERS-CoV (41), respiratory parainfluenza virus (42), and human coronavirus 229E (43) and SARS-CoV natural infection and entry Error bars are SD from a representative experiment performed using triplicates. entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV into 293FT cells transfected with either the ACE2 receptor plasmid or receptor plus 10 ng of TMPRSS2 plasmid. small molecule 5705213 may be used in combination with a commercial protease inhibitor. the small molecule 5705213 is a mixed inhibitor for catL. the lineweaver-Burk plot provides a graphical way for analysis. peptide (A), labeled Ebola virus-derived peptide (B), labeled Hendra virus-derived peptide (C) and labeled Nipah virus-derived peptide (D) were incubated with 0.5 g/ml of catL for 40 min in the presence or absence of the small molecule 5705213. the reaction was stopped with 0.5 M acetic acid, after which the fluorescence was measured at 535 nm inhibition was 43.5% and 65%, respectively, at a 200 M concentration. the inhibitions observed for CatB were lower than those for CatL at the same concentrations of the small molecules (ranging from 64 to 95%) HTSA developed a small molecule that could inhibit the entry of pseudotyped viruses into mammalian cells by blocking the cleavage of the viral glycoproteins. oxocarbazate blocks human catL, thus inhibiting the entry of pseudotypes bearing SARS-CoV-S or EBOV-GP glycoproteins into human embryonic kidney 293T cells. a lower binding affinity of CatL to viral peptides than to host peptides could be responsible for the selective inhibition of catL cleavage of viral proteins. this was further validated by testing the cleavage of viral, host peptide F, and pro-NPY peptides using different catL concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1 g/ml) small molecules inhibited the entry of pseudotypes bearing the EBOV-GP and SARS-CoV-S but not the entry of VSV-G pseudotyped virus. a complete inhibition of SARS-CoV entry should involve blockage of both pathways. the type of the inhibitor is determined based on the change in enzyme reaction parameters (Vmax and Km) for competitive enzyme inhibitors, there is an increase in Km and no change in Vmax. a mixed enzyme inhibitor causes an increase in Km and a decrease in Vmax."}
