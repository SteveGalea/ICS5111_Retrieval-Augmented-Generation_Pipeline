{"summary": "acute pharyngitis is defined as an infection of the pharynx and/or tonsils. it is a very common pathology among children and adolescents. group A Streptococcus causes 37% of cases of acute pharyngitis in children over 5 years. anterior cervical nodes swollen or enlarged 55-82 34-73 Headache 48 50-80 Myalgia 49 60 Palatine petechiae 7 95 Pharyngeal exudates 26 88 Fever >38\u00b0C 22-58 52-92 Tonsillar exudate 36 85 The onset of viral pharyngitis may be more gradual. nonsuppurative complications include cervical lymphadenitis, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, otitis media, mastoiditis and sinusitis. not suppurative, immune-mediated sequelae are acute rheumatic fever (ARF), acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, Sydenham chorea, reactive arthritis and Paediatric Autoimm in the united states, the number of ARF cases has fallen dramatically over the last half century. a national study found that the incidence was 14.8 cases per 100,000 hospitalized children. the diagnosis of pharyngitis can be done by a throat culture or rapid diagnostic test for GABHS (RADT) pharyngitis is an infection that need to be recognised and treated to avoid complications, first of all ARF. one position, followed by UK [19], Scottish [20], Dutch [21] and Belgian [22] authors, considers pharyngitis, even GABHS one, a benign self limiting disease. clinical criteria Points Absence of cough 1 Swollen and tender anterior cervical nodes 1 Temperature > 38\u00b0C 1 Tonsillar exudate or swelling 1 Age 3 to 14 years 1 Age 15 to 44 years 0 Age 45 years and older. if Centor 2, no further investigations and no treatment are required. most of the american authors suggest the necessity of a microbiological confirmation for the diagnosis of GABHS. a laboratory test (culture or RADT) should be performed. adult patients with a Centor score 4 should be treated without needing microbiological confirmation. the need to confirm negative RADT results with a throat culture is advised also by American Academy of Pediatrics. the need to confirm negative RADT results with a throat culture should be performed in both adults and children. if RADT is negative, it should be performed in both adults and children. Emilia Romagna suggests to perform a RADT when Centor score 2. if RADT is positive then antibiotic treatment should be started. if RADT is negative then a throat culture should be performed. 800 000 (500 mg) 2 to 3 times daily 10 days Amoxicillin (oral) 50 mg/kg once daily (maximum 1 g) 10 days Benzathin Penicillin G (intramuscular) cochrane review on 20 studies involving a total number of 13,102 cases of acute GABHS has been published in 2009. authors compared short duration therapy (three to six days) of oral antibiotics to standard duration treatment. they found that short duration treatment presented lower risk of early clinical treatment failure. overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in short duration treatment. casey and Pichichero conducted a meta-analysis of 9 RCTs involving 2113 adult patients with GABHS pharyngitis. they indicated that the likelihood of a bacteriologic and clinical cure of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis in adults is significantly higher after 10 days of therapy with an oral cephalosporin. they also conducted a meta-analysis of RCT's of cephalosporin versus penicillin treatment of GABHS phary pharyngitis of proved bacterial etiology should receive an antibiotic treatment. penicillin V is the first choice drug, but an oral suspension is not available in Italy. macrolides are not indicated in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis."}
