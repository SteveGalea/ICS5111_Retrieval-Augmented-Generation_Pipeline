{"summary": "recent advances in incretin-based drugs have opened new avenues in the management of diabetes. in the clinic, we can prescribe two types of incretin-based drugs: glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. GLP-1 is produced from intestinal L-cells by proteolytical processing from prog. autophagy defects in certain diseases have been the subject of extensive research. liver autophagy defects have been shown to occur with several metabolic diseases. incretin hormones and DPP-4 inhibitors have been associated with the amelioration of steatosis. enteroendocrine cells (L-cells) in the intestinal mucosa, islet cells in the pancreas, and some neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) regulation of the Gcg transcription process is not completely known. posttranslational processing of prohormone plays an important role in the major cell types producing ProG peptides. proglucagon gene encodes proglucagon, which is processed in a tissue-specific manner. in pancreatic cells, glucagon is synthesized from proglucagon because PC2 is dominantly expressed. in enteroendocrine cells dominantly express PC1/3, ultimately synthesizing GLPs. ase A inhibits salt-inducible kinases (SIK) ase A (PKA) and inhibits salt-inducible kinases (SIK) ase A (PKA) phosphorylates Ser133 of cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and SIK dephosphorylates Ser171 of CREB-regulated transcription co-activator (CRTC) hepatic lysosomal volume density and plasma glucagon were observed in rats with type 1 diabetes induced by streptozotocin. insulin intervention in these rats led to suppression of glucose and glucagon levels. pancreatic transplantation normalized liver autophagy levels in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. exendin-4, an agonistic polypeptide for human GLP-1R derived from the venom of the Gila monster lizard, has also been shown to enhance lysosomal function in -cells. cells from rats administered Exendin-4 showed a reduction in the number of autophagosomes. however, the role of GLP-1 in -cell autophagy is complex and likely dependent on stress conditions. the presence of GLP-1R is controversial in hepatocytes. some effects of GLP-1 are indeed GLP-1R-independent events. the presence of GLP-1 is controversial in hepatocytes. a series of experiments provided evidence that a GLP-1 agonist ameliorated hepatic steatosis and metabolic defects. such antisteatotic and metabolic effects of GLP-1 on the liver could involve AMPK activation and suppression of mTOR pathways. LP-1 agonists have been shown to reduce oxidative stress in diverse preclinical studies. oxidative stress accelerates a variety of disease conditions, such as diabetes and its complications, cancer, and neuronal disorders. cellular defense systems for combatting reactive oxygen species rely on the presence of antioxidants that scavenge ROS. athione S-transferase, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit and heme oxygenase 1 binds with the SQSTM1 and KEAP1 complexes. sestrin 2, also known as an intracellular leucine sensor, functions as a scaffold protein for the SQSTM1-mediated autophagy of KEAP1. some preclinical studies have shown a potential link between DPP-4 inhibition and autophagy induction. sitagliptin increased AMPK phosphorylation and decreased mTOR phosphorylation associated with the restoration of ATG5 and Beclin 1 messenger RNA expression. gliptin inhibited the Beclin-1-Bcl-2 interaction and enhanced both LC3-II protein and autophagosomes in the non-infarcted region in OLETF rats without normalization of either AMPK/ULK-1 or mTOR/S6 signaling. chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, diminished these beneficial effects of vildagliptin. integrins display physical interaction with several extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins (such as collagens, fibronectins, and laminins) and cellular receptors. integrins are essential molecules in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and in regulating cell signals that regulate biological and cellular functions. integrin 1 has the biological function of a \u201chub integrin\u201d and acts as a receptor for specific ECM components. loss of membrane-bound DPP-4 has been associated with suppression of the phosphorylation of integrin 1 S785, which plays a key role in the cellular adhesion of integrin 1 to the ECM. autophagy was inhibited by either RNA interference or harboring of oncogenes. integrin 1 is important for focal adhesion complexes. autophagy also targets and inhibits focal adhesion complexes. the molecules described in this review could be notable for their significance in autophagy induction by bariatric surgery. gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GB) are the most common surgical procedures in bariatric surgery. glucagon responses after total pancreatectomy were present in animals. the most challenging point was that until recently, analytical methods for glucagon have not been sufficiently sensitive or specific to justify decisive statements about the absence or presence of extrapancreatic fully processed glucagon. after total pancreatectomy, nutrients are rerouted and delivered directly from the stomach to the jejunum in a manner similar to bariatric surgery. glucagon levels in patients without a pancreas exhibited a lower trend, and glucose challenge of the gastrointestinal tract exerted significant hyperglucagonemia. postoperative elevation of incretin hormone, especially GLP-1 levels, leads to pancreatic -cell hypertrophy. such -cell hypertrophy stimulates insulin secretion and hypoglycemic symptoms. hypoglycemia most frequently occurred in patients who underwent resection of parts of the stomach. et al. (1985) reported faster intestinal transit time and increased enteroglucagon levels in patients with greater weight loss compared to weight-stable patients. the term \u201centeroglucagon\u201d in this report did not necessarily include \u201cglucagon\u201d because of cross reaction with several glucagon sequence-containing polypeptides. Lund et al. (2016) studied patients who underwent total pancreatectomy. they analyzed plasma glucagon levels in a manner similar to bariatric surgery. the findings suggest that alteration in glucagon secretion could be induced by bariatric surgery. late dumping syndrome, a well-known hypoglycemic event, occurs 2\u20133 h after a meal, after gastric surgery, and as a complication after surgery for obesity. hypothesized that postoperative elevation of incretin hormone leads to pancreatic -cell hypertrophy. such -cell hypertrophy stimulates insulin secretion and hypoglycemic symptoms. changes in the gastrointestinal tract that induces food to bypass the intestine would be relevant to the induction of autophagy via secretion of GLP-1 and/or glucagon. authors KK concept, design, and major contribution to writing the manuscript."}
