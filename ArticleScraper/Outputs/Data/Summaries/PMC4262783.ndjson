{"summary": "LCMV infection induces iDCs in the liver. we first infected wild-type mice with 2x106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of LCMV strain WE. we found that MHC-II+ CD45+ cells infiltrate the liver between days 4 and 6. some of the CD11c+ cells expressed iNOS (Figure 1b) on day 0, 4 and 6, livers were analyzed using histology for expression of CD11c and iNOS. iDCs were reduced in liver tissue of Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice. iDCs were reduced in liver tissue of Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice. toso was previously shown to influence signaling of IgM and CD95.17, 23, 24. we analyzed mice that were deficient in soluble IgM (sIgM\u2013/\u2013 mice) and Fas (Faslpr/lpr mice), suggesting that either of the signal was responsible for the lack of iDCs observed in the liver of Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice. iDCs in mice that received WT bone marrow were all of CD45.1 origin. iDCs in mice which received Toso\u2013/\u2013 bone marrow were all of CD45.2 origin. iDCs were reduced in mice reconstituted with Toso\u2013/\u2013 bone marrow. mice were irradiated and reconstituted with bone marrow from either CD45.1+ WT mice, CD45.2+ Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice or with a 1 : 1 mixture of WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 bone marrow. the total number of inflammatory DCs from the liver derived from CD45.1+ WT bone marrow is shown from WT>WT chimeras (black), Toso\u2013/\u2013>WT chimera to test the effect of Toso on the activation of DCs, we generated bone marrow DCs in vitro and activate them 9 days later with LPS. to validate the capacity of Toso\u2013/\u2013 DCs to activate CD8+ T cells and induce co-stimulatory signals in vivo, we injected in vitro-generated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. toso\u2013/\u2013 DCs showed reduced phosphorylation of NF-B p65. phosphorylation of p38 and ERK was not affected by the absence of Toso. interleukin-6 was analyzed in the supernatant following 20 h stimulation with the indicated concentrations of LPS. dendritic cells were generated from bone marrow cells cultured with 400 ng/ml GM-CSF. 10 days later, dendritic cells were incubated with GP33, GP276 and GP61 with or without addition of CpG (5 M) to analyze the direct impact of DCs on CD8+ T cells in the liver, we performed adoptive transfer experiments of WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 DCs into WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice. transfer of WT DCs enhanced the frequency of LCMV-GP33-specific CD8+ T cells in WT mice. livers were analyzed for host CD8+ T cells, donor T cells (CD45.1+) and iDCs (Ly6C+CD11c+) on day 6. WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice were infected with 2 x 106 PFU of LCMV-WE. T cells in the spleen of Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice showed reduced expression of PD-1, CXCR3 and higher expression of IL7R. this indicates that iDCs contribute to continuous activation and expansion of antiviral T cells. this indicates that iDCs contribute to continuous activation and expansion of antiviral T cells. the CD8+ T cells in the spleen and liver were analyzed by flow cytometry using the markers PD-1, CXCR3 and IL7R-. black line shows expression in CD8+ T cells of virus-infected WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice (a, n=3\u20136) toso\u2013/\u2013 mice generated a functional CD8+ T-cell response. this suggests a specific role for Toso on the immune response during LCMV infection. livers were removed and analyzed using histology for expression of LCMV-NP, the pan leukocyte marker CD45, MHC-II and CD11c. on day 0, 4 and 6, livers were analyzed using histology for expression of CD11c and iNOS (one representative of n=5 is shown). c) Livers from uninfected (naive) mice and day 6 infected mice were digested and cell suspensions were stained for CD8, iDCs were reduced in liver tissue of Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice compared with WT animals. CD8+ T cells on day 6 were comparable between WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice. toso was previously shown to influence signaling of IgM and CD95.17, 23, 24. dot plots show expression of CD11b and CD8. expression of Ly6C and CD11c for cells gated on CD11b. iDC expression regulates differentiation of iDCs. marrow showed a reduced proportion of iDCs of Toso\u2013/\u2013 (CD45.2) origin. no difference was observed in numbers of blood monocytes of WT (CD45.1) or Toso\u2013/\u2013 (CD45.2) origin. bone marrow is shown from WT>WT chimeras (black), Toso\u2013/\u2013>WT chimeras (white) and WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013>WT chimeras (gate CD45.1=blue; gate CD45.2=red) Toso is critical for maturation of functional DCs in vitro Next, we determined whether our in vivo phenotype was reproducible in vitro. derived dendritic cells of WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice into RIP-GP animals after pulsing with the LCMV peptides (GP33, GP276, and GP61) induction of diabetes depends on induction of auto-reactive CD8+ T cells. in contrast, Toso\u2013/\u2013 DCs could not induce diabetes in RIP-GP mice. the MFI of CD80 and CD86 was analyzed on cells gated for CD11c at the indicated time points (c, n=6). interleukin-6 was analyzed in the supernatant following 20 h stimulation with the indicated concentrations of LPS. to analyze the direct impact of DCs on CD8+ T cells in the liver, we performed adoptive transfer experiments of WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 DCs into WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice. transfer of WT DCs enhanced the frequency of LCMV-GP33-specific CD8+ T cells in WT mice. an LCMV-specific T-cell receptor transgenic mouse (P14 mouse expressing CD45.1) were injected intravenously into CD45.2+ WT and Toso\u2013/\u2013 recipient mice on day 1. livers were analyzed for host CD8+ T cells, donor T cells (CD45.1+) and iDCs (Ly6C+CD11c+) on day 6. cell death-1 (PD-1), CXCR3 and reduced expression of IL7R. CD8+ T cells in the spleen of Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice showed reduced expression of PD-1, CXCR3 and higher expression of IL7R. this suggests strong T-cell activation in WT animals. toso deficiency alters CD8+ T-cell-dependent virus control and immunopathology. the CD8+ T cells in the spleen and liver were analyzed by flow cytometry. iDCs in the liver impact the CD8+ T-cell response only under very specific conditions. Toso\u2013/\u2013 mice generated a functional CD8+ T-cell response. this suggests a specific role for Toso on the immune response during LCMV infection. o may be disadvantageous for the host following infection with a cytopathic virus-like influenza. the presence or absence of virally induced pathology following infection with persistent low cytopathic viruses such as LCMV and hepatitis viruses can differ between individuals. toso expression promotes functional maturation and activation of iDCs within virus-infected tissue. sIgM\u2013/\u2013 mice lacking soluble IgM and Faslpr/lpr mice lacking FAS signaling were kept on C57BL/6 background. mice were infected with 2 106 PFUs LCMV-WE. recombinant Listeria expressing the LCMV-GP33 epitope was used. mice were irradiated with 10.5 Gy. anti-iNOS antibody was purchased from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA, USA) ALT levels were measured using a serum multiple biochemical analyzer. Western blot and ELISA Proteins were isolated with trizol and solubilized with 10 M urea/50 mM DTT. protein lysates were normalized for total protein. statistically significant differences between treatment groups were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with post-testing according to Bonferroni or Dunnett. sIgM\u2013/\u2013 mice lacking soluble IgM and Faslpr/lpr mice were kept on C57BL/6 background. mice were isolated with either WT (CD45.1) bone marrow, Toso\u2013/\u2013(CD45.2) bone marrow or with a 1 : 1 mixture of WT (CD45.1) and Toso\u2013/\u2013(CD45.2) bone marrow. after 50 days, mice were infected with LCMV and analyzed 6 days post-infection. protein lysates were normalized for total protein (Bio-Rad) membranes were stained with antibodies against p-p65, p-p38, p-ERK and actin. surface and intracellular FACS staining was performed as previously described. more than one analysis time point were calculated using two-way ANOVA. P-values 0.05 were considered statistically significant."}
