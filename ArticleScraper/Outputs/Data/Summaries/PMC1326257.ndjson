{"summary": "the metric of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost takes into account the amount of otherwise healthy life lost to morbidity and/or mortality. diseases were categorized according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) from WHO. infections caused the loss of 2,983 DALYs/100,000 population in the poorest regions compared to 137 DALYs/100,000 population in the wealthiest. poverty is associated with a more than 20-fold increase in the relative burden of lung infections. Lung infections caused the loss of 535 DALYs per 100,000 population in the \u201cLower Middle Income\u201d population in 2002. the vast majority (86%) of the difference due to income occurs between the lowest income group and the next-to-lowest income group. lung infections in wealthy countries seem poised to become even more of a concern in the near future. for several reasons, lung infections in wealthy countries seem poised to become even more of a concern. advancing age makes lung infections more prevalent and life-threatening. the NIH spent approximately US$28 billion on health-related research in 2004 [13], of which US$287 million was allocated to lung infections. this is substantive and laudable, but it must be considered in perspective. more NIH money is spent on smallpox research (US$324 million) alone. the majority of requested funds in the president's plan, more than US$5.3 billion, would be slated for the manufacture, purchase, and stockpile of vaccines and antivirals against influenza. an additional US$0.8 billion would be allocated for research on new vaccines and antivirals against influenza, and US$0.6 billion for influenza preparedness planning. smallpox eradication is a powerful illustration of the potential of such an approach. the idea of fighting against a specific microbe is attractive, and such an \u201cus-against-them\u201d mentality is effective at mobilizing commitments. a strategy focused on microbes is destined to be a game of catch-up. forward-thinking strategies might be directed at determinants of respiratory tract exposure, innate immune defenses against microbes in the lungs, and inflammatory injury resulting from lung infection. advances will provide opportunities both to combat ongoing public health crises and to limit the potential threat from emerging pathogens."}
