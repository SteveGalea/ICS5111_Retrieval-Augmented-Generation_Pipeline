{"summary": "arenaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses containing a single-stranded genome. the L segment codes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the small matrix protein (Z), while the S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N) and a glycoprotein precursor (GPC) some members of this family cause hemorrhagic fever disease in humans. the main components of the ERK1/2 cascade are three sequentially acting kinases: Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. ERK1/2 pathway plays a relevant role in the replication of several viruses and the regulation of innate immune response against viral infections. cells, Viruses, and Compounds Vero cells were grown in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (MEM). BSR cells (a clone of BHK-21 cells) were grown using Glasgow minimum essential medium (GMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (NBCS) and gentamicin (50 g/mL) monoclonal antibody (mAb) QC03-BF11 [24] was used as primary antibody in immunofluorescence assays. mouse anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used as secondary antibody. untranslated region (UTR) of the human -globin mRNA and a poly(A) tract flanking the FLUC ORF have been previously constructed. plasmid pRLUC expresses the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. 2.6. Viral Uncoating Assay Vero cells were infected with 100 PFU of JUNV for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. cultures were washed with citric buffer (pH = 3.0) for 1 min. cells were washed with citric buffer (pH = 3.0) for 1 min to eliminate non-internalized virions. cell monolayers were washed three times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) cells were incubated with primary antibodies during 60 min at 37 \u00b0C. after three washes with PBS cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 reagent (1 g/mL) cells were treated for 30 min at acid pH (MEM pH 5.0) at 24 h post-infection (p.i.) cells were fixed with methanol at room temperature for 15 min and then stained with Giemsa 0.1% in PBS for 15 min. the number and size of syncytia for each sample were calculated by counting at least 300 nuclei from 20 random selected fields. average viral RNA Ct values were normalized to the average Ct values of actin (Ct = Ct virus Ct actin) and Ct (Ct untreated cultures Ct drug-treated cultures) based fold change calculations were set using Bio-Rad iQ5 2.1 software. the virus-like mRNA (5\u2032wt/3\u2032wt_2) comprises the viral 5\u2032UTR fused to the reporter FLUC open reading frame followed by the viral 3\u2032UTR. the cell-like -Glo/poly(A) transcript bears the 5\u2032UTR from human -globin, and a 53-nt 3\u2032poly(A) tail flanking the FLUC coding sequence. all experiments were performed in serum-free medium. the attenuated strain of JUNV (XJCl3) was handled at biosafety level 2 by trained personnel vaccinated with candid#1 live attenuated vaccine. peroxidase anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham; Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) or peroxidase anti-mouse Ig G (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as secondary antibodies. plasmid pMG-FLUC expresses a minigenome. Viral Internalization Assay Vero cells pre-incubated in MEM containing or not U0126 (15 M) during 30 min were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 PFU/cell in the presence or absence of U0126 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. after extensive washes, cells were lysed with 3 cycles of freezing and thawing, cell debris were removed by low speed centrifugation. western blot analysis JUNV infected Vero cells or BSR cells transfected or not with plasmids used for the replicon assay were treated with U0126 (15 M) cell viability was determined as the ability of living cells to cleave the tetrazolium salt MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) cell monolayers were washed three times with phosphate buffer saline. cells were incubated with primary antibodies during 60 min at 37 \u00b0C. cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 reagent (1 g/mL) and coverslips were mounted on a 90% glycerin solution in PBS containing 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane. quantitative RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Genbiotech; Antibes, France) and the detection of JUNV genomic S RNA by PCR was performed as previously described. cDNA was synthesized using the primer N (+) (5\u2032-GGCATCCTTCAGAACAT-3\u2032) and N (+) and SYBR Green (Fast Start Universal SYBR Green Master, Roche; Basel, Switzerland) plasmid pCMV-T7pol, 1.5 g of pTCRV N, 0.5 g of pTCRV L and 1.3 g of plasmid pMG-FLUC were omitted in control cell cultures. RLUC reporter vector pRL-TK (40 ng/well) was added to the transfection mix to estimate transfection efficiency. three hours later, the transfection mix was removed, cell monolayers were washed with GMEM and then incubated in GMEM containing or not U0126 (15 M) three hours later, cell monolayers were washed with GMEM and then incubated in GMEM containing or not U0126 (15 M), and incubation proceeded for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for different time periods in presence or absence of U0126 or chlorpromazine (CZ), an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. no significant differences in the kinetics of JUNV internalization were detected in treated cultures with respect to untreated ones. aNOVA (Tukey post-hoc test): ** p 0.01, *** p 0.001; (c) vero cells infected with JUNV for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C were incubated at 37 \u00b0C. uncoated viral particles were quantified by plaque assay.

ERK1/2 MAPKs are required for the expression of both the nucleoprotein and the viral envelope glycoproteins. cells were infected with JUNV (m.o.i. = 1) and U0126 (15 M) was added 2 h later. treatment with PMA, a known activator of the ERK1/2 pathway, strongly increased JUNV RNA synthesis as compared to untreated control. the genome S RNA (gSRNA) and the full-length antigenome S RNA (agSRNA), N mRNA, glycoprotein precursor (GPC) mRNA are depicted. plasmid expressing RLUC to control for transfection efficiency were removed after 4 h. plasmid expressing RLUC was removed after 4 h and cells were further incubated in the presence of U0126. the lack of cytotoxicity of U0126 treatment in transfected BSR cells was corroborated by the MTT method. the lack of cytotoxicity of U0126 in transfected BSR cells was also corroborated by the MTT method. eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a cell factor essential for the initiation step of protein translation, which is active in its hypophosphorylated state. eIF2 inhibition could be linked to increased phosphorylation of eIF2. the inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway did not induce changes in the amount of eIF2. the presence of U0126 did not affect the amount of JUNV infectious particles adsorbed to vero cells after 1 h incubation at 4 \u00b0C. the presence of U0126 did not affect the amount of JUNV infectious particles adsorbed to vero cells after 1 h incubation at 4 \u00b0C. cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for different time periods in presence or absence of U0126 or chlorpromazine (CZ), an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. no significant differences in the kinetics of JUNV internalization were detected in U0126 treated cultures. cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in the presence or absence of the inhibitors. at different time points, internalized virions were quantified by plaque assay. data are mean values SD. tectable amounts of phosphorylated ERK indicate that ERK1/2 MAPKs are involved in a post-entry step affecting N protein expression and viral production.

ERK1/2 MAPKs are required for the expression of both the nucleoprotein and the viral envelope glycoproteins. cells were infected with JUNV (m.o.i. = 1) and U0126 (15 M) was added 2 h later. treatment with PMA, a known activator of the ERK1/2 pathway, strongly increased JUNV RNA synthesis as compared to untreated control. the genome S RNA (gSRNA) and the full-length antigenome S RNA (agSRNA), N mRNA, glycoprotein precursor (GPC) mRNA are depicted. expressing RLUC to control transfection efficiency, were removed after 4 h. cells were further incubated in the presence of U0126. ERK detection was used as loading control. expression from plasmids that constitute the replicon system was not affected by the presence of the MEK inhibitor. the lack of cytotoxicity of U0126 treatment in transfected BSR cells was also corroborated by the MTT method. eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a cell factor essential for the initiation step of protein translation, which is active in its hypophosphorylated state. eIF2 phosphorylation in JUNV-infected cells was comparable to those in uninfected cultures. the inhibition of viral protein expression and RNA synthesis observed in uninfected or in JUNV infected cells would not be related to increased phosphorylation of eIF2 in host cells. eIF2 does not affect eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) phosphorylation. despite the lack of significant inhibitory effect of U0126 on virus-like mRNA translation, translation of the cell-like mRNA appeared to be moderately reduced in cells treated with the MEK inhibitor. however, this minor adverse effect would not seem relevant for cell translation efficiency. the lack of effect of U0126 on early steps of JUNV multiplication is in agreement with data obtained by marjuki et al. [41] in IVA infected cells. the requirement of NS1 phosphorylation for RNP transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has not been demonstrated. cytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are conserved in every mammalian arenavirus. cytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are conserved in every mammalian arenavirus. cytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are conserved in every mammalian arenavirus.
