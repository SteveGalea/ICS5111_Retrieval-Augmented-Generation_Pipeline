{"summary": "bat-borne viruses with pandemic potential have been identified as the origin of a number of recent human disease outbreaks. examples include the paramyxoviruses Nipah virus (NiV) in Malaysia and Bangladesh [1] and Hendra virus (HeV) in Australia [2] and the filoviruses Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg viruses (MARV) in africa [3]. studies of Pteropus bats in Australia and Asia found they could travel hundreds of kilometers between roosting sites. factors that affect the degree and rate of contact between animals and humans are important for spillover of any zoonotic emerging infectious disease. there is currently no confirmation of the presence of viruses with pandemic potential in bats in the EU. this should not be taken as proof of absence of such viruses, but rather that they have not been detected during surveillance of bat populations in the EU. previous studies have demonstrated the presence of similar viruses in EU bat populations. a risk assessment for the introduction of henipaviruses concluded there was a low level of risk from southern Asia, South-East Asia and Australia. a risk assessment for NiV establishing in Australia also identified a lack of relevant data in various areas, reflecting the high levels of uncertainty. studies suggest that human outbreaks are linked to one of two distinct Nipah virus strains; NiV-Malaysia or NiV-Bangladesh. pigs were implicated as amplifier hosts with viral isolates from both sick pigs and humans showing identical nucleotide sequences. studies in india and Bangladesh suggest the main risk factor is consumption of date palm sap [22,43,44] date palm sap is harvested from December through to March by cutting into the tree trunk and allowing the sap to flow overnight into an open clay pot. initial laboratory investigations at the time of the NiV outbreak in Siliguri (India) in 2001 did not identify an infectious agent. PCR products were more closely related to the Bangladesh strain (97.5% identity) than the Malaysia strain. there is no reported evidence of NiV outbreaks in humans emerging in other parts of India or in any other countries. 87% of the population tested positive for marburg antibodies working in the local gold mines. there has not been a direct food consumption transmission route reported for MARV. there has not been a direct food consumption transmission route reported for MARV. NiV is predominately associated with Asian fruit bats of the genus Pteropus. it has been suggested as the natural reservoir for henipaviruses. only a few studies have successfully isolated NiV virus from bats. testing for NiV in bat species tested Bangladesh [41,42,43,82] Antibodies [42,49] Pteropus giganteus India [46,83] Antibodies [84] P. giganteus, RNA, Antibodies [66] P. vampyrus Antibodies [36] P. hypomelanus Antibodies & RNA [85] P. hypomelanus (Antibodies only), P. vampyrus Singapore [86] - antibodies to henipaviruses were present in bats from all locations with henipavirus seroprevalences reported to be between 25%\u201385.7%, with an overall average of 41.6% [71]. however, the presence of infection on isolated islands suggested large population size and connectivity may not be responsible for viral persistence. MARV is now considered endemic in R. aegyptiacus bats in Gabon [76] there is little evidence for the potential of MARV to occur outside Africa at this point. there are reports of antibody or RNA evidence of MARV infection in bat species other than R. aegyptiacus. aegyptiacus are known to be present in Cyprus and Turkey. populations were found in the wild in Tenerife in the early 2000s. there is no reported evidence to suggest presence or absence of MARV in these populations. a study on active infection of MARV in a bat cave in Uganda found a higher prevalence in older juvenile bats (12.4%) than younger juveniles (2.65%) or adults (2.4%). older juvenile bats and non-breeding adult bats more likely to range further in migration (and hence spread disease to other hosts) red list website is used to determine the geographical range of those bat species known to have been naturally infected. there are a number of countries where bats have been identified as having the virus, but no human infection has been reported. if species serologically positive for henipaviruses are considered then M. daubentonii would be included and the geographical range would be much wider. henipavirus-related sequences ranging from 110 to 34,000 genome copies per 0.3 cm3 and 1.8 106 per mL of bat urine have been reported. henipavirus-related sequences ranging from 110 to 34,000 genome copies per 0.3 cm3 and 1.8 106 per mL of bat urine have been reported. high values of 50,000\u20131,500,000 TCID50/mL were obtained from liver, spleen and lung. 5\u2013100 TCID50/mL were obtained from multiple tissues including blood and intestines. seasonal pulses of MARV circulation in juvenile R. aegyptiacus bats coincide with periods of increased risk of human infection. a review of all human outbreaks of NiV between 1998 and 2009 found that, except for the initial event in Malaysia, all occurred in the first five months of the year [65] a longitudinal study in Thailand found the Bangladesh strain of NiV was dominant in the urine of P. lylei bats, with highest recovery of RNA in May. PCR data showed distinct oscillating pulses of MARV infection in older juvenile bats. these peaks coincided with the birthing seasons of the bats in the cave. it is not clear whether the oscillation peaks in juvenile bats coincide with other environmental/ecological factors affecting the bats. a laboratory study on persistence of henipaviruses found that they were sensitive to pH, temperature and desiccation. the study showed a 3\u20134 log10 inactivation of henipaviruses in fruit juice (lychee, pawpaw and mango) over three to four days. the half-life of the virus was 0.2 hours for pH 3.5 at 37 \u00b0C but 30.3 hours for pH 5 at 22 \u00b0C. \u00b0C was poorer, but some viruses remained viable for over a week. removal of viruses using conventional chlorine washing could give more than 3 log10 reduction, but was only 1 log10 for poliovirus. but these are non-enveloped viruses, and may have different survival properties to the enveloped filoviruses. there have been no reported incidences of human-human transmission. there have been no further acute human cases attributed to NiV-Malaysia since 1999. there have been regular seasonal outbreaks of NiV-Bangladesh since 2001. cases generally occur in areas near inland water, predominantly the Ganges. cases reported from 14 districts, more than in any other year. pattern suggests multiple small outbreaks in different regions. a study on aegyptiacus bats inoculated with the Hogan MARV strain did not detect virus in the faeces of infected bats. there has not been a direct food consumption transmission route reported for MARV. there has not been a direct food consumption transmission route reported for MARV. a seropositive result is strong evidence of historical exposure to a virus. there may be cross reactivity with related viruses, precluding exact identification of the virus to which exposure has occurred. there can be difficulties in using serological assays outside their original, validated scope. NiV RNA has also been detected in P. giganteus in India [66] and P. vampyrus and Rousettus amplexicaudatus in East Timor [58]. of particular interest to the EU is the identification of henipavirus antibodies in Myotis daubentonii in China [67]. henipaviruses were present in bats from all locations with henipavirus seroprevalences reported to be between 25%\u201385.7%, with an overall average of 41.6%. henipavirus seroprevalences were reported to be between 25%\u201385.7%, with an overall average of 41.6%. MARV is now considered endemic in R. aegyptiacus bats in Gabon. there is little evidence for the potential of MARV to occur outside Africa. there are reports of antibody or RNA evidence of MARV infection in bats. MARV RNA has also been reported in a pooled liver, spleen, lung extract from a female R. aegyptiacus fruit bat in 2007. there is no reported evidence to suggest presence (or absence) of MARV in these populations. aegyptiacus R. aegyptiacus, Hypsignathus monstrosus, Micropteropus pusillus, Epomops franqueti. initial infection was thought to be in Zimbabwe. fruit bat colonies in trees in Ghana have up to 1 million bats. prevalence may vary spatially within the colony. a period of time without a reported human case suggests that there may still be potential for a human case in the country itself, but the risk of import to the EU is extremely low. we do not consider serological positive results alone to be an indication of current viral presence in bats. the virus may be quantified in a number of ways including plaque-forming units (pfu), tissue culture infectious dose 50% units (TCID50) or number of genome copies. there are no published dose-response curves that convert pfu or TCID50 units in to risk of infection. toneal inoculation resulted in high levels detected in plasma (103 to 104 TCID50/mL) for five to nine days post inoculation, with titres up to 106.5 and 106.0 TCID50/g in the liver and spleen respectively. high values of 50,000\u20131,500,000 TCID50/mL were obtained from liver, spleen and lung whilst values of 5\u2013100 TCID50/mL were obtained from multiple tissues including por in infection dynamics is largely unstudied [97] por in infection dynamics is largely unstudied. torpor is key factor in allowing perpetuation of rabies virus through hibernation period, through prolonged incubation period and reduced mortality. migration and coloniality may also be important drivers of disease dynamics. the wild date palm produces sap seasonally from mid-October to mid-March and winter (December to early February) is the traditional date palm sap gathering season in Bangladesh. outbreaks of NiV generally coincide with this season, appearing between December and May. the delay between exposure to onset of illness ranged from 6\u201316 days. the delay between exposure to onset of illness ranged from 6\u201316 days. the incubation period following a single intake of raw date palm sap to onset of illness varied between 2\u201312 days, with a median of seven days. poliovirus, simian rotavirus and feline calicivirus were found in the uk. survival at 22 \u00b0C was poorer, but some viruses remained viable for a week. removal of viruses using conventional chlorine washing could give more than 3 log10 reduction, but was only 1 log10 for poliovirus. figures show an increase in number and percentage of people reporting to be born in these countries. Combined, the Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnicity groups make up 5.5% of the England population and 12% of the population of London in 2011. some airports, such as Heathrow, London, act as hubs for passengers going on to other destinations. a study looked at the risk of human\u2013human transmission of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) on airplanes found only a few events of VHF cases in the literature. the study suggested that contact trace back should be undertaken for passengers and crew with direct contact with an infected individual. however, trace back of passengers seated more than one seat away from the infected individual was not considered necessary. this suggests that close contact is thought necessary for human\u2013human transmission. tourists are more likely to be unaware of the risks of virus transmission. the recent case of infection of a wildlife biologist with a novel paramyxovirus highlights that there is still a risk for people who are aware of and carrying out appropriate safety precautions. raw date palm sap, or alcoholic beverages made from it, has been identified as risk factors for human NiV infection in Bangladesh [22,46,47], primarily due to the risk of direct contamination of the sap by the local Pteropus bats. there are no reports of human infection as a result of consumption of such products. date palm sap is the only foodborne source of human NiV infection in Bangladesh. bats could potentially have contact with, and contaminate with saliva or saliva. transport times can be less than 24 hours by air travel, not long enough to allow significant decay of the virus. horses are known to be susceptible to HeV with infections in australia. but to date there have been no reported cases of NiV in horses. pet travel could also be a risk as pets could be infected with zoonotic viruses in endemic countries. the emergence of wild R. aegyptiacus bats in Tenerife was believed to be a result of the escape of captive bats [80] there are no instances of live bat imports into the EU from NiV countries on TRACES. there are reports of R. aegyptiacus being kept as pets. 83.3% of households in brazzaville, Congo consumed bushmeat [122] and a survey of municipal markets identified 35 different animals species. bushmeat now reaches the international markets as part of the $159 billion annual global wildlife trade. one study estimates that 128,000 E. helvum are sold each year in southern Ghana. no official data regarding the size of the bushmeat trade exist as much of the trade is informal or illegal. trans-border trade does occur through known trade routes throughout the region. 134 passengers sampled from 29 flights from central and west africa to france. average individual consignments of bushmeat were over 20 kg, compared with 4 and 9 kg for livestock and fish. most illegal imports detected by UK Border Agency are small amounts. around 80% of the population in africa uses traditional medicine. there is evidence of bats being used for specific ailments in zootherapy. asthma is the most frequently cited disease for which bats are used. the risk from use of bats in zootherapy is not as well understood. the risk from use of bats in zootherapy is not as well understood. some bat species migrate large distances and cross national borders. 16 out of 85 (22%) E. helvum (22%) were migratory, while 78% (69 of 85) were non-migratory. the median travel distance of the non-migratory bats was 15 km. there is no evidence that the return migration routes in spring would take the bats north of the Sahara Desert. isrellus nathusii killed in summer and autumn at german wind turbines. occurrence of Vespertilio murinus on a north sea drilling rig confirmed bats can fly across large bodies of sea. this raises the question of whether migration of bats from Africa to Europe can occur, for example, across the Strait of Gibraltar. the risk of EU bat infection with MARV due to overlapping species populations is potentially higher than NiV. MARV has not been isolated from as many different bat species as henipaviruses, so the risk of virus transfer between species may be more limited. the remains of a bat were found in the wing flap of a Boeing 767. it had flown from heathrow (UK) to Ben-Gurion airport in Israel. this raises the question of what happens to the bat carcass and how it is disposed of. climate change is associated with extreme weather events such as drought and flood. species P. nathusii has been observed adapting its range in response to recent climate changes. a shift in the range of pteropid bats due to climate change could have an impact on circulation of henipaviruses. data from Eurostat show that there are large numbers of people travelling between the EU and areas where NiV and MARV have been reported. the number of immigrants from these areas settling in EU countries is generally increasing and they will naturally have strong ties to their homeland. the number of immigrants from these areas settling in EU countries is generally increasing. study looked at the risk of human\u2013human transmission of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF), including MARV, on airplanes. only a few events of VHF cases in literature and no documented infection in follow up contacts. study suggested that contact trace back should be undertaken for passengers and crew with direct contact with an infected individual. tourists are more likely to be unaware of the risks of virus transmission. if infected, it is likely that they will return to the EU before clinical symptoms have developed. foodborne zoonoses can pose a threat to human health. raw data palm sap, or alcoholic beverages made from it, have been identified as risk factors for human NiV infection in Bangladesh [22,46,47], primarily due to the risk of direct contamination by the local Pteropus bats. there are no reports of human infection as a result of consumption of such products. date palm sap is the only foodborne source of human NiV infection in Bangladesh. bats could potentially have contact with, and contaminate with saliva or saliva. this route is less likely for MARV as, to date, it has not been detected in the faeces or urine of either experimentally or naturally infected R. aegyptiacus bats. MARV has been identified in the african green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) there is considerable movement of horses around the world, primarily for sporting events. horses are known to be susceptible to HeV with infections in Australia [2], but to date there have been no reported cases of NiV in horses. four of 104 bat guano samples from a bat cave in Ratchaburi province, Thailand, were positive for Group C betacoronavirus RNA. the legal importation of bats could also be a risk. there are no instances of live bat imports into the EU from NiV countries on TRACES. 83.3% of households in brazzaville, Congo consumed bushmeat [122] and a survey of municipal markets identified 35 different animals species, nine of which it is prohibited to hunt. bushmeat now reaches the international markets as part of the $159 billion annual global wildlife trade. a review of 31 survey papers on bushmeat did not report anything on bats. unofficial reports and eye witness accounts suggest it is not uncommon to see bats for sale in africa markets. it is possible that bats do not follow a typical bushmeat commodity chain. the list comprises ungulates, rodents, primates and pangolins. the list includes ungulates, rodents, primates and pangolins. most illegal imports detected by UK Border Agency are small amounts. the average duration of smoking of bushmeat was found to be about 6 hours 30 minutes per day at a maximum temperature of 126.3 \u00b0C. freezing in general promotes virus survival and a laboratory study suggested long survival times of MARV at 4 \u00b0C. around 80% of the population in africa uses traditional medicine and there is a growing interest in many developed nations. a review of possible microbiological hazards associated with the illegal importation of bushmeat concluded that the risk of foodborne illness from consumption of bushmeat appeared to be very low and the risk of foodborne illness from cross contamination was also minimal. the risk from use of bats in zootherapy is not as well understood. regular mass long-distance migrations have not been reported for R. aegyptiacus [147] and a sedentary life history for R. aegyptiacus is also supported by the morphological record. some E. helvum individuals migrate more than 1000 km [145] in some cases following the seasonal fluctuation in fruit abundance. the migration routes are generally limited to Europe, with the general trend from north-east to south-west Europe. however, there are data showing movements of Nyctalus noctula from Russia into Bulgaria. it is reported that Pipistrellus nathusii killed in summer and autumn at german wind turbines originated from Estonia or Russia [151] henipavirus antibodies in three of four Myotis bat species in 2006 and 2007. pteropid bats are not widespread in china, but henipaviruses could be introduced to China by other susceptible bat species. a bat strike on a long haul aircraft may result in the carcass being carried long distances across international boundaries. the remains of a bat were found in the wing flap of a Boeing 767 that had flown from heathrow (UK) to Ben-Gurion airport in Israel. this raises the question of what happens to the bat carcass remains. climate change is associated with extreme weather events such as drought and flood. the species P. nathusii has been observed to be adapting its range in response to recent climate changes. this raises the question of how the range and population of fruit bats will change. migration may not be significant as there is little evidence of significant migration pathways into the EU. however, it is unclear whether the absence of knowledge of migration routes into the EU is because they do not exist or because their existence has not been comprehensively investigated. migration could pose a risk for other bat viruses which may be present on these migration routes. the isolation of infectious virus in either bats or humans is currently limited to more confined geographical areas. it is not clear why human outbreaks appear to be confined to this region. this could reflect the route of transmission, sensitivity of surveillance and also perhaps the greater titre of NiV-Bangladesh in bat saliva or urine compared to NiV-Malaysia. research in Peru found that culling campaigns failed to reduce the seroprevalence of rabies among the studied vampire bat colonies [166]. there are many alternative methods to help control virus disease, such as the use of bamboo skirts to prevent NiV contamination of data palm sap in Bangladesh [45,167], limiting potential for indirect contact between livestock and bats at a local level, use of personal protective equipment by investigators dealing with suspect cases. there is a lack of research and surveillance in this area. there is a lack of evidence for absence of NiV or MARV in bats present in the EU. this suggests the frequency of human travel to NiV or MARV areas may change."}
