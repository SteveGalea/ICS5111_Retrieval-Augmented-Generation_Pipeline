{"summary": "malaria is endemic in the area, although transmission has been declining. the coverage for 3 doses is 88% at 12 months of age. the study was conducted in a rural community on the Kenyan coast. acute serum specimens collected 14\u2013130 days later from case patients and controls were analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and Bordatella pertussis toxin. a single reciprocal titer >160 was also considered positive. sputum was induced after 2\u20133 hours of fasting. samples were obtained with a jet nebulizer that delivered 5 mL of sterile saline. the suction catheter was flushed with 5 mL of sterile saline to evacuate any residual specimen. Ziehl-Neelsen stained concentrated sputum smears were examined for acid-fast bacilli and cultured for mycobacteria using the Bactec MIGT 960 system. nucleic acid was extracted from NPS, OPS, and IS specimens and tested by multiplex PCR for 16 respiratory pathogens. etiology was categorized as bacterial if a bacterial pathogen was isolated from blood culture, a predominant bacterial pathogen was identified from IS culture, the serum specimens were positive for M. pneumoniae or B. pertussis. viral if the IS, NPS, or OPS specimen had PCR results positive for a viral pathogen. two groups of control children were enrolled at 2 peripheral health centers from March 2010 through February 2011. those with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), including cough, runny or blocked nose, or sore throat, and those without symptoms of respiratory infection. possible infection with B. pertussis was defined as a 4-fold increase in antibody titer in paired acute-convalescent serum specimens. possible infection with B. pneumoniae was defined as a single sample with an antibody concentration >100 mIU/mL. sputum smears were examined for acid-fast bacilli and cultured for mycobacteria. the presence of mycobacterium tuberculosis in acid-fast bacilli\u2013positive cultures was confirmed by the Genotype MTBC assay. Statistical analysis analysis was performed using STATA software, version 11.0 (StataCorp) Proportions were compared using the 2 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. odds ratios were calculated comparing case patients and controls. 83 (8.6%) refused and 71 (7.4%) were not approached for consent (15 died during the admission process, 49 were not considered because of a failure of the computerized flagging system. compared with those with SP, case patients were younger (average age, 13 vs 20 months in controls; P.001), had a higher prevalence of mid\u2013upper-arm circumference 11.5 cm (18% vs 4% in controls; P =.002) a 2 for comparison of proportions indicate significant differences at the P.05 level. b Defined as weight-for-height z score of 3 or less or kwashiorkor. a 2 for comparison of proportions, t test for age.

PERCH study will provide definitive information about the etiology of SP and VSP in children in the developing world. this article was published as part of a supplement entitled \u201cPneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health\u201d sponsored by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to the PERCH Project of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland."}
