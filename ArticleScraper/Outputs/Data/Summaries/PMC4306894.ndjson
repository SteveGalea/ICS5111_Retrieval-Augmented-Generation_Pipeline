{"summary": "novel avian influenza A (H7N9) has been reported in china in march 2013 followed by its wide spread in the eastern provinces of china and the first recorded death in 3 March 2013. this virus normally causes severe respiratory illness in humans, but demonstrates an asymptomatic infection in poultry. sporadic imported cases have been detected in adjacent areas. a GIS analysis of the H7N9 outbreak was conducted by focusing on its space-time features, especially its clustering features. this study enhances the knowledge base on the current status of the epidemic and contributes to a greater understanding of the areas where the outbreak was focused. the dataset is summarized by county in china to analyze spatial clustering. it calculates a Getis-OrdGi* statistic [16] for each feature in the GIS analysis according to the properties of its neighbor features. a neighborhood in the analysis is defined by the spatial and temporal distance between features as features are probably correlated to each other according to their spatial and temporal relationships. a peak significance level of clustering may indicate the threshold temporal distance where clustering is most prominent. a spatial distance of 10 km ensures the closest features to be neighbors. a spatial distance beyond 590 km does not create additional statistically significant clustering. a cylinder was used to define a potential spatial-temporal cluster. the percentage of cases observed within a cylinder was compared to what would have been expected if the cases were randomly distributed in space and time. the maximum cluster size was set to 10% of the population at risk. information included age, sex, date of onset of symptoms, date of diagnosis and place of residence. hot Spot Analysis tool of the ESRI\u00ae Geographic Information System (GIS) software ArcMapTM 10.1 was used in this study. a peak significance level of clustering was found that may indicate the threshold distance where spatial clustering is most prominent. a spatial distance of 10 km ensures the closest features to be neighbors while a spatial distance beyond 590 km does not create additional statistically significant clustering. a space-time permutation scan statistic model was used to explore the spatial-temporal clusters of H7N9 cases. a cylinder was used to define a potential spatial-temporal cluster. the percentage of cases observed within a cylinder was compared to what would have been expected if the cases were randomly distributed. was an initial peak of 37 cases in the 15th week of 2013 followed by a sharp decrease to six or fewer cases per week starting in the 17th week and for the remainder of 2013. a second peak was then observed during a new outbreak in 2014, capping out at 44 cases per week by the end of January. the average number of new cases dropped sharply, averaging little more than five cases per week over the sample period. spatial-temporal analysis produced a z-score peak between 14 and 26 days temporal distance. the temporal distance at which the peak starts, 14 days, was selected as the threshold temporal distance for the space-time Hot-Spot analysis. most of the secondary clusters except those that occurred in Guangzhou and Shenzhen were identified in counties with no more than three cases during the whole study period. the strongest cluster occurred in March 2013 to April 2013 in Shanghai and Zhejiang province; a relatively weak cluster occurs in February 2014 near Guangzhou and Shenzhen. a z-score peak in the Incremental Spatial Autocorrelation analysis demonstrates a pronounced spatial clustering at distances of 30 and 250 km. most cases occurred in the areas in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces near the Yangtze River delta. score peak starts, 14 days, was selected as the threshold temporal distance for the space-time Hot-Spot analysis. a GiZscore 2.58 indicates dispersion at p = 0.01, 2.58 to 1.96 dispersion at p = 0.05, 1.96 to 1.66 dispersion at p = 0.1, 1.66 to 1.66 random distribution, 1.66 to 1.96 clustering at p = 0.1, 1.96 to 2.58 clustering at p = 0.05, and the strongest cluster occurred in March 2013 to April 2013 in Shanghai and Zhejiang province. a relatively weak cluster occurs in February 2014 near Guangzhou and Shenzhen. previous studies have also shown a positive correlation between human rates of H7N9 infection and regional density of poultry markets. human H7N9 cases are more likely to occur in cool months. previous study also indicated that high risk was found when the minimum temperature on day 13 prior to disease onset range from 5 to 9 \u00b0C and maximum temperature range from 13 to 18 \u00b0C. most human cases occurred in and surrounding the Yangtze River delta region. sporadic cases were distributed in other provinces. previous studies have shown a positive correlation between human rates of H7N9 infection and regional density of poultry markets. sporadic H7N9 cases still occurred after May 2013 with a large resurgence in 2014. space-time clustering is less significant (p = 0.05) and spans over smaller area and shorter period than clustering in 2013. this suggests that shutting down poultry markets can be an effective intervention in halting the spread of H7N9. ang provinces and these two areas have no significant cluster since then. a relatively weak cluster occurs in february 2014 near Guangzhou and shenzhen."}
