{"summary": "the study looked at prospective surveillance data on influenza and influenza-like illness activity during the 2008 winter influenza season. the 2007\u201308 strains of influenza virus circulating in Hong Kong were closely related to A/H1N1/Brisbane/59/2007, A/H1N1/Soloman Islands/3/2006-like, B/Yamagata/16/88-like, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like. the elderly appeared to have been less affected, with no clear rate increases noted by febrile sentinel surveillance in elderly care homes and generally low influenza-related admission rates in this age group. the effective reproductive number on day t can be interpreted as the average number of new persons infected by an infector who had symptom onset on day t. a reproductive number >1 implies that an epidemic will grow in the short term, while a number 1 implies that an epidemic will die out. the estimated values of 1.2\u20131.5 during the rising phase of the 2008 winter epidemic in Hong Kong are slightly lower than previous estimates for interpandemic influenza (12,13), perhaps because of the low time-dependent resolution of the weekly aggregation of surveillance data. some previous reports have demonstrated that school closures may be effective at mitigating influenza seasons. influenza infections in children cause considerable illness and death. it is often hypothesized that children are affected generally earlier in epidemics because of higher transmission rates (15) source: 08-0646_app-s1.gif (98.5KB, gif)."}
