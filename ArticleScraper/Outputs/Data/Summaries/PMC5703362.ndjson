{"summary": "four distinct serotypes of DV circulate globally with most endemic countries reporting circulation of all 4 serotypes. the incidence of DV infections has spread dramatically around the world in recent decades. over 3 billion people are actually at risk of being infected. CYD-TVD shows some shortcomings. first, efficacy of CYD-TVD for confirmed dengue cases was lower in seronegative individuals than in seropositive individuals. the rate of hospitalization of sero-negative individuals was considerably higher. a murine model of DV infection demonstrated that CD8+ T cells play a major role in viral clearance as depletion of these cells increased viral titers in the infected animals. a major limitation in DV vaccines which solely depend on induction of neutralizing antibodies is the potential for non-neutralizing antibody mediated enhancement of DV infection. several groups have attempted to identify T cell epitopes by either screening overlapping peptides from structural and nonstructural DV proteins, including preM, E, and NS3. a comprehensive analysis of naturally presented epitopes on the infected cells has not been undertaken or reported to the best of our knowledge. use of adjuvants and/or antigen delivery systems is considered to provide dose-sparing to allow immunization of more people using smaller amount of antigen, reduce the need for booster dosing, improve vaccine efficacy, and consequently reduce the cost of vaccination. many vaccine delivery systems, including liposomal formulations, are currently being investigated in an effort to achieve long-term protection against a broad range of viral subtypes. CaPNP indicated no toxicity, inflammation, or allergic reaction. there was great interest in investigating the potential of CaPNPs for development of vaccines against DV infection. we aimed to investigate the beneficial properties of CaPNPs. the vaccine formulated with 0.3% CaPNPs has also provided greater than 80% protection against infection with a fatal dose of A/CA/04/2009 (H1N1pdm) virus in challenge studies. using this data, we investigated the optimal CaPNP concentration suitable for peptide antigen delivery and functional T cell activation. DV specific CaPNP/multipeptide formulation stimulate CD8+ T cell activation in vivo. mice were grouped (n = 3) as: 1) unimmunized (PBS control); 2) pooled peptide emulsified in ISA 51; 3) CaPNP/multipeptide formulation with GlcNAc. peptide formulations were selected individually or combined as a pool of multiple peptides. spleens were harvested and the spleenocytes were isolated. data indicate that the formulations induced robust CD8+ T cell activation. CaPNP/multipeptide formulation induced highest levels of IFN- secretion against DV2 infected HepG2 targets and against some individual peptide pulsed HepG2 target groups. compared with pooled formulations of CaPNP/individual peptides and the free peptides emulsified with ISA 51 adjuvant. 50 g each peptide/150 L CaPNP per mouse) emulsified with ISA51, 4) 10 g CaPNP/multipeptide formulation (10 g each peptide/150 L CaPNP per mouse) and 5) 50 g CaPNP/multipeptide formulation (50 g each peptide/150 L CaPNP per mouse) mice were immunized 3 times with the designated vaccines and then the spleens were harvested. the free peptides formulated with ISA 51 generated the highest response at higher peptide concentration (50 g) compared with the lower concentration (10 g), we selected the 10 g CaPNP/multipeptide formulation for further characterization. the mice were immunized in 5 groups: 1) unimmunized (PBS control), 2) pooled free peptides (10 g each peptide/150 l CaPNP per mouse), 4) CaPNP/multipeptide formulation with 1 GlcNAc (10 g each peptide/150 l CaPNP per mouse); and 5) CaPNP/multipeptide formulation with 3 GlcNAc (10 g each peptide/150 l CaP different GlcNAc concentrations in DV CaPNP/multipeptide formulations stimulate CD8+ T cell activation in vivo. data represented as mean S.D (n =3) of SFU per 1 million splenocytes.

DV serotypes (T1-T4), IFN- expression was upregulated in both pooled peptides/ISA 51 and CaPNP/multipeptide/GlcNAc formulation groups as measured by ELISpot assay. toxicology and safety study of DV CaPNP/multipeptide/GlcNAc formulation We performed in vivo toxicology and safety studies in HLA-A2+ transgenic mice. results indicated no statistically significant decrease in mean body weights between the treatment groups and the vehicle control group. weight gain in the treatment groups was comparable to the control group during the 21 day dosing/observation period, however it was not statistically significant. conventional vaccines normally target DV structural proteins to provide protection against all 4 dengue serotypes. but several concerns related to dengue pathogenesis caused antibody-dependent enhancement or insufficient responses in younger age groups have raised challenges for the development of a robust, broad, and multi-functional DV vaccine. the average particle size of the DV CaPNP/multipeptide vaccine formulations used in this study was below 100nm. this is likely small enough to enter the lymphatic network and target antigen presenting cells to generate potent immune responses. this vaccine formulation is biodegradable due to the characteristics of the calcium phosphate nanoparticle. lyophilized vaccine formulations were functionally active and immunogenic over this time period as tested by both in vitro and in vivo studies. lyophilization is an option for long-term cold chain-independent storage for caPNP/multipeptide vaccine. we suggest that this vaccine formulation is suitable for transportation and use in regions where dengue is endemic. 5\u20136 HLA supertypes cover >90% of the world population59. these novel MHC class I restricted epitopes were conserved within 4 DV serotypes, covering a wide range of viral proteins including capsid, NS2A, NS4B and NS5. some of them had HLA-A2 and A2/A24 dual binding motifs. the overall immunogenic performance of DV-peptide vaccine can be improved by formulating a pool of DV-peptides with CaPNP when compared with peptides mixed with the standard adjuvant-ISA 51. lower doses of CaPNP/multipeptide formulations (10 g each peptide) can induce higher T cell responses than that of CaPNP/multipeptide formulations containing peptides at higher dose levels. a novel vaccine strategy includes naturally presented DV-specific peptides with confirmed biologic functions formulated as nanoparticles. the manufacturing of CaPNPs involves a simple chemistry using a combination of calcium and phosphate salts and does not require the addition of thiol or any linkers. data from current study also showed that the DV CaPNP/multipeptide formulation used to immunize mice could generate a peptide specific response (through observation of activation upon recognition of peptide pulsed targets), but also a DV virus specific response (through observation of activation upon recognition of targets infected with either DV2 or Thai isolates of DV serotypes T1-T4) a synthetic universal vaccine strategy could transform the clinical success of prophylactic vaccine strategies for heterologous viruses. all cell infections were performed at an MOI of 5 for one hour at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in complete media containing 1% FBS. PBMCs were isolated using lymphocyte separation medium (Mediatech, Flemington, NJ) each experiment was performed at least 3 times with different donors. fresh buffy coats from healthy HLA-A2+ positive donors were obtained and processed for each experiment.
