{"summary": "infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gammacoronavirus that infects poultry primarily, causing an infectious respiratory disease. infection results in substantial economic losses to the worldwide poultry industry as a result of reduced egg quality, egg production, and meat quality. the majority of DMVs were found to be sealed from the cytoplasm with only 10% having a visible pore from the interior. for all of these viruses, the spherule-like structure is composed of an invagination of a single membrane derived from a cellular structure. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. some viral replicase proteins have been shown to be located inside DMVs or on their membranes. es MHV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV characterized membrane rearrangements induced by IBV during infection of mammalian vero cells, primary chick kidney cells, and ex vivo organ culture. in all three systems, we found that IBV induced novel membrane structures not found in previous work studying betacoronaviruses. zippered ER and spherules show a marked structural difference to convoluted membranes observed during replication of the betacoronaviruses. zippered ER showed little by way of organized structure when visualized by electron tomography. zippered ER was visualized as a regular track of paired membranes surrounded by an electron dense region. viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase, nsp12, must be present at the site of RNA synthesis so was used as an alternate marker for replication complexes. dsRNA and nsp12 can be detected by immunofluorescence labeling from 4 hpi so co-localization of dsRNA and nsp12 was compared at 4, 6, and 8 hpi. IBV induces the formation of regions of zippered ER with associated spherules (A) as a by-product of viral RNA synthesis, non-productive dsRNA is produced and shielded from cellular detection inside DMVs (B). this work will be interesting to identify the viral proteins responsible for controlling the rearrangement of cellular membranes. both viruses were found to induce membrane structures analogous to those observed in cells infected with wild type virus used in previous work. zippered ER, spherules, and asterisks could be detected."}
