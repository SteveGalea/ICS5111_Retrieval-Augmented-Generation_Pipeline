{"summary": "previous clinical trials evaluated transmembrane-deleted and point-mutation Ebolavirus glycoproteins (GPs) in candidate vaccines. 80% of subjects had positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results (30) at week 12. study was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center by the VRC. the study was reviewed and approved by the NIAID Institutional Review Board. the study was not randomized because approval to proceed with the MAR DNA vaccine was received before approval to proceed with the EBO WT DNA vaccine. 206 study began, an optional homologous booster dose at week 32 or later was offered to subjects who had completed all 3 injections. local and systemic reactogenicity was self-reported by subjects using 5-day diary cards after each vaccination. subjects were followed up for safety and immunogenicity for 32 weeks or for 12 weeks after receipt of the optional fourth study injection. gene from the EBOV strain (GenBank accession No. U28134) and VRC 6614. the plasmids in both vaccines are incapable of replication in human cells. the plasmids in both vaccines are incapable of replication in human cells. a background-corrected optical density reading of >0.20 was considered a positive result. the primary time points were 4 weeks after the third and the fourth study injections. antibodies were from BD Biosciences unless otherwise stated. anti-CD28-Cy5PE [cyanine dye Cy5TM, phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD45RA-Cy7PE [cyanine dye Cy7TM, PE], anti-CCR7-Ax680 [Alexa Fluor\u00ae 680] (ReaMetrix), anti-IFN-APC [allophycocyanin (APC), anti-IL-2-PE results were analyzed using FlowJo software Version 9.4.10. a positive response occurs if a Fisher exact test for the 2 2 table has a 1-sided P value.01. the percentage of positive cells for a peptide minus the percentage of positive cells for the negative control exceeds 0.05 for each combination of cell population and cytokine. positive response rates are computed along with the exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from binomial distributions. the study was a single-site, phase 1, open label study. the study was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center by the VRC. the original protocol design included 3 study vaccinations at day 0 and weeks 4 and 8. an optional fourth vaccination was added by amendment with 12 weeks of additional follow-up. a 4-mg dose of vaccine was administered as 1 mL by intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle. the MAR vaccine consists of a single, closed, circular plasmid DNA macromolecule (plasmid VRC 6712) designed to express WT GP of the MARV Angola strain. the amino acid sequences for the GP antigens expressed are identical to WT GP of Ebolavirus. the plasmids in both vaccines are incapable of replication in human cells. the bulk plasmid drug substances were filtered and formulated in phosphate-buffered saline as a sterile liquid injectable dosage form for intramuscular injection. end point titers of antibodies directed against MAR GP (AN) and EBO GP antigens (Z and S) were measured throughout the study. IFN detection antibodies, avidin\u2013horseradish peroxidase solution, and 3-amino, 9 ethyl-carbazole substrate solution. a positive response occurs if the background subtracted number of spots per 1 106 cells is >100 spot-forming cells per million PBMCs. a positive response occurs if the background subtracted number of spots per 1 106 cells is >100 spot-forming cells per million PBMCs. cells were washed twice, permeabilized with CytoFix-CytoPerm reagent (BD; 100 L per well) cells were resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4\u00b0C for 36 hours before flow cytometric analysis. luciferase reporter gene was used as infection targets and incubated in a 96-well plate 1 day before infection with pseudovirus. cells were lysed 72 hours after infection and assayed with the Luciferase Assay System. Vaccine safety Both vaccines were well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. no laboratory or clinical coagulation abnormalities were detected. one adverse event, a mild superficial lesion at the injection site that resolved without treatment, was definitely related to the study vaccines. a Local and systemic reactogenicity was self-reported by subjects using 5-day diary cards after each vaccination. gia None 7 (70) 10 (100) 17 (85) Mild 2 (20) 0 2 (10) Moderate 1 (10) 0 1 (5) Severe 0 0 Headache None 6 (60) 9 (90) 15 (75) Mild 4 (40) 1 (10) 5 (25) Moderate 0 0 Severe 0 0 Chills None 9 (90) 9 (90) 18 (90) Mild 1 (10) 1 (10) 2 (10) Moderate four weeks after the fourth vaccination, 100% of subjects (7 of 7) were positive for GP (AN), 75% (6/8) for GP (S) and 63% (5/8) for GP (Z) between 8 and 12 weeks after the boost, 57% (4 of 7) in group 1 had sustained positive responses for GP (AN), and 50% (4 of 8) in group 2 had sustained positive responses for GP (S) and GP (Z) administration of a fourth homologous DNA vaccine at a boost interval of 32 weeks demonstrated boosting of waning antibody responses to near peak levels. GP (AN)\u2013 and GP (Z)\u2013specific neutralizing antibody activity was assessed in a reporter virus assay. four weeks after the fourth DNA vaccination, the frequency was similar at 14% (1 of 7) for GP (AN), 38% (3 of 8) for GP (S) and 13% (1 of 8) for GP (Z) four weeks after the third vaccination, GP-specific T-cell responses were present at a frequency of 40% (4 of 10) for GP (AN), 63% (5 of 8) for GP (S) and 25% (2 of 8) for GP (Z) study population A total of 20 subjects were enrolled between 4 and 17 June 2009. one subject discontinued vaccinations per protocol requirements after 1 study vaccination. 1 subject in group 2 was lost to follow-up after 2 vaccinations. a unless otherwise indicated, data represent No. (%) of subjects.

MAR and EBO GP-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were seen in all antigen groups by intracellular cytokine staining at 4 weeks after the third and fourth DNA vaccinations. by week 24, 22% (2 of 9) still had a CD4+ T-cell response for GP (AN) and GP (S), and 11% (1/9) for GP (Z) by week 24, the frequency was similar at 14% (1 of 7) for GP (AN), 38% (3 GP-specific T-cell responses were present at a frequency of 40% (4 of 10) for GP (AN), 63% (5 of 8) for GP (S) and 25% (2 of 8) for GP (Z) at 24 weeks, 22% of subjects (2 of 9) were positive for GP (AN), 44% (4 of 9) were positive for GP (S) and 22% (2 of 9) were positive for GP (Z) both the EBO and MAR WT GP vaccines were safe and immunogenic in humans. a fourth dose of DNA as a homologous boost improved the otherwise waning antibody titers and T-cell responses."}
