{"summary": "a causal role for human polyomaviruses (HPyV), papillomaviruses (HPV), herpesviruses (HHV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) and cancer is accepted. miRNAs are noncoding small RNA molecules that act as posttranscriptional regulators. they appear to be an inherent part of the genomes of most living organisms. their exact functions start to emerge and include control of cellular processes such as differentiation, morphogenesis, and metabolism. RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) directs RISC to the target mRNA. the unincorporated strand, called the passenger strand, is degraded. the seed region, which encompasses nucleotides 2 to 8 of the 5\u2019 ends of miRNA, plays a pivotal role in target selection. 2\u2019-O -methoxyethyl AMOs possess a higher affinity and specificity to RNA than their 2\u2019-O -methyl AMOs. other 2\u2019 sugar modifications that have been used include 2\u2019-fluor and locked nucleic acid (LNA) peptide nucleic acids (PNA) are synthetic oligonucleotides with N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine replacing the deoxyribose or ribose backbone. another approach in silencing miRNA is the use of so-called microRNA sponge, a synthetic mRNA that contains multiple binding sites. human infections with the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) Simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) were considered as accidental transmission of the virus from monkeys to people living in close contact with these animals. recent observations support the possibility that SV40 can spread in humans by horizontal infection and even vertical transmission, suggesting that man may be a natural host for this virus. the SV40 miRNA is conserved in BKV and JCV. both miRNAs bind to the same target, that is, the early transcripts. the SV40 miRNAs serve the same role as SV40 miRNA. the number refers to the approximate sequence coordinates of the LAT locus. L= long, S= short, U= unique, TR= terminal repeat, IR= internal repeat. human parvovirus not predicted [65] HSV-1 (HHV1) miR-LAT (within exon 1) Prevents apoptosis by targeting translation of the genes encoding TGF-1 and SMAD3 [67](retracted), [48, 68, 69], [70] miR-LAT- ICP34.5 miR-H1 Repression of the expression of the viral protein ICP0, which promotes viral replication miR-H2 Downregulation of miR-BART1-1 to -3 Inhibition LMP1 expression [24], [51, 75\u201379] Inhibit EBV DNA polymerase BALF5 miR-BART2 Inhibition LMP1 expression miR-BART3 miR-BART4 Antiapoptotic by downregulation of PUMA miR-BART5 miR-BART6 Inhibition LMP1 expression miR-BART7 miR-BART8 miR-BART9 human papillomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with a circular dsDNA genome of approximately 8000 base-pairs. these viruses are associated with benign and malignant lesions of the skin and the genital tract. more than 100 different HPV genotypes have been identified. adenovirus encodes small noncoding RNAs, known as virus-associated RNA or VAI and VAII RNA, which are generated by RNA polymerase III. this noncoding RNA plays an important role for viral replication and neutralizes the antiviral action of interferon. a minor fraction of VAI RNA is processed into functional RISC-associated ssRNA which can act as miRNA. -herpesviruses cytomegalovirus (HCMV or HHV-5), HHV-6A, HHV-6B, and HHV-7. all human herpesviruses are able to establish latent infections with only a small subset of viral genes expressed. viral-encoded miRNAs seem to be required to maintain a latent state of infecton. a later study revealed that the described miR-LAT was not viral encoded, but in fact a cellular miRNA expressed in SH-SY-5Y cells. the report describing miR-LAT was retracted and the work by Umbach et al. could also not confirm the existence of this miRNA in HSV-1 infected cells. miR-H1 and miR-H6 were expressed at 1200 and 300 copies. the other miR-Hs were present at less than 40 copies per infected cell. miR-H2 expression diminished the protein levels of ICP0. miR-I reduces the expression of the viral neurovirulence factor ICP34.5. miR-I is a multifunctional protein required for viral replication in neuronal cells. acute VZV reactivation leads to herpes zoster, commonly referred to as shingles. omegalovirus (HCMV) causes mild or subclinical diseases in immunocompetent adults. HCMV is one of the leading viral causes of birth defects. HCMV can establish acute, persistent, or latent infections characterized by different viral gene expression. miR-UL112-1 targets mRNA for MHC class I-related chain B (MICB) and to a lesser extend MICA. MICB is induced, thus activating NK-cells and T cells. infected cells were more susceptible to being killed in an NKG2D-dependent manner. miR-UL112-1-mediated downregulation of UL114 may prevent viral DNA replication and favor a latent infection state. the actions of miR-UL112-1 seem to be associated with latent viral infection, a state which allows the virus to hide from the immune system. more than 20 different miRNAs have been identified that are transcribed during latent infection. one cluster resides in the BART (abbreviation for BamHI-A rightward transcripts) region. the intronic region encodes miRNAs miR-BART1 to miR-BART20. induction of EBV replication in latency I-infected cells was associated with increased expression of miR-BHRF1-1, -2, and -3. expression levels of miR-BART-1 and -2 did not change. a precise knowledge of the latency state of EBV and expression pattern of viral miRNAs may improve the successful treatment of EBV infection with AMOs. miRNA miR-BART2 can inhibit expression of viral DNA polymerase BALF5. it could thus interfere with viral replication and prevent lytic infection. cellular protein p53 up-regulator of apoptosis (PUMA) is a target for miR-BART5. mediated suppression of CXCL-11 may increase susceptibility of the tumour cells to the immune system. two recent studies reported antitumour activity for CXCL-11 in animal models. a total of 17 KSHV miRNAs encoded by 12 distinct miRNA genes have been reported. miR-K12-1, miR-K12-3-3p, miR-K12-6-3p, and miR-K12-11 target genes. thrombospondin-1 possesses antiproliferative and anti-angiogenic properties. mRNA for the Bcl-2 interacting protein BCLAF1 was identified as a target for miR-K12-5. gene expression profiles in cells expressing either miR-155 or miR-K12-11 revealed that they regulate an analogous set of mRNAs. the products of these transcripts include proteins involved in B-cell function (e.g., Src-like adaptor or SLA), innate immunity (e.g., IB kinase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase), apoptosis (XIAP associated factor-1; LDOC1), miRNA precursor sequences have been predicted in the genomes of the human poxviruses vaccinia virus and variola virus. miRNA precursor sequences have been predicted in the genomes of the human poxviruses vaccinia virus and variola virus. aMO-mediated silencing of KSHV-encoded miRNAs is likely no option. human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) HIV is the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) it is estimated that >30 million people worldwide are infected with this virus. HIV uses reverse transcriptase to convert its ssRNA genome into a dsDNA provirus. the central domain of the LTR is referred to the R region. the miR-TAR-5p described by Ouellet overlaps with the vmiRNA no. 1. miR-TAR-3p partially overlaps with vmiRNA no. 5 described by Bennasser and coworkers. predicted by computer-directed analyses 5 pre-miRNAs in the HIV-1 genome. a recent study examined the possibility of HIV-2 TAR to encode miRNAs. the nef gene of HIV-1 is located at the 3\u2019 end of the viral genome. the nef gene of HIV-1 is highly expressed during early stages of virus replication. nef expression may suppress HIV-1 replication and allow persistently low pathogenic or latent viral infection. the identity and action of HIV-1 miRNAs remains to be scrutinized before AMOs-based therapy can be considered as anti-HIV drugs. human polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with a circular ds DNA genome of approximately 5000 base-pairs. human infections with the rhesus macaque (SV40) were considered as accidental transmission of the virus from monkeys to people living in close contact with these animals or through vaccination with the contaminated poliovirus vaccines. the HPyV genome can be divided into three functional regions. the early region encodes the early proteins large T-antigen (LT-ag) and small t-antigen (st-ag), while the late region encodes the capsid proteins VP1-VP3 and the regulatory protein agnoprotein. both regions are separated by the noncoding control region that encompasses the origin of replication and the promoter/enhancer sequences for the early and late genes. blocking miR-M1 by, for example, antagomirs will increase expression of the viral oncoprotein LT-antigen. expression of a corresponding or other viral-encoded miRNA for other HPyV WU and KI is lacking so far. the human polyomavirus (HPyV) BK virus, JC virus, SV40, and Merkel Cell polyomavirus encode the viral miRNAs miR-B1, miR-J1, mi the HIV-1 genome and location of the viral-encoded miRNAs. the figure is based on a compilation of the studies by [52\u201357]. miR-UL36-1 miR-UL54-1 miR-UL70-1 miR-UL22A-1 miR-UL112-1 Downregulates expression of CMV genes involved in its own replication process. downregulation of IE-1 miR-UL148D-1 miR-US4-1 miR-US5-1 miR-US5-2 miR-US24 miR-US25-1 miR-US25-2 miR-US33-1 RNA2.7 Bnds components of the mitochondrial respiratory thrombospondin 1 miR-K12-3 miR-K12-4 miR-K12-5 Downregulation of thrombospondin 1 and BACH-1. miR-K12-11 Identical to miR-155 miR-K12-12 Poxvirus variola virus 3 predicted [65] Hepatitis B virus [54] Hepatitis C virus Human immunodeficiency virus miR-H1 Type 1 (HIV-1) miR-TAR HDAC one study with HPV type 31 failed to clone vmiRNA from virus-infected cells. this does not exclude that other strains may encode vmiRNA. adenoviruses are naked dsDNA viruses that can cause mild respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and ocular disease. human herpesviruses Herpesviruses are enveloped dsDNA viruses with a genome size ranging from 130 to 250 kilobase-pairs. they are divided into three subfamilies denoted, and. Approximately 130 different herpesviruses have been identified to date. an important gene in HSV latency is the LAT gene. this gene encodes the latency-associated transcript (LAT) which does not code for a protein. this gene encodes the latency-associated transcript (LAT) which does not code for a protein. RNA candidates in the HSV-1 genome confirmed the expression of one mature miRNA, designated miR-H1, in HSV-1 infected Vero cells. this miRNA is encoded approximately 450 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the LAT transcript, but a corresponding sequence is not conserved in the HSV-2. miR-H1 remains to be established and no cellular target mRNAs were identified. HSV-2 HSV-2 infects the genital region and establishes a lifelong latent infection. the prevalence of latent HSV-2 infection varies between 10\u201360%. the only detectable viral transcript during HSV-2 latency is the LAT. VZV is a common virus that causes chickenpox or varicella during primary infection. the virus establishes a latent infection, but reactivation leads to herpes zoster. no putative miRNAs could be predicted in the VZV genome. HCMV-encoded miRNA miR-UL112-1 plays a central role in helping the virus to hide from the host's immune system. miRNA targets mRNA for MHC class I-related chain B (MICB), and to a lesser extend MICA. miR-UL112-1 also targets mRNA encoding immediate early proteins. miR-UL-112-1 regulates the transcription of viral genes required for acute replication. IE72 plays a pivotal role in controlling latency and reactivation of the virus through negative regulation of IE72 expression. IE1 is a crucial protein to ascertain lytic replication of HCMV. EBV or human herpsesvirus-4 (HHV-4) is a -herpesvirus that establishes a lifelong latent infection in B-lymphocytes in more than 90% of the human population. EBV is associated with infectious mononucleosis and has been implicated in pathogenesis of several malignancies. miRNAs miR-BHRF-1-1 to miR-BHRF-1-1 are abundantly expressed in latently infected epithelial cells, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, EBV-associated gastric carcinoma cell lines and tissues. higher levels of BHRF1-3 were measured in latency type III burkitt's lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. this corresponds well with the expression pattern of BART multispliced transcripts. LMP1 is expressed in all the EBV related malignancies and promotes cellular transformation. overexpression of LMP1 results in growth-inhibitory and sensitization to apoptosis induced by stress or chemotherapeutic agents. ucleotide, PUMA protein levels decreased and apoptosis was triggered. this finding may have important implications in the development of anti-EBV agents. miR-BHRF1-2 is involved in the cleavage of BHRF1 RNA in the cytoplasm. the entire KSHV miRNA cluster resides within an approximately 4 kilobase-pairs region between open reading frames ORF K12 (kaposin) and ORF 71. gene encoding thrombospondin-1 was targeted by all ten KSHV miRNAs. miRNA-mediated reduction of BCLAF1 expression would prevent permanent latency of the virus, a type of infection that represents a dead-end pathway of viral spreading. a number of B-cell lymphomas and solid organ tumors overexpress miR-155, while miR-155 transgenic mice develop B lymphomas. the exact role of miR-155 remains unclear, but a number of mRNAs overexpress miR-155. treatment of latently-infected KSHV with an antagomir enhanced Fos protein levels about 2.5-fold compared to untreated cells [81], 82. human miRNAs miR-15a plus 16, miR-18a/b, and miR-340 are believed to have similar seed sequences as the viral miRNAs. aMO-mediated silencing of KSHV-encoded miRNAs may thus be a strategy to counteract viral infection. a miRNA-entrapped in the LAT (miR-LAT) downregulates the expression of transforming growth factor- (TGF-) and SMAD3. the latter is a mediator of the signalling pathway induced by TGF-. a later study revealed that the described miR-LAT was not viral encoded, but in fact a cellular miRNA expressed in SH-SY-5Y cells. miR-H1 and miR-H6 were expressed at 1200 and 300 copies. the other miR-Hs were present at less than 40 copies per infected cell. miR-H2 expression diminished the protein levels of ICP0. HSV-2 infection can also cause encephalitis and neonatal herpes. the only detectable viral transcript during HSV-2 latency is the LAT. the molecular function of this miRNA remains unknown. V is a common virus that causes chickenpox or varicella during primary infection. reactivation leads to herpes zoster, commonly referred to as shingles. no putative miRNAs could be predicted in the VZV genome. miR-UL112-1 targets mRNA for MICB and to a lesser extend MICA. miR-UL112-1 also represses the expression of HCMV genes involved in its own replication process. miR-UL-112-1 regulates the transcription of viral genes required for acute replication. UL112-1 inhibited IE1 levels in cells infected with a virus lacking miR-UL112-1 or with mutations in the seed sequence of the ie1 gene. IE1 is a crucial protein to ascertain lytic replication of HCMV, thus downregulation of IE1 may help the virus establish latency. more than 20 different EBV miRNAs have been identified that are transcribed during latent infection. one cluster resides in the BART (abbreviation for BamHI-A rightward transcripts) region. the intronic region encodes miR-BART1 to miR-BART20. abundantly expressed in latently infected epithelial cells, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, EBV-associated gastric carcinoma cell lines and tissues. higher levels of BHRF1-3 were measured in latency type III burkitt's lymphomas and in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. a precise knowledge of the latency state of EBV and the expression pattern of viral miRNAs may improve the successful treatment of EBV infection with AMOs. protein kinases (CDK), and the CDK inhibitors p16 and p27. overexpression of LMP1 results in growth-inhibitory and sensitization to apoptosis induced by stress or chemotherapeutic agents. viral miRNA miR-BART2 can inhibit expression of viral DNA polymerase BALF5 and may thus interfere with viral replication and prevent lytic infection. miR-BHRF1-2 is involved in the cleavage of BHRF1 RNA in the cytoplasm, but the biological relevance remains to be determined. Xia et al. observed high levels of miR-BHRF1-3 were correlated with low levels CXCL-11, a potent interferon-inducible T-cell attracting chemokine. the entire KSHV miRNA cluster resides within an approximately 4 kilobase-pairs region between open reading frames ORF K12 (kaposin) and ORF 71. transcriptome analysis was performed from cells stably expressing the miR-K12 cluster. genes encoding proteins implicated in proliferation, immune modulation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. the exact role of miR-155 remains unclear. a number of B-cell lymphomas and solid organ tumors overexpress miR-155, while miR-155 transgenic mice develop B lymphomas. work by the groups of Skalsky and Cullen confirmed that miR-K12-11 indeed is an orthologue of miR-155. miRNAs miR-15a and miR-18a/b are believed to have tumour suppressor activity. miR-18a/b is believed to induce apoptosis by silencing Bcl2 expression. miRNA precursor sequences have been predicted in genomes of human poxviruses vaccinia virus and variola virus. human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) HIV is the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) it is estimated that >30 million people worldwide are infected with this virus. the miRNA derived from the left arm of the TAR stem has been named miR-TAR-5p. miR-TAR-3p appears to preferentially accumulate in HIV-positive cells. the biological role of these miRNAs remains to be elucidated. IL-15 is important in regulation of T-cell maturation, development and survival of natural killer cells. IRAK1 is a critical signalling mediator of innate immunity. IRAK1 is a critical signalling mediator of innate immunity. miR-N367 suppresses HIV-1 promoter activity via a negative responsive element in the 5\u2019-long terminal region and via Nef sequences in the 3\u2019 untranslated region. future studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanism by which miR-N3667 represses HIV-1 promoter activity. downregulation of Nef expression may suppress HIV-1 replication and allow persistently low pathogenic or latent viral infection. genomes of human RNA viruses seem to contain putative miRNA sequences, except for measles virus and yellow fever virus. miRNA in yellow fever virus could not be validated, while the existence of miRNA in yellow fever virus was not tested. new antiviral treatments are based on drugs that inhibit specific viral activities such as viral proteases or polymerases. human rhinovirus, influenza A virus, hepatitis D virus, hepatitis D virus, HBV, HSV-1, HPV, JCV, EBV, and CMV in cell culture. anti-HIV RNA interference studies revealed that escape virus variants could appear which could evade the inhibitory action of siRNA. the use of AMOs to neutralize viral miRNA adds a new twist to RNA interference. polymorphism in viral miRNAs has been observed in viral-infected cell lines and in clinical samples. polymorphism in viral-encoded miRNAs has also been observed. but practical problems and other pitfalls may hamper the use of them. treatment of latently infected KSHV virus with a specific antagomir against miR-12-11 alone only modestly increased the amount of BACH protein. a cocktail of different AMOs directed against distinct viral miRNA may help to overcome this problem. a recent study successfully applied sponge miRNA to silence HBV transcripts. antisense oligonucleotides such as LNA and PMO have proven to inhibit RNA and DNA virus replication in cell culture and animal models, without toxicity for the cell or animal. studies of PMO-mediated silencing of viral miRNA have not been reported so far. anti-miR-122 silenced miR-122 and no untoward effects were observed. the coming years will certainly see the daylight of intensified research."}
