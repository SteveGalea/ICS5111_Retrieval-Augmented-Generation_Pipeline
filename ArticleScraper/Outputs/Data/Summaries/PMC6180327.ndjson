{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Rhinovirus C (RV-C) is one of three rhinovirus species of the Enterovirus (EV) genus in the Picornaviridae family of nonenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. RV-C has been associated with more severe respiratory illness than have RV-A and RV-B (3). the genome sequences were confirmed by the Picornaviridae Study Group of the international committee for the taxonomy of Viruses (10) as RV-C56. in one instance, twin 1-year-old siblings with a noticeable cough but no fever yielded nearly identical RV-C56 genomes, except for two synonymous nucleotide changes in VP3. the genome sequences of RV-C56 strains USA/2016/CA-RGDS-1002 and USA/2017/CA-RGDS-1003 have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MG950178 and MG950179. the genome sequences of RV-C56 strains have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MG950178 and MG950179."}
