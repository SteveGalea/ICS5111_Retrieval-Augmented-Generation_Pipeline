{"summary": "aim of the study is to assess the long-term secondary effects of personal experience with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009/2010. results highlight the fact that behavioural intention is not the same as behaviour, and that the latter cannot simply be taken as an indicator of the latter. influenza is an annual recurring, contagious viral respiratory infection that usually hits countries with temperate climate during the winter season. the large number of mild to moderate infections cause remarkable economic costs and have a direct impact on the affected peoples\u2019 daily life. in spring 2009, a new influenza virus was detected in Mexico, soon named A/H1N1. the illness was variously referred to as swine flu or the new flu. a health education campaign was launched to inform the public about simple non-pharmaceutical measures such as regular hand-washing or staying at home. the public was concerned about the H1N1 influenza but \u2013 as the low vaccination coverage shows \u2013 it was even more insecure regarding the recommended vaccination. studies on the public\u2019s assessment of the media\u2019s performance during the pandemic find much criticism. the media was seen as inducing fears and panic. a review of 60 international empirical studies on population reactions to recent pandemics finds that the elderly adopt more protective behaviours including vaccination than younger people. women adopt more protective behaviours other than vaccination but are less willing to get immunised than men. study links the specific real experiences and perceptions in living through a pandemic threat (H1N1) to a future hypothetical pandemic infection in order to study secondary effects of the past threat on willingness to seek vaccination in the future. however, no conclusions about potential long-term secondary effects of the 2009/10 pandemic can be made. a person might think institutions performed poorly in dealing with H1N1. a person with the same negative assessment of institutional performance might conclude vaccination, in the face of incompetence or carelessness, is reasonable. study attempts to predict vaccination behaviour with regard to a future hypothetical influenza pandemic. only a few studies used hypothetical influenza pandemics to examine predictors of precautionary behaviours, ranging from personal measures such as wearing face masks, taking antiviral drugs and finally getting vaccinated. first study to assess the long-term secondary effects of personal experience with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009/10 and the perception of the institutional reaction to it. we expect the willingness to get vaccinated against a future influenza pandemic will be higher among those who got vaccinated against H1N1 (Hypothesis 1a) and those who did not get vaccinated. a sample size of n=140 lasted from ten to 30 minutes. only persons without command of Italian were excluded. answers were possible on a scale from 1 = completely adequately to 5 = completely inadequately. the first two and two last answer options were summarised for purposes of the analysis. from ten to 30 minutes, depending on the comprehensiveness of the participants\u2019 answers and his or her memory of the H1N1 pandemic. Approximately 60 percent of approached persons agreed to participate, leading to a sample size of n=140. answers were possible on a scale from 1 = completely adequately to 5 = completely inadequately. the first two and two last answer options were summarised for purposes of the analysis. % Age 18-24 14 10.0 4,246,496 8.6 25-34 39 27.9 7,093,190 14.4 35-44 31 22.1 9,338,057 18.9 45-54 23 16.4 8,924,249 18.1 55-64 17 12.1 7,423,621 15.0 65 and above 16 11.4 12,370,822 25.0 Gender Female 76 54.3 25,805,833 52.2 Male 64 45.7 23,590,602 47.8 Education No degree/primary there was a national coverage of 4.0% of first and second doses among the italian target population consisting of healthcare workers, pregnant women, people at high risk under the age of 65. there was a national coverage of 4.0% of first and second doses among the Italian target population consisting of healthcare workers, pregnant women, people at high risk under the age of 65. 10.1% of all Italians and 11.4% of residents received a vaccine against the seasonal influenza virus in 2012-2013. the small number of people who received vaccination against the seasonal influenza virus in 2009/10 (N=4) created a minor difficulty in testing the relationship between past and future vaccination behaviour. hypothesis 1a does not receive support although one has to interpret this finding with caution due to the very small N of vaccinated people. hypothesis 2a is therefore not supported. one third of participants assessed an infection as life threatening. only 27.9% of people who did not share this belief would seek vaccination. the decision to get vaccinated in future was best predicted by past vaccination behaviour. people who normally get flu shots are five times more likely to seek immunization soon after news of a novel influenza pandemic would spread. the criticism of the institutional behaviour in managing the pandemic may not be salient to the people any more. it might also be possible that people do not take abstract factors too much in consideration when making a decision about their own health. behavioural intention is not the same as behaviour, and the latter cannot easily be taken as an indicator of the latter. this is the first study to examine possible secondary effects of the H1N1 pandemic on future willingness to get vaccinated in a European population. however, the low number of vaccinated participants is in line with the generally low H1N1-vaccination rates in Italy and worldwide and thus reflects the actual situation. Schwarzinger et al.\u2019s study was conducted in australia. it would have been fruitful to include more participants in the study who were vaccinated against the H1N1 virus. the low number of participants is in line with the generally low H1N1-vaccination rates in Italy and worldwide."}
