{"summary": "cytotoxic effects of CQ have been demonstrated for tumor cells derived from different types of human cancers (2, 13, 14) evidence suggests that CQ can also target the genome of the host cells by directly intercalating into double-stranded DNA without causing physical damage to the DNA. yeast cells have developed a variety of mechanisms to give a specific and adaptive response. the cellular response to stress usually involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. the high-osmolarity glycerol pathway operates mainly during osmotic stress. all the chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. the S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. hta2-htb2::NAT p[CEN LEU2 HTA1-HTB1-hht2(1-30)-HHT2-HHF2] H3 (1-30) C.

DCFH-DA reacts with ROS to produce the oxidized fluorescent form 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in the same buffer. western blotting was conducted as described earlier. a 1-g volume of total RNA was reverse transcribed to synthesize cDNA using a high capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Bio-Rad) real-time PCR experiments were performed by using an ABI real-time PCR instrument. relative changes in mRNA levels between control and treated groups were calculated by using the 2-CT method (35). we performed a spot test assay with wild-type cells on synthetic complete agar plates incorporated with increasing concentrations (50, 100, and 150 mM) of CQ. we have chosen concentrations similar to those which has been used on yeast cells in several published reports (22, 23, 36\u201338) wild-type yeast cells (WT 1588-4C) were grown in SC medium until the exponential phase was reached and then treated with 100 or 150 mM CQ for 24 h. growth was monitored by recording optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of untreated (Un) and treated cultures at regular intervals. clonogenic assay performed by taking equal numbers of cells from untreated or CQ (150 mM)-treated cultures. after synchronization, cells were released in either fresh (control) or 150 mM CQ-containing media. the culture was sampled at indicated time points, and cellular DNA content was analysed by FACS. we observed the growth-inhibitory effect of CQ. yeast strains harboring mutations in the N-terminal tail of H2A, H3 and H4. removal of the N-terminal tail of H4 led to hypersensitivity to CQ. not much growth inhibition was observed with deletion of the N-terminal tails. nut1 mutants or histone deacetylases (HDACs) were sensitive to CQ. rtt109, gcn5, and rpd3 mutants were sensitive to the drug. a 3-l volume of each undiluted and 10-fold serially diluted culture was spotted onto control plates containing 150 mM CQ. a yeast strain harboring a Hog1-GFP tag was grown until exponential phase. protein extracts were made from cells incubated for 1 h with 0.8 M NaCl. Western blot membranes were probed for total Hog1 using an anti-phospho-p38 antibody. a 3-l volume of each undiluted and 10-fold serially diluted culture was spotted onto control plates or SCA plates containing 150 mM CQ. cells were treated with either 0.8 M NaCl (30 min) or 150 mM CQ (60 min), and protein extracts were made. mutants with deletions of phosphatases such as Ptc1, which dephosphorylates Pbs2p, and Ptp2 which dephosphorylates Hog1p were found to be hypersensitive to CQ but not to NaCl. Western blotting was conducted to analyze the phosphorylation of Hog1 protein in HOG pathway mutants. n4 and Hot1 play an important role under conditions of osmotic stress. neither of the other mutants showed hypersensitivity to CQ. the growth-inhibitory effect of CQ was enhanced when the hog1 mutation was combined with either msn2/msn4 or sko1/hot1/msn2/msn4. phosphorylated Hog1 translocates to the nucleus, resulting in transient activation of GPD1. after phosphorylation, hog1 regulates expression of various osmoresponse genes. hog1 is phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus. CQ-induced phosphorylated Hog1 gets translocated to the nucleus. this leads to upregulation of GPD1 mRNA levels. a wild-type yeast strain was exposed to 150 mM CQ for 3 h. the central kinase of the CWI pathway, Slt2, was hypersensitive to CQ. bni1, wsc1, swi4, and rlm1 mutants exhibited enhanced growth inhibition in response to CQ exposure compared to wild-type cells. the effect of cell wall damage caused by CQ can be rescued by supplementation with 1 M sorbitol. Western blotting used phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibodies to detect dually phosphorylated Slt2p. asterisk indicates nonspecific band appeared with phospho-p44/p42. cells were fractionated and analyzed using phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibodies. compared the growth of sod1 cells to the growth of wild-type cells in the presence of 150 mM CQ. addition of 10 mM GSH or 10 mM NAC restored the growth of the sod1 mutant in the presence of CQ. this suggests the role of ROS in the toxicity exhibited by CQ. yeast saturated cultures were serially diluted (101, 102, 103, and 104) in 1.0 ml of sterile double-distilled water. pictures were taken using an HP scanner. we also analyzed the effect of the antioxidants on the growth of the slt2 or hog1 mutant in the presence of CQ. HEK293T cells were grown as described in Materials and Methods. equal numbers of cells were treated with increasing concentrations of CQ for 30 min. Western blotting was performed with anti-P38 phosphoantibody (A) or anti-P42/44 (B) phosphoantibody. wild-type yeast cells (WT 1588-4C, W3031b, and BY4741) were inoculated into 5 ml of yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) and grown overnight. growth was recorded at 48 h by scanning plates using a HP scanner. wild-type cells were cultured in SC medium to the exponential phase. wild-type cells were treated with CQ (100 or 150 mM) for 3 h. as a control, untreated cells were also grown for same duration of time. the results are consistent with an earlier report where it is demonstrated that CQ causes cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in breast cancer cell lines. it was previously reported that several antimalarial drugs, including CQ, regulate acetylation of histones in breast cancer cell lines. histone proteins are posttranslationally modified by various chromatin-modifying enzymes. either deletion of the H4 N-terminal tail or mutation of those lysine residues leads to enhanced growth-inhibitory effects of CQ. we then examined the effect of CQ on yeast mutants lacking some of the chromatin-modifying enzymes. the exposure of yeast cells to CQ results in the activation of Hog1 protein. we measured its active form, the dually phosphorylated form, by Western blotting. phosphorylation of Hog1 persisted for a prolonged time (at least 9 h) the Western blot membranes were probed for total Hog1. protein extracts were made from either cells incubated with 0.8 M NaCl. the Western signal of anti-GFP antibody served as a loading control. ssk1 (upstream control system), ste50 (upstream kinase), ssk2 (MAPK kinase [MAPKK]), pbs2 (MAPK kinase [MAPKK]), hog1 (MAPK) and ptc2 (protein phosphatases) showed patterns of sensitivity to CQ. mutants with deletions of phosphatases such as Ptc1 and Ptp2 dephosphoryl hog1 mutant is sensitive to CQ compared to wild-type cells. hog1 mutant was hypersensitive to CQ compared to wild-type cells. hog1 mutant was hypersensitive to CQ compared to wild-type cells. hog1 strain and its wild type were grown in SC medium until the exponential phase. phosphorylated Hog1 translocates to the nucleus, resulting in transient activation of GPD1. hog1 regulates expression of various osmoresponsive genes at the transcriptional level. sponse genes confirmed the expression of one such gene, GPD1 (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), involved in glycerol biosynthesis during osmotic stress (48). wild-type yeast cells were treated with CQ (150 mM) and cells were harvested at regular intervals (0, 30, 60, and 180 min) total mRNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA. yeast MAPK pathways respond to diverse signals leading to specific physiological outcomes. evidence of cross talk between such pathways is being reported. the HOG pathway is known to be involved in cell wall integrity (CWI) l volume of each undiluted and 10-fold serially diluted culture was spotted onto control plates or SCA plates containing 150 mM CQ. cells were grown at 24\u00b0C to the mid-exponential phase, and cell extracts were fractionated and analyzed by Western blotting using phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibodies. exposure to CQ causes significant growth inhibition in slt2 or hog1 mutants. the level of ROS in yeast cells was detected by DCFH-DA (2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate) after treatment with CQ, the DCF fluorescence was significantly increased in the wild-type cells. yeast saturated cultures were serially diluted (101, 102, 103, and 104) in 1.0 ml of sterile double-distilled water. cells were then stained with DCF-DA and examined by FACS analysis. HEK293T cells were grown as described in Materials and Methods. Western blotting was performed with anti-P38 phosphoantibody (A) or anti-P42/44 (B) phosphoantibody. lian p38 and the yeast Hog1 protein are stress-activated kinases. they were long thought to be activated exclusively by osmotic stress. but recent studies have indicated that this MAPK has in a role in mediating tolerance of a variety of stress conditions such as osmotic stress. other related deacetylases did not affect cellular osmosensitivity in the presence of NaCl (58). the osmotic stress-induced Hog1 phosphorylation declined after 60 min of NaCl exposure, while the CQ-induced Hog1 phosphorylation peaked at 60 to 120 min. stress response to CQ exposure and to high osmolarity (NaCl) in yeast appears to follow a comparable Hog1-dependent pathway. other types of stress conditions do not lead to importation of phosphorylated Hog1 into the nucleus. glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoded by GPD1 is overexpressed. we have demonstrated that CQ treatment induced the activation of Slt2 along with Hog1. this suggests that both of the pathways contribute to the growth-inhibitory effect of CQ. we have also identified an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as one of the reasons behind the growth inhibition of yeast cells caused by CQ. we have not tested our hypothesis on malarial parasites. we have shown that CQ targets histone proteins and the modifying enzymes. our study also revealed that CQ causes activation of the osmotic response. smotic stress and cell wall perturbation eventually causes activation of both Slt2 and Hog1 MAPK. these central kinases induce downstream effectors to mediate the stress response."}
