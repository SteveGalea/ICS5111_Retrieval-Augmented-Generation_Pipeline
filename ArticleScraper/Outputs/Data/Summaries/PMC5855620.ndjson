{"summary": "the recent epidemics caused by Zika virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) clearly illustrate the ability of emerging viruses to pose huge public health problems within a short time. new research efforts are needed to understand evolution and pathogenesis of emerging viruses. eight original studies and four review articles focus on arthropod-borne viruses. the prevalence of microcephaly in infants born to Zika virus-infected women among all pregnancies was estimated. two microRNAs, ssc-miR-204 and ssc-miR-4431, were found to target viral haemagglutinin (HA) and non-structural protein (NS), respectively, and inhibit viral replication. hepatitis viruses pose significant disease burdens worldwide and some have emerged or re-emerged in different populations. study also found a newly emerged subclade B3 and an interclade recombination between clade A and D2 strains in china. two articles report on the virus\u2013host interaction during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection which causes severe losses in the swine industry worldwide."}
