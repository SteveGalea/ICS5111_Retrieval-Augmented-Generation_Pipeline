{"summary": "human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed from HIV-1 infected donors have enormously contributed to the identification of neutralization sensitive epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. the third variable region (V3) is a crucial target on gp120, primarily due to its involvement in co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) binding. anti-V3 antibodies derived from subtype-C infected Indian patients display neutralization potential against tier 1 viruses. such activity may be limited against more resistant tier 2 viruses. gp120 has been identified as a major target for HIV-1 NAbs. the V3 loop of gp120 is highly antigenic in humans [25-28], and was previously recognized as the principal neutralizing domain of HIV-1 [29]. however its role was shown to be restricted to type specific viruses [30,31] and such an observation was supported by the extensive sequence variation in V3 from different viral isolates [32,33] fusion proteins containing consensus-C (con-C) V3 sequence (V3C-CTB) elicited a highly potent HIV-1 neutralizing response compared to other V3-CTB constructs. a limited number of mAbs have been generated so far against the HIV-1 subtype-C viruses including mAbs against the V3 loop. the complementarity determining region 3 for the heavy chain (CDRH3) were different for each mAb indicating their uniqueness (Table 2). the complementarity determining region 3 for the heavy chain (CDRH3) were different for each mAb. the binding of anti-V3 mAbs was tested by ELISA using mAbs at a concentration ranging from 10 to 0.00003 g/ml (12 dilutions) the binding of anti-V3 plasma antibodies to consensus-B and C V3 peptides was shown in terms of 50% ELISA binding titers (Max50) mAbs 277 and 903 showed binding to subtype-A, B and C derived HIV-1 proteins and peptides 2anti-V3 mAbs 1Protein/peptide Subtype I277 I903 I904 A447-52D 1418 Con-C V3 C 0.33 0.109. the antibody 904 also reacted with subtype-B V3 region. the binding activity of anti-V3 mAbs against proteins and peptides was tested by ELISA using mAbs at a concentration ranging from 10 to 0.00003 g/ml (12 dilutions) the binding activity of anti-V3 mAbs against proteins and peptides was tested by ELISA using mAbs at a concentration ranging from 10 to 0.00003 g/ml. peptides 2anti-V3 mAbs Peptide ID IIVHLNESVEIVCTRPNNNTRKSIRIGPGQTFYATGDIIGDIRQAHCNISEEKWNKTLQ 277 903 904 447-52D 1418 9256 IIVHLNESVEIVCTR >10 >10 >10 >10 >10 >10 9257 LNESVEIVCTRPNNN >10 >10 >10 >10 >10 9259 CTRPNNNT antibody binding to overlapping peptides by ELISA using mAbs at a concentration ranging from 10 to 0.00003 g/ml (12 dilutions) the 50% binding titers are depicted as numerical values in Bold (high affinity), Italic (low affinity) and >10, where Max50 value was not reached. each experiment was performed at least two independent times. binding of 447-52D to SF162 intact virus revealed a very high binding affinity (more than five folds) of mAb 447-52D compared to binding of three anti-V3 mAbs to du156.12 and JRFL at equivalent viral concentration (i,e 25 ng/ml) mAbs 277 and 903 were not able to bind JRFL due to their subtype-C specific binding activity. the virus capture is determined by measuring the level of p24 (picograms per milliliter) released when bound virus is lysed with detergent. the virus (Du156.12 and JRFL) were chosen for intact virion binding assay on the basis of their resemblance to the consensus-B and C V3 loop sequences (C) 447-52D 1418 1 MW965 1 C 0.34 0.15 0.1 0.1 >30 2 DJ263 1 A 8.2 1.7 0.4 0.1 >30 3 SF162 1 B >30 >30 0.1 >30 0.3 >30 5 92RW009 1 A >30 >30 >30 >30 6 HIV-001428 2 C >30 15.4 22.8 >30 >30 7 ZM109F.PB4 2 C >30 >30 >30 >30 8 culture supernatants of approximately 6% transformed wells tested positive for reactivity with V3C-CTB. three heterohybridomas producing anti-V3 mAbs were generated from different individuals (IDs;

(Bold), IC50 > 1 g/ml; (Italic) and >30. each experiment was performed at least two independent times. 1-25% (mean = 6%) of the transformed wells positive for binding with V3C-CTB in the first screening. the characteristic nature of the B-cells and the conditions used to immortalize them apparently affects the number and type of Ab-producing cell lines that grow out [51] the overall positive percentage of Ab secreting culture wells was relatively good and could be attributed to the high titers of anti-V3 Ab reactivity of the corresponding plasma. two anti-V3 mAbs showed binding to subtype-A or C but not to subtype-B derived proteins and peptides. mAb 904 showed cross reactive binding with subtype-B as well. binding pattern was similar to binding of polyclonal anti-V3 plasma antibodies. V Abs has pointed out a preferential usage of anti-V3 Abs [60]. such a preference was later shown to define a conserved antigenic structure. this effect has been particularly recognized for the V3 region wherein the neighboring regions including V1/V2 shield the epitopes recognized by anti-V3 Abs. 903 and 904 which display a better affinity than 277, showed neutralization of up to 19% at 30 g/ml, though not reaching IC50 neutralization titers. overall, the data suggest that higher concentrations of these mAbs may be effective in neutralization. together, these results suggest that effective concentrations for binding and neutralization may vary substantially, and the high affinity binding by mAb might be critical for neutralization. the patients had a median CD4 count of 449 cells/cubic millimeter. the whole blood samples of HIV-1 positive donors were collected in EDTA vacutainers. the plasma samples were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 1 h before using in the assays. the anti-V3 mAb 447-52D generated previously from a clade B infected individual and a mAb 1418, specific to parvovirus B19 [68] were used as control Abs in this study. the messenger RNA was extracted from hybridoma cell lines producing anti-V3 mAbs and reverse transcribed into cDNA using different gene family-specific sets of primers. a set of 12 linear overlapping peptides were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. two full length (35mer) peptides corresponding to consensus subtype-C V3 gp120 and CEF Control Peptide Pool (PP) were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. the peptides were synthesized from Sigma Genosys, USA. the peptides were HPLC purified to >95% purity. the binding activity of anti-V3 mAbs against gp120 proteins was tested. the plate was blocked with 0.5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% goat serum and 10 g of human IgG/ml. the primary isolate (SF162) with a starting p24/ml concentration of 50 ng were added. p24 in the virus lysate was quantified by using a commercial ELISA. Pseudotyped viruses were produced by co-transfection of the rev/env expression plasmid and an env-deficient HIV-1 backbone vector (pSG3Env) into exponentially dividing 293 T cells (ATCC; catalog no. 11268) e activity was measured by using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega Inc.) the 50% inhibitory concentration of mAb (IC50) was determined at which relative luminescence units (RLU) were reduced 50% compared to virus control wells. study subjects Thirty-three HIV-1 seropositive drug naive patients (18 males and 15 females) within the age range of 20\u201357 years (median = 33 years) were recruited in this study PBMCs were transformed in 96-well plates and cultured with a polyclonal B cell activator, CpG [67], which enhanced EBV infection and B cell transformation. cells from wells that test positive were expanded and fused with the heteromyeloma cell line SHM-D33 (ATCC; catalog no. 1668) PCR products were sequenced (Macrogen, South Korea) using the primers applied for amplification. a set of 12 linear overlapping peptides were obtained from Immune Technology Corp. (New York, NY) two full length (35mer) peptides corresponding to the consensus-B (CTRPNNNTRKSIHIGPGRAFYTTGEIIGDIRQAHC) (V3C) of V3 gp120, a 24mer con-C MPER (DLLALDSWKNLWNWFDITNWLWYIK) and a 19mer con-C IDR (LGIWGCSGKLICTTAVPWN) peptides of gp41 were a 96-well plate was coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with goat anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc Abs (Sigma) at 4.0 g/ml, and then anti-V3 human mAbs at a saturating level of 10 g/ml were added for 1.5 h incubation at 37\u00b0C. the plate was blocked with 0.5% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing primary isolates and pseudoviruses Eleven HIV-1 subtype A, B and C viruses including five primary isolates (MW965, DJ263, SF162, JR-CSF and 92RW009) and six pseudotyped viruses were obtained from the NIH, ARRRP. ID50 of pseudovirus was pre-incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates. freshly trypsinized TZM-bl cells were added to each well of the mAb/virus mixtures in duplicates. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. the support extended by Dr. XP Kong from new york university school of medicine is highly acknowledged. the support extended by Dr. Suman Laal is highly acknowledged."}
