{"summary": "emergence of new human CoVs of zoonotic origin has shown the potential of CoVs to cause life-threatening disease in humans. the emergence of new human CoVs of zoonotic origin has shown the potential of CoVs to cause life-threatening disease in humans. coVs are important pathogens of domestic livestock, poultry, and companion animals. the ion-activated ATPase is known for its transport function of K+ and Na+ at a ratio of 2:3 creating an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. the subunit is a large, catalytic membrane protein, containing 10 transmembrane domains that create five extracellular and four intracellular loops. well-known CTSs are the foxglove plant-derived digoxin and ouabain and the vertebrate-derived analogues bufalin and marinobufagenin (11, 12). Especially the subunit appears to be associated with a number of additional proteins. ATP1A1 is an appealing antiviral target in view of the large number of (FDA-approved) compounds available that target this protein. targeting ATP1A1 either by gene silencing or by low concentrations of the CTSs ouabain and bufalin resulted in inhibition of CoV infection at an early entry stage. HeLa-ATCC cells stably expressing mCC1a (HeLa-mCC1a) (6) HeLa-fAPN cells (33) and HeLa-ATCC cells were used for infection experiments with MHV, FIPV, and VSV. cDNAs encoding human or mouse ATP1A1 were subcloned into a pCAGGS expression vector. stocks of 125 M bafilomycin A1 (BafA1; Enzo Life Sciences), 15 mM Dyngo-4a (Abcam), 500 M wortmannin (Enzo Life Sciences), 10 mM PP2 (Sigma) and 10 M bufalin (Enzo Life Sciences) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted 1:1,000 in the experiments. transfection was done in a 62.5-l or 250-l final volume of Opti-MEM (Gibco) cells were infected at 72 h posttransfection. qRT-PCR of siRNA-mediated gene knockdowns. cells were harvested by trypsinization. sed at 7 h postinfection (hpi) (MHV, FIPV, and VSV) or 16 hpi (IAV) in passive lysis buffer (Promega) light emission was measured on a centro LB 960 luminometer. when indicated, cells were transfected with siRNAs prior to inoculation. the number of infected cells was determined by cell counts on a wide-field fluorescence microscope. the assay is based on complementation of an otherwise defective -galactosidase M15 protein by a small intravirion peptide. beta-Glo reagent (30 l/well; Promega) was added to each well, the sample was mixed and incubated for 60 min. cells were trypsinized to remove surface-bound but not internalized virus. cells were lysed, and complementation was measured as described above. LM virus was bound to cells on ice at an MOI of 0.5 for 90 min. warm medium containing 10% FBS was added, and cells were incubated for 7 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. luciferase expression was analyzed as described above. VSVG/Luc-G* bound to cells at an MOI of 0.3 in the presence of 50 nM ouabain at 4\u00b0C. unbound virus washed away with ice-cold PBS. cells were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of ouabain. cDNAs encoding human or mouse ATP1A1 were subcloned into a pCAGGS expression vector using conventional cloning methods. MHV fusion inhibitor HR2 peptide has been described before (38) and was synthesized by GenScript. 500 mM wortmannin (Enzo Life Sciences), 10 mM PP2 (Sigma) and 10 M bufalin (Enzo Life Sciences) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted 1:1,000 in the experiments. stocks of 10 mM chlorpromazine (Sigma), 20 mM U18666A (Enzo Life Sciences), and 50 M ouabain (Sigma) were prepared in H2O. cells were infected at 72 h posttransfection. qRT-PCR of siRNA-mediated gene knockdowns. cells were harvested by trypsinization, and a single-cell suspension was counted. luciferase expression was assessed using a firefly luciferase assay system. light emission was measured on a centro LB 960 luminometer. when indicated, cells were transfected with siRNAs prior to inoculation. cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.1 in FBS-containing DMEM. at 8 h postinfection, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. unbound virus was removed after binding, cells were lysed, and complementation was measured. cells were transfected with siRNA for 72 h or pretreated with drugs. the medium was replaced by warm medium containing 50 nM ouabain. at 7 hpi cells were lysed, and luciferase expression was analyzed. MHV strain A59 virus was grown in LR7 cells. inoculum was removed, and unbound virus washed away with ice-cold PBS. at 2 hpi supernatant was removed, and warm buffers at different pHs were added for 2 min. individual transfection of each of the three siRNAs targeting ATP1A1 resulted in reduced infection of cells with MHV, FIPV, and VSV but not IAV. RNAi-mediated downregulation of ATP1A1 affects MHV, FIPV, and VSV but not IAV. mRNA levels at 72 h posttransfection were measured by qRT-PCR. expression levels were corrected for cell number and viability as determined by the Wst-1 assay. dotted lines indicate the lower 95% confidence interval of negative siRNA controls (A) or mock treatment (B). MHV-N was bound to cells preloaded with fluorescein-di--d-galactopyranoside. after binding, virus was allowed to internalize and fuse. fusion of MHV was inhibited by lack of ATP1A1 relative to negative-control siRNAs. lysed, and complementation of M15 by N was determined relative to mock-treated samples using Beta-Glo substrate and a luminometer. to assay internalization, cells were preloaded with FDG by hypotonic shock before inoculation. luciferase-expressing MHV or MHV-S2\u2032FCS were transfected for 72 h. at 7 hpi cells were lysed, and firefly luciferase expression levels were determined. infection with MHV is negatively affected by downregulation of ATP1A1. a mutant of MHV (MHV-SRec) enters cells in a CEACAM1a-independent but heparan sulfate-dependent manner. the mutant enters cells in a CEACAM1a-independent but heparan sulfate-dependent manner. after 8 h of infection, cells were collected, and a negative-control siRNA was used. high concentrations of ouabain (250 nM) or bufalin (50 nM) had severe negative effects on infection with all viruses tested, both when the drug was added prior to and after inoculation. addition of small amounts of ouabain (50 nM) or bufalin (10 to 15 nM) inhibited infection with MHV, FIPV, MERS-CoV, and VSV, but only when the drugs were added prior to inoculation low levels of ouabain and bufalin affect entry of CoVs and VSV. heLa (MHV, FIPV [FIPV-H], VSV, and IAV) cells were inoculated with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 0.1 for 2 h. heLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either human or murine ATP1A1. they were inoculated with luciferase-expressing MHV, IAV, or VSV. ouabain was kept present until cells were lysed, and luciferase expression levels were determined. luciferase-expressing MHV was bound to HeLa-mCC1a cells for 90 min on ice. unbound virus was removed, and cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C to allow infection. luciferase expression levels were determined relative to those of mock-treated cells. mCC1a-M15 cells were pretreated with 50 nM ouabain or 10 nM bufalin. error bars represent standard errors of the means (n = 3 replicates of 3 for binding and internalization; n = 3 for fusion). we analyzed whether the inhibition of MHV infection by ouabain is dependent on the nature of the entry receptor used or on the depth of MHV trafficking into the endo-lysosomal pathway. we analyzed whether the inhibition of MHV infection by ouabain is dependent on the nature of the entry receptor used or on the depth of MHV trafficking into the endo-lysosomal pathway. virus infection was only inhibited when ouabain was present during inoculation. cell-impermeable MHV fusion inhibitor peptide HR2 (38) did not inhibit MHV infection. the inhibitors did not affect luciferase expression levels without prior incubation with ouabain. these results indicate that ouabain inhibits virus entry upstream of inhibitors of CME. the inhibitory effect of ouabain is not observed when the compound is removed after virus inoculation. levels were determined by measuring the luciferase activity in cell lysates relative to that of control cells treated only with ouabain. MHV particles remain associated close to the cell surface. cells were incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C in the presence or absence of ouabain. MHV covalently labeled with DyLight 488 (MHV particles) was bound to cells at an MOI of 20 for 70 min on ice. unbound virus was removed, and cell-bound virus was allowed to infect at 37\u00b0C for 90 min. luciferase-expressing VSV at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of 50 nM ouabain. cells were incubated for 2 min in warm buffers at different pHs. subsequently incubated for another 7 h in ouabain-containing medium. cells were inoculated with luciferase-expressing MHV, FIPV, or VSV. after which the drugs were present until cell lysis. at 7 hpi cells were lysed, and luciferase expression levels were determined. pNaKtide has a much smaller inhibitory effect than PP2. luciferase-expressing MHV, FIPV, or VSV can be relieved by inhibition of Src. cells were inoculated with luciferase-expressing MHV, FIPV, or VSV at an MOI of 0.1 for 2 h. infection levels were determined by measuring the luciferase activity in lysates of drug-treated cells. at 7 hpi (MHV, FIPV, and VSV) or 16 hpi (IAV), cells were lysed. as negative controls, scrambled siRNAs were used. individual transfection of each of the three siRNAs targeting ATP1A1 resulted in reduced infection of cells. infection levels were corrected for cell number and viability as determined by the Wst-1 assay. mRNA levels at 72 h posttransfection were measured by qRT-PCR relative to mock-transfected cells. MHV-N was bound to cells preloaded with fluorescein-di--d-galactopyranoside. after binding, virus was allowed to internalize and fuse. fusion of MHV was inhibited by lack of ATP1A1 relative to negative-control siRNAs. MHV-N was allowed to bind to cells on ice at an MOI of 20 for 90 min. unbound virus was washed off for the binding assay. complementation of M15 by N was determined relative to mock-treated samples. a mutant MHV (MHV-S2\u2032FCS) is cleavage activated by furin rather than by lysosomal proteases. so, cells were transfected with siRNAs for 72 h, followed by inoculation with luciferase-expressing MHV. at 7 hpi cells were lysed, and firefly luciferase expression levels were determined. negative siRNA and negative siRNA targeting ATP1A1 were included as controls. a mutant of MHV (MHV-SRec) entered cells in a CEACAM1a-independent but heparan sulfate-dependent manner. infection with MHV-SRec was reduced to the same extent as MHV infection of receptor-expressing cells. ouabain (250 nM) or bufalin (50 nM) inhibited infection with MHV, FIPV, MERS-CoV, and VSV. addition of small amounts of ouabain (50 nM) or bufalin (50 nM) inhibited infection with MHV, FIPV, MERS-CoV, and VSV, but only when the drug was added prior to inoculation. low concentrations of ouabain and bufalin inhibit infection with different CoVs. low levels of ouabain and bufalin affect entry of CoVs and VSV. no effect was observed when they were added after inoculation. heLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either human or murine ATP1A1. MHV and VSV infection of cells transfected with a plasmid was inhibited by ouabain. the inhibitory effect of ouabain on infection is directly linked to ATP1A1. se-expressing MHV, IAV, or VSV at an MOI of 0.1 until 7 h (MHV and VSV) or 16 h (IAV) postinfection levels were determined by measuring the luciferase activity in cell lysates relative to that in lysates of mock-treated cells. error bars represent standard errors of the means (n = 3 replicates of 3). error bars represent standard errors of the means (n = 3 replicates of 3 for binding and internalization; n = 3 for fusion). MHV-N was bound to M15-expressing cells pretreated for 30 min with either ouabain or bufalin. fusion signal of MHV was clearly reduced (Fig. 6B) similar results were obtained for VSV. inhibition of MHV by ouabain is dependent on the nature of the entry receptor used. MHV infection was only inhibited when ouabain was present during inoculation. cells were mock treated or treated with ouabain prior to and during inoculation with luciferase-expressing MHV. inhibitors did not affect luciferase expression levels without prior incubation with ouabain. the inhibitory effect of ouabain is not observed when the compound is removed after virus inoculation. cells were mock treated or treated with 50 nM ouabain (Ou) starting at 30 min prior to and during inoculation (0 to 2 h) and/or after removal of the inoculum (2 to 18 h). MHV particles remain associated close to the cell surface. cells were incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C in the presence of ouabain. a larger number of virions were observed in the presence of ouabain. cells were mock treated (upper two rows) or treated with 50 nM ouabain. MHV covalently labeled with DyLight 488 (MHV particles) was bound to cells at an MOI of 20 for 70 min on ice. unbound virus was removed, cell-bound virus was allowed to infect at 37\u00b0C for 90 min. cells were inoculated with luciferase-expressing VSV at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of 50 nM ouabain. at 2 hpi the inoculum was removed, and unbound viruses were washed away with ice-cold PBS. infection could be rescued by a low-pH shock. pNaKtide binds and inhibits the Na+,K+-ATPase-interacting pool of Src. cells were inoculated with luciferase-expressing MHV, FIPV, or VSV. treatment of cells with PP2 during virus inoculation reduced MHV and VSV infection by about 75%. the negative effect of ouabain on the entry of MHV, FIPV, and VSV can be relieved by inhibition of Src. cells were inoculated with luciferase-expressing MHV, FIPV, or VSV at an MOI of 0.1 for 2 h. similar results were obtained with VSV but not with IAV. low concentrations of CTSs not affecting the ion transport function of Na+,K+-ATPase. the anti-coronaviral effect could be relieved by the addition of inhibitors of Src kinases. we propose a model in which the uptake of MHV particles is arrested in preendosomal structures by transfection of siRNAs targeting ATP1A1 or by the addition of CTSs. the internalization assay depends on the removal of cell surface-bound virions by proteases. the lack of internalization inhibition observed with this assay can be explained by MHV particles accumulating in preendosomal invaginations. fusing in early endosomes (MHV-2\u2032FCS and MERS-CoV) or lysosomes (MHV and FIPV) were used (6). interference with the ATP1A1 subunit acts prior to the formation of early endosomes and does not result from a defect in endosome maturation. ouabain binding to the 1 subunit triggers a conformational change in this subunit. Activated Src induces yet unknown downstream signaling, which inhibits virus entry at an early stage upstream of the inhibitory effects of inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. ATP1A1-mediated Src signaling has been shown to induce phosphorylation of dynamin-2 and caveola-mediated endocytic uptake of cargo. but it is not yet clear how ATP1A1-mediated Src signaling could interfere with clathrin-mediated entry of CoVs and VSV. clathrin-mediated endocytosis, Src phosphorylation has also been shown to mediate endocytic sorting of these viruses. internalization of reovirus virions, however, was not affected by inhibition of Src signaling. inhibition of infection by CTSs has been reported earlier for several other viruses. viral factors may lower the probability of generating drug-resistant viral variants. repurposing of FDA-approved compounds may enable relatively fast clinical application."}
