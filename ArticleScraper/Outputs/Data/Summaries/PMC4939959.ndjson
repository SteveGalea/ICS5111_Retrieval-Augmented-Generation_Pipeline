{"summary": "PFV Gag (pr71Gag) precursor is only partially proteolysed at its C-terminus to yield a 68 kDa (p68Gag) and a 3 kDa (p3Gag) peptide. PFV Gag (pr71Gag) precursor is only partially proteolysed at its C-terminus to yield a 68 kDa (p68Gag) and a 3 PFV Gag lacks a membrane-binding domain and virus egress relies on a physical interaction between Gag and the Leader Peptide (LP) domain of the Envelope (Env) protein. PFV Env precursor comprises 988 residues and undergoes post-translational processing by cellular proteases resulting in three distinct domains. cryo-ET and microscopy (cryo-EM) to analyze isolated wild-type particles and variants with mutations in PFV Gag and Env proteins. these data are correlated to Gag assemblies analyzed in infected cells by employing high pressure freezing, cryo-substitution and electron tomography. results in vivo study of PFV infected cells. we did never observe assemblies in non-infected HT1080 cells. we speculate that they constitute assembled capsids. they accumulate in tubular membrane compartments. iFuse mutant is a variant of Env where the furine cleavage site between the gp80SU and TM domains of Env has been mutated. Particles are released at nearly wild type level from cells but are non-infectious. class B (45% of total particles) contains spherical particles with no regular, ordered internal structures. class B (20% of total particles) contains spherical particles with no regular, ordered internal structures. class D (20% of total particles) miscellaneous particles have non spherical shape. a complete capsid with the intermediate shell leads to particles with more homogeneous dimensions. the viral membrane, capsid and intermediate shell appear as distinct (separated) substructures in tomograms. the population with a constant radius often has a hexagonal outline. the intermediate shell, which strictly follows the contour of the capsid, precludes a direct interaction of the capsid with the viral membrane. despite that, local regular organization (spacing 8\u20139 nm) are visible in some tomographic slices. the iNAB mutant forms a majority of near spherical particles. their dimensions are larger than wt PFV (rmean = 53.1 10.3 nm, n = 42) on the average, more deformed and irregular particles are observed compared to wt PFV. 3D structure of PFV glycoprotein by cryo-ET Wt PFV and the iNAB mutant particles should have an identical Env structure (same amino acid sequence, same processing by proteases) the iFuse mutant lacks the gp80SU-gp48TM cleavage, which could influence the position of the fusion peptide region, but should have otherwise a similar structure than wt. the same reconstructions of iNAB and iFuse mutants (Fig 4H and 4I) show stronger resolved features for all trimers, including the one at the periphery. this was confirmed directly on tomograms where slices orthogonal to the mutant's glycoprotein long axis often display more regular hexagonal lattices than the wt. 3D reconstructions of iNAB and iFuse Env hexagonal assemblies of six trimers determined by cryo-EM. the data were refined to higher resolution imposing C6 symmetry. the iNAB Env and the iFuse mutant were computationally processed independently. gp48TM contains two potential coiled coil regions from residues 664 to 685 and 881 to 902 [25] or residues 664 to 691 and 880 to 908 [26], respectively. the length of the predicted helices is approximately 32 5 (Fig 5C\u20135E), which is consistent with 6 to 7 helical turns. the three central helices attributed to gp48 fusion peptide are represented by three green helices of 22 residues long each. the densities surrounding the three central helices and the three inner and outer TMHs are colored green, blue and orange respectively. in vivo study of PFV infected cells we prepared samples of HT1080 cells infected with replication competent wt PFV by high pressure freezing and cryo-substitution 24 to 48h post infection. Viruses with clear capsid at their center were observed budding from the plasma membrane (Fig 1A and 1C) iFuse mutant is a variant of Env where the furine cleavage site between the gp80SU and TM domains of Env has been mutated. iFuse mutant is a variant of Env where the furine cleavage site between the gp80SU and TM domains of Env has been mutated. the presence of viral proteins of wild type and mutant viruses was confirmed. PFV wt forms mainly near spherical particles. rare oval shaped viruses also exist but no tubular, elongated or more irregular structures were observed. class B (45% of total particles) is similar to A except that the central Gag core is either incomplete or disrupted resulting in an open Gag structure. class D (20% of total particles) miscellaneous particles having non spherical shape or an interior morphology significantly different from class A and B. capsid and intermediate shell appear as distinct (separated) substructures in tomograms. capsid at center of particles has relatively uniform mean radius (r 30 nm) but few exceptions with larger and less uniform shapes exist as well. the iNAB mutant is less polyhedral (hexagonal) and appears discontinuous. local regular organization (spacing 8\u20139 nm) are visible in some tomographic slices. a- Central slice through a wt PFV virus imaged by cryo-ET. wt PFV is larger than wt PFV (rmean = 45.6 8.2 nm) on the average, more deformed and irregular particles are observed compared to wt PFV. however, these particles are not empty and some diffuse densities are detected often in the vicinity of the viral membrane. central slices through tomograms show that the glycoprotein extends around 14 nm away from the membrane while sections perpendicular to the glycoprotein's long axis clearly confirm that they are trimeric. the 3D reconstruction of PFV wt, iNAB and iFuse glycoproteins by subtomogram averaging at 3 nm resolution demonstrates that all three structures have a similar knob-like shape at this resolution. iNAB and iFuse mutants have a stronger propensity to form a regular hexagonal network than the wt. the wt virus shows ordered region of glycoprotein next to less ordered one. arrows point to less well defined peripheral trimers on wt particles. the iNAB Env and the iFuse mutant were computationally processed independently. the neighboring trimers are spaced by 110 and are interacting with each other approximately 45 above the membrane level. there is no sign of ordered densities extending from the inner leaflet of the membrane towards the virus interior. the length of the predicted helices is approximately 32 5 (Fig 5C\u20135E) this is consistent with 6 to 7 helical turns as predicted by sequence analysis. the lower part of the spike is likely composed of parts of gp80SU and gp48TM, which anchor the extracellular domain in the membrane. the densities corresponding to the extracellular domains and the viral membrane are colored salmon and gray respectively in C. the three central helices are represented by three inner (colored blue) and three outer (colored orange) helices. PFV viruses containing an intact capsid (class A) have an even more uniform radius. the viral membrane that contains inserted Env trimers ends up near spherical. this is supported by in vivo observation of the same viral layout in virus infected cells. we believe capsid is derived from the Gag N-terminal domain and the cytoplasmic domain of the gp18LP respectively. secondary cleavages have also been observed at three different positions of Gag [5], however, their relevance for the virus life cycle needs to be established. PFV and Hepadnaviridae similarities. PFV capsid assembly was reported to take place at the pericentriolar region [15], we provide evidence that capsids accumulate in a membrane compartment whose origin is currently unknown. a closer interaction of the N-terminal domain of Gag with the core capsid could explain the larger capsid radius. PFV capsid assembly was reported to take place at the pericentriolar region [15], suggesting that capsids accumulate in a membrane compartment whose origin PFV Env is a class I glycoprotein due to the two predicted coiled coil regions in the gp48TM fusion protein subunit. the central gp48TM TMHs are in close proximity to interact with each other and can be considered to exert the role of a trimerization domain. mutations within gp48TM's cytoplasmic region strongly enhance the fusogenic activity of such mutant glycoproteins. the interaction might be mediated by the extracellular part of gp18LP and/or parts of gp48TM, which could act as a spacer between glycoproteins. 80% of wt PFV virions have a nearly spherical shape with an average radius of 54 nm. PFV viruses containing an intact capsid (class A) have an even more uniform radius. PFV virions contain an extra layer of intermediate density between the viral membrane and the capsid core. this also indicates that in mature virions, the Gag N-terminal and gp18LP domains are flexibly linked to the capsid core and the glycoprotein respectively. PFV capsids can be variable in morphology, but the majority has a mean radius of 30 nm with a round to hexagonal outline. the same conclusion was obtained by analyzing capsid images acquired by cryo-EM of complete virions. the same conclusion was obtained by analyzing capsid images acquired by cryo-EM of complete virions in an earlier study [16]. a closer interaction of the N-terminal domain of Gag with the core capsid could explain the larger capsid radius. the nature of these potentially capsid-like structures has to be confirmed by further experiments as it cannot be ruled out that they are only indirectly related to PFV. PFV Env gp48TM induced fusion due to presence of the gp18LP transmembrane region. mutations within its cytoplasmic region strongly enhance the fusogenic activity of such mutant glycoproteins. Bunyaviruses, having class II glycoproteins [55], are known to have local or global symmetrical arrangement of glycoprotein on the viral membrane. clusters of Env glycoproteins have been shown to be the preferred site of host cell interaction and thus entry for HIV-1 [59]. pczHSRV2 (wt) was used for production of replication-competent PFV supernatants. transfection of 293T cells with corresponding plasmids using polyethyleneimine (PEI) Hybridoma supernatants specific for PFV Env LP (Env LP, clone P3B8-B7), PFV Env SU (Env SU, clone P3E10) or PFV Gag (Gag, clone SGG-1) were employed [13,15,61] after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody, the tomograms were denoised by anisotropic diffusion in IMOD. iFuse films were recorded at a nominal magnification of 15,500 (1.32 /pixel at the camera level) films were recorded at a nominal magnification of 15,500 (1.32 /pixel at the camera level) sub tomogram averaging was done in PEET. the initial reference was an average of all the sub volumes. a cylindrical mask was applied to eliminate contributions from the neighbor spikes. masks were designed manually around each viral particle to further restrict the area where the automatic picking of glycoproteins was performed. for each micrograph, only particles having cross correlation with the reference higher that the mean correlation of all the particles were kept. the output coordinate files from FPM were converted to boxer [70] one (.box) and imported in RELION [71]. we used the particles from this class to do a last 3D autorefine. the final reconstructions include 5541 out of 29659 and 5543 out of 25680 particles for respectively iNAB and iFuse and have resolutions of 11.7 and 9.8 at FSC = 0.143. subset of 481 intact and regular particles were assembled in a stack, low pass filtered to 30 and further 2D classified in 5 classes by Multi variate Statistical Analysis in IMAGIC [72] PFV Env amino acid sequence was submitted to the GeneSilico Metaserver to predict the number and position of transmembrane helices. the freeze substitution cocktail (0.5% UrAc, 5% EtOH, 5% H20 in acetone) was added for 4h at -90\u00b0C. temperature was then raised at 20\u00b0C/h to -50\u00b0C. samples were washed with Ethanol (1h) and then infiltrated with increasing concentrations. mutant PFV vector particles deficient in nucleic acid incorporation (iNAB) were generated using the PFV Gag packaging construct pcoPG4 GR R/A. particles deficient in PFV Env fusion (iFuse) were generated using the PFV Env packaging construct pcoPE32 instead of the respective wild type packaging constructs. Western blot analysis Cells from a single transfected 100-mm cell culture dish were lysed in detergent-containing buffer. lysates were centrifuged through a QIAGEN column (QIAGEN) the blots were developed with a LAS-3000 (Fujifilm) imager and quantified using ImageGauge.
