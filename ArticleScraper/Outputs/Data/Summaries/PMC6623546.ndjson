{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a small, enveloped RNA virus classified within the family Flaviviridae, genus flavivirus. it includes medically important pathogens such as dengue virus (DENV), west Nile virus (WNV), japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) infection by ZIKV is linked to congenital defects including microcephaly and spontaneous abortion [5\u20137] and to Guillain-Barre syndrome and thrombocytopenia in adults [8, 9]. both viral and host factors have been suggested to play a role. TRIM56, a RING-type E3 ligase of the tripartite motif protein family, puts a check on intracellular RNA replication of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2), YFV, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in cell culture [24, 25], the underlying mechanism remains elusive. the inhibition on ZIKV replication by TRIM56 was not undercut in Dicer-deficient cells, indicative of a miRNA-independent antiviral mechanism. TRIM56 is an intrinsic host restriction factor of ZIKV and shed new light on the mechanism of action by which this E3 ligase curbs flavivirus replication. plasmid encoding serotype 1 DENV replicon, pACYC-DENV1-Rluc2A-Rep [30] was obtained from Ju-Tao Guo and Jinhong Chang (Baruch S. Blumberg Institute) the NS4B coding sequence of ZIKV (MR766 strain) was amplified by PCR from the cDNA of virally infected Vero cells and ligated into pEF6/V HEK293T and its clonal derivatives deficient in Dicer expression, No-Dice (2\u201320) and No-Dice (4\u201325) were provided by Bryan Cullen (Duke University Medical Center) heLa-Flp-In T-REx-ACE2 cells with tetracycline (Tet)-inducible expression of 2xHA-tagged, WT, E3 Ub ligase-deficient CC21/24AA cells were transduced with a pCX4bsr-derived retroviral vector carrying the mutant TRIM56 cDNA, followed by stable selection with blasticidin. similar strategy was adopted to establish SK-N-SH-, HEK293T- and No-Dice (4\u201325)-derived cell populations as controls. neurospheres from day 7 cultures were dissociated in DS for 10 min at 30\u00b0C, centrifuged at 200 x g, and DS was replaced with NbActiv4 neuron culture medium (BrainBits) half of the media were exchanged with fresh NbActiv4 media every 3\u20134 days; synapses and action potentials have been reported at 7 days. infections of primary mouse neuronal cultures were carried out at day 8 post-differentiation. neurons were either mock -infected (controls) or infected with ZIKV-PRVABC59 at a MOI of 1 in NbActiv4 media for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity. at 24 and 48 h after infection, 0.5 ml TRIzol was added to each well. qPCR was performed to measure the levels of miRNAs of interest relative to that of an internal control, i.e., U6 snRNA. qPCR was performed to measure the levels of miRNAs of interest relative to that of an internal control. miR-92a, 5\u2019-TATTGCACTTGTCCCGGC-3\u2019 (forward); miR-21, 5\u2019-TAGCTTATCAGACTGATGTTG-3\u2019 (forward); and miR-Rev-universal, 5\u2019-GAACATGTCTGTCTC-3\u2019 (reverse) immunoblotting analysis performed as previously described [25, 43] anti-mouse pAb was detected by mouse anti-Flag-tag M2 mAb (Sigma) rabbit anti-TRIM56 S4091 pAb was used to detect endogenous T56 protein in HeLa cell lysates.

HEK293-T3Y cells were transduced with a replication-incompetent retrovirus. surviving cells were pooled, designated as HEK293-T3Y-FH-T56 cells. similar strategy was adopted to establish SK-N-SH-, HEK293T- and No-Dice (4\u201325)-derived cells with constitutive expression of TRIM56-Flag. a pair of combined cortex and hippocampus with subventricular zone was obtained from E18 C57BL/6 mice (BrainBits, LLC) neuroprogenitor and differentiated cultures were generated based on established protocols [35, 36] to generate neural progenitor cells, tissue was suspended in Dissociation Solution (DS) consisting of Hibernate E-Ca without B27 and Papain (2 mg/ml) (BrainBits, LLC) axons and dendrites are observable by day 4. synapses and action potentials have been reported at 7 days. cells were inoculated with ZIKV in 2% FBS-containing DMEM for 1\u20132 h.
