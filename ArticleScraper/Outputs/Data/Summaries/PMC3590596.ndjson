{"summary": "the estimated low effectiveness of malaria vaccine and dengue vaccine in the field 1,2 have disappointed a certain fraction of vaccine enthusiasts. but clinical protection in infants and other groups appears to be lower than the earlier expectation based on laboratory experiments and smaller-scale clinical studies among older individuals. there is a growing need to clarify what risk factors determine successful and unsuccessful vaccines 3. if an infection involves a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections, the infection is unlikely to impose strong clinical selection pressure. iii) a high affinity to cells in blood and immune systems is considered as a variable that reflects the limited protection by humoral immunity. iii) the transmission via a common route is also considered as inversely associated with the requirement of cellular immunity. statistical data were analyzed using a statistical software JMP version 9.0.0. results A total of 18 samples of infectious diseases, including 14 diseases with successful vaccines and 4 diseases without a successful vaccine, were examined. two practical implications should be noted. the epidemiological exercise has allowed us to identify a research gap in vaccine development. pathogens would play key roles in disentangling the complexity of the protective effect of vaccination in field studies. the above-mentioned model was only aimed to learn from the existing armament of childhood vaccines. future vaccine development may be granted an opportunity to refute the simple expectation."}
