{"summary": "mAb CR3014 has been shown to completely prevent lung pathology and abolish pharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV in infected ferrets. a novel mAb was identified that neutralized CR3014 escape viruses, did not compete with CR3014 for binding to recombinant S1 fragments, and bound to S1 fragments derived from the civet cat SZ3. anti-SARS-CoV antibodies do not convert the abortive infection of primary human macrophages by SARS-CoV into a productive one. synergy between CR3014 and CR3022 may allow for a lower total antibody dose to be administered for passive immune prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection. antibodies for passive immunization can be isolated from blood taken from people who have had SARS. one of these human monoclonal antibodies\u2014CR3014\u2014had been previously made and shown to prevent lung damage in ferrets infected with SARS-CoV. if this happens CR3014 can no longer prevent these escape variants from killing human cells. a combination of two (or more) human monoclonal antibodies could be a good way to immunize people passively against SARS-CoV. it might minimize the possibility of escape variants arising, broaden the range of virus strains against which protection is provided. if the approach passes further tests, the hope is that passive immunization of people with SARS and their close contacts might reduce disease severity in infected people. in 2003 and 2004 a number of isolated SARS cases occurred again in china and other Asian countries. some of these cases were linked to laboratory or unknown exposure. others were community acquired and associated with exposure to the live game animal restaurant trade in Guangdong province. the human mAb CR3014 completely prevented lung pathology in the ferret model of SARS-CoV infection. mAb prophylaxis may be an effective means of controlling a SARS outbreak. it is important that a mAb product offer sufficient protection against all relevant strains of SARS-CoV. immune scFv phage display library was constructed from lymphocytes of a convalescent SARS patient from Singapore essentially as described [ 22]. CR3022 scFv was selected for binding to UV-inactivated SARS-CoV. anti-rabies mAb CRJA served as negative control. a CR3014/CR3022 combination with the individual potencies of the mAbs was mixed in an equimolar ratio and the neutralization potency of a serial dilution of the mix was determined. the combination index (CI) and dose reduction index (DRI) were used to quantify synergistic effects. escape viruses and wild-type SARS-CoV virus were amplified on FRhK-4 cells. the nucleotide sequence of the SARS-CoV S open reading frame (ORF) was determined. each escape virus and wild-type SARS-CoV virus was incubated for 1 h. recombinantly expressed S fragment comprising amino acids 318\u2013510 (S318\u2013510) was incubated with nonsaturating amounts of biotinylated IgG in the presence or absence of competing IgG. biotinylated IgG was detected with streptavidin-conjugated-HRP. samples were injected in duplicate at a flow rate of 30 l/min. the sensor chip surface was regenerated with a 5 l pulse of 5 mM NaOH. RNA was isolated from infected macrophages at 6 and 24 hours postinfection using the RNeasy Mini kit. RNA levels were normalized for levels of -actin mRNA. mAb CR3014 was isolated from a semisynthetic single-chain variable antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library. the mixture was inoculated onto 96-well plate containing a 80% confluent culture of fetal rhesus kidney cells. the FRhK-4 cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C and observed after 3\u20134 d for the development of CPE. the mAb concentrations required for 50% and 100% neutralization were calculated from two-fold dilution series according to the Spearman-Karber formula. dilutions were prepared in medium and added to wells containing FRhK-4 cells. wells were overlaid with agarose containing mAbs at the above concentration and incubated for 3\u20135 d at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2. the escape viruses were amplified on FRhK-4 cells. the neutralization index was determined by subtracting the number of infectious virus particles (expressed as log TCID 50/ml) produced in FRhK-4 cell cultures infected with virus in the presence of mAb from the number of infectious virus particles. an index lower than 2.5 was considered evidence of escape. surface plasmon resonance analyses were performed at 25 \u00b0C on a BIAcore3000 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). CM5 sensorchips and running buffer HBS-EP were from Biacore AB. RNA was isolated from infected macrophages at 6 and 24 hours postinfection using the RNeasy Mini kit. RNA levels were normalized for the levels of -actin mRNA. all five escape variants were completely refractory to neutralization with CR3014. mAb CR3022 Neutralizes CR3014 Escape Variants of SARS-CoV by Binding Noncompetitively to the RBD of the Spike Glycoprotein An antibody phage display library was constructed from RNA isolated from a convalescent SARS patient originating from Singapore. CR022 was shown in ELISA to bind noncompetitively with CR3014 to the recombinantly expressed RBD of the S glycoprotein of wild- CR3014 did not prevent binding of a recombinant S fragment composed of amino acids 1\u2013565 to Vero cells. the sequences of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of CR3022 were deposited at GenBank. variant fragments from strains GZ02 (K344R), Sin3408 (S353F), Shanghai LY (R426G and N437D), GZ-C (Y436H), Sino1\u201311 (Y442S), BJ302 cl. 2 (N479S), SZ3 (K344R, F360S, N479K, and T487S), and GD03T0013 (K344R, F360S the individual K D values for CR3014 and CR3022 were 16.3 nM and 0.125 nM, respectively; for the antibodies binding simultaneously was 5.71 nM; for binding of CR3014 to CR3022-saturated S318\u2013510 was 14.8 nM. neither simultaneous nor sequential binding of the mAbs resulted in changes of K D that could explain synergistic neutralizing action through cooperative binding. a representative experiment of three independent experiments is shown. total RNA was extracted at 6 and 24 hours postinfection. the bars represent mean of duplicate viral load titrations. in the control experiment, * indicates an aberrant result. up to 60 g/ml CR3022 did not result in the generation of neutralization escape variants (unpublished data) mAbs CR3014 and CR3022 Neutralizes CR3014 Escape Variants of SARS-CoV by Binding Noncompetitively to the RBD of the Spike Glycoprotein An antibody phage display library. CR3014 (A) and CR3022 (B) were analyzed in presence of competitor CR3014 (open circles), CR3022 (closed circles), and control mAb (open squares) Binding is expressed as percentage of binding without competitor. CR3022 also binds to the RBDs of SARS-CoV-like isolate SZ3 isolated from a civet cat. CR3014 and CR3022 neutralize SARS-CoV synergistically. a combination index (CI) of less than 1, indicating synergistic neutralization, was observed in three independent experiments for both 50% and 100% neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV. CR3014 also slightly enhanced neutralization of escape viruses by CR3022. CR3022-saturated S318\u2013510 was 14.8 nM compared to dose reduction indices of 4.5 and 20.5 for CR3014 and CR3022 respectively. neither simultaneous nor sequential binding of the mAbs resulted in changes of K D that could explain synergistic neutralizing action through cooperative binding. mAbs can be neutralized synergistically by human mAbs targeting the receptor-binding domain of the virus. the combination of two mAbs expanded the breadth of protection and controlled potential immune escape variants. progress has been made in understanding the target of the neutralizing immune response through immunization with whole killed virus or vector-expressed full-length S or S fragments. mAbs appear to be predominantly directed against a domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein, defined by amino acids 318\u2013510. the neutralizing potency of the mAb correlated directly with their ability to block the interaction with ACE2. the human mAb CR3014 reduced SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of infected ferrets, completely prevented the development of lung lesions and abolished viral shedding in the pharyngeal secretions of the animals. the observation that passive immunization is successful in controlling outbreaks of hepatitis A virus and protecting against varicella-zoster and respiratory syncytial virus infection argues for the feasibility of an emergency immune prophylaxi the RBD of human SARS-CoV isolates is highly conserved. alignment of 114 sequences published in GenBank revealed only eight different S sequences not identical to the FM1 strain. of all human isolates SARS-CoV-like isolate GD03T0013, the highest RBD divergence and closest relatedness to civet cat strains. CR3014/CR3022 combination neutralizes wild-type SARS-CoV synergistically in vitro. a similar strategy was previously pursued to develop a mAb for postexposure prophylaxis of rabies. RNA recovered from single patient samples and adaptive mutations induced by repeated cell culture passage have been reported. CR3022 could interfere with binding of the S1 subunit to a known or unknown coreceptor of the virus. the mechanism by which the two mAbs neutralize SARS-CoV synergistically therefore remains presently elusive. ADE in feline infectious peritonitis virus infection is mediated by increased macrophage uptake of virus in the presence of neutralizing antibody. a combination of neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV has the potential to control SARS-CoV infection with a high level of efficacy and safety, and possibly at reduced economic cost. the sequences of the CR3022 variable regions of the heavy and light chains are deposited in GenBank under accession numbers DQ168569 and DQ168570 respectively. the sequences of the CR3022 variable regions of the heavy and light chains are deposited in GenBank under accession numbers DQ168569 and DQ168570."}
