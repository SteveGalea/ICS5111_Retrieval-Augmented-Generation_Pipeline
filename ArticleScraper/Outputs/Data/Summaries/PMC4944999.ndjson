{"summary": "influenza A virus is an enveloped virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. it can cause annual epidemics and infrequent pandemics. in 2009 the pandemic swine origin influenza A H1N1 virus and the outbreak of H7N9 in 2013 reminded the world of the threat of pandemic influenza. antibodies binding to hemagglutinin conserved among serotypes have been developed. development, production and quality control of antibodies is expensive and time consuming. HA-binding peptides have been recently obtained by phage display. the binding site is conserved among several HA serotypes. we used complementary experimental and theoretical approaches to select HA binding VH-CDR peptides. we could demonstrate a broader specificity of the selected peptides. the split vaccine Pandemrix (GlaxoSmithKline) of influenza strain A/California/7/2009 H1N1, NIH accession No. ACP44189 (California H1N1) were used. protein concentrations were determined using standard BCA assay. antibody derived peptides were extended with an N-terminal lysine linker: KKKK-SGFLLISN-amide (PeA-Lys), KKKK-FYDYDVFY-amide (PeB-Lys), KK-\u00dfA\u00dfA-LGVIWAGGNTNY-amide (PeC-Lys) in the SPR based screen for virus binding, single and double mutated variants of PeB-Lys LDI-TOF (microflex LT, Bruker Daltonik), and ESI (Q-TOF micro, Micromass) could be stored for at least one year at -20\u00b0C. stock solutions of PeB, PeBGF and PeBP were prepared by initial dissolving in DMSO. dilution in PBS (8 mM peptide with 10% DMSO v/v) neutravidin (100 g ml-1) was immobilized by amine coupling at pH 5.5. biotinylated sialyllactose was then injected at a concentration of 10 g ml-1 in HBSP for 3 min. s of virus and inhibitor were mixed and subsequently incubated for at least 15 min. all data were referenced against buffer or inhibitor injection of identical concentration. inhibition was calculated against the mean value of at least five binding events with the virus alone. mean values of triplicate experiments for mutant peptides (CM x 100/Cfetuin) are given relative to contrast of positive control fetuin (CM x 100/Cfetuin) in percent with CPeB set to zero. experimental data can be obtained from GEO accession GSE78700, ID 200078700. ichi H3N2 or Rostock H7N1 viruses were incubated with human or turkey erythrocytes, respectively, to yield agglutination (in the absence of an inhibitor) hemagglutination units (HAU) containing 2107 virus particles were added to all wells after 30 min incubation at room temperature. unbound virus was added to the cells and maintained for 1 h at room temperature. 30,000 MDCK II cells were added to each well, followed by incubation for 18 h. mouse monoclonal, 1:1000 in antibody diluent: PBS, 0.3% Tween 20 (v/v) and 5% (w/v) nonfat, dry milk. a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added for another hour. -phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) in citrate (0.05 M phosphate-citrate, 0.03% sodium perborate, pH 5.0 s HA-PeA, HA-PeB, HA-PeC and HA-PeBGF were built using the AMBER14 package of programs. original coordinates for all atoms were taken from crystal structure PDBid = 2VIR. in each case, the antibody moiety excepting the sequence of the peptide under study was erased. mol-1 -2 restraint on each complex at a pressure of 101,325 kPa was performed. after 1 ns without restraint equilibration phase, a 10 ns simulation at constant pressure was carried out. the coordinates were stored every 10 ps, resulting in 1000 configurations. the solvation free energy, Gsolv, is approximated as the sum of the polar (Gpol) and the nonpolar contribution (Gnp) using a continuum representation of the solvent according to G solv = G pol + G np x SASA + b Here, = 0.00378 kcal mol-1 -2 and b = -0.5692 kcal mol-1. the electrostatic contribution to the solvation free energy was estimated from the Poisson the polar solvation free energy, GPB, was estimated using the pbsa module of Amber. influenza strain A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 X31 (Aichi H3N2), reassorted with A/PuertoRico/8/1934 H1N1, and low pathogenic A/Mute Swan/Rostock/R901/2006 H7N1 K3141 (Rostock H7N1) were harvested from allantoic fluid of hemagglutination inhibition assays (HAI) were performed using either human erythrocytes (-2,6\u2019-sialosugars) for Aichi H3N2 or turkey erythrocytes (-2,3\u2019-sialosugars) for Rostock H7N1. all lysine variants were purchased from Biosyntan or Genecust with >95% purity. peptides were dissolved in water and diluted in appropriate buffers for immobilization on SPR sensor chips. CD spectra of 100 g ml-1 peptide solutions were recorded at 1 nm wavelength steps. primary signal in millidegrees (mdeg) was recorded over 4 s. molar ellipticity (mrw, [deg cm2 dmol-1 103] was calculated. peptide binding experiments were run, with immobilized HA or Aichi H3N2. double referencing of binding curves was performed, using a control flow cell without ligand. microarray-based substitutional analysis of peptide PeB was performed using a pepStar\u00ae peptide library spotted on glass slides by JPT Peptide Technologies. the slides were used without additional treatment. the substrate 4-Methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl--D-neuraminic acid sodium salt was obtained from Carbosynth. the fluorescence of the cleaved product 5-Methyl-umbelliferone was detected by the FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader. 50 l of a 1% erythrocyte solution (2106 cells l-1) was added, gently mixed and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. the lowest inhibitor concentration is necessary to achieve complete inhibition of hemagglutination caused by the influenza virus. CK treated trypsin, 100 U ml-1 penicillin and 100 g ml-1 streptomycin. 20 l MTS solution was added to each well followed by 2 hours incubation at 37\u00b0C. microneutralization assay performed according to protocol of Klimov et al. in antibody diluent conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added for another hour at room temperature. -phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) in citrate was added for approximately 30 minutes. reaction stopped with 0.5 M sulfuric acid and absorbance of the reaction product in the microwell plate was recorded at 490 nm. the resulting truncated octahedral box size was nearly 108 x 108 x 108. an appropriate number of chloride ions were added to keep the total system charge neutral. the temperature was fixed at 300 K using a Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency of 2 ps-1. Molecular Mechanics\u2014Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area calculations were performed. the binding free energy of the receptor-ligand complex, Gbind, is determined from G bind = G com - G rec - G lig. the free energy G for each species is estimated from G = E MM - G solv - T MM S. the popular linear Poisson-Boltzmann method was used to estimate the polar component of the solvation free energy. the electrostatic contribution to the solvation free energy was estimated using the pbsa module of Amber. i H3N2) was analyzed to identify peptide sequences of the Fab fragment at the HA contact area [26]. peptides PeA, PeB and PeC were derived containing as a core the CDR sequences. peptide-HA complexes were simulated in explicit water model for 10 ns using MD. peptide PeA dissociated from HA within the simulation time of 10 ns. peB fits best the conserved SA binding site of Aichi H3N2 HA. the binding free energy was decomposed into contributions of the individual peptide residues. the binding free energy was decomposed into contributions of the individual peptide residues (Fig 2B, PeB) tinin Binding of Aichi H3N2 virus to surface immobilized peptides was measured using SPR. peptides PeA-Lys, PeB-Lys, and PeC-Lys containing lysine residues acting as spacer were used. the N-terminus of PeB does not significantly contribute to binding of the peptide to HA. no binding was observed with the three variants, suggesting that the binding of virus is indeed specific to the CDR sequence. the results also exclude the possibility that binding is mediated by the oligolysine terminus. neuraminidase inhibitor DANA (N-Acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid), serving as a positive control, inhibited neuraminidase activity (IC50 2.2 0.3 M) PeB did not reduce the catalytic activity of the enzyme up to 360 M peptide concentrations. Aichi H3N2 was labeled with a protein reacting fluorophore. substitution of D6 generally leads to an increased binding signal. s, predicting that this residue causes repulsive forces by interacting with HA. most substitutions (out of D, G, T) of F10, which was predicted to provide high attractive contribution (-3.0 kcal mol-1), reduced the obtained fluorescence signal. for some substitutions of Y11 we observed also an enhanced binding of virus. D6G and Y11F mutations decreased the contribution of free energy changes of these residues. Y11F alters only moderately its interaction with HA, but it induces a favorable contribution change in the interaction of its neighbor residue phenylalanine 10 with HA. inhibitor constant Ki(HAI) [M] from hemagglutination inhibition experiments with its SEM (n3). mean values of IC50 [M] from infection inhibition (Fig 7B and 7C) are presented together with its SEM (n3). hemagglutination by both viral strains was not inhibited by PeBP. Ki(HAI) values represent the minimum concentration for full hemagglutination inhibition. both peptides protected effectively MDCK II cell from infection. the IC50 values for Aichi H3N2 were somewhat lower (3\u20135 fold) with respect to the MTS assay. the results are promising for developing multivalent inhibitors. peptide peBGF showed an higher inhibitory potency than PeB. mucroporin M-1 showed strong hemolytic effects and strong interference with gold surfaces. 3D structure of Fab-hemagglutinin complex of the antibody HC19 was analyzed to identify peptide sequences of the Fab fragment at the HA contact area [26]. peA interacting with HA in proximity to the sialic acid binding pocket (yellow) peB interacting with HA in proximity to the sialic acid binding pocket (yellow) peB interacting with HA in proximity to the sialic acid binding pocket. we selected PeB as a potential inhibitor of virus binding to host cells. peB displayed no secondary structure elements in solution at physiological pH. detailed analysis of electrostatic, van der Waals and polar contributions to the free energy change of each residue is presented in S3 Fig. attractive contributions originate from residues S136 (-3.0 kcal mol-1), N137 (-1.8 kcal mol-1), and L194 (-1.0 kcal mol-1), whereas the most significant repulsive contribution is caused by E190 (1.1 kcal mol-1) mol mm-2, PeB-Lys (0.57 pmol mm-2) and PeC-Lys (1.93 pmol mm-2). the SPR signal at 10 s after terminating injection was taken as binding response. the minimum detection level was 0.19 g and 6.25 g Aichi H3N2 virus protein ml-1. all proteins were diluted to a concentration of 10 g ml-1. inverse experiment using surface immobilized HA from Aichi H3N2 was performed. etuin contains -linked 2,3\u2019- and 2,6\u2019-sialic acids, which are the HA binding constituents on the surface of epithelial cells. peB also prevented binding of Aichi H3N2 to 2,6\u2019-sialyllactose immobilized on a SPR chip. the main contributions of peB binding to HA originate from residues 4 to 12 of the peptide. in each of them, the full-length sequence was preserved except for one amino acid from the eight loop-forming amino acids of the original PeB peptide (ARDFYDYDVFYYAMD) all substitutions of Y11 lead to enhanced affinity. we were interested in variants showing binding to influenza virus strains. the best variant was PeBGF with the sequence ARDFYGYDVFFYAMD. PeBGF showed a 6-fold lower IC50 (13 M vs 75 M) for inhibition of Aichi H3N2 binding to a fetuin-immobilized SPR surface. compared to PeB, peBGF showed a minor tendency to bind to immobilized fetuin, which becomes obvious from calculated inhibition values higher than 100%. peB, PeBGF and PeBP effectively prevented Aichi H3N2 mediated aggregation of red blood cells (RBC) as assessed by HAI. however, PeBGF was much more efficient in comparison to PeB. all three peptides did not impair cell viability within 24 h treatment. similar results were obtained from a microneutralization assay. IC50 values of Rostock H7N1 were similar to that obtained by the MTS based infection inhibition assay. only the entry blocker EB showed superior hemagglutination inhibition, revealed by its 20-fold lower Ki(HAI) as compared to PeBGF. however, due to its amphiphilic character, EB forms micelles and thus may act in a multivalent manner. three peptides\u2013PeA, PeB and PeC\u2013have been derived from the three CDR sequences of the HC19 antibody\u2019s heavy chain. binding of surface immobilized peptide PeB to HA from Aichi H3N2 was superior to PeC. hemagglutinin from Aichi H3N2 is 28 8 nM [47] but weak binding interactions for shorter monomeric peptides could be enhanced by a multivalent interaction. extensions of the C- and N-termini of the CDR sequences could be important for (i) the formation of a stable peptide structure. mutation of residue 6 (D6G), replacing a charged amino acid by a neutral one, resulted in two major changes. a change is largely overcome by an increase in the contribution to the polar solvation free energy change (S3 Fig) residues 6 and 8 are located in close contact to each other in the loop region. hemagglutinin in PDB 1ken (antibody HC63, amino acids 97\u2013109: AAFYYDYDFFFDY) and PDB 2vir (antibody HC19, amino acids 97\u2013109: RDFYDYDVFYYYAM) is a human antibody against H3: (EGDYDILTGYYYYFDY), respectively. a recent human antibody against H1 shows a higher proportion of aromatic amino acids in the HCDR3 similar strain-dependent efficiencies have been obtained by L\u00f3pez-Martinez et al.. a peptide was designed against broadly conserved epitopes, but the antiviral efficiency was not the same against all tested serotypes. oligosaccharides constituting the natural receptors of hemagglutinin on mammalian epithelial cells exhibit a millimolar 1:1 affinity. a trivalent glycopeptide mimetic containing three sialyl residues matching the three sialyl binding sites in a HA trimer was reported to bind to H5 hemagglutinin 4000 fold better than the monomer. binding of surface immobilized peptide PeB to HA from Aichi H3N2 was superior to PeC. the IC50 values are in the range of 75\u2013120 M, depending on the assay. peB adopts a strand-loop-strand conformation with the loop consisting of residues D6 to Y11. most of these contributions are attractive (negative free energies changes) but some are repulsive (positive free energies changes) residues 6 and 8 are located in close contact to each other in the loop region. substitution of D6 by an uncharged residue in PeBGF may induce a slight reorganization in the loop structure. peptides PeB and PeBGF were found to bind to HA of other strains. a recently published human antibody against H1 shows a higher proportion of aromatic amino acids in the HCDR3 domain, too. the crucial role of an Asp residue and hydrophobic amino acids in the HA binding of many receptor mimicking antibodies is highlighted by Lee et al [13]. a peptide was designed against broadly conserved epitopes. the antiviral efficiency was not the same against all tested serotypes. short oligomeric biomolecules with sufficient affinity are of high interest. a trivalent glycopeptide mimetic containing three sialyl residues matching the three sialyl binding sites in a HA trimer was reported to bind to H5 hemagglutinin 4000 fold better than the monomer. a multivalent presentation of the short s2 peptide (ARLPR) with a dendrimer resulted in sub-micromolar inhibitory activities. enzyme activity in the presence of the inhibitor DANA (N-Acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid) was measured after enzymatic conversion of MUNANA (4-Methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl--D-neuraminic acid) by neuraminidase following a known protocol. injection of virus was initiated at t = 69 s and terminated at t = 569 s. numbers indicate virus injections at concentrations of up to 50 g ml-1. lines represent a sigmoidal fit model of the data. data just represent qualitative relation between PeB mutants within single influenza strains. quantitative comparison is not valid due to the varying types of samples. precise quantitation fails due to unknown ligand density (most likely varying per peptide)"}
