{"summary": "attachment factors facilitate the concentration of the incoming virus particles on the cell surface but do not actively promote entry and mediate signals. receptors bind the viruses, promote entry, and activate cellular signaling pathways. glycan-dependent viruses use glycoepitopes as receptors, binding to negatively charged sialic acids. six unclassified caliciviruses may represent new genera, tentatively named Bavovirus (12, 13), Nacovirus (13\u201315), Recovirus (16), Salovirus (17), Sanovirus (18), and Valovirus (19). caliciviruses are important etiologic agents in humans and animals, causing a variety of diseases. HBGAs are complex carbohydrates linked to glycoproteins or glycolipids found in red blood cells and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts. they can also be secreted as free oligosaccharides into bodily fluids, such as saliva, intestinal content, milk, and blood (2, 8). each step is catalyzed by specific glycosyltransferases, such as -1,2 fucosyltransfera 5, FUT6, FUT7, and FUT9 genes generate the Lewis antigens by adding a fucose residue at either the -1,3 or -1,4 linkage position of the N-acetylglucosamine. the genus Nebovirus contains one established type species, Newbury-1 virus, that contains Nebraska-like and Newbury-1-like clades (37, 38) BNeV VLPs produced from the Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian (Sf9) cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus rMA415 had a size of 35 to 40 nm. hyperimmune antiserum appeared empty by electron microscopy due to the lack of viral nucleic acids. Western blotting with rMA415 hyperimmune antisera detected a 58-kDa cells were immunostained using the rabbit hyperimmune serum against BNeV capsid protein and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. the scale bars for left and right panels correspond to 50 m. the carbohydrate moieties were removed from MDBK cells by pretreatment with sodium periodate (NaIO4). cells were incubated with the AF594-labeled BNeV VLPs and P particles of human noV VA387 strain, FCV F9 strain, and CVB3 Nancy strain at 10 g/ml. the [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled BNeV VLPs, control FCV F9 strain, or CVB3 Nancy strain (50,000 cpm) was bound to MDBK, CRFK, or He terminal SAs are not recognized by BNeV for attachment. caliciviruses, including FCV, PSaV, and MNV, use terminal SAs as attachment factors. BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors. the AF594-labeled BNeV VLPs, FCV F9 strain, and P particles of human noV VA387 strain and CVB3 Nancy strain were added to the cells at 10 g/ml. the [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled BNeV VLPs, control FCV F9 strain, or CVB3 Nancy strain (50,000 cpm) was bound to MDBK, CRFK, Caco-2 the human rotavirus G11P[25] Dhaka6 and bovine rotavirus G6P[5] WC3 strains were bound to their corresponding HBGA types. the supernatant of wild-type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and GST had no binding affinity to any HBGA. these results indicate that BNeV VLPs recognize a wide spectrum of HBGAs. treatment with 1,2-l-fucosidase, 1,3/4-l-fucosidase, -galactosidase, or -N-acetylgalactosaminidase significantly decreased the binding of BNeV VLPs to the H type disaccharide, H1 and H2 types. pretreatment with 1,3/4-l-fucosidase resulted in a significant reduction in the binding of pretreatment of the gal3Gal4GlcNAc HBGA with -galactosidase cleaves the Gal epitope in Gal3Gal4GlcNAc HBGA had no inhibitory effect on binding of BNeV VLPs to synthetic Gal3Gal4GlcNAc HBGA. however, it significantly reduced binding of the control GST-VP8* protein of the bovine rotavirus P[5] WC3 strain to a saliva-binding assay was performed with the BNeV VLPs, the GST-P particles of the HuNoV strain VA387, and the GST-VP8* proteins of the bovine rotavirus P[5] strain WC3 and human rotavirus P[25] strain Dhaka6. the expression levels of each HBGA in the bovine and human saliva samples were examined by enzyme immunoassays as described elsewhere. the horizontal red line represents the OD values for BNeV VLP binding for each saliva sample. the horizontal blue line represents the OD values for VP8* protein of bovine rotavirus WC3 strain. the GST-VP8* protein of the human rotavirus strain was tested as a positive control for binding to a panel of saliva samples from 53 human individuals. binding of BNeV VLPs to each sample was visualized using TMB and measured at 450 nm in three independent experiments. pretreatment of saliva samples with mixture of 1,2-l-fucosidase and 1,3/4-l-fucosidase resulted in greater inhibition. -galactosidase and -N-acetylgalactosaminidase did not inhibit binding of BNeV VLPs to any of the selected bovine saliva samples. pretreatment of the bovine saliva samples with -galactosidase reduced the binding with the the GST-VP8* protein of the bovine rotavirus WC3 strain was used as a positive control. four saliva samples expressing either A type (H+/A+/B) or H type (H+/A/B) HBGAs were used to remove 1,2-linked fucose, 1,3/4-linked fucose, Gal, and GalNAc epitopes from HBGAs in the saliva samples by individual or combinatorial enzyme pretreatment. pretreatment of each saliva sample with a mixture of 1,2-l-fucosidase and 1,3/4-l-fucosidase inhibited the BNeV binding significantly more than that with either 1,2-l-fucosidase or 1,3/4-l-fucosidase individually. these results confirmed the wide HBGA-binding spectrum of BNeV VLPs through recognition of 1,2-linked fucose and 1,3/4 caco-2 cells were selected to check whether 1,2-fucose and 1,3/4-fucose epitopes are used as BNeV attachment factors. binding of AF594-labeled BNeV VLPs to each cell line was then examined both before and after removal of all of the corresponding HBGAs expressed in each cell line by pretreatment with -galactosidase. pretreatment of cells with -galactosidase markedly removed Gal residue from MDBK cells. a mixture of 1,2-l-fucosidase and 1,3/4-l-fucosidase significantly removed fucose residues from Caco-2 cells. these effects became more apparent when the cells were pretreated with the mixture. this suggests that 1,2- and 1,3/4-linked fucose residues not detected by these reagents nevertheless support 1,2-linked fucose, 1,3/4-linked fucose, Gal, GalNAc epitopes, or 1,2- and 1,3/4-linked fucoses together were pretreated with or without each individual enzyme or combinations of the enzymes. all experiments were performed three independent times, and panels A to C show one representative set of results. binding of BNeV VLPs was very prominent in CHO cells expressing H type 2 HBGA (H+/A/B) it was also detected, although less extensively, with A (H+/A+/B) and B (H+/A/B+) types. as expected, CHO cells expressing HBGA had no BNeV VLP binding. the above-described results showed that the BNeV VLPs had no binding specificity for terminal SAs on the cultured cell surface. removal of terminal or internal parts of cell surface carbohydrate moieties using 1 or 10 mM NaIO4 pretreatment could influence the attachment of BNeV to bovine duodenal epithelium was examined. cose, 1,3/4-linked fucose, Gal, or GalNAc epitopes of HBGAs were selected and then pretreated with 1,2-l-fucosidase, 1,3/4-l-fucosidase, -galactosidase, or -N-acetylgalactosaminidase either individually or in dual combination. pretreatment of duodenal sections with 1,2-l-fuco BNeV VLPs can attach to bovine as well as human glycan compounds on the surface of epithelial cells containing 1,2-linked fucose and 1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes. HBGA epitope-specific enzymes cleaved -1,2-linked fucose, -1,3/4-linked fucose, Gal, or GalNAc prior to incubation with BNeV VLPs at 10 Western blotting with rMA415 hyperimmune antisera detected a 58-kDa protein as expected and consistent with previous reports on other caliciviruses. the rMA415 VLPs were purified by CsCl gradients from the cell culture supernatants of rMA415-infected Sf9 cells and visualized by negative staining with 3% phosphotungstic acid. HBGA-dependent VLPs from the HuNoV strain VA387 showed a binding pattern similar to that of BNeV, indicative of binding to neutral sugars. however, 1 or 10 mM NaIO4 pretreatment had no inhibitory effect on the binding of the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) strain Nancy. radioisotope-labeled BNeV VLPs and the FCV and CVB3 strains were incubated with cells that were not pretreated or were pretreated with NaIO4. binding of BNeV VLPs increased to 124% with the 1 mM NaIO4 treatment and decreased to 55% with the 10 mM NaIO4 treatment. terminal SAs are not recognized by BNeV for attachment. the binding of BNeV VLPs to cells increased to 123%. a similar degree of enhanced binding was observed in the cells treated with HBGA-dependent HuNoV P particles. however, SA-dependent FCV showed a marked reduction in cell binding. BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors. BNeV VLPs recognize a wide spectrum of HBGAs. the recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-P particles of the human rotavirus VA387 and the GST-VP8* proteins of the human rotavirus G11P[25] Dhaka6 and bovine rotavirus G6P[5] WC3 strains. the binding of each HBGA to target viral proteins was determined by addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. 1,2-Linked fucose, 1,3/4-linked fucose, Gal, and galNAc epitopes were removed from each synthetic HBGA coated in each well using the corresponding enzyme. actose significantly decreased the binding of BNeV VLPs to the H type disaccharide, H1 and H2 types. pretreatment with 1,3/4-l-fucosidase resulted in a significant reduction in binding of BNeV VLPs to SLea, Lex, SLex, and Ley. BNeV VLPs recognize both 1,2-linked fucose and 1,3/4-linked fucose epitope BNeV VLPs recognize fucose residues in 1,2 and 1,3/4 linkages. 1,2-linked fucose, 1,3/4-linked fucose, gal, and galNAc epitopes were removed from each synthetic HBGA using the corresponding enzyme. the signal intensities were visualized by TMB at 450 nm. the bovine saliva samples contained individually various levels of A type, H type 2, Ley, and Gal3Gal4GlcNAc HBGAs. the human saliva samples also had variable levels of HBGAs. expression levels of each HBGA were determined using mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for each HBGA. eV VLPs bound to HBGAs in the bovine and human saliva samples. as a positive control, the recombinant GST-VP8* protein of the bovine rotavirus strain WC3 bound to bovine saliva samples. analogous result was obtained for binding to a range of human saliva samples, regardless of the contents of individual HBGAs. the effect of pretreating saliva samples with 1,2-l-fucosidase, 1,3/4-l-fucosidase, -galactosidase, or -N-acetylgalactosaminidase, either individually or in combination, was examined. pretreatment of saliva samples with -galactosidase and -N-acetylgalactosaminidase resulted in greater inhibition. pretreatment of the bovine saliva samples with -galactosidase reduced binding. VP8* protein of the bovine rotavirus P[5] strain WC3 was used as a positive control. bovine rotavirus strain WC3 was determined by a saliva-binding assay using hyperimmune serum against VP8* protein. six human saliva samples expressing either A type (H+/A+/B) or H type (H+/A/B) were used to remove 1,2-linked fucose, 1,3/4-linked fucose, Gal, and GalNAc epitopes from HBGAs. expression levels of BNeV-binding HBGA epitopes were examined in several cell lines using antibodies specific for each HBGA. bovine kidney epithelial MDBK, porcine kidney epithelial LLC-PK, canine kidney epithelial MDCK, and feline kidney CRFK cells solely expressed Gal3Gal4GlcNAc HBGA. ucosidase, 1,3/4-l-fucosidase, -galactosidase, or -N-acetylgalactosaminidase. removal of gal from gal3Gal4GlcNAc HBGA by pretreatment with -galactosidase had no inhibitory effect on BNeV binding to the MDBK cells. a mixture of 1,2-l-fucosi pretreatment of caco-2 cells with either 1,2-l-fucosidase or 1,3/4-l-fucosidase reduced binding of BNeV VLPs to MDBK cells. reduction was much enhanced by pretreatment of the Caco-2 cells with the 1,2-l-fucosidase and 1,3/4-l-fucosidase mixture. the scale bars correspond to 50 m. BNeV attachment to CHO cells with expression of H type 2. CHO cells do not express any HBGA on the cell surface due to lack of 1,2-fucosyltransferase activity and of either the A or B histo-blood group enzymes. parental and transfectant CHO cells stably expressing target HBGA were applied with AF594-labeld BNeV VLPs (10 g/ml) and then examined by confocal microscopy. all experiments were performed three independent times, and each panel shows one representative set of results. removal of 2,3- and 2,6-linked SAs using NA from V. cholerae failed to inhibit BNeV VLP binding to gut epithelium. we previously demonstrated that bovine duodenal sections had two ABO blood types, H+/A/B/Ley+/-Gal+ and H+/A+/B/Ley+/-Gal+. these results are consistent with the above-described findings. pretreatment of duodenal sections with -galactosidase or -N-acetylgalactosaminidase produced no inhibitory BNeV binding effects. however, pretreatment of these duodenal sections with 1,2-l-fucosidase partially inhibited the binding of BNeV VLPs to the duodenal epithelium. caliciviruses must attach to cell surface attachment factor(s) and/or receptor(s) to initiate viral entry and replication (1, 2). DISCUSSION Viruses must attach to cell surface attachment factor(s) to initiate viral entry and replication (1, 2). enzymatic removal of 1,2- and 1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes reduced BNeV binding to the corresponding synthetic HBGAs and saliva samples. BNeV VLPs recognize a wide spectrum of HBGAs via binding to their 1,2- and 1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes (2, 51, 52, 58, 61) pretreatment of bovine duodenal sections with -galactosidase or -N-acetylgalactosaminidase had no inhibitory effect on binding of BNeV VLPs to the bovine duodenum. findings also support the conclusion that similar to the human Lewis binding group, BNeV VLPs attach to 1,2-linked fucose epitopes in the bovine duodenum. BNeV does not use SLea and SLex for entry and infection in cattle. SLea and SLex are expressed at high concentrations in cancer cells. the reason for the binding is the presence of 1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes. lack of inhibition following NA treatment does not rule out the possibility that the internal SAs of gangliosides like GM1a are recognized. however, the lack of sensitivity with the 1 mM NaIO4 treatment strongly suggests that this is not the case. GII.4-HS66 induces diarrhea and intestinal pathology in piglets and calves. recent studies have shown that primate enteric caliciviruses share their HBGA attachment factors with HuNoVs. this suggests BNeVs have the potential to infect humans and/or other species. BNeV VLPs attach to HBGAs expressed in the bovine digestive tract through their 1,2- and 1,3/4-linked fucose residues. more in-depth epidemiological studies using human fecal and serum samples are required to determine the zoonotic potential of BNeVs. parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that do not express HBGAs (H/A/B) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 10 g/ml each of adenosine, 2-deoxy-adenosine, and thymidine (60) NaIO4 and NA, from Sigma-Aldrich, were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2). 1,2-l-Fucosidase from Corynebacterium (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Kyoto, Japan), 1,3/4-l-fucosidase from Streptomyces (TaKaRa Bio Inc.), -galactosidase from Coffea monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) of anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-blood group A type antigen (types 1 and 2 chains), anti-Lea antigen (type 1 chain) (Covance), anti-Lea antigen (type 1 chain) (Covance), anti-Leb antigen (type 1 chain) (Covance), anti-Lex antigen (type 2 chain) (Covance), anti-Ley antigen (type 2 chain BNeV VLPs were generated from a calf diarrhea fecal sample. amplicon was ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector. amplicon was then transformed to DH5 competent cells. pFastBac1 baculovirus donor plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac Escherichia coli. recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin II reagent. BNeV VLPs were expressed in baculovirus recombinant-transformed Sf9 insect cells at 27\u00b0C. VLPs purified from rMA415-infected Sf9 cell culture supernatants by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation were stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0) and examined with an electron microscope (JEM-2000 FXII; JEOL, USA) as described previously (49). two rabbits for each target viral protein were subcutaneously immunized three times with purified BNeV VLPs, P particles of EGTA, 1 mM NaF, 20 mM Na2P2O7, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate (Invitrogen) were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously. labeled viruses and VLPs were labeled with AF594 as described previously (7). the FCV F9 and CVB3 Nancy strains and BNeV VLPs were purified by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation. mock- or rMA415-infected Sf9 cells were harvested at 48 and 72 h postinfection and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h. the cells were then permeabilized by the addition of 0.2% Triton X-100 and washed with PBS containing 0.1% newborn calf serum. radioisotope labeling was carried out as described elsewhere (7, 26) each individual virus was inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 PFU/cell into confluent monolayers of cells and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. radioisotope-labeled VLPs were purified by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (7). the concentrations of the purified labeled BNeV VLPs, FCV strain, and CVB3 strains were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) eV VLPs, 10 g/ml of each GST-tagged-VP8* protein and GST-tagged P particles were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. each synthetic oligosaccharide-polyacrylamide conjugate (10 g/ml) was then added and further incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. the plates were washed thrice with PBS and incubated with 50 g/ml of BNeV VLPs. after washing, the plates were incubated with a hyperimmune serum against BNeV capsid protein. the signals were visualized by TMB followed by absorbance measurement at 450 nm using a plate reader. boiled saliva samples were diluted to 1:20 and then coated onto 96-well plates at 4\u00b0C overnight. boiled saliva samples were diluted to 1:20 and then coated onto 96-well plates at 4\u00b0C overnight. the bound target proteins were detected using a rabbit hyperimmune serum against BNeV capsid protein diluted to 1:1,000, followed by addition of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. the signal intensities after substrate addition were obtained using a TMB kit as described elsewhere. sections were either left untreated or treated with NaIO4 at 1 mM or 10 mM in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a 10-min incubation with 1% glycine in PBS to remove terminal or internal cell surface carbohydrate moieties. sections were incubated with 10 g/ml BNeV VLPs, diluted in PBS-BSA, and left at 4\u00b0 the protocol was approved by the Committee for Research Ethics Concerning Human Subjects, CNU (CNU IBR no. 1040198-130807-BR-002-02).
