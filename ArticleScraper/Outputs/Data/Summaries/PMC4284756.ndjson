{"summary": "the concentration of biological macromolecules inside cells is in the range of 80\u2013400 mg/mL [1,2,3] this corresponds to a volume occupancy of 5%\u201340% [4] and creates a crowded medium. such natural intracellular media, being filled with billions of protein molecules [10] and a myriad of DNA, RNA, and polysaccharide molecules are known as crowded rather than \u201cconcentrated\u201d environments. this review represents an analysis of available experimental data on what macromolecular crowding can do to a protein molecule. it shows that the major mechanism by which macromolecular crowding is expected to affect proteins is related to the minimization of excluded volume. this tendency for the excluded volume minimization in crowded environments is driven by the need of a system to maximize its entropy. the behavior of a protein in a crowded environment can be reliably explained in terms of hard non-specific steric interactions between the protein and crowding agents. the lack of significant interaction between the protein and crowding agent should be demonstrated and/or experiments should be analyzed in media with different crowding agents. macromolecular crowding is dependent on a ratio between the hydrodynamic dimensions (or occupied volumes) of the crowder and the test molecule. the most effective conditions are those where the volumes occupied by the crowder and the test molecule are of similar size. 4.5 33.2 Bovine serum albumin (BSA)e 66.3 33.9 80 mg/mL 18% PEG 20000 20 34.5 h/41.4 d Ficoll 70 e 70 40 37.5 mg/mL 17% PEG

order of magnitude as the diameter of protein. the size of protein-occupied pores in these gels is believed to have the same order of magnitude as the diameter of protein. the protein itself was suggested to dictate the pore size during the gelation process. roomman and Pheiffer analyzed the catalytic activity of the DNA ligases (EC 6.5.1.1) from rat liver nuclei and from Escherichia coli. these enzymes were completely inactive under conventional assay conditions but actively catalyzed the blunt-end ligation of DNA in the presence of high concentrations of several various macromolecules. similar activity of T4 DNA ligase on blunt-ended molecules was shown to noticeably increase in the presence of macromolecular crowding was shown to increase the efficiency of protein binding to DNA. this conclusion was based on the fact that the enzymatic activity of DNA polymerase I of Escherichia coli was dramatically increased by high concentrations of crowding agents under otherwise strongly inhibitory conditions. in these experiments, the presence of high concentrations of inert crowding agents promoted nick translation under otherwise strongly inhibitory conditions. re-formation of native triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from multiple fragments catalyzed by subtilisin (EC 3.4.21.62). but not all nicked proteins could be ligated under similar conditions. this approach might work only if the formation of native protein results in large compaction. the authors also showed that for a dextran with a given molecular weight, a decrease in the crowding agent concentration was accompanied by a vmax decay and a Km increase. the decrease in Km was ascribed to the crowding-enhanced effects of mixed inhibition by product [45]. a crowding-driven shift of the conformational equilibrium of eIF4A enhances the ATPase activity of this translation initiation factor. a crowding-driven shift of the conformational equilibrium of eIF4A from an inactive open state towards the closed active conformation enhances the ATPase activity of this translation initiation factor. concentration of added crowding agent (dextran 40) up to 395 mg/mL did not affect binding of a non-natural substrate ester, p-nitrophenyl acetate to trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) it is important to emphasize that the enzymatic activities of some proteins are not affected by macromolecular crowding. the oligomeric protein of interest is formed by the addition of the bystander molecules. the system will change to minimize the overall crowding by enhancing the association of molecules of interest, thereby reducing the excluded volume [15]. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P DH) catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to gluconolactone-6-phosphate, with NADP+ simultaneously accepting hydrogen to form NADPH. kcat and KM of hexokinase (a homodimeric enzyme, EC 2.7.1.1) were noticeably decreased (30%) in the presence of high BSA concentrations. pyruvate catalyzed by l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), kcat and KM were reduced by large sizes of dextran, suggesting the existence of mixed activation-diffusion control in an enzymatic reaction due to the effect of crowding. crowding plays an intricate role in the regulation of the folding-promoting activity of GroEL\u2013GroES chaperone machinery [63]. macromolecular crowding has a multidirectional effect on the functional activity of this important hexameric chaperone. this protein is a two-module NRPS that includes 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB)\u2013AMP ligase (EntE), aryl-carrier protein (ArCP) and a four-domain protein (EntF). macromolecular crowding agents induced structural changes in the enterobactin NRPS, EntB, and EntE [66]. the catalytic activity of the 3C-like peptidase of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) was significantly enhanced in the presence of macromolecular crowding agents. pixD from thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (TePixD, Tll0078) is a 17 kDa protein that consists of the BLUF (sensors of blue light using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domain and short helices. the pentamer-decamer equilibrium, which is crucial for the photoactivity of this protein, was the ability of small molecular substrates to be involved in weak attractive interactions with crowders is dependent on the chemical nature of both substrates and crowding agents. the ability of small molecular substrates to be involved in weak attractive interactions is dependent on the chemical nature of both substrates and crowding agents. IDPs and hybrid proteins possessing ordered domains and functional IDPRs are very common in any given proteome. the functional repertoire of these proteins and functional advantages of being disordered are well-known [74,75,76,78,81,82,86,87,88,92,98,100,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118] p27ID corresponds to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition domain of the cell-cycle inhibitor human p27Kip1 (residues 22\u201397) and is active as a cyclin A-Cdk2 inhibitor [122] both protein domains are intrinsically disordered as judged by circular dichroism (CD) spectra. molecular crowding effects are not necessarily sufficient to induce ordered structure in IDPs [120] free FlgM was mostly unstructured in the dilute solutions. its C-terminal half formed a transient helix in the unbound form. it became extensively folded in the presence of high concentrations of crowding agents, such as Ficoll 70 and PEG 6000. a similar study on the effect of high concentrations of BPTI and equine metmyoglobin on the conformational ensemble of a uniformly labeled IDP revealed that the radius of gyration of this IDP was remarkably insensitive to the presence of crowders, decreasing by a mere 2 in the presence of the highest crowder concentrations [132]. three of the four disordered sequences (ProT-C, ProT-N, and ACTR) were shown to possess a clear overall tendency to collapse in the presence of crowding agents. for the case of IN, only very small compaction was found in the crowded milieu. the crowded environment exhibited differential effects on the conformational propensity of distinct regions of an IDP. foldable IDPs remain mostly unstructured at the crowded conditions. some of these non-foldable by crowding IDPs may require another protein to provide a framework for structure formation. in vitro and in silico methods, Homouz et al. analyzed the effect of macromolecular crowding on structural changes and shape of an aspherical protein VlsE from Borrelia burgdorferi. crowding induces the transition from the football-like shape to a more compact bean-like shape combined with the noticeable increase in helical structure. a temperature increase resulted in the appearance of a spherical species which was formed by calmodulin (CaM), a molecule that contains four EF hands, is converted into more compact structures in the presence of crowding agents. crowding was able to stabilize several different compact conformations of CaM, suggesting that structure of this proteins is characterized by the inherent plasticity [140]. macromolecular crowing can affect the protein folding process, influence protein conformational equilibrium and thereby modulate the conformational behavior and stability of a protein. the presence of a crowding agent might significantly affect the protein folding process by favoring a more compact (folded) state over the more extended (unfolded) form. these folding\u2013promoting effects are expected to increase exponentially with the increase in the concentration of the crowding agent. a smaller dextran, dextran 40, were significantly greater (10\u201320 \u00b0C) the authors suggested that protein size, stability, conformational malleability and folding routes are key factors that modulate the net effect of macromolecular crowding on proteins. crowding induces structural changes in a protein-dependent manner. far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the effects of macromolecular crowding are dependent on the peculiarities of a given protein-crowder system. the analysis revealed that crowding agent Ficoll 70 affected the unfolding behavior of an oligomeric protein, human cpn10. the authors investigated the influence of Ficoll 70 on thermal and chemical stability of this protein and on its heptamer-monomer dissociation constant. the heptameric structure of cpn10 was noticeably stabilized in the presence of high Ficoll 70 concentrations (300 mg/mL), where the heptamer-monomer equilibrium constant was shifted in the direction of the heptamer. this resulted in significant increase in thermal and thermodynamic stabil addition of 10, 20 and 30 wt % of dextran increased unfolding pressure from 4.76 to 5.34, 5.97 and 7.05 kbar respectively. FTIR, small-angle X-ray scattering, and calorimetric measurements have been applied to look at the effect of macromolecular crowding by Ficoll on the temperature- and pressure-dependent stability diagram and folding reaction. reduced and carboxyamidated RNase T1 (TCAM) is substantially unfolded and is not catalytically active in aqueous media. however, the addition of macromolecular crowding agents (400 mg/mL dextran 70) resulted in the appearance of the catalytically active protein. uricans apoflavodoxin were enhanced by Ficoll 70 in a crowding agent concentration-dependent manner [161]. the presence of macromolecular crowding agents was shown to lead to the increased amount of secondary structure in the folded states of two structurally-different proteins, -helical VlsE and / flavodoxin. kinetic study of unfolding-refolding reaction of a redesigned apocytochrome b562 revealed that folding rate of the protein in mild crowded environments was significantly accelerated. folding of reduced hen lysozyme was not affected by crowding with Ficoll 70 or dextran 70. refolding of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and protein disulfide isomerase was almost completely abolished due to this important conclusion was based on the observation that the refolding in the absence and presence of Ficoll was accompanied by accumulation of very similar folding intermediates [167]. this important finding was the fact that the fast folding phase was accelerated, whereas the slow phase was substantially delayed in the presence of high concentrations of macromolecules [167]. it is expected that macromolecular crowding might affect protein folding by influencing the hydrodynamic volume of the unfolded state. i VlsE [12], urea-unfolded reduced lysozyme [167], chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) (t1/2 = 12 ms) and slower (t1/2 = 350 ms) folding mutants. effect of high concentrations of dextran 70 (200 g/L) and Ficoll 70 (200 g/L) on folding-unfolding kinetics of three small folding motifs was not affected by crowd a detailed analysis of refolding process of dihydrofolate reductase, enolase, and green fluorescent protein revealed that although these proteins can fold spontaneously in dilute solutions, they lose this ability in a crowded environment. these proteins were trapped in a form of soluble, protease-sensitive non-native species (presumably in a form of soluble oligomers) but regained the ability to fold in the presence of the complete GroEL/G analysis of effect of increasing levels of crowding agents dextran and Ficoll 70 on stability (thermal and chemical perturbations) and folding kinetics (chemical perturbation) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa apoazurin revealed that addition of increasing amounts of crowding agents resulted in the noticeable stabilization of this protein. the cooperativity of these equilibrium transitions was almost unperturbed by crowding agents. a set of 13 mutants of a Desulfovibrio desulfuricans apoflavodoxin was used to analyze with residue-specific resolution the effect of crowded conditions in vitro on the time-resolved folding reaction of this small parallel / protein [180] in dilute solutions, refolding of apoflavodoxin involves an initial misfolded species that rearrange in a rate-limiting process. mutants showed an initial burst stage followed by a slower single-exponential folding step in dilute and crowded solutions. however, in the presence of Ficoll 70, the amplitude of this initial burst stage was dramatically reduced for most variants, suggesting that macromolecular crowding reduces topological frustrations in the early stages of apoflavodoxin folding. mutant form of protein L (ProtL) is a 7 kDa globular protein from the mesophile Streptococcus magnus. just 0.1% of its molecules populate the denatured state in dilute buffer at room temperature. 84% of the mutant populate the denatured state under the same conditions. this mutation-induced destabilization was attributed to the variant\u2019s decreased hydrophobic surface area, not the increase in negative charge. mbrane domain (OmpA171) and full-length OmpA had similar folding rates. in the presence of 20% Ficoll 70, full-length OmpA refolded much slower than. OmpA171 folding efficiency was significantly decreased in comparison with that of. OmpA. coli 60S ribosomal particles from the isolated 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits increase a further interaction between 70S particles and form the 100S dimer [185] bacterial cell division protein FtsZ to dimers [189], long rod-like linear aggregates [190] and monomer-thick ribbons [191], formation of secretory granules, which are the storage place for many protein hormones. cytochrome c peroxidase at the expense of nonspecific transient encounter complexes did not affect the formation of two high-affinity heterocomplexes. formation of filaments from metabolic enzymes was proposed to serve as a general protective mechanism that allows cell to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation. gp44/62 complex, processive holoenzyme-like DNA synthesis can be obtained without hydrolysis of ATP by simply adding extremely high concentrations of gp45 to the T4 DNA polymerase (gp43) gp43-gp45 heterodimer can be eliminated by macromolecular crowding. gp45 belongs to the family of \u201csliding clamp\u201d proteins also serves as transcriptional activator of phage T4 late genes [212, macromolecular crowding was proposed to be responsible for the enhanced tendency of soluble macromolecules to associate with membrane proteins. this crowding-controlled regulation of cellular volumes is based on the balance between the rates of phosphatase-catalyzed activation and kinase-catalyzed inactivation of the transporter. nuclei swelled in the presence of small solutes and shrank reversibly in the presence of larger solutes macromolecular crowding differently affected the polymerization of the HIV-1 capsid protein CA and inhibition of this process by short peptides. inhibition of this process by a small C-terminal domain (CTD) of protein CA was accelerated in the presence of high concentrations of Ficoll 70 and dextran 10 [193], but inhibition process was noticeably diminished in media containing high concentrations of Ficoll 70 in a crowder concentration-dependent manner. macromolecular crowding with dextran 70 dramatically accelerated polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin S. inhibition of this polymerization by non-deoxyhemoglobin S admixtures was prominent in crowded and non-crowded conditions. cellular bodies are considered as liquid-droplet phases of the nucleoplasm/cytoplasm [232,236,241,242,243,244] formed via the intracellular phase transitions. these phase transitions in aqueous media originate from the different effects of macromolecules on the structure and solvent properties of water. these phase transitions in aqueous media originate from the different effects of macromolecules on the structure and solvent properties of water. the presence of 20 wt % of a high molecular weight crowding agent greatly reduces the concentrations needed to produce phase separation [251]. this simple crowding-based mechanism of enhanced protein\u2013DNA interaction provides a reasonable explanation for the fact that cellular DNA in bacteria is maintained in a condensed state. macromolecular crowding was proposed to represent one of the major factors defining the compaction of chromosomes. crowding-directed organization of the extracellular matrix was parallel by increased alignment of the intracellular actin cytoskeleton [260]. fibrillation process involves slow nucleation coupled to self-association steps. the fibrillation process in vitro involves slow nucleation coupled to self-association steps. -synuclein is a small (14 kDa) highly abundant presynaptic protein. apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) that slowly forms amyloid fibrils in lipid-free solutions was noticeably accelerated by crowding with dextran 10. this crowding agent did not affect the secondary structure of the protein, morphology of resulting fibrils, or the ability of apoC-II amyloid to bind fluorescent probes thioflavin T and Congo Red. macromolecular crowding could dramatically enhance the competition between protein folding and aggregation, favoring the latter when folding is relatively slow. macromolecular crowding can modulate the aggregate heterogeneities, making the prediction of the net effect of macromolecular crowding on protein aggregation and fibrillation difficult task. KKLIMY derived from the C-terminal region (amino acids 248\u2013286) of PAP. this analysis revealed that the addition of macromolecular crowding agents affected the morphology of the amyloid fibrils formed by this peptide leading to the formation of shorter amyloid aggregates. to support this view, the effect of macromolecular crowding on fibrillation of four proteins, bovine S-carboxymethyl-lactalbumin (a disordere human prion protein can be converted from a soluble monomeric, helical conformation into -sheet cytotoxic oligomers resistant to proteinase K digestion. analysis of self-association of the type-2 diabetes mellitus related human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) in various crowded environments revealed the existence of two competing processes, where globular off-pathway species were stabilized and type-dependent. ficoll 70 and Dextran 70 were able to dramatically decrease the extent of BCA aggregate formation. this peculiar behavior was explained in terms of the decrease in the population of aggregation-prone intermediates as a consequence of increased native state stability. crowders that efficiently act on some proteins would be less efficient on some other proteins, suggesting that there is a clear deviation from the simple excluded volume model. a concentration-dependent decrease in activity was observed in the presence of dextrans and PEGs. the analysis of the effects of high concentrations of high molecular weight polymers and their low molecular weight derivatives revealed that only concentrated solutions of large polymers were able not only increase the catalytic efficiency of the T4 polynucleotide kinase [311,312], but also prevented its inactivation. crowding agents ficoll 70, dextran 70, PEG 2000, and PEG 20,000 have different effects on the structural stability of human -lactalbumin (apo-HLA) it is known that the thermal-induced molten globule state can be induced in Ca2+-depleted HLA (apo-HLA) at pH 7.0 and 55 \u00b0C. the analysis of thermal denaturation suggested that all the crowders at the concentration of 200 g/L had a destabilizing effect on Mb as compared to the thermal unfolding of this protein in dilute solutions. dextran 40 and dextran 70 were destabilizing at 0\u20132 M urea but did not have such additional destabilizing effects when thermal denaturation was monitored in the presence of 3\u20135 M urea [316]. the effects of compact, flexible polysaccharides (dextrans) and more rigid cellulose derivatives (hydroxypropyl celluloses or HPCs) were studied on the kinetics and mechanism of aggregation of several proteins with variable degrees of intrinsic disorder and oligomeric state. in this study, neutrophilic polysaccharides were selected to minimize the specific protein-polymer interactions. a recent analysis of the effect of various crowding agents on interaction between the Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) subunit GluN2B revealed that the formation of the CaMKII-GluN2B complex was reduced by lysozyme but enhanced by BSA. this interaction was reduced by lysozyme but enhanced by BSA. mixed media were more favorable for MM-CK refolding and induced noticeably less aggregation of this protein than the individual crowding agents by themselves. similar data were also reported for the refolding and aggregation of the GdmHCL-unfolded recombinant human brain-type creatine kinase (rHBCK) in the presence dextran 70, PEG 2000, and CT DNA. crowding on biological macromolecules may be examined experimentally by using concentrated solutions of a model \u201ccrowding agent\u201d such as poly(ethylene glycol), dextran, Ficoll, or inert proteins [14,20]. the major reason for using concentrated solutions of such macromolecules is to mimic macromolecular crowding characterized by a high excluded volume; i.e., the volume occupied by the crowder molecules that is unavailable to other biological macromolecules.

volume occupied by macromolecules in living cell [16,17] the size of protein-occupied pores in these gels is believed to have the same order of magnitude as the diameter of protein. the size of protein-occupied pores in these gels is believed to have the same order of magnitude as the diameter of protein. a few cases below provide support to the notion that macromolecular crowding can affect an enzymatic reaction when catalysis is accompanied by changes in the size or shape of an enzyme. however, when catalysis is accompanied by changes in the size or shape of an enzyme, then macromolecular crowding can affect a reaction. macromolecular crowding was shown to increase the efficiency of protein binding to DNA. enzymatic activity of DNA polymerase I of Escherichia coli was dramatically increased by high concentrations of crowding agents under otherwise strongly inhibity conditions. macromolecular crowding on reversed proteolysis revealed that crowded media are able to facilitate proteosynthesis of a polypeptide product with an interacting folding motif such as coiled coil. but not all nicked proteins could be ligated under similar conditions, suggesting that this approach might work only if the formation of the native protein results in large compaction. results were interpreted in terms of crowding-modulated ordering of a non-optimal substrate-binding site and restricted internal dynamics of the protein. dextran with a given molecular weight, a decrease in the crowding agent concentration was accompanied by a vmax decay and a Km increase. a crowding-driven shift of the conformational equilibrium of eIF4A enhances the ATPase activity of this translation initiation factor. a crowding-driven shift of the conformational equilibrium of eIF4A from an inactive open state towards the closed active conformation enhances the ATPase activity of this translation initiation factor. crowded environment was able to significantly alter mobile regions of these proteins. crowding-enabled biphosphorylation represents a mechanistic foundation of the \"distributive phosphorylation model\" crowding represents a mechanism for modulating the catalytic activities of enzymes. crowding agent (dextran 40) up to 395 mg/mL did not affect binding of a non-natural substrate ester. the mechanisms of the function-modulating effects of macromolecular crowding on oligomeric proteins are different from those affecting monomeric enzymes. excluded volume is expected to affect an enzymatic activity of a monomeric protein if catalysis is accompanied by changes in the size, shape, or shape of a target enzyme. crowding with high concentrations of PEG 6000 or PEG 35,000 stabilized the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) this catalyzes the uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of glucose. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P DH) is a dimeric enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate kcat and KM of hexokinase (a homodimeric enzyme, EC 2.7.1.1) decreased (30%) in presence of high BSA concentrations due to conformational change during catalysis and/or diffusion of product from enzyme\u2013substrate complex. kcat and KM were reduced by high concentrations and large sizes of dextran, suggesting the existence of mixed activation-diffusion control in an enzymatic reaction due to the effect of crowding folding of a target protein occurs in a sequestrated environment of the central GroEL cavity. the displacement of unfolded polypeptide into the \u201cfolding\u201d chamber requires GroES binding, whereas the resulting native protein leaves GroEL upon GroES release. this loss of substrate from GroEL was shown to be prevented when the folding reaction was carried out in the presence of macromolecular crowding agents. the premature release of linear precursors/side products is suppressed to a negligible level in the crowded environment containing high concentrations of the inert polymers. the subsequent study showed that this peculiar suppression of the liner side product production is suppressed not due to the stabilization of the quaternary structure of this proteinaceous machine. macromolecular crowding was also detected in the other two components of the enterobactin synthesis, EntF [66] cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (TePixD, Tll0078) is a 17 kDa protein that consists of the BLUF (sensors of blue light using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domain and short helices. the pentamer-decamer equilibrium, which is crucial for the photoactivity of this protein, was shifted toward the more active de aumiller et al. showed that the HRP activity in similarly crowded conditions was different when TMB was used as a substrate as compared to o-phenylenediamine (OPD), which is more hydrophilic. the reaction rates of HRP with TMB were much more sensitive to the presence of crowding agents than OPD, suggesting that these small-molecule substrates are able differently interact with PEG and dextran, which were used as crowding agents. macromolecular crowding can efficiently modulate several reactions catalyzed by T4 RNA ligase, such as cyclization of small oligoriboadenylates, the novel formation of large linear products from the oligoriboadenylates, the formation of hybrid molecules by the end-to-end ligation of p(dT)10 to single-stranded oligobonucleotides, and the activation of p(d macromolecular crowding was shown to extend the range of conditions under which DNA polymerase was functional due to the increased binding between the polymerase and its DNA template-primer. the presence of high concentrations of inert crowding agents promoted nick translation under otherwise strongly inhibitory conditions, such as a range of pH values or temperatures. catalytic parameters of the monomeric multicopper oxidase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fet3p, were remarkably modulated by macromolecular crowding in vitro. different concentrations of macromolecular crowding agent were shown to have rather different effects, with low concentrations being able to increase both KM (weaker substrate binding) and kcat (improved catalytic efficiency) a dextran with a given molecular weight, a decrease in the crowding agent concentration was accompanied by a vmax decay and a decrease in vmax. the decrease in vmax was ascribed to the crowding-enhanced effects of mixed inhibition by product [45] crowding-enabled biphosphorylation represents a mechanistic foundation of the \u201cdistributive phosphorylation model\u201d describing the ability of the ERK MAP kinase pathway to respond to increasing levels of progesterone in an all-or-none or \u201cswitch-like\u201d manner. crowding-enabled biphosphorylation represents a mechanism for modulating the catalytic activities of enzymes. high concentrations of Ficoll 70 did not perturb the Michaelis constant, Km, and the catalytic turnover number, kcat, of three glycolytic enzymes. similar effects of crowding agents on the kinetic parameter, Km. oligomeric proteins are different from those affecting monomeric enzymes. the protein of interest is smaller than twice the excluded volume of each monomer. the system will change to minimize the overall crowding by enhancing the association of molecules of interest, thereby reducing the excluded volume. the effect of crowding in crowded environments will obviously affect function of a protein of interest. dimeric enzyme (EC 1.1.1.49) catalyzes the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to gluconolactone-6-phosphate. monomeric and tetrameric forms of this protein are inactive. kcat and KM of hexokinase (a homodimeric enzyme, EC 2.7.1.1) were noticeably decreased (30%) in the presence of high BSA concentrations due to the conformational change during crowding plays an intricate role in the regulation of the folding-promoting activity of GroEL\u2013GroES chaperone machinery. crowding agents with greater molecular weight possessing high rate reducing capacities [61]. crowding plays an intricate role in the regulation of the folding-promoting activity in the nucleus. the association equilibrium, biochemical properties, stability, and chaperone activity of the disaggregase ClpB have been recently analyzed. this analysis revealed that macromolecular crowding has a multidirectional effect on the functional activity of this important hexameric chaperone. the crowded environment shifted the conformational equilibrium of the protein monomer toward a more compact state. macromolecular crowding was able to dramatically affect the secondary structure of the major component of the enterobactin NRPS. this is directly associated with the formation of all the side products in the enterobactin synthesis, EntF [66], since the circular dichroism (CD) signal intensity at 210 nm increased significantly with the crowdedness of the solution. the pentamer-decamer equilibrium was shifted toward the more active decamers in the presence of high concentrations of Ficoll 70 [72] the majority of research on the effect of macromolecular crowding on small-molecule substrates is focused on the protein part. however, small-molecule substrates can also be affected by macromolecular crowding, especially if these substrates are chemically different. intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) enzymatic reactions can decrease substrate chemical activity and consequently reduce the enzymatic activity of a protein of interest. IDPs and hybrid proteins are included to the redefined protein structure-function paradigm [74,75,76,78,81,82,86,87,88,92,97,98,100,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118] the effect of high concentrations of crowders on structural properties of several IDPs was analyzed. cyclin A-Cdk2 inhibitor is active as a cyclin A-Cdk2 inhibitor. both proteins are intrinsically disordered as judged by circular dichroism (CD) spectra characteristic of the unfolded polypeptide chains, lack of 1H chemical-shift dispersion and negative 1H-15N nuclear Overhauser effects. molecular crowding effects are not necessarily sufficient to induce ordered structure in IDPs [120] a destabilized mutant of the immunoglobin G binding domain of protein L has little structure in aqueous solution. it became extensively folded in the presence of high concentrations of crowding agents, such as ficoll 70 and PEG 6000. crowding effects of a crowding agent on folding equilibrium constant for unfolded protein L were similar to the crowding effects found on the folded wild type protein. a similar study on the effect of high concentrations of BPTI and equine metmyoglobin on the conformational ensemble of a uniformly labeled IDP. the N protein in samples with adjusted D2O concentration to mask contribution of crowding proteins to the scattering profiles revealed that the radius of gyration of this IDP was remarkably insensitive to the presence of crowders, decreasing by a mere 2 in the presence of the highest crowder concentrations. three of the four disordered sequences (ProT-C, ProT-N, and ACTR) were shown to possess a clear overall tendency to collapse in the presence of crowding agents. for the case of IN, only very small compaction was found in the crowded milieu. crowded environment exhibited differential effects on conformational propensity of distinct regions of an IDP. foldable and non-foldable IDPs can gain structure in crowded environment. some of these non-foldable by crowding IDPs may require another protein (or DNA, or RNA, or some other natural binding partners) to provide framework for structure formation. VlsE possesses an elongated football shape with a helical core surrounded by floppy loops at each end [137] and unfolds in a two-state manner both kinetically and in equilibrium [138,139]. the folding kinetics of this football-shaped protein is accelerated in the presence of high concentrations of Ficoll 70 [12]. a molecule that contains four EF hands is converted into more compact structures in the presence of crowding agents. crowding was able to stabilize several different compact conformations of CaM, suggesting that structure of this proteins is characterized by the inherent plasticity. the same authors used combined methods of computer simulation and experiments to show that the conformation, helicity and the EF hand orientation of CaM are affected. the presence of a crowding agent may significantly affect the protein folding process by favoring a more compact (folded) state over the more extended (unfolded) form. these folding\u2013promoting effects are expected to increase exponentially with the increase in the concentration of the crowding agent. crowding induces structural changes in a protein-dependent manner. thermal stability of folded apoflavodoxin increased by about 3 \u00b0C. addition of crowding agent to the solution of GdmHCl-unfolded apoflavodoxin resulted in a decrease in protein volume of about 29%. far-UV CD revealed that the addition of Ficoll 70 to RNase A and -LA at pH 7.0 and 4.0 resulted in an increase in the residual structure. no such increase in the residual structure was detected for the temperature-unfolded state of lysozyme [147]. the structural analyses using far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the effects of macromolecular crowding are dependent on the peculiarities of a given protein-crowder cpn10 was noticeably stabilized in the presence of high Ficoll 70 concentrations (300 mg/mL) the heptamer\u2013monomer equilibrium constant was shifted in the direction of the heptamer resulting in significant increase in thermal and thermodynamic stabilization of the heptameric structure. in dilute solutions, recombinant human brain-type creatine kinase (rHBCK) is known to be efficiently inactivated by 0.5 M calorimetric measurements have been applied to look at the effect of macromolecular crowding by Ficoll on the temperature- and pressure-dependent stability diagram and folding reaction of a model protein Staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) in 30 wt % Ficoll solutions, both temperature- and pressure-induced equilibrium unfolding processes were significantly shifted to higher temperatures and pressures [152]. crowding agents (400 mg/mL dextran 70) accounted for approximately 16% of the total available TCAM in solution. authors concluded macromolecular crowding agents are only modestly effective in promoting folding of this IDP [158] the presence of macromolecular crowding agents was shown to lead to the increased amount of secondary structure in the folded states of two structurally-different proteins. the authors showed that the structural content of flavodoxin and / flavodoxin was enhanced by 33% and 70%, respectively, in 400 mg/mL Ficoll 70 (pH 7, 20 \u00b0C) kinetic study of the unfolding-refolding reaction of a redesigned apocytochrome b562 revealed that folding rate of the protein in mild crowded environments was significantly accelerated. folding of reduced hen lysozyme was not affected by crowding with Ficoll 70 or dextran 70. refolding of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and protein disulfide isomerase was almost completely abolished due folding phase was accelerated, whereas slow phase was substantially delayed in the presence of high concentrations of macromolecules. findings suggest that there was a preferential stabilization of compact states over more unfolded states. it is expected that macromolecular crowding might affect protein folding by influencing the hydrodynamic volume of the unfolded state. the effects of high concentrations of dextran 70 (200 g/L) and Ficoll 70 (200 g/L) on the thermal stability and folding-unfolding kinetics of three small folding motifs. crowding significantly slowed down the folding rate of the shortest -hairpin peptide. a detailed analysis of refolding process of dihydrofolate reductase, enolase, and green fluorescent protein revealed that although these proteins can fold spontaneously in dilute solutions, they lose this ability in a crowded environment. these proteins were trapped in a form of soluble, protease-sensitive non-native species (presumably in a form of soluble oligomers) but regained the ability to fold in the presence of the complete GroEL/G folding kinetics (chemical perturbation) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa apoazurin revealed that addition of the increasing amounts of crowding agents resulted in the noticeable stabilization of this protein. the cooperativity of these equilibrium transitions was almost unperturbed by crowding agents. comparison of the effects of increasing amounts of Dextran 20 on the apoazurin refolding/unfolding rate constants at six different GdmHC a set of 13 mutants of a Desulfovibrio desulfuricans apoflavodoxin was used to analyze with residue-specific resolution the effect of crowded conditions in vitro on the time-resolved folding reaction of this small parallel / protein. refolding of apoflavodoxin involves an initial misfolded species that rearrange in a rate-limiting process to the native structure [181]. macromolecular crowding reduces topological frustrations in early stages of apoflavodoxin folding and thereby reduces misfolding of this protein. a mutant form of protein L (ProtL), a 7 kDa globular protein from the mesophile Streptococcus magnus, was expressed in E. coli. a work of Ye et al. represents a standalone study on the effect of macromolecular crowding on refolding and membrane insertion of outer membrane proteins. the authors analyzed the effect of the macromolecular crowding condition on refolding and membrane insertion of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) the presence of Ficoll 70 significantly slowed down the rates of refolding and membrane insertion of OmpA while had little effect on refolding and membrane insertion the periplasmic domain plays a dual role in refolding-insertion process of OmpA. these data indicated that the periplasmic domain plays a dual role in refolding-insertion process of OmpA, slowing down the rates, while improving the efficiency, of OmpA folding and membrane insertion under the crowding condition. the addition of crowding agent to the solution of GdmHCl-unfolded apoflavodoxin resulted in a decrease in protein volume of about 29%. the addition of crowding agent to the solution of GdmHCl-unfolded apoflavodoxin resulted in a decrease in protein volume of 29%. structural analyses using far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the effects of macromolecular crowding are dependent on the peculiarities of a given protein-crowder system. crowding agent Ficoll 70 affected the unfolding behavior of an oligomeric protein, human cpn10 [149] the direction of the heptamer resulting in significant increase in thermal and thermodynamic stabilization of the heptameric structure, decrease in its dissociation, and the related decrease in the kinetic unfolding rates. in dilute solutions, recombinant human brain-type creatine kinase (rHBCK) is known to be efficiently inactivated by 0.5 M GdmHCl at 25 \u00b0C. however, the inactivation process was dramatically slowed down in 30 wt % Ficoll solutions, both temperature- and pressure-induced equilibrium unfolding processes were significantly shifted to higher temperatures and pressures. the refolding rate of SNase was shown to be markedly decreased in the presence of Ficoll [152]. 6% of the total available TCAM in solution, the authors concluded that macromolecular crowding agents are only modestly effective in promoting folding of this IDP [158]. the addition of 35% PEG 20,000 or Ficoll 70 to the solution of the unfolded ribonuclease A (RNase A) at pH 3.0 resulted in the formation of a native compact conformation [29]. the authors showed that the structural content of flavodoxin and / flavodoxin was enhanced by 33% and 70%, respectively, in 400 mg/mL Ficoll 70 (pH 7, 20 \u00b0C) the addition of crowding agent resulted in up to a 100-fold increase in the CI2 stability. refolding of reduced hen lysozyme was not affected by crowding with Ficoll 70 or dextran 70. refolding of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and protein disulfide isomerase was hampered by macromolecular crowding due to the formation of soluble aggregates. macromolecular crowding may affect protein folding by influencing the hydrodynamic volume of the unfolded state of a protein. it is expected that macromolecular crowding might affect protein folding by influencing the hydrodynamic volume of the unfolded state. crowding-induced changes in efficiency of the F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer for the urea-unfolded small ribosomal protein S16 labeled with boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dextran 70 (200 g/L) and ficoll 70 (200 g/L) were analyzed to understand how macromolecular crowding can affect folding capability of short independently foldable structural motifs. crowding significantly slowed down the folding rate of the shortest -hairpin peptide [173]. these proteins were trapped in a form of soluble protease-sensitive non-native species. but regained the ability to fold in the presence of the complete GroEL/GroES chaperonin system. this chaperonin-mediated folding was triggered by ATP hydrolysis. addition of increasing amounts of crowding agents resulted in stabilization of apoazurin refolding/unfolding rate constants. kinetic analysis of effect of Ficoll 70 on folding-unfolding behavior of PGK showed that the increase in the crowding agent induces non-linear changes in the folding relaxation rate. a set of 13 mutants of a Desulfovibrio desulfuricans apoflavodoxin was used to analyze with residue-specific resolution the effect of crowded conditions in vitro on the time-resolved folding reaction of this small parallel / protein. refolding of apoflavodoxin involves an initial misfolded species that rearrange in a rate-limiting process to the native structure [181] macromolecular crowding reduces topological frustrations in early stages of apoflavodoxin folding and thereby reduces misfolding of this protein. a mutant form of protein L (ProtL), a 7 kDa globular protein from the mesophile Streptococcus magnus with seven lysine residues replaced by glutamic acids was expressed in coli. a work of Ye et al. represents a standalone study on the effect of macromolecular crowding on refolding and membrane insertion of outer membrane proteins. the authors analyzed the effect of the macromolecular crowding condition on refolding and membrane insertion of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) the associating macromolecules of interest and the crowder molecules exclude each other from their neighborhoods. the excluded volume around each dimer of the macromolecule of interest is smaller than twice the excluded volume of each monomer. the system will change to minimize the overall crowding by enhancing the association of molecules of interest, thereby reducing the excluded volume [15]. high concentrations of PEG 600, PEG 1000, PEG 8000, and dextran 6 did not affect the formation of two high-affinity heterocomplexes. high concentrations of PEG 600, PEG 1000, PEG 8000, and dextran 6 did not affect the formation of two high-affinity heterocomplexes. the formation of filaments from metabolic enzymes was proposed to serve as a general protective mechanism that allows cell to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation. the assembly of the five-protein core of the DNA replication complex of bacteriophage T4 that includes the DNA polymerase (gp43), the T4-coded single-stranded binding protein (gp32), and three proteins known collectively as the polymerase accessory proteins, gp the requirement for the gp44/62 complex can be eliminated by macromolecular crowding [210]. macromolecular crowding can be used to identify weak interactions within the DNA replication complex. gp45 belongs to the family of \"sliding clamp\" proteins also serves as transcriptional activator of phage T4 late genes [212,213,214] macromolecular crowding was proposed to be responsible for the enhanced tendency of soluble macromolecules to associate with membrane proteins. this crowding-controlled regulation of cellular volumes is based on the balance between the rates of phosphatase-catalyzed activation and kinase-catalyzed inactivation of the transporter. the effects of dextrans, carbohydrates, and PEGs of different sizes on the volume of the macrophage nucleus were studied in molecules on the host cell HIV-1 capsid protein CA to capsid-like particles were accelerated in the presence of high concentrations of Ficoll 70 and dextran 10 [193]. inhibition of this process by a small C-terminal domain of protein CA was effectively inhibited by a variety of the macromolecular crowding agents, such as ficoll 70, dextran 40, or BSA [224]. non-deoxyhemoglobin S admixtures promoted pathogenic process associated with red cell sickling. inhibition of this polymerization by non-deoxyhemoglobin S admixtures was prominent in crowded and non-crowded conditions. the relative efficiency of this inhibition process was not affected much by crowding agents. phase transitions in aqueous media originate from the different effects of macromolecules on the structure and solvent properties of water. at low concentrations of macromolecules, the solution exists as a single phase, whereas at high concentrations, phase separation occurs [245]. for phase separation to occur, the concentration of neutral polymers should be greater than a few percent of each species [248,249]. macromolecular crowding was shown to enhance condensation of bacterial DNA by promoting specific interaction of DNA-binding proteins isolated from exponential and stationary phase cell extracts of E. coli with the DNA [255]. cellular DNA in bacteria is maintained in a condensed state, being localized into nucleoids, which are compact, characteristically shaped bodies enclosed by cytoplasm [256]. ecular assembly and alignment of extracellular matrix proteins deposited by cells was dramatically enhanced. dramatic change in adhesion, proliferation, and migration behavior of MSCs. a number of human diseases are associated with the specific self-association of proteins to amyloid fibrils. -synuclein, a small (14 kDa) presynaptic protein, is considered a critical step in Parkinson\u2019s disease. a number of environmental factors have been shown to induce partial folding of -synuclein and accelerate fibrillation. apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) that slowly forms amyloid fibrils in lipid-free solutions was noticeably accelerated by crowding with dextran 10 [20] the authors concluded that an increase in the fractional volume occupancy of aggregating protein caused by macromolecular crowding can nonspecifically accelerate the formation of amyloid fibrils by an amyloidogenic protein. aggregation of a misfolded protein differs morphologically from soluble oligomers to insoluble structure-less amorphous aggregates. macromolecular crowding may dramatically enhance the competition between protein folding and aggregation, favoring latter when folding is relatively slow. macromolecular crowding on fibrillation of four proteins, bovine S-carboxymethyl-lactalbumin (a disordered form of the protein with three out of four disulfide bridges being reduced) these proteins of interest were structurally different, varying from extended IDPs (-synuclein and core histones) to folded proteins with rigid tertiary and quaternary structures (monomeric and hexameric forms of insulin) crowding-stabilized globular off-pathway species were shown to be non-toxic in the hIAPP cytotoxicity assays on pancreatic -cells. the presence of crowding agents also accelerated amyloid fibril formation of human prion protein and its two pathogenic mutants. inequality of Crowding Agents It is recognized now that not all crowders are made equal. this inequality is very protein-specific (i.e., crowders that efficiently act on some proteins would be less efficient on some other proteins) the excluded volume was suggested as a mechanism defining the increase in the efficiency of the kinase-DNA binding [311]. a protein for which high concentrations of high molecular weight macromolecular crowding agents were able to dramatically increase the catalytic efficiency was Escherichia coli ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase (AspP), which catalyzes the hydrolytic breakdown of ADP-glucose linked to glycogen biosynthesis the thermal-induced molten globule state can be induced in Ca2+-depleted HLA (apo-HLA) at pH 7.0 and 55 \u00b0C. the acid molten globule of this protein is realized at pH 3.0 and 25.0 \u00b0C. high concentrations of dextran 70 and ficoll 70 dramatically enhanced the thermal stability of apo-HLA. tran 70 were destabilizing at 0\u20132 M urea but did not have such additional destabilizing effects when thermal denaturation was monitored in the presence of 3\u20135 M urea. the extent of BCA aggregation was noticeably lower in the presence of Dextran 70 relative to that in the presence of Ficoll 70. neutral, hydrophilic polysaccharides were selected to minimize specific protein-polymer interactions. the analysis revealed that in the presence of dextrans fibril formation from the proteins that are either present as stable oligomers (insulin, pH 7.5) or form oligomers in the process of aggregation (-lactalbumin) was inhibited. dextran 10, dextran 70 and PVP 40 resulted in more efficient formation of the CaMKII-GluN2B complex. addition of 100 mg/mL of non-specific rabbit IgG reduced CaMKII binding to GluN2B. mixed macromolecular crowding agents affect protein behavior differently than solution of the individual crowders. macromolecular crowding represents a very important factor that affects various aspects of protein life. it is almost impossible to find a single protein-related feature that would not be affected by the addition of high concentrations of macromolecules. despite its immense biological importance macromolecular crowding can be ignored."}
