ML3D is available in XMIPP [10], [87], [88] and is usually limited to intermediate resolution analysis because refinements with angular sampling steps finer than 10\u00b0 are difficult to perform in practice. ML-based methods simplify mathematical expressions by assuming independence of real-space pixels and Gaussian white noise in either real space or reciprocal space. ML3D and the FREALIGN approach assume independence of real-space pixels while the RELION approach assumes independence of reciprocal-space pixels. ML-based methods can be used with heterogeneous data in order to determine multiple co-existing conformational states. a set of particles could be isolated to obtain a single-state reconstruction at high resolution. the RELION approach resulted in near-atomic resolution of different structures. it was combined with the use of masks and a modification of experimental images to improve consistency of their comparison. experimental images are based on differences in a region of interest. it involves subtracting a residual signal (the signal outside the region of interest, but inside the complex) from the experimental images. this strategy produced results such as three distinct conformations of human gamma-secretase [94] and different local-region conformations of the yeast spliceosomal tri-snRNP [95]. all given 3D references are projected uniformly distributed over a 3D sphere. each particle image is compared with all obtained 2D projections. a 3D reconstruction is computed from each obtained class of images using the rotational and translational parameters determined via the alignment with the best-matching reference. incremental K-means-like approach was recently used for isolating rotated from unrotated 80S ribosome images. this combined procedure resulted in solving 11 states with conformational and compositional analysis. if the two references are not too similar, the second reference will attract the particles that do not fit well. multireference classification methods are based on the principle of estimating a global 3D variability from the variability of data subsets. they require a prior knowledge of 3 Euler angles and 2 in-plane shifts for each particle image. but they do not require that the number of different structures (classes) is known a priori. a 3D spherical mask placed in the region of highest 3D variance was projected in different directions to create 2D binary masks. images with higher average densities in the regions outlined by respective 2D masks were labeled as ligand-bound states while those with lower average densities were labeled as ligand-unbound states [75] ML3D computes 3D models by expectation\u2013maximization (E-M) recursive optimization. the discrete assignments of image orientation, translation, and class membership are replaced with probability-weighted integrations over all possible assignments. in practice, integrations are replaced with summations over a set of discrete projection directions, in-plane rotations, in-plane translations, and classes with some weight.

ML3D and the FREALIGN approach assume independence of real-space pixels while the RELION approach assumes independence of reciprocal-space pixels. ML-based methods can be used with heterogeneous data in order to determine multiple co-existing conformational states, but they can also be used with globally homogenous data. the RELION approach resulted in near-atomic resolution of different structures, from small complexes to large complexes. the approach was combined with the use of masks and a modification of experimental images to improve consistency of their comparison with model projections. the modification of experimental images improves consistency of comparison with model projections in the region of interest. it requires a preliminary determination of image orientation and translation parameters and a creation of two 3D masks, one for the region of interest and the other for the entire complex. several examples of results have been recently obtained. development of methods for their study is the first step towards full studies of dynamics of macromolecular complexes. the concept of studying entire macromolecular dynamics is based on the principle of allowing as many as possible different conformational states in the specimen. the most popular 3D methods are maximum-likelihood-based classification methods available in RELION [6], [90] and FREALIGN [12], [91] software packages. most popular 3D methods are maximum-likelihood-based classification methods available in RELION [6], [90] and FREALIGN [12], [91] software packages."}
