{"summary": "HCV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. it chronically infects approximately 170 million people worldwide. it is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. autophagosomes mature by fusing with lysosomes, in which cargos of autophagosomes are degraded for recycling. it has been demonstrated that HCV can induce autophagy and transiently suppresses the maturation of autophagosomes in its host cells to enhance its replication. a stable HCV subgenomic RNA replicon cell line that did not express GFP-LC3 also had elevated levels of LC3-II. the membrane flotation analysis indicated that the autophagosome-associated LC3-II and GFP-LC3-I (fraction 3) could be efficiently separated from their respective nonlipidated forms. Huh7-GFP-LC3 cells, GLR cells, and replicon cells without the expression of GFP-LC3 (Replicon) were lysed for Western blot analysis. cellular membranes enriched in fraction 3 were isolated and subjected to affinity purification using the anti-GFP antibody. NS5A could be detected if the membrane vesicles were broken. autophagosomes purified from nutrient-starved Huh7-GFP-LC3 cells were nutrient starved. the most notable proteins that were unique to GLR cells were HCV nonstructural proteins (Table 1). these proteins were not detected when replicon cells that did not express GFP-LC3 were used for the purification procedures. other notable proteins were annexin A2, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), and caveolin-2 (Cav-2) the experiment was conducted as for panel A, with the exception that replicon cells were replaced by nutrient-starved Huh7-GFP-LC3 cells (Sta.) in the analysis, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy to analyze the subcellular localization of Cav-1 in Huh7-GFP-LC3 cells. immunofluorescence microscopy of autophagosomes purified from HCV replicon cells. red arrows denote Cav-1, which was stained with 10-nm gold particles. blue arrows denote GFP-LC3, which was stained with 20-nm gold particles. rapamycin induced autophagy via the inhibition of mTOR. lipid rafts were stained with filipin, which binds to cholesterol. the results indicated the specific association of lipid rafts with HCV-induced autophagosomes. the association of lipid rafts with autophagosomes was independent of HCV genotypes. part of the HCV NS5A protein was also found to colocalize with GFP-LC3 puncta that were positive for Cav-1. the results represent the average from >50 cells that were analyzed. autophagosomes purified from replicon cells mediate HCV RNA replication in vitro. this replication was abolished by the HCV NS5B inhibitor filibuvir. replicon cells that did not express GFP-LC3 were used for the studies. the inclusion of cholesterol together with MCD in the treatment also had little effect on LC3-II, GFP-LC3-II, NS5A, and Cav-1. this effect of MCD on HCV RNA replication was suppressed in the presence of free cholesterol. Huh7 hepatoma cell line stably expressed the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 fusion protein (i.e., Huh7-GFP-LC3 cells) (19) used this cell line to produce another stable cell line that contained the HCV genotype 1b subgenomic RNA replicon. this cell line was called GLR cells (20) to confirm the induction of autophagy by HCV, we performed fluorescence microscopy. NS5A cofractionated mostly with the membrane fractions, as previously reported. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was detected predominantly in the cytosolic fractions (fractions 7 to 10) at the bottom of the sucrose gradient. the staining for NS5A was difficult due to the protection of NS5A by membranes. however, NS5A could be detected if membrane vesicles were broken. autophagosomes purified from nutrient starved cells were larger and more uniform in size. the autophagosomes purified from nutrient-starved Huh7-GFP-LC3 cells were solubilized and subjected to proteomics analysis for the characterization of their associated proteins. a total of 78 protein species and 103 protein species were identified for GLR cells and Huh7-GFP-LC3 cells, respectively. Western blot analysis of proteins associated with autophagosomes. a fraction of total lysates of Huh7-GFP-LC3, GLR, and replicon cells was used as the input control for Western blot analysis. replicon cells were replaced by nutrient-starved. cholesterol was localized primarily to plasma membranes in control Huh7-GFP-LC3 cells. but it was localized to the cytoplasm in GLR cells with a significant fraction of it associated with autophagic puncta. we stained these cells with filipin, a fluorescent dye that binds to cholesterol. h7-GFP-LC3 cells for 1 h to induce autophagic puncta. however, it had no significant effect on subcellular localization of Cav-1. fewer than 10% of GFP-LC3 puncta were positive for Cav-1 in starved cells. FP-LC3 cells with a cell culture-adapted HCV JFH1 variant (22) were fixed at 24 and 48 h postinfection for fluorescence microscopy. however, Cav-1 became colocalized with GFP-LC3 puncta at both 24 and 48 h postinfection. lipid rafts were also associated with autophagosomes induced by HCV infection. autophagosomes purified from HCV replicon cells mediate HCV RNA replication in vitro. the in vitro HCV RNA replication assay was conducted using whole-cell lysates of GLR cells and replicon cells. lipid rafts and HCV nonstructural proteins were associated with autophagosomes. depletion of cholesterol from autophagosomes abolishes HCV RNA replication. we treated autophagosomes purified from GLR cells with methyl-cyclodextrin. inclusion of cholesterol reduced ability of MCD to extract cholesterol from autophagosomes. autophagosomes purified from the parental Huh7 cells were untreated or treated with MCD or MCD plus cholesterol for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Western blot analysis for proteins associated with autophagosomes. this included a sucrose gradient centrifugation step to enrich cellular membranes. the detection of NUP188 in purified autophagosomes would be consistent with its role in HCV RNA replication. it should be noted that many proteins were identified by proteomics analysis. additional studies will be required to confirm the roles of other proteins in the biogenesis of autophagosomes and/or the life cycle of HCV. lipid rafts have been shown to be important for HCV RNA replication (12\u201314) disruption in cell cultures abolished HCV RNA replication (31) lipid rafts as well as HCV nonstructural proteins were associated with HCV-induced autophagosomes. lipid rafts can invaginate to form caveolae. this structure may be important for protecting the integrity of the HCV RNA template. previous studies had also suggested that the HCV RNA replication took place on membranous webs. phagosomes were facilitated due to the expression of UVRAG. it is possible that either efficient viral RNA replication is no longer important for HCV or the locations of viral RNA replication had transitioned from autophagosomes to DMVs. membrane flotation and affinity purification of autophagosomes performed as previously described. cells were seeded in three 100-mm plates, lysed with 1 ml hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2), and passed through a 26-guage needle 20 times. cells were lysed with M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo) or with a hypotonic buffer. cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. s that were affinity purified were resuspended in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, 1 mM UTP, 10 mM CTP, 5 g/ml actinomycin D, and 30 Ci of [-32P]CTP. the reaction mixture was cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.05% sodium azide for 5 min. the staining of cholesterol was conducted using a cholesterol assay kit (Abcam 133116), which contained the fluorescence dye filipin. cell lines, nutrient starvation, and rapamycin treatment were measured using the cholesterol/cholesteryl ester quantitation assay kit (Abcam 65359) cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. cell lysates were pooled and mixed with 4 ml of 80% sucrose solution. the gradient was centrifuged at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor. the membrane fraction was incubated with 50 l anti-GFP monoclonal antibody-conjugated magnetic beads for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h. the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase (TBST)-conjugated secondary antibody. the image was captured using the LAS-4000 imaging system. filibuvir at a final concentration of 100 nM was added to the reaction mixture. the reaction mixture was then incubated at 30\u00b0C for 90 min. the HCV RNA synthesized was then isolated using TRIzol. autophagosomes affinity purified with anti-GFP beads were treated with LSB, 15 mM MCD (Sigma-Aldrich) or 15 mM MCD saturated with cholesterol (Sigma C4951) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min (39)"}
