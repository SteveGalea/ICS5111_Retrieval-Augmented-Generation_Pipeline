{"summary": "EBOV is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus that causes a severe and frequently fatal disease, Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans. this threat is compounded by recent findings demonstrating that EBOV can persist in convalescent patients who can relapse even months after having recovered from EVD. only the interaction with the intracellular receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) within host cell endolysosomes is essential for EBOV entry [13,14,15,16] only the interaction with the intracellular receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) within host cell endolysosomes is essential for EBOV entry. processing removes a glycan cap and a mucin-like domain (MLD) from GP1 and results in catL inhibitor MDL28170 results in rapid acquisition of a single amino acid exchange, V37A, in GP1, which confers resistance against MDL28170 and other CatB/CatL inhibitors. we used a VSV-EBOV chimeric virus encoding firefly luciferase and eGFP and examined inhibition by the catB and/or catL inhibitors. cytotoxicity was measured at 24 h after addition of compound. we defined experimental conditions under which EBOV-GP- but not VSV-G-driven entry was blocked by catB/CatL inhibitors in a concentration-dependent manner. vero E6 cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of the indicated concentrations of protease inhibitors MDL28170 [light blue], CA-074 [purple], and catL inhibitor III [orange]. viability of control-treated cells was set as 100%. supernatants were collected after 24\u201348 h (P1), cleared from cellular debris, diluted 1:100, and inoculated onto fresh, inhibitor-treated target cells (P2). this routine was repeated for a total of five passages (P3\u2013P5), before supernatants were further analyzed. control virus (passage 0, P0) and passage 5 virus replicated more efficiently in the presence of MDL28170 as compared to WT virus (Figure 3A). titers were determined by inoculation of fresh Vero E6 cells with 10-fold serial dilutions of the supernatants (quadruplicates) and calculation of the tissue culture infectious dose 50 per ml (TCID 50/ml) shown are the mean titers of three independent experiments. errors indicate SEM. the introduction of V37A and S195R into EBOV-GP did not interfere with robust GP expression in transfected cells. both mutations did not alter EBOV-GP-driven entry into cell lines of fruit bat (natural reservoir, EpoNi/22.1), macaque (animal model, LLC-MK2), africa green monkey (animal model, vero E6) and human (accidental host, 293T) origin. EBOV-GP was detected as described for panel A. a single amino acid mutation, V37A, rapidly arises upon passaging of VSV-EBOV in presence of MDL28170, CA-074, and CatL inhibitor III. V37A reduces sensitivity of EBOV-GP-driven host cell entry to limited cathepsin availability. the activity of virus-encoded luciferase was measured in cell lysates at 16 h post transduction. mutations in GP1 or GP2 resulted in amino acid substitutions at positions 40, 42, 43, or 47 at the N-terminus of EBOV-GP [29]. some of these amino acid substitutions increased the efficiency of proteolytic processing of precleaved GP and rendered particles bearing precleaved GP more susceptible to inactivation by proteolytic digestion. mutation V37A conferred complete resistance against the largely CatB-specific inhibitor CA-074 (up to the highest concentration tested, 20 M) but not the catB/CatL-specific inhibitors MDL28170 and catL inhibitor III. mutation could destabilize GP in such a way that incomplete processing of GP by CatL and/or other proteases might be sufficient to render GP susceptible to the membrane fusion trigger. the cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium. the cells were cultivated at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 in humidified atmosphere. a chimeric VSV was used that contains the genetic information for EBOV-GP instead of the VSV-G. OV-GP harboring amino acid substitutions V37A, S195R, or V37A + S195R were constructed by overlap extension PCR using the plasmid for EBOV-GP WT as template. sequence identity was confirmed by automated sequence analysis (Microsynth SeqLab) all inhibitors were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), prepared as stock solutions of 50 mM concentration. in vitro-evolution experiments, the supernatants were harvested when >90% of the cells were positive for eGFP expression. the harvested supernatants were freed from cellular debris by centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at 80 \u00b0C. the harvested supernatants were freed from cellular debris by centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at 80 \u00b0C. rhabdoviral transduction vectors were concentrated via centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion (17,000 g, 2 h, 4 \u00b0C) before being mixed with 2 SDS sample buffer and incubated as described above. rhabdoviral transduction vectors were concentrated via centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. for detection of EBOV-GP, we used a GP1-specific serum (rabbit, 1:2500, [50]) for detection of the loading controls beta-actin (ACTB, WCL) and VSV matrix protein (VSV-M, particle incorporation), anti-ACTB (mouse, 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-VSV-M antibodies (mouse, 1:1000, Kerafast) were used. two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with either Dunnet\u2019s (comparison of multiple samples with a single reference sample) or Sidak\u2019s posttest (multi-step comparison of two samples over time) were considered statistically significant. only p values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically significant. pCAGGS-based expression plasmids for mutant EBOV-GP were constructed by overlap extension PCR using the plasmid for EBOV-GP WT as template. all inhibitors were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and prepared as stock solutions of 50 mM concentration. target cells pre-treated with DMSO or increasing concentrations of inhibitor were inoculated with either VSV or VSV-EBOV using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. for infection, cell culture supernatants containing DMSO/inhibitor were removed and cells were inoculated with the virus for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. rhabdoviral transduction vectors are based on a replication-deficient VSV coding for eGFP and FLuc instead of the VSV-G. for transduction, target cells were inoculated with equal volumes of supernatants containing pseudotyped VSV. rhabdoviral transduction vectors were concentrated via centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion (17,000 g, 2 h, 4 \u00b0C) after SDS-PAGE, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. incubation with the primary antibody (diluted in PBS-T) was performed overnight at 4 \u00b0C. analysis of Cytotoxicity Unwanted cytotoxic effects of protease inhibitor treatment were analyzed using the ChemoCam imaging system and the ChemoStar Professional software (Intas Science Imaging Instruments GmbH)."}
