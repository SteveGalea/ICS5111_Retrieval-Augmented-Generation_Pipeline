{"summary": "the world health organization's definition of health added much to the concept. health is closely linked to the development sectors conventionally considered outside the purview of health. the new definition of health broadens to include health and development. the modern epidemic of human immunodeficiency Virus-Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (HIV-AIDS) is a striking example of this mechanism. some studies conducted in africa give evidence to suggest that the poorer sections of the population have a much higher risk of contracting HIV than the non poor community. the literature search in pubmed/medline was conducted using \u2018primary health care\u2019, \u2018economic development\u2019, \u2018human development\u2019, \u2018emerging communicable disease\u2019 and \u2018chronic disease\u2019 as medical subject headings terms. these terms were used as key words in search in web (google scholar) the third world countries have not achieved what the developed nations achieved 50 years back. most deaths worldwide are attributable to very few conditions like pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, measles, malaria, and malnutrition. millions still struggle for even a single meal per day and even deaths due to starvation are being reported from several african countries. a reversal of trend known as \"counter transition\" is occurring in some areas e.g. AIDS, TB, and Arboviral diseases. health problems posed by visual impairment, accidents, injuries, unhealthy life style and work related problems, conflicts, war, and terrorism are assuming bigger challenge. the leading causes of deaths in the third world nations clearly indicate the socio-economic backwardness prevailing in those areas. the world is experiencing a pandemic of Chikungunya along with dengue. the emergence of arboviral infections contributed by the widened geographical distribution of Aedes mosquitoes is the hallmark of the transition. health expenditure is dominated by private sector in india and most of the african counties put much of the burden on the shoulders of the people through out-of-pocket treatment expenditure. financial issues are repeated in almost every developing country. people from the third world countries are often subjected to clinical trials. 'Protecting health from climatic change' was the theme of world health day 2008. extreme air temperatures and air pollution raise disease risk. the third world countries have not achieved what the developed nations achieved 50 years back. most deaths worldwide are attributable to very few conditions like pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, measles, malaria, and malnutrition. about 1 billion people globally are living in extreme poverty on an income of below $1 a day and starving. reversal of trend known as \"counter transition\" is occurring in some areas e.g. AIDS, TB, and Arboviral diseases. the leading causes of deaths in the third world nations clearly indicate the socio-economic backwardness prevailing in those areas. after pneumonia and diarrheal diseases, HIV/AIDS has emerged as the most common cause of mortality among adults aged 15-59 years. the development of drug resistance has emerged as a huge challenge for HIV and Tuberculosis (TB) the world is experiencing a pandemic of Chikungunya along with dengue. multiple factors including the climate change, movement of people, lack of environmental sanitation and enhanced adaptability of vectors make all communities vulnerable to such infections. globalization and neo liberalization has definitely improved the average health indicators. the contribution of central government in the field of health is only 1.65% of gross national product, and it provides only for 11.84% of the total health care expenditure. the healthcare expenditure is dominated by private sector in India and most of the African counties put much of the burden on the shoulders of the people through out-of-pocket treatment expenditure. the Indian Perspective India is a nation which suffers or is likely to suffer the ill effects of all the challenges listed above in a greater magnitude. the old world problems like high incidence of communicable diseases, low performance of maternal and child health indicators, and nutritional problems are the issues that persist in almost all parts of the country even today. the lack of trained personnel is the major bottleneck in this country, hindering the provision of health services in various facilities. the lack of trained personnel is the major bottleneck in this country, hindering the provision of health services in various facilities. the way forward we have to focus on risks rather than diseases. primordial and primary prevention should be given emphasis because interventions in the distal determinants of health are more important in sustaining health."}
