{"summary": "tripeptidyl-peptidase I is a member of the family of sedolisins (serine-carboxyl peptidases) in humans, defects in expression of this enzyme lead to a fatal neurodegenerative disease, classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. sedolisin and kumamolisin have been found in archaea, bacteria, fungi and amoebae. the higher organisms seem to contain only variants of CLN2 [8]. the physiological role of sedolisins in lower organisms has not been elucidated. sequences are available for CLN2 from six species in which it has been found so far. a pairwise comparison of the human and mouse enzymes yields 88% identity and 94% similarity, considerably higher than the median 78.5% identity reported for all identified mouse-human orthologs. background, other conserved residues identified as important for the stability of the enzyme are marked with yellow background. residues identical in at least 5 of the structures are green, and residues similar in their character are shown in magenta. only a fragment of the sequence of the latter enzyme agreed with the former. amino acid sequence compared to the mammalian and zebrafish enzymes is in the amino terminus of the propeptide region that is shorter by 30 amino acids. it is very likely that this represents a fault in the assembled sequence rather than a real variation. the current coding frame is not initiated with a methionine. discovery of highly conserved CLN2-like enzymes may indicate that these peptidases are universally present in the vertebrates. the medical importance of CLN2 and lack of a crystal structure inspired attempts at protein modeling. the first such model assumed that this enzyme is membrane-bound. however, this model was clearly incorrect. sequences of sedolisin, kumamolisin, and human CLN2 used in the construction of the model of the latter enzyme. r.m.s. deviation between the corresponding C coordinates of the model of CLN2 is about 1.75, not much larger than the experimental difference between sedolisin and kumamolisin. sedolisin or kumamolisin with inhibitors contain either a tyrosine or a phenylalanine occupying the S1 pocket. part of the pocket is fully conserved among different sedolisins. similar views have been previously published for the experimentally-determined structures of sedolisin and kumamolisin [8]. the figure was prepared using the program DINO http://www.bioz.unibas.ch/xray/dino. the location of the P3 side chain of the substrate is ambiguous. it could point in either one of two directions by exchange with the N-terminal amine. the only negatively charged residue of CLN2 that is found in this vicinity is Asp132. the role of the latter mutation is completely clear. it replaces the catalytic serine of CLN2 with a side chain that cannot support its enzymatic activity. a wide distribution of these mutations supports the conclusion that any modifications to CLN2 that would abolish or impair its function could lead to the development of the disease. the model of CLN2 can easily accommodate this peptide on the P side of the substrate-binding site. a number of different tripeptides can be serially processed from glucagon. other potentially biologically relevant substrates include cholecystokinin. complete sequences are available for CLN2 from six species in which it has been found so far. the full-length enzymes consist of 563 amino acids arranged in a single polypeptide chain containing both the prosegment and the catalytic domain. the overall sequence identity for these enzymes is 81%. a few minor modifications can bring the zebrafish sequence into good agreement with that of the fugu CLN2. these modifications include a deletion of a single nucleotide from a run of three, as well as three insertions of repeated nucleotide pairs. it must be stressed that these modifications are speculative and may lead to prediction of several incorrect amino acids. s are shown for CLN2 from human, fugu, and zebrafish. a partial sequence of its sedolisin-TPP (AL594774) spans the middle part of the catalytic domain. the sequenced part shows 75% identity with the fugu sedolisin-TPP. sedolisin, kumamolisin, and sedolisin were subsequently obtained structures. the homology model was based on a complex of sedolisin with a covalently-bound inhibitor, pseudo-iodotyrostatin. other similar peptides with an aldehyde functionality on their \"C-termini\" are weak inhibitors of this enzyme. 342 residues in the model were found to be ideally positioned to form a disulfide bond. this is suggested by the fact that these two cysteines are strictly conserved in all known animal species of CLN2. if this bond were experimentally found to exist in CLN2 it would provide support for the correctness of the model. this part of the main chain is held in place through a hydrogen-bonded interaction with the side chain of Thr279, part of the signature sequence SGTSAS surrounding the catalytic Ser280. the equivalent residue in CLN2 is Thr182, but it is very unlikely that it can. polar residue found in CLN2 is Cys170, much less polar than its counterparts. the side of the S1 pocket in CLN2 contains only a much smaller Ser174. kumamolisin is missing it entirely due to a deletion in the corresponding sequence position. the only negatively charged residue of CLN2 that is found in this vicinity is Asp132. this would involve breaking of the hydrogen bond between Asp132 and Ser139. however, this latter interaction is not likely to be structurally crucial. s in the structure supports the conclusion that any modifications to CLN2 that would abolish or impair its function could lead to the development of the disease. s in the structure supports the conclusion that any modifications to CLN2 that would abolish or impair its function could lead to the development. all of these tripeptides can be easily accommodated in the substrate-binding site of the CLN2 model. other potentially biologically relevant substrates include cholecystokinin and possibly other neuropeptides [21] an intriguing property of CLN2 is its reported ability to cleave collagen-related peptides. sedolisin and kumamolisin proteins are the only members of the newly-defined sedolisin/serine-carboxyl peptidase family. sedolisin and kumamolisin proteins are the only members of the newly-defined sedolisin/serine-carboxyl peptidase family [8] for which the crystal structures have been published. sedolisin and kumamolisin sequences were aligned to the crystal structure-identified core regions of the sedolisin and kumamolisin sequences. the sequences were divided into two groups: those closer to sedolisin than kumamolisin and vise-a-versa. atomic-scale models of CLN2 were developed by exploiting sequence similarity to the sedolisin and kumamolisin proteins (r.m.s. deviation of 1.0 for 273 pairs of C atoms in the core of the enzymes) these enzymes are the only members of the newly-defined sedolisin/serine-carboxyl peptidase family. sedolisin, kumamolisin, and the human CLN2 sequences were found aligned to the crystal structure-identified core regions of the sedolisin and kumamolisin sequences. sequence alignment was manually set by the observed structural alignment of the sedolisin and kumamolisin proteins. a similar two-step approach was used to manifest the insertions and deletions in the variable, loop regions of the protein. the model was finished by performing energy minimization in vacuo with the computer program CHARMM [31]. the final quality of the structure was analyzed with the computer program PROCHECK [32]. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. the work was supported in part by a grant-in-aid for scientific research."}
