{"summary": "osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) can be divided into traumatic and non traumatic ONFH clinically. it is generally believed that the disease is an irreversible process. over-dose steroid could induce apoptosis of osteoblast and osteocyte, thus decreasing the number of osteocyte. hypoxia could enhance glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in osteoblastic cells. hypoxia could enhance glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in osteoblastic cells. the primers of rs1800629 were 5\u2019-GAAGTTAGAAGGAAACAGACCACAG-3\u2019 (forward), 5\u2019-TGTGGTCTCCTCTTCTAACTTCC-3\u2019 (reverse); the primers of rs1799964 were 5\u2019-AGAAGATGAAGGAGAAGTC-3\u2019 (forward), primer 5\u2019-CCTGTAACCCATTCCTCAGCCGC-3\u2019 (reverse). PCR reaction was 50 l with 8.0 the tests were all two-tailed, P-value 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 100 healthy controls were all unrelated blood donors, including 65 males and 35 females. the primers of rs1800629 were 5\u2019-GAAGTTAGAAGGAAACAGACCACAG-3\u2019 (forward), 5\u2019-TGTGGTCTCCTCTTCTAACTTCC-3\u2019 (reverse); the primers of rs1799964 were 5\u2019-AGAAGATGAAGGAGAAGTC-3\u2019 (forward), primer 5\u2019-CCTGTAACCCATTCCTCAGCCGC-3\u2019 (reverse). primers were designed with Primer 5 software (Shanghai SANGON Biotechnology Company) the 5\u2019 end of the primers was all labeled with Biotin. PCR reaction was 50 l with 8.0 pmol/L primers, 1 l DNA, 2ULA Taq enzyme (Invitrogen) and distilled water. after denaturation, the filter was left in 20 ml developing solution for 5-15 min under room temperature. the differences of environmental factors between cases and controls were calculated by 2 test. the tests were all two-tailed, P-value 0.05 were considered statistically significant. logistic regression was used to evaluate the functions of each genotype. 64 0.014 3.70 (1.31-10.43) - - 1 A 64 (26.7) 32 (16.0) 7.276 0.008 1.91 (1.19-3.07) rs1799964 TT 92 (76.7) 67 (67.0) - 1 CT 23 (19.1) 30 (30.0) 3.351 0.067 0.56 (0.30-1.05) CC 5 (4.2) 3 (3.0) 0.067 0.795 1.21 (0.28-5.26) T 207 methylprednisolone treatment No 54 (45.0) 53 (53.0) 0.279 Yes 66 (55.0) 47 (47.0) Leg hurt by electric shocks No 68 (56.7) 55 (55.0) 0.892 Yes 52 (43.3) 45 (45.0) Drinking No 56 (46.7) 54 (54.0) 0.343 Yes 64 (53.3) 46 (46.0) ** P0.05. there was remarkable interaction between polymorphisms of TNF- and hypoxia. correlation analysis between TNF- polymorphisms and SONFH. rs1800629 GG 75 (62.5) 73 (73.0) - 1 AG 26 (21.7) 22 (22.0) 0.177 0.741 1.15 (0.60-2.21) a 64 (26.7) 32 (16.0) 7.276 0.008 1.91 (1.19-3.07) rs1799964 TT 92 (76.7) 67 (67.0) - 1 CT 23 (19.1) 30 (30.0) 3.351 0.067 0.56 (0.30-1.05) CC 5 (4.2) 3 (3.0) 0.067 0.795 1.21 (0.28-5.26) T 207(86.2) 164 (82) - - 1 C 33 (13.8 logistic regression was used to estimate the interaction of TNF- gene polymorphisms and hypoxia on SONFH. GG and variant genotypes of rs1800629 all could increase the risk to suffer SONFH (OR: 2.12, 3.78) osteocyte apoptosis, also known as programme cell death (PCD), was well-organized cell death controlled by genes. it serves as a crucial factor in occurrence of bone tissue, bone formation and bone remodeling. hypoxia-inducible factor could prevent osteonecrosis of the femoral head. the polymorphisms of ACE, a hypoxia-related gene, were associated with steroid-induced ONFH."}
