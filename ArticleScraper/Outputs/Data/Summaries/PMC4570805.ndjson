{"summary": "emergence and global spread of novel pH1N1 influenza A virus in early 2009 presented a number of new challenges to policy makers and epidemiologists. estimating the basic reproduction number, R0 [5] is paramount for assessing the effectiveness of different intervention strategies. if R0 is greater than one, the infection will eventually die out. a new approach to network modeling is outlined to demonstrate how well the real time estimation of R0 can be obtained in the early stages of a disease outbreak, using simulated data. we first introduce the homogeneous model (model A) without age-structure and then heterogeneous model (model B) that includes age structure. the excess degree z 2 z 1 was assumed to be the same to every individual. we defined as the transmission rate of an infected individual to a susceptible individual if the individual was not infected previously. the number of susceptible S(t), infected I(t) and recovered R(t individuals will vary simultaneously. the only available information during the outbreak is the number of newly reported cases at time t, denoted as J(t) the basic reproduction number can be obtained at time t by the following formula R 0 ( t ) = z 2 z 1 i = 0 t (i ) T (i ) (4) c) Age-Structured Model (Model B) is a modified version of model A, where age specific contact patterns are included. z 2 z 1 = i = 1 k n ( i ) z ( i ) n we estimate. the basic reproduction number from model B can then be obtained numerically by using Eq (4). a network approach to estimate R0 Contact network models characterize the contacts between individuals in a social setting that can potentially result in disease transmission. the number of contacts an individual has is denoted by k. r was defined as the removal rate of an infected individual. t = e r t and t = r e r t are probability function that the time for an individual to be removed at time t and its corresponding probability density function respectively. at time t, the expected transmissibility of infectious individuals before they are removed can be calculated as T r ( t ) = i = 0 t T ( i ) C ( t i ) i = 0 t ( i ) C ( t i ) i = 0 t ( i ) C ( t i ) i = 0 t J ( i ) is the cumulative number of new infections at time age-structured model (Model B) is a modified version of model A. we defined k age groups with n individuals in the population. excess degree of ith age group z(i) for i = 1, 2,..., k is calculated based on the degree distribution of n(i) individuals in ith age group. the same degree distribution as simulated data and the number of daily reported cases are inputs of both model A (without age structure) and proposed model B (with age structure) ongoing estimate of R0 from each model will be provided. six known values of R0 (Fig 1A\u20131F) are 2.05, 2.58, 3.12 1.51, 1.52 and 1.53 respectively. model B with age structure yields a better estimate of R0. between day 0 and day 15, less than 100 cases are required to estimate R0. model B shows a quick convergence to the true value of R0. model A cannot accurately estimate R0, especially when inter-group heterogeneity in the contact network is high. we run simulations on each age group using three datasets where the contacts are uniformly distributed. in total, there were 28,338 laboratory-confirmed cases during the period between 30th April 2009 and 7th February 2010. the removal distribution can also be derived using the 24,873 cases with complete information on symptomatic notification date and symptoms onset date. median number of days to be removed is 1 day. parameter estimates in model A Overall excess degree in Hong Kong 23.0 This value is derived from the degree distribution of 770 subjects who provided either an exact or a range number of close contacts in the interview-led questionnaire survey in the 2009 Hong Kong population-based serological study. this value is derived from the weighted average of z(1) and z(2) and the proportion of the two age groups in the population in 2009. we derived the excess degree and degree distribution for each age group from an analysis of the number of close contacts, k, experienced by 770 participants aged 3 to 102 years. out of 770 subjects, 710 subjects recorded how many close contacts they had experienced. the estimate of R0 under model A converges to 1.21 in late August (Day 115), which is slightly higher than the estimate from model B. the number of cases required for model B to converge to estimate R0 of 1.2 and 1.12 up to day 30 and 82 are 66 and 2200, respectively. model B provides a reliable estimate of R0 in the early stage of an epidemic, even in the presence of noise or dominant stochastic fluctuations. even for the real data, our proposed model B can still provide estimates of R0 in the early stage of epidemics as of day 30. estimates from model A are sensitive to the degree of contact heterogeneity. estimates from model B are not. for simplicity, we have illustrated different scenarios of degree distribution for only two age groups to test both model A and B. despite uncertainty about non-perfect observations collected from the field during an outbreak, this approach could still make an important contribution to the estimation of the basic reproduction number in the early phases of an epidemic."}
