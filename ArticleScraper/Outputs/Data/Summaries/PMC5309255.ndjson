{"summary": "many commonly recognized food- and waterborne infections are caused by viruses that are transmitted by the fecal-oral route. caliciviruses can cause diarrhea and vomiting and less commonly astroviruses, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses. other viruses cause symptoms resulting from extra-intestinal spread, like hepatitis A (HAV), and hepatitis E (HEV). metagenomic analysis using untargeted sequencing has received a lot of attention. the high throughput of current sequencing technologies has made it possible to obtain multiple high coverage genomes from highly complex samples. metagenomics is starting to become mature enough for applications outside of the research environment. the full extent of disease can only be captured through epidemiological studies addressing incidence and etiology at community level coupled with severity of a range of enteric pathogens. it is challenging to distinguish between foodborne outbreaks and outbreaks caused by direct contact between humans. heterogeneity in clinical interpretation can be caused by host factors, such as differences in the expression of histo-blood-group antigens that are receptors for rota- and noroviruses. surveillance likely only captures the tip of the iceberg of food- and waterborne viral disease cases. layers represent different categories of infected individuals. individuals reported by surveillance programs generally originate from hospitalized category. a viral outbreak associated with food- and waterborne transmission still requires extensive epidemiological analysis or confirmation of a virus in the infected individual. the surveillance programs for these viruses in the human food chain are limited, in contrast to the american CDC1 and the European ECDC2 surveillance programs for bacteria and parasitic pathogens. a popular approach has been to quantify the proportion of foodborne disease of humans to their likely origin. a popular approach has been to quantify the proportion of foodborne disease of humans to their likely origin. this model does not allow estimating the proportion of foodborne disease where food is a vehicle for person-to-person transmission. the second most common disease syndrome is hepatitis, caused by HAV, a fecal-orally transmitted virus (Havelaar et al., 2015). contamination of food products by viruses prevalent in food producing regions can increase the risk of outbreaks in these regions. several studies have shown the zoonotic potential of HEV from pigs. a large proportion of food-related HEV infections, however, does not lead to hospitalization of the patient, leading to under-reporting and unrecognized risk. in the cases of Monkeypox and Nipah this only led to small epidemics. when the virus is well adapted to spread from human to human this can lead to larger outbreaks, as seen during the Ebola crisis in 2015. urbanization and globalization of travel and trade provides ample and increasing opportunity for further spread. metagenomics is a term used for experiments in which all nucleic acids in a certain sample are sequenced. but since viruses lack such a universally conserved motif, viral metagenomics refers to the attempt to recover full and partial genomes of all viruses present in the sample. metagenomics can be used in environments associated with viruses spread via the food- and waterborne route. untargeted metagenomic sequencing has been shown to be able to capture a multitude of viruses in sewage samples in several studies. comparison between sewage viromes from Nigeria, Nepal, Bangkok, and California showed distinct differences in subsets of detected human viruses. percentages of unmapped sequences range from 37 to 66%. preliminary studies show potential of untargeted metagenomic sequencing to detect novel and known human pathogens. urtak et al., 2016; urtak et al., 2016. untargeted metagenomic sequencing is especially suited for these types of screenings. the origin and potential viral content of these samples are often completely unknown. the initial attempts should be looked at as potentially interesting surveillance approaches. the use of this integrative approach has been demonstrated in an investigation of a hospital outbreak of human parainfluenza virus. both the detection of the virus, the diagnosis of the disease and the establishment of viral clusters and transmission routes could be derived from the metagenomic sequencing data. a similar approach should enable investigation of viruses related to food- or waterborne diseases. the use of near-real-time sequencing of Ebola and Zika has received a lot of attention. metagenomics can be used in environments associated with viruses spread via the food- and waterborne route. this gives an overview of all these viruses and circumvents the mentioned sampling biases. a study that looked at viruses from sewage capable to infect human epithelial cells was able to detect a large number of bacteriophages. a more recent evaluation of untargeted metagenomic sequencing for surveillance purposes retrieved full genomes of Adeno-associated virus-2 as the most prominent mammalian virus in the sample. this virus is generally not associated with any pathology and cannot be grown in cell cultures. food contamination in combination with international trade contributes to the spread of food- and waterborne viruses. metagenomic sequencing of viruses has been shown in a study isolating viruses in the family of Reoviridae and Picobirnaviridae. large numbers of animals are kept in a confined environment for an extended period, increasing opportunities for the spread of infections. the use of metagenomic sequencing is that of concomitant clinical application (diagnosis of patients) and public health application (typing and cluster analysis) sequencing technology is still in its infancy, however. it remains to be investigated if food-related viral outbreaks will be traceable. the same on-site technology has been shown to be beneficial in tracing foodborne salmonella. the Ion Torrent platform delivers a smaller number of reads in a smaller timeframe, which is beneficial when a timely result is necessary. novel approaches, such as the MinION nanopore sequencer, increase speed and depth of coverage at the cost of sequence error rate. metagenomic sequencing is sensitive enough to pick up contaminants from lab reagents or previous experiments. alternating the sample-specific DNA barcodes in multiplex sequencing experiments reduces contamination from previous runs. bioinformatics tools such as DeconSeq have been developed to check for signals of regularly found lab contamination in the sequencing data. zel et al., 2016), and Diamond (Buchfink et al., 2014) have increased the speed of sequence assignment to reference database with several orders of magnitude, while requiring relatively modest processing power. metagenome assembly is still a challenging task, often requiring manual editing to resolve miss-assemblies. a large reference database with less-well curated annotation data can lead to the spurious assignment of sequencing reads to one of these genomes. the alleged detection of genomic material of Yersinia pestis in the subway system could have mapped with similar likelihood to other bacterial species. high genome coverage combined with close sequence identity to a viral reference genome with a known pathogenic phenotype are currently the strongest links between metagenomic sequencing data and disease etiology. currently employed PCR based methods suffer from the same limitations (D\u2019Agostino et al., 2011) large abundance of viral infections causing mild symptoms carry a large portion of the global food- and waterborne disease burden. this disease burden is expanded by consequential infections and outbreaks of these viruses in susceptible populations. surveillance efforts should look to metagenomic sequencing technologies, bioinformatics analysis tools and data sharing initiatives to get a more realistic insight in the global burden of food- and waterborne viral disease."}
