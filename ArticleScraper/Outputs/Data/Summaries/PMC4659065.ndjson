{"summary": "the most severe infections are attributed to influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) the low sensitivity of rapid antigen tests and the delayed time to result of viral culture has led to an increase of FDA-cleared tests and systems designed to detect these viruses. influenza virus is a highly contagious respiratory illness that results in 1,250,000 deaths annually worldwide. BD VeritorTM System for Rapid Detection of RSV is a new-generation lateral flow immunochromatographic assay. it uses an instrumented read for the direct and qualitative detection of RSV antigen from nasopharyngeal wash/aspirates (NPW/A) and nasopharyngeal swab from patients suspected of having a viral respiratory infection. 101 pediatric outpatients with clinical signs consistent with influenza and 50 with RSV infection were seen at three health care facilities. patients who had two notable incorporation criteria off ever 38.0\u00b0C and history of exposure to anyone with suspected influenza infection were seen at three health care facilities. one swab was immediately tested by RIAT (Rapid Flu and Rapid Flu II Sticks; Sekisui Medical, Tokyo, Japan) and POCTEM INFLUENZA A/B (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) the second swab was placed in Universal Viral Transport Medium (Becton Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan) the third swab was placed in Rapid influenza diagnostic test (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, the assay uses development of a colorimetric signal via deposition of a proprietary enhanced colloidal-gold particle at the test line. the assay test strips are designed with spatially distinct zones including positive and negative control line positions, and separate test line positions.
