{"summary": "a total of 33,238 unigenes were assembled from more than 28 million of high quality short reads. the quality of the assembly was experimentally examined by cDNA sequencing. studies have shown that da-Qing-Ye and Ban-Lan-Gen have a wide range of pharmacological bioactivities, including antivirus [2], [3], [4], anti-bacterial [5], anti-endotoxic [6], antitumor [7], anti-inflammatory [9], and immune regulatory effects [10]. the clinical and pharmacological properties of I. indigotica attracted investigations on the cellular biochemical and biological aspects of latex biogenesis. lack of genomic sequences, particularly sequences of functional genes, makes it now impossible to improve the performance of I. indigotica by gene transformation. RNA-seq is one of the recently developed high-throughput sequencing methods that are able to produce millions of short cDNA reads in a parallel manner. messenger RNAs isolated from leaves and roots of the vigorously vegetative growth stages were used in creation of RNA-seq library. the unigenes were then annotated by BLASTX search, Gene Ontology and pathway analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 73,655 transcripts with a median size (N50) of 1,818 bp and 33,238 unigenes with an N50 of 1,628 bp were assembled. of the 33,238 unigenes, 54% were longer than 500 bp. the total length of the assembled transcriptome is 32.4 Mbp. cDNA fragment was amplified for all seven unigenes. each primer set was used to amplify the corresponding genomic DNA (gDNA) of the seven unigenes. gDNA sizes of two unigenes were the same as their corresponding cDNAs. of the 24,790 unigenes with an orthologous match, 15,498 (62.5%) had a match with an annotated function, the remaining had a match only classified as hypothetical protein, predicted protein or putative protein. the remaining 27 unigenes matched previously reported I. tinctoria genes. s could be classified into 24 clusters based on clusters of orthologous groups (COG) analysis. most of these classified unigenes belong to the cluster of \u201cgeneral function prediction\u201d (2,163; 28.1%), followed by clusters of \u201creplication, recombination and repair\u201d (1179; 15.3%), \u201ctranscription\u201d (1,058; 13.7%) and \u201csignal transduction mechanisms\u201d. identification of 45 unigenes involved in nitrogen metabolism and 8 unigenes related to biosynthesis of indole alkaloids in I. Indigotica. identification of SSRs in I. indigotica unigenes Transcriptome is important sequence resource for identification and development of molecular markers. in the 20 types of tri-nucleotide SSRs, GAA (10.85%) was the most common SSR, followed by AGA (8.81%), TCT (8.41%) and AAG (6.85%) so far there is no publically available SSR in I. indigotica. 73,655 transcripts with a median size (N50) of 1,818 bp and 33,238 unigenes with an N50 of 1,628 bp were assembled. of the 33,238 unigenes, 54% were longer than 500 bp. 4,000 unigenes (12.16%) were longer than 2 kb. assembled unigenes were searched against the NCBI non-redundant protein database using BLASTX with a cut-off E-value of 105. out of the 33,238 unigenes, 24,790 unigenes (74.6%) had a match, and 8,448 (25.4%) did not have a match. 98 (62.5%) had a match with an annotated function, the remaining had a match only classified as hypothetical protein, predicted protein or putative protein. in total, 28,184 unigenes had a match in at least one of the aforementioned databases, and 3,228 had a hit only in the nt database without detailed annotation. the clusters represented by the least number of unigenes were \u201ccell motility\u201d (11; 0.14%), \u201cnuclear structure\u201d (2; 0.03%) and none was related to \u201cextracellular structures\u201d (0). in total, 5,398 unigenes could be assigned to 299 pathways that belong to six categories. identification of 45 unigenes involved in nitrogen metabolism and 8 unigenes related to biosynthesis of indole alkaloids in I. Indigotica. identification of SSRs in I. indigotica unigenes Transcriptome is an important sequence resource for identification and development of molecular markers. GO and COG are the most commonly used for functional classification of unigenes. GO and GO classifications revealed that the assembled I. indigotica unigenes have diverse molecular functions. studies on the LEA gene (i.e. IiLEA) of I. indigotica suggest that expression of IiLEA could be induced by environmental stresses, such as drought and salt treatments. studies on these genes could provide useful information for on secondary metabolism in I. indigotica. leaf and root samples were collected from two vegetative growth stages. the stages with 810 leaves and 1416 leaves were selected. the medicinal materials of Da-Qing-Ye and Ban-Lan-Gen are collected at the 816-leaf stage and 1416-leaf stage. clean reads were assembled using the command of Trinity.pl. sequences stored in file \u201cTrinity.fasta\u201d are treated as transcripts. the Blast2 GO program was used to obtain GO annotations for the unigenes using a cut-off value of 105. this analysis mapped all of the annotated unigenes to GO terms in the database and counted the number of unigenes associated with each term. the software was then used to plot GO functional classification for the unigenes. cDNA fragments were amplified in a mastercycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using unigene-specific primers. primers were listed in Table S1. cDNAs and their corresponding genomic DNAs were aligned to find intron(s) in the unigenes. RNA-seq library was constructed from mRNA using the Paired-End Sample Preparation Kit. the library was prepared from 200\u2013250 bp (average size 230 bp) size selected cDNA fragments. sequences stored in file \"Trinity.fasta\" are treated as transcripts. the standalone Blat software was used to cluster transcripts into clusters. the longest transcript in a clustering unit was selected as unigene. the software was then used to plot GO functional classification for the unigenes with a GO term hit. the unigenes were scanned for microsatellites using the MISA software. the criteria for the SSRs are as follows: mono-nucleotide type SSR requires a minimum of 10 repeats. reverse primers (2 M), 2 L of MgCl2 (2.5 mM), 0.2 L of Taq DNA Polymerase (5000 U/mL), 2 L of dNTPs (2 mM) and 9.8 L of ddH2O. cDNAs and their corresponding genomic DNAs were aligned to find intron(s) in the unigenes.
