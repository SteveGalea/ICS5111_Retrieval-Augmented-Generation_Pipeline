{"summary": "the hierarchical clustering tree (HCT) with a dendrogram [1] and the singular value decomposition (SVD) with a dimension-reduced representative map [2] are popular methods for two-way sorting the gene-by-array matrix map employed in gene expression profiling. the proposed method provides more meaningful biomedical insights than other sorting algorithms. ing tree and the singular value decomposition are the two methods for identifying suitable gene/array permutations. this section briefly reviews the advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques using the fibroblast to serum gene expression data. bar-Joseph et al. [7] had detailed discussion on the HCT intermediate nodes flipping phenomena. each of these intermediate nodes can be flipped independently resulting in 2n-1 possible orderings of the terminal nodes. Chen [3] introduced a sorting algorithm called rank-two ellipse (R2E) seriation which improves the SVD method by extracting the elliptical structure of the converging sequence of iteratively formed correlation matrices. we see that the R2E sorted correlation matrix identifies a very smooth transitional pattern. global trend and the Robinson matrix are not common to permute the orders of arrays with time series nature. the local pattern and the global trend usually do not co-exist well in a given matrix unless a Robinson form [15] can be permuted from the matrix. Figure 2a has the between-array correlation matrix with time series randomized. the up and down (non-monotonic) pattern in every column and row illustrates a clear non- (anti-) Robinson structure. an HCT may end up as the matrix in Figure 2b. the Pearson product moment correlation was used to measure between-genes and between-arrays association. an HCT is \"grown\" on the 517-by-517 correlation matrix for genes. the relative order of the 517 leaves of the dendrogram is applied to sort the 517 rows/columns. bar-Joseph et al. [7] proposed a heuristic algorithm for constructing k-ary trees by extending and improving the optimal leaf ordering algorithm in [7]. the R2E sorted correlation matrix identifies a very smooth transitional pattern. we propose to guide the flipping mechanism of a conventional agglomerative HCT using the rank-two ellipse seriation of Chen [3] as an external reference. a Robinson matrix is a symmetric matrix such that rij rik if j k i and rij rik if i j k. the basic property of a Robinson matrix is monotonicity as one proceeds from the main-diagonal elements to all four margins of the given matrix. the correlation matrix sorted by the R2E order keeps a near-Robinson form as can be seen in Figure 2c. the permuted correlation matrix displays simultaneously the three-cluster pattern and the smooth time series trend, Figure 2d. we only summarize the results of two HCT and two non-HCT algorithms: SVD2, R2E, HCT_OPT, and HCT_R2E. we plot the GAR loss scores and the RGAR loss scores in Figures 3ab. the optimal hierarchical clustering tree, HCT_OPT, has the best performance among the four HCTs for the smallest window-size area (1 w 35); the proposed HCT_R2E algorithm actually scores best for a small period in the middle range (35 w 75); the R2E algorithm dominates the competition from w = 100 on. the outer circle represents the 145 genes sorted with the known phase information. the simple match score computes the proportion of correct matches for all 145 gene positions. the weighted match score assigns weights of (2, 1, 0) to genes that deviate from the known phase by (0, 1, 2) phase groups. the total deviation score sums the deviations (by number of genes) of all 145 genes to the boundaries of their known phases. HCT_R2E arranged the 145 genes at positions very close to their annotated phase positions. several genes deviated far away from their annotated cell cycle phases. the proposed algorithm can be applied to either verify known biological conditions or to explore unknown phenomena. there are three major differences between this example and the yeast cell cycle data analysis. these are not time series gene expression data; the focus is on the between-sample structure instead of the gene set. the proximity measure adopted is the between-sample Euclidean distance instead of the correlation coefficient. the severity rank of samples was significantly correlated with the clinical pulmonary infection score and other clinical factors. the severity rank of samples was also found to be highly correlated with the suppression of the human adaptive immune system and the up-regulation of the host receptors for corona viruses of SARS. Halobacterium NRC-1 was exposed for five hours to at least three concentrations of each of the six transition metals. an HCT and a correspondence analysis are carried out using 468 genes that changed significantly in at least two conditions out of a total of 19. their HCT permutation for the 19 metal conditions does not correlate well with the pattern displayed in their CA plot for the conditions. the overall permutation does not correlate well with the linear trend of transition metal groups. the proposed method is capable of providing permutations with both good global and local properties. the optimal HCT still outputs better local orders numerically. GAR curves (window-size ranges from 1 to 516) for the four sorting algorithms plotted in Figure 3a. both HCT algorithms outperform two non-HCT (smooth curves) in small window-size area. proposed HCT_R2E method actually scores best for a small period in the middle range. Yeast cell cycle data These data are a subset of the original 6240 genes expressed at 17 time points. expression at one abnormal time point was removed from the data set. results In addition to lower intermediate to global GAR and RGAR loss scores, the permutation identified by the proposed HCT_R2E method also possesses more meaningful biological implications than the other algorithms. the proposed HCT_R2E algorithm outperforms the other seven algorithms in all three matching scores. the cell cycle diagrams sorted by the three algorithms can be roughly separated into three classes: Table 1. the 15 genes with largest deviations from their annotated phase groups sorted by the proposed HCT_R2E algorithm are bold-faced. the proposed algorithm can be applied to either verify known biological conditions or to explore unknown phenomena. coronavirus (SARS-CoV) data [17] is highly correlated with the suppression of the human adaptive immune system and the up-regulation of the host receptors for corona viruses. the severity rank of samples was significantly correlated with the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) and other clinical factors.

SVD1 and HCT_OPT algorithms share second place. a clear linear trend Mn [II]-Fe [II]-Cu [II]-Co [II]-Zn [II] is observed, with Ni [II] conditions that deviate significantly from this trend. an average linkage HCT is built on the paired Euclidean distance matrix of the 19 metal conditions. the proposed HCT_R2E method is capable of providing permutations with both good global and local properties. the optimal HCT always produces permutations with best local behaviour. the rank-two ellipse seriation gives the best global grouping patterns and smooth transitional trends. rank-two ellipse seriation method is only capable of identifying the global between-cluster pattern, not the within-cluster relationship. the optimal tree method gives better permutations than the proposed method for such circumstances. the R2E algorithm (and the HCT_R2E method) is computationally more time consuming than other methods. the optimal tree method gives better permutations than the proposed method. it takes a personal computer running C++ on Windows XP about (0.09 sec, 9.09 sec, and 2.71 hr) to obtain the R2E permutations. the computation complexity for R2E is of order n3. expression matrix displays a clear smooth transitional two-component pattern. the R2E method always summarizes the embedding variation structure into the final two eigenvectors. the second advantage is that it can be applied to any given proximity matrix. the proposed algorithm for gene clustering is illustrated as steps 05 in Figure 7. it is necessary to develop clustering and visualization methods that can simultaneously explore local behaviours and global grouping effects of gene expression profiles. travelling salesman algorithm optimizes permutation by minimizing consecutive distances along the entire permutation. the anti-Robinson event-count (AR in equation 1 and Figure 8b) works well for global performance. a window-size between 1 and n-1 opens up a banding area from the main-diagonal for counting the number of anti-Robinson events. the generalized anti-Robinson criterion (GAR) is called the generalized anti-Robinson criterion (GAR) here. R2E improves SVD in identifying even smoother global permutations. the sorted gene-by-gene correlation matrix is displayed in Figures 1b. the sorted expression matrix displays a smooth transitional two-component pattern. we want to emphasize the importance of visualization of sorted proximity matrices. integration of local clustering patterns and global grouping structures. global clustering patterns and smooth transitional trends could signal some biological processes at a higher-level control. HR, 20HR, 24HR with N3O = 5, 6, 7, 8 and N4O = 9, 10, 11 are assigned the upper and lower sub-nodes of N1 respectively since mean(N3O) = 6.5 10 = mean(N4O). anti-Robinson event-count (AR in equation 1 and Figure 8b) works well for global performance. window-size is the number of columns (rows) from the diagonal of D that we consider in calculating the anti-Robinson events. small window-sizes refer to criteria for considering only local behaviours. larger window-sizes refer to criteria for more global relationship between subjects. the RGAR curves have better resolution for small window-size region than the GAR curves for comparing performance of algorithms. the rank-two ellipse seriation and the R2E-guided hierarchical clustering tree methods are implemented in the GAP (generalized association plots) system. the authors are grateful to Donald Ylvisaker, Konan Peck, Chiun-How Kao, and shengLi Tzeng for valuable suggestions and assistance. the comments of two anonymous reviews are gratefully acknowledged."}
