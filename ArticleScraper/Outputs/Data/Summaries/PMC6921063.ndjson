MRC-5 cells were treated with 0.2, 1, and 5 M of the compounds at 24 h before infection with HCoV-OC43 (pre-treatment) compound administration at 24 h after treatment significantly increased MRC-5 cell survival in a dose-dependent manner at a rate comparable to that of the co-treatment group. the compounds were added at 24 h before, during, or 24 h after HCoV-OC43 infection of MRC-5 cells. cell viability of pre, co-, post- compound treated cells was assessed using the MTS assay at four dpi. MRC-5 cells were treated with 5 M compounds (Vehicle 0.025% DMSO) for 24 h (pre 24), 12 h (pre 12), 6 h (pre 6), and 3 h (pre 3) prior to HCoV-OC43 infection or during infection (co 0\u201396), at 12 h (post 12\u201396), 24 h (post 24\u201396), and 48 h (post 48\u201396) post-infection. virus infection promoted cell death and increased the release of HCoV-OC43 into the supernatant. however, treatment with TET, FAN, and CEP significantly inhibited virus-induced cell death and the release of the virus into the supernatant. however, compound treatment significantly decreased the copy number of viral RNA in cell lysates in the vehicle group. HCoV-OC43 copy number, nucleoprotein (N) and spike glycoprotein (S) protein expression, and sialic acid acetylesterase (SIAE) mRNA levels in MRC-5 cells were inhibited. images were captured by fluorescence microscopy at two dpi.

MRC-5 cells were infected with HCoV-OC43, and the compounds (5 M) were added. the supernatants and cell lysates were harvested at 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi. compound treatment significantly inhibited virus-induced cell death. mRNA levels of sialic acid acetylesterase were dramatically induced by HCoV-OC43 infection in MRC-5 cells at four dpi. mRNA levels of sialic acid acetylesterase were dramatically induced by HCoV-OC43 infection in MRC-5 cells at four dpi. oV-OC43-infected MRC-5 cells were treated with 5 M TET, FAN, and CEP (Vehicle 0.025% DMSO) the culture supernatant and cell lysates were harvested at designated times. cell viability was assessed using the MTS assay at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days post-infection (B and C) HCoV-OC43 infection induced the expression of IFN-related antiviral genes in MRC-5 cell lysates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 dpi. mxA mRNA expression was increased by compound treatment at one dpi compared with virus-infected MRC-5 cells without compound treatment. mxA levels following compound treatment were lower than those of the vehicle control. TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12p70 were not detected in the MRC-5 cell culture supernatant following compound treatment. however, treatment with the compounds did not induce MRC-5 to produce the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. TET promoted the P38 Phosphorylation of MAPK in HCoV-OC43-infected MRC-5 cells. p38 phosphorylation peaked at 30 min post-infection and then slowly decreased at 60 and 90 min. p38 MAPK signaling pathway is activated by TET in MRC-5 cells. increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by TET treatment in MRC-5 cells with no antiviral synergistic effect of TET and anisomycin. p38 phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was infected with HCoV-OC43. the genome of HCoV-OC43 encodes some well-conserved motifs shared with SARS-CoV. this suggests that HCoV-OC43 could be an alternative model for the study of emerging HCoVs. the results of the present study demonstrated that TET, FAN, and CEP are potentially strong natural antiviral agents for the treatment of HCoV infection. pretreatment with the compounds increased cell survival rates against virus infection. pretreatment with the compounds increased cell survival rates against virus infection. of particular interest, only 3 h of pre-exposure to TET and FAN fully protected against virus-induced cell death. HCoV-OC43 infection induced a significant increase in the mRNA level of SIAE in MRC-5 cells at four dpi as a virus-induced host response. however, SIAE mRNA levels were lowered by treatment with TET, FAN, and CEP. IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 levels were increased in MRC-5 cells by HCoV-OC43 infection. the production of inflammatory cytokines was not affected by the compound treatment dose. a recent study reported that TET activates the MAPK signaling pathway. TET, FAN, and CEP significantly inhibited virus-induced cell death with no apparent cytotoxicity at the effective doses. treatment with TET, FAN, and CEP dramatically suppressed the replication of HCoV-OC43 in the supernatants and lysates of MRC-5 cells."}
