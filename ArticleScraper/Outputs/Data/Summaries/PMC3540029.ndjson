{"summary": "adeno-associated virus vectors based on serotype (AAV) 2 have shown great promise for therapeutic gene transfer when targeted to immune-privileged sites [1], [2], [3], [5], but their efficacy has been modest when targeted to other tissues such as during hepatic gene transfer. this suggests that cell-specific barriers affect the transduction potential of these vectors. this suggests that cell-specific barriers affect the transduction potential of these vectors. the ER is the organelle where proteins are modified and folded into native conformations. the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER causes stress and leads to activation of a coordinated adaptive program called the unfolded protein response (UPR) the process is initiated by activation of three sensor molecules namely, protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (ER kinase) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). IRE1 is activated by trans-autophosphorylation, its endoribonuclease domain cleaves a 26 nucleotide intron from its target XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) mRNA, thus performing an unconventional splicing. NF-B is a major transcription factor activated in response to UPR signalling that results in immune clearance of the hepatitis B (HbX) and hepatitis C (NS4) viral the concept of capsid protein dependent immunotoxicity is well documented [5], [34] and several groups have shown that cellular cytoplasmic surveillance mechanisms such as the NF-B signalling [35], MYD88 pathway or toll-like receptor (TLR-9) [36], [37] influence this process. we hypothesize that AAV2 infection induces ER stress and activates cellular UPR. lF2 (119A11), BiP (C50B12), beta-actin (8H10D10) and the anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidise conjugated IgG secondary antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology\u00ae, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA) ER stress inducing agents tunicamycin and metformin were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) while dithiothreitol (DTT) was procure the vectors were finally concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using Amicon Ultra 10 K centrifugal filters. physical particle titers of recombinant AAV2 stocks were determined by quantitative DNA slot blot analysis. a pool of small-interfering (si) RNAs against PERK and IRE1 was used. cells were transfected with 100 nM of test siRNA or scrambled siRNA. forty-eight hours post siRNA or mock transfection, cells were infected. scAAV2 and scAAV2+metformin groups were injected with 11011 vg of scAAV2- EGFP vectors per animal in a 200 l suspension via the tail vein. twenty-four hours later mice were euthanized and liver samples were collected for further molecular or biochemical analysis. 1 l of cDNA was amplified for 6 UPR pathway genes (PERK/BiP/CHOP/ATF6/IRE1/ATF4) using primers described in table 1. PCR condition was set at 95\u00b0C for 15 mins, 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 secs and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. RT-PCR to Identify XBP1 Splice Variants Total RNA isolated at 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h was reverse transcribed as described above. cells treated with DTT for 5 h were used as positive control. cDNA was profiled by the mouse inflammatory cytokines & receptors profiler array (Qiagen, SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA) the data was acquired using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies, Applied Biosystems, Applied Biosystems) scAAV2 in triplicates for each condition at different time points (2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h.p.i) were also collected. the protein extracts were boiled for 5 min. under reducing conditions. the mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbour, ME, USA) all animal experiments were approved and carried out according to the Institutional guidelines for animal care (Christian Medical College, Vellore, India) 80% of cells were transfected with AAV2 or AAV2 or AAV6 rep-cap, transgene (ss or ds AAV2-EGFP) and AAV-helper free (p.helper) plasmids. cells were lysed and treated with 25 units/ml of benzonase nuclease. AV2 or scAAV2 or scAAV2 or scAAV1 or scAAV6 vectors were harvested for different assays described below. images from five visual fields of mock-infected and vector-infected cells were analyzed quantitatively by ImageJ analysis software. bled siRNA using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) twenty-four hours post siRNA or mock transfection, cells were infected with scAAV2-EGFP. forty-eight hours post-transduction, the expression was measured by fluorescence microscopy. +metformin groups were injected with 11011 vg of scAAV2- EGFP vectors per animal in a 200 l suspension via the tail vein. liver lobes from all these animals were collected and analysed for EGFP expression. the relative gene expression between mock-infected and AAV infected cells was measured by the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method. values >2 fold were considered as differentially regulated between the groups. l of the cDNA was amplified using primers described in table 2. cDNA was profiled by the mouse inflammatory cytokines & receptors profiler array. cDNA was profiled by the mouse inflammatory cytokines & receptors profiler array. fold-change values greater than one indicate a positive- or an up-regulation, while values less than 1 represent down-regulation of test genes. lysates from ssAAV2 and scAAV2 in triplicates were also collected. the immuno-reactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL-Plus, GE healthcare, WI, USA) the experiment was repeated independently. the average band intensities (+/ SE) were then plotted and generated in Microsoft Excel 2007 version. western blot analysis showed a similar increase in UPR pathway proteins in scAAV2 treated cells between 12\u201348 h.p.i. PERK (9 fold) or IRE1 (11 fold) were up-regulated against scAAV2. this activation was less prominent against ssAAV2 vectors. gene (EGFP) product as HeLa cells transfected with dsAAV-EGFP plasmids did not activate this ER stress response. the protein levels of PERK, phosphorylated-elF2, IRE1 and BiP at different time points after single stranded AAV2 (F\u2013J) infection. data is mean +/ S.E from two independent experiments done with protein lysates pooled from triplicate conditions of mock- or AAV infection. IRE1 oligomerizes and generates sXBP1 on conditions of ER stress. total RNA from HeLa cells mock-infected or infected with of 5,000 vgs/cell of scAAV2-CB-EGFP vectors. scAAV6 vectors up regulated distinct arms of UPR. scAAV6 vectors up regulated distinct arms of UPR. scAAV6 vectors were infected with 5,000 vgs/cell of scAAV1- EGFP or scAAV6-EGFP vectors. expression level of PERK, ATF6, IRE1 and CHOP from cells treated with AAV6 was assessed. scAAV2 and IRE1 pathways have a modest effect on scAAV2. western blot analysis of cellular extracts from cells transduced with scrambled siRNA showed marked depletion of PERK and IRE1 protein levels. knockdown of PERK pathway alone seems to have only a negligible effect on AAV mediated gene expression. scAAV2 upregulates UPR Genes after Hepatic Gene Transfer in vivo. mice were mock-injected or injected with scAAV2 vectors alone or with metformin. hepatic gene transfer of AAV2 vectors induces ER stress. hepatic mRNA was assayed for the levels of PERK (A) or IRE1 (B) genes by real time PCR. mice treated with metformin were used as mock control. motif ligand 13 (CXCL13), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 15 (CXCL15) and chemokine C-C motif receptor 2 (Ccr2) were significantly suppressed by UPR inhibition. most of these molecules are inflammatory mediators known to attract monocytes and lymphocytes to target tissue. scAAV2 vectors Activate the Host Cellular UPR signaling pathways in vitro. scAAV2 vectors were mock-infected or infected with ssAAV2 or scAAV2 vectors at an equal MOI (5103 vgs/cell) total RNA was extracted at different time-points. h.p.i (2.6 fold) declining at 48 h.p.i (2.4 fold) while PERK itself was up regulated at 48 h.p.i. a similar increase (1.4 to 2.0 fold) was seen for IRE1 protein between 2 h.p.i to 48 h.p.i. but a less prominent increase was seen with ssAAV2 vectors. total RNA was isolated and the transcript levels of the UPR pathway genes were measured by real-time PCR. a fold variation in UPR target genes (BiP, PERK, IRE1 and ATF6) expression in cells infected with single-stranded AAV2 at different time points. RT-PCR analysis of XBP1 splicing at different time points showed peak levels of sXBP1 transcripts at 12 h.p.i. a similar wave-like induction of the UPR pathway has been noted for other viruses such as HCV. spliced variant sXBP1 (257 bp) at various time points, 2 h (lane 1), 6 h (lane 2), Molecular weight ladder (lane 3), 12 h (lane 4), 24 h (lane 5) and 48 h (lane 6) analyzed. serotypes other than AAV2 can also modulate UPR signalling pathways in vitro. scAAV1- EGFP or scAAV6-EGFP vectors were infected with 5,000 vgs/cell. expression level of PERK, ATF6, IRE1 and CHOP from cells treated with AAV1 and AAV6 was assessed. the knockdown of either of these pathways alone had a similar effect. PERK inhibition cannot completely reverse the protein synthesis block induced by AAV vectors in the transduced cells. a. transgene expression was measured in HeLa cells 48 hrs post-infection with self-complementary AAV2-EGFP or AAV6-EFGP vectors. ire1 and PERK genes were significantly elevated (2.5\u20133.5 fold) in mice livers that received scAAV2 vectors at a dose of 11011 vg/animal. this increased UPR gene expression was comparable to data from mice that received tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer and a UPR activator. the role of IRE1 as an activator of NF-B dependent innate immune response is known [46]. blocking UPR signalling may also dampen the innate immune response against AAV vectors. we compared the expression of various inflammatory/chemokine genes in mice receiving scAAV2 vectors alone. hepatic gene expression of various inflammatory cytokines in the scAAV2 injected mice was measured 24 hours post vector administration. pharmacological inhibition of UPR increases self-complementary AAV2 mediated transgene expression in vivo. scAAV vectors activate distinct UPR signalling pathways during endosomal trafficking. this allows substantial release of scAAV genomes during endosomal trafficking. the ultimate effect of UPR is a paradox where it can restore cellular homeostasis or lead to cell death via apoptosis. an identical scAAV genome packaged in either of AAV1 or AAV2 or AAV6 capsids can activate different UPR signalling pathways. these capsids are processed differentially during their intra-cellular trafficking, leading to various degrees of their genome exposure or capsid degradation. further studies are needed to confirm this phenomenon. our previous studies have documented that recombinant AAV vectors activate the classical NF-B pathway during their cytosolic entry in the acute phase of AAV infection (2 hrs) several of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1, IL6), TNF, IL12, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were upregulated during the course of UPR induction to scAAV2 vectors."}
