{"summary": "intestinal paneth cells produce microbicidal peptides, such as -defensin. paneth cells differentiate while migrating towards the crypt base. enterocytes sense pathogenic bacteria, occupy the Toll-like receptors. immune cells signal through adapter molecule MyD88 to interleukin (IL)-1-receptor-associated kinase. Deficiency in MyD88 increases susceptibility to bowel inflammation. AP is involved in maintenance of homeostasis between the luminal bacterial microbiotica and the body. the NSAID diclofenac may induce enteropathy by way of the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. stress-related changes in intestinal barrier and secretory function have therapeutic implications. the ISCs produce progenitor cells, which form enterocytes, goblet cells, enterochromaffin cells, and Paneth cells. the ISCs are of two types: the fast cycling \u201ccrypt base columnar\u201d cells residing among the Paneth cells at the base of the crypt, and the slow cycling ISCs above the Paneth cells (+4ISC) in the developing intestine, the relationships between Wnt signaling, epithelial proliferation, and tissue differentiation are reversed. the intestinal epithelium is renewed through a series of programmed developmental transitions in the form and function of the intestine. fMLP induces expression of HSPs and inhibits activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-B. hydrocortisone reduces the cholera toxin-induced secretory response observed in fetal human small intestinal epithelial T84 cells. gon-like peptide (GLP)-2 has trophic effect on the intestine and enhances nutrient absorption. in young animals, there is malabsorption of several lipids with GLP-2 or GLP-2 plus dexamethasone, but not with dexamethasone itself. premature human neonate has higher fasting levels of GLP-1 and GLP-2 compared to adults. homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium is a dynamic process created by a balance between proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. polyamines are involved in stimulation of intestinal epithelial cell migration during restitution. phospholipase C (PLC)-1 modulates calcium store mobilization and calcium influx. glutamine is an amino acid that is the preferred fuel source for enterocytes. it activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and inhibits phosphorylated Akt. phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibits phosphorylated Akt, suggesting that ERK has an important role in the glutamine-mediated intestinal homeostasis. the commitment of crypt stem cells to differentiate into enterocytes reduces the differentiation of these secretory cells. notch, Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways are involved in epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. PPAR acts on Paneth cell homeostasis by downregulating expression of Ihh. in is a calcium-dependent serine proteinase which processes many proteins such as BMP-4, the insulin receptor, the Notch1 receptor, and the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin. keratinocyte growth factor-1 cooperates with CDX2 and regulates transcription of SI, LPH, claudin-2, calbindin 3 and liver Fabp1 gene[37]. intestinal mucosa in constantly being deformed by peristalsis, movement of the villi, and passage of chyme along the surface of the intestine. this strain stimulates the migration of epithelial cells across fibronectin [such as Scn, focal adhesion kinase (ERKs)][41]. INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY The intestinal BBM of enterocytes constitutes the small intestinal epithelial barrier. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is induced in the process by which enterocytes lose their interactions with the basal lamina. this leads to anoikis, a form of apoptosis caused by the loss of cell anchorage. MCs in the lamina propria contain both preformed bioactive mediators. sulfasalazine uptake across the BBM is adequate, but sulfasalazine may be transported out of the enterocytes by MRP2 and BCRP. stressful events will increase intestinal permeability to macromolecules, deplete intestinal mucus, and alter interaction of bacteria in the intestinal lumen with the intestinal epithelial cells. stress may even lead to inflammation, bacterial invasion of the mucosa, as well as T-cell activ a jejunal segment in persons with low vs moderate background stress results in an increase in chloride-related peak secretory response, as well as enhanced permeability to albumin[53]. PPAR ligands may reduce the degree of TJ permeability, thus reducing the degree of leakiness. ADrenomedullin (AM) is a 52-amino-acid peptide formed in the mucosa. AM increases cAMP, activates protein kinase (PK)A, and stabilizes the barrier function of the intestine. systemic EGF prevents peritonitis-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. a meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials of Saccharomyces boulardii has shown moderate effectiveness in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children and adults. S. boulardii reduced the risk of AAD from 17% to 7%, with the number needed to treat to prevent one case of AAD being only 10[62] giardia lamblia infection increases intestinal permeability due to downregulation of TJ occludin 1, reduced sodium-dependant glucose absorption, increased epithelial apoptosis and increased active electrogenic anion secretion. iNOS is constitutively expressed by the intestinal villous cells. ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid for 3 d), levofloxacin (500 mg qid for 3 d), rifaximin (200 mg qid for 3 d) and azithromycin (1000 mg, single dose) should be taken in conjunction with an antidiarrheal agent[75]. loperamide should be added to fluroquinolone, rifaximin, and azithromycin. Immature human enterocytes, DRF1, play a role in clathrin-mediated CT trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. ARF6 enhances Gs activation by CT[82]. Stx is taken up by microendocytosis in cells that lack the Stx1 receptor, mediated by Gc3 on the BBM. the etiological agent of Whipple\u2019s disease (WD) is Tropheryma whipplei, a PAS-positive, rod-shaped actinomycete. there is no correlation between T. whipplei genotypes and clinical manifestations. a 33-year-old woman with HIV enteropathy was described with structural changes in the duodenal mucosa, regressing after triple antiviral therapy. the intestinal immune system is central to the pathogenesis of AIDS, with the progression of AIDS due to a decrease in the expression of genes that maintain the mucosal barrier. rDNA (16S rDNA) has been extracted from the duodenal biopsy. it was thought to be due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia[93]. such techniques may be used for the diagnosis of chronic infections. the total microbial population within the GI tract exceeds the total number of mammalian cells by at least an order of magnitude. the intestinal mucosa downregulates proinflammatory signaling pathways, expresses antimicrobial proteins, and initiates epithelial repair after mucosal injury. anti-glycosyl antibodies are induced by a glycosyl antigen. probiotic therapy has been used for traveler\u2019s diarrhea, to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and to prevent relapse of pouchitis. lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is a probiotic bacteria that prevents cytokine-induced apoptosis by way of two LGG-produced viable proteins p75 and p40. a therapeutic approach to enteric infections is to express molecular mimics of toxin receptors on the surface of harmless bacteria. a therapeutic approach to enteric infections is to express molecular mimics of toxin receptors on the surface of harmless bacteria, so that the toxin binds to the bacterium rather than to its natural target, the intestinal mucosa. inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is constitutively expressed by the intestinal villous cells. after acute injury of the intestinal epithelium rapidly induces iNOS. the induction of iNOS in response to neonatal piglet Cryptosporidium parvum is a nonspecific response. vibrio cholerae secretes CT, which binds to mucosal enterochromaffin cells. small GTP-binding proteins increase the CT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs. there is increased susceptibility of neonates to infectious diarrhea. rotavirus-induced diarrhea can be prevented by use of a live-attenuated vaccine[85] following acute mucosal injury such as from rotavirus infection, there is enterocyte migration that is proliferation-independent. this restitution or migration of cells requires NO, PGs and polyamines. a woman with HIV enteropathy was described with structural changes in the duodenal mucosa, regressing after triple antiviral therapy. the intestinal immune system is central to the pathogenesis of AIDS (transmission, viral complication, CD4+ T-cell destruction) opportunistic infections can still occur in HIV-positive persons taking HAART. bacterial rDNA (16S rDNA) was extracted from the duodenal biopsy. enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is a leading cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries. seudomonas aeruginosa are associated with a high fatality rate. virulence circuitry activates adenosine to inosine. malnutrition may be associated with prolonged episodes of EPEC infection. lipid rafts are cholesterol-sphingolipid-rich microdomains in enterocyte lipid rafts. interferon inhibits enterocyte migration by displacing Cx43 from these lipid rafts in enterocytes. anti-glycosyl antibodies act as competitors to pathogens. SIBO may recur after it has been successfully treated with appropriate antibiotics. the recurrence rates are about 13% at 3 mo, 28% at 6 mo and 44% at 9 mo[106]. the absorbable antibiotic metronidazole is more effective than the nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin. Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) is the principal exchanger isoform responsible for transepithelial Na+ absorption at the BBM of the intestinal epithelium. phosphorylation of NHE by PKA alters the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NHE3 thereby reducing Na+ absorption. bacillus acidophilus prevents enteroinvasive disruption of the BBM barrier in Caco 2 cells. glycerophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a glycerophospholipid present in abundance in foods such as soybeans and egg yolk. LPA acts through these receptors to inhibit the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-dependent Cl- channel. there are 11 secretory-associated genes, including the vesicle docking inhibitor STXBP3, which may be upregulated in response to luminal glutamine or bile acids. antisense knockdown reduces serotonin secretion, whereas antisense knockdown reduces serotonin secretion. the acute regulation involves changes in both functional activity and membrane trafficking. glucocorticoid and ticoid hormones act through transcriptional induction of - and -ENaC subunits. in macroscopically noninflamed colon, there is impaired ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption, which contributes to the diarrhea arising from the inflamed mucosa. ENaCs in the distal colon are upregulated in order to absorb more Na+/water. glucocorticoids act through p38 MAPK to enhance the transcription of the B- and J- subunits of ENaCs. when DRA is eliminated, there is an approximately 50% reduction of basal and cAMP-stimulated HCO3- secretion. the duodenal and ileal breaks slow the passage of chyme along the intestine. this helps to prevent exceeding the approximately 2-L composition of the colon to absorb water. the small bowel water content initially falls, and then rises after a meal of liquids and solids. human intestinal smooth muscle cells and ICCs express SCN5 (gene encoded Na+ channel, expressed in interstitial cells) there may be an association between genetic defects in SCN5A and GI symptoms. bile acid was presumed to be the cause of diarrhea in 81% of patients. studies determining fractional synthetic rate of MUC2 in human neonates have shown rapid incorporation of systemic threonine into MUC2[134]. premature infants are at increased risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) restitution is regulated in part by the Rho family of small-molecular-weight GTPases. NO inhibits enterocyte migration through protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2). this restitution is decreased in hemorrhagic shock, sepsis, intestinal ischemia and NEC. TLRs on the intestinal BBM are PRRs that identify components of the usual intestinal microbiotica. the TLR changes occur before the histological changes, suggesting that the activator of the inflammatory response through TLRs may be causative in the development of NEC. the bacterial ligand activated TLRs signal intracellularly to upregulate both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. there are several genes induced in the inflammatory process such as cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damages mucosal cell layer and villous structure. hypoxia-inducible-factor-12-dependent repression of ENT2 increases adenosine signaling. reactions to food allergies are common, and true food allergies are believed to affect about 7% of children under the age of 10 years. the intestinal immune system includes Peyer\u2019s patches, isolated lymphoid follicles, mesentery lymph nodes, lamina propria mononuclear cells, and intraepithelial lymphocytes. the human intestine has unique natural killer cells derived from hemopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. the gut immune system is poorly responsive to food allergens and commensal bacteria. the Th2 phenotype is involved in developing of allergic disease through release of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. IL-4 is the key Th2 cytokine involved in switching antibody responses to IgE. T lymphocytes are an important determinant of visceral nociception. disruption of the enteric glial cell network is associated with intestinal and mesenteric T-cell infiltration, leading to Th1 cytokine-associated bowel inflammation. vagus nerve regulates GI motor and digestive functions through release of acetylcholine (ACh) this parasympathetic neurotransmitter activates mAChRs, the nicotinic ACh receptors. this reduces proinflammatory cytokine secretion by macrophages."}
