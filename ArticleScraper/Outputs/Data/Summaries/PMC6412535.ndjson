{"summary": "Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is initiated by a ligand binding the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), followed by adaptor proteins, such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and son of sevenless (SOS) Raf then activates downstream MEK1/2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) Ras activates the Raf kinase, which phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MEK1/2), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p90RSK. the protein was purified and renamed p90RSK based on its approximately 90 kDa weight. the NTKD is part of the kinase A, G and C (AGC) family. the CTKD is part of the calcium calmodulin dependent kinase (CaMK) family. the function of the CTKD is to receive signals from ERK 1/2 to auto-phosphorylate RSK. p38 MAPK and fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) have been shown to influence RSK regulation. p38 MAPK has been shown to activate RSK in dendritic cells via MAPK-activated kinases M2 and M3, which activate CTKD. p38 MAPK has been shown to activate RSK in dendritic cells via MAPK-activated kinases M2 and M3, which activate CTKD [18] p90RSK has been shown to influence inflammation transcription through phosphorylating nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) inhibitors. p90RSK also phosphorylates downstream substrates filamin A and phosphorylating SH3 domain-containing protein (SH3P2) to induce cell motility and migration. the structure of RSKs is noteworthy because all the members contain two functionally diverse domains called the N terminal kinase domain (NTKD) and the C terminal kinase domain (CTKD) the function of the CTKD is to receive signals from ERK 1/2 to auto-phosphorylate RSK. ser363 is activated by ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, while Ser380 is phosphorylated by CTKD. p38 MAPK and fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) have been shown to influence RSK regulation. both p90RSK (i.e., RSK1) and RSK2 have been shown to promote cell proliferation and growth. p90RSK has been shown to influence inflammation transcription through phosphorylating nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) inhibitors. p90RSK also phosphorylates downstream substrates filamin A and phosphorylating SH3 domain-containing protein (SH3P2) to induce cell motility and migration. p90RSK is predominantly expressed in the kidney [1,3], suggesting that p90RSK may play a unique role in the pathogenesis of kidney diseases. phosphorylation of p90RSK and its upstream signalling such as ERK1/2 is markedly induced after obstructive injury. p90RSK may involve in the initiation and progression of chronic kidney disease and renal fibrosis. p90RSK activation induces fibroblast accumulation through p90RSK/Bad/cytochrome C pathway. macrophages (M1) produce abundant proinflammatory cytokines. p90RSK protects macrophage against apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). p90RSK promotes survival and accumulation of macrophages, especially the M1 macrophages, which produce a panoply of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. p90RSK and Glomerular Diseases Proteinuria is one of the common manifestations of glomerular diseases. p90RSK mediates protective effect of R568 through activating the pro-survival signalling of Bad and Bcl-xl and reducing PAN-induced podocyte apoptosis and damage. p90RSK and Diabetic Nephropathy is one of leading causes of end stage renal disease. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) infection induces p38 MAPK-mediated Ser380 phosphorylation of p90RSK but not through ERK1/2-induced Thr573 phosphorylation in kidney epithelial cells. surviving epithelial cells de-differentiate, migrate to the injury site, proliferate and then re-differentiate to establish epithelial polarity and restore kidney function. the number of interstitial fibroblasts and myofibroblasts closely correlate with the severity of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and concomitant decline of kidney function. tPA binds to its receptor LRP-1 and induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, which activates the downstream ERK1/2 and p90RSK pathways. the activation and phosphorylation of p90RSK then phosphorylates the downstream substrates, such as macrophages are differentiated into two categories: M1 as classically activated and M2 as alternatively activated. p90RSK, phosphorylated by tPA, protects macrophages against apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or staurosporine through activating a novel downstream p38 MAPK pathway. calcimimetic R-568 induces p90RSK/CREB signalling cascade, alleviates PAN-induced proteinuria, attenuates glomerulosclerosis and improves glomerular filtration rate. p90RSK mediates protective effect of R568 through activating the pro-survival signalling of Bad and Bcl-xl and reducing PAN-induced podocyte apoptosis and damage. p90RSK induces phosphorylation and inactivation of eEF2 kinase. eEF2 activation eventually induces protein synthesis and causes mesangial hypertrophy. p90RSK is implied in the motility response of kidney epithelial cells. p90RSK and Atherosclerosis Endothelial cells (ECs) are the single layer mesenchymal cells lining in the inner surface of blood vessels, lymphatics and other mesothelial-lined cavities. ECs can sense and respond to the shear stress of blood flow, produce vasoactive factors, such as vasodilators and vasoconstrictors, procoagulants and anticoagulants, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. p90RSK activation-mediated nuclear export of SENP2 increases nuclear ERK5 and p53 SUMOylation, leading to EC apoptosis, inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque formation. ionizing radiation induces p90RSK activation in ECs. p90RSK in macrophages also induces the expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as TNF and decreases the expression of efferocytosis-related genes. these results were validated in vivo using two different transgenic mouse models of atherosclerosis. p90RSK activated by PGE2 in neonatal ventricular myocytes induces expression of c-Fos, Egr-1 and BNP, leading to myocytes growth and probably cardiac hypertrophy. p90RSK activation mediates the cardioprotective effect of protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) in rat hearts ischemia/reperfusion. activated p90RSK in diabetic hearts induces the phosphorylation of ERK5 S496, inhibits the association of ERK5 and CHIP ubiquitin ligase by binding to ERK5. this decreases the cAMP early repressor (ICER) ubiquitination and degradation and finally promotes cardiac apoptosis. ECs express increased cell adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecular-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin. disturbed-flow (d-flow) is a known risk factor of atherosclerosis. p90RSK activation-mediated nuclear export of SENP2 increases nuclear ERK5 and p53 SUMOylation. ionizing radiation induces p90RSK activation in ECs. p90RSK increases NF-B activation, VCAM-1 expression and EC apoptosis. p90RSK is activated by various combination antiretroviral therapies. p90RSK is a key player in regulating the formation and progression of atherosclerotic lesion through modulating efferocytosis, inflammation, antioxidant expression and senescence in monocytes and macrophages. p90RSK mediates ROS and protein kinase C-induced cardiac troponin I phosphorylation. p90RSK activation mediates the cardioprotective effect of protease activated receptor 2 (PAR2) in rat heart ischemia/reperfusion model. itoh and colleagues studied role of p90RSK in ischemic and diabetic myocardium using transgenic mice. as fast transient outward K+ current (I(to,f)), slow delayed outward K+ current (I(K,slow)) and steady-state K+ current (I(SS)) in ventricular myocytes, prolongs the QT-interval and thus plays an important role in cardiac arrhythmia. p90RSK regulates numerous cell processes including cell growth, proliferation, survival and motility. RSK1 and 2 play an important role in the chemoresistance that makes tumours more difficult to cure. RSK inhibition sensitizes melanoma cells to DNA-damaging agents by increasing Chk1 activity. SL0101 is isolated from the tropical plant forsteronia refracta. application of SL0101 is limited because of its poor in vivo efficacy. a new SL0101 analogue, SL0101 (1b), specifically inhibits RSK1 and 2 in vitro. p90RSK inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetes-mediated atherosclerosis. BIX02565 is another confirmed inhibitor for RSK, at least RSK2. p90RSK and other RSKs mediate various signal pathways."}
