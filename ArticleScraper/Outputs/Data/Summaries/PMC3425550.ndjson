{"summary": "DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) induced low levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 and NF-B activation. this led to reduced production of IFN- in the early phase of infection. however, DENV-2 infection repressed cytokine production triggered by TLR signaling. more than 170 different virus-encoded IFN antagonists from 93 distinct viruses have been described. hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of Flaviviridae, evades innate immunity by cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. two flaviviruses trigger type I IFN transcription through an RIG-I-dependent signaling cascade to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and NF-B. however, JEV induced higher activation of IRF3 and NF-B than DENV-2 in human DCs [13], [14]. we studied the influence of DENV-2 infection on activation of NF-B and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) such as HCV NS5B, SARS CoV M protein, measles virus V protein, and enterovirus 71 2C, inhibit NF-B activation directly or indirectly [20], [21], [22], [23]. BMDCs were generated by culturing bone-marrow hematopoietic cells with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) for 8 days. 106 DCs were adsorbed with DENV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 1 h. for stimulation with TLR ligands, cells were incubated with complete medium. qPCR primers for TLRs are listed in Table S1. NF-B p65 subcellular location was determined by immunostaining with rabbit anti-NF-B p65, then Alexa Fluor-568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. cells cultured in 12-well plate were transfected with NF-B- or IFN--Luc reporter plasmids. pRL-TK (Promega), encoding Renilla luciferase under an HSV thymidine kinase promoter, was used as an internal control. BMDCs were generated by culturing bone-marrow hematopoietic cells with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) for 8 days. 106 DCs were adsorbed with DENV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. qPCR amplification was done with 4 ng cDNA in 10 l SYBR Green PCR master mix. transcript levels were normalized to that of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase. immunofluorescence assay Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. after 2 washes with PBS, cells were blocked with 10% skim milk in PBS. deNV-2 NS3 was detected by a specific monoclonal antibody against NS3. immunoblot analysis Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) harvested cell extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. images were acquired by a digital image system (UVP or Fujifilm) DENV-2 replication peaked around 12\u201324 h post infection. infection with DENV-2 inefficiently triggered type I IFN expression. weak induction of DENV-2 implies that DENV-2 may interfere with a common signaling pathway for inducing type I IFN and other inflammatory cytokines. deNV-2-infected BMDCs were immunofluorescently stained with anti-DENV-2 NS3 antibody (green fluorescence, a\u2013f). DAPI staining indicates the location of cell nucleus (blue fluorescence, g\u2013l). qPCR analysis of mRNA expression of IFN- and IL-10 on cells coincubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/ml) (A) or polyI:C (100 g/ml) (B) for the indicated times. normalization was done with the expression level of internal control HPRT. the virus was replicating in A549 cells and was not affected by LPS and polyI:C posttreatment. deNV-2 infection blocked LPS-triggered NF-B activation in Vero cells. similar results were observed in J774A.1 macrophages. cells lysates collected from cells as described in panel A were subjected for immunoblotting assay to detect the expression of DENV-2 NS3 and actin. NF-B p65 nuclear translocation triggered by LPS is blocked by DENV-2 infection. phosphorylation and even impaired the basal level of p-ERK1/2. DENV blocks TLR-mediated ERK activation to modulate both arms of the innate immunity response to infection: type I IFN and cytokines. IL-10 (77-fold at 12 h by polyI:C and 74-fold at 36 h by CpG) levels of IFN- and these cytokines were much lower in cells with DENV-2 infection. deNV-2 replication peaked around 12\u201324 h post infection, in consistence with cytokine induction peaked around 12\u201336 h post infection. mRNA levels of IFN- (A), IL-10 (B), IL-12p40 (C), TNF (D) and DENV-2 viral 5\u2032 UTR RNA (E) normalized to the internal control HPRT. data for DENV-2-induced cytokine expression is magnified at the right of each panel. BMDCs were mock-infected or infected with DENV-2 (MOI 5) for 24 h before stimulation. qPCR analysis of mRNA expression of IFN- and IL-10 was analyzed at the indicated times. 13% of PL046- and NGC-infected cells showed nuclear staining of NF-B p65. 80% of the control virus infected cells showed nuclear staining of NF-B p65. we also tested the influence of TLR singling in DENV-2 replication. NF-B activation triggered by LPS and polyI:C is suppressed by DENV-2 infection. cells lysates collected from cells as described in panel A were subjected for immunoblotting assay. DENV-2 infection was monitored by IFA with anti-DENV-2 NS3 antibody (green fluorescence) the cell nuclei were counter stained by DAPI (blue fluorescence) the activity of ERK is associated with the expression of type I IFN and cytokines, particularly IL-10 [31], [32], [33] IL-10, IL-12, and TNF were induced to a lower extent in DENV-2-infected BMDCs. IL-10 is a potent immunosuppressor produced by several immune cells. IL-10 is critical in suppressing excessive inflammation and immunopathologic conditions. rhesus macaques showed no transcription of IL-10 or other cytokine genes. the high IL-10 expression found in patients with dengue-related diseases might not be stimulated by the DENV itself. deNV infection through the ADE route often induces IL-10 expression, which worsens the host anti-viral system. we also found that polyI:C-triggered TLR4, TLR5 and TLR13 expression was significantly downregulated by DENV-2. however, DENV-2 enhanced the gene expression of TLR1 and TLR3 triggered by polyI:C stimulation. other possibilities, such as whether DENV protease, found to block IFN- promoter activation [13], remain to be further studied. ARA6894-infected DCs triggered CD4+ Th1 polarization with high expression of IFN and TNF. the polyprotein sequences of strain ARA6894 contain nonsynonymous amino acids that are not present in other DENV-2 strains. the balance between the protective and pathological immune responses likely contributes to the DENV infection outcomes.
