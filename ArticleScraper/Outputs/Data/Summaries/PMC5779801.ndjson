{"summary": "the health protection agency undertook a scientific evidence-based review of the use of masks and respirators in an influenza pandemic. the review was published online at: http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_125425.pdf. study selection We included the following types of studies listed in the hierarchical order of study design quality. randomised controlled trials (i.e. randomised crossover trial and cluster randomised trial); quasiexperimental studies (i.e. nonrandomised controlled study, beforeandafter study and interrupted time series); and observational studies (cohort study and case\u2013control study) only human studies published in English which had an abstract were included. EC and AN independently reviewed the abstracts for the remaining papers. subsequently reviewed all of the papers, supplemented FbR\u2019s and VLC\u2019s initial abstraction as necessary. randomised controlled study, beforeandafter study and interrupted time series) and observational studies (cohort study and case\u2013control study) only human studies published in English which had an abstract were included. results The three separate database searches yielded a total of 6015 titles. five articles were identified by scanning the reference lists of review articles. of these, 17 studies were eligible for inclusion. no difference in influenza infection: 50 (236%) of 212 in mask group versus 48 (229%) of 210 in N95 group. limited audit found high compliance. Hard to generalise findings given lack of control arm. index cases and contacts asked to wear masks as often as possible at home during 7day followup period. no difference in laboratoryconfirmed secondary attack ratios in controls 10% (95% CI 6\u201314), hand hygiene 5% (95% CI 3\u20139) and mask plus hand hygiene groups 7% (95% CI 4\u201311); P = 022. no difference in respiratory virus isolation rates in controls 3 (30%) of 100; in surgical mask group 6 (64%) of 94; in surgical mask group 6 (64%) of 94 (RR 213, 95% CI 055\u2013826, P = 032); in P2 respirator group 8 (87%) of 92 (RR 290, 95% CI 079\u2013106, P = 012) hand sanitiser group more likely to report no symptomatic HH members (545/946 [576%] compared with education (447/904 [494%] and hand sanitiser/mask (363/938 [387%] groups, P 001. participants wore the mask/respirator on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks. intentiontotreat analysis adjusted for clustering of hospitals found only nonfittested N95s protective against CRI and laboratoryconfirmed infection. gG positive HCWs compared with 657 negative HCWs who cared for SARS patients. doublelayer cotton mask (versus a singlelayer cotton mask) protective against SARS infection in univariate analysis. possible recall bias as questionnaire survey conducted 4 months after outbreak. use of masks (OR 01, 95% CI 00\u201303) and gowns (P = 0010, OR and CI not calculable) associated with noninfection for doctors and nurses. possible recall bias; exposures imprecisely quantified; no serological testing of controls. multivariate analyses found using mask frequently in public places 279% of 330 cases versus 587% of 660 controls recruited by random telephone survey matched for age, sex and reference time for behaviours. likely misclassification because no laboratory testing for most cases and no testing of controls. 3 (13%) of 23 nurses who consistently wore mask developed SARS compared with 5 (56%) of 9 nurses who did not consistently wear either. 2 (13%) of 16 nurses who consistently wore surgical mask developed SARS compared with 1 (25%) of 4 nurses who consistently wore a surgical mask. despite poor compliance, mask wearing coupled with hand sanitiser use, reduced secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection/influenzalike illness compared with education. hand sanitiser alone resulted in no reduction in aggregated outcome. a retrospective cohort study of nurses who worked in two Toronto hospital intensive care units found that the relative risk of SARS for nurses who consistently wore a surgical mask was half that for nurses who consistently wore a surgical mask. one study found a lower rate of clinical respiratory illness associated with the use of nonfittested N95 respirators compared with medical masks. a trial conducted amongst resident university students detected significant reductions in influenzalike illness during weeks 4\u20136 in the mask and hand hygiene group. the requirements for mask/respirator wearing and subsequent compliance varied by study. the authors of a randomised trial of mask plus alcohol-based sanitiser and maskonly group amongst university students living in residence halls noted that their study may have been better positioned to identify a protective effect because participants initiated the interventions at the beginning of the influenza season. the difficulties in interpreting the observational studies of SARS suggest that they are of limited use for guiding policy on influenza. the review's findings are inextricably linked to what is known about how influenza is spread and specific risk factors that can affect transmissibility. there are limited and conflicting evidence regarding the relative importance and frequency of direct contact, indirect contact, droplet and aerosol modes of transmission. in the last decade, there has been increasing interest in a possible role for aerosol transmission of influenza. the only two studies that compared mask and respirators to protect healthcare workers from influenza infection essentially reached different conclusions 5, 6. a simulation study found strict adherence to guidance about personal protective equipment compromised normal ward functioning in a UK hospital setting. mask use is best undertaken as part of a package of personal protection. early initiation and correct and consistent wearing of masks/respirators may improve effectiveness. however, this remains a major challenge \u2013 both in the context of a formal study and in everyday practice.
