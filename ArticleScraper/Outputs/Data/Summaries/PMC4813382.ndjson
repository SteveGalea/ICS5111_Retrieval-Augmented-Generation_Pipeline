{"summary": "three hundred and forty four ethanol extracts from an Asian herbal plant library were prepared. their effects on cell viability were measured in parallel using an MTTbased cytotoxicity assay. the yaxis indicates the relative percentage cell viability divided by relative HCV replication as measured by Renilla luciferase activity. firefly luciferase activities were measured by using a luciferase reagent. supporting Information Click here for additional data file. grapevine root extract inhibits HCV replication. Nrf2 reporter plasmid was transfected into Huh7.5 cells. transfected cells were plated onto a white 96well plate."}
