{"summary": "viral presence within the cell represents a threat that triggers a complex and integrated antiviral response. some viruses have developed strategies that enable them to counteract, tolerate, or even take advantage of this antiviral response, thereby allowing efficient replication. the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is activated by an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins. in all of these cases, activation of these kinases induces the phosphorylation of eIF2 thereby blocking the cellular translation process. eIF2 is a cell death regulator that makes it an important control target for those viruses that inhibit or stimulate cell survival. the formation of stress granules (SGs) was recently described as being part of the cellular response to stress generated by viral infection. the SGs are aggregates that contain preinitiation complexes, a feature that suggests that this is where translation is arrested under different stress conditions. more than 100 genes involved in SG assembly and disassembly have been described [26], suggesting that SG formation is a very complex process. some studies have proposed certain proteins as being responsible for the assembly of these aggregates. the composition of the SGs varies according to the type of stress. the SGs are not aggregated permanently; they disassemble when the cell recovers from a sublethal stress and consequently protein synthesis is restored. proteins such as Staufen-1, which bind to dsRNA and microtubules, have been described as being important to the disassembly of these aggregates. the role of SGs during PV infection is not yet clear. however, there are data showing that SG composition could be important. in PV-infected cells, the cellular transcription is a modulator of SG assembly since treatment with actinomycin D prevents SG formation. the formation of viral particles is increased, suggesting that the shutoff of protein synthesis and the formation of SGs limit their replication cycle to some extent. a strategy very different from SG regulation is presented in cells infected with the human leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), which can switch SG formation on or off, at its convenience, through the tax viral protein. the SGs can be formed by other stimuli, such as viral entry (MRV), disturbances of cellular transcription (PV) and the regulation of effector proteins of SGs (HTLV-1) all of these findings suggest that SG formation could be the result of a great diversity of interconnected intracellular events leading to the same level of regulation. the presence of TIAR in the replication complexes benefits the viral life cycle of these viruses. it was recently shown that PKR phosphorylates eIF2 [48] from the early stages of infection in rotavirus-infected cells. despite the eIF2 phosphorylation, the formation of SGs is not observed. these aggregates but also enable the design of drugs and strategies to control virus replication."}
