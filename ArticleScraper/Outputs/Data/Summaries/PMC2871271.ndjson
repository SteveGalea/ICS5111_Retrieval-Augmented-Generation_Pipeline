{"summary": "the highest sequence divergence between human, murine, canine and bovine orthologues is found in the -strands comprising the CC'FG-face of the Ig-fold. the highest sequence divergence between human, murine, canine and bovine orthologues is found in the -strands comprising the bacteria-binding CC'FG-face of the Ig-fold. co-evolution of microbial adhesins with receptors on mammalian cells contributes to limited host range of highly adapted infectious agents. one group of mammalian IgCAMs is named according to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumor marker used in the surveillance of colon cancer. ingococci to bind several CEACAM family members including CEACAM1, CEA, and CEACAM6. a similar -barrel structure is also found in commensal Neisseria species. several typeable strains of Haemophilus influenzae can engage CEACAM1 via their outer membrane protein P5. convergent evolution of structurally distinct adhesive proteins to engage CEACAM1 suggests that this binding is important during the life cycle of these bacteria. all CEACAM-binding bacteria greatly differ in their pathogenic potential, but share the same ecological niche. in vitro experiments have suggested that CEACAM-binding promotes colonization of the mucosa. the amino-terminal domain of mammalian CEACAM1 orthologues have clear-cut functional consequences. bacterial adhesins have co-evolved with receptor molecules of their mammalian host. the alignment was performed using CLUSTALW. non-encapsulated N. meningitidis was obtained from Matthias Frosch (Institut f\u00fcr Hygiene und Mikrobiologie, Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Germany). both Moraxella and Neisseriae were grown on GC agar plates (Difco BRL, Paisley, UK) supplemented with vitamins at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and subcultured daily. all the resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pDNR-Dual using the In-Fusion PCR Cloning Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) all the resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pLPS-3'EGFP resulting in mCerulean fused to the carboxy-terminus of the expressed proteins. mCerulean was generated by replacing the GFP coding sequence in p a rabbit polyclonal antibody against His-tagged GFP (clone 4B2/C11) or monoclonal antibody against Opa proteins (clone 4B2/C11; generous gift of Marc Achtman, MPI f\u00fcr Infektionsbiologie, Berlin, Germany) cell-associated fluorescein fluorescence was measured in the presence of 2 mg/ml trypan blue to quench fluorescence of extracellular bacteria. the percentage of fluorescein-positive cells was multiplied by the mean fluorescence intensity of the sample to obtain an estimate of the total number of internalized bacteria. cellular bacteria were stained with AlexaFluor647-streptavidin (invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer for 1 h. samples were embedded in mounting medium (Dako, Glastrup, DK) non-piliated, non-opaque gonococci MS11-B2.1 were provided by T.F. Meyer (Max-Planck Institut f\u00fcr Infektionsbiologie, Berlin, Germany) both moraxella and Neisseriae were grown on GC agar plates (Difco BRL, Paisley, UK) for infection, bacteria were suspended in DMEM. mCEACAM1-sense and mCEACAM1-N-anti areoforms a and b as well as canine CEACAM1 were amplified from full-length cDNA using primers bovine CEACAM1abN. mCerulean was fused to the carboxy-terminus of the expressed proteins. all the resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pDNR-Dual using the In-F cell lysis and Western blotting were performed as described [17] using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against His-tagged GFP or a monoclonal antibody against Opa proteins (clone 4B2/C11; generous gift of Marc Achtman, MPI f\u00fcr Infektionsbiologie, Berlin, Germany). bacteria were labelled with 0.2 g/ml 5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein-succinylester. cell-associated fluorescein fluorescence was measured in the presence of 2 mg/ml trypan blue to quench fluorescence of extracellular bacteria. infected samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. extracellular bacteria were stained with AlexaFluor647-streptavidin (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. samples were embedded in mounting medium (Dako, Glastrup, DK) de-face of the immunoglobulin-fold has a higher amino acid sequence identity. we generated several constructs that allowed us to test the association of CEACAM amino-terminal Igv-like domains with various pathogens. this allowed us to analyse their ability to mediate bacterial internalization by mammalian cells. soluble GFP-tagged amino-terminal domains of CEACAM1 orthologues were incubated with isogenic strains of the human pathogen N. gonorrhoeae. soluble GFP-tagged amino-terminal domains of CEACAM1 orthologues were incubated with isogenic strains of the human pathogen. the non-opaque bacteria (Ngo Opa-) did not reveal a positive signal in the GFP channel for any tested protein. the non-opaque gonococci clearly associated with the isolated amino-terminal Igv-like domain of human CEACAM1. this suggests that CEACAM1 recognition is species-specific. CEACAMs or a control culture supernatant from GFP-transfected cells (neg. control) were incubated with N. gonorrhoeae (Ngo OpaCEA) or the non-opaque strain (Ngo Opa-) only human CEACAM1 (hCEA1) binds to the amino-terminal domain of CEACAM1 is species-specific. culture supernatants containing soluble GFP-tagged amnio-terminal domains of the indicated mammalian CEACAMs were incubated with a control culture supernatant from GFP-transfected cells. only human CEACAM1 (hCEA1) mediates internalization of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. the number of viable intracellular bacteria was determined by gentamicin protection assay. bars represent mean values SEM of three independent experiments done in triplicate. non-opaque gonococci only very low numbers of bacteria were recovered from cells expressing human CEACAM1-4S. both the short and long isoform of human CEACAM1-4 were able to mediate efficient uptake of the pathogens. murine CEACAM1-4S did not mediate internalization of opaque N. gonorrhoeae. 293 cells were transfected with GFP (negative control), human CEACAM1-4S-GFP, or murine CEACAM1-4S-GFP. bacteria were labeled with rhodamine and biotin as a pre-requisite to allow the differential visualization of intracellular and extracellular bacteria. in GFP-expressing cells, bacteria were rarely found associated with cells. 293 cells were transfected with constructs encoding GFP, human CEACAM1-4S-GFP, or murine CEACAM1-4S-GFP as indicated. infected cells were fixed, but not permeabilized, and samples were stained with AlexaFluor647-streptavidin to label extracellular bacteria (Extr. bacteria) we aligned and compared the published sequences of the amino-terminal immunoglobulin variable (Igv)-like domain of human, murine, bovine and canine CEACAM1. sequence differences between the mammalian species are most prominent in -strands forming the CC'C\"FG-face. the glycosylated AA'BDE-face of the immunoglobulin-fold has a higher amino acid sequence identity. soluble GFP-tagged amino-terminal domains of CEACAM1 orthologues were expressed in human cells as soluble GFP-fusion proteins. soluble GFP-tagged amino-terminal domains of CEACAM1 orthologues were incubated with isogenic strains of the human pathogen. the non-opaque bacteria (Ngo Opa-) did not reveal a positive signal in the GFP channel for any tested protein. the non-opaque bacteria (Ngo Opa-) did not reveal a positive signal for any tested protein. the non-opaque bacteria clearly associated with the isolated amino-terminal Igv-like domain of human CEACAM1. culture supernatants from cells transfected with a vector encoding cytoplasmically expressed GFP served as control. culture supernatants containing soluble GFP-tagged amino-terminal domains of the indicated mammalian CEACAMs or a control culture supernatant from GFP-transfected cells (neg. control) bacteria were analysed by flow cytometry. the human CEACAM1 N-terminal domain was strongly associated with both, N. meningitidis and M. catarrhalis. these results demonstrate that several Gram-negative human pathogens selectively recognize the amino-terminal Igv-like domain of human CEACAM1. 293 cells were transfected with constructs encoding the indicated human or murine CEACAM1 isoforms fused to GFP or Cerulean. after 48 h, cells were lysed and expression was determined by Western blotting. bars represent mean values SEM of three independent experiments done in triplicate. antibiotic protection assay based on recovery of viable intracellular bacteria after treatment of infected cells with gentamicin. only very low numbers of bacteria were recovered from cells expressing human CEACAM1-4S. murine CEACAM1-4S was not able to mediate internalization. cells expressing murine CEACAM1-4S did not harbor intracellular bacteria, further corroborating the notion that OpaCEA proteins of N. gonorrhoeae do not functionally engage CEACAM1 orthologues of other mammalian species. rhodamine and biotin labeled bacteria as pre-requisite to allow differential visualization of intracellular and extracellular bacteria. 293 cells expressing murine CEACAM1 showed only very few cell-associated bacteria and no intracellular bacteria were detected. only human CEACAM1 is recruited to the cell associated bacteria and is co-internalized with eukaryotic cells. CEACAM-binding adhesins from pathogenic Neisseriae and moraxella catarrhalis display a high selectivity for human CEACAMs. the amino acid sequence divergence, particularly high in the CC'C\"FG-face of the amino-terminal Igv-like domain of mammalian CEACAM1 orthologues, results in functional differences with regard to bacterial binding. MHV-A59 selectively recognizes CEACAM1a and only marginally binds to the CEACAM1b allele. despite this selectivity for the murine CEACAM1a allele, it has been shown that several MHV strains can utilize human CEACAM1 as well as CEA to infect eukaryotic cells in vitro. e C4bp only provides protection from complement for some, but not all gonococcal strains. adhesion to the mucosal surface epithelium is the initial step in the colonization by CEACAM-binding bacteria. this specialization could contribute to the limited host spectrum of pathogenic Neisseriae, but also of M. catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. this study was supported by funds from the DFG (Ha2856/6-1) to C.R.H."}
