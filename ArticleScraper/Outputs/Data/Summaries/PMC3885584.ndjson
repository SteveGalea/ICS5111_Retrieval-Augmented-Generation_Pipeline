{"summary": "cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) has been increasingly used as a non-human primate model in biomedical research. we tested the hypothesis that age and sex may affect thoracic radiography parameters of this species. the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis), an old world monkey, has been increasingly used as a non-human primate model in biomedical research. the species is more anatomically and physiologically homologous to humans as compared with other animal models. thoracic radiographic indices of the feral cynomolgus monkey have not been previously reported. most cynomolgus monkeys used in scientific research are reared and observed in captivity. thoracic radiography of captive cynomolgus monkeys has not been a focus of previous investigation. 88 81 7 Total 697 391 306 All subjects were housed in either same-sex social groups or mixed-sex social groups. subjects were given water ad libitum and fed twice daily with fresh fruits, vegetables, and compound high-nutrition monkey food. the living environment and animal care procedures have been previously reported. the software allows us to view the digital radiographs on the computer. the software allows us to measure the radiographs by built-in tools. the lung length (LL) was defined as the distance from the tubercle of the first rib to the top of the dome of the right diaphragm. R-HHR was defined as the ratio of the distance from the pulmonary apex to the hilus pulmonis (T1) to the distance from the hilus pulmonis to the diaphragm (T2). the lung length (LL), maximum interior thoracic breadth (TBr), maximum breadth of cardiac silhouette (CBr), right and left costophrenic angles (RCA and LCA) are indicated. range is defined as the lowest observed value to the highest observed value. CR = CBr/TBr. R-HHR = T1/T2. Table 4. Measurements of Cynomolgus Monkeys Aged 49\u201360 Months*. range is defined as the lowest observed value to the highest observed value. CR = CBr/TBr. R-HHR = T1/T2. a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the effect of age, sex, and age sex interactions. the significance level was set to 0.05. the CR did not significantly correlate with body weight of either males or females. the CR did significantly correlate with body weight of males (r = 0.021, p = 0.683, n = 391) and females (r = 0.055, p = 0.337, n = 306). all subjects were housed at the Xishan Zhongke Laboratory Animals Co. Ltd. (Suzhou, China), an association for the assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-accredited company. the groups were housed in either same-sex social groups or mixed-sex social groups. images were obtained during inspiratory phase of respiration. right-to-left lateral and posteroanterior thoracic radiographs were obtained from all subjects. the right hilar height ratio (R-HHR) was obtained from lateral radiography. an intersecting line then was drawn from the midpoint of the hilus pulmonis perpendicular to the first line. the lung length (LL), maximum interior thoracic breadth (TBr), right and left costophrenic angles (RCA and LCA) and cardiothoracic ratio (CR = CBr/TBr) are indicated. statistical analysis were performed using SPSS version 18 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) Parameters (unit) Males and Females (n = 356) Males (n = 184) Females (n = 172) Range is defined as the lowest observed value to the highest observed value. Range is defined as the lowest observed value to the highest observed value. CR = CBr/TBr. R-HHR = T1/T2. Table 3. Measurements of Cynomolgus Monkeys Aged 37\u201348 Months*. a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the effect of age, sex, and age sex interactions. a t-test was applied to detect significant differences between male and female subjects in the same age group. the CR did not significantly correlate with body weight of either males. the CR did not significantly correlate with the body weight of either males. the CR did not significantly correlate with the body weight of either males. significant effects by age sex were found for TD, TBr, TBr, and CR. both TD and TBr increased with age in both sexes. CR declined with age and was significantly higher in males than females. projectional X-ray radiography remains the most rapid, cost-effective imaging modality for non-human primates. no study has measured chest film parameters on cynomolgus macaques, but it is essential to construct reference indices of thoracic-based parameters for this species. the mean CR of captive cynomolgus monkey found here was most similar to that of the macaca tonkeana and the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) [5] (mean CR = 0.59), but slightly higher than that of the macaca cyclopis (mean CR = 0.528) [7], Macaca nigra (mean CR = 0.522) [9], and feral cy the hilar height ratio (HHR) is used to evaluate the position of the hilus in the hemithorax. an abnormal HHR aids in diagnosing alterations in pulmonary volume. this is consistent with human studies reporting normal R-HHR values exceeding 1.00. the normal appearance of chest films for cynomolgus monkeys older than 60 months should be assessed in future studies. the thoracic radiographic parameters for the healthy cynomolgus monkey presented here should prove useful in veterinary practice."}
