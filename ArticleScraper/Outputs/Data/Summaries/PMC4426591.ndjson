{"summary": "dengue disease encompasses a spectrum of clinical features, ranging from mild febrile illness to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) there are no effective strategies for the prevention of dengue disease. studies using sera from patients with japan encephalitis virus (JEV) and enterovirus (EV71) infections showed endothelial cell-binding levels similar to those of the normal controls. a cross-reactive epitope on the NS1 located between amino acid residues 311\u2013330 (P311\u2013330) reduced the binding activity of sera from patients with DHF with endothelial cells and platelets. DF patients and 43 samples from 15 DHF patients. one patient was infected with DENV1 in a secondary infection. the other one with unknown serotype primary infection. HMEC-1 cells were detached with 1,000 U/mL trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA. the cell suspension was then incubated at 5 105 per tube with sera from patients with DHF (1:50 dilution) the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\u2013conjugated anti-human IgM or IgG for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. recombinant NS1 protein was induced by a 2 mM final concentration of isopropyl -d-thiogalactoside. a single band was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a linear mixed model was used to adjust for intra-individual correlations. patient sera was provided by Dr. N. Hung (Department of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever, Children's Hospital No. 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) the clinical diagnosis of DF and DHF was based on the 1997 criteria of the World Health Organization. human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1) was obtained from the center for disease control. HMEC-1 cells were detached with 1,000 U/mL trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA. the cell suspension was then incubated at 5 105 per tube with sera. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013conjugated anti-human IgM and IgG were added and incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. the preparations were then washed with 0.05% PBS-Tween 20 and incubated with 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) or 2,2\u2032-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) ( Synthetic peptides, P311\u2013330, N\u2032[H]-WCCRSCTLPPLRYRGEDGCW-C\u2032[OH]) and P211\u2013225 (residues 211\u2013225, N\u2032[H]-KIEKASFIEVKSCHW-C\u2032[OH]) were obtained from Sigma-Genosys. serum samples were further classified into four groups according to collection time. there was no significant difference in either IgM or IgG levels of anti-PDI, anti-HSP60, and anti-vimentin between different collection times. antibody titer to ATP synthase was not determined because purified protein is not commercially available. anti-PDI and anti-HSP60 IgM levels correlated positively with both anti-endothelial cell IgM titers and anti-DENV NS1 IgM titers. however, anti-vimentin IgM levels did not correlate with anti\u2013endothelial cell (Figure 2G) or anti-DENV NS1 IgM titers in normal control sera. correlation of anti-endothelial cell IgM and anti-DENV NS1 P311\u2013330 IgM levels in sera from patients with DHF. results showed higher IgM and IgG titers against P311\u2013330 in sera from patients with DHF. correlation of anti-human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (anti-HMEC-1) IgM as determined by flow cytometry and anti-P311\u2013330 IgM as determined by ELISA was analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation test. anti-P211\u2013225 antibodies were used as negative control. 0.191** Anti-P311\u2013330 IgM 0.108 0.058 0.143 0.038 0.238 0.111** Anti-P311\u2013330 IgG 0.158 0.063 0.287 0.080** 0.519 0.419** Anti-P211\u2013225 IgM 0.082 0.028 0.087 0.016 0.095 0.021 Anti-PDI = anti-heat shock protein 60; anti-HSP60 = anti-heat shock protein 60; anti-P311\u2013330 antibodies cross-reactive with endothelial cell surface PDI in deNV-induced autoimmunity. anti-PDI and heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) antibodies cross-reactive with endothelial cell surface PDI. serum samples were further classified into four groups according to collection time. there was no significant difference in either IgM or IgG levels of anti-PDI, anti-HSP60, and anti-vimentin between different collection times. antibody titer to ATP synthase was not determined because purified protein is not commercially available. anti-vimentin IgM levels did not correlate with anti-DENV NS1 IgM titers. there was no correlation between anti-PDI, anti-HSP60, or anti-vimentin IgM and IgG levels with anti-DENV NS1 IgM and IgG levels. correlation of anti-endothelial cell IgM and anti-DENV NS1 P311\u2013330 IgM levels in sera from patients with DHF. a cross-reactive epitope on the NS1 amino acid residues 311\u2013330 (P311\u2013330) was predicted. anti-PDI, anti-HSP60, anti-P311-330, and anti-P211-225 antibodies were used as negative control. the result was similar to that using recombinant DENV NS1 protein derived by expression in E. coli. anti-PDI IgM and IgG levels correlated positively with anti-P311\u2013330 IgM and IgG levels. however, anti-HSP60 IgM and IgG levels did not correlate with anti-P311\u2013330 IgM and IgG levels. correlation of anti\u2013protein disulfide isomerase (anti-PDI) and heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) antibody levels in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation test. anti-DENV NS1 IgM titers correlate with anti-PDI and anti-HSP60 IgM, but not with anti-vimentin IgM. most of the observed positive correlations in this clinical investigation of sera from patients with DHF were of the IgM isotype. inverse correlation between platelet count and platelet-associated IgG or IgM levels was found during the acute phase of secondary dengue infections. anti-DENV NS1 antibodies inhibited PDI activity and platelet aggregation. both inhibitory effects were prevented when anti-DENV NS1 antibodies were preabsorbed with PDI. the characterization of cross-reactive epitopes is important for NS1-based DENV vaccine development and therapeutic strategies."}
