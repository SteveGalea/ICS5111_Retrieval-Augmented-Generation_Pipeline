{"summary": "the epidemiologic criteria changed during the course of the outbreak. from April 4 to May 3, 2003, only patients who had close contact with a known SARS patient could be diagnosed with SARS. laboratory testing for SARS-CoV was not part of the case definition. only patients whose hospitalization occurred after April 28, 2003 were included in the study. a list of patients admitted to the 16 designated SARS hospitals in Beijing was obtained periodically. serum samples were refrigerated at 4\u00b0C. all serum samples were obtained >21 days after illness onset. 80% were obtained 76\u2013106 days after onset of symptoms. the epidemiologic criteria changed during the course of the outbreak. from April 4 to May 3, 2003, only patients who had close contact with a known SARS patient could be diagnosed with SARS. visiting or residing in Beijing was considered sufficient to meet the epidemiologic criteria of the case definition. case-patients were eligible for the study if they met the probable case definition and reported no close contact with any known probable or suspected SARS patients. the latest date of hospitalization included in our study was June 9, 2003. all serum samples were obtained >21 days after illness onset. 80% of them were obtained 76\u2013106 days after onset of symptoms. most frequent reasons for refusal were being reluctant to disclose personal information. median age was 29 years (range 14\u201384) for case-patients and 31 years (range 14\u201382) for controls. health-related risk factors were significantly associated with an increased risk for clinically diagnosed SARS. eating out more than once a week and using several types of transportation were associated with SARS. social gatheringe 7 10 0.8 (0.3 to 1.8) 0.52 Visited any movie theater, concert hall, or indoor gym 2 4 0.6 (0.1 to 2.8) 0.48 Visited any farmer\u2019s market 23 37 0.5 (0.3 to 0.9) 0.01 Eating out Never 62 70 Reference Once a week 14 15 1.2 (0.6 to 2.4) 0.67 More than once a week 24 15 2.3 (1.2 to 4.5) 0.01 Riding a bus Never 62 73 Reference cFever clinics were established for triage of patients who might have SARS to separate them from other persons being evaluated in emergency rooms or outpatient clinics. fPets reported by case-patients included dogs (3 cases), cats (3 cases), fish (1 case), and pigeons (1 case) Factors associated with SARS in multivariable analysis are presented in Table 2. bFever clinics were established for triage of patients who might have SARS to separate them from other persons being evaluated in emergency rooms or outpatient clinics. a total of 31 blood specimens had been tested for IgG to SARS-CoV, and 8 were positive. the frequency of a history of hospital exposure among our case-patients was consistent with the epidemiology of SARS observed in other major outbreaks. visiting a fever clinic was a very strong risk factor for SARS. some community exposures were significantly more common among case-patients than controls, including eating out or taking taxis frequently. by univariate analysis, use of other common transport (e.g., buses, subways) also associated with a risk for SARS. investigators identified SARS-CoV in household pets and cockroaches. rumors circulating during the Beijing SARS outbreak led to some calls for banning household pets or restricting them from common areas. a significant portion of case-patients without contact with other SARS patients likely had pneumonia caused by pathogens other than SARS-CoV. some limitations to this study should be mentioned. the study was conducted late in the Beijing epidemic, after patients had been hospitalized. introducing a wide net for contact tracing and patient isolation. increased risk for clinically defined SARS was associated with attending fever clinics, having a chronic disease, and having certain community exposures."}
