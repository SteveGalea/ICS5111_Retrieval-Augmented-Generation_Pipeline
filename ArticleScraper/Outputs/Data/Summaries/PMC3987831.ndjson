{"summary": "study aims to explore the status of hospital disaster resilience among tertiary hospitals in Shandong province, china. the study aims to explore the status of resilience among tertiary hospitals in. Shandong province, china. substantial resources have been devoted to improving disaster resilience in china. tertiary hospitals are the key component, as they are the main providers of health care during disasters. the resilience of hospitals can be defined as their ability to resist, absorb, and respond to the shock of disasters while maintaining critical functionality. the questionnaire was developed from an established framework of hospital disaster resilience. most questions are in the format of binary variables, and can be answered by \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. a cross-sectional survey was conducted in tertiary hospitals of Shandong province in china. a total of 50 tertiary hospitals were selected using random sampling. the sample was composed of 28 tertiary A hospitals, 20 tertiary B hospitals and 2 tertiary C hospitals. a mean score and ninety-five percent confidence interval of means (95% CI) were used to describe each resilience domain. comparisons of the mean score of each resilience domain among different hospital categorizes were performed. CI Mean 95% CI Level Tertiary A 27 5.78 6.22 2.26 8.07 9.34 10.59 8.98 0.89 5.35,6.21 * 5.81,6.64 * 1.98,2.54 * 7.44,8.70 * 7.53,11.16 8.16,13.02 7.62,10.33 * 0.501.27 * Tertiary B 14 4.43 3.36 1.29

by regression analysis applied to the sample. 0.030 X 1 0.315 X 2 + 0.138 X 3 + 0.443 X 4 + 0.182 X 5 + 0.659 X 6 0.214 X 7 0.211 X 8 F 3 = 0.253 X 1 0.116 X 2 + 0.093 X 3 + 0.007 X 4 + 0.364 X 5

score of hospital disaster management mechanism (F2) was relatively lower than the other three factors with less than 50% having positive scores. 92.7% of responders had developed syndromic surveillance systems for certain high risk of infectious diseases. only 12.2% of all responding hospitals had local risk evaluation for hospital prevention and mitigation. but this percentage varied with 88.9% within tertiary A hospitals. only a small percentage had established specific plans of dealing with natural disasters. over four-fifths of responding hospitals (85.4%) possessed a protocol to initiate the plan. less than three-quarters (73.2%) had a classification response system for different levels and different phases of events. tertiary A hospitals had this evaluation report compared with tertiary B hospitals (28.6%). only 26.8% had specific channels of investing money, transferring staff, and purchasing equipment for recovery. 75.6% of participating hospitals had stockpiles of emergency drugs. 43.9% had signed contracts with emergency drug-supplies to provide drugs. most (92.7%) had their own ambulances, among them 73.7% had ward-type ambulances, but only 15.8% had access to a negative pressure isolation ambulance. more than half (65.8%) could dispatch emergency staff during disasters for the on-site rescue. case-mix 73.2% had orthopaedic beds, 56.1% had special beds for burns and 59.5% had hyperbaric oxygen chamber. 73.2% had capacity for treating mass casualty of trauma, 48.8% for mass casualty of blast injury, gunshot wounds and crush injury, 46.3% for acute chemical poisoning, only 17.1% could treat radiation issues. most of the responding hospitals (95.1%) had disaster training programs. 53.7% had drills, to treat the following emergency types respectively. about 85.4% had training curriculums, and 90.2% updated them regularly. only 12.2% of all responding hospitals had local risk evaluation for hospital prevention and mitigation. more than half (68.3%) had evaluated critical infrastructure vulnerability and safety standards. but this percentage varied with 88.9% within tertiary A hospitals. most hospitals (87.8%) reported that they could operate in accordance with the plan during disasters. less than three-quarters (73.2%) had a classification response system. only 26.8% had specific channels of investing money, transferring staff, and purchasing equipment for recovery. 75.6% of participating hospitals had stockpiles of emergency drugs. 43.9% signed contracts with emergency drug-supplies to provide drugs during emergencies. only 22.0% signed Memorandum of Understandings with other hospitals. more than half (65.8%) could dispatch emergency staff during disasters. tertiary hospitals were equipped with emergency package of supplies for living 3 days. 73.2% had orthopaedic beds, 56.1% had special beds for burns. mass casualty capacity refers to each hospital is to assess itself on its capacity to accept at least 30 patients of the same disease within a short period [21] most of the responding hospitals had medical care equipment, such as breathing machine (100%), vital signs monitors (100%), defibrillator machines (90.2%), and cardiac resuscitation devices (70.7%). only 36.6% adopted a wide variety of flexible procedures for surging their beds capacity, through early discharge of patients (85.4%), most of the responding hospitals (95.1%) had disaster training programs. 53.7% had drills to treat the following emergency types respectively. about 85.4% had training curriculums, and 90.2% updated them regularly. a survey conducted using the self-report questionnaire identified variability in the scope of disaster resilience arrangement of hospitals in the province. it was noticed that in some key areas there was a difference in disaster resilience arrangements between tertiary A and tertiary B hospitals. this may be due to different levels or types of hospitals having divergent functions in disasters. most (92.3%) of the hospitals assigned missions were tertiary A. hospital disaster preparedness in Shandong province is close to the capital city. it is expected that hospital disaster readiness in many other parts of china may lag well behind that of Shandong province. tertiary hospitals devised disaster plans and command structures. in the province of china, less than half of responding hospitals had signed contracts with drug-supplies. only one fifth had attended community-wide drills. continuity of medical care is amongst the most important objectives for prompt and effective response. a community-wide, integrated, inter-agency network should be built, with local hospitals working together to surge overall capacity collectively [33] a community-wide, integrated, inter-agency network should be built, with local hospitals working together to surge overall capacity collectively. the current study has several limitations. first, the likelihood of non-response bias was likely to exist. as a relatively larger percentage of tertiary hospitals replied to the survey than the tertiary B and tertiary C hospitals. the difference between tertiary A and tertiary B hospitals was also identified in essential areas. a framework was presented which may assist hospitals to better understand what constitutes effective hospital resilience."}
