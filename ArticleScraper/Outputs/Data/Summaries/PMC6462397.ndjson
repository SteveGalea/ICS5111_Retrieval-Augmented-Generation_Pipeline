{"summary": "seasonal influenza virus infection is responsible for about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths each year. hMPV is now recognized as a frequent cause of acute respiratory tract infections in children predominantly 5 years of age, elderly adults, and immunocompromised patients. ILI was defined as fever (>38 \u00b0C) and accompanying respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, or pharyngitis. available patient information included gender and age, but not extensive clinical information. no cross-detections were observed between the two viruses and other respiratory viruses including influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus. RT-PCR assay of influenza A and B viruses was previously described.

RNA and random hexamers were incubated at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by extension for 2 h at 42 \u00b0C and inactivation at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. analyses of RSV and hMPV genotypes were aligned using ClustalW implemented in BioEdit (version 7.0.9) by comparison to the sequences previously assigned to specific genotypes. reliability of the tree based on the Tamura\u2013Nei model was estimated using 1,000 bootstrap pseudo-replications. real-time RT-PCR RNA was extracted from 200 L of specimens using the Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit (IRB number 609/59) the primers and probes targeted the M gene of RSV and the F gene of hMPV. fluorescence signals cycle threshold (Ct) was based on optimization. values 38 were considered positive. RNA and random hexamers were incubated at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by extension for 2 h at 42 \u00b0C and inactivation at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. RNA and random hexamers were incubated at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by extension for 2 h at 42 \u00b0C and inactivation at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. cycling parameters were initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 20 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 20 s, elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. identical amplification parameters were carried out in the second-round PCR for 30 cycles. s were considered the same genotype if clustered together with bootstrap values of 70\u2013100%. influenza virus infection was more frequently found among older individuals. hMPV infection was distributed among all ages (1.7\u20135.7%) year No. of samples Virus-positive samples (%) hMPV-positive (%) Influenza virus-positive (%) 2016 4,178 1,428 (34.2) 590 (14.1) 114 (2.7) 814 (19.5) 2017 4,664 1,271 (27.3) 421 (9.0) 204 (4.4) 714 (15.3) Total 8,842 2,699 (30.5) 1,011 (11.4) 318 (3.6) 1,528 (17.3) Table 3. Characteristics of samples and detection frequency the prevalence of viral etiology of influenza-like infection differed slightly among the viruses examined. from 1,011 RSV-positive samples, subgroup identification was possible for 488 specimens. of these, 36.3% (177/488) were RSV-A and 66.4% (324/488) were RSV-B. bar graphs show hMPV-positive rate with hMPV-A in blue and hMPV-B in red. bar graphs show frequency of influenza A (dark green) and influenza B (light green) virus infection with A/H1N1 in orange and A/H3N2 in pink. phylogenetic analysis of 132 hMPV strains identified in this study showed two main genetic lineages, A and B. the majority of the strains belonged to subgroup B1 (74%, 98/132), while only 6% (8/132) belonged to subgroup B2. a percentage, the virus most often found in coinfections was RSV, which was found in 17.4% (176/1,011) of the samples. followed by hMPV (10.4%, 33/318), and influenza virus (8.5%, 130/1,528). hMPV (non-typed) RSV-A RSV-B hMPV (non-typed) hMPV-A2 hMPV-B1 hMPV-B2 we retrospectively tested 8,842 consecutive respiratory samples (48.5% males, age range 0\u2013106 years) of these, 30.5% (2,699/8,842) were positive for one or more viruses. influenza virus was most commonly identified (17.3%, 1,528/8,842) followed by RSV (11.4%, 1,011/8,842) and hMPV (3.6%, 318/8,842) SV (%) (N = 1,011) hMPV(%) (N = 318) Influenza A+B (%) (N = 1,528) Age, year (mean SD age) 2 (1.2 0.6) 1,916 (21.7) 406 (21.2) 105 (5.5) 134 (7.0) 3\u20135 (3.8 0.8) 1,541 (17.4) 238 (15.4) 88 (5.7) 160 (10.4) 6\u201312 (8.4 1.9) 1,253 (14.2) 100 from 318 samples tested positive for influenza virus, there were more influenza A virus (76.2%, 1,164/1,528) than influenza B virus (23.8%, 364/1,528) in 2016, high prevalence of influenza virus occurred twice, 20.5% (59/288) in March and 34.5% (234/678) in September. inter-subgroup diversity between A_ON1 and B_BA9 was relatively high (p-distance value of 2.17\u20132.44) genetic variations among intra-genotype strains were relatively small (p-distance value of 0\u20130.073 and 0\u20130.071 within the ON1 and BA9 genotypes, respectively). tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method and the Tamura\u2013Nei model implemented in the MEGA6. the reliability of the tree was estimated using 1000 bootstrap pseudo-replicates. 25.0 \u2013 0 0 18 1 1 1 23 68 20 RSV-A 176 158 18 0 10.2 0 \u2013 13 1 0 1 0 1 2 0 RSV-B 321 293 27 1 8.7 0 13 \u2013 3 1 1 0 2 6 3 hMPV (non-typed) 186 161 22 3 13.4 18 1 3 \u2013 0 0 0 1 3 2 hMPV-A2 26 24 2 children aged 5 years with rates of infection between 15.4 and 21.2%. the proportion of patients with influenza virus infections increased with age. the rate of infection was greatest in children 13\u201318 years of age (27.2%) rsh et al., 2014; Fall et al., 2016; Auksornkitti et al., 2016; Thongpan et al., 2017). it has been hypothesized that the periodic shifts in the predominant RSV subgroup are driven by the dynamics of population immunity. some studies have observed that RSV group A infection was associated with an increased illness severity. data in literature on association between clinical symptoms and hMPV genotype remains unclear as some authors show a higher severity of illness. prevalence of mostly influenza A H3N2 contrasts with limited circulation of influenza B during this two-year study period. a small number of individuals had dual infections, most commonly RSV and influenza A H3N2. accurate molecular detection can potentially assist clinicians and researchers in the treatment and surveillance to limit viral spread.
