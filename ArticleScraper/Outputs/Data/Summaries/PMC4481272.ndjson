{"summary": "the precise and rapid documentation of respiratory specimens can lead to a significant effect on the disease progress in patients [2]. ARIs are most often associated with poorly specific clinical presentations [6] and therefore, their aetiological diagnosis mainly relies on laboratory testing. conventional monoplex PCR assays are tedious, expensive and require large amounts of biological samples. the eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (Genomica, Coslada, Spain); the MultiCode-PLx (EraGen Biosciences); the Easyplex respiratory pathogen 12 kit (Ausdiagnostics, Sydney, Australia); the Seeplex RV15 OneStep ACE Detection and Pneumobacter ACE Detection (Seegene Inc.), and the ResPlex II Panel v2.0 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany we combined normalised extraction of nucleic acids, \"reference\" monoplex real-time PCR detection and a consensus interpretation algorithm to estimate the intrinsic capability of each kit to detection of the various pathogens tested. the patients' age ranged from 1 month to 79 years. assay is based on multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology. results are analysed by capillary electrophoresis. extraction of nucleic acids was standardised to use a similar molecular substrate in each assay.

PPV, Sensitivity, NPV, and Specificity values were calculated. tenfold serial dilutions of nucleic acids were performed and tested. the last three dilutions allowing unambiguous detection were used. the lowest dilution had a Ct at 33 and the highest dilution had a Ct between 37 and 40. the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast (xTagRVP-F) is based on a multiplex RT-PCR reaction in which the target-specific primers are chimeric. this allows the detection of 19 different respiratory viruses by sorting on a Luminex xMAP instrument. results are analysed by capillary electrophoresis. enzaviruses (PIV) (1, 2, 3 and 4a/b), human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) (A and B), Enteroviruses (EV), Rhinoviruses (hRV), Adenoviruses (AdV), parechoviruses, human Bocavirus (hBoV), human Coronaviruses (hCoV), the \"Extra tests\" being defined as those corresponding to pathogens mo H1N1pdm09 Chlam pneumo H3N2 Strepto pneumo Inf B Haemo inf sp Inf C Haemo inf B PIV 1 Staph aur PIV 2 Morax catarr PIV 3 Bord pert PIV 4 Klebs pneumo PIV 4 b Salmo sp hRSV hRSV A hRSV B EV/ hRV EV Ad 1, 2, 3, 4, 4a, 4b; hRSV A, B: human Respiratory Syncytial Virus A, B; EV: Enterovirus; hBoV: human Bocavirus; hMPV: human Metapneumovirus; hPeV: human Metapneumovirus A, B; CMV: Cytomegalovirus; EVs: Echovirus; hPeV: human Parechovirus; hPe four broad range multiplex kits were tested with in-house real-time RT-PCR assays. all samples were analysed according to results obtained by the four broad range multiplex kits. PPV, Sensitivity, NPV, and Specificity values were calculated for Extra tests. only results relating to viral pathogens were analysed in depth. a majority of bacterial pathogens were detected only by the FTD-RP33 test. a sample testing positive using both molecular detection and direct immunofluorescence was used as a positive control. nucleic acids were extracted as described above but using an initial sample volume of 400L and an elution volume of 120L. the last three dilutions allowing unambiguous detection were used to create a panel.

PCR, direct immunofluorescence, and viral culture in the case of the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast assay [7,19,23\u201325]. previous studies included comparison with other multiplex commercial kits. a new technique is able to detect viral variants that could not be detected by previous methods. the actual clinical impact of an improved detection of low viral loads in respiratory samples has not been accurately evaluated. this indicates that the interpretation of evaluation scores should remain careful and open-minded. a second difficult issue for comparing respiratory pathogens multiplex techniques is the choice of the panel of samples tested. the nature and frequency of pathogens present in the samples tested are highly dependent on the epidemiological circumstances and on the populations tested. the low number or absence of positive samples for some viruses represents in most of the studies an obvious obstacle for accurate comparisons. we have identified a series of common pathogens detected by all kits. bacterium detection was absent or very limited in 3 of the 4 kits tested. the simultaneous detection of bacteria and viruses represents a theoretical great advantage in terms of clinical management. false positive results may hypothetically be related to the fact that the technique includes an open-tube post amplification step. in serial dilution tests, 4 (Inf A H3N2, Inf B, Inf C and hMPV A) out of the 10 pathogens detected in the most concentrated dilution tested negative at dilutions 101 and 102. xTagRVP-F: xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast; FTD-RP33: xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast; RespiFinder: RespiFinder SMART 22 Our study globally confirms the previously observed good performances of the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast. the poorest results were observed for influenza A positive predictive value (78.9%) and influenza B and human bocavirus sensitivity values (44.4% and 20%, respectively) dilution 101 and 7 (inf B and C, hRSV B, EV Cox B3, hPeV, hAdV B and hMPV A) at dilution 102, in coherence with previous observations. the kit also provided the best results in serial dilution tests. the kit also provided the best results in serial dilution tests. ologies identified, co-infection with viruses and viral results. docx Click here for additional data file."}
