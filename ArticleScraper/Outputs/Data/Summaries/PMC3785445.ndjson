{"summary": "the ribosomal RNA content of a sample collected from a woman with BV was analysed to determine the active microbial community. the metatranscriptome was sequenced using Roche 454 titanium chemistry. the bioinformatics pipeline MG-RAST and desktop DNA analysis platforms were utilised to analyse results. BV is a condition affecting the vaginal microbiota where in the childbearing age woman the natural microbiota (typically Lactobacillus spp.) is depleted and replaced by an overgrowth of mixed, primarily anaerobic bacteria. this condition has significant associations with miscarriage, premature birth and pelvic infections, and can increase a woman's risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and HIV. the metatranscriptomic screening of clinical samples has been described for gut and dental microbiomes [6], [7], with only one study to date applying this methodology to BV[8]. an important difficulty faced with the application of this technique is the low levels of RNA present in many samples. this requires reduction of host RNA and subsequent linear amplification of RNA for transcriptomic analysis [9], [10]. de-identified participants and ethical approval for this study were obtained previously from the Alfred Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee. total RNA extraction was performed using Trizol (Life Technologies) with use of 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane in place of chloroform followed by RNA purification using a RNeasy column. any remaining DNA was digested using the Turbo DNA-free enzyme (Life Technologies). cDNA and 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries were subsequently bar-coded using MID tags and sequenced together using a quarter region of a 454 sequencing plate. a 90% cut-off was used as an arbitrary cut-off for database searches within MG-RAST as an arbitrary cut-off for genus identities using the RDP database. functional genes from the cDNA library were characterised by SEED analysis within MG-RAST. reads derived from the cDNA library assigned to each major genus were also imported into Lasergene 8. consensus sequences of alignments were assigned an identity using the BLAST algorithm with a 98% identity required to assign a species name. the association of P. amnii with BV, defined as a Nugent score of 7\u201310, was made using a chi square test, reported with odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) all analyses were carried out using Stata version 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, USA) human ribosomal content was subtracted using the MICROBEnrich Kit (Life Technologies) as per manufacturer instructions followed by removal of small RNAs with the MEGAclear kit (Life Technologies) cDNA concentration was determined by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, USA) sequence analysis Subsequent to sequencing, all raw sequencing data was de-multiplexed according to their MID tags. data was then imported into Genomics Workbench version 4.5.1 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark) each dataset was then screened for chimeric sequences using UCHIME [16], with the trimmed and filtered data submitted to the MG-RAST bioinformatics pipeline. the consensus sequences of alignments were assigned an identity using the BLAST algorithm with a 98% identity required to assign a species name. a primer set for Prevotella amnii was developed using the forward and reverse primers 27F and 338R [24]. results nugent 10 patients' cDNA library In total, 89969 raw sequencing reads were obtained with an ultimate post data filtration of 78285 reads. this library consisted of 72826 (93%) bacterial reads, 3865 (4.9%) human reads and 34 (0.04%) either plastid, fungal or viral reads. of the bacterial reads, 31857 (43.7%) were of the 16S rRNA gene. the bioinformatics pipeline of MG-RAST was able to annotate 2053/4349 of the non-ribosomal RNA reads. most abundant functional gene read identities were represented by genes expressed by the genus Prevotella. s % % % of reads TonB-dependent receptor plug domain protein 103 7.57 100 putative lipoprotein 76 5.58 100 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, type I 57 4.19 87.7 MotA/TolQ/ExbB proton channel family protein 40 2.94 100 translation elongation factor Tu 39 2.87 46.2 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP the proportion of Lactobacillus spp. determined by qPCR to be 1.9% (cDNA = 1.4%;
