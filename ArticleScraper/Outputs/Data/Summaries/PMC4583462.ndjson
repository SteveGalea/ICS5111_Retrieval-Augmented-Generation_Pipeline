{"summary": "picornaviridae is a large family of positive-sense RNA viruses. members of the genus Enterovirus include important human viruses like poliovirus (PV), coxsackieviruses (CV), causing meningitis and myocarditis, and rhinoviruses (RV) coronaviruses replicate their genomic RNA on specialized, virus-modified intracellular membranes. these remodeled membranes termed replication organelles arise from the concerted actions of both viral nonstructural proteins and co-opted host factors. despite intensive investigation, the role of GBF1 in enterovirus replication is not yet elucidated. OSBP shuttles cholesterol from ER to the Golgi and PI4P from the Golgi to the ER. in enterovirus infection, OSBP exchanges PI4P for cholesterol most likely at ER-RO MCSs. the unique lipid and protein composition of enterovirus ROs determines their particular 3D architecture. inhibition of autophagy exerted only minor effects on virus replication. evidence for a role of autophagy in virus replication also exists for enteroviruses. but rather related to non-lytic virus release or modulation of host innate immune responses than viral genome replication. siRNA-mediated gene knockdown using a set of siRNA sequences (Ambion) previously tested for efficiency and toxicity. we observed inhibitory effects on EMCV replication when silencing PI4KA, but not upon silencing of the other PI4Ks. blot analysis shows efficient knockdown of PI4KA and PI4KB. EMCV RNA was in vitro transcribed and subsequently transfected in cells depleted of PI4KA. PI4KA plays a key role in EMCV genome RNA replication. we investigated whether EMCV required the enzymatic activity of PI4KA using AL-9, a PI4K inhibitor that also blocks PI4KB. coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) has been previously shown to hijack the Golgi-localized PI4KB for replication. replication of the human cardiovirus Saffold virus 3 (SAFV3) was also sensitive to AL-9 treatment. different cardiovirus species required the enzymatic activity of PI4KA for genome replication. ds encoding GFP-PI4KA (A and B) or GFP-PI4KB (C) were fixed and stained with antibodies against dsRNA as a marker of infection (A) or 3AB as a RO marker (B and C) nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) EMCV uses the ER-localized PI4KA for replication. a recombinant EMCV bearing an HA-tag in the nonstructural protein 2C. 2C-HA and 3AB signals greatly overlapped (S3C Fig) in non-infected cells, Sec13 showed mainly a typical perinuclear localization. in EMCV-infected cells it appeared dispersed, but without significantly colocalizing with 3AB. images acquired with higher magnification revealed that most of 3AB was in close contact with ER tubules. myc-tagged EMCV nonstructural proteins 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3AB, 3C and 3D were individually co-expressed together with HA-PI4KA in Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells. autoradiography analysis showed that HA-PI4KA was specifically co-purified by 3A and 3AB, but not by the other viral proteins. EMCV 3A and 3AB-myc were both localized throughout the cytoplasm and at discrete punctate structures. EMCV 3A is the viral protein responsible for engaging PI4KA in replication. only EMCV 3A and 3AB can interact with PI4KA. Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-PI4KA and either myc-tagged EMCV 3A or 3AB-myc. one day later, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation using two different anti-myc antibodies. the intracellular PI4P distribution changed from a perinuclear, Golgi-like pattern in mock-infected cells to dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in EMCV-infected cells. quantitative analysis of the fluorescent PI4P signals revealed a marked increase in intracellular PI4P in infected cells. cells were mock-infected or infected with EMCV-2C-HA. at 5.5 h p.i., cells were treated with DMSO or 1 M BF738735. cells were fixed and stained for intracellular PI4P and HA using specific antibodies. the pleckstrin-homology domain (PH) can sense and specifically bind PI4P lipids. enteroviruses generate PI4P-enriched membranes to recruit OSBP. this in turn exchanges PI4P for cholesterol at ROs [17,18,54] -1 time-of-addition experiments excluded possibility that OSBP was involved in early steps in the virus life cycle. similar results were obtained when using 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), another established OSBP ligand. colocalization of OSBP was determined by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients for at least 15 cells for each condition. cells were transfected with empty vector or plasmids encoding myc-tagged EMCV 2B, 3A or 3AB. one day later, cells were fixed and co-stained with antibodies against OSBP and endogenous OSBP. myc-tagged EMCV 3A-, 3AB- or 2B-myc were ectopically expressed in Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells. recruitment of endogenous OSBP was analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis. in non-infected cells, cholesterol localizes at endosomes in perinuclear area. EMCV ROs acquire cholesterol through PI4KA and OSBP activities. at 4 h p.i., cells were treated with DMSO, 10 M AL-9 or 3nM OSW-1. after 2 h, cells were fixed, followed by staining with antibodies against 3AB or filipin for cholesterol detection. 4KB significantly reduced EMCV infection measured by end-point titration of progeny virus production. PI4KA is essential for cardiovirus replication, measured by end-point titration of progeny virus production. bars represent mean values of triplicates standard error of the means (SEM) to omit the step of virus attachment and cell entry, EMCV RNA was in vitro transcribed and subsequently transfected in cells depleted of PI4KA by siRNAs. coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was previously shown to hijack the PI4KB. EMCV replication was efficiently inhibited by AL-9 in a dose-dependent manner. dipyridamole, a well-established inhibitor of EMCV RNA replication, was included here as positive control. PI4KA localizes to EMCV replication sites. despite repeated efforts, we were unable to detect the endogenous kinase by immunofluorescence staining in any of the cell lines tested. the small picornaviral protein 3A and its precursor 3AB are membrane-associated and play key roles in viral RNA replication. we compared the staining of PI4KA to that of 3AB in infected cells. tag was introduced after the second amino acid, leaving the 2B-2C cleavage site intact (S3A Fig), and did not impair virus replication (S3B Fig). first, we checked whether 2C-HA and 3AB are present on the same membranes by immunofluorescence microscopy. however, neither TGN46 nor GM130 were present at 2C-HA-positive structures. 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3AB, 3C and 3D were individually co-expressed together with HA-PI4KA. cells were mock-infected or infected with EMCV-2C-HA (A-C) or EMCV (D-F) at MOI 10 h later, cells were fixed and co-stained. autoradiography analysis showed HA-PI4KA was specifically co-purified by 3A and 3AB, but not by the other viral proteins. EMCV 3A was co-expressed with HA-PI4KA and subjected to affinity purification using either monoclonal or polyclonal anti-myc antibodies. a diffuse band just below 17 KDa appears to co-purify with EMCV 3A when HA-PI4KA is co-expressed. EMCV 3A- and 3AB-myc were localized throughout the cytoplasm and at discrete punctate structures. 2B-myc was also distributed in punctae throughout the cytoplasm, but failed to recruit PI4KA. only EMCV 3A and 3AB can interact with PI4KA. cells were cotransfected with the HA-PI4KA expression construct. cells were fixed and co-stained with antibodies against myc and HA. the next day, cells were fixed and co-stained with antibodies against myc and HA. PI4P homeostasis is affected upon EMCV infection. EMCV alters the distribution of intracellular PI4P lipids. PI4P homeostasis is affected upon EMCV infection. PI4KB inhibitor BF738735 infected cells with EMCV-2C-HA. PI4KB phenotype remained unaltered in non-infected cells. OSBP supports EMCV genome replication downstream of PI4KA. CV is sensitive to itraconazole, which we identified to be an OSBP inhibitor [17], and that cholesterol shuttling is important for EMCV replication [54] we also reasoned that in EMCV-infected cells one purpose of PI4P lipids might be to recruit OSBP to replication membranes. we efficiently reduced OSBP expression in cells in which OSBP was depleted compared to control-treated cells. cells were frozen-thawed to release intracellular virus particles. total virus titers were determined by endpoint titration. OSBP knockdown efficiency was verified by western blot analysis. the crop panels at the bottom depict enlargements of boxed areas. Means were statistically compared using either unpaired t tests (A and B) or the Mann\u2013Whitney test (D). ically expressed in cells expressing 3A and 3AB, OSBP was redistributed in punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm. however, OSBP remained localized at the Golgi and did not localize at 2C-positive punctae. a diverse array of cellular organelles can be remodeled into viral replication structures. picornaviruses from the genus Cardiovirus are thought to replicate at modified Golgi membranes [15,45,57], while flavivirus HCV replicates on a membranous web originated from the ER [58]. how picornaviruses from the genus Cardiovirus build their ROs is currently unknown. cardiovirus-induced membranes consist of perinuclear clusters of heterogeneous single- and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) the authors observed induction of autophagy and accumulation of cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles upon EMCV infection. PI4KA was redistributed in EMCV-infected cells to discrete cytoplasmic structures that also contained the viral protein 3AB. the majority of PI4KA-positive punctae were detected in close proximity to viral dsRNA, but did not completely overlap with dsRNA. we hypothesize that in cardiovirus infection, PI4P may serve to recruit OSBP and cholesterol to viral replication sites. PI4P and cholesterol are vital for the global organization of EMCV ROs. a potential task of PI4P in virus replication may be linked to the PI(4,5)P2 synthesis pathway, since PI4P is the major precursor of PI(4,5)P2 lipids. EMCV 3A is a small protein (88 amino acids) of unknown structure. expression of 3A alone was sufficient for PI4KA recruitment in intact cells. enteroviruses and kobuviruses recruit PI4KB to ROs also via their 3A protein. equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV, member of Aphthovirus genus, which is prototype by FMDV) equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV, member of Aphthovirus genus, which is prototype by FMDV) equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV, member of Aphthovirus genus, which is prototype by FMDV) equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV flaviviruses DENV and WNV, representing a sister genus to that of HCV, do not rely on either PI4KA or PI4KB [23,78]. phylogenetic pattern is indicative of relatively recent emergence of EMCV-specific target properties. NS5B has also been suggested to be involved in the interaction with PI4KA [24,46]. a common pathway is used by different RNA viruses that either only moderately diverged (e.g. different species of same genus) or converged on a host target while diverging profoundly (different families) PI4P lipids serve as a membrane anchor for OSBP in cardiovirus infection. a potential task of PI4P in virus replication may be linked to the PI(4,5)P2 synthesis pathway, since PI4P is the major precursor of PI(4,5)P2 lipids. exploitation of PI4K-OSBP pathway by HCV correlates with positive curvature. PI4KA is a novel interaction partner of EMCV proteins 3A and its precursor 3AB. enteroviruses and kobuviruses recruit PI4KB to ROs via their 3A protein. picornavirus EMCV and flavivirus HCV converged to recruit a common lipid-modifying pathway in building replication sites. both EMCV and HCV express a viral protein dedicated to recruitment of PI4KA, in order to induce a PI4P-rich environment at the replication sites. members of the Cardiovirus genus hijack the ER-localized PI4KA. equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV, member of Aphthovirus genus, which is prototype by FMDV) and hepatitis A virus (Hepatovirus genus) seem to replicate independent of both PI4KB and PI4KA. only viruses characterized so far with respect to this function are depicted. the tree branches are of arbitrary scale, while the branching of picornaviruses reflects the topology of maximum-likelihood RdRp-based tree according to Gorbalenya & Lauber, 2010 [80].
