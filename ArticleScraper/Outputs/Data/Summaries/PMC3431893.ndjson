{"summary": "influenza viruses have circulated in seasonal (H3N2, H1N1) and avian (including H5N1) forms. this has become the dominant strain producing an illness that is transmitted in the same way as seasonal influenza, which in most cases is mild. by the end of 2009 many countries were still reporting disease activity and an impact on health-care services. a combined influenza A&B antigen screen on a nasopharyngeal swab was positive, and an additional swab and a blood sample were sent for further confirmatory testing. the patient was prescribed oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily for five days, azithromycin 500 mg daily and paracetamol 500 mg three times daily for three days. by the next morning, the patient's fever and sore throat had subsided and the index case had considered the H1N1 situation before commencing his travels to Canada. the world health organization (WHO) did not recommend restricting travel. the patient's route to Canada took him through London (34 cases reported in the UK at that time) and Toronto (15 cases in Ontario) to Saskatoon (2 cases) public health physicians, occupational health physicians and hospital clinicians dealing directly with the case. a central news release was provided to staff and students on the case. the patient was a 48 year-old male academic public health physician who had just returned to the middle east. a combined influenza A&B antigen screen on a nasopharyngeal swab was positive. an additional swab and a blood sample were sent for further confirmatory testing. the patient had to make some important difficult decisions regarding his state of health and his work deadlines. the index case had considered the H1N1 situation before commencing his travels to Canada. at that time, the world health organization (WHO) did not recommend restricting travel. however, some individual national authorities were advising against non-essential travel. public health physicians, occupational health physicians and hospital clinicians dealing directly with the case were briefed on hygiene and infection control procedures. a central news release was provided to staff and students on H1N1 reiterating the importance of hygiene in regards to limitation of transmission. there were no reports of H1N1 infection in any taxi driver in the 2 weeks following the journey. standard and droplet precautions should be in place [8] the new H1N1 case in town appeared daily and reflected public anxiety. the media can play an important role in allaying the fears of the community. the installation of thermal scanners at points of entry has their limitations. the lack of further transmission from this first case in the UAE may be a combination of good and effective public health intervention, or serendipity. the number of cases globally declined."}
