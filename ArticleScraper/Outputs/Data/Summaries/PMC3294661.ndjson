{"summary": "respiratory problems are a major cause of mortality in swine herds. 53.7% of nursery pig deaths and 60.1% of grower-finisher pig deaths attributed to respiratory problems. Bordetella bronchiseptica is widespread in swine populations. the majority of virulence gene expression is regulated by a two-component sensory transduction system encoded by the bvg locus. this locus comprises a histidine kinase sensor protein, BvgS, and a DNA-binding response regulator protein, BvgA. in response to environmental cues, such as temperature, MgSO4, or nicotinic acid concentrations, BvgAS controls expression of a spectrum of Bvgi phase is characterized by the expression of a subset of the Bvg+ phase genes (such as fhaB and prn) and Bvgi-specific genes (such as bipA and bcfA) many respiratory pathogens are highly contagious and can be transmitted from host to host by direct and indirect means. experimental direct and airborne transmission of B. bronchiseptica has been documented (4, 35) KM22 was isolated from a swine herd with atrophic rhinitis. all strains were grown at 37\u00b0C on Bordet-Gengou (BG) agar. KM22 was used for construction of strains TN23, TN30 and TN31. mutation was introduced into pSMS3 using primers R570Hfor and R570Hrev (Table 1) and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) the modified bvgS gene was cloned into pDONR201. pSMS26 was recombined with pABB-CRS2 (31), which confers sucrose sensitivity. bvgS-for ACCTCGCCAACAACAATCTCG bvgS-rev ATCTGCTGCCATGCCGGTATCTGC bvgS-FA-for GAGCTCTTAGGTTTTTTGAAATCCAGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGC ACTGGTTCATGA CGTTGTAGAACAGCGACGAATG cheZ TGATGGCGTCCATCATCAT flgB CTGATACCGCCTGCCTGCCTTAC GCTGTCCATCATCATCAT bcfA GCTGTCCATCATCATCATCAT flgB CTGATACCGCCTGCCTCTTAC bcfA GCTGTCCATCATCATCATCATCAT. a 1,046-bp DNA fragment covering the region immediately 5\u2032of bvgS and extending to codon 7 was amplified by PCR using primers bvgS-FA-for and bvgS-FA-rev. the insert of pTN31, containing the upstream region of bvgS, was cloned into pCR2.1 (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) via SacI and Xba pTN42 was amplified from pTN42 by PCR using primers TN42-for and TN42-rev. the insert of pTN46 was excised by SacI and AvrII digestion. pTN50 was introduced into E. coli SM10pir (32) and transconjugated into KM22. TN30 was selected for subsequent use by growing wild-type KM22 and TN30 on BG agar and BG agar containing MgSO4 and evaluating colony morphology and hemolytic activity. pTN15, carrying the bvgS gene encoding the bvgS-C3 mutation R570H, served as the template for use with mutagenesis primers T733Mfor and T733Mrev. pSMS95 was introduced into SM10pir (32) and transconjugated into KM22. a single colony, designated TN31, was selected for subsequent use. TN31 was further confirmed by PCR amplification of the bvgS gene. each biological replicate was reverse transcribed using 300 ng of random oligonucleotide hexamers and SuperScript III RTase. the resulting cDNA was diluted 1:100, and 1 l of this dilution was used in qPCR mixtures containing 300 nM primers and 2 SYBR green PCR master mix. reactions without reverse transcriptase were performed. RPMI medium lacking phenol red, with 5% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate, was then used to replace the DMEM. bacterial suspensions were centrifuged onto the macrophages at 250 g for 5 min. cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 4 h. strains KM22, TN23 (Bvg+), TN31 (Bvgi) and TN30 (Bvg) were cultured on BG agar supplemented with 10% sheep's blood at 37\u00b0C for 40 h. aliquot of inoculum for each strain was plated on BG agar plates. pigs were inoculated intranasally at 1 week of age with 1 ml (0.5 ml/nostril) of a bacterial suspension of strains KM22, TN23 (Bvg+), TN30 (Bvg) or with 1 ml of sterile PBS. for both trials, bacterial colonization of the nasal cavity was quantified by nasal swabs on days 1, 3, and 5 and by nasal washes at the indicated trachea washes were performed by placing a segment of trachea approximately 8 cm in length in a 15-ml centrifuge tube with 5 ml of PBS and shaking vigorously. dilutions were made from nasal swab fluids, nasal and tracheal washes, and lung lavages. linear combinations of the least squares means estimates for log10 CFU were used in a priori comparisons to test for a significant (P 0.05) effect of the bacterial challenge strains. a 5% level of significance (P 0.05) was used to assess statistical differences. the atrophic rhinitis score is the sum of the four turbinate atrophy scores and ranges from 0 to 16. transmission experiments in swine were cultured on BG agar. a control group of 8 pigs were intranasally inoculated with 106 CFU of KM22. two pigs were intranasally inoculated with 106 CFU of KM22. a control group of 8 pigs were intranasally inoculated with 1 ml sterile PBS. KM22 was isolated from a swine herd with atrophic rhinitis. it was used for construction of strains TN23, TN30, and TN31. all strains were grown at 37\u00b0C on Bordet-Gengou (BG) agar. the modified bvgS gene was cloned into pDONR201. pSMS26 was digested with pABB-CRS2 (31), which confers sucrose sensitivity. pSMS29 was introduced into SM10pir (32) and transconjugated into KM22. a single colony, designated TN23, was selected for subsequent use. bvgS-for ACCTCGCCAACAATCTCG bvgS-rev ATCTGCTGCCATGCCGGTATCTGC bvgS-FA-for GAGCTCTTAGGTTTTTTGAAATCCAGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGC CGCAGGATTTCC GCCCACCACGTCCATCATCAT flgB CTGATACCGCCTGCCTGCCTTAC GCTGTCCATCATCATCATCATCAT bcfA GCTGTCCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCAT a 1,046-bp DNA fragment covering the region immediately 5\u2032of bvgS and extending to codon 7 was amplified by PCR using primers bvgS-FA-for and bvgS-FA-rev. the insert of pTN31, containing the upstream region of bvgS, was cloned into pCR2.1 (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to obtain pTN39. pTN46 was excised by SacI and AvrII digestion and cloned into SacI-AvrII-digested allelic exchange vector pSS4245 (10, 19) to create pTN50. pTN50 was introduced into E. coli SM10pir (32) and transconjugated into KM22 as previously described (10, 19) phase-locked phenotype was obtained by growing wild-type KM22 and TN30 on BG agar and BG agar containing MgSO4. TN31, the Bvgi phase-locked derivative of KM22, was constructed by generating the bvgS-I1 (14) mutation T733M using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. pTN15, carrying the bvgS gene encoding the a single KM22 or TN30 colony was stab inoculated into SSM or SSM and MgSO4 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for at least 24 h. a single KM22 or TN30 colony, designated TN31, was selected for subsequent use. TN31 was further confirmed by PCR amplification of the bvgS gene and DNA sequence analysis. cDNA was diluted 1:100 and 1 l of this dilution was used in qPCR mixtures containing 300 nM primers and 2 SYBR green PCR master mix. reactions without reverse transcriptase were performed to confirm lack of DNA contamination. RPMI medium lacking phenol red, with 5% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate was then used to replace the DMEM. bacterial suspensions were centrifuged onto the macrophages at 250 g for 5 min. cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 4 h. L2 cells were then trypsinized using 0.125% trypsin and incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. the total volume of each well was then brought up to 1 ml with growth medium. Dilutions were then plated on BG plates containing streptomycin. pigs were inoculated intranasally at 1 week of age with 1 ml (0.5 ml/nostril) of a bacterial suspension of strains KM22, TN23 (Bvg+), TN30 (Bvg) or with 1 ml of sterile PBS. for both trials, bacterial colonization of the nasal cavity was quantified by nasal swabs on days 1, 3, and 5 and by nasal washes at the indicated al washes were performed by placing a segment of trachea approximately 8 cm in length in a 15-ml centrifuge tube with 5 ml of PBS. dilutions were made from nasal swab fluids, nasal and tracheal washes, and lung lavages. the limit of detection was 10 CFU/ml. the least squares means estimates for log10 CFU were used in a priori comparisons to test for a significant (P 0.05) effect of the bacterial challenge strains. a 5% level of significance (P 0.05) was used to assess statistical differences. swine strains KM22 and TN23 (Bvg+) were cultured on BG agar supplemented with 10% sheep's blood at 37\u00b0C for 40 h. an aliquot of inoculum for each strain was plated on BG agar plates, with and without 50 mM MgSO4. two pigs were intranasally inoculated with 106 CFU of KM22. two pigs were intranasally inoculated with 106 CFU of TN23 (Bvg+) and placed in a pen together in a second isolation room. pigs served as the \u201cprimary-challenged\u201d pigs in the study. isogenic mutants were grown under nonmodulating conditions at 37\u00b0C. nineteen genes that have been shown in RB50 to be differentially expressed in response to phase modulation were chosen for analysis. the three isogenic mutants have unique patterns of gene expression. expression levels of the other eight genes analyzed did not differ significantly from the wild-type KM22. expression levels of the other eight genes analyzed did not differ significantly from the wild-type KM22. expression of all 19 genes analyzed in each isogenic mutant was found to be similar to that reported for the corresponding isogenic mutants in the well-characterized laboratory strain, RB50. a single colony of either wild-type KM22 or TN30 was stab inoculated into soft-agar plates containing SSM or SSM supplemented with 50 mM MgSO4. motile organisms display outward migration from the point of inoculation. the best-characterized phenotypes of the Bvg phase are motility and the expression of flagellar synthesis genes. KM22 and the isogenic phase-locked mutant, TN23, showed a high level of cytotoxicity. the cytotoxic activity of both KM22 and TN23 was statistically lower than KM22 and similar to medium alone. the decreased expression of some TTSS genes in strains TN31 and TN30 may have resulted in the decreased cytotoxicity. the ability of B. bronchiseptica to adhere to epithelial surfaces is required for the initiation and establishment of infection. the BvgAS system regulates a number of genes whose products have been postulated or directly shown to function as adhesins. KM22, TN23 (Bvg+) and TN31 (Bvg) had a similar level of adherence to L2 cells. no clinical signs were observed in piglets from groups inoculated with TN30 (Bvg) or PBS. the B. bronchiseptica phase-locked mutant, TN23, was recovered from the nasal cavity in numbers similar to those for wild-type KM22. axis indicates the mean CFU expressed as the log10 mean standard errors (error bars) the degree of atrophic rhinitis was evaluated by determining the mean turbinate atrophy score from piglets inoculated with KM22, TN23 (Bvg+), TN30 (Bvg), or PBS on days 7, 14, 31, and 57 postinfection. only piglets infected with either KM22 or TN23 (Bvg+ 0 (0) 0 (0) KM22 (BvgWT) 2.25 (0\u20134) 2.375 (0\u20139) TN23 (Bvg+) 3.75 (2\u20135) 2.25 (0\u20139) TN30 (Bvg) 0 (0) 0 (0) 31 PBS control 1.5 (1\u20132) 0 (0) KM22 (Bvg+) 4.25 (1\u20138) 0.625 (0\u20131.5) TN23 (Bvg+) 2.0 (0\u20133) 0.875 (0 TN23 (Bvg+)- and KM22-challenged pigs were typical of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia, characterized by suppurative bronchopneumonia that is gradually replaced by fibroplasia. no clinical signs were observed in piglets inoculated with KM22 or receiving PBS. pigs were inoculated intranasally with KM22 (open triangles) or TN31, a KM22 Bvgi isogenic mutant. the swine respiratory tract was quantified on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 postinoculation. a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. significantly lower CFU levels were recovered from the trachea and lungs of TN31 (Bvgi)-inoculated pigs than from the trachea and lungs of pigs infected with KM22. peak CFU recovered from the trachea and lungs was delayed until day 28 in pigs infected with TN31 compared to day 14 in KM22-inoculated pigs. piglets infected with lesions detected on day 56 were suppurative bronchopneumonia, also consistent with Bordetella infection. the colonization and pathology data from each of the two trials together suggest that the full activation of the BvgAS regulatory system is required for maximum colonization and disease severity in swine. groups of 16 1-week-old piglets were intranasally inoculated with KM22, TN23 (Bvg+) or 1 ml sterile PBS. at 3 days postinoculation two nave pigs were added to each room to serve as direct contacts. a Bvg+ phase-locked mutant can transmit directly from pig-to-pig when animals are comingled. phenotypic modulation of the Bvg+ phase is not required for direct transmission in swine. b Data are reported as the number of contact pigs positive out of a possible of two pigs for a strain of B. bronchiseptica. two pigs were intranasally inoculated with KM22 and placed in a pen within an isolator room. after 2 days, three nave pigs, serving as direct contacts, were added to the same pen. nave pigs were placed in pen B, serving as indirect contacts, indicated by \u201cI\u201d. necropsy of all pigs was performed on day 25. pigsc KM22 (BvgWT) TN23 (Bvg+) Primary Direct Indirect Primary Direct Indirect 4 2/2 2/3 0/5 2/2 3/3 0/5 7 2/2 2/3 0/5 2/2 3/3 0/5 12 2/2 2/3 1/5 2/2 3/3 1/5 18 2/2 3/3 2/5 2/2 3/3 3/5 25 2/2 3/3 3/3 5/5 2/2 3/3 5/5 a Pigs were euthanized on b Data are reported as the number of contact pigs positive out of a possible of two pigs for a strain of B. bronchiseptica. we constructed a series of isogenic phase-locked mutants in the virulent swine strain KM22. expression levels of the other eight genes analyzed did not differ significantly from the wild-type KM22. expression of all 19 genes analyzed in each isogenic mutant of KM22 was found to be similar to that reported for the corresponding isogenic mutants in the well-characterized laboratory strain, RB50. a single colony of either wild-type KM22 or TN30 was stab inoculated into soft-agar plates containing SSM or SSM supplemented with 50 mM MgSO4. a single colony of either KM22 or TN30, as indicated on the left, was stab inoculated into SSM or SSM supplemented with 50 mM MgSO4. a well-characterized function of the Bordetella type III secretion system (TTSS) is killing of mammalian cells (30, 39, 40) the BvgAS system would also regulate TTSS in KM22. both KM22 and the isogenic phase-locked mutant, TN23, displayed a high level of cytotoxicity. KM22, TN23 (Bvg+), TN31 (Bvgi) and TN30 (Bvg) have similar levels of adherence to L2 cells. the ability of the phase-locked mutants to adhere to rat lung epithelial cells in vitro was compared to that of the wild-type strain. piglets were intranasally inoculated with KM22, TN23 (Bvg+), TN30 (Bvg) or 1 ml sterile PBS. no clinical signs were observed in piglets from groups inoculated with TN30 (Bvg+) the degree of atrophic rhinitis was evaluated by determining the mean turbinate atrophy score from piglets inoculated with KM22, TN23 (Bvg+), TN30 (Bvg+) on any of the days examined. only piglets infected with either KM22 or TN23 (Bvg+) had any evidence of significant nasal turbinate atrophy. ropsy Group Mean turbinate atrophy score (range) Mean % pneumonia (range) 7 PBS control 0 (0) 0 (0) KM22 (BvgWT) 2.25 (1\u20134) 1.15 (0.1\u20132) TN23 (Bvg+) 1.5 (0\u20134) 1.275 (0.1\u20133) TN30 (Bvg) 0 (0) 0 (0) 14 PBS control 0 (0) 0 (0) KM22 (Bvg+) 2. 625% of lungs affected compared to 2.75% of lungs affected in KM22-infected pigs. only one out the four pigs infected with TN23 (Bvg+) exhibited pneumonia. three out the four pigs infected with KM22 exhibited pneumonia. FU recovered from pigs infected with TN31 (Bvgi) was approximately two logs less than that from pigs infected with KM22. peak in number of CFU recovered from the nasal cavity of KM22-infected pigs was delayed compared to that of KM22-infected pigs. a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. colonization of the trachea and lung was evaluated on days 7, 14, 28, and 56 postinfection. KM22 was able to persist in significantly high numbers through day 56. two TN31 (Bvgi)-infected pigs displayed mild lesions on days 7 and 56. microscopically, the lesions were consistent with Bordetella infection. lesions detected on day 56 were suppurative bronchopneumonia, also consistent with Bordetella infection. a BvgAS system capable of modulation between the Bvg+ and Bvg phases is not required for transmission in swine. to assess direct transmission, groups of 16 1-week-old piglets were intranasally inoculated with KM22, TN23 (Bvg+) or 1 ml sterile PBS. B. bronchiseptica was recovered from the lung of one direct-contact pig from the group inoculated with KM22. neither of the direct-contact pigs from the group inoculated with TN23 (Bvg+) nor the direct-contact pigs from the group inoculated with TN23 (Bvg+) together, the data demonstrate that a Bvg+ phase-locked mutant can transmit directly from pig-to-pig when animals are pigs were euthanized on day 87 of the experiment, 84-days after first contact with primary challenged pigs. a second trial was designed to test whether the Bvg+ phase is sufficient for both direct and indirect transmission in swine. two pigs were intranasally inoculated with KM22 and placed in a pen within an isolator room. two pigs were intranasally inoculated with the B. bronchiseptica strain tested, placed in pen A, and served as primary-challenged pigs, indicated by \u201cP\u201d after 2 days, three nave pigs, serving as a direct contacts, indicated by \u201cD,\u201d were added to pen A. necropsy of all pigs was performed on day 25. both the wild type and the Bvg+ phase-locked mutant were equally capable of transmission in swine by both direct and indirect contact. phenotypic modulation of Bvg+ B. bronchiseptica is not required for direct or indirect transmission in swine. pigs were euthanized 25 days after initial contact with primary-challenged pigs. data are reported as the number of contact pigs positive out of a possible of two pigs for a strain of B. bronchiseptica. the development of vaccines with improved efficacy is hindered by the absence of definitive data related to virulence mechanisms of B. bronchiseptica in swine. TN23 (Bvg+), TN31 (Bvgi) and TN30 (Bvg) were never recovered from any respiratory tract site at any time point examined. the Bvg+ phase-locked mutant, TN23, was indistinguishable from the wild type and caused similar disease severity. the ability to modulate pathology during acute infection may be biologically beneficial for B. bronchiseptica. TN31 was recovered at significantly lower levels than the wild-type KM22. this is in direct contrast to the in vitro data, where we found no difference in the adherence capability between KM22 and TN31. the decreased bacterial burdens throughout the respiratory tract showed the ability of swine to clear Bvgi phase B. bronchiseptica more rapidly. pigs infected with TN31 displayed limited to no disease and few turbinate and lung lesions. only pigs infected with KM22 or TN23 (Bvg+) displayed coughing and sneezing. a critical threshold of colonization is required to cause clinical signs of disease, such as sneezing and coughing. B. bronchiseptica was recovered from direct-contact pigs in the first study. in the second study, B. bronchiseptica was not recovered until 7 days postcontact. the increase in the number of days for direct transmission to occur likely reflects the ratio of primary-infected pigs to nave pigs. the fully active phase is not required for respiratory infection and host-to-host transmission of B. bronchiseptica."}
