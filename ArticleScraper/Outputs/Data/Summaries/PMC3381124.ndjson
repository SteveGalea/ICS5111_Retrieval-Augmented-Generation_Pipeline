{"summary": "the primordial CEA gene family in mammals consisted of five genes. most of the heterogeneity of CEA families is derived from members that are closely related to CEACAM1. CEACAM1-related genes can be traced back to the last common ancestor of fishes and mammals (1). orthologous genes for this CEACAM subgroup were identified in placental mammals, marsupials, and monotreme platypus (1). the group of orthologous CEACAMs appears to be restricted to the mammalian lineage (1). the TM covers the sensory hair cells of the inner ear and translates sound-induced vibrations to shearing of hair cell stereocilia. the TM is an indispensable component of the mechanoelectrical transduction that leads to amplification of sound-induced vibrations of the basilar membrane. monoclonal and monoclonal murine anti-murine and anti-human CEACAM16 antibodies were generated by genetic immunization. the monoclonal anti-murine antibody 9D5 was purified by protein G-Sepharose affinity chromatography. the temporal bone was collected within 12 h after the subject's death and placed on ice. RT-PCR was performed using the LightCycler technology (Roche Diagnostics) and gene-specific primers (supplemental Table 1) using standard conditions. crossing points were used to calculate relative mRNA levels present in the RNA samples after -actin mRNA normalization. resulting male chimeras were backcrossed to BALB/c females to identify germ line transmission of the targeted allele and to produce mice heterozygous for the null mutation. eacam16/ and ceacam16+/+ strains were established and maintained at the animal facilities of Gene Center and the Walter Brendel Center of Experimental Medicine, University of Munich, Germany. hearing threshold was defined as the lowest SPL that produced a potential visually distinct from background noise. the cubic 2f1 f2 DPOAE was measured for primary tone f1 and f2 frequency (Hz) f2 = 1.24f1 and primary tone sound pressure level (dB SPL) L2 = L1 10 dB. the cochlea and vestibular organ were fixed for 30\u201345 min in 4% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-buffered formaldehyde at room temperature, rinsed in PBS, decalcified for 24 h in 0.18 m citric acid, 0.44 m EDTA pH 7.1, at 4 \u00b0C, and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 \u00b0C. decalcification of cochleae from adult mice was performed using Rapid Bone Decalcifier medium (Eurobio, Fisher) for 15 min to 2 h. 10-m cryosections were mounted on SuperFrost Ultra Plus\u00ae slides. probes were transcribed from the pCMV-SPORT6 vector containing the 5\u2032-half of the murine CEACAM16 cDNA. sections were hybridized with 1:50 diluted riboprobes in 1 hybridization buffer (Roche Diagnostics) at 64 \u00b0C overnight, washed twice in 0.1% saline-sodium citrate buffer, and blocked with 1 Blocking Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) pB1 and pAPtag-5 vectors provide a COOH-terminal signal sequence for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchorage. cells were transfected with 2 g of VV1, pB1 or pAPtag-5 expression plasmids. cells were harvested by pipetting, washed in PBS, and resuspended by repeated pipetting in 2.5 ml of PBS. the size of aggregates consisting of CEACAM16-expressing cells was determined using a microscope fitted with a graded ocular. expression levels of CEACAM16 domains on HEK293T cells were quantified after incubation with anti-c-myc antibody (100 g/ml) and FITC-coupled goat anti-mouse Ig antibody (75 g/ml) the cell culture supernatant (with 5% FBS) of cells transfected with expression constructs for secreted CEACAM16 variants was centrifuged as above and stored at 20 \u00b0C. samples were heated in the presence or absence of 60 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C and stored at 20 \u00b0C until Western blot analyses were performed. cell lines and antibodies HeLa, BOSC23, and HEK293T were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO2. monoclonal rabbit anti-tectorin antibody (MCA2200; Serotech), mouse anti-actin antibody (clone AC-74; Sigma), rabbit polyclo RNA was fused with RNAlater\u00ae (Ambion, Applied Biosystems) from fresh murine tissue or tissue stored in RNAlater at 4 \u00b0C. the inner ear was microdissected, and RNA was isolated using the TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Invitrogen) resulting targeting construct lacks a 6.8-kb region that comprises exons 2\u20134 and part of exon 5 of Ceacam16 that was replaced by a 1.7-kb neo cassette. resulting targeting construct lacks a 6.8-kb region that comprises exons 2\u20134 and part of exon 5 of Ceacam16 that was replaced by a 1.7-kb neo cassette. the established Ceacam16 knock-out and wild-type strains were genotyped using standard PCR reaction conditions. mice were under anesthesia using ketamine (75 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight) ABR waves from individual ears were measured and analyzed for 10 to +85-db SPL stimulation level. a flat curve will have a signal derivative of 0.

RT-PCR was performed using the Reverse Transcription System\u00ae (Promega) followed by PCR (25 l total volume) with 1 20 of the reverse transcription (RT) reaction and gene-specific primers (supplemental Table 1) using standard conditions. crossing points (Cp) were used to calculate relative mRNA levels present in the RNA samples after -actin mRNA normalization. resulting male chimeras were backcrossed to males to identify germ line transmission. resulting male chimeras were backcrossed to BALB/c females to identify germ line transmission of the targeted allele and to produce mice heterozygous for the null mutation. hearing threshold was defined as the lowest SPL that produced a potential visually distinct from background noise. the cubic 2f1 f2 DPOAE was measured for primary tone f1 and f2 frequency (Hz) f2 = 1.24f1 and primary tone sound pressure level (dB SPL) L2 = L1 10 dB. the cochlea and vestibular organ were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cervical dislocation. the cochlea and vestibular organ were quickly removed en bloc. the vestibular organ were fixed for 2 h in 2% freshly prepared formaldehyde, 125 mm sucrose in 100 mm PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature followed by overnight incubation with 25% sucrose with 1 mm protease inhibitor Pefabloc SC (Roche Diagnostics) in PBS. sections were transcribed from the pCMV-SPORT6 vector containing the 5\u2032-half of the murine CEACAM16 cDNA. sections were hybridized with 1:50 diluted riboprobes in 1 hybridization buffer (Roche Diagnostics) at 64 \u00b0C overnight, washed twice in 0.1% saline-sodium citrate buffer, and blocked with 1 Blocking Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) in 100 mm Tris-HCl deletion constructs were generated in the VV1, pB1 and pAPtag-5 vectors. pB1 and pAPtag-5 also provide a COOH-terminal signal sequence for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchorage. cells were transfected with 2 g of VV1, pB1 or pAPtag-5 expression plasmids. antibodies were visualized using the ImmPRESS anti-mouse Ig kit (Vector Laboratories) the size of aggregates consisting of CEACAM16-expressing cells was determined using a microscope fitted with a graded ocular. expression levels of CEACAM16 domains on HEK293T cells were quantified after incubation with anti-c-myc antibody (100 g/ml) followed by FITC-coupled goat anti-mouse I the cell culture supernatant (with 5% FBS) of cells transfected with expression constructs was centrifuged at 20,800 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. samples were heated in the presence or absence of 60 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C and stored at 20 \u00b0C until Western blot analyses were performed. cell lines and antibodies HeLa, BOSC23, and HEK293T were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS Gold); 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere and 5% CO2. monoclonal rabbit anti-tectorin antibody (MCA2200; Serotech), mouse anti-actin antibody (clone AC-74; Sigma), RNA was perfused with RNAlater\u00ae (Ambion, Applied Biosystems) from fresh murine tissue or tissue stored in RNAlater at 4 \u00b0C. RNA was isolated with the RNeasy\u00ae Plus Mini Kit including a DNA removal step (Qiagen) resulting targeting construct lacks a 6.8-kb region that comprises exons 2\u20134 and part of exon 5 of Ceacam16 that was replaced by a 1.7-kb neo cassette. resulting targeting construct lacks a 6.8-kb region that comprises exons 2\u20134 and part of exon 5 of Ceacam16 that was replaced by a 1.7-kb neo cassette. the established Ceacam16 knock-out and wild-type strains were genotyped using standard PCR reaction conditions. mice were under anesthesia using ketamine (75 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (5 mg/kg body weight) ABR waves from individual ears were measured and analyzed for 10 to +85-db SPL stimulation level. a flat curve will have a signal derivative of 0. Immunohistology Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by cervical dislocation. al was achieved by heating to 95 \u00b0C of the tissue sections in Target Retrieval Solution, pH 9 (DakoCytomation) sections were reacted with the biotinylated anti-CEACAM16 antibody 9D5 (4 g/ml) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 \u00b0C followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin. primary antibodies were detected with either Cy3-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit Ig antibody (0.35 g/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or Alexa-488 conjugated goat-anti-mouse Ig antibody (1:1500; Molecular Probes) sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and photographed using the cellSens Dimension\u00ae Software (Olympus) cells were transfected with 2 g of VV1, pB1, or pAPtag-5 expression plasmids and 3 l of FuGENE 6 in 1 ml of media. cells were cloned into vector pCMV-SPORT6 (sequences were deposited at GenBankTM with accession numbers NM_001039213 and NM_001033419) 100 l of the cell suspension were pelleted onto glass slides (SuperFrost Plus\u00ae) the slides were dried for 12\u201318 h at room temperature and stored at 20 \u00b0C. cells were incubated with 2 g/ml mouse anti-human CEACAM16 9D5 or 10 g/ml mouse anti-c-myc antibody. pdb2qsqA-0 and pdb1l6zA-0 for CEACAM16 N1 and CEACAM16 N2, pdb1l6zA-0 for CEACAM16 A, pdb1cs6A-2, and pdb2om5A-0 for CEACAM16 B. cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding GPI-linked or secreted CEACAM16 ween 20 (Roth) containing 5% blotting-grade milk powder (Roth) antigen detection was performed using anti-CEACAM16 (5 g/ml), anti-c-myc (1.6 g/ml) or anti-actin antibodies (2.5 g/ml) in PBS-T with 5% milk powder. membranes were washed with PBS-T and incubated with secondary peroxidase-coupled antibodies (Calbiochem mRNA was found in murine cochleae as well as at lower levels in murine cerebellar and pituitary tissue (n = 2; A and B) and in the lateral wall of dissected human inner ears (C). more than 100-fold lower levels of Ceacam16 transcripts could also be demonstrated in cerebellum and pituitary. 3 of 200 ES cell clones yielded a fragment with the expected size. southern blot analysis using a unique probe downstream of the 3\u2032-targeting region revealed the presence of the expected 8.2 kb genomic fragment. this suggests correct homologous recombination events in all three. no corresponding mRNA and protein could be detected in cochleae of ceacam16/ mice. no corresponding mRNA and protein could be detected in cochleae of mice. gous mating of mice showed correct recombination events at 3\u2032-region and 5\u2032-region of the targeted allele of Ceacam16. wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/) and homozygous genotypes for the knock-out allele are indicated above the lanes. DPOAE signals to a stimulus level of 50 db SPL (L1) is a measure for the optimum (max) amplification by OHCs. 1\u20132-month-old mice had a significantly reduced 2f1 f2 DPOAE amplitude at this stimulation level. growth of 2f1 f2 dropped behind in both mice at suprathreshold stimulation levels. hearing threshold was significantly increased in the low and high frequency hearing range in young Ceacam16/ mice. signal derivative for aged Ceacam16/ mice displays a loss of threshold and loss of suprathreshold gain. amplitudes were still significantly decreased for aged Ceacam16/ mice as compared with wild-type mice. amplitudes were still significantly decreased for aged Ceacam16/ mice. the threshold was significantly increased in aged Ceacam16/ mice. the threshold was significantly increased for click, noise burst, and frequency-specific stimuli of 2\u20138-kHz stimulation frequency. from the ABR threshold, the loss of hearing function that has been found already in young mice exclusively by frequency-specific stimulation. Ceacam16/ mice had a similar or even smaller loss of auditory function compared with wild-type mice. loss of threshold for frequency specific stimuli was not significantly different from wild-type mice. otype of ceacam16/ mice led to reduced vulnerability of OHC function. threshold for click ABR stimuli increased in both Ceacam16/ and Ceacam16+/+ mice. individual ear threshold (db SPL) was correlated to age (months) immunohistology with this biotinylated monoclonal antibody revealed strong staining of the whole TM from the base to the helicotrema of the cochlea of adult wild-type mice. no other structure was consistently stained in the adult wild-type cochlea in comparison to the cochlea of Ceacam16/ mice. the otolith-containing acellular gel overlying the macula of the saccule was also strongly stained no other structures were stained in the inner ear including the utricle and the labyrinth. expression of CEACAM16 was analyzed in the cochleae and vestibular organ of Ceacam16+/+ (A\u2013C, I, and J) and Ceacam16/ mice. CEACAM16 (brown stain) was observed in the acellular TM (A, B, I, and J) and in the extracellular matrix covering the macula cells of the saccule (C) in wild-type but not in ceacam16/ mice. staining for CEACAM16 was observed in interdental cells in the helicotrema region of P15 wild-type cochleae (I) and also in adult Ceacam16+/ mice expression of CEACAM16 was analyzed in the cochleae of Ceacam16+/+ mice 5\u201318 days post partum (P5-P18) by immunohistology using the monoclonal anti-human CEACAM16 antibody 9D5 (A\u2013C and G\u2013I) as the negative control, cochleae of Ceacam16/ mice were analyzed (D-F and J\u2013L) expression of CEACAM16 was analyzed in the organ of Corti of adult (P49) Ceacam16+/+ (A\u2013F, G, and H) and 44-week-old Ceacam16/ mice (A, inset) by immunofluorescence using the monoclonal anti-CEACAM16 antibody 9D5. no CEACAM16 staining could be detected in both the cell body and projections of the Deiters cell nuclei. expression of ceacam16 in the organ of Corti of young rats (P12) was analyzed by in situ hybridization of cochlear sections with a Ceacam16 antisense probe. strong expression of ceacam16 mRNA (brown) appears in interdental cells of the limbus (A) and in Deiters cells and to a lesser extent in phalangeal, border, pillar, and inner hair cells (B) the major components of the TM comprise three types of collagen (collagen II, IX, XI), -tectorin, and -tectorin, the most abundant non-collagenous proteins as well as otogelin and otolin (27, 28). tectorial proteins can occur in various cell types, and their temporal expression pattern differs (e.g. Tecta transcription cease at P15) the stereocilin gene (Strc) is only marginally expressed in the cochlea during the developmental time frame investigated. this suggests that the N1 domain exhibits a weaker homophilic interaction (if any) than the N2 domain. HEK293T cells either remained untransfected (A) or were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding full-length murine native (B) or GPI-linked CEACAM16 (C) transfected cells were harvested by repeated pipetting, incubated at room temperature, attached to glass slides using the cytospin method. encoding only the N1 or N2 domain either soluble (I, upper panel) or GPI-linked (I, lower panels) were expressed in HEK293T cells by transfection. cell lysates (cells) or cell culture supernatants were separated by gel electrophoresis. CEACAM16 was detected by Western blot analysis with a monoclonal anti-myc antibody. we expressed full-length murine CEACAM16 transiently on HEK293T cells. this indicated that CEACAM16 can dimerize via intermolecular disulfide bonds between B and/or N2 domains also in the absence of the N1 and A domain. this indicated that CEACAM16 can dimerize via intermolecular disulfide bonds between two N2 domains also in the absence of the N1 and A or the A domain. 80% of 57 Ceacam16 cDNAs originated from adult inner ear or organ of corti (supplemental Fig. 1A), suggesting preferential expression of CEACAM16 in inner ear tissue. CEACAM16 mRNA was detected in none of the tissues (supplemental Fig. 1B) however, a strong signal was found for total RNA from murine cochleae. CEACAM16 transcripts were identified by end point (A and C) and real-time RT-PCR (B). mRNA was found in murine cochleae as well as at lower levels in murine cerebellar and pituitary tissue (n = 2; A and B) and in the lateral wall of dissected human inner ears (C). -Actin cDNA was amplified to control intactness of the RNAs (A and C) and for normalization ( chimeric mice were mated to obtain ceacam16/, ceacam16+/, and ceacam16+/+ mice. no sex bias was observed (Ceacam16/ male/Ceacam16/ female = 13:12) IgV-like domains are red; IgC-like domains are blue. only restriction endonuclease sites relevant for cloning or probe generation are shown. black arrows indicate the transcriptional direction. positions of primers used for identification of targeted ES cell clones are shown. -type (+/+), heterozygous (+/) and homozygous genotypes are indicated above the lanes. wild-type and Ceacam16/ mice still had a similar \"best hearing\" at this young age. DPOAE signals to a stimulus level of 50 db SPL (L1) is a measure for the optimum (max) amplification by OHCs. 1\u20132-month-old Ceacam16/ mice had a significantly reduced 2f1 f2 DPOAE amplitude at this stimulation level. threshold SPL for evoking DPOAE signals were not found to be significantly different. level along 10-ms recording time (upper panel) and waviness of ABR amplitude deflections (derivative, lower panel) as a function of stimulation level (db SPL) are shown. amplitude, latencies, and waviness are affected by age and are furthermore impaired in the Ceacam16/ mice. OHC amplification loss in aged Ceacam16/ mice became evident from the 2f1 f2 threshold audiogram (K) and from the DPOAE growth function (L). black symbols in E and K are slightly horizontally displaced for better visualization. threshold for best hearing frequencies was also affected. age-related hearing loss in wild-type and knock-out mice was reduced. dPOAE functions confirm age-related reduction in 2f1 f2 amplitude. ceacam16/ mice had a similar or even smaller loss of auditory function compared with wild-type mice. loss of threshold for click stimuli was not significantly different from wild-type mice. loss of threshold for frequency specific stimuli was similar in high frequency range. ABR threshold to click stimuli was measured in aging Ceacam16+/+ and Ceacam16/ mice, 1\u201319 months of age. individual ear threshold (db SPL) was correlated to age (months) continuous lines show a linear fit. otolith-containing acellular gel overlying the macula of the saccule strongly stained. CEACAM16 was found by immunohistology in interdental cells, Deiters cells, and possibly in OHCs. double-staining using fluorescently labeled anti-CEACAM16 antibodies ruled out the presence of CEACAM16 in adult P49 Ceacam16+/+ mice. no other structures were stained in the inner ear including the utricle and the labyrinth. we noticed that in adult wild-type mice the TM was often detached from the OHCs and more contracted in comparison to the TM in ceacam16/ mice. this difference between wild-type and CEACAM16/ mice was statistically significant. no staining was seen when only horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin was added. the age of the mice (days post partum) is indicated at the lower left corners. CEACAM16 (brown stain) was observed in the TM starting at P12. in P15 and P18 mice homogenous staining for CEACAM16 was found. note the preferential staining at the marginal band (MB) and limbal zone (LZ) and the sulcus proximal part of the medial zone (MZ) of the TM. CEACAM16 (red) was observed in the OHC-supporting Deiters cells (A, C, D, F, and H) but not in OHCs, specifically identified by anti-prestin antibodies (green) no CEACAM16 staining could be detected in Ceacam16/ mice (A, inset) strong expression of ceacam16 mRNA appears in interdental cells of the limbus (A) and in deiters cells and to a lesser extent in phalangeal, border, pillar, and inner hair cells (B) no specific staining was observed with the sense probe. immunohistological analyses revealed that CEACAM16 could not be detected in P5, P8, and P10 cochleae. however, at P12 and occasionally at P15, CEACAM16 was found in both the limbal zone and in the marginal band of the TM. in the medial zone only the sulcus proximal side of the TM was stained. 93T cells expressing GPI-anchored CEACAM16 aggregated homotypically. cells expressing native CEACAM16 did not (Fig. 9, A\u2013C) these findings suggest that CEACAM16 molecules might interact in an antiparallel fashion also under physiological conditions possibly involving the N1 or N2 domain. the expression levels of myc-tagged fusion proteins and the fraction of positive cells were determined by anti-myc and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. the expression levels of myc-tagged fusion proteins and the fraction of positive cells were determined by FACScan analysis using anti-myc and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. oligomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric forms of CEACAM16 are indicated by yellow dots, green tags represent NH2-terminally added myc epitopes, and green arrows symbolize GPI anchors. to test the hypothesis, we expressed full-length murine CEACAM16 transiently on HEK293T cells. a COOH-terminal-truncated CEACAM16 consisting of N1 and A with no unpaired cysteines did not form dimers. this indicated that CEACAM16 can dimerize via intermolecular disulfide bonds between B and/or N2 domains also in the absence of the N1 and A domain. similar dimer and oligomer formation were observed in cell extracts when full-length or CEACAM16 deletion mutants were ectopically 80% of 57 Ceacam16 cDNAs originated from adult inner ear or organ of corti (supplemental Fig. 1A) this suggested preferential expression of CEACAM16 in inner ear tissue. a strong signal was found for total RNA from murine cochleae. -bp DNA fragment in one of the spiral ganglia cDNA samples corresponds to a product with retained intron and thus is probably derived from contaminating genomic DNA (C). to this end we deleted exons 2, 3, 4, and part of exon 5 including its splice acceptor site in BALB/c ES cells by homologous recombination. southern blot analysis using a probe from the 5\u2032-upstream region confirmed correct homologous recombination in mice derived from ES cell clone C3. no corresponding mRNA and protein could be detected in cochleae of mice. hybridization with the 5\u2032- (blue) and 3\u2032-probes (red) are indicated. identification of targeted ES cell clones by long range PCR is shown. a total of three recombinant ES cell clones could be identified of 200 clones tested. threshold loss was not seen by stimulation with multifrequency click stimulus. single ears of Ceacam16/ mice appear to have already increased threshold. but differences are not quite significant (p = 0.08) growth of 2f1 f2 dropped behind in ceacam16/ mice at suprathreshold stimulation levels. growth of 2f1 f2 dropped behind in both mice. young (1\u20131.4 months old) (A\u2013F) and old Ceacam16+/+ and Ceacam16/ mice (7\u201319 months old) (G\u2013L) were analyzed for ABR threshold. signal derivative for aged Ceacam16/ mice displays a loss of threshold and loss of suprathreshold gain. growth function is shown for f2 = 11.3 kHz stimulation with increasing sound pressure. growth function is shown for f2 = 11.3 kHz stimulation. 0.05 (*), p 0.01 (**), and p 0.001(***) of ears analyzed are indicated. Mean S.D. or S.E. (L, 2f1 f2 growth) Aged Ceacam16/ Mice Have Impaired Hearing for Click, Noise, and Pure Tone stimuli. age-related hearing loss is subject to age-related changes (age-related hearing loss) f2 amplitude in both, wild-type, and knock-out mice. reduced cochlear amplification also in aged mice. hearing deficits described in young Ceacam16/ mice found also in aged mice. the loss of the DPOAE threshold was significantly smaller in Ceacam16/ mice than in wild-type mice. the loss of suprathreshold 2f1 f2 signal strength was significantly smaller in Ceacam16/ mice than in wild-type mice. CEACAM16 is an acellular sheet of matrix that runs along the length of the cochlea. it is attached to the spiral limbus, spans the spiral sulcus, and covers the organ of Corti with its sensory hair cells. this antibody binds to the IgC type A domain of both murine and human CEACAM16. CAM16 antibodies and antibodies specific for prestin/KCNJ10, an OHC marker, ruled out the presence of CEACAM16 in adult mice. CEACAM16 appears to be present in vesicular structures in the body as well as in the projections of Deiters cells. in adult wild-type mice the TM was often detached from the OHCs. expression of CEACAM16 was analyzed in the cochleae and vestibular organ of Ceacam16+/+ (A\u2013C, I, and J) and Ceacam16/ mice (E\u2013G) no gross abnormality of the distribution of -tectorin was seen in both mice. expression of CEACAM16 was analyzed in the cochleae of ceacam16+/+ mice 5\u201318 days post partum (P5-P18) by immunohistology using the monoclonal anti-human CEACAM16 antibody 9D5 (A\u2013C and G\u2013I) no difference was observed when different regions of the cochlea were analyzed. CEACAM16 was present also in OHCs, Deiters cells, and in interdental cells (G\u2013I, arrows) the appearance of immunoreactive CEACAM16 protein is preceded by ceacam16 mRNA expression detectable from P10 onward with a maximum around P13. only marginal amounts of -tectorin (Tecta) and stereocilin (Strc) mRNA are found. staining for CEACAM16 was observed in the supranuclear (neck) region of IHCs. pillar cells were identified by staining with anti-KIR4.1 antibody. expression of ceacam16 in the organ of Corti of young rats was analyzed. CEACAM16 Is Deposited Late during TM Development Deposition of proteinaceous components of the TM starts already prenatally at about embryonic day 14 in mice (25) the major components of the TM comprise three types of collagen (collagen II, IX, XI), -tectorin, and -tectorin, the most abundant non-collagenous proteins as well as otogelin and otolin. the TM exhibited homogenous staining for CEACAM16 (Fig. 6, H and K, and Fig. 6, I and L) at P18 and often already at P15, the TM exhibited homogenous staining for CEACAM16. comparison of wild-type sections with sections from ceacam16/ mice stained in parallel suggest both interdental cells and Deiters cells and possibly OHCs might be the source of the CEACAM16 protein. the fraction of cells expressing high levels of N1 (38%) was higher than that observed for N2 transfectants (24%). no aggregates >9 cells were observed for N1 transfectants, whereas 38% of N2-expressing cells were contained in such aggregates. this suggests that the N1 domain exhibits a weaker homophilic interaction (if any) than the N2 domain. FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (D and E, right panels, green curves) samples incubated without primary antibody served as a negative control (blue curves) analysis of fraction of N1- and N2-positive cells mediated by N1 and N2 domains was quantitated. to test the hypothesis, we expressed full-length murine CEACAM16 transiently on HEK293T cells. a COOH-terminal-truncated CEACAM16 consisting of N1 and A with no unpaired cysteines did not form dimers. this indicated that CEACAM16 can dimerize via intermolecular disulfide bonds. dimer and oligomer formation were observed in cell extracts. he analyzed HEK293T cells expressing secreted or GPI-linked N2 or N1 domains. dimers could not be seen either in cell extracts or supernatants. 80% of 57 cDNAs originated from adult inner ear or organ of Corti. a strong signal was found for total RNA from murine cochleae. the presence of more than 100-fold lower levels of Ceacam16 transcripts could also be demonstrated in cerebellum and pituitary. in dissected adult human inner ears, CEACAM16 transcripts could be detected in lateral wall preparations. 3 of 200 ES cell clones yielded a fragment with the expected size. southern blot analysis using a unique probe downstream of the 3\u2032-targeting region revealed the presence of the expected 8.2 kb genomic fragment. chimeric mice were back-crossed to BALB/c mice. no corresponding mRNA and protein could be detected in cochleae of ceacam16/ mice. a total of three recombinant ES cell clones could be identified of 200 clones tested. the absence and presence of CEACAM16 mRNA and protein was demonstrated in adult (>20 weeks old) mice by RT-PCR (D) and Western blotting (E), respectively. wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/) and homozygous genotypes for the knock-out allele are indicated above the lanes. single ears of Ceacam16/ mice appear to have already increased threshold. but differences are not quite significant (p = 0.08) in brainstem responses. the origin of the hearing loss is based on a sensory-neural hearing loss. young (1\u20131.4 months old) (A\u2013F) and old Ceacam16+/+ and Ceacam16/ mice (7\u201319 months old) (G\u2013L) were analyzed for ABR threshold. click (A and G) and pure tone stimulation (B and H) is shown. hearing threshold was significantly increased in the low and high frequency hearing range in young Ceacam16/ mice. growth function is shown for f2 = 11.3 kHz stimulation with increasing sound pressure (mean S.E.) in young mice, DPOAE threshold was not found to be different (E and arrowhead in F), but suprathreshold signal amplitudes fell behind the values for wild-type mice. the threshold was significantly increased in ceacam16/ mice for click. noise burst, and frequency-specific stimuli of 2\u20138-kHz stimulation frequency. the threshold for best hearing frequencies was also affected. the threshold for best hearing frequencies was also affected. the hearing deficits described in young Ceacam16/ mice were found also in aged mice. the loss of the DPOAE threshold function was smaller in Ceacam16/ mice than in wild-type mice. f2 DPOAE threshold was similar between both genotypes before noise exposure. phenotype of ceacam16/ mice was mainly based on reduced function of OHC amplification. threshold for click ABR stimuli increased in both Ceacam16/ and Ceacam16+/+ mice. anti-CEACAM16 antibody binds to the IgC type A domain of both murine and human CEACAM16. immunohistology with this biotinylated monoclonal antibody revealed strong staining of the whole TM from the base to the helicotrema of the cochlea of adult wild-type mice. no other structure was consistently stained in the adult wild-type cochlea in comparison to the cochlea of ceacam16/ mice cells and appears to reach into the reticular lamina that covers the cells of the organ of Corti. no staining with the CEACAM16 antibody was observed in cochlear sections of ceacam16/ mice. in adult wild-type mice the TM was often detached from the OHCs and more contracted in comparison to the TM in ceacam16/ mice. chleae and vestibular organ of Ceacam16+/+ (A\u2013C, I, and J) and Ceacam16/ mice (E\u2013G) by immunohistology using the biotinylated monoclonal anti-human CEACAM16 antibody 9D5. CEACAM16 (brown stain) was observed in the acellular TM (A, B, I, and J) and in the extracellular matrix covering the macula cells of the expression of CEACAM16 was analyzed in the cochleae of Ceacam16+/+ mice 5\u201318 days post partum (P5-P18) by immunohistology using the monoclonal anti-human CEACAM16 antibody 9D5 (A\u2013C and G\u2013I) as the negative control, cochleae were analyzed (D-F and J\u2013L) expression of CEACAM16 was analyzed in the organ of Corti of adult (P49) Ceacam16+/+ (A\u2013F, G, and H) and 44-week-old Ceacam16/ mice (A, inset) by immunofluorescence using the monoclonal anti-CEACAM16 antibody 9D5. no CEACAM16 staining could be detected in Ceacam16/ mice (A, inset) pillar cells were identified by staining with anti-KIR4.1 antibody. expression of ceacam16 in the organ of corti of young rats was analyzed. no specific staining was observed with the sense probe. maturation of the TM is observed around postnatal day 15 (P15) a time point in development where mature mechanical and electrical cochlear responses are observed. the major components of the TM comprise three types of collagen (collagen II, IX, XI), -tectorin, and -tectorin, the most abundant non-collagenous proteins as well as otogelin and otolin. quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed persistent transcriptional activity of Ceacam16 from P12 into adulthood and an inverse temporal expression activity of Tecta. the stereocilin gene (Strc) is only marginally expressed in the cochlea during the developmental time frame investigated. these findings suggest that CEACAM16 molecules might interact in an antiparallel fashion also under physiological conditions possibly involving the N1 or N2 domain. HEK293T cells either remained untransfected (A) or were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding full-length murine native (B) or GPI-linked CEACAM16 (C) transfected cells were harvested by repeated pipetting, incubated at room temperature, attached to glass slides using the cytospin method. native CEACAM16 (G) or deletion constructs lacking N2 (H) or N1 and A (J) or B and N2 (K) or GPI-linked (I, lower panels) were expressed in HEK293T cells by transfection. cell lysates (cells) or cell culture supernatants with or without prior treatment were separated by gel electrophoresis. to test the hypothesis, we expressed full-length murine CEACAM16 transiently on HEK293T cells. in the N2 domain, however, Cys-387 appears to be located in a depression and thus seems to less likely allow intermolecular disulfide bond formation. to test the hypothesis, we analyzed HEK293T cells expressing secreted or GPI-linked N2 or N1 domains. soluble N2 domains could not be seen in cell extracts or supernatants. these data together with the observation that N2 can support cell adhesion when ectopically expressed on the cell membrane. DISCUSSION With the conquest of land by formerly aquatic vertebrates, adaptation to the new medium air included development of the cochlear auditory system. hair cells sense the sound-induced vibrations of the basilar membrane. a reduced mechanical coupling of OHC motility into the cochlear amplifier may account for the reduced noise vulnerability in Ceacam16/ mice. this is corroborated by a recent publication where it was shown that affected individuals of an american family (1070) with non-syndromic autosomal dominant hearing impairment (DFNA4) progressing during adulthood to 50 db carry a missense mutation in the CEACAM16 gene (33) ta and Tectb encode the inner ear-specific proteins -tectorin and -tectorin, major non-collagenous proteins of the otoconia membrane and TM. mice with a Tecta functional null mutation similarly exhibit an increased compound action potential threshold preferentially at lower frequencies. -Tectorin mRNA amounts in the cochleae drop rapidly after birth. peak levels of CEACAM16 mRNA were observed in mice. this could explain the finding that in mice, at hearing onset a higher compound action potential threshold is observed (26) that could be due to TM immaturity caused by incomplete deposition of CEACAM16 in the TM at this time of development. -tectorin and -tectorin but not otogelin are essential for the formation of the striated-sheet matrix. the lack of expression of the former two proteins leads to loss of an organized striated-sheet matrix (34, 35, 38) CEACAM16 is part of the striated-sheet matrix and forms possibly the darker of the two discernible fibrils and the longer -tectorin together with -tectorin possibly by interaction via their zona pellucida domains. this is also in agreement with the observed sensitivity of the striated-sheet matrix toward disulfide bridge-disrupting agents."}
