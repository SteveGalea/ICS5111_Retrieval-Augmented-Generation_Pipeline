{"summary": "ubiquitin-Proteasome system regulates proteins involved in most fundamental cellular processes including transcription, translation, DNA repair and the cell cycle. a cascade of three enzymes activate (E1); conjugate (E2); and ligate (E3) a polypeptide of ubiquitin to protein substrate targets, resulting mostly (though critically not always) in their elimination from the cell by the proteasome. papillomavirus E6 protein binds cellular E3s to degrade host proteins. largest families of E3 ligases are responsible for up to 20% of all ubiquitinated substrates within cells [13] largest families of E3 ligases are responsible for up to 20% of all ubiquitinated substrates. modular cullin RING ligase (CRL) complexes include one out of seven cullins (Cul1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 7) as a scaffold subunit. each cullin recruits an Rbx protein onto which an E2 conjugated with a single ubiquitin can load. several key mechanisms specifically relating to viral exploitation of CRLs have been elegantly studied. these studies have shown that multiple viral proteins specifically target a large array of CRL complexes typically regulating their substrate targeting activity. aim of this review is to focus on how specific viruses rewire ubiquitination of CRL substrates and how these in turn impact on viral infection. BPFL1 CRLs Acts as a deneddylase inactivating CRLs preventing the degradation of host cell cycle and DNA damage regulators. BPFL1 CRLs Acts as a substrate adaptor driving p53 degradation [40,42] BPFL1 CRLs Acts as a deneddylase inactivating CRLs preventing the degradation of host cell cycle and DNA damage regulators. NS1 CRL2 Binds to FBXO3 driving degradation of TFIIH subunit [58,59] Group VI HIV-1 Vif CRL5 Acts as a substrate receptor driving degradation of A3 proteins [60] Vpr CRL4 Prematurely activates SLX4 complex by driving Mus81 ubiquitination [62] HIV-2/SIV Vpx CRL4 Drives SAMHD1 degradation in specific cell types [63,64,65] seven different cullin scaffold proteins exist in humans (Figure 1a\u2013f), each serving as a building block for the assembly of many modular multi-subunit CRL complexes. it is possible to subdivide the other six CRLs into three archetypes according to the recruited adaptor and SR. the regulation of cullins involves several alternate complex conformations. neddylation cascade begins with the activation of NEDD8 by the E1 enzyme NAE1 (NEDD8 Activating Enzyme-1). a neddylated cullin is capable of associating with an adaptor and an SR that can recognize and recruit a specific substrate. neddylation is thought of as an activating \u201con-switch\u201d for CRL ubiquitination. but it seems that neddylation/deneddylation cycles are required for CRL activity implying a complex cycling balance is required. neddylation is carried out by the eight-subunit COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex. the CSN on SRs such as the DNA damage binding protein-2 (DDB2) and Cockayne syndrome A1 (CSA1) stabilizes five different SRs in vivo. this protection may be caused by a steric effect of CSN binding to the CRL thereby inhibiting neddylation. further work will hopefully elucidate the physiological implications of the diversity of CSN\u2013CRL connections particularly during viral infection. a key advance in defining CRL mechanisms came with the solving of a number of high-resolution CRL structures. one of the most crucial steps to determine in CRL biology is the molecular mechanism of how CRLs recognize and select their substrates. SR protein plays a critical role in bringing the substrate in close proximity to the ubiquitin-loaded E2. viruses hijack or co-opt host CRLs by expressing proteins that physically interact with subunits of one or more CRL family members. viral hijacking of CRLs uses similar mechanisms to that used in host-CRL substrate targeting as well as uniquely evolved viral mechanisms to direct host factors for degradation. ectromelia virus encodes a number of BTB/Kelch proteins. ectromelia viruses also encode their own FBPs [23] which complex with host CRL1 complexes. no clear effect on substrate degradation has yet been identified. adenoviruses express E4ORF6 proteins that can bind both CRL2 and CRL5 host complexes in a serotype dependent fashion. degradation of DNA Ligase IV by the E4ORF6-CRL complex prevents concatamer formation enhancing viral propagation. oviruses hijack CRLs to negate anti-viral p53 effects by degrading master regulator. adenoviruses (like Ad5) circumvent this by additionally targeting the MRE11 subunit of the host DNA damage sensing MRN complex (consisting of MRE11A-RAD50-NBS1) for degradation. a number of other substrates of Ad5 E4orf6 and E1B55K have been identified. a clear picture of why this pair of viral proteins targets so many host factors and how these ubiquitination events are integrated is yet to emerge. the HPV E7 protein is responsible for host cellular oncogenic transformation and binds an active form of CRL2 via a direct interaction with Elongin C. the KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) protein functions as a SOCS-box protein mimic within CRL5 complexes. the N-terminus of LANA contacts EloB/C while the C terminus interacts with Cul5 directly. KSHV targets the kinases responsible for degron phosphorylation upstream of CRL1. the group I poxvirus Myxoma protein interacts with host CRL1 complexes. this interaction results in the ubiquitination and degradation of the cell cycle regulatory protein p27. degradation of this CDK inhibitor overcomes the cell cycle arrest produced by infection. the polyomavirus SV40 encodes the Large T antigen (LTAg). this interaction impairs the ability of CRL7 to degrade its cognate substrate, the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), a critical component of the insulin and insulin like growth factor 1 -signaling pathways. infected cells, BPLF1 can inactivate all CRLs resulting in the accumulation of CRL substrates. this results in chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor-1 accumulation (CDT1) accumulation. infected cells create a highly favorable intracellular environment for viral replication. C2 is capable of interacting with the catalytic subunit of the CSN complex (CSN5/Jab1) expression of C2 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants decreases CSN activity and causes the accumulation of neddylated CRL1. faba bean necrotic yellows virus expresses an F box protein (called CLINK) capable of binding SKP1 and intriguingly pRb. -TRCP ubiquitinates IBa, a protein that functions to inhibit the transcriptional activity of NFB. however upon infection by Rotavirus, IBa becomes stabilized preventing NFB signaling. this inhibits NFB signaling and the interferon response negatively regulating the host immune system by preventing IBa interaction with and degradation by CRL1. group IV viruses are known to date to target SRs of presumably active CRLs. further work will most likely reveal more such interactions and discovery of the physiological substrates will determine why these viruses hijack CRLs in vivo. a similar strategy is used by human parainfluenza virus 2 and mumps virus to degrade both STAT1 and STAT2 proteins. the ultimate aim of this recurring viral bottleneck is to dampen host interferon signaling, reducing the ability of infected cells to counteract viral replication. a clear illustration of this is within the livestock pathogen Rift Valley Fever virus. HIV Viral infectivity factor (Vif) binds primarily CRL5 (although it is also reported to bind CRL2) via a direct interaction with the adaptor proteins Elongin B (EloB) and Elongin C (EloC) as well as contacting Cul5 [60,92]. Upon subsequent infection of new target cells A3F and A3G negatively affect many steps of the HIV virus life cycle. the involvement of the UPS in this pathway is controversial and poorly understood. the third HIV accessory protein known as Viral protein R (Vpr) binds to CRL4 complexes in HIV infected cells. a new target for Vpr was described in recent years. SAMHD1 has been described as suppressing the levels of dNTPs in several cell types. a nucleotide triphospho-hydrolase that restricts lentiviral reverse transcriptional activity in myeloid cells may elevate dNTP levels above the threshold required for retroviral reverse transcription. another large family of ligases is the tripartite motif (TRIM) family that includes more than 75 members. HBx-CRL4 interaction results in host genome instability and cell death. neither function of HBx has been elucidated to date. HBx has been shown to stabilize protooncogene pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1). further evidence of a group-I virus targeting CRL3 was uncovered in a recent host genome-wide RNAi screen with Vaccinia virus. this screen successfully identified two CRL components: Cul3 and Rbx1 as being required for viral replication. this also points towards a role for CRL3 in driving replication of certain viruses in vivo. E4ORF6 of the Ad5 Adenovirus strain uses a second viral protein (E1B55K) to form an active CRL5 complex driving p53 degradation. adenoviruses hijack CRLs to negate these anti-viral p53 effects by degrading this master regulator. this hijacking of different CRL family members to independently target DNA damage factors within the same pathway is a remarkable example of viral perturbation of the UPS. further studies will hopefully reveal if this common theme exists within many viruses, perhaps as a redundancy mechanism by viruses to ensure blocking of a particular host response. sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a group-I rhadinovirus and the etiologic agent of several human malignancies that occur frequently in AIDS patients. KSHV proteins subvert many aspects of the host UPS (including CRLs) in several intricate cascades. inactivation of GSK-3 prevents phosphorylation of the degron on c-Myc required for its degradation by CRL1. the M-T5 protein of the group I poxvirus Myxoma (a rabbit/hare virus) interacts with host CRL1 complexes. adenovirus CELO expresses a GAM1 protein capable of recruiting both CRL2 and CRL5 complexes. the GAM1-CRL2/5 complexes subsequently target host SAE1 and SAE2 (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier-1) for proteasomal degradation. infected cells, BPLF1 can presumably inactivate all CRLs resulting in the accumulation of CRL substrates. in the absence of CDT1 degradation, the cell cycle of infected cells becomes deregulated. EBV also plays a more canonical role in affecting CRLs. group-II (Single Stranded DNA Viruses) are plant viruses that cause extensive losses in crop production worldwide. expression of C2 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants decreases CSN activity and causes the accumulation of neddylated CRL1. p21 removal from cells is proposed to suppress the inhibition of host polymerase activity in infected cells driving viral DNA replication. group-III viruses include Reoviruses and Rotaviruses, which cause gastrointestinal infections. P25 protein of potato Virus X causes ubiquitination and degradation of host Argonaute1 in order to counteract the anti-viral effect of RNA silencing. another group IV plant virus\u2014polerovirus\u2014 expresses a silencing suppressor protein (P0) that contains an Fbox motif. a key step in the interferon response has to be deregulated. the paramyxovirus virus family contains many human and animal pathogens. the Nipah (NiV), Hendra virus and Simian Virus 5 (SV5) expresses a V protein that can sequester cellular STAT2/STAT1 heterodimers driving the CRL4 dependent ubiquitination and degradation of STAT1. group-V viruses have evolved several mechanisms to inactivate specific arms of host immunity. the virus is a group VI retrovirus and the causative agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) the role of Vif to is counteracting the anti-viral effects of A3\u2019s. this is primarily through the hijacking of a host CRL. this complex targets the cytoplasmic domain of the CD4 receptor for poly-ubiquitination and degradation. this study demonstrated the CRL4 dependent ubiquitination of Mus81 in the presence of Vpr. they also determined how Mus81 is targeted to Vpr-CRL4 by phosphorylation via the upstream Polo-like Kinase 1. this small viral protein was also known to hijack CRL4. group-VII (dsDNA-RT Viruses) encodes the HBx protein that is often referred to as \u201cenigmatic\u201d. the HBx protein interacts with CRL4 through a specific contact with DDB1 [66] and requires an intact CRL4 to function. this implies the interaction is both functionally significant and dependent on E3 enzymatic activity. few viruses have been shown to directly manipulate the proteasome. some studies have begun to shed light on direct proteasome\u2013virus interactions. a direct virus\u2013proteasome connection has been found in the HC-Pro proteinase. viral proteins have the ability to alter \u201cglobal\u201d host protein turnover rates directly through the proteasome to assist their pathogenesis. there has been significant success in targeting the proteasome as a cancer therapeutic with the small molecules Bortezomib and Carfilzomib [135]. MLN4294 is assumed to be a pan-CRL inhibitor targeting all members of the CRL family. inhibition of neddylation by MLN4294 has shown efficacy in HIV infected cells presumably by preventing (at a minimum) Vif, Vpu and Vpr from degrading their host targets. s to the cell surface receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) have been developed. small molecules capable of augmenting A3 levels even in the presence of Vif have been developed. the major concern is that in cancer cells aberrant CRL activity can remove anti-proliferative factors. rate-ligase trapping technology has been developed using either a ubiquitin binding domain fused to an SR [149] or by mutating the SR [150,151] eliminating the issue of transient substrate-CRL binding. substrates can then be identified by standard immuno-precipitation mass spectrometry (IPMS) approaches. resulting network of interactions show many HIV-1 proteins interact with a broad range of enzymes and regulators of the host UPS. similar studies of other viruses in combination with the methodologies discussed above will reveal new viral\u2013CRL connections. the use of such methods in combination with specific CRL inhibitors will be highly informative of direct substrate targets. the range of substrates targeted by these FBPs is not well catalogued. identifying these substrates will be very important in looking for common viral strategies used to hijack the UPS and in identifying therapeutically targetable CRL\u2013substrate pairs. these complex interactions all function to tip the balance of the host intracellular environment to drive viral pathogenesis. discovery of these mechanisms has informed us as much about our own immune system as it has about infectious pathways."}
