{"summary": "the study was approved by the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee. the panel included representatives of the 3 HRV species (Figure), human enteroviruses (HEVs) and extracts negative for picornaviruses. the original descriptions of primer pairs 7 and 10 lacked TM information. no primer pair detected the same HRVs and HEVs typed when the original pair (5) or pair 1 was used. only 2 primer pairs amplified anything from a specimen that was positive for both HRV and HEV. the original primer pair screen detected 3 untypeable picornaviruses. primer pair 7 performed better than previous population, detecting only 1 fewer HRVs than primer pair 1 and 9 more HRVs than pair 8. a specimen with a lower RNA concentration was less likely to be detected or typed by using other primer pairs. the rtPCR used pair 5 did not amplify known HEVs. some possible reasons could cause discrepant virus testing results between different sites."}
