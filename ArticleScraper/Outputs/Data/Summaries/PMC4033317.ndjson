{"summary": "human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) are known to cause acute respiratory illness (ARI; Tsukagoshi et al., 2013a). HRV is now recognized to have a major impact on asthma pathogenesis. the host receptor for HRV in respiratory epithelial cells is the intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, CD54) for the 84 major HRV serotypes (HRV-A and -B), or low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) for the other minor HRV serotypes. HRV infection causes common colds at a frequency of 25\u201353%. intranasal inoculation with either HRV serotypes 2, 9, and 14, coronavirus type 229E, or RSV in healthy volunteers induced patterns of symptom development. viral shedding occurs naturally for up to 21 days, but predominantly over a 3\u20134 days period. in illness caused by HRV, viral shedding occurs naturally for up to 21 days, but predominantly over a 3\u20134 days period. a major group of HRV (i.e., HRV-16) did not bind mouse ICAM-1. only a minor group of HRV (i.e., HRV-1B) infected the mouse. Table 1 shows the frequency of HRV infection in various adult respiratory diseases. common cold 25\u201353 Makela et al., 1998, van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al., 2005, exacerbation of COPD. as many as 85% of acute asthma exacerbations in children, and about 60% in adults, were associated with the presence of upper respiratory tract infections. the risk of exacerbations of asthma in adults is elevated after children return to school. there is no common antigen across all strains of HRVs. no reliable diagnostic method for HRV infection has been established using HRV antigens or HRV-specific antibody. HRV attaches to airway epithelial cells via ICAM-1, LDLR, and unknown receptors for HRV-C. HRV infected bronchial epithelial cells secrete a wide range of cytokines (IFN-, IFN-, IL-1, IL-6, GM-CSF) cytokines and chemokines attract various inflammatory cells such as DCs. the VEGF, EGF, FGF, amphiregulin and activin A promote the release of matrix proteins from fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. this enhances the production of MMP9 from airway epithelial cells. HRV-A and -B attach to airway epithelial cells via ICAM-1 or LDLR. the receptor or receptors for the recently identified group have yet to be clarified. single nucleotide polymorphisms involve in various diseases. interferon- polymorphisms may affect the incidence of HRV infection. Message et al. (2008) reported virus load in asthmatic subjects as being related to increased lower airway inflammation. HRV INFECTION AND AIRWAY REMODELING Grainge et al. (2011) reported that repeated bronchoconstriction in asthma promotes airway remodeling. there is now clear evidence that HRV-induced wheezing or exacerbation of asthma could contribute to the initiation and subsequent progression of airway remodeling. viruses have been found in approximately one half to three quarters of adults experiencing an acute wheezing episode. the majority (59%) of viruses identified were HRVs. however, the evidence is weak, and mechanisms are poorly understood. inverse correlations between ex vivo production of IFN- and severity of symptoms. strong positive correlation with reductions in lung function during in vivo infection. single nucleotide polymorphisms involve in various diseases. HRV INFECTION AND AIRWAY REMODELING Grainge et al. (2011) reported that repeated bronchoconstriction in asthma promotes airway remodeling. there is now clear evidence that HRV infections could contribute to the initiation and subsequent progression of airway remodeling. 61.5% of adult asthmatic patients with common cold suffered an asthma attack. common cold was significantly associated with acute exacerbations of asthma. epidemiological data regarding adult asthma exacerbations have been sparsely reported. the incidence of VRI was significantly lower in hospitalized patients (87 2.3%) than in non-hospitalized patients (96.7%, n = 7). in the latter group, influenza virus alone was detected in both patients. in the latter group, influenza virus alone was detected in both patients.

(1995) reported that HRV infection causes long lasting excessive airway narrowing in response to methacholine in asthmatic subjects. we speculate smooth muscle might have a role in exaggerated airway narrowing in virus positive asthmatic patients. the incidence of ground glass opacities (GGO) on high resolution computed tomography seemed to be higher for virus-positive hospitalized patients than for virus-negative patients. the incidence of ground glass opacities (GGO) on high resolution computed tomography seemed to be higher for virus-positive hospitalized patients than for virus-negative patients. no significant difference in duration of respiratory failure, wheezing, days in hospital, and even in the time required for steroid treatment. ICS treatment improved airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients experimentally challenged with HRV. the prevalence of asthma was closely associated with serum IgE levels standardized for age and sex. airway hyperresponsiveness appears to be closely linked to the allergic diathesis. Erythromycin inhibits HRV infection by reducing ICAM-1 expression on the surface of human tracheal epithelial cells. it modulates inflammation by suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is the main drug for regular asthma therapy. it is uncertain whether leukotriene receptor antagonist treatment is effective in the reduction of asthma symptoms associated with HRV infection. the prevalence of asthma was closely associated with the serum total IgE level standardized for age and sex. ANTI-VIRAL TREATMENT No drugs are clinically used in HRV infection. several drugs have been tried for treatment and prevention of HRV infection. HRV is a major pathogen for asthma exacerbations, and certainly associated with more serious clinical conditions such as hypoxemia or hypercapnea in hospitalized patients."}
