{"summary": "nanomechanical sensors are expected to be a key technology to environmental monitoring systems. they can detect diverse chemical species ranging from gaseous to biological molecules. detecting bioorganisms such as viruses and bacteria has also been reported. on the two types of nanomechanical sensors; cantilever-type sensors and MSS, and explore an optimized structure for the efficient detection of particles through the mechanical stress induced in the receptor layer. z = 3 ( 1 - c) l 2 E c t c 2 surf, (3) where surf is the surface stress defined as surf = f. FEA simulations were performed in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.1\u00ae with the Structural Mechanics module. each structure was meshed with 20,00060,000 elements, which give sufficient resolution for the present simulations. the sensing signal, Vout is approximately described as: V out = V B 4 ( R tot R tot 4) where VB is the bridge voltage, andRi is the change in the resistance of Ri (Yoshikawa et al., 2011). a fixed constraint was applied on the end of each beam. the deflection is related to the projected area of the dent s. r is a radius of a particle, rather than the surface area of the dent s. the plot is fitted with a quadratic function (red curve) a dent at l = 450 m causes 60 times larger deflection than a dent at l = 50 m. the signal caused by a dent at the center of MSS is not 10 times larger than the signal caused by a dent at 50 m from the edge. a higher sensing signal can be obtained for a deeper dent. the dent is at the center, h = 0.1 m, t = 1 m, E = 1 109 Pa, = 0.4. the plot is fitted with a quadratic function (red curve) cantilever-type sensor The dependence on the applied pressure, p, is investigated. it is clear that the deflection of the cantilever is exactly proportional to p over a wide range. this result suggests that the dependence of the deflection on the other parameters is not affected by p. cantilever deflection is plotted as a color gradient (p = 1 105 Pa, h = 0.1 m, t = 1 m, E = 1 109 Pa, = 0.4) it has been found that the deflection is independent of, while E significantly affects the deflection. a dent at l = 450 m causes 60 times larger deflection than a dent at l = 50 m. a higher signal can be obtained when a particle adsorbs near the center. the plot is fitted with a quadratic function (red curve) Rtot/Rtot for various E and are plotted in Figure 6A. a higher Poisson's ratio results in a lower Rtot/Rtot in the case of E > 109 Pa. there is an optimum thickness which yields maximum deflection in the cases of two typical nanomechanical sensing systems. the 2D stress applied homogeneously on the surface of a receptor layer, and the isotropic internal strain induced in a receptor layer. this difference can be ascribed to the lack of the lateral stress enhancement effect in the case of particle adsorption. the FEA simulation in the present study can be adapted to the detection of viruses in static mode. previous studies revealed that the force caused by a virus attached to a cell is on the order of 10 pN. in the present simulations, the applied pressure p is set at 1 105 Pa. FEA simulations were performed on a cantilever and an MSS. the thickness was set at their optimum values: 2.5 and 8.0 m for the cantilever. FEA simulations showed that a surface stress of 2 mN/m leads to a sensing signal comparable to adsorption of 102 viruses on a receptor layer. it is estimated that at least 102 103 of viruses are needed to obtain a detectable sensing signal when living cells are used as receptor materials. MSS is a promising candidate for a portable real-time virus detection device. these studies fall into two categories in terms of the operation mode. nanomechanical sensors operated in dynamic mode detect viruses by their mass. static mode operates based on the stress or strain. FEA simulations on a cantilever and an MSS are coated with poly (methyl methacrylate; PMMA); a commonly used polymer as a receptor material. the thickness was set at 2.5 and 8.0 m for the cantilever and the MSS respectively. signals can be obtained by using a material with low Young's modulus (109 Pa) this is a favorable condition for practical applications because most biological materials which can interact with viruses have a low Young's modulus. this is a favorable condition because most biological materials which can interact with viruses have a low Young's modulus. MSS is a promising candidate for a portable real-time virus detection device based on its simple detection mechanism and the easier experimental protocols. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
