{"summary": "the aim of the present paper is to provide an update on the aetiology, epidemiology, and treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. acute diarrhoea is a leading cause of child mortality in developing countries, accounting for 1.5\u20132 million deaths in children under five years. rotavirus infection accounts from 20% to 60% of all diarrhoeal episodes in developing and developed countries. it is the major cause of acute diarrhoea in young children under five years of age. rotavirus infection was responsible for 453,000 deaths in children under 5 years in 2008, accounting for 37% of diarrhoea-related deaths. most dangerous symptom of infectious diarrhoea is dehydration, which is the direct cause of many diarrhoeal deaths. in developing countries, children are also more likely to be malnourished. diarrhoea can be a cause of malnutrition in young children due to impaired absorption of amino acids and sugars. dehydration in diarrhoea may arise from a variety of mechanisms depending on the specific interaction of the causative agent with intestinal epithelium. this is characterised by an inhibition of villous absorption and enhanced crypt cell secretion. all forms of childhood diarrhoea are potentially life threatening. efforts to control childhood diarrhoea have resulted in a substantial decline in child deaths over the past three decades. diarrhoea remains the second leading cause of overall childhood mortality after pneumonia. in developing countries, more than one billion diarrhoea episodes occur every year in children under five years of age. one systematic review has evaluated the decrease in incidence of cases of severe diarrhoea after vaccination with one of the two available vaccines. incidence was reduced by 35%\u201340% in low-mortality countries and by 15%\u2013to 30% in high-mortality countries. however, even though vaccination may have a more modest effect in high-mortality countries, the incidence of diarrhoea is much higher. the WHO guidelines for treatment of acute diarrhoea in children recommend immediate rehydration including corrective electrolyte therapy, maintenance of breastfeeding, or early feeding during a diarrhoea episode [19]. ORS is absorbed in the small intestine even during copious diarrhoea, thus replacing the water and electrolytes lost in the faeces. ORS has no effect on the frequency of bowel movements, the duration of diarrhoea, or associated symptoms such as abdominal pain. zinc supplementation may increase the uptake of ORS and reduce the severity and duration of the diarrhoea episode. robust data showing incremental value of zinc salts over ORS alone are scarce. Loperamide Loperamide is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhoea in adults and children over 12 years of age. it is a synthetic opiate agonist activating the receptors in the myenteric plexus of the large intestine. receptors are situated presynaptically on the ending of the parasympathetic cholinergic innervation of the intestinal smooth muscle. loperamide is metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. it is a substrate for the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. a number of clinical trials have investigated the potential antidiarrhoeal effects of loperamide. serious adverse events, defined as ileus, lethargy, or death, were reported in 8 out of 972 children allocated to loperamide (0.9% (0.4%\u20131.7%) compared with none of 764 children allocated to placebo. loperamide is widely used in adult patients and has shown some efficacy in paediatric studies. racecadotril is hydrolysed in the plasma to its active metabolite thiorphan. loperamide does not act at the level of the opiate receptor but rather as an inhibitor of the enzyme neutral endopeptidase 24.11. these enkephalins are endogenous opioid neurotransmitters synthesised and secreted by interneurons of the enteric nervous system. racecadotril has been evaluated for the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in children in a number of trials. the first was a large randomised, double-blind study comparing racecadotril to placebo as an adjunctive treatment with ORS in boys under the age of three presenting with acute watery diarrhoea performed in south America [54] the principal outcome measure was stool output, which is considered the most objective and relevant outcome measure for clinical trials no adverse events specifically associated with racecadotril have been identified in the published clinical trials. the nature and frequency of adverse events in patients treated with racecadotril were similar to those observed in the placebo group. the main therapeutic applications of probiotics have been the treatment and prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. however, there is no evidence of efficacy for most probiotics. some meta-analyses have attempted to evaluate the effect of probiotics in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhoea in children. diosmectite Diosmectite is an adsorbent clay mineral indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic diarrhoea. it is a natural multilamellar clay, belonging to the dioctahedral smectite class and consists of a double aluminium and magnesium silicate arranged in parallel leaflets. diosmectite is more resistant to attack by endogenous (such as pepsin and bile salts) or exogenous (such as bacterial toxins, NSAIDs, and alcohol) this has been demonstrated in animal models [77] and in humans [80]. this has been observed in children with acute diarrhoea. the difference was statistically significant (P 0.0001) and clinically relevant. all studies were consistent, showing a higher recovery rate in patients treated with diosmectite. a secondary analysis of date pooled from the two studies identified significant effect of rotavirus status (P 0.0001) and treatment (P = 0.0016) and a significant interaction between treatment and rotavirus status (P = 0.0011) in both studies, the time to recovery was significantly shorter (P 0.01; logrank test) in the diosmectite treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group. the only adverse event that could be imputed to diosmectite was the emergence or worsening of constipation. the only adverse event that could be imputed to diosmectite was the emergence or worsening of constipation. Loperamide is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhoea in adults and children over 12 years of age. loperamide is metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. it is a substrate for the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. a number of clinical trials of varying quality have investigated the potential antidiarrhoeal effects of loperamide. loperamide is widely used in adult patients and has shown some efficacy in paediatric studies. it is not approved for use in children in most countries, although in the united states, loperamide is approved by the FDA for use in children above the age of two. racecadotril is a prodrug that is rapidly absorbed from the gut and hydrolysed in the plasma to its active metabolite thiorphan. unlike loperamide, racecadotril does not act at the level of the opiate receptor but rather as an inhibitor of the enzyme neutral endopeptidase 24.11. racecadotril has been evaluated for the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in children in a number of trials. the first was a large randomised, double-blind study comparing racecadotril to placebo as an adjunctive treatment with ORS in boys under the age of three presenting with acute watery diarrhoea. the principal outcome measure was stool output, which is considered the most objective and relevant outcome measure. no adverse events specifically associated with racecadotril have been identified in the published clinical trials. racecadotril used as adjuvant therapy is more effective and less costly compared to ORS alone for the treatment of children with acute diarrhoea [59]. the main therapeutic applications of probiotics have been the treatment and prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. however, there is no evidence of efficacy for most probiotics. some meta-analyses have attempted to evaluate the effect of probiotics in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhoea in children. diosmectite is an adsorbent clay mineral indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic diarrhoea. it is eliminated unchanged directly through the faeces within sixteen hours of administration. a study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that diosmectite could reduce the production of hydrogen in the colon. diosmectite may affect intestinal permeability and electrolyte flux. this has been observed in children with acute diarrhoea. it suppresses the production of cytokines such as interleukin-8. the standard mean difference in diarrhoea duration was 22.7 hours (95% CI: 24.8 to 20.6) in favour of the diosmectite + ORS group. this difference was statistically significant (P 0.0001) and clinically relevant. the meta-analysis also evaluated the proportion of patients recovered after three and five days of treatment. rotavirus-negative subgroup, a larger difference in stool output between the diosmectite and placebo treatment groups. the difference in diarrhoea duration was a secondary efficacy criterion. in both studies, the time to recovery was significantly shorter. no differences in the nature or frequency of adverse events between the diosmectite and placebo group were observed. the only adverse event that could be imputed to diosmectite was the emergence or worsening of constipation. the 2005 WHO guidelines focus on the use of ORS as the cornerstone of management of acute diarrhoea in children. ESPGHAN and ESPID published evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis in children in europe in 2008. these guidelines do evaluate pharmacological antidiarrhoeal treatments, although they state that such drugs are generally not necessary. the grade of recommendation was considered to be B. Loperamide should not be used in the management of acute diarrhoea in children. there is evidence in favour of the use of racecadotril over placebo or no intervention to reduce the stool output in children. cost-effectiveness analyses should be undertaken before routine pharmacological therapy with diosmectite is universally recommended. probiotics (i) consistently show a statistically significant effect and moderate clinical benefit of selected probiotic strains in the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea (primarily rotaviral), mainly in infants and young children. diarrhoeal illness still causes deaths in children, mostly in developing countries. it also has long-term consequences on growth and physical and cognitive development."}
