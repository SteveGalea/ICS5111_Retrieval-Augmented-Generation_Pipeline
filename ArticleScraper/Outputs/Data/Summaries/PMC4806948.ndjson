{"summary": "the ECDC is an EU agency with a mission to identify, assess, and communicate current and emerging threats to human health. the daily activity of epidemic intelligence at ECDC involves active or automated web searches from confidential and official sources. the sources of epidemic intelligence information include several websites and a large number of webpages retrieved through specialized search engines. s were sorted into 10 categories (Table 2). Infectious disease threat events detected in Europe, 2008\u20132013. foodborne and waterborne diseases caused by transmission of organisms through food or water. the IDTE drivers were organized into 3 categories: globalization and environment, sociodemographic, and public health systems. drivers subjected to descriptive analyses (individually or in combinations) in relation to different types of IDTEs. foodborne and waterborne IDTEs were the most frequently occurring events (n = 48), followed by vectorborne and rodentborne IDTEs (n = 27), airborne IDTEs (n = 10) vaccine preventable IDTEs (n = 10), other zoonotic IDTEs (n = 7), injection drug use\u2013associated IDTEs (n = 4), influenza IDTEs (n = 4), healthcare-associated IDTEs (n = 3), multidrug resistance\u2013associated IDTEs ( foodborne and waterborne IDTEs were responsible for the most IDTEs. the global burden of foodborne diseases is considered to be substantial, although no current estimates exist. the most common cause of the observed foodborne and waterborne outbreaks in Europe was norovirus. a large outbreak of hantavirus infections in Germany in 2010 was attributed to bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) populations. other zoonoses IDTEs Q fever, psittacosis, and diseases caused by cowpox virus and coli were included in the other zoonoses IDTE category. Vaccine-preventable IDTEs Ten IDTEs, including measles, mumps, rubella, and pertussis outbreaks, were reported for the vaccine-preventable IDTE category. a measles outbreak in Bulgaria in 2009\u20132010, which affected predominantly migrant and hard-to-reach populations, resulted in >24,000 cases and 24 deaths in 1 year (24) multidrug resistance\u2013 and Healthcare-Associated IDTEs multidrug-resistant tuberculosis cases were identified as single case events. the events in the multidrug resistance\u2013associated IDTE group consisted of a nosocomial outbreak of multidrug-resistant carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection in 2 hospitals in Ireland and 69 infections with New Delhi metallo-lactamase-1 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriacea sexually transmitted IDTE Only 1 sexually transmitted IDTE was identified by epidemic intelligence. the event consisted of invasive meningococcal disease among men who have sex with men. the men had been infected while traveling or through contacts from abroad. the hierarchical cluster analysis revealed several similarly clustered segments, such as climate and natural environment and migration and social inequality. limitations Although sociodemographic and public health system drivers were less frequent in our analysis of IDTEs, they are nonetheless key contributors to the disease burden from infectious diseases in Europe (32). international travel from areas with epidemic and endemic diseases has resulted in continuous importation of infected persons into Europe. monitoring and modeling air traffic patterns for pathogen importation risk can potentially accelerate early case detection and rapid response and effective control of IDTEs. food and water quality was the second most frequent driver of IDTEs in Europe. drivers of IDTEs can arise as epidemic precursors of IDTEs. monitoring and modeling these drivers can serve as early warning systems of IDTEs."}
