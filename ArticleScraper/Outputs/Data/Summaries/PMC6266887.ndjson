{"summary": "ZIKV is a member of the Flavivirus genus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. it is closely related to other mosquitoes-transmitted flaviviruses of public health relevance such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and west Nile virus (WNV) ZIKV is an enveloped virus containing three structural proteins. the capsid (C) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) glycoprotein are anchored in a lipid membrane. inside the virion, the viral (v)RNA genome is complexed with multiple copies of the C protein, surrounded by the E and M proteins. the NS proteins are involved in vRNA synthesis, assembly and regulation of the host cell responses. the strains that have been responsible for recent human outbreaks are phylogenetically related to the most recent Asian lineage. vRNA is associated with the C protein and is packaged into ER-derived membranes containing the prM and E proteins. cellular furin protease mediate the cleavage of the prM, resulting in the release of the pr peptide and formation of mature virions containing the M protein. the development of reverse genetic systems provide investigators with a powerful tool for the development of vaccines and therapeutic (antivirals) options. flavivirus genus belongs to the Flaviviridae family and is closely related to other mosquitoes-transmitted flaviviruses of public health relevance such as dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and west Nile virus (WNV). similarities with DENV and CHIKV have interfered with ZIKV diagnosis and most probably underestimated the number of cases for ZIKV infections ZIKV is an enveloped virus containing three structural proteins. inside the virion, the viral (v)RNA genome is complexed with multiple copies of the C protein, surrounded by the E and M proteins. surface of the mature virion has a icosahedral shell consisting of 90 E:M heterodimers. zika virus (ZIKV) virion structure and genome organization are phylogenetically related to the most recent Asian lineage. vRNA genome is cleaved co- and post-translationally by viral (arrows) and host (diamonds) proteases. viral particles are assembled within the ER, where the genomic vRNA is associated with the C protein. cellular furin protease mediate the cleavage of the prM, resulting in the release of the pr peptide and formation of mature virions containing the M protein that will be released from infected cells [32,33,34]. reverse genetic approaches have been used for the development of vaccines based on attenuated forms of the virus. they allow to recover infectious recombinant viruses upon transfection of a single (non-segmented viruses) or multiple (segmented viruses) DNAs into susceptible cells. emergence of ZIKV as an important human pathogen has promoted the rapid development of numerous reverse genetic approaches. the second approach consist in the construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone containing the viral genome flanked by a eukaryotic polymerase II-driven promoter at the 5\u2032 end. the full-length infectious cDNA clone is directly transfected into susceptible cells where the vRNA is primarily transcribed in the nucleus by the cellular RNA polymerase II with further amplification steps in the cytoplasm driven by the viral in vitro transcription is required to produce viral RNA that is transfected into susceptible cells to initiate viral replication and transcription in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. in this case, the full-length cDNA clone is transcribed in the nucleus of transfected cells by the cellular RNA polymerase II. V cDNAs vRNAs are directly electroporated into cells RNA electroporation is generally more efficient than transfection Need an in vitro RNA transcription step Genome instability of flavivirus cDNA clones in bacteria Error rate of RNA in vitro transcription can produce undesired mutation. in vitro ligation Non-required propagation of full-length cDNA in bacteria Viral genome is maintained in multiple fragments in bacteria Low virus recovery efficiency Error rate of the reaction can produce undesired mutations. five RT-PCR fragments spanning the complete viral genome were individually cloned and assembled into a low-copy number plasmid using unique restriction sites present in the viral genome. a rZIKV was successfully recovered after transfection of the infectious in vitro transcribed RNA in both mammalian (Vero) cells. rZIKV produced plaques with homogenous morphology in vero cells. this phenotype correlated with what was observed in vivo using interferon receptor deficient (IFNAR/) A129 mice where rZIKV was less virulent than the parental ZIKV. pJAZZ-OC plasmid is derived from the linear dsDNA genome of coliphage N15 and can be maintained with 2\u20134 copies/cells [71] in the bacteria host. this plasmid has prokaryotic transcription terminators flanking the cloning site to eliminate the transcription into and out of the insert. rZIKV MR766 showed similar grow kinetics in vitro in mammalian vero or mosquito C6 pFK plasmid was controlled by the phage T7 promoter using unique restriction sites. however, they consistently observed that the full-length cDNA clones were unstable during their propagation in bacteria. this problem was avoided with the introduction of punctual silent mutations to disrupt the CEPs present in the viral genome. authors introduced a modified version of the group II self-splicing P.li.LSUI2 intron [75,76] to disrupt the toxic regions located in that region of the viral genome. the intronic sequences generally contain multiple stop codons, which interrupt the translation of the gene in bacteria. authors used this P.li.LSUI2 intron to produce vRNA transcripts with an intact ZIKV sequence. rZIKVs generated using this approach replicate in culture. rZIKVs generated using this approach replicate in culture. rZIKVs generated using this approach replicate in culture. rZIKVs were virulent in type I and type III interferon deficient AG129 mice. similar reverse genetic approach was used by Gorman et al. in 2018 to rescue the rZIKV strain Dakar 41525. full-length cDNA of ZIKV PRVABC59 was generated by digestion and ligation using the Gibson assembly method. assembled product was then transcribed into RNA using the phage T7 polymerase and the product was transfected in vero cells. this method avoids the need to use a bacterial host for the propagation of the cDNA after the final assembly. several approaches have been developed to overcome the problems associated with genome instability of full-length infectious ZIKV cDNAs. the first reverse genetic approach for the construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone was reported by Tsetsarkin et al. in 2016 [57] authors described the generation of an infectious cDNA clone for ZIKV Paraiba_01/2015. cDNA-derived rZIKV replicated efficiently in multiple cell lines, including those of placental and neuronal origin. cDNA-derived rZIKV replicated efficiently in multiple cell lines, including those of placental and neuronal origin. cDNA-derived rZIKV replicated efficiently in multiple cell lines, including those of placental and neuronal origin. the rZIKV-RGN was able to replicate in vero, human A459 and mosquito C6/36 cells. the PCR reaction generated a circular end product. the rZIKV-RGN was able to replicate in human A459 and mosquito C6/36. the viral genome was flanked at the 5\u2032 end by the CMV promoter and at the 3\u2032 end by the HDVr followed by the bovine growth hormone termination and polyadenylation sequence. the clone was highly stable during passage in E. coli and infectious virus was recovered after direct transfection of susceptible Vero cells. transfection of overlapping dsDNA fragments was sufficient to rescue multiple flaviviruses, including DENV, JEV or WNV. this approach is based on spontaneous recombination between the overlapping cDNA fragments that allows the assembly and synthesis of a full-length cDNA copy of the complete viral genome. based on the use of infectious RNA transcripts from full-length ZIKV cDNAs have been developed to overcome the toxicity problems associated with several sequences of ZIKV genome. those methods involve the incorporation of an intron in the genome to disrupt toxic regions [42], in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments [52,53] and Gibson assembly [54,55]. the rZIKV was successfully recovered after transfection of the infectious in vitro transcribed RNA in both vero and mosquito cells. in vitro analysis showed that the rZIKV replicated at lower efficiency than the natural ZIKV isolate in both mammalian (Vero) and mosquito (C6/36) cells. four RT-PCR fragments spanning the complete ZIKV MR766 genome were assembled in the plasmid pBR322 (around 20 copies per cell) the fragment containing the NS1 coding region was systematically instable during its propagation in bacteria. pJAZZ-OC plasmid is derived from the linear dsDNA genome of coliphage N15 and can be maintained with 2\u20134 copies/cells [71] in the bacteria host this approach was previously described to stabilize the full-length cDNA clones of JEV and DENV-2 [66]. in 2018 M\u00fcnters et al. described the construction of full-length cDNA clones of the African 1947 Uganda MR766 and the Asian French Polynesia 2013 (H/PF/2013) strains of ZIKV. however, they consistently observed that the full-length clones were unstable during their propagation in bacteria. a full length cDNA clone of ZIKV GZ01, a virus strain isolated from a patient in china, was successfully assembled by Liu Z-Y et al. in 2017 to successfully rescue a rZIKV. authors introduced a modified version of the group II self-splicing P.li.LSUI2 intron [75,76] to disrupt the toxic regions located in that region of the viral genome. a rZIKV GZ01 was successfully recovered after the transfection of the in vitro-spliced RNA in both mammalian and mosquito C6/36 cells. both viruses caused similar levels of neurovirulence in neonatal BALB/c mice. this approach can be a feasible option for rescue rZIKV. restriction endonuclease sites were used to allow the directional ligation of the digested subgenomic fragments to generate a full-length cDNA clone. the assembled product was then transcribed into RNA in vitro using the T7 polymerase. this method avoids the use of a bacterial host for the propagation of the full-length cDNA and therefore overcome the problems associated with cDNA instability. weger-Lucarelli et al. developed a reverse genetic system for the ZIKV PRVABC59 strain [54]. in this manuscript, the viral genome of PRVABC59 was cloned in two separate pieces into the pACYC177 vector to disrupt the unstable NS1 region. to that end, the authors generated one vector with the T7 polymerase promoter sequence followed by the first third of the ZIKV genome. a second pAC five RT-PCR fragments spanning the complete viral genome were individually cloned and assembled into a low-copy number plasmid using unique restriction sites present in the viral genome. a rZIKV was successfully recovered after transfection of the infectious in vitro transcribed RNA in both mammalian (Vero) and mosquito (C6/36) cells. rZIKV produced plaques with homogenous morphology in vero cells. the parental viral strain formed plaques with heterogeneous sizes. this phenotype correlated with what was observed in vivo using IFNAR/A129 mice. pJAZZ-OC plasmid is derived from the linear dsDNA genome of coliphage N15. plasmid has prokaryotic transcription terminators flanking the cloning site to eliminate the transcription into and out of the insert. rZIKV MR766 showed similar grow kinetics in vitro in mammalian vero or mosquito C6/36 cells than the parental MR766 ZIKV strain. a full-length cDNA clone from a ZIKV Brazilian isolated was successfully assembled by Liu Z-Y et al. [42] in 2017 to successfully rescue a rZIKV. modified version of the group II self-splicing P.li.LSUI2 intron [75,76] between the E and NS1 ZIKV coding regions. the intronic sequences generally contain multiple stop codons, which interrupt the translation of the gene in bacteria. authors used this intron to produce vRNA transcripts with an intact ZIKV sequence. rZIKVs generated using this approach replicate in cultured cells similar to their parental viral isolates. rZIKVs generated using this approach replicate in cultured cells similarly than their parental viral isolates. the same reverse genetic approach was used by Gorman et al. in 2018 to rescue the African ZIKV strain Dakar 41525 [53]. in this case, authors combined the use of a quadripartite system with BglI overhang restrictions sites for in vitro ligation. full-length cDNA of rZIKV PRVABC59 was then generated by digestion and ligation using the Gibson assembly method. assembled product was then transcribed into RNA using the phage T7 polymerase and the product was transfected in vero cells. this method avoids the need to use a bacterial host for the propagation of the cDNA after the final assembly. several approaches have been developed to overcome the problems associated with genome instability of full-length infectious ZIKV cDNAs. the first reverse genetic approach for the construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone was reported by Tsetsarkin et al. in 2016 [57] authors described the generation of an infectious cDNA clone for ZIKV Paraiba_01/2015. cDNA-derived rZIKV replicated efficiently in multiple cell lines, including those of placental and neuronal origin. in 2016 also reported the construction of a plasmid carrying the complete genome of the prototype MR766 ZIKV African strain under the control of a CMV promoter. the rZIKV-RGN was able to replicate in vero, human A459 and mosquito C6/36 cells. rZIKV-RGN replicated less efficiently than the Asian strain ZIKV MR766. rZIKV-RGN was detected in serum of infected IFNAR/ A129 mice after 4 -5 days. the viral genome was flanked at the 5\u2032 end by the CMV promoter and at the 3\u2032 end by the HDVr followed by the bovine growth hormone termination and polyadenylation sequence. the ZIKV-RGN clone was highly stable during passage in E. coli and infectious virus was recovered after direct transfection of susceptible Vero cells. authors described the generation of an infectious cDNA clone for ZIKV Paraiba_01/2015, a virus isolated from a febrile female subject in the paraiba state in Brazil during the 2015 epidemic. to that end, four overlapping cDNA fragments spanning the entire ZIKV genome were individually cloned and assembled into the low-copy number plasmid pACNR1811 using conventional molecular cloning techniques. setoh et al. in 2017 used a CPEC reaction approach to construct a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the Brazilian ZIKV strain Rio Grande do Natal. the approach is based on the assembling of multiple cDNA fragments in the right order using a polymerase extension mechanism. the CPEC products were then used to directly transfect Vero cells without any additional manipulations. V-RGN was detected in serum of infected IFNAR/ A129 mice after 4 -5 days. however, the infection was asymptomatic with 100% of survival. rZIKV-RGN replicated efficiently in vero and human A549 cells. cDNA clone containing amino acid change impaired viral RNA synthesis and viral production in cultured cells. this approach is based on spontaneous recombination between the overlapping cDNA fragments that allows the assembly and synthesis of a full-length cDNA copy of the complete viral genome in transfected cells. this approach could facilitate the rescue of recombinant RNA viruses from cDNA without requiring propagation in bacteria or in vitro RNA transcription. full-length infectious clones and subgenomic amplicons require a primary transcription in the nucleus by the cellular RNA polymerase II. a clear cytopathic effect is observed at 3-4 days post-transfection with viral titers ranging between 1104 and 1107 plaque forming units (PFU) per mL in the tissue culture supernatants of transfected cells. rZIKVs present in tissue-culture supernatants can be recovered for titration or viral amplification in mammalian (Vero) or insect (C6/36, right) cells. replicons systems are powerful tools to study viral replication in the absence of virus entry or virion assembly. they contain all the elements needed to produce effective viral replication in susceptive host cells but lack one or multiple viral structural genes. virus-conserved cyclization sequence required for viral RNA replication. last 30 amino acids of E protein fused in-frame with downstream NS1 protein. in vitro RNA transcripts synthesized by the T7 RNA polymerase were electroporated into Huh-7 cells. authors demonstrated that the generated Neo resistant stable cell line maintains the ZIKV replicon for several passages. a stable reporter ZIKV Rluc-expressing replicon was constructed inserting the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal site (IRES, blue) followed by a neomycin resistance gene (Neo, pink) into the first 28 nucleotides of 3\u2032 UTR (B) both foreign viral genes, PAC and Rluc, followed by the FMDV 2A protease sequence were introduced between of the first N-terminal 38 the selection gene puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (PAC) and the reporter gene were separated by a FMDV 2A protease sequence. in this case, the PAC-2A-Rluc construct was followed by a second 2A protease sequence. the cassette was introduced, in frame, between the C38 and the E30 sequences (C38-PAC-2A-Rluc-2A-E30) cDNA clone of the brazilian ZIKV strain beH819015 was inserted. a copy of the C protein or part of its N-terminal region was introduced upstream. a copy of the C protein or part of its N-terminal region that contains the flavivirus-conserved cyclization sequence was introduced upstream. a full-length cDNA clone expressing the rZIKV gene was constructed by Shan et al. [46]. Rluc was introduced downstream of the first 25 amino acids of the C protein (C25, dark gray) followed by the FMDV 2A protease sequence (yellow box) fused in-frame with the viral ORF. reporter genes were individually introduced downstream of the complete C protein followed by the FMDV 2A protease sequence fused in-frame with the downstream viral ORF. the codon sequence of the downstream copy of the viral C protein was altered to reduce potential recombination (dotted gray) rZIKV-Rluc (MR766 or H/PF/2013) replicated at lower extend as compare to non Rluc-expressing rZIKV MR766 or H/PF/2013. the rapid loss of the Rluc could be due to recombination events between the partial duplication of the capsid regions. the rZIKV-GFP was successfully rescued after electroporation of several fragments covering the complete genome under the control of the CMV promoter. rZIKV-GFP titers were 1.5 log lower compared with the rZIKV without GFP. rZIKV-GFP was unstable and the virus lost GFP expression. expressing rZIKVs, limited stability of the rZIKVs expressing reporter genes was observed, except for NanoLuc which remained stable during four serial passages in cultured cells. new approaches for the expression of reporter genes in the viral genome are necessary to generate stable rZIKV expressing reporter genes. the first 38 amino acids of the viral C protein (C38) fused in-frame with the downstream NS1 protein. in vitro RNA transcripts synthesized by the T7 RNA polymerase were electroporated into Huh-7 cells. authors demonstrated that the generated Neo resistant stable cell line maintains the ZIKV replicon for several passages and expressed high levels of Rluc. a stable reporter ZIKV Rluc-expressing replicon was constructed inserting the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal site (IRES, blue) followed by a neomycin resistance gene (Neo, pink) into the first 28 nucleotides of 3\u2032 UTR (B) both foreign viral genes, PAC and Rluc, followed by the FMDV 2A protease sequence were introduced between of the first N-terminal 38 authors generated a bicistronic ZIKV replicon of SZ-WIV001 strain [81] in which the selection gene puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (PAC) and the reporter Rluc were separated by a FMDV 2A protease sequence. in this case, the PAC-2A-Rluc construct was followed by a second 2A protease sequence and the cassette was introduced between the C38 and the E30 sequence replicon was designed by Mutso et al. in 2017 using the full-length cDNA clone of the Brazilian ZIKV strain BeH819015. in this case, the Gluc reporter gene was inserted followed by the FMVD 2A protease sequence between the C protein and the last 30 amino acids of the E protein (E30) fused in-frame with the NS1 protein. the activity of the replicon was demonstrated in mamm the flavivirus-conserved cyclization sequence was introduced upstream of the reporter gene to allow successful viral replication. reporter genes were introduced downstream the first 25 amino acids of the C protein (C25, dark gray) followed by the FMDV 2A protease sequence in-frame with the viral ORF. clones expressing nanoLuc, FfLuc, RSLuc (white boxes), GFP (green box) or mCherry (red box) were constructed by Mutso et al. in 2018. reporter genes were individually introduced downstream of the complete C protein followed by the FMDV 2A protease sequence fused in-frame with the downstream viral ORF. the codon sequence of the downstream copy of the viral C protein was altered to reduce potential recombination. rZIKV-Rluc (MR766 or H/PF/2013) replicated at lower extend as compare to non Rluc-expressing rZIKV MR766 or H/PF/2013. the rapid loss of the Rluc could be due to recombination events between the partial duplication of the capsid regions. rZIKV-GFP was introduced downstream of the first 33 amino acids of C protein (C33) followed by the FMDV 2A protease sequence in-frame with the viral ORF. rZIKV-GFP titers were 1.5 log lower than the rZIKV without GFP. rZIKV-GFP was unstable and the virus lost GFP expression. rZIKVs were not directly compared with either a rZIKV or a natural isolated. rZIKVs were not directly compared with either a rZIKV or a natural isolated. rZIKVs were not directly compared with either a rZIKV or a natural isolated. rZIKV cDNA sequences in bacterial have been hindered by the presence of cryptic bacterial promoter in the viral genome. several approaches based on the use of low-copy number plasmids, BACs, intron-insertion, intron-insertion, intron-insertion, in vitro ligation of cDNA fragments and in vitro assembly by Gibson method or by CPEC have been used."}
