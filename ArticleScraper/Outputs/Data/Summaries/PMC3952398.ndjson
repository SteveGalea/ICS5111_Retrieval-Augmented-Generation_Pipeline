{"summary": "chlamydiaceae are Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacteria that cause a large spectrum of diseases in both humans and agriculturally important animals. chlamydia suis, C. abortus, C. pecorum and C. psittaci cause syndromes in swine ranging from conjunctivitis to abortion. tressed RBs are irregularly shaped and non-dividing; these altered developmental forms are called aberrant bodies (ABs) chlamydiae can remain in the persistent/stressed state in culture for up to 9 months. a variety of stressors induce chlamydial persistence/stress. chlamydiae within herpes simplex Virus (HSV) super-infected genital epithelial cells entered the persistent/stressed state via a mechanism distinct from previously characterized models of chlamydial persistence. both HSV and human Herpes Virus 6 induce persistence by mechanisms that are independent of productive virus infection. herpesviruses and coronaviruses use different attachment/entry mechanisms. they replicate in different cellular compartments, replicate their genomes via different mechanisms, and infect host cell types. chlamydial persistence/stress response is unlikely by the same mechanism. an MOI of 1 of C. pecorum was used for all mono-infection and mixed-infection experiments. both C. pecorum and C. abortus development is altered by PEDV co-infection. in some experiments, an equal volume of UV-inactivated PEDV (PEDVUV) was used. after viral infection, all cells were centrifuged again, after which the inoculum was removed. cells refed with growth medium without gentamycin, and incubated for an additional 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. all cells were refed with fresh growth medium after PEDV infection (T0) samples were harvested for various analyses at 24 (T24), 48 (T48), 72 (T72) or 96 (T96) hpvi. cultures were either PEDV-infected (PEDV) or mock-infected (Mock) % positive control values obtained were then plotted on the Y-axis. sample identity is shown below the X-axis. UV-inactivated PEDV stocks were unable to induce PEDV M protein positive staining syncytium formation when inoculated into vero cell monolayers. in contrast, control cultures infected with replication competent PEDV showed PEDV positively staining single cells and syncytia in this same time period. st and chlamydial DNA were labeled using 1 g/ml 4',6-Diamidin-2'-phenylindoldihydrochlorid (DAPI, Molecular Probes) as both primary antibodies were of mouse origin, PEDV and chlamydia-specific labeling were performed on separate, duplicate coverslips. the number of inclusions in 20 random microscopic fields per sample was determined using a leica fluorescence microscope at 200 magnification. the counts averaged for each coverslip. the number of inclusion-forming units (IFU) in the undiluted inoculum was then calculated and expressed as IFU per ml inoculum. stocks of C. pecorum were propagated in HEp-2 cell monolayers. an MOI of 1 of C. pecorum was used for all mono-infection and mixed-infection experiments. infected monolayers were incubated for 14 h in growth medium without gentamycin. at time 0 (T0), all cell monolayers used for mixed-infection or PEDV mono-infection were PEDV-infected (1 105.5 TCID50), while for chlamydial mono-infections and mock-infections, only growth medium was applied. replicate Vero cells were mock-infected (Mock), mono-infected with PEDV (PEDV + cont.) or infected with C. pecorum and PEDV (Cp + PEDV) as in (A) hpvi, cells were fixed, labeled with anti-PEDV M (red) and DAPI (blue) at 24 hpvi, replicate coverslips were fixed, and labeled with anti-chlamydial LPS (green) and DAPI (blue) inclusion counts were used to calculate inclusion forming units (IFU)/mL (Y-axis) the average from three biologic replicates s.e.m. is shown. Statistical comparisons are indicated by brackets and were all significant to p 0.005. chlamydial inclusions were labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody against lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and a 1:500 diluted Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse antibody. as both primary antibodies were of mouse origin, PEDV and chlamydia-specific labeling were performed on separate, duplicate coverslips. monolayers were scraped into 1 ml of cold growth medium at 24, 48, or 72 h post viral infection (hpvi) infected host cell lysates were harvested and sub-passaged on fresh Vero cell monolayers in triplicate. the number of inclusions in 20 random microscopic fields per sample was determined using a Leica fluorescence microscope at 200 magnification. we used UV inactivation and host cell CHX pre-treatment to inhibit PEDV replication in co-infected cells. a similar approach was used to determine that HSV replication was required for chlamydial persistence/ stress induction. positively staining single infected cells and syncytia were readily detectable in PEDV-infected cultures. however, small dots of anti-M protein immunostaining are observed in these cultures. PEDV replication is not required to alter C. pecorum development. neither mock- nor PEDV singly-infected cells stained with anti-LPS. inclusions within C. pecorum/PEDV co-infected cells contained anti-LPS tagged, greatly enlarged AB (Figures S1E,F, white arrows), as previously reported. PEDV-induced C. pecorum developmental cycle alteration is reversible. if the stressor is removed, the chlamydiae re-enter normal development and infectious progeny are produced. we reasoned that any PEDV particle components responsible for this effect might eventually be degraded. production of infectious EBs from PEDV co-infected, CHX-exposed cultures is significantly increased at 48 and 72 hpvi, compared to co-infected samples collected at 24 hpvi. the PEDV-induced loss of chlamydial infectivity is reversible within 48 hpvi if continued viral replication is inhibited. cultures (+CHX) were pre-exposed to 5 g/ml CHX starting at 1 h before viral infection. at 24 hpvi (T24), 48 hpvi (T48) and 72 hpvi (T72), replicate coverslips were used for sub-passage titer analysis. the time hpvi and sample are shown below the X-axis. PEDV co-infection induces C. pecorum AB morphologically indistinguishable from persistent/stressed organisms Persistent/stressed chlamydiae have a striking ultrastructural appearance. enlarged organisms observed by IFA in co-infected cells resemble ABs, but the AB morphology is best observed by TEM. PEDV replication in vero cells is inhibited by UV-inactivation and CHX exposure. there is currently no available system for complementing/propagating PEDV replication-deficient mutants. coronaviruses replicate in the host cell cytoplasm, anti-M protein staining is primarily cytoplasmic. meanwhile, vero monolayers infected with UV-inactivated PEDV (PEDVUV) contained neither M protein cytoplasmically-positive cells nor syncytium formation (Figures 1D,E, white arrows) in some replicates, cells were pre-exposed to 1 or 5 g/ml CHX before viral infection. in others, cells were co-infected with PEDVUV in the absence of CHX. inclusions in C. pecorum/PEDV co-infected cells contained anti-LPS tagged, greatly enlarged AB. anti-PEDV IFA of replicate coverslips indicated that the UV inactivation and CHX-exposure completely eliminated PEDV single cells and syncytia (Figure 1F), as previously observed (Figures 1D,E). these data indicate that PEDV replication is not required for co-infection induced persistence/stress induction and suggest that PEDV binding/entry may be sufficient to induce this effect. infected cultures were pre-exposed to 5 g/ml CHX starting at 1 h before viral infection to prevent PEDV replication. replicate coverslips were fixed and labeled with anti-chlamydial LPS (green and DAPI) and DAPI (blue) representative fields from anti-LPS/DAPI stained coverslips are shown at 1000 magnification with 15 m scale bars. inset shows a higher magnification view of an inclusion at 96 hpvi (white box) at 24 hpvi (T24) and 72 hpvi (T72), replicate coverslips were fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy. a white asterisk and double white arrows indicate a small AB with a condensed nucleoid that may be \u201cbudding\u201d from an adjacent AB (E). the enlarged organisms observed by IFA in co-infected cells resemble ABs. chlamydiae within PEDV co-infected cells have the typical persistent/stressed AB ultrastructure regardless of whether viral replication is prevented by CHX-exposure. both anti-LPS IFA and electron microscopic examination indicates the presence of grossly enlarged, electronlucent ABs. chlamydiae in co-infected cells enter the persistent/stressed state regardless of whether PEDV replication is inhibited by CHX-exposure or UV-inactivated virions are used for co-infection. this is an important issue because host cellular nutrient deprivation can cause developing chlamydiae to enter the persistent/stressed state. ELISA experiments indicate that neither TNF-, nor IFN- are detected in co-infected culture supernatants, though IL-6 is observed. therefore, PEDV-induced C. pecorum persistence/stress is unlikely to be mediated by the cytokines currently known to induce this response. the coronavirus literature suggests several likely candidates, one of which is the viral envelope S glycoprotein. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV S proteins increase endoplasmic reticulum stress in murine L fibroblasts. single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome would be present in cells that are either infected with PEDVUV or infected with replication-competent PEDV. murine hepatitis virus (MHV) RNA synthesis can occur even when viral protein synthesis is inhibited with CHX or by virion UV inactivation. a PEDV protein produced during replication (rather than a viral particle component) may initiate the observed effects on chlamydial development. de novo synthesis of host proteins in response to PEDV infection is not required to induce C. pecorum persistence/stress. host cells can also release preformed mediators in response to damage or infection. PEDV co-infection is a strong inducer of AB formation. author contributions Robert V.
