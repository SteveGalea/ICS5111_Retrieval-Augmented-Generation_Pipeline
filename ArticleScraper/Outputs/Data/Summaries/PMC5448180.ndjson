{"summary": "ion\u2013molecule pathways from ionized acetylene clusters to benzene cation. we present insights into the facile way in which ion\u2013molecule reactions involving small unsaturated organics can lead to benzene cation. we show that there is a catalytic role for what are nominally spectator acetylene molecules. polyketide mimetics yield structural and mechanistic insights into product template domain function in nonreducing polyketide synthases. they are responsible for controlling the aldol cyclizations of poly--ketone intermediates during polyketide biosynthesis. our ability to understand the high regioselective control that PT exerts is hindered by the inaccessibility of unstable poly--ketones. itahara, Kunihiko Kaneko, and Satoshi Sawai Recent works have hinted at an ability of cells to respond in the exact same manner to a fold change in the input stimulus. the property is thought to allow cells to function properly regardless of changes in the absolute concentrations of signaling molecules. however, evidence has remained scarce. integrin V8 does not interact with the cytoskeleton in the same way. atypical interactions of integrin V8 with pro-TGF-1 Jianchuan Wang, Xianchi Dong, Bo Zhao, Jing Li, and Timothy A. Springer Integrins are cell-surface molecules that link extracellular ligands to the cytoskeleton. ectopic protein interactions within BRD4\u2013chromatin complexes drive oncogenic megadomain formation in NUT midline carcinoma Artyom A.

French Chromatin factors generally act within large, multisubunit we find that most [PSI+] variants arising spontaneously in the absence of this Hsp104 overproduction curing activity are cured when that activity is restored at normal levels. this activity is thus an antiprion system, protecting the cells from prion formation by this protein. we describe an innovative approach based on the development of artificial microRNAs. ipilimumab is the first-in-class immunotherapeutic for blockade of CTLA-4. it significantly benefits overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. ipilimumab:CTLA-4 complex defines atomic interactions responsible for affinity and selectivity. erythritol is a sugar substitute sweetener, and prior studies claimed no endogenous synthesis. hypoxia treatment reverses neurodegeneration in a mouse model of a pediatric mitochondrial disease, Leigh syndrome. coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 mediates evasion of dsRNA sensors and limits apoptosis in macrophages. mTORC1 promotes proliferation of immature Schwann cells and myelin growth of differentiated Schwann cells. mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) regulates the development of SCs and subsequently the growth of myelin sheaths. we show that defective SCs possess a remarkable plasticity to remyelinate axons via mTORC1. deletion of miR-183/96/182 in mice leads to severe deficits in vision, hearing and balance. common general anesthetic propofol impairs kinesin processivity. kinesins are highly expressed in the CNS, and their dysfunction leads to a wide range of human pathologies. exon 33/ mice had increased occurrences of premature ventricular contractions, tachycardia, and lengthened QT interval. the exclusion of alternative exon 33 altered CaV1.2 biophysical property, leading to greater ICa density. the green alga Chromochloris zofingiensis has potential as a biofuel feedstock and source of high-value nutraceutical molecules. we present a high-quality, chromosome-level assembly of the genome by using a hybrid sequencing approach with independent validation by optical mapping."}
