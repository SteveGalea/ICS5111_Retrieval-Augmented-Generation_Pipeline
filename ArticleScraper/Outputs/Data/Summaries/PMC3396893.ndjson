{"summary": "bats are increasingly recognized as reservoirs of emerging zoonotic RNA viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Ebolavirus and multiple Lyssaviruses. long-term field studies of virus dynamics in wild bat populations are exceedingly rare. rabies virus (RV), common in bat populations throughout the Americas, is the best-studied and arguably most important zoonotic virus of bats. estimated in the 1960s, yearly economic losses from rabies continue to exceed US$30 million. estimates from Brazil alone indicate thousands of cases in cattle per year and under-reporting is likely throughout much of Latin America. strategies to control vampire-bat-transmitted rabies in Latin America include vaccination of humans and livestock and reduction of bat populations by culling. culling in wildlife disease systems can increase disease prevalence when it stimulates the recruitment of susceptible individuals or increases host dispersal. the perpetuation of vampire bat rabies despite culling could therefore be enhanced by immigration of bats from neighbouring colonies. most knowledge of rabies in vampire bats has been inferred from patterns of livestock mortality or controlled infections in captive bats. a single exception was made for sites AP1 and AP3 which were only 2.2 km apart. a single exception was made for sites AP1 and AP3 which were only 2.2 km apart. to five samples in a single year were classified as seropositive (open diamond) or seronegative (filled diamond). from 2008 to 2010, we conducted 3\u20136 night capture\u2013recapture studies per year at most colonies. blood was collected with heparinized capillary tubes, centrifuged in the field using serum separator tubes. after sample collection, bats were released at the site of capture. rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test is a standard laboratory method for detecting the presence of RV neutralizing antibodies. from 2008 to 2010 only, we restricted colony size inference to those years. we treated each 3\u20136 day sampling period per site per year as an independent, closed population. a set of eight models with different assumptions on the sources of variation in capture probabilities were fit to the data. model simplification used stepwise removal of terms, followed by nested likelihood ratio tests. the 95% highest posterior densities (HPD) on effect sizes were generated using the mcmcsamp function in the lme4 package of R. colonies in Madre de Dios were located by capturing bats near livestock corrals or human settlements where bat bites had been reported. colonies inhabited both natural (trees and caves) and man-made structures (mines, tunnels) and were separated by a minimum of 10 km (though typically much greater) from 2008 to 2010, we conducted 3\u20136 night capture\u2013recapture studies per year at most colonies. each bat was issued one or two unique four-digit incoloy wing bands. a maximum of 250 l of whole blood was collected by lancing the propatagial vein with a sterile 23 gauge needle. the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test is a standard laboratory method for detecting the presence of RV neutralizing antibodies in bat sera. we used a modified RFFIT described by Kuzmin et al. [27] using four-well (6 mm) Teflon-coated glass slides to accommodate the small volumes of serum that could be collected from bats. a long-term variable categorized colonies that: (i) had never been culled, (ii) were periodically culled, and (iii) were regularly culled between 2007 and 2010. the full model included livestock density, long-term culling history, the department of Peru, and the interaction between culling and livestock density as fixed effects. the 95% highest posterior densities (HPD) on effect sizes were generated using the mcmcsamp function in the lme4 package of R [29] we assessed the factors contributing to RV exposure in individual vampire bats by applying a binomial GLMM to the serological data from 2007 to 2010. both decreases in colony size (AP13, MD134) involved human destruction of roosts. the increase in LM4 in 2010 may indicate re-colonization after the cessation of mining activity on the outer wall of that cave. colony sizes differed between departments and according to livestock density. the vast majority of individuals recaptured in multiple years were seronegative in all years. seroconversion, loss of detectable antibody titre and maintenance of antibodies occurred in two, five and one individual, respectively. the seroprevalence in regularly culled colonies was not statistically different from that of undisturbed or periodically culled colonies (figure 2b). the minimal model was compared to models including each term (or excluding in case of age and 4 year culling). analysis excluding six colonies that contained other bat species retained statistical support. females had significantly higher seroprevalence than males (OR = 1.98, 21 = 5.0, p = 0.025), a marginally significant effect in the original GLMM analysis. tures were relatively common both within (n = 216) and between years (n = 132) individuals recaptured up to 3 years after initial capture. the 95% CI on colony sizes did not overlap across years. both decreases in colony size involved human destruction of roosts. livestock density actually had a significant negative effect on colony size. this negative effect was driven by a single large colony in Lima (LM6). the vast majority of individuals recaptured in multiple years were seronegative in all years. RV seroprevalence was higher in bat colonies that were subjected to periodic (OR = 2.03) and regular culling (OR = 1.43) compared with those that were never culled during the study. but the seroprevalence in regularly culled colonies was not statistically different from that of undisturbed or periodically culled colonies. we repeated the GLMM analysis using a single randomly selected blood sample per recaptured bat to account for possible non-independence of samples from the same individual. in each of the latter analyses, age and culling retained statistical support. however, in each of the latter analyses, females had significantly higher seroprevalence than males. discussion Culling vampire bats is a central tool used by many Latin American countries to prevent rabies in humans and livestock. the core assumption behind culling to reduce wildlife disease is that reducing host population size decreases pathogen transmission. we tested this assumption by surveying RV exposure in 20 vampire bat colonies in Peru that showed natural variation in population size. 8.5\u201384.2% of rabid bats, depending on species, may contribute to the high mortality rates (more than 50%) observed during their first year of life. increased rates of rabies in juvenile and sub-adult bats could also help explain the positive association between periodic culling and seroprevalence. culling vampire bats failed to eliminate regional RV circulation. similar results have been observed in other wildlife disease systems. bovine tuberculosis in badgers in the uk, where reactive culling of badgers actually increased prevalence in badgers. rabies cases in northern argentina were reported as close as 1 km from the area of elimination. rabies cases were reported as close as 1 km from the area of elimination. rabies cases were reported as close as 1 km from the area of elimination. livestock rabies mortality at the limit of the geographical distribution of vampire bats appears episodic. but within the enzootic range of vampire bat rabies, several lines of evidence cast doubt on whether regional viral extinction occurs predictably and whether population thresholds exist for re-invasion. rabies control programmes would benefit from considering alternative scenarios. enzootic maintenance implies cross-species transmission will occur sporadically, making it far less predictable than in the scenario of slow viral spread across a landscape. the absence of population thresholds for RV invasion and maintenance is consistent with the observed inefficacy of culling to eliminate viral circulation in bats. the apparent positive effect of culling on seroprevalence, coupled with demographic and behavioural responses that might increase the proportion of susceptible bats, could have counterproductive consequences."}
