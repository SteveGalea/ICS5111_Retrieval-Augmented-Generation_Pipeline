{"summary": "an estimated three million people in the uk suffer from 'winter vomiting disease' caused by human norovirus. outbreaks are common in closed or semi-closed communities. noroviruses have also been found associated with intestinal disease in cows [2], pigs [3], mice [4], a lion [5], cats [6] and dogs [7]. study in the us identified CNV at a prevalence of 11% in canine diarrhoea samples. association between infection and clinical signs is yet to be established. serological prevalence of CNV in countries where the virus has been detected has not been reported. samples from 1999\u20132001 were collected from a rehoming kennel. qRT-PCR Stools were diluted 10% w/v in phosphate-buffered saline. qRT-PCR was selected as the screening method as its high sensitivity allows for the detection of lower viral copy numbers than conventional PCR. the target sequence is the highly conserved region of the RdRp (NS7) as few as 100 copies of the CNV amplicon were reliably detected in a reaction volume of 20 l. the strain GVI.1/HKU_Ca035F/2007/HKG had not been reported at time of design. three of the most diverse CNV sequences were selected for VLP production. the thermal cycle protocol used with a ViiA7 qPCR machine (AB Applied Biosystems) was as follows: 55\u00b0C for 30 mins, inactivation of reverse transcriptase at 95\u00b0C for 5 mins. then 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, then annealing and elongation at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. VLP was released from infected Hi5 cells by freeze-thaw, followed by clarification to remove cellular debris (6000g, 30 minutes) then baculovirus removal (14,000g for 30 mins) pelleted VLP was resuspended in TNC and further purified in caesium chloride. 1400, 100 ng pooled GII human norovirus VLPs were used as a positive control until a canine positive control was identified. the plates were washed four times with PBS-T and bound antibody detected with 50 l tetramethylbenidine. the reaction was stopped with 1 N H2SO4 and the optical density was read at 450 nm. s were coated with 25 ng of individual VLPs overnight at 4\u00b0C. s were coated with 25 ng/well of VLP in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer. s were incubated with a range of concentrations of each of the human norovirus strains. samples were either animal waste products, surplus to diagnostic requirements, or derived from a previously published and ethically approved study [17]. samples were collected from dogs admitted to four participating veterinary clinics in geographically distinct areas across the UK. qRT-PCR was selected as the screening method as its high sensitivity allows for the detection of lower viral copy numbers than conventional PCR. all 6 CNV sequences listed in Genbank in august 2012 were used to design a CNV specific primer-probe (PrimerDesign Ltd, table 2). the strain GVI.1/HKU_Ca035F/2007/HKG had not been reported at time of design. three of the most diverse CNV sequences were selected for VLP production. the thermal cycle protocol used with a ViiA7 qPCR machine (AB Applied Biosystems) was as follows: 55\u00b0C for 30 mins, inactivation of reverse transcriptase at 95\u00b0C for 5 mins. then 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, then annealing and elongation at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. VLP was released from infected Hi5 cells by freeze-thaw, followed by clarification to remove cellular debris (6000g, 30 minutes) then baculovirus removal (14,000g for 30 mins) pooled human sera (Sigma Aldrich), diluted 1400 and 100 ng pooled GII human norovirus VLPs were used as a positive control until a canine positive control was identified. the plates were washed four times with PBS-T and bound antibody detected with 50 l tetramethylbenidine (TMB, Sigma Aldrich) ed to further testing with individual CNV VLPs. plates coated with 25 ng of individual VLPs in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer. ELISA protocol followed as detailed above. the mean age of the dogs was 5.2 years (standard deviation 4.2 years), with 42 different breeds represented. the gastrointestinal clinical signs in a proportion of these cases were unlikely to be attributable to primary gastroenteritis (e.g. pyometra, foreign body ingestion) qPCR was performed on nucleic acid extracted from stools of 228 dogs. 47 dogs were admitted to veterinary clinics with primary gastroenteritis. 64 dogs were admitted to veterinary clinics with other clinical disease. the molecular weights of VP1 of CNV isolates C33 and 170 are larger than that of the third isolate HK. this is attributed to the length of VP1 sequences being 52 and 50 amino acids respectively longer than HK VP1. threshold was calculated from the mean plus three times the standard deviation of the OD450 reading of buffer-only. the results show significant variation between the seroprevalence of different strains. a proportion of dogs have seroconverted to more than one of the CNV strains used in this study. pre-incubating a serum sample positive to pooled CNV VLPs did not diminish signal to CNV. this demonstrates that apparent reactivity to CNV is not a consequence of cross-reactivity to human norovirus strains. ELISAs were used to analyse the ability to detect CNV strain 170 (B) and strain HK (C) no C33 seropositive sample of adequate titre was available for the blocking assay. the selected serum was positive to CNV strains 170 and HK. the box represents the interquartile range, with the band inside the box representing the median age. numbers inside bars indicate the quantity of samples associated with each data point. the mean age of the dogs was 5.2 years (standard deviation 4.2 years), with 42 different breeds represented. qPCR was performed on nucleic acid extracted from stools of 228 dogs. 47 dogs were admitted to veterinary clinics with primary gastroenteritis. 64 dogs were admitted to veterinary clinics with other clinical disease. a total of 396 canine sera were tested by ELISA for antibodies against CNV. in the 1999\u20132001 cohort, 85 dogs (38.1%) were seropositive. in the 2013/2013 cohort, 104 (60.1%) dogs were seropositive. a new tab Ten dogs seropositive to CNV from both 1999\u20132001 and 2012\u20132013 cohorts were randomly selected to determine anti-CNV antibody titre. the positive threshold was calculated from the mean plus three times the standard deviation of the OD450 reading of buffer-only coated wells. all 189 serum samples identified as positive were then tested against individual CNV VLPs. a series of blocking assays were performed on two selected samples. it was shown that pre-incubating a serum sample positive to pooled CNV VLPs with human norovirus VLPs did not diminish signal to CNV. this demonstrates that apparent reactivity to CNV is not a consequence of cross-reactivity to human norovirus strains. s from genogroups I and II (GI/GII) or pooled CNV VLPs were analysed using ELISA (A) canine serum was then pre-incubated with serial dilutions of each of the CNV strains VLPs separately. no C33 seropositive sample of adequate titre was available for the blocking assay. age was known for 93 dogs in the 2012\u20132013 cohort. the box represents the interquartile range, with the band inside the box representing the median age. the whiskers are the minimum and maximum of all data. study involving kennel outbreak of CNV in seven dogs found no virus detectable one week after the onset of clinical signs. the virus is only identified in approximately 12% of diarrhoeic samples submitted for analysis. a second explanation for the low prevalence of antigen detection could be due to the genetic heterogeneity of CNV. strain HK using a newly designed primer pair. no positive samples were identified using either primer pair. seroprevalence to the CNV strains surveyed in this study has been shown to have significantly increased over the past decade. the human immune response against human norovirus is of short duration (up to 14 weeks) and is homotypic, i.e. the immunity acquired for a genogroup or a particular genotype does not provide effective protection against another genogroup or genotype. at least three antigenically distinct CNV strains have been circulating in the UK dog population. this is similar to the co-existence of human norovirus strains in the human population. it is speculated that CNV isolation from stool samples using qPCR will be more likely in a younger cohort of dogs. this report has shown that multiple strains of CNV are co-circulating."}
