{"summary": "humans are the only natural hosts of HSV, and HSV infection is almost exclusively limited to epithelial cells and peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons 2. HSV can cause diseases ranging from mild conditions to lethal infections, including mucocutaneous lesions in labialis and skin, herpes keratitis and herpes encephalitis 3. the recombinant peptide scorpine (RScp) has been reported to inhibit Dengue-2 replication in C6/36 cells 11. a natural amphipathic -helical peptide Hp1090 can directly interact with the HCV viral envelope. mucroporin-M1 also inhibited HBV replication in vitro and in vivo. the modified peptide Eval418-FH5 exerted the lowest cytotoxicity and highest anti-HSV-1 activity. the modified peptide exerted the lowest cytotoxicity and highest anti-HSV-1 activity. the cDNA library was constructed according to the specifications of the Superscript Plasmid System cDNA library. the peptides were synthesized using solid-phase synthesis and C-terminal amidation in a standardized process. the finished peptides were cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and subjected to purification by reverse-phase HPLC on a C-18 hydrophobic resin (Elite-HPLC) in 0.1% TFA using an acetonitrile gradient. the original viral stocks were diluted in MEM and inoculated into 80%-90% confluent Vero cell cultures at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in a T25 flask. when the cytopathic effect reached 90%-100%, the infected monolayers were harvested and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. after centrifugation, the virus aliquots were stored at -80 \u00b0C. the peptides were added in a series of concentrations, 0.1% triton-X100 was used as a positive control and normal saline was used as a negative control. the absorbance of hemoglobin at a wavelength of 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader. the peptides derived from Eval418 were added at a series of concentrations after a 2-fold dilution (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625 and 0.3125 g/mL) in all time of addition experiments, the peptides were used at a concentration of 10 g/mL. in all time of addition experiments as well as confocal microscopic spotting and flow cytometry analyses, the peptides were used at post-entry inhibition assay (therapeutic effect on infection) Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the cells were rinsed with PBS three times and replenished with a cover layer. the inhibitory effects were determined by plaque reduction assay (PRA) after 72 h. real-time PCR was performed using a SYBR Green PCR assay kit and an ABI7500 system. the forward primer sequence was 5'- CATCACCGACCCGGAGAGAGGGAC-3' and the reverse primer sequence was 5'- GGGCCAGGCGCTTGTTGGTGTA-3' the cDNA was then cloned into pSPORT1 plasmids and transformed into E. coli DH5 cells. randomly chosen clones were sequenced to obtain a reliable representation of the venom gland peptide library. the peptides were synthesized using solid-phase synthesis and C-terminal amidation in a standardized process. cell culture and virus African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) were cultured at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium (MEM) with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Foster, CA, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) the medium was removed, and 100 l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. the plates were shaken gently for 10 min at room temperature to dissolve the crystal purple formazan. the absorbance was then measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. antiviral assays Vero cell monolayers plated in six-well plates were infected with HSV-1 aliquots to yield approximately 60 plaques per well. the peptides were dissolved in pure water over a series of concentrations. the scorpion-derived antiviral peptides were screened at 10 g/mL. Viral attachment inhibition assay Vero cells were pre-incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 0.5 h. the cells were rinsed with PBS three times and replenished with a cover layer. the cells were then rinsed with PBS three times and replenished with a cover layer. Viral entry inhibition assay Vero cells were pre-incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 0.5 h. the cells were rinsed with PBS three times and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the cells were then rinsed with PBS three times and replenished with a cover layer. the cells and culture supernatants were harvested 24 h after infection. intracellular viruses were collected using the freeze-thaw method. DNA content was quantified by real-time PCR. data are expressed as the mean standard deviation from at least three separate experiments. results Screening of anti-HSV-1 peptides from the scorpion E. validus cDNA library were identified as candidate antimicrobial peptides. scorpion peptides were prepared by chemical synthesis and screened for their abilities to inactivate HSV-1. the inhibitory activities of the six candidate peptides at 10 g/mL against HSV-1 proliferation were measured by plaque reduction assay in Vero cells. the values represent the mean SEM of five independent samples. cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity of the Eval418 peptide was measured on vero cells by MTT assay. the concentrations ranged from 0 to 200 g/mL. a time of addition experiment for Eval418 against HSV-1 was performed. time of addition experiments were conducted to determine the anti-HSV-1 activity of the Eval418 peptide. the cells or viruses were treated with Eval418 peptide at a final concentration of 10 g/mL. the lower panel shows the anti-HSV-1 activity assays of Eval418 in each treatment mode. Eval418 was labeled by FITC, and the cellular localization of Eval418 was determined by confocal microscopy after incubation for 24 h with vero cells. the data from PRA experiments showed that plaque formation was inhibited by Eval418 in a dose-dependent manner. the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) was 2.48 g/mL. FITC-labeled Eval418 hardly entered Vero cells. the poor cellular uptake of Eval418 possibly explained its low intracellular anti-HSV-1 activity. the results of CD spectroscopy revealed that Eval418 adopts an amphipathic -helix structure in 50% TFE and a random coil structure in water. these data indicated that Eval418 is an amphipathic peptide molecule with an -helix structure. the helical wheels showed the hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces of Eval418 (a) and its derivative peptides. val418-FH3 (Figure 5c), Eval418-FH4 (Figure 5d) and Eval418-FH5 (Figure 5e) secondary structures of the derivative peptides were predicted and determined using Swiss PDB Viewer software and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Figure 5b-e), respectively. the addition of histidine residues did not disrupt the pattern and stabilization of secondary structures, and the amphiphilicity was enhanced. the inhibitory effects of the Eval418-derived peptides in each treatment mode were determined by plaque reduction assay. HSV-1 (60 PFU/well) was directly treated with the virus-peptide mixtures. vero cells were incubated with FITC-labeled Eval418 or Eval418-FH5 for 24 h. the average FITC intensity of each cell was measured by flow cytometry. the SIs of the four derivative peptides were 18.40, 26.56, 31.70 and 124.05 respectively. the derivative peptides showed a more rapid inactivation in time-dependence experiments compared with the wild type peptide Eval418. the inhibitory activities of the derivative peptides when added to cells during the viral attachment step were also evaluated. the wild type peptide Eval418 exerted no effect, whereas the extracellular and intracellular infectivity of HSV-1 were significantly decreased by all four derivative peptides. the peptides were labeled by FITC and incubated with vero cells for 24 h. six scorpion peptides from the scorpion E. validus cDNA library were characterized as candidate antimicrobial agents. their precursor structures were analyzed. the signal peptide and pro-peptide regions are highlighted with a gray background. cytotoxicity of Eval418 to vero cells was determined by MTT assay. the peptide-treated Vero cells were treated by Eval418 at a series of concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 g/mL. time of addition experiments were conducted to determine the anti-HSV-1 activity of the Eval418 peptide. HSV-1 or Vero cells were incubated with Eval418 at 10 g/mL for different periods of time. the inhibitory effects were measured by PRA. HSV-1 (60 PFU/well) was directly incubated with the Eval418 peptide. mixture was applied to a plaque reduction assay on vero cells. time-dependent inactivation activity of the peptide was also time-dependent. Eval418 showed a dose-dependent and time-dependent inhibition against HSV-1 plaque formation during the viral inactivation step. the inhibition rate was only 23.08% at 10 g/mL. FITC-labeled Eval418 hardly entered Vero cells. poor cellular uptake of Eval418 possibly explained its low intracellular anti-HSV-1 activity. the presence of histidine residues and a well-defined hydrophobic face have been identified as determinants of peptide delivery efficiency. the presence of histidine residues and a well-defined hydrophobic face have been identified as determinants of peptide delivery efficiency. 5 were 27.60, 26.83, 27.58 and 106.68 g/mL respectively. the cytotoxicities of Eval418-derived peptides ranged from 0 to 200 g/mL. the concentrations ranged from 0 to 200 g/mL. Peptides were added to culture medium of vero cells simultaneously with HSV-1. cells were incubated with HSV-1 at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. after HSV-1 was washed out, derivative peptides were added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the derivative peptides showed greater inhibition of viral entry than did the wild type peptide Eval418. the inhibitory rates were 21.34%, 24.07%, 21.83% and 29.72% respectively. the viral inactivation capabilities of the derivative peptides were then further tested. the sis of the derivative peptides were 19.30, 31.20, 43.78 and 159.22 respectively. the inhibitory activities of the derivative peptides during the viral entry step were significantly improved compared with that of the wild type peptide Eval418 (IC50 = 31.71 g/mL) virucidal peptide, C5A, exhibits antiviral activities against HCV, HIV-1 and HSV-1 by disturbing viral membranes. a scorpion-derived short linear peptide, mucroporin-M1, can inhibit HBV replication in vitro and in vivo by activating the MAPK pathway and down-regulating HNF4 expression 14. the cytotoxicity and hemolysis activity of Eval418 were further tested. the results showed that Eval418 is minimally toxic at a concentration of 10 g/mL. however, Eval418 showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition when pre-incubated with HSV-1 or added during the viral attachment step. a scorpion-derived peptide from the scorpion C. tryznai has been modified into 2 histidine-rich mutant peptides. these modifications significantly enhanced the anti-HCV activities and cellular uptake. all four derivative peptides showed the same -helix structures as the wild-type peptide Eval418, indicating that the addition of histidine residues did not affect the peptide structure but enhanced its helicity. 50 of Eval418-FH5 was 68.50 g/mL. the IC50 of Eval418-FH5 for HSV-1 inactivation and attachment were 0.86 and 0.67 g/mL."}
