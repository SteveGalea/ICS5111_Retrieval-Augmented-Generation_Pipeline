FERVmlu1 encodes 324 amino acid residues which have 70% similarity to a part of recombinant mouse-MuLV/RaLV Pol region, half of retroviral aspartyl protease and a half of putative active site. other ORFs have no significant homology to gag, pol, env regions. a total of 2,835,361 bps were aligned with sequence quality value. this covers more than 85% of the entire FLA region. a total of 11,654 SNPs were identified by this method. ++, +, and symbols represent typical class I exon/intron structures reported in human class I genes with all correct splicing donor/acceptor sites. ++, +, and symbols represent typical class I exon/intron structures reported in human class I genes with all correct splicing donor/acceptor sites. class I cDNA sequences from homozygous feline fibroblast cells were compared with all class I genomic sequences by Megablast Search. ++, +, numbers represent all 31 highly conserved residues, one substitution and more than one substitution. lowest LINE contents were found in classical class II and proximal class III regions, at approximately 40% level. the frequency of STRs (1 every 6.17 kb) was 50% higher than that in human HLA (1 every 9.93 kb) due to at least 3 times higher frequency of dinucleotide repeat. the frequency of STRs (1 every 6.17 kb) was 50% higher than that in human HLA (1 every 9.93 kb) Approximately 4 times more occurrence of dinucleotide STRs was found in this FLA subregion. no. of more than 12 perfect repeats or 5 repeats were counted for STRs. Figure 3A and 3B showed similar patterns between DLA and FLA vs. HLA. the level of class I gene amplification was lower in DLA due to the fact that only 3 class I genes exit in HLA-B, -C corresponding region. fervmlu1 and 2 have 140 and 19 ORFs which sizes range from 102\u2013900 and 102\u2013516, respectively. the largest ORF of FERVmlu1 encodes 324 amino acid residues which have 70% similarity to a part of recombinant mouse-MuLV/RaLV pol region. enFeLV represent a full length FeIV endogeneous retrovirus. the FERVmlu2 have two Pol-like ORFs. the ORF1 is similar to reverse transcriptase like sequence. the third ORF showed a gag \u2013 p30 superfamily motif. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) plot on cat chromosome B2 coordinates. a solid line represents average SNP rate (per 10 Kbp) in heterozygous regions of a female Abyssinian cat genome. areas of FLA were indicated as brackets. gene fragment + FLA I-Q + nonclassical FLA I-R gene fragment FLA I-S + nonclassical a. PIPmaker dotplot () was used to predict coding region for only full-length class I genes. + symbols represent right and wrong prediction of exon and intron boundaries in each gene. the DR region spans approximately 250 Kb and consists of 3 DRA and 4 DRB genes. both gene families are encoded by 5 exons with the exception of DRB2 which lacks the full complement of exons. the DR haplotype 2 contained three complete DRA genes (DRA1, DRA2 and DRA3), five DRB genes (four complete and one partial) similar to DRB4, DRB1, DRB3 and DRB2 plus new DRB gene. haplotype 1 and 2 contain the alleles which were identical to DRB*0511 and DRB*0403, respectively, but differ in 31 nucleotides of 233 nts. the DR haplotype 2 contains additional DRB genes designated DRB5 that was not observed in haplotype 1 that displays identical exon 2 sequences with DRB*0212. the location of eight DR genes is shown with the transcriptional orientation indicated by arrows. analysis of the haplotype structure of Fca273 (used to make the BAC library) based on mapping of gene content of individual BAC clones. the DRA1 and DRA2 genes have striking similarity with TF binding sites up to about 4 kb upstream of ATG site and at least NF-Y binding site. the gene has distinct TF binding sites from the other two genes and is relatively similar to those of the human DRA gene. the NF-Y site was found in feline DRB1, -3, -4 genes, and human DRB1 and -3. in class I genes, all predicted feline classical class I genes have a CCAAT-box site plus a unit of AP1-HNF4-Pax-4 sites adjacent to the CCAAT-box. enh.A-ISRE-W/S-X1-X2/site -Y/enh.B [38] reveals one hundred forty-seven human gene homologues with mostly conserved gene order in five subregions. deletion of HLA-A and -E regions in both DLA and FLA, and expansion of the regions in FLA corresponding to HLA-B, -C were clearly observed. the deduced amino acid sequences coding a mature DRA peptide are identical in these three DRA genes. however, significant levels of difference in amino acid sequences in the signal peptide region may suggest distinct roles in this region. gene structure of 19 FLA class I genes was characterized and summarized in Table 5. three genes (FLA I-E, I-H, I-K) had 31\u201332 highly conserved amino acid residues in 1 and 2 domains which were reported in deduced amino acid sequences of FLA class I transcripts from fibroblast cell lines. I-S class I gene did not maintain 5 highly conserved amino acid residues. other class I genes, FLA I-A, I-Q lacked NFB1, 2 and IFN- binding sites, and FLA I-J, I-L lacked Y/enh.B site. newly identified feline retrovirus sequences were assigned as FERVmlu1 (previously FERV1) and FERVmlu2. a proportionally scaled MHC genomic structure was presented for four mammalian genomes (cat, human, mouse, and dog) and one marsupial genome (opossum) three MHC (opossum, human, and mouse) have one contiguous gene content. two MHC (cat and dog) have a similar split form of MHC at TRIM31 and TRIM26 in the class I region as compared with human HLA. opossum MHC, class I genes were amplified in the class II region. human HLA have at least 11 class I genes in the HLA-A region. at least 15 class I genes were found between Abcf1 and Trim26 genes. X2-Y promoter module sequences were found in all DRA and DRB genes immediate upstream of CCAAT-box site. DRB4 maintains this module sequence 7 kb upstream from ATG site and 5.5 kb upstream of CCAAT-box. FLA is unique among mammalian MHC due to the fact that the entire DQ region is deleted. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared 2.84 Mbp 4.75 Mbp No. of SNPs 11,654 16,013 SNP rate (per bp) however, I-S class I gene did not maintain 5 highly conserved deduced amino acid residues in its peptide binding groove. a total of 193 CDS SNPs were found in class II and class I genes. both class II and class I genes had a higher number of nonsynonymous CDS SNPs than synonymous ones. two class I genes (FLA-I, -F, -H) had similar tendencies. MIC encodes c-lectin type NK receptor ligands in HLA. none of them had full length exon sequences when compared with human MICA transcripts. Interestingly, neither cat nor dog genomes maintain multigene families of KIR and Ly49 found in primates and rodents genomes, respectively. the size variation of MHC from about 3.3 Mbp (cat and dog excluding percentromeric, subtelomeric regions) to about 5 Mbp in opossum was also seen in this analysis. the difference in size is due to the magnitude of class I gene amplification and size of class II/III border regions. classical and non-classical class I genes were shown in black."}
