{"summary": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was identified as the causative agent of an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fever in 1930. it has spanned the african mainland, crossed over to Madagascar, and moved into the Arabian Peninsula. the alarming escape of other arthropod-borne viruses (west Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Zika virus) from their ecological niches gives us a potential harbinger of future events. p38 MAPK influences translation through phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting protein (MNK), which phosphorylates eIF4E [28,29]. p38 MAPK, through the intermediates MAPK-activated kinase 2 (MK2) and MK3, can activate p90RSK in certain situations, such as viral infection [30,31]. rapamycin treatment decreased RVFV N protein (NP) production and RVFV replication in vitro. however, rapamycin has several additional effects aside from modulation of the p70 S6K pathway. we wanted to test additional inhibitors of the translation pathway including a direct p70 S6K inhibitor. the cells were infected with RVFV MP12 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. cells were incubated for 1 h at 33 \u00b0C and at 10% CO2. infectious media was removed, cells washed once with phosphate buffered saline. extracellular supernatants were collected at the indicated time points and stored at 80 \u00b0C. CC50 assays Cells were plated in a white-walled 96-well plate and allowed to incubate at 33 \u00b0C and 10% CO2 overnight. drugs were incubated with cells for 24 h. cells were incubated for 1 h at 33 \u00b0C and at 10% CO2. infectious media was removed, cells washed once with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. drug was reapplied. unpaired, two-tailed student t-tests and Extra sum-of-squares F test were performed using Graphpad Prism software. unpaired, two-tailed student t-tests and Extra sum-of-squares F test were performed using Graphpad Prism software. primary antibodies against p90RSK (Ser380) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, 9341), p70 S6 Kinase (Thr389) (Cell Signaling Technology 9205), eIF4G (Ser1108) (Cell Signaling Technology, 2441), RVFV MP12 Antibody (Abcam, ab49900) were diluted 1:1000 in 5% bovine serum albumin in 1 TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 solution at 24 h, all cells were analyzed using cell Titer-Glo Cell Luminescent Viability Assay (Promega, G7570, Madison, WI, USA) according to vendor\u2019s instructions, this assay measures relative ATP levels. Briefly, an equal volume of room temperature media and Cell Titer-Glo reagent were added to the cells. the plate was shaken for 2 min on an orbital shaker followed by a 10 min room temperature incubation. the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 was from EMD/Millipore. the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 was from EMD/Millipore. p70 S6K and p90RSK are both capable of activating the S6 ribosomal protein. p70 S6K and p90RSK were evaluated to determine if they influenced RVFV replication in mouse hepatocytes. cell cytotoxicity 50 (CC50) and effective concentration 50 (EC50) assays were performed to rule out mouse hepatocyte cell toxicity and determine an appropriate dose to use in in vitro efficacy studies. p70S6K inhibition decreases RVFV N protein (NP) translation and replication. p70S6K inhibition suppresses RVFV replication. cell viability calculated relative to DMSO control. se Inhibitor Target CC50 (M) EC50 (M) SI PF-4708671 p70 S6K >50 * 17 >2.9 BI-D1870 p90RSK >100 * N.A. # ND $ PF-4708671 + BI-D1870 p70 S6K + p90RSK 62 1.56 * >40 SB203580 p38 MAPK >100 * >50 * ND Rapamycin m drug treatment in the context of MP12 infection resulted in no apparent change in phosphorylation of p90RSK, S6 ribosomal protein and eIF4G. however, the level of infectious viral titer increased by approximately 0.5 log at all drug concentrations tested. infected cells are more resistant to p90RSK inhibition and/or BI-D1870, a p90RSK inhibitor, increases RVFV replication. at 18 hpi, cell lysates were collected for western blot analysis. images are representative of biological replicates; (D) H2.35 cells were treated and infected as described in (C) the mean and SD (N = 3) are plotted. p70 S6 kinase inhibitor PF-4708671 p70 S6K inhibitor (p70 IN) and BI-D1870 p90RSK inhibitor (p90 IN) decreased RVFV replication and viral protein production. cell viability analyzed at 24 h using cell Titer-Glo. sates were collected for western blot analysis. at 18 hpi, supernatants were collected for standard plaque assay. the mean and SD are plotted. inhibition of p38 MAPK or ERK resulted in only minimal inhibition of S6 ribosomal protein and eIF4G phosphorylation, RVFV NP levels and viral titers. p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and ERK inhibitor PD0325901 have a limited effect on RVFV replication. at 18 hpi, supernatants were collected for standard plaque assay. mean and SD (N = 3) are plotted. PD0325901, an ERK inhibitor, has a minimal effect on RVFV replication. hibitor PD0325901 in Combination with Rapamycin Significantly Decreases RVFV Replication In Vitro We were interested in identifying combinations of compounds that might ultimately allow animals to be completely protected from RVFV pathogenesis. the next step was to determine whether combining them with rapamycin would result in further improvement on rapamycin\u2019s antiviral activity. rapamycin in combination with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 significantly decreases RVFV replication. a significant reduction of RVFV titers was observed, even more so than with rapamycin treatment alone. rapamycin in combination with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 decreases translational signaling and RVFV NP production. p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 inhibits p70 S6K activity with high specificity. hepatocytes were somewhat tolerant of the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671. PF-4708671 showed an EC50 of 17 M against RVFV MP12-luc. p70 S6K (Thr 389), downstream proteins S6 ribosomal protein (Ser 235/235) and eIF4G (Ser 1108) decreased phosphorylation. S6K inhibitor (p70 IN) and cell viability analyzed at 24 h using Cell Titer-Glo. percent viability was calculated relative to the DMSO control. p38 MAPK >100 * >50 * ND Rapamycin mTOR/p70 S6K >100 * 18 >5.6 Rapamycin + SB203580 mTOR/p70 S6K + ERK >50 * 1.56 * >64 Rapamycin + PD0325901 mTOR/p70 S6K + ERK >50 * 1.56 * >32 SI = CC50/EC50. p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870 level of infectious viral titer increased by approximately 0.5 log at all drug concentrations tested. infected cells are more resistant to p90RSK inhibition. BI-D1870, a p90RSK inhibitor, increases RVFV replication. kinase inhibitors in chemotherapy treatments can be used alone or in combination. p90RSK on its own resulted in more viral replication. p70 S6K and p90RSK inhibitor combination could mitigate redundancy in terms of phosphorylation. combination kinase inhibitor treatment consisting of p70 S6K and p90RSK inhibitors decreases RVFV replication and viral protein production. H2.35 cells were treated with a combination of p70 S6K and p90RSK inhibitors. cell viability was calculated relative to the DMSO control. p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and ERK inhibitor PD0325901 were evaluated. SB203580 prevents p38 MAPK activity through competitively binding to the ATP pocket. PD0325901 binds to and inhibits MEK, preventing phosphorylation. p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and ERK inhibitor PD0325901 have a minimal effect on RVFV replication when used alone. PD0325901 has a minimal effect on RVFV replication. cell viability was calculated relative to the DMSO control. the mean and SD (N = 3) are plotted; (B) H2.35 cells were pre-treated for 1 h. cell viability was calculated relative to the DMSO control. H2.35 cells were surprisingly tolerant of the drug combinations of rapamycin plus the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 displaying a CC50 of well over 100 M and ERK inhibitor PD0325901 plus rapamycin with a CC50 of over 50 M. if the effect had merely been additive in this case, the same dramatic decrease in replication would not have been seen. rapamycin in combination with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 significantly decreases RVFV replication. cell viability was calculated relative to the DMSO control. cells were infected with MP12 (MOI 5) for one hour, followed by removal of viral inoculum, and addition of growth medium containing the inhibitors. at 18 hpi, cell lysates were collected for western blot analysis. the current study focuses on kinases in the translation pathway as a leverage point to fight RVFV. we noted the robust phosphorylation of p70 S6K and downstream proteins in this pathway, S6 ribosomal protein and eIF4G. in the current study, we expanded our analysis to other kinases that regulate translation, including p90RSK, ERK, and p38 MAPK. p90RSK activation followed by phosphorylation of downstream substrates. inhibition of p90RSK in RVFV cells did not result in a significant reduction of p90RSK (Ser380), S6 ribosomal protein or eIF4G phosphorylation. in mock infected cells the inhibitor treatment suppressed these phosphorylation events. NS = no significant change in RVFV replication. previous work by Popova et al. demonstrated inhibition of p38 MAPK. inhibition of ERK kinase caused a decrease in RVFV replication. p90RSK ser380 phosphorylation in infected cells was more sensitive to ERK inhibition than p38 MAPK inhibition. p90RSK phosphorylation in RVFV infected cells was more sensitive to ERK inhibition than p38 MAPK inhibition. p90RSK phosphorylation events follow the classical form of regulation. NSs is the main RVFV virulence factor, responsible for suppression of interferon, through multiple mechanisms including inducing degradation of PKR and TFIIH p62. p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 treatment showed similar inhibition in the presence or absence of NS. effective antiviral therapies to date have been few, so we looked at this problem anew in the hope of finding novel ways to fight deadly viral infections. combination therapy can not only slow viral replication, but can be done with lower drug concentrations than what is necessary for individual drug therapy."}
