{"summary": "166 415 interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from 2007\u20132017. results ID-related trials represented 6.9%\u20139.9% of all trials with no significant trend over time. industry was the primary funding source for 45.2% of ID trials. ClinicalTrials.gov is not the most comprehensive database of clinical trials (compared with the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), it is an accurate reflection of clinical trials being conducted in IDs. reviews have been published of respiratory tract infection trials, HIV and hepatitis C trials, and pediatric antibacterial and antifungal trials. meSH terms were manually reviewed, 991 (9.5%) were related to IDs. of 5140 possible free-text condition terms reviewed, 345 were relevant to IDs. intervention terms linked to MeSH terms generated by the NLM algorithm were also reviewed for relevance. conditions were calculated from the 2000\u20132015 WHO global health estimates summary tables [13, 14]. disease prevalence and disease-specific DALYs were derived from the 2015 WHO global health estimates summary tables [13], 14. als.gov is publicly available in the cloud, with access information and documentation provided at the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative website. a total of 13 707 ID studies were identified, which defines the study data set used for this analysis. a trial was considered \u201cindustry-funded\u201d if the lead sponsor was from industry. a trial was considered \u201cindustry-funded\u201d if the NIH was either a lead sponsor or a collaborator. a trial was considered \u201cindustry-funded\u201d if the lead sponsor was from industry. the initial data set downloaded on 16 October 2017 included 256 544 clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. of these, 13 707 trials (8.5%) were defined as the ID trial data set. the primary purpose was \u201ctreatment\u201d in the majority of both ID (52.7%) and non-ID trials.

(%) of subjects unless otherwise specified. non-ID studies by definition could not include any vaccine trials. the largest studies were observed for Enterovirus trials (mean enrollment, 6855 subjects; median, 780), trachoma (mean, 5035; median 1139), intestinal nematode infection (mean, 4323; median, 172), and malaria (mean, 3652; median, 141). of the 13 707 ID trials, 11 881 (86.7%) were assigned to 1 clinical subcategory, 1754 (12.8%) were assigned to 2, and 72 (0.5%) were assigned to 3. the 4 most common trial categories accounted for 35.6% of all ID trials, in terms of trials assigned solely to those categories. hepatitis C trials accounted for 8.7% of ID trials registered from 2007\u20132017. this was similar to the hepatitis C virus\u2013associated morbidity rate in the united states (6.3%) but higher than the global hepatitis C virus\u2013associated morbidity rate (0.7%) trials of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and sexually transmitted disease excluding HIV were overrepresented compared with the global burden of disease. trials registered per study year (1 October of the year listed through 30 September of the following year) for 7 subcategories: hepatitis B, influenza vaccine, HIV/AIDS, malaria, LRTI, hemorrhagic viruses, and Zika virus. the number of trials registered per year remained steady for hepatitis B and malaria. hepatitis C trials registered by year were pooled by phase as follows. early phase 1 trials were considered to be phase 1, phase 1/phase 2 trials were considered phase 2, and phase 2/phase 3 trials were considered phase 3. industry funding plateaued in study years 2011 and 2012, dropping to 52.9% of studies by 2011. the clinicalTrials.gov registry serves as one of the largest repositories of clinical trials. it serves as a useful tool to understand the clinical trial landscape. this is because of qualities inherent to IDs. the number of trials in a category is not always a good proxy for the extent of work being done on a particular disease. hepatitis C presented a unique opportunity to observe the evolution of clinical trials research as new treatments became available. trials progressed from earl-y to late-phase designs as new directly acting antiviral drugs moved through development and validation. influenza vaccine trials exhibited a distinct spike in the number of clinical trials in study years 2008 and 2009, corresponding to the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic worldwide [24]. Interestingly, the first Ebola case was reported in March 2014, just 6 months before the registration of several Ebola clinical trials. this is a relatively short time from the recognition of a need for clinical research, securing funding for that research, and initiation of the clinical trial [25]. only 6.6% of the ID studies registered and 35.8% of infection-related global deaths were underrepresented. malaria, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, childhood cluster diseases, and meningitis were also underrepresented compared with global ID morbidity and mortality rates. the registry also reflected real-world changes in drug discovery, research, and approval as seen for hepatitis C. understanding the history of ID trials can also inform their future and provide an opportunity to examine the mechanisms through which research is prioritized."}
