{"summary": "recombinant protein expression in E. coli depends mainly on the capability of avoiding unproductive interactions of newly expressed polypeptides. such interactions lead to aggregation of folding intermediates instead of yielding native proteins. cys-cys bridges block folding units into stable conformations by linking residues in a covalent manner. prokaryotes share with eukaryotic cells the reducing cytoplasm, but do not have structures resembling the ER. alternative strategies consider promoting the formation of disulfide bonds by targeting the nascent polypeptides to the external medium or by modifying the redox state of cytoplasm to reach a mild oxidative environment. both overexpression and direct fusion to chaperones, foldases, and stabilizing carriers has been tested for improving the yield of functional target proteins. the need of translocating nascent polypeptides through the inner membrane introduces a delicate step since there is only a limited number of available gates for reaching the periplasm. some authors proposed that protein secretion could be effectively modulated at the translational level by modifying the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. the search for optimal leader peptides has been initially undertaken by comparing the efficiency of natural signal sequences identified in the precursors of bacterial periplasmic proteins. a wide survey performed by Beckwith and co-workers identified a strong correlation between hydrophobicity of the leader peptide and export mechanism [24]. soluble monomer protein DsbA donates its disulfide bond to newly synthesized polypeptides that are folding intermediates and need disulfide bonds to reach their native structure. soluble monomer protein DsbA couples consecutive cysteines providing the disulfide bond and is re-charged by the inner membrane DsbB. DsbC and DsbG are the isomerases that scramble incorrect cystin bridges. the active cysteines of DsbC and DsbG must remain reduced in an oxidizing environment. this condition is achieved by the action of the integral inner membrane DsbD. DsbA can be mutated to become an isomerase by adding a linker with peptide binding capacity. these characteristics prevent its immediate oxidation by DsbB and allow substrate recognition and binding. boosting such molecular machinery could result in increased yields of correctly folded recombinant constructs. isomerase DsbC activity could be the limiting factor for correct folding of at least part of the recombinant proteins expressed in the E. coli periplasm. the correlation between presence of nonconsecutive disulfides and DsbC-dependence is demonstrated for eukaryotic as well as for bacterial proteins. functional restoration in dsbA mutants yields improvement of functional proteins. coexpression of periplasmic chaperones and foldases mediated by activity of proteins belonging to several classes and that often have partially overlapping functions. fusions to FkpA resulted in increased yields of functional recombinant antibodies. no sound rationale supports the strategy of boosting the periplasm with cytoplasmic chaperones instead of using periplasmic ones. secB is the natural chaperone that binds polypeptides to be secreted post-translationaly. cytoplasmic chaperone overexpression failed to improve the yields of horseradish peroxidase. cytoplasmic chaperone overexpression was not considered necessary [13,89,90] in at least one case higher periplasmic accumulation of heterologous proteins was detected. fusions of maltose binding protein and some scFvs resulted in higher periplasmic yields. but the antibodies were not functional, while the fusion to alkaline phosphatase stabilized both production and activity. protein A or single and tandem repeats of its B- and Z-domains were successfully used for expressing and purifying a scFv and human proteins. glycine betaine and sucrose were beneficial for the folding of immunotoxin and cytochrome c550 [111,112], while L-arginine and ethanol increased the yields of human pro-insulin, plasminogen activator, and a scFv [50,83]. also the supply of reduced glutathione, alone or in combination with DsbC overexpression, increased the accumulation of disulfide-dependent proteins [51,83]. scFvs correctly folded in the cytoplasm were efficiently transported by the Tat system [125,126]. Flow cytometry represents a powerful methodology since it enables a quick and thorough screen of large numbers of constructs. it has been successfully applied for selecting proteins, recombinant and full-length antibodies accumulated in the periplasm. the simple overexpression is already sufficient to induce the accumulation of the bacterial beta-lactamase protein inclusion bodies into the periplasm [134,135]. Similarly to what was observed in cytoplasmic aggregates, the proteins trapped in periplasmic inclusion bodies may partially preserve their physiological activity [135] and induce stress response [136]. the strategy was successfully used to recover from the medium interleukin-2, beta-glucanase, and streptavidin [144,145,147] also the co-expression of the tolA protein has been proposed for inducing the external membrane permeabilization [17]. the reasons remain unknown and cell lysis does not seem to be always involved in the protein leakage. selection of the suitable secretion leader peptide In the absence of an N-terminal signal peptide for periplasmic secretion, recombinant polypeptides expressed in bacteria accumulate in the cytoplasm. the fusion to suitable leader peptides allows for translocation of unfolded precursors into the periplasm by either the Sec (relatively slow, post-translational translocation) system. soluble monomer protein DsbA donates its disulfide bond to newly synthesized polypeptides that are folding intermediates and need disulfide bonds to reach their native structure. soluble monomer protein DsbA binds its substrates by hydrophobic interactions using a chaperone-like recognition mechanism specific for partially unfolded proteins. incorrect disulfides of oxidized proteins are scrambled by DsbC and DsbG. these isomerases are kept reduced by the inner membrane DsbB. a quality control mechanism for rearrangement of the disulfide bonds was initially postulated and later identified. dimer isomerases are V-shaped and use the structure flexibility of the cleft embodied by the two arms to bind unfolded structures of various sizes. their adaptability allows the recognition of largely heterogeneous substrates and explains the elevated efficiency of bacterial DsbC/DsbG in isomerasing also heterologous proteins. to DsbA increased the accumulation of few mg/L culture medium of active bovine enterokinase and human pro-insulin. however, in the case of Ragi bifunctional inhibitor, a protein with five overlapping disulfide bonds, DsbA activity resulted in the accumulation of non-native intermediates. the availability of DsbC significantly increased the yield of the native protein both in vitro and in vivo. the bacterial RNaseI is a natural DsbC substrate with three consecutive and one nonconsecutive disulfide bonds. it is possible to artificially tune the periplasm redox potential to achieve conditions that allow DsbA to correctly catalyze the bond formation between the nonconsecutive residues. the pivotal role of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases in supporting the correct folding of disulfide-bond dependent proteins is prolyl-cis/trans isomerase activity of Ppi catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the recombinant antibody folding. fusions to FkpA resulted in increased yields of functional recombinant antibodies. no sound rationale supports the strategy of boosting the periplasm with cytoplasmic chaperones. chaperone overexpression in the cytoplasm was beneficial for the accumulation of some periplasmic proteins. cytoplasmic chaperone overexpression failed to improve yields of horseradish peroxidase. fusions with maltose-binding protein and immunoglobulin-constant domain increased production. human proinsulin and pepsinogen yields were enhanced by fusions with ecotin. fusion to alkaline phosphatase has been used as a fusion partner for recombinant antibodies. fusion to nuclear import/export sequences has been used to direct scFvs to specific subcellular localizations [110]. effects of chemical chaperones A positive effect of low molecular weight additives (chemical chaperones) supplemented in the culture medium was sometimes observed in terms of yields of periplasmic expressed proteins. scFvs correctly folded in the cytoplasm were efficiently transported by the Tat system [125,126] Flow cytometry represents a powerful methodology. it has been successfully applied for selecting proteins, recombinant and full-length antibodies accumulated in the periplasm. the outer membrane is successively permeabilized to form spheroplasts. the outer membrane is successively permeabilized to form spheroplasts. recombinant proteins/antibodies are labeled by binding to fluorescent antibodies/antigens. the most investigated solution is based on the expression of a bacteriocin. the bacteriocin induces periplasmic protein release through induced membrane solubilization. it is also proposed to induce the lysis of the outer membrane to recover the target protein directly from the culture medium. the correlation between presence of a reducing cytoplasm and an oxidizing periplasm was exploited by Beckwith and co-workers in their pioneering attempt to identify mutations that enabled the formation of active alkaline phosphatase in bacteria cytoplasm. it turned out that alkaline phosphatase folded correctly when expressed in bacteria hosting mutations that blocked the reduction of cysteines in the cytoplasm by silencing the activity of the thioredoxin reducta a similar process has been demonstrated in eukaryotic cells [160]. it is possible to obtain an oxidizing cytoplasm in a cellular system in which glutaredoxin activity is abrogated by gor- mutation. both thioredoxin 1 and 2 are kept oxidized as a consequence of thioredoxin reductase mutations. inomycin selectable, allowing the transformation with the majority of the currently used vectors. the method of expressing disulfide-bond-dependent proteins in oxidized cytoplasm was validated by several groups. the oxidized cytoplasm allowed the accumulation of functional IgG-like extracellular domain receptor [166], Ig2 domain of neurolin [167,169], chitinase [170], and anti-freeze proteins [171]. a scFv antibody fragment fused to a consensus peptide for obtaining site-specific biotinylation. a bivalent Fv antibody fragment fused to molybdopterin synthase to induce its oligomerization. some Fab fragments were successfully produced in the cytoplasm of trxB-, gor- cells. the strategy of coupling cytoplasm oxidative conditions and isomerase activity was optimized by Yuan et al. [187] who overproduced thioredoxin fusions of calobin venom in the presence of cytoplasmic trapped DsbC. recombinant co-expression of a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase from Pyrococcus improved yields and functionality of recombinant Fab fragment [189] thioredoxin mutant trxB-, gor-bacteria was still effective in supporting disulfide bond formation and functionality of the target protein [196] thioredoxin can act as an oxidant when it operates in an oxidized milieu. fusions between scFvs and thioredoxin 1 expressed in trxB-, gor-bacteria resulted in increased cytoplasmic yields. the structural quality of the recovered proteins has not been investigated. a scFv against VEGF-165 was soluble and active when expressed. in a recent report it has been shown that a scFv against VEGF-165 was soluble and active when expressed fused to sumo. strain, in combination with DnaKJ co-expression, allowed the production of biological active human SPARC in the cytoplasm. in the case of a serpin domain, AD494 cells did not improve the total amount of soluble recombinant protein accumulated in the cytoplasm with respect to wild type bacteria. but the protein expressed in the control cells did not form the essential disulfide bonds. intrabodies were recovered from libraries in which CDR variability was introduced by hypermutation of a naturally disulfide bond-independent VHH or scFv backbone [219,220] such molecules are valuable tools with great application potentiality for intracellular immunization [179,223,224]. enteric coronaviruses were successfully neutralized in cultured epithelial cells treated with E. coli expressing fusions of IgA protease beta domain from Neisseria gonnorrhoeae with specific scFvs. resulting bacteria were suitable for cell sorting and used to identify epitope-specific antibodies. two common requisites for a refolding buffer are the presence of a redox couple and alkaline pH. low temperature generally prevents non-productive contacts of metastable folding intermediates and can improve the final yields [263] oxidative refolding can be improved by different means. thioredoxin-scFv fusion proteins have been refolded. different classes of proteins can contribute to an increase in refolding yields. fusion to the chaperone SlyD facilitated oxidative folding of ribonuclease A and riboflavin binding protein. immobilized DsbA, peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase, and GroEL minichaperone were effective in refolding single-chain fragments. high-pressure has also been used to prevent the formation of nonnative disulfide bonds. some Fab fragments were successfully produced in the cytoplasm of trxB-, gor- cells. a scFv fragment fused to a consensus peptide for obtaining site-specific biotinylation. a bivalent Fv antibody fragment fused to molybdopterin synthase to induce its oligomerization. the strategy of coupling cytoplasm oxidative conditions and isomerase activity was optimized by Yuan et al. [187] who overproduced thioredoxin fusions of calobin venom in presence of cytoplasmic trapped DsbC. recombinant co-expression of a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase from Pyrococcus improved yields and functionality of recombinant Fab fragment. a catalytic cysteine thioredoxin mutant was still effective in supporting both disulfide bond formation and functionality of the target protein [196] there is a logical reason for overexpressing cytoplasmic thioredoxin in double mutant trxB-, gor-bacteria because such enzyme can act as an oxidant when it operates in an oxidized milieu. a scFv against VEGF-165 was soluble and active when fused to sumo. the structural quality of the recovered proteins has not been investigated. a double mutant strain trxB-, gor- has been successfully exploited. the trxB- strain, in combination with DnaKJ co-expression, allowed the production of biological active human SPARC in the cytoplasm. in the case of a serpin domain, AD494 cells did not improve the total amount of soluble recombinant protein accumulated in the cytoplasm with respect to wild type bacteria. in some cases, the combination of AD494 cells and thioredoxin fusions significantly improved expression of functional target proteins. intrabodies were recovered from libraries in which CDR variability was introduced by hypermutation of a naturally disulfide bond-independent VHH or scFv backbone [219,220], and by selecting natural intrabodies by biopanning [186,220-222]. such molecules are valuable tools with great application potentiality for intracellular immunization [179,223,224]. fusions of the secreted protein alfa-haemolysin C-domain and antibody fragments devoid of periplasm export signal peptide were efficiently secreted in oxidized and functional form [252-254] the work performed by Fernandez and co-workers demonstrated that fusions of the secreted protein alfa-haemolysin C-domain and antibody fragments devoid of periplasm export signal peptide were efficiently secreted. two common requisites for a refolding buffer are the presence of a redox couple and alkaline pH. the redox couple (GSH/GSSG, MESNA/diMESNA, heteroaromatic thiols) is necessary to activate the cys residues. alkaline pH facilitates the nucleophilic attack-dependent disulfide bond formation. oxidative refolding can be improved by different means. thioredoxin-scFv fusion proteins were refolded by metal affinity chromatography. different classes of proteins can contribute to an increase in the yield of native proteins. ryl oxidase and glutaredoxin facilitated the oxidative folding of ribonuclease A and riboflavin binding protein. the fusion to the chaperone SlyD had a positive effect on the refolding of the ectodomain E1 of Rubella virus. a series of rational approaches can easily be compared. the main choice is between cytoplasmic and periplasmic folding. the purification strategy will request further modification if the proteins are to be recovered."}
