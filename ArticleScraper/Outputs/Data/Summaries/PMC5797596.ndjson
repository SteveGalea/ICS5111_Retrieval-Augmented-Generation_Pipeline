{"summary": "positive-strand (+) RNA viruses induce extensive endomembrane reorganizations in the host cell to create a favorable microenvironment for their replication. these remodeled membranous structures are thought to sequester virus replication processes away from host defense systems, such as RNA silencing. they are also thought to compartmentalize viral RNA, viral proteins, and the diverse host factors for high-efficiency synthesis of progeny RNAs. serial sectioning is emerging as a method to overcome this problem. a long ribbon of serial sections is needed, and hundreds to thousands of micrographs are recorded from the serial sections. the micrographs are aligned and processed to a stack. the obtained image stack can be processed and surface-rendered by 3D image processing software to obtain a virtual 3D volume. the method thus provides detailed information and contributes to our understanding of the overall 3D architecture of the cell. electron tomography based on transmission electron microscopy is not applicable to structures with large volumes. FIB-SEM uses diamond knife/ion and electron beams to \u201cslice and view\u201d a set of images that can be used to generate 3D volumes. FIB-SEM and FIB-SEM are more suitable than ET for the 3D reconstruction of mesoscale structures. cryo-ET provides a way to image irregular structures in samples prepared by cryo-methods. cryo-EM relies on symmetrical targets to generate 3D images. cryo-ET can maintain samples in a considerably more native state than can be achieved using chemical fixation. 3D architecture of plant (+) RNA virus replication factories. organelles include the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), peroxisomes, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and tonoplasts. TBSV replication sites are derived from the ER. BBSV is a betanecrovirus in the Tombusviridae family. it has a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. the ER aggregates to form punctate structures. TEM analysis further revealed the dilation, proliferation, and convolution of ER membranes (Figure 1A) and the formation of vesicle packets (VPs) along the ER. these rearranged membranous structures are likely the punctate structures observed by CLSM. in 2015, Cao et al. developed the first 3D model of an ER-associated replication compartment of a plant (+) RNA virus. in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-infected cells, the inner vesicles in VPs show no pore connections to the outside. similar invaginations have been reported in the replication factories of other animal viruses such as FHV and Semliki Forest virus. however, pores interconnecting individual vesicles within the VPs of WNV are not observed in BBSV-induced spherules. tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is a well-studied (+) RNA virus in the genus Tombusviridae. TBSV is a well-studied (+) RNA virus in the genus Tombusviridae. the absence of pah1 in yeast induces proliferation and expansion of ER membranes. TBSV replicates more efficiently in pah1 mutant yeast cells than in wild-type cells. in pah1 yeast, the attachment and connections of these vesicles to the ER creates a network that resembles the single network of interconnected membranes derived from the ER that is present in cells infected with flaviviruses, coronaviruses, or arteriviruses. interconnected membranes ensure the rapid transport of translated viral proteins to the replication sites. ymbidium ringspot virus (TBSV) induces the formation of MVBs. unlike the MVBs of TBSV, the MVBs originate from mitochondrial membranes. single-membrane vesicles 45\u201350 nm in diameter are formed along the mitochondrial membranes and around the large dilations inside the mitochondria. the presence of surrounding vesicles that are connected to the large dilations within mitochondria is a distinct characteristic of MNSV infection. the 3D structure of the replication organelles of MNSV reveals a striking similarity of MNSV replication factories to those of TBSV. the altered mitochondria are always associated with the ER, lipid bodies, or lipid droplets (LDs) turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) replicates in ER-derived vesicles formed at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES) the ER-derived replicative vesicles of TuMV are motile and align with microfilaments. CMs observed in TuMV-infected cells are similar to those induced by DENV, ZIKV, and SARS-CoV. immunoelectron microscopic analyses of replication-related proteins showed specific labeling of membrane aggregates. dsRNA was found to be specifically enriched in the single-membrane vesicle tubules (SMTs) as the infection proceeds, the SMTs are transformed into double-membrane vesicle tubules (DMTs) and intermediate tubular structures. 3D reconstruction of TuMV-induced SMTs at midstage of infection. yellow, SMTs; sky blue, rough ER; magenta, cytoplasmic inclusion body; red arrows. invaginations containing one or more spherules are formed from the chloroplast outer membrane. each spherule has a neck that extends toward the cytoplasm. the replicative spherules around the CI also have necks that connect to the CI lumen. the CIs connected to the cytoplasm appear somewhat similar to the dilations within mitochondria induced by MNSV (Figures 3A,B) the arrowheads indicate the same spherules in different slices. plant (+) RNA viruses are highly motile and morphologically dynamic. most of the currently available 3D tomograms of plant virus replication factories were generated from chemically fixed samples. such fixation may induce ultrastructural artifacts due to slow diffusion of chemical fixatives. the genomic RNA of BBSV contains six open reading frames. two of the encoded proteins are p23 and p82. both proteins localize to the ER and are essential for the assembly of virus replication factories. BBSV spherules are arranged along the VP membranes. most of them have a narrow neck connecting the spherule interior to the cytoplasm. this suggests that they are formed from the invagination of ER membranes. BBSV remodels ER membranes and 3D model of BBSV-induced vesicle packets. the spherules are connected to the outer ER membrane. the spherules are connected to the outer ER membrane. SV is a well-studied (+) RNA virus in the genus Tombusviridae. the peroxisomal boundary membranes become progressively vesicular. these vesicles appear to be connected to the MVB boundary membrane through a neck. this may explain TBSV's ability to utilize the ER for VRC assembly in the absence of peroxisomes. pah1 mutant yeast cells consist of large numbers of spherules that are connected to the MVB boundary membrane. the architecture of the replication factories of TBSV in wild-type yeast is thus of the invaginated spherule type. METTEM analysis revealed that p33 is localized in both the MVBs and the ER, while viral dsRNA was only concentrated in the MVBs. 3D model of TBSV replication platform in pah1 yeast cells. characterized by a large membrane compartment (asterisk) containing MVB-like structures with spherules and stacked ER. viral infection thus induces mitochondria-derived invaginations with necks that are oriented toward the cytosol. 3D reconstruction of the mitochondria in MNSV-infected cells using FIB-FESEM reveals that these altered organelles possess many inner dilations that may be connected with each other. this suggests that active MNSV replication occurs in the altered mitochondria and possibly in the numerous 50-nm vesicles. altered mitochondria and lipid bodies revealed by 3D reconstruction suggest role of lipid bodies in MNSV replication, assembly, and other processes associated with viral infection. TEM analysis and 3D reconstruction of MNSV-induced altered mitochondria. the CMs observed in TuMV-infected cells are similar to those induced by DENV, ZIKV, and SARS-CoV. dsRNA was found to be specifically enriched in the single-membrane vesicle tubules (SMTs) as the infection proceeds, the SMTs are transformed into double-membrane vesicle tubules (DMTs) and intermediate tubular structures (Figure 4C). electron-dense bodies associated with virus-particle-like filament bundles are also formed at the late stage of infection. ET analysis of TuMV-induced membranous structures at various time points during infection has thus made it possible to obtain a comprehensive overview of the changes that occur in endomembranes during infection. the strand RNA genome of BSMV encodes two replication proteins, a and a. in BSMV-infected plants, the membranous structures of the chloroplasts change dramatically. around the CI, similar invaginations are observed in which small spherules are occasionally observed. replicative spherules around the CI also have necks that connect to the CI lumen. iEM using serum containing antibodies against CP indicates that the virus-like particles inside the CI are BSMV virions. replicative spherules of BSMV that are found between the chloroplast inner and outer membranes are extensively remodeled. 3D visualization by FIB-SEM of a chloroplast in a BSMV-infected cell. in plants, the invaginated spherules/vesicles formed by negative membrane curvature are usually 50\u2013150 nm in diameter. in plants, the invaginated spherules/vesicles formed by negative membrane curvature are usually 50\u2013150 nm in diameter and have neck-like connections to the dez de Castro et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2018; such fixation may induce ultrastructural artifacts due to the slow diffusion of chemical fixatives. such fixation may induce ultrastructural artifacts due to the slow diffusion of chemical fixatives and selective cross-linking by chemical fixatives. we list some typical plant viral proteins and host factors that directly function in cellular remodeling. below, we discuss some viruses that have been studied in terms of the viral and host factors that are required for the production of their replication factories. X2 ER \u2013 Han and Sanfacon, 2003; Zhang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2006 Grapevine fanleaf virus Vesicles VPg ER \u2013 Ritzenthaler et al., 2002 Tobamovirus Tobacco mosaic virus \u2013 p126, MP ER TOM1, TOM2, TOM3, Actin and myosin, microtubule. virus MVBs p36 Mitochondria ESCRT-I, Rab5 small GTPase, PE Burgyan et al., 1996; Hwang et al., 2008; Richardson et al., 2014; Xu and Nagy, 2016 Tomato bushy stunt virus MVBs p33, RNA Peroxisome ESCRT-I, ESCRT-III, Bro1p, Vps4AAA+ ATPa MV replication is highly associated with the ER. in yeast, expression of BMV replication proteins 1a and 2a and of RNA3 derivatives can also support BMV RNA replication. in plant cells, BMV infection induces the formation of ER-derived vesicular structures. intramolecular and intermolecular interactions cause hundreds of 1a monomers to form an inner shell that induces the formation of 50\u201370 nm spherules. ESCRT-III effector Snf7p interacts strongly with BMV 1a and is recruited to sites of TBSV-induced spherules. deletion of Snf7p abolishes spherule formation and inhibits BMV replication. deletion of other factors such as Vps20p, Vps24p, and Vps2p modulates number of spherules that are produced. a cargo receptor of COPII vesicles, the 14-kDa ER-vesicle protein Erv14, and the COPII coat component Sec24 are required for the recycling of BMV 1a from peripheral tubular ER to the perinuclear ER membrane. deletion of Erv14 leads to decreased numbers of spherules and larger spherule size (Li et al., 2016), suggesting that the interactions between deletion of ACBP leads to the production of a larger number of smaller spherules. morphology of the smaller spherules is similar to that of the 1a mutant. spherule size correlates with the length of the viral RNA template. a recent cryo-ET study of TBSV replication spherules revealed a novel crown-like structure surrounding the spherule's necked aperture. TBSV recruits ESCRT proteins for membrane remodeling. TBSV recruits ESCRT proteins for membrane remodeling. ase to the replication sites to induce the formation of spherule-like structures. deletion of Vsp4 leads to the formation of crescent-like membrane structures that lack neck-like openings. similar results have also been reported for other tombusviruses. replication proteins p33 and p92 bind directly to sterols in vitro. TBSV p33 interacts with oxysterol-binding ORP and VAMP-associated proteins (VAP), which mediate the redistribution of sterols to viral replication sites. large sterols may also maintain stability of spherules for longer than that provided by ESCRTs. the recruitment of PE to replication sites by p33 could facilitate membrane proliferation and spherule formation. the cytoskeleton and motor proteins also play important roles in the formation and anchorage of viral replication complexes in plants. the close association of MP with microtubules and ER strongly suggests that it plays a role in the formation of VRCs. rCNMV promotes ER rearrangement for replication by inserting viral p27 into the membranes. EM analysis showed a close association of bulging membranes and vesicles with the ER. further studies indicated that the 6K2 protein of TuMV interacts with the COPII coatomer Sec24a protein (Jiang et al., 2015) this interaction modifies the ER-Golgi interface and disrupts the protein secretion pathway. brome mosaic virus (BMV) BMV is one of the best-characterized (+) RNA viruses in terms of its replication. in yeast, expression of BMV replication proteins 1a and 2a and of RNA3 derivatives can also support BMV RNA replication. in yeast, expression of BMV replication proteins 1a and 2a can also support BMV RNA replication. phenotypes that are characterized by the absence of membrane invaginations and the formation of abundant but smaller-sized spherules are critical for the protein's association with the ER membrane and its ability to induce the formation of spherules. the protein also recruits host factors that help increase the membrane curvature. replicative spherules are not released from the membrane and remain connected to it via a neck-like opening. deletion of Snf7p abolishes spherule formation and inhibits BMV replication. ESCRT-III factors have been proposed to function coordinately with cargo proteins in the limiting membranes, leading to membrane invagination. the fact that RHP participates in the formation of nuclear pores and modulates the size of the spherules suggests that it has a role in stabilizing the necks of the spherules. the fact that RHP participates in the formation of nuclear pores and modulates the size of the spherules suggests that it has a role in stabilizing the necks of the spherules. blocking PC synthesis leads to formation of spherules with larger diameters. deletion of ACBP leads to production of smaller spherules. morphology of smaller spherules similar to that of the 1a mutant. spherule size correlates with the length of the viral RNA template. similar results have also been reported for other animal viruses such as SFV and FHV. TBSV recruits ESCRT proteins for membrane remodeling. p33 protein interacts with ESCRT-I Vps23p and its accessory ESCRT factor Bro1p. ESCRT factors also participate in the formation of spherule-like structures. tombusvirus-induced membrane deformation requires lipid synthesis to support the huge proliferation of ER and peroxisome membranes. sterols and phospholipids are essential membrane components that determine curvature and fluidity of membranes. the replication proteins p33 and p92 bind directly to sterols in vitro. the enrichment of PE in TBSV replication factories is mediated by the direct interaction of the replication protein p33 with the endosomal Rab5 small GTPase. the recruitment of PE to replication sites by p33 could facilitate membrane proliferation and spherule formation. TMV 126-kD protein regulates VRC size and facilitates the movement of VRCs along microfilaments. MP is targeted to junctions of microtubules and ER. expression of MP alone leads to ER aggregation. early secretory pathways have been found to play an extensive role in potyviral infection. EM analysis showed a close association of bulging membranes and vesicles with the ER. this interaction modifies the ER-Golgi interface and disrupts the protein secretion pathway. 3D reconstructions of plant virus replication factories reported to date have been derived from wild-type virus-infected cells. however, little information regarding the 3D structure of the aberrant replication factories remains to be fully characterized. high-throughput profiling of purified viral replication factories should make it possible to determine their protein and lipid content. virus-induced membrane curvature increases the surface area of the host endomembranes, which increases the likelihood of contact between different organelles."}
