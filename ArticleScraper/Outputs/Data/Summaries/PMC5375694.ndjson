{"summary": "attachment requires a cellular receptor recognized by the viral attachment protein. fusion may require cellular processes, such as endocytosis and endosomal acidification. other host fusion factors can also contribute. furin cleavage at S1/S2 is not required for cell-cell fusion. mutation of the site (4\u20136) affects syncytium formation. insertion of a furin cleavage site at S1/S2 also enhances cell-cell fusion by SARS coronavirus (8). TMPRSS2 is thought to cleave and thus activate some influenza HA proteins (21, 22) a number of extracellular proteases, including elastase, enhance SARS-CoV infection (24), and a putative elastase site has been identified within S2 (25). a fifth category of proteases plays a controversial role in SARS-CoV entry. coronaviruses may have evolved to use different proteases to infect different sites. this would make protease use a potential determinant of coronavirus organ and tissue tropism, as the case for avian influenza. MHV is useful for studying the contribution of host fusion factors to coronavirus tropism. HM.SD spike spread extensively in infected brains and in neurons from wild-type or Ceacam1a/ mice (35, 36) these properties led us to speculate that the spike adapted to the low level of receptor in the brain by becoming more sensitive to cleavage by an available protease. we therefore hypothesized that JHM.SD infection is more sensitive than that of other MHV strains to a cell surface protease. the assay was performed in untreated cells, an MHV-susceptible cell line previously used to compare the effect of bafilomycin A between A59 and MHV-2 (4). as entry of cell-associated MHV has been observed >1 h after washing (39), the treatment was maintained throughout the infection. the effect of the preinfection treatment was divided by the effect of the postinfection treatment to correct for any postentry effects. asterisk indicates significant difference between the 0 and 10 nM or 100 nM treatment within each virus. effect of bafilomycin A was significantly smaller for JHM.SD than for A59 (n = 5; P 0.0001 for the bafilomycin A effect, and P 0.0001 for the virus strain effect) treatment with the surface serine protease inhibitor camostat started 3 h before infection abolished the effect of TMPRSS2 on JHM.SD infection. TMPRSS2 transfection did increase A59 infection in the presence of bafilomycin A (Fig. 2D), indicating that the effect of TMPRSS2 does not depend on endosomal acidification. mostat abrogates the effect of TMPRSS2 on JHM.SD infection. transfected HEK-293T cells were treated with DMSO or bafilomycin A. number signs indicate significant differences from the no-TMPRSS2 control. TMPRSS2 transfection levels at which A59 infection differed from the no-TMPRSS2 control within the bafilomycin A group. all data are representative of at least 2 independent experiments with n = 5 technical replicates. TMPRSS2 overexpression decreases productive MHV infection and syncytium formation. active-site mutant TMPRSS2-S441A was well expressed (Fig. 3A, bottom), consistent with reports of autocatalysis and subsequent shedding of the peripheral (C-terminal) TMPRSS2 fragment (44). expression of mCeacam1a from the high-level expression vector pCAGGS severely limited expression of viral proteins and release of infectious virus. increased expression of TMPRSS2 significantly decreased release of infectious virus for JHM.SD, rA59, and rA59/SMHV-2. also decreased syncytium formation by a chimeric virus bearing the JHM.SD spike. the effect was blocked by the serine protease inhibitor camostat. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pTK-mCeacam1a-4L and 200 ng of pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-FLAG or pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-S441A-FLAG. cell supernatants were collected at 18 hpi and titers determined. TMPRSS2 activity decreases syncytium size. hek-2935 cells were cotransfected with pTK-mCeacam1a-4L and pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-FLAG or pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-S441A-FLAG. MHV infection is sensitive to metalloprotease inhibition. endogenous TMPRSS2 is unlikely to contribute to MHV infection in target cells. we investigated whether another member of the TMPRSS family facilitates JHM.SD infection by treating L2 cells with the surface serine protease inhibitor camostat. the results were normalized to those from cells treated postentry. a Threshold cycle (CT) values for cell lines are the means (standard deviations) from n = 3 cDNA samples prepared from separate wells of each cell type. each cDNA sample was assayed in triplicate (9 reactions total) data are representative of two independent experiments. NA, not applicable. a hydroxamate metalloprotease inhibitor, TAPI-1, was applied to three MHV-susceptible cell lines. the effects on cell viability and JHM.SD infection were assessed. both drugs were nontoxic and significantly decreased JHM.SD infection. metalloprotease inhibitors reduce MHV-mediated syncytium formation without blocking S1/S2 cleavage. cell-penetrating and extracellular metalloprotease inhibitors are nontoxic and decrease infection in multiple cell lines. we examined the effects of protease inhibitors on syncytium formation and MHV spike cleavage in cells infected with isogenic enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing MHV strains bearing the syncytium-forming JHM.SD or A59 spike or the non-syncytium-forming MHV-2 spike. in parallel, we treated cells with camostat to determine whether TMPRSS family proteases contributed to cell-cell at 5 hpi, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the indicated inhibitor. at 16 hpi, the supernatant was removed and the cells lysed and subjected to immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-S antibody (AO4). -Tubulin was detected as a loading control. stat and bafilomycin A decreased JHM.SD infection in HEK-293 cells. TMPRSS2 overexpression itself decreases syncytium size. the overwhelming majority of infection foci in TMPRSS2-transfected cells were unicellular regardless of treatment. HEK-2935 cells cotransfected with pTK-mCeacam1a-4L and pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-S441A-FLAG were infected with rA59/SJHM.SD-EGFP. at 2 hpi, the medium was replaced with medium containing DMSO, batimastat, camostat, or both, as indicated. the MHV-2 spike protein is resistant to metalloprotease rA59/SMHV-2-EGFP entry was highly sensitive to bafilomycin A but resistant to batimastat treatment. all three viruses were essentially blocked by combined treatment with bafilomycin A and batimastat, as seen in Fig. 4. the effects of postinfection treatment were also S dependent, as seen in Fig. 6. bafilomycin A inhibits the endosomal H+-ATPase and indirectly inhibits acid-activated endosomal proteases, such as cathepsins. the assay was performed in L2 cells, an MHV-susceptible cell line previously used to compare the effect of bafilomycin A between A59 and MHV-2 (4). asterisk indicates significant difference between 0 and 10 nM or 100 nM treatment within each virus. effect of bafilomycin A was significantly smaller for JHM.SD than for A59. TMPRSS2 expression increases JHM.SD infection. both the amount of TMPRSS2 transfected and the virus strain had statistically significant and interactive effects on luciferase activity. transfection with a catalytically inactive mutant of TMPRSS2 had minimal effect. treatment with the surface serine protease inhibitor camostat started 3 h before infection abolished the effect of TMPRSS2 on JHM.SD infection. TMPRSS2 transfection did increase A59 infection in the presence of bafil TMPRSS2 enhances JHM.SD infection in the presence of bafilomycin A. transfected HEK-293T cells were treated with DMSO or bafilomycin A. number signs indicate significant differences from the no-TMPRSS2 control. TMPRSS2 transfection levels at which A59 infection differed from the no-TMPRSS2 control within the bafilomycin A group. all data are representative of at least 2 independent experiments with n = 5 technical replicates. TMPRSS2 overexpression decreases productive MHV infection and syncytium formation. wild-type TMPRSS2 was difficult to detect in cell lysates. active-site mutant TMPRSS2-S441A was well expressed. expression of mCeacam1a from high-level expression vector pCAGGS severely limited expression of viral proteins and release of infectious virus. expression is inconsistent with S2\u2032 cleavage and indicates cleavage C terminal to the fusion peptide. increasing expression of TMPRSS2 significantly decreased release of infectious virus for JHM.SD, rA59, and rA59/SMHV-2. HEK-293T cells cotransfected with pTK-mCeacam1a-4L and pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-S441A-FLAG were infected as indicated. TMPRSS2 decreases cell-associated MHV protein levels. TMPRSS2 activity decreases syncytium size. hek-2935 cells were cotransfected with pTK-mCeacam1a-4L and pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-FLAG or pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-S441A-FLAG. MHV infection is sensitive to metalloprotease inhibition. endogenous TMPRSS2 is unlikely to contribute to MHV infection in target cells. we investigated whether another member of the TMPRSS family facilitates JHM.SD infection by treating L2 cells with the surface serine protease inhibitor camostat. the results were normalized to those from cells treated postentry. 20.1 25.9 NA 5.8 DBT 16.5 (0.3) 39.1 (1.1) 4/9 22.6 (1.0) 17Cl1 16.0 (0.2) 38.3 (1.6) 6/9 22.3 (1.5) L2 16.3 (0.1) 33.5 (0.3) 9/9 17.2 (0.3) a Threshold cycle values for cell lines are the means (standard deviations) from n = 3 cDNA samples prepared from separate wells of each cell type. batimastat and TAPI-1 were applied to three MHV-susceptible cell lines. their effects on cell viability and JHM.SD infection assessed. both drugs were nontoxic and significantly decreased JHM.SD infection. metalloprotease inhibitors reduce MHV-mediated syncytium formation without blocking S1/S2 cleavage. cell-penetrating and extracellular metalloprotease inhibitors are nontoxic and decrease MHV infection in multiple cell lines. we hypothesized that batimastat inhibits MHV S-induced cell-cell fusion. we examined the effects of protease inhibitors on syncytium formation. we also used furin inhibitor I as a positive control for inhibition of syncytium formation. the cells were fixed and infection analyzed by bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. at 5 hpi, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the indicated inhibitor. at 16 hpi, the supernatant was removed and the cells were subjected to immunoblotting. both batimastat and bafilomycin A decreased JHM.SD infection in HEK-293 cells. TMPRSS2 expression significantly increased infection in a dose-dependent manner under all conditions. HEK-2935 cells cotransfected with pTK-mCeacam1a-4L and pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-S441A-FLAG were infected with rA59/SJHM.SD-EGFP. at 2 hpi, the medium was replaced with medium containing DMSO, batimastat, camostat, or both, as indicated. rA59/SMHV-2-EGFP entry was highly sensitive to bafilomycin A. all three viruses were blocked by combined treatment with bafilomycin A and batimastat. effects of postinfection treatment were also S dependent, as seen in Fig. 6. MHV-2 depends on the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L. MHV-2 depends on the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L. MHV-2 can be blocked by combined inhibition of cysteine and aspartyl lysosomal proteases. metalloprotease use underlies the spike-dependent neurovirulence of JHM.SD (32, 33) metalloprotease use underlies the spike-dependent neurovirulence of JHM.SD (32, 33) TMPRSS2 protease in any cell type promotes JHM.SD entry without decreasing overall virus yield. we conclude that enhancement of JHM.SD infection by TMPRSS2 suggests that this virus is susceptible to fusion activation by nonendosomal proteases. but we cannot infer a role for TMPRSS2 in MHV infection of the CNS from the results of the present study. a metalloprotease cleaves some MHV S proteins to activate S2 for fusion. the simplest interpretation of our findings is that a metalloprotease cleaves some MHV S proteins to activate S2 for fusion. we suspect that the instability of JHM.SD S inactivates many potentially infectious particles due to S1/S2 dissociation and/or premature fusion triggering. parallel fusion protein processing could greatly expand cell and organ tropism of MHV. in the independent pathway model, JHM.SD is more efficiently cleaved by cell surface acid-independent proteases (vertical stripes) such as metalloprotease or TMPRSS2. in the independent pathway model, JHM.SD is more efficiently cleaved by cell surface acid-independent proteases (vertical stripes) a59 spike is a better substrate for endosomal proteases in the absence of prior cleavage. MHV-2 might be unaffected by metalloprotease cleavage because S1/S2 cleavage is required to expose the metalloprotease site. some paramyxovirus fusion proteins have been shown to require secretion, internalization, cathepsin cleavage, and recycling to the plasma membrane. rJHM.SD-fluc and rA59-fluc were generated by targeted RNA recombination. the firefly luciferase gene was included between the viral E and M genes. the luciferase-expressing viruses were grown in DBT cells. pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-FLAG and pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-S441A-FLAG are described in reference 16. pCAGGS-mCeacam1a-4L was made by inserting a PCR product amplified from BgpD into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of pCAGGS-MCS. pTK-mCeacam1a-4L was made by inserting a PCR product amplified from BgpD into the notI backbone of pTKbeta. the nucleotide sequences of all PCR-derived segments were confirmed by sequencing. the day before transfection, HEK-293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 1 106 cells/well and HEK-2935 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at the cells were pretreated for 3 h with protease inhibitors or DMSO. the cells were pretreated for 1 h with bafilomycin A or additional DMSO. diluent was added to the inoculum at the indicated concentrations. cells were washed with warm PBS and refed with medium containing inhibitors at 1 h. cells were analyzed for luciferase activity at 7.5 h. no postinfection treatment-only condition was included in the viability assays. the cells were washed once with PBS, lysed with reporter lysis buffer (E3971; Promega), and frozen at 80\u00b0C to complete lysis. at 10 h, the cells were washed and refed with medium containing inhibitors beginning at 1 h. cDNA was diluted 1:5 prior to qPCR. hek-293T cells were seeded at 2.5 105 cells/well. hek-293T cells were seeded 1 dpt at 3.5 105 cells/well. hek-293T cells were seeded at 3.5 105 cells/well. lysates were run on NuPAGE 3 to 8% Tris-acetate gels (Invitrogen) using manufacturer-recommended reagents. proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. membranes were blocked for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C. membranes were stripped twice for 10 min each with mild stripping buffer. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-tubulin (21058; Abcam) was used as a loading control, diluted 1:1,000 in TBST, and hybridized for 1 h. rJHM.SD-fluc and rA59-fluc were generated by targeted RNA recombination. the firefly luciferase gene was included between the viral E and M genes. luciferase-expressing viruses were grown in DBT cells. pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-FLAG and pCAGGS-hTMPRSS2-S441A-FLAG are described in reference 16. pCAGGS-mCeacam1a-4L was made by inserting a PCR product amplified from BgpD into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of pCAGGS-MCS.
