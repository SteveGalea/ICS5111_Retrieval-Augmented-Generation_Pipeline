{"summary": "viruses have evolved a huge arsenal of strategies meant to counteract or deal with this destructive process to ensure their survival. viruses have evolved a huge arsenal of strategies meant to either counteract or deal with this destructive process to ensure their survival. many viruses have developed strategies to inhibit this process through various mechanisms. inhibiting caspase activity through the cleavage of viral proteins constitutes an effective way to achieve apoptosis suppression. the name of the virus, nature of its genome and caspase(s) induced on infection are indicated. the characteristics of the cleavages were also summarized. the names of the cleavage sites, caspase(s) able to cleave in vitro and/or in cellulo. the product of the orf390 gene expressed by the crustacean-infecting white spot syndrome virus exerts antiapoptotic properties. SF9 stably expressing orf390 gene strongly resist both viral- and actinomycin D-induced apoptosis. ORF390 is suggested to act as an inhibitor substrate21. the requirement of apoptosis for viruses to survive is a way more counterintuitive strategy that yet has been evolved by several viruses. the requirement of apoptosis for viruses to survive is a way more counterintuitive strategy that yet has been evolved by several viruses. cleavages of viral proteins were recapitulated in tables according to functional consequences on viral life cycle they were shown or suggested to exert. the name of the virus, nature of its genome and caspase(s) induced on infection are indicated. human papillomavirus (HPV) is mostly known to infect epithelial cells of the genital tract. on epithelial differentiation, HPV induces a DNA damage response that leads to caspase 3-dependent apoptosis. HPV-induced apoptotic markers are limited. first cleaving VP90 to generate VP70 likely represents a crucial intermediate event during HAstV infection. the nucleocapsid protein (N) is proteolytically processed in cells undergoing a lytic cycle or ectopically expressing the protein. apoptosis induction by the host cell leads to exactly what is expected, namely viral attenuation. the possible viral advantage resulting from such an event is discussed. cleavages of viral proteins were recapitulated in tables according to functional consequences on viral life cycle they were shown or suggested to exert. the name of the virus, nature of its genome and caspase(s) induced on infection are indicated. ORF57 lacking residues 1\u201333 does not promote lytic gene expression. cleavage would prevent proper expression of downstream targets and subsequent full reactivation of KSHV, suggesting that it allows KSHV to maintain a persistent infection. NS1 and VP cleavages do not occur simultaneously depending on the pattern of activated caspases. a non-structural protein (NS) is involved in viral DNA replication and gene expression by transactivating P38 promoter. a molecular clone expressing an uncleavable version of NS1 tends to generate more virions. caspase 3 inhibitor and cells lacking caspase 3 both allow a one log-increase in the production of virions. NP caspase cleavage and/or NP-related products may participate to this attenuation. caspases 2, 6 and 7 aM2 (13 kDa) 37, 38 HCV Single-stranded positive RNA Caspases 3 and 7 found in the hepatocytes of HCV-infected patients NS5A 151XXXD154 (genotype 1a and 1b) 386XXXD389 (genotype 1b) 248DXXD251 (found in almost all genotypes and strains) caspases 3, 6 and 7 Depends on the serotype 47 MCV Double-stranded DNA Lack of models for recapitulating the infection MC160P 194LEVD197 In vitro. the name of the virus, nature of its genome and caspase(s) induced on infection are indicated. avian influenza pathogenicity may still be regulated by caspase cleavage. the viral ionic channel M2 protein is also cleaved by caspases, likely caspase 2 and/or 336, 37 in both human and avian influenza viruses. transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) causes acute and fatal diarrhea in newborn piglets. TGEV infection is able to induce caspases 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 activation43, 44 and the cleavage of the structural NP N leading to a stable 41-kDa fragment (N\u2032) in vitro, caspases 3 and 7 are able to cleave both 12S and 13S proteins. in vitro, caspases 3 and 7 are able to cleave both 12S and 13S proteins. the cleavage efficiency depends on the viral serotype. MC159P and MC160P being thought to be produced simultaneously, a balance might take place between MC159P antiapoptotic response and MC160P caspase cleavage. the pathophysiological significance of this balance is difficult to address because MCV does not grow in tissue culture or experimental animals. the functional consequences of some viral protein caspase cleavages remain debated or elusive. the caspase-related products detected are mostly stable, suggesting they could be somehow involved in the viral life cycle. if viruses do not somehow profit from them, viruses prove once again how fascinating adaptability can be. a virus infecting a host cell is represented, leading to caspase activation and cleavage of one or several VPs. a virus infecting a host cell is represented, leading to caspase activation and cleavage of one or several VPs. caspase-related products detected are mostly stable, suggesting they could be somehow involved in the viral life cycle. as caspase cleavage of viral proteins occurs in all sorts of proteins (structural or non-structural) and in all sorts of viruses (DNA as well as RNA), this suggests that it constitutes a strong strategy to handle apoptosis."}
