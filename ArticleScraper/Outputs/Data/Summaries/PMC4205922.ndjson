{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) has had control of the international spread of infectious diseases as one of its core functions since the first World Health Assembly (WHA) in 1948. the priorities over the ensuing decades have changed, as new diseases have emerged and others have been controlled, and even eradicated as in case of smallpox. at the turn of the century, the role was recognised as increasingly critical. GOARN would complement existing outbreak alert and early warning systems, WHO Collaborating Centres, disease-specific surveillance networks and coordination mechanisms. partners agreed to work together to ensure appropriate technical assistance would rapidly reach affected countries and populations. meeting discussed the next steps in setting up the network. agreed that a small \u2018interim committee\u2019 would work together with WHO in identifying and implementing initial activities. activities included finalisation of the framework document for a GOARN, establishment of a Code of Practice for network operations, for field operations and for conflict resolution. GOARN is therefore recognised by WHO as the body able to provide the broad technical expertise necessary to enable it to assist member states with outbreak response. GOARN is thus recognised by WHO as the body able to provide the broad technical expertise necessary to enable it to assist member states with outbreak response. the figures in boxes provide the number of partners and network hubs in each WHO region. GOARN established a reputation for competency in major outbreak responses through the provision of technical, multi-disciplinary expertise and grew in recognition. GOARN partners have been deployed on 137 missions, including 1471 deployments and 31,629 person days (Table 1) in 79 countries, territories or areas.

GOARN played a significant role in the rapid deployment of international teams for missions to china, Hong Kong SAR, Vietnam and Singapore. the role of WHO and the contribution of GOARN partners to controlling SARS was recognised by the WHA. GOARN partners also provided assistance to health authorities in Indonesia and Sri Lanka following the Asian tsunami. deployment of GOARN teams in close collaboration with the operational support team at WHO headquarters. successful development of field laboratories for haemorrhagic fever outbreaks. success of laboratory in Gulu prompted further developments in truly mobile laboratories. a large, shipping container-sized mobile laboratory was developed by members of the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak and successfully deployed to Meulaboh, Aceh Province. the network's partners represented a large body of expertise in epidemiology, microbiology or clinical management. however, there was relatively limited expertise in team leadership and overall coordination of response. the IHR reaffirmed the central role of WHO in assisting countries in controlling the international spread of infectious diseases. the revised IHR have resulted in a significant change with respect to the increased sensitivity about rapid information sharing on acute public health events. the WHA discussed progress on implementation of the IHR 2005. in may 2012, the member states and WHO renewed their commitment to the full implementation of the regulations. GOARN has recently been subject to an external independent review and evaluation. further partner institutions will be sought to expand the broad geographic range. the breadth of expertise will be expanded to incorporate the capacity to respond to chemical events or toxic additions to food or accidental release into the environment."}
