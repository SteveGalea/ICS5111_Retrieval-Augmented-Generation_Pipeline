{"summary": "only recently has the diversity of human pathogens been catalogued. novel viruses are a major public health concern, whether causing disease on the massive scale of HIV/AIDS, more transient events such as the SARS epidemic or potential future threats such as pandemic influenza. we modelled discovery since 1954 assuming a total number of species available to be discovered (the species pool) of N virus species, each discovered in any given year with probability p. the model defines the expected number of discovered viruses in year t. the model was extrapolated to year 2020 by calculating the expected number of viruses discovered per year using the best-fit model. the model was also fitted to the curve for accumulated virus families from 1954 using the same methods. year species family 1901 Yellow fever virus flavi 1903 Rabies virus rhabdo 1907 Dengue virus flavi 1907 Human papillomavirus papilloma 1907 Molluscum contagiosum virus pox 1907 Variola virus pox 1909 Poliovirus picorna 1911 Measles virus paramyxo 1919 Human herpesvirus 3 herpes 1921 Human herpesvirus 1 herpes 1931 Rift Valley fever virus bunya 1933 Influen aya virus flavi 1953 Human rhinovirus A picorna 1954 Human adenovirus C adeno 1954 Human adenovirus C adeno 1954 Human adenovirus E adeno 1955 Human adenovirus D adeno 1956 Chikungunya virus toga 1956 Human parainfluenza virus 5 herpes 1956 Ilheus virus flavi 1957 Human respiratory syncytial virus paramyxo 1957 Mayaro virus tog haemorrhagic fever virus bunya 1967 Human coronavirus OC43 corona 1967 Human enterovirus D picorna 1967 Piry virus rhabdo 1967 Tacaiuma virus bunya 1968 Human herpesvirus 2 herpes 1968 Marburg virus filo 1968 Tataguine virus bunya 1970 Everglades virus toga 1970 Punta Toro virus bunya 1971 Aroa virus flavi 1971 BK virus polyoma 1971 Duvenhage ficiency virus 1 retro 1984 Human torovirus corona 1984 Rotavirus B reo 1985 Borna disease virus borna 1986 European bat lyssavirus 2 rhabdo 1986 Human herpesvirus 6 herpes 1986 Human immunodeficiency virus 2 retro 1986 Kasokero virus bunya 1986 Kokobera virus flavi 1986 Rotavirus C reo 1987 Dhori virus orthomyxo 1987 Sealpox virus pox 1987 Suid her p and N are highly correlated (figure 3), our best estimate for p is 0.015 (95% credible interval, 0.004\u20130.026) with 117 (38\u2013562) so far undiscovered virus species. p and N are highly correlated (figure 3), our best estimate for p is 0.004\u20130.026. the predicted distribution of the number of virus families discovered per year compares favourably with the observed distribution. the predicted distribution of the number of virus families discovered per year compares favourably with the observed distribution (figure 5). the upper limit for N is finite but large; we cannot rule out hundreds of novel human viruses to be reported in the future. the majority of human viruses are known to be capable of infecting non-human hosts (almost exclusively mammals and birds) a large pool of human viruses reflects a high rate of evolution (within a reservoir population) of truly novel species capable of infecting humans. this reflects a high rate of evolution (within a reservoir population) of truly novel species capable of infecting humans."}
