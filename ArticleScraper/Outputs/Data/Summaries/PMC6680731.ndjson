{"summary": "commercial poultry production is associated with a variety of environmental, technological, nutritional and biological/internal stressors. overproduction of free radicals, compromised antioxidant defences and oxidative stress are the leading causes of the detrimental consequences of stress in poultry. integrated antioxidant defence systems were developed in poultry. stressors in poultry production can be re-established by coordinated action of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal system, the autonomic nervous system and the immune system. under mild stress conditions, homeostasis can be re-established by coordinated action of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal system, the autonomic nervous system and the immune system. Stresses References Technological stressors Chick placement [1,17,18,19,20,21,22] Increased stocking density [23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31] Prolonged egg storage, egg transportation, inadequate egg storage conditions, incorrect incubation regime [1,18,19] Environmental stressors Inadequate temperature [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39] Inadequate lightning [1,18,19,42 oxidative stress occurs once the ROS/RNS production exceeds the ability of the antioxidant defence system to neutralise them. oxidative stress occurs and important biological molecules, including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PAFAs), proteins and DNA can be damaged. redox signalling, transcription factor (Nrf2) and vitagene activation are the main elements of the anti-stress strategy. enzymatic systems responsible for damaged molecule repair play an important role in preventing accumulation of damaged molecules and maintaining proteostasis. apoptosis, autophagy and other processes dealing with terminally damaged cells to remove them are important elements of the antioxidant defence network. concept of oxidative stress as an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants and oxidative stress responses was initially formulated in 1985 by Sies. terms introduced were \u201coxidative eustress\u201d, referring to low-level physiological oxidative stress, and \u201coxidative distress\u201d, referring to high-level oxidative stress [99]. stress response is a complex process associated with various biochemical and physiological pathways. oxidative stress in poultry is suggested to be strictly controlled/regulated. a low/basal level of oxidative stress is an essential part of cell adaptation. redox-signalling pathways use ROS as signalling molecules to activate expression of genes responsible for regulation of various physiological functions including growth, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. vitagene network was first introduced by Rattan in 1998 to describe various maintenance and repair processes in the cell. proteostasis is a key element of homeostasis maintenance. the vitagene network is responsible for neutralization and removal of toxic chemicals, tissue regeneration, cell death and replacement. at the physiological level, the vitagene network is responsible for stress response, adaptation and thermoregulation. stress responses of the cell homeostasis restoration after proteotoxic stress are driving forces of effective adaptation to stressful conditions. there is a growing body of evidence indicating the protective role of various natural antioxidants in the prevention of lipid peroxidation and membrane integrity maintenance. protein integrity preservation is the most important function of the stressed living cell/organism. avian cells lacking HSF1 and HSF3 have complete loss of activation of heat shock genes under stress conditions. avian cells lacking HSF1 and HSF3 have a complete loss of activation of heat shock genes under stress conditions. a gene encoding a 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) was isolated from a chicken genomic library. the gene is quite conserved, since the order and spacing of the sequences were shown to share many features in common with the promoter for the human HSP70 gene. kDa protein is responsible for the degradation of haem with the formation of carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin and free iron. in most tissues HO-1 is expressed at a relatively low house-keeping level. it can be induced by various oxidative stress-related insults including haem, ultraviolet light, heavy metals, cytokines, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide (NO and glutathione depletion) avian species effectively responds to commercially relevant stressors. it is proven that HSP70 and HO-1 expression can be effectively regulated by nutritional means, including vitamins E, C and D, carnitine, betaine and some phytochemicals such as silymarin [91]. mitochondrial (Mn-SOD) and cytosolic (Cu, Zn-SOD) enzymes. the cytosolic SOD was shown to have an apparent molecular weight of 30,600 Da. chicken mitochondrial SOD was found to have a molecular weight of 80,000 Da. a number of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiations, apoptosis, chromatin condensation, energy transduction and glucose homeostasis are regulated via SIRTs expression. cytosolic and nuclear targets of SIRT1 are shown to include histones, p53, DNA damage proteins, FOXO1, -3 and -4, HSF1, PPAR, PPAR, UCP2, NF-B and HIF1 [157]. chicken sirtuins share the same conserved functional SIR2 domains. it was predicted that chicken sirtuins play roles in central intermediary metabolism. cSIRT7 does not possess enzymatic properties, but cSIRT4 has been suggested. major vitagenes in poultry encode elements of thioredoxin and glutathione systems. they are believed to be involved in the detection and creation of a protective response to diverse forms of stress and cell injuries. biochemical and physiological consequences of the upregulation of the vitagene network in cells and the organism as whole is an important direction of current research [12,165,166] a gene encoding a 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) has been delineated by Morimoto et al.. the gene is quite conserved, since the order and spacing of the sequences shared many features in common with the promoter for the human HSP70 gene. HO-1 is the stress-inducible isoform of the three HO isoforms described to date. it can be induced by various oxidative stress-related insults including haem, ultraviolet light, heavy metals, cytokines, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione depletion. ygenase-1 is described in avian species; however, its response to different stressors in domesticated and wild birds is still poorly characterised. it is proven that HSP70 and HO-1 expression in avian species effectively responds to commercially relevant stressors including heat stress, heavy metal stress, se deficiency, chicken transportation and increased stocking density. chicken liver has two types of SOD, including mitochondrial (Mn-SOD) and cytosolic (Cu, Zn-SOD) enzymes. the cytosolic SOD was shown to have an apparent molecular weight of 30,600 Da. chicken mitochondrial SOD was found to have a molecular weight of 80,000 Da. sirtuins are involved in regulation of redox balance in the cell by affecting specific transcription factors. a number of biological processes, including cell growth and differentiations, apoptosis, chromatin condensation, energy transduction and glucose homeostasis are regulated via SIRTs expression. heat shock (HS) downregulates SIRT1 in chicken liver. dietary supplementation of epigallocatechin gallate ameliorates HS. expression and regulation of sirtuin family members in chicken liver have been characterised. major vitagenes in poultry encode elements of thioredoxin and glutathione systems. they are believed to be involved in the detection and creation of a protective response to diverse forms of stress and cell injuries. the vitagene concept already found its acceptance in the medical sciences in relation to neurodegenerative disorders. activation of vitagene network by nutritional means is considered a new fundamental approach for improving animal/poultry resistance to various stresses. oxidative stress is believed to activate a range of transcription factors/pathways including Nrf2, NF-B, AP1, TP53, HIF-1, HSF1, PPAR-, MAPK, FoxO, NOTCH, CREB, SCREB1, SP, -catenin/Wnt, etc. Keap1 is responsible for forwarding Nrf2 to a Cul3-based E3 ligase with the following rapid 26S proteasome degradation with a half-life under physiological conditions of only 20 min. more than 27 cysteine residues possessing different reactivity and having various functional impact on Nrf2 were identified in Keap1. cytosolic transcription factor Nrf2 is kept at low levels being bound to Keap1 by the ubiquitin ligase complex Cullin (Cul)3-RING-box protein (Cul3) this complex ubiquitinates Nrf2, triggering its constant proteasomal degradation. this prevents Nrf2 proteasomal degradation and Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus. phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser40 by protein kinase C and PERK. phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser40 by protein kinase C and PERK. phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser40 by protein kinase C and PERK. protein\u2013protein interaction between p62 and Keap1. redox balance Thioredoxin peroxidase (peroxiredoxins) PRDX1 Reduction of hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides Heme oxygenase 1 HO-1 Heme degradation to carbon monoxide Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; G6PD 6PGDH Generation of NADPH. Nrf2 initiates synthesis of enzymes of the first cellular GSH preserves mitochondrial integrity by controlling mitochondrial ROS generation and apoptotic signalling. in stress conditions, GSH plays a vital role as a redox buffer (GSH/GSSG; [212] controlling the redox status of the living cells. redox potential causes protein S-glutathionylation: a mixed disulphide formation between reactive thiols and GSH altering the physiological functions of affected proteins. a thiol redox system consisting of the glutathione system (glutathione/glutathione reductase/glutaredoxin/thioredoxin peroxidase) and the thioredoxin system (thioredoxin/thiore chicken mitochondrial Trx2 was found to have disulphide reductase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. increased Trx expression in chicken ovarian follicles was found to be associated with high rates of egg production. high dietary fluorine was found to decrease TrxR activity in chicken serum and tissues. dietary lead was associated with a decreased TrxR activity in chicken brain. at least four different classes of Prx protein have been shown to be evolutionary conserved in chickens. regulation of the antioxidant defence network and redox balance are key elements of adaptive homeostasis. redox disturbances, endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy impairment, inflammation, growth factor stimulation and nutrient/energy fluxes are also shown to provide protection against oxidative and inflammatory damages. Nrf2 is involved in protein quality control by induction of proteasome subunits associated with a decrease in unfolded proteins. it has been suggested that the Keap1/Nrf2 system predominantly senses and deals with low intensity oxidative stress, while intermediate oxidative stress more likely induces NF-B and AP-1 pathways. emerging evidence clearly indicates that Nrf2 can interact with other transcription factors. effects of Nrf2 activation in various stress conditions appear only in the last 10 years. heat stress was associated with reductions in FI and weight gain by 12.2% and 20.7%. oxidative stress was evidenced by decreased serum AO enzyme activities (SOD and GPx) and increased MDA. increasing dietary lycopene levels alleviated the detrimental changes in the Nrf2 system due to the HS. mRNA levels of Nrf2, NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 and HO-1 were downregulated at day 1 post-HS. cold stress was found to increase Nrf2 protein expression in chicken liver. curcumin dietary supplementation (150\u2013450 mg/kg for 28 days) significantly inhibited autophagy, induced inflammation and significantly reduced Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA and protein levels. however, curcumin dietary supplementation (150\u2013450 mg/kg) was shown to significantly ameliorate AFB1-induced decreases in Nrf2 and HO-1 mRNA and protein expression levels. in three-week-old broilers, ochratoxin A (OTA) vanadium downregulated Nrf2, NQO1 and HO-1 mRNA expression in laying hens. hens were fed with four experimental diets containing graded levels of mercury at 0.280, 3.325, 9.415 and 27.240 mg/kg. similar inhibitory effects of Hg on Nrf2 expression were observed in the layer liver and kidney. addition of 400 or 800 g/ml N-acetylcysteine suppressed the LPS-enhanced expressions of Nrf2, GPx and Keap1 genes. it seems likely that, similar to other stress conditions, the response of Nrf2 can be up- or downregulated by LPS. further increases in boron supplementation were associated with the trend of downregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. mild nutritional stress was associated with increased Nrf2 expression as an adaptive response. but a long-term action of a stressor was associated with decreased Nrf2 expression. chickens fed with a 3.5 g/kg FGBL diet were characterised by increased body weight gain, feed intake and relative weight of duodenum. serum MDA concentration was shown to be decreased and the catalase and SOD activities increased in all the ML-supplemented groups. Probiotics Dietary tryptophan (0.08\u20130.16%) shown to decrease GSH and the GSH/GSSG ratio in plasma and increase Nrf2 and TNF- gene expression in the ileal mucosa of hens. dietary methionine levels (2.00, 2.75, 3.50, 4.25, 5.00 or 5.75 g/kg for 24 weeks. can prevent/decrease stress-related detrimental changes in poultry. oxidative stress occurs leading to detrimental consequences in terms of the productive and reproductive performance of poultry. redox balance and in activities of transcription factors such as Nrf2/Keap1 and NF-B/ IB/IKK provide adaptive cell responses to oxidants and stress stimuli. there is still no complete consensus on molecular mechanisms explaining the beneficial or deleterious effects of ROS on biomolecules and cellular functions. reduction in feed intake (FI) by 9.7% and egg production by 14.4%. decreased hepatic Nrf2 expression was observed. inclusion of epigallocatechin-3-gallate at 200 or 400 mg/kg restored the altered expression of Nrf2 by HS. curcumin supplementation (50\u2013200 mg/kg) was shown to improve AO defences of HS-exposed broilers, as evidenced by increasing the GSH content and GSH-related enzyme activities. birds in the HS group showed increased MDA, protein carbonyl (PC), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and some apoptosis markers, including caspase-3 and caspase-9 mRNA levels and activity. mycotoxins In ovo exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was shown to upregulate Nrf2 expression in both domesticated and wild turkey embryos. this was associated with upregulated mRNA expression of Nrf2, but downregulated mRNA expression levels of NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase 1, SOD and HO-1. a high level of Se dietary supplementation (2 mg/kg as sodium selenite) was associated with significantly decreased accumulation of Nrf2 in the spleen nucleus compared with the corresponding control group. an inhibitory effect of Hg on the Nrf2 protein level in ovary tissue was observed, while expression of Keap1 protein increased. heavy metals in a chicken diet caused the downregulation of the expression of Nrf2 leading to oxidative stress. dietary inclusion of oridonin, a compound extracted from medicinal herbs, was able to ameliorate the effects of LPS on antioxidant enzymes and Nrf2 expression. iron dietary supplementation at 700 or 1400 mg Fe/kg was shown to significantly increase Nrf2 gene expression in jejunum of 21 day old Chinese fast growing Yellow broilers. expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the liver and jejunum of broilers fed a diet containing soybean meal (SBM) heated at 100 \u00b0C for 8 h was significantly decreased in comparison to birds fed the control diet containing untreated SBM for 42 days. the upregulation of Nrf2 expression was not able to mitigate cerebrum oxidative stress in newly hatched chicks. low-current and high-frequency electrical stunning was shown to create oxidative stress and increase lipid peroxidation. in such conditions, increased Nrf2 gene expression in breast muscle of broilers due to the electrical stunning was not fully able to protect tissues against the aforementioned oxidative stress. a 3.5 g/kg FGBL diet were characterised by increased body weight gain, feed intake and relative weight of duodenum. antioxidant and digestive enzyme activities were increased and MDA concentration decreased in the pancreas and small intestine of the experimental birds. this was associated with reduction of serum MDA and downregulation of the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and Bax at the protein level in ovarian tissues. maternal dietary Met enhanced gene expression of GPx1, HO-1 and Nrf2. increased activity of GPX and T-AOC and reduced carbonylated protein in hatchlings. dietary probiotic Bacillus subtilis increased antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability of chicken breast muscle during storage. f2 expression in breast muscle was much higher in the modern broiler compared to the foundational BPR line [299], and it was suggested Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathways are involved in breast muscle growth in chickens. eukaryotic cell can adapt to various forms of oxidative, electrophilic, thermal, inflammatory and other stressors. there is a delicate balance between Nrf2 and NF-B expression in various tissues. increased NF-B expression due to the presence of moderate stressors can cause compensatory increases in expression of Nrf2. however, an increased NF-B expression will be associated with a decreased Nrf2 expression. the Nrf2 pathway is shown to play a vital role in health resilience. it can be made more robust and responsive by certain dietary factors. it is a challenge to develop a system of optimal antioxidant supplementation. the development of vitagene-regulating nutritional supplements is on the agenda of many commercial companies worldwide. one successful example could be a complex mixture of nutrients including carnitine, betaine, vitamins, minerals, organic acids, etc."}
