{"summary": "toll-like receptor pathways are key regulators of SARS-CoV pathogenesis. a previous study that assayed host mRNA responses in C57BL/6J mice infected with 102, 103, 104, or 105 PFU doses of SARS-CoV yielded a highly prioritized list of candidate genes involved in the host response to SARS-CoV. infection of TLR3/ and C57BL/6NJ mice with SARS-CoV showed significantly greater weight loss in TLR3/ mice than in wild-type mice. viral titers were significantly higher in the TLR3/ mice than in wild-type mice (***, P 0.001 [by Student\u2019s unpaired t test]) 10-week-old female TLR3/ mice and wild-type C57BL/6NJ mice were infected intranasally with 105 PFU of recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15\u2013SARS-CoV) to observe differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV disease. wild-type mice experienced transient weight loss that peaked on day 3 postinfection. increased SARS-CoV disease measured by aberrant lung function parameters. TLR3 regulates downstream responses of several key proinflammatory cytokines. TLR3 regulates the induction of type I interferon and downstream signaling by ISGs. RNA expression profiles of cytokines and ISGs downstream of TLR3 signaling measured by microarray analysis of IL-6 (B), TNF (C), CCL5 (D), IFN- (E), IFN- (F), RSAD2 (G), CXCL10 (H) and IFIT1 (I) from mice infected with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV normalized to mock-infected, PBS-inoculated TLR3/ or wild-type mice cleared virus to levels below the limit of detection of the plaque assay, but there was still detectable virus in the lungs of TRIF/ mice. TRIF/ mice had more-severe SARS-CoV clinical disease signs than TLR3/ mice, leading to a lethal phenotype from SARS-CoV infection in the TRIF/ mice. TRIF/ mice are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. whole-body plethysmography was used to measure changes in lung function in TRIF/ mice over the course of the SARS-CoV infection. TRIF/ mice had significantly higher levels of enhanced pause (PENH) on days 2 to 6 postinfection. wild-type mice RPEF values recovered to basal levels by day 4 postinfection. significantly more viral antigen was present in the lungs of TRIF/ mice. infected cells in both the C57BL/6J and TRIF/ mice were morphologically consistent with ciliated airway epithelial cells. observation of the immunohistochemistry did not reveal any evidence that SARS-CoV infection of TRIF/ mice occurs in cell types other than those infected in C57BL/6J mice. TRIF/ mock-inoculated mice and C57BL/6J mock-inoculated mice were also evaluated as negative controls. TLR4/ mice and wild-type C57BL6/J mice lost a greater percentage of starting weight compared to wild-type mice on days 3 to 7 postinfection. TLR4/ mice had significantly higher titers of virus in the lungs than wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV. TLR4/ and TRAM/ mice infected with SARS-CoV were infected intranasally with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV. weight loss was measured each day postinfection, and TRAM/ mice lost significantly more weight than wild-type mice on days 3 to 7 postinfection. both TRAM/ mice and wild-type mice had no detectable virus in the lungs by day 7 postinfection. differences in chemokines downstream of TRIF/ signaling would be altered in TRIF/ mice compared to wild-type mice. expression of ISGs downstream of IFN, including RSAD2, CXCL10, and IFIT1, was greatly reduced in TRIF/ mice infected with SARS-CoV on day 2 postinfection. expression of ISGs downstream of IFN, including RSAD2, CXCL10, and IFIT1, was greatly reduced in TRIF/ mice infected with SARS-CoV on day 2 postinfection. TRIF/ mice infected with SARS-CoV have significantly higher protein levels of IFN- measured by ELISA on day 2 and day 4 postinfection. RNA expression profiles of ISGs measured by qPCR analysis of RSAD2 (F), CXCL10 (G), and IFIT1 (H) in TRIF/ mice (red bars) or wild-type C57BL/6J mice (black bars) infected with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV there were significantly more neutrophils in the lungs of TRIF/ mice infected with SARS-CoV than in lungs of wild-type mice on day 4 postinfection. by day 6 postinfection there were no significant differences in neutrophils. there were significantly more Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes in the TRIF/ mice infected with SARS-CoV on day 4 postinfection. there was no difference between wild-type and TRIF/ mice in the Ly6Clo population of monocytes on day 4 postinfection. wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV had significantly more Ly6Clo regulatory monocytes on day 6 postinfection. at day 6 postinfection there were significantly more alveolar macrophages and pDCs in the lungs of TRIF/ mice infected with SARS-CoV than in the lungs of wild-type mice. the total numbers of lymphocytes were not significantly different between TRIF/ mice and wild-type mice at day 4 or day a mouse model of the recombinant mouse-adapted rMA15\u2013SARS-CoV virus used in this study has been previously described. rMA15\u2013SARS-CoV virus was propagated on vero E6 cells. the following strains of age-matched female mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. at 10 weeks of age, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine. whole lungs were harvested from groups of 3 to 4 mock-treated wild-type and TRIF/ mice and 4 to 5 SARS-CoV-infected wild-type and TRIF/ mice. scores for gross hemorrhage were recorded by observation of the lung during necropsy using a scale ranging from a value of zero, indicating no hemorrhage, to a value of 4. for histological analysis, the entire right lobe of lungs from infected or mock-treated wild-type and knockout mice was fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and prepared in 5-m-thick sections for hematoxylin and eos enhanced pause (PENH), tidal midexpiratory flow (EF50) and ratio of TPEF to Te (RPEF) PENH is an empirical measure calculated by T e T r * PEF PIF, where PEF is the peak expiratory flow, Te represents the time of expiration, and Tr represents the relaxation time to 36% of the peak expiration pressure (62). expression from groups of 4 rMA15\u2013SARS-CoV-infected mice normalized to mock (PBS)-inoculated mice. normalized fold change was calculated using the threshold cycle (CT) method. levels of IFN- were quantified using a veriKine mouse IFN- enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. a linear fit model was used to determine differential expression (DE) for each transcript, requiring an absolute log2 (fold change) value of >1.5 as well as an adjusted false-discovery-rate (FDR) P value of 0.05. the full data set has been deposited in the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) gene expression Omnibus (GEO) database. wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV returned to basal PENH values by day 4 postinfection. but wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV retained significantly higher PENH values. TRIF/ mice showed signs of severe lung dysfunction by whole-body plethysmography. TRIF/ mice showed signs of severe lung dysfunction by whole-body plethysmography. wild-type and TRIF/ mice showed signs of SARS-CoV disease. the lung function parameters of TLR4/ mice (A to C) and TRAM/ mice (D to F) were measured daily along with those of wild-type mice and mock-inoculated controls. differences from wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV were observed. the levels of chemokines CCL2 (A), CCL3 (B), CCL7 (C) and CCL8 (D) were measured at day 2 and day 4 postinfection. chemokines that influence neutrophil chemotaxis, including CXCL1 (E), CXCL2 (F), and CXCL3 (G), were measured at day 2 and day 4 postinfection."}
