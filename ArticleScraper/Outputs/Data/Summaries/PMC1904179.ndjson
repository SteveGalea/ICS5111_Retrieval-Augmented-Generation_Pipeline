{"summary": "transfusion medicine is a relatively young field that has developed only since the second half of the last century. in the past, the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI) was accepted by patients and physicians as unavoidable, but a low-risk blood supply is expected today. donor exclusion criteria, such as a history of hepatitis or transfusions in the past six months have been in place since early on. bacterial contamination is more frequent in platelet concentrates (PLT) than in red blood components most likely because many microorganisms can survive and propagate under storage conditions typically used for PLT (20\u201324\u00b0C), but less so for RBC (1\u20136\u00b0C) the estimated incidence rates of bacterial TTI with clinical consequences range from one in 70,000 to 118,000 transfused PLT concentrates tested[13,8,14]. bacterial infections are frequently divided based on the origin of the microorganisms. most commonly, contamination occurs during blood collection (insufficient disinfection of venipuncture site), or during handling of blood products (leaky seals) removal of the first 30\u201340 ml of whole blood from the collection bag might reduce the contamination risk from skin bacteria. improved donor arm disinfection in association with blood diversion has been reported to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination by up to 77% [19-21] NAT is performed on minipools of plasma from 16\u201324 donations. it has significantly increased the sensitivity to detect infected blood components. however, it has some limitations in blood components with very low levels of viremia, which can even escape detection by NAT. one out of 230,000 donors tested positive for HCV RNA but not for anti-HCV antibodies. NAT detection rates and relative benefits can vary widely between sites. a number of countries have added the testing for antibodies directed against the HBV core protein to the standard screening. there is no evidence that pooled testing with HBV NAT is superior to most sensitive tests for HBsAg. there is no evidence that pooled testing with HBV NAT is superior to the most sensitive tests for HBsAg. the effective immunological window period could be longer than what is generally considered. in 2004 and 2005, the reported cases declined (2,282 and 2,949 cases with 77 and 116 fatalities, respectively) in 2004 and 2005, the reported cases declined (2,282 and 2,949 cases with 77 and 116 fatalities. in 0.6% of infections, neuro-invasive disease culminating in fatal meningitis or encephalitis can occur, especially in immune-compromised and elderly subjects. the risk of HTLV transmission in the u.s. is very low (1 in 3 million) and cases of HTLV-related disease after transfusion transmission are rare. the transfusion-associated transmission of human herpes viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) have been described and can pose significant threats, especially to immunocompromised subjects. erythrovirus B19 (PV-B19) is a non-enveloped erythrovirus which infects hematopoietic cells. in healthy individuals, PV-B19 infection via the respiratory route leads to erythema infectiosum (Fifth disease), usually a mild and self-limited childhood disease that manifest itself in adults with fever, rash, myalgia, and arthropathy. 1.6% of 25,000 donors screened were found to be HGV RNA positive. prevalence of TT-virus and SEN virus in healthy individuals is widespread. there are a number of potential TT viral threats for which comparable information is missing. NAT testing has greatly helped to reduce the residual risk of viral transmission during the 'window period' the estimated risk for HIV transmission to date is between 0.14 \u2013 1.1 and for HCV between 0.10 \u2013 2.33 per million units transfused[30,35-40]. a number of countries have added the testing for antibodies directed against the HBV core protein (anti-Hbc) to the standard screening in an attempt to detect chronic virus carriers with low-level viremia. the residual risk of TT HBV infection varies between 0.75 per million blood donations in Australia, 3.6 \u2013 8.5 in the USA and Canada, 0.91 \u2013 8.7 in Northern Europe, 7.5 \u2013 13.9 in Southern Europe up to 200 per million donations in Hong Kong. west Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne RNA virus of the flavivirus family, is an emerging TT agent with potential future importance for the North American continent. a total of 4,200 cases of WNV infections were reported to the center for disease control and prevention (CDC) by 2003 the number hadrisen to 9,858 cases including 262 deaths. human T cell lymphotropic viruses I and II are associated with adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. both retroviruses have also been attributed a role in the increased risk for developing severe asthma, respiratory and urinary tract infections, uveitis and dermatitis. a human gamma-herpesvirus is the causative agent of Kaposi's Sarcoma. a human gamma-herpesvirus is the probable cause of multicentric Castleman's disease and primary effusion lymphoma. there is evidence that HHV-8 can be transmitted via blood transfusion or solid organ transplantation. hepatitis a virus (HAV) and HEV (HEV) have been shown to be at least occasionally transmissible via blood transfusion. a vaccine is available for HAV and HEV transfusion-transmissions. there are some other viral agents such as HGV (hepatitis G virus, also known as GB virus type C), TT-virus and SEN virus. malaria is endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions of africa with up to 300 million infections and one million deaths annually[100]. malaria is caused by one of the four species of Plasmodium, (falciparum, vivax, malariae and oval), which are mosquito-borne intraerythrocytic parasites that infect liver and red blood cells. TT malaria is endemic in central and south America and parts of mexico. patients from endemic areas may be chronic carriers of the parasite. a study performed in the united states found a noticeable seroprevalence rate. babesia microti is transmitted by Ixodes ticks and can lead to severe complications including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and death. there are only few studies regarding transfusion-transmitted babesiosis, including some reporting fatal disease outcome. prion diseases have been shown to be transmissiable by blood products. three cases of transfusion-transmitted vCJD have been reported in the uk. one important factor to estimate the risk is the prolonged pre-clinical carrier state. methylene blue (MB) and solvent-detergent (SD) are currently employed for the treatment of plasma intended for transfusion. MB is a phenothiazine colorant that inactivates most viruses and bacteria after exposure to visible light. the SD approach acts by disrupting the envelope proteins of targeted pathogens. a large controlled study has indicated that PCT may have negative effects on the functionality of platelets as transfusions using treated platelet preparations had to be repeated in shorter intervals than when using untreated platelet preparations. at least three techniques for pathogen inactivation in RBC are currently under development: S-303, a synthetic alkylating agent, capable of disrupting pathogen RNA or DNA[133]. national haemovigilance systems linked to an international network are becoming indispensable elements of blood product safety and quality. these measures can make blood transfusion a safer form of therapy even in places where the risks to date have to be considered significant."}
