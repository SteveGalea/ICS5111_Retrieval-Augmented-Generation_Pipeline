{"summary": "the etiological agent of MERS, MERS-Coronavirus, was first reported in a 60-year old male patient with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012. human-to-human transmission accounts for approximately 53\u201360% of total MERS cases,5 with droplets being considered to be the primary mode of transmission to family members and healthcare workers. a 64-year-old male returning from the united arab emirates was hospitalized with non-specific gastrointestinal but no respiratory symptoms. a 64-year-old male was hospitalized with non-specific gastrointestinal but no respiratory symptoms. the definition of a confirmed MERS case is critical, not only for disease control and prevention, but also to determine efficacy in clinical trials. there is no standardized neutralization assay for MERS-CoV. there is no standardized neutralization assay for MERS-CoV, and lack of well-characterized animal or human sera remains a challenge. reduced affinity caused by a mutant RBD (i.e., I529T mutant) lowered the efficiency of viral entry into CD26-expressing cells. reduced affinity and efficiency of viral entry caused by mutated RBD may be one of various factors contributing to decreased severity. a study of early serologic responses in 17 patients from the Korean outbreak showed robust IgG response in most patients within 3 weeks of illness onset. 14 patients recovering from MERS showed increased S1-specific serum IgG responses, while 5 non-survivors had relatively steady serum IgG titers. m336 did not show full protection against morbidity, but its prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy was greater than an irrelevant mAb (control). two investigational MERS-CoV vaccines were used to produce transchromosomic (Tc hIgG), SAB-300 and SAB-301. non-human primates (NHPs) such as rhesus macaques and common marmosets can be used as models. common marmosets appear to be more appropriate for vaccine efficacy studies as they develop a more severe MERS-CoV infection than rhesus macaques. generation of Tg mice takes longer than transduced mice. hDPP4 is expressed non-physiologically (i.e., in tissues where it is not found naturally) current MERS-CoV vaccine approaches. 100 MERS-S/MERS-solS Measles-full-length S/solS Preclinical IFNAR-/-mice Paul Ehrlich Institute 78 GreMERSfi Ad5-full-length S/solS Preclinical BALB/c Mice Greffex, U.S.A. 100 MERS-S/MERS-solS Measles-full-length S/solS Preclinical IFNAR-/-mice. protective efficacy was demonstrated in rhesus macaques with reduced viral load and no clinical and radiographic signs of pneumonia compared to control animals. a prime-boost regimen using a DNA prime followed by protein boost has been used as alternative approach. residues 377\u2013588 of MERS-CoV S protein RBD were capable of eliciting potent humoral and cellular responses. the recombinant N-terminal domain (rNTD) of S protein was used as a vaccine candidate and showed humoral (IgG and NAb) and T cell responses. the induction of antigen-specific immune responses may be hampered by pre-existing immunity to some vectors. an MVA-based, full-length S MERS-CoV vaccine candidate (MVA-S) was developed by the German Center for Infection Research and evaluated in transduced mice. a study investigated humoral and cellular immune responses of MERS-CoV candidate vaccines using ChAdOx1 and MVA. a single dose of MERS-CoV vaccine with human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) elicited equivalent humoral immune response as two doses of MERS-CoV vaccine with tPA. rMERS-CoV-E mutant virus has four major structural proteins. spike (S) protein plays a significant role in cell entry through receptor recognition. mutations with reduced affinity of RBD for the host cell receptor were identified. mutations with reduced affinity of RBD for the host cell receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4 or CD26) were identified. this finding might relate to a previous study suggesting that viral fitness and/or virulence may be impaired by immunological pressure such as neutralizing antibodies during human-to-human transmission. serum IgG and NAbs were detected in all survivors and inversely correlated with lower respiratory tract viral load. 14 patients recovering from MERS showed increased S1-specific serum IgG responses. 5 non-survivors had relatively steady serum IgG titers. m336 showed potent neutralizing activity, showing IC50 = 5 ng/ml in vitro. m336 did not show full protection against morbidity, but its prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy was greater than an irrelevant mAb (control) current status of MERS-CoV vaccine development Animal models Establishing accurate, reproducible and predictive animal models to evaluate the efficacy of MERS-CoV vaccine candidates remains challenging. non-human primates such as rhesus macaques and common marmosets can be used as models,41 high cost and handling have been an obstacle. Tg mice are the only available small animal model for severe or fatal MERS-CoV infection with respiratory manifestations and viremia. hDPP4 is expressed non-physiologically (i.e., in tissues where it is not found naturally) transduced mice can be generated rapidly, but hDPP4 expression is transient and limited to the lungs. this technology has been used to demonstrate prevention and mitigation of viral replication by polyclonal IgG antibodies produced in Tc bovines. a transgenic mouse model expressing hDPP4 has also been developed for MERS.

DNA vaccines are safe, produce stable antigen expression, and can induce humoral and cellular immune responses at relatively low manufacturing cost. in mice, the full-length S DNA vaccine generated higher humoral response than the truncated, transmembrane-deleted S or S1 DNA regimens. in both mice and NHPs, priming with either S1 protein or S DNA followed by S1 protein booster induced the highest NAb titers. recombinant MERS-CoV S nanoparticles in combination with matrix-M1 adjuvant induced NAbs, reduced lung viral titers and MERS-CoV M mRNA to baseline levels in transduced mice. this suggests that MERS-CoV replication was efficiently blocked. a human clinical trial for this MERS-CoV candidate is planned. a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1)-based vaccine developed by the Jenner Institute will also enter a clinical trial. live attenuated vaccines have been shown to induce more potent immune responses and protection against viral challenge than non-replicating vaccines. a live-attenuated MERS-CoV vaccine candidate has been developed based on a replication-competent but propagation-defective MERS-CoV strain. another engineered mutant virus lacking E protein (rMERS-CoV-E) is not replication competent. dromedary camels challenged with MERS-CoV showed lower levels of infectious MERS-CoV particles and little to no viral RNA in the nasal cavity. a human clinical trial for this MVA-S vaccine candidate is planned. a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1)-based MERS-CoV vaccine will also enter a clinical trial. live attenuated vaccines have been shown to induce more potent immune responses than non-replicating vaccines. a live-attenuated MERS-CoV vaccine candidate has been developed based on a replication-competent but propagation-defective MERS-CoV strain. the development of potent adjuvants may mitigate concerns that vaccines against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV may cause eosinophilic immunopathology and antibody-dependent enhancement of infectivity. a variety of adjuvants have been investigated for MERS-CoV vaccines. MERS-CoV has been prioritized by WHO for R&D. no preventive vaccines have been approved yet. only brief human-to-human transmission has been reported."}
