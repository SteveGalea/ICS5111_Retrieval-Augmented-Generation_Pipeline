{"summary": "a 12-year-old cat presented with weakness, weight loss, blindness and open-mouth breathing. the cat was resistant to two different drugs for multiple myeloma and was euthanased 6 months later because of persistent poor general condition. urine specific gravity, urine dipstick and urine sediment examination revealed a urine specific gravity of 1.020, without further abnormalities. CBC values revealed mild, non-regenerative anaemia (haematocrit 28%; reference interval [RI] 30\u201345%). biochemistry revealed hyperproteinaemia (97 g/l; RI 60\u201380 g/l; RI 25\u201339 g/l) and hyperglobulinaemia of 74 g/l. Ionised calcium (mmol/l) 106\u2013123 115 Ionised calcium (mmol/l) 1.13\u20131.38 1.14 Glucose (g/l) 0.7\u20131.6 1.2 Urea (g/l) 0.3\u20130.6 0.4 Creatinine (mg/l) 6.0\u201315.0 10 Total protein (g/l) 60\u201380 97* Albumin (g/l) 25\u201339 23* Globulins (g/l) 35 a bone marrow aspirate from the right wing of the ilium was obtained under sedation using a Mallarm\u00e9 trocar (18 G) no malignant changes in the morphology of plasma cells were detected. a diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM), associated with a probable phaeochromocytoma, was made. cells show a high nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio, polygonal nuclei with prominent nucleoli, pale cytoplasm and fine intracytoplasmic granules. a bone marrow plasmacytic invasion induced by cytokines secreted by an adrenal mass, particularly interleukin (IL)-6.2\u20134 Measurement of serum IL-6 concentration was not possible and adrenalectomy was declined. the patient was initially treated with a combination of prednisolone and melphalan. no improvement in clinical and biological condition was observed at days 10, 30 and 45. the cat was euthanased 6 months later owing to persistent poor general condition. autopsy was declined by the owner. biological diagnosis of a phaeochromocytoma is based on documenting abnormal regulation of catecholamines. one of the initial tests performed in human medicine is direct measurement of catecholamines (eg, epinephrine) or catecholamine breakdown products (eg, metanephrines or urine vanillylmandelic acid) in the blood or urine via high-performance liquid chromatography. in a retrospective study of 33 feline adrenal masses, only three patients had phaeochromocytomas. in the current case, the diagnosis of adrenal phaeochromocytoma was suspected on the basis of a left adrenal mass at abdominal ultrasonography. hypertension is present in >70% of cats with an adrenal tumour,7 further causes of a unilateral adrenal mass were considered in the differential diagnosis of this patient. MM is a rare multifocal plasma cell neoplasm involving bone marrow. it is estimated incidence of 1% of all feline haematopoietic neoplasms. it is the most common cause of M-proteins, but other conditions can occasionally induce a monoclonal gammopathy in cats. myeloma cases with immunoelectrophoresis results, 22 had IgG gammopathies. an association between MM and adrenal phaeochromocytoma has been reported in two large retrospective studies. a phaeochromocytoma can produce a variety of biologically active neuropeptides and hormones other than catecholamines. la and a number of clinical cases have reported the presence of IL-6-producing adrenal phaeochromocytoma. a fall in serum IL-6 levels after adrenalectomy has been reported. this is the first clinical description associated with a suspected phaeochromocytoma in a cat."}
