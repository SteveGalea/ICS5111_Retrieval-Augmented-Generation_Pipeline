{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that can cause microcephaly in fetuses and newborn infants. the flavivirus can cause microcephaly in fetuses and newborn infants. it is associated with Guillian-Barre syndrome in adults (1\u20136) mAbs against DIII are type specific, some potent-neutralizing and protective, whereas those against DI/II are cross-reactive and poorly neutralizing. development of these neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV during natural infection remains largely unknown. a DIII-specific mAb isolated 106 days after the onset of symptoms provided 100% protection in mice from lethal ZIKV infection. a DI/II-specific mAb isolated 4 days failed to do so. results Dynamics of binding and neutralizing antibody response during natural infection. antibody binding activity was detected by anti\u2013human IgG secondary antibody. antibody binding to ZIKV and cross-reactivity to DENV1 and DENV2 followed similar pattern. a precipitous drop in neutralizing activity against ZIKV was found on day 66. serial dilutions of plasma samples were analyzed for their binding (A) to E glycoprotein of ZIKV (GZ01, KU820898), DENV1 (GZ35, KP723476), and DENV2 (GZ05, KP012546) by ELISA. all results were derived from at least 2 independent experiments. domain-specific antibody response during natural infection. the peak in cross-binding to DENV DI/II was about 1 week behind the peak of homologous recognition of ZIKV DI/DII. negative controls included plasma sample from a healthy individual (NC serum) and mAb MERS-4 previously isolated against MERS-CoV. depletion of ZIKV DIII\u2013specific antibodies had a negligible effect on cross-binding to DI/II of DENV1 and DENV2. this results clearly indicate that DI/II was responsible for most if not all of the cross-binding activities between ZIKV and DENV1\u20132. a sizable portion of neutralizing activities against ZIKV remained, presumably due to those against DI/II. binding antibodies to ZIKV DI/II\u2013 and DIII\u2013specific yeast clones represent a useful and meaningful biomarker for plasma antibody response. additional approaches such as isolation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies will certainly strengthen and compliment the plasma-based profiling. IGHV3-23 had 4 (ZK7C3, ZK21F2, ZK3-1, and ZK5-2) out of the total 14 mAbs isolated. similar dominance in the IGHV4-39 family was also found in a separate study. epitope specificity was determined by staining with DI/II\u2013 and DIII\u2013expressing yeast clones from ZIKV, DENV1 and DENV2. IC50 represents the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in the plaque neutralization assay. EC50 represents the half-maximal effective concentrations in ELISA binding assay. the most potent neutralizing mAbs against ZIKV were 2 of the 3 specific binders to ZIKV E glycoprotein (ZK2B10 and ZK7C3) with the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 0.04 and 0.11 g/ml. the remaining mAbs showed only modest (1.56 to 13.49g/ml) or even no (IC50 > 40 g/ml) neutralizing activity. t2 were serially diluted and analyzed for their binding (A) to E glycoprotein of ZIKV (GZ01, KU820898), DENV1 (GZ35, KP723476), and DENV2 (GZ05, KP012546) by ELISA. positive control mAbs C8 and ZV-67 were used for cross-neutralizing and ZIKV-specific mAb, respectively. all mAbs in the ZIKV DI/DII category strongly cross-reacted with the DI/DII of DENV1 and DENV2. ZK7C3, ZK2C2 and ZK6F5 had only marginal but detectable cross-reactivity with either DENV1 or DENV2 for reasons of which we are currently uncertain. no competition was found between ZK1G4 and ZK2C2 in the category DI/DII/DIII. however, no competition was found between ZK1G4 and ZK2C2 in the category DI/DII/DIII. the epitopes of ZK1G4 and ZK2C2 were located in the lateral ridge region within DIII (17) mice deficient in IFN receptors and signaling were challenged with 1 104 pfu ZIKV (GZ01 strain) one day after challenge, a single dose of 300 g ZK8-4, ZK2B10, or negative-control mAb against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were administered via i.p. mice were treated with 300 g mAbs ZK2B10, ZK8-4, or control mERS-4 i.p. and monitored for survival (A), body weight (B) and blood ZIKV RNA (C) up to 14 days. a total of 5 sequential plasma samples were collected from patient 1. antibodies became detectable on day 4, gradually increased on day 7. in Pt2, antibody binding to ZIKV and cross-reactivity to DENV1 and DENV2 followed similar pattern. a precipitous drop in neutralizing activity against ZIKV was found on day 66. cross-neutralizing against DENV1 and DENV2 remained detectable. Yeast clones displaying DI/II or DIII of ZIKV, DENV1 and DENV2 were constructed and incubated with the sequential plasma samples to monitor the changes in antibody specificity over time. cross-binding was exclusively targeted to DI/II, irrespective of time points during the course of infection. peak in cross-binding to DENV1 and DENV2 was about 1 week behind peak of homologous recognition of ZIKV DI/DII. depletion of ZIKV DI/II\u2013specific binding antibodies resulted in elimination of cross-binding to DI/II of DENV1 and DENV2. binding to ZIKV DIII remained unaffected. depletion of ZIKV DIII\u2013specific antibodies had negligible effect on cross-binding to DI/II of DENV1 and DENV2. cross-neutralizing DENV2 must be arising from those recognizing more complex DI/II epitopes than the ZIKV DI/II\u2013specific yeast clones could express and present. additional approaches such as isolation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies will certainly strengthen and compliment the plasma-based profiling. the IGHV4-39 family contained 6 (ZK17F11, ZK22F6, ZK8-4, ZK2B3, ZK12G2 and ZK12-2) and IGHV3-23 had 4 (ZK7C3, ZK21F2, ZK3-1, and ZK5-2) out of the total 14 mAbs isolated. isolated mAbs ranged from 7 (ZK1G4) to 12 amino acids (ZK2B10). epitope specificity was determined by staining with DI/II\u2013 and DIII\u2013expressing yeast clones from ZIKV, DENV1 and DENV2. EC50 represents the half-maximal effective concentrations in ELISA binding assay. control mAbs C8 and ZV67 previously reported by others showed expected specificity (16, 17) the most potent neutralizing mAbs against ZIKV were 2 of the 3 specific binders to ZIKV E glycoprotein (ZK2B10 and ZK7C3) with the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 0.04 and 0.11 g/ml. twelve mAbs from Pt1 and 2 mAbs from Pt2 were serially diluted and analyzed for their binding (A) to E glycoprotein of ZIKV (GZ01, KU820898), DENV1 (GZ35, KP723476), and DENV2 (GZ05, KP012546) by plaque assay. negative control mAb MERS-4 was previously isolated against MERS-CoV. ZK7C3 and ZK6F5 belonged to DI/DII, ZK2B10 belonged to DI/DII, while ZK2C2 belonged to DI/DII/DIII. mAbs in the ZIKV DI/DII category strongly cross-reacted with the DI/DII of DENV1 and DENV2. ZK8-4, ZK3-1, ZK17F11, and ZK12-2 recognized similar epitopes. they were distinct from those recognized by ZK6F5 and ZK7C3. no competition was found between ZK1G4 and ZK2C2 in the category DI/DII/DIII. ZK8-4 is DI/DII cross-reactive, poorly neutralizing, and isolated from a plasmablast B cell on day 4. ZK2B10 is ZIKV DIII specific, potent neutralizing, and isolated from the memory B cells on day 106 after the onset of symptoms. we tested them in a mouse model deficient in IFN receptors and signaling (40, 41) mAbs in AG6 mice were treated with 300 g mAbs ZK2B10, ZK8-4, or control mAb MERS-4 i.p. and monitored for survival (A), body weight (B) and blood ZIKV RNA (C) up to 14 days. a clear trend of increase in DIII-specific neutralizing activity was observed over the course of infection. mAbs isolated during the first 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms were largely targeted to DI/II, weakly neutralizing, and broadly cross-reactive with DENV1 and DENV2. mAbs isolated from ZIKV-infected individuals and others from deNV-infected individuals strongly support this hypothesis (31). mAbs are predominant during early infection, are weakly neutralizing, and are broadly cross-reactive with DI/DII of DENV1 and DENV2. many of the DI/DII mAbs demonstrated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in cell culture and in the animal models of ZIKV and DENV infection (31, 45, 49, 50) the potent neutralizing mAbs (ZK2B10 and ZK7C3) isolated about 3 months after the onset of symptoms are strictly ZIKV specific and cover distinct epitopes. development of ZIKV vaccine likely to encounter similar problems facing DENV vaccine in eliciting suboptimal immune responses that might lead to ADE and severe disease. mAbs isolated from convalescent humans represent promising alternatives, as they are generated during a natural infection. 2 infected Chinese people returned to the southern metropolitan city of Guangzhou, china. their flavivirus immune status was confirmed by RT-PCR positivity for ZIKV RNA in multiple serum, saliva, and urine samples (35). both patients manifested relatively mild symptoms, including fever, rash, sore throat, and fatigue, and were discharged approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. t2 showed it was identical with Pt1 in both E and NS1 regions. a total of 5 sequential blood samples were collected from Pt1 on days 4, 7, 15, 106, and 188. 3 were collected from Pt2 on days 6, 12, and 66 after the onset of the symptoms. serial dilutions of inactivated plasma samples and isolated mAbs were applied to the captured E glycoprotein of ZIKV, DENV1 and DENV2. binding activity was detected by anti\u2013human IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Promega) and 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB substrate) single plasmablast B cells were sorted into 96-well PCR plates containing 5 l/well of ice-cold PBS with RNAse Inhibitor (Takara) the plates were sealed and stored at \u201380oC until subjected to reverse transcription (SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System, Invitrogen) PCR reactions were performed using mixtures of primers designed to amplify all antibody heavy and light chain variable regions (53) the generated PCR products were purified using QiaexII gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into the backbone of antibody expression vectors containing the constant regions of human IgG1 (53). the positive clones were then sequenced for the variable regions of antibody heavy chain genes (VH) and light chain genes (VL) and gene sequences encoding the DI/II (1-301aa) or DIII (302-404aa) of ZIKV, DENV1 and DENV2 were cloned into the yeast surface display vector pCTCON2. the breaking point between DI/II and DIII was located within the 11 residues between lysine (K) at position 301 and glycine (G) at position 302. eled anti\u2013human IgG secondary antibody (1:200 dilution, rabbit anti\u2013human IgG-PE, sc3756) on ice for an additional 1 hour, washed again with PBS 3 times, and analyzed with FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). all ZIKV (GZ01; SZ-WIV01), DENV1 (Hawaii strain), and DENV2 (New Guinea strain; 16681 strain) viruses were grown in plaques stained by 1% crystal violet and counted manually. infected cells were then washed once, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. cells were harvested and stained with a pan-flavivirus antibody 4G2. anti\u2013histidine antibodies were immobilized to CM5 sensor chip via Amine group. 2 different mAbs were injected sequentially to monitor for additional binding activity. viral genomes were quantified via qPCR amplification of ZIKV genes. AG6 mice aged 4\u20136 weeks were challenged with 1 104 pfu ZIKV (GZ01 strain) via the i.p. route and followed for 14 days. mAbs (300 g; ZK2B10, ZK8-4, or control antibody MERS-4) were administered via i.p. 1 day after virus challenge. a custom-based ELISA was built upon the full-length NS1 proteins derived from ZIKV and DENV1-4 isolated from china. both patients manifested relatively mild symptoms, including fever, rash, sore throat, and fatigue. the major clinical events, virus load in serum and urine, and kinetics of IgM and IgG antibody responses in Pt1 have previously been reported. all plasma samples were heat inactivated at 55oC for 1 hour before being stored at \u201380oC. PBMCs were kept in freezing media and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. recombinant E glycoprotein of ZIKV (GZ01, KU820898), DENV1 (GZ35, KP723476), and DENV2 (GZ05, KP012546) were produced in the mammalian 293T cell expression system with NS1 proteins of ZIKV (GZ01, KU820898), DENV1 (GZ35, KP723476), DENV2 (GZ05, KP012546), and DENV4 (GZ30, JQ822247) were produced according to the method described above with a D7-tag at the C-terminus. xygen containing 5 l/well of ice-cold PBS with RNAse Inhibitor (Takara). plates were sealed and stored at \u201380oC until subjected to reverse transcription. for memory B cells, approximately 25\u201350 cells were sorted into 96-well culture plates (Corning) antibody expression plasmids were transiently transfected into 293T cells. supernatants were screened for binding to ZIKV E glycoprotein. the positive clones were then sequenced for the variable regions of antibody heavy chain genes (VH) and light chain genes (VL) and analyzed using the IMGT/V-Quest program. the breaking point between DI/II and DIII was located within the 11 residues between lysine (K) at position 301 and glycine (G) at position 302. the recombinant clones were then transformed into the E. coli\u2013competent cells, amplified, extracted, and further transformed into the competent yeast cell line EBY100. anti-c-Myc chicken IgY (1:200 dilution, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21281) and anti-chicken IgY FITC (1:200 dilution, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11039) all ZIKV (GZ01; SZ-WIV01), DENV1 (Hawaii strain), and DENV2 (New Guinea strain; 16681 strain) viruses were grown in C6/36 Aedes albo cells were harvested and stained with a pan-flavivirus antibody 4G2. infected cells were then washed once, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. cells were then stained with a pan-flavivirus antibody 4G2. RNA was isolated from the whole blood of AG6 mouse using an RNeasy Mini Kit (74106, Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (170-8890, Bio-Rad) viral genomes were quantified via TaqMan quantitative PCR amplification of ZIKV genes. ELISA analysis of plasma binding, half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were calculated using the dose-response inhibition model in GraphPad Prism. in mice challenge and protection experiments, statistical significance was analyzed by a one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test. iinsight-2-93042-s001.pdf (3MB, pdf)."}
