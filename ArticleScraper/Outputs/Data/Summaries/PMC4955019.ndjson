{"summary": "emergence of rising epidemics and infectious diseases in africa and worldwide triggered numerous public health declarations of international concern 1. there is a need for availability of data and information on human-vector-pathogen-ecosystem interfaces, drugs and vaccines development. there is a need for availability of data and information on human-vector-pathogen-ecosystem interfaces, drugs and vaccines development as well as diagnostics techniques and tools. the free open access core concept can be characterized by removal of price barriers, no subscription fees and permission barriers. limiting access to younger generations of researchers and students who cannot afford the fee to access publication in high impact placed journals, provide highly condensed information not easily informative. the strength of scaling FOA in developing countries will entail but not limited to: increasing real time and effective knowledge- or evidence-based translation of proven and validated approaches. the strength of scaling FOA in developing countries will entail but not limited to: increasing real time and effective knowledge- or evidence-based translation of proven and validated approaches. open data and information access is needed in the context of health and diseases epidemics. the current trends of globalization of trade and travel, intense urbanization, economic slowdown are coupled with rising of double epidemics burden (emerging infectious diseases and chronic diseases) there is an urgent need for open data and information access promotion, advocacy and awareness. data-driven approaches and strategies provide an immense opportunity to understand, define and generate databases that can be used for predictive primary care and innovations in the short- and long-term. the substantiation is argued by knowledge-based open data or information access platforms and proven models that are urgently needed in diverse scenarios 14, 16. researchers and policy-makers and implementers in LMICs have to spend enough time to be informed, consolidate and synthesize what types of information and knowledge can be adaptable, scalable, cost-effective and translated in intervention and best practices 14, 22, 23. without objectivity and in absence of credible context relevant platforms, we are prone to use biased and/or misplaced approaches policies particularly in the health systems improvement endeavor 14, 20, 23. authors advocate to governments, policy-makers and implementers to endorse open access public health resources platforms implementation at all levels. there is also need to develop appropriate mechanisms and strategies to promote open access capacity building and empowerment. the value of open access does not only promote health and disease literacy, but offer opportunities for mutual sharing of various educational materials. new public health paradigm and innovations in collective and participative education, timely reporting and increasing dissemination and effective trans-boundary risk communication towards democratization of heath data and information for quality health and wellbeing."}
