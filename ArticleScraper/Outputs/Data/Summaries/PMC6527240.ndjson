{"summary": "an increasing number of outbreaks of dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses have been reported in Asia and the Americas [1\u20133]. the predominant mosquito species transmitting DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV, are Aedes aegypti and Aedes Albopictus, which are widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions. the classification method is implemented in the Genome Detective software tool. it was validated by assessing the classification performance of whole-genome sequences, partial-genome sequences and products from next-generation sequencing methods. the suitability of different genomic regions for virus classification was evaluated. a multiple sequence alignment was constructed using the global-WG dataset. each alignment was edited manually until a codon-correct alignment was achieved in all genes. the next step in this exploration involved a phylogenetic analysis using PhyML and MrBayes. the initial step in the selection of reference strains involved the selection of highly divergent but equidistant whole-genome sequences that represent the diversity of each virus genotypes. the selection criteria were quality controlled for the presence of insertions, deletions, frame shifts and non-IUPAC characters using VIRULIGN [32] all windows across the genome were used for the construction of Neighbor joining trees with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. the second method involved the calculation of the phylogenetic signal present in each of the DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV genes, using the same set of reference sequences. the tree is constructed using the HKY distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation. the query sequence is assigned to a genotype if it clusters monophyletically with that genotype clade with bootstrap support >70%. if the bootstrap support is 70%, the genotype is reported to be unassigned. the viral species is determined using BLAST, classifying the sequence as DENV, CHIKV or ZIKV. only for DENV, another BLAST procedure is invoked to assign the serotype first. the web interface on this server accepts up to 2,000 whole-genome or partial genome sequences at a time. the tool can be accessed by the Genome Detective interface or by the selection of individual viruses typing tool (i.e. Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya). this dataset consists out of 4,118 DENV sequences, 653 CHIKV sequences and 413 ZIKV sequences. this dataset contains DENV sequences for each of the four known serotypes: DENV-sero1 (n = 1688), DENV-sero2 (n = 1317), DENV-sero3 (n = 897) and DENV-sero4. four main DENV clades (i.e. serotype 1 to 4) and 19 genotypes (i.e. 1I, 1II, 1III, 1IV, 1V, 2I, 2I, 2III, 2IV, 2VI, 3I, 3I, 3III, 3V, 4I, 4I, 4III and 4IV) were identified. for DENV, we used the reference sequence presented in [33] and for CHIKV we constructed a new reference sequence from NC_004162 that we added to the VIRULIGN repository. Sequences that pass the quality control were aligned using MAFFT [15], and were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using PAUP* (i.e. Neighbor Joining) and MrBayes (i.e. Bayesian). uzzle software [37] implementation of the likelihood-mapping method was used. only between-genotype quartets were evaluated. quartet puzzling essentially is a three-step procedure. a multiple sequence alignment was constructed using the global-WG dataset. each alignment was edited manually until a codon-correct alignment was achieved in all genes. the next step involved a phylogenetic analysis using PhyML and MrBayes. the initial step in the selection of reference strains involved the identification of highly divergent but equidistant whole-genome sequences that represent the diversity of each virus genotypes. for DENV, we used the reference sequence presented in [33] and for CHIKV we constructed a new reference sequence from NC_004162 that we added to the VIRULIGN repository. all windows across the genome were used for the construction of Neighbor joining trees with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. the second method involved the calculation of the phylogenetic signal present in each of the DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV genes. only between-genotype quartets were evaluated. the tree is constructed using the HKY distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation. the query sequence is assigned to a particular genotype if it clusters monophyletically with that genotype clade with bootstrap support >70%. if the bootstrap support is 70%, the genotype is reported to be unassigned. a serotype specific Neighbor joining tree is constructed to determine the Dengue genotype. the submitted sequence is a Zika virus. only for DENV, another BLAST procedure is invoked to assign the serotype first. the tool can be accessed by the Genome Detective interface or by the selection of individual viruses typing tool (i.e. Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya). the method was evaluated on a whole-genome sequence dataset (i.e. Global-WG dataset) sequences from sub-genomic regions are more commonly available than whole-genome sequences. classification pipeline presented here consists of two classification components. the first classification component enables species and sub-species assignments. a query sequence is assigned to a particular type when BLAST reports an assignment with a score that exceeds a predefined threshold. a detailed report is provided for the phylogenetic analysis that resulted into this classification. all results can be exported to a variety of file formats (XML, CSV, Excel or FASTA format) the detailed HTML report contains information on the sequence name, length, assigned virus and genotype. a BLAST cut-off value of 200 allowed accurate identification of the virus species and DENV serotypes using sequence segments >150 base pairs. the species and serotype classification procedure are implemented as separate BLAST steps. the tool can be accessed by the Genome Detective interface or by the selection of individual viruses typing tool. the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our method was calculated for both species assignment and genotyping. sensitivity was computed by the formula T P + F N, specificity by the formula T N T N + F P and accuracy by the formula T P + F P + F N + T N + T N. the boot-scanning method uses a sliding window of a 1500 base pair segment. the X-axis represents the nucleotide position in the genome. the Y-axis represents bootstrap support in percentages. only genotypes which showed less than 100% bootstrap support across the genome are shown. only ten of 4118 DENV whole-genomes could not be classified at genotype level. the seven sequences (AF298807, KF864667, EU179860, JQ922546, KF184975, KF289073, EF457905 of DENV-Sero1 were outliers in the phylogenetic tree. all the ZIKV envelope sequences were accurately classified for all three genotypes. a good phylogenetic signal was reported for the DENV and ZIKV NS5 region and the CHIKV E2 region. a classification analysis was performed for these regions as well. a boot-scanning method and likelihood-mapping method were used to verify the suitability of sub-genomic regions for genotyping. for DENV, the envelope region E1 was the only region that allowed consistent genotype assignment across the four different serotypes. NS5 had good phylogenetic signal across all four serotypes. envelope, NS1, NS2A, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 regions had good phylogenetic signal. a detailed overview of the results of the likelihood-mapping analysis can be found in the supporting information. only sequence AY496879 was found to be a clear recombinant of DENV genotype 3I and 3II. the two other sequences (DENV-Sero2 KF744408 and DENV-Sero3 JF262783) were also identified as a divergent outlier. CHIKV sequences covering the E1 region were accurately classified for all three genotypes. the genely variable E2 region may cause problems for some strains to be correctly identified as ECSA genotype. the envelope region of DENV and ZIKV and the E1 envelope region of CHIKV are suitable for genotyping purposes. this allows for a wide range of comparative analyses and validation experiments. the performance of the ArboTyping tool was evaluated on a large dataset of envelope sequences. for these envelope sequences, a classification performance close to the tool\u2019s performance on whole-genome sequences was reported. the availability of sequence products originating from other genomic regions is currently low, but it can be expected that these regions will increase in relevance given the interest in developing antiviral agents. this method accommodates the need to consistently and accurately classify DENV/CHIKV/ZIKV sequences. this is essential to implement epidemic tracing and to support outbreak surveillance efforts. bootscan results were performed using a window length of 1500 base pairs and a step size of 100 base pairs. the different colours represent the genotypes for each serotype. the results for resolved quartets and unresolved quartets are shown in the table. the partially resolved quartets represent the quartets for which conflicting phylogenetic signal or potential recombination is present. the results were compared to manual phylogenetic analysis. the new classification method consists of 2 parts: determining the species (and for DENV also the serotype) using a BLAST procedure, followed by determining the genotype using an automated phylogenetic method. the results were compared to manual phylogenetic analysis."}
