{"summary": "many viruses exhibit a marked preference for packaging their own genomes. the molecular basis for this preference is understood in only a few cases. coronaviruses selectively package positive-strand genomic RNA (gRNA) into virions. the product of the replicase gene is a huge polyprotein that is autoproteolytically processed into 16 nonstructural proteins. the PS is embedded in the coding sequence for nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), a hexameric uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (11\u201313). this new structure, a 95-nt bulged stem-loop, was strongly supported by chemical and enzymatic probing experiments. it was also found to be highly conserved among lineage A betacoronaviruses, a subgenus that includes human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), human coronavirus OC43, and related viruses within the betacoronavirus 1 species (18) the MHV-A59 wild type and all mutants were grown in mouse 17 clone 1 (17Cl1) cells. the interspecies chimeric virus designated fMHV.v2 (22) was used for mutant construction. all mutants were constructed by targeted RNA recombination. codons 313 to 314 of nsp15 from AGTGGT to TCCGGA. a 2,079-bp deletion was created downstream of the nsp16 stop codon. a 31-bp linker containing unique SalI and AscI sites was inserted in place of the deleted region. lPS-PS2 mutant (pPM20) and the PS-PS2 mutant (pPM19) were constructed by insertion of a PCR product containing bp 514 to 681 of nsp15 in place of the SalI-AscI fragment of pPM17 or pPM22 respectively. virions were resuspended in magnesium- and calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS) reverse transcription of isolated RNA was conducted with a random hexanucleotide primer and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. RT-PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA was probed with a PCR product corresponding to the 3\u2032-most 539 nucleotides of the N ORF and the entire 3\u2032 untranslated region of the MHV genome. 10-cm2 wells of 17Cl1 cells were infected with a mixture of both viruses at a constant multiplicity of 1 PFU per cell of the silPS virus and multiplicities of either 1, 0.1, or 0.01 PFU per cell of the wild type. at 12 h postinfection, when monolayers exhibited maximal syncytium formation but little detachment, released virus was harvested. feline cells were infected with fMHV.v2 which bears the ectodomain of the feline coronavirus spike (S) protein. mutants were then transfected with synthetic donor RNA containing the mutations to be incorporated. mutants were then identified through reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) mutants in the current work originated with the parent vector pPM9. the locus containing the PS is indicated by a bar above nsp15. all mutants in the current work originated with the parent vector pPM9. virions were resuspended in magnesium- and calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline. aliquot equivalent to one-sixteenth of the collected virions was incubated with 1 ml of anti-M monoclonal antibody J.1.3 for 3 h at 4\u00b0C. RT-PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis or were purified with Qiagen. RNA was probed with a PCR product corresponding to the 3\u2032-most 539 nucleotides of the N ORF and the entire 3\u2032 untranslated region of the MHV genome. pretained protein standards were included in adjacent lanes in SDS-PAGE. harvested virus (300 l of 4 ml total) was used to infect a fresh set of monolayers. the process was repeated for a total of five passages. the silPS and silPS-PS2 mutant pair were assayed in same manner. cleotides disrupted the structure of the PS without altering the encoded amino acid sequence of nsp15. resulting lowest-free-energy structure predicted by Mfold (29) for the mutated sequence is shown on the right. a region of 128 nucleotides downstream of the replicase gene was created. the deletion of the 2a and HE genes of MHV has been shown to have no effect on growth of the virus in tissue culture (30\u201332) the silPS mutant and its isogenic wild-type control virus were constructed by targeted recombination of synthetic donor RNAs with the interspecies chimeric coronavirus fMHV (22, 23) the silPS mutant never caused as extensive a cytopathic effect and detachment of the cell monolayer as did the wild type. in preliminary experiments, we prepared virions by two rounds of centrifugation in either glycerol-tartrate gradients (25) or sucrose gradients (4, 5) virus were grown, titrated by plaque assay, and immunopurified with a monoclonal antibody specific for the ectodomain of the M protein. the protein compositions of equal amounts of silPS and wild-type virions were examined by Western blots probed with monoclonal antibodies specific for the N and M proteins. blot of total RNA isolated from infected 17Cl1 cells. MHV RNA was detected with a probe specific for the 3\u2032 end of the genome. sgRNA2 was not synthesized because of the knockout of TRS2. a portion of the MHV nsp15 loop is presumed to be flexible. the loop falls on the outward-facing surface of each unit in the nsp15 hexamer. nsp15 amino acids F184 through E214 were removed and replaced with a heterologous pentapeptide sequence, NGNGN. the nsp15 amino and carboxy termini are labeled N and C. the dotted line represents part of the surface loop connecting the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of the protein. the dotted line represents part of the surface loop connecting the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of the protein. ation of the unstructured 15-nt sequence substituted for the PS in the PS mutant compared to the wild-type PS. for each mutant, two independent isolates were obtained by targeted RNA recombination and screening. the silPS mutant formed plaques at 33, 37, and 39\u00b0C that were equal in size to those of its wild-type and wild-type counterparts. the PS and PS-PS2 mutants showed that the functionality of the PS is not coupled to translation of the region in which it resides. monolayers of cells were infected with mixtures of the PS mutant and the wild type. the same primer pair was used to detect RNA from both viruses. the wild type was seen to predominate as early as the first or second passage. the wild type decisively overtook the PS mutant by the fourth passage. primers flanking the intergenic region between the replicase and the S ORFs to assay the presence or absence of the transposed PS element. the asterisk marks the position of an artifactual heteroduplex band formed by opposite strands of the 501-bp silPS-PS2 and the 341-bp silPS product. the positions and sizes of PCR primers are not to scale. the silPS-PS2 virus overtook the silPS virus by the second or third passage. the predominance of the silPS-PS2 virus was delayed only until the third or fourth passage, when the PFU input ratio was increased to 10:1. results were obtained in an independent repeat of the experiment shown in Fig. 8B. the resulting lowest-free-energy structure predicted by Mfold (29) for the mutated sequence is shown on the right. the region downstream of the replicase gene was knocked out, all of gene 2a was deleted, and all except 99 nucleotides of the HE gene was deleted. the positions of SalI and AscI sites created in the parent transcription vector pPM9 are shown. the deletion of the 2a and HE genes of MHV has been shown to have no effect on growth of the virus in tissue culture (30\u201332) the silPS mutant and its isogenic wild-type control virus were constructed by targeted recombination with the interspecies chimeric coronavirus fMHV (22, 23) the silPS mutant, despite producing widespread syncytia, never caused as extensive a cytopathic effect and detachment of the cell monolayer as did the wild type. we do not know the basis for these observations. mutant and wild-type virus were grown, titrated by plaque assay, and immunopurified with a monoclonal antibody specific for the ectodomain of the M protein. the protein compositions of equal amounts of silPS and wild-type virions were examined by Western blots probed with monoclonal antibodies specific for the N and M proteins. blot of total RNA isolated from infected 17Cl1 cells. MHV RNA was detected with a probe specific for the 3\u2032 end of the genome. sgRNA2 was not synthesized because of the knockout of TRS2. a portion of the MHV nsp15 loop is presumed to be flexible. the loop falls on the outward-facing surface of each unit in the nsp15 hexamer. in the mutant, nsp15 amino acids F184 through E214 were removed and replaced with a heterologous pentapeptide sequence, NGNGN. the nsp15 amino and carboxy termini are labeled N and C. the dotted line represents part of the surface loop connecting the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of the protein. the dotted line represents part of the surface loop connecting the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of the protein. two independent isolates of each mutant behave identically. the silPS mutant formed plaques at 33, 37, and 39\u00b0C. the virus also grew to high titers comparable to those of the wild type. the PS-PS2 mutant showed that the functionality of the PS is not coupled to translation of the region in which it resides. monolayers were stained with neutral red at 72 h postinfection. the same primer pair was used to detect RNA from both viruses. the wild type was seen to predominate as early as the first or second passage. the wild type decisively overtook the PS mutant by the fourth passage. a pair of primers flanking the intergenic region between the replicase and the S ORFs to assay the presence or absence of the transposed PS element. the asterisk marks the position of an artifactual heteroduplex band formed by opposite strands of the 501-bp silPS-PS2 and the 341-bp silPS product. the positions and sizes of PCR primers in the schematics are not to scale. the silPS-PS2 virus overtook the silPS virus by the second or third passage. the predominance of the silPS-PS2 virus was delayed only until the third or fourth passage. the same outcome was obtained in an independent repeat of the experiment shown in Fig. 8B. a second conclusion from our work is that the PS is functional if moved to a different genomic locus. the loss of packaging selectivity in the PS mutant was rescued by placement of a copy of the wild-type PS (PS2) downstream of the replicase gene. the role of the PS appears to be to tilt the balance in the competition between gRNA and stoichiometrically much more numerous sgRNAs. the role of the PS appears to be to tilt the balance in the competition between gRNA and the stoichiometrically much more numerous sgRNAs. coronaviruses have helically symmetric nucleocapsids and pleomorphic envelopes that are likely more able to accommodate additional RNA. the obvious candidate for this activity is the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is the only known protein constituent of the viral nucleocapsid. our MHV PS mutants may provide an opportunity to identify heterologous PS elements. if combined with the appropriate selective factor(s), we would like to test the prediction that some PSs encompass particular repeated loop motifs found in various alpha- and betacoronavirus genomes (20)."}
