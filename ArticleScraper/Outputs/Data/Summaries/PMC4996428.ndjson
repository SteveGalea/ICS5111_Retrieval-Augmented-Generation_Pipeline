{"summary": "RNAs within cells are coated with proteins that affect localization, stability, translation and (for viruses) replication. RNAs within cells are not naked; rather they are coated with proteins that affect localization, stability, translation and (for viruses) replication. cellular proteins were specific and distinct from those previously identified for poliovirus. DENV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. it has a 5\u2019 cap, no poly(A) tail, highly structured 5\u2019- and 3\u2019- untranslated regions (UTR) and a single open reading frame (ORF) following virus entry, the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm. several cellular proteins are known to impact DENV infection. for example, the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTBP1) is relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm following DENV infection. it enhances DENV amplification by binding to the DENV 3\u2019UTR and to NS4A, a viral protein required for the formation of the viral replication complex. qTUX-MS analysis identified 79 novel host proteins. 79 new host proteins were not previously shown to be involved in DENV infection. the majority of other identified qTUX-MS factors may also play significant roles in DENV viral amplification. SILAC labelling Huh7.5UPRT cells were passed 1:10 at least twice in SILAC DMEM (Thermo Scientific) with 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated FBS (Thermo), L-proline (200 mg/L) and penicillin-streptomycin. either 50 mg/L \u2018heavy\u2019 (13C6 L-lysine and 13C6-15N4 L-arginine; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, qTUX-MS 1\u20133 X 107 human hepatoma Huh7.5UPRT cells labelled with either \u2018light\u2019 or \u2018heavy\u2019 SILAC media were infected with DENV2 (MOI = 10) or mock-treated. virus was replaced with SILAC media with 1 mM 4-thiouracil and 10% FBS. cell pellets were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80\u00b0C. aliquot of 'light' and 'heavy' cell lysates removed and remaining lysates were incubated with the Streptavidin Magnetic beads. the beads were washed twice with wash buffer I (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM potassium chloride, 0.1% Tween-20) and once with 10 mM Tris pH 7.6. qTUX-MS, its respective mixed input lysate, and whole cell SILAC instrument raw data were separately processed using the MaxQuant software (ver. 1.5.3.8), configured with default settings. the mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [19] partner repository. cell viability and proliferation assay 24 hrs post siRNA transfection equal numbers of cells (either 2 X 103 or 8 X 103) were seeded in 96-well plates. qPCR was performed using iQ SYBR green Supermix. SILAC labelling Huh7.5UPRT cells were passed 1:10 at least twice in SILAC DMEM with 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated FBS (Thermo), L-proline (200 mg/L) and penicillin-streptomycin. either 50 mg/L \u2018heavy\u2019 (13C6 L-lysine and 13C6-15N4 L-arginine; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) or 40 mg/ qTUX-MS 1\u20133 X 107 human hepatoma Huh7.5UPRT cells labelled with either \u2018light\u2019 or \u2018heavy\u2019 SILAC media were infected with DENV2 (MOI = 10) or mock-treated, respectively. virus was replaced with SILAC media with 1 mM 4-thiouracil and 10% FBS. cell pellets were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80\u00b0C. the beads were washed twice with wash buffer I (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM potassium chloride, 0.1% Tween-20), once with wash buffer II (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) the samples were eluted at 65\u00b0C for 2 min in 20 l of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0. mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of deNV-infected cells Light (DENV2) and heavy-labelled (mock) cell pellets were lysed in 100 mM ABC containing 5% sodium deoxycholate at 95\u00b0C to ensure denaturation and virus inactivation. protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay and mixed in equal protein amounts (100 g total) siRNA transfections 2 X 106 cells were transfected with 350 pmol of Silencer Select Negative Control (Ambion) or the specified siRNAs. 24 hrs later, 4 X 105 cells/well were plated for infection. a subset of cells were seeded in 96-well plates. qPCR was performed using random primers (Invitrogen) the amplification efficiency for each primer set was 10010%. a quantitative thiouridine cross-linking mass spectrometry (qTUX-MS) method for identification of proteins associated with the DENV RNA TUX-MS can be used to identify host factors by incorporating 4-thiouridine (4sU), a zero-distance cross-linker, into the viral RNA (vRNA) cellular and viral RNA polymerases use 4sUTP as substrate during RNA synthesis. protein-protein cross-linking is very inefficient at long UV wavelengths. TUX-MS can identify bona fide interactions between host proteins and viral RNA. qTUX-MS identifies cellular proteins associated with DENV RNA. qTUX-MS identified several viral proteins as associated with vRNA. qTUX-MS identified six known DENV host factors. calreticulin (CALR), calnexin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnRNP H1 and hnRNP K, as well as a known DENV anti-viral protein. adapted method is effective at identifying host factors for DENV. novel cellular factors were identified using qTUX-MS. several of the known DENV host factors were enriched but did not meet the stringent inclusion criteria (S2 Table, S1 Dataset) the subset of 79 host factors represents a significant potential expansion in the number of known DENV host factors. the majority of candidate host factors are not altered at the protein level upon DENV infection. comparison of log2 total cell protein abundance versus relative log2 qTUX-MS enrichment for 93 proteins quantified by qTUX-MS. grey and red circles, known pro- & anti-viral factors and known vRNA-binding proteins, respectively. red and black squares, putative host factors with other annotation, respectively. other enzymes, such as UBE2N and UBE2V2, catalyze polyubiquitination at Lys-63. however, proteins in the transporter protein class were on average down regulated. the overall down-regulation of RNA binding proteins appears to be driven by changes in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial subunits. four sub-networks ( 3 proteins per network) containing 71 proteins were formed. clusters are labeled with representative transporter classes. qTUX-MS identified factors reveals a core network of RNA. qTUX-MS randomly selected six qTUX-MS identified host proteins with functions in RNA processing/translation. these factors were enhanced in the DENV sample ranging from 1.32-to 2.26-fold (DENV/mock) this will indicate if the qTUX-MS identified factors that are near the cut-off of 1.5-fold are bona fide host factors. qTUX-MS is a robust method with a low false discovery rate for high-throughput identification of viral host factors. depletion of cellular proteins identified by qTUX-MS affect DENV titer. knockdown of PTBP1, which is required for DENV replication, reduced DENV RNA levels. hnRNP F, RBMX or HMCES are required for early steps in the viral replication cycle, such as translation, replication or RNA stability. knockdown of hnRNP M and NONO did not change intracellular viral RNA levels. qTUX-MS can identify host factors that function at different stages of the virus life cycle. cells were infected with DENV 48 hours following siRNA transfections. total RNA was extracted from the cells and viral RNA levels were determined using qRT-PCR analysis. uh7.5UPRT human hepatoma cell lines stably expressing UPRT convert 4TU to UMP. the UMP is converted to thiouridine triphosphate (4sUTP) by cellular kinases. protein-protein cross-linking is very inefficient at long UV wavelengths. proteins were digested in-solution with trypsin and subjected to quantitative MS-based proteomics. median \u2018light\u2019 to \u2018heavy\u2019 peptide and protein ratios were calculated, reflecting the specificity of vRNA-protein capture. most of the qTUX-MS identified factors have not been previously identified through interactions with DENV. qTUX-MS analysis identified several viral proteins associated with vRNA. adapted method is effective at identifying host factors for DENV. cellular proteins with a DENV/Mock SILAC ratio were considered putative DENV vRNA interactions. histones are highly abundant proteins commonly detected (> 50%) in control affinity purifications compiled across diverse protein-protein interactions studies. in total, 93 cellular proteins passed these selection criteria. 79 of the known DENV host factors have not been previously shown to associate with DENV. comparison of qTUX-MS identified factors for DENV with those identified in the TUX-MS analysis on poliovirus revealed less than 10% were identified for both viruses. the enrichment ratios measured by qTUX-MS is predominantly due to their specific association with the DENV RNA. proteins in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP) were analyzed by PANTHER gene enrichment analysis. many of these enzymes are linked to ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation. however, other enzymes catalyze polyubiquitination at Lys-63. NV selectively alters the abundance of proteins, and reveals several pathways that could be directly or indirectly modulated in the host response to DENV infection. comparison of 4,907 log2 DENV/Mock host protein abundance ratios between replicate experiments (R1 and R2). ninety-three host proteins identified by qTUX-MS were analyzed by the Reactome FI Cytoscape plugin. network nodes are labeled with gene symbols and color-coded by broad functional classes RBMX, NONO, hnRNP M, hnRNP F and HMCES are required for efficient amplification of DENV. depletion of cellular proteins identified by qTUX-MS affect deNV titer. depletion of cellular proteins identified by qTUX-MS affect deNV titer. vRNA was quantified by qRT-PCR in the DENV infected cells knocked down for RBMX, NONO, hnRNP M, hnRNP F or HMCES. reduced viral amplification could be due to compromised cell fitness rather than a specific requirement of the virus for a particular host factor. knockdown of qTUX-MS host factors reduces DENV RNA levels. cells were infected with DENV 48 hours following siRNA transfections. qRT-PCR analysis identified 79 novel cellular host factors. PTBP1 and NONO were identified in both the poliovirus and DENV TUX-MS analyses. this suggests that unrelated viruses have evolved to utilize distinct host RNA binding proteins. this suggests that unrelated viruses utilize similar or diverse mechanisms to control viral RNA replication, processing and packaging within cells. partners are predominantly nuclear, bind RNA, and are involved in pre-mRNA processing, splicing, and RNA transport. many of the qTUX-MS identified cellular proteins are hnRNPs. this includes a large class of RNA binding proteins that localize to the nucleus or shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in order to perform multiple functions in RNA metabolism. knockdown of some hnRNPs (hnRNP A0 and hnRNP L) did not affect dengue viral titers significantly demonstrating that only certain hnRNPs are required for DENV amplification. some of the observed effects on virus titers derive from their roles in regulating host mRNAs. only one of the qTUX-MS identified factors was increased at the protein level in whole cells following DENV infection. the ubiquitin pathway is one of two major cellular pathways used to degrade 80 to 90% of proteins. the ubiquitin pathway is one of two major cellular pathways used to degrade 80 to 90% of proteins. qTUX-MS identifies 93 cellular proteins that bind to DENV RNA. qTUX-MS uses long wave UV light to form crosslinks to 4-thio-uridines. qTUX-MS used an MS-based SILAC approach to determine which host proteins were specifically enriched. table containing all proteins quantified by qTUX-MS. table containing all proteins quantified by qTUX-MS. table containing all proteins quantified by qTUX-MS. columns H\u2013K are cross-referenced from the respective whole cell data (B) ND = not detected. table containing all proteins quantified in whole cell lysates by SILAC. for each replicate, the following are provided. genes and relative expression ratios of host proteins quantified from Huh7.5 whole cell lysates (N = 4907) were submitted to PANTHER gene enrichment using the default settings. only the statistically significant ontology terms are displayed. the corresponding genes were analyzed by the Reactome Functional Interaction (FI) Cytoscape plug-in. four distinct sub-networks ( 3 genes per network) were assembled containing 71 out of the 209 genes. clusters were labelled with the transporter classes and/or activities represented by the majority of proteins within that cluster. post transfection cells were infected with DENV2 at MOI 0.1. virus released to the media collected 40 hours post infection. bars represent average values from triplicate, a standard error is reported."}
