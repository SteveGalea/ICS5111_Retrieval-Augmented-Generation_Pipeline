{"summary": "the bovine respiratory disease complex is a significant economic and public health burden (1) that affects young bovines worldwide. several viruses are thought to initiate and contribute to BRD, including BRSV, bovine parainfluenza type 3 virus (BPI3), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) and BVDV. both IDV and anti-IDV antibodies have been successfully detected in north and central America, Europe, Asia, and Africa (12, 14\u201321) the detection of IDV in the respiratory tract of cattle suggests that it could be a virus contributing to this major complex (23, 24) no clinical signs (clinical score [CS] 1; clinical cutoff of 1) were observed in calves in the control and aerosol sentinel groups. this calf showed signs of apathy, loss of appetite, and difficulties in walking due to arthritis in one stifle. for the five calves inoculated with IDV 5920, clinical signs started at 4.6 1.5 days. fourteen naive calves were allocated to two separate pens, one with 5 mock-infected calves and the second with 11 calves. eight calves (direct-inoculated group) were inoculated at day 0 (D0) with 107 TCID50 of IDV 5920. three direct-inoculated calves were euthanized at D8. calf 7144 showed fibrinous and necrotic pleuropneumonia with several abscesses in the cranial lobes. bacteriology indicated the presence of Trueperella pyogenes, a bacterium typically involved in secondary respiratory infection of calves. subacute bronchointerstitial pneumonia with neutrophils in bronchial lumens, neutrophilic and macrophagic alveolitis and peribronchial and septal lymphoplasmocytic infiltration. calf 6533 showed major respiratory clinical signs (CS of 6.5, starting at D4), while calf 6531 was only mildly affected (CS of 2). no microscopic lesions were observed in respiratory tissue of aerosol-sentinel calves. a peak of replication was observed at D4, with a mean titer of 5.6 108 (3.9 standard deviations [SD]) IDV genome was detected in BALs of direct-inoculated calves with titers ranging between 5.1 103 and 1.4 105 RNA copies/ml in 3, 2, and 1 out of the 5 tested calves at D2, D7, and D14. IDV antigen deposition was detected in the epithelium of the bronchioles with a nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. all tissues from the control animals were IDV negative. a new tab a Lca, left cranial lobe; Rca, right cranial lobe; Lcaud, right caudal lobe; Access, accessory lobe; NS, mediastinal lymph node; LN trach, tracheal lymph node. IDV transmission may occur by direct or aerosol transmission. IDV detection started at D3 in the direct-inoculated group area. after D9, IDV was detected only in aerosols of the aerosol-sentinel group area. comparison of consensus sequences of genes coding for the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein did not reveal nucleotide substitution. chemokine and cytokine mRNA expression in BALs between direct-inoculated and control calves, expressed as fold changea mRNA in BALs Expression on: Infected/control D2 D7 D14 D7 D14 CCL2 15.3 11.8** 2.3* STAT2 1.3 0.8 0.4 CCL3 7.8*** 1.8 1.2* SOCS1 4.8*** 1.4 2.6* CCL4 2.9* 1.5 2.8* SOCS PTGS1 2.7 2 1.8 TLR7 4.5** 1.8 1.7 PTGS2 2.7 1.2 0.8 TLR9 2.9** 2.4* 2.5* TGFB1 0.2 1.5 0.3* NOD2 1.5 2.1* 2* RPL19 0.6 1.4 0.5 IFN- 1.1 1.5 1.4 RPL26 1.4 1.1 0.9 IRF1 1.1 0.3 0.1 GAPDH 0.8 1.2 0.7 IRF3 1.8 0.7 0.1 S the highest fold changes between direct-inoculated and control calves were found mainly after infection at D2 and, to a lesser extent, D7. differences for IL-1 and IL-8 between the two groups were not significant despite high fold changes due to high variability between animals. the ITGAL gene was significantly underexpressed (P 0.01 at D14) IL-6 was significantly overexpressed at D2 (P 0.01) and D14 (P 0.01) for direct-inoculated calves. the cellular adaptive immune response was also characterized by an overexpression in the IDV group of IFN- at D2 and D14. IDV induces both humoral and cell-mediated systemic immune responses. the three colostrum-deprived, mock-inoculated controls remained seronegative for IDV hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies throughout the experiment. IDV-specific IgG1 and IgG2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were detected in all direct-inoculated animals. a slight response was observed below the LOD in sera of the remaining four calves by D10. a weak response below the LOD was observed in two direct-inoculated calves. the strongest proliferation was detected in calves 7142 and 7165 at D22. the cells were stimulated ex vivo with either heat-inactivated influenza D virus-infected or uninfected cell lysate (A) or untreated influenza D virus-infected or uninfected cell lysate (B) IL-8 induces moderate clinical signs and pathology in both the URT and LRT. no clinical signs (clinical score [CS] 1; clinical cutoff of 1) were observed in calves in the control and aerosol sentinel groups. this calf showed signs of apathy, loss of appetite, and difficulties in walking due to arthritis in one stifle, but no respiratory signs were observed. the mean ACSs (mean of the individual area under daily clinical scores) were higher for the 5 direct-inoculated animals compared to controls. one aerosol-sentinel calf showed mild clinical signs between D11 and D14. lesions were restricted to the cranial right lobe and covered about 5% to 10% of the entire lung surface for two calves. no gross lesions were found in nasal cavities or the larynx or trachea. bacteriology indicated the presence of Trueperella pyogenes. no microscopic lesions were observed in the lung parenchyma from any other lobes. the lesions were typical of cases of subacute rhinitis and subacute bronchointerstitial pneumonia. at D8 (euthanasia), calf 6533 showed major respiratory clinical signs. quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in deep nasal swabs (NS) between D0 and D22 and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (BALs) no virus was detected in control calves. no virus could be detected in direct-inoculated calves euthanized at the end of the experiment on D23. samples from other collected tissues were all negative for IDV. immunohistochemistry was performed on lung tissue sections from two direct-inoculated calves euthanized at D8. IDV was detected in nasal secretions from the three calves in the aerosol-sentinel group. for the calf starting shedding at D11 (no. 7155), IDV was detected in NS until D19. for the other two calves, IDV was still present in NS. the IDV genome was detected in air samples from the three locations at D3, D5, D7, D9, and D13 in a range of 5.2 to 6.1 log10 RNA copies/m3 of air. IDV detection started at D3 in the direct-inoculated group area and D5 in the separating space and aerosol-sentinel group area. in the interferon type I (IFN-I) response, four time points were looked at. D0 was considered as a reference before challenge, D2 corresponded to the initiation of IDV replication and innate immunity. D7 corresponded to the peak of clinical signs, and D14 corresponded to the peak of clinical signs. 1.3 PTGS1 2.7 2 1.8 TLR7 4.5** 1.8 1.7 PTGS2 2.7 1.2 0.8 TLR9 2.9** 2.4* 2.5* TGFB1 0.2 1.5 0.3* NOD2 1.5 2.1* 2* RPL19 0.6 1.4 0.5 IFN- 1.1 1.5 1.4 RPL26 1.4 1.1 0.9 IRF1 1.1 0.3 0.1 GAPDH 0.8 1.2 0.7 IRF3 1.8 0.7 the highest fold changes between direct-inoculated and control calves were found mainly after infection at D2 and, to a lesser extent, D7. the highest fold changes between direct-inoculated and control calves were found mainly after infection at D2 and, to a lesser extent, D7. all the genes were overexpressed in direct-inoculated calves except for the ITGAL gene, which was significantly underexpressed (P 0.01 at D14) no differences were observed between IDV and control groups for IL-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), TNF-, and NF-B. median fluorescence intensity (MFI) or log transformed MFI as output. compared chemokine and cytokine concentrations in BAL cells between direct-inoculated calves and controls. a linear mixed model was used with random effect for group. aerosol-sentinel calf no. 7155 that started shedding IDV at D11 developed a humoral response by D22. sera from the five direct-inoculated calves that were kept beyond D8 were additionally analyzed by IDV-specific IgG1 and IgG2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) responses induced by uninfected cell lysate were substracted from those induced by IDV-infected cell lysate. IDV-specific proliferation was significantly stronger at D22 than at D1. strongest proliferation was detected in calves 7142 and 7165 at D22. the IDV-specific CCL4 responses were significantly higher in PBMC collected on D22 than in those collected on D1 (P = 0.025) on the other hand, regardless of whether the calves from which cells were derived had previously been challenged, IDV infection of lymphocytes consequently induced IL-1 and IL-8, at statistically significantly greater levels than control antigen (P = 0.043 and P = 0.0003 for IL-1 and P = 0.005 and P = 0.0014 we cannot exclude that colostrum from IDV-seropositive cows may have stimulated the priming of the cellular immune response. the French IDV strain used in this study and the D/bovine/Mississippi/C00046N/2014 virus used by Ferguson et al. are part of the D/swine/Oklahoma/2011 lineage. despite the infection of the LRT, the clinical impact of IDV was moderate in this study. the quick recovery of the calves correlates with the limited extension of gross and histopathologic lesions observed in the three animals euthanized at D8, indicating milder pathogenicity of IDV. IDV was detected only with low frequency in the LRT of calves suffering from severe BRD. all these points suggest that IDV is a respiratory virus that can replicate in both the URT and LRT. local innate immune response induced by IDV in the LRT was also investigated. soluble form CX3CL1 is chemotactic for monocytes but not for neutrophils. membrane-bound form promotes adhesion of those leukocytes to endothelial cells. both CCL3 and CCL4 act as a chemoattractant for monocytes. IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- from fibroblasts and macrophages. we did not find IL-1 overexpression at either the mRNA or protein level in the lung. we also observed IL-6 overexpression at the transcription but not at the protein level. the first aerosol-sentinel calf began to shed virus actively at D11. this calf may have been infected between D16 and D20. we can hypothesize that the first aerosol-sentinel calf was infected by airborne droplets from the direct-inoculated group. there is a clear need for sequencing full genomes of IDV transmitted via the aerosol route. it would be more informative to use deep sequencing to be able to detect minority variants. the capacity of IDV to be airborne transmitted must also be considered. the supernatant was propagated on swine testis cells for 5 days in the presence of Opti-MEM medium supplemented with the same products and the progeny supernatant was filtered. the virus solution was verified free from other major respiratory pathogens by qPCR using the LSI VetMAX Screening pack. titrated using the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) as previously described. absence of BVDV confirmed by negative detection of NS3 antigen. 14 colostrum-deprived calves tested negative for anti-IDV antibodies using HI assay. calves were divided into two groups separated by steel panels, 3 m apart. aerosol-sentinel calves examined twice a day from 3 days before infection (D3) to D22 to D23 for body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing, decreased appetite, general state, abnormal breathing, and abnormal lung sounds. a score of 0 (normal), 1 (mild) or 2 (severe) was assigned for nasal discharge, coughing, or the general state. a pathologist described and scored the severity of microscopic lesions in slides of the lungs and respiratory lymph nodes as either light (3 or fewer small lesion foci in one section), moderate (>3 small lesion foci per section), or marked (diffuse lesions in the section). slides were retrieved in pronase antigen retrieval solution (Dako, USA; 0.05% and left for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. ining was revealed with a polymer conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and the diaminobenzidine chromogen of the HRP. a rabbit normal serum was used as a negative control. a rabbit normal serum was used as a negative control. air samples were collected using the Coriolis MICRO air sampler. the collector was placed 1 m above ground, and after every collection, the collector was thoroughly rinsed and disinfected. aliquots of 140 l were stored at 80\u00b0C for further RNA extraction and IDV genome detection by RT-qPCR. the blunt-ended PCR product of D/bovine/5920/2014 was inserted in the plasmid pSC-amp/kan of the StrataClone blunt PCR cloning kit. purified RNA was quantified by UV light absorbance (A260) using a CLARIOstar reader. individual accumulated viral shedding (AVS) in nasal secretions was calculated for each calf as the area under the curve of IDV titers. IDV strain D/bovine/France/5920/2014 was propagated on swine testis fibroblasts. cells were frozen on day 4 postinoculation and then thawed and pelleted. cell pellets were resuspended in H2O containing 0.5% Triton X (Sigma) corrected OD (COD) values were calculated by subtracting absorbance values at 450 nm of wells containing control antigen from wells containing IDV antigen. data were expressed as percentage of the COD of positive control sera. cDNAs were generated from 300 ng of clean total RNA using random hexamer primers and the Revertaid reverse transcriptase. two genes encoding IL-4 and IL-5 did not pass the validation and were ruled out. annealing at 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 20 s. lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 2 to 8\u00b0C. protease inhibitor cocktail was stored at 20\u00b0C. protein extraction on (24-h-) stimulated lymphocyte supernatants was done after cell centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove any cells or cellular debris. just before analysis, thawed samples were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. a one-way ANOVA was used to compare the treatment effects at each time point. a newman-Keuls test was used to compare the treatment effects at each time point. a t test was also run for these parameters. tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin (1 g/ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) in Opti-MEM reduced serum medium supplemented with penicillin (500 g/ml)-streptomycin (500 U/ml), ciprofloxacin (10 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, MO), amphotericin B ( in a bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1)- and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)-free experimental station of INRA, the calves were colostrum deprived (42) and transferred to PFIE between 3 and 7 days of age. the calves were fed with commercial milk and reared for 2 to 6 weeks before inoculation. the eight direct-inoculated calves were infected at day 0 (D0) with 107 TCID50 (10 ml in Opti-MEM) the control group received ST cell supernatant (10 ml in Opti-MEM) the aerosol-sentinel calves were not inoculated. a pathologist described and scored the severity of microscopic lesions in slides of the lungs and respiratory lymph nodes as either light (3 or fewer small lesion foci in one section), moderate (>3 small lesion foci per section), or marked (diffuse lesions in the section) slides were retrieved in pronase antigen retrieval solution (Dako, USA) at 0.05% and left for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. staining revealed with a polymer conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and the diaminobenzidine chromogen of the HRP. crude BAL, BAL supernatant, and cells were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. air sampling was carried out at D1, D2, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D16, and D18. the IDV genome was analyzed by an RT-qPCR targeting a 135-bp fragment of polymerase basic 1 (PB1) segment gene as previously described (12) in the lightCycler 96 real-time PCR system. the blunt-ended PCR product of D/bovine/5920/2014 was inserted in the plasmid pSC-amp/kan of the StrataClone blunt PCR cloning kit (Agilent, Santa Clar the sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) and hemadsorbed on packed horse red blood cells (RBC) four hemagglutination units of D/bovine/France/5920/2014 and 1% horse RBC were used for HI assays. the antibody response was also assessed by two ELISAs for detection of IDV IgG1 and IgG2 at D0, D10, and D22 to D23. mouse anti-bovine IgG2 antibodies (MCA626; Bio-Rad; clone K192 4F10), monoclonal rat anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies conjugated with HRP (MCA336P; Bio-Rad; clone LO-MG1-2), and (v) H2O2 were incubated for 1 h prior to three washes with 0.05% PBS-Tween solution. the strain D/bovine/France/5920/2014 propagated in swine testis fibroblasts was used for this purpose. alamarBlue reagent (Invitrogen, Sweden) was added according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. absorbance was measured by spectrophotometry at 570 nm and 595 nm. qPCR of preamplification products were then run on the BioMark qPCR. the results were calculated by threshold cycle (CT) analysis after normalization on the two most stable bovine housekeeping genes (hprt and ywha7) on a list of 6 genes previously mentioned in the literature. the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 2 to 8\u00b0C. the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. thawed samples were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. data were expressed as arithmetic means standard errors of the means (SEM) or standard deviations (SD) a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures (three-factor splitplot ANOVA) was used to analyze the clinical and qPCR results.
