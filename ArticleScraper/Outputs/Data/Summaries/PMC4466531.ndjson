{"summary": "in the us, influenza affects an estimated 5% to 20% of the population yearly [2], and is responsible for an average of 3.1 million hospitalized days, and 31.4 million outpatient visits. direct medical costs are estimated to be at least $10.4 billion annually [3] transcripts encoding proteins involved in interferon signaling and pattern recognition induced innate immunity responses. transcriptional profiling was only performed on RNA samples collected at a single timepoint of peak symptoms, or within the initial 2 to 3 days of hospitalization. the dynamic changes over the entire time course of naturally acquired infection and illness in humans are less clear. differential co-expression analysis goes beyond identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or pathways to identify differential co-expression pattern. major changes in co-expression patterns between two conditions may indicate dysfunctional regulatory systems in disease. results provide new transcriptional correlates for the evolution of ARI. there were 24 individuals with an influenza-like illness for whom no virus was identified. the subjects were predominantly European-Americans (80.5%) our tests did not detect one of the viruses sought. global gene expression profile for influenza infection in adults. 133 adults with an ARI were enrolled prospectively. became ill with influenza-like symptoms (N = 142) were seen within 48 hours of onset and 2, 4, and 6 days later for repeat evaluation, specimen collections, and medical care. 1509 of the enrolled subjects completed the study and were called back in the spring of the next year for collecting whole blood RNA, serum and nasal wash samples. changes in the host transcriptomes were observed from the first day of illness through day 6 evaluations. a total of 4,706 differentially expressed genes were identified over the course of 6 days of influenza virus illness. 2119 transcripts, corresponding to 1421 genes, were responsive to the infectious stimulus on day 0 (day 1 or 2 of illness) samples were grouped by day and subjects were grouped by infections status. the transcript order was determined by hierarchical clustering. there are three clear phases of transcriptional regulation. opeptide repeats 1 4.13 5.54E-23 4.13 8.72E-22 IFI27 interferon, alpha-inducible protein 27 3.08 5.09E-12 4.09

biosynthesis (S4A and S4B Fig, S2 Table) these individuals had gene expression profiles nearly identical to those observed in the known virus groups. the transcript levels of IFI27 and PI3 in these subjects were more similar to the non-influenza infection cases. one of these subjects had persistent elevations of these transcripts throughout the study. the changes observed in the 2009 cohort were replicated in the 2010 cohort. a significant increase in NK cell lineage activation genes (B) during the course of influenza. differentially expressed genes in the recovery phase were enriched for pathways related to gene translation and cell proliferation. the downregulated genes were significantly enriched for pathways related to gene translation and cell proliferation. a group of pathways distinct from those seen in the acute phase were enriched in DEGs in the recovery phase. stress response pathways (e.g. hypoxia signaling in the cardiovascular system and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response) were also enriched. GO functional enrichment analysis for the 26 modules detected by WGCNA on different days after influenza virus infection. transcript levels then gradually increased and became above baseline on day 4. the host translation system was attenuated in the acute phase of influenza but recovered during the later phase. reticulum part 1.4E-4 Nuclear envelope-endoplasmic reticulum network 1.1E-2 Day 4_5 38 NA Day 4_6 58 NA Day 4_7 187 Hemoglobin complex 1.1E-6 Oxygen transporter activity 1.6E-4 Oxygen transport 9.4E-4 Day 4_8 242 Response to virus 5.9E-16 Response to other organism 1.5E-12 Defense response 2.5E-7 Day 4_9 45 Caspase inhibitor activity 6.7E-3 Neg many GO terms over-represented in day 2 modules were observed on day 0. deGs on day 4 were grouped into 9 modules and these modules became more diverse in GO term enrichment. a small module Day 4_4 contains some of the top upregulated genes. the correlations between gene expression levels of all the gene pairs are higher on day 0 compared to baseline. the modules 1 in the lower left corner have significant correlation differences between day 0 and baseline. the correlation coefficient between the expression levels of OAS2 and RNASEL gene are nearly 0 at baseline. the day 0 transcript levels of 2119 DEGs were tested for their correlation with the delta antibody titers. a total of 229 genes showed evidence of significant correlation between gene expression on the first day of illness and the antibody response. of these, 168 showed evidence of positive correlation and 61 of negative correlation. 133 subjects with ARIs 1610 healthy adults were prospectively enrolled before the influenza seasons of 2009\u201310 and 2010\u201311. 133 reported for all scheduled study visits and had technically adequate gene expression data. 64 were infected with influenza A virus, 9 were infected with influenza B virus. 1 HRV + RSVB 0 1 1 1 HRV + NL63 0 1 1 1 HRV + HKU1 2 1 3 2.3 HRV + Entero 1 0 1 1 RSVA 1 0 1 1 HKU1 1 0 1 1 Unknown 17 7 24 18.0 Ethnicity/Race White 58 49 107 80.5 Indian-American 10 6 16 12.0 African-American 5 3 8 6.0 Asian 0 2 2 1.5 *Influenza A = Influenza with influenza A virus infection in the 2009 cohort were used as a discovery group. the consistency of differential expressed genes was assessed in another 21 influenza A virus infected subjects and 4 influenza B virus infected subjects in the 2010 cohort as a validation group. expression levels of monocyte markers were increased in the acute phase and returned to baseline on day 6. changes in lymphocyte and neutrophil proportions were consistent with changes described in experimental human challenges with influenza virus [34, 35] cell scores for (A) lymphocyte, (B) neutrophil and (C) monocyte were computed by taking the PC1 of normalized expression levels of the lineage-specific gene sets. one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether there are significant differences between each illness day and baseline. enterovirus, HKU1, NL63, and RSV infections were grouped together as \u201cOther\u201d virus. one-way ANOVA was used to determine whether there are significant differences between influenza virus infection groups (Grey) and each non-influenza virus group (Black) domain and RLD 5 3.86 1.48E-22 3.42 5.50E-19 EPSTI1 epithelial stromal interaction 1 3.47 1.96E-26 3.30 2.71E-24 IFIT2 interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 3.51 4.98E-21 3.19 1.11E-18 IFI44 interferon-induced protein 44 3.29 2.44E-29 3.19 2.09E-24 OAS2 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synth gene Symbol Gene Name logFC adj.P Value After deconvolution logFC adj.P Value LOC100131726 HCC-related HCC-C11_v3 -1.49 1.04E-06 -1.33 1.41E-04 RNF213 ring finger protein 213 -1.41 6.96E-06 -1.24 5.44E-04 RN28S1 RNA, 28S ribosomal 1 -1.14 1.03E-03 -1.07 6. 0.71 9.75E-04 MAP1S microtubule-associated protein 1S -0.81 1.10E-06 -0.71 1.51E-04 TSPAN5 tetraspanin 5 -0.79 7.95E-07 -0.70 1.33E-04 NECAP2 NECAP2 NECAP endocytosis associated 2 -0.74 2.70E-06 -0.69 1.67E-04 SLC25A37 solute carrier family 25, member 37 all individuals showed complete recovery to the baseline transcript profile by day 21 after onset of illness. in the acute phase, there was a very large increase in components of the interferon pathway and innate immunity. in the acute phase, there was a very large increase in components of the interferon pathway and innate immunity. -0.87 1.41E-03 -1.18 4.73E-04 RPL3 ribosomal protein L3 -1.30 9.50E-14 -1.05 4.73E-09 EIF3L eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit L -1.12 3.25E-15 -1.02 5.08E-13 RPS4X ribosomal protein S4, X-linked -1.21 5.55E-13 -1.01 1.18E-13 RPL23 5.26E-11 -0.90 1.68E-10 SGK1 serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 -1.11 1.17E-15 -0.88 9.67E-08 EIF4B eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B -1.07 8.65E-15 -0.87 4.71E-14 CMTM2 CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 2 -0.52 8.21E-05 -

GO terms enriched in acute phase modules are \u201cresponse to virus\u201d and \u201ctranslational elongation\u201d. recovery phase modules are over-represented in a new set of GO terms. the hemoglobin genes in module Day 2_5 are downregulated in response to influenza virus infection. we identified 229 genes whose transcriptional levels were correlated with the antibody response. over 1/3 of the genes identified in this study have previously been shown to be correlated with antibody response to influenza vaccination [24]. this study did not allow analysis of the subjects who had influenza infection without symptoms. antibody titers have been used to assess humoral immune responses. they do not capture the complexity of the host response to ARIs. additional studies would be necessary to establish the causal relationship between genes identified and the antibody response. enrolled persons presenting within 48 hours of onset with a new ARI with fever or that caused them to miss school, work, or social activities. a combined 8-mL nasal wash and throat swab specimen was collected at each illness visit. RNA purification was performed using the PAXgene Blood RNA system (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA purification was performed using the PAXgene RNA stabilization tubes (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, U.S.A.) cRNA samples were eluted once using 40 uL nuclease-free water. Spectrophotometry and microfluidic electrophoresis were performed to QC samples before hybridization onto Illumina Human HT-12v4 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) differential gene expression analyses with cell composition covariates were performed using function for linear model fitting in the limma R package. the significance of differences in gene expression was tested using a Bayes moderated t-test [46]. cDNA was synthesized from approximately 2 ug of total RNA in a 20-ul reaction volume using the High Capacity RNA to cDNA kit. RT-PCR was performed on 1ul of cDNA in triplicates with the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) the WGCNA method constructs networks or modules consisting of groups of genes that are highly correlated across a set of samples. a dendrogram (cluster tree) of the network is then obtained from hierarchical clustering. modules are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. the study was conducted at Texas A&M University, College Station, TX. the protocol and informed consent were approved by the Baylor College of Medicine and institutional review boards before the study began. the study was repeated 2010\u20132011 with surveillance for influenza limited to January to April. all subjects were asked to return for specimen collection and to provide a medical and ARI history. RNA purification was performed using the PAXgene Blood RNA system (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. quality control of RNA samples was performed using spectrophotometry and microfluidic electrophoresis. cRNA was hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12v4 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the initial standard quality control thresholds were imposed on the raw intensity signals of the microarray using the iScan Control Software (Illumina, San Diego, CA) cDNA was used to generate antisense RNA copies (cRNA) of each mRNA. cRNA samples were eluted once using 40 uL nuclease-free water. spectrophotometry and microfluidic electrophoresis performed to QC samples. all differential expression analyses were restricted to 17,708 transcript probes in the microarray. detection p-value cut-off was imposed on the normalized intensities to consider a transcript as detected. the significance of differences in gene expression was tested using a Bayes moderated t-test. quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on baseline and Day 0 paired RNA samples from 18 randomly selected subjects with influenza infection only and 11 subjects with rhinovirus infection only. cDNA was synthesized from approximately 2 ug of total RNA in a 20-ul reaction volume using the High Capacity RNA to cDNA kit. IPA uses a right-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test to derive P values for identifying significantly overrepresented pathways. a smaller P value indicates the overrepresentation of a pathway or a GO term by the DEGs is less likely due to random chance. differential co-expression analysis was performed for each day, contrasted to baseline. a total of 4,706 differentially expressed genes were identified over the course of 6 days after influenza virus infection. fold change of the acute phase genes and recovery phase genes were computed in each individual comparing each illness day and baseline. each dot represents the average |log2 FC| of all the acute phase genes or recovery phase genes in a subject after infection. transcripts that were responsive to rhinovirus infection but had no change in influenza virus infection. CDKN1A, CDKN1B and CDKN1C are among the DEGs detected when comparing influenza virus and rhinovirus infection. the upper diagonal of the main matrix shows a correlation between pairs of genes among samples collected from HRV-infected individuals on the first day of illness. the lower diagonal of the main matrix shows a correlation between the same gene pairs in these individuals on baseline. red color corresponds to positive correlations, and blue corresponds to negative correlations. genes showed evidence of correlation between gene expression on day 0 and the magnitude of antibody response.
