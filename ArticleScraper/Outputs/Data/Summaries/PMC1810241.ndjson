{"summary": "Background Respiratory infection with the neurovirulent vaccinia virus (WR) strain Western Reserve (WR) results in an acute infection of the lung followed by dissemination of the virus to other organs and causes lethality in mice. WR strain replicated more vigorously in the lung and in the brain than the less virulent Wyeth strain. some poxviruses are causative agents of human diseases. variola virus caused a deadly human disease smallpox until its global eradication in 1977. other poxviruses are molluscum contagiosum virus and monkeypox virus. the WR strain replicated and produced higher titers of virus in the lung and the brain compared to the Wyeth strain. there was no difference between the virus titers in brains of mice infected with the high or low dose of WR strain. adult female C57BL6/J mice were inoculated with various doses of the WR and Wyeth strains. weight change and survival of infected mice were recorded daily. most of mice died at 7\u201310 days post-infection. we compared virus replication in the lung and the brain. it had been reported that after intranasal inoculation, virus was recovered from various organs in mice. but higher titers of the virus were detected in the lung and the trachea. the data of titers in lungs at 18 days post-infection was under detection level. the virus titers in the brain showed the same kinetics for the lethal infection with WR strain (106 p.f.u.) and the non-lethal infection with WR strain (104 p.f.u.) it reached maximum at 5 days post-infection, and the virus was not eliminated at 18 days post-infection. othelial cells (MLECs) were infected, only the WR strain grew. the cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 1, and similar results were obtained. WR strain replicated more efficiently in lung cells and lung endothelial cells. cells were infected with WR or Wyeth strains at m.o.i. 1 and observed after 2 days post-infection. WR strain induced typical CPE and the Wyeth strain formed syncytia similar to CV-1 cells. there were no differences in the percentages of the CD3+ population (31\u201337%) of lymphocytes among the uninfected controls and lethally or non-lethally infected mice. lethal-infection with WR strain increased the proportion of CD3int up to 13.6% compared to 3.49% of the uninfected control group. the percentages of CD3 intermediate (int) and CD3 high (high) subsets are shown in each diagram. the percentage of NK (NK+CD3-) lymphocytes in the lung declined (9.17%) in lethal infection at 5 days post-infection. thymocytes decreased dramatically by 3 days post-infection compared to uninfected mice. non-lethal infection with WR reduced the size of the thymus to some extent. proportion of CD4+CD8+ DP cells was not different at 5 days post-infection. data are shown as the average number of thymocytes per mouse. the dotted line is the average number of thymocytes from uninfected mice. the error bars indicate the standard deviation in triplicate samples. 104 p.f.u. and 103 p.f.u. of WR strain caused mild weight loss. mice recovered their weight after 6\u20138 days post-infection. the 50% lethal dose of WR strain was calculated as 4.2 104 p.f.u. virus titer in the lung increased at 1 day post-infection, reached maximum at 3 days post-infection, started to decline 7 days post-infection. virus titer in the lung also reached the maximum at 3 days post-infection, but the titer was much lower, and virus was cleared earlier. mice infected with the Wyeth strain reached maximum at 5 days post-infection. virus titer in the brain also reached maximum at 5 days post-infection. but the titer was much lower, and the virus was cleared at 10 days post-infection. a new tab Virus replications in primary mouse lung and kidney cells and MLEC after infection with WR and Wyeth strains at an m.o.i. of 0.01 and 1. cells were infected with WR or Wyeth strains at m.o.i. 1. the WR strain did not alter the morphology of primary mouse lung cells. the WR strain induced typical CPE and the Wyeth strain formed syncytia similar to CV-1 cells. these observations suggest there may be differences in the replication and dissemination in mouse lungs in vivo at an early phase of infection. CD4 expression in the CD3int cells was higher than in the CD3high cells. a proportion of CD3int CD4high CD8- lymphocytes markedly increased in lethal-infection with the WR strain (23.5%) compared to uninfected controls (4%) at 5 days post-infection. the percentage of NK (NK+CD3-) lymphocytes in the lung declined (9.17%) in lethal infection at 5 days post-infection compared to the uninfected control (14%) non-lethal infection increased the proportion of NK cells (25.6% and 27.3%) the proportion of CD4+CD8+ DP cells was not different at 5 days post-infection (73.2%) but dropped to 26% at 10 days post-infection. infection with the Wyeth strain did not change the size of the thymus (Fig. 7A) or the number of thymocytes by 5 days post-infection. thymocyets from mice infected with WR and Wyeth strains at 5 (upper five panels) and 10 (lower two panels) days post-infection. virus titers in the thymi in non-lethal infection were mostly below detection levels. cells in the lung and with an altered phenotype of T cells compared to uninfected controls and non-lethal infections. we used isoflurane to anesthetize mice before intranasal inoculation for consistent administration of the inoculum into the airway. it is known to inhibit interferon stimulation of NK cells in mice. es such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) in which virus titers in the lung peak at 4\u20135 days post-infection. other respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS viruses, rapidly replicate in the lung. host immune responses are more important factors in disease pathogenesis. there has been no description of thymus atrophy in mice induced by respiratory infection with VV. thymus atrophy was mainly due to a reduction of immature CD4+CD8+ DP. cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, may also contribute to thymus atrophy in some infections. virus was under the detection limit in the thymi of mice infected with a non-lethal dose of WR when the thymocyte number was at nadir at day 10 post-infection. further investigation is required to uncover mechanisms of thymus atrophy induced by respiratory infection with VV. the Wyeth strain is not cloned and is genetically heterogeneous. the lethality caused by intranasal infection with a high dose of the WR strain of VV is caused by increased replication of the virus in lung cells and lymphocyte depletion in the lungs. cell line, EA.hy926, was maintained in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS. MLECs were isolated and grown as previously reported. porcine intestinal mucosa (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 100 g/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (BD Biosciences) cells were confirmed to express the endothelial specific markers, PECAM (CD31), ICAM-2 (CD102) and VE-cadherin (CD144) by flow cytometric analysis. the monolayers were inoculated with VV for 2 hours at indicated multiplicity of infection. cells were harvested at different time points after infection and kept at -80\u00b0C until use. titers were determined by plaque forming assay using CV-1 cells. cells stained with antibodies directed at surface phenotypic markers. cells were analyzed by FACSAria (BD Biosciences) leukocytes were recognized by characteristic size (forward scatter, FSC), granularity (side scatter, SSC) and CD45 expression. Isolation of mouse primary lung and kidney cells Primary mouse lung and kidney cells were isolated from female C57BL/6J mice. each organ was digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) for 45 min. each organ was digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase A (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then intranasaly inoculated with various doses (103 to 106 p.f.u.) of the WR or Wyeth strains, or uninfected CV-1 cell lysate (for control mice) in a total volume of 50 l. all mice were maintained in the Animal Facility at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. iters were determined by plaque forming assay using CV-1 cells and titers were calculated as p.f.u./well. recovery of leukocytes from lungs, thymi and spleens Lung leukocytes isolated from VV-infected mice and uninfected control mice at indicated time points. the stained cells were analyzed by FACSAria (BD Biosciences) leukocytes were recognized by characteristic size (forward scatter, FSC), granularity (side scatter, SSC) and CD45 expression."}
