{"summary": "animal models have been constrained by the inability to monitor viral replication dynamics in real time. cohorts of animals are infected and euthanized, and viral load or immune responses are measured in predetermined tissues. inherent animal-to-animal variability introduces significant confounding effects. Luc is an engineered luciferase originally derived from the deep sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris. nanoLuc is optimized to use furimazine as a substrate, which was also engineered as a coelenterazine analogue. luciferases can be classified by their substrates: firefly (fLuc) and other beetle luciferases oxidize D-luciferin. Renilla luciferase (rLuc), Gaussia luciferase (gLuc) and NanoLuc (NLuc) oxidize coelenterazine or its analogues. in vivo BLI of viral infections requires the production of recombinant viruses encoding fLuc is most commonly used, given the relative ease of imaging (long-lived signal due to glow-type kinetics), low cost, and favorable emission properties. substrate is administered via intraperitoneal route, with peak bioluminescence occurring 10\u201320 min after injection and persisting with 20% of the signal remaining at 60 min. noninvasive BLI yields real-time temporospatial data that can be tracked over time in the same animal. this is exemplified in studies with vaccinia virus expressing fLuc. luciferases were instrumental in developing viruses when fLuc was not suitable. the whole-body imaging that is routinely used can identify unexpected sites of replication that would have been missed with targeted approaches. in vivo BLI is a powerful technique, but has several limitations that must be considered to acquire reproducible and representative data. reporter viruses can be optimized to some degree by the choice of luciferase. fLuc, rLuc, and gLuc require intravenous injection of the substrate. animal position must also be optimized to account for coat color, skin pigment, the depth of the emitting site. the same strategy can be applied to studying secondary bacterial infections using bacteria expressing the lux operon. bioluminescent bacteria paired with reporter viruses could establish the interplay between virus and bacteria. transgenic reporter mice have been developed that express fLuc in response to immune stimulation. split luciferin precursors can be modified with functional groups that block ligation and thus must be \u201cuncaged\u201d before luciferin reconstitution. this approach might be suitable to study virally induced apoptosis, in which a viral enzyme uncages one precursor and activated caspases uncage the other precursor."}
