{"summary": "the virus may contaminate live canine vaccines based on cultured feline cells. the in vivo infectivity, acute and subacute pathogenicity, and viral proliferation of the RD114 virus were evaluated by experimental infection of dogs. infectious RD114 virus was present in certain live attenuated canine vaccines. the amount of infectious RD114 virus found in manufactured live canine vaccines was as high as 1,800 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/vial. RD114 virus can be regarded as an 'exogenous' retrovirus in non-feline species including dogs. the dogs were inoculated subcutaneously in the neck with either 1 ml of RD114 stock virus (group A), inactivated RD114 virus suspension (group B) or cell culture medium (group C) as a negative control. the dogs were euthanized 51 days post inoculation and autopsied. aminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, amylase, lipase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglyceride, sodium, potassium, chlorine, calcium, inorganic phosphorous, glucose and total bile acid levels. polymerase chain reaction Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA stabilized whole blood, axi the principle of the assay is based on the detection of infectious RD114 virus using TE671 cells transduced with the LacZ marker gene [TE671(LacZ) cells]. RD114 virus was prepared from the culture supernatant of TE671 cells chronically infected with the virus. the axillary lymph nodes, spleen and sternal bone marrow were macroscopically examined. blood samples from each group were collected 5 days before inoculation. the biochemical analyses included total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, the single step PCR assay was performed on genomic DNA extracted from TE671(LacZ) cells infected with ten-fold serially diluted (100 to 10-10) stock virus. the limit of detection was 10-5 and 10-6 for the env and pol genes, respectively. the lacZ pseudotype virus positive cells were detected 17, 2 and 0 cells for 10-4, 10-5 and 10-6 diluted points. RD114 virus was not detected from TE671(LacZ) cells co-cultured with buffy coat cells. this finding was confirmed by PCR assays using genomic DNA from the co-cultured cells as a template. RD114 provirus was not detected in genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen and sternal bone marrow. in clinical cases caused by retroviruses, blood specimens are mainly used for virus detection. however, we were unable to detect RD114 provirus from blood, lymph node, spleen and sternal bone marrow samples using a one-step PCR assay. these results suggest that RD114 did not proliferate and disseminate in the dogs, or that RD114 virus did not proliferate efficiently in the blood cells and hematopoietic the dogs were free from infections with canine adenovirus (CAdV-2), canine coronavirus, canine distempervirus, canine parainfluenzavirus, canine parvovirus, leptospira and rabies virus. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
