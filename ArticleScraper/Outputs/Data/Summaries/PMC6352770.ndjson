{"summary": "global health security agenda was revived only after 2014/2015 Ebola virus outbreak in west africa. despite these constructive developments, most countries faced significant challenges to implement IHR recommendations once the \u2018sense of crisis\u2019 passed. APSED III acknowledges that regional health security requires functional and well-integrated health systems to detect and respond to EIDs. a joint Asia-Pacific strategy for public health emergencies provides a model for other WHO regions. the australian government committed AUD $300 million over 5 years to create a new Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security. global funding could provide valuable support for failing health systems. but careful coordination is required to ensure local ownership, alignment with local health priorities and consideration of locally sustainable solutions. international donor support should align with local priorities and strengthen health systems in general Discourage programme-specific investment that does not build sustainable local capacity Emergency infrastructure are expensive to maintain and often underused Disaster risk reduction and preparedness infrastructure should be designed for continuous use and training Develop models where high-level containment facilities can be scaled up or down. the process provides an aggregate national assessment, but does not consider subnational areas of vulnerability. careful subnational risk assessment would complement JEE assessment. the construction of high containment facilities that meet strict quality standards requires huge financial investment. there should be scope to consider the relevance of specific hazards in a particular setting. smaller countries, like the Pacific island nations, are often unable to meet IHR preparedness criteria across all hazards."}
