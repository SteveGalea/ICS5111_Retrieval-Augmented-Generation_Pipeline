{"summary": "ARIs cause great morbidity and mortality in children across the globe. concomitant viral and bacterial infection, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, can lead to the development of acute otitis media (Ruohola et al., 2013) we have previously reported the use of nCounter technology to identify viral and bacterial agents in nasopharyngeal aspirates. in the present study we determined microbial (viral and bacterial) loads and performed immune transcriptional profiling in NPAs of those children with ARI. collection of Nasopharyngeal aspirates and RNA Extraction Nasopharyngeal aspirates was collected from each subject. the distance between the entrance of the nostril and the ear lobe was used as an estimate of the distance between the entrance of the nostril to the nasopharynx. influenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, and 3, RV, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), Chlamydia pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae (Fukutani et al., 2015). the RNA was also hybridized against immune targets using the immunology custom set V21. standardized protocol allows identification of multiple pathogens in NPA samples of ARI patients in a single reaction. pathogen transcript counts were log10 transformed. each individual\u2019s microbial load was determined by comparing the number of transcripts to that of the individual\u2019s cutoff value. genes (Log2 values of the 600 genes analyzed) using the Reactome database. correlation strength was assessed by non-parametric bootstrap. only those with value over 50% were considered. a genome-wide cross-species comparison of type I IFN-induced antiviral response and tallied the number of species (0\u201310) with significant (FDR 0.05) antiviral activity for each individual gene. the study complied with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. an aseptic catheter was inserted into the nostril and negative pressure was applied to collect approximately 2 mL of nasal secretion. samples were placed in sterile tubes containing 1 mL of NucliSENS Lysis Buffer (bioMerieux) and frozen at -70\u00b0C until use. all the probes were synthesized by nanoString Technologies\u00ae and nCounter (NanoString\u00ae) reactions performed at the Nucleomics Core Facility (VIB, Leuven, Belgium), as previously described. the nCounter probe set used in this study was extensively tested and optimized for semihigh throughput analysis. pathogen transcript counts were log10 transformed. each individual\u2019s microbial load was determined by comparing the number of transcripts to that of the individual\u2019s cutoff value. the NPAs with microbial counts above their respective cutoffs were considered pathogen-positive. non-parametric bootstrap (100 replicates) was performed to identify nodes that are more densely interconnected (Supplementary Dataset 3). the DEITs significantly correlated with microbial load, and those present in >50% in bootstrap resampling were considered as a community. of 58 randomized NPA samples, 53 (91.4%) showed microbial transcript counts above the calculated cutoffs and were considered positive. these NPAs were further classified as \u201cbacterial\u201d (n = 27, 46.6%), \u201cviral\u201d (n = 5, 8.6%), or \u201ccodetection\u201d (presenting both bacterial and viral transcripts) nasopharyngeal aspirates (n = 53) were subjected to transcriptomics analysis using probes targeting adenovirus (AV 2 and 5), bocavirus (BoV), coronavirus (CoV 229E and OC43), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1, 2, and 3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSVA and B), influenza virus (IV A and B), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and rhino the mean age of patients with ARI was 11.7 months [(34/53 (58%) females] the most frequent complaints were coryza (87.9%), cough (86.2%), and sneezing (84.4%). Upon physical examination, the most frequent findings were fever (82.7%) and wheezing (37.9%). talgia 6 (10.4%) Cyanosis 2 (3.4%) Diarrhea 2 (3.4%) Frequency is shown as median values (min\u2013max range) or number (percent). microbial load at the nasopharyngeal interface of children with ARI was determined by comparing NPAs of children with ARI with those of healthy controls. 156 DEITs formed a module/community that was directly correlated with bacterial load. the remaining 32 genes formed a separate module/community. codetection NPAs presented the highest number of upregulated genes. but the community/module that correlated with microbial presence contained only five genes. the DEITs with bootstrap values >50% were subjected to modularity analysis. numbers within the orange or green circles represent genes with similar modularity. numbers within gray circles represent genes with different modularities. in situ transcriptomics revealed three communities/modules. a subset of NPAs was classified as \u201cindeterminate\u201d since microbial transcript counts were below the established cutoff. we hypothesized that the gene expression profile detected by nCounter could distinguish microbial presence, independent of clinical symptoms. the number of DEITs in bacterial, viral, and codetection NPAs was lower in comparison with indeterminate NPAs and in the comparison with healthy controls. adaptive immunity transcripts appeared to discriminate viral, bacterial, and codetection NPAs. adaptive immunity transcripts appeared to discriminate viral, bacterial, and codetection NPAs. bacterial NPAs display an in situ immune signature that is specific and also different from that observed in indeterminate NPAs. the correlation between DEITs and microbial load in NPAs classified as bacterial and codetection was correlated with Partial Least Square (PLS) scores obtained for the modular communities of differentially expressed genes depicted in A (orange box). bacterial NPAs display an in situ immune signature that is specific and also different from that observed in indeterminate NPA we identified immune genes that were specifically expressed in children with symptomatic ARI harboring bacterial or viral transcripts at the nasopharyngeal interface (Figure 7). at the intersection of these two modules, we established a subset of eight immune genes that are expressed in both the conditions, regardless of the type of microbial presence or the presence of clinical symptoms. the intersection shows immune genes common to both categories. five bacterial NPAs (8.6%) were classified as \u201cindeterminate\u201d because their microbial transcript counts were below the calculated cutoff. transcripts for S. pneumoniae (8/58 NPAs, 13.8%) and M. catarrhalis (2/58 NPAs, 3.4%) were also detected in viral NPAs. nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) (n = 53) subjected to transcriptomics analysis using probes targeting adenovirus (AV 2 and 5), bocavirus (BoV), coronavirus (CoV 229E and OC43), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1, 2, and 3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSVA and B), influenza virus (IV A and B), human metapneumovirus (hMP we did not observe significant differences in verbal complaints or any findings following physical examination of children harboring NPAs classified as bacterial, viral, or codetection. ARI symptoms could not be associated with specific respiratory pathogens, nor with pathogen classes (viral vs. bacterial) deITs were determined by comparing NPAs of children with ARI with those of healthy controls. 208 genes were upregulated in viral NPAs. codetection NPAs showed the highest number of upregulated immune genes (n = 449) the remaining 32 genes formed a separate module/community. among the 208 DEITs detected in viral NPAs, the module/community correlated with viral load consisted of 29 genes. in situ transcriptomics revealed three communities/modules: the first module consisted of 157 (156 depicted in the module plus C4BPA) immune genes. a second modular community consisted of 29 (28 genes depicted in the module plus CXCL11) genes (Figure 3B), whose expression was directly correlated with viral counts (RSV, PIV, AV, etc.) the last community consisted of five genes, whose expression was correlated with both bacterial and viral transcripts (codetection NPAs) the modules/communities of immune genes identified previously were correlated with the microbial load. we hypothesized that the gene expression profile detected by nCounter could distinguish microbial presence, independent of clinical symptoms. we thus applied the same analysis pipeline (Supplementary Figure 2) to identify whether the immune signatures in bacterial, viral, and codetection NPAs were distinct from those present in indeterminate NPAs. notably, the number of DEITs in bacterial (n = 33, Figure 5A), viral (n = 17, Figure 5B), or codetection monocyte-(BTK, CSF1R, CSF2RB, ENTPD1, ICAM2, IFI35, IKZF1, IRF5, and ITGA) were significantly enriched among bacterial DEITs. IFNL3 was expressed in codetection and in viral NPAs (Figure 5D), in agreement with its unique protective role against respiratory viruses. bacterial NPAs display an in situ immune signature that is specific and also different from that observed in indeterminate NPAs. the correlations between DEITs and microbial load in NPAs classified as bacterial (orange) or viral (green) were determined by Spearman (p 0.05) and correlation strength was assessed by non-parametric bootstrap. numbers within the orange or green circles represent genes with similar modularity. nasopharyngeal aspirates characterized immune response at the nasopharyngeal interface, in symptomatic children with ARI. the majority of samples harbored either strictly bacterial (47%) or a composition of both bacterial and viral transcripts (codetection) the most common transcripts were those for RSV A and B, and PIV3. SV is one of the most common etiological agents of respiratory infection, including pneumonia. haemophilus influenzae is a component of the healthy upper respiratory tract microbiota. a potential disturbance in the microenvironment can lead to invasion, dissemination, and complications. nCounter has proven highly sensitive for the detection of retroviral transcripts in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines. nCounter has proven highly sensitive for the detection of (retro)viral transcripts in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines. type II interferon (gamma) is produced by lymphocytes and NK cells. it is associated with inflammatory responses. the interferon-signaling pathway is the most upregulated pathway in blood transcriptomic analysis. two (CXCL11 and CXCL10) are interferon-regulated chemokines. bind to the same CXCR3 receptor and preferentially attract activated T- and NK- cells. recent evidence points toward non-redundant roles for three IFN-induced CXCR3 ligands in vivo. total viral load decreased from 990 to 24 normalized counts (almost forty-fold) in cured patients after 2-4 weeks of follow-up. this result was not statistically significant (p = 0.30), due to low numbers and a high coefficient of variation. on the other hand, bacterial loads remained equally high in both cured (post-ARI) samples and samples from ARI during the acute phase. comparisons were made against NPAs from healthy individuals, IFNL3 was not observed. this suggests that IFNL3 represents a marker of ARI. type III IFN induces a variety of ISGs that interfere with viral replication. MARCO is a scavenger receptor expressed in tissue-resident macrophages. CSFR1 and CSF2RB are the receptors for the major monocyte/macrophage growth factors M-CSF and GM-CSF. monocytes/macrophages may provide a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity in the nasal mucosa during ARI. IFNL3/IL28B suggests a pivotal role for type III IFN in maintaining tissue homeostasis during ARI. study was sufficiently powered to reveal distinct immune signatures linked to specific viral vs. bacterial pathogens in symptomatic children. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.
