{"summary": "innate immune response is mediated through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (1\u20133). cytoplasmic sensor of viral RNA is RIG-I, which recognizes both the 5\u2032-di/triphosphate end and the double-stranded region of viral RNA. MV vaccines were developed by adaptation in chick embryos and chick embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) the robust production of defective interfering (DI) RNA from vaccine strains is also thought to be critical to this difference between wild-type and vaccine strains (10, 11, 18, 19) copy-back DI RNA of MV potently induces type I IFNs. it exhibits adjuvant activity in mice immunized with an influenza vaccine. exactly how copy-back DI RNA activates RIG-I remains incompletely understood. HEK293-p125 and HEK293-PACT were transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies) cells were transfected with 0.25 g/ml of DI RNA. cDNA fragments for DI RNA and the DI RNA loop (ADAR1) were cloned into the HindIII and NheI sites of the in vitro transcription vector p2RZ. MV Edmonston strain VR-24 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. titer used to calculate multiplicity of infection determined by plaque assay. cDNA synthesis was achieved with a PrimeScript reverse transcription master mix kit. cDNA of copy-back DI RNA was cloned by RT-PCR using a single primer. the sequence of the primer amplified the longest copy-back DI RNA was 5\u2032-ACCAGACAAA GCTGGGAATA GAAA-3\u2032. pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter (Promega) was used as an internal control to normalize for transfection efficiency. standard deviations (SDs) were calculated on the basis of the results of three independent experiments. intermediate-length poly(IC) with an average size of 0.2 to 1 kb, also known as low-molecular-weight poly(IC), was purchased from InvivoGen. the cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 0.25 M. cells were harvested using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS) vero cells stably expressing the measles virus receptor, human signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (hSLAM) were a kind gift from Wenbo Xu (China CDC, Beijing, China) and were maintained in 400 g/ml of G418. RIG-I/, MDA5/, and PACT/ MEFs have previously been described (30\u201332) mouse anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-tubulin antibodies were bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit anti-PACT antibodies were bought from Abcam. MV vaccine strain Hu-191, also known as Shanghai-191 (34), was kindly provided by Wenbo Xu. cDNA of copy-back DI RNA was cloned by RT-PCR using a single primer. sequence of primer that amplified the longest copy-back DI RNA was 5\u2032-ACCAGACAAA GCTGGGAATA GAAA-3\u2032. RNA folding analysis was performed with RNAfold software. the amounts of IFN- in the culture media were determined using the manufacturer's protocol. the range of the detection limit was 1.2 to 150 pg/ml. Luciferase reporter assay. RNA immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously (36, 39) cells were cross-linked by incubation with formaldehyde (from a stock of 37% HCHO and 10% methanol) to a final concentration of 1% (vol/vol, 0.36 M) at room temperature for 10 min with gentle mixing. many vaccine strains of MV potently activate the production of type I IFNs. many vaccine strains of MV potently activate the production of type I IFNs. this contributes to the subsequent induction of protective immunity (10, 11) SLAM-expressing A549 cells were infected with either the Hu-191 (191) or Edmonston (Ed) strain of MV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 for 18 h. the levels of IFN- mRNA (A) and protein (B), CCL5 mRNA (C) and CXCL10 mRNA (D) were statistically significant. we focused on viral RNA, particularly DI RNA of the copy-back type. this is compatible with the notion that copy-back DI RNA might be RIG-I and MDA5 agonists. this is compatible with the notion that copy-back DI RNA might be RIG-I and MDA5 agonists. DI RNA is predicted to form a 206-bp double-stranded stem region and an 823-nucleotide (nt) loop region. GC content of this DI RNA was 40.8%. in vitro-transcribed DI RNA was tested with HEK293 cells stably expressing p125-Luc driven by the IFN- promoter. luciferase activity recovered showed that DI RNA alone was sufficient to activate the IFN- promoter potently as early as 8 h after transfection. this suggested that this DI RNA might be a major factor contributing to the ability of Hu-191 to induce IFN- production. SLAM-expressing A549 cells were transfected with either a DI RNA-targeting siRNA (siDI) or an irrelevant siRNA against GFP (siGFP) for 48 h. cells were then infected with the Hu-191 virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 for 16 h. and MDA5 on the induction of IFN- production by this DI RNA, RIG-I and MDA5 were overexpressed in HEK293 cells. after 24 h, MV DI RNA was further transfected. after 48 h, in vitro-transcribed MV DI RNA was further transfected. the difference between the samples whose results are shown as bars 3 and 6 was statistically significant. we previously demonstrated that the double-stranded RNA-binding protein PACT is required for optimal activation of RIG-I by intermediate-length poly(IC) with an average size of 0.2 to 1 kb but not by short 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA (8). a loss-of-function study is required to fully establish the importance of RIG-I and PACT in the recognition of MV DI RNA. two independent siRNAs against PACT were designed and their effectiveness in achieving a high degree of knockdown was verified by Western blotting. in vitro-transcribed MV DI RNA was transfected 48 h after siRNA transfection. the levels of the IFN- transcript relative to those of GAPDH mRNA were normalized to readouts of the mock-transfected control. error bars denote SDs from three independent experiments. the requirement for RIG-I, MDA5 and PACT in DI RNA-induced activation of IFN- expression was then compared. the ability of MV DI RNA and intermediate-length poly(IC) to activate the expression of the IFN- transcript in the different genotypes was then compared. the presence of both DI RNA and PACT in the anti-FLAG precipitate indicated the association of the two entities. this association was specific, since it was not seen in the absence of PACT (Fig. 6A, lane 2) and PACT was not bound to the L gene of Hu-191. SLAM-expressing A549 cells were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of 0.5. cells were treated with formaldehyde and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated. the input lysate (5%) was also probed for PACT and -tubulin. both 5\u2032-di/triphosphates and the stem region in MV DI RNA are important for IFN induction. in vitro-transcribed RNA samples were loaded into a formaldehyde agarose gel. poly(IC) (IC), DI RNA, DI-CIP, and DI-lp were transfected. induction of IFNs and cytokines by MV vaccine strain. many vaccine strains of MV potently activate the production of type I IFNs. this contributes to subsequent induction of protective immunity (10, 11) neither the Hu-191 nor the Edmonston virus dramatically induced IFN- mRNA (Fig. 1E) the expression of type II IFN was not significantly activated by MV in these cells in our experimental setting. however, our results demonstrate that Hu-191 is indeed a potent inducer of IFN- and cytokines. 4.8 105 (highlighted by ***) and 0.0012 (highlighted by **) respectively. we focused on viral RNA, particularly DI RNA of the copy-back type. a recent analysis of RIG-I- and MDA5-associated RNA from MV-infected cells indicated an exclusive enrichment of RNA from the 5\u2032 end trailer region of the viral genome. copy-back DI RNA predicted to form 206-bp stem region. loop region of 823 nucleotides could also be highly structured.

DISCUSSION In this study, we identified and characterized an IFN-inducing DI RNA of the copy-back type from MV vaccine strain Hu-191. with 50 nucleotide substitutions, the Hu-191 virus is more divergent from the Edmonston strain than most other vaccine strains (41) it has not previously been documented whether the Hu-191 virus produces DI RNA like other vaccine strains. our results suggest that the Hu-191 vaccine strain of MV is a potent activator of type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes. other vaccine strains of MV and their DI RNAs have been shown to induce type I and III IFNs in dendritic cells (11) we demonstrated the requirement for PACT and RIG-I in the innate sensing of copy-back DI RNA of MV using gene-knockout MEFs. we demonstrated the requirement for PACT and RIG-I in the innate sensing of copy-back DI RNA of MV using gene-knockout. both 5\u2032-di/triphosphates and a double-stranded region are agonists of PACT and RIG-I. in MV-infected cells, DI RNA is encapsidated, and the nucleocapsid protein is thought to contact 6 nucleotides. the total number of nucleotides in DI RNA should be a multiple of six (51) phenotype but showed similar developmental defects (31, 56, 57) loss of PACT was found by another group to have no effect on cytokine induction and viral infection. it was not known whether the induction of STAT1 and IFIT1 had plateaued in that study. ADAR1 inhibits IFN induction, protein kinase R activation, stress granule formation, and MV replication. it will be of interest to clarify whether ADAR1 might also affect DI RNA recognition by PACT and RIG-I. copy-back DI RNAs in MV vaccines serve as built-in adjuvants to provoke innate immunity. MV vaccines have been extensively tested as immunotherapeutic agents for cancer and other diseases."}
