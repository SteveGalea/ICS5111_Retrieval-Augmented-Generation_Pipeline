{"summary": "bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization of pediatric patients. this condition causes acute inflammation, edema, necrosis of epithelial cells, increased mucus production, and inadequate oxygenation of tissues. in high-income countries, the number of hospitalizations for severe bronchiolitis has tripled between 1980 and 1996. these risk factors can be categorized as environmental, maternal, and host factors. environmental exposure of children or their mothers to allergens, cigarette smoke, overcrowded living conditions can contribute to the severity of bronchiolitis. a retrospective, case-controlled study included all children 2 years or younger who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe bronchiolitis. all these children with severe bronchiolitis-diagnosed were hospitalized in ward from September 2012 to January 2015. in addition, clinical information about healthy age-matched children received care for healthy children control. the civil hospital of Guadalajara is a tertiary-level hospital that provides medical care to people from rural towns and urban cities of western Mexico. the emergency department has 2 consultation offices for triage evaluation, 6 beds for ambulatory fluid resuscitation, and 23 beds for pediatric hospitalization (8 for newborns and 15 for pediatric patients). demographic data were investigated: age, sex, date of birth, gestational age, birth weight, birth length, previous hospitalizations, history hepatitis B vaccines at birth and hepatitis B vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. pentavalent acellular pertussis, rotavirus, and pneumococcus vaccines at 6 and 7 months of age. vaccinations, daycare, 28 or malnutrition were analyzed. RT-PCR was carried out in 2 different ready-to-use amplification tubes. the amplified products were labeled with biotin. they were hybridized with their respective probes that were immobilized. hybridization occurred in a low-density microarray containing triplicate DNA probes that are specific to the respiratory virus studied. all these products were visualized by using CAR automatic reader (Genomica S.A.U.) all these children with severe bronchiolitis-diagnosed were hospitalized in ward. in addition, clinical information about healthy age-matched children was used. informed consent was obtained from the children's parents at the time of clinical evaluation. demographic data were investigated: age, sex, date of birth, gestational age, birth weight, birth length, previous hospitalizations, history of previous respiratory disease, and birthplace. all mothers were interviewed to determine their children's exposure to potential or known risk factors for severe bronchiolitis. deficiency of weight/age, index weight/age, height/age, weight/height were obtained from the children. nutrition indexes were analyzed; family health history: asthma, allergies, atopy, and rhinitis in family members. RT-PCR was carried out in 2 different ready-to-use amplification tubes. the amplified products were labeled with biotin. a specific 120- to 330-base pair fragment of the viral genomes was amplified. 134 cases of severe bronchiolitis confirmed in pediatric patients 2 years or younger were treated in the pediatric emergency department. the patient group was predominantly male (60.5%, 81/134), but the control group was not. 153 respiratory viruses were identified in nasopharyngeal samples from the 134 children with severe bronchiolitis. 153 respiratory viruses were identified in the nasopharyngeal samples from the 134 pediatric patients with severe bronchiolitis. the protective factors we found in the children with severe bronchiolitis were adequate prenatal care, maternal history of taking prenatal calcium, and having a complete vaccination profile for the patient's age. the mean age of children with severe bronchiolitis was 6.6 5.7 months (range, 1\u201324 months), which did not differ from that of the control group. coinfections with 2 respiratory viruses were found in 19/134 cases. each case included RSV type A or B virus, followed by rhinovirus and PIV type 3. cigarette smoking was an independent risk factor associated with severe bronchiolitis (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.99\u20136.18; P =.0001). having a complete vaccination profile for the patient's age was the only protective factor identified (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35\u20130.87; P =.010) exposure to cigarette smoking was the only independent risk factor associated with severe bronchiolitis treated in the emergency department at our hospital. this result suggests that exposure to cigarette smoking decreases pulmonary function in children 2 years or younger. this result suggests that exposure to cigarette smoking decreases pulmonary function in children 2 years or younger. studies in similar populations are required to analyze these associations. risk factors such as exposure to cigarette smoking during pregnancy were not associated with severe bronchiolitis. this could be a secondary effect of campaigns against smoking during pregnancy. a study in low-income populations should be done to more thoroughly investigate these protective associations. this protective association does not explain the decreased incidence of severe bronchiolitis among vaccinated children."}
