{"summary": "autophagy is a constitutive, dynamic, bulk degradation process. long-lived proteins and organelles are engulfed by specialized double membrane vesicles. the constant flow of autophagosomes to lysosomes is tightly regulated by a number of autophagy-related genes (atg) p62/SQSTM1-mediated, pathogen-specific autophagy thus represents an innate immune defense mechanism. autophagy can be enhanced above basal levels by various stimuli, such as amino acid starvation. the mammalian TOR (mTOR) regulates cell growth. autophagy has no effect on the replication of other viruses. in human rhinovirus, coronavirus, and SINV infections, viral replication is independent of ATG5. despite lack of a role for autophagy in controlling virus replication, autophagy promotes survival of infected cells. -zoster virus activate autophagy through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (5, 39) thapsigargin, a pharmacologic inducer of ER stress, is reported to cause accumulation of autophagosomes. coronavirus-induced autophagy is not due to mTOR inactivation or ER stress. accumulation of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells did not depend on mTOR inactivation or eIF2 phosphorylation. accumulation of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells was due to inhibition of autophagosome maturation and was dependent on the expression of the viral glycoproteins. SFV-Gal, SFV-6K, and SFV-Spike were derived from the plasmids pSP6-SFV-lacZ (25), pSP6-SFV-6K (26), and pSP6-SFV-C[am]-CWF (40), respectively. influenza A virus strain X31 was propagated in chicken eggs and titrated on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. d, mouse anti-LC3 (MBL International), mouse and rabbit anti-p62/SQSTM1 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) coverslips were then incubated in PBS containing secondary antibodies and 1 g/ml Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) for 1 h for identification of cell nuclei. images were processed and compiled using Adobe Photoshop. cells were harvested with trypsin, washed with PBS, and washed with PBS containing 0.05% saponin. cells were then rinsed with PBS, incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) for 20 min. atg5+/+ and atg5/ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) for inhibition of lysosomal degradation, cells were incubated in 15 mM ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) cells grown on coverslips were fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation in ice-cold methanol for 10 min. antibodies used were mouse anti-SFV nsP1, mouse anti-SFV nsP2 (23), rabbit anti-total SFV, mouse anti-SFV capsid, mouse anti-LC3 (MBL International), and mouse and rabbit anti-p antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-SFV nsP2 (23), rabbit anti-nsP3, rabbit anti-S6 ribosomal protein, rabbit anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein, rabbit anti-phospho-4E-BP1 and rabbit anti-actin (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-eIF2 and goat anti-actin (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-LC3 (Abgent) cells were then incubated with antibodies for intra more than 30,000 events were captured for every analysis. data analysis was carried out using a flow cytometer (FlowJo) SFV, mock infected, or CQ treated, and processed for FACS analysis. a saponin-resistant EGFP\u2013LC3-II\u2013positive population emerged. the EGFP-LC3 reporter accumulated in the EGFP\u2013LC3-II form, preferentially in SFV-infected cells compared to noninfected cells. infected cells were identified by their positive nsP1 staining. lysates were obtained 4, 8, or 12 hpi and analyzed for SFV nsP2, actin. SFV-infected EGFP-LC3 cells harvested at 4, 8, and 12 h postinfection (hpi) or CQ treated for 12 h and analyzed by immunoblotting for viral protein nsP2 and the cellular proteins actin and LC3. we also observed endogenous LC3-II accumulation in infected cells and in MEFs infected with SFV for more than 8 h. a number of RNA viruses have been shown to utilize autophagosomes as sources of membranes upon which they assemble RNA production complexes. we infected atg5/ and atg5+/+ MEFs with SFV at an MOI of 10. the intensity of nsP3 staining was not significantly affected by the ablation of the gene for ATG5. LC3-I and LC3-II can be distinguished by their apparent molecular masses of 18 kDa and 16 kDa respectively. we infected atg5/ and atg5+/+ MEFs at an MOI of 0.5 or 10 with SFV and measured the production of virus in cell culture supernatants. in many cases, foci of nsP1-positive staining did not colocalize with EGFP-LC3. morphologies of the observed foci were different, suggesting juxtaposition rather than true colocalization. this was a rare occurrence in cells heavily stained for both proteins. SFV-infected HOS cells were fixed at 4, 8, and 12 hpi and stained for SFV nsP1 or nsP3 and p62/SQSTM1. the extent of this was less than for LC3-II. low and moderate levels of colocalization of p62/SQSTM1 with SFV nsP2 staining were observed. at 12 hpi, cells were stained for nsP1 (C) or nsP3 (D) and p62/SQSTM1 (green) colocalization was analyzed by confocal microscopy. SFV structural proteins do not colocalize with autophagosomes. or spike proteins with EGFP-LC3, endogenous LC3 or p62/SQSTM1 in infected cells. to this end, we infected HOS-EGFP-LC3 cells with SFV for 1 h before addition of NH4Cl or CQ for 7 h before fixing and staining the cells for viral capsid protein. even with lysosomal degradation inhibited, we did not detect any colocalization of SF phosphorylation states of S6 ribosomal protein and 4E-BP1 phosphorylated by mTOR kinase. but when mTOR is inactivated, both proteins become dephosphorylated. rapamycin treatment also led to rapid dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 protein. phosphorylated at serines 240 and 244 and 4E-BP1 remained as a slower-migrating band. this result suggested that the accumulation of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells is not due to induction of autophagy via inactivation of mTOR. the number of EGFP-LC3-positive puncta per cell was quantified by manual counting. lysates from mock- or SFV-infected eIF2-SS and eIF2-AA cells were harvested 10 hpi and the phosphorylation state of the protein was analyzed by immunoblotting. eIF2 was phosphorylated after SFV infection of the eIF2-SS cells but not the eIF2-AA cells. system characterized by flux of autophagosomes from initial formation to incorporation of cargo through trafficking to lysosomes and subsequent degradation of the associated cargo. we analyzed the effect of SFV infection on the fluorescence of the tandem marker monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)\u2013EGFP-LC3. HOS-EGFP-LC3 cells were mock infected, starved or SFV infected for 4, 8, or 12 h, and treated at 1 h postinfection with NH4Cl for 3, 7, or 11 h. cells were then washed briefly in 0.05% saponin in PBS, stained for nsP1 and analyzed by flow cytometry. autophagosome accumulation in SFV-infected cells was not enhanced by NH4Cl treatment. in cells starved of amino acids and serum for 8 h, the number of autophagosomes was only slightly increased relative to mock-treated cells. this is due to the lysosomal degradation rate which increases in tandem with the rate of autophagosome formation in starved cells. SFV-induced accumulation of autophagosomes was largely due to a deficiency in autophagosome degradation rather than induction of autophagy. we infected HOS-EGFP-LC3 cells with IAV X31 and determined levels of autophagosome-associated EGFP-LC3 accumulation at different times postinfection. wt SFV infection induced strong accumulation of EGFP\u2013LC3-II. infection of cells with SFV-Gal did not induce LC3 accumulation except in a very small number of cells. expression of viral structural proteins itself is responsible for inhibition of autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. t SFV or SFV-Gal were mock infected or infected with wt SFV or SFV-Gal at an MOI of 10 for 4, 8, or 12 h or treated with 50 M CQ for 12 h. cells were then washed briefly in 0.05% saponin in PBS, stained for nsP1 to confirm infection. wt SFV and SFV-6K induced accumulation of EGFP\u2013LC3-II. despite high levels of infection, neither SFV-Spike-infected nor SFV-Gal-infected cells accumulated detectable levels of EGFP\u2013LC3-II during the infection. the number of EGFP-LC3-positive puncta per cell was quantified by manual counting. the number of EGFP-LC3-positive puncta per cell was shown to increase steadily during the time course of infection. flow cytometry can be used to measure total fluorescence of saponin-extracted HOS-EGFP-LC3 cells as a measure of the level of autophagosome-associated EGFP\u2013LC3-II. HOS-EGFP-LC3 cells were infected with SFV at an MOI of 1 or treated with 50 M CQ. at 4, 8, or 12 hpi, cells were stained for SFV nsP1 (red) and analyzed for EGFP-LC3-positive puncta. lysates were obtained 4, 8, or 12 hpi and analyzed for SFV nsP2, actin, or LC3. at 12 hpi, cells were stained for SFV antigen (red), endogenous LC3 (green), and nuclei (blue) and analyzed by confocal microscopy. LC3-II-containing autophagosomes accumulated in the cytoplasm of SFV-infected cells. accumulation of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells has been reported in a number of diverse virus infections (8). atg5+/+ or atg5/ MEFs were infected with SFV at an MOI of 10. cells were stained for SFV nsP3 (red), LC3 (green), and nuclei (blue) at 8 or 12 hpi, cells were stained for SFV nsP3 (red), LC3 (green), and nuclei (blue) LC3 remained in the LC3-I form in atg5/ MEFs upon CQ treatment. in atg5+/+ MEFs it accumulated in the LC3-II form. SFV nonstructural proteins colocalize with autophagosomes to a low degree. SFV-infected HOS cells were fixed at 4, 8, and 12 hpi and stained for SFV nsP3 and p62/SQSTM1. the distribution of endogenous LC3 was similar to that of EGFP-LC3 in SFV-infected cells. low to moderate levels of colocalization of nsP3 with LC3 were observed. SFV replicase proteins rarely colocalize with autophagosomes in infected cells. at 12 hpi, cells were stained for nsP1 (red) and LC3 (green) colocalization was analyzed by confocal microscopy. SFV capsid protein staining was observed in a diffuse pattern in all infected cells and was not enriched in the infection-induced EGFP-LC3 puncta. p62/SQSTM1 was found in a diffuse staining pattern and did not specifically colocalize with p62/SQSTM1. however, we did not detect any colocalization of SFV capsid with EGFP-LC3 in infected cells. SFV-infected cells were infected with SFV at an MOI of 20. at 12 hpi, cells were stained for SFV capsid (red) or SFV capsid (red) and p62/SQSTM1 (green) (b) both S6 and 4E-BP1 were rapidly dephosphorylated at the sites analyzed. a reduction in the total levels of S6 was observed after 12 h of starvation. rapamycin treatment also led to rapid dephosphorylation of S6 at serines 240 and 244. phosphorylation occurs rapidly upon infection of cells with SFV (28) eIF2-AA localized into cytoplasmic puncta in SFV-infected eIF2-AA cells. the number of EGFP-LC3-positive puncta per cell was quantified by manual counting. eIF2-SS or eIF2-AA MEFs were infected at an MOI of 10 with SFV for 10 h. at 10 hpi, cells were fixed and stained for LC3 or nsP3. infection was confirmed by positive nsP3 staining. in mock-infected cells, puncta were observed that were both mRFP and EGFP positive, as well as puncta that were only mRFP positive. in SFV-infected cells, we could also detect a small number of mRFP-positive puncta that resemble those in mock-infected cells. cells were mock infected or infected with IAV X31 for 24 or 32 h. then washed briefly in 0.05% saponin in PBS, stained for nsP1. shown are representative histograms from four independent experiments. flow cytometry analyzed the kinetics of EGFP\u2013LC3-II accumulation in SFV-infected cells. SFV-induced accumulation of EGFP\u2013LC3-II fluorescence was evident in the absence of NH4Cl and was not appreciably increased by its presence. SFV-infected cells maintained a strong saponin-resistant EGFP-LC3 signal. the increase in levels of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells is a result of their inefficient lysosomal degradation. a recombinant SFV expression system can be constructed which lack the structural protein-coding region. HOS-EGFP-LC3 cells were mock infected or infected with wt SFV or SFV-Gal at an MOI of 10 for 4, 8, or 12 h or treated with 50 M CQ for 12 h. lysates were analyzed for SFV nsP2 and eIF2 and actin. similar levels of nsP2 and phosphorylated eIF2 were observed in cells infected with either virus. wt SFV, SFV-6K, SFV-Spike and SFV-Gal were used to infect HOS-EGFP-LC3 cells. despite high levels of infection, neither SFV-Spike-infected nor SFV-Gal-infected cells accumulated detectable levels of EGFP\u2013LC3-II during the infection. expression of the SFV glycoprotein complex is necessary for the accumulation of autophagosomes in SFV-infected cells. we found that although LC3-positive autophagosomes accumulate in the cytoplasm of SFV-infected cells, blocking this pathway did not affect viral replication. lysosomal degradation rates increase concomitantly when autophagy is induced. inhibition of autophagosome maturation leads to significantly higher levels of cytoplasmic autophagosomes than induction. in some viral infections, the mechanism of autophagosome accumulation has been well described, but for others it has not. colocalization of viral nsPs with LC3 suggests that autophagosomes are in some cases used as structures for SFV RNA replication complex assembly. colocalization of viral nsPs with LC3 suggests that autophagosomes are in some cases used as structures for SFV RNA replication complex assembly. nsPs expressed at equal levels by wt SFV and SFV-Gal are not involved in this phenomenon. the times when the greatest levels of LC3-II accumulation occurred were very late in infection, 8 h and later. wt SFV-infected cells showed very modest alternative splicing of X-box-binding protien 1 (Xbp-1) mRNA at times of greatest accumulation of LC3-II. thapsigargin treatment led to strong signal for spliced Xbp-1 but very weak induction of autophagosome assembly in HOS-EGFP-LC3 cells. autophagy is blocked late in infection by certain viruses to allow the infected cells to go into apoptosis. studies of the regulation of autophagy during viral infections will lead to a more complete understanding of this aspect of the host-pathogen relationship."}
