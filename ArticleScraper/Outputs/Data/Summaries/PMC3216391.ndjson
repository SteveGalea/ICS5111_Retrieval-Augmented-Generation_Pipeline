{"summary": "biochemistry and cell biology of ACE2: Comparisons and Distinctions from ACE inhibitors have served to place ACE2 and its biologically active product, angiotensin II (Ang II) as central regulators of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE2 did not convert Ang I to Ang II nor was it inhibited by ACE inhibitors. ACE2 does hydrolyse the decapeptide Ang I, albeit relatively poorly, but converts it to Ang-(1-9) rather than Ang-(1-8) studies revealed that ACE2 preferentially cleaves terminal amino acids from peptides ending in Pro-X, where X is a hydrophobic amino acid. angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin in the circulation to generate Ang I. this reaction is much less favourable than the production of Ang-(1-7) from Ang II. Ang-(1-9) is then cleaved by either NEP or ACE2 to yield Ang-(1-7) a single amino acid substitution in ACE2 sterically hinders the entrance of the penultimate substrate amino acid into the active site, thereby eliminating the ACE-like peptidyl-dipeptidase activity. only under conditions of elevated Ang I concentrations is the conversion of Ang-(1-9) by ACE2. this does not rule out any potential application of ACE2 inhibitors. ACE2 is a type 1 transmembrane protein (N-terminus outside, C-terminus intracellular) localised on endothelial cells where its catalytic site is exposed to circulating vasoactive peptides. activity of ACE2 can therefore be modulated via its expression on the cell surface, through its expression levels and also through its cleavage from the cell membrane. success of ACE inhibitors has shown that Ang II is a key mediator of hyper Ang II acts through the AT1R to desensitise the baroreflex, stimulate water uptake, and increase vasopressin release and sympathetic activation, ultimately leading to increased blood pressure [27]. overexpression of ACE2 in the brain attenuates hypertension, via an increase in nitric oxide production [19] and improved baroreflex [20]. ACE2 was immediately proposed as a cardioprotective protein. the discrepancies between the initial study and the phenotypes were initially proposed to be due to differing genetic backgrounds in their models. subsequent studies using the original ACE2-deficient mice described by Crackower et al. also showed no overt cardiac changes, suggesting that the phenotype is lost over time [35, 36] conversion of Ang II to Ang-(1-7) by ACE2 is not the only physiological route to Ang-(1-7) production. ACE2 and ACE2 can convert Ang-(1-9) to Ang-(1-7) the actions of Ang-(1-7) extend beyond vasopressor control. reduction in myocyte diameter and ventricular weight of mice virally expressing Ang-(1-7) was associated with a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-6) compared to control. ACE2 levels have consistently been shown to alter in cardiovascular disease states. ACE2 expression was identified as a candidate gene underlying the loci linked to hypertension [31]. ACE2 expression decreased significantly when hypertension was initiated in salt-sensitive rats compared to Wistar-Kyoto [53] ACE2 expression decreased significantly when hypertension was initiated in hypertensive rats. ACE2-knockout mice have been shown to have increased susceptibility to glomerulosclerosis, coupled with increased collagen and fibronectin deposition. ACE2 deletion disrupted the benefits of ACE inhibition on diabetic nephropathy. ACE2 expression is elevated in the islets of type 2 diabetic rats. ACE2-null mice have significantly increased fasting blood glucose compared to wild-type littermates. no direct role for ACE2 in the pancreas has yet been identified. collectrin was identified as an unknown protein upregulated in a model of partial nephrectomy. its function remains elusive for four years until crystals of tyrosine and phenylalanine were detected in the urine of collectrin-null mice. this suggests that collectrin may act as a molecular chaperone for B0AT1 in the kidney, implicating ACE2 in similar role. ACE2 acts as the host cell receptor for SARS-CoV. Binding to ACE2 stimulates clathrin-dependent endocytosis. ACE2 levels are lower in both kidney and heart compared to normotensive volunteers. Ang II mediates a decrease in ACE2 in hepatic stellate cells. hypoxia-induced HIF-1 increases ACE expression. ang-(1-7) also mediates a decrease in ACE2. oestradiol (E2) treatment was protective against Ang II-induced fibroblast proliferation. no significant change in blood pressure was seen and no protective mechanism proposed. a high-fat diet has been shown to increase ACE2 mRNA levels in adipose tissue. peptide mimics around likely cleavage site region hydrolysed by recombinant ADAM 17 at an Arg-Ser bond. mutation of these critical cleavage residues in a cell-based system failed to inhibit shedding suggesting that the specificity of ADAM 17 is topographically determined, rather than sequence dependent. in human hypertensive patients, ACE2 levels are lower in both kidney and heart compared to normotensive volunteers. a growing body of in vitro evidence suggests that this decrease is mediated at least in part by Ang II. however, the role Ang II plays in regulating ACE2 is not yet fully elucidated. administration of aldosterone or endothelin-1 to rat myocytes has also been shown to downregulate ACE2 mRNA levels. no effect on blood pressure was demonstrated and no mechanism of action was proposed. oestrogen treatment was protective against Ang II-induced fibroblast proliferation. an increase in ACE2 activity has been reported in adipose tissue. the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid have been investigated. the effects of all-trans-retinoic acid have been investigated. calmodulin binding increases the cellular release of ACE2. ACE2 has been associated with increased myocardial dysfunction. ectodomain shedding of ACE2 appears to play no role in internalisation. a number of studies have been carried out examining the effect of recombinant human ACE2 on a range of disease conditions. infusion of ACE2 does not appear to have any effect on nondisease states or on the basal level of Ang II in wild-type mice or ACE2-knockout mice. exogenous ACE has been shown to have transcriptional effects independent of its catalytic activity when VSMC and endothelial cells are treated with ACE. the fate of these ectodomains is unknown and it may be a mechanism of rapid clearance, or perhaps these ectodomains are endocytosed and trafficked to the nucleus, where they elicit transcriptional changes. the only disease model recombinant ACE2 has shown success in is type 1 diabetes. recombinant ACE2 reverses the effects of exogenous Ang II infusion. however, it is hard to judge the clinical relevance of this treatment."}
