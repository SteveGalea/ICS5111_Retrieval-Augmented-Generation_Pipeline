{"summary": "the most serious complication of KD is the occurrence of coronary artery lesions (CALs) in developed countries, KD is the leading cause of acquired heart diseases in children. etiology of KD is still under investigation. soluble form of CD40L (sCD40L) is derived from activated platelets. it contributes to pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. sCD40L may play a pathogenic role in triggering acute coronary syndromes. CAL was defined by the internal diameter of the coronary artery being at least 3 mm (or 4 mm if the subject was over the age of 5 years) or the internal diameter of a segment being at least 1.5 times of an adjacent segment in the echocardiogram. DNA Extraction Blood cells were subjected to DNA extraction by treating them first with 0.5% SDS lysis buffer and then protease K (1 mg/mL) for digestion of nuclear protein for 4 h at 60\u00b0C. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in a 96-well microplate with the ABI 9700 Thermal Cycler. after PCR, fluorescence was detected by ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system. data was analyzed using the System SDS software (version 1.2.3) DNA extraction was performed by using the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. tagging SNPs in the CD40 gene with a minor allele frequency of >10% in the Han Chinese population were selected from the HapMap database. CAL was observed in 9.7% (37/381) of KD patients 8 weeks after disease onset. 12.9% (49/381) of the KD patients were resistant to initial IVIG treatment. polymorphism rs1535045 in the CD40 was found to have significant influence with regards to the susceptibility of KD. 37 patients among the 381 KD patients developed CAL. TT genotype of rs4810485 has protective effects for CAL formation in patients with or without coronary artery lesion (CAL) formation. rs4810485/rs1535045 case (%) (n = 381) control (%) (n = 569) OR (95% CI) P Value G/T 258 (34.0) 343 (30.7) 1.22 (0.98\u20131.52) 0.0767 G/C 216 (28.5) 317 (28.3) 1.10 (0.88\u20131.39) 0.3937 T/C 282 (37.2) 457 (40.8) Reference Haplotype frequency less than 1% was excluded. 1.7 1.6 5.7 4.9 Age range (years) 0\u201311 0\u201351 CAL formation 37 (9.7%) IVIG resistance 49 (12.9%) CAL: coronary artery lesions; IVIG: intravenous immunoglobulin. TT genotype of rs4810485 has protective effects for CAL formation in patients with or without coronary artery lesion (CAL) formation. no significant association was found between CD40 haplotype analysis and the susceptibility of KD. rs4810485/rs1535045 CAL (%) (n = 37) without (%) (n = 336) OR (95% CI) P value G/T 23 (31.1) 231 (34.5) 1.00 (0.55\u20131.81) 0.9991 G/C 26 (35.1) 186 (27.8) 1.40 (0.79\u20132.51) 0.2511 T/C 25 (33.8) 251 (37.5) Reference Haplotype frequency less than 1% was excluded. in this study, we found that CD40 genetic polymorphism (rs1535045) is associated with susceptibility of KD. rs1535045 in CD40 gene has been confirmed to be associated with the coronary artery calcification in diabetic families. further study into the mechanisms between CD40-CD40L interaction and the risk of KD may provide a better understanding for the pathogenesis of KD."}
