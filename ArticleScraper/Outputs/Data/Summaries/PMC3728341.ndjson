{"summary": "EV71 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornavirudae family. a significant increase of EV71 epidemics has been observed in the Asian-Pacific region since 1997. in the 1998 EV71 outbreak in Taiwan, over 100 000 young children were infected. edema, but no pulmonary edema (PE) and cardiac failure in cynomolgus monkeys. mouse-adapted EV71-infected newborn suckling mice dose not mimic human infection. innate immunity, particularly type I IFN, involved for EV71-induced pathogenic challenge was reported. hSCARB2-transgenic mouse model could be suitable for evaluating protective efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71-specific neutralizing antibody, N3 [17]. hSCARB2-transgenic mouse model could be suitable for evaluating the protective efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71-specific neutralizing antibody, N3 [17]. both E59 and 5746 were pre-incubated (m.o.i. = 0.5) with various amounts of N3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before adding them to 3T3-SCARB2 cells. RNA was extracted 2 h after infection and subjected to RT-PCR to detect the expression of viral genome P1. administration of N3 to E59-preinfected mice reduced skin lesions to a relatively mild degree from Day 4 post infection onwards. pre-challenge of 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice with a lethal dose of 1105 pfu 5746 caused progressive limb paralysis from Day 4 onwards. 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice were preinfected with a lethal dose of EV71 5746 virus at 1105 pfu. after 3 h of infection, 200 g of N3 or isotype antibody was injected i.p. Mice without any antibody treatment were included. both groups of mice receiving late (48 h) treatment of N3 were died on 9 d after infection. in condition, approximately 60% of the mice receiving N3 24 h post infection were survived. early administration of 200 g N3 might provide 100% protection against 5746 infection. the muscle fibers were damaged in the non-treated mice and mice received isotype antibody. the muscle fibers were not accumulated in the tissues from the mice treated with N3, compared to the section of normal muscle tissue (MOCK) hSCARB2-transgenic mice were challenged with 1105 pfu of 5746. 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice were challenged with 1105 pfu of 5746. infected mice received 200 g N3 or isotype antibodies at 3 h post infection. administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) suppresses cytokine production has been used to treat severe cases [13]\u2013[15], [20] administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) which suppresses cytokine production has been used to treat severe cases. the number of PCR cycles (Ct) required for fluorescent detection of target genes was calculated. each normalized 2Ct value was the ratio to the value from the mean of 2Ct obtained from the antibody-untreated tissues. similar scenarios were seen in the secretion of type I and type II interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brainstem, spinal cord, and muscle. relative expression of target gene normalized with internal control of -actin expression from the same tissue was calculated as described in Fig. 7. RNA was extracted from the brain, spinal cord, and muscles of 5746-infected hSCARB2-transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody. administration of N3 did not protect hSCARB2-transgenic Mice from Coxsackie Virus A16 infection. anti-CVA16 antisera, obtained from mice immunized twice with live CVA16, equally detected all EV71 virus and CVA16 particles. EV71-specific Monoclonal Antibody N3 Cross-neutralizes E59 and 5746 Viruses. both E59 and 5746 were pre-incubated with various amounts of N3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before adding them to 3T3-SCARB2 cells. RNA was extracted 2 h after infection, and subjected to RT-PCR to detect the expression of viral genome P1. administration of N3 to E59-preinfected mice reduced the skin lesions to a relatively mild degree from Day 4 post infection onwards. pre-challenge of 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice with a lethal dose of 1105 pfu 5746 caused progressive limb paralysis from Day 4 onwards. 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice were preinfected with a lethal dose of EV71 5746 virus at 1105 pfu. after 3 h of infection, 200 g of N3 or isotype antibody was injected i.p. Mice without any antibody treatment were included. both groups of mice receiving late (48 h) treatment of N3 were died on 9 d after infection. in condition, approximately 60% of the mice receiving N3 24 h post infection were survived. early administration of 200 g N3 might provide 100% protection against 5746 infection, this dose was chosen for following pathological studies. in immunochemistry staining with anti-EV71 antibody, viral particles did not accumulated in the brainstem and muscles of mice treated with N3. muscle fibers were damaged in the non-treated mice and mice received isotype antibody but were not observed in the tissues from the mice received N3. a magnification of x200 for (A) and x100 for (B) and (C) was made. hSCARB2-transgenic mice were preinfected with EV71 5746. RNAs were extracted from the brainstem, spinal cord, muscle, skin, and intestine. administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) which suppresses cytokine production has been used to treat severe cases [13]\u2013[15], [20] administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) which suppresses cytokine production has been used to treat severe cases. quantitative RT-PCR specific to (A) CXCL10, (B) CCL3 and (C) IL-6. each normalized 2Ct value was the ratio to the value from the mean of 2Ct obtained from the antibody-untreated tissues. similar scenarios were seen in the secretion of type I and type II interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brainstem, spinal cord, and muscle. relative expression of target gene normalized with internal control of -actin expression from the same tissue was calculated as described in Fig. 7. RNA was extracted from brain, spinal cord, and muscles of 5746-infected hSCARB2-transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody. administration of N3 did not protect hSCARB2-transgenic Mice from Coxsackie Virus A16 infection. ELISA (for nave protein interaction; Fig. S3) and Western blot (for denatured protein interaction; Fig. S4) showed lower affinity to nave CVA16. anti-CVA16 antisera obtained from mice immunized twice with live CVA16 equally detected all EV71 virus and CVA16 particles. hSCARB2-transgenic mice infected by either genotypes B or C of EV71 viruses were protected from developing HFMD-like and paralytic symptoms. hSCARB2-transgenic mice were characterized as bi-pathological tropism in the CNS and peripheral sites. EV71-induced immunopathogenesis reported in severe cases. increased levels of several cytokines and chemokines reported in children with brainstem encephalitis and PE. similar results were reported in clinical cases that IFN-, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-13 levels in the blood were significantly decreased in EV71-infected hSCARB2-transgenic mice. hSCARB2-transgenic mice show greater susceptibility to natural strains B and C in orchestrating HFMD and CNS-like syndromes. humanized N3 is expected to serve as therapeutic agent to treat HFMD and CNS-like syndromes in future. 5746-TW98 (C2) strain elicits a lethal neurological virulence of hind limb paralysis (HLP) and E59 (B4) can induce HFMD-like hair loss associated with scurf and a non-lethal HLP in hSCARB2-transgenic mice. survival rate was used as an index of pathogenesis of EV71 infection in experimental animal models. EV71-neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 was produced in ascetic fluid and purified as previously described. commercial mouse IgG2a isotype antibody (eBioscience, CA, USA) was used as the control. the PCR was performed with a total reaction volume of 50 l containing 2 l of cDNA, 1 the PCR buffer with 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM (each) of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.2 M of each primer, and 2 U of FastStart Taq polymerase. both 1-day and 7-day old mice were inoculated with 1107 pfu of live E59 and 3105 p for HFMD-like symptoms 5 = 80% hair loss associated with scurf (white spots), 4 = 50% HLS, 3 = >30% HLS, 2 = >10% HLS, 1 = 10% HLS and 0 = no HLS on the back and abdomen. EV71 viral particles were detected using a murine anti-EV71 monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International) followed by visualization using a DAB PLUS substrate kit (Zymed Laboratories) Specimens were observed using a Olympus BX51 Research Microscope (model BX51TRF, Olympus, Japan) the sequences of primer pairs specific to the target genes were the same as previously noted in [11]. the sequences of primer pairs specific to the target genes were the same as previously noted. mice were examined in anesthetic inhalator chamber containing isoflurane. EV71-neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 was produced in ascetic fluid and purified as previously described. serial diluted N3 (10 mg/mL) were incubated with EV71 genotype B or C viruses (m.o.i. = 0.5) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the mixtures were then inoculated into a monolayer of the 3T3-SCARB2 cell line in a 6-well plate at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. both 1-day and 7-day old mice were inoculated with 1107 pfu of live E59 and 3105 pfu live 5746 virus isolates subcutaneously (s.c.) for protection studies, the purified neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 (20 l of 10 mg/mL) were injected intraperitoneally into the mice after 3, 24, and 48 h after infection. a log-rank test was used to compare the results obtained from different groups with HLS or paralysis symptoms. a p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the symbol * and ** were used to indicate p-values 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. the purity of the isolated RNAs was examined using a spectrophotometer. the cDNA synthesis was performed using a transcriptor first Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, IN, USA) seven-day old mice preinfected with 1105 pfu of CVA16 were given 200 g N3 (\u2022), isotype antibody () and without treatment () at 3 h post infection. each group consisted of 5 to 7 mice and the results were representative of 2 independent experiments. optical density reading of N3 against nave EV71 genotypes showed high affinity on E59. however mouse anti-CVA16 antisera showed similar affinity on detection of these virions."}
