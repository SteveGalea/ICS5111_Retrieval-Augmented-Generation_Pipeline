{"summary": "-omics analyses can identify hundreds to thousands of signature features that characterize temporal microbial and host response events during the course of infection. features of interest are dependent on the experimental system and hypothesis, but -omics studies often interrogate the expression level of RNA or protein for a target of interest. -omics platforms can be a powerful tool to compare emergent IAV strain data with previously circulating strains for the purpose of threat characterization. in the last ten years, mass spectrometry instrumentation and methodology advancements have led to considerable knowledge of the host proteomic response to viral infection. NIAID-related data sets from these virus studies are publically accessible through the Influenza Research Database. the national center for bioinformatics (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) serves as a public repository for various high-throughput -omics experimental data [4]. lipid metabolism genes substantially differed in pH1N1-infected pigs versus those of IA30 infection. authors noted similar clinical courses of infection progression. also found significant differences between host species in lipid metabolism and inflammatory gene responses. x98 results in 48 differentially expressed genes including IL6, IL8, and CCL2. authors characterized transcriptomic responses based on disease severity in pigs. authors identified 13 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated proteins. authors found 5550 differentially expressed host genes after H5N1 infection and 2992 host genes after H7N9 infection at 6 days pi respectively. a 2012 study took similar approach using a Nimblegen chicken genome array to analyze 38,681 host genes in response to low and high pathogenic recombinant IAV infection in chickens. authors found 18 up-regulated proteins and 13 down-regulated proteins in the brains of infected chickens. ferrets are ideal for IAV in vivo studies, as they exhibit clinical symptoms of infection and can transmit IAV through sneezing. study identified 2926 genes that were significantly upregulated, and 637 genes that were downregulated. interferon-stimulated genes were markedly upregulated, including antiviral responses genes CXCL10, OAS1, IRF1 and RSAD2. authors identified a gene expression profile consisting of 31 probes that could classify samples based on both strain and severity of disease. proteomic LC-MS-MS was also assessed from monkey lungs and blood. a proteomics study compared highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and 19-H1N1 versus the less virulent Tx91 seasonal influenza strain. swine, mouse, and macaque lung infections with pH1N1 have also been comparatively assessed at the transcriptome level. a proteomic approach was used for pH1N1-infected cynomolgus macaques that identified over 100 differentially expressed proteins in the BAL versus uninfected controls. a significant increase at day 7 relative to day 5 pi in abundance of interleukins (ILs) including IL1B, IL2, the authors found that unlike H1N1-1918, H5N1 disseminated to extrapulmonary organs with upregulation of inflammasome genes more so than H1N1-1918. the authors noted that H5N1 also upregulated the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) authors state that the avian viruses were potentially suppressing gene expression in these two pathways. authors also assessed the host responses that could be targeted using FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed to treat H7N9 infection using six potential therapeutics. the highly-pathogenic H5N1 strain up-regulated proteins corresponding to inflammatory response, cell death, reactive oxygen species production, and complement response more so that the low-pathogenic H5N1 strain. study from last year identified over 1600 proteins collectively from days 1, 7, and 10 pi with H3N2 A/Hong Kong/X31. a multivariate estimation technique (MSET) was applied for H3N2 and H1N1 human infection. this technique could potentially diagnose influenza severity before the patient shows signs of sickness. the benefits of cell lines are saved for the discussion section. in 2014, researchers studied the transcriptomic responses of human cells infected with either avian-origin H7N9, H5N1, H7N7, or human seasonal H3N2. this finding suggests that the H7N9 has at least been partially adapted to humans. authors noted more efficient replication and viral titers for this partially adapted H7N9 bird flu strain at the human temperature of infection (37 \u00b0C) versus the avian favorable infecting 33 \u00b0C temperature. proteomic approaches have also been used on immortalized lung cell lines. cytoplasmic leakage of lysosomal proteins, including cathepsins, results in inflammasome activation, and apoptosis of the macrophage cell. in the discussion section, additional cell types and ways to provide more relevant cell culture platforms to study influenza -omics are discussed. swine -omics studies include Lin and co-workers\u2019 assessment of swine H1N1 IAV and Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) co-infection through microarray analysis. co-infected pigs had altered interferon and interleukin receptor expression, and differential expression for several chemokine and chemokine receptor genes. the authors identified 13 up-regulated and 21 down-regulated protein spots associated with molecular biosynthesis and heat shock proteins. avian IAV subtypes circulate in domestic and wild birds. of particular concern are H5N1 and H7N9 that have been transmitted from poultry to humans in Asia. authors found 5550 differentially expressed host genes after H5N1 infection and 2992 host genes after H7N9 infection at 6 days pi respectively. authors wanted to assess genes related to survivability, and deduced that CD274, RNF19B, OASL, ZC3HAV1, PLA2G6, GCH1 and USP18 were important factors for regulating IAV severity. ferrets are considered to be an ideal small animal model for IAV infection. they exhibit clinical symptoms of infection and can transmit IAV through sneezing. authors found 488 unique lipids in the lung and 191 lipids in the trachea. this study identified 2926 genes that were significantly upregulated, and 637 genes that were downregulated. interferon-stimulated genes were markedly upregulated, including antiviral responses genes CXCL10, OAS1, IRF1 and RSAD2. authors identified a gene expression profile consisting of 31 probes that could classify samples based on strain and severity of disease. in 2010, a proteomics study compared highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and 19-H1N1 versus the less virulent Tx91 seasonal influenza strain. over 35,000 peptides representing 4219 proteins were identified, with 400 increased proteins and 258 decreased proteins associated with viral infection. swine, mouse, and macaque lung infections with pH1N1 have also been comparatively assessed at the transcriptome level. a proteomic approach was used for pH1N1-infected cynomolgus macaques that identified over 100 differentially expressed proteins in the BAL versus uninfected controls. swine-origin virus caused higher mouse morbidity with numerous cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes having higher expression level in swine H1N1 infected groups. swine-origin virus caused higher mouse morbidity with numerous cytokines and interferon-stimulated genes having higher expression level in swine H1N1 infected groups. researchers at the university of North Carolina have generated a panel of genetically diverse mouse strains referred to as the Collaborative Cross (CC) and compared them to pre-cross strains for H1N1-PR8 infection outcomes. authors also assessed the host responses that could be targeted using FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed to treat H7N9 infection using six potential therapeutics. the highly-pathogenic H5N1 strain up-regulated proteins corresponding to inflammatory response, cell death, reactive oxygen species production, and complement response. a study from last year identified over 1600 proteins collectively from days 1, 7, and 10 pi with H3N2 A/Hong Kong/X31. a multivariate estimation technique was applied for H3N2 and H1N1 human infection. this technique could potentially diagnose influenza severity before the patient shows signs of sickness. in total, 64 influenza A, 9 influenza B, 32 rhinovirus, and 24 patients with fever were analyzed. the benefits of cell lines, as well as some drawbacks of their use are saved for the discussion section. in 2014, the Katze lab at the University of Washington studied the transcriptomic responses of human Calu-3 cells infected with either avian-origin H7N9, H5N1, H7N7, or human seasonal H3N2. this finding suggests that the H7N9 has at least been partially adapted to humans. coombs and co-workers have used a stable isotope labeling amino acid (SILAC) approach in cell culture and high throughput 2-D HPLC mass spectrometry to look at uninfected and infected A549 cells. key proteins upregulated after infection included Mx1, LTF, and VIM, while those downregulated included ERC1, L1CAM, and CTNNB1. authors found cytoplasmic leakage of lysosomal proteins, including cathepsins, results in inflammasome activation, and apoptosis of the macrophage cell. in the discussion section, additional cell types and ways to provide more relevant cell culture platforms to study influenza -omics are discussed. the study authors must relate their data sets to that of the underlying biology. a meta-analysis from 12 studies comparing IAV strains and SARS coronavirus showed a relationship between the expression of 57 chemokine subnetwork genes and influenza severity in mice. this type of meta-analysis is promising so future researchers can hopefully analyze a handful of genes to deduce the pathogenicity of an emerging IAV strain."}
