Was follow up of participants long enough\" Can results be more widely applied. subthemes explored factors that influenced perceived levels of stress, emotional distress and/or wellbeing. theme 1: organisational and operational factors were identified that related to key stressors associated with the workplace environment. both police and ambulance operatives felt powerless, as they had little control over outcomes for the patient or caller. feelings of powerlessness and lack of control appeared to contribute to the stress experienced by these operatives. in one study, self-efficacy was highlighted as important in helping reduce stress. PTSD symptomology was identified in police and ambulance operatives. calls relating to road traffic accidents, domestic violence, and suicides were commonly cited as the most distressing types of call. police operatives reported using both approach and avoidance coping strategies when engaging with callers. a lack of high quality training was identified by some operatives as contributing to stress levels, and created a negative perception of the organisation. poor training also resulted in lower personal responsibility for performance amongst fire and police operatives. study examined the introduction of an electronic dispatching system. system efficiencies do not necessarily reduce stress from clinical uncertainty. operatives also experienced frustration with callers\u2019 physical and linguistic capabilities. theme 2: interactions with others Three subthemes identified related to how operatives\u2019 experiences of stress were influenced by their interactions with other people. poor leadership frustrated EDC operatives and a lack of appropriate supervision enhanced the burden of professional responsibility (Palmer, 2014). the use of black humour between peers was mentioned by ambulance operatives. one study found no effect on stress and coping amongst those who received critical incident stress debriefing with peers compared to those who did not. not all operatives, however, reported gaining benefits from social support. some reported feeling that friends and family lacked understanding. operatives sometimes chose not to discuss their job with them. organisational culture sometimes resulted in a lack of opportunities in which to express emotions. operatives reported feeling invisible, and not fully recognised for their work, by the public, by their family, and sometimes by their colleagues. however, operatives did gain some benefit from feeling that they were playing an altruistic role in their service provision. physical layout and constricted or inadequate workspaces added to this sense of low control and increased stress. a lack of control over outcomes was identified as another source of stress across several studies. police and ambulance operatives still felt powerless, as they had little control. psychological stress associated with taking traumatic and sometimes abusive calls was explored in several studies. participants reported experiencing fear, helplessness, or horror in reaction to 32% of different types of calls that they received. PTSD symptomology was identified in police and ambulance operatives. four ambulance operatives in one study reported taking long-term sick-leave in the previous year due to job-stress. police operatives reported using both approach and avoidance coping strategies when engaging with callers. some studies reported instances of abusive calls. a lack of high quality training was identified by some operatives as contributing to stress levels. poor training also resulted in lower personal responsibility for performance amongst ambulance operatives. a high turnover of staff created additional stress amongst fire and police operatives. the adrenaline rush and variety experienced was cited as a reason for continuing in the role (Doerner, 1987; Shuler & Sypher, 2000; Coxon et al., 2016). despite these challenges, some operatives appeared to enjoy the fast-paced and sometimes exciting environment of the EDC. operatives felt out of control over workload and current activity within their area of responsibility after returning from rest breaks. lack of control over outcomes was identified as another source of stress across several studies. police and ambulance operatives still felt powerless, as they had little control over outcomes. psychological stress associated with taking traumatic and sometimes abusive calls was explored in several studies. participants reported experiencing fear, helplessness, or horror in reaction to 32% of different types of calls that they received. operatives reported higher peri-traumatic distress compared to police officers. four ambulance operatives in one study reported taking long-term sick-leave in the previous year due to job-stress. police operatives reported using both approach and avoidance coping strategies when engaging with callers. some studies reported instances of abusive calls. poor training also resulted in lower personal responsibility for performance amongst ambulance operatives. untrained supervisors and a high turnover of staff created additional stress amongst fire and police operatives. operatives in Sweden emphasised limited resources in the healthcare system. the adrenaline rush and variety experienced was cited as a reason for continuing in the role. the demands should not be underestimated, as operatives described having to juggle several competing and equally important tasks at once. high, relentless workloads were commonly reported. staff were cynical about a formal peer support service, doubting the value and confidentiality of the service. one study found no effect on stress and coping amongst those operatives who received critical incident stress debriefing with peers. work-life balance, such as adequate time off and outside interests, was considered vital, as was support from family and friends. operatives who reported less social support experienced greater psychological distress following exposure to a hurricane (Jenkins, 1997; Shakespeare-Finch, Rees & Armstrong, 2014; Adams, Shakespeare-Finch & Armstrong, 2015). not all operatives reported gaining benefits from social support. not expressing anger and frustration is vital for managing calls effectively. maintaining this neutrality can be challenging, especially when operatives self-identifie with the situation. however, organisational culture sometimes resulted in a lack of opportunities in which to express emotions. perceived lack of support, empathy, and understanding from supervisors and managers increased reported stress. management perceived as too distant from the role to truly understand its demands. some operatives also perceived failures by management to tackle conflict. staff were cynical about a formal peer support service, compared to those who did not. one study found no effect on stress and coping amongst those who received critical incident stress debriefing with peers, compared to those who did not. operatives experienced stronger emotional reactions to certain calls. dealing with inappropriate callers was also frustrating for operatives. maintaining emotional neutrality and not expressing anger and frustration is vital for managing calls effectively. despite the obvious importance of the role, operatives reported feeling invisible, and not fully recognised for their work, by the public, by their family, and sometimes by their colleagues. this feeling was common across different emergency services, as well as different countries. however, operatives did gain some benefit from feeling that they were playing an altruistic role in their service provision. an excessive and demanding workload is a common feature across call-centre work, and this may lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout. research exploring the effects of job-related exposure to trauma in emergency department personnel suggests that such exposure can have negative impacts on health and wellbeing. some EDC operatives experience conflict and abuse from callers. those who reported higher levels of emotional exhaustion also had higher rates of absence. educational programmes may help reduce compassion fatigue and burnout. despite the challenges of the role, and the potential risks for psychological health, the studies reviewed did identify some of the more positive aspects of the role. the findings from this review therefore highlight the unique combination of challenges faced by EDC operatives. review was intended to capture longitudinal and intervention studies. but none were identified during searching. findings are limited by a lack of data on long-term outcomes. authors declare there are no competing interests. authors declare there are no competing interests. authors declare there are no competing interests. the research in this article did not generate any data or code, as it was a systematic literature review."}
