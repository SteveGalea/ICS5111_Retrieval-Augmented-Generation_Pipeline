{"summary": "the use of vaccines has saved millions of lives globally. some diseases such as smallpox, polio and measles have almost been eradicated through vaccination. there are still remaining several infectious diseases for which vaccines are not yet available. peptide-based subunit vaccines are poorly immunogenic by themselves. the inclusion of immunostimulant (adjuvant) in the vaccine formulation is necessary to induce a more potent immune response. many efforts have been made toward the development of an effective adjuvant since 1970s. the focus of this review is to elucidate the structural, chemical and biological properties of adjuvants in the context of peptide-based vaccine development. the key immunological concepts that govern rational vaccine design will be discussed. the inclusion of adjuvant along with antigens in vaccine formulation is a well-established practice in experimental immunology. all of the mechanisms involve direct or indirect stimulation of APC. the encountered antigens may constantly be taken up by DC via pinocytosis and/or phagocytosis. LR are type 1 transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain of interspersed leucine-rich repeat motifs. engagement of PAMP with TLR will lead to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and NF which results in regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 and TNF-, and chemokines) tissue-resident (immature) DC and migratory (mature) DC undergo maturation process. antigens are presented to resident DC located in non-lymphoid tissues. they are usually found at secondary lymphoid organs, including the lymph nodes. retaining native conformation is essential for the activation of B cell receptors to elicit a humoral immune response. there is no requirement for the peptide epitope to adopt a specific conformation to stimulate a CTL response. alum-precipitated vaccine of diphtheria toxoid provided greater immune protection against challenge than a solution of diphtheria toxoid alone. alum-based adjuvants are composed of very small primary particles they are easily aggregated into a functioning unit in the vaccine formulation. alum-based adjuvants may provide a depot formation at the injection site. this event may lead to a longer exposure of the antigen to the APC and lymphocytes. other proposed mechanisms for adjuvanting activity of alum included activation of complement cascade,28 generation of granulomas at the injection site, recruitment of eosinophils and neutrophils. alum provoked the secretion of uric acid, which may contribute to the activation of NLRP3.27. inflammatory monocytes congregated to the injection site, recruited the antigen and process them for further T cell priming. recently, alum was found to induce cell death that resulted in subsequent release of host cell DNA. complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) is water-in-oil emulsion that additionally contains heat-killed mycobacteria. the toxicity of CFA led to the development of incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (IFA) the use of Montanide ISA 51 in combination with a cocktail of HIV-derived peptide antigen enhanced the immunogenicity of the antigenic peptide. but the vaccine candidate failed to meet safety requirement in clinical trials. healthy adults that developed higher antibody response were also more likely to produce severe systemic or local adverse reactions. MF59 is licensed in Europe as the adjuvant component of influenza vaccines. only 10% of radiolabeled squalene was present at the injection site 6 h after injection. the key element for the adjuvanticity of MF59 is the induction of chemokine secretion at the injection site. AS03 has not been studied as an adjuvant for synthetic peptide-based vaccines. the most common polymers are polylactic acid (PLA), chitosan, poly (lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA), polypeptides, polysterene, polyethylene glycol and their copolymers. PLGA polyesters degrade to produce lactic and glycolic acids in vivo. in vitro, injection of PLGA particles in absence of a TLR agonist was still able to promote IL-1 secretion. PLGA also showed promising result as an adjuvant for peptide-based cancer vaccination. anti-GnRH peptide antigen with different types of chitosan induced high levels of IgG isotype 1 production in rats compared with immunization with CFA. Chitosan with the highest acetylation degree was able to induce an immune response mediated by IgG isotype 2a. dendritic poly (t-butyl)acrylate (PtBA) polymer is an adjuvant for a GAS vaccine. the polymer is a peptide antigen derived from human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 protein. the polymer was administered as physical mixture with peptide antigens. it failed to induce any immune response. immunization with microparticles favored a Th2-biased immune response. lipid bilayers composed of natural or synthetic phospholipids surround an aqueous core. liposomes can be encapsulated within the aqueous core or attached to the outer surface of the liposome. peptide antigen could be conjugated to lipid moieties and anchored to the liposome. lipid moieties themselves may also be TLR 2 or TLR 4 agonists. increased retention time of antigen at the injection site and enhancing antigen uptake by macrophages are the primary explanation for their adjuvanting role. incorporated induced a high level of IFN- and IgG2a secretion. larger liposome complexes conferred greater protection against influenza virus challenge in ferrets. recent advances in liposome formulation include incorporation TLR agonist moieties. liposome-based systems are promising as effective vaccine adjuvants. Virus Like-Particles (VLP) and Virosomes Virus-like particles (VLP) are composed of several recombinant viral structural proteins that are self-assembled to mimic the conformation of native viruses. VLP have the ideal size (20\u2013100 nm in diameter) to be efficiently taken up by key immune cells. pejadar-Gaddy and colleagues constructed bovine papillomavirus (BPV) VLP that were chemically conjugated with a synthetic derivative of human mucin-1 (MUC1) peptide. the subcutaneous administration of this VLP-based vaccine in MUC1 transgenic mice triggered a robust activation of DC. this led to the presentation of antigen to both MHC class I and II. virosomes can induce a strong MHC I-restricted CTL response. a fraction of the antigen is still degraded within the endosome. the particulate forms of IRIV enable them to present the antigen to the immune system in a repetitive array to further enhance the immune response. Iscom, Iscomatrix, and Saponins Immunostimulatory complex are antigen-containing cage like structure (40 nm) that is composed of cholesterol, phospholipids and saponin. in ISCOM vaccines, the antigen is incorporated into the structure during the construction process. lipophilic acyl side-chain appears to enhance ability of quillaja saponins to stimulate CTL production. deacylated saponins failed to induce Th1 or CTL immune responses. degradation of quillaja saponins changed type of stimulated immune response. self-assembled peptides were constructed from self-assembled peptides. they could either be tubular, fibrillar or spherical nanostructures. they provided several advantages including multivalency, biological compatibility, multifunctionality, synthetic definition, molecular specificity. the conjugate elicited a specific immune response, with antisera exhibiting neutralization activity against SARS virus in an in vitro infection inhibition assay. another self-assembly peptide that is currently under intensive investigation is Q11. the vaccine candidate adopted a -sheet conformation and aggregated to form fibrils in a pH dependent manner. this discovery provides useful insight into the development of a safe vaccine adjuvant system since it can be produced in a highly controlled manner. most studies have demonstrated that their adjuvanticity effects are primarily dominated by the presentation of the epitope on their surface while maintaining the epitope native conformation. the aggregated MPL can be transported to the targeted immune cell membranes by LPS-binding protein. only conical lipid molecules that form cubic inverted aggregate structures conferred immunostimulatory activity. lipid molecules that bias toward lamellar-like aggregate structures provided low or no immunostimulatory activity. flagellin (structural protein present on bacterial flagellum) is potent activator of broad range of immune cells. intramuscular administration of flagellin with influenza virus peptide epitopes stimulated both humoral and cellular responses against influenza challenge. the use of CpG-DNA as an adjuvant was found to enhance the immunogenicity of the immunodominant CD8 T cell peptide epitopes. they found that the CD8 T cell peptide epitopes alone were presented by immature DC in lymph nodes. however, administration of the same peptide epitope with CpG-DNA failed to stimulate a CTL response against restricted T cell epitopes. the use of bacterial components as adjuvants is effective because bacteria represent a foreign antigen threat and trigger an immune response. however, if these components are not synthetically produced, it will be challenging to control the level of potential bacterial contaminants. lipopeptide carriers can stimulate TLR2 activation, improve peptide diffusion across epithelial barriers, and enhance peptide stability from enzymatic degradation. lipopeptides comprised of Pam3Cys have usually poor water-solubility. similar derivative, Pam2Cys, lacking one palmitic acid group, was conjugated to a B cell peptide epitope for contraceptive vaccination. adjuvant.143 constructs were reported as vaccine candidates against wide a range of diseases including GAS, 144 cancer,145 malaria,146 and hookworm. other lipid moieties such as palmatic acid derivatives (Pam3Cys and Pam2Cys), O-acyl serine, N-acyl lysine, and glycolipid compounds that were found to stimulate innate immunity were also investigated. peptide-based antigens usually target a specific immune response. but peptides are not able to trigger the recruitment and activation of cells involved in the non-specific immune response (adaptive immunity) this issue must be addressed through the development of next generation adjuvants. adjuvants that have similar properties to pathogens are easily taken up by DC to undergo further biological processing. the combination of adjuvants in formulations has brought a new era to vaccine development. it is clearly shown that adjuvants may confer their adjuvanticity effect via different mechanisms. knowledge about the stimulation of immunological events associated with adjuvants mode of action provides hope that effective peptide vaccines can be developed in the near future."}
