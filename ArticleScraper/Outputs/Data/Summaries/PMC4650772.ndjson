{"summary": "the patient's physical, laboratory, and radiologic findings were elicited by direct interview with the patient and family members. initial testing by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed at the IDH laboratory with confirmatory sequencing performed at the CDC. a positive test result with either or both assays is then confirmed with a third rRT-PCR assay also targeting the nucleocapsid gene (N3) serum from HKU1 human sera was not available for evaluation. sensitivity was determined by screening a limited number of serum samples from individuals with confirmed MERS-CoV infection. rRT-PCR screening assay consists of 2 signatures that target a region upstream of the MERS-CoV envelope protein gene (upE) and the nucleocapsid gene (N2). serology was done using a recombinant MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed by the CDC. both confirmatory assays were evaluated using similar panels of sera. the full genome sequence was determined from RNA obtained directly from sputum collected on day of illness 13. the sequence was deposited into the GenBank database as Indiana/USA-1_Saudi Arabia_2014 (accession number KJ813439). a nonproductive cough developed on DOI 10 and on DOI 11 he developed visible dyspnea and tachypnea. he used an albuterol meter\u2013dosed inhaler on both days without improvement. his sister drove him to the emergency department of a local hospital. 83 beats/minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation (O2Sat) of 90% on room air. his admission laboratory data were remarkable for lymphopenia (total lymphocyte count of 0.81 109/L), mildly elevated liver function tests, slight hyponatremia, and mildly elevated inflammatory markers.

IVIG has not been evaluated in MERS-CoV patients, but is unlikely to have been effective in this patient's recovery given his nonsevere clinical status. the effectiveness of IVIG treatment for SARS patients is unknown due to confounders, variable severity of illness when treatment was initiated, and the uncontrolled study design.
