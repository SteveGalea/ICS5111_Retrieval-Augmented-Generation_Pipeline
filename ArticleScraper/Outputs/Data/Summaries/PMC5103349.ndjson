{"summary": "Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligatory intracellular bacterium in the family Anaplasmataceae. it infects monocytes and macrophages in mammals and causes the emerging tick-borne zoonosis called human monocytic ehrlichiosis. E. chaffeensis has a small genome of 1.176 Mb with a limited capacity for biosynthesis and metabolism. it must depend mostly on host-synthesized nutrients for replication. ehrlichial inclusions maintain a weakly acidic intralumenal pH. autophagosomes can fuse with early or late endosomes, forming the amphisome, a hybrid organelle,20-24. autophagosomes or amphisomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. autophagy is an important innate immune response against intracellular infections by bacteria such as salmonella, Shigella, Listeria, and mycobacterium. E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum encode a type IV secretion (T4S) system11,38-41 that mediates the transport of bacterial DNA and/or proteins across the bacterial membrane into the eukaryotic cell to deregulate or modulate target cell functions. other than Ats-1, bacterial factors that induce autophagy to promote bacterial nutrition have not been reported. e. chaffeensis inclusion membranes are enriched with PtdIns3P and class III PtdIns3K A RAB5 effector, EEA1, localizes on E. chaffeensis replicative inclusions. we examined whether a 2FYVE finger protein probe with unique specificity for PtdIns3P in the absence of RAB5 is localized to E. chaffeensis replicative inclusions. E. chaffeensis (Ech)-infected RF/6A cells were transfected with plasmids encoding 2FYVE-GFP or FLAG-PIK3C3/VPS34. cells were fixed and stained with DAPI to indicate E. chaffeensis (pseudocolored in red) class III PtdIns3K was localized on 80% of E. chaffeensis replicative inclusions. cellular PtdIns3P was significantly higher in uninfected cells. cellular PtdIns3P was significantly higher in THP-1 cells at the beginning and during ehrlichial exponential replication. 3-MA was added to infected cells at 23 h p.i. and incubated for 6 h or 58 h. infection was greatly inhibited compared with untreated infected cells. 3-MA did not have direct toxicity on host mammalian cells. 3-MA reversibly inhibits E. chaffeensis replication in THP-1 cells. 3-MA added at 1 h or 1 d p.i. inhibits infection. arrows indicate E. chaffeensis in cells treated with 10 mM 3-MA at 23 h p.i. for 6 h (iv) and incubated an additional 52 h with (vi) or without (v) 3-MA. PIK3C3 and PtdIns3P are not only essential for endocytic sorting, trafficking, and maturation. spautin-1.58 Spautin-1 inhibits 2 USPs (ubiquitin-specific peptidases), USP10 and USP13, which target BECN1. both class III PtdIns3K activation and BECN1 are required for E. chaffeensis replication. ACT/actin was used as a loading control. the values under the bands show the relative ratio of band intensities normalized against ACT/actin. qPCR of E. chaffeensis 16S rDNA normalized to human gene. BMDMs from atg5flox/flox-Lyz2-Cre mice lack ATG5.66 E. chaffeensis infection in BMDMs from atg5flox/flox-Lyz2-Cre mice were markedly reduced compared with WT mice. the viability of BMDMs from atg5 TSKO and WT mice, either uninfected or infected with E. chaffeensis, was >90% at qPCR of E. chaffeensis 16S rDNA was normalized to mouse Gapdh. uninfected RF/6A cells were examined at 17 h p.t. HL-60 cells infected with E. chaffeensis (Ech) were harvested at 6 h, 1 d, 2 d, and 3 d p.i. RF/6A cells were transfected with LC3B siRNA or control scrambled siRNA for 2 d and incubated with E. chaffeensis for 2 d. LC3-I to LC3-II,61 and A. phagocytophilum inclusions are heavily encased by LC3-II. both GFP-LC3 and endogenous LC3B were observed as puncta in E. chaffeensis-infected RF/6A cells. l-glutamine and l-glutamate in uninfected THP-1 cells at 2 d p.i. were notably increased. cellular glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, and proline were profoundly depleted at 3 d p.i. uninfected THP-1 cells were prelabeled with [3H]-glutamine for 1 d and then infected with E. chaffeensis for 2 d in the absence of [3H]-glutamine in the fresh culture medium. the cells were then incubated with or without 3-MA for an additional 6 h prior to harvesting at 2 d p.i. E. chaffeensis-infected cells were treated at 1 d p.i. with 3-MA or 3-MA and amino acids (3-MA + AA) for 2 d. percentage of infected cells (B) and number of bacteria (C) were scored in each group. inclusions via autophagy were ectopically expressed in untreated cells. E. chaffeensis induces autophagy independently of MTOR, ULK1, PRKA/AMPK, and ubiquitination pathways. infection of E. chaffeensis in THP-1 cells for 1 d did not alter activation status of ULK1, RPS6 or PRKA. ubiquitination binds LC3 via SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1).78-80 The autophagic sequestration of invading bacteria is important immune mechanism. Etf-1 promotes E. chaffeensis infection and traffics to E. chaffeensis inclusions. qPCR was performed at 1 d p.i.43. we examined whether Etf-1 has additional effects on E. chaffeensis infection. secondary antibodies with distinct fluorochromes were used for VirB6-2 labeling before (red) and after (blue) saponin treatment. DAPI was used to stain DNA in host cell nuclei and E. chaffeensis DNA. 87 Cytoplasmic Etf-1 was labeled with anti-Etf-1 after SLO treatment. intrainclusion ehrlichial protein VirB6-240 was not labeled with anti-VirB6-2 in SLO-treated cells. both Etf-1 and VirB6-2 could be labeled with their respective antibodies. FP-LC3 alone was ectopically expressed, they each showed a few weak and small puncta in uninfected cells. 80% of Etf-1 puncta colocalized with ATG5 or LC3. Etf-1 activates PtdIns3K and colocalizes with ATG5 and LC3. expansions of polyglutamine tracts in HTT causes aggregation of polyglutamine peptides. NPEPPS/PSA (aminopeptidase, puromycin sensitive; EC 3.4.11.14) is a mammalian cytosolic Zn2+ metallopeptidase that can digest aggregation-prone proteins including polyglutamine-containing peptides. NPEPPS-GFP colocalizes with Etf-1 in cotransfected cells. DH82 cells were sequentially transfected first with Etf-1 and 1 d later with NPEPPS-GFP. at 1 d p.t. with NPEPPS-GFP, cells were immunostained with anti-Etf-1. RF/6A cells cotransfected with Q103-GFP and Etf-1 were immunostained with anti-Etf-1 (red); exposure time, 0.6 sec. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-GFP and - ACT/actin IgG. ation of THP-1 cells with anti-Etf-1 IgG followed by western blotting showed that native Etf-1 was not ubiquitinated. a positive control, strong ubiquitination was detected on Q103-GFP aggregates. RAB5 regulates endosome maturation to late endosomes. Western blotting results showed that E. chaffeensis infection was significantly reduced by RAB5 knockdown compared with the control scrambled-siRNA transfection. we examined whether exogenous RAB5 traffics to already established E. chaffeensis inclusions by transfecting GFP-RAB5. the values under the bands show the relative ratio of band intensities normalized against ACT/actin. the ratios of those from control siRNA set as 1. (B to D) cells were subjected to immunofluorescence labeling with rabbit anti-P28 (AF555) endogenous PIK3C3 and RAB5 proteins were consistently upregulated in uninfected cells compared with uninfected cells. recombinant Etf-1 interacted with endogenous RAB5, PIK3C3, and. E. chaffeensis inclusions recruit Etf-1, RAB5, and major components of the class III PtdIns3K complex through protein-protein interactions. the results suggest that RAB-bound RAB5 interacts with Etf-1 and the BECN1-class III PtdIns3K complex, and promotes infection RAB GTPase cycles. 5A-DN and RAB5A-CA, PIK3C3 and BECN1 interacted with Etf-1 only in presence of RAB5A (WT) and RAB5A-CA. enlarged GFP-RAB5A-CA endosomes colocalized with Etf-1 puncta. HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP, GFP-RAB5 (WT, DN, or CA mutant) and then infected with E. chaffeensis at 1 d p.t. for 2 d. images were representative of 3 experiments with similar results. overexpression of GFP-RAB5A-DN impaired E. chaffeensis infection. is inclusion membranes are enriched with PtdIns3P and class III PtdIns3K A RAB5 effector, EEA1. we examined whether a 2FYVE finger protein probe with unique specificity for PtdIns3P in the absence of RAB5 and an ER-localization signal44 is localized to E. chaffeensis replicative inclusions. ensis inclusion membrane is enriched with PtdIns3P and class III PtdIns3K. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding 2FYVE-GFP or FLAG-PIK3C3/VPS34. at 15 h p.t. (2 d p.i.), cells were fixed and stained with DAPI. cellular PtdIns3P was significantly higher in E. chaffeensis-infected THP-1 cells at the beginning and during ehrlichial exponential replication (1 and 2 d p.i., respectively) than in uninfected cells (Fig. 1D, 2 d p.i. data not shown). 3-MA was added to infected cells at 23 h p.i. and incubated for 6 h or 58 h. infection was greatly inhibited compared with untreated infected cells. 3-MA did not have direct toxicity on host mammalian cells. 3-MA does not inhibit internalization of E. chaffeensis. 3-MA added at 1 h or 1 d p.i. inhibits E. chaffeensis infection. PIK3C3 and PtdIns3P are not only essential for endocytic sorting, trafficking, and maturation. 3-MA is known to inhibit autophagy in mammalian cells. spautin-1.58 Spautin-1 inhibits 2 USPs (ubiquitin-specific peptidases), USP10 and USP13, which target BECN1.58 Spautin-1 treatment of infected cells significantly decreased E. chaffeensis proliferation. both class III PtdIns3K activation and BECN1 are required for E. chaffeensis replication. ACT/actin was used as a loading control. values show relative ratio of band intensities normalized against ACT/actin. qPCR of E. chaffeensis 16S rDNA normalized to human DNA. BMDMs from atg5flox/flox-Lyz2-Cre mice lack ATG5.66 E. chaffeensis infection in BMDMs from atg5flox/flox-Lyz2-Cre mice were markedly reduced compared with WT mice. ectopically expressed GFP-ATG5 transfected at 1 d p.i. localized to E. chaffeensis inclusions. qPCR of E. chaffeensis 16S rDNA was normalized to mouse Gapdh. uninfected RF/6A cells were examined at 17 h p.t. (41 h p.i.) HL-60 cells infected with E. chaffeensis were harvested at 6 h, 1 d, 2 d, and 3 d p.i. RF/6A cells were transfected with LC3B siRNA or control scrambled siRNA (Neg.) for 2 d and incubated with E. chaffeensis. both GFP-LC3 and endogenous LC3B were observed as puncta in E. chaffeensis-infected RF/6A cells at 2 to 3 d p.i. the conversion from LC3B-I to LC3B-II did not increase during exponential E. chaffeensis proliferation. LC3B-II localization to E. chaffeensis inclusions was not followed by the LC3B-II localization. 35,37 E. chaffeensis increases cellular glutamine and glutamate and takes up host-incorporated amino acids Mammalian cellular free amino acid concentrations are tightly regulated by membrane transporters and the autophagy pathway. uninfected THP-1 cells were prelabeled with [3H]glutamine for 1 d and then infected with E. chaffeensis for 2 d in the absence of [3H]-glutamine in the fresh culture medium. the cells were then incubated with or without 3-MA for an additional 6 h prior to harvesting at 2 d p.i. 3-MA is partially rescued upon supplementation with essential amino acids. the percentage of infected cells (B) and number of bacteria (C) were scored in each group. y cargo protein human GAPDH70 was ectopically expressed in untreated cells. compared with untreated cells, brief treatment with diisopropylfluorophosphate increased the presence of DsRed-GAPDH inside E. chaffeensis inclusions. toRC2)77 or rapamycin treatment activated ULK1 by dephosphorylation at Ser757 and RPS6 at Ser240/244. but not PRKAA at Thr172. infection of E. chaffeensis in THP-1 cells for 1 d did not alter activation status of ULK1, RPS6 or PRKA. infected cells using the Chariot protein delivery system at 1 d p.i.43. qPCR was performed at 2 d p.i. Etf-1 promotes E. chaffeensis infection and traffics to E. chaffeensis inclusions. antibodies with distinct fluorochromes were used for VirB6-2 labeling before (red) and after (blue) saponin treatment. DAPI was used to stain DNA in host cell nuclei and E. chaffeensis DNA. intrainclusion ehrlichial protein VirB6-240 was not labeled with anti-VirB6-2 in SLO-treated cells. both Etf-1 and VirB6-2 could be labeled with their respective antibodies. native Etf-1 is present on the cytoplasmic face of inclusions. Etf-1 activates PtdIns3K and colocalizes with ATG5 and LC3. hek293 cells cotransfected with GFP-ATG5 and Etf-1-DsRed were treated at 1 d p.t. with 10 nM BAF for 16 h prior to fixation. expansions of polyglutamine tracts in HTT causes aggregation of polyglutamine peptides. NPEPPS/PSA (aminopeptidase, puromycin sensitive; EC 3.4.11.14) is a mammalian cytosolic Zn2+ metallopeptidase that can digest aggregation-prone proteins including polyglutamine-containing peptides such as HTT via autophagy. NPEPPS/PSA-GFP colocalizes with Etf-1 in cotransfected cells and surrounds E. chaffeensis inclusions. DH82 cells were sequentially transfected first with Etf-1 and 1 d later with NPEPPS-GFP. white arrows indicate the colocalization between the 2 proteins. RF/6A cells cotransfected with Q103-GFP and Etf-1 were immunostained with anti-Etf-1 (red); exposure time, 0.6 sec. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-GFP and - ACT/actin IgG. infected THP-1 cells with anti-Etf-1 IgG followed by western blotting, native Etf-1 was not ubiquitinated. as a positive control, strong ubiquitination was detected on Q103-GFP aggregates. RAB5 regulates endosome maturation to late endosomes. Western blotting results showed that E. chaffeensis infection was significantly reduced by RAB5 knockdown compared with the control scrambled-siRNA transfection. we examined whether exogenous RAB5 traffics to already established E. chaffeensis inclusions by transfecting GFP-RAB5. E. chaffeensis-infected RF/6A cells at 1 d p.i. were transfected with ACT/actin. at 15 h p.t. cells were subjected to immunofluorescence labeling with rabbit anti-P28 (AF555) CN1 and PIK3C3 bound to RAB5 in uninfected cells. infection highly upregulated this complex formation. recombinant Etf-1 interacted with endogenous RAB5, PIK3C3 and BECN1 in uninfected THP-1 cells. E. chaffeensis inclusions recruit Etf-1, RAB5, and major components of the class III PtdIns3K complex through protein-protein interactions. RAB5 interacts with Etf-1 and the BECN1-class III PtdIns3K complex, and promotes infection RAB GTPase cycles between GTP- and GDP-bound forms. fluorescence microscopy showed enlarged GFP-RAB5A-CA endosomes that colocalized with Etf-1 puncta. hek293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing Etf-1-HA and GFP (CTL or GFP-RAB5A) overexpression of GFP-RAB5A-DN impaired E. chaffeensis infection compared with cells transfected with GFP-RAB5A or GFP-RAB5A-CA. SGSM3 overexpression at 1 d p.i. profoundly impaired E. chaffeensis replication compared with overexpression of SGSM3R165A mutant105. infection-induced autophagy does not kill the pathogen; pathogen growth is autophagy dependent. the inhibition is not due to reduced viability of the host cells, or due to direct toxicity to bacteria. ectopically expressed Etf-1 induces vesicles that colocalize with ATG5 and LC3. RAB5 is found in nascent phagosomes and early endosomes that lack the microbicidal capacity required to kill invading pathogens. inactivation of RAB5 GTPase on inclusions protects E. chaffeensis from a microbicidal mechanism and expands inclusions via homotypic fusion but also enhances \u201cRAB5-regulated autophagy\u201d as result of the increase in GTP-bound RAB5. E. chaffeensis inclusions lack ubiquitination, LC3, and late endosome or lysosomal markers. they do contain ATG5, PIK3C3, PtdIns3P, and RAB5. it is still unclear how host cytoplasmic molecules enter into inclusions. E. chaffeensis has surface proteases that are required for its replication. cytosolic NPEPPS, which is incorporated into Etf-1 autophagosomes and targeted to E. chaffeensis inclusions, is also expected to aid degradation of autophagic cargo. aNKFY1 plays a role in homotypic early endosomal fusion, micropinocytosis, and retromer-based transport. macropinocytosis and endocytosis directly deliver some extracellular nutrients to E. chaffeensis in inclusions. a T4S effector interacts with autophagy proteins to induce autophagosome formation. 1% amino acid sequence identity selectively target and promote E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum growth,37 respectively. how the 2 molecules recruit distinct autophagy membrane precursors and recognize the parent bacterial inclusions remains to be studied. full-length RAB5A was cloned into pET-41a(+) for GST-RAB5A expression. pEGFP-C1-ATG5 (pEGFP-C1-hApg5) was obtained from Addgene (plasmid 22952, deposited by Dr. Noboru Mizushima) RF/6A cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Etf-1-GFP, GFP-RAB5A, GFP-RAB5B, GFP-ANKFY1, FLAG-PIK3C3, 2FYVE-GFP, GFP-ATG5, or NPEPPS-GFP. localization was determined at 15 to 17 h (or 24 h for NPEPPS-GFP). transfected cells were infected 1 d p.t., and localization was determined at 3 d p.i. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubated with rabbit anti-P28, followed by secondary antibodies AF488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. DAPI was used to label DNA in the host cell nucleus and E. chaffeensis. localization of Etf-1 in the host cell nucleus was determined using SLO. cells were immediately fixed in 4% PFA and incubated with rabbit anti-Etf-1 (1:100) and mouse anti-VirB6-2 (1:50), followed by incubation with AF488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. cells were treated with or without 10 nM BAF (Enzo, BML-CM110-0100) for 16 h at 1 d p.t., prior to fixation in PFA. to examine the distribution of NPEPPS-GFP and Etf-1, sequential transfections were performed. colocalization of Etf-1 was analyzed by Coloc 2 in the NIH Image J software package. data were presented as average colocalization percentage or Pearson coefficients (r 100) standard deviation. 3-MA, amino acid supplementation, rapamycin, and PAQ-22 treatment. 3 105 THP-1 cells were infected with E. chaffeensis in 1 ml complete RPMI 1640 medium. cells were washed to remove 3-MA, and the incubation was continued for an additional 52 h. assay Uninfected or E. chaffeensis-infected cells (2 106 cells) at 1 d p.i. were collected.
