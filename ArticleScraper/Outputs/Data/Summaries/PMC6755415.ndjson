{"summary": "the virus causes localized or diffuse inflammation of the myocardium. it stimulates the immune response, thus causing sustained damage to the myocardial tissues (1,2) CVB3 can induce oxidative stress response and apoptosis in a few weeks. experimental animals and materials A total of 80 healthy male SPF grade mice aged 6 weeks and weighing 25.15.53 g were selected. the mice were fed in a plastic box with bedding material on a solid bottom with the temperature of 22\u00b0C. the relative humidity between 50 and 65%, 12 h day-night rhythm was normal. the pathological changes of mouse myocardial tissues were observed under light microscope (Olympus Corp.) the pathological score of the mouse myocardial tissues was evaluated. expression levels of mRNA in TNF- and TGF-1 detected by RT-qPCR. a total of 12\u201318 l of 10 M Oligo (dT) was added, mixed and heated at 70\u00b0C for 10 min. 1 l of Superscript II was added, incubated at 42\u00b0C for 30 min. ice bath was followed for 5 min. expression levels of TNF- protein and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues measured by western blot analysis. extracted protein was boiled at 100\u00b0C for 5 min to denaturate. then separated with 10% SDS-PAGE after being cooled, transferred to the PVDF membrane. correlation analysis was performed between pathological score and protein expression levels of TNF- and TGF-1 in myocardial tissues of mice in each group. t-test was used for comparison between the two groups. mice were intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 ml PBS (phosphate buffersaline) at 0.1 mmol/l. mice in the control group were intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 ml diluent of CVB3 at 100 TCID50/0.1 ml. total RNA (2 l) was added into the myocardial tissue of mice to extract the total RNA in the blood. concentration and quality of total RNA were detected by ultraviolet spectrophotometer (purchased from Shanghai Yuanxi Instrument Co., Ltd.) the primer sequences were synthesized and designed by Shanghai Gemma Company. the experiment was repeated 3 times. the result was analyzed with 2Cq method (12). observation indicators i) Eight-day survival rates of mice in each group were recorded and compared. expression levels of TNF- mRNA and TGF-1 mRNA in myocardial tissues of mice in each group were evaluated. the mice were fed in a plastic box with bedding material on a solid bottom with the temperature of 22\u00b0C. the relative humidity between 50 and 65%, 12 h day-night rhythm was normal, and they were free to eat and drink. the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Central Hospital of Zibo (Zibo, China) the pathological score of the myocardial tissues was evaluated. the judgement scores were as follows: 1 point, when the proportion of inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis was between 25 and 50%, 2 points, when the proportion of inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis was between 51 and 75%, 4 points, when the proportion of inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis was >75%. superscript II was added, incubated at 42\u00b0C for 30 min, and heated at 70\u00b0C for 10 min. qPCR reaction system was: 2 l reverse transcription product, 0.5 l upstream primer, 0.5 l downstream primer, 2X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix 10 l. expression levels of TNF- mRNA and TGF-1 mRNA were detected with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. the protein was boiled at 100\u00b0C for 5 min to denaturate, then separated with 10% SDS-PAGE after being cooled. the primary rabbit anti-mice polyclonal antibodies of TNF- (1:500), TGF-1 (1:500) and -actin (1:1,000) were added at 4\u00b0C for incubation overnight, then the secondary goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody (dil, 1:500; cat. no. SA00001-2; ProteinTech Group, t-test was used for comparison between the two groups. GraphPad Prism 6 software (Hangzhou Aimeilv Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) was used to draw experimental images. the myocardial histopathological scores of mice in blank and the control group were respectively 0.330.04 and 0.340.06. the myocardial histopathological score of mice in the VMC group was 1.850.11. myocardial histopathological scores of mice in MG-132 were significantly lower than those in VMC and MG-132 group. expression levels of TNF- and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues of mice in each group were significantly lower than those in the MG-132 group (P0.05) expression levels of TNF- and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues of mice in each group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group (P0.05) expression levels of TNF- and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues of mice in each group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group (P0.05) correlation analysis of pathological score in myocardial tissues. expression levels of TNF- protein and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues. expression levels of TNF- protein and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues. a total of 11 mice in the MG-132 group died at day 8, with a survival rate of 45%. a total of 5 mice in the MG-132 group died at day 8, with a survival rate of 75%. the survival rate of mice in the MG-132 group was significantly higher than that of the VMC group. myocardial histopathological scores of mice in MG-132 were significantly lower than those in the VMC group. expression levels of mRNA of TNF- and TGF-1 in myocardial tissues of mice in each group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group. expression levels of TNF- mRNA and TGF-1 mRNA in myocardial tissues of MG-132 group were significantly lower than those of the VMC group. expression levels of TNF- protein and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues of mice in each group were significantly lower than those in the MG-132 group. expression levels of TNF- and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues of mice in each group were significantly lower than those in the MG-132 group. expression levels of TNF- protein and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues were positively correlated with the pathological score of myocardial tissues. there was a positive correlation between the pathological score of mice in myocardial tissues and the expression of TNF- protein in myocardial tissues. in the MG-132 group was significantly higher than that of the VMC group. the survival rate of the blank group and the control group was 100%. the 8-day survival rate of the MG-132 group was significantly higher than that of the VMC group. expression levels of mRNA of TNF- and TGF-1 in myocardial tissues of mice in each group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group. expression levels of TNF- mRNA and TGF-1 mRNA in myocardial tissues of mice in each group were significantly lower than those of the VMC group. expression levels of TNF- and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues of mice in the MG-132 group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group. expression levels of TNF- and TGF-1 protein in myocardial tissues of mice were positively correlated with the pathological score of myocardial tissues. Pearson's correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the pathological score of mice in myocardial tissues and the expression of TNF- protein in myocardial tissues of VMC mice. TNF-, tumor necrosis factor-; TGF-1, transforming growth factor-1; VMC, viral myocarditis. myocardial histopathological scores, mRNA and protein of TNF- and TGF-1 in the MG-132 group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group (P0.05). this suggests that the intervention of UPS inhibitor MG-132 can effectively improve the inflammatory infiltration in myocardial tissues of VMC mice. the expression levels of TNF- and TGF-1 proteins in myocardial tissues were positively correlated with the pathological score in myocardial tissues of mice. the expression levels of TNF- and TGF-1 proteins in myocardial tissues of VMC mice were also positively correlated with the pathological score in myocardial tissues. ethical approval and consent to participate The study was approved by the ethics committee of central hospital of zibo (Zibo, china). patient consent for publication Not applicable The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
