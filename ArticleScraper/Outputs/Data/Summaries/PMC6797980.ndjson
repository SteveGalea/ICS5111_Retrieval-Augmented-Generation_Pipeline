{"summary": "DCs capture and process antigens in the periphery in an immature state. they migrate to lymphoid organs and act as potent activators of T cell-mediated immunity. inflammatory monocytic cells, such as DCs, are recruited to the site of invasion in the intestine. challenge of DCs with T. gondii tachyzoites induces maturation events, e.g., moderate elevation of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC class II. differences in responses have been reported for human and murine DCs. Egr-1 promotes differentiation at the expense of the granulocytic lineage. mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling has been implicated in the regulation of Egr-1 responses. the role of Egr-1 in DC maturation has remained unelucidated. the purified cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), gentamicin (20 g/ml), glutamine (2 mM), and HEPES (0.01 M; Gibco), referred to as complete medium. recombinant mouse GM-CSF (Peprotech) was replenished every other day. parasite culture toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites of wild-type dsRed-expressing Prugniaud strain (PRU-RFP, type II) and knockout Prugniaud ku80 (PRUku80, type II) and Prugniaud ku80 gra24 (PRUgra24, type II) lines were maintained by serial 2 days passages in human fibroblast monolayers. WT or MyD88/ BMDCs (5 105) were cultured with CM or indicated inhibitors. BMDCs were challenged with freshly egressed T. gondii tachyzoites for 1 (MOI 5), 2, 4, or 8 h (MOI 3) qPCR results were displayed as fold change relative to non-challenged or as Cq and relative to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and -actin (mouse) or Importin-8 and TATA-binding protein (human) as housekeeping genes. BMDCs or confluent HFFs were cultured in complete medium and challenged with freshly egressed T. gondii tachyzoites. proteins were revealed by mean of enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) in a BioRad ChemiDoc XRS+. densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH, MD, USA) cells were stained with anti-Egr-1 antibodies and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (A-21442, Invitrogen) antibodies. lentivirus-containing supernatants were centrifuged to eliminate cell debris, filtered through 0.45 m filters and used immediately or aliquoted and kept at 80\u00b0C. lentivirus-containing supernatants were harvested 24 and 48 h post-transfection. BMDCs were cultured in 96-well plates in CM with and without freshly egressed T. gondii tachyzoites (PRU-RFP or CMTMR dye (Invitrogen)-stained WT or gra24 PRUku80, MOI 3, 4 h) live cell imaging was performed for 1 h, 1 frame/min, at 10 magnification on a Zeiss Z1 Observer. BMDCs were challenged with freshly egressed T. gondii tachyzoites (PRU-RFP, MOI 1, infection frequencies ranged between 15 and 30%) or 100 ng/mL LPS. the area under the curve was calculated with the R package PK with bootstrapping. cells from bone marrow of wild-type (WT) or MyD88/ 6\u201310-weeks-old male or female C57BL/6 mice were cultivated in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), gentamicin (20 g/ml), glutamine (2 mM), and HEPES (0.01 M), complete medium (all reagents from Life Technologies), and supplemented with 20 ng/ml recombinant fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma), gentamicin (20 g/ml; Gibco), glutamine (2 mM; Gibco), and HEPES (0.01 M; Gibco), referred to as DMEM. tachyzoites of wild-type dsRed-expressing Prugniaud strain were maintained by serial 2 days passages in human foreskin fibroblast monolayers. qPCR analysis WT BMDCs (2 106) were cultured with CM or challenged with freshly egressed T. gondii tachyzoites (PTG) for 30 min or 1 h (MOI 5) or 2, 4, 8, or 12 h (MOI 3), the equivalent number of sonicated T. gondii tachyzoites or heat-inactivated T. gondii tachyzoites or LPS qPCR results were analyzed using the Cq method. qPCR results were displayed as fold change relative to non-challenged or as Cq. qPCR results were displayed as fold change relative to non-challenged or as Cq. proteins were separated using 8% or 10% SDS-PAGE. blotted onto a PVDF membrane and blocked (10% BSA) cells were stained with anti-TATA-binding protein (TBP; ab51841, abcam), anti-EGR1 (15F7, Cell Signaling), anti-phosho-p38 (D3F9, Cell Signaling), anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (7074S, Cell Signaling) a threshold was set and defined as the mean of the 3x 20 brightest pixels from 3 fields of view. cells stained with DAPI and anti-rabbit Alexa fluor 594 were considered positive. lentivirus-containing supernatants were centrifuged to eliminate cell debris. d with lentivirus-containing supernatant in the presence of DEAE-dextran (10 g/mL; Sigma) or treated with DEAE-dextran alone for 4 h followed by washing with CM and further culture in the presence of GM-CSF. expression of GFP was confirmed by epifluorescence microscopy repeatedly after transduction and before cells were used in experiments after a total of 8 days. BMDCs were challenged with freshly egressed T. gondii tachyzoites (PRU-RFP, MOI 1, infection frequencies ranged between 15 and 30%) or 100 ng/mL LPS or left unchallenged for 24 h. murine bone marrow-derived DCs were challenged with live T. gondii tachyzoites. BMDCs showed a rapid and relatively short-lived (2 h) Egr-1 mRNA response. lysate from T. gondii tachyzoites presented a biphasic up-regulation of Egr-1 mRNA expression. immunofluorescence staining confirmed a strong Egr-1 signal with nuclear localization in BMDCs. this indicated that the global Egr-1 mRNA upregulation observed in T. gondii-infected BMDCs was mirrored in nuclear Egr-1 protein levels in human foreskin fibroblasts. a similar, but less pronounced, expression pattern was also observed for Egr-2. each timepoint represents the mean SEM of 3 independent experiments. bars indicate, for each condition, the cumulative Egr-1 fold change SE (*p 0.05, **p 0.01, ***p 0.001, ns p > 0.05, permutation test) BMDCs challenged at MOI 1 and infected with T. gondii tachyzoites (PTG, GFP+/Alexa 594+) related to the total by-stander population (GFP/Alexa 594+) or challenged with LPS (10 ng/mL), heat-inactivated tachyzoites or tachyzoite lysate. in myD88-deficient BMDCs, the immediate-early Egr-1 mRNA up-regulation was substantially reduced while the extended Egr-1 mRNA up-regulation phase was retained. non-significant differences were observed at 8 h. qPCR analysis of Egr-1 cDNA from unchallenged MoDCs or MoDCs challenged with freshly egressed T. gondii tachyzoites (PRUku80) at indicated timepoints.

Western blotting analyses corroborated that pan-p38 MAPK inhibition, but not MEK1/2, reduced signal corresponding to Egr-1 protein. representative micrographs of BMDCs challenged with freshly egressed GFP-expressing T. gondii tachyzoites. cells stained for Egr-1 (red) and with DAPI (blue) red arrows indicate infected DCs. white arrows indicate by-stander DCs. both murine BMDCs and human MoDCs challenged with gra24 tachyzoites exhibited a robust Egr-1 mRNA induction. however, the Egr-1 expression was reduced below baseline by MEK1/2 inhibition. western blotting showed reduced Egr-1 signal upon challenge with gra24 tachyzoites. qPCR analysis of Egr-1 cDNA from BMDCs challenged with freshly egressed gra24 or WT T. gondii tachyzoites 1 h in complete medium. Relative expression (2Cq) is displayed as mean SE (n = 6\u20137, *p 0.05, ns p > 0.05, ANOVA, Dunnett's) representative Western blot of BMDCs challenged with freshly egressed gra24 or WT T. gondii tachyzoites (PRUku80) for 8 h in complete medium and separated into nucleus- (nuclear) and cytosol-enriched (cytosolic) fractions. p38 MAPK inhibition non-significantly affected the migrated distance. inhibition of MEK1/2 essentially abolished T. gondii-induced hypermotility. both inhibitors non-significantly affected the baseline motility of unchallenged BMDCs. expression is normalized to mock and displayed as mean SE (n = 3, *p 0.05, ns p > 0.05, ANOVA, Tukey HSD). representative micrographs of mock transduced BMDCs or BMDCs transduced with shLuc-GFP or shEgr1-GFP lentivirus either left unchallenged or challenged with T. gondii tachyzoites. T. gondii-infected BMDCs showed migratory velocities comparable to those of control- and mock-transduced cells. we conclude that Egr-1 expression and p38 MAPK signaling non-significantly impact on Toxoplasma-induced hypermigration of BMDCs. IL-2 expression was significantly lower in BMDCs challenged with GRA24-deficient (gra24) compared to WT T. gondii (PRUku80) and increased by pan-p38 inhibition. qPCR analysis of Il12p40 cDNA from BMDCs challenged for 8 h with freshly egressed gra24 or WT T. gondii tachyzoites. qPCR analysis of Il2 cDNA from BMDCs challenged for 8 h with freshly egressed gra24 or WT T. gondii tachyzoites. a 24 h challenge with LPS led to a significant down-regulation of Egr-1 expression.
