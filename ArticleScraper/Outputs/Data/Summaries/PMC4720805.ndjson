{"summary": "the first case of novel coronavirus (CoV) infection known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was reported in Saudi Arabia, September 2012 (1). this is the first case report of serial imaging findings of chest CT and radiographs in a patient with MERS in south Korea. intravenous fluid was used for abdominal pain. he began coughing 9 days after the onset of fever. he underwent laboratory examination for MERS. initial posteroanterior chest radiograph and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan were performed in outside hospital on day of discharge. Chest radiograph (A) shows patchy increased opacity (black arrow) in left lower lung zone, retrocardiac area. upper lung CT scan (G) shows markedly reduced extent of previous mixed consolidations and GGOs with air-bronchograms. lower lung CT scan (H) demonstrates markedly decreased extent of previous mixed consolidations and GGOs with air-bronchograms. traction bronchiectasis (white arrowheads) with volume loss in left lower lobe. dromedary camels are thought to be the primary animal host. DISCUSSION Middle East respiratory syndrome is a disease caused by infection of a new coronavirus, which is currently named MERS-CoV. a recent study described lung changes on serial chest radiographs of 55 patients with MERS (19 deceased and 36 recovered) pleural effusion, pneumothorax, a higher chest radiographic score at the time of peak radiographic deterioration, and a high number of comorbidities were associated with a poor prognosis. however, they did not describe detailed changes of radiologic abnormalities, especially on CT scans. follow-up imaging showed decreased extent of previously detected lesions with remaining fibrotic changes. this is the first case report that includes serial imaging findings of chest CT and radiographs."}
