{"summary": "respiratory viruses are reported triggers for exacerbations, but information on these infections with asthma is sparse in Caribbean territories. a multitarget, sensitive, specific high-throughput Respiratory MultiCode assay tested for respiratory-virus sequences for eight distinct groups. RV was prevalent throughout the year (Dry, n = 6, 15.8%; Rainy, n = 19, 17.0%) in both seasons. emerging wheezing illnesses during childhood can be linked to rhinovirus in Trinidad's tropical environment. studies using conventional and molecular methods to detect respiratory viruses in asthma [6,7], suggest reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT \u2013 PCR) assays are more rapid, sensitive and specific to detect respiratory viruses compared with conventional techniques such as cell culture. in the Caribbean information on respiratory viral infections in childhood asthma is sparse. the study met compliance set out in the Helsinki Declaration. subjects with acute asthma exacerbations treated in the accidents and emergency departments of the eWMSC, the San Fernando General Hospital and the Arima Health Facility (AHF) were recruited through august 2002 to July 2005. nasal specimens were collected using a #5 Fr feeding tube attached to a 10 ml syringe. a maximum volume of 1 ml of sterile saline was administered to the subject's nostril. the fluid was then suctioned back into the syringe to obtain the washings of the nasal secretions. s on 2 detection panels (panels A6B and C3B) portrayed in Table 1. a 96-well assay is completed in approximately four hours. samples were assayed in duplicate with positive and negative controls. subjects with acute asthma exacerbations treated in the accidents and emergency departments of the eWMSC, the San Fernando General Hospital and the Arima Health Facility were recruited through august 2002 to July 2005. enrolled as they presented at the asthma paediatric clinic of the AHF where asthma education is offered to patients and their parents/guardians. nasal specimens were collected using a #5 Fr feeding tube attached to a 10 ml syringe. a maximum volume of 1 ml of sterile saline was administered to the subject's nostril. the fluid was then suctioned back into the syringe to obtain the washings of the nasal secretions. samples were assayed in duplicate with positive and negative controls for each panel of viral detection. chi square tests for independence used to compare differences in the average age between the groups. there was no age difference between acutely ill (8.0 years, SD = 3.5) and stable children (8.8 years, SD = 3.2) there was a significant (p = 0.018) difference between acute and stable asthmatics in relation to ethnic distribution. children of mixed ethnicity were more frequently stable than were Asian Indian children (n = 11, 35.5%) the rhinovirus was the most frequent and observed in 75% (18/24) of acute asthmatics. the likelihood of an acute asthmatic child being infected with RV was 4 times greater than in a stable asthmatic child. influenza B, coronavirus OC43 (1.4% (1) vs 2.5% (2)) were other common viral pathogens detected in acute and stable asthmatics respectively. virus 0.75 75.0 0.50 50.0 RSVA 0 0.0 0 0.0 RSV B 2 2.9 4 5.0 Influenza A 2 2.9 0 0.0 Influenza B 0 0.0 0 0.0 Coronavirus NL63 0 0.0 1 1.3 Coronavirus SARS 0 0.0 0 0.0 EV 1 1.4 2 2.5 PIV 1 1 1.4 0 0.0 PIV 3 0 0.0 hMPV 0 0.0 1 1.3 Adenovirus viral pathogens detected throughout the year were PIV2 (Dry, 2.6% (1)), PIV1 (Rainy, 15.9% (1) and RV (Dry, 15.8% (6);

LMPP conceived, designed, supervised and co-ordinated the study and prepared the final manuscript. JE and RFL were senior supervisors at the University of Wisconsin."}
