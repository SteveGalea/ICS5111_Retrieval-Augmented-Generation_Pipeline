{"summary": "rhinitis can be divided into allergic rhinitis (AR) and non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) in relation to non-allergic, non-infectious triggers. Approximately 10%\u201325% of the world population is affected by AR. asthma prevalence among children in many parts of the world is still increasing. study shows building dampness and molds are associated with increased respiratory infections in adults [19], [35], [42], [43]. air movements in buildings and ventilation are essential for transmission/spread of infectious diseases. aging population is an important issue in many countries [46]. there are only few studies investigating the influence of environment factors among respiratory health in the elderly. exposure to elevated levels of outdoor air pollution such as particle matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) were associated with increased hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) data on all multi-family buildings and their construction year were obtained from the central building register in Sweden. a random sampling was used to sample buildings based on the construction year in 5 classes (before 1960, 1960\u20131975, 1976\u20131985, 1986\u20131995 and 1996\u20132005) a dampness index was created based on question (15) and (17), which coded as: 0, both answers are \u201cno\u201d; 1, only one of the answers is \u201cno\u201d; 2, both answers are \u201cyes\u201d. a window-opening index was created based on two questions about window opening habit. the window-opening index was coded as: 0, if b) = 4; 1, if a) = 3 and b) = 3; 2, if a) = 2 and b) = 3, or a) = 1 b) = 3; 3, if a) = 2 and b) = 2; or a) = 2 and b) = 1; 4, if a) = 1 and b) = 2; 5, if a) = 1 and the variable daytime breathlessness was created from question (5) and (6) coded as \u201cno\u201d if the answers to both questions is \u201cno\u201d and \u201cyes\u201d if any one of the answers is \u201cyes\u201d. infection rhinitis was defined as having both current rhinitis and any respiratory infections in the last 3 months. rhinitis was defined as having current rhinitis, but no pollen or furry pet allergy and no respiratory infections. the prevalence of symptoms and exposures were calculated for total subjects and age stratified groups. the selection of multi-family buildings was performed by Statistics Sweden (SCB) [49]. the buildings were selected by a multi-stage sampling procedure with a first step to select 30 Swedish municipalities out of totally 290 municipalities across Sweden. adults participated in the study and returned the medical questionnaire (46%) and 4369 indoor environment questionnaires (49%) were returned. questions included number of persons living at home; Ownership of the apartment (own/rented); Type of ventilation system (mechanical ventilation system/only natural ventilation); Current pet-keeping status in the apartment. a dampness index was created based on question (15) and (17), which coded as: 0, both answers are \u201cno\u201d; 1, only one of the answers is \u201cno\u201d; 2, both answers are \u201cyes\u201d. a higher window-opening index indicate more window opening. the variable daytime breathlessness was created from question (5) and (6) coded as \u201cno\u201d if the answers to both questions is \u201cno\u201d and \u201cyes\u201d if any one of the answers is \u201cyes\u201d. the rhinitis variable was further classified into 4 categories: no rhinitis, infection rhinitis, allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis. all statistical analyses were conducted with STATA 11.0 (STATA Corp, Texas, USA) interaction was tested statistically if there were a marked numerical difference in OR when comparing occupational active age group with elderly. associations were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for ordinal regression and logistic regression models, associations were expressed as relative risk ratio (RRR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) the prevalence of current smoking, pollen allergy, furry pet allergy, current rhinitis, asthma attack, respiratory infections were lower among elderly. the prevalence of current smoking, pollen allergy, furry pet allergy, current rhinitis, asthma attack, respiratory infections were lower among elderly. 0.078 10.3 14.0 0.001 11.7 Night time breathlessness in the last 12 months 5.7 6.3 0.367 5.9 6.1 0.727 6.0 Current asthmaa 7.0 8.2 0.082 7.5 7.8 0.728 7.7 Asthma attack 3.1 3.8 0.171 3.9 2.7 0.016 3.5 Asthma medication 6.3 7.9 0.028 6.9 7.6 0.339 7.2 Respiratory infections in the last 3 months No infection 53.1 53.9 p valueg 65 years old n = 3637f (%) >65 years old n = 2089f (%) p valueg Total n = 5775 (%) Temperature zonea 1 2.6 2.7 0.967 2.5 2.8 0.016 2.6 2 11.0 11.1 10.1 12.6 11.0 3 52.6 51.9 53.2 50.4 52.1 4 33.9 34.4 34.2 34.1 34.3 Construction year -1960 12.9 12.1 0.017 13.6 10.5 0.001 1 2.6 2.7 0.799 3.2 1.5 0.001 2.7 Other odor in the last 12 months 8.2 8.7 0.611 9.2 7.2 0.026 8.5 Any dampness in the last 12 monthsb 15.0 14.4 0.536 16.4 11.4 0.001 14.7 Any dampness in the last 5 years 20.1 18.5 0.156 21.3 15.3 0.001 19.3 Consultant investigation for home dampness 15.4 13.9 0.177 15.8 12.4 0.003 14.5 Dampness indexc rhinitis was more common in those living in buildings constructed during 1976\u20131985 as compared to older buildings constructed before 1961. living in densely populated areas, living alone and living in rented apartments were associated with current rhinitis. 1.16(0.98,1.38) 1.15(0.94,1.41) 1.22(0.88,1.68) 1.25(0.98,1.60) 1.30(0.97,1.73) 1.03(0.63,1.67) Dampness indexb 0 1.00 1.00 1.00 1 1.10(0.94,1.28) 1.07(0.88,1.29) 1.32(1.05,1.67)* 0.67(0.46,0.98)* 2 1.26(1.04,1.53)* 1.19(0.88,1.60) 1.46(1.03,2.06)* it was more common in densely populated areas, among those living alone, those in rented apartments and in homes with window condensation in winter time. non-allergic rhinitis was more reported among those living in rented apartments and in homes with window condensation in winter time. population density was used as a categorical variable in this analysis. d Dampness index, number of \u201cyes\u201d answers to \u201cany dampness in the last 12 months\u201d and \u201cany dampness in the last 5 year\u201d: 0, answers were both \u201cno\u201d;
