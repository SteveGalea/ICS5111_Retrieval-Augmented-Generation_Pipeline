{"summary": "kinases catalyze the transfer of the phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a specific Ser, Thr, Tyr residue, is among the most thoroughly characterized PTM. kinases catalyze the transfer of the phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of a specific Ser, Thr, Tyr residue. kinases are the second most frequently targeted gene class in cancer therapy after the G protein coupled receptors. kinases are the second most frequently targeted gene class in cancer therapy after the G protein coupled receptors. kinase target motif peptides have been shown to be appropriate substrates for their respective kinases with Vmax and Km values approaching those of the full-length protein. kinome arrays can be constructed in an analogous manner to traditional DNA microarrays where kinase target motif peptides are spotted onto a glass slide representing hundreds to thousands of unique peptide targets for kinases. the development of kinome-specific bioinformatics cell lysates are activated with ATP and applied to the kinome peptide array. activated kinases in the cell lysate will recognize kinases and phosphorylate the central phosphorylated residue of the peptide. more than 8000 confirmed cases and 775 deaths have been reported since 2004. no additional cases have been reported since 2004. MERS-CoV has subsequently spread to 26 countries. cytokine levels in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from two MERS patients, one with fatal disease and one who survived. higher levels of retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and -7, interleukin (IL-12 and IFN) and lower levels of IL-12 and IFN were observed in the fatal case compared IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 were more prominent in groups II and III as compared to groups I and IV. elevated interferon gamma induced protein (IP)-10 correlated with the development of pneumonia (groups I\u2013III) study of MERS-CoV-infected marmosets evaluated lung lesions by RNaseq at days 3\u20136 postinfection. pathway analyses showed that chemotaxis and cell migration, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation and fibrogenesis were highly over-represented relative to uninfected controls. kinome analysis revealed selective modulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT (also known as protein kinase B)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling responses. kinase inhibitors targeting activated kinases in MERS-CoV infection impaired viral replication. ebolaviruses were first described in 1976 following disease outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan. ebolaviruses have a pleomorphic enveloped, filamentous virion particle that encapsulates a negative-sense single-stranded RNA genome. clinical findings in EVD EBOV transmission occur through exposure of infected body fluids or tissues to mucous membranes or nonintact skin. initial signs and symptoms are nonspecific including fever, myalgia, and malaise. most patients develop severe disease within days of symptom onset. serum cytokine concentrations (including IFN, IFN, TNF-, IL-2, and IL-4) were elevated in patients with fatal infections in comparison to survivors. additional studies have suggested fatal infections were instead related to general immunosuppression including IFN, IL-2, and IL-4. untreated animals showed up-regulation of immune response genes, B cell receptor signaling intermediates, NK cell mediated cytotoxicity, leukocyte activation, and lymphocyte activation. genes related to defense responses, apoptosis, wounding, inflammation, coagulation, and leukocyte activation remained elevated during early stages of infection. expression of multiple genes related to microbial sensing (pattern recognition receptors) or antiviral responses (ISGs) was up-regulated in the lungs of infected animals. comparison of NHP52 and porcine responses54 during EBOV infection showed multiple gene expression similarities between the two species. EBOV-mediated IFN inhibition is thought to be attributable to EBOV proteins VP24 and VP35.58. RESTV infection, which does not induce clinical illness in humans, resulted in the activation of >20% of the IFN-stimulated genes. a subset of kinase inhibitors administered to EBOV-infected mice reduced lethality. MPXV causes zoonotic infections with a case fatality rate of 11%.60 MPXV, vaccinia virus (VACV), cowpox virus (CPXV), ectromelia virus, and variola virus. human MPXV infection and illness largely mirror those of discrete, ordinary smallpox. incubation period for both viruses (VARV and MPXV) normally occurs 14\u201328 days postinfection. cytokines were analyzed from 19 patients with confirmed MPXV infections ranging from mild to severe. patients with serious disease had significantly higher concentrations of IL-2R serum levels than those with mild to severe MPXV disease. MPXV infection resulted in prominent T helper 2 (Th2) and dampened Th1 responses. alkhalil et al. investigated the host transcriptome responses to MPXV infection during the first cycle of viral replication (3 and 7 h postinfection) of rhesus macaque kidney epithelial cells. an investigation by Rubins et al. compared the temporal host transcriptome response to MPXV in multiple human cells targeted by MPXV. the trasncriptome of MPXV-infected fibroblasts was found to have the most significant changes where MPXV infection resulted in the depletion of 2000 genes by a factor of 3. the Congo Basin MPXV kinome data set clustered most strongly with the kinome data set from CPXV-infected monocytes. both CPXV and VACV can cause serious disease in humans. the pathway ORA of the kinome data demonstrated that Congo Basin MPXV infection resulted in strong down-regulation of a large proportion of host cell responses. multiple coronavirus family members, including OC43 and 229E, can be found across the globe. largely result in mild illness with more-severe illness limited to children and the elderly. there is increased interest in coronaviruses as global public health threats. laboratory abnormalities include lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine levels consistent with acute kidney injury. high lactate levels and consumptive coagulopathy have also been reported. patients with fatal disease had relative elevations of IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, IL-6, and IL-10 during the second and third weeks of illness. a robust induction of multiple chemokines was found in most patients. eotaxin and regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) was elevated in all patients. macaques revealed that genes related to antiviral immunity, chemotaxis, and inflammation were overexpressed in lesional versus grossly normal lung tissue at 3 days postinfection. significant changes in the transcriptome profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were observed at only day 1 postinfection. proteomics analysis corroborated these transcriptional data with induction of ISGs observed 18 h postinfection. significantly reduced levels of STAT1 and PKR compared with uninfected controls were also noted. nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFB)-regulated family members were important mediators of MERS-CoV infection. IL8- and IFN-mediated signalings were also modulated during MERS-CoV infection. soluble Immune Mediators Associated with MERS-CoV Infections Data characterizing immune responses during MERS-CoV infection are limited. the patients were subcategorized into four groups on the basis of disease severity: group I patients developed fever and recovered. a robust induction of multiple chemokines was found in most patients. eotaxin and regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) was elevated. IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-3 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 were more prominent in groups II and III as compared to groups I and IV. chemotaxis and cell migration, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation and fibrogenesis were highly over-represented relative to uninfected controls. differences were most significant on days 4 and 6 postinfection during illness progression relative to day 3. kinome analysis revealed selective modulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT (also known as protein kinase B)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling responses. kinase inhibitors targeting activated kinases in MERS-CoV infection impaired viral replication. ebolaviruses are composed of five viral species, including EBOV, SUDV, Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Ta Forest virus (TAFV) and Reston virus (RESTV) EBOV transmission occurs through exposure of infected body fluids or tissues to mucous membranes or nonintact skin. the mean incubation period is 6\u201310 days, ranging from 2 to 21 days. initial signs and symptoms are nonspecific including fever, myalgia, and malaise. a study of 42 fatally infected EVD patients by Wauquier et al. showed limited changes in the expression levels of cytokines, Fas antigen, and Fas ligand in PBMCs. however, broad changes were observed over days 4\u20136 post-infection relative to healthy controls. untreated animals showed up-regulation of immune response genes, B cell receptor signaling intermediates, NK cell mediated cytotoxicity, leukocyte activation, and lymphocyte activation. genes related to defense responses, apoptosis, wounding, inflammation, coagulation, and leukocyte activation remained elevated during early- and late-stage infection. expression of multiple genes related to microbial sensing (pattern recognition receptors) or antiviral responses (ISGs) was up-regulated in the lungs of infected animals. cytokine profiles of pigs, humans, and NHPs were quite similar. EBOV-mediated IFN inhibition is thought to be attributable to EBOV proteins VP24 and VP35.58. RESTV infection, which does not induce clinical illness in humans, resulted in the activation of >20% of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) kinase inhibitors reduced EBOV replication when administered prophylactically or therapeutically. a subset of kinase inhibitors administered to EBOV-infected mice reduced lethality. the mean incubation period is 6\u201310 days, from 2 to 21 days. study of 42 fatally infected EVD patients by Wauquier et al. showed limited changes in expression levels of cytokines, Fas antigen, and Fas ligand in PBMCs. no investigations of host gene expression in EBOV-infected patients have been reported. pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-) and chemokines (MIP-1 and MCP1\u20134) were up-regulated at days 4\u20136 postinfection relative to healthy controls. multiple genes related to apoptosis including multiple caspases, Fas-associated death domain protein, and TNF superfamily member 10 were also up-regulated at late time points. expression of multiple genes related to microbial sensing (pattern recognition receptors) or antiviral responses (ISGs) was up-regulated in the lungs of infected animals. cytokine profiles of pigs, humans, and NHPs were quite similar. entry into human macrophages in vitro induces pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- as early as 1 h postinfection. human autopsy data support that alveolar macrophages are a target of EBOV infection. RESTV infection, which does not induce clinical illness in humans, resulted in the activation of >20% of the IFN-stimulated genes. signaling pathways were up-regulated at 1 and 24 h post EBOV infection. these responses were associated with changes in expression patterns of multiple cellular proteins associated with a mesenchyme-like transition. these included up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9, N-cadherin, and fibronectin and down-regulation of E-cadhering. the Congo Basin MPXV (Central African MPXV) clade is considered to have higher lethality and morbidity than the west African MPXV clade. the rash period for both smallpox and MPXV (including lesion appearance and desquamation) normally occurs 14\u201328 days postinfection with highly similar appearance and distribution of lesions. a second febrile period occurs when the lesions become pustular. a second febrile period occurs when the lesions become pustular. a second febrile period occurs when the lesions become pustular. it is often associated with rash development but is absent in VARV infections. patients with serious MPXV disease had significantly higher IL-2R serum levels than those with mild to severe MPXV disease. GM-CSF levels were significantly elevated only in those with serious MPXV disease as compared to normal serum ranges. at 6 h post-MPXV infection, only 1.1% of the transcripts analyzed were found to have >2-fold changes in gene expression. the majority of these transcripts were up-regulated as compared to mock-infected controls. host kinome analysis was performed on Congo Basin and west africa MPXV-infected human monocytes. the kinome data set clustered most strongly with the kinome data set from CPXV-infected monocytes and moderately with the VACV-infected monocyte data set. both CPXV and VACV can cause serious disease in humans. CPXV and VACV demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of AKT resulted in decreased viral yields for both viruses. human MPXV infection and illness largely mirror those of discrete, ordinary smallpox. the incubation period for both viruses is 7\u201317 days with an initial febrile prodromal period of 1\u20134 days. cytokines were analyzed from 19 patients with confirmed MPXV infections ranging from mild to severe as assessed by the WHO smallpox lesion scoring system. patients with serious MPXV disease had significantly higher concentrations of IL-10 compared to other disease groups. alkhalil et al. investigated host transcriptome responses to MPXV infection. of the transcripts that met the authors\u2019 criteria for significance, 89% of the transcripts were found to be down-regulated at both postinfection time points. the trasncriptome of MPXV-infected fibroblasts was found to have the most significant changes where MPXV infection resulted in the depletion of 2000 genes by a factor of 3. inactivated MPXV resulted in strong up-regulation of innate immune responses in all of the cell types tested. XV kinome data set clustered most strongly with the kinome data set from CPXV-infected monocytes and moderately with the VACV-infected monocyte data set. kinome data also suggested that AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 was increased in Congo Basin MPXV-infected cells as compared to West African MPXV-infected cells. global analyses of host molecular responses can provide considerable insight into complex molecular events that underlie cellular responses. kinase-mediated regulation of cell signaling pathways has remained poorly understood. kinomics also provides a mechanism for identification of novel therapeutic targets based on the direct assessment of the activation state of cell signaling pathways. kinome analysis may also facilitate the identification of immunomodulatory therapeutics that have gained licensure. kinase inhibitors may serve as primary or adjunctive therapies for emerging infectious diseases. preclinical data and the increasing number of kinase inhibitors suggest this approach is feasible and efficacious. kinase inhibitor host target impact of inhibitor on viral replication considered to be >40% inhibition. target impact of inhibitor on animal survival reference MERS-CoV Rapamycin mTOR in vitro reduction in viral replication. inib, PP2 Src family kinases no significant inhibition of viral replication no data available (37) Bay 11-7082 IKB no significant inhibition of viral replication no data available (37) PKC-412 PKC no significant inhibition of viral replication no data available (37) AG490 EGFR; ERBB2 no significant inhibition of viral replication no data available (37) EBOV AG879 ErbB2 and FLK-1 (VEGF receptor) in vitro reduction in viral replication with prophyl Tyrphostin tyrosine kinases in vitro inhibition of vsv-ebov pseudotype transduction with prophylatic treatment no data available (80) KN-93 CAMK2 in vitro reduction in infectivity no data available (79) U0126 MEK1, MEK2 in vitro reduction in viral replication with therapeutic treatment no data available (81) Imatinib c-Abl1 family in vitro reduction in viral replication with therapeutic treatment no data no data available (70) BML-257 Akt in vitro reduction in viral replication with prophylatic treatment (Congo Basin clades only) no data available (70) Akt-X Akt in vitro reduction in viral replication with prophylatic treatment (Congo Basin clades only) no data available (70) nutlin 3 MDM-2 no significant inhibition of viral replication (70) the results from such analyses may inform the selection of appropriate animal models that meet regulatory approval through the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule. kinomics-based analyses of host responses provide a mechanism to directly address the cellular events at the level of specific cell signaling phenomena that underlie the biological responses."}
