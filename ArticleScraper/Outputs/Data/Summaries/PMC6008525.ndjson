{"summary": "recent outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses have heightened the public's awareness about the close and complex interrelationship between the health of humans, wildlife species, and domestic animals. tuberculosis (TB) is one such disease that continues to have devastating consequences for not only humans, but also cattle and several wildlife species (2\u20135) a cross-sectorial and multidisciplinary approach linking animal, human, and environmental health is required. a cross-sectorial and multidisciplinary approach linking animal, human, and environmental health is required. we discuss and emphasize the importance of integrated approaches to be able to accomplish the short (year 2020) and medium term (year 2025) goals outlined in the ZTB roadmap. at the 2010 conference in Berlin, Germany, there was only one ZTB session (symposium) attended by less than 10 people. the activities at the annual conference have increased to two scientific symposia, one poster session, one meet the expert session, press releases, and a keynote talk on ZTB at the plenary session in south Africa. a constellation of events has occurred to bring ZTB to the awareness of scientists, policymakers, government officials and the general public. the strategy aims to end, rather than merely control, the global TB epidemic, with targets to reduce TB deaths by 95% and reduce new cases by 90% between 2015 and 2035. 2030 encompassing 17 broad and comprehensive topics, ranging from elimination of poverty and hunger, improved education and gender equality, to clean water and energy. TB highlighted as one of the priorities, thus presenting a key opportunity to improve the health of communities affected by ZTB. the alliance seeks to enhance collaboration within its members and institutions. the 10 priorities proposed for the ZTB roadmap were endorsed by the STAG. a former ZTB survivor from the Masaai community in Kenya shared with the scientific community the challenges she faced while suffering from this disease. the Zoonotic TB Roadmap (13) outlines 10 priorities to address the existing challenges posed by ZTB. it is divided into three major core themes: 1) Improve scientific evidence, 2) Reduce transmission at the animal-human interface, and (3) Strengthen intersectoral and collaborative approaches. the roadmap highlights the need of implementing integrated approaches to disease monitoring linking animal and public health. the short (year 2020) and medium term (year 2025) milestones to be accomplished are outlined under the three core themes of the ZTB Roadmap (13) the key elements toward accomplishing these goals are that the unique cultural and socioeconomic factors that shape the relationship between people, livestock, and wildlife species must be taken into account. the availability of improved diagnostic tools for ZTB in different species, as well as the implementation of disease monitoring, surveillance, and prevention strategies in livestock and wildlife species will be a crucial component. the zoonotic TB sub-section is a global network of physicians, veterinarians, researchers, economists and social anthropologists. it is a global network of physicians, veterinarians, researchers, economists and social anthropologists that works to understand the dynamics of ZTB. at the 2010 conference in Berlin, Germany, there was only one ZTB session (symposium) attended by less than 10 people. the activities have increased to two scientific symposia, one poster session, one meet the expert session, press releases, and a keynote talk on ZTB at the plenary session in south Africa during the 2015 conference. a constellation of events has occurred to bring ZTB to the awareness of scientists, policymakers, government officials and the general public. the new post-2015 global TB strategy aims to end, rather than merely control, the global TB epidemic. it sets interim milestones for 2020, 2025, and 2030 (16) TB highlighted as one of the priorities, thus presenting a key opportunity to improve the health of communities affected by ZTB. the global plan includes actions needed to decrease TB, and is in full support of WHO's End TB Strategy. the alliance seeks not only to enhance collaboration within its members and institutions, but also with the broader human and animal TB research community. the 10 priorities proposed for the ZTB roadmap were endorsed by the STAG. a working group was created and tasked to produce and publish a ZTB Roadmap during 2017. a veterinarian and former ZTB patient/survivor shared his experience and challenges of initial misdiagnosis, extrapulmonary (pleural) TB, drug resistance to isoniazid, and the longer treatment required while battling ZTB in the year 2013. both patients emphasized the need of more awareness among the medical community to better diagnose and treat ZTB patients. point 9 in the roadmap under core theme 3 specifically highlights the need of implementing integrated approaches to disease monitoring linking animal and public health. sharing of human resources, equipment and transport across sectors can reduce operational costs. this increased cost-effectiveness is especially relevant given the public funding constraints that often exist in settings where people are most at risk of zoonotic TB. outreach childhood immunization campaigns could be used to deliver educational and behavior change messages about food safety, to test livestock for bovine TB or to implement livestock vaccination campaigns against bovine TB. interventions must be tailored to the cultural and socioeconomic characteristics of each setting. there is still much work to be done to implement the actions needed to improve the prevention, diagnosis, control and treatment of ZTB. timeline for action and milestones to be achieved in the short (2020) and medium term (2025) outlines in the ZTB Roadmap (13) Improve scientific evidence base Reduce transmission at the animal-human interface Strengthen intersectoral and collaborative approaches MILESTONES TO BE ACHIEVED BY YEAR 2020 Joint guidance developed for surveillance and management of zoonotic and bovine TB. the achievement of this milestone in the fight against TB was the vision of a world free of TB. this collaboration has opened new doors and opportunities as the world fights to end TB. authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication."}
