{"summary": "RD cells stably expressing a C-terminal fragment of Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) were maintained in dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing G418 at 1 mg/mL. monocyte-enriched cells were cultured in X-Vivo 10 medium (Lonza) retroviral vectors used for expression of IFITM proteins have been described elsewhere. rhesus macaque IFITM homologues, IFITM1 (XM_001085444.2), IFITM3(1) (XM_001085567.2), and IFITM3(2) (XM_001085331.2) were amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from complementary DNAs. sequences encoding previously described N- and C-terminal fragments of human codon-optimized GLuc [28] were synthesized. the fragment encoding the N-terminal portion of Gluc (GlucN), lacking a signal peptide, was fused to the C-terminus of EBOV VP40, lacking a stop codon. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding either luciferase or IFITM proteins or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as a control. supernatants harvested at 48 hours after transfection. IFITM expression in 293T cells transfected to express IFITM proteins was assessed as a control. plasmids encoding the viral envelope protein and GLucN/VP40 were cotransfected into 293T cells using transIT-2020 (Mirus) cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the viral envelope protein and GLucN/VP40. the cells were seeded into 96-well plates, incubated for 24 hours. then spin-infected [29] for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C followed by incubation for 16 hours at 37\u00b0C. the activity in cell lysates was measured using a commercial kit (Pierce) pQCXIP vectors encoding human and rhesus macaque IFITM proteins with a C-terminal myc tag were generated by PCR using myc-encoding primers. differentiation into MDMs was controlled by flow cytometric analysis. pQCXIP-CFP-IFITM1 was amplified from pSCFP3A-C1-IFITM1. the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-IFITM sequence was inserted into pQCXIP. pQCXIP-CFP-IFITM2 and 3 have been generated by subcloning IFITM genes from pQCXIP-IFITM plasmids. IFITM proteins equipped with a C-terminal myc tag were detected using the monoclonal anti-actin antibody 9E10. expression of -actin was detected with mouse monoclonal anti\u2013actin antibody (1:1000, Sigma) to detect STAT1 expression and phosphorylation, a polyclonal rabbit anti-STAT1/ antibody and a polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-STAT1 antibody were used. the adherent cells were transduced with IFITM-encoding vectors. the cells were inoculated with 50 l of luciferase-normalized vectors. luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured 72 hours after transduction. plasmids encoding the viral envelope protein and GLucN/VP40 were cotransfected into 293T cells employing TransIT-2020 (Mirus) the cells were seeded into 96-well plates, incubated for 24 hours, then spin-infected [29] for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation for 16 hours at 37\u00b0C. 293T cells transduced to express human IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Cat) were subsequently transduced with vectors bearing the indicated viral entry proteins. expression of IFITM proteins had no appreciable impact on transduction mediated by filovirus GPs. transduction of cat-expressing cells (control) was set as 100%. expression of rhesus macaque IFITM proteins was readily detectable. expression of rhesus macaque IFITM proteins was readily detectable. IFITM proteins of human and rhesus macaque origin can block entry driven by GPs from diverse ebola- and marburgviruses in cell culture. treatment of MDMs with IFN- and IFN- induced phosphorylation of STAT1 within 1 hour. phosphorylated STAT1 was still detectable 24 hours after treatment with IFN-. 293T cells were transfected with empty plasmids for IFITM1\u20133. amphotericin B did not rescue EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry from inhibition by IFITM proteins. transduction of control cells was set as 100%. a similar inhibition of EBOV- and LLOV-GP\u2013driven entry was observed. transduction of control cells was set as 100%. similar results were obtained when 293T cells transfected to express IFITM3. SVKS in IFITM3 abrogated the blockade of EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry. expression of this protein also increased EBOV-GP\u2013dependent entry. alteration of this motif can transform IFITM3 from an antiviral into a proviral factor. 293T cells transduced to express IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 as a control were preincubated with medium alone (control), 1:500 diluted rabbit preimmune serum, or 1:500 diluted rabbit anti\u2013EBOV-GP antiserum for 30 minutes. expression of IFITM3 and GP-specific antibodies might synergistically inhibit GP-driven entry. expression of IFITM proteins had no appreciable impact on transduction mediated by filovirus GPs. entry driven by all EBOV-GPs tested and by MARV-GP was inhibited by IFITM proteins. transduction of Cat-expressing cells was set as 100%. the rhesus macaque genome does not encode IFITM2 [31] but encodes two variants of IFITM3, IFITM3(1) and IFITM3(2). expression of IFITM3(1) was reduced compared with that of IFITM3(2). treatment of MDMs with IFN- and IFN- induced phosphorylation of STAT1 within 1 hour. expression of IFITM1 was modestly increased upon treatment with IFN-. expression of IFITM1 was modestly increased upon treatment with IFN-. both IFNs robustly induced expression of IFITM2/3. amphotericin B does not rescue EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry from inhibition by IFITM proteins. amphotericin B did not modulate EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry. luciferase-encoding murine leukemia virus particles. Mutation of an SVKS Motif in IFITM3 Augments LLOV-GP\u2013Driven Entry was detected in dead Schreiber's bats in Spain [9]. similar inhibition of EBOV- and LLOV-GP\u2013driven transduction was observed upon expression of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3. this assay faithfully reproduces standard responses of authentic EBOV to entry inhibitors. luciferase (GLucC) cells transduced to express human IFITM 3 or Cat as control were spin-infected with VP40/N-terminal portion of GLuc virus-like particles (VLPs bearing the indicated GPs) luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined. SVKS motif is required for inhibition of EBOV-GP\u2013 and LLOV-GP\u2013facilitated entry. alteration of this motif can transform IFITM3 from an antiviral into a proviral factor. antiserum modestly inhibited EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry into control cells. 293T cells transduced to express IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 as a control were transduced with vectors bearing the indicated GPs. the mean for 2 (Lassa virus [LASV]\u2013GPC) or 4 (EBOV-GP and influenza A virus [FLUAV] hemagglutinin [HA] experiments is shown. EBOV-GP was rescued by amphotericin B treatment. neutralizing antibodies and IFITM proteins can synergistically inhibit EBOV-GP entry. rhesus macaque IFITM proteins may constitute panfiloviral defense in infected host. a study by amini-Bavil-Olyaee and colleagues [16] suggested that IFITM proteins might inhibit endosomal entry of enveloped viruses by inducing cholesterol accumulation in the endosomal membrane. however, subsequent work challenged this concept and reduction of endosomal cholesterol levels did not rescue EBOV-GP\u2013driven entry from blockade by IFITM proteins in the present study. coronavirus OC43 can use IFITM proteins as cofactors for infectious viral entry into target cells [41]. the GP of ebolaviruses is the sole target for neutralizing antibodies, which can efficiently inhibit viral spread in the infected host when applied as postexposure prophylaxis.
