{"summary": "viruses encode virulence factors that induce a substantial alteration of host cell functions and genetic programs. specific viral factors stimulate survival pathways to prevent apoptosis of infected cells or inhibit cell signaling involved in immune response. sendai virus and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 are animal counterparts of hPIV1 and hPIV3 that infect mouse and cattle. hPIV3 infection is also suspected to exacerbate chronic airway inflammatory diseases like asthma. overlapping ORF embedded in the first half of the P mRNA allows expression of a single C protein (hPIV3 and bPIV3) or a nested set of four proteins called C\u2032, C, Y1 and Y2 (Sendai virus and hPIV1) the C proteins of Sendai virus and hPIV1 have a high degree of sequence homology and have been studied in details. co-transcriptional insertion of five G residues at the editing site leads to the expression of a chimeric protein called D. two stop codons immediately downstream of the editing site prevent the expression of the protein V that is specific of Paramyxoviridae. the protein C is encoded by an overlapping opened reading frame embedded in P mRNA. growth factor binding to RTKs regulates a multiplicity of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and survival. excessive activation of this pathway could benefit to virus replication by inhibiting IFN-/ signaling. the screen was performed at saturation with a 10-fold coverage of the library. positive yeast colonies were analyzed by PCR and sequencing to identify binding partners of hPIV3-C. hPIV3-C has opposite effects on IFN-/ and EGF signaling pathways The adaptor. protein GRB2 plays a critical role in coupling signal from growth factor receptors to MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. in this system, Elk1 transcription factor is fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4-DB) and binds the promoter sequence of a luciferase reporter gene. in this system, Elk1 is activated as assessed by a significant increase in luciferase expression. la, BEAS-2B and A549 cells are more difficult to transfect than HEK-293T. hPIV3-C effectively blocked IFN-/ signaling as opposed to what we observed for the EGF pathway. hPIV3-C enhances cellular response to EGF. HEK-293T cells were infected with hPIV3 (MOI = 3) and then transfected with pFA2-Elk1, pGal4-UAS-Luc, pRL-CMV vectors. 12 h later, cells were starved during 6 h and stimulated with EGF at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. hPIV3-C expression level was determined by western blot analysis. none hPIV3-C hPIV3-C Nipah-C HEK-293T 1 1.10.2 6.30.2 (p = 0.0005) 1.40.2 Hela 1 1.10.02 2.40.07. infection of HEK-293T cells was confirmed by anti-hPIV3 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (hPIV3-HN) immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis. hPIV3 infection induced a significant level of Elk1 activity. this suggests that in addition to hPIV3-C interaction with GRB2, other mechanisms modulate MAPK/ERK pathway during hPIV3 infection. HEK-293T cells were either transfected with an expression vector encoding 3FLAG-tagged hPIV3-C (A, B) or infected with hPIV3 (MOI = 3) (C, D) after 24 h, cells were starved for 12 h, then stimulated with 100 ng/ml of EGF. hPIV3 infection was confirmed by anti-hPIV3 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase immunoblotting (D) we then determined the phosphorylation level of two downstream targets of this pathway that are involved in the control of mRNA translation, the translation initiation factor eIF4E and the ribosomal protein S6. the same profile was observed when eIF4E and S6 phosphorylation levels were analyzed in infected HEK-293T cells. hPIV3 infection also induces low levels of eIF4E and S6 phosphorylation in the absence of EGF stimulation. this could relate to the fact that hPIV3 infection also induces low levels of eIF4E and S6 phosphorylation in the absence of EGF stimulation. HEK-293T cells were left untreated (A and B) or treated with 20 M of U0126 (C) for 2 h. expression of hPIV3-HN was quantified by immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis. hPIV3-HN expression (thick line) is shown for each experiment. a 106 AA peptide encompassing residues 90 to 195 of hPIV3-C was sufficient to bind STAT1 or GRB2. the binding region to GRB2 was virtually the same, encompassing AA 97 to 195. the first iteration identified a GRB2 binding region of 124 AA. after two (B), three (C) and four additional rounds (D), this domain was finally reduced to a minimal GRB2 binding motif of 99 AA. this binding domain, encompassing position 97 to 195, is contained in the STAT1 binding region of hPIV3-C previously identified in Figure 5. interactions with STAT1 and GRB2 bind to the same region of hPIV3-C. AA 90-195 of hPIV-3 include both STAT1 and GRB2 binding sites. hPIV3 is highly conserved at their C-terminus. HEK-293T cells were expressed together with 600 ng/well (line 3\u20134; \u201c++\u201d) or 150 ng/well (line 5\u20136; \u201c+\u201d) of 3-FLAG-tagged STAT1 and/or 3-FLAG-tagged GRB2 (line 2, 3 and 5; 600 ng/well) total cell lysates were prepared 48 h post transfection (cell lysate; middle and lower panels), and co-purification of 3-FLAG-tagged proteins was as reporter gene expression was determined 24 h post transfection. hPIV3-C, hPIV3-C90-195 or hPIV3-C1-89 were stimulated 24 h later. both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of hPIV3-C are required to block IFN-/ signaling, even if only the C-terminal region is required for binding to STAT1. cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding full-length hPIV3-C (CFL) or fragments. 12 h later, cells were starved during 6 h and stimulated with EGF at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. hPIV3-C90-195 and hPIV3-C1-89 were expressed in fusion downstream of the red fluorescent protein Cherry. cherry alone or fused to hPIV3-C90-195 localized both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of transfected cells. hPIV3-C essentially accumulated at the cellular membrane whereas hPIV3-C1-89 was in the nucleus. binding to STAT1 suggests that STAT1 is a specific cellular interactor of Respirovirus C proteins. hPIV3-C has opposite effects on IFN-/ and EGF signaling pathways. expression levels of hPIV3-C, MV-C and Nipah-C were similar in this system. the effect of hPIV3-C in these different cell lines was highly significant. this is probably because our reporter system requires the co-transfection of four plasmids. firefly luciferase reporter gene downstream of promoter sequence. cells were co-transfected with expression vector encoding 3FLAG-tagged MV-C, hPIV3-C or Nipah-C or empty vector pCI-neo-3FLAG. 12 h after transfection, cells were starved and 6 h later EGF was added. HEK-293T cells were transfected to express 3FLAG-tagged MV-C, hPIV3-C or Nipah-C as described in (A) and (B) hPIV3-C expression levels were determined 36 h later by western blot analysis. cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding 3FLAG-tagged MV-C, hPIV3-C or Nipah-C or the corresponding empty vector pCI-neo-3FLAG. 12 h after transfection, cells were starved and stimulated 6 h later with 100 ng/ml of EGF. hPIV3-C is acting through ERK1/2 stimulation. hPIV3-C interaction with GRB2 enhances cellular response to growth factors as assessed by increased activation of MAPK/ERK pathway. hPIV3-C interaction with GRB2 enhances cellular response to growth factors. phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, eIF4E and S6 were determined at 30 min, 2 h, 6 h and 24 h after stimulation. expression of 3FLAG-tagged hPIV3-C in transfected cells was detected by anti-3FLAG immunoblotting (B) before EGF stimulation, low levels of phosphorylated eIF4E and S6 were detectable in mock-treated cells. hPIV3 infection or hPIV3-C expression alone enhance ERK1/2 phosphorylation at peak of induction, i.e. 10 min after adding EGF to the cells. hPIV3 infection of HEK-293T cells also enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation but the induction profile was different. hPIV3 cells were treated for 2 h with MAPK/ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 and infected with hPIV3 (MOI = 1). two days after infection, cell surface expression of hPIV3-HN was detected by immunostaining and flow cytometry. both forward and reverse primers were designed every 75 nucleotides along hPIV3-C sequence. both forward and reverse primers were fused to appropriate tails to allow gap-repair recombination. corresponding PCR products were transformed in a yeast strain expressing Gal4-AD fused to either STAT1 or GRB2. Yeast cells were grown on selective medium lacking histidine. they were supplemented with 10 mM of 3-amino-triazole (3-AT) to test the interaction-dependent transactivation of HIS3 reporter gene. vertical and horizontal axes indicate first and last AA residues of each fragment tested, respectively. GST-tagged hPIV3-C90-195 was expressed together with 3-FLAG-tagged STAT1 or GRB2. hPIV3-C90-195 interacted with STAT1 and GRB2 as efficiently as full-length hPIV3-C. interaction with STAT1 was weaker suggesting that more residues contribute to the stabilization of this interaction. HEK-293T cells were transfected to co-express GST fused to full-length hPIV3-C or fragments and 3FLAG-tagged STAT1 (B) or GRB2 (C) total cell lysates were prepared 48 h post transfection (cell lysate; middle and lower panels), and co-purifications of 3-FLAG-tagged proteins was assayed by GST pull-down (upper panel). hPIV3-C interaction with hPIV3-C was not affected by STAT1 expression. both the N- and C-terminal domains of hPIV3-C are required for its activity. hPIV3-C90-195 cells were transfected with 3FLAG-tagged hPIV3-C. hPIV3-C90-195 and hPIV3-C1-89 were tested for their ability to modulate IFN-/ or EGF signaling. HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding full-length hPIV3-C (CFL) or fragments. 24 h after transfection, 1000 IU/ml of recombinant IFN- were added. length hPIV3-C, hPIV3-C90-195 or hPIV3-C1-89 was expressed in fusion downstream of the red fluorescent protein Cherry. hPIV3-C, hPIV3-C90-195 and hPIV3-C1-89 were expressed in fusion downstream of the red fluorescent protein Cherry. overlapping reading frames embedded within the gene P. Rubulaviruses express V proteins that target STAT1 and/or STAT2. Morbilliviruses and Henipaviruses also encode for C proteins of which role in the inhibition of IFN-/ response has been a matter of debates [34]\u2013[37]. hPIV3-C interacts directly with GRB2 and enhances MAPK/ERK signaling downstream of EGF receptor. this pathway has been known for decades as a prime target of DNA tumor viruses and oncogenic retroviruses. but recent data show that non-oncogenic RNA viruses also activate this signaling cascade to support viral replication and spreading. hPIV3 infection also activates MAPK/ERK pathway in the absence of external stimuli. expression of this virulence factor enhances MAPK/ERK activation above normal level in infected cells, thereby contributing to viral replication and pathogenesis. induction of MAPK/ERK pathway by RNA viruses has numerous consequences on cell biology. inflammatory airway diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway with U0126 or PD098059 deeply impairs replication of numerous RNA viruses including hRSV. hPIV3 protein expression in infected cells as assessed by hPIV3-HN detection. phosphorylation event is dependent on eIF4G-associated MAPK signal-integrating kinases, Mnk1 and Mnk2. eIF4E is believed to be the least abundant of all initiation factors. hPIV3 mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated like host counterparts. hPIV3-C interaction with mutants STAT1 and GRB2 exhibiting SH2 domains disabled for the interaction with phosphotyrosine residues. these mutants were not affected for the interaction with hPIV3-C. this suggests that hPIV3-C either binds distinct regions of STAT1 and GRB2 or interacts with a region of the SH2 domain that does not involve the phosphotyrosine binding site. hPIV3-C interaction with STAT1 and GRB2 represents a potential target for the development of antiviral molecules against hPIV3 and possibly other members of Respirovirus genus.
