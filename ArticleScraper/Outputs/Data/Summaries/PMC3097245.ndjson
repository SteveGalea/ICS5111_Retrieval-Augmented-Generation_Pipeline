{"summary": "tuberculous pleurisy (TBP) is the second most frequent manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis after lymph node TB. TBP resolves spontaneously in some patients without treatment. it is well recognized that cell-mediated immunity is required for an effective response to mycobacterium tuberculosis. expression of CD40L (CD154) can be used to detect Th cells that are specific for defined antigens. expression of CD40L is expressed by antigen-specific T cells following activation. it could provide costimulatory signals to APCs (antigen-presenting cells) expression of CD40L by CD4+ T cells was induced in PFCs. no detectable expression of CD40L was observed following either antigen-specific or polyclonal stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. expression of CD40L predominantly restricted to CD4+ T cells. significantly higher levels of Th1 cytokines were found to be expressed by CD4+CD40L+ T cells. we also measured the expression of Th2 cytokines and found that little to no IL-4 or IL-10 is induced following stimulation with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides. 4+CD40L+ but not CD4+CD40L+ T cells express IFN-, IL-2, TNF-, IL-17 or IL-22. results shown are the mean SEM from 12 to 21 independent experiments. IFN-/IL-2/TNF- triple expressers, IFN-/IL-2, IFN-/TNF- or TNF-/IL-2 double expressers. polyfunctional T cells that simultaneously produce IFN-, IL-2 and TNF- were found to dominate the CD4+CD40L+ T cells. the total antigen response within CD4+CD40L+ T cells was defined as the number of cells expressing any combination of IFN-, IL-2 or TNF-. the average percentages for each subset are shown. CD4+CD40L+ T cells are mostly effector or effector memory cells. PFCs were stimulated with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides, anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d mAbs. CD4+CD40L+ and CD4+CD40L T cells were gated. expression of activation markers CD69, CD25, HLA-DR and ICOS. significantly higher levels of IFN-, IL-2 and TNF- were detected in the supernatants of CD4+CD40L+ fractions than in those of CD4+CD40L. we also assessed the levels of IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 and IL-22 in culture supernatants. IL-21, as well as the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10, was not detectable in our co-culture system. the amounts of IFN-, IL-2, TNF-, IL-17 and IL-22 were measured supernatants were measured using ELISA. we first investigated the specificity of CD40L expression by CD4+ T cells. unstimulated cells do not express CD40L. erculous pleurisy (TBP) and PBMCs from healthy donors were incubated for eight hours in the presence of medium alone. expression of CD40L on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in PFCs from TBP and (B) PBMCs from healthy donors was detected by FACS. CD4+CD40L+ cells were found to produce significantly higher amounts of IL-17 and IL-22 than CD4+CD40L T cells. however, the cytokine level was considerably lower than in Th1-cytokine-producing cells. 4+CD40L+ T cells are dominated by polyfunctional Th1 cells. cells that express at least one Th1 cytokine (IFN-, IL-2 or TNF-) are mostly CD40L+. cells that do not express any of the measured Th1 cytokines are mostly CD40L+. CD4+CD40L+ T cells express polyfunctional cytokines. PFCs were stimulated with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides. anti-IFN-, anti-IL-2 and anti-TNF- monoclonal antibodies were labeled. CD4+CD40L+ T cells were found to be predominantly CD45RO+CD45RA. CD4+CD40L+ T cells express significantly lower levels of CD62L and CCR7 than CD4+CD40L T cells. ICOS was found to be expressed in a small amount of CD4+CD40L+ T cells but not in CD4+CD40L+ cells. PFCs were stimulated with a fluorescently labeled anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody and monensin. CD4+ T cells and CD14+ cells were purified with a positive microbead selection. CD4+CD40L+ and CD4+CD40L T cells were then isolated using flow cytometry. can be used to identify the vast majority of MTB-specific Th1, Th17 and Th22 cells. CD4+T cells were first isolated with magnetic-beads. expression of CD40L within purified CD4+ T cells was demonstrated. T cell IFN- release assays are more specific and sensitive diagnostic tools for MTB infection than the tuberculin skin test (TST) [26], [27], [28] TIGRA measures IFN- production by mononuclear cells following stimulation with restricted antigens that are absent from BCG or most non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) +CD40L+ cells were found to highly express IL-17 and IL-22 compared with CD4+CD40L T cells. we also assessed the expression of CD40L and IFN- by PFCs. CD4+ T cells did not express either IFN- or CD40L in response to SARS-CoV peptide. CD40L cannot be replaced by other activation markers to evaluate antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. these markers lack specificity, as they are also known to be expressed by specialized T cell subsets (regulatory T cells) and induced by cytokines [34], [35], [36]. urisy (10 females and 12 males, 23\u201371 years old) were recruited from the Chest Hospital of Guangzhou, China. the diagnosis of pleural effusion from TB etiology was based on criteria. purified anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2) and anti-CD49d (clone 9F10) mAbs were purchased from BD Biosciences. mAbs were used for phenotypic, intracellular cytokine or transcription factor analyses. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation of heparinized venous blood obtained from healthy individuals or TB patients. cells were incubated with 1 g/mL peptides plus 1 g/mL anti-CD28 and 1 g/mL anti-CD49d. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) data were analyzed using a FlowJo software (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA) a value of p0.05 was considered statistically significant. twenty-two patients with tuberculous pleurisy were recruited from the Chest Hospital of Guangzhou, China. Purified anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2) and anti-CD49d (clone 9F10) mAbs were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA) mAbs were used for phenotypic, intracellular cytokine or transcription factor analyses. purified anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs were purchased from BD Bioscience. cells were incubated with 1 g/mL peptides plus 1 g/mL anti-CD28 and 1 g/mL anti-CD49d for 8 h. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) data were analyzed using a FlowJo software (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA) purified CD4+CD40L+ or CD4+CD40L T cells were co-cultured with purified CD14+ cells. IL-2, TNF-, IL-4 and IL-10 were purchased from BD Bioscience Pharmingen. the ELISA kit for IL-22 was purchased from eBioscience."}
