{"summary": "pathogen evolution, co-infection, and behavioural changes have been proposed as possible mechanisms for the occurrence of subsequent outbreaks. results We develop mean-field and stochastic epidemiological models for disease transmission. behavioural changes (e.g., change in number of contacts due to modified behaviour of susceptible individuals) have been shown to affect the course of infection events and produce subsequent outbreaks in an epidemic episode [9] behavioural changes have been shown to affect the course of infection events and produce subsequent outbreaks in an epidemic episode. we develop mean-field and stochastic epidemiological models that describe transmission dynamics of a disease in the population. they incorporate treatment and isolation of infected cases as control measures. we compare the results obtained by simulating the mean-field model with those observed in the stochastic model. Figure 1 shows the movements of individuals between these classes during the course of an epidemic. the dynamics of the mean-field model can be mathematically expressed by following system of differential equations. in the absence of treatment and isolation, Rc reduces to the basic reproduction number of the sensitive and resistant infections. the spread of disease caused by the sensitive pathogen cannot be controlled if R0 exceeds the threshold R* = ( + )/T q, which results in p* > 1. treatment is assumed to reduce transmissibility of the drug-sensitive infection, but remains ineffective against drug-resistant infection. we also assume that the recovery from infection confers immunity to re-infection with either drug-sensitive or resistant pathogens. for a given value of R0, the baseline transmission rate can be calculated using the expression R0 = S0/. the value p* is given by However, the spread of disease caused by the sensitive pathogen cannot be controlled if R0 exceeds the threshold R* = ( + )/T q, which results in p* > 1. the value of can be expressed as which highlights the importance of isolation for controlling the spread of resistant infection. we considered influenza infection as a case study, for which emergence and spread of drug-resistance during an outbreak can result from treatment of infected individuals. a large scale use of treatment suppresses the spread of the sensitive infection quickly, but leads to the emergence and spread of resistance that causes the first wave of infection. a second wave of infection follows as a result of wide-spread resistance (red curves), which declines once a sizable portion of the susceptible population is infected. this level of susceptibility may still be above the threshold required for disease containment. in this scenario, run-out occurs before epidemic is contained. the second wave that occurs after the treatment capacity is fully dispensed leads to a major reduction in susceptibility of the population. this leads to a major reduction in susceptibility of the population; thereby ending the epidemic. a second wave of infection takes place in the mean-field model with a larger magnitude compared to the first outbreak. black and red curves correspond respectively to the sensitive (untreated and treated: I + I) and resistant (untreated and treated: Ir + IT,r) infections. the global mobilization with rapid international transportation makes the impact of such diseases even more dramatic with potential socioeconomic upheaval. this was recognized in 2003 with the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as the first major infectious disease threat of the 21st century [21]. studies have attempted to provide explanatory theories for these events in a single epidemic course. in this study, we developed mean-field and stochastic models to investigate possible causes of sequential outbreaks from a public health perspective. we also observed differences in their predictions in terms of the speed with which disease spreads through the population. study highlights possible mechanisms for the occurrence of multiple infection waves in a single epidemic. future research should address some limitations of the present study. understanding the interplay between intervention parameters, evolutionary responses of the pathogens, and epidemic dynamics remains a critical objective of public health. t represents changes that occur to the random vector at t units of time. the function describes the status of an individual in a subpopulation. t is sufficiently small, so that at most one change of status can occur during the time interval t. t) + 1 (I \u2013 p)EE(t) + o(t) recovery from untreated resistant infection Ir(t) Ir(t) + 1 (I \u2013 p)EE(t) + o(t) recovery from untreated resistant infection Ir(t) Ir(t) + 1 (I \u2013 p)EE(t) + o(t) recovery from untreated resistant infection Ir(t) Ir(t) + 1 (I to reduce computational load, we implemented an adaptive step-size method [29] to estimate the transition time to the next event (t) by calculating the sum of the frequencies of all possible events, given by = (I + TIT)S(t) + r(Ir + IT,r)S(t) + (1 \u2013 p)E(E + Er) + pqE(E + Er) + (I + Ir + IT,r + J + IT) to determine the nature of the a small reduction in the fraction of isolated individuals leads to the elimination of the second wave in the stochastic model. the mean-field model produces a second wave with even a larger magnitude than the first wave of the outbreak. a key parameter in these simulations is the step-size of the Monte Carlo method. pqE(E + Er) + IT + p(1 \u2013 q)E(E + Er) + (I + Ir + IT,r + IT,r + IT,r + IT), and p(1 \u2013 q)E(E + Er) + (I + Ir + IT,r + IT,r + IT,r + IT), respectively. t = U1 is uniform distribution in the interval [0,1] to determine the nature of the next event small reduction in the fraction of isolated individuals leads to the elimination of the second wave in the stochastic model. mean-field model still produces a second wave with even a larger magnitude than the first wave of the outbreak. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
