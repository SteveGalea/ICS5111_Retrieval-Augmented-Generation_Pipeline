{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Stool samples were collected from five cats during a diarrhea outbreak in a hoarding situation in a hoarding situation in a hoarding situation. one sample was positive for both FPLV and Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin gene. FPLV, a protoparvovirus closely related to pathogenic canine parvovirus 2, can cause panleukopenia. two mammalian viruses were detected by BLASTx search (E score, 1030), Lyon-IARC polyomavirus (LIPyV) and bocaparvovirus 3 (NC_039044) in the genus Bocavirus of the family Parvoviridae. for bocavirus, the first-round primers were FBP54F (5\u2032-AGCCATACAGTTTGACGGCA-3\u2032) and the second-round primers were FBP PCR products of the correct size were identified by gel electrophoresis. three fecal samples tested positive for LIPyV. bocaparvovirus 3 has been reported in feline feces and tissues. pathogenicity has not been established (6\u20138). LIPyV-specific PCR detected polyomavirus DNA in 9/445 skin swabs and 1/439 plucked eyebrow hair samples from healthy U.S. adults. a serosurvey of 152 human serum samples from the Netherlands did not detect any LIPyV seroreactivity, indicating either no or only rare human infections."}
