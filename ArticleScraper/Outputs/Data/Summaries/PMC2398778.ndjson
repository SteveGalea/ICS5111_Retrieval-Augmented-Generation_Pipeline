{"summary": "interaction between intracellular parasites and their hosts represents a paradigm of resource manipulation. virulent relationship results in alteration of many aspects of cellular metabolism and development, which are taken over in the parasite's own benefit [5]\u2013[7]. characterization of changes in the pathogen's genome that are responsible for adaptation to a new host after spilling over from the original one. the pathosystem Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV)-Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Ler has been chosen for the present study. ary changes in viral genome and phenotypic properties are the focus of the study. the ancestral TEV was poorly adapted to A. thaliana Ler and infection concurred with the development of very mild symptoms. symptoms developed 21 dpi by plants infected with ancestral and evolved TEV. plants inoculated with ancestral and evolved virus (TEV-At17) show milder symptoms than plants inoculated with the evolved virus (TEV-At17) TEV-At17 accumulation was 44-fold larger than the value estimated for the ancestral TEV (two-sample t-test, t 43 = 15.58, P0.0001) symptoms induced by TEV-At17 were more severe (Figure 1), including stunting, vein clearing and leaf deformation. these three synonymous substitutions may explain the observed improvement in virus amplification and pathogenicity. the relevance of the three synonymous substitutions observed is not as clear, although their adaptive value cannot be ruled out. VPg and P3 substitutions induced symptoms that were qualitatively more severe than those produced by the single VPg L2013F mutant (Table 1). the triple mutant recreated the strong symptoms characteristic of TEV-At17. the presence of substitution T1210M in the VPg protein is enough for triggering symptoms. five replicates were analyzed per experimental treatment using a global reference experimental design. a total of 13,722 spots, corresponding to 12,180 genes, were considered valid for further analyses. data were normalized to the median expression of non-infected plants. pathogenesis-related protein PR1 is well known to be a marker for the activation of salicylic acid-dependent defenses. the first pattern (SOM A3) corresponds to 141 genes that were down-regulated after infection with TEV but showed expression levels similar to uninfected plants. the third pattern (SOM A4) corresponds to 234 genes whose expression was not significantly affected by TEV infection but show increased expression after infection with TEV-At17. the second pattern (SOM B3) includes 196 genes that were down-regulated after infection with both ancestral and evolved viruses. the third pattern corresponds to 456 genes whose expression was not affected by TEV but showed lower expression when TEV-At17 infected the plants. number of GO terms shows significant over- and under-representation in the differentially down-regulated genes. non-redundant functional categories correspond to SOMs B1 plus B2 (i.e., genes over-expressed after infection by TEV but not differing from uninfected plants when infected with TEV-At17) genes involved in the SAR and in the activation of innate immune responses were not expressed on plants infected with the ancestral TEV. rylation 7 26.56 14.38 0.002 MAPKKK cascade 7 1.56 0.07 0.047 Systemic acquired resistance 8 5.38 0.47 0.013 Activation of innate immune resistance 9 10.53 0.61 0.015 Under represented Nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide, and nucleic acid metabolic processes 4 13.64 22.54 0.004 Regulation of cellular processes 4 9.94 16.22 0.048 Proteolysis 6 2.06 7.98 0.011 serial-passage experiments simulating horizontal transmission are well known to produce increases on parasite's virulence due to enhanced within-host competition among pathogenic strains. the results of a different experimental design in which transmission would be vertical, and hence making high virulence detrimental, may produce different results. the only fully meaningful studies would be those in which pathogens and their experimental hosts would have an evolutionary history of association in the experimental growth conditions. symptoms developed 21 dpi by plants infected with ancestral and evolved TEV. plants inoculated with ancestral and evolved virus (TEV-At17) show milder symptoms than plants inoculated with the evolved virus (TEV-At17) infectivity of TEV-At17 was 100% (95% CI: 77.91\u2013100%) and significantly larger than for ancestral TEV. symptoms induced by TEV-At17 were more severe (Figure 1), including stunting, vein clearing and leaf deformation. these three synonymous substitutions may explain the observed improvement in virus amplification and pathogenicity. the relevance of the three synonymous substitutions observed is not as clear, although their adaptive value cannot be ruled out. substitutions induced symptoms that were qualitatively more severe than those produced by the single VPg L2013F mutant. the triple mutant recreated the strong symptoms characteristic of TEV-At17. the presence of substitution T1210M in the VPg protein is enough for triggering symptoms. a total of 13,722 spots, corresponding to 12,180 genes, were considered valid for further analyses. data were normalized to the median expression of non-infected plants. Statistical analysis allowed identification of genes whose expression responded differentially upon infection with either TEV or TEV-At17. the second pattern (SOM A3) corresponds to 141 genes that were down-regulated after infection with TEV. the third pattern (SOM A4) corresponds to 234 genes whose expression was not significantly affected by TEV infection but show increased expression after infection with TEV-At17. the second pattern (SOM B3) includes 196 genes that were down-regulated after infection with both ancestral and evolved viruses. the third pattern corresponds to 456 genes whose expression was not affected by TEV but showed lower expression when TEV-At17 infected the plants. the expression of transcription factors (TF) was also differentially affected by TEV and TEV-At17. non-redundant functional categories correspond to SOMs B1 plus B2. genes over-expressed after infection by TEV but not differing from uninfected plants when infected with TEV-At17. genes involved in the SAR and in the activation of innate immune responses were not expressed on plants infected with the ancestral TEV. genes involved in response to auxin were under-expressed to a larger extent by plants infected with TEV-At17. gene expression was repressed in presence of both viruses but to a larger extent when plants infected with TEV-At17 were infecting plants. serial-passage experiments simulating horizontal transmission are well known to produce increases on parasite's virulence due to enhanced within-host competition among pathogenic strains. the results of a different experimental design in which transmission would be vertical, and hence making high virulence detrimental, may produce different results. five g of RNA transcripts were rub-inoculated into the third true leaf of four-week-old plants. plants were maintained at 25\u00b0C and 16 h light photoperiod. viral load reached by replicating TEV populations in A. thaliana was estimated. plants were inoculated between growth stages 3.5 and 3.7. plants were maintained at 25\u00b0C and 16 h light photoperiod. successful infections were confirmed by Western blot hybridization analysis 21 dpi. the kit incorporates the PfuUltraTM high fidelity DNA polymerase. the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by sequencing. RNA extraction and microarray hybridization Total RNA was extracted from control and infected plants. Oligos were rehydrated and immobilized by UV irradiation. slides were prehybridized 30 min at 42\u00b0C with 100 L of 6 SSC, 1% BSA and 0.5% SDS. labeled RNA was used to hybridize the slides. only probes for which a valid data was obtained in at least 13 out of the 15 slides were considered for further analysis. data were normalized to the median of the expression in control samples. differentially over- and under-expressed genes were grouped in 22 self-organizing maps (SOMs) five g of RNA transcripts were rub-inoculated into the third true leaf. plants were maintained at 25\u00b0C and 16 h light photoperiod. seven dpi, virions were purified as described elsewhere. successful infections were confirmed by Western blot hybridization analysis 21 dpi using commercial antibodies anti-coat protein conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Agdia) one gram of leaf tissue from a randomly-chosen infected plant per lineage were carefully ground in 1 mL 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH = 8.0) plants were always inoculated with similar viral doses. RNA extraction and microarray hybridization Total RNA was extracted from control plants and used in an amplification reaction with the MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification kit (Ambion) to assess the presence of undesired mutations on each clone. oligos were rehydrated and immobilized by UV irradiation. slides were prehybridized 30 min at 42\u00b0C. labeled RNA was used to hybridize the slides. data were analyzed with the SAM package [42] using two-class comparison (TEV versus TEV-At17) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5.38%. differentially over- and under-expressed genes were grouped in 22 self-organizing maps (SOMs) [43] using Acuity with Euclidean squared similarity metrics. genes were ordered based on the score in SAM output with a FDR of 5.38% (533 spots, corresponding with 496 genes).
