{"summary": "induction of innate immune signaling is critical for host defense against viral infections. type I IFNs possess no antiviral activity and exert their potent antiviral effects by the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. some of the best-characterized ISGs target viral entry belong to the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM) family. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) exclusively uses a clathrin-mediated pathway for its entry. enterovirus coxsackievirus B enters via a dynamin II GTPase-independent pathway in polarized intestinal cells [12], but enters nonpolarized epithelial cells and polarized epithelial cells through a dynamin II-mediated pathway. members of the ADP-ribosylation factor family of Ras-related proteins are expressed in all eukaryotic cells. they regulate both secretory pathway trafficking (as is the case for Arf1) and cortical actin rearrangements and endocytosis (as is the case for Arf6). expression of ADAP2 suppresses DENV and VSV infection in an arf6 GAP activity-dependent manner, while exerting no effect on CVB or SeV replication. we further show that ADAP2 directly associates with actin-enriched membrane ruffles, macropinosomes, and lysosomes. ADAP2 is induced by IFN treatment in a STAT1-dependent manner. it restricts DENV and VSV infection as assessed by RT-qPCR. data are normalized to vector control-infected cells. inset, immunoblot for MAVS (top panel) or GAPDH (bottom panel) in WT or MAVS-/- cells. data in (C) and (D) are shown as mean standard deviation. expression of ADAP2 restricts DENV and VSV replication. expression of ADAP2 restricted DENV and VSV replication in both control cells and in cells lacking the expression of MAVS. expression of ADAP2 has no impact on the induction of ISGs during DENV infection and instead reduced the induction given the inhibition of viral replication. newly formed actin-enriched membrane ruffles associated with DsRed-ADAP2 are denoted by white arrows. immunofluorescence microscopy for actin (in green) in cells transfected with ADAP2-V5. cells were fixed and immunostained 48hrs post-transfection. AP2 over an extended period (4hrs) to determine the pattern of movement exhibited by ADAP2-containing vesicles. vesicles originating at the cell periphery/membrane ruffles internalized to the perinuclear region (Fig 2D, pink tracings), preformed vesicles that exhibited free movement within the cell (Fig 2D, dark blue tracings) confocal micrographs of U2OS cells transfected with wild-type (WT), constitutively-active (Q111L), or dominant-negative (T66N) EGFP-Rab34 and DsRed-ADAP2 appear as yellow. each point represents a unique cell that coexpressed both constructs. expression of wild-type or constitutively-active (Q111L) and dominant-negative (T66N) mutants of Rab34 enhanced the numbers and sizes of ADAP2-containing vesicles. expression of T66N Rab34 significantly reduced these vesicles and induced the accumulation of ADAP2 at cell-cell contacts and membrane ruffles. we found that ADAP2 exhibited significant colocalization in intracellular vesicles. expression of a constitutively active mutant of Rab8a (Q67L) also highly associated with ADAP2-containing vesicles (Fig 4C, S6 Movie) ADAP2 associates with lysosomes, but not early or late endosomes. in some circumstances, internalized macropinosomes fuse directly with tubular lysosomes. whereas ADAP2-containing vesicles were excluded from EEA1- and Rab7-containing vesicles. mRFP-EEA1 (E), mRFP-Rab7 (F) or mRFP-LAMP1 (G) and either GFP-ADAP2 (E, G) or DsRed-ADAP2 (F) data are shown as individual Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients. mutant of ADAP2 (R53Q) did not induce cytoplasmic vesicles. mutants lacking either the entire Arf6 GAP domain (ADAP2 Arf GAP) or the second PH domain (ADAP2 PH2) showed a strong association with the cell periphery. RT-qPCR in 293T cells transfected with vector control or either wild-type (WT) or R53Q V5-fused ADAP2. data in (D) and (E) are shown as mean standard deviation (*p0.05, **p0.01) clathrin-mediated pathway delivers incoming viral particles to late endosomes. expression of ADAP2 induced macropinocytosis through its arf6 GAP activity. expression of wild-type ADAP2, but not R53Q ADAP2, altered the internalization of transferrin. assays were performed under illuminated conditions (Fig 7A) ADAP2 restricts DENV entry. Titer of NR-DENV under non-illuminated or illuminated conditions. if ADAP2 restricts DENV entry, we would expect that exposure of ADAP2-expressing cells to light early in infection would elicit a greater inhibition of DENV infection than when cells are infected under non-illuminated conditions. the restriction of DENV-NR replication by ADAP2 was significantly enhanced under the illuminated condition. ADAP2 is induced by IFN treatment in a STAT1-dependent manner. many known ISGs, such as interferon-induced protein 44-like (IFI44L), members of the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) family, radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2) and members of the 2',5'-Oligoadenylate synthetas RT-qPCR analysis for IFI44L and ADAP2 in 2fTGH cells treated with 100U of purified IFN for 24hrs. expression is shown as fold change relative to untreated cells. data are normalized to vector control-infected cells. expression of ADAP2 restricted DENV, VSV, CVB and SeV replication. expression of ADAP2 was confirmed by RT-qPCR (S1A Fig) ADAP2 associates with membrane ruffles and actin. expression of ADAP2 induced pronounced membrane ruffling. but immunostaining with all commercially available ADAP2 antibodies was unsuccessful. single particle tracking from time-lapse movies of U2OS cells expressing DsRed-ADAP2 over the period of 3.5hrs. three independent vesicles were tracked and are shown in light blue, dark blue, or pink. at top, initial image acquired prior to particle tracking and at bottom, image acquired at the conclusion of image acquisition. a hallmark of internalized macropinosomes is their association with actin. to do this, we analyzed the localization of ADAP2 with fluorescently-labeled dextran, which serves as a marker for fluid-phase uptake. newly formed Rab34-enriched membrane ruffles associated with DsRed-ADAP2 are denoted by white arrows. data in (E-F) are shown as mean standard deviation and are from at least 20 independent vesicles. expression of Rab34 Q111L enhanced the numbers and sizes of ADAP2-containing vesicles. expression of T66N Rab34 significantly reduced these vesicles and induced the accumulation of ADAP2 at cell-cell contacts and membrane ruffles. ADAP2 localizes to Rab8a-positive membrane ruffles and recycling endosomes. these data suggest that ADAP2 localizes to Rab8a-positive recycling endosomes. areas of colocalization appear as yellow. we assessed the localization of GFP-ADAP2 with markers of early endosomes (early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1)), late endosomes (Rab7), and lysosomes (LAMP1). whereas ADAP2-containing vesicles were excluded from EEA1- and Rab7-containing vesicles, they exhibited a strong association with LAMP1-containing vesicles in both fixed (Fig 5A mRFP-EEA1 (E), GFP-Rab7 (F) or mRFP-LAMP1 (G) are highly associated with LAMP1. the newly formed ADAP2-positive vesicles are highly associated with LAMP1 and are denoted by white arrows. mutants lacking either the entire Arf6 GAP domain (ADAP2 Arf GAP) or the second PH domain (ADAP2 PH2) were incubated with the indicated constructs for 48hrs. the numbers of dextran+ vesicles in each condition were then measured. expression of wild-type ADAP2 with wild-type Arf6 enhanced the formation of ADAP2-containing vesicles. expression of wild-type V5- or GFP-fused ADAP2 restricted DENV replication. expression of either the R53Q or ARF GAP mutants of ADAP2 had no effect on viral replication. expression of wild-type ADAP2, but not R53Q ADAP2, altered the internalization of transferrin and prevented its perinuclear accumulation. we first generated neutral red (NR) containing DENV particles (DENV-NR) when viruses are propagated in the presence of NR, the dye associates with vRNA and renders the resulting viral particles sensitive to light. 93T cells transfected with vector control or ADAP2-V5 under non-illuminated (dark grey) or illuminated at 2hr (light grey) or 0hr (white) post-infection. cells were fixed and immunostained with antibodies against EEA1 (in red) and DENV (in green) we performed a modified neutral-red infectious center (NRIC) assay [33] using DENV-NR particles. if ADAP2 restricts DENV entry, we would expect that exposure of ADAP2-expressing cells to light early in infection would elicit a greater inhibition of DENV infection than when cells are infected under non-illuminated conditions. however, we found that the restriction of DENV-NR replication by ADAP2 was significantly enhanced under the illuminated condition. ADAP2 expression is induced by type I IFNs in a STAT1-dependent manner. the expression of the related ADAP1 (also known as centaurin-1) is largely restricted to the brain. the expression of the related ADAP1 is ubiquitously expressed. DENV enters mammalian cells by a clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway that delivers incoming viral particles to Rab7 positive late endosomes. a small portion (20%) of viral particles undergo membrane fusion in Rab5 early endosomes or Rab5/Rab7 intermediate endosomes. the majority (>80%) of membrane fusion occurs in Rab7 late endosomal compartments. expression of a dominant inactive mutant (T157N) has no effect on intracellular accumulation of cargo. expression of a dominant inactive mutant (T157N) has no effect on intracellular accumulation of cargo. however, expression of a dominant inactive mutant (T157N) has no effect on intracellular accumulation of cargo. expression of wild-type Arf6 had no effect on DENV infection. expression of Q67L Arf6, which dramatically enhances vesicle invaginations from the plasma membrane in actin-coated vesicles. in some scenarios, the maintenance of Arf6 in a GDP bound state may serve in a proviral, or promicrobial manner. cells were plated at a density of 2104 cells per well in a 96-well plate. pRZ-mCherry-Cas9 and pLenti-gRNA constructs were transfected at a ratio of 3:1. limiting dilution cloning was performed and after 10 days, growing monoclones were selected by bright field microscopy. cells were infected with DENV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 FFU/cell for 24h, VSV and CVB3-RD at MOIs of 0.2 PFU/cell for 24h, SeV at 100 hemagglutination units (HAU)/mL, unless otherwise stated. mutants ADAP2-V5 and GFP-ADAP2 were constructed by amplification of human ADAP2 cDNA. control (scrambled) siRNA and siRNA targeting ADAP2 (5\u2019-GGACUGGUUCAAUGCCCUC-3\u2019) were purchased from Sigma. siRNAs were transfected using X-tremegene 9 DNA (Roche) or X-tremegene HP DNA (Roche) transfection reagents according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. mRNA labeling was performed using a One-Color Low Input Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent) slides were scanned using Agilent\u2019s SureScan Microarray Scanner System. the R package Limma (Linear Models for Microarray Data) was used to identify differentially expressed mRNAs between mock- and IFN-treated samples. images were captured using a microscope containing 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for three-dimensional analysis, xy or yz series stacks were acquired at 0.5 m intervals through the total thickness of the cell monolayer (10 m) single particle tracking was performed using the MTrackJ plugin in Image J/Fiji.
