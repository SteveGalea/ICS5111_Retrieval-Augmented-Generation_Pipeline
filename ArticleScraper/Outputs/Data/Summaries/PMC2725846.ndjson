{"summary": "random digital dialing was used to select the samples. data were collected by using computer-assisted telephone interviewing. interviews were conducted in 5 european countries (denmark, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain, and Poland) the highest mean score was in Poland and the lowest was in Denmark (Table 2). higher scores were observed in Europe than in Asia (t = 5.2; df = 3,250; p0.001) in all countries, except Singapore, risk perception was higher among women than men. new tab *DNK, Denmark; POL, Poland; NLD, the Netherlands; UK, United Kingdom; ESP, Spain; CHN, China; HKG, Hong Kong; SGP, Singapore*. .71\u20132.91) 2.70 (2.61\u20132.80) Europe 7.06 (6.96\u20137.16) 3.16 (3.11\u20133.21) 3.21 (3.17\u20133.25) 2.46 (2.41\u20132.50) 2.05 (2.01\u20132.10) Asia 6.74 (6.60\u20136.88) 2.97 (2.90\u20133.03) 3.03 (2.97\u20133.08) 2.92 (2.87\u20132.96) 2.75 (2.69\u20132.80) Total 6.95 (6.86\u20137.03) 3. risk perception and efficacy levels before and after the introduction of avian influenza in Europe did not differ significantly. sex, and age group were all significantly associated with self-efficacy. demic is perceived as a real risk, the level of self-efficacy appears to be rather low. specific attention should therefore be paid to risk communication. otherwise, adherence to preventive measures may be low."}
