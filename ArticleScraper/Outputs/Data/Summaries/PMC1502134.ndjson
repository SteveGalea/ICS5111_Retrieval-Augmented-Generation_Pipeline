{"summary": "antimicrobial resistance is an under-appreciated threat to public health in nations around the globe. it is important to understand international patterns of resistance. if countries already experience similar patterns of resistance, it may be too late to worry about international spread. there is not strong international convergence in the countries' resistance patterns. this finding may change with the greater international travel that will accompany globalization. future research on the determinants of drug resistance patterns should be a priority. we compare the experiences of the u.s. and china with new data on antibiotic resistance. the first section gives brief background on antibiotic resistance and its costs. we then turn to a detailed comparison of surveillance data from china, Kuwait, and the united states. in 1996, a japanese hospital reported the first case of vancomycin-resistant SAU. but only one year later, researchers reported the first case of linezolid-resistant MRSA in an 85-year-old man undergoing peritoneal dialysis. travel to and from china has increased tremendously over the past decade. we compute growth rates of resistance by a specific bacterium to a specific drug. the prevalence is calculated as the number of resistant isolates divided by the number of total isolates collected. we also develop methods to aggregate specific \"bug-drug\" data to summarize resistance patterns. a seven-year (1994\u20132000) study by china's national center for antimicrobial resistance reports resistance levels of ten most prevalent bacteria to ciprofloxacin. the annual measured percentage of isolates found to be resistant varies considerably. some bacteria such as ECO and MRSA have high proportions (60\u201380%) of resistant strains, whereas the prevalence of resistant strains for others such as PMI is quite low. we construct two measures to compare HAI and CAI resistance prevalence. by aggregating the seven bacteria, we get a measure indexed on bacteria. by multiplying the resistance rate of each bacterium by its isolation frequency and proportion among HAI (or CAI) infections.

ICU patients have the highest resistance rates in selected drug-bug pairs. the average prevalence of resistance for ICU, other inpatients, and outpatients in the u.s. is 20%, 17% and 13%. in china, average resistance for hospital-acquired infections is 41%. we gathered data on antimicrobial resistance among isolates of eight different bacterial diseases over the most recent five years. the average resistance level for all surveyed bacteria was about 27% from 1999 to 2003 (Table 10), higher than the 17% for the U.S. and about the same as the 28% China. amikacin 0 0 0 0 0 0 Ampicillin 6 12 7 25 26 Amoxicillin-clavulanate 5 10 7 2 0 Cefotaxime 0 1 0 1 0 Ceftriaxone 0 1 0 2 0 Cefuroxime 1 1 0 27 41 Cephalexin 2 10 37 57 50 Chloramphenicol 8 21 0 18 18 Ciprofloxacin 0 0 14 10 16 TMP 5 years in Kuwait Antibiotic Percentage (%) of resistant isolates in 1999 (n = 370) 2000 (n = 335) 2001 (n = 322) 2002 (n = 248) 2003 (n = 212) Ampicillin 1 1 3 2 0 Erythromycin 59 78 77 75 92 Gentamicin 26 36 61 52 98 Nitrofurantoin 2 2 2 36 86 Norfloxacin 36 47 47 NT NT Penicillin 16 38 35 53 85 Teicoplan 3% resistance growth rate of ECO against Ciprofloxacin in china is significantly lower than in the other two countries against similar quinolone drugs. a low rate of growth is small consolation if patients already face a high baseline risk of a drug-resistant infection. resistance rates in China, U.S. and Kuwait may be correlated with volume of usage. the original U.S. NNIS reported resistance rates to either one of the Cef3 drugs. each country has its own most problematic resistance culprit. for china, MRSA is the biggest threat, where resistance among hospital-acquired infections reaches 90%, the highest among the five countries. the statistic by definition is bounded between -1 and 1, where -1 means perfect disagreement while 1 means perfect agreement. thus the bigger the statistic, the more correlated resistance patterns are. in the long run, resistance in a country is more likely to be determined by endogenous factors (such as strictness of practices for prescribing drugs) in the long run, the frequency and magnitude of contacts among nations with different resistance problems is likely to be critical. as we expect them to be opening more to the world, particularly China, the problem may worsen when these countries can increasingly export and import antibiotic resistance. resistance rates in china are much more strongly correlated with those in the united states than those in the u.s. this correlation pattern suggests that in the short run, resistance in a country is more likely to be determined by endogenous factors. the number of Chinese departures to overseas destinations has been growing at increasing rates in the past decade. there are complex interactions with levels of economic well-being. the critical question for policy is whether countries can control their own resistance problems, and also avoid importing the problem from abroad.
