{"summary": "VTE consists of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). PE included acute pulmonary embolism (APE) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) complements consist of nine components, together with factors associated with complement activities, are termed complement system. the activation of complement system renders cascade reaction. the common end of the activation pathway forms membrane attack complex, which exerts cytolytic effect. the CH50 level increased in 38/45 patients, and remained normal in 7/45 patients. the C3 level decreased in 3/45 patients, increased in 2/45 patients, and remained normal in 4/45 patients. the C4 level increased in 4/45 patients, and remained normal in 40/45 patients. in terminal of complement activation pathway and imbalance of complement regulatory proteins associated genes mRNA expressions indicated interruption/decrease of cascade reactions. there was significant increase of CH50 in acute VTE patients."}
