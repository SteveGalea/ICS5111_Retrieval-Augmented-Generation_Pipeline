{"summary": "complication of the disease is coronary artery lesion that may result in myocardial infarction or sudden death. etiology of Kawasaki disease is largely unknown despite various hypotheses. insertion/deletion polymorphism coded within intron 16 has been studied in many literature to find the association with such diseases. there has been few studies regarding the association between the polymorphism of ACE gene (DD, ID, II) and Kawasaki disease among Korean pediatric populations. ACE genotyping Each of the subjects' DNA was extracted from whole blood at the time of diagnosis using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. the study was approved by the hospital's ethics commitee. the diagnosis was made if he/she had typical manifestations even before less than 5 febrile days of illness. all patients were treated with immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) on the day of diagnosis. 0.5 units Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) 35 cycles were repeated for 30 sec at 94\u00b0C, 30 sec at 52\u00b0C, 90 sec at 72\u00b0C, and 5 min at 72\u00b0C. DNA fragments were then separated by electrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gel. in control group, both genotype (DD, ID, II) and allelic frequencies were not statistically different between those with coronary dilatations and those without. ACE gene is localized on chromosome 17q23 and is characterized by a major insertion/deletion polymorphism. ACE levels may be accounted for its polymorphism (19, 20) it is reported that mean ACE levels were lowest for II homozygotes, highest for DD homozygotes, and intermediate for ID heterozygotes (18, 21). it is not clear whether increased levels of ACE actually affect the levels of angiotenisn II because the renin-angiotensin system is regulated by feedback mechanism (22) in this study, the ID genotype was more prevalent (59.3 vs. 30.2%, p0.01) and the DD genotype (12.9 vs. 41.9%, p0.01) was less prevalent in Kawasaki group than in control group. however, both genotype (DD, ID, II) and allelic frequencies were not statistically different between Kawasaki disease patients and those without. IVIG is recommended to be given within the first 10 days of illness. the duration of febrile days before the diagnosis was 4.61.6 days."}
