{"summary": "the use of potentially insensitive serologic assays further hampered the detection of respiratory viral infections in this patient population. 1, 2, 3, 4 Molecular diagnostic techniques circumvent the problems associated with viral culture in children with CF and permit the detection of viruses that are extremely difficult or impossible to culture even in optimal settings. merase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of respiratory viruses was performed on respiratory specimens collected during routine clinic visits and during pulmonary exacerbation. the association between the detection of respiratory viruses and clinical symptoms was also evaluated. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. specimens were tested by a panel of seven single or multiplex realtime reverse transcription (RT)PCR and PCR (for adenovirus) for qualitative detection of these respiratory viruses. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 The upper airway sample was extracted as previously described. each assay reliably detected 10 viral copies per reaction, providing a sensitivity of 1000 copies/ml. 14 Extracted nucleic acid samples that had been stored at 80\u00b0C for up to 42 months were thawed and retrospectively tested by the new assay for the majority of samples that had been studied to date. for comparison of paired samples, all pairs were judged using the same version of the assay. respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses, and adenoviruses. respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses, and adenoviruses. samples were eluted in 200 l of water. each assay reliably detected 10 viral copies per reaction. results were reported as positive (amplification plot crossed the threshold at 40 cycles) or negative (amplification plot did not cross the threshold) an upper airway sample was collected at each of 359 visits during the study period, for an average of 82 samples per participant. most nasal samples were collected by nasal swab rather than nasal wash because of participant preference. sweat chloride data were available for 40 participants in the full cohort and 18 in the subcohort. a paired sputum specimen was collected simultaneously with the upper airway sample from 21 participants. the average number of positive upper airway samples per participant was 25 (SD, 19; range, 0\u20139) the average number of positive upper airway samples per participant was 25 (SD, 19; range, 0\u20139) human metapneumovirus 6 (17) 1 (11) 0 (0) *108 positive samples accounted for 115 positive results. 102 samples with one virus detected, five samples with two viruses detected, and one sample with three viruses detected. rhinoviruses were the most commonly detected virus, with the same detection rate for both sample types. sensitivity and specificity were not calculated for other virus types because of their low relative frequency. rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus type detected in our study, further analyses examined rhinovirus detection in association with clinical parameters. increased cough and increased sputum production were most predictive of rhinovirus detection among symptoms reported for the 30 days preceding the clinic visit. results were similar to those observed for concurrent symptoms. concurrent culture positivity for Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus was associated with upper airway rhinovirus detection. a total of 44 participants were enrolled. the mean age at enrollment was 128 years; mean FEV1 percent predicted was 942%. sweat chloride data were available for 40 participants in the full cohort and 18 in the subcohort. a paired sputum specimen was collected simultaneously with the upper airway sample from 21 participants. the proportion of visits with rhinovirus detection was highest during the fourth quarter of the year (375% versus 146%, 239%, and 190% for first through third quarters, respectively) the proportion of visits with rhinovirus detection was highest during the fourth quarter of the year. 102 samples with one virus detected, five samples with two viruses detected, and one sample with three viruses detected. one sample with three viruses detected had adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza 3. rhinovirus was detected in 35 of 130 respiratory illness visits (269%) and 43 of 199 nonillness visits (216%) sensitivity and specificity were not calculated for other virus types because of their low relative frequency. increased cough and increased sputum production were most predictive of rhinovirus detection among symptoms reported for the 30 days preceding the clinic visit. results were similar to those observed for concurrent symptoms. concurrent culture positivity for Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus was associated with rhinovirus detection. however, P. aeruginosa positive cultures were not (OR 08; 95% CI 04, 14; P = 036) 39 of 44 of our participants had a rhinovirus detected in respiratory samples during the 2year followup. this was true whether or not participants were symptomatic. rhinoviruses were detected at least once in more than 50% of patients. study population (44 versus 71 participants) and relatively less frequent sampling (quarterly versus every 2 months) it might be expected that rhinoviruses were more commonly associated with pulmonary exacerbations when younger children were included. studies in hospitalized children who do not have CF have demonstrated rates of rhinovirusassociated hospitalization of 48 per 1000 children. recent studies demonstrating the impact of rhinovirus in children with and without underlying lung disease emphasize the impact of this virus 18. this study was funded by a grant to Dr. Englund from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
