{"summary": "in south africa, polyphenol-rich herbal preparations made up from roots of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme are traditionally used to treat respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, dysmenorrhea, and hepatic disorders. more than seven decades later, a special ethanolic extract of Pelargonium sidoides roots, EPs 7630, was finally developed. in germany, EPs 7630 is approved today for the therapeutic use in patients with acute bron EPs 7630 shows efficacy against cellular infections with influenza virus, HSV, EMCV, RSV, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and coxsackie virus. different modes of action underlying the antibacterial effects of EPs 7630 have been proposed. EPs 7630 inhibits the adherence of bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes to epithelial cells in vitro. Dried extract of a single batch was used to prepare a stock solution of 3 mg/ml. this solution was obtained by dissolving the powder in sterile PBS containing 10% ethanol, followed by ultrasound treatment and sterile filtration using a 0.2 m filter unit. PBMCs were stimulated with EPs 7630 (3 and 30 g/ml) isolated PBMCs were stimulated with EPs 7630 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 g/ml or left without stimulation for 48 h. lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/ml) or poly (I:C) (10 g/ml) was added after the first 24 h. PBMCs were stimulated for 4 to 5 h with EPs 7630 concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 g/ml, ELISA-based analyses of cytokine production Culture supernatants were analyzed for TNF-, IL-6 and IL-10 content by ELISA using respective detection kits from R&D systems. blot analysis of signal transduction Lysing of PBMCs, quantification of proteins in the cell lysates, SDS PAGE gel electrophoresis and blotting of respective gel was carried out. treated PBMCs were incubated with brefeldin A (Sigma Aldrich; 5 g/ml) for the last 3 to 4 h of treatment. cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) to assess the purity of isolated memory T-helper cells, cells were stained with fluorescent antibodies. a p-value of p 0.05 was considered as indicator of significance. preparation of EPs 7630 EPs 7630 is prepared from the roots of Pelargonium sidoides with a drug to extract ratio of 1:8\u201310. monoclonal antibodies were left without specific treatment for 4 and 24 h. cells were recovered for western blot analysis. isolated PBMCs were stimulated with EPs 7630 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 g/ml. the possible influence of EPs 7630 on PBMC proliferation and apoptosis was tested by stimulation of PBMCs with 0 (0.1% ethanol solvent control), 3, 10 and 30 g/ml EPs 7630 as well as with 0.1% DMSO. cells were recovered for flow cytometric analysis. isolated T-cells were cultured in the presence or absence of EPs 7630 for 48 h. analysis of signal transduction elements was performed by incubation of blots with antibodies detecting phospho-JNK1/2, phospho-p38, phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-Akt, phospho-STAT5 and phospho-p65 (all from Cell Signaling Technology) and GAPDH (Merck Millipore) followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (H&L, clone 3G8), CD14 (clone RMO52), and CD19 (clone J4.119) treated cells were stained with fluorescent annexin V antibodies and propidium iodide. the proportion of apoptotic cells (annexin V+ cells) were evaluated. cells responded to EPs 7630 by secretion of TNF- and IL-6 with levels that were much higher than those induced by the mix of cytokines and TCR engagement. also EPs 7630 slightly triggered IL-10 production, and this production was clearly smaller (3- to 5-fold) than that induced by CD3/CD28-mediated stimulation. donor PBMCs were stimulated with EPs 7630 and TLR4 ligand. quantification of TNF-, IL-6, and IL-10 in respective culture supernatants. significant differences compared to control group are indicated. no relevant TNF-, IL-6, or IL-10 production was found by these cells stimulated with different EPs 7630 concentrations. flow-cytometric analysis of intracellular cytokine staining showed that no population of T-helper cells was able to produce TNF- after stimulation with EPs 7630. memory T-helper cells, isolated as in (A), were treated with different concentrations of EPs 7630 as indicated for 24 h. cytokine concentrations in the absence of EPs 7630 were: 4753608 pg/ml (TNF-), 3.40.9 pg/ml (IL-6), 737103 pg/ml (IL-10) PBMCs were treated with different concentrations of EPs 7630, TLR3 and TLR4 ligands (T3L, T4L), cytokine mixture (IL-1, IL-2 and IL-12) and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated Dynabeads for 10 and 30 min as indicated. PBMCs were pretreated with inhibitors targeting MAP kinase and NF-B signaling pathways (SP600125 (JNK1/2/3), PBMCs were treated for 10 and 30 min with EPs 7630 at two different concentrations (3 and 10 g/ml) we then investigated the signaling pathways activated by this drug. EPs 7630 activated the MAP kinases JNK1/2, p38, and ERK1/2. EPs 7630-induced production of TNF- in monocytes was strongly dependent on p38 activity and at least partly dependent on activation of Erk1/2 and NF-B. EPs 7630 modulates the immune response to bacterial and viral recognition EPs 7630 is very frequently used for infection prevention. cytokine concentrations in the absence of EPs 7630 in TL3L and TL4L groups were given as percent of 0 g/ml group (control). cytokine concentrations in the absence of EPs 7630 were: 1267414 and 1534324 pg/ml (TNF-), 1278369 and 2135650 pg/ml. EPs 7630 slightly triggered IL-10 production, and this production was clearly smaller (3- to 5-fold) than that induced by CD3/CD28-mediated stimulation. cytokine profile induced by EPs 7630 in PBMCs was also different from that induced by CD3/CD28-mediated stimulation. healthy donor PBMCs were stimulated with EPs 7630 and TLR4 ligand. cytokine concentration data from 4 donors (except TNF- 48h: n = 3) are given. a concentration-dependent induction of cellular TNF-, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion by EPs 7630. CD3/CD28 stimulation of memory T-helper cells did not result in a relevant increase of TNF-, IL-6, or IL-10 secretion. flow-cytometric analysis of intracellular cytokine staining showed that no population of T-helper cells was able to produce TNF- after stimulation with EPs 7630. Mean ( SEM) cytokine concentration data from 5 donors are given as percent of 0 g/ml EPs 7630 group (control) healthy donor PBMCs were stimulated with different concentrations of EPs 7630 as indicated for 4 to 5 h. representative dot plots of CD14+ cells (monocytes) from one representative experiment are given. Mean ( SEM) data of proportions of TNF-+ cells out of all CD14+ cells from 3 donors are given. PBMCs were treated for 10 and 30 min with EPs 7630 at two different concentrations. we then investigated the signaling pathways activated by this drug. EPs 7630 activated the MAP kinases JNK1/2, p38, and ERK1/2. EPs 7630 modulates the immune response to bacterial and viral recognition EPs 7630 is very frequently used for infection prevention. to address this question, we pretreated PBMCs with increasing concentrations of EPs 7630 (0.1\u20133 g/ml) for 24 h followed by stimulation with TLR3 or TLR4 ligands (mimicking viral or bacterial infection, respectively) a special extract of Pelargonium sidoides roots, EPs 7630 (Umckaloabo\u00ae) is therapeutically active against upper respiratory tract infections and currently approved for the application in acute bronchitis in Germany. cytokines play an essential role in the defense against bacteria and viruses. the cytokine profile induced by EPs 7630 was completely different from that induced by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents that caused production of a more anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu. this suggests that EPs 7630 acts as an immunostimulant and, before infection, may promote the innate immune defense. EPs 7630-activated pathway and cytokine pattern was very different from response seen after stimulation of human PBMCs with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. analysis of EPs 7630 for presence of contaminating bacterial lipopolysaccharide by a Limulus amebocyte lysate revealed a very low content of less than 200 EU/mg, equivalent to about 20 ng/mg. EPs 7630 treatment of patients may promote adaptive host defense against different viral, bacterial or fungal pathogens at respiratory epithelia. healthy donor PBMCs were treated for 24 h with different concentrations of EPs 7630, 1% DMSO (positive control for apoptosis), or were left untreated (solvent control). dot plots show the proportions of TNF-+ cells out of all CD4+ T-cells of one out of 2 independent experiments are given."}
