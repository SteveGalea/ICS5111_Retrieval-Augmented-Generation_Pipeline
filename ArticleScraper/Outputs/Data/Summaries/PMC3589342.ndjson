{"summary": "the risk of widespread epidemics in humans can be assessed by monitoring the reproduction number R (average number of persons infected by a human case) however, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters. existing methods do not correct for important selection and under-ascertainment biases. many zoonotic viruses are transmitted by means of an infected vector. others can be transmitted by inhalation, contact with infected excretions or by direct contact with an infected animal. zoonotic viruses are under strong selective pressure to acquire the ability for human-to-human transmission. the authors applied their new approach to assess human-to-human transmissions during zoonotic and certain non-zoonotic outbreaks. their new approach will be useful in assessing human-to-human transmissions during zoonotic and certain non-zoonotic outbreaks. m09 influenza pandemic [1], the SARS epidemic in 2003 [2] and the recent emergence of a novel coronavirus [3] are recent reminders of the global health threat posed by zoonotic viruses. prior to widespread emergence in human populations, such pathogens can cause occasional infections in sub-populations exposed to reservoir species. the surge in cases observed in summer 2012 raised public health concerns. zoonoses are not limited to influenza: more than half of all recent emerging infectious disease events were zoonotic [9]. estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters. the detection rate is set to = 1% and the overdispersion parameter of the offspring distribution k = 0.5. we present applications to another zoonotic virus (Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh) and to a non-zoonotic pathogen (Vibrio Cholerae in the Dominican Republic). a substantial proportion of cases can be linked to exposure to the animal reservoir. we consider two surveillance scenarios: (1) \u201cRoutine sentinel surveillance alone\u201d where we assume that each case initially has a probability of being detected by routine sentinel surveillance. relation between k and k (parameter k characterizes case-to-case variation in infectiousness) we first consider scenario 1 where each case has the same probability of being detected. in a typical chain of transmission of average length there is, by definition, one reservoir-to-human transmission event and human-to-human infections. data Novel influenza A virus infections in humans are nationally notifiable conditions in the u.s. from august 2011 to December 2011, CDC confirmed 12 human H3N2v-M infections [6],[7],[15],[16]. from august 2011 to December 2011, CDC confirmed 12 human H3N2v-M infections. a \u201cchain of transmission\u201d is defined as a single reservoir-to-human transmission event followed by subsequent human-to-human transmission events (if any) a \u201ccluster\u201d of related cases is defined as an outbreak that takes place in a specific location and at a specific time (e.g., outbreak in fair X in august 2011) we propose to estimate R from two simple summary statistics, the proportion infected by the natural reservoir among detected cases (G) and among the subset of the first detected cases in each cluster (F) we denote the length of a chain of transmission by L. a simple binomial probability function with probability 1R can be used to derive confidence intervals for R. a simple binomial probability function with probability 1R can be used to derive confidence intervals for R. a simple binomial probability function with probability 1R can be used to derive confidence intervals for R. from august 2011 to December 2011, CDC confirmed 12 human H3N2v-M infections. swine was the source of infection if there were 4 or fewer days from swine contact to onset, and cases occurring more than 4 days after exposure were likely to have been caused by human-to-human transmission. we find that it takes relatively high levels of case detection () or case-to-case variation in infectiousness (k) to cause substantial deviations from this linear relationship. the relationship is only weakly sensitive to having multiple chains of transmission per cluster of human cases. three of six (50%) of the first detected cases were infected by swine compared with 17 of 21 (81%) in clusters caused by the other variant viruses. Table 1 gives R estimates for different assumptions about the case detection rate and overdispersion parameter k. the number of first detected cases that were infected by the reservoir was 20 for all strains, three for H3N2v-M variant, and 17 for variants other than H3N2v-M. recent efforts at CDC to evaluate the case detection rate suggest that it is low, of the order of 0.5% of all H3N2v-M-attributable cases. we estimate the reproduction number of variant viruses other than H3N2v-M to be 0.2 (95% CI 0.1\u20130.4) for the H3N2v-M virus, the point estimate and the lower bound of the 95% CI of R are 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. the upper bound of the 95% CI of R lies between 0.8 and >1. if the detection rate is known, it is always possible to invert the relationship shown in Figure 2 to derive an unbiased estimator of R. however, for a fixed number of clusters occurring in the study population, larger detection rates increase precision through larger sample sizes. there is therefore a trade-off between bias and precision of the estimator 1F. uncertainty in the case detection rate and overdispersion parameter k are unknown. a lower bound for R can be obtained if it is possible to specify an upper bound for the case detection rate. parashar et al. [19] recruited patients who were hospitalized with encephalitis from January through April 1999. they recruited patients who were hospitalized with encephalitis from January through April 1999. if we restrict analyses to subset of patients detected through hospital surveillance, this situation resembles surveillance scenario 1 above. this is consistent with more detailed contact tracing data that estimated R = 0.48 [21]. both these estimators may be biased upwards as the Bengali situation corresponds to surveillance scenario 2 (i.e., detection of a case may trigger an outbreak investigation) the formula 1G gives point estimates for R (in the range 0.48\u20130.51 depending on the case detection rate) for given values of R and the overdispersion parameter k, it is possible to predict the case detection rate by determining by how much proportion F differs from proportion G. this is a general result that is independent of the case detection rate and the overdispersion parameter k. we estimate R from the proportion F of first detected cases in each cluster that were infected by the reservoir. we find that it takes relatively high levels of case detection () or case-to-case variation in infectiousness (k) to cause substantial deviations. from December 2005 until December 2011, a total of 27 human clusters of swine-origin influenza A variant virus infections were investigated by the CDC in the us. in clusters caused by the H3N2v-M virus, three of six (50%) of the first detected cases were infected by swine compared with 17 of 21 (81%) in clusters caused by the other variant viruses. 0.58 [0.18>1] 0.21 [0.05\u20130.42] 5 0.28 [0.12\u20130.48] 0.56 [0.18>1] 0.16 0.27 [0.11\u20130.46] 0.54 [0.17>1] 0.19 [0.05\u20130.39] 1% 0.5 0.26 [0.11\u20130.45] 0.51

H3N2v-M variant, and 17 for variants other than H3N2v-M. recent efforts at CDC to evaluate the case detection rate suggest that it is low, of the order of 0.5% of all H3N2v-M-attributable cases. the point estimate and 95% lower bound for R for variant viruses other than H3N2v-M remain essentially unchanged but the upper bound increases from 0.4 to 0.4\u20130.6 (Table 1). the point estimate of R for H3N2v-M virus moves from 0.5 to 0.6\u20130.7. estimate 1F always acts as a lower bound estimate of R. a lower bound for R can be obtained if it is possible to specify an upper bound for the case detection rate and a lower bound for the overdispersion parameter k. estimates of the reproduction number R. 1F always acts as a lower bound for R. figure shows lower and upper bound for R as a function of. we specify which correspond to the SARS scenario with superspreading events. easy to derive these statistics for the subset of first detected cases. for G = 0.92\u20130.95, we estimate R = 0.05\u20130.08. this suggests low levels of human-to-human transmission in this first outbreak. the observation that G was close to zero is indicative that transmission in the Dominican Republic was close or above levels needed for sustained human-to-human transmission. the detection of a case did not affect detection of other cases from the same cluster (scenario 1), we assumed that cluster information was not available, and thus F could not be calculated. once R is estimated, it is possible to infer the case detection rate by determining by how much proportion F differs from proportion G. colour triangles show estimates of the case detection rate obtained for each dataset when k is assumed to be known. when k is unknown, vertical colour plain lines give the range of values consistent with k in interval 0.16\u20135. this research project was initiated to answer a seemingly straightforward question. a large part of the population has regular contacts with the natural reservoir. in this case, an in-depth epidemiological investigation of the potential sources of infection is required. proxy measures for the source of transmission (e.g., contacts with the natural reservoir) are often available. if the case detection rate is low, R can be estimated by 1F. a change in the case detection rate is not expected to impact the summary statistic G or the estimate of R. if the source of infection is unknown, different options are available. the CDC changed their recommendations and asked clinicians to obtain respiratory specimens from ill persons with recent swine exposure. in the summer of 2012, ill persons with recent swine exposure may have been more likely to have been tested for H3N2v-M than those without such exposure. we believe that these differences could at least partly be explained by seasonal variations in the ability of the virus to transmit. a zoonotic infection suddenly increased (for example due to seasonal factors or genetic changes in the virus), it might take time for estimates to adjust. future developments of the method could aim to detect sudden changes in the frequency of cases linked to the reservoir. the first detected case of a cluster is infected by the reservoir. we model the number of chains per cluster with a negative binomial distribution with mean ML+1 (where ML = 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12) and overdispersion kL ( = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5), truncated to interval 0\u201330.
