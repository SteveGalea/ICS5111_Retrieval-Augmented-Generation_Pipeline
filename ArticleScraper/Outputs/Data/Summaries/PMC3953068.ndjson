{"summary": "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent in peninsular Malaysia. it has been noted that some G6PD-deficient individuals suffer from more severe clinical presentation of dengue infection. dengue infection is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the tropics and subtropics where as many as 100 million people are infected with 22,000 deaths yearly. there are four serotypes of the virus which are called DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4. deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the most common enzymopathy worldwide. high frequencies (6.0\u201310.8%) of G6PD deficiency have also been reported for Southeast Asian countries. blood was screened for G6PD deficiency using ultraviolet test (Cat #: SQMMR 500, R&D system, Athena-Greece) and G6PD activity was assayed using G6PD kit (Cat #: PD2616, RANDOX Laboratory Antrim, UK) PBMCs were isolated from both G6PD-deficient and normal controls' blood by density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs were then used to isolate primary monocytes using a MACS kit system II. cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 2105cells/well. infected and mock-infected monocytes were harvested and washed twice with cold phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% NaN3. surface labeling was performed by incubating the cells with 100 l (110 diluted) of CD14-PE MAb. cells were fixed and permeabilized in 200 l Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 15 min at room temperature. a minimum of 10,000 events were acquired using a FACS Calibur II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Biosciences, USA) the percentage of deNV2 positive cells was determined from FITC fluorescence histograms using a region that was defined. on of nitric oxide (NO) released from infected monocytes was determined by measuring the stable nitrite using a Greiss reagent assay kit (Cat #: R&D SYSTEM) the absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer. all measurements were performed in duplicates. results of experiments are presented as a percentage of cells with increased superoxide and ROS production or as an increase in the mean fluorescence of induced samples versus controls. p-value was calculated using Student's T test. Error bars were expressed as means SD. deNV2 was titrated using a plaque assay on vero cells (CCL-81 ATCC, USA) PBMCs were then isolated from both G6PD-deficient and normal controls' blood by density gradient centrifugation. cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 2105cells/well and maintained in humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, re-suspended in complete growth medium and cultured at 37\u00b0C/5% of CO2 for five days. conditioned media were harvested at various time points (24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours) post-infection and the number of infected cells and virus titers were determined using flow cytometry. antibody was added to a final concentration of 3.5 g/ml and incubated for 30 minutes on ice in dark. cells were washed twice in Cytoperm/Cytowash solution and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% NaN3. a minimum of 10,000 events were acquired using a FACS Calibur II flow cytometer. cells were overlaid with 1.0 ml of DMEM/10% FBS containing 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and incubated at 37\u00b0C/5% CO2 for 7 days. cells were fixed with freshly prepared cold 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet (AMRESCO, USA) in 20% ethanol for 30 minutes. the viral titers were expressed as plaque forming units (PFU)/ml = [number of at 37\u00b0C/5% of CO2 in RPMI-1640/10% FBS. data analysis and anticipated results were obtained by generating a log FL1 (X-axis) versus a log FL2 (Y-axis) dot plot. results of experiments are presented as a percentage of cells with increased superoxide and ROS production. the mean G6PD activity for G6PD-deficient individuals was 0.2850.26 IU/g Hb, which was significantly lower than the mean activity of G6PD-age matched normal controls (13.562.02 IU/g Hb) the mean G6PD activity for G6PD-deficient individuals was 0.2850.26 IU/g Hb. the peak infection was delayed by 24 hours in monocytes from normal controls. monocytes from G6PD-deficient and normal controls were infected with DENV2 at an MOI of 0.1. number of infected cells assayed by flow cytometry (A) the peak DENV2 titers were detected at an earlier time point (48 hours post infection) in G6PD-deficient monocyte cultures compared to normal control monocyte cultures (72 hours post infection) NO produced until 48 hours post infection, when peak values were reached followed by a decrease. NO released from 16 monocyte cultures showed mean peak levels of 603.75 M L1 at 48 hours post-infection. monocytes produced significantly (p0.001) lower NO than monocytes from normal controls. deNV2 infection of monocytes induced generation of superoxide anions. levels were observed until 24 hours post infection, when peak value reached 70.3%. deNV2 infection of monocytes induced oxidative stress accumulation in normal control and normal controls. in normal control monocyte cultures, oxidative stress accumulation increased until 72 hours post infection. oxidative stress accumulation increased until peak levels of 84.4% were reached. there was a significant moderate, positive correlation (r = 0.476; p = 0.040) between the DENV2-infected cells and NO levels in monocyte from G6PD-deficient subjects. there was also a significant moderate, positive correlation (r = 0.368; p = 0.121) between the DENV2-infected cells and O2 levels in monocyte from G6PD-deficient subjects. G6PD enzyme activity of subjects All 16 G6PD-deficient individuals had less than 10% of normal G6PD activity as measured by the fluorometric assay. the mean G6PD activity for G6PD-deficient individuals was 0.2850.26 IU/g Hb, which was significantly (p0.0001) lower than the mean activity of G6PD-age matched normal controls. PD-deficient subjects exceeded the percentage of DENV2-infected monocytes from normal controls. peak infection was delayed by 24 hours in monocytes from normal controls. the peak DENV2 titers were detected at an earlier time point (48 hours post infection) in G6PD-deficient monocyte cultures compared to normal control monocyte cultures (72 hours post infection) nitric oxide production by monocytes induced the production of NO in both normal control and normal control monocytes. monocytes from both normal controls and G6PD-deficient donors produced significantly (p0.001) lower NO than monocytes from normal controls. deNV2 infection of monocytes induced generation of superoxide anions (O2) in both normal control and normal controls. monocytes produced significantly (p0.001) lower O2 than monocytes from normal controls. deNV2 infection of monocytes induced oxidative stress accumulation in both normal control and G6PD-deficient monocytes (p0.001) in a time dependent manner. there was a significant moderate, positive correlation (r = 0.702; p = 0.001) between the DENV2-infected cells and NO levels in monocyte from G6PD-deficient subjects. there was also a significant moderate, positive correlation (r = 0.476; p = 0.040) between the DENV2-infected cells and O2 levels in monocyte from G6PD-deficient subjects. inhibition of G6PD results in the generation of less reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (super-oxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and NO) in the granulocytes and endothelial cells [17],[18]. recurrence of microbial infections in G6PD deficient individuals has been reported [19]. production of NO and O2 as well as earlier accumulation of oxidative stress contribute significantly to enhanced DENV2 infectivity in monocytes. we have not studied the up-regulation of viral receptors but did clearly see an enhanced production of viral particles. we propose a model for the association between the redox status of the host cells and DENV. a cohort of 89 males diagnosed with DHF was studied to determine if G6PD deficiency was related to occurrence and/or course of dengue infection. a total of 17 (19.1%) DHF patients had G6PD deficiency, thus no significant association established between G6PD deficiency and DHF [15]."}
