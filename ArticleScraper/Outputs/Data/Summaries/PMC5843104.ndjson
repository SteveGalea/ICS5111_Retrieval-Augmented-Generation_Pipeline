{"summary": "MRI examination revealed generalised cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. diffuse T2-weighted hyperintensity of the white matter and meningeal thickening. neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis was confirmed on post-mortem examination. itis, toxoplasmosis, bacterial meningitis, developmental disease (lissencephaly, microencephaly) and degenerative disease (neuroaxonal dystrophy and leukoencephalomyelopathy) biochemistry, including fasting ammonia and pre-prandial bile acids, and haematology were within normal limits. MRI of the brain was performed using a 1.5 T magnet (Philips Ingenia CX) the pachymeninges were mildly and diffusely thickened. the pachymeninges were mildly and diffusely thickened. there were no regions of abnormal contrast enhancement. the cat was euthanased on humane grounds and underwent a full post-mortem examination. a mild dilation of the ventricular system was observed. sections of meninges and relevant areas of the brain and cerebellum were sampled for histopathology. granular material morphologically consistent with lipofuscins Meninges showed diffuse moderate thickening due to deposition of palely eosinophilic mature collagen. all cerebral areas examined showed mild-to-moderate gliosis and moderate loss of neurons. intracytoplasmic vacuoles result markedly positive to Luxol fast blue stain (Figure 3c), moderately positive to periodic acid\u2013Schiff (Figure 3d) and stained red with Masson\u2019 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses represent a heterogeneous group of genetically determined neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases. the disease is characterised by abnormal accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments within the neuronal and extraneural tissue. clinical signs are similar in all species, including humans. autoimmune cause of meningeal thickening has been alluded to. but in the Dachshund, a subdural haematoma was also identified. thickened meninges could represent reactive meningitis. TEM showed the presence of characteristic small curvilinear lamellar stacks and electron-dense granular material, consistent morphologically with previously described intra-neuronal lipofuscins in cats. the cat presented with neurological features in common with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis seen in other species, including humans. the genes involved in the development of feline neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis remain unidentified. in humans and dogs, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is a recessively inherited disease with the progeny of two carrier parents having a one in four chance of developing the disease. ante-mortem diagnosis of feline neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, recruitment of more feline subjects into similar descriptive studies is essential in identifying distinct MRI findings within this population. it could be assumed that the imaging features would be the same or similar in other cases of feline neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."}
