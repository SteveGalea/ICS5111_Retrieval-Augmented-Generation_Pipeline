{"summary": "the term thyroiditis encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by some form of thyroid inflammation. most thyroidologists use the following terms: i/Infectious thyroiditis (which includes all forms of infection, other than viral); ii/Subacute thyroiditis (also called subacute granulomatous thyroiditis and which causes acute illness with severe thyroid pain); iii/Autoimmune thyroid disease which includes Hashimoto's thyroiditis (and subacute thyroiditis has several characteristics typical of viral infections. follicles are often infiltrated, resulting in disrupted basement membrane and rupture of the follicles. clusters of the disease have been reported during outbreaks of viral infection. s of subacute thyroiditis during summer to early autumn was confirmed. no data on infections are available in the paper. a more comprehensive study using different techniques showed no association between foamy-virus infection and thyroiditis in 19 patients. high titers of mumps antibodies have been found in some patients with subacute thyroiditis, and occasionally parotitis or orchitis, usual in mumps, were associated with thyroiditis. in two patients out of 11 with subacute thyroiditis diagnosed during a mumps epidemic, the mumps virus was cultured from thyroid tissue obtained at biopsy [22] serum virus-specific antibodies to measles, rubella, mumps, type I herpes, chicken pox, human parvovirus B19 and CMV were found in 10 patients during the course of illness. changes in the IgG titers were observed for those to measles, rubella, chicken pox or CMV in 4 patients. infections may enhance AITD but may also be protective. the hygiene hypothesis suggests that the immune system is educated by multiple exposures to different infections allowing it to control autoimmune responses better. however, specific infections could be a triggering factor to disease initiation by liberating antigens. in favour of infection references not in favour of infection references Levels of data: Epidemiological antithyroid antibodies following subacute thyroiditis [32,46] euthyroidism: nonspecific autoimmune response. CV [111,112] enterovirus infection during pregnancy [120] measles-mumps-rubella vaccination [51] Serological and/or circulating viral genome HTLV-1 [54-58,60,137] HIAP-1 [78] congenital and acquired rubella [88-90,92-94] EBV [99,100] Parvovirus [104] Direct evidence of infection HTLV-1 [59] HFV [19] rubella [87] CMV [ month of birth was studied in 664 patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism and in 359 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. differences point towards a seasonal viral infection as the initial trigger in the perinatal period, the clinical disease resulting from further specific damage over time. HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus highly endemic in the Caribbean islands, central africa and south-west Japan. HTLV-1 is a human retrovirus highly endemic in the Caribbean islands, central africa and south-west Japan. HTLV-I and HTLV-II proviral load are significantly higher in the peripheral blood of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis than in asymptomatic HTLV carriers. no virus particles were found by electron microscopy. an association between HTLV-I infection and autoimmune thyroiditis may be then strongly suspected. HTLV-I DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in thyroid tissue. HTLV-I was isolated from thyroid tissue by coculture with peripheral blood lymphocytes. a high prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism with 3.5% to 12.2% has been described in patients receiving HAART. autoimmune thyroiditis is more frequent in patients exhibiting these indeterminate HIV-1 Western blots in comparison with a control cohort of HIV-negative blots. some individuals possess antibodies that react to HIV-1 Western blot proteins in patterns different from HIV infection diagnostic. GD was diagnosed in 15 out of 17 patients diagnosed with AITD. one patient developed hashithyrotoxicosis and another, hypothyroidism. regulated T lymphocytes appear to be important in suppressing autoimmune reactions. no HIAP-1 particles are detected by electron microscopy in the H9 cells co-cultured with thyroid preparations of GD. these data call into question the involvement of HIAP-1 in the etiopathogenesis of Graves' disease. three regions of HFV-related sequences were amplified in 29% of the HFV-positive patients. no samples in the control group amplified all three regions. this suggests that these sequences may be used as a tool for screening for HFV in GD patients. thyroid disorders in patients with congenital rubella were first reported in 1975. in 37 subjects affected by or exposed to rubella during fetal life, one patient had diabetes, four patients had clinical hypothyroidism and five patients were positive for TPOAb at the time of the examination. Herpesviridae DNA has been more frequently detected in AITD tissue specimens than in tissue specimens of multinodular goiters. no statistically significant differences were observed. parvovirus B19 is known for causing a childhood exanthem but has also been associated with autoimmune diseases. a few studies have suggested the association of parvovirus infection with thyroiditis. serum tests showed IgM antibodies to human parvovirus B19, but no IgM antibodies to cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, rubella, measles, or Coxsackie viruses. anti-TSH receptor antibody was positive. prevalence of abnormally high levels of anti-thyroid antibodies varied markedly. authors don't find an association between hepatitis C virus and thyroid autoimmunity in susceptible patients. hepatitis C virus may be a cytokine-induced disease in females and positive anti-TPOAb patients prior to initiation of therapy. EV-RNA can be detected by real-time PCR in thyroid tissue. no relationship between presence of EV-RNA and thyroiditis, lymphocytic infiltration or presence of circulating TPOAb was found. maternal enterovirus infection during pregnancy has been linked to thyroiditis. reovirus type 1 genome responsible for induction of autoantibodies to thyroglobulin encodes a polypeptide that binds to surface receptors. an endogenous retrovirus (ev 22) was found to be expressed in obese-strain chickens but not in healthy normal strains. a similar thyroiditis has also been induced in normal chickens by retroviral infection. III/Lymphomas and Riedel's thyroiditis Lymphomas and Riedel's thyroiditis are rare disorders. both can occur in association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. the etiology of Riedel's thyroiditis is not known. preexisting chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is the only known risk factor for primary thyroid lymphoma. preexisting chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is the only known risk factor for primary thyroid lymphoma. six months post partum she had a subacute thyroiditis due to a coxsackie-B virus. two months later the goiter showed further growth, in association with cervical lymphadenopathy and an enlarged left parotid gland. subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland. it is most prevalent in females, usually characterized by a sudden onset of neck pain and thyrotoxicosis. the disease has several characteristics typical of viral infections including a typical viral prodrome with myalgias, malaise and fatigue. the onset of subacute thyroiditis is genetically influenced. it appears that subacute thyroiditis may occur through a susceptibility to viral infection in genetically predisposed individuals. a more comprehensive study using different techniques demonstrated no association between foamy-virus infection and thyroiditis in 19 patients. 59 patients with thyroid disorders, including 28 with Quervain's thyroiditis, were analyzed by different techniques including PCR. there was no prevalence of foamy virus infection in de Quervain patients. the origin of foamy-virus-like agent in the original publications remains unclear. acute thyroiditis, antibody tests, virus isolation and antigen detection were negative. no evidence of viral infections except one patient who had acute CMV infection. cases have implicated \u2013 CMV in an infant with acute infection. clusters of the disease have been reported during outbreaks of viral infection. onset of the disease are observed between June and September. this seasonal distribution is almost identical to that of established infections due to some enteroviruses. 59 patients with thyroid disorders, including 28 with Quervain's thyroiditis, were analyzed by different techniques including PCR. there was no association between foamy-virus infection and thyroiditis in 19 patients. the origin of the foamy-virus-like agent in the original publications remains unclear. patients with subacute thyroiditis showed increases by at least four times in viral antibodies. these viral antibodies included antibodies to mumps virus, but also coxsackie, adenovirus and influenzae. no other antibodies were found against other coxsackies, echoviruses or mumps. changes in the IgG titers were observed for those to measles, rubella, chicken pox or CMV in 4 patients. in an adult female, subacute thyroiditis was diagnosed one month after acute infection suggesting that rubella virus could also be implicated. autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) are frequent [33,34], including Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease. specific infections could be a triggering factor to disease initiation by liberating antigens (via cell destruction or apoptosis), by forming altered antigens or causing molecular mimicry, by cytokine and chemokine secretion. TLRs are a family of cell surface receptors which protect mammals from pathogenic organisms, such as viruses, and are present on non-immune cells. mumps virus [22-24] mumps virus [30] coxsackievirus [24,25,134] enterovirus [26] adenovirus [24,25,134] enterovirus [26] adenovirus [24] HSV-1, [30] EBV [27,28] parvovirus B19 [30] measles, chicken pox, CMV [30] influenzae [14,24] rubella [30,31] CMV [ HTLV1 [62] HIV [65] lack of anti-thyroid antibodies before beginning of HAART [75] Serological and/or circulating viral genome HTLV1 [57,60-62] HIAP-1 [78] HFV [81,84] HFV [81,84] HFV [81,84] HFV [20,82,83] parvovirus [106] HSV, CMV [97] II-A/Epidemiological data subacute thyroiditis is thought to be a virus-associated syndrome. a higher prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies after a mean follow-up interval of 4 years has been observed. however, thyroid autoantibodies appear at low titer only. virus II-B-1-a/Human T lymphotrophic virus-1 (HTLV-1) HTLV-1 is highly endemic in the Caribbean islands, central africa and south-west Japan. two patients who developed Hashimoto's thyroiditis, proven with biopsy, were HTLV-I carriers but had no myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. a case-control study was then conducted to determine the frequency of HTLV-I seropositivity HTLV-I antibody is found in 6% of patients with GD, 7% of patients with chronic thyroiditis, and 2% of patients with nodular goiter. proviral load in HTLV-I-infected patients with GD is significantly higher than in asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. a high prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism with 3.5% to 12.2% has been described in patients receiving HAART. a cross-sectional multicenter study was done to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for hypothyroidism. 22 HIV+ hypothyroid patients and 22 controls receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy were included in additional study. a retrospective analysis of serum samples of a patient with GD revealed lack of anti-thyroid autoantibodies before the beginning of antiretroviral treatment. a special mechanism has been observed \u2013 the immune system recovery. GD was diagnosed in 15 out of 17 patients with AITD. one patient developed hashithyrotoxicosis and another, hypothyroidism. three retroviral structural proteins of HFV \u2013 gag, pol and env \u2013 can be identified by indirect immunofluorescence. the expression of HFV gag proteins has been demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence on the epithelial cells of seven out of seven thyroid glands of patients with GD. it was negative in 9 subacute thyroiditis and 2 normal glands. three regions of HFV-related sequences were amplified in 29% of the HFV-positive patients. no samples in the control group amplified all three regions. this suggests these sequences may be used as a tool for screening for HFV in GD patients. however, the data do represent the possibility that HFV-like sequences may be implicated. m and 359 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism had a distinct pattern of distribution for month of birth compared with the general population. differences point towards a seasonal viral infection as the initial trigger in the perinatal period, the clinical disease resulting from further specific damage over time. seasonal trends, possibly related to epidemic infections, have been described in the diagnosis or relapse of Graves' disease with higher rates in spring and summer [41,42]. Geographical differences have also been described in the incidence of Grave's disease which could be an indirect sign of environmental factors. antibodies were found positive in 2% of patients but hyperthyroidism was not always present. subacute thyroiditis could trigger autoreactive B cells to produce TSH receptor antibodies. no evidence that measles-mumps-rubella vaccination may trigger autoimmunity. HTLV-I and HTLV-I proviral load are significantly higher in the peripheral blood of patients with hashimoto's thyroiditis than in asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. the virus envelope protein and signals for the mRNA were detected in many of the thyrocytes from one of the patients. HTLV-I negative patients with GD nor HTLV-I-positive patients with chronic thyroiditis or nodular goiter developed uveitis [60] provirus load was significantly higher in the uveitis patients with GD than in those without GD [63]. HTLV-I DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the thyroid tissue of an HTLV-I-infected male who was successively afflicted with GD followed by uveit HTLV-I and HTLV-I proviral load are significantly higher in the peripheral blood of patients with hashimoto's thyroiditis than in asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. the virus envelope protein and signals for the mRNA were detected in many of the thyrocytes from one of the patients, by immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization respectively. none of the HTLV-I negative patients with GD nor HTLV-I-positive patients with chronic thyroiditis or nodular goiter developed uveitis [60] provirus load was significantly higher in the uveitis patients with GD than in those without GD [63]. HTLV-I DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the thyroid tissue of an HTLV-I-infected male who was successively afflicted with GD followed by HTLV-I and HTLV-I proviral load are significantly higher in the peripheral blood of patients with hashimoto's thyroiditis than in asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. the virus envelope protein and signals for the mRNA were detected in many of the thyrocytes from one of the patients. none of the HTLV-I negative patients with GD nor HTLV-I-positive patients with chronic thyroiditis or nodular goiter developed uveitis [60] the provirus load was significantly higher in the uveitis patients with GD than in those without GD [63]. HTLV-I DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the thyroid tissue of an HTLV-I-infected male who was successively afflicted with GD followed by HTLV-I and HTLV-II proviral load are significantly higher in the peripheral blood of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis than in asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. the virus envelope protein and signals for the mRNA were detected in many of the thyrocytes from one of the patients. HTLV-I DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in the thyroid tissue of an HTLV-I-infected male who was successively afflicted with GD followed by uveitis. HTLV-I was isolated from thyroid tissue by coculture with peripheral blood lymphocytes. some individuals possess antibodies that react to HIV-1 Western blot proteins. autoimmune thyroiditis is more frequent in patients exhibiting these indeterminate HIV-1 Western blots in comparison with a control cohort of HIV-negative blots. retrospective analysis of serum samples of a patient with GD revealed lack of anti-thyroid autoantibodies before the beginning of antiretroviral treatment. GD was diagnosed in 15 out of 17 patients diagnosed with AITD. one patient developed hashithyrotoxicosis and another, hypothyroidism. only receipt of stavudine and low CD4 cell count were associated with hypothyroidism. 22 HIV+ hypothyroid patients and 22 euthyroid controls receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy were included in an additional study. retrospective analysis of serum samples of a patient with GD revealed lack of anti-thyroid autoantibodies before the beginning of antiretroviral treatment[75] despite many attempts, results to date remain inconclusive concerning a direct role of HIV in the onset of GD. GD patients are absent in patients with hashimoto's thyroiditis and other forms of non-autoimmune thyroid disease. a genetically determined immunological susceptibility has been demonstrated. the class II HLA status allows interactions with HIAP-I exposure. a group of 29 patients with GD and 23 controls were studied. a positive signal with a spumaretrovirus-specific genomic probe was found. the results strongly suggest the existence of an association between GD and the presence of spumaretrovirus related infection markers. moto's thyroiditis has been demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence on the epithelial cells of seven out of seven thyroid glands of patients with GD. it was negative in 9 subacute thyroiditis and 2 normal glands. the retrobulbar tissue of 1 Graves' disease patient with malignant exophthalmus revealed positive staining with anti-gag antibodies in fibroblasts and fat cells. SV40 is a polyomavirus that is found in both monkeys and humans. it is a DNA virus that has the potential to cause tumors but most often persists as a latent infection. SV40 sequences were also investigated in normal thyroid tissues. the mechanisms proposed for thyroid dysfunction are destruction of thyroid cells by local persistent rubella virus infection, precipitation of an autoimmune reaction, or both. the mechanisms proposed for thyroid dysfunction are destruction of thyroid cells by local persistent rubella virus infection. HHV6 and HHV7 circulating DNA was searched in sixty patients paired to 60 controls. patients 72TP53 Pro/Pro variants had 5 times more chance to develop GD and almost three times more chance to be infected by HHV7. antibodies against EBV viral capsid antigen (IgG-VCA) and antibodies against early antigen (IgG-EA-D/DR) have been more often found in thyroiditis than in controls. acute EBV infection with severe primary hypothyroidism was described in a 16-year old female. intraathyroidal persistence of human parvovirus B19 DNA with PCR has been detected for the first time in a patient with hashimoto's thyroiditis. the cell types responsible for the B19 DNA persistence are not determined and immune cells infiltrating the thyroid may be the source of B19 DNA. however, the possibility that thyroid epithelial cells harbor B19 DNA cannot be excluded. intraathyroidal persistence of human parvovirus B19 DNA with PCR has been detected for the first time in a patient with hashimoto's thyroiditis. the cell types responsible for the B19 DNA persistence are not determined and immune cells infiltrating the thyroid may be the source of B19 DNA. however, the possibility that thyroid epithelial cells harbor B19 DNA cannot be excluded. discordant data are published about hepatitis. the prevalence of abnormally high levels of anti-thyroid antibodies varied markedly. the prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease in patients with HCV differs from that in patients with the hepatitis B virus. a substantial number of patients with SARS have shown abnormalities in thyroid function. it has been supposed that SARS could have a harmful effect on the thyroid gland. however, low serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels associated with decreased TSH concentration are in favor of central hypothyroidism induced by hypophysitis or by hypothalamic dysfunction. the age at diagnosis of AITD was significantly lower in the group of children with IgM-positive mothers compared with children with IgM-negative mothers. hypothyroidism was significantly more frequent in the IgM-positive group, with no child in the IgM-negative group. a hereditary spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis is characterized histologically by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland. a similar thyroiditis has also been induced in normal chickens by retroviral infection. a similar thyroiditis has also been induced in normal chickens by retroviral infection. relationship between presence of EV-RNA and thyroiditis, lymphocytic infiltration or presence of circulating TPOAb is not associated with autoimmune thyroiditis. EV-RNA was detected in one patient with a normal thyroid. an endogenous retrovirus (ev 22) was found to be expressed in obese-strain (OS) chickens but not in healthy normal strains. a similar thyroiditis has also been induced in normal chickens by retroviral infection. III-A/Riedel's thyroiditis Fibrous thyroiditis is characterized by extensive fibrosis and mononuclear infiltration that extends into adjacent tissues. it may consist in a primary fibrosing disorder or in the local involvement of a multifocal fibrosclerosis. the etiology of Riedel's thyroiditis is not known. preexisting chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is the only known risk factor for primary thyroid lymphoma. the disease is characterized by extensive fibrosis and mononuclear infiltration that extends into adjacent tissues. the etiology of Riedel's thyroiditis is not known. preexisting chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is the only known risk factor for primary thyroid lymphoma. a patient with autoimmune thyroiditis had a transitory recurrence of her goiter during pregnancy with TPOAb becoming strongly positive. a study was carried out to examine whether thyroid non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an area in which adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is not endemic is also exclusively of B-cell type. eight cases with thyroid non-Hodgkin's lymphoma admitted to the hospital situated in an ATL-endemic area were studied. no thyroid lymphoma has been reported in these patients. a viral disease is the result of an interaction between a virus and the host. it cannot be excluded that a virus plays a role in a disease even though most infected individuals do not show any sign of disease. authors declare that they have no competing interests. this work was supported by a regional PHRC (PHRC Regional 2005), CHU Amiens, CHRU Lille, Minist\u00e8re de l'Education Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie, Universit\u00e9 de Lille II, France."}
