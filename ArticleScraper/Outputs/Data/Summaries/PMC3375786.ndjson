{"summary": "Methods We used fluSurge 2.0 (17) and a computer model in an Excel file developed by one of the authors to calculate the impact of an influenza pandemic in the Netherlands on hospital admission and occupancy rate. data on population (1.7 million) and age distribution (Table 1) were obtained from publicly available sources. the age distribution in the Dutch population data were provided in 5-year groupings. 92,241 45,885 127,674 136,915 81,212 483,927 Total 316,480 188,996 466,813 461,105 267,695 1,701,089 We calculated the total number of patients admitted to the hospitals at each point in time during the pandemic. we incorporated estimated risk of death per patient, reducing the number of admitted patients at any one time. in the northern part of the Netherlands 5,629 regular hospital beds are available. we assumed that 25%\u201350% of total hospital admission patients would require some form of mechanical ventilation. a maximum of 136 (of a total of 200) ICU beds could be dedicated to influenza-related acute care patients. we would have a shortage of 3 ICU beds at day 28 after onset, when we expect the pandemic to peak. this shortage is exacerbated with any increase in hospital length of stay or ICU length of stay. we used the representative case scenario estimate data, i.e., 30% attack rate and a mean length of stay of 8 days, and show the effect of intensified treatment decision resulting in reduction of ICU occupancy by 5% and 20%. we made sensitivity analyses, with changing assumptions within the model. we show that an influenza pandemic can be managed even allowing emergency care for non-influenza-related acute cases. without withdrawing or withholding life support to those deemed to have no realistic chance of survival, the system is bound to collapse. we recognize the ethical impact this has on clinicians and nurses who have to make these decisions. we based our model on incomplete and sometimes conflicting or inconsistent information on the impact of an influenza pandemic. the effect of antiviral medications, vaccination campaigns, and closure of schools and airports may alter the key characteristics of the pandemic. even a less-than-perfect vaccine might have a tremendous impact on the course of the pandemic. s has not been prospectively tested, they might protect persons from contracting respiratory viral disease. in our hospital protocol for management of patients of new pandemic influenza, we have included extensive measures to separate these patients from other patients."}
