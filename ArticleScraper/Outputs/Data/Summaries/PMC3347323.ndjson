{"summary": "coVs are enveloped RNA viruses causing respiratory and enteric diseases. the virus enters and infects lumenal macrophages and epithelial cells. the cell entry programs for these viruses are orchestrated by the viral spike (S) proteins. atomic\u2013resolution structures are known for domains comprising 20% of the SARS and MHV S proteins. these include the receptor binding domains (RBDs) which are part of the N-terminal \u201cS1\u201d half of the primary S sequence. the other atomically-resolved structures amount to a small portion of the C-terminal half of the primary S sequence. the virion membrane is enriched with viral membrane proteins. the spikes protrude about 20 nm from the limiting virion membrane. a single S protein is depicted as a rectangle. the postfusion HR1-HR2 bundle is depicted as alpha carbon tracings. each of the three HR1-HR2 are a distinguished by color. to enhance the display, a single HR1-HR2 is extracted from the image and included below the 6-stranded bundle. refolding of regions between FPs and TM spans into postfusion 6-HB configuration. structural elements participating in these later steps include a hydrophobic tryptophan-rich region at the boundary between TM spans and ectodomains. at the completion of membrane fusion, FPs and TMs are hypothesized to be adjacent to each other. this review are organized according to the events of the CoV infection cycle. the beginning stage is in the endoplasmic reticulum of virus-producing cells. the ER-localized assembly into trimers is a slow process, taking approximately 15 min to generate the greater than 500-kilodalton glycoprotein complexes. the coV infection process establishes novel exocytic routes, perhaps with distended organelles able to accommodate secretion of very large S and CoV virion cargo. the trans-Golgi network houses acid pH-activated serine proteases that cleave some S proteins at positions immediately C-terminal to multibasic cleavage sites. only a subset of CoVs have S proteins with the multibasic cleavages. only a select few have the consensus K/R-X-K/R-K/R motif at the P4-P1 position. in most CoV infections, S protein populations are left intact or are only partially cleaved in virus-producing cells. reduced furin activities greatly reduce S cleavages without diminishing virus infectivities. adsorption to heparan sulfate can be proviral in tissue culture and antiviral in vivo, making for complex selective forces impinging on multibasic S peptide motifs. the cleavage site is distant from any hydrophobic peptides, hundreds of residues from the presumed fusion peptide. this positioning is clearly unlike the analogous cleavage sites on influenza hemagglutinin and HIV gp160 the coV receptors include integral-membrane proteins and sugars that, as a group, have no obvious structural similarities. this variation presents interesting questions regarding which receptors are simply mediating CoV adsorption and which might be doing more. a role for the receptor in guiding bound viruses into particular endocytic organelles is not absolutely essential. the findings are valuable in considering coV receptor switching as it relates to host range and zoonotic infection potential. the findings are valuable in considering coV receptor switching as it relates to host range and zoonotic infection potential. the MHVs, having CEACAM-binding sites on NTDs, readily delete CTD segments during passage in tissue culture. a dual RBD architecture may correlate with in vivo tropism and virulence, likely due to complexity of multiple receptor interactions. soluble receptors were found to catalyze S1 release, a readily observed conformational change. soluble receptors were then found to support infectious MHV entry into CEACAM-negative cells. the MHV model system divulges relatively stable CEACAM receptor-induced S conformations. the role of ACE2 and APN receptors in triggering structural transitions of human CoVs is less clear. it is unclear whether ACE2 binding to SARS or NL63 S proteins dissociates RBDs from fusion modules. ACE2-bound S proteins are set up for proteolytic scissions that activate membrane fusion. some coVs do not endocytose but rather enter by fusion directly at the plasma membrane. syncytial developments increased in slightly alkaline media, suggesting no need for endosomal acid exposures to activate fusions. but none of these observations necessarily confirm that CoVs naturally enter cells via fusion at the plasma membrane. coVs generally use cellular endocytic machinery during entry. clathrin-mediated endocytosis for human 229E-CoV [69], clathrin-mediated endocytosis for MHV [70], clathrin-mediated endocytosis for feline CoV [71]. clathrin-mediated endocytosis for MHV [42], clathrin-mediated endocytosis for feline coVs are bathed in an acidic and often proteolytic environment. it is unclear whether protons are the endosomal factor triggering fusion per se. acid pH-activated endosomal proteases may be the more likely triggers. ectodomains were cleaved by cathepsin L at the S1-S2 position (CS1 in Figure 1) [81]. this made it appear that, depending on the CoV strain, S cleavage at CS1 either takes place early in the infection cycle, by furin-like serine proteases in the trans-Golgi network of virus-producing cells, with similar ultimate outcomes. the findings are consistent with a model in which S proteins are cleaved multiply, likely first at the CS1 (S1-S2) position, and then at CS2 positions adjacent to the FP. the CS2 proteolytic removal of sequences that are N-terminal to the FP may permit the rapid completion of the S refolding events that generate membrane fusion and the 6-HB configuration. the TTSPs may reside in plasma membrane microdomains, although this possibility is not yet validated. they may be available to incoming viruses at the receptor-interaction stage, to cleave at the CS1 and/or CS2 positions. the roles of these domains in viral glycoprotein cleavage are unknown. TMPRSS2 cleavage may also contribute to immune evasion. TMPRSS2 releases S fragments that bind and incapacitate neutralizing antibodies. another TTSP, human airway Trypsin-like Protease, has brought out enlightening details. the first paper to examine TTSPs in the context of SARS entry found that TMPRSS11a was capable of slightly enhancing SARS entry at low levels of the protease. TMPRSS2 was a more potent activator of entry at low levels of the protease, but none have exceeded TMPRSS2 in augmenting SARS-CoV entry. a human monoclonal antibody was created in transgenic mice that produce human immunoglobulins. anti-SARS antibodies can permit virus entry via Fc receptors, bypassing the ACE2-dependent entry route and actually enhancing disease. other potential anti-human CoV lectins include the mannose-binding lectin. some of the proteases described in this paper are potential antiviral therapeutic targets. furin-inhibiting peptides arrest cell-cell fusions mediated by coronaviruses MHV and IBV (infectious bronchitis virus) a cocktail of serine protease inhibitors reduced influenza infection and subsequent disease in mice and in humans [109,110] it is possible that the antiviral aprotinin target was TMPRSS2, given that TMPRSS2 is abundant in lungs and that aprotinin cannot penetrate the plasma membrane. peptide-based fusion inhibitors could be combined with lectins. HR2 peptides cover a broad viral target and thus impose barriers against virus mutational escape routes. a multifaceted approach to SARS entry inhibition would be the most likely to succeed. coV research will continue to reveal features of virus operating mechanisms. TTSP inhibitors may be suitable therapeutics for a variety of respiratory viruses that rely on proteolysis for cell entry."}
