{"summary": "sensitivity of two rapid influenza virus tests for the detection of influenza virus A/H1N1/2009 averaged 21% (6). respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) rapid antigen sensitivity as low as 59% has been reported (7). amplification-based technologies have been developed for respiratory virus detection. other assays offer limited multiplex testing, such as for influenza viruses and RSV (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA; Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL; and Hologic Gen-Probe) other assays offer limited multiplex testing, such as for influenza viruses and RSV and metapneumovirus (Quidel) studies have found overall sensitivities and specificities of 89.4% and 99.6% for the filmArray RP (8), 95.4% and 99.7% for the eSensor RVP (9), 91.2% and 99.7% for the xTAG RVPv1 (10), and 78.8% and 99.6% for the xTAG RVP fast (11). asopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens (n = 300) were collected from 294 symptomatic patients. positive (n = 161) and negative (n = 39) retrospective specimens (n = 200) were collected between august 2007 and November 2011. consecutive specimens (n = 100) were collected in January 2012. all NP swabs were tested with the four respiratory viral panels according to their respective package inserts. extraction, when required, was performed within 24 h of the samples being thawed. samples were kept at 4\u00b0C until all testing was complete. the xTAG assays were considered one platform (xTAG RVPv1 and xTAG RVP fast) for the purposes of defining a true positive. we previously determined that the enterovirus LDT does not cross-react with rhinovirus (RhV) s were tested at the time of collection by the method requested by the clinician. the consecutive specimens were initially assayed using the xTAG RVPv1. routine NP swabs in viral transport medium were used for all NP specimens collected starting in 2009. bacteriophage lambda was used as a run control for the xTAG assays. the filmArray RP contained its own internal controls within each pouch. time studies were conducted independently logging elapsed times for each step of the assay. the interpretation of results was performed according to the individual package inserts. the prodesse ProFAST+ assay (Hologic Gen-Probe) was performed according to the protocol of Lu and Erdman (22). sensitivity and specificity were determined by student's t test using GraphPad Prism 6.0. positive NP specimens were selected to represent as many of the targets as possible. ivity per target for each of the four respiratory viral panels as determined using NP swabs Virus No. of true-positive specimens (n = 300 specimens tested) % Sensitivity (95% CI) of: FilmArray RP eSensor RVP xTAG RVPv1 RVP fast AdV 35 57.1 (40.8, 72.0) 100 (88.2, 100) 74.3 (57.8, 86.0) 82.9 (66.9, 92.3) the filmArray RP had sensitivities greater than 92% for the following targets. AdV (57.1%), influenza virus A H1/2009 (73.3%), influenza virus B (77.3%), RSV A (86.4%), and RhV/EV (83.7%) were detected with less sensitivity by the filmArray. the overall specificities (95% CIs) for the eSensor RVP, xTAG RVPv1 and xTAG RVP fast tests were 99.2% (95.4, 100), 99.8% (96.0, 100), and 99.9% (96.1, 100), respectively. twenty-one of the dual positives involved RhV/EV. all AdV-positive samples (n = 35) were typed by sequencing the hexon gene. the eSensor RVP detected 100% of adenovirus-positive specimens. xTAG RVP fast missed one specimen each of AdV type 1 and 3. the filmArray RP and the xTAG assays show cross-reactivity between RhV and EV. the eSensor RVP is specific for RhV, while the eSensor RVP is specific for RhV. archived retrospective specimens were selected to challenge the sensitivities of the assays. positive NP specimens were selected to represent as many of the targets as possible. of 200 specimens, 161 (80.5%) were consensus positives.

Table 3. Combinations of multiple viruses identified during the study. the eSensor RVP detected 100% of adenovirus-positive specimens. the eSensor RVP detected all of the AdV type 3 and 4 specimens. the filmArray RP detected all of the AdV type 3 and 4 specimens. xTAG RVP fast missed one specimen each of AdV type 1 and. three false-negative eSensor RVP RhV specimens were positive by our enterovirus-specific LDT. the xTAG RVP fast and filmArray RP showed higher sensitivities for the 18-year age group than for the 18-year age group. the age group that had the lowest sensitivity (85.5%) was the 5-year group. Table 5 shows the four assays as they compare in terms of hands-on time, time to result, and number of steps (as an indicator of ease of use). the assay's AdV sensitivity was significantly lower than those of the eSensor (P 0.0001) and xTAG RVP fast (P = 0.13); its influenza virus A/H1N1/2009 sensitivity was lower than those of the eSensor. the filmArray RP was significantly more sensitive than the xTAG RVP fast for influenza virus B (P 0.05), and there were no statistically significant differences in sensitivity rates between the assays for RSV A or RhV/EV. the filmArray RP was 100% specific. the increased sensitivity of the eSensor RVP is countered by a lower specificity than the other three assays (P 0.05). if the false positives represent increased analytical sensitivity, greater variability in assay performance, or the ease with which runs can be contaminated cannot be determined. the xTAG RVP assay provides quantitative results in median fluorescent intensity (MFI) units, but the test is only intended to provide qualitative results. however, specimens with high titers of PIV3 also caused a positive PIV1 signal; thus, the ratio of these signals must be assessed in determining PIV3 calls. the sensitivities were below 92% for all targets but MPV and RhV/EV, and importantly, the influenza virus B sensitivity was 45.5%. xTAG RVPv1 and xTAG RVP fast will subtype influenza virus A-positive samples as seasonal H1 or seasonal H3. four samples initially showed influenza virus A-positive/subtype-negative results by the eSensor RVP. the respiratory season (2011-2012) during which the study was performed was not as robust as past seasons. however, the numbers per target included in the consecutive study are relatively low, making it difficult to ascertain the significance of differing performance among the assays in a true clinical setting. the same trends in sensitivity were observed in both the retrospective specimens and the archived, consecutive specimens. the chemistry for target detection and the threshold for positivity (3 nA) are the same as for the in vitro diagnostics version. a significant consideration for clinical laboratories is the comparison of the relative costs of these assays."}
