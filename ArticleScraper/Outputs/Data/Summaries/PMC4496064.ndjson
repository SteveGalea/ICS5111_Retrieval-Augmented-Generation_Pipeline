{"summary": "data on influenza from country-level surveillance can show the distribution of disease among the population and identify groups at high risk of infection. this information can subsequently help policy makers make evidence-based decisions on how to target influenza treatment and prevention programs. some populations within the country have a disproportionately higher level of exposure to risk factors for communicable disease. all data that was analyzed was de-identified and consent was obtained from all patients before they were enrolled into surveillance. non-hospitalized SARI includes cases from the population that do not reach the hospital due to health care access barriers. CHBAH is a large public academic hospital in the Soweto Township in Gauteng, south africa. it serves approximately 1.4 million lower income south african individuals. the rates of hospitalized SARI cases in Soweto were obtained by dividing the estimated number of SARI cases by the mid-year study population estimates by age group and HIV status. between 4,000 and 6,000 community members were surveyed in each of the two sites as part of a cross-sectional door-to-door household survey. the ratio of those that sought care to those that did not was applied to the rate of hospitalized SARI to get the rate of non-hospitalized SARI in the base province. risk factors included exposure to indoor air pollution, crowding, malnutrition, low birth-weight and non-exclusive breastfeeding. s were estimated using the provincial prevalence of known risk factors for pneumonia as described for the hospitalized cases. we adjusted the provincial rates by the proportion of ARI not seeking care in the given province to the proportion of ARI cases not seeking care in the given province using health and demographic surveys. data on the proportion of SARI cases that were influenza-associated was pooled across surveillance sites to give an average percentage that was applied to all provinces. estimates included the SARI rates in the base province, the influenza detection rate among SARI cases and the prevalence of the provincial risk factors. the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals were the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of these estimates. population-based surveillance is implemented at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH) in Gauteng Province. it serves approximately 1.4 million lower income south african individuals. between 4,000 and 6,000 community members were surveyed in each of the two sites. they asked if they had a severe pneumonia in the past year. the ratio of those that sought care to those that did not was applied to the rate of hospitalized SARI to get the rate of non-hospitalized SARI in the base province. a downward adjustment factor (less than one) resulted in a decrease in SARI incidence in the province relative to Soweto (Gauteng Province) we adjusted the provincial rates by the proportion of ARI not seeking care in the given province to the proportion of ARI cases not seeking care in the given province. the rates of hospitalized SARI cases in Soweto were obtained by dividing the estimated number of SARI cases by the mid-year study population estimates by age group and HIV status. the population of Soweto represents approximately 11% of the population of Gauteng Province (referred thereafter as the base Province) estimates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARI rates were derived by adjusting the soweto (Gauteng Province) SARI incidence rates for the provincial-level prevalence of known risk factors for pneumonia. risk factors included exposure to indoor air pollution, crowding, malnutrition, low birth-weight and non-exclusive breastfeeding; the last three were only included as risk factors for children under five years of age. non-hospitalized SARI rates were multiplied by the percent of SARI associated with influenza virus from surveillance. data on the percent of SARI due to influenza by age group in separate HIV-infected and-uninfected populations were pooled from all sentinel surveillance sites to give an average percentage that was used in the calculations. base province and the proportion of ARI cases seeking care in each province form the DHS. highest rates of SARI in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected populations were among children under five years of age. incidence rate of SARI in the HIV-infected population was consistently greater than the incidence in the HIV-uninfected population for all age groups. influenza-associated SARI rates were highest among the oldest age group (>45 years) for HIV-infected (range 143\u2013266 per 100,000 person-years) and HIV-uninfected populations (20\u201354 per 100,000 person-years) among adults, influenza-associated SARI rates were highest among the oldest age group (>45 years) for HIV-infected.

extrapolating incidence rates from one surveillance site in one province to the rest of the provinces of south africa. we assumed that the relative risk of SARI for the different risk factors
