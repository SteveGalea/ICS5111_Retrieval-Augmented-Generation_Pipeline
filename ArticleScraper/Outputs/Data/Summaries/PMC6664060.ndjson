{"summary": "the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) plays a pivotal role in activating T-cell immune responses by presenting antigen peptides on antigen-presenting cells. the residues in the peptide-binding grooves (PBGs) of HLA molecules are highly polymorphic. this determines the peptide-binding motifs and subsequent T-cell immunity features of people with different HLA types. based on the current definition, alleles from the A*30 serotype possess different peptide-binding motifs and belong to distinct HLA supertypes including HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*26:01, HLA-A*30:03, and HLA-A*32:01. HLA-A*30:01 was classified as an A24 supertype based on sequence and biological data (5). but was later reclassified as an A1 supertype using clustering of specificity matrices (6). others proposed that HLA-A*30:01 belonged to the A1A3 supertype. NP44 (CTELKLSDY) derived from influenza virus nucleocapsid protein (residues 44\u201352), RT313 (AIFQSSMTK) from the HIV reverse transcriptase (residues 313\u2013321) and MTB (QIMYNYPAM) from mycobacterium tuberculosis protein TB10.4 were synthesized and purified to 90% by reverse-phase HPLC and mass spectrome name Sequencea Refoldingb A*30:01 A*30:03 MTB QIMYNYPAM \u2013 + MTB-M9K QIMYNYPAK + \u2013 MTB-M9R QIMYNYPAY \u2013 + MTB-M9F QIMYNYPAF \u2013 + MTB-M9V QIMYNYPAV \u2013 + MTB-M9S QIMYNYPAS \u2013 + a Underlined boldface residues plasmid for human 2 microglobulin (2m) was synthesized and cloned into pET21a (+) vectors. the expression plasmid for human 2 microglobulin (2m) is marked as +, otherwise as \u2013. the inclusion bodies of human leukocyte antigen I (HLA I) complexes were refolded at a molar ratio of 1:1:3 in dilution refolding buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0; 400 mM L-arginine, 5 mM EDTA-Na, 5 mM glutathione, and 0.5 mM glutathione disulfide) at 4\u00b0C for at least crystals of HLA-A*30:03/MTB were grown at 20 mg/mL in 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate (pH 5.5) and 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8,000. single crystals of HLA-A*30:03/MTB were grown at 20 mg/mL in 0.2 M potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, 0.1 M Tri-sodium citrate dihydrate (pH extensive model building was performed manually using the COOT program (29) and restrained refinement was performed using the REFMAC5 program (30). the stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed with the program, REFINE, in Phenix (31). peptides from the M (GenBank: AJD12325.1), NP (GenBank: AJJ90589.1), and PB1 (GenBank: ARG44354.1) proteins of the avian influenza virus strain H7N9. we selected 215 candidate peptides for binding to HLA-A*30:01 and 50 candidate peptides for binding to HLA-A*30:03. other peptides used in this paper were synthesized and purified in the same way.

ACA34998.1), and HLA-A*30:03 (GenBank accession no. ANG08799.1) were synthesized. proteins were concentrated and exchanged into the protein buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 50 mM NaCl) and purified by gel filtration chromatography using a SuperdexTM 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Beijing, China) single crystals of HLA-A*30:03/MTB were grown at 20 mg/mL in 0.2 M potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate, 0.1 M Tri-sodium citrate dihydrate (pH 5.6) and 2.0 M ammonium sulfate monohydrate. crystals were transferred to reservoir solutions containing 20% glycerol and then flash-frozen in a stream of gaseous nitrogen at 100 K. the proportion of denatured protein was calculated from the mean residue ellipticity (u) using a standard method: Fraction unfolded ( % ) / ( U - N ) where N and U are the mean residue ellipticity values in the fully folded and fully unfolded states. protein structure Accession Numbers The accession numbers of HLA-A*30:01/RT313, HLA-A*30:03/RT313, HLA-A*30:03/NP44, and HLA-A*30:03/MTB in the PDB are 6J1W, 6J1V, 6J2A, and 6J29 respectively. RT313 also formed stable complexes with both HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:03 in vitro. a recombinant MHC class I molecule renature assay has shown that MTB (QIMYNYPAM) is presented by HLA-A*30:01. the binding capabilities and overall structures of HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:03 were elucidated by in vitro refolding assays. amino acids that differed between HLA-A*30:01 (green) and HLA-A*30:03 (salmon) are shown as sticks. we found that HLA-A*30:03 could present MTB-M9Y, MTB-M9F, MTB-M9I, MTB-M9V, and MTB-M9L peptides with A1 supertype binding motifs. however, it could not present MTB-M9R (Table 2, Supplemental Figure 3) HLA-A*30:01 possesses more features of A3 supertype compared to HLA-A*30:03. the overall structures of these four complexes showed typical MHC I conformations. 313 A*30:03/NP44 A*30:03/MTB Data processing Space group P212121 C2 C2 Cell parameters (a) 79.27 52.26 155.74 155.82 b () 72.03 72.13 79.42 79.49 c (\u00b0) 78.01 124.68 44.74 44.82 (\u00b0) 90.00 90.00 90.00 (\u00b0) 90.00 90.00 93.74 94.04 (\u00b0) b Rmerge = hkli|IiI|hkli Ii, where Ii is the observed intensity, and Iis the average intensity of multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections. c R = hkl||Fobs|k|Fcal||/hkl|Fobs|, where Rfree is calculated for a randomly chosen 5% of reflections, and Rwork is calculated for the remaining 95% of reflections. His116 in HLA-A*11:01 and HLA-A*30:03 could also form hydrogen bonds with positively-charged anchor Lys. the NZ-atom of P-Lys also formed direct hydrogen bonds with Asp77 in HLA-A*11:01 and HLA-A*30:03. HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:03 contain a His at position 116, which differed from HLA-A*11:01, which had Asp at this position. both His116 and Asp116 could form a hydrogen bond with the positively charged anchor, Lys. both His116 in HLA-A*30:03 and Asp116 in HLA-A*01:01 could form hydrogen bonds with the P residues of MTB and NP44. Residues 74, 77, 114, and 116 are shown as sticks under the vacuum electrostatic surface. s 74, 77, and 116 were the negatively charged acidic amino acid, Asp. residue 77 was different between HLA-A*01:01 (Asn77) and the A3 supertype alleles (Asp77) the difference in the charge of the F pockets between the A1 and A3 supertypes was one of the main reasons for their different binding motifs. negative charge of the HLA-A*30:03 F pocket was between that of the A3 supertype and the A1 supertype alleles. this allowed the F pocket to accommodate both the basic amino acids preferred by the A3 supertype and the aromatic and large hydrophobic amino acids preferred by the A1 supertype. polymorphisms between HLA-A*30:03 and HLA-A*01:01 were located at the 1 and 2 domains. structure-based sequence alignment of HLA-A*30:03 and HLA-A*01:01 addressing the 1 and 2 domains.

Cylinders indicate -helices and black arrows indicate -strands. 134 HLA-A*30 serotype alleles available in the international. residues 74, 114, and 116 of A*30 serotype are highly conserved. residue 77 is either Asp or Asn (Supplemental Tables 1, 2). HLA-A*30:01-carrying populations are mainly located in africa. RT313 (AIFQSSMTK) is presented by HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*03:01, and HLA-A*68:01, which all belong to the A3 supertype (13, 19), while NP44 (CTELKLSDY) is a typical epitope presented by the A1 supertype allele, HLA-A*01:01 (17). NP44 could bind HLA-A*30:03 but not HLA-A*30:01 in vitro. no binding was observed between MTB and HLA-A*30:03 in co-refolding experiments. RT313 was able to bind both HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:03. amino acids that differed between HLA-A*30:01 (green) and HLA-A*30:03 (salmon) are shown as sticks. authentic conformations of peptides RT313 (D) in the HLA-A*30:01 grooves and MTB (E), NP44 (F) and RT313 (G) in the HLA-A*30:03 grooves are shown as sticks. HLA-A*30:01 could present only those mutated peptides that contained A3 supertype binding motifs MTB-M9K and MTB-M9R (Table 2, Supplemental Figure 3). however, only 23 peptides were published with defined assays. we determined the structures of HLA-A*30:01/RT313, HLA-A*30:03/RT313, and HLA-A*30:03/MTB at 1.5, 2, 1.4, and 1.6 respectively. the overall structures of these four complexes showed typical MHC I conformations. the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the overall structures of these four complexes was 0.591, which indicated that these two molecules were extremely similar. 50.0\u20131.5 (1.55\u20131.50)a 50.0\u20132.0 (2.07\u20132.00) 50.0\u20131.4 (1.45\u20131.40) 50.0\u20131.6 (1.66\u20131.60) Total reflections 905897 237620 723559 493978 Unique reflections 71391 32751 106161 72173 Completeness (%) 99.1 (91.8) 99.8 (99.9) 99.3 (99.9) 99.7 (100.0) Rmerge (%)b 6.2 the alignment of these three structures showed a similar overall conformation of the presented peptide, RT313, in the PBGs. the binding modes of the P-Lys residue of RT313 in the F pockets of these three molecules were quite similar. the NZ-atom of P-Lys formed direct hydrogen bonds with Asp77 in HLA-A*11:01 and HLA-A*30:01 and with Asn77 in HLA-A*30:03. similar anchoring modes of A3 supertype peptide in the F pockets of HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:03 are shown. the P residues of MTB (Met) and NP44 (Tyr) could also form stable hydrogen bonds with the residues in the F pocket of HLA-A*30:03/NP44. additional water molecules can help the P-Tyr of peptide NP44 bind to Asp74 and Asn77 in an helix. Arg114 of HLA-A*30:01 pointed to the \u201cmouth\u201d of the F pocket. the side chain of Glu114 in HLA-A*30:03 was shorter than that of Arg114. the strength of the negative charge of the F pocket of HLA-A*30:03 was between those in A3 and A1 supertype alleles. residue 77 was different between HLA-A*01:01 (Asn77) and the A3 supertype alleles (Asp77) the difference in the charge of the F pockets between the A1 and A3 supertypes was one of the main reasons for their binding motifs. this suggests that residue 77 plays a key role in the definition of different supertypes. polymorphisms between HLA-A*30:03 and HLA-A*01:01 were located at the 1 and 2 domains. polymorphic residues included negatively charged Glu vs. small Ala at position 76, a small Val vs. smaller Ala at position 150, longer Arg vs. small Ala at position 152, and nucleophilic Thr vs. positively charged Arg at position 163 of HLA-A*30: sequence alignment was generated with Clustal X (33) and ESPript (34). the overall conformations of NP44 in HLA-A*30:03 and HLA-A*01:01 were very similar. however, P3-Glu, P5-Lys, and P7-Ser showed slightly different conformations. the side chain of P3-Glu, P5-Lys, and P7-Ser point to different orientations in HLA-A*01:01/NP44 and HLA-A*30:03/NP44 respectively. Arg156 formed a salt bridge with P3-Glu, which resulted in a subtle difference in the conformation of P3-Glu. however, no hydrogen bond was seen between leu156 and P7-Ser in HLA-A*30: we mutated Asp77 to Asn77 in HLA-A*30:01 and Asn77 to Asp 77 in HLA-A*30:03 (mutant, mutated HLA-A*30:01D77N) as in the binding assays, peptide RT313 could be presented by both mutated HLA molecules. however, in comparison to wild type HLA-A*30:01, the binding capacity of HLA-A*30:01 binding ability of the F pocket of HLA-A*30:01 and HLA-A*30:03 shifted in opposite directions after mutation of residue 77. residue 77 is the key position involved in determining binding motifs. binding capabilities of peptides with HLA-A*30:01, HLA-A*30:03, and mutants HLA-A*30:01D77N. asp77 in the F pocket of MHC I from different vertebrates may play a key role in the binding of peptides with Lys or Arg at the P residue. chicken MHC I BF2*14:01 (PDB code: 4CW1), feline MHC I FLA-E*018:01 (PDB code: 5XMF), and rat MHC I RT1-Aa (PDB code: 1ED3) prefer peptides with positive charged Residues 74, 77, and 116 are shown as sticks under vacuum electrostatic surface. the hydrogen bonds between P of peptides and residues 74, 77, or 116 are represented as red dashed lines. there are totally 134 HLA-A*30 serotype alleles available in the international Immunogenetics Information System. HLA-A*30:02 and -A*30:04-carrying populations are mainly located in africa. the highest frequency (23.3%) of HLA-A*30:02 occurs in Lusaka, Zambia. the binding motif of the F pocket of HLA-A*30:03 preferred only those residues with A1 supertype binding motifs (Tyr, Met, Phe, Ile, and Leu) the binding motif of the F pocket of HLA-A*30:03 preferred only those residues with A1 supertype binding motifs (Tyr, Met, Phe, Ile, and Leu) the real binding motifs of the F pockets of HLA-A*30:01 (C) and HLA-A*30:03 (D) were verified experimentally. residue 77 in the F pocket may be the key residue for determining different binding motifs of A1, A1A3 and A3 supertype alleles. the cross-presentation of peptides from both A1 and A3 supertypes means that HLA-A*30:03 belongs to a special supertype, A1A3. different residues at position 114 resulted in different binding motifs of HLA-A*30:03 by influence the charge surrounding the F pocket. screening of immunogenic peptides presented by specific MHC I molecules is crucial for the development of vaccines for infection diseases or cancer immunotherapy and for T-cell immune response evaluation. vaccines targeting predicted personal tumor neoantigens are feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity (45, 50, 52\u201355) cross-reactive CD8+ T cells broadly exist among the population. most of these are cross-recognized by the same HLA supertype because they have similar binding motifs. previous work using recombinant MHC class I molecules, peptide MTB (QIMYNYPAM) has been shown to be presented by HLA-A*30:01. results indicate that MTB bind to HLA-A*30:03, but not to HLA-A*30:01.
