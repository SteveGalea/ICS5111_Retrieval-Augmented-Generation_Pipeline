{"summary": "boHV-1 infection can cause conjunctivitis, pneumonia, genital disorders, abortions, and an upper respiratory infection known as bovine respiratory disease (BRD) BRDC and BoHV-1 infections cost the cattle industry at least $3 billion/year in the united states. bICP0 encoded within immediate early transcript unit 1 (IEtu1) Infection of permissive cells leads to rapid cell death, in part due to apoptosis. bICP0 is considered to be the major viral regulatory protein that stimulates productive infection because it activates all viral promoters. panel A: Schematic of boHV-1 genome and location of bICP0 gene. bICP0 contains multiple functional domains bICP0 [70], HHV-1 encoded ICP0 [34]. bICP0 and bICP0 localize with and disrupt promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein-containing nuclear domains located in bICP0 and ICP0 [29] possess intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. bICP0 and ICP0 can induce ubiquitin dependent proteolysis of specific proteins. a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, and HHV-1 encoded ICP0 have similar effects on cellular and viral gene expression. HHV-1 encoded ICP0 interacts with class II HDACs [94]. a brief description of how HHV-1 regulates an innate immune response. infection of cultured human cells with HHV-1 leads to production and secretion of interferon (IFN) the HHV-1 glycoprotein gD induces IFN- production in mononuclear cells [80], in part, because HHV-1 activates IRF-3 (interferon response factor 3) in certain cell types. IRF3 directly binds several consensus DNA binding sites, including ISRE (IFN response elements), which stimulate transcription of IFN-stimulated genes in the absence of IFN. panel A: Schematic of the human IFN- promoter necessary for inducing an IFN response to virus infection. bICP0 inhibits IRF3 functions by inducing its degradation Mice lacking type I and type II interferon receptors in combination with RAG-2 gene deletions die within a few days following BoHV-1 infection. in contrast, boHV-1 infection of wt mice does not lead to clinical symptoms or extensive viral replication. bICP0 interacts with IRF7 IRF7 IRF7 was originally identified as a protein that binds and represses the Epstein-Barr virus Qp promoter [155]. IRF7 undergoes virus-induced activation and phosphorylation at its C-terminus [9,99,130], and thus is an important regulator of the innate immune response. bICP0 inhibited the ability of IRF7 to trans-activate the IFN- promoter. bICP0 interacted with IRF7 or a complex containing IRF7. bICP0 interacted with p300 or p300 containing complexes. p300 is crucial for stimulating IFN- promoter activity. bICP0 null mutant does not protect cells from apoptosis because bICP0 is toxic to cells in transient transfection assays. a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) was used to introduce a single cysteine to glycine mutation into the 51st amino acid of bICP0 (51g mutant) the 51g mutant induces plaques following infection of cultured bovine cells. bICP0 can inhibit IRF3 and IRF7 dependent activation of the IFN- promoter. the 51g mutant grows poorly in bovine cells after imiquimod treatment. in calves, the 51g mutant grows poorly and does not reactivate from latency. gN proteins encoded by pseudorabies virus and BoHV-1 inhibit TAP-mediated transport of cytosolic peptides into ER. the UL49.5 protein contains a 22 amino acid signal peptide at its N-terminus, an extracellular domain of 32 amino acids, a transmembrane region of 25 amino acids, and a 17 amino acid cytoplasmic tail. a gN mutant that lacks the cytoplasmic tail can still bind boHV-1 encodes a protein that interacts with chemokines Chemokines are small proteins (8\u201310 kd) that function as cytokines, and thus regulate trafficking and effector functions of leukocytes. chemokines are important regulators of inflammation, immune surveillance, and they have potent anti-viral functions. chemokines block chemokine activity by preventing interactions with specific receptors and GAGS. gG disrupts chemokine gradients, which controls the local environment surrounding an infected cell. gG mutant that was examined was not rescued, and expression of surrounding genes was not examined. LR gene products inhibit mammalian cell growth [44,132], bICP0 expression [19,45,132], and apoptosis [26,58] LR protein expression is necessary for inhibiting cell growth or bICP0 expression. LR protein expression is not necessary for inhibiting cell growth or apoptosis. bICP0 is encoded within immediate early transcript unit 1 (IEtu1) Infection of permissive cells [28] or calves [145] leads to rapid cell death, in part due to apoptosis. bICP0 also contains an E promoter located near the 5\u2032 end of the coding exon of bICP0. bICP0 is considered to be the major viral regulatory protein that stimulates productive infection. the bICP0 E promoter is activated by dexamethasone [150], a stimulus that induces reactivation from latency suggesting the E promoter plays a role in the early phases of reactivation from latency. bICP0 contains multiple functional domains bICP0 [70], HHV-1 encoded ICP0 [34\u201337,93] and equine herpesvirus 1 encoded ICP0 [16,17] contain a C3HC4 zinc RING finger near their N terminus that activates productive infection. the specific proteins that are targets for proteolysis by bICP0 have not been identified. bICP0 interacts with p300, a histone acetyl transferase (HAT), and this interaction correlates with activating a late viral promoter. a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, and HHV-1 encoded ICP0 have similar effects on cellular and viral gene expression. infection of cultured human cells with HHV-1 leads to production and secretion of interferon (IFN) the HHV-1 glycoprotein gD induces IFN- production in mononuclear cells [80], in part, because HHV-1 activates IRF-3 (interferon response factor 3) in certain cell types. it seems clear that multiple mechanisms lead to innate immune responses following infection with boHV-1. phosphorylate serine residues at the C-terminus of IRF3 induces IRF3 homodimerization and nuclear translocation. IRF3 directly binds several consensus DNA binding sites, including ISRE (IFN response elements), which stimulate transcription of IFN-stimulated genes. 2.5.b. bICP0 inhibits IRF3 functions by inducing its degradation Mice lacking type I and type II interferon receptors in combination with RAG-2 gene deletions die within a few days following boHV-1 infection. bICP0 reduces IRF3 protein levels in human or bovine cells. reading frames B and C contain an open reading frame, but lack an initiating Met. bICP0 interacts with IRF7 IRF7 was originally identified as a protein that binds and represses the Epstein-Barr virus Qp promoter. IRF7 undergoes virus-induced activation and phosphorylation at its C-terminus [9,99,130] the ability of bICP0 to inhibit the ability of IRF7 to trans-activate the IFN- promoter indicated bICP0 had a direct effect on the functions of IRF7. however, bICP0 interacted with IRF7 or a complex containing IRF7. the ability of bICP0 to interact with p300 or p300 containing complexes may also interfere with IFN- promoter activity. nuclear IRF3 associates with other transcriptional activators. IRF3 directly binds several consensus DNA binding sites. bICP0 inhibits IFN- promoter activity. bICP0 inhibits IRF3 functions by inducing its degradation. bICP0 reduces IRF3 protein levels in human or bovine cells. the bICP0 RING finger is important for inducing IRF3 degradation. reading frames B and C contain an open reading frame, but lack an initiating Met. bICP0 interacts with IRF7 IRF7 was originally identified as a protein that binds and represses the Epstein-Barr virus Qp promoter [155]. IRF7, like IRF3, undergoes virus-induced activation and phosphorylation at its C-terminus [9,99,130] the ability of bICP0 to inhibit the ability of IRF7 to trans-activate the IFN- promoter indicated bICP0 had a direct effect on the functions of IRF7. however, bICP0 interacted with IRF7 or a complex containing IRF7. this interaction correlated with the ability of bICP0 to interact with p300 or p300 containing complexes. bICP0 null mutant does not protect infected cells from UV induced apoptosis. bICP0 is toxic to cells in transient transfection assays. the 51g mutant induces plaques following infection of cultured bovine cells. HHV-1 encoded ICP0 plays a crucial role in allowing virus replication in the face of an IFN response. the ability of the 51g mutant virus to grow in bovine cells pretreated with imiquimod is greatly reduced compared to the rescued virus (51gR) bICP0, directly or indirectly, overcomes the effects of imiquimod. UL49.5 encodes a 96 amino acid protein with an apparent molecular mass of 9 kDa [88] that inhibits TAP-mediated transport of cytosolic peptides into ER. gN proteins encoded by pseudorabies virus and BoHV-1 inhibit TAP-mediated transport of cytosolic peptides into ER. boHV-1 infects CD4+ T cells and induces apoptosis. it is not clear why CD4+ T cells are very susceptible to apoptosis. chemokines are small proteins (8\u201310 kd) that function as cytokines. pesvirus 1 encodes a glycoprotein (gG) that is secreted from infected cells. interactions between gG and chemokines block chemokine activity by preventing interactions with specific receptors and GAGS. gG disrupts chemokine gradients, which controls local environment surrounding an infected cell. LR mutant virus does not reactivate from latency following dexamethasone treatment. LR protein expression is necessary for inhibiting cell growth or apoptosis. LR protein expression is not necessary for inhibiting cell growth or bICP0 expression. a protein encoded by the LR gene can interact with a B-cell and monocyte-activating chemokine precursor. infiltration of inflammatory cells into trigeminal ganglia during acute infection correlates with enhanced neuronal death. inability of the LR mutant virus to reactivate from latency. a gN mutant that lacks the cytoplasmic tail can still bind to the TAP complex and block peptide transport. this mutant gN protein does not degrade TAP functions. sequences within the transmembrane domain of gN appear to be necessary for interacting with TAP. chemokine functions depend on selective recognition and activation of chemokine receptors belonging to the seven-membrane domain, G protein-coupled receptor super family. chemotactive chemokine gradients allow correct presentation of chemokines to leukocytes. interactions between gG and chemokines block chemokine activity by preventing interactions with specific receptors and GAGS. mutant boHV-1 virus contains 3 stop codons at the beginning of ORF-2. LR mutant virus grows to similar titers as wt BoHV-1 or the LR rescued virus in cultured bovine cells. LR protein expression is necessary for the latency-reactivation cycle. LR-RNA has the potential to base pair with bICP0 RNA. formation of double stranded RNA may induce higher levels of IFN-. LR gene products inhibit infiltration of inflammatory cells into trigeminal ganglia of infected calves. specific cellular proteins that are targets for proteasomal degradation induced by bICP0 have not been identified. bICP0 inhibits IFN dependent transcription and stimulates viral gene expression. the ability of BoHV-1 to infect CD4+ T cells would transiently repress immune responses."}
