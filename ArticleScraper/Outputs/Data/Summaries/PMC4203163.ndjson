{"summary": "asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, characterized by infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes that produce cytokines and proinflammatory lipid mediators. the pathophysiological features are the result of an imbalance in the Th1/Th2 paradigm, with the Th2 response being predominant. RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved process of sequence-specific, posttranscriptional gene silencing that uses double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a signal to trigger the degradation of homologous mRNA in most eukaryotic cells and inhibit gene expression. many studies have shown that small interference RNA (siRNA) could effectively silence target gene expression in vitro or in vivo. eight- to ten-week-old male mice were grouped, sensitized, and challenged. the first group of asthmatic mice was administered 20 l of PBS vehicle in each nostril. the second and third groups were administered 35 g of scrambled siRNA and specific murine c-kit siRNA for 3 consecutive days. mice were anesthetized with 0.2 ml of 2.5% Avertin (1 g/ml of tribromoethyl alcohol in tertiary amylalcohol) on days 21 to 23, mice were administered with 35 g of scrambled siRNA and specific murine c-kit siRNA for 3 consecutive days from days 21 to 23. the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff reagent (Sigma) inflammation was scored as follows: 0, no inflammation; 1, inflammatory cells present; 2, a few (3) loci of inflammation; 3, multiple (3) loci of inflammation; 4, inflammatory cells present throughout the lung. total RNA was transcribed into cDNA with a reverse transcriptase kit at 50\u00b0C for 30 min. blots were probed for murine c-kit with a murine c-kit antibody. mice were given ovalbumin (OVA, 20 g, grade V; Sigma-Aldrich) with aluminum hydroxide (alum, 2.25 mg; Imject Alum; Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.) in a 100-l total volume via intraperitoneal injection on days 0, 7 and 14. mice were sacrificed with i.p. injection of a lethal dose of pentobarbital. target siRNA was chemically modified by methylation to avoid or lessen its destruction in the tissue [15]. we selected two c-kit-specific siRNA duplexes on the basis of a previous in vitro study. the first group of asthmatic mice was intranasally administered with 20 l of PBS vehicle on each nostril. the second and third groups of mice were administered with 35 g of scrambled siRNA and specific murine c-kit siRNA. eosinophils in the BALF BAL were instilled bilaterally with a syringe. the cells were identified as eosinophils by standard morphology. at least 200 cells were counted under 400 magnification. total RNA was extracted from frozen lung tissue. blots were probed for murine c-kit with a murine c-kit antibody. bands were visualized with an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. c-kit siRNA selectively regulates cytokines in the BALF. siRNA reduces eosinophil infiltration in the BALF. the percentage of eosinophils in the BALF in the c-kit-siRNA group was lower than those in the control or scrambled siRNA groups. the mice were nasally administered (A) PBS vehicle, (B) scrambled siRNA, or (C) c-kit siRNA. the experiment was carried out three times; representative images are shown. siRNA reduces the secretion of mucus in the airways of asthmatic mice. c-kit mRNA expression was down-regulated at 72 h after the last administration in the anti-c-kit siRNA group. the bar graph represents the mean relative intensity ( SD) of the c-kit bands normalized to -actin. c-kit siRNA selectively regulates cytokines in the BALF. samples were obtained 3 days after the injection of siRNA or PBS vehicle. data are expressed as mean cytokine concentration SEM from n 5 mice. c-kit siRNA attenuates the inflammatory response in the lung tissue. compared with control and scrambled siRNA groups, the number of inflammatory cells that infiltrated the lung tissue was lower in the c-kit siRNA group. c-kit siRNA down-regulates the expression of c-kit gene in lung tissue. expression of c-kit mRNA was down-regulated in the anti-c-kit siRNA group at 72 h after the last administration in the anti-c-kit siRNA group. the experiment was carried out three times; representative images are shown. the term RNAi describes posttranslational silencing of gene expression that occurs in response to the introduction of dsRNA into a cell. this phenomenon can result in highly specific suppression of gene expression. human peripheral blood eosinophils expressed and released SCF. blocking c-kit/c-kit ligand interaction could significantly decrease eosinophils in the BALF. treatment of mice with imatinib to inhibit signal pathway of SCF/c-kit. treatment with antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to the c-kit ligand suppresses airway inflammation, IL-4 production, and eosinophil infiltration. IL-4 promotes IgE synthesis, contributes to early recruitment of eosinophils, and is detected as early as 3h after challenge. reduced mucus in the airway was attributed to lower production of IL-4. c-kit-PI3K positively regulates production of IL-6. c-kit up-regulation in dendritic cells led to immune skewing toward the Th2 and Th17 subsets and away from Th1 responses. inflammation control in allergic asthma. conflict of interest."}
