{"summary": "the introduction of fully automated devices with faster turnaround times has allowed clinical laboratories the necessary tools to report sensitive and accurate results to physicians. the goal in performing microbiology nucleic acid tests (NAT) is to provide timely results useful for high-quality patient care at a reasonable cost. the main molecular techniques used in clinical virology Table 1 summarizes the main molecular techniques used in clinical virology. Table 1 summarizes the main molecular techniques used in clinical virology. nucleic acid probes are segments of DNA or RNA labeled with radioisotopes, enzymes or chemiluminiscent molecules that can bind to complementary nucleic acid sequences of microorganisms. the commonly used formats for probe hybridization include liquid-phase, solid-phase and in situ hybridization. branched or bDNA signal amplification techniques are based on target, signal or probe amplification techniques. the signal is directly proportional to the amount of the target sequence present in the clinical specimen. the development of quantitative assays is more reliable. a second-generation assay was developed (Quantiplex HCV RNA 2.0 assay, Bayer) to improve the detection rate for HCV genotypes 2 and 3. a third-generation bDNA assays both for HCV and HIV have been developed. target DNA, two oligonucleotide primers, a DNA polymerase, a mixture of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), MgCl2, KCl and Tris-HCl buffer. the reaction mixture is heated and cooled during several cycles in a programmable thermal cycler. after n cycles the target sequence can be amplified 2n-fold. multiplex PCR assays for viral respiratory pathogens and for detection of viral infections of central nervous system have been developed and commercialized [17, 18]. real-time PCR In this method, the target amplification and detection steps occur simultaneously. these methods require special thermal cyclers that can monitor the fluorescence emission from the sample. NASBA-based kits have developed commercially available kits for the detection and quantitation of HIV-1 RNA and CMV RNA and detection of enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus RNA. strand displacement amplification occurs in two phases, target generation and exponential target amplification. ligase chain reaction assay is based on the ligation of two adjacent synthetic oligonucleotide primers which hybridize to one strand of the target DNA. a second pair of primers is used in a cycling reaction, using a thermostable DNA ligase. ligated products can then serve as templates for the next reaction cycle. branched or bDNA signal amplification system consists of a series of hybridization steps resulting in a \u201csandwich\u201d complex of probes and target sequence with a branched structure. the initial step in a bDNA assay is to ensure that viral particles have been disrupted and that viral RNA is present for analysis. RNA 3.0 and VERSANT HIV-1 RNA 3.0 assays use isoC and isoG-substituted oligonucleotides to reduce nonspecific hybridization. the hybrids are captured by anti-hybrids antibodies. the antibody conjugate is detected with a chemiluminescent substrate. the first-generation bDNA assay (Quantiplex HCV RNA 1.0 assay, Bayer) had a dynamic quantification range in human plasma (from 3.5 x 105 to 1.2 x 108 HCV RNA copies/mL) Genotypes 1-6 were detected by using this assay. a third-generation bDNA assays both for HCV and HIV have been developed. PCR consists in a mixture of target DNA, two oligonucleotide primers, a DNA polymerase, a mixture of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), MgCl2, KCl and Tris-HCl buffer. the reaction mixture is heated and cooled during several cycles in a programmable thermal cycler. after n cycles the target sequence can be amplified 2n-fold. nested PCR is less sensitive than PCR with single primer set. multiplex PCR assays for viral respiratory pathogens and for detection of viral infections of central nervous system have been developed and commercialized. isothermal RNA amplification methods are modeled after retroviral replication. the RNA target is reverse transcribed into cDNA and then RNA copies are synthesized with a RNA polymerase. RNA copies are synthesized with a single-stranded RNA product. RT-PCR was introduced to amplify RNA targets. cDNA is first produced from RNA by reverse transcription. then the cDNA is amplified by PCR. commercial kits are available for detection of HCV RNA. real-time PCR reduces time required to perform nucleic acid assays. nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) are isothermal RNA amplification methods modeled after retroviral replication. strand displacement amplification occurs in two phases, target generation and exponential target amplification. some methods differ from those that use target amplification in which the amplification products contain only a sequence present in the initial probes. cycling probe technology is fast, linear, isothermal and simple compared with other DNA detection methods. ligated products can then serve as templates for the next reaction cycle, leading to an exponential amplification process similar to amplification. reaction to detect target-specific products is the most common technique used. ligase chain reaction assay is based on the ligation of two adjacent synthetic oligonucleotide primers which hybridize to one strand of the target DNA. a second pair of primers is used in a cycling reaction, using a thermostable DNA ligase. a DNA array (or DNA chip) is a collection of spots attached to a solid support. each spot contains one or more single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide fragment. hybridization signals are mapped to several positions within the array. an array is created consisting of 100 distinct microsphere sets with specific spectrum. a third fluorochrome quantifies the biomolecular interaction. microspheres pass through separate lasers in the Luminex analyzer. microarrays detect viruses such as respiratory viruses [28], hepatitis C virus [29] and virus causing CNS infection [30]. suspension arrays have advantages of ease of use, low cost, statistical superiority and faster hybridization kinetics. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) this method has improved classical PCR in its reaction simplicity, accuracy and higher amplification efficiency. the procedure is very rapid, and the amplification can be completed in less than 1 hour. loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) is a one-step amplification reaction that proceeds at isothermal conditions. the method is very rapid, and the amplification can be completed in less than 1 hour. the main advantage of LAMP is that it does not require thermal cycles. personnel and facility requirements must be trained in the pre-analytical (specimen extraction and processing) and the analytical procedures. professionals that work in this kind of laboratory should have a correct training or experience in molecular virology and also should have theoretical knowledge of molecular virology. the different devices used in PCR such as pipettes, tubes, reagents should be dedicated exclusively to each working area. the manufacturer s recommendations must be followed for cleaning of instruments, processing blocks and other instrument surfaces and parts. work flow should be implemented at the same time that this technology is being introduced into the virology laboratory. laboratory-developed tests require technical resources to resolve problems related to the assay are available within the laboratory. each laboratory should define their work areas but, in general, four different work areas are recommended: a reagent preparation area to prepare PCR master mix, a sample processing area where different procedures are performed. the number of tubes that should be simultaneously opened must be minimizing in order to avoid cross-contamination between different samples. main Viruses, Samples and Molecular Techniques used for Viral Diagnosis Viruses Samples Techniques Infections CMV CSF Conventional qualitative PCR CNS infection Blood Real time quantitative PCR Congenital infection Hybrid capture assay CMV immunosuppressed infections HSV CSF Nested PCR Meningo-encephalitis Blood Multiplex PCR Neonatal herpes infection Leucocytes Hybrid capture assay Generalized and visceral herpes clinical samples Conventional qualitative PCR Respiratory infections Real time quantitative PCR HPV Cervical exudates and biopsies Type-specific PCR Cervical lesions Warts biopsies Liquid hybridization HPV mRNA detection Microarrays Hepatitis viruses Serum or plasma Real time quantitative PCR Chronic infections (viral load) CMV infection can have several clinical presentations such as non-specific viral syndrome, ocular and congenital disease. techniques can detect and quantify CMV DNA or DNA-RNA hybrids in clinical specimens, including the CSF. a real-time PCR assay is being used for the diagnosis of CMV, HSV-1. a real-time PCR assay is being used for the diagnosis of these infections. real-time PCR assays are rapid, simple and convenient for testing for herpesviruses DNA in the routine laboratory. similarity of clinical features of these viruses is a reason for include several targets for CSF testing rather than for a single unique sequence of one virus. conventional PCR was not adapted for the detection of HSV in dermal or genital sources. Detection of EBV DNA in CSF could be useful for diagnosis of this infection. this technique has a sensitivity of 80-90% and a specificity that approaches 100%. detection of EBV DNA in CSF also provides a marker to monitor the response to treatment for CNS lymphomas. some real-time PCR assays have been developed for detecting B19 nucleic acids in association with infection during pregnancy or assessing the prevalence of the virus DNA in blood products. lightCycler parvovirus B19 quantitative assay is highly sensitive for genotype 1 but is not suitable for detecting genotypes 2 or 3. a quantitative real-time PCR technique has been developed to monitor BK virus DNA in renal transplant recipients. active BK virus nephropathy is associated with high quantitative levels of BK virus DNA, and resolution of nephropathy was correlated with decreased DNA virus level in urine. a negative result does mean no association of BK virus with nephritis. adenovirus PCR is a specific and sensitive assay for detecting adenovirus DNA from a wide variety of clinical specimens. a rapid and sensitive multiplex real-time PCR assay for detection of four serotypes of parainfluenza viruses has been developed. RT-PCR has higher sensitivity than cell culture for detecting enterovirus. real-time PCR assays amplify conserved target nucleic acid sequences of enterovirus. hepatitis Viruses Molecular techniques can be very useful for diagnosis of viral hepatitis infections such as hepatitis A, B, C, D and E. RT-PCR, transcription-mediated amplification and branched DNA amplification are commonly employed for detection of HCV RNA. new HCV molecular assays have emerged and have been proposed as suitable, without loss specificity and sensitivity. infection can have several clinical presentations such as non-specific viral syndrome, ocular and congenital disease. in the majority of them the clinical presentation is in the form of encephalitis, but also as myelitis, radiculomyelopathy and mononeuritis multiplex. PCR is positive early in the course of the illness (within the first 24 hours) and remains positive during the first week of therapy. compared to conventional PCR, real-time PCR assays have emerged as a more sensitive method to confirm HSV infection in clinical specimens obtained from genital ulcers and muco-cutaneous lesions. VZV is a cause of CNS disease such as encephalitis, myelitis and acute meningitis. in a retrospective study, VZV DNA was detected from 5% of CSF specimens. PCR-based testing was highly specific because no cross-reactivity was identified when tested against several other viruses. some real-time PCR assays have been developed for detecting B19 nucleic acids in association with infection during pregnancy. lightCycler parvovirus B19 quantitative assay is highly sensitive for genotype 1 but is not suitable for detecting genotypes 2 or 3. conventional PCR for detection of JC virus in the cerebrospinal fluid has replaced the brain biopsy for the diagnosis of presence of this virus in patients with leukoencephalopathy [67] a quantitative real-time PCR technique has been developed to monitor BK virus DNA in renal transplant recipients. rapid influenza diagnostic tests are less sensitive and specific than fluorescent antibody assays and RT-PCR. RT-PCR is the preferred diagnostic assay for influenza virus. real-time PCR is much more sensitive than other methods of detection. real-time PCR assays are used to detect adenovirus type 4 (subgroup E) that can cause respiratory, ocular and other infections. sensitivity of real time PCR against conventional PCR is greater for the detection of adenovirus DNA. RT-PCR has higher sensitivity than cell culture for detecting enterovirus in the CSF. real-time PCR quantification assays are widely used because of their sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, broad dynamic range and positive predictive values. there is currently a need to perform it due to several factors such as the prediction of clinical outcomes and the association with response to interferon treatment. human papillomavirus (HPV) Molecular methods to detect HPV DNA have been introduced in clinical practice. the majority of protocols for detection of this infection are currently based in the study of HPV DNA. identifying women at high risk by testing for HPV DNA could avoid unnecessary colposcopy procedures. Virology laboratories for clinical diagnosis should introduce some of these techniques in order to determine the main viruses implicated in human diseases, after to do an analysis of cost. this workflow should be done in an individualized way, taking into account the assays introduced and the special characteristics of the laboratory."}
