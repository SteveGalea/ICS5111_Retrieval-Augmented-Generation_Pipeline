{"summary": "RT-PCR assays were carried out to screen for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, influenza virus A and B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus OC43/229E and NL63. there was no significant association between the presence of any of the 15 viruses and the incidence of KD. the identification rate of respiratory viruses through multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in children with KD was reported to be 22%4). patients with KD who harbor respiratory viruses have a higher frequency of coronary artery dilatation and are more often diagnosed with incomplete presentation of the disease. children who have had a fever with respiratory symptoms within the previous month were excluded from the control group. nine of the children with KD were matched with only one control subject due to failure of recruitment (in 7 cases) and loss of samples during processing (in 2 cases) influenza viruses 1 to 4, influenza viruses A and B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, corona viruses OC43/229E and NL63, and enterovirus. a total of 42 subjects were found to be infected with one or more of 10 different viruses by multiplex RT-PCR. positive RT-PCR and 37 patients with negative RT-PCR revealed no significant differences with respect to clinical findings. the prevalence of incomplete presentation of disease (P=0.368) and coronary artery diameters (P>0.05 of all coronary arteries) positive RT-RCR was not related to the existence of respiratory symptoms. a new unknown virus triggers a KD and respiratory symptoms. a positive RT-PCR for currently epidemic respiratory viruses should not be used as an evidence against the diagnosis of KD."}
