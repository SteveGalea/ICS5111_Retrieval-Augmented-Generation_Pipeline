{"summary": "inhibition of the lung epithelial Na+/K+-ATPase with ouabain blocks all active cation and anion transport across lung epithelia. inhibition of ENaC by amiloride or its structural analogs, benzamil and phenamil, blocked a significant fraction of reabsorption of alveolar lung fluid. the nonselective channels consist of a combination of the -ENaC subunit and one or more acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1a) proteins. human alveolar cells also express ENaC (23) and actively transport Na+, albeit at rates lower than in rodent lungs. mice with a 50% decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase levels have normal levels of Na+-dependent lung fluid clearance. CFTR is the main conduit for Cl secretion in submucosal glands and in proximal airway epithelial cells (3). CFTR is responsible for reduced glutathione secretion, which is crucial for redox status of the epithelial lining fluid. a delicate balance between Na+ absorption and Cl secretion is required. influenza is a negative-sense RNA virus that contains eight gene segments. three subtypes of hemagglutinin (H1, H2, and H3) and two subtypes of neuraminidases (N1 and N2) are found in influenza A virus strains that regularly infect humans. influenza virus hemagglutinin binds to sialic acid residues on the surface of the lung epithelium. viral mRNA encodes proteins that aid in replication (nonstructural) and proteins are incorporated into the new virion. cRNA is produced and serves as a template for synthesizing vRNA. ciliated, columnar epithelium of upper respiratory tract is primary site of influenza virus infection in mammals. nonciliated club cells and mucous cells can be infected experimentally. cytopathology of replicating influenza virus in airway epithelium can disrupt normal cellular architecture and morphology. apical membranes of mouse tracheal epithelium, colonic epithelium, and kidney cortical collecting ducts were exposed to influenza viruses. incubating cells with lectin concanavalin A, which mimics viral hemagglutinin, also inhibited amiloride-sensitive currents. in ATII cells, virus binding, but not internalization, decreased ENaC activity. in ATII cells, virus binding, but not internalization, decreased ENaC activity. authors suggested changes in the function of the Src cytosolic tyrosine kinase was responsible for ENaC inhibition. influenza virus genome encodes 13 proteins that are continuously expressed at the later stages of infection. the influenza virus gene segment 7 codes for both matrix protein 1 and matrix protein 2 through alternative RNA splicing. injected oocytes were consistent with the decrease in ENaC activity. the authors coexpressed ENaC subunits with mutations present in Liddle syndrome and M2. reduced ENaC activity was due to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. influenza virus M2 inhibits epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity. CFTR activity was also inhibited by M2 in Xenopus oocytes injected with human CFTR. ion transport was significantly reduced, suggesting a protein-trafficking defect. the effects of M2 were not indiscriminant because M2 did not inhibit the activity of another ion channel, TRPV5, in Xenopus oocytes. ubiquitination was inhibited using an enzyme inhibitor. CFTR activity was rescued in M2-coinjected oocytes. these results suggest there is a profound dysregulation of CFTR expression and activity after virus infection. Londino et al. (62) knocked down virally expressed M2 protein with siRNA or inhibited its activity with amantadine. inhibiting M2 prevented the decrease in CFTR expression and function, confirming that M2 was responsible for the decrease in CFTR activity and protein levels. bafilomycin A1, added after infection, had no effect on viral protein expression. the cause of enhanced cell surface, K63-linked polyubiquitination of CFTR in cells infected with influenza virus remains to be elucidated. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was also shown to inhibit CFTR activity of mouse trachea and in epithelial cells in primary culture (11) infection of ciliated airway cells from human donors with RSV decreased the PCL height, which was attributed to the inhibition. infection of mice with influenza virus results in significant and sustained injury of the alveolar epithelium that peaks at 1 wk postinfection. increased passive fluid transport through the compromised epithelium and tight junctions (73) ATP is hydrolyzed to adenosine, which acts on the A1-AR. decreased Na+ absorption and increased Cl secretion leads to increased airway surface fluid and pulmonary edema. inhibition of apical Na+ transport through ENaC changes the electrochemical gradient that may result in Cl secretion through CFTR. cytokines released during viral infection have also been demonstrated to alter ion transport across alveolar epithelial cells. neutralizing antibodies resulted in significantly improved AFC. TNF- increases ENaC activity (14, 25) although ROS may alter both ENaC and CFTR activity. the alteration of ENaC by influenza virus is probably responsible for or exacerbates several symptoms described during influenza infection. administration of amiloride and amiloride analogs has been proposed as a therapy for cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis (37, 102) in cystic fibrosis, PCL dehydration is thought to be a primary driver of chronic bacterial infections in the respiratory tract that lead to airway obstruction, bronchiectasis, and respiratory failure. study of influenza virus infection in normal and cystic fibrosis primary airway epithelium found more genes are altered (both activated and inhibited) in normal lung epithelial cells than in cystic fibrosis cells. early gene responses were particularly impacted (111), including IFN- production and apoptotic responses. in airways, inhibition of ENaC and activation of CFTR may lead to increased PCL volume and rhinorrhea. further research on the dysregulation of ion transport during viral infections. influenza virus infection on ion transport depends on the strain of virus and severity of infection. future studies are necessary to elucidate these mechanisms with an intention to identify therapeutic targets to reduce morbidity and mortality."}
