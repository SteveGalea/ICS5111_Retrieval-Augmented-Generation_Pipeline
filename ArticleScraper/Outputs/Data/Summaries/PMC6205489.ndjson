{"summary": "MHV Genomic RNA is a Target of the NMD Pathway. if coV genomic RNA is a substrate of the NMD pathway, then depletion of NMD factors would prevent the degradation of the transfected genomic RNA, resulting in efficient virus replication. we used mouse hepatitis virus, a prototypic member of the CoV family. analysis showed a lower accumulation of NS39 reporter transcripts than WT reporter transcripts in control siRNA-transfected cells. increased accumulation of the NS39 reporter transcripts in cells depleted of UPF1, UPF2, SMG5 or SMG6 demonstrated the inhibition of the NMD pathway in these cells. MHV titers in the culture fluid at 24 h postgenomic RNA transfection were determined by plaque assay. data represent the mean with SEM of at least three independent experiments. two micrograms per well of MHV genomic RNA was transfected into UPF1-depleted cells (siUpf1) and UPF2-depleted cells (siUpf2) in a 12-well plate. levels of genomic RNA at 1, 3, 5, and 7 h posttransfection were determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to 18S rRNA levels. MHV genomic RNA was degraded by the NMD pathway. we used two pharmacological NMD inhibitors, cycloheximide (CHX) and wortmannin. wortmannin inhibits NMD by preventing SMG1-mediated UPF1 phosphorylation. the transfected rLucRNA3 exhibited a longer half-life in NMD-deficient cells compared to NMD-competent cells. the levels of the transfected rLucRNA3 were higher in cells treated with NMD inhibitors. this suggests that coV subgenomic mRNAs can also serve as substrates of the NMD pathway. to generate capped rLucRNA3 transcripts in the cytoplasm, we cotransfected 17Cl-1 cells with four expression plasmids in the experimental group. the plasmids encoding the vaccinia virus capping enzymes were omitted, which would drive the synthesis of uncapped and polyadenylated rLucRNA3 transcripts in the cytoplasm. at 20 h posttransfection, cells were treated with actD, and levels of expressed rLucRNA3 at 0, 2, and 4 h after actD addition. we examined the levels of preexisting rLucRNA3 transcripts at 0, 2, and 4 h after actD treatment. cytoplasmically synthesized rLucRNA3 transcripts are recognized and degraded by the NMD pathway. plasmid encoding GLA RNA was used in place of that encoding rLucRNA3. levels of rLucRNA3 at 1 and 3 h after actD addition were determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to 18S rRNA levels. data represent the mean with SEM of at least three independent experiments. coVs have developed a strategy to inhibit the NMD pathway. to test this hypothesis, we generated 17Cl-1 cells expressing either an NMD reporter transcript (NS39, carrying a PTC) or a WT reporter transcript (lacking the PTC) total RNAs were extracted at 7 h p.i. and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis. the data represent the mean with SEM of at least three independent experiments. the data represent the mean with SEM of at least three independent experiments. MHV replication inhibits host translation in MHV-infected cells. MHV-induced inhibition of NMD started at 9 h p.i., suggesting that the MHV-induced inhibition of NMD preceded the onset of host translation inhibition. the level of NS39 reporter transcripts was higher in TGEV nsp1-expressing cells than in CAT-expressing cells. similar experiments, using a plasmid encoding one of the MHV structural proteins, showed that MHV N protein inhibited the NMD pathway. fLuc transcripts and plasmids encoding either CAT, M protein, N protein, E protein, or S protein were normalized to 18S rRNA at 40 h posttransfection. NS39 transcript levels are shown relative to WT (set arbitrarily at 100) plasmid encoding CATmyc, TGEV nsp1myc, or MHV N. levels of alternatively spliced rpL3 mRNA at 40 h posttransfection were determined by qRT-PCR. data represent mean with SEM of at least three independent experiments. we transfected MHV genomic RNA or the capped and polyadenylated rLucRNA3 into cells transiently expressing MHV N, CAT, or TGEV nsp1. we observed a delayed degradation kinetics with longer half-lives for the RNAs in cells expressing MHV N or TGEV nsp1. the accumulation of MHV N protein early in infection was low. we inoculated MHV into cells treated with control siRNAs (NMD-competent) and with siRNAs for UPF1 or UPF2 (NMD-deficient) levels of incoming genomic RNA in NMD-deficient cells were not significantly different during the first 2 h p.i. the 17Cl-1 cells were mock-infected (Mock) or infected with MHV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. the levels of mRNA 3 (Left) and mRNA 7 (Right) were determined by qRT-PCR. the levels of mRNA 1 (relative to 18S rRNA) at 4 and 6 h p.i. were determined by qRT-PCR. the data represent the mean with SEM of at least three independent experiments. E64d-mediated inhibition of viral mRNA synthesis also severely inhibited the accumulation of MHV N protein (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B) we treated MHV-infected cells with E64d and wortmannin or with E64d and DMSO from 4 to 6 h p.i. and measured the levels of mRNA 1 at 4 and 6 h p.i. tion of the NMD factors UPF1 and UPF2 or by wortmannin treatment, resulted in higher levels of MHV mRNA 1 accumulation. new synthesized MHV mRNA 1 is susceptible to NMD early in infection. depletion of NMD factors would prevent degradation of transfected genomic RNA. qRT-PCR showed a lower accumulation of NS39 reporter transcripts than WT reporter transcripts in control siRNA-transfected cells. increase in the accumulation of the NS39 reporter transcripts in cells depleted of UPF1, UPF2, SMG5 or SMG6 demonstrated the inhibition of the NMD pathway in these cells. the cells were stained by anti-M protein antibody (green) and DAPI (blue) at 24 h postgenomic RNA transfection were determined by plaque assay. the data represent the mean with SEM of at least three independent experiments. we observed a significantly delayed degradation kinetics of the transfected genomic RNA in NMD-deficient cells compared with NMD-competent cells. these data suggest that MHV genomic RNA is a substrate of the NMD pathway, which recognizes and degrades the transfected RNA. the half-life (t1/2) of each RNA was calculated from the slope of the trendlines. we used two pharmacological NMD inhibitors, cycloheximide (CHX) and wortmannin. wortmannin inhibits NMD because it is a translation-dependent event. in vitro-synthesized, capped, and polyadenylated MHV subgenomic RNA 3-like reporter transcript, rLucRNA3, carrying the rLuc ORF instead of the MHV S protein ORF. the transfected rLucRNA3 exhibited a longer half-life in NMD-deficient cells compared to NMD-competent cells. the levels of the transfected rLucRNA3 were higher in cells treated with N rLucRNA3 mRNAs are synthesized in the cytoplasm of infected cells. we cotransfected 17Cl-1 cells with four expression plasmids in the experimental group. plasmids encoding the vaccinia virus capping enzymes were omitted. we examined the stability of rLucRNA3 transcripts in control siRNA-treated cells (NMD-competent) or in cells depleted of UPF1 or UPF2 (NMD-deficient) we treated the cells with actinomycin D (actD) at 20 h posttransfection to prevent new RNA synthesis. at 20 h after plasmid transfection, cells were treated with actD. levels of expressed rLucRNA3 at 0, 2, and 4 h after actD treatment were determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to 18S rRNA levels. data represent mean with SEM of at least three independent experiments. MHV replication inhibits the NMD pathway starting at 7 h p.i. Fig. 4 shows that MHV replication inhibits the NMD pathway starting at 7 h p.i. MHV replication induces NMD inhibition. levels of NS39 transcripts in NS39 reporter cells were determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to 18S rRNA levels. total RNAs were extracted at 7 h p.i. and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis to measure the levels of alternatively spliced rpL3 mRNA relative to that of canonically spliced rpL3 mRNA. MHV replication induced the inhibition of the NMD pathway. MHV-induced host translation inhibition started at 9 h p.i., suggesting that MHV-induced host translation inhibition preceded the onset of host translation inhibition. CAT and TGEV nsp1 carried a C-terminal myc tag. at 40 h posttransfection, we examined the levels of WT and NS39 reporter transcripts relative to those of fLuc transcripts. MHV N protein expression resulted in a slightly higher fLuc reporter activity. 17Cl-1 cells were cotransfected with NS39 reporter plasmid or NS39 reporter plasmid along with the pCMV-fLuc plasmid expressing either CAT, M protein, N protein, E protein, or S protein. at 40 h posttransfection, the levels of WT reporter transcripts and NS39 reporter transcripts were determined by qRT-PCR and normalized to the levels of fLuc transcripts. myc-tagged CAT, TGEV nsp1myc, MHV N, and -actin at 40 h posttransfection. levels of alternatively spliced rpL3 mRNA were determined by qRT-PCR. the data represent the mean with SEM of at least three independent experiments. transfected MHV genomic RNA or the capped and polyadenylated rLucRNA3 into cells transiently expressing MHV N, myc-tagged CAT, or myc-tagged TGEV nsp1. we observed a delayed degradation kinetics with longer half-lives for the RNAs in cells expressing MHV N or TGEV nsp1. MHV mRNAs synthesized early in infection are susceptible to NMD. the accumulation of MHV N protein was low, with detectable levels starting only at 6 h p.i. to test the possibility that viral mRNAs synthesized early in infection are susceptible to NMD. the levels of mRNA 3 among these cells were determined by qRT-PCR. the levels of mRNA 3 (Left) and mRNA 7 (Right) at 5 h p.i. were determined by qRT-PCR. 17Cl-1 cells were infected with MHV at an MOI of 0.1. cells were treated with 300 g/mL E64d and either 20 M wortmannin (Wort) or DMSO at 4 h p.i. the levels of mRNA 1 (relative to 18S rRNA) at 4 and 6 h p.i. were determined by qRT-PCR. we measured levels of mRNA 1 at 4 and 6 h p.i. to exclude possibility that wortmannin treatment promoted viral mRNA synthesis, leading to higher levels of accumulation of mRNA 1. the level of mRNA 1 was significantly higher in wortmannin-treated cells than in DMSO-treated cells. wortmannin inhibits the newly synthesized mRNA 1 from degradation. mRNA 1 is susceptible to NMD early in infection. inhibition of the NMD pathway significantly delayed the degradation of the transfected MHV genomic RNA. MHV N protein also protected transfected viral genomic RNA and rLucRNA3 from rapid degradation. new MHV mRNAs 1 and 3 are susceptible to NMD. inhibition of the NMD pathway by the depletion of NMD factors promoted the accumulation of viral mRNAs early in infection. retroviruses have evolved to control the NMD pathway. the avian retrovirus carries an RNA stability element that facilitates the escape of full-length viral RNA (carrying a long 3\u2032 UTR) from degradation by the NMD pathway. present and past studies have highlighted a biological role for the NMD pathway as an intrinsic host defense mechanism against cytoplasmic RNA viruses. it is conceivable that many cytoplasmic RNA viruses have evolved to evade the NMD pathway altogether by eliminating NMD-inducing RNA features from the viral mRNAs. the long 3\u2032 UTR of subgenomic RNA of PVX is targeted by the NMD pathway. a possible mechanism employed by cytoplasmic RNA viruses to subvert the NMD pathway is through one or more viral proteins that inhibit the NMD pathway. in alphavirus, the SFV mutant lacking the C-terminal part of nsp3 was more susceptible to UPF1-mediated degradation. the core protein of hepatitis C virus binds to an EJC recycling factor and prevents the factor from interacting with other components of the EJC. MHV mRNAs are vulnerable to the NMD pathway. we also reveal the role of MHV N protein as an inhibitor of the NMD pathway. it has been shown that in coV reverse genetics systems, the addition of transcripts encoding N protein enhances the recovery of infectious viruses. inhibition of the NMD pathway by N protein could protect viral mRNAs from NMD. inhibition of the NMD pathway in coV-infected cells could have an impact on other cellular responses to viral infections. the plasmid carried the entire MHV mRNA 3 region minus the rLuc gene downstream of a T7 promoter and upstream of a poly(A) sequence, HDV ribozyme and T7 terminator. the plasmids were transfected into 17Cl-1 cells using transIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit synthesized in vitro using linearized pSV40T7-rLucRNA3 and pSV40T7-GLA plasmids as templates. the mRNAs or MHV genomic RNA was transfected into siRNA-treated cells using the TransIT-mRNA Transfection Kit (Mirus) after removal of the inoculum, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with fresh complete media 17Cl-1 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding either T7-rLucRNA3 plasmid or T7-GLA plasmid, along with plasmids encoding T7 polymerase, T7opt (24), vaccinia virus capping enzymes were omitted. at 20 h posttransfection, cells were treated with 4 g/mL actD. one microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed by SuperScript III enzyme. expression levels of target genes were determined by CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System and SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) whole-cell lysates were electrophoresed on 4 to 20% or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) whole-cell lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on 12.5% SDS/PAGE. analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Tukey test-considered significant difference as P 0.05 was used for MHV infectious titer, cell numbers, gene expression, and RNA degradation experiments. the plasmids were transfected into 17Cl-1 cells using the transIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) the plasmids were synthesized in vitro using linearized pSV40T7-rLucRNA3 and GLA plasmids as templates. cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with fresh complete media. at different times after RNA transfection, cells were directly lysed with TRIzol reagent, followed by RNA isolation. cells in chamber slides were fixed at 24 h posttransfection. plasmids encoding vaccinia virus capping enzymes were omitted. pCAGGS-CAT was used to adjust the total amount of plasmids. at 20 h posttransfection, cells were treated with 4 g/mL actD. whole-cell lysates were electrophoresed on 4 to 20% or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. the membrane was probed with specific antibodies for UPF1 (9435; Cell Signaling Technology), UPF2 (sc-20227; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SMG5 (ab33033; Abcam), SMG6 (ab87539; Abcam), and actin (sc-1616; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
