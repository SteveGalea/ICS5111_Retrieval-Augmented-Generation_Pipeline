{"summary": "influenza pandemics occur when an influenza strain with a novel HA subtype appears and spreads in the human population. pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968 and were associated with substantial illness and death. the pandemic of 1918, the \"Spanish flu,\" was caused by an influenza A virus of the H1N1 subtype. the economic costs due to deaths, illness, and hospitalizations in the united states alone, excluding disruptions to commerce and society, would be $71.3\u2013$166.5 billion (4). in the recent H5N1 outbreaks in Asia, >120 million birds died or were culled during a 3-month period (3). the estimated decreases in gross domestic product (GDP) resulting from poultry farming losses are $1.2 and $0.3 billion, respectively. H9N2 1999 Hong Kong 2 (0) Mild influenzalike illness (7) H9N2 1999 Guangdong Province, China 5 (0) Mild influenzalike illness (9) H5N1 2003 Hong Kong 2 (1) Primary viral pneumonia, lymphopenia, respiratory distress 7-year-old girl died in Fujian Province, China, and H5N1 infection was not confirmed. H9N2 viruses had become widespread in domestic chickens in Asia since 1990. both of these AI subtypes were isolated from ducks and geese in the region, suggesting a wide distribution in avian hosts. the outbreak of human H5N1 cases in 1997 ended with the depopulation of poultry markets in Hong Kong. the next influenza pandemic could possibly be caused by a different avian or reassortant virus than the highly pathogenic H5N1 AI virus now circulating in Asia. current vaccine development activities are focused on viruses of this subtype. all AI viruses are presumed to have pandemic potential. H9N2 2003 Hong Kong 1 (0) Mild influenzalike illness (9) H5N1 2003 Hong Kong 2 (1) Primary viral pneumonia, lymphopenia, respiratory distress 7-year-old girl died in Fujian Province, China. her 33-year-old father died from confirmed H5N1 influenza infection in Hong Kong, and her 8-year-old brother recovered from H5N1 infection. phylogenetic studies led to the hypothesis that the H5N1 Hong Kong viruses acquired their HA gene from an A/goose/Guangdong/1/96-like (H5N1) virus and the gene encoding NA from an A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97-like virus circulating in terrestrial poultry. the outbreak of human H5N1 cases in 1997 ended with the depopulation of the poultry markets in china. all AI viruses are presumed to have pandemic potential. the principle behind the generation of human influenza vaccines is to elicit protective antibodies directed primarily against HA, the major protective antigen of the virus that induces neutralizing antibodies. the most vulnerable sections of the population may not be the same as those seen with yearly influenza epidemics. the time before the next pandemic must be used judiciously for developing and clinically testing candidate vaccines. 2 doses needed to achieve HI titer of 1:40 in persons >32 y of age. 2 doses needed to achieve antibodies responses indicative of protection. 2 doses needed to achieve antibodies responses indicative of protection. live, attenuated AI vaccines are safe, infectious, immunogenic, nontransmissible, genetically stable, and efficacious. the vaccine seed virus development strategy is not exclusive to live, attenuated vaccines. the vaccine seed virus development strategy is not exclusive to live, attenuated vaccines. cells are cotransfected with plasmids encoding each of the 8 influenza gene segments to generate recombinant viruses that contain the HA and NA genes from AI viruses and 6 internal gene segments from the AA ca virus. a selection system is not needed to derive appropriate reassortant viruses from a background of parental viruses. the 6-2 reassortants generated by this method are selected in the presence of antiserum specific for HA and NA of the attenuated donor virus. a balance of infectivity, level of attenuation, and immunogenicity must be achieved before the next pandemic. the types of in vitro and in vivo studies will be performed to confirm the genome sequence of the vaccine viruses. the higher body temperature of the ferret may confound interpretation of studies in which replication of temperature-sensitive viruses is being assessed. vaccine viruses may also require evaluation in the standard intravenous pathogenicity test in chickens to confirm that they are not highly pathogenic in chickens. such a requirement will be guided by national agricultural authorities. a live, attenuated virus vaccine based on the AA ca donor virus has been licensed by the fda for general use in healthy persons 5\u201349 years of age. the infrastructure for manufacture and characterization of live, attenuated virus vaccines exists. a project in collaboration with industry to develop seed viruses for live, attenuated virus vaccines against influenza A viruses with pandemic potential. the risk for reassortment must be carefully considered by public health authorities before a decision is made to introduce a live, attenuated vaccine in a threatened pandemic. the interpandemic period must be used to explore the optimal scientific, manufacturing, regulatory, and clinical research strategies for developing vaccines that are effective against pandemic influenza. the vaccine seed virus development strategy is not exclusive to live, attenuated vaccines, and similar studies conducted in humans. live, attenuated AI vaccines are safe, infectious, immunogenic, nontransmissible, genetically stable, and efficacious. the vaccine candidates will be generated by plasmid-based reverse genetics. this technique allows infectious virus to be recovered from cells approved for use in human vaccine development (so-called qualified cells) reverse genetics is not needed to derive appropriate reassortant viruses from a background of parental viruses. a selection system is not needed to derive appropriate reassortant viruses from a background of parental viruses. a candidate H9N2 pandemic vaccine was generated by using this technique (37) attenuated vaccines must be able to replicate to levels that elicit a protective immune response without causing disease in the host. a balance of infectivity, level of attenuation, and immunogenicity must be achieved. in vitro studies will be performed to confirm genome sequence of the vaccine viruses. a live, attenuated virus vaccine based on the AA ca donor virus has been licensed by the fda for general use in healthy persons 5\u201349 years of age. a live, attenuated virus vaccine based on the AA ca donor virus has been licensed for general use in healthy persons 5\u201349 years of age. a project in collaboration with industry to develop seed viruses for live attenuated vaccines against influenza A viruses with pandemic potential. a major concern associated with using a live, attenuated influenza vaccine bearing genes derived from an AI virus is the risk for reassortment of the vaccine virus with a circulating influenza virus. this reassortment could result in a novel subtype of influenza that could spread in the human population. mic vaccine candidates will be performed in carefully planned and executed inpatient studies. the risk for reassortment must be carefully considered by public health authorities before a decision is made to introduce a live, attenuated vaccine in a threatened pandemic."}
