{"summary": "all work described in this study was approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine IACUC prior to initiation of the study. this program is AAALAC- accredited and is compliant with all federal regulations overseeing the use of animals in research in the united states. all data were collected during a single, 4-h period. rats were fasted for 12 to 18 h prior to euthanasia for collection of fasting blood glucose values. each pair was anesthetized at the same time by using a cocktail of ketamine. each rat was randomly assigned to a treatment group and exposed to the treatment gas. 5% isoflurane was delivered to the chamber by using a precision vaporizer, with an O2 rate of 3 L/min. at the end of the 2-min period, the rat was removed from the induction chamber, and terminal cardiac exsanguination was performed. pentobarbital (390 mg/500 g delivered at a dose of 1 mg/kg; Euthasol, Virbac Animal Health, Fort Worth, TX) was administered intrathoracically. the plates were read on an ELISA plate reader set to 450 nm by using SoftMax Pro 7.0 (Molecular Devices) concentrations were calculated by using the MD Bioproducts ACTH ELISA (405 nm) and MD Bioproducts ACTH ELISA (450 nm) assays on MyAssays.com. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were first-generation offspring from a breeding study. all rats were pair-housed prior to euthanasia and had not been exposed to any other experimental manipulation. rats were fasted for 12 to 18 h prior to euthanasia for collection of fasting blood glucose values. each pair was anesthetized at the same time by using a cocktail of ketamine (80 mg/mL; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) and xylazine (4 mg/mL; Bayer, Whippany, NJ) after which the rats returned to their home cage. the rat was removed from the induction chamber and terminal cardiac exsanguination was performed. pentobarbital (390 mg/500 g delivered at a dose of 1 mg/kg; Euthasol, Virbac Animal Health, Fort Worth, TX) was administered intrathoracically. blood glucose was measured immediately, and the remainder of the blood sample was split between an EDTA-treated tube and a serum-separator tube. the plates were read on an ELISA plate reader set to 450 nm by using SoftMax Pro 7.0 (Molecular Devices) concentrations were calculated by using the MD Bioproducts ACTH ELISA (405 nm) and MD Bioproducts ACTH ELISA (450 nm) assays on myAssays.com. serum noradrenaline and ACTH were higher after exposure to CO2 as compared with exposure to oxygen or isoflurane. there were no significant differences between sexes (P = 0.5554) or interaction between treatment group and sex (P = 0.9153). male rats had higher serum ACTH concentrations (43.71 8.33 pg/mL) than females (19.74 9.62 pg/mL; P = 0.0418) isoflurane euthanasia may be useful for comparing concentrations of CO2 or changes relative to baseline. however, these markers were included in this study to evaluate whether the use of these 2 measures was confounded in studies using prolonged euthanasia. study draws into question whether noradrenaline and ACTH actually measure a fear response when they are used in welfare studies of anesthesia and euthanasia. the current findings suggest that noradrenaline and ACTH should be interpreted with caution to assess animal wellbeing between methods of euthanasia."}
