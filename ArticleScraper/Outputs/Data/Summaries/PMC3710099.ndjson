{"summary": "HEPN superfamily is comprised of all -helical domains that were first identified as being associated with DNA polymerase -type nucleotidyltransferases in prokaryotes and animal Sacsin proteins. results We vastly extend the HEPN superfamily by identifying numerous novel families and by detecting diverged HEPN domains in several known protein families. HEPN domains include direct attack on viral RNAs (e.g. LsoA and RNase LS) and suicidal attack coupled with direct interaction with phage components. findings are compatible with the hypothesis on coupling of pathogen-targeting (immunity) and self-directed (programmed cell death and dormancy induction) responses in the evolution of robust antiviral strategies. the deployment of enzymatic toxins that target nucleic acids is a common feature of biological conflicts at all levels [1-5] these enzymes disrupt nucleic acids by cleaving their backbones, breaking glycosidic linkages between sugars and bases, or modifying bases. in eukaryotes, RNases are also represented among the toxin domains of various colicin-type bacteriocins. i system components, the interferon-induced RNase L in eukaryotes [20], and probably the RNases associated with the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity systems in prokaryotes [4,21,22]. these include many of the toxin tips of the polymorphic toxins employed in intra-species conflicts, the fungal killer toxins and effectors deployed by bacteria against hosts or competitors [2,23,24]. HEPN domain was identified in proteins encoded by genes that co-localize with genes encoding minimal nucleotidyltransferases (MNTs) that belong to the DNA polymerase superfamily. this strict association led to the suggestion that HEPN domains functioned in conjunction with the associated MNT domains. distinct versions of the HEPN domain were found independent of the MNT gene-neighborhoods in association with some other domains. the two component MNT-HEPN module has been predicted to function as a type II TA system, with MNT that appeared to be the only active enzyme in the system predicted to be the toxin and the HEPN domain the antitoxin. the HEPN domains of several polymerase -superfamily proteins are currently included in the Pfam clan named CL0291. of these, DUF86 includes proteins, most of which were reported as being encoded by genes adjacent to those for MNTs [41,42]. however, several representatives of DUF4145 are fused to restriction endonuclease (REase) and superfamily-II helicase modules. multiple sequence alignment includes conserved blocks based on the MUSCLE alignment [45], which was corrected manually on the basis of HHpred [46] and PSI-BLAST results [47]. secondary structure, which is a consensus between the proteins with solved structures, is shown above the alignment; \u2018H\u2019 indicates -helix. The sequences are denoted by their GI numbers and species names. the mRNA cleaving RNase LS family implicated in the defense against enterobacteriophage T4 [48,49], the tRNA anti-codon loop-cleaving RNase domains of RloC [50] and PrrC [51] also involved in the restriction of T4 [52], and the kinase-extension nuclease (KEN) domain of RNase L which is involved in specialized splicing reactions and interfer proteins with conserved D in place of H have conserved H elsewhere. mainly Bacteria HEPN-M (PF08780/DUF86-PF01934) Mostly conserved. mainly conserved (80%) Fused to Restriction Endonuclease (REase, SF-II-Helicase); Sel1, Zinc Ribbon, TM and SH3 (Firmicutes), UvrD Helicase (endoV alpha subunit); SIGMA-HTH; DpnII/MboI-NTD; AbiJ-NTD1.

APECO1_4465 is also found in prophages Bacteria ERFG_01251 Yes Fused to ABC-ATPase and HEPN/TOPRIM-NTD1 Bacteria ApeA/BMEI1217. many of the newly detected HEPN families showed additional connections to antiviral defense functions. most notably, 6 families of domains, respectively, were characterized as novel versions of the HEPN domain. HEPN superfamily several of which can be further grouped together into higher order assemblages based on preferential recovery in profile searches. other new HEPN domain families are labeled as \u201cdomains of unknown function\u201d in the PFAM database, namely DUF3644, DUF4209, DUF2526, Ymh. the spacing between the conserved arginine and histidine in this motif was found to be more variable, with some families showing a 6 residue spacer instead of the typical 4. many of the HEPN families contain a second conserved acidic residue, typically as part of a Ex3 [KR]motif. conserved Rx4-6H motif of the HEPN domain is the primary determinant of a novel RNase active site. this active site is probably further augmented by the above-mentioned conserved acidic residue, which is typically found further upstream. the conserved H in the HEPN domain can be predicted to induce the 2\u2019OH to attack the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA. helix-1 (H1) and helix-2 (H2) from the first -hairpin are colored green and blue, respectively. helix-3 (H3) and helix-4 (H4) from the second -hairpin are colored cyan and yellow, respectively. conserved active site residues are rendered as ball and sticks and colored and labeled in red. structural features of the HEPN domain and the remarkable structural rearrangement in the HEPN from CRISPR-Cas systems. a comparison of these structures showed that the HEPN domain adopts a four-helical up-down fold similar to the fold of the coat proteins of plant rod-shaped RNA viruses (e.g. tobacco mosaic virus) the HEPN domain is distinguished from other domains with a comparable four-helical fold by the frequent presence of inserts between helix-2 and helix-3 which assume the form a long loop, an additional helical element or even a helical hairpin. the sequence of this insert is poorly conserved, causing most uncertainties in the sequence alignment. the region containing the Rx4-6H motif displays residues in non-helical conformations, resulting in distortion of the helical axis in the C-terminal portion of helix-3. this distortion could indicate selection for flexibility in this region, which might be required for effective catalysis or for binding the nucleic acid substrate. all four families are predicted to be active RNases given the strong conservation of the Rx4-6H motif. despite identification of HEPN domains in some well-studied protein families, the biological functions of the majority of the HEPN domains remain obscure. we systematically collected HEPN domain-containing proteins from the non-redundant database (See Additional file 1) and determined their phyletic patterns (i.e. the patterns of presence-absence in different taxa) we discuss below the salient findings emerging from this analysis. Selected novel domains fused to HEPN domains. it is also found fused to other domains potentially involved in biological conflicts. abiJ-NTD3 140 aa; e.g. 1 to 142 aa; Alpha + beta Found fused to AbiJ. other domains presumably involved in defense: ABC ATPase (gi:319955098) some of those fused to RES have a further N-terminal Zn ribbon domain pneumoniae 342 HEPN/Toprim-NTD1 240 aa. some of those fused to RES have a further N-terminal Zn ribbon domain pneumoniae 342 HEPN/Toprim-NTD1 240 aa; (e.g. 1 to 240 aa, gi: 423201025; HMPREF1167_01188 Aero mainly beta strands Found at the N-terminus of certain members of the MAE_18760 family AAA-ATPase (Ava_2192-CTD) 300aa; (e.g. 160 to 460aa gi:75908411, Ava_2192, Anabaena variabilis) eukaryotes the distribution of HEPN domains shows two distinct patterns. one group of HEPN families is strongly conserved across all major eukaryotic lineages implying they were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. the emergence of the KEN domain appears to have been linked to the origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system. the emergence of the KEN domain appears to have been linked to the origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system. the C6orf70 family contains a single transmembrane region and is predicted to localize to the ER membrane. the labels of eukaryotes are colored green. uncharacterized globular domains of limited phyletic spread are shown. the generic functional categories are shown in red letters. eukaryotes have a distinct, catalytically active HEPN domain of the Swt1 family. the expanded KEN and Swt1 family HEPN domains are inferred to be catalytically active. this pattern is common among eukaryotic genes with immunity- or defense-related functions. some of the nematode HEPN domains are fused to an inactive ATPase domain closely related to the N-terminal ATPase domain of the LAF-1/Vasa-like RNA helicases. these helicases are components of the P granules of germline precursor cells which contain RNA-interacting components that silence pseudogenes and transposons. in PrrC and RloC the C-terminal HEPN domain is combined with N-terminal SbcC/Rad50-like ABC NTPase domains. this regulates the activity of the nuclease domain in a manner dependent on NTP hydrolysis (in both) or sensing nucleotides (dTTP in PrrC) at least 16 distinct clades of HEPN domain proteins are encoded by genes that are linked to a diverse array of R-M systems through conserved gene neighborhoods. these associations are primarily represented in bacteria where they comprise one of the most common genomic contexts of HEPN genes. by analogy to the PrrC-PrrI linkage, we propose that these associations represent different multi-pronged defense strategies. several HEPN domains of the Ymh (Pfam: PF09509) family are fused to the C-termini of ATPases of the GHKL superfamily, known as paraMORCs [87], in proteins encoded by genes embedded in R-M systems. the paraMORC domains appear to function analogous to the latter in both R-M and other contexts. multiple, independent fusions of the HEPN domain with SWI2/SNF2 helicases, EcoEI-like superfamily(SF)-II helicases and SF-I helicases are the helicase subunits found in several distinct R-M systems. a HEPN domain of the Abi2/SWT1 family is fused to a distinct version of the AAA + ATPase domain (currently labeled DUF499 in the RNase LS and LsoA are indiscriminate mRNases that cleave both free and ribosome-associated transcripts. these endoRNases can degrade host mRNA, but appear to be primarily directed against viral mRNAs. these endoRNases cleave both free and ribosome-associated transcripts. RnlAB appears to be a defense system that functions at the RNA-level rather than in conjunction with any DNA-level restriction system. in most cases, the RNase LS family HEPN domain is fused to an N-terminal caulimovirus-like RNase H fold domain. the presence of this RNase H module suggests that these RNase LS family proteins specifically target RNA in DNA-RNA duplexes. a case in point is the fusion of HEPN with a C-terminal RNase III and a dsRBD domain (e.g. in Dicer, a key component of the eukaryotic RNAi system) a distinct family of HEPN domains shows fusions to the endoRNase L-PSP domain that is known to cleave mRNAs. the NamA domain contains a novel version of RNase H fold with two large inserts within the conserved core of the fold. however, the NamA domains retain all the key active site residues that are required for the ribonuclease activity of RNase H. the NamA genes co-localize, either with or without HEPN genes, with a gene coding for a KorC-like DNA-binding HTH domains. the primary components of 6 Abi systems define distinct groups of HEPN domains, namely the AbiA-C-terminal domain (AbiA-CTD), AbiD (including AbiD1), AbiF, AbiJ, AbiU2 and AbiV families. the detection of HEPN domains suggests a unified mechanism for their action, based on the predicted RNase activity. the detection of a C-terminal HEPN domain in the AbiA proteins suggests that it might also promote cell suicide mediated by the HEPN domains. the detection of a C-terminal HEPN domain in the abiA proteins suggests that it might also promote cell suicide mediated by the HEPN activity. members of the MAE_18760 family of HEPN domains (Table 1) have not been recovered among currently known abi systems. they display architectures similar to those of abi proteins, with fusions to three distinct NTD domains. one is the previously described Schlafen domain which is also found fused to other domains implicated in intra-genomic conflicts. HEPN domain also occurs fused to RES, a toxin domain found in several type-II TA and polymorphic toxin systems. the nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase domain is not a nuclease, but it cleaves the glycosidic bond between base and deoxyribose. this enzyme is likely to act on DNA in a manner similar to the effect of Ricin-like toxins on the CARF domains are fused to a different RNase (e.g. RelE, HD or PIN superfamily) or DNase (recB-like REase fold nuclease) domains instead of the HEPN domain at their C-termini. these nuclease-containing CARF domain proteins do not appear to be involved in spacer acquisition or spacer-sequence-dependent restriction of foreign nucleic acids in the CRISPR-C a similar localization was observed for a small subset of the HEPN domains of the RloC family (e.g. gi: 209885297) prophage-encoded enzymes play a comparable role in preventing infection by other phages, probably independent of R-M systems. the phage growth limitation (Pgl) system was first characterized as a defense system against lysogenic phages (e.g. phiC31) in Streptomyces coelicolor. the gene for the HEPN protein is methylated by the Pgl system methylases and restricted upon reinfection by its DNase components. sporadic couplings with HEPN domain and the thermonuclease could induce cell suicide but the antitoxin gene occupies the 5\u2019 position upstream of the toxin gene. the antitoxin activity of MNT might involve nucleotidylation of the HEPN toxin, possibly at a conserved tyrosine that is present in the C-terminal region of most HEPN domains associated with MNTs. the HEPN domains that are fused to MNT domains within a multidomain protein typically lack the predicted RNase catalytic residues. this interaction appears to have given rise to protein-modifying regulatory enzymes such as the nucleotidyltransferases, which regulate glutamine synthetase. a subset of the HEPN domains found in these systems preserve the Rx4-6H motif. they are likely to function as endoRNases, similar to toxins in various TA systems. however, no conserved, potential active site residues are found in several HEPN domains from the MNT-HEPN systems. several chromosomally encoded TA systems are important players in stress adaptation. this could be mediated by the MNT-HEPN module when the activity of the HEPN domain is unmasked by degradation or misfolding of the MNT component. ase modules followed by a DnaJ domain, which recruits Hsp70 [129] and a C-terminal HEPN domain. the HEPN domain in Sacsin orthologs from several animals preserves the conserved motif. however, in organisms like humans it lacks the conserved motif. at least three groups of HEPN domains are combined with TM segments. the first belongs to the family that overlaps with the Pfam DUF4145 family. a distinct group of catalytically active HEPN domains of the Abi2/SWT1 family are fused to a single, well-conserved TM helix. HEPN proteins process RNAs on the inner side of the membrane. the specialized TM segments with the WP signature and the potential external domains could act as sensors for stimuli on the cell surface. resulting signal could affect the HEPN domain conformation and hence RNA stability. the human CXorf38 is strongly overexpressed in B lymphoblasts and CD56+ NK cells. the deATH domains and NACHT NTPase modules could link the action of the HEPN domain to an apoptotic and/or defensive response. the presence of the dsRBD containing versions of the CXorf38 family is suggestive of activity on dsRNA substrates. the aegerolysin domains could ensure trafficking across the bounding vacuolar membrane and thus enable the interaction between the host RNAs and the HEPN domains. the aegerolysin domains could ensure trafficking across the bounding vacuolar membrane and thus enable the interaction between the host RNAs. HHpred and hMM searches were seeded with all the borderline hits that shared the conserved motif with the HEPN domain. alignments were used to initiate profile-profile searches with the HHpred program against a library of profiles based on Pfam, Interpro and those prepared using sequences from the PDB structural database [44]. the numbers (of amino acid residues) within the alignment represent poorly conserved inserts that are not shown. 'h' indicates hydrophobic residues (WFYMLIVACTH), \u2018p\u2019 indicates polar residues (EDKRNQHTS), \u2018s\u2019 indicates small residues (ACDGNPSTV). GI and species name is underlined if the HEPN domain has lost the conserved Rx4-6H motif. RNA at the nuclear pore to prevent their exit to the cytoplasm [56] also displayed a previously unknown version of HEPN domain. conservation of Rx4-6H salient architecture and operons Phyletic pattern, available structures and comments. Mostly conserved (83%) Occasionally fused to MNT, a previously undetected archaeal Holliday junction resolvase-like REase (Additional file 1), and nucleic acid methylase domains. Usually part of the glutamine synthetase modifying complex. in operon with R-M, TerD, McrB/C and symE toxin c2405 Conserved H but lacks R Fused to N-terminal AbiTii domain and in a few cases to a C-terminal Helix-hairpin-helix domain Bacteria MtlR 60% Most often a part of mannitol operon with other mannitol utilization genes gamma proteobacteria p the human gene is highly expressed in B lymphoblasts and CD56+ NK cells suggesting this group might be involved in RNA virus defense. other Fusions to TM (STY4199), active; Phospholipase D Nuclease (SAV_2148), inactive; ParB (Saro_3948), mostly active; and ParB (DUF262) with HNH(DUF2081). Bacteria > Archaea In operon with R-M system Bacteria MAE_28990 MAE_28990 Yes Fused to HEPN/RES-NTD1, HEPN/Toprim-NTD1, Schlafen and a novel beta rich domain. this family can be traced to LECA Occurs in R-M related operons DUF2526 (PF10735) Yes None detected Gammaproteobacteria KEN (RnaseL/Ire1) Mostly conserved (95%) Fused to S/T/Y-Kinase, along with ankyrin repeats, CCCH in some. APECO1_4465 is also found in prophages Bacteria ERFG_01251 Yes Fused to ABC-ATPase and HEPN/TOPRIM-NTD1 Bacteria ApeA/BMEI1217 Yes Some in operon with R-M genes, ADP-ribosyltransferase-like enzymes and Macro. the eponymous abortive phage infection genes from lactococcus lactis, were characterized as novel versions of the HEPN domain. we also identified novel versions of the HEPN domain that comprised the C-terminal modules in a large group of COG1517-related proteins. these findings suggested previously unappreciated roles of HEPN domains in RNA-processing, both in defense and in cellular RNA maturation. alignments were used to predict secondary structure using the JPRED program. resulting alignments were used to generate a comprehensive structural alignment of the HEPN domain superfamily. the original analysis of the HEPN domain identified a conserved motif, Rx4H (where x is any amino acid) mutagenesis of the KEN domain of RNase L and the RNase domains of RloC and PrrC have shown that the conserved arginine corresponding to the conserved H in the Rx4-6H motif is essential for their respective nuclease activities. the conserved arginine from this motif was also found to be necessary for the RNase activity. helix-1 (H1) and helix-2 (H2) from the first -hairpin are colored green and blue, respectively, and helix-3 (H3) and helix-4 (H4) from the second -hairpin are colored cyan and yellow, respectively. the conserved insert region found between helix-2 and helix-3 in the canonical configuration is colored and labeled in light grey. some families HEPN domains show variations in the conserved motif. the H is present but the R from the Rx4-6H is not conserved. however, this family contains other strongly conserved basic residues elsewhere. the HEPN domain adopts a four-helical up-down fold similar to the fold of the coat proteins of plant rod-shaped RNA viruses (e.g. tobacco mosaic virus) and cytochrome C (Figure 2). the HEPN domain is distinguished from other domains with a comparable four-helical fold by the frequent presence of inserts between helix-2 and helix-3. the Rx4-6H motif is situated at the end of helix-3 and in the beginning of the loop connecting helix-3 to helix-4. the conserved acidic residue in this motif is always exposed to the solvent and available for catalysis. the alternative conserved histidine in the HEPN-T proteins comes from the above-mentioned inserted between helix-2 and helix-3. the HEPN family underwent a complex structural transformation while preserving the active site motif of the HEPN domains. despite identification of HEPN domains in some well-studied protein families, the biological functions of the majority of the HEPN domains remain obscure. sequence-profile and HMM searches were carried out to further characterize these domains. in the case of prokaryotic representatives, operons or conserved gene-neighborhoods were inferred using genomic information. resulting inferences were employed to predict functional associations based on the tendency of products of genes co-occurring in operons to functionally interact. many abiJ_NTD2 sequences have been erroneously included in the DUF3644 Pfam model. profile-profile searches do not demonstrate an independent relationship between abiJ_NTD2 and HEPN independently. some of those fused to RES have a further N-terminal Zn ribbon domain pneumoniae 342 HEPN/Toprim-NTD1 240 aa. some have a further N-terminal DnaG-like CxxH-CxxC Zn ribbon domain abiTii 180aa. Mostly alpha helical with a conserved beta strand next to the first alpha helix This domain can be unified the -helical domain found at the N-termini of the type-II REases DpnII and MboI. Novel REase (MTES_1575_REase) 180aa (e.g., 1810..1990 aa gi: 323358023, MTES_1575, Microbacterium testaceum) wHTH fold Fused to HEPN (SWT1/Abi2 family), along with Transglutaminase and Vsr\u2013family REase domains. eukaryotes the distribution of HEPN domains shows two distinct patterns. one group of HEPN families is strongly conserved across all major eukaryotic lineages implying they were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) one group of HEPN families is strongly conserved across all major eukaryotic lineages. eukaryote-specific processing of the ITS2 linker between the 5.8S and 25S/28S rRNAs in their common precursor remains unknown. the identity of the endonuclease required for initiating this processing event remains unknown. eukaryotic variants of the HEPN domain originated by rapid sequence evolution from either a bacterial or an archaeal HEPN ancestor at the stem phase of eukaryote evolution antedating the LECA. both the C6orf70 and Swt1 families include catalytically active bacterial versions, pointing to their origin via lateral transfer. nematodes of the genus Caenorhadbditis acquired a representative of the paREP1/8 family. it underwent independent LSE in C. elegans and C. remanei. this pattern of multiple independent LSEs is common among eukaryotic genes with immunity- or defense-related functions. PrrC and RloC are both anticodon nucleases (ACNases), which target tRNALys of the host cell to inhibit translation during the T4 infection. each endoRNase has distinct biochemistry. each endoRNase is part of fine-tuned defense systems that are regulated via interactions with domains in the same polypeptide. the HEPN nuclease domain of PrrC appears to be activated when the conformation of the ABC-ATPase domain is modified in response to genotoxic stress induced by the virus. the results of these studies imply that analysis of the gene neighborhoods and domain architectures of the prokaryotic HEPN domains might help uncover multi-pronged defense strategies that evolved through the arms race between viruses and their hosts. some PrrC-like proteins are encoded by genomic loci that combine genes for R-M system components and those for RhuM-like proteins. in these gene neighborhoods the RhuM-like protein occupies a position similar to that of the DOC toxin in the neighborhoods discussed above. we also found that several HEPN domains of the Ymh (Pfam: PF09509) family are fused to the C-termini of ATPases of the GHKL gene name, Genbank identifier (gi) and species name of the starred gene are shown next to the operon. the multi-gene modules that always co-occur are boxed. the depicted operons are typically representative of a types of operons found in diverse organisms. HEPN domains fuse only to restriction endonucleases, helicases and other ATPase subunits but not to the methylases. these multiple, convergent fusions imply strong selection for functional linking of the HEPN domains that are associated with R-M systems. this is reversibly inhibited by the associated R-M system subunits. a further line of defense might involve protein cleavage catalyzed by this domain. the HEPN domain proteins RNase LS and LsoA are indiscriminate mRNases that cleave both free and ribosome-associated transcripts. if phage T4 inhibits production of host proteins, the RnlB proteins are removed through degradation, unleashing the RNase activity of the HEPN domain. a subset of the RNase LS family HEPN domains target RNA in DNA-RNA duplexes. a case in point is the fusion of HEPN with a C-terminal RNase III and a dsRBD domain (e.g. in the cyanobacterium Lyngbya) fusions to the endoRNase L-PSP domain are known to cleave mRNAs. these HEPN proteins may also target mRNAs analogously to the members of the RNase LS family. the NamA domain contains a novel version of RNase H fold with two large inserts within the conserved core. RNA ligase-dependent repair systems can easily restore RNAs with single endonucleolytic breaks. such combinations of RNases could be involved in cleavage of RNAs with complex secondary structures. the abortive infection (Abi) systems, of which over 22 distinct versions were first characterized in Lactococcus lactis (labeled AbiA to AbiV), represent anti-bacteriophage strategies. the detection of a HEPN domain in the AbiA proteins suggests that it might also promote cell suicide mediated by the RNase activity of HEPN. the detection of a C-terminal HEPN domain in the AbiA proteins suggests that it might also promote cell suicide mediated by the RNase activity of HEPN. abiJ-NTD1-5 is a novel + globular domain with a highly conserved glutamate. fusions include other HEPN domains (Ymh family with AbiJ-NTD1 and AbiJ-NTD2), HKD/phospholipase fold nucleases, TIR domains. HEPN domains (Table 1) have not been recovered among currently known Abi systems. they display architectures similar to those of abi proteins, with fusions to three distinct NTD domains. one is the previously described Schlafen domain which is also found fused to other domains implicated in intra-genomic conflicts. the enzymatic domains of these proteins are likely to be deployed as toxins that could cause cell suicide. the NTDs also might function as antitoxins that inhibit the enzymatic activity of the C-terminal toxin domain under normal conditions. this inhibition is relieved when the NTDs interact with viral components. these parallel domain architectures clearly resemble those of the three AbiJ-NTD domains discussed in previous section. we propose that the CARF-HEPN proteins function analogously so that the CARF domain is a specific sensor for an invasive component (DNA or RNA) whereas the HEPN domain acts as a suicidal RNase. ERFG_01251 couples an N-terminal ABC domain with a classical HEPN domain that is more closely related to the HEPN domains associated with MNTs. these proteins are encoded by genes embedded within CRISPR-Cas gene neighborhoods (e.g. in Neisseria and Kingella) these proteins might perform roles similar to those proposed for the CARF-HEPN proteins. sporadic couplings with HEPN domain and the thermonuclease could induce cell suicide. sporadic couplings with HEPN domain and the thermonuclease could induce cell suicide. a recent genome-scale assay for bacterial toxins implicated the HEPN domain. the antitoxin gene occupies the 5\u2019 position upstream of the toxin gene dyads. this operon organization ensures that the antitoxin is produced first and is available to inactivate the toxin as soon as the latter is synthesized. the antitoxin activity of MNT might involve nucleotidylation of the HEPN toxin. a gene dyad combines a HEPN gene of the MAE_18760 family with a gene coding for a ParA/Soj-like ATPase. the ATPase gene occupies a position equivalent to that of the MNT in the MNT-HEPN modules. the antitoxin activity of the HEPN protein could involve a nucleotide-dependent conformational change in the HEPN protein. a large fraction is likely to be inactive on account of the loss of the conserved motif. the gene coding for MtlR is frequently found in an operon with mannitol utilization genes. however, it has been shown that MtlR is unlikely to act as a conventional DNA-binding transcription factor. the HEPN domain is mutated in human patients with spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay. the HEPN domain in Sacsin orthologs from several animals preserves the conserved motif. however, in organisms like humans it lacks the conserved motif. integron cassettes are known to be activated by stress conditions. the integron family is known to be major vehicles in the spread of drug resistance determinants among proteobacterial pathogens. integron cassettes are known to be activated by stress conditions. a distinct group of catalytically active HEPN domains fused to the C-terminus of a single, well-conserved TM helix. in the third group the N-terminal HEPN domain is separated from the C-terminal Zn-ribbon domain by a pair of TM helices. this localization suggests that, similar to the Ire1 and C6orf70 proteins in eukaryotes, these HEPN proteins process several eukaryote-specific domain architectures have been found. eukaryotes are fused to dsRBD domains in vertebrates, cephalochordates, hemichordates and cnidarians. the dsRBD family is one of the novel families of HEPN domains identified in this work. a group of HEPN domains of the Swt1 family prototyped by the MAL13P1.321 protein from Plasmodium falciparum was found to be conserved throughout apicomplexa. these proteins combine a pair of aegerolysin domains with C-terminal HEPN domains. these proteins could ensure trafficking across the bounding vacuolar membrane and thus enable protein translocation across the lipid bilayer. the emergence of the KEN domain appears to have been linked to the origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system. the emergence of the KEN domain appears to have been linked to the origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system. the C6orf70 family contains a single transmembrane region and is predicted to localize to the ER membrane. eukaryotes name, genebank identifier (gi) number, and species name separated by semicolons. uncharacterized globular domains of limited phyletic spread are shown with a grey rectangle. eukaryotes have a distinct, catalytically active HEPN domain of the Swt1 family. this is more closely related to the bacterial versions than the conserved version in Swt1. the expanded KEN and Swt1 family HEPN domains are inferred to be catalytically active and can be predicted to function as defensive endoRNases. some of the nematode HEPN domains are fused to an inactive ATPase domain closely related to the N-terminal ATPase domain of the LAF-1/Vasa-like RNA helicases. this is possible because these HEPN proteins form a line of defense for the germline genome against selfish elements. in PrrC and RloC the C-terminal HEPN domain is combined with N-terminal SbcC/Rad50-like ABC NTPase domains [84] which regulate the activity of the nuclease domain in a manner dependent on NTP hydrolysis (in both) or sensing nucleotides (dTTP in PrrC) PrrC is embedded in a gene-neighborhood that also encodes the three subunits at least 16 distinct clades of HEPN domain proteins are encoded by genes that are linked to a diverse array of R-M systems through conserved gene neighborhoods. these associations are primarily represented in bacteria where they comprise one of the most common genomic contexts of HEPN genes. by analogy to the PrrC-PrrI linkage, we propose that these associations represent different multi-pronged defense strategies. several HEPN domains of the Ymh (Pfam: PF09509) family are fused to the C-termini of ATPases of the GHKL superfamily, known as paraMORCs [87], in proteins encoded by genes embedded in R-M systems. the paraMORC domains appear to function analogous to PrrC and RloC. multiple, independent fusions of the HEPN domain with SWI2/SNF2 helicases, EcoEI-like superfamily(SF)-II helicases and SF-I helicases are the helicase subunits found in several distinct R-M systems. in another class of R-M systems, a HEPN domain of the Abi2/SWT1 family is fused to a distinct version of the AAA + ATPase domain. HEPN domains in bacterial RNA-based defense systems are indiscriminate mRNases that cleave both free and ribosome-associated transcripts. the mRNase activity of these HEPN domains is reversibly inhibited by the associated R-M system subunits but is released from this block when the R-M system is neutralized by a virus counter-strategy. RnlAB appears to be a defense system that primarily functions at the RNA-level rather than in conjunction with any DNA-level restriction system. in most cases, the RNase LS family HEPN domain is fused to an N-terminal caulimovirus-like RNase H fold domain. the presence of this RNase H module suggests that these RNase LS family proteins specifically target RNA in DNA-RNA duplexes. a case in point is the fusion of HEPN with a C-terminal RNase III and a dsRBD domain. a distinct family of HEPN domains shows fusions to the endoRNase L-PSP domain that is known to cleave mRNAs. these HEPN proteins might also target mRNAs analogously to the members of the RNase LS family. the NamA domain contains a novel version of RNase H fold with two large inserts within the conserved core of the fold. the NamA domains retain all the key active site residues that are required for the ribonuclease activity of RNase H. the NamA genes also co-localize, either with or without HEPN genes, with a gene coding for a KorC-like DNA-binding HTH domains. the primary components of 6 Abi systems define distinct groups of HEPN domains, namely the AbiA-C-terminal domain (AbiA-CTD), AbiD (including AbiD1), AbiF, AbiJ, AbiU2 and AbiV families. the detection of HEPN domains suggests a unified mechanism for their action, based on the predicted RNase activity. the detection of a C-terminal HEPN domain in the AbiA proteins suggests that it might also promote cell suicide mediated by the RNase activity of HEPN. the detection of a C-terminal HEPN domain in the abiA proteins suggests that it might also promote cell suicide mediated by the HEPN domains. members of the MAE_18760 family of HEPN domains (Table 1) have not been recovered among currently known abi systems. they display architectures similar to those of abi proteins, with fusions to three distinct NTD domains. one is the previously described Schlafen domain which is also found fused to other domains implicated in intra-genomic conflicts. a third NTD occurs fused to RES, a toxin domain found in several type-II TA and polymorphic toxin systems. the nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase domain is not a nuclease, but it cleaves the glycosidic bond between base and deoxyribose. this enzyme is likely to act on DNA in a manner similar to the effect of Ricin-like toxins on all show a conserved domain architectural core comprised of a distinct N-terminal Rossmann fold domain, (CRISPR-Cas associated Rossmann fold or CARF) the CARF domains are fused to a different RNase (e.g. RelE, HD or PIN superfamily) or DNase (RecB-like REase fold nuclease) domains instead of the HEPN domain at their C-termini. a similar localization was observed for a small subset of the HEPN domains of the RloC family (e.g. gi: 209885297) prophage-encoded ABC-HEPN proteins play a comparable role in preventing infection by other phages. sporadic couplings with HEPN domain and the thermonuclease could induce cell suicide. sporadic couplings with HEPN domain and the thermonuclease could induce cell suicide but additionally or alternatively might cleave phage RNAs to limit the phage burst size. the antitoxin gene occupies the 5\u2019 position upstream of the toxin gene. a recent genome-scale assay for bacterial toxins implicated the HEPN domain. the antitoxin activity of MNT might involve nucleotidylation of the HEPN toxin. toxins and antitoxins of type II TA systems typically strongly interact with each other. this interaction appears to have been exapted to utilize the HEPN domain as a substrate-binding or regulatory domain for the MNTs. the HEPN domains that are fused to MNT domains within a multidomain protein typically lack the predicted RNase catalytic residues and accordingly are most likely inactive. no conserved, potential active site residues are found in several HEPN domains from the MNT-HEPN systems. the genome-scale scan for toxin proteins revealed that even HEPN proteins lacking this motif are effective as toxins. a large fraction is likely to be inactive on account of the loss of the conserved motif. lR family may function as RNA-binding proteins that repress the mannitol operon by blocking either transcription elongation or translation. some chromosomally encoded TA systems are important players in stress adaptation such as dormancy and stationary phase survival in various bacteria. the HEPN domain in Sacsin orthologs from several animals preserves the conserved motif. in certain animals, there are Sacsin paralogs with N-terminal DEATH domains that are major apoptosis-mediating adaptor domains. the integron cassettes are known to be activated by stress conditions. at least three distinct groups of HEPN domains are combined with TM segments. the first belongs to the family that overlaps with the Pfam DUF4145 family. a distinct group of catalytically active HEPN domains are fused to the C-terminus of a single, well-conserved TM helix. HEPN proteins process RNAs on the inner side of the membrane. the specialized TM segments with the WP signature and the potential external domains could act as sensors for stimuli on the cell surface. resulting signal could affect the HEPN domain conformation and hence RNA stability. the human CXorf38 is strongly overexpressed in B lymphoblasts and CD56+ NK cells. the deATH domains and NACHT NTPase modules could link the action of the HEPN domain to an apoptotic and/or defensive response. some of these eukaryotic domain architectures are also reminiscent of bacterial proteins (e.g. 229028907 from Bacillus cereus) the aegerolysin domains could ensure trafficking across the bounding vacuolar membrane and thus enable the interaction between the host RNAs and the HEPN domains. a second group of HEPN domains, Csx1 from archaeal type III CRISPR-Cas systems, is also conserved across most major archaeal lineages. synthesis reveals a common evolutionary thread passing through what were previously considered merely analogous defense mechanisms in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. there is an obvious evolutionary and functional connection between the suicidal action of the eukaryotic KEN domains and a host of prokaryotic HEPN toxins. HEPN and functionally similar RNase genes may spread through transfer of DNA from the dead cell to related or unrelated cells. the HEPN domains and functionally similar RNases might also limit the phage burst size even when all mechanisms of defense have failed to terminate the infection. the findings appear to offer strong support for the recent hypothesis that proposes echeloning of directed attack on viral macromolecules. the emergence of an intracellular membrane system in the incipient eukaryotic cell could have resulted in a strong selective pressure for mechanisms to cope with the overloading of the ER system with unfolded proteins. the emergence of an intracellular membrane system in the incipient eukaryotic cell could have resulted in a strong selective pressure for mechanisms to cope with the overloading of the ER system. iterative profile searches with the PSI-BLAST [47] and JACKHMMER [152] programs were used to retrieve homologous sequences in the protein non-redundant database at the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) for most searches a cut-off e-value of 0.01 was used to assess significance. strand of DNA and shared a common promoter to be counted as a single operon. we filtered the data using an intergenic distance criterion of 100 nt for genes to belong to a predicted operon. a complete list of gene identifiers for proteins investigated is provided in the Additional file 1. authors have corrected the text to reflect the Pfam nomenclature accurately. they indicated that their searches retrieved proteins that belong to three families of this clan. the Pfam clan also includes GlnD_UR_UTase, NTase_sub_bind, PaREP1 and DUF294_C domain families. we used two criteria: 1) proximity and 2) conservation of gene-neighborhoods across phylogenetically distant groups of prokaryotes. this data was extracted for each genome using the RefSeq database when possible or the whole-genome-shotgun sequence when the respective genome was missing in RefSeq. Igor Zhulin is a strong, encyclopedic survey and analysis of a large and diverse family of important protein domain families. authors did an excellent job in finding them and then proving their relatedness using extensive profile-profile comparisons and structural considerations. authors have decided not to list minor technical points, especially because 50 pages without line and page numbering are hard on a reviewer. the Pfam models labeled GlnD_UR_UTase, NTase_sub_bind and DUF294_C are C-terminal domains of the polymerase \u2013superfamily. we have now modified the text to state clear which Pfam models correspond to the several polymerase \u2013superfamily proteins we mention in the text. displaying both depictions has some value because the first reflect the \u201cnatural\u201d clustering based on the Kamada-Kawai algorithm. the second is the knowledge-based manual clustering of functions. we have now modified the figure with the N- and C- terminus labeled. services (National Library of Medicine, NIH)."}
