{"summary": "the common cold was a common illness in Team Finland during the 2018 winter Olympic Games. there were 44 elite athletes and 68 staff members. the chief physician recorded the symptoms of the common cold daily on a standardised form. the common cold has been said to be \u2018the most dreaded opponent\u2019 at the Winter Olympic Games. more than 10 species of respiratory viruses exist, and they contain hundreds of subspecies with different immunopathologies. team members were reported to be asymptomatic and healthy, except one subject with nasal congestion. they lived in groups of 5\u20136 in 3-bedroom to 4-bedroom flats in a single block of 16 flats in a single block of 16 flats. hoarseness and lethargy were recorded on a standardised form in the evening on a four-point severity scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe) the total symptom score for the first 5 days of illness was calculated. a triplex RT-PCR assay for influenza A, A/H1pdm09 and B viruses was performed. a virus cluster was defined as three detections of the same virus during the median length of 3 weeks. the difference between proportions was tested with a binomial standard deviation (SND) test. the team members stayed in PyeongChang for a median length of 21 days. they lived in groups of 5\u20136 in 3-bedroom to 4-bedroom flats in a single block of 16 flats. more than one mucus sample was taken from 28 participants. fever (an axillary temperature 37.8\u00b0C), hoarseness and lethargy were recorded on a standardised form in the evening on a four-point severity scale. the total symptom score for the first 5 days of illness was calculated. enza type 1\u20134 viruses, human coronavirus 229E, OC43 and NL63, human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus were detected using 8 L of each specimen per panel. respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were detected using a triplex RT-PCR assay. only one athlete lost a competition on 1 day due to a respiratory infection. coloured bars represent different viruses and the length of the bar the duration of respiratory symptoms in days. symptomatic N 2 1 4 1 4 1 2 1 1 Severity score median 3.5 26.0 8.0 2.0 5.0 3.0 6.5 5.0 3.0 Duration mean, days (SD) 13.5 (16.3) 7.0 8.7 (3.2) 2.0 4.0 (1.7) 3.0 18.0 (11.3) 7.0 3.0 Ct-value mean (SD) 27.5 (1.2) 39.1 26.9 (3.7) 35.0 30.0 (3.4) 29.2 37.4 (1.6) 20.5 29. all six patients with an influenza virus infection were treated with oseltamivir. none of them developed a symptomatic infection. aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 30 of 42 patients. four athletes competed with mild symptoms of the common cold. one athlete competed 5 days after the onset of an influenza B infection. another competed 5 days after the onset of a respiratory syncytial virus A infection. coronavirus 229E was detected in two subjects on February 13. the following cases were identified consequently 7, 8 (2 cases), 9 (4 cases) and 10 (2 cases) days after the initial detection. three of these infections were asymptomatic. coronavirus NL63 cases were identified 5 and 13 days later. there were 20 athletes (45%) and 22 (32%) staff members. the mean duration of the symptoms was 8.3 (SD 7.8) days and 8.7 (SD 8.9) days. only one athlete lost a competition on 1 day due to a respiratory infection. RSV A, respiratory syncytial virus A; RSV B, respiratory syncytial virus B; Inf A, influenza A virus; MPV, human metapneumovirus; RV, rhinovirus; 229E, human coronavirus 229E; human coronavirus OC43; human coronavirus NL63. the subject left the Games with signs and symptoms of illness. the Ct-value inversely reflects the virus load,27 reflects a high viral load. aetiology of the common cold detected by molecular POCT Onsite. in 8 out of 20 virus-positive cases, a previous or later nasal specimen was virus-negative. no cases of probable bacterial infections were recorded. four athletes competed with mild symptoms of the common cold. no other team member was infected with respiratory syncytial virus B. one subject reported a sore throat and mild lethargy 6 days after departure. metapneumovirus was detected in two samples from asymptomatic individuals 3 days and 4 days after their departure from Finland. one subject later arrived in the village with a symptomatic rhinovirus infection.
