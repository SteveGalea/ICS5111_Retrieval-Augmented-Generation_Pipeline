{"summary": "DNA vaccines were constructed to express Ebola virus GP. mice were injected with GP DNA vaccines and their splenocytes were used for hybridoma production. boosting with GP resulted in greater production of IgG-secreting hybridomas. mortality rates for children under 5 and adults over 55 were found to be 89.1% and 71.4% respectively. despite high mortality rates, there are still neither licensed anti-viral therapeutic drugs nor preventive vaccines against Ebola virus infection. DNA vaccines are thought to be better at inducing Abs that recognize native forms of protein antigens. IM-EP of DNA vaccines will effectively elicit Abs capable of blocking viral infection. purification of DNA vaccines is far easier than purification of proteins. boosting with GP could be useful for producing hybridomas that secrete antigen-specific IgG Abs. these data suggest that boosting with GP could be useful for producing hybridomas that secrete antigen-specific IgG Abs. the plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 cells. the cells were incubated in a shaker until the absorbance at 600 nm was between 0.6 and 0.8 absorbance units. the cells were lysed by stirring for 15\u201360 minutes at room temperature. GP1a, GP1b, GP1c, GP1d, and GP1e were eluted with 10 mL of Buffer C containing 200 mM imidazole. the protein solutions were dialyzed in 6 M urea buffers, followed by 4 M urea buffers, at 2-hour intervals. this was followed by overnight dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). mice were injected intramuscularly with 50 g of pcDNA3-GP per mouse. injections followed by EP at 0.2 V for 4 seconds using a 31-gauge needle. splenocytes were fused with 2107 cells using 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000) nude mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500 L of pristane 2 weeks prior to hybridoma cell injection. ascites fluids were generated by injecting 1106 hybridoma cells into nude mice. in the first method, IgM was purified using a protein L resin column in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. the columns were pre-equilibrated with 10 mL of binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate and 0.8 M (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.5) horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L), HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgM, or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgA diluted in blocking buffer. after washing the plate, an ABTS solution was added to each well. optical density was read at 405 nm using an ELISA reader. membranes were pre-equilibrated with TBST solution (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) for 1 hour at room temperature. in each step, the membrane was washed 3 times with TBST. pcDNA3-GP was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 backbone vector. each DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and XhoI. the plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 cells. cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mL of 8 M urea buffer (pH 8.0) per gram wet weight. the cells were lysed by stirring for 15\u201360 minutes at room temperature. the cells were centrifuged at 25,000 g for 30 minutes. mice were injected intramuscularly with 50 g of pcDNA3-GP per mouse in a final volume of 50 L PBS. the injections were followed by EP at 0.2 V for 4 seconds using a Cellectra system. s (7107 cells) were fused with 2107 Sp2/0-Ag14 cells using 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000) the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 days in cDMEM containing hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HT) after 15 days, the cell supernatants were screened to detect the presence of Ab-secreting hybridomas using ELISA. the protein G resin column was pre-equilibrated with 10 mL of binding buffer. samples were filtered through a 0.2-m filter and mixed with an equal volume of binding buffer. the bound Abs were eluted by adding elution buffer (0.2 M glycine buffer, pH 2.5) the bound Abs were eluted by adding elution buffer (0.2 M glycine buffer, pH 2.5) each well was coated at 4\u00b0C overnight with recombinant GP (0.5 g/mL in PBS) the next day, the plate was washed 3 times with washing buffer (PBS+0.05% Tween 20) and blocked for 1 hour with blocking buffer (washing buffer +2% bovine serum albumin) HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgA were purchased from Komabiotech (Seoul, Korea) the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Merck Millipore) 0.05 were considered to be significant. production of GP DNA vaccines and induction of GP-specific Ab responses. mice were immunized by IM-EP with pcDNA3-GP at 0, 1, and 3 weeks. the optical density (OD) values were measured at 405 nm. the values and bars represent OD values and standard deviation. mice were injected with GP DNA vaccines. 12 clones were selected and designated as A6-9, A13-9, C21-2, C22-2, E53-2, G3-2, G29-5, G44-2, J10-2, M65-16, N47-9, and N52-7. only clone A6-9 failed to react with GP in an ELISA using HRP-conjugated anti-IgG as the secondary Ab. samples from clone A6-9 showed the presence of both IgG H (50 kDa) and L (25 kDa) chains. those from the remaining 11 clones showed only L chains. results suggest that IgM-secreting hybridomas are predominantly generated by immunization with DNA vaccines coding for Ebola virus GP. cell supernatants from the 12 monoclonal clones were reacted with GP, followed by detection with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (A), HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgA and HRP-conjugated IgM (B) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) (C) secondary antibodies. positive control was GP GP1a, GP1b, GP1c, GP1d, and GP1e molecules were generated using the E. coli system. purified GP1a, GP1b, GP1c, GP1d, and GP1e molecules. the molecular mass of GP1e was 7 kDa larger than predicted. we used a protein G resin column to purify IgG from the cell supernatant of clone A6-9. the purified IgG from clone A6-9 displayed both a 50-kDa H and 25-kDa L chain on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. none of the purified IgM Abs recognized either GP1a or GP1e. lowest concentration of IgG from clone A6-9 that displayed GP reactivity was determined as 1.95 ng/mL. signal peptide (SP), the putative receptor-binding domain, mucin-like region, furin cleavage site and trans-membrane region are shown. GP1a, GP1b, GP1c, and GP1d are recombinant proteins spanning GP1 region. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) was used as the secondary antibody. some hybridoma cells (C21-2, C22-2, G44-2, and M65-16) were cultured. purified IgG (2 g/mL) from clone A6-9 was reacted with GP1e, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013conjugated anti-IgG1, HRP-conjugated anti-IgG2a, HRP-conjugated anti-IgG2b and HRP-conjugated anti-IgG3 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. otype measured by ELISA using HRP-anti-IgG (H+L) and HRP-anti-IgM as secondary Abs. cell supernatants from the six hybridomas displayed both 50-kDa H and 25-kDa L chains. control IgG from clone A6-9 displayed both 50-kDa H and 25-kDa L chains. nine hybridomas (V2, V58, V59 V76, V80, V93, V94, V95, and V98) produce IgG types. two hybridomas (V37 and V110) produce an IgM type. hybridoma V76 exhibited neither IgM-specific reactivity to GP or IgM. natants with optical density (OD) values at least 6 higher than those of the negative control in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\u2013conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) cells from the six hybridomas were tested for the presence of IgG and IgM by Western blot assay. GP DNA vaccines induced significantly greater antigen-specific Ab responses than a control pcDNA3 vector. pcDNA3-GP (140 kDa) was used as a coating antigen for ELISA. this result suggests that GP DNA vaccines can elicit antigen-specific Ab responses in vivo. a new tab Production of hybridomas secreting Abs specific for GP. mice were sacrificed and their splenocytes were used for fusion. the five hybridomas were designated as A6, A13, B48, C21, and D3. all 12 clones displayed reactivity to GP in an ELISA using HRP-conjugated anti-IgG (H+L) as the secondary Ab. only clone A6-9 failed to react with GP in an ELISA using HRP-conjugated anti-IgG (Fc-specific) as the secondary Ab. BALB/c mice were injected by intramuscular-electroporation with pcDNA3-GP (50 g/muse) at 0, 1, and 3 weeks. the mice were sacrificed at 1, 2, and 3 weeks following the final injection. the splenocytes were used for fusion. positive control was GP-specific sera (1:10 dilution) negative control was naive sera (1:10 dilution) cell supernatants (20 L) were loaded onto a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel. Western blot assay using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. the molecular mass of GP1e was 7 kDa larger than predicted. the concentrations of GP1a, GP1b, GP1c, GP1d, and GP1e were calculated as 0.78, 0.3, 4.5, 3.1, and 1.6 mg/mL. the purified IgG from clone A6-9 displayed both a 50-kDa H and 25-kDa L chain on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. the 11 purified IgM Abs displayed 70- to 75-kDa H and 25-kDa L chains. none of the purified IgM Abs recognized either GP1a or GP1e. GP1a, GP1b, GP1c, and GP1d are recombinant proteins spanning the putative receptor-binding domains of GP1. GP1e is a recombinant protein spanning the mucin-like region of GP1. the amino acid sequence numbers are also displayed. some hybridoma cells (C21-2, C22-2, G44-2, and M65-16) were injected into nude mice for ascites fluid production. the purified Abs (2 g) were run on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel for Brilliant Blue R250 staining. anti-IgG2a, HRP-conjugated anti-IgG2b and HRP-conjugated anti-IgG3 were tested by Western blot assay using HRP-conjugated anti-IgG (H+L) all of the selected hybridomas secreted an IgM isotype, as measured by ELISA using HRP\u2013anti-IgG (H+L) the six hybridomas produced IgM isotype Abs. control IgG from clone A6-9 displayed both 50-kDa H and 25-kDa L chains. these data corroborate the notion that DNA vaccination leads to preferential production of IgM-secreting hybridomas. hybridoma V76 exhibited both IgM-specific reactivity to GP (by ELISA) and 50-kDa H chains (by Western blot assay), suggesting that the hybridoma V76 might produce Abs other than IgG or IgM. protein boosting following DNA vaccination might reverse the hybridoma production profile from IgM- to IgG-secreting hybridomas. cell supernatants from the six hybridomas were tested for the presence of IgG and IgM by Western blot assay as in Fig. 2D (B). splenocytes harvested 3 days after intravenous injection with GP were harvested 3 days after intravenous injection with GP. the purified monoclonal IgG from one hybridoma clone was an IgG2a type with binding activity to the mucin-like region of GP. in addition, preferential production of IgM-secreting hybridomas was observed when animals were booster-injected in the foot pad with GP DNA vaccines. this result implies that DNA vaccines are able to induce the production of IgG Abs in animals through a switch from IgM to IgG nine of the 12 hybridomas obtained by boosting with GP produced IgG isotype Abs. these cells contained mostly IgG2a and, to a lesser degree, IgG2b isotypes. this suggests that antigen-specific Ab responses, primed by DNA vaccination, may be boosted by protein immunization. this notion is supported by the fact that protein priming-protein boosting had no effect on IgG2a isotype induction, whereas DNA purified monoclonal IgG Abs resolved into two protein bands (50-kDa H chains and 25-kDa L chains) both the H and L chains of IgG, but only the L chain of IgM were recognized by HRP-conjugated anti-IgG (H+L), but only IgM was recognized by HRP-conjugated anti-IgG (H+L) protein boosting approach may have implications for the production of IgG-specific hybridomas in the DNA vaccination platform."}
