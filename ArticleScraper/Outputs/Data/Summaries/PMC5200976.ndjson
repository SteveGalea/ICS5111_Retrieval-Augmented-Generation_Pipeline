{"summary": "researchers used PubMed and Scopus to search international medical databases. they evaluated effectiveness and compliance of the vaccines applied in Hajj. almost all pilgrims were vaccinated against meningococcal diseases. the responsible infectious pathogens are reported as follows: Respiratory pathogens Rhinoviruses,[3,4,5] coronaviruses,[6] adenoviruses, both seasonal and pandemic influenza[7] including, influenza A (H3N2) and B,[3] influenza H1N1, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, herpes simplex virus,[5,8,9] meningococcal diseases[10] the study evaluated effectiveness and compliance of the vaccines applied in the Hajj published through the recent years. adenoviruses, both seasonal and pandemic influenza[7] including influenza A (H3N2) and B,[3] influenza H1N1, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, herpes simplex virus,[5,8,9] meningococcal diseases[10] and meningococcal carrier state. METHODS We used PubMed and Scopus to search international medical databases. the keywords were: Hajj, Haj, vaccine, vaccination, and immunization. the time interval of the search was from the beginning of 2010 to May 23, 2016. the average score was 0.95 (standard deviation [SD] = 0.9) in the intervention group and 0.88 (SD = 0.69) in the control group. twenty-four patients (75%) in the case group and 48 participants (76.2%) in the control group were vaccinated. meningococcal vaccine Effectiveness Memish et al. conducted another study to analyze invasive meningococcal disease surveillance data in KSA from 1995 to 2011. they compared the related data before and after the new policy about using polysaccharide quadrivalent ACWY vaccine for pilgrims. the results showed that the mean annual IMD rate decreased from 0.20 (SD) = 0.1\u20130.06 (SD = 0.06) cases/100,000 (P = 0.02) only 4.2% of pilgrims were vaccinated against pneumococcal diseases. Influenza vaccine Effectiveness Hasan et al. compared influenza vaccine effectiveness between two groups of vaccinated and nonvaccinated hajj pilgrims. 356 pilgrims have shown that vaccination rate against influenza before traveling was 80%. 80% of pilgrims reported that they had vaccinated against pandemic influenza A before traveling to the KSA. study carried out on 356 pilgrims found that vaccination rate against influenza before traveling was 80%. memish et al. also investigated the H1N1 vaccine compliance among 519 arriving and 2699 departing pilgrims. 796 out of 861 pilgrims were collected. 98.2% of the pilgrims were vaccinated by the meningococcal quadrivalent in the last 3 years. Memish et al. evaluated nasopharyngeal samples of 5235 pilgrims from different countries. only 4.2% of pilgrims were vaccinated against pneumococcal diseases. study carried out on 33,213 pilgrims showed some cases of H1N1 pdm09 among the pilgrims after returning to their original country. most of the cases had history of vaccination against seasonal influenza. the effectiveness of the meningococcal vaccine is satisfactory now. tetanus toxoid in 400 healthy adult travelers without the history of tetanus and meningococcal appropriate vaccination. the vaccine response rate was 76%. there are studies that show that the use of pneumococcal vaccine is efficient. the total vaccination rates for tetanus, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis (TdP) were 18.9%, 14.7%, and 15.0% respectively, which is not an appropriate status. on the basis of alqahtani et al. study, the rate of diphtheria vaccine uptake was low. in a prospective study, Pavli et al. assessed pretravel vaccination in a total of 2494 travelers in Greece. in this study, 615 (24.7%), 28 (1.1%), 12 (0.5%), 1629 (65.3%), and 666 (26.7%) travelers were vaccinated for typhoid fever, cholera, rabies, yellow fever, and meningococcal infections. al-Tawfiq et al. strongly recommended vaccination against yellow fever and poliomyelitis for pilgrims of high-risk countries. the total vaccination rates for tetanus, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis were 18.9%, 14.7%, and 15.0% respectively, which is not an appropriate status. et al., in one cross-sectional study conducted on 580 pilgrims, evaluated social determinants of the Tdp vaccination coverage. they concluded that pilgrims with lower socioeconomic status had a low level vaccination against TdP. pauli et al. assessed pretravel vaccination in a total of 2494 travelers in Greece. 615 (24.7%), 28 (1.1%), 12 (0.5%), 1629 (65.3%) and 666 (26.7%) travelers were vaccinated for typhoid fever, cholera, rabies, yellow fever, and meningococcal infections. al-Tawfiq et al. strongly recommended vaccination against yellow fever and poliomyelitis. meningococcal immunization is an effective preventive tool with high compliance among pilgrims."}
