{"summary": "primary pericardial synovial sarcoma is an extremely rare disorder. it may be confused with other pericardial diseases that show a pericardial mass with effusion on echocardiography and chest CT. subsequent diagnostic imaging, including echocardiography or chest CT, reveals a pericardial mass requiring biopsy. polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed for respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, influenza A/B virus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus A/B, metapneumovirus, and coronavirus. the patient was discharged without symptoms after 5 days antiviral therapy with a regular follow-up schedule, but he was not regularly followed up. echocardiography showed an initial mild amount of pericardial effusion axial (A) and coronal (B) contrast-enhanced CT images show localized pericardial effusion with septation and the thickened pericardium. echocardiography showed a 7.75.5 cm2 pericardial mass adjacent to the right atrium, with a small amount of pericardial effusion. primary pericardial tumor is an extremely rare disorder (1-3) pericardial cysts and pericardial lipomas are the most common benign pericardial tumors. mesothelioma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the pericardium. pericardial synovial sarcoma has a large range of histologic subtypes. pericardial effusion with a pericardial mass of variable size, and therapeutic or diagnostic pericardiocentesis yields a large quantity of bloody pericardial effusion. pericardial fluid analysis usually fails to reveal malignant cells (1-3) as in our case, generalized symptoms, including fever, cough, chest pain, and fatigue, may occur without any pericardial mass being seen on imaging studies. pericardial synovial sarcoma may present clinically with various symptoms related to pericardial effusion, including chest pain, dyspnea, and cardiac tamponade. the quantity of pericardial effusion is variable and most cases show a pericardial mass, while fewer have no visible mass (2). a large amount of non-hemorrhagic pericardial effusion could be diagnosed as idiopathic (10,11) however, as in our patient, non-hemorrhagic recurrent pericardial effusion may occur in an early case of malignant pericardial synovial sarcoma."}
