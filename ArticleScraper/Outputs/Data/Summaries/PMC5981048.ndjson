{"summary": "bovine coronavirus is an enveloped virus with an approximately 31-kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. infection of cattle with bovine coronavirus is a major contributor to diarrhea in calves. only 17 full-genome sequences of unique BCoV isolates are publicly available in GenBank (3). the four isolates were closely related to one another and shared 99% nucleotide identity with their closest relative, sable antelope coronavirus US/OH1/2003. other closely related sequences were those of isolates from diverse cattle and captive ruminants obtained in Ohio, a neighboring state. complete genome sequences of the BCoV isolates 4-17-03, 4-17-25, 4-17-08, and 7-16-23 have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MH043952 to MH043955. Accession number(s)."}
