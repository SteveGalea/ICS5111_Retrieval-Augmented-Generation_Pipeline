{"summary": "nucleoside analogs have been historically used for anti-cancer chemotherapy because they inhibit cellular DNA/RNA polymerases. some nucleoside analog drugs targeting specific viral polymerases have been successful in clinical trials [2,3,4,5] and are currently in use for the treatment of virus-infected patients. nucleoside analogs block natural flow of nucleos(t)ide synthesis pathways. a nucleotide-defective condition decreases the efficiency of viral replication. this phenomenon is usually mediated by the inhibition of nucleotide synthesis, suggesting a potential crosstalk between nucleotide biosynthesis and innate immunity. gemcitabine is one of drugs with antiviral activity against the above mentioned viruses. the antiviral activity of gemcitabine has also been reported against a broad range of RNA viruses. gemcitabine was shown to effectively suppress ZIKV infection and replication in human retinal pigment epithelium cells. gemcitabine synergistically reduced HIV infectivity by increasing the viral mutation frequency. a significant antiviral effect of gemcitabine on IAVs was also reported for RPE cells by Denisova et al. gemcitabine significantly lowered the pulmonary viral load and inflammation by decreasing proinflammatory cytokines. the best anti-PV inhibitor from a screen of FDA-approved drugs in PV replicon-harboring HeLa cells (EC50 of 0.3 M) gemcitabine is an effective broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA viruses. it is possible that gemcitabine is effective for other untested RNA viruses. most of the above mentioned viruses have limited prophylactic or therapeutic drugs. gemcitabine was the most strongly affected by gemcitabine, with a low nanomolar EC50, which was lower than that used in cancer therapy. gemcitabine synergistically suppressed HIV infectivity both in vitro and in vivo [17,21] gemcitabine had an anti-EV effect by targeting the salvage pathway of pyrimidine biosynthesis [23] gemcitabine strongly induced the expression of several ISGs. this was consistent with a previous report that gemcitabine stimulated the production of IFN- and IFN- in IAV-infected RPE cells. ribavirin and mycophenolic acid are inhibitors of inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is a key enzyme of the purine biosynthesis pathway. both have antiviral activities against viruses such as HCV, hepatitis E virus (HEV), MERS-CoV, dengue virus, yellow fever, hepatitis B virus, west Nile virus (WNV), Chikungunya ribavirin-induced ISG activation and antiviral activity were suppressed using supplemented guanosine. MPA remarkably induced the expression of several ISGs, including IRF1, IRF9, ISG15, IFI6, IRF7, CXCL10, IFIT2 and IFITM3 mRNAs in nave or HEV-infected cells. factor 1 (IRF1) transcription factor, a master regulator of antiviral gene expression [37], was consistent with the observation that the anti-HCV activity of MPA was partially mediated by IRF1 [30] brequinar is also an antiviral compound, which inhibits the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. despite limited data, we speculate the scenario of ISG activation that is independent of JAK/STAT-mediated IFN signal. purine/pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors could interfere with the metabolic pathway through targeting key enzymes such as IMPDH and DHODH. this signal is less likely to be dependent on STAT1/2-IRF9. nucleoside analogs that directly target viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase have been considered advantageous. new antiviral mode of nucleoside analogs acting through innate immunity strengthens the molecular basis for their therapeutic application as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. nucleoside analogs interfering with the host nucleotide synthesis pathway suggest possible side effects in their clinical applications. careful evaluation of clinical safety is required and their application for the urgent measure of patients infected with deadly viruses would be worth being considered."}
