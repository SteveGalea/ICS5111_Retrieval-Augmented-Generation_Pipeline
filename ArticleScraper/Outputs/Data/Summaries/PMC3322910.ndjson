{"summary": "median incubation period for SARS appears to be approximately 4\u20136 days. most patients become ill within 2 to 10 days after exposure (8,12,17,18) most common initial symptom is fever, often accompanied by headache, myalgia, malaise, chills, and rigor (1,11,17\u201322) rales or rhonchi have been detectable in most patients in some series. some researchers have observed a lack of lung sounds despite marked infiltration on chest radiography. most patients have total leukocyte counts that are normal or slightly low. radiographic changes consistent with pneumonia were detected in 67% to 80% of SARS patients by day 3 of illness, 97%-100% by day 7 and 100% by day 10 (33,34). a lesion typically begins as an isolated focal lesion found in a peripheral location, often in the lower lobes. ukocyte cell count Lymphopenia Mildly depressed platelet count Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels Elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels Elevated creatine phosphokinase levels Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time Radiographic Abnormal chest x-ray in almost all patients by the second week of illness. most patients become ill within 2 to 10 days after exposure (8,12,17,18) asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV appears to be uncommon (25,26) elderly patients and those with chronic illnesses may not have typical symptoms of SARS (12,13,27) Chest radiographs may be normal in up to 30% of patients with the clinical diagnosis of SARS at the time when first evaluated (18,22,32\u201334) radiographic changes consistent with pneumonia were detected in 67% to 80% of SARS patients by day 3 of illness, 97%-100% by day 7 and in 100% by day 10. RT-PCR and real-time PCR are insufficiently sensitive to reliably diagnose all persons with SARS when first evaluated. PCR tests can provide false-positive test results even in most experienced laboratories. indiscriminant use for persons at low risk for SARS infection could result in a false diagnosis of SARS. more research is needed to determine the optimal timing of sample collection, the duration of shedding, and the optimal type of sample. epidemiologic features that may be helpful in early recognition of SARS include a history of exposure to known SARS cases or SARS-affected areas. atypical pneumonia among healthcare workers should raise the suspicion for SARS. if there are multiple cases among healthcare workers in the same facility, atypical pneumonia in a person who works in a laboratory that contains live SARS-CoV should raise the possibility. in the Toronto and Singapore outbreaks, >94% of cases had documented contact with a SARS patient or with a hospital ward where there was a known SARS patient (8,38). determining if persons with symptoms compatible with SARS have an epidemiologic linkage either to other persons with known or suspected SARS or to places with known or suspected transmission of SARS-CoV is important. atypical pneumonia among healthcare workers should raise suspicion for SARS. atypical pneumonia in a person who works in a laboratory contains live SARS-CoV should raise the possibility of SARS. the goal of diagnostic strategies should be to detect patients with SARS as early in the illness as possible to prevent potential transmission. patients with severe pneumonia of unknown cause Recent travel to previously SARS-affected area or close contact with ill persons with a history of travel to such areas. the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) should be considered for any patient. if used as a screening tool, clinicians may have to adopt a different approach to detecting SARS among patients with pneumonia. the positive predictive value of even early clinical symptoms, while still low, is more acceptable if used in combination with an epidemiologic link to settings in which SARS has been documented. a provisional diagnosis of SARS is made on the basis of clinical and epidemiologic factors discussed. the patient should be managed according to existing guidance for SARS isolation precautions while evaluation and treatment proceed. the patient should be isolated for the duration of the period of communicability or until convincing evidence against SARS is documented. patients with documented pneumonia should be treated as if they have SARS-CoV infection, unless there is convincing evidence for an alternative diagnosis or new epidemiologic information excludes the possibility that the patient was exposed to SARS-CoV infection. the possibility of secondary infection should be considered if the diagnosis is confirmed, since bacterial pneumonia is a well-known complication of viral respiratory tract infection. diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection is to obtain a negative result on serologic testing of a convalescent-phase serum sample obtained >28 days after onset of symptoms. patients without evidence of pneumonia at the initial evaluation may be helpful in identifying those in whom isolation precautions can be safely discontinued. clinical features must be interpreted in context of key epidemiologic risk factors. epidemiologic linkage to other persons with pneumonia, exposure to settings in which SARS activity is suspected or documented, and pneumonia among healthcare workers."}
