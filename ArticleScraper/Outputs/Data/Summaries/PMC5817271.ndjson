{"summary": "TBEV is a medically important tick-borne flavivirus and is the causative agent of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) the Czech Republic has the second highest incidence of TBE in Europe after Russia [2] IFNs activate the expression of hundreds of genes, known as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which elicite the antiviral state [10\u201312]. in most cell types, type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-), which signal through the IFNAR1/IFNAR2 receptors, are the primary IFNs produced. to date, only the type I IFN system has been shown to be essential for control of TBEV and related Langat virus (LGTV) systemic infection of the murine CNS [21, 22]. Moreover, type I IFN responses have been shown to protect murine astrocytes from tick-borne flavivirus infection. m.o.i. 0.1, 1 or 5 at 24 h p.i. were 1.5 % (sd 0.44), 5.0 % (sd 0.93) and 19.6 % (sd 2.25), respectively. m.o.i. refers to the TBEV titre in PS cells. cells were seeded on a chamber slide and incubated 24 h. cells were stained with antibodies for TUBB3, MOG, VIM and GFAP. the average with standard deviation from two independent experiments is shown. the expression rates of TUBB3, MOG and VIM were not significantly changed upon TBEV infection. no signal was detected for GFAP, which correlates with the data described in Fig. 1. cells were pre-treated with human recombinant IFN- (10, 100, and 1000 ng ml1) and infected with TBEV 12 h later at an m.o.i. of 5. cells were incubated for 5 days until a virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. MTT viability assays were performed at 5 d p.i., when CPE was observed in infected cells without IFN pre-treatment. the numbers represent the percentage of living cells normalized to the untreated control. data were normalized to cells co-transfected with p125Luc and pRL-CMV without poly I:C treatment. significant differences from the control were calculated by Student\u2019s t-test (**P0.01) 155 or 778 genes were found to be differentially expressed in mock- or TBEV-infected cells pre-treated with IFN-. only 12.3 and 29.2 % of the differentially expressed genes identified in mock- and TBEV-infected cells that had been pre-treated with IFN- were also identified in TBEV-infected cells. the mean of three biological replicates with standard deviation is shown. differentially expressed genes with a greater than 1.5-fold change as a cut-off condition are shown. TBEV infection of mouse brain and human astrocytes resulted in inflammatory responses. AOY cells activated a similar panel of cytokine-coding genes upon TBEV infection (CCL3/MIP1, CCL4/MIP1, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10/IP-10, IL-6 and TNF-) dozens of ISGs have been identified as being induced following viral infection (reviewed in [10\u201312]). RN7SL2, RN7SL3 and RNA28S5 are the only RNA genes with known functions. the remaining differentially expressed RNAs were long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with unknown functions. the observed pattern of general activation of host responses upon TBEV infection was confirmed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. list of top 10 predicted canonical pathways affected by TBEV infection or IFN- pre-treatment according to IPA software analysis. FN-, IFN- and IFN- were also included.

DAOY cells were treated with IFN- (10 ng ml1) and infected with TBEV after 12 h. DAOY and A549 cells were first treated with human recombinant IFN-1 at concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 ng ml1. then after 12 h infected with TBEV (m.o.i. 5) the -ct method, using HPRT as a housekeeping gene, was used for relative fold-change calculation. the mean of three biological replicates with standard deviation is shown. the dotted line indicates the sensitivity of the assay. a panel of genes down-regulated following IFN- treatment consisted mostly of cytokine coding genes. the same rate of down-regulation for CCL3/MIP1, CSF3, CCL20/MIP3, IL36RN, CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP2, CXCL3/MIP2, CXCL5/ENA78, IL1, IL1, IL6, IL8 and IL11 was observed in both mock- and TBEV-inf we studied the antiviral host response against TBEV strain Neudoerfl. these cells are derived from the cerebellum [26], one of the brain areas affected most during TBE infection [6], and were shown to be susceptible to TBEV strain Hypr [25] in order to determine the infection rate of TBEV Neudoerfl. the average with standard deviation from two independent experiments (in triplicate per experiment) is shown. cells were stained with antibodies for TUBB3, MOG, VIM and GFAP. the expression rates of TUBB3, MOG and VIM were not significantly changed upon TBEV infection in comparison to control cells. no signal was detected for GFAP, which correlates with the data described in Fig. 1. DAOY and A549 cells were treated with human recombinant IFN- (10, 100, and 1000 ng ml1) and infected with TBEV 12 h later at an m.o.i. of 5. cells were incubated for 5 days until a virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in the control wells. MTT viability assays were performed at 5 d p.i., when CPE was observed in infected cells without IFN pre-treatment. the numbers represent the percentage of living cells normalized to the untreated control. data were normalized to cells co-transfected with p125Luc and pRL-CMV without poly I:C treatment. significant differences from the control were calculated by Student\u2019s t-test (**P0.01). 155 or 778 genes were found to be differentially expressed in mock- or TBEV-infected cells pre-treated with IFN-. only 12.3 and 29.2 % of the differentially expressed genes identified in mock- and TBEV-infected cells that had been pre-treated with IFN- were also identified in TBEV-infected cells. the mean of three biological replicates with standard deviation is shown. differentially expressed genes with a greater than 1.5-fold change as a cut-off condition are shown. the mean of three biological replicates with standard deviation is shown. TBEV-infected DAOY cells activated a similar panel of cytokine-coding genes upon TBEV infection (CCL3/MIP1, CCL4/MIP1, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10/IP-10, IL-6 and TNF-) five new cytokine-coding genes were identified as being significantly up-regulated, together with the IL-18 receptor accessory protein (IL18RAP) RN7SL2, RN7SL3 and RNA28S5 are the only RNA genes with known functions. the remaining differentially expressed RNAs were long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with unknown functions. the observed pattern of general activation of host responses upon TBEV infection was also confirmed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. list of top 10 predicted canonical pathways affected by TBEV infection. untreated mock cells versus TBEV-infected cells Canonical pathway P-value Pathway-associated genes found to be differentially expressed Unfolded protein response.

DAOY and A549 cells were treated with human recombinant IFN-1 at concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 ng ml1 and then after 12 h infected with TBEV. number represents the percentage of living cells normalized to the untreated control. the -ct method, using HPRT as a housekeeping gene, was used for relative fold-change calculation. significant difference from control was calculated by Student\u2019s t-test (****P0.0001). a panel of genes down-regulated following IFN- treatment consisted mainly of cytokine coding genes. the same rate of down-regulation for CCL3/MIP1, CSF3, CCL20/MIP3, IL36RN, CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP2, CXCL3/MIP2, CXCL5/ENA78, IL1, IL1, IL6, IL8 and IL11 was observed in both mock- and TBEV-in ulloblastoma cells are derived from cerebellum and their neuronal origin was analysed using TUBB3, MOG, VIM and GFAP biomarkers. TUBB3 and VIM expression is typical for neural precursor cells; TUBB3 expression was documented in neuronal precursor cells [44], whereas vimentin is typical for radial glia, a primary progenitor cells capable of both neuro- and gliogenesis [27]. up-regulation of cytokines/chemokines would mostly result in activation/stimulation and chemotaxis of effector immune cells. this correlates with TBEV-associated immunopathogenesis in the brain. we did not observe up-regulation of IFN-, which is intriguing. high TBEV titres were observed in infected HEK293T cells. TBEV antagonizes type I IFN signalling in infected cells. NS5 protein inhibits JAK-STAT signalling. 5, NOTCH3, COL1A1, BCL9L, BCOR1, POLR2A, FAM71D, IGF2 and HSPG2 down-regulation were also evident in IFN--pre-treated cells infected with TBEV. the down-regulation observed for these genes could be considered to be a hallmark of TBEV infection in DAOY cells. no change in RN7SL3 expression was observed in TBEV-infected cells. down-regulation of RN7SL3 took place in TBEV-infected cells. biological relevance of these data needs to be investigated. TBEV does not inhibit the type III IFN pathway, because it does not affect virus replication. two genes were up-regulated in IFN-treated DAOY cells. they belong to the FAM14 family of ISGs. our results provide novel insights into the response of neuronal cells to TBEV infection and the antiviral effects of type I and III IFN. a partial overlap of host-induced genes for TBEV and type I IFN. the DAOY medulloblastoma cell line was derived from desmoplastic cerebellar medulloblastoma [26], and the U373 MG Uppsala glioblastoma cell line was derived from malignant glioma/astrocytoma [29]. all cell lines were grown at 37 \u00b0C and 5 % CO2 (PS cells at 37 \u00b0C without additional CO2) cells were seeded in 96-well plates 12 h prior pre-treatment with recombinant IFN- and IFN- using concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 ng ml1. cells were infected at 12 h post-treatment with TBEV strain Neudoerfl at an m.o.i. of 5 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5 % CO2 for 5 days. in vitro activity of the IFN- promoter was analysed in DAOY and A549 cells using p125Luc reporter vector expressing Firefly luciferase under the control of IFN- promoter [35] and pRL-CMV vector expressing Renilla luciferase as an internal control. cells were seeded in 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. RNA pelleted by centrifugation (12 000 g/15 min/4 \u00b0C) washed with 75 % ethanol. RNA was stored at 80 \u00b0C until further use. RNA integrity was checked before sequencing using a 2200 TapeStation. we aligned the short reads to the Homo sapiens genome downloaded via the Ensembl genome browser. Cuffdiff is a program in the Cufflinks package (version 2.2.1) it can identify differentially expressed (DE) transcripts and genes, differential splicing and promoter preference changes. Western blotting Cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice for 15 min. lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min at 14 000 g. proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) cells were infected with TBEV at an m.o.i. of 0.1, 1 or 5 and fixed at 24 h p.i. fixed by using 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min. cells were also treated with 50 mM NH4Cl in 1 % BSA in PBS to block formaldehyde autofluorescence. the total number of NS3 or CNS marker expressing cells were counted and transformed to percentages relating to the total number of cells. cells, viruses and IFN pre-treatment human medulloblastoma (ATCC; DAOY HTB-186) and human lung adenocarcinoma (A549; available at the Institute of Parasitology, Biology Centre of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Braniovsk\u00e1) lines were grown in low cells were grown in L15 medium with 3 % newborn calf serum (NCS), 1 % antibiotic/antimycotic and 1 % l-glutamine. all cell lines were grown at 37 \u00b0C and 5 % CO2 (PS cells at 37 \u00b0C without additional CO2) cells were seeded in 96-well plates 12 h prior pre-treatment with recombinant IFN- and IFN-. cells were infected at 12 h post-treatment with TBEV strain Neudoerfl. cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 5 % CO2 for 5 days until virus-induced the CPE was observed in control wells. cells (1.2105 well1 and 1.6105 well1 for DAOY and A549 cells) were seeded in 24-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. first co-transfection of p125Luc (500 ng) and pRL-CMV (2 ng) followed by a second transfection of poly I:C (1 or 10 g well1) after 24 h. five-hundred ng of total RNA from each sample was enriched for poly(A) RNA, then fragmented and prepared for sequencing using a TruSeq stranded mRNA preparation kit (Illumina) on average, 48 million reads were acquired for each sample. it uses a model for fragment counts based on a beta negative binomial distribution. it can identify differentially expressed (DE) transcripts and genes, differential splicing and promoter preference changes, and returns far more statistically significant differentially expressed genes than microarray analysis. Lysate was centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min at 14 000 g to eliminate cellular debris. proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane. chicken polyclonal primary antibodies were used at 1 : 500 dilution ratio. cells were incubated with chicken polyclonal anti-NS3, goat polyclonal anti-MOG (Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-TUBB3 (Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-VIM (Abcam), or rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (Dako) antibodies at 1 : 5000, 1 : 200, 1 : 200, 1 : 1000 and 1 : 500 dilutions."}
