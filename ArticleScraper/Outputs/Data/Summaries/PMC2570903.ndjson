{"summary": "participants and Methods a cross-sectional survey was conducted from October 2005 through February 2006 among the countries participating in ESSTI and in Switzerland. the ESSTI consisted of 22 member states of the europe plus Iceland, Norway, and Turkey. the questionnaire was sent to each country\u2019s representative (surveillance leads and reference microbiologists) in industrialized countries, cases are incidentally imported from tropical and subtropical areas where the disease is endemic (6). public health measures are usually restricted to contact tracing and adequate management of sex partners in individual cases. all countries (n = 18) Countries with cases (n = 11) Initial alert and response Alert and response issued 11 9 Enhanced surveillance 8 7 Voluntary reporting 9 7 Provisional guidelines 9 7 Information dissemination 11 9 Educational activities 6 6 Development of control measures Outbreak management team (advisory team) 5 5 Initial risk assessment performed 8 7 Methods to collect evidence Hand search literature 11 9 Search electronic databases 10 7 Search patient entry data 7 6 Search unpublished data 4 4 Methods to analyze evidence. data were missing for 3 countries for this category. initial alert and response systems were set up by 11 of the 18 responding countries. the main objectives of the alert were active case finding. a total of 11 countries developed national, multidisciplinary guidelines for LGV control. a total of 4 countries developed national, multidisciplinary guidelines for LGV control, 2 of which issued authorization procedures. tetracycline (2 g/day), minocycline (300 mg loading dose followed by 200 mg 2/day) and erythromycin (500 mg 4/day) control measures were implemented by disseminating educational materials in 9 countries. most countries (11/18) had the risk group help disseminate information. a risk assessment was performed by 8 countries. criteria varied with the 18 countries. a total of 4 countries developed national, multidisciplinary guidelines. for 9 countries doxycycline (100 mg 2/day for 21 days) was the first choice of treatment. alternatives were tetracycline (2 g/day), minocycline (300 mg loading dose followed by 200 mg 2/day) and erythromycin (500 mg 4/day) the reemergence of LGV has affected MSM in 11 european countries. the ESSTI alert prompted these countries to take action to identify cases early, improve the management of cases and assess the size of the outbreak. only 1 of these new member countries completed the questionnaire. it was impossible to assess how outbreak control measures were developed and implemented. the findings are helpful for understanding the responses to unexpected disease outbreaks. the challenge for the future will be to coordinate outbreak management in various countries for which continuity and coherence are essential. quality systems following the whole chain of outbreak management (alert, outbreak control measures, implementation, and evaluation) are needed."}
