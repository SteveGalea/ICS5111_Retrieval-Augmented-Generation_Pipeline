{"summary": "several members of the OW and NW-B viruses are known to cause diseases in humans. no vaccine is available for arenavirus pathogens except for Junn virus (JUNV) vaccine Candid#1. ARD domains and C-terminal (repression) domains are kept close to the centrally located helicase domain. specific Thr and Ser residues in the CTD and CARDs are phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) and protein kinase C-/ (PKC-/), respectively (10\u201313) a series of protein modifications (ubiquitylation and dephosphorylation) of RIG-I helps mediate its conformation interaction between RIG-I and PACT can be detected endogenously in cells (upon Sendai virus [SeV] infection) the enforced expression of PACT alone has no effect on IFN- promoter activity. but when coexpressed with RIG-I with a functional helicase activity, PACT can significantly augment RIG-I activation. NP effectively blocked the PACT-induced augmentation of RIG-I function. RESULTS Arenaviral nucleoproteins block PACT-augmented IFN- production. previous studies have shown that PACT can strongly augment the RIG-I-induced activation of the IFN- promoter. HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids. LASV NP inhibits both RIG-I- and RIG-I-plus-PACT-induced IFN- promoter activity. the experiments that generated data for each of the panels were repeated three times. all arenaviral NPs were able to suppress PACT\u2013RIG-I-induced IFN- promoter activation to similar levels. the RNase function of NPs is required for inhibition of type I IFN production. NP-mediated inhibition of PACT/RIG-I is not mediated by an abolishment of the interaction between PACT and RIG-I. several viral proteins, such as the EBOV VP35, HSV Us11, and IAV NS1 proteins, can suppress PACT\u2013RIG-I-induced IFN- promoter activity. the immunoprecipitates also contained similar levels of WT and mutant NPs when the respective NP plasmids were cotransfected. however, there appeared to be no major differences between WT NP and mutant NP in disrupting the RIG-I\u2013PACT interactions. HEK293T cells were infected with WT PICV for 24 h. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-IgG or anti-HA antibody. they were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with antibodies against NP or PACT. the PICV D389A mutant grew to a level similar to that of WT PICV in RIG-I KO MEF cells. it also grew relatively better in PACT KO MEF cells but to a level that was lower than that in RIG-I KO MEF cells. the viral NP RNase function potently antagonizes these host restriction factors in order to optimize virus replication. NP (NP mut), inhibits mouse RIG-I (mRIG-I)/PACT-induced IFN- promoter activity. the experiments that generated data for this panel were repeated three times. mouse RIG-I and human RIG-I proteins are functionally interchangeable. these data are consistent with the viral growth kinetics in RIG-I and PACT KO MEF cells. different viral growth kinetics seen in cell cultures would correspond to different levels of immune gene expression. these mRNA levels were significantly induced in the PACT KO MEF cells when they were infected with the same NP RNase-defective PICV. these data once again imply that RIG-I acts as a major sensor of arenaviruses, while PACT plays an enhancing role in the host innate immune response to arenavirus infection. HEK293T cells were transfected with either an empty vector or a plasmid expressing the wild-type (WT) LASV NP gene together with the IFN-\u2013LUC reporter plasmid, the -galactosidase (-Gal)-expressing plasmid. the results showed that RIG-I alone activated IFN- promoter activity by 60-fold and, together with PACT, strongly activated IFN- promoter activity ids together with the IFN- promoter-directed luciferase (LUC) plasmid and -Gal plasmid. LASV NP inhibits both RIG-I- and RIG-I-plus-PACT-induced IFN- promoter activity. the results showed that all arenaviral NPs. RNase-containing LASV NP and its C-terminal domain suppressed IFN- promoter activation. but the NP D389A mutant and the N-terminal non-RNase-containing domain of NP did not exhibit such an inhibitory effect. several viral proteins, such as EBOV VP35, HSV Us11, and IAV NS1 proteins, can suppress PACT\u2013RIG-I-induced IFN activities by disrupting protein-protein interactions between RIG-I and PACT. we asked whether arenaviral NPs could also suppress PACT\u2013RIG-I-induced IFN- promoter activity through a similar mechanism. the presence of WT or mutant NP reduced but did not eliminate the FLAG\u2013RIG-I protein levels in the immunoprecipitates. however, there appeared to be no major differences between WT NP and mutant NP in disrupting the RIG-I\u2013PACT interactions. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-IgG or anti-HA antibody. HEK293 cells were infected with WT PICV for 24 h. recombinant PICV could replicate in both RIG-I KO and PACT KO cells. both RIG-I and PACT restrict PICV replication. the viral NP RNase function potently antagonizes these host restriction factors in order to optimize virus replication. the experiments that generated data for each of the panels were repeated three times. activity levels of mRIG-I, PACT, NP, and the GAPDH gene for each transfection were detected by Western blotting with the respective antibodies. the study was conducted in human cells with human RIG-I and human PACT proteins. WT and NP RNase-defective PICV infections induce differential IFN- production in WT, RIG-I KO, and PACT KO MEF cells. the expression levels of the IFN-, NF-B, and ISG56 genes were quantified by either an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IFN- expression levels from different types of MEF cells stimulated by either WT PICV or RNase-defective PICV (NP mut) infection. the levels of IFN- and NF-B mRNA transcripts were measured at 16 h postinfection. the levels of ISG56 mRNA transcripts were measured at 4 h postinfection. RIG-I is a major cytosolic sensor of RNA viruses that activates early antiviral responses, including the expression of type I IFNs. recent studies have identified PACT as a positive regulator of RIG-I signaling (24) the identity of these RNA ligands is unknown but can originate from both endogenous cellular RNAs (e.g., in the absence of viral infection or PAMP RNA transfection) the identity of these RNA ligands is unknown but can originate from both endogenous cellular RNAs (e.g., in the absence of viral infection or PAMP RNA transfection) RNA ligands (self and/or PAMP RNA) are essential for PACT\u2013RIG-I activation. NP mainly affects IFN production by degrading the RNA ligands to suppress the PACT\u2013RIG-I pathway. arenavirus uses its NP protein to effectively evade PACT- and RIG-I-mediated inhibition via its RNase activity. this NP RNase-defective mutant virus grows to a much higher level in RIG-I KO than in PACT KO cells. this new knowledge can be exploited for the development of novel antiviral treatments and/or vaccine development against some arenaviruses. a single-alanine substitution of a conserved RNase catalytic residue (D389A) of LASV NP was generated. human kidney epithelial cells (HEK293T and HEK293 cells) and baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 and BSRT7-5 cells) were grown in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) and 50 HEK293T cells were grown overnight to 60% to 80% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. cells were transfected with 10 g of each of the plasmids expressing RIG-I and PACT along with 10 g of WT LASV NP or 10 g of NP RNase catalytic mutants. HEK293 cells were seeded into a 10-cm dish at 60% to 80% confluence for PICV infection. at 24 h postinfection, a similar co-IP assay was carried out with 1 g of anti-PACT antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) the levels of IFN- in the supernatants of the virus-infected cells were quantified by using a mouse IFN- ELISA kit (Legend Max mouse IFN- ELISA kit with precoated plates) total cellular RNAs were extracted by using the Tri reagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. fected cells were normalized to that of the GAPDH gene. results shown are the averages of data from one experiment done in triplicates. experiments were repeated 4 times. HEK293T cells were grown overnight to 60% to 80% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture dishes in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 50 g/ml penicillin-streptomycin. the methods for generating recombinant PICV mutants were described previously (37). HEK293 cells were seeded into a 10-cm dish at 60% to 80% confluence for PICV infection. cells were transfected with either an empty vector or the NP expression vector together with 100 ng of the IFN-\u2013LUC reporter plasmid. 100 ng of a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged human RIG-I (FLAG\u2013hRIG-I) or myc-tagged mouse RIG-I (myc\u2013mRIG-I) was included in the transfection reaction mixture. fluc activities were normalized to the -Gal values. quantitative PCR was conducted with specific primers designed to detect mouse IFN-, NF-B, ISG56, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene. the primer sequences are listed in Table 1."}
