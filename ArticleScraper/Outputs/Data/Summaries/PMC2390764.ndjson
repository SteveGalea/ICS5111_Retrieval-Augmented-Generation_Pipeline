{"summary": "virion proteins are commonly termed \u201cstructural proteins\u201d and broadly-speaking, include proteins that either form an integral part of the virus architecture or are required for the first round of genome replication. advances have extended proteomic analyses of virions to include host proteins that may be packaged into the virus particle along with the viral components. these three proteins alone have significantly added to the understanding of how HIV-1 interacts with its host. they serve as an example of what can be learned from studying virion-associated host proteins. proteomic analyses of native influenza virus ribonucleoprotein and polymerase complexes have been performed which result in the identification of 45 interacting cellular proteins. detection of proteins by this method is restricted to more abundant proteins. the presence of M2 and NEP proteins in the influenza virion was only discovered much later using specific antibodies [26],[28]. antibody-mediated detection is extremely sensitive but not practical. both intact influenza virions and partially disrupted virions were observed. the proteins in the purified virus preparation were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. deglycosylation produces a more uniform set of peptides from a potentially diverse number of glycoprotein isoforms. this is because trypsin does not always efficiently digest highly glycosylated proteins. sensitivity is increased because deglycosylation produces more uniform set of peptides from a potentially diverse number of glycoprotein isoforms. PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2 and NEP were not detected. PB1 and PB2 are predicted to be the most abundant proteins in the influenza virion. the exceptions are HA and NA, where greater sequence coverage was obtained with the MudPIT analysis. we identified 36 virion-associated cellular proteins. seventeen of these were identified by both MS methods. another 13 were identified only with the mudPIT analysis. each table indicates the protein name, its predicted mass, the gel slice in which it was found (where relevant), the number of observed peptides, the score associated with the match and the percent sequence coverage. enolase 1 2023 47169 20* 6 318 22.1 4 1 9 cytoplasm 3325 2135 HCMV [3], EBV [6], KSHV [8] beta actin 60 41005 22\u201323* 5\u201314c 158\u2013372c 37.5 2 0.92 8 cytoplasm 3117 3708 HCMV [3], EBV [6], VV [10], HIV-1 [11],[31], KSHV [8], MoMLV [13] a gel slices were numbered consecutively from the top to the bottom of an 8\u201316% gel. a Mascot score 50 and a Protein prophet score 0.95 are equivalent (p0.05).

CD9 and CD59 are membrane-bound proteins found on cellular surfaces. if they are incorporated into an influenza virus particle one would expect them to be in the viral envelope and thus sensitive to protease digestion. however, to further address the possibility that they are not part of the virion, we made use of an alternative gradient medium (Optiprep) which maintains iso-osmotic conditions at high densities. purified influenza A/WSN/33 virus was either mock treated or subjected to overnight digestion with subtilisin followed by concentration through a sucrose cushion. 10 ug of mock infected cell lysate (lane 1) or influenza infected cell lysate (lane 2) and 2 ug of untreated influenza virions (lane 4) were then analyzed by western blot with antibodies against the indicated proteins. za virions purified from supernatant of infected Vero cells were immunogold labeled with antibodies against (A) Hemagglutinin, (B) CD9, (C) CD81 and (D) normal mouse IgG. labeled virus was negatively stained with sodium silicotungstate and visualized by electron microscopy (50,000 magnification) a deglycosylated sample was compared to an untreated sample. the three polymerase proteins resolved as two bands, both uncleaved (HA0) and cleaved (HA1 and HA2) forms of HA were present. there were also some much fainter bands visible that may represent cellular proteins. deglycosylation produces a more uniform set of peptides from a potentially diverse number of glycoprotein isoforms. the sensitivity is increased because deglycosylation produces a more uniform set of peptides from a potentially diverse number of glycoprotein isoforms. however, the reported identifications from the two approaches were combined. 1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2 and NEP were not detected.

grouped together in functional categories such as cytoskeletal components and glycolytic enzymes. subtilisin protease protection assay has been shown to effectively remove microvesicles from HIV-1 virion preparations [30],[31] subtilisin protease protection assay has been shown to remove microvesicles from virus particles. in doing so, the microvesicles become lighter than the virions. if they are incorporated into an influenza virus particle one would expect them to be in the viral envelope and thus sensitive to protease digestion. the alternative gradient medium (Optiprep) maintains iso-osmotic conditions at high densities and is therefore particularly good at separating membranous organelles. ug of mock infected cell lysate (lane 1) or influenza infected cell lysate (lane 2) and 2 ug of untreated influenza virions (lane 3) or protease treated influenza virions (lane 4) were then analyzed by western blot with antibodies against the indicated proteins. a proteomic analysis of influenza A virions has confirmed the presence of nine virus-encoded proteins in the virus particle. in total 36 host proteins were identified with a confidence level >95% based on matches of the peptide sequences with proteins. 17 of these were detected using two independent techniques. some viruses, including influenza virus and HIV-1 have been proposed to assemble at and bud from specific microdomains in the plasma membrane termed \u201clipid rafts\u201d [35]\u2013[39]. lipid analysis of purified HIV-1 virions has shown a composition strikingly similar to that of lipid raft-resident proteins. a number of the proteins identified in influenza virions have been reported to play a role during certain stages of the infection process for a variety of viruses. these include: i) Cytoskeletal proteins The host cytoskeletal network is involved in the transport of viral components in the cell and particularly during the stages of virus entry and exit. annexins are calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins. they are proposed to act as scaffolding proteins at certain membrane domains. it is also required for the apical transport of vesicles in polarized cells. tetraspanins, including CD9 and CD81, have also been implicated in fusion and egress pathways for a number of viruses. this finding is obviously contradictory to the present proteomic analysis of influenza virions in which CD9 was detected by mass spectrometry. virion CypA is proposed to facilitate a conformational change in the capsid which enables the virus to evade detection by the host immune response. a strong interaction between CypA and SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein has also been reported [77] and CypA relocalizes to sites of viral replication in vaccinia virus infected cells. virus transmitted to another host species would become susceptible to lysis by the complement system of that host. some of these cellular proteins have functions other than their described major roles. a role in RNA virus transcription has also been proposed for GAPDH. the proteins identified in this and other studies represent a snapshot of a particular point in the viral life cycle. they provide a foundation for further analysis of cellular requirements for influenza virus infection. for viruses that can infect multiple species such as influenza virus, any host protein that is required for infection must be active in both species. non-viral components will help to assess whether levels present in each vaccine dose are high enough to risk inducing an allergic response. cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and actin are required for viral gene expression [48]\u2013[51] for influenza virus. annexins A1 and A5, which both interact with A2, have the opposite effect of preventing fusion. the calcium-binding protein S100A11 which is known to interact with annexin A1 [61] was also identified in the influenza virion, suggesting that they may be packaged as a complex. iency virus and canine distemper virus do not assemble at domains rich in tetraspanins and does not incorporate CD9 or CD63 into virus particles. this finding is obviously contradictory to the present proteomic analysis of influenza virions. cyclophilin B is a complement regulatory protein that acts by inhibiting formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) it is a GPI-anchored protein and the experimental data confirm that it is associated with the influenza virus envelope. a strong interaction between CypA and SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein has been reported. a number of proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway were identified. enolase and phosphoglycerate kinase have been reported to stimulate transcription of the Sendai virus genome. but it is unclear whether their glycolytic activities are required or whether this is an example of an alternative function for these proteins. virion-associated host proteins can be one of the determinants of virus host range due to their species-specific activity. it will also be interesting to compare the identity and abundance of host proteins in influenza viruses that produce virions with a filamentous morphology. Influenza A/WSN/33 virus was propagated in MDCK cells in minimal essential medium (Gibco) supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) and 0.1% fetal bovine serum. the supernatant was layered over a 20% sucrose cushion in NTE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA) the concentrated virus was purified over a 30\u201360% sucrose gradient (112,600g, 3 hrs, 4\u00b0C) and the banded virus collected, diluted with NTE buffer, pelleted (112,600g, 90 min, 4\u00b0C) purified virus equivalent to 50 ug of protein was incubated with 100ug of subtilisin protease in 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8) and 1 mM CaCl2 for 18 hours at 37\u00b0C. treated virus was diluted to 1 ml with NTE buffer and 5ug of PMSF (Sigma) was added. blots were analyzed by chemiluminescence and exposed to x-ray film. for protein staining, gels were stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain. a 20 minute wash with 100 l, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile was followed with a 10 minute 75% acetonitrile wash. gel bands were then air dried and 15 l of 6.7 g/l sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) was added to each well. the protein digests were then analyzed using a Waters CapLC liquid chromatography system. a protein was considered identified when Mascot listed it as a significant match/score (p0.05) with the proper enzymatic cleavage sites. this would have required either combining the data from all gel slices or treating each gel slice as an individual Peptide/Protein Prophet model. a protein probability could be based on peptides present in separate bands on the gel. on-line MS analysis was performed on the ABI QSTAR XL system. MS data was surveyed for 0.5 s, and MS/MS acquisition was performed on three highest peptide peaks. the search results for each fraction were analyzed using the NCBInr database. the 95% Protein Prophet probability cutoff corresponds to a 0.6% false positive error rate. monoclonal antibody against CD59 (MCA1054GA) was obtained from Serotec (Oxford, U.K.) monoclonal antibody against CD81 (555675) was obtained from BD Pharmingen. protein was precipitated from each fraction with 20% trichloroacetic acid. denatured by heating at 100\u00b0C for 10 min in the presence of 0.5% SDS, 40 mM DTT and 1%NP40. virus was concentrated through a 20% sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation. whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis in extract buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 280 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate and protease inhibitors [Complete; Roche]) at 65\u201370 hours post infection the cells primary antibody (10 ug/ml) was diluted in 1%BSA/TBS. secondary gold-conjugated antibody was added for 1 hr at room temperature. grids were then washed twice with TBS, once with water and negatively stained with 1% sodium silicotungstate (pH 7) for 15 sec. initial HPLC conditions were 95% buffer A and 5% buffer B with the following linear gradient: 3 min, 5% B; 43 min 37% B; 75 min 75% B; and 85 min 95% B. the mass spectrometer switched automatically from MS to MS/MS modes when the total ion current increased above the 1.5 counts/second threshold set point. the NCBInr protein database was chosen over other genome specific databases to allow a wider search match found based on homology to other species. parameters used were partial methionine oxidation and acrylamide modified cysteine. l aliquot of each sample was injected and desalted on a reversed phase C18 trap column. on-line MS analysis was performed on the ABI QSTAR XL system. MS data was surveyed for 0.5 s, and MS/MS acquisition was performed on three highest peptide peaks. (0.05 MB DOC) Click here for additional data file.
