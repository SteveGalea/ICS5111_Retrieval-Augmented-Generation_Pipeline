{"summary": "a certain percentage of ribosomes are forced to shift to another reading frame. this switch occurs at a specific position on the mRNA, called the slip site or slippery sequence, and can be either forwards (+1) or backwards (1). the nature and efficiency of frameshifting depends on several factors, including tRNA availability and modifications. base triples in several pseudoknots have been shown to play an essential role in frameshifting. for pseudoknots with a longer stem S1 of 10\u201311 bp, like that of IBV, base triples do not contribute to frameshifting (15) some studies have investigated a correlation between hairpin stability and frameshift efficiency of natural shifty hairpins. a hairpin composed of the same base pairs as a frameshifter pseudoknot is not very efficient in inducing frameshifting in mammalian cells and lysates. plasmid pSF208 was digested with SpeI and NcoI. sets of complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the various mutants were inserted. transcripts were purified by successive phenol/chloroform extraction. samples were boiled for 3 min in 2 Laemmli buffer and loaded onto 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels. band intensity of 0-frame and 1 frameshift products was measured using a Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software. candidates of interest were constructed in a dual luciferase vector, pDUAL-HIV(0), essentially as described previously (14,27). cells were transfected with 300 ng of plasmid using 1 l of lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) in a 24-well plate. luciferase activities were quantified by Glomax-multidetector (Promega, Benelux) the in vivo experiments were done at least three times in triplicate. the in vitro and in vivo framesshifting efficiencies were induced by four selected 9 bp hairpins with different loops. transcripts were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. in vitro translation Experiments were carried out in duplicate using serially diluted mRNAs with final concentration of 5 nM. heLa cells were cultured in DMEM/high glucose/stable glutamine. they were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 U/ml penicillin. cells were kept in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the average FS (%) and error bars were from at least three independent experiments. the frameshifting efficiency was obtained by measuring dual-luciferase activity of a frameshift reporter construct. in vivo experiments were done at least three times in triplicate. the wild-type SRV-1 pseudoknot (SRV-hp) showed 22% frameshifting efficiency, whereas the SRV-1 pseudoknot (SRV-pk) in this context yielded 31%. the pseudoknot in these experiments is a modified version of the wild-type SRV-1 pseudoknot previously used for NMR and functional analysis (14). a selection of above hairpins was cloned into a dual-luciferase reporter plasmid. the pseudoknot in these assays was 1.6 times more efficient than the 12 and 15 bp hairpins, close to the in vitro ratio of 1.4. however, the hairpin derivative can effectively substitute for the SRV-1 pseudoknot in 1 ribosomal frameshifting. a single or triple adenosine bulge mutant decreased frameshifting. the effect of bulges at the 3\u2032 side of the stem was less dramatic. loop composition plays a major role in hairpin stability, RNA/RNA and RNA/protein interaction. the tetraloop with a CG closing base pair (cbp) has higher stability (2 kcal/mol) than that with a GC cbp (31). Interestingly, increasing the loop size to 9 nt, which is predicted to lower the stability of stem did not affect frameshifting. GGGA tetraloop construct induced 1.7-times more frameshifting than its sibling. loop composition affects frameshifting efficiency in vivo and in vivo. bp hairpin derivative of the SRV-1 pseudoknot (SRV-hp) showed 22% frameshifting efficiency, whereas the SRV-1 pseudoknot (SRV-pk) in this context yielded 31%. this is a modified version of the wild-type SRV-1 pseudoknot previously used for NMR and functional analysis (14). size from 12 to 15 bp or 21 bp did not significantly alter frameshifting. decreasing stem size led to a steady decrease in frameshifting efficiency. a selection of above hairpins was cloned into a reporter plasmid. bulges in the 12 bp stem at a position corresponding to the junction in the SRV pseudoknot (Figure 3A) decreased frameshifting about 10 fold. the frameshift inducing ability was recovered when the base pair was restored to A\u2013U (12 bp/AU). the tetraloop with a CG closing base pair (cbp) has higher stability (2 kcal/mol) than that with a GC cbp (31). Interestingly, increasing the loop size to 9 nt, which is predicted to lower the stability of stem did not affect frameshifting. two other loop mutants, ACAA and AAAU, induced 5.2% and 4.7% frameshifting respectively. the GGGA tetraloop construct induced 1.7-times more frameshifting than its sibling. loop composition affects frameshifting efficiency in vivo. a 17 bp hairpin with a calculated stability of 31.2 kcal/mol induced 5- to 10-fold less frameshifting in RRL (22) than its parent pseudoknot. a 12 bp hairpin derivative of the SRV-1 gag-pro pseudoknot with a calculated stability of 26.9 kcal/mol was capable of inducing 22% of frameshifting. the dnaX gene with the highly efficient (prokaryotic) AAAAAAG slippery sequence is not directly comparable to our in vitro system. a 6 bp hairpin in the dnaX gene displayed 17% of frameshifting without upstream enhancer, whereas a 6 bp hairpin in our system induced only 3.5% of frameshifting. a pioneer single-molecule pulling study showed that introducing a mismatch in a 20 bp DNA hairpin shifted its transition state close to the location of the mismatch (36). HTLV-2 gag-pro features a perfect 10 bp hairpin with CUA tri-loop which induces 9% frameshifting in RRL (16). we used non-capped transcripts, a 7-nt spacer and RRL from Promega. in our experiments we used capped transcripts, a 6-nt spacer and in-house prepared RRL. on the other hand, the 26% we obtained for the IBV hairpin would be a factor of 1.6 lower than the 42% reported for the IBV pseudoknot. a 9 bp stem capped with a GAAA tetraloop is 2-fold less efficient in inducing frameshifting than its UUCG counterpart in vivo and in vivo. the tetraloop is the most common loop size in 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs (37) hairpins of various base composition in stem and loop can act as frameshift stimulators. despite its high stability, the GAAA tetraloop is absent can be taken as support for this hypothesis."}
