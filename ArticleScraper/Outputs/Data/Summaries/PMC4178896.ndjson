{"summary": "frameshifting and readthrough are examples of translational recoding signals that suspend the normal readout of the genetic code. some 5 to 10% of ribosomes translating gag read through the stop codon, inserting glutamine, and continue translation to produce the Gag-Pol polyprotein. readthrough signal is located 3\u2032 of the gag UAG codon and consists of a compact hairpin-type pseudoknot consisting of two stems, S1 and S2, connected by a single base, loop L1 and an 18-nucleotide loop, L3. the readthrough signal is labeled with the first-generation mutations and color coded to indicate the predicted effect on pseudoknot stability (blue, stabilization; red, destabilization). in RSV, up to an 8-fold reduction or 3-fold increase in frameshifting is tolerated before viral propagation is disrupted (24). a limitation of many studies to date, however, is that a broad range of recoding efficiencies has not been tested. gammaretroviruses tolerate a substantial excess of viral Gag-Pol synthesis. the full-length muLV Moloney strain proviral clone was a kind gift of S. P. Goff, Columbia University. DNA fragments of 100 bp spanning the MuLV readthrough region were derived by PCR amplification and ligated into appropriately cleaved pDluc vector. all sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. a cellular protein (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]) was used as a loading control. a cellular protein (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH] was used as a loading control. PBST (IRDye 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgGH+L and IRDye 680RD goat anti-mouse IgM) were scanned, and bands were quantified using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor) samples were allowed to bind; they were washed twice with PBST. rats were seeded in 96-well plates at 4 103 cells/well in a final volume of 100 l/well. aliquot of each diluted sample (100 l/well) was added to each of five wells of a 96-well plate containing Rat2 cells seeded as above. eRF1 and eRF3 short hairpin (sh) oligonucleotides with 19-nucleotide-long targeting sequences were cloned in pRETRO-SUPER. pRETRO-SUPER expresses a transcript containing the viral packaging signal, the H1-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) cassette, and the puromycin resistance gene. the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 154,000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the pellet was gently resuspended in 100 l of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, and 100 g of proteinase K. cDNA was PCR amplified and cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy Vector ( plasmids were inserted into pNCA to generate pNCA series of virus mutants. the same strategy was used to generate a virus lacking protease activity (substitution of Asp for Asn at the PR active site) this virus expresses an unprocessed Gag-Pol polyprotein of 90 kDa. values for readthrough efficiency were calculated by dividing the expression ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase (Fluc/Rluc) of the samples by the Fluc/Rluc ratio of the in-frame control. muLV replication was assessed by transfection of proviral clone constructs and subsequent infection of rats with virions released from transfected cells. membranes were incubated in the dark with an IRDye-conjugated secondary antibody in PBST (IRDye 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgGH+L and IRDye 680RD goat anti-mouse IgM) blots were scanned, and bands were quantified using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor) thiothreitol (DTT), 0.05% (vol/vol) NP-40, 10 g/ml poly(A), 5 g/ml oligo(dT), 10 g/ml dTTP, 8 Ci of [-32P]dTTP] were pipetted onto DE81 paper in grid formation and allowed to dry. the paper was washed in 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer (four times for 5 min each) and water ( cells were cloned in pRETRO-SUPER (Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antonie van Leeuwenhoek Hospital) cells were fixed/permeabilized in methanol-acetone (1:1) for 30 min. nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST. supernatant was collected, filtered (0.45-m pore size) and used to infect Rat2 cells three times over a 24-h period. transduced cells were selected and cultured in the presence of puromycin. mutations were designed to destabilize stem 1 (S1d) or stem 2 (S2d) or were single base changes in the spacer (SP1 or SP2) or loop 3 (L3.1 or L3.2) three other mutants were prepared: the UAG stop codon was changed to UGA or UAA. readthrough of the muLV gag stop codon allows expression of the Fluc gene as a fusion with the upstream Rluc gene. d and S2d were greatly inhibitory (27- to 65-fold down in both cell types) Changing the stop codon to UGA had essentially no effect on readthrough (7, 37, 38), and the stem 1 stabilizing mutation indeed stimulated readthrough (an up mutant with about a 2-fold increase; 13 to 16% depending on cell type) TCID50 assays were performed with serial dilutions of 293T-transfected cells. samples were harvested at 96 hpi and stained for Gag. plates were imaged and scored for the presence of fluorescent signal. mutants pNCA-SP2, -S1d, -S2d, and -L3.2 were found to be severely attenuated, with little (SP2 and L3.2) or no (S1d and S2d) evidence of their replication. a 2-fold reduction in RTE (SP1) has no discernible effect on replication. we found that RT levels increased as RTE increased, whereas Gag levels decreased by a small amount. a strong correlation (R2 = 0.91) was observed between the resultant RT/Gag ratios and the RTE. to generate additional viruses with enhanced levels of readthrough, further mutations were introduced into the pseudoknot (second-generation mutants) both viruses exhibited dramatic phenotypes in virus assays. cell lysates of transfected cells showed accumulation of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. p30 was undetectable in these mutants. readthrough efficiencies were calculated as described in the legend of Fig. 2A. values represent the means of at least eight samples from three independent experiments. it is known that depletion of eRF1 enhances readthrough at all three stop codons as does the depletion of eRF3 in some cell lines (44). it has been shown that MuLV RT binds to eRF1 to modulate suppression of translation termination, upregulating readthrough and creating a positive feedback loop. muLV replication in control and eRF3 knockdown cells in infectivity assays. the virus replicated very poorly in the knockdown cells. it was impossible to say whether this was a consequence of the modest stimulation of RTE. 750 g/ml was the most effective concentration for stimulation of muLV readthrough. it increased it by 1.5-fold and allowing a range of RTEs to be produced from 6% (pDluc MuLV no gentamicin) to 20% (pDluc-S1GC-NMR3 with gentamicin) however, in virus infectivity assays, we found no effect of adding this optimal gentamicin concentration to cells following transfection of proviral pNCA-S1d and pNCA-CAG and the encoded Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins would be expressed at levels determined by the input ratio of the two plasmid DNAs. each infecting virion would, in principle, integrate only one copy of the viral genome. this experimental system permits only a single round of infection to be studied. ds providing Gag protein only (pNCA-S1d mutant) or Gag-Pol protein only (pNCA-CAG mutant) were transfected into 293T cells. each cell is estimated to receive an average of 500,000 copies of plasmid. all cells are highly likely to take up the correct proportion of plasmids on transfection. pNCA-CAG (Gag-Pol only) plasmid provides effective readthrough efficiency from 0 to 100%. released virus was used to infect subconfluent Rat2 cells. cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoblotting. RT activity increased up to 60% RTE but dropped dramatically at 80 and 100% RTE. titer decreased by only 2.2-fold at 80%. virus infectivity was essentially unaltered between 20 and 60% RTE. ilutions of viral supernatants were subjected to dot blot analysis using the anti-p30 antibody. the RT/Gag ratio was calculated for each sample and is shown normalized to the WT value, set as 1. Error bars represent standard errors. at 80% RTE, very few sequences (six) were obtained. of these, one-third were S1d and the other two-thirds were revertants (CAG to UAG WT) no sequence information could be recovered from 100% CAG infections. cDNA was transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus RT. different clones were cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega) different clones were sequenced from 293T-transfected cells and Rat2-infected cells. mutations were synonymous and designed to destabilize stem 1 (S1d) or stem 2 (S2d) or were single base changes in the spacer (SP1 or SP2) or loop 3 (L3.1 or L3.2) three other mutants were prepared: the UAG stop codon was changed to UGA or UAA. readthrough of the muLV gag stop codon allows expression of the Fluc gene as a fusion with the upstream Rluc gene. two (UAA and SP1) led to a decrease of 1.7- to 3.1-fold. three (SP2, L3.1, and L3.2) led to decreases between 4- and 10-fold. stem destabilizations (S1d and S2d) were greatly inhibited. TCID50 assays were performed with serial dilutions of 293T-transfected cells. samples were harvested at 96 hpi and stained for Gag. values represent the mean of duplicate titrations from two independent experiments. mutants pNCA-SP2, -S1d, -S2d, and -L3.2 were found to be severely attenuated. mutants pNCA-SP2, -S1d, -S2d, and -L3.2 were found to be severely attenuated, with little (SP2 and L3.2) or no (S1d and S2d) evidence of their replication. a 2-fold reduction in RTE (SP1) has no discernible effect on replication. mild reductions have some effect, and more than an 8-fold reduction abolishes virus replication. we also addressed the question of whether modulating readthrough efficiencies altered the proportions of Gag and Gag-Pol in released virions. both viruses exhibited dramatic phenotypes in virus assays. p30 was undetectable in these mutants. p30 was undetectable in these mutants. 293T and Rat2 cells were transfected with pDluc-MuLV or a second-generation mutant derivative (NMR1 to NMR4) independently and in combination with the S1GC mutation. readthrough efficiencies were calculated as described in the legend of Fig. 2A. eRF1 and eRF3 are responsible for recognizing stop codons in the ribosomal A site. depletion of eRF1 enhances readthrough at all three stop codons. it is known that depletion of eRF1 enhances readthrough at all three stop codons as does the depletion of eRF3 in some cell lines. muLV replication in control and eRF3 knockdown cells in infectivity assays was unexpected but may reflect a difference in the mechanism of readthrough manifest as differential sensitivity to eRF1 levels. the virus replicated very poorly in the knockdown cells, and it was impossible to say whether this was a consequence of the modest stimulation of RTE or the evidently poor growth rate. rRNA and interfere with small-subunit function by modulating A-site-decoding accuracy (47) this results in translational misreading at sense codons (misincorporation) and misreading of nonsense codons as sense codons (readthrough) this results in translational misreading at sense codons (misincorporation) and misreading of nonsense codons as sense codons (readthrough) a glutamine codon replaced the original stop codon to ensure an RTE of 100%. gRNAs produced from episomal pNCA-S1d and pNCA-CAG were transfected into 293T cells in proportions to yield effective RTEs of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%. each infecting virion would integrate only one copy of the viral genome and therefore produce either Gag or Gag-Pol polyproteins. proviral plasmids providing Gag protein only (pNCA-S1d mutant) or Gag-Pol protein only (pNCA-CAG mutant) were transfected into 293T cells. each cell is estimated to receive an average of 500,000 copies of plasmid. each cell is estimated to receive an average of 500,000 copies of plasmid. 293T cells were transfected with different proportions of pNCA-S1d and/or pNCA-CAG (Gag-Pol only) plasmid. released virus was used to infect subconfluent Rat2 cells. cell lysates and supernatant virus were analyzed. extracellular protein analysis by immunoblotting revealed productive infection was achieved in the intermediate RTE range (20 to 60%) but not at the extremes (0%, 80%, and 100%) RT activities increased up to 60% RTE but dropped dramatically at 80 and 100% RTE (Fig. 6A), almost certainly due to the lower levels of particle production. values represent the means of two independent experiments with standard errors. RT activity was normalized to a defined activity of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) (1 RT unit is equivalent to 1 U of SuperScript III) a small proportion of the sequenced readthrough signals had accumulated point mutations, mostly within loop 3. at 80% RTE, very few sequences (six) were obtained. of these, one-third were S1d, and the other two-thirds were revertants (CAG to UAG WT). 293T cells were transfected with different proportions of pNCA-S1d (Gag only) and/or pNCA-CAG (Gag-Pol only) plasmid to generate an effective readthrough efficiency from 0 to 100%. released virus was used subsequently to infect Rat2 cells. TCID50 assays were performed with supernatant serial dilutions. values denote the means of duplicate titrations from two independent experiments. DISCUSSION Translational recoding signals are potentially exploitable as targets for antiviral intervention (16, 49, 50), supporting this, replication of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae L-A totivirus (50\u201352), HIV-1 (reviewed in reference 16) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated cor transfected 293T cells identified a synonymous stem-stabilizing mutation (S1GC) of the muLV readthrough pseudoknot that increased readthrough some 1.5-fold, but this had no effect on replication. however, these mutants could not be used in the assessment of virus fitness as all resulted in a defective protease and failed viral polyprotein processing. reproducibly stimulated muLV readthrough 1.5- to 2.0-fold. gentamicin did not greatly stimulate readthrough of premature termination codons. gentamicin and stimulatory pseudoknot mutations were synergistic, similar to those observed in studies on stimulatory effects of polyamines or rpL4 on MuLV readthrough. pNCA-S1d and -CAG generated a lower RTE gradient. the titers from these transfections were very similar to those obtained from individual viruses with cis-acting mutations within the pseudoknot. the particle number dropped 30-fold between the WT level and 100% RTE. virus infectivity was unaltered between 20 and 60% RTE. at 80%, the titer measured decreased by only 2.2-fold. titers reduced by 100- to 1,000-fold before viral replication was compromised. pathogenic viruses utilizing readthrough include feline leukemia virus (65), equine encephalitis alphavirus (66) and Colorado tick fever virus (67)."}
