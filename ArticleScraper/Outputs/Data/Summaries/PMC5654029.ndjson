{"summary": "self-administered questionnaires were distributed and collected before resident education activities in 4 tertiary hospitals in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. the questionnaire included questions related to residents\u2019 demographic data and their emotions, attitudes, and knowledge related to an MERS outbreak. part comprised 4 main sections that included an assessment of 1) work-related and 2) non-work related emotions, 3) the residents\u2019 attitude toward MERS, and (4 their knowledge of an MERS outbreak. Statistical analysis All data were summarized as frequencies (percentages) or medians [IQRs]. each question in these sections was measured using a 3-point Likert scale. it ranged from \u201cdisagree\u201d (1) to \u201cagree\u201d (3). most of participants were male and single (65% for both) and 94% of participants rated their level of knowledge about MERS as fair or good Table 1. more than half of respondents disagreed with the idea that people would avoid them and their family due to a higher risk of infection associated with their job. nearly 39% said they avoided telling their family about this potentially greater risk. nearly 47% of residents believed their hospital had a clear plan for handling a MERS outbreak. participants with higher self-rated knowledge of MERS were more likely to feel that the job put them at risk. participants with higher self-rated knowledge of MERS were more likely to feel that the job put them at risk. participants with higher self-rated knowledge of MERS were more likely to feel that the job put them at risk. at least two-thirds of residents believed their job put their family at a greater risk of infection. more than half of respondents disagreed with the idea that people would avoid them and their family due to a higher risk of infection associated with their job. nearly 39% said they avoided telling their family about this potentially greater risk. residents who felt personally ready for a MERS outbreak were more likely to accept the risk as part of their job (=0.15, p=0.026) and to disagree that they should not look after MERS patients (= -0.20, p=0.002) or that they might change their job due to the risk of MERS infection. participants were also not willing to change their jobs due to the risk of exposure to MERS. they were confident that the hospitals would look after them if they were infected. these findings are consistent with studies conducted in other countries dealing with different viral outbreaks. in both Tam et al6 and Nickle et al5 studies, medical doctors were a minority of participants, making up only 9% and 3% of their cohort. a greater percentage of HCWs who were older than 35 years reported a high level of concern about infection than did older staff. the study was conducted in 4 tertiary hospitals in a single city. the results might not be generalizable to residents in other parts of the country. medical residents are the frontline physicians in handling patients with MERS."}
