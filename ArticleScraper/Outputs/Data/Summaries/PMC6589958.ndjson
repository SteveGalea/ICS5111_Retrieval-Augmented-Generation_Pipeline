{"summary": "the increase of emerging and re-emerging communicable diseases has attracted the attention to the importance of communicable diseases reporting and surveillance systems. disease surveillance depends on the definition of case and recognition of illness, compilation of individual data, analysis, and reporting. there are no previous studies about knowledge, attitudes, and compliance of physicians regarding surveillance of reportable diseases in Jordan. identification of physician\u2019s knowledge will help to implement roadmap to improve the knowledge and close the identified gaps. the questionnaire was pilot tested among 50 physicians who were not included in the study sample. the differences between the proportions were compared using chi-square test. 102 73.4 55 65.5 157 70.4.210 Detect and notify disease outbreaks 102 73.4 72 85.7 174 78.0.031 Health education and advocacy 86 61.9 57 67.9 143 64.1.366 Research purpose 96 69.1 68 81.0 164 73.5.051 Determine the prevalence of disease 104 74.8 71 84.5 175 78.5.088 Sources of public health surveillance data.016 Controlled clinical trials 28 20.1 6 7.1 a relatively high proportion of physicians had poor knowledge of when to report some mandatory diseases that should be reported. less than one third of physicians correctly identified that the following conditions should be reported immediately. animal bite or hepatitis A should be reported weekly. icitis 30 13.5 24 10.8 169 75.8a Chickenpox (varicella) 80 35.9 114 51.1a 29 13.0 Sudden onset of fever; jaundice, and hemorrhagic signs 122 54.7a 54 24.2 47 21.1 Diarrhea twice daily 23 10.3 59 26.5 141 63.2a Child under 5 years old with watery diarrhea and fever 70 31.4 93 41.7a 60 26.9 Otitis media study included 223 physicians (152 males and 71 females) with a response rate of 44.6%. their age ranged between 21 and 38 years with a mean (SD) of 31.2 (7.4) years. 145 (66.5%) respondents had working experience of less than 5 years. s 102 73.4 72 85.7 174 78.0.031 Health education and advocacy 86 61.9 57 67.9 143 64.1.366 Research purpose 96 69.1 68 81.0 164 73.5.051 Determine the prevalence of disease 104 74.8 71 84.5 175 78.5.088 Sources of public health surveillance data.016 Controlled clinical trials 28 20.1 6 7.1 34 15.2 Case studies 10 7.2 10 11.9 20 9.0 Direct observations 34 2 more than one third of physicians correctly stated that animal bite or hepatitis A should be reported weekly. more than half of physicians correctly stated that animal bite or hepatitis A should be reported weekly. the main reasons for not reporting mandatory diseases are shown in Table 3. Practice of disease notification Only 27.4% of physicians had been educated or trained on surveillance. 49.8% reported high workload and 46.6% reported being not trained on reporting diseases. in using the technology used in the disease reporting 40 28.8 28 33.3 68 30.5.474 Not trained on reporting diseases 56 40.3 48 57.1 104 46.6.014 Discussion The doctor-based surveillance systems provided critical information for early detection of communicable diseases, so that immediate public health intervention can curtail the number of illnesses and deaths. only 39.5% of physicians who diagnosed at least one communicable disease had filled a notification form. a similar level of underreporting in other studies suggests a need of knowledge of the study of disease transmission of a few notifiable infections. the study has some limitations. first, health services providers in private sector were not included in the study. the generalizability of study findings is potentially limited."}
