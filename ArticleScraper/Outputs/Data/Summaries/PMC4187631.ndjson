{"summary": "intestinal Afa/Dr adhesins (Afa/Dr DAEC) in urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pregnancy complications are well established. these strains are age dependently involved in diarrhea in children and are apparently not involved in diarrhea in adults. this comprehensive review analyzes the epidemiology and diagnosis and highlights recent progress. human Escherichia coli strains are classified as commensal microbiota E. coli, enterovirulent E. coli, and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) on the basis of their genetic features and clinical outcomes. their serotypes are based on virulence factors present in small or large virulence-associated plasmids or chromosomal pathogenicity islands. the DAEC class of pathogenic E. coli was previously subdivided into two subclasses: DAEC expressing Afa/Dr adhesins (Afa/Dr DAEC) and DAEC not expressing Afa/Dr adhesins (11) the main member of this subclass, i.e., the diarrhea-associated DAEC encoding an adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA-I) (12\u201315), five phylogenetic groups, including the main phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2, and D, have been identified in Gram-negative species. the name \u201cAfa/Dr DAEC\u201d was proposed in 2005 to define a family of human UTI- or diarrhea-associated clinical E. coli isolates harboring adhesins encoded by the afa (24\u201328), dra (29, 30), and daa (31, 32) operons. adhesins, phenotype and genotype methods have been developed. UPEC strains expressing Afa-I (37), Afa-III (28), and Dr (38) also developed DA adhesion onto Hep-2 or HeLa cells. the DCA could give overestimated results since several aEPEC strains have been found to be daaC positive (13, 46\u201353) DNA probes included drb (56), a 260-bp PstI fragment of the pIL14 plasmid (afa-1 operon) coding for the AfaE-I adhesin of uropathogenic Afa/Dr DAEC KS52 strain (25); daaC a-f and afa-r flanked a 672-bp DNA segment internal to the afaC gene of the afa-3, afa-7, and afa-8 operons. multiplex PCRs to detect UPEC-associated genes have been described, including afa1 (65) or genes expressed by diarrheagenic E. coli. the biogenesis of the well-characterized EAEC adhesins AAF-I, -II, and -III and Hda (75\u201378) involved a periplasmic chaperone, an outer membrane usher protein, a major adhesin subunit, and a capping subunit (79\u201381). the cross-reaction makes it difficult to establish a clear identification of Afa/Dr DAEC in relation to diarrhea. afaBC/daaC positivity has been found in UPEC strains belonging to the B2 phylogroups. UPEC isolates expressing Afa/Dr adhesins are involved in cystitis in children (25 to 50%) and pyelonephritis in pregnant women (30%). fa-r PCR probes and in some cases to express afaE1 (5%), afaE8 (39%), and afaEX (20%) operons (45). drb-probe positive E. coli isolates displayed positivity with the type 1 pilus probe (80 to 100% positivity) and the P fimbria probe (50% positivity) pathogenic ETEC, tEPEC, aEPEC, and AIEC colonize the small intestine, EHEC colonizes the distal ileum and colon, and EIEC colonizes the colon (4, 5). there is an absence of a role of Afa/Dr DAEC in diarrhea in adults. epidemiological studies in various areas of the world are inconclusive. the sat gene has been found in almost half of the diarrhea-associated Afa/DrDAEC strains. it was not present in all the non-diarrhea-associated Afa/DrDAEC strains 137. why and how Afa/Dr DAEC isolates are potential pathogens in children with an age-dependent occurrence remain to be determined. coli strains can be tolerated or controlled if the mature intestinal epithelial barrier is in a healthy condition. phenotype and genotype methods have been developed to detect the adhesion of diarrheagenic E. coli onto cultured, nonintestinal, undifferentiated epithelial Hep-2 and HeLa cells. the DCA could give overestimated results since several aEPEC strains have been found to be daaC positive (13, 46\u201353) DNA probes included drb (56), a 260-bp PstI fragment of the pIL14 plasmid (afa-1 operon) coding for the AfaE-I adhesin of uropathogenic Afa/Dr DAEC KS52 strain (25), daaC afaE-I, afaE-II, afaE-III/draE, and afaEV (64); and primers afa-f and afa-r flanked a 672-bp DNA segment internal to the afaC gene of the afa-3, afa-7, and afa-8 operons. multiplex PCRs to detect UPEC-associated genes have the biogenesis of the well-characterized EAEC adhesins AAF-I, -II, and -III and Hda (75\u201378) involved a periplasmic chaperone, an outer membrane usher protein, a major adhesin subunit, and a capping subunit (79\u201381) the cross-reaction makes it difficult to establish a clear identification of Afa/Dr DAEC in relation to diarrhea. afaBC/daaC positivity has been found in UPEC strains belonging to the B2 phylogroups. UPEC isolates expressing Afa/Dr adhesins are involved in cystitis in children (25 to 50%) and pyelonephritis in pregnant women (30%). some human pyelonephritis E. coli isolates have been found to be positive for afa1-afa2 and afa-f-afa-r PCR probes. in some cases to express the afaE1 (5%), afaE8 (39%), and afaEX (20%) operons (45). a UTI-associated E. coli strain generally expresses a multiplicity of the presence of an E. coli strain harboring the combination of P and Dr fimbriae in a case of fatal sepsis in a pregnant woman who developed pyelonephritis. epidemiological studies in various areas of the world are inconclusive with regard to a role of daaC-positive E. coli strains in diarrhea in children. the sat gene has been found in almost half of the diarrhea-associated Afa/DrDAEC strains. the sat gene was not present in all the non-diarrhea-associated Afa/DrDAEC strains 137. a possible explanation is that in children in this age range, the intestinal epithelial barrier is not structurally and functionally mature. pathogenic bacteria express surface-exposed adhesins responsible for specific binding to structural or functional cell membrane-associated molecules. attachments onto target host cells allow enteric and urinary tract bacterial pathogens to resist clearance by peristalsis and micturition. fimbrial adhesins, consisting of linear homopolymers or heteropolymers, and afimbrial adhesins, formed of single proteins or homotrimers (142) major families of adhesive proteins (145) include the classical chaperone/usher pathway-dependent fimbrial adhesins (146, 147), the alternate chaperone/usher pathway-dependent E. coli surface pili (148), the extracellular nucleation precipitation the structure of long and short Afa/Dr adhesins develops by the assembly of the bacterial membrane usher, successive E adhesin subunits, and one D subunit capping the structure. the chaperone usher functions in UPEC to form adhesive structures such as the P pili. the papG subunit triggers recognition of host cell membrane-associated globoseries glycolipids. brial Human Negative Positive AfaE-V Afimbrial Bovine Unknown Negative Unknown AfaE-VIII

AAF-I Fimbrial Human Unknown Unknown Unknown Unknown AAF- cells contain five genes: afaA, afaE, afaD, afaB, and afaC (24). cells contain five genes: afaA, afaE, afaD, afaB, and afaC. afa-3 gene cluster contains six genes designated afaA to afaF (163) afa-possessing E. coli strains have been found to be expressed by UPEC, diarrhea-associated E. coli, and E. coli isolated from the feces of asymptomatic patients. the afa-7 and afa-8 operons encode the AfaE-VII and AfaE-VIII adhesins (26, 44) the human pyelonephritis-associated wild-type UPEC strain E. coli IH11128 (O75) exhibits mannose-resistant Dr fimbriae (29) five Dr operon-associated proteins with molecular masses of 15.5, 5, 18, 32, and 90 kDa are necessary for the development of the complete MRHA. the DraD subunit localizes at the tip, because it lacks a donor strand. expression of the DraD subunit has been found to be independent of the DraC usher. the major structural subunit DraE is involved in host cell receptor recognition (170) distinctly different binding phenotypes controlling affinity to hDAF, ability to bind collagen type IV and hCEACAMs, and sensitivity of adhesiveness capacity to chloramphenicol. conflicting results have been obtained. the human wild-type prototype diarrheagenic strain C1845 expresses a fimbrial adhesin, designated F1845. the order and regulation of genes necessary for F1845 adhesin assembly have been identified (31, 32, 164, 165, 192\u2013194) flagellar swarming coordinates the movement of bacteria across the host cell surface (198) UPEC strains expressing type 1 pili or P fimbriae are less flagellated and display repressed motility. the prototype pyelonephritis-associated, wild-type Afa/Dr DAEC strain IH11128 does not possess flagellar antigens. secreted autotransporter toxin belongs to type V secretion pathway-dependent subfamily of serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) toxins. class I includes plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet) of EAEC, extracellular serine protease, plasmid encoded (EspP) of EHEC, EspC of EPEC, SigA of Shigella flex the sat gene has been characterized in the UPEC prototype strain CFT073 (205), where it resides within PAI-IICFT073 (206\u2013209) the sat gene is prevalent in UPEC strains including those bearing Afa/Dr adhesins (8, 56, 137, 206, 208, 210\u2013214), resident intestinal microbiota E. coli stains, and pathogenic strains of E. coli. draD and draE, but not in draA, draB, and draC, abolish hemolytic activity, indicating that this activity is supported by the extracellular domain of Dr fimbriae. strain IH11128, gestational pyelonephritis Dr-positive E. coli isolates (94, 155), and clinical Dr-positive E. coli isolates (60) all lack either hemolytic activity or hly gene expression. the wild-type C1845 and IH11128 strains expressed a part of PAICFT073 (207\u2013209) not including the hlyA, hlyD, hp1-hp4, papG, or papF sequences (60). a remnant of the pap operon which has the F10 papA allele but lacks most of the central region of the pap operon has been detected. the locus designated vpe (virulence-associated phosphotransferase) contains the vpeA, vpeB, and vpeC genes. this locus is present in the pyelonephritis-associated strain AL511, which expresses the afa-8 operon (43), which conferes an ability to adapt for kidney and intestinal colonization (231) the intracellular vacuole-containing E. coli in HeLa cells lack the characteristics of a degradative compartment. no filamentous forms of Afa- or Dr-positive E. coli residing intracellularly have ever been observed. exopolysaccharide production plays a pivotal role in biofilm completion. the cluster of genes known as the \u201cpks island\u201d encodes a multienzymatic machinery for synthesizing the hybrid, nonribosomal, peptide-polyketide genotoxin colibactin (240) it has been suggested that the pks island may affect the host immune response and could be involved in chronic inflammation, in the accumulation of genomic instability, and in tumor progression (241) the intestinal microbiota E. coli strain Nissle 1917 expresses the pks genomic island. it harbors parts of PAICFT073 that lack the expression of -hemolysin and P fimbriae but includes iron uptake systems. if the presence of the pks island is deleterious for the host or without pathological consequences remains to be investigated. attachment initiates an orderly series of signaling-controlled events that lead to host cell membrane rearrangements that are necessary for the achievement of bacterial cell entry followed by the development of sophisticated bacterial intracellular lifestyles. the major families of adhesive proteins (145) include the classical chaperone/usher pathway-dependent fimbrial adhesins (146, 147), the alternate chaperone/usher pathway-dependent E. coli surface pili (148) adhesins are encoded by genes present in operons containing five major genes. they are encoded by highly conserved genes A to D, encoding accessory proteins, and more divergent genes E, encoding the adhesin subunits. the bacterial membrane usher, successive E adhesin subunits, and one D subunit capping the structure has been described. sensitivity to chloramphenicol (161, 162). Afa/Dr adhesins and Afa/Dr-related adhesins Adhesin Type Host Receptors Type IV collagen hDAF hCEACAMs AfaE-I Afimbrial Human Negative Positive Positive AfaE-VII Afimbrial Bovine Unknown Negative Unknown AfaE-VIII Afimbrial Human Negative Positive Positive the first Afa adhesin was isolated from the wild-type prototype UPEC strain KS52. the 6.7-kb chromosomal DNA fragment essential for a mannose-resistant hemagglutination (MRHA) phenotype in human erythrocytes contains five genes: afaA, afaE, afaD, afaB, and afaC (24). the afimbrial or fimbrial morphologies of the adhesins were influenced by the order in the genes coding for the afimbrial or fimbrial adhesin subunits (28). the afaE-III adhesin subunit is involved in recognizing host cell receptors (158, 159) such as the DraE and daaE adhesin subunits (170) the human pyelonephritis-associated wild-type UPEC strain E. coli IH11128 (O75) exhibits mannose-resistant Dr fimbriae. the role of the FGL chaperone/usher biogenesis pathway of Dr fimbriae has been investigated in detail. two conserved cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond are important for stabilizing elements of the immunoglobulin fold of the Dr fimbriae. jedrzejczak et al. (181) have shown that the DraD subunit localizes at the tip of the fiber because it lacks a donor strand. adhesins in expressing chloramphenicol sensitivity for binding onto host cell receptors. binding of Afa-I to -III and F1845 is not affected (27, 185, 186) the Dr-II adhesin has 96% identity with the nonfimbrial adhesin I (NFA-I) expressed by UTI-associated E. coli. the nfa gene cluster encodes NfaA subunits assembled via the chaperone-usher pathway. afimbrial adhesins encoded by afa operons. first Afa adhesin isolated from wild-type UPEC strain KS52. 6.7-kb chromosomal DNA fragment essential for mannose-resistant hemagglutination phenotype in human erythrocytes. biophysical studies have revealed that the structural organization of Afa-III adhesin develops by assembly onto the bacterial membrane usher of AfaE-III adhesins subunits (158, 159) capped by the AfaD-III subunit (166\u2013168) a diffuse and not well-ordered cell surface localization of the AfaD-III subunit has been observed by immunoelectron microscopy (42, 168, 169) E. coli regulates the expression of the AfaD-VIII subunit (172) despite the presence of the Afa-VIII adhesin in human intestinal E. coli isolates. in calves, pigs, and poultry with diarrhea there was the presence of E. coli isolates expressing sequences of the afa-8 operon (173) aC is lacking, there are no protein subunit secretion and fimbria assembly, since the protein complexes amass in the periplasm. in the case of the E subunit, two conserved cysteine residues are important for stabilizing elements of the immunoglobulin fold of the Dr fimbriae. single-nucleotide polymorphisms conferring an adaptive advantage have been identified. genes encoding Dr fimbriae form eight structural groups displaying a high level of amino acid sequence diversity among them. the Dr-II adhesin has been isolated from the human pyelonephritis-associated strain EC7372. the Dr-II adhesin has 96% identity with the nonfimbrial adhesin I (NFA-I) expressed by UTI-associated E. coli. the fimbrial gene expression in the daa operon was regulated by both phase variation and environmental regulatory mechanisms. UPEC strains expressing type 1 pili or P fimbriae are less flagellated and display repressed motility, suggesting that when fimbrial expression is switched off, UPEC strains are motile. only seven of the 19 afaE1-, afaE2 or afaEX-positive, diarrhea-associated E. coli isolates they examined are motile. UPEC and diarrhea-associated Afa/Dr DAEC display heterogeneous flagellum expression. class II includes protein involved in intestinal colonization (Pic) of Shigella, EAEC, and UPEC, SepA of Shigella, EatA of ETEC, vacuolating autotransporter toxin (Vat)-like toxins of UPEC, SEPEC, and ETEC. class II displays diverse activities, including the cleavage of mucus, which provides a competitive advantage for host epithelium colonization (81, 204). pyelonephritogenic strain EC7372 expresses Dr-II adhesin (30) strain promotes a strong cellular lysis in epithelial cells preceded by apoptosis (102) strain EC7372 carries both the hly and pap operons and seems to have acquired a larger part of the PAIsCFT073 (207\u2013209) than DAEC. the wild-type C1845 and IH11128 strains expressed a part of PAICFT073 (207\u2013209) not including the hlyA, hlyD, hp1-hp4, papG, or papF sequences. the wild-type C1845 and IH11128 strains expressed a part of PAICFT073 (207\u2013209). regions of the PAICFT073 complete genome sequence (207, 209, 224) have been found in E. coli strains of the B2 phylogenic group (208) and are prevalently expressed in exPEC strains of group B2 involved in UTIs (8). parts of PAICFT073 have recently been found in intestinal commensal E. coli strains. UPEC cells in IBCs form biofilm-like bacterial assemblages. UPEC cells in IBCs function as transient protective structures for UPEC intracellular growth (199, 232) UPEC cells in IBCs constitute reservoirs of UPEC. the pks genome island encodes a multienzymatic machinery for synthesizing the hybrid, nonribosomal, peptide-polyketide genotoxin colibactin (240) it has been suggested that the pks island may affect the host immune response and could be involved in chronic inflammation and in tumor progression. the pks island has been found in exPEC strains of phylogenetic group B2 (242), in fecal E. coli strains isolated from healthy patients but not in pathogenic EPEC and EHEC isolates (243), in group B2 E. coli strains that are long-term colonizers of the intestine (22), in E. coli isolated from the mucosa of patients with IBD (244\u2013246) the first subclass includes strains harboring the Afa-I (25, 37), Afa-II (27), Afa-III (27), Afa-V (64), Dr (29, 155), Dr-II (30), and F1845 (32) adhesins recognizing hDAF. the second subclass includes strains that express Afa-VII (26, 44) and Afa-VIII (26, 44) adhesin cluster 3 (78) also includes the nonfimbrial M-agglutinin encoded by the bma gene cluster of UPEC (250). hDAF acts as an epithelial cell receptor for E. coli expressing Afa/Dr adhesins. hDAF is one of the receptors recognized by Afa/Dr adhesins in epithelial cells. hDAF is one of the receptors recognized by Afa/Dr adhesins in epithelial cells. the Afa-VIII adhesin expressed by human exPEC does not recognize hDAF (26, 43, 44) it has been established that Afa/Dr adhesins recognize the CCP-2 and CCP-3 on hDAF (41, 158, 159, 257\u2013259) Anderson et al. (158) observed that the binding of AfaE-III to hDAF antagonized the hDAF regulatory activity. five daaE mutants showed a 30 to 50% reduced ability to bind onto CHO cells transfected for hDAF expression. surface electrostatic potentials of the DraE, DaaE, AfaE-V, and AfaE-I adhesins are shown. red indicates the negative charges and blue the positive charges. binding of the DraE adhesin subunit onto hDAF is sensitive to chloramphenicol, which also inhibits the hDAF-dependent MRHA of human erythrocytes. the presence of chloramphenicol diminished the adhesion of DraE+/DraD+ E. coli by 3-fold and totally abolished the adhesion of DraE+/DraD+ E. coli. acylating the 3-hydroxyl group has no effect on the binding onto hDAF. the cell membrane-bound hDAF is hijacked by viruses, including coxsackievirus serotypes B1, B3, and B5 (263, 264) and coxsackievirus A21 (265), enteroviruses (266), and echoviruses (267, 268) hamster ovary cells and human cervical cancer cell lines transfected for the expression of each of the human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecules (hCEACAMs) (CEACAM1 to 8) found that the Dr, F1845, and AfaE-III adhesins bound only to cells expressing epithelial hCEACAM1, hCEA, or hCEACAM6. the murine CEACAM1 CEACAM5, CEACAM6, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8 are anchored within the cell membrane through a GPI linkage. six other family members are anchored via bona fide transmembrane domains. CEACAM16 is devoid of any membrane anchorage and is the only known secreted CEACAM. the gene encoding CEACAM1 contains 9 exons that generate 11 different isoforms with long or short cytoplasmic tails and long or short cytoplasmic domains (275). the long cytoplasmic domain contains two ITIMs. the cytoplasmic S domain lacks the presence of tyrosine residues (275). hCEA was initially defined as a tumor-associated marker. overexpression is often associated with enhanced metastatic potential. however, it is important to remember that despite its name, hCEA is normally expressed in tissues, including intestinal M cells, enterocytes, and colonic cells. UPEC and diarrhea-associated Afa/Dr DAEC strains recognize the epithelial hCEACAM1, hCEA, and hCEACAM6 and the nonepithelial hCEACAM3 as host cell receptors. it is not known whether hCEACAMs are recognized by the Afa-VIII adhesin. mutagenesis analysis has identified residues F29, Q44, and D40. the hCEACAM8 N-terminal domain is not recognized by Afa/Dr adhesins. the site overlaps a surface area of 1,446, localizing primarily in the A, B, E, and D strands. the binding of the DraE adhesin subunit-expressing E. coli to hCEA was inhibited by chloramphenicol. the binding of the AfaE adhesin subunit III-expressing E. coli to hCEA was resistant to chloramphenicol (160). some hCEACAMs can form homophilic (hCEACAM1/hCEACAM1, hCEA/hCEACAM6, and hCEACAM6) hCEACAMs are important for the pathogenicity of Neisseria. hCEACAMs triggered cell signaling, allowing bacteria to penetrate into human tissues. hCEACAMs are important for the pathogenicity of Neisseria. CEACAMs are targeted by the adhesive factors of Neisseria (293), H. influenzae (291), M. catarrhalis (292) and mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 virus (294, 295). the fimH variant of the AIEC prototype wild-type strain LF82 probably recognizes glycosylated epitopes at the IgAs domain of CEACAM6 (288) the role of type IV collagen in the pathogenesis of Afa/Dr DAEC remains largely elusive. the basolateral localization of type IV collagen in the epithelium prevents it from functioning as a receptor for Dr adhesin during Afa/Dr DAEC infections. the association detected with the DraD adhesin subunit cannot reflect the normal bacterial situation in which the Dr adhesin is well formed and expressed at the E. coli cell surface. the signaling activity at cellular membranes depends on constant membrane reshaping plus interactions with the dynamic cytoskeleton, thereby regulating the potency of molecular reactions. membrane flotillin/reggie proteins facilitate the physical organization of lipid raft macrodomains. a particular lattice network of filaments named the cortical actin cytoskeleton underlies the plasma membrane and allows a connection with lipid rafts (316) draE mutants with impaired type IV collagen and chloramphenicol binding sensitivity conserved the property of inducing hDAF receptor clustering around adhering bacteria. hDAF receptor clustering around adhering bacteria was lower in HeLa and CHO-hDAF cells infected with E. coli mutants. absence of CCP2 or CCP3 abolished receptor-clustering activity. hDAF, hCEA, and hCEACAM6 are endogenously associated with lipid rafts. hDAF-dependent signaling involving MAPKs leads to proinflammatory cytokines responses, PMNL transmigration, and autophagy followed by cell detachment. hCEACAM receptor clustering around adhesin-positive E. coli infecting HeLa cells. hCEACAM receptor clustering is not promoted by the DraE adhesion subunit mutant D54C (41) in stably transfected cells expressing hDAF, hCEA, or hCEACAM6, the receptor clustering around adhering Dr adhesin-positive E. coli is associated with the clustering of fine rings of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. surprisingly, there was an absence of recruitment of F-actin around Dr adhesin-positive E. coli infecting primary bladder epithelial cells constitutively expressing hDAF. fine rings of F-actin associated with hCEACAM1-, hCEA-, and hCEACAM6-expressing cells. dense rings of F-actin ringed the Opa-expressing Neisseria adhering to hCEACAM3-expressing cells. low level of internalization into hCEA- and hCEACAM6-expressing cells is not affected by cytoskeleton blockers. micrographs show the mobilization of the lipid raft marker ganglioside GM1 around Dr adhesin-positive E. coli adhering to HeLa cells. the 51 integrin has been mobilized so as to form fine rings around adhering Dr adhesin- or AfaE-III adhesion subunit-positive bacteria (188, 189, 317, 332) integrin around E. coli adhering to CHO-hDAF-51 cells occurred for bacteria expressing DraE or AfaE-III adhesin subunits alone. integrins have been found in lipid rafts engaged in cell adhesion (333\u2013335), cell migration (336, 337), and contractile forces for cell invasion (337\u2013339) hDAF plays a crucial role in the recruitment of phosphorylated Src kinases and Src kinase activation. deletion of c-Src in HeLa cells abolishes hDAF clustering. siRNA silencing of the Src kinases Yes, Fyn, and Lyn does not. hCEACAM1-4L has been found to play a key role in downregulating the activity of the protein tyrosine Src kinase associated with hDAF signaling. hCEACAM1-4L has been found to play a key role in downregulating the activity of the protein tyrosine Src kinase associated with hDAF signaling. UPEC strains have an elevated organ tropism and ascend the urinary tract from the urethra to the bladder and kidneys. lower UTIs affect the urethra and bladder, whereas upper UTIs affect the ureters and kidneys. UPEC has developed a reciprocal regulation of adhesive factors and motility (199) UPEC secretes cytotoxic toxins, including the repeat-in-toxin -hemolysin (HlyA), cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF-1) and diverse SPATE toxins. UPEC adapts to survive in the urine by expressing factors involved in scavenging nutrients. lipid rafts play a pivotal role in the internalization of adhesin-positive E. coli into cultured cervical HeLa cells, primary cultured human bladder cells, and epithelial cells transfected to express hDAF, hCEACAM1, hCEA, or hCEACAM6. a particular network of microtubules, i.e., the dynamically unstable microtubule network, has been found to be involved in the cell absence and presence of changes in F-actin mobilization around adhering bacteria showed unchanged levels of cell internalization. phosphorylation of ERM accompanied the Dr-positive E. coli cell entry (188) agree well with the know role of ERM, which together with Rho GTPases act in the remodeling of host cell cytoskeleton. the Ser165-Ala mutant conserves normal binding activity but displays a lower invasion rate. the Gly159-Ala mutant shows both reduced binding capacity and a lower invasion rate. in contrast, the PI3K-dependent signaling pathway is engaged in the internalization of Dr adhesin-positive E. coli into hCEACAM1-, hCEA-, and hCEACAM6-expressing epithelial cells. membrane immunoprecipitation showed that AfaD-III and -VIII adhesin subunits coprecipitated with 1 integrin (332) the role of 51 integrin as a receptor for internalization of E. coli expressing Dr- or Afa-III adhesin subunits into epithelial cells has been recently revisited. integrins are located exclusively at the basolateral domain and never at the brush border of the polarized intestinal epithelial cells. the identity of the virulence factor(s) of Afa/Dr DAEC involved in the invasion of epithelial cells has long been debated. coating polycarbonate beads with afaD protein allows the beads to penetrate the epithelial cells. rAfaE-III\u2013gold complexes associate with the cell surface, whereas AfaD-gold complexes are internalized within the cells. insertional draE, draC, and draB mutants were unable to enter epithelial cells. examined using appropriate E. coli mutant strains and cultured unpolarized epithelial cells and bladder cells. Korotkova et al. (188) found that expressing combinations of the DraE+/DraD+ and DraE+/DraD adhesin subunits allowed E. coli to enter differentiated primary bladder cells. enteric bacterial pathogens reside and survive in the cell cytoplasm in small or large vacuoles, where they may or may not replicate. only a few invasive enteric bacterial pathogens have developed strategies to escape from the vacuole to gain access to and proliferate within the host cell cytosol. internalization occurs in nonpolarized epithelial cells via the recognition of membrane-associated hDAF, or hCEACAM1, hCEA, and hCEACAM6. despite the fact that Dr adhesin-positive bacteria bind to membrane-associated hDAF during the first step of cell association, the membranes of the late vacuoles do not contain hDAF (189) autophagy flux leads to lack of maturation of autophagosomes into autophagolysosomes. cells lose focal adhesion contacts and become detached from substratum (6). high-magnification micrographs show observation by CLSM of paxillin immunolabeling (red) infecting UPEC was rapidly cleared in the presence of a deficiency of the key autophagy protein Atg16L1 suggesting that UPEC may subvert autophagy proteins to establish latency. however, the autophagy pathway can favor the pathogen, since internalized bacteria present within intracellular bacterial communities in superficial bladder cells colocalized with Atg16L1 and LC3 puncta. a mutation in the CCP-3 extracellular domain of hDAF promotes the dormant vacuolar persistence of internalized Dr adhesin-positive E. coli. a mutation in the CCP-3 extracellular domain of hDAF promotes the dormant vacuolar persistence of internalized Dr adhesin-positive E. coli. a mutation in the CCP-3 extracellular domain of hDAF promotes the multiplication of vacuolar bacteria (2 type 1 pilus-positive UPEC after cell entry resided in endocytic vesicles in which its replication is restricted. this intracellular lifestyle permits the long-term maintenance of quiescent UPEC in the bladder cells. the host has developed defense systems including exfoliation and cell death of bacterially infected cells. the autophagy pathway induced is not intended to destroy the intracellular toxin, since the toxin is never present in autophagic vesicles. in turn, the Sat-intoxicated cells overexpressing autophagosomes die as a result of autophagy cell death. UPEC infection is accompanied by a strong inflammatory response, including the production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-17a, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (199, 382). neutrophils and macrophages play a pivotal role in the defense against UTI (383). isogenic DraE adhesin subunit mutant lacking binding to type IV collagen fails to persist within the mouse renal tissues. transcomplementation of the mutant strain allows the reestablishment of a long-term renal infection. hDAF is present in the endometrial glands, spiral arterioles, and myometrial arteries. in the uterus, hDAF is present in the endometrial glands, spiral arterioles, and myometrial arteries. interindividual differences in hDAF density in the endometrium influence the tissue colonization by Dr adhesin-expressing E. coli. the decrease in mortality rate paralleled the decrease in the invasiveness capacity of a Dr adhesin-positive E. coli strain (397). it has been proposed that infectious complications of pregnancy related to the host nitric oxide (NO) status. nonpregnant rats were treated with an inhibitor of NO, nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) the death rate was increased by treatment with the NO blocker l-NAME in both mice and rat (403, 404) the mouse DAF is clearly not recognized by Afa/Dr adhesins (254) polarized intestinal epithelial cells are lined by a monolayer of highly polarized epithelial cells. enterocytes, neuroendocrine cells, goblet cells, and paneth cells are constantly renewed by detachment from the villus tip (373) polarized intestinal epithelial cells express an apical domain facing the luminal compartment. recombinant Dr adhesin- and Afa-I adhesin-positive E. coli strains adhere to cultured human enterocyte-like HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. wild-type strain C1845 displays a low level of cell entry when infecting the permissive epithelial Hep-2 cell line, 20-fold lower than that of the prototype invasive AIEC wild-type strain LF82. apical pole structure of enterocytes is composed of a dense array of microvilli. formation of the brush border results from a complex epithelial polarity program (408) microvilli are formed by assembly of parallel arrays of actin filaments. zonula occludens proteins required for TJ assembly also regulate the organization of the apical cytoskeleton. hDAF-dependent injuries in microvilli in fully differentiated Caco-2 and T84 cells (341, 410). elongation of microvilli occurs, and finally, the lesion results in a loss of microvilli. this injury results in rearrangements of structural brush border proteins. lesions induced by diarrhea-associated wild-type strain C1845 result from adhesin-triggered, hDAF-dependent signaling events. hDAF-associated signaling pathways, including protein tyrosine kinase(s), phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and ca2+, are activated. adhesin-expressing recombinant recombinant E. coli strain triggers F-actin cytoskeleton disassembly accompanied by the appearance of cytoplasmic phosphotyrosylated proteins. in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, the adhesin-triggered disassembly of brush border cytoskeleton-associated proteins is Ca2+ signaling dependent (412) the low-molecular-weight GTPases RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 are enzymes that in the host cells control a wide range of physiological processes. the endogenous activators of the Rho family GTPases are guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (426) several vesicle cargoes containing brush border hydrolases and several proteins that have immunological function or are involved in inflammatory responses have been identified. this effect, which has as a direct consequence the extrusion of brush border-attached bacteria, has a limited and/or temporary impact on intestinal function. er 1 (PEPT1) is responsible for the uptake of di- and tripeptides (441). er 1 (PEPT1) is responsible for the uptake of di- and tripeptides (441). er 1 is responsible for the uptake of di- and tripeptides (441). adherence junctions (AJs) and desmosomes act as adhesive domains between intestinal epithelial cells. the junctional domain in epithelia plays a critical role in health. adherence junctions (AJs) and desmosomes act as adhesive domains between intestinal epithelial cells. enterovirulent bacteria have developed sophisticated strategies to breach the intestinal barrier by means of effectors that target the structural molecules that compose the TJs. pathogen-induced intestinal barrier deficiencies have been linked to the onset of inflammation and diarrhea (409) Sat induces the formation of fluid domes by increasing transcellular passage (137) these fluid-filled, blister-like structures known as fluid domes are randomly distributed areas that evolve permanently into the cell monolayers. this result is interesting since Taddei et al. (221) have reported that Sat can induce secretory activity, resembling the enterotoxic activity of ETEC, in rabbit ileum tissues mounted in an Ussing chamber. mutile, AfaE1-, AfaE2-, or afaEX-positive diarrhea-associated strains induced the production of high levels of IL-8 in T84 and Caco-2 cells. the production is daa or dra operon dependent, involves binding onto brush border-associated hDAF. the production is daa or dra operon dependent, involves binding onto brush border-associated hDAF. virulence factor causing structural opening of TJs allows flagellin to reach basolaterally expressed TLR5 (454) PMNLs play a pivotal role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and are critical actors in the innate immune response that protects the host against microbial pathogens. hDAF functions as an antiadhesive molecule accelerating the release from the luminal surface of PMNLs that have undergone transepithelial migration. it remains to be determined whether the abnormal basolateral expression of hDAF in infected colonic T84 cells is also a cell defense response that in turn can block basolateral recruitment and transmigration of PMNLs. pathogenic bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate traits that allow them to establish and maintain infection in their host. in e. coli, QS involves autoinducers AI-2 and AI-3. epinephrine promotes a language by which bacteria and host cells communicate. a rapid and massive release of reactive oxygen species and preformed intragranular mediators develops in PMNL-like PLB-985 cells infected with wild-type IH11128 and C1845 strains. hDAF expressed at the membrane of freshly isolated PMNLs mediated by Dr adhesin did not lead to a significant increase of bacterial killing. phosphatidylserine appears at the cell membrane of PMNL-like PLB-985 cells. hDAF-dependent activation of tyrosine kinase occurs, but without apoptosis. low levels of phagocytosis of Afa/Dr DAEC bacteria were observed in both nontransmigrated and transmigrated PMNLs. activation of a Src protein kinase upstream of the activation of the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. upregulation of VEGF has also been observed in epithelial cells infected with an Afa-I adhesin-positive E. coli strain. hCEACAM1 and hCEACAM6 are known to be involved in immune responses. the control of anoikis in differentiated epithelial intestinal cells is a differentiation-dependent process involving the engagement of 1 and 4 integrins and activation of FAK, Src kinase, and the Erk1/2 and Pi3K/Akt signaling pathways. the diarrhea-associated C1845 affects the AJs of intestinal epithelial polarized colonic cells. partial EMT can develop as a function of the tissue and signaling contexts. the two major hallmarks of EMT are the dissolution of epithelial cell-cell adhesion contacts and actin cytoskeleton reorganization followed by the loss of cell polarization. an F1845-triggered hDAF-, MAPKs-, PI3K-, and HIF-1-dependent production of VEGF develops in colonic-like T84 cells (1 and 2). an hDAF-, MAPKs-, PI3K-, and HIF-1-dependent production of VEGF develops in colonic-like T84 cells (1 and 2). the presence of the pks genomic island coding for the genotoxin colibactin in the prototype wild-type Afa/Dr DAEC strains leads to the appearance of known pks-related cell changes (240). pks-related cell injuries were abrogated when the cells were infected with a mutant colibactin strain (clbA::frt) deleted for the clbA gene. an hDAF-dependent MAPK-, PI3K/Akt-, and HIF-1-triggered signaling leads to the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8. this leads to the up-expression of brush border-associated hDAF (4) and basolateral MICA (5) and the abnormal expression of hDAF at the basolateral domain (5). low- and high-magnification field emission scanning electron micrographs show NETs expressed by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated PMNL-like PLB-985 cells. microvillar vesicles shed after tEPEC infection of Caco-2BBe clone cells (489) the microvillus membrane to form vesicles is an effective host defense mechanism intended to extrude adhering enterovirulent bacteria from the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium.

UPEC secretes cytotoxic toxins, including the repeat-in-toxin -hemolysin (HlyA), cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF-1) and diverse SPATE toxins. the lipid rafts play a pivotal role in the internalization of Dr- and Afa-III adhesin-positive E. coli into cultured cervical HeLa cells, primary cultured human bladder cells, and epithelial cells transfected to express hDAF, hCEACAM1, hCEA, or hCEACAM6. a particular network of microtubules, i.e., the dynamically unstable microtubule network, positive E. coli, the DraE adhesin subunit mutant strains D54G and D54C showed unchanged levels of cell internalization. phosphorylation of ERM accompanied the Dr-positive E. coli cell entry (188) agree well with the know role of ERM. compared to hDAF, the mutant conserves both normal binding activity and invasion rate. the Ser165-Ala mutant shows both reduced binding capacity and a lower invasion rate. in terms of cell signaling, protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), phospholipase C (PLC-) and protein kinase C (PKC) blockers have no effect on the cell internalization of Dr adhesin-positive E. coli. the role of 51 integrin as a receptor for internalization of E. coli has been recently revisited. the role of 51 integrin as a receptor for internalization of E. coli expressing E. coli has been recently revisited. integrins are located exclusively at the basolateral domain and never at the brush border of the polarized intestinal epithelial cells. the identity of the virulence factor(s) of Afa/Dr DAEC involved in the invasion of epithelial cells has long been debated. afaD-III protein coats the internalized bacteria residing within an internalization vacuole. coating polycarbonate beads with afaD protein allows the beads to penetrate the epithelial cells. afaE-III\u2013gold complexes associate with the cell surface, whereas AfaD-gold complexes are internalized within the cells. and/or D adhesin subunits in the internalization of Afa/Dr DAEC have been recently reexamined using appropriate E. coli mutant strains. recombinant E. coli expressing combinations of the DraE+/DraD+ and DraE+/DraD+/DraD adhesin subunits allowed E. coli to enter differentiated primary bladder cells. enteric bacterial pathogens reside and survive in the cell cytoplasm in small or large vacuoles, where they may or may not replicate. only a few invasive enteric bacterial pathogens have developed strategies to escape from the vacuole to gain access to and proliferate within the host cell cytosol. in-positive E. coli display some of the characteristics of late endosomes. this resembles the characteristics of the UPEC UTI89-containing vacuoles. the membranes of the late vacuoles containing the internalized Dr-positive bacteria do not contain hDAF (189) the massive appearance of autophagosomes is followed by the blockade of autophagy flux, leading to the lack of maturation of autophagosomes into autophagolysosomes. the cells lose the focal adhesion contacts and become detached from the substratum (6). autophagy (363) is an evolutionarily conserved process by which cellular cytosolic structures and cell constituents are degraded and recycled. some intracellular bacteria are detected and eliminated via the autophagic pathway. this pathway may serve as a protected niche providing a source of nutrients for intracellular bacteria. a mutation in the extracellular domain of hDAF promotes the dormant vacuolar persistence of internalized Dr adhesin-positive E. coli. a mutation in the CCP-3 extracellular domain of hDAF promotes the dormant vacuolar persistence of internalized Dr adhesin-positive E. coli. a Phe154-Ala mutation promotes the multiplication of vacuolar bacteria (234) type 1 pilus-positive UPEC after cell entry resided in endocytic vesicles in which its replication is restricted. this intracellular lifestyle permits the long-term maintenance of quiescent UPEC in the bladder cells. eviction of cells from epithelium can occur by a process known as extrusion. the autophagy pathway induced is not intended to destroy the intracellular toxin, since the toxin is never present in autophagic vesicles. the Sat-intoxicated cells overexpressing autophagosomes die as a result of autophagy cell death. new information on immune responses accompanying UPEC infection have recently been obtained in mice models (380, 381) UPEC infection is accompanied by a strong inflammatory response, including the production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-17a, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (199, 382). isogenic DraE adhesin subunit mutant lacking binding to type IV collagen fails to persist within the mouse renal tissues. transcomplementation of the mutant strain allows the reestablishment of a long-term renal infection. thelial bladder cells constitutively expressing hDAF, hCEACAM1, hCEA, or hCEACAM6. CHO or HeLa cells transfected for stable expression of hDAF, hCEACAM1, hCEA, or hCEACAM6 (38, 42, 188, 189, 234, 259, 317, 319, 331, 332, 354) a few invasive bacteria also require a host microtubule network for the invasion of host epithelial cells. a few invasive bacteria also require a functional host microtubule network for the invasion of host epithelial cells. the absence of CCP-2 or CCP-3 abolished the cell entry. replacing the GPI anchor with the transmembrane anchor did not modify the cell entry. compared to hDAF, the mutant conserves both normal binding activity and invasion rate. the 1 integrin is the host cell receptor triggering the zipper-like internalization of type 1 pilus-expressing UPEC. a polyclonal antibody directed against anti-51 integrin abolishes the basolateral entry of Dr adhesin-positive E. coli within undifferentiated intestinal Caco-2 cells. positive E. coli, CHO cells transfected for the stable expression of hDAF, hCEAM1, hCEA, or hCEACAM6 were transfected again with the gene coding for the 5 or 1 integrin subunit (189) the presence of 51 integrin together with hDAF or CEACAMs did not increase the levels of adhering and internalized Dr- or Afa-III adhesin-expressing E. coli compared to recombinant E. coli produces the AfaD or AfaE-III adhesin subunit. the adhesin subunit mediates the cell entry within epithelial HeLa cells. only the AfaD-III protein coats the internalized bacteria residing within an internalization vacuole. insertional draE, draC, and adherent draD mutants were unable to enter epithelial cells. complementation of the draE mutation restored invasion property. role of E and/or D adhesin subunits in internalization of Afa/Dr DAEC has been recently reexamined using appropriate E. coli mutant strains. the DraD adhesin subunit seems to function in the formation of biofilm by Dr adhesin-expressing E. coli (190, 233) enteric bacterial pathogens reside and survive in the cell cytoplasm in small or large vacuoles. only a few invasive enteric bacterial pathogens have developed strategies to escape from the vacuole. intraluminal vesicles are taken for delivery of contents to the lysosome. the intracellular vacuoles containing Dr adhesin-positive E. coli display some of the characteristics of late endosomes. this resembles the characteristics of the UPEC UTI89-containing vacuoles, which are positive for Lamp-1 and CD63, cathepsin D negative, and acidic (362) internalized afa/Dr DAEC cells have survived within large vacuoles. the secreted and cell internalized Sat toxin (3) promotes a dramatic loss of F-actin stress fibers. the cells lose the focal adhesion contacts and become detached from the substratum (6). AAEC185pSatIH11128 contains the secreted Sat toxin (red) and the appearance of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 autophagic vacuoles in CFCSSat-treated cells (green). cellular autophagy (363) is an evolutionarily conserved process by which cellular cytosolic structures and cell constituents are degraded and recycled. internalized Dr adhesin-positive E. coli survived 72 h postinfection in cells transfected to express hDAF and to a lesser extent in cells expressing hCEACAM1, hCEA, or hCEACAM6 (189). the same phenomenon has been observed for several invading pathogens (370). internalized uropathogenic Afa/Dr DAEC cells have developed a capacity to actively modify this compartment so as to create a distinct compartment. a process designated \u201cnutritional virulence\u201d (372) has recently been defined as used by several invasive bacteria which subvert the host cell machinery so as to create a vesicular developmental niche. infected bacterial pathogens have developed countermeasures to antagonize the host epithelial turnover to exploit infected epithelial cells as a survival and replicative niche. the detachment of cells containing intracellular UPEC promotes the reinitiation of the UPEC infectious cycle (199, 232). new information on immune responses accompanying UPEC infection have recently been obtained in mice. UPEC infection is accompanied by a strong inflammatory response. neutrophils and macrophages play a pivotal role in the defense. mouse DAF (mDAF) probably plays no role in this Dr adhesin-induced ascending pyelonephritis in mice. isogenic DraE adhesin subunit mutant lacking binding to type IV collagen fails to persist within the mouse renal tissues. the toxin of the UPEC wild-type strain CFT073 has been found to promote renal histological lesions in mice (387) it remains to be determined whether Sat expressed by strain CFT073 plays a role in the IH11128-induced mice kidney lesions. a high rate of maternal mortality has been observed in rats infected with an AfaE+/AfaD+ strain that causes high rates of maternal mortality. the decrease in mortality rate paralleled the decrease in the invasiveness capacity of a Dr adhesin-positive E. coli strain. hDAF triggers displacement of hDAF from membrane lipid rafts. in rodents, an increase in uterine NO synthase (NOS) activity has been observed during pregnancy. one function of NO generated in the uterus is to inhibit uterine contractility (400) the mouse model showed an NO-independent regulation of hDAF expression in endometrial Ishikawa and cervical HeLa cells involving the PI3K/Akt pathway. the PI3K/Akt pathway negatively regulated the membrane expression of hDAF and consequently downregulated the adhesion of Dr adhesin-positive E. coli. cell-to-cell junctional domain establishes tight contacts with neighboring cells. the basal domain establishes a connection with the basement membrane. afa/Dr DAEC strains infecting cultured enterocyte-like cells attach at the brush border. the level of internalized Afa/Dr DAEC was very low, indicating that these bacteria are noninvasive when in contact with the brush border of human enterocytes lining the intestinal epithelial barrier. however, treating Caco-2/TC7 cells with EGTA results in an increased level of internalized Afa/Dr DAEC infecting the brush border. the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the intestinal pathogenesis of Afa/Dr DAEC have been investigated using cultured fully differentiated human intestinal Caco-2 cells and T84 cells. the microvilli of the intestinal brush border is triggered predominantly via interactions between Afa/Dr adhesin and brush border membrane-associated proteins functioning as signaling receptors. the disappearance of brush border microvilli induced by Afa/Dr DAEC, EPEC, and EHEC is morphologically similar. the mechanism controlling the deleterious effect of Afa/Dr DAEC at the brush border is very different from those for EPEC and EHEC. transmission electron and scanning electron micrographs show disappearance of brush border-associated DPP IV (x-y section) micrographs show the observation by CLSM of immunofluorescence labeling of brush border-associated DPP IV. the phenomenon occurs in epithelial cells infected with a Dr adhesin-expressing E. coli strain. the phenomenon does not occur after recognition of the transmembrane receptor hCEACAM1. the phenomenon does not occur after recognition of the transmembrane receptor hCEACAM1. vesicles expressing membrane-bound sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and maltase-glucoamylase aminopeptidase N (APN) are spontaneously formed at the microvillar tips by a mechanism involving the membrane-binding actin-based motor Myo1a. vesicles contain particularly high levels of proteins that are preferentially partitioned into lipid rafts (429) large and well-organized \u201csuper lipid rafts\u201d have been detected at the membrane of the enterocyte brush border (299) containing some of the major brush border-associated functional proteins (436), including maltase-glucoamylase aminopeptidase N (APN) and sucrase-isomaltase (SI) (437), sucrase-isomaltase (SI) (437), sucrase-isomaltase (SI) (437 in infected cells, there is a strong decrease of enzyme activity of SI and DPP IV (411, 412) this decrease in enzyme activity is related to disorganization of microvillus cytoskeleton and disappearance of microvilli. this indicates that when SI and DPP IV are delocalized from the brush border in infected enterocyte-like cells, the hydrolases relocate into the cytoplasm lose their enzyme activity. ludin and claudins connected with polarized intestinal cells act as a gate. claudins and occludins act as a 'gate' regulating the paracellular passage of small particles and solutes. the claudin family of proteins functions as cation-selective proteins. the toxin Sat induces rearrangements of the TJ-associated proteins ZO-1, ZO-3, and occludin without modifying significantly the claudin-1 distribution. Sat induces the formation of fluid domes by increasing the transcellular passage (137) micrographs show the immunofluorescence labeling of structural TJ-associated ZO-1 protein observed by CLMS in control and AAEC185psat-infected cells. note the Sat-induced disappearance of the protein from the cell-to-cell contacts. flagella isolated from motile Afa/Dr DAEC to produce IL-8 recognize the basolateral toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) flagellin recognizes the basolateral toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and in addition, TJ function is observed to be reduced (454) PMNLs play a pivotal role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. the transepithelial migration of PMNLs induced by Afa/Dr DAEC follows F1845 and Dr adhesin-induced hDAF-dependent basolateral production of IL-8 after activation of Erk1/2, p38, and JNK MAPKs. there was an abnormal appearance of hDAF at the basolateral domain of cells. NKG2D exerts cytolytic destruction of cells through recognition of its cognate ligands. NK cells circulate through the blood, lymphatics, and tissues, patrolling for the presence of pathogen-infected cells (465) pathogenic bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to regulate traits that allow them to establish and maintain infection in their host. norepinephrine increases the Dr adhesin release by affecting the production of the fimbrial subunits. draE transcript is highly increased, while expression of draC transcript is increased to a lesser extent, relative to basal expression. PMNLs that have transmigrated display greater phagocytic activity against E. coli. low levels of phagocytosis of nontransmigrated and transmigrated PMNLs. angiogenesis is a new component of IBD pathogenesis. members of the VEGF family are secreted, dimeric glycoproteins of 40 kDa. VEGF-A, -B, -C, and -D function as regulators of vasculogenesis. the VEGF secreted during C1845-infection of T84 cells is bioactive. hCEACAM1, hCEA, and hCEACAM6 are known to be involved in immune responses. polarized epithelial cells forming an epithelial barrier are detached from the appropriate lateral domain and extracellular matrix. the control of anoikis in differentiated epithelial intestinal cells is a differentiation-dependent process involving the engagement of 1 and 4 integrins. C1845 infection promotes a rise in fibronectin expression, accompanied by the up-expression of Twist1 mRNA (344), a helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor belonging to a small group of core transcription factors. the EMT is a transcriptional and morphological program observed during the progression of diseases, including cancers. hDAF-, MAPKs-, PI3K-, and HIF-1-dependent production of VEGF develops in mouse intestinal and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (482, 483). afa/Dr DAEC strain C1845 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like behavior, cell extrusion, and pks-dependent damage in human intestinal cells. low- and high-magnification micrographs show morphological changes in pks-related cell injuries. presence of pks genomic island coding for genotoxin colibactin in wild-type DAEC strains leads to the appearance of known pks-related cell changes. pks-triggered enlarged cells cells have been recently characterized as senescent cells bearing massive and irreparable damage. p-clbA was restored by the complementation of the mutant strain with p-clbA. bacteria attached at the brush border are entrapped by microvilli and killed (7). in addition, bacteria attached at the brush border are extruded from the intestinal cells when the tips of microvilli are shed. an increase in microvillar vesicles shed after tEPEC infection of caco-2BBe clone cells has been reported. accelerated formation and shedding of microvillar vesicles constitute an efficient host intestinal cell defense response. NETs are formed by a nuclear DNA skeleton and transport antibacterial molecules, including antimicrobial peptides. recombinant adhesin- and Afa-I adhesin-positive E. coli strains adhere to cultured human enterocyte-like HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. the wild-type strain C1845 displays a low level of cell entry when infecting the permissive epithelial Hep-2 cell line, 20-fold lower than that of the prototype invasive AIEC wild-type strain LF82. afa/Dr DAEC never uses the basolateral domain of intestinal epithelial barrier as its natural way of infection. treatment results in an increased level of internalized Afa/Dr DAEC infecting the brush border. this indicates that when the closure at the junctional domain is impaired, it can enter the cells. fa/Dr DAEC is triggered predominantly via interactions between Afa/Dr adhesin and brush border membrane-associated proteins functioning as signaling receptors. hDAF-dependent injuries in microvilli in fully differentiated Caco-2 and T84 cells. hDAF-associated kinase(s), phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and ca2+ are activated. loss of the brush border results in the disassembly of the microvillus cytoskeleton. in undifferentiated human embryonic intestinal INT407 and undifferentiated intestinal Caco-2 cells, infection by the wild-type strain C1845 and an F1845 adhesin-expressing recombinant E. coli strain triggers F-actin cytoskeleton disassembly. in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, the F1845 adhesin-triggered disassembly of brush border cytoskeleton-associated proteins is Ca2+ the phenomenon does not occur after recognition of the transmembrane receptor hCEACAM1. phosphorylation of ERM accompanied the Dr adhesin-induced cell membrane extensions (274) is consistent with the known roles of Rho GTPases and ERM in the completion of the actin cytoskeleton (356). coamylase aminopeptidase N (APN) are spontaneously formed at the microvillar tips by a mechanism involving the membrane-binding actin-based motor Myo1a, but not Myo2. several vesicle cargoes containing brush border hydrolases and several proteins that have immunological function or are involved in inflammatory responses have been identified. rase-isomaltase (SI) (437), Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) isoforms 1 to 3 (438), downregulated in adenoma Cl/base exchanger (DRA) (439), Cl/HCO3/OH exchanger (440), and peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) are responsible for the uptake of di- and tripeptides (441) in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells. the loss of SI and DPP IV enzyme activity is independent of PTK, phospholipase C, PI3K, PKC, and Ca2+ signaling pathways. this indicates that when SI and DPP IV are delocalized from the brush border in infected enterocyte-like cells, the hydrolases relocated into the cytoplasm lose their enzyme activity. the biosynthesis of the hydrolases is severely affected without any change in mRNA levels and protein stability. the gate activity includes two functional paracellular pathways: the leaky pathway, engaging occludin that controls the paracellular passage of larger molecules. the second, named the high-capacity pore pathway, engaging the claudin family of proteins functioning as cation-selective and anion-selective proteins. pathogen-induced intestinal barrier deficiencies have been linked to the onset of inflammation and diarrhea. Sat induces the formation of fluid domes by increasing the transcellular passage. these fluid-filled, blister-like structures are randomly distributed areas that evolve permanently into the cell monolayers as the result of transcellular passage of fluids accumulating basolaterally. highly differentiated apical pole structure of enterocytes is composed of a dense array of microvilli, significantly increasing the intestinal surface area (299) microvilli are formed by assembly of parallel arrays of actin filaments that create the actin bundle. zonula occludens (ZO proteins required for TJ assembly also regulate the organization of the apical cytoskeleton, particularly the perijunctional antimyosin ring. loss of microvilli results in rearrangements of structural brush border proteins. clumping of villin, fimbrin, and -actinin within cytoplasmic aggregates. apical infection of human enterocyte and cultured enterocyte-like cells by EPEC. hDAF and hCEACAM1, hCEA, and hCEACAM6 receptors are activated. loss of the brush border results in disassembly of the microvillus cytoskeleton. microvilli induces defective expression of functional proteins, such as SI, DPP IV, SGLT1 and GLUT5 (3). in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, the adhesin-triggered disassembly of brush border cytoskeleton-associated proteins is Ca2+ signaling dependent (412) cell membrane extensions attached or entrapping adhering Afa/Dr DAEC have been observed in infected epithelial cells. the low-molecular-weight GTPases RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 are enzymes that in the host cells control a wide range of physiological processes. the endogenous activators of the Rho family GTPases are guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (426) the asymmetric presence of membrane-associated functional proteins is monitored during the epithelial polarity program. large and well-organized \u201csuper lipid rafts\u201d have been detected at the membrane of the enterocyte brush border of enterocytes. the default of SI and DPP IV expression at the brush border induced by strain C1845 relates directly to the promoted disassembly of the brush border cytoskeleton. in enterocyte-like cells, there is a strong decrease of enzyme activity of SI and DPP IV (411, 412) junctional domain in epithelia plays a critical role in health. barrier dysfunction at the junctional domain can lead to disease. adherence junctions act as adhesive domains between intestinal epithelial cells. pathogen-induced intestinal barrier deficiencies have been linked to the onset of inflammation and diarrhea (409) ovirulent bacteria have developed sophisticated strategies to breach the intestinal barrier by means of effectors that target structural molecules that compose the TJs. this result is interesting since Taddei et al. (221) have reported that Sat can induce secretory activity, resembling the enterotoxic activity of ETEC. the secreted and internalized Sat toxin induces the reorganization of the TJ-associated proteins ZO-1 and occludin without affecting E-cadherin expression. IL-8 in polarized intestinal T84 cells was produced by nine nonmotile, AfaE1-, AfaEX-positive strains. the production is daa or dra operon dependent, involves binding onto brush border-associated hDAF. the production is daa or dra operon dependent, involves binding onto brush border-associated hDAF. PMNL infiltration resulting from recruitment by chemokines produced by macrophages or epithelial cells at the site of insult is a hallmark of the host inflammatory response to infection with various different enteric bacterial pathogens. the effects of Afa/Dr DAEC strains on the transepithelial migration of PMNLs have been demonstrated in polarized monolayers of human colonic T84 cells cocultured with freshly isolated PMNLs. hDAF functions as an antiadhesive molecule accelerating the release from the luminal surface of PMNLs that have undergone transepithelial migration. it remains to be determined whether the abnormal basolateral expression of hDAF in infected colonic T84 cells is also a cell defense response that in turn can block the basolateral recruitment and transmigration of PMNLs. epinephrine promotes a language by which bacteria and host cells communicate. in wild-type strain IH11128, norepinephrine increases the Dr adhesin release by affecting the production of the fimbrial subunits. a rapid release of reactive oxygen species and preformed intragranular mediators develops in PMNL-like PLB-985 cells infected with wild-type IH11128 and C1845 strains. the phenomenon is triggered not by Afa/Dr adhesins but by the type 1 pili (347) expressed by wild-type Afa/Dr DAEC strains (155) phosphatidylserine appears at the cell membrane of PMNL-like PLB-985 cells, resulting from an adhesin-triggered, hDAF-dependent activation of tyrosine kinase. low levels of phagocytosis of Afa/Dr DAEC bacteria were observed in both nontransmigrated and transmigrated PMNLs. thelial cells infected with an Afa-I adhesin-positive E. coli strain (140) have been found to be controlled by an MAPK- and PI3K-dependent induction of the hypoxia-induced factor 1- (HIF-1) it is interesting to note that the CD-associated AIEC strain LF82 also induces, by an unknown factor, the production of HIF-1 protein. oikis in differentiated epithelial intestinal cells is a differentiation-dependent process involving the engagement of 1 and 4 integrins and activation of FAK, Src kinase, and the Erk1/2 and Pi3K/Akt signaling pathways. the diarrhea-associated C1845 affects the AJs of intestinal epithelial polarized colonic T84 cells. the two major hallmarks of EMT are the dissolution of epithelial cell-cell adhesion contacts and the massive actin cytoskeleton reorganization followed by the loss of cell polarization. after a long time of infection, C1845 infection promotes depolarization of the enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells. this is characterized by the complete disorganization of the apical domain and the loss of cell-to-cell contacts accompanied by the appearance of undifferenti an F1845-triggered hDAF-, MAPKs-, PI3K-, and HIF-1-dependent production of VEGF develops in colonic-like T84 cells (1 and 2). an hDAF-, MAPKs-, PI3K-, and HIF-1-dependent EMT-like behavior develops in colonic-like T84 cells. low-magnification micrographs show the dedifferentiation of Caco-2/TC7 cells inf the presence of the pks genomic island coding for the genotoxin colibactin in the prototype wild-type Afa/Dr DAEC strains leads to the appearance of known pks-related cell changes (240). pks-related cell injuries were abrogated when the cells were infected with a mutant colibactin strain (clbA::frt) deleted for the clbA gene, encoding the phosphop new tab Proinflammatory and defense responses in enterocyte- and colonic-like cells and PMNLs after infection with the diarrhea-associated strain C1845. an hDAF-dependent MAPK-, PI3K/Akt-, and HIF-1-triggered signaling (1) leads to the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8, which promotes the transepithelial migration of PMNLs (2), which in turn promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and low- and high-magnification field emission scanning electron micrographs show NETs expressed by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated PMNL-like PLB-985 cells and in contact with diarrhea-associated C1845 bacteria. the intestinal cells after infection by Afa/Dr DAEC seem to react so as to resolve brush border colonization by releasing the tips of microvilli that were in close contact. NETs are formed by a nuclear DNA skeleton and transport antibacterial molecules, including antimicrobial peptides, histones, and proteases (490, 491) in the human cell line PLB-985, wild-type strain C1845 infection is followed by the projection of NETs. this defense response has an unexpected cell cytotoxic consequence. current routine treatment for UTIs is antibiotic therapy, most commonly trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or ciprofloxacin. conventional antibiotics are not very effective when the bacteria reside within intracellular vacuoles or are present in biofilm-like structures (498\u2013505) resistance to antibiotics has been reported for Afa/Dr DAEC. more than 10% of E. coli cystitis isolates are resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics. resistance to antibiotics has been reported for DAEC. uropathogenic Afa/Dr DAEC strains have developed strategies to escape host defense systems and reduce their sensitivity to antibiotics. a therapeutic strategy has been developed to disarm pathogens in the host by the use of substances that mimic bacterial virulence factors such as adhesive factors, bacterial effectors, and toxins. a subunit vaccine strategy against ExPEC has been designed to target immunodominant epitopes of the virulence-associated ExPEC proteins FyuA, IroN, ChuA, IreA, Iha, and Usp (524) a vaccine strategy has been experimentally tested using the Dr adhesin in the mouse pyelonephritis model (385) draC and afaC-III genes encoding the Afa/Dr adhesins display 100% identity. this pilicide strategy has been found to be effective against Dr adhesin biogenesis. there has been no report of the isolation of E. coli expressing the major human AfaE-I to -III, Dr, or F1845 adhesins in a large variety of animal species. patients with chronic or recurrent cystitis require long-term treatment with antibiotics. conventional antibiotics are not very effective when the bacteria reside within intracellular vacuoles or are present in biofilm-like structures. afa/Dr DAEC-associated diarrhea in children has been described as being generally limited in duration. more than 10% of E. coli cystitis isolates are resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics. resistance to antibiotics has been reported for Afa/Dr DAEC. an emerging therapeutic strategy consists of developing antagonists of QS systems in order to inhibit the bacterium-bacterium and bacterium-host cell communications involved in virulence (523) a single pathogenic E. coli strain expresses a multiplicity of adhesive factors, each of which displays specific host cell receptor recognition. a vaccine strategy has been experimentally tested using the Dr adhesin in the mouse pyelonephritis model. high titers of serum anti-Dr antibodies develop after vaccinating mice with purified Dr adhesin. this is accompanied by a significant reduction in mortality but, surprisingly, without affecting the levels of bladder or kidney colonization by Dr adhesin-positive E. coli. 2-pyridone pilicide compounds could inhibit the biogenesis of Afa/Dr adhesins (83, 176, 177) this pilicide strategy has been found to be effective against Dr adhesin biogenesis. this pilicide strategy produces a marked reduction of the expression of Dr adhesin and the disappearance of its properties of adherence to hDAF (175, 527). epidemiological studies indicate that human intestinal Afa/Dr DAEC strains are probably the high specificity of Afa/Dr adhesins for human epithelium-associated molecules acting as receptors complicates the experimental examination of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Afa/Dr DAEC pathogenesis. human intestinal in vitro organ culture (IVOC) models (528) can offer valuable tools for the experimental investigation of the mechanisms of virulence of intestinal Afa/Dr DAEC. intestinal Afa/Dr DAEC strains act as \u201csilent pathogens\u201d that are well controlled under healthy conditions by the intestinal antimicrobial molecules generated by dedicated cells of the host intestinal barrier and by the barrier effect exerted by the intestinal microbiota (11). the above-described deleterious cellular effects of intestinal Afa/Dr DAEC make us think that these microbiota-resident E. coli in healthy humans could be good candidates for belonging to the recently defined class of \u201c this strain expresses the SPATE toxin Pic (533), translocates across colonic T84 cell monolayers. promotes alterations in localization of claudin-1, activates NF-B signaling, and induces the production of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- (533\u2013535) causes of IBD have not been entirely identified but are known to be related to a susceptible human genome. microbial pathogens have been identified as critical causes of specific chronic inflammatory conditions or malignancies. the best-characterized example of a bacterial contribution to cancer is H. pylori infection, which is well established as a major risk factor for gastritis leading to gastric cancer. pks-positive strains are prevalently present in biopsy specimens of patients with intestinal cancers. they induce DNA double-strand breaks in intestinal cells and trigger chromosomal instability, gene mutations, and cell transformation. hCEACAMs, receptors of Afa/Dr adhesins, are known to be implicated in carcinogenesis. UPEC-induced cell exfoliation induces upregulation of urothelial turnover. UPEC-induced cell exfoliation induces upregulation of urothelial turnover. it has been postulated that it may play a role in bladder cancer."}
