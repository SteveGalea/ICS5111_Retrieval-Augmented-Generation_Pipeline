{"summary": "arenaviruses are enveloped negative-sense RNA viruses with a bisegmented genome composed of the L (large; ca. 7.3 kb) and S (small; ca. 3.5 kb) segments. the L segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein precursor complex (GPC) and the L segment encodes the L RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the matrix RING-finger protein (Z) (1, INNATE AND CELLULAR IMMUNE RESPONSES DURING VIRAL INFECTIONS An important line of defense against intracellular pathogens, such as viruses, is the innate immune system. the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) consist of the three main protein families retinoic acid-inducible gene RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are IFN-/ or IFN-/ receptor knockout mice fail to control arenavirus infections, which result in systemic viral infections with more severe and lethal pathological phenotypes than in wild-type mice. IFN-/ or IFN-/ receptor knockout mice fail to control arenavirus infections, which result in systemic viral infections with more severe and lethal pathological phenotypes. LCMV (clone 13) can maintain persistent infection, which depends on a low level of type I IFN signaling that induces the anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL-10) IL-10 can interfere with the NF-B pathway, downregulate cytokines secreted by helper T cells (Th1), decrease major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation. inhibition of innate immune pathways during arenavirus infections can interfere with the function of plasmacytoid the type I IFN released mainly by pDCs can subsequently affect the activation and maturation of B and T cells (41, 42) the activation of pDCs also increases the presentation of MHC class I and II peptides and leads to the production of costimulatory molecules and inflammatory cytokines. studies of human survivors indicate a general immunosuppression characterized by low levels of type I IFN. in vitro and in vivo studies suggest NW arenavirus infections with JUNV or Machupo virus trigger an initial IFN response similar to that of LASV (54). but the response during JUNV infections shifts toward a proinflammatory response mediated mainly by IFN- and TNF- (55, 56) NP binds and encapsidates viral genomic RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid (63) the nucleocapsid forms a complex with the viral polymerase (L protein), called the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex, to synthesize viral genomic RNAs during viral replication and to transcribe viral mRNAs. NP also plays important roles in proper assembly and budding of progeny virions NP is also capable of blocking NF-B activation, a pathway that is thought to be activated by arenavirus glycoprotein GP via the toll-like receptors (TLRs) NP is comprised of two domains separated by a flexible linker region (68, 69), contributing to viral genomic-RNA synthesis and encapsidation (68, 69). double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are generated during viral replication in the cytoplasm. these dsRNAs serve as PAMPs for ligands such as retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), which in turn would induce an antiviral signaling cascade. the small matrix Z protein possesses a central RING domain flanked by highly flexible N- and C-terminal extensions. the immunosuppressive function of the Z protein N-terminal domain has been shown to be via direct binding to the CARD domains of RIG-I and MDA5. defect in the ability of NP to block nuclear translocation of IRF3. NP can also block the NF-B pathway. smallest arenaviral protein is the zinc finger protein (Z), encoded on RNA segment. arenaviral nucleoprotein is the most abundantly expressed viral protein in infected cells (62) NP binds and encapsidates viral genomic RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid. NP also plays important roles in the proper assembly and budding of progeny virions from infected cells. the IFN induction pathway is an important viral-defense pathway against arenaviruses. NP can be blocked by arenavirus Z protein when it binds directly to RIG-I and MDA-5 and prevents activation of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. NP is also capable of blocking NF-B activation, a pathway that is thought to be activated by arenavirus glycoprotein GP via the toll-like receptors. al domain is comprised of a highly conserved 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease of the DEDDh family (68, 69) members of this exonuclease family are often involved in various nucleic acid repair or proof-reading mechanisms (70, 71), but for arenavirus NP, this exoribonuclease activity appears to mediate type I IFN suppression (66, 72, 73) the DIEGR motif involved in the possible IKK binding and the catalytic site of the exoribonuclease form a single positively charged binding pocket (red) the C terminus of NP is involved in two known immune evasion mechanisms, namely, the reduction of PAMP RNA species through its exoribonuclease function. LCMV and Pichinde virus NPs have also been shown to interact directly with the IB kinase (72, 77) this interaction disrupts the binding of IKK and the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to form a heterodimer, which results in the failure of IRF3 phosphorylation. NP can also block the NF-B pathway (Fig. 1). eukaryotic elongation factor 4E (eIF4E) or components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) Z interacts with the viral L protein to \u201clock\u201d the protein onto the genome (81), as well as serving as a main component for viral budding by oligomerizing and forming the viral matrix of progeny virus particles (79). viruses encode IFN antagonists that can effectively suppress type I IFN expression (89, 94\u201396), leading to high viral titers. the inhibition of different IFN pathways seems to be a common theme among all viruses to successfully establish infections. VP35 interferes with the RIG-I cofactor known as the protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT) to further aid the inhibitory effect. other viruses target this important induction step to prevent an innate immune response by other means. deNV uses several of its proteins to antagonize IFN signaling. this virus downregulates the phosphorylation of Jak1, Tyk2, and STAT1. this is preventing any form of STAT-mediated downstream signaling in this important antiviral pathway. the role of and interaction with IRF7 was implicated as important (25) but remains less clear. future research will require extending the knowledge about potential interactions between arenaviral proteins and the IFN signaling pathway."}
