{"summary": "canine coronavirus (CCV) is an enveloped RNA virus with a positive-sense single-stranded genome of 2732 kb in length. this virus belongs to group I of the Coronaviridae family that includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and human coronavirus 229E. the newly discovered FCoV-like CCV strain was different from typical CCV strains, and more closely related to FCoV strains than CCV strains. one study found some FCoV-like CCV strains are more virulent than typical CCV strains. the target sequence for amplification was located in a segment of the gene encoding the transmembrane protein M of CCV. cDNA was synthesized with the commercial kit (Accupower RT PreMix; Bioneer, Korea) as instructed by the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized with the commercial kit (Accupower RT PreMix; Bioneer, Korea) deduced amino acid sequences of the M gene from 22 Korean CCV strains were determined and compared to those for 10 reference coronaviruses obtained from GenBank. the target sequence for amplification was located in a segment of the gene encoding the transmembrane protein M of CCV. cDNA was synthesized with the commercial kit (Accupower RT PreMix; Bioneer, Korea) as instructed by the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized with the commercial kit (Accupower RT PreMix; Bioneer, Korea) the amplicons were purified with a commercial kit (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit; Qiagen) results analysis of the M gene revealed that the nucleotide sequences of the 22 Korean strains had an 87.2 to 100% homology. the Korean strains had an 86.3% to 98.3% sequence homology with the CCV type II reference strains. aPercent nucleotide similarity is indicated in the upper right triangle. analysis of the M gene deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the Korean strains had a 90.8% to 100% similarity. the Korean strains showed an 89.1% to 99.2% sequence homology with the CCV type II reference strains. the 22 Korean strains belonged to four genetic clusters based on the description of the reference CCV strains of Table 2. bAmino acids identical to those in the reference strain are indicated by dashes. twenty-two CCV strains from domestic dogs with enteritis in Korea were evaluated. these isolates shared high nucleotide and amino acid. homologies indicated that most of the Korean strains were more closely related to the CCV type II strain than the FCoV-like CCV strain. recombination of coronaviruses, such as CCV and FCoV, often occurs under natural conditions. there are FCoV-like CCV strains in Korea similar to those described by Pratelli et al. [22,26,27] in Italy. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase errors have the potential to rapidly adjust to negative pressures such as those presented by the immune system. this hypothesis could explain the stable and identical substitutions observed in the nucleotide sequences of the M gene from Korean CCV strains."}
