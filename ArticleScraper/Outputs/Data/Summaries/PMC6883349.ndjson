{"summary": "antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine is education of pet owners about indications for and dosing regimens of antimicrobials. one component of antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine is education of pet owners about indications for and dosing regimens of antimicrobials. posters for use in veterinary practice to promote judicious use of antimicrobials. posters include the American Veterinary Medical Association and the world organization for animal health. a poster with an antimicrobial stewardship message was placed in every exam room of the clinics. survey led to a picture of the posters with text blurred out so as to be unreadable. participants were asked if they retained its message and if they could paraphrase it in their own words. participants were invited within 24 h to complete a follow-up online survey. the second survey asked participants to define antibiotic resistance in their own words. a definition score was generated for the following components of the definition. resistance is associated with antibiotic use (1 point), for a total possible of 3 points. a poster with antimicrobial stewardship message related to upper respiratory infections in dogs and cats was placed in every exam room of the clinics. the poster stated: \"Cough. Snort. Sniffle. Sneeze. Careful with antibiotics, please. You want your pet to feel better. you want your pet to feel better. veterinarians from the clinics were told they could discuss the topic with pet owners if they brought it up. Upon checking out of their appointment, pet owners were provided a postcard inviting them to participate in a study. amazon gift cards ($10 for the first 50 participants, $5 for subsequent participants) were offered as incentives for participating in the study. participants could answer \u201cTrue,\u201d \u201cFalse\u201d or \u201cDon't know\u201d for these statements. a knowledge score was generated from these questions. a definition score was generated for the following components of the definition. s that were associated or trending to be associated with the outcome on bivariable analysis were added in a stepwise fashion to a mixed effect linear regression model. variables involved in confounding the association between the primary outcome and the factor of interest were added in a stepwise fashion. all analyses were conducted with Stata 15 (StataCorp, State College TX), with two-sided tests of hypotheses and a p 0.05 as the criterion for statistical significance. 58 participants (n = 52%) did not indicate which clinic they attended. the remaining 58 participants (n = 52%) did not indicate which clinic they attended. the clinics that contributed most participants had either one or no other posters in their waiting rooms. only one person (2.0%) who noticed the poster stated that they discussed the topic of the poster with their veterinarian. most (32/51, 62.8%) of the people who noticed the poster said they did not remember what the message of the poster was, while 6 (11.8%) said they did remember. poster retention score out of 2 points Participants who claimed to have remembered the message of the poster (n = 6) \"I actually saw the one with the dog and it was advising you to use precaution with antibiotics\" \"Be careful with giving antibiotics for cold and flu like symptoms as the viruses can become immune\" antimicrobial resistance was 1.38 (1.03) out of 3 possible points, and this value was similar for participants who noticed and did not notice the poster (p = 0.87, p 0.001). the antibiotic knowledge score was significantly associated with the definition score ( = 0.87, p 0.001). this number represents the participants who completed both the first and second survey and is therefore smaller than the total number of study participants (n = 111) on univariable analysis, education and prior viewing of the poster were significantly associated with the knowledge score. the poster was helpful for herself in reminding her to discuss the topic of antimicrobial resistance with her clients when the situation came up. only two general-practice veterinarians stated that any clients discussed the poster with them. 111 people participated in the study, including 52 from the low-cost clinics and 59 from the general practices. none of the veterinary personnel noted a difference in the frequency with which this type of pressure occurred while the poster was up. one veterinarian said that clients paid more attention to posters with lists. 58 participants (n = 52%) did not indicate which clinic they attended. sixty-three participants (67.7%) were female. only one person (2.0%) who noticed the poster stated that they discussed the topic of the poster with their veterinarian. most (32/51, 62.8%) of the people who noticed the poster said they did not remember what the message of the poster was, while 6 (11.8%) said they did remember and 13 said they \u201csort of\u201d remembered the message of the poster. 111 participants answered all of the True/False questions, but only 83 participants provided a definition of antibiotic resistance. most people answered the true/false questions correctly. the antibiotic knowledge score was significantly associated with the definition score (p = 0.87, p 0.001) the definition score was significantly associated with the definition score ( = 0.87, p 0.001). the antibiotic knowledge score was significantly associated with the definition score ( = 0.87, p 0.001). 13 (33.3) Mean (SD) knowledge score 1.96 (1.00) 1.96 (1.06) 1.95 (0.94) 0.955 Mean (SD) antibiotic resistance definition score (out of 2 points) 1.38 (1.0) 1.35 (1.1) 1.42 (0.94) 0.693 a This number represents the participants who fully completed both the first and second survey. one general practice veterinarian said: \"most people just don't look at posters now. Probably because people have phones, right\" one of the veterinarians mentioned that the poster was helpful for herself in reminding her to discuss the topic of antimicrobial resistance with her clients. a poster placed in the exam rooms of veterinary clinics was not very effective in conveying a message of antimicrobial stewardship. a poster placed in the exam rooms of veterinary clinics was not very effective in conveying a message of antimicrobial stewardship. none of the veterinary personnel noted a difference in the frequency with which this type of pressure occurred. the ultimate goal of educational visual material such as posters is to inform or change behavior. a presumed desired outcome of this poster and other posters with a similar message is to decrease the incidence of clients requesting antibiotics or increase pet owners' acceptance of a veterinarian's decision not to prescribe antibiotics when they are not necessary. univariable analysis but not on multivariable analysis is likely due to the fact that only 83 participants completed both surveys and provided a definition of antibiotic resistance. the sample size for the multivariable analysis was smaller than the sample size for the univariable analysis. it is reasonable to conclude that if the poster was ineffective in increasing knowledge of pet owners with regards to judicious use of antibiotics, it is unlikely that the poster could change behavior. the lack of an association between viewing of the poster and improved antibiotic knowledge score is consistent with findings in human medicine that antimicrobial stewardship interventions involving patient or prescriber education are limited in their effectiveness. the guidelines of the infectious Disease Society of America for implementing antimicrobial stewardship programs in human settings include a recommendation against solely relying on didactic, passive education as an approach to improving antimicrobial use. alse questions to assess a participant's knowledge of antibiotic resistance could result in artificially high scores if people guessed the answers correctly. fifth, the posters were up during spring and summer (March-August), whereas respiratory disease in dogs and cats tends to occur in the fall and winter (31, 32). if interval between visit and completion of survey was large, recall of poster's message could have been affected. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
