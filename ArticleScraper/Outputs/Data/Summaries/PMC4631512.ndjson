{"summary": "control of the spread of influenza can be achieved through various strategies including vaccination, the use of drug therapy, hand washing and social distancing. Vaccines and drug therapies, however, may be ineffective (e.g. resistance to antivirals) or unavailable (i.e. pending development of a new vaccine) mass media campaigns can provide information on current and effective vaccination, drug therapy and social distancing measures. sensitivity to disease reports may diminsh with time, and social distancing practices may be relaxed. to better control infectious diseases a better understanding of the effects of mass media on the uptake and waning of social distancing practices is needed. models that include a mass media compartment should be considered [33] explicity includes a mass media compartment, allowing a sensitivity analysis over biological assumptions that determine the function f(S, E, I, R) g(M)S models the interaction that individuals have with media that can change their behaviour, g(M)S models the interaction that individuals have with media that can change their behaviour. social distancing levels included in the model are chosen to reflect different degrees of protection that healthy behaviour change can provide. we include extremes\u2014no protection and total protection/isolation, and a moderate protection level. the uptake of social distancing behaviours, and vaccination are both assumed to be affected by mass media reports [3, 5, 6, 11] q 2 S 2 - 2 S 2 M - d S 2 V = S M + 1 S 1 M + 2 S 2 M - d V E = S I + 1 S 1 I - E - d E I = E - I - d I R = E - 1 M. susceptible individuals in the social distancing class S 1 can also be infected. an increase in media reports can be modelled using various different assumptions. it is assumed that media reports are proportional to a fraction of incoming infectious cases E that are symptomatic and/or reported to a doctor [36]. the effects of mass media on social distancing behaviours can wane ( 1) [14, 15, 37, 38]. the ABMC simulation moves forward in time using event times: the next time that an individual changes state within the system. table 1 lists the means of the lifetime distributions, corresponding to the parameters of Eq (3). 0.001 0.06 day1 Exponential distribution, mean 1 q assumed Fraction of infectious cases reported 0.01 Exponential distribution, mean 1 1 calculated Fig 1 shows the different states that an individual can progress through during an epidemic. the attributes associated with each individual in each model class are listed in Table 1. the solid line on Fig 2 shows an exponential curve fit to the data points. it is assumed that the media waning rate 1 is equal to the decay rate of this exponential curve fit. the equation is f(t) = 0.09911 exp 0.0469t. isolated individuals (S 2) are fully isolated and cannot be infected, but can be vaccinated. vaccination provides more protection than any level of social distancing. exposed individuals are produced via infection of susceptible individuals S and S 1 and can become infectious (). an increase in media reports can be modelled using various different assumptions. it is assumed that media reports are proportional to a fraction of incoming infectious cases E that are symptomatic and/or reported to a doctor [36]. The relaxation of social distancing behaviours q 1 and q 2 also reflect this behaviour. agent-based Monte Carlo (ABMC) simulation is deterministic and cannot be used to study variability in infection measurements. the ABMC simulation models the population at the level of individual agents where each agent contains characteristics associated with infection status, birth, death and social distancing measures. 0.004 day1 Exponential distribution, mean 1 i assumed i Vaccination rate from i th socially distanced 105 0.002 day1 Exponential distribution, mean 1 i [40] q i Relaxation rate of social distancing practices in S i 0.001 0.06 day1 Exponential distribution, mean 1 1 Media waning rate 0.015 day1 Exponential distribution, mean 1 1 calculated Fig 1 shows the different states that an individual can progress Fig 2 shows data extracted from a study on the \u2018newsworthiness\u2019 of influenza H1N1. it is assumed that the media waning rate 1 is equal to the decay rate of this exponential curve fit. an exponential curve is fit to the data to determine a media fatigue waning rate (red) the basic reproductive ratio, R 0, is defined as the number of new infectious individuals produced by one infectious individual when introduced into a fully susceptible population. if R 0 1, a disease will die out, but if R 0 > 1, the pathogen will spread in the population. translation to short term epidemics can be ignored since the total number of births and deaths over the course of the epidemic is very small. in the following sections it is assumed that = 0 and d = 0. The DFE then becomes E 0 = ( N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ) and R 0 = N where N is the total population size. Numerical simulations We considered various scenarios with and without vaccination, social distancing and waning behaviour. each row has results for the ABMC for 100 simulations (mean and standard error) 6066.50 N/A 40.10 16.77 719.57 234.43 135.98 83.03 6061.20 81.77 N/A 41.60 9.81 722.60 17.34 187.50 64.90 5838.23 471.67 N/A (c) 35.50 566.38 112.67 4183.60 3983.40 36.80 4.54 663.34 204.32 113.20 8.77 4313.20 321.60 38 this may be due to the fact that individuals can move between social distancing classes many times during the epidemic. this may be due to the fact that individuals can move between social distancing classes many times during the epidemic. this will affect public health preparedness strategies. Fig 5 shows the results of Eq (3) when social distancing and waning behaviour are included in the model. a constant level equal to the last collected data point (second row), a decay after the final data point (third row), and setting the number of reports to zero at the declared end of the pandemic (week 47 [44]. the pandemics do not have a vaccine available, in the right panel there is a vaccine available for the second wave of the pandemic. in the left panel of this figure the pandemics do not have a vaccine available. a further simulation considering the same population size and all media reports in all languages results in a single small wave of infection. this is an intuitive result since the model assumes that if there are more media reports, more individuals will uptake social distancing practices and vaccination. however, if we increase the population size, two peaks of infection will result. the disease free equilibrium E 0 is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 1 and unstable if R 0 > 1. infected equilibrium Eq (3) has at least one infected equilibrium. the total number of births and deaths over the course of the epidemic is very small. the DFE then becomes E 0 = ( N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ) and R 0 = N where N is the total population size. SS1EIRM, including vaccination of S and S 1; SS1S2VEIRM, extending to include media reports; e) SS1S2VEIRMw, extending to include media waning. public health programs should be implemented to consider time intervals of 10\u201350 days for peak infections, and 20\u2013160 days for the end of the epidemic. this may be due to the fact that individuals can move between social distancing classes many times during the epidemic, providing greater uncertainty in these outcomes of the epidemic. sensitivity analysis results show that to minimize the effect of the epidemic, public health programs should strive to (1) reduce transmission (effectively reducing R 0), (2) effectively use drug therapies that can shorten the infectious period (effectively decreasing and increasing ). (4) provide educational programs throughout an epidemic that will help minimize the waning of positive social distancing practices 1. vaccination rate for each scenario is between 25% to 40% of the population. for all cases, two waves of the pandemic occur, with the magnitude of the peaks varying by the model assumptions. Fig 5 demonstrates that for all cases, two waves of the pandemic occur. a further simulation considering the same population size and all media reports in all languages results in a single small wave of infection. this is an intuitive result since the model assumes that if there are more media reports, more individuals will uptake social distancing practices and vaccination. if we increase the population size, which better represents a population that is affected by media reports in all languages tracked by GPHIN, two peaks of infection will result. an agent-based Monte Carlo simulation based on Eq (3) was employed to study the variability in key epidemic measurements that must be considered in public health policies and planning. results showed that the expected outcome of the simulations is quantitatively similar to the solution of deterministic system of ordinary differential equations of Eq (3). this in turn will affect public health resources and planning. mass media reports and waning behaviour can also contribute to the double peak behaviour. this would lead to a study of the optimal use of media reporting in public health [32, 49] the disease free equilibrium E0 Theorem 0.1 The disease free equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically stable if R0 1 and unstable if R0 > 1. the Jacobian matrix for model Eq (3) evaluated at the DFE E 0 is where S 0 = /d. 0 we obtain d + d 2 + d 2 + d 3 1 d ( + d ) 1 R 0 1. (11) Thus, E 0 is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 1. we now derive a system of stochastic differential equations for the standard SEIR model. i, j, k, l take on values of + 1, 1 or 0, because only one change occurs in sufficiently small t, thus o(t) is included in the definition of the infinitesimal transition probabilities. the probabilities for each change in state are straightforward to describe from an SEIR model. from the equations for the infinitesimal transition probability, we can derive the forward Kolmogorov differential equations. from the forward Kolmogorov differential equation we derive a probability generating function (pgf), a moment generating function (mgf) the forward Kolmogorov differential equation from Eq (14) represents the rate of change of the transitions from state to state. the first step is to derive a discrete equation from Eq (14) for sufficiently small t for p i,j,k,l(t + t) p i, j, k, l ( t + t ) = p i - 1, j, k, l ( t ) t + p i,j,k,l(t) represents the probability of a susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered population of size i, j, k, and l. p i,j,k,l(t) represents the probability of a susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered population. S i E j I k R l + d ( l + 1 ) p i, j, k, l + 1. take sum over (i, j, k, l) and arrive at the forward Kolmogorov differential equation. d t = p i, j, k, l ( t ) d t = p i - 1, j, k, l ( t ) S i E j I k R l + ( i + 1 ) k p i + 1, j - 1, k, l ( t ) S i E j I k R l + ( j + 1 ) p S i E j I k R l - d i p i, j, k, l ( t ) S i E j I k R l - d j p i, j, k, l ( t ) S i E j I k R l - d j p i, j, k, l ( t ) S i E from the probability generating function (pgf), take the total derivative of M(,,,, t) to get function Eq (19) take the derivative of Eq (19) with respect to the variable that corresponds to the moment required for the differential equation. d E [ S ], (20) depending on the higher order moment E[SI] = E[S]E[I] + cov(S, I) = 0, the ordinary differential equation is returned and the state variables of the system are independent. d t = E [ I ] - E [ I I ] - 2 d E [ S I ] + E [ S E ] - E [ S I ] - E [ I ] - d E [ the solution of Eq (22) is almost identical to the solution of Eq (3). the solution of Eq (22) is almost identical to the solution of Eq (3). disease free equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically stable if R0 1 and unstable if R0 > 1.

E[SI] = E[S]E[I] + cov(S, I) = 0, the ordinary differential equation is returned and the state variables of the system are independent. it is obvious that this equation contains the third order moment. the solution of Eq (22) is almost identical to the solution of Eq (3). therefore, for the purposes of this study we move forward considering Eq (3) only."}
