{"summary": "a group from the AABB published a Supplement to Transfusion that reviewed emerging infectious disease agents that pose a real or theoretical threat to transfusion safety. the necessary attributes for transfusion transmission were outlined including: presence of the agent in blood during the donor's asymptomatic phase, survival/persistence in blood during processing/storage. without these attributes, agents are not considered as a transfusion-transmission threat and were excluded. six new FSs (yellow fever viruses, miscellaneous arboviruses, XMRV, human parvoviruses/bocaviruses other than B19, and most recently the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) were added and 14 existing FSs updated. the list of EID agents is not, and can never be, complete due to the nature of emergence. the recognition of newly described infectious disease agents will continue to place demands on the collectors of blood worldwide to ensure safety. the recognition of newly described infectious disease agents will continue to place demands on the collectors of blood to ensure safety. the AABB group identified 68 EID agents of concern to blood safety. each agent had enough evidence/likelihood of transfusion transmission. agents were prioritized relative to their scientific/epidemiologic threat. vCJD prion, dengue viruses and the obligate red-cell parasite that causes babesiosis (B. microti and related Babesia) several of the agents, including the agent of Lyme disease, have never been documented to be transfusion-transmitted. six new Fact Sheets were released. the AABB EID group is now developing a \u2018toolkit\u2019 containing the necessary \u2018tools\u2019 starting with links to EID monitoring sites (horizon scanning), risk assessment tools, a flow diagram to follow as one proceeds to determine whether intervention development and implementation are required. each country or region of the world needs to decide their own priority list of infectious agents that may represent a threat to transfused recipients. countries, especially those in the developing world where EID agents have originated in the past such as China, sub- agents internationally recognized as potential or existing threats to blood safety include MERS-CoV, dengue viruses, chikungunya virus and HEV. the agent is a betacoronavirus first described in September 2012 from a patient in Saudi Arabia. it is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) that resulted in over 8000 infections in 17 countries (including Macau and Hong Kong) with a 10% fatality rate. a cluster of 21 human cases occurred associated with four hospitals in eastern saudi arabia that was ultimately sourced to one community-acquired case [11] there is no evidence of transfusion transmission. dengue viruses include four genetically related viruses (65% genetic homology between the four) classified as 'arboviruses' the dengue cycle involves humans and mosquitoes (primarily A. aegypti) but sylvatic cycles also occur. the majority of clinical cases are classified as 'fever' defined by WHO as fever. it is unclear why the number of transfusion transmissions is not higher in endemic areas considering the magnitude of dengue outbreaks and high viral loads associated with infected donors. possible theories include absence of effective hemovigilance in many of the countries impacted by dengue. the number of interventions put into place to prevent theoretic transfusion transmission. these included suspension of blood collections in areas where risk was estimated to be higher than the risk from hepatitis B virus transfusion transmission. a case-control study during a chikungunya outbreak in 2009 investigated the development of symptoms and viremia. hepatitis E virus is globally the most common cause of acute hepatitis. there is one serotype but four genotypes with differing geographic distribution, epidemiology and clinical features. genomes 1 and 2 are most commonly associated with large, explosive waterborne outbreaks. RNA from genotype 3 can be recovered from Dutch blood donors at rates of as high as 1:3000. in the same study, IgG antibody prevalence was 27%, and 35% for IgM, with increasing prevalence with age. even higher IgG seroprevalence rates of 525% have been documented in southwest France. commercial tests are being developed to screen plasma for HEV RNA. commercial tests are being developed to screen plasma for HEV RNA. the author declares no conflict of interests."}
