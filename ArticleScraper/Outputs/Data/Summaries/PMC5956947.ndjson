{"summary": "despite this impressive economic development, this growth exists side by side with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crises. the development of health non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is largely limited. external factor was identified to verify the argument, namely (1) reduction of international financial commitments, (2) fragmentation of HIV/AIDS-focused NGO community in china. the fragmentation of the HIV/AIDS-focused NGO community would further hinder the development, preventing from NGOs with the same interest forming alliances to call for changes in current political environment."}
