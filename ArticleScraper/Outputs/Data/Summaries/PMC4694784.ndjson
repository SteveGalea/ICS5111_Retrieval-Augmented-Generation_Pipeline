{"summary": "inTRODUCTION BASIGIN/CD147 (BSG-2) is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulins (Ig) super family. it is composed of two extracellular domains, a single membrane spanning segment followed by an intracellular domain. at the physiological level, it plays a role in embryonic development (spermatogenesis, vision and smell), adhesion and the inflammatory processes. the mechanism by which BASIGIN mediates these actions is still unclear. a large number of observations suggest that BASIGIN works through its first extracellular Ig-like domain. the presence of CAFs is often associated with bad clinical prognosis. r of MMPs is an attractive and interesting hypothesis in the context of tumour microenvironment and metastasis. the model placing BASIGIN at the centre of MMPs induction remains hypothetical. we genetically disrupted BASIGIN in three human tumour cell lines. 174T BSG/ cl.18, U87 BSG/ cl.8 and cl.39 and A549 BSG/ cl.153 caused the total loss of the two forms of the protein (highly glycosylated and low non mature molecular weight) in the three cell lines. clonogenicity and growth rate analysis of LS174T, U87, and A549 wt versus BSG/ cells showed that BASIGIN disruption two ZFN were used to generate BSG/ cell lines. ZFN1 targeted the exon 2 encoding peptide signal. ARD1 was used as loading control. cells tested, MMP2 expression in extracellular medium varies between tumour cell lines. LS174T wt or LS/ cells were grown in 2% FBS media alone (a, b) or in co-culture with either NHF or with MEF. activities in CM of LS174T wt vs BSG/ cells cultured alone, or co-cultured with MEF wt. F. and G. Quantification of MMP2/MMP9 activities in CM of U87 wt vs BSG/ cells cultured alone. results were normalized relative to protein quantity. cells with fibroblasts does not significantly change MMP2 and MMP9 expression in extracellular medium. co-cultures of LS174T with either NHF (Figure 2A, lane c and Figure 2B\u20132C) or MEF (Figure 2A, lanes a, i, j and Figure 2B\u20132E) did not significantly produce more MMP2 and MMP9 than tumour cells or fibroblasts cultured alone. HF by conditioned media (CM) from tumour cells can acquire a specific CAF activated phenotype. this can result in the expression of new markers, such as alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA), the activation of TGF/SMAD signalling pathways and acquisition of new properties, such as matrix remodelling [24, 25]. conditioned media from tumour cells does not significantly change MMP2 and MMP9 expression in extracellular medium. conditioned media from LS174T or u87 cells have no significant effect on MMP2 production by stimulated NHF either by direct stimulation (Figure 5A lanes a, b, d and 5B), or by delayed action. C. Zymogel analysis of MMP2/MMP9 activities in CM harvested after 48h of cell culture, washed and cultured in fresh 2% FBS media during an additional 48h. genetic disruption of BASIGIN does not significantly affect MMP2 and MMP9 production by tumour and fibroblastic cells. the invalidation of BASIGIN does not affect MMPs production when tumour cells were co-cultured with NHF (Figure 2A, lanes c, d, Figure 3A lanes d, e, f and Figure 2B\u20132C, 3B-3C), with MEF wt (Figure 2A lanes e, f, Figure 3A lanes g, h, i and Figure 2D\u20132E, 3D-3E) wt cells expressed a significant level of MMP2 and MMP9 mRNAs. levels of MMP3, MMP11, MMP13 and MMP14 mRNAs are too low in LS174T cells to be detected. the invalidation of the BASIGIN gene does not significantly affect MMP2, MMP9, MMP3, MMP11 and MMP14 expression at intracellular level in any of the cells tested. clonogenicity and growth rate analysis of LS174T, U87, and A549 wt versus BSG/ cells showed that BASIGIN disruption had moderate if any effect on clonal growth [16]. thus we isolated independent BSG-null clones by targeting exon 7 of the BSG gene. this exon contains the site previously chosen for shRNA and is common to all BASIGIN spliced isoforms [29] two mRNA sequences were used to generate BSG/ cell lines. ZFN1 targeted the exon 2 encoding peptide signal and common to BSG-1 and BSG-2. ARD1 was used as loading control. LS174T wt or LS/ cells were grown in 2% FBS media alone (a, b) or in co-culture with either NHF (c, d) or with MEF (wt or BSG/ cells refer to as MEF and MEF/) a. Zymogel analysis of MMP2/MMP9 activities in CM harvested after 48h of culture. U87 wt or BSG/ cells were grown in 2% FBS media alone (a, b, c) or in co-culture with either NHF (d, e, f) or with MEF (wt or BSG/ cells) co-cultures of LS174T with either NHF (Figure 2A, lane c and Figure 2B\u20132C) or MEF (Figure 2A, lanes a, i, j and Figure 2B\u20132E) did not significantly produce more MMP2 and MMP9 than tumour cells or fibroblasts cultured alone (Figure 2A, lanes a, i, j and Figure 2B\u20132E) conditioned media from LS174T and U87 tumour cells are able to activate stimulated NHF in vitro. NHF stimulated by CM from LS174T seems to have acquired new matrix remodelling properties represented by their capacity to contract collagen gels. CM from U87 cells does not have any effect (Figure 4B). conditioned media from LS174T or U87 cells have no significant effect on MMP2 production by stimulated NHF either by direct stimulation (Figure 5A lanes a, b, d and 5B) conditioned media from LS174T or U87 cells produce less MMP2 than non-stimulated NHF (Figure 5A lane a compared to lanes b, c d, e and Figure 5B). LS174T (Figure 1C lanes d, e, Figure 2A lanes a, b, and Figure 2B\u20132C), U87 (Figure 1C lanes h, i, Figure 3A lanes a, b, c and Figure 3B\u20133C), and A549 (Figure 1C lanes f, g) tumour cells. invalidation of BASIGIN does not affect MMPs production when tumour cells were co-cultured with genetic disruption of BASIGIN does not affect MMP2, MMP9, MMP3, MMP11 and MMP14 gene-expression in tumour cell lines. these MMPs have also been reported to be associated with cancer progression in a BSG-dependent manner. the invalidation of the BASIGIN gene does not affect MMP2, MMP9, MMP3, MMP11 and MMP14 expression at intracellular level in any of the cells tested. it is to be noted that the MMP1 collagenase expression present in NHF (data not shown) was not detectable in tumour cells. ASIGIN is involved in cancer cells through the direct functionality of MCT1 and MCT4. by assuring lactic acid export, BASIGIN indirectly contributes to intracellular pH changes [32\u201334], the rate of glycolysis and tumour growth [14\u201316]. therefore, the question was raised whether the pro-tumour action of BASIGIN is linked to its role in glucose metabolism and bioenergetics. the same results were obtained for intracellular expression of MMPs. the same results were obtained for intracellular expression of fibroblasts. the same results were obtained for intracellular expression of MMPs. the direct link between BASIGIN, tumorigenicity and MMPs is not proven. if BASIGIN has a real effect on MMPs induction in cancer cells, this could be in an indirect way. if BASIGIN has a real effect on MMPs induction, this could be in an indirect way. soluble BASIGIN is involved in cancer progression through its MCTs chaperone function. but it remains to be explained by which mechanism soluble BASIGIN manages to trigger MMPs production by treated cells. hypoxia and hyperglycaemia have been reported to regulate MMPs expression. several publications, including ours, clearly demonstrated that BASIGIN is involved in cancer cells through the direct functionality of MCT1 and MCT4. by assuring lactic acid export, BASIGIN indirectly contributes to intracellular pH changes [32\u201334], the rate of glycolysis and tumour growth [14\u201316] soluble BASIGIN [1, 18, 23, 28] exploited four KO cell lines derived from human and mouse. first, using three human cancer cell lines, we showed that BSG gene disruption did not significantly affect the MMPs production in extracellular media. the same results were obtained for intracellular expression of MMPs by using qPCR analysis. eo box insertion and destruction of the BASIGIN gene function confirmed our results. we pushed the study further by exploring the direct stimulation of fibroblasts with tumour cell-conditioned media. if BASIGIN has a real effect on MMPs induction in cancer cells, this could be in an indirect way. basigin-null mice could be ascribed to failure of MCTs in photoreceptor cells to properly locate in the plasma membrane [36]. it remains to be explained by which mechanism soluble BASIGIN manages to trigger MMPs production by treated cells. LS174T, U87 and A549 BASIGIN expressing cell lines were transfected with the ZFN targeting exon 2 of BSG. negative clones were detected by immunoblotting and only clones disrupted for the two alleles. cells were lysed in 1.5X SDS buffer and protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay. proteins (40 g) were separated on 8% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) s-HCl pH 7.5, 200mM NaCl, 2mM CaCl2, and 1mM MgCl2 buffer for 18h at 37\u00b0C. gels were stained with Coomassie blue and washed in 10% acetic acid and 10% ethanol. real-time qPCR experiments were performed on a \u201cstep one plus\u201d system. each experiment was performed at least three times. differences between groups were considered statistically significant when p 0.05. immunoblotting was performed as previously described. cells were lysed in 1.5X SDS buffer and protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay. antibody against BASIGIN was purchased from R&D systems. gels were incubated in 2.5% triton for 90min, then in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200mM NaCl, 2mM CaCl2 and 1mM MgCl2 buffer for 18h at 37\u00b0C. gels stained with Coomassie blue and washed in 10% acetic acid and 10% ethanol. the relative expression of various MMPs and BSG mRNA was determined by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using TaqMan nucleotide primers probes (Life Technologies, references will be provided upon request) and qPCR master mix buffer."}
