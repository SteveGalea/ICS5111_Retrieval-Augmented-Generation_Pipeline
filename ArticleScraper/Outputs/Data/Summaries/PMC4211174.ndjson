{"summary": "about 130\u2013170 million people worldwide have been infected by hepatitis C virus. hepatocytes represent the major site of viral replication. replication of HCV is present in extrahepatic tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. AT is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, morphologically characterized by a chronic lymphocytes infiltration of thyroid and the presence of circulating autoantibodies. the inflammatory process leads to a follicular destruction; indeed, AT is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in areas of iodine sufficiency. chronic HCV (CHC) infection and Thyroid autoimmunity In a first study, Tran et al. report two cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis associated with chronic active HCV infection. the prevalence of HCV infection in patients with different thyroid disorders has been evaluated by several studies. prevalence of thyroid disorders in 630 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis due to HCV infection was investigated. all patients were free of cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma and were not on interferon treatment. a large study which included 146394 patients infected with HCV confirmed these results showing a significant increase in the risk of thyroiditis in HCV patients [60]. a large study which included 146394 patients infected with HCV confirmed these results showing a significant increase in the risk of thyroiditis in HCV patients. interferon induced thyroiditis (IIT) can be divided into two main groups. former can manifest as HT and GD and sometimes may be related to the production of thyroid autoantibodies without clinical disease. case-control prospective study has been conducted to evaluate thyroid disorders in 93 MC + HCV patients, matched by sex and age (2 years), to 93 patients with CHC without MC and 93 healthy (HCV-negative) controls. the following thyroid autoimmune abnormalities were significantly more frequent in MC + HCV patients than in HCV-negative controls. the presence of a higher risk of AT and hypothyroidism and increased circulating levels of AbTPO, in female gender, the relationship between each cancer and HCV infection was assessed by means of odds ratios (OR) risks were greater for liver cancer (OR = 32.9, 95% CI 16.5\u201365.4, P 0.0001), multiple myeloma (OR = 4.5, 95% CI 1.9\u201310.7, P = 0.0004) and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.9\u20137.4, P = 0.0001) CXCL10 is one of chemokines with C-X-C motif. high levels of CXCL10 are present in patients with AT. high levels of CXCL10 are present in patients with AT. HCV thyroid infection may act by upregulating CXCL10 gene expression and secretion in thyrocytes recruiting Th1 lymphocytes that secrete IFN- and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) these cytokines induce CXCL10 secretion by thyrocytes, thus perpetuating the immune cascade. high CXCL10 level (>mean SD control 1; >167 pg/mL) was present in 7% of control 1, 21% of control 2, 49% of MC, and 78% of MC + AT (P 0.0001) CCL2 was significantly higher in MC and in MC + AT than in control 1 or in control 2 (P 0.01). IL-1 and TNF- were not associated with the presence of AT in MC + HCV patients. 66 HCV+ patients were evaluated and abTPOs were detected in 4/54 (7.4%) of the patients, whereas abTgs were detected in none of the patients (0/48) [38] conflicting results have been reported from earlier studies of patients with CHC, with some supporting an association of HCV infection with AITD. FT3 and FT4 levels were lower in patients with CHC than in all other groups. hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity are more common in patients with CHC, even in the absence of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or interferon treatment. higher risk of AT in female gender and abTPO-positive subjects characterized the pattern of thyroid disorders observed in HCV infection. previous studies showed that female gender is one of the most common risk factors that predict the development of AITD during interferon therapy. the presence of thyroid autoantibodies before the initiation of IFN- therapy is an important risk factor for the development of IIT. there is also an obvious link between female sex, old age, and genetic predisposition with the development of antibodies. the presence of a higher risk of AT and hypothyroidism and increased circulating levels of AbTPO, in female gender, characterized the pattern of thyroid disorders observed in MC + HCV infection. no case was observed in 835 control subjects who were long-term residents of an iodine-deficient area. the prevalence of thyroid cancer was also investigated in a series of unselected 94 MC + HCV patients. the prevalence of thyroid nodules was higher in control subjects than in MC + HCV patients. no case was observed among controls (P = 0.001) IP-10 activates specifically CXCR3 receptor with seven transmembrane domains mainly expressed in T activated lymphocytes, natural-killer cells, macrophages, and B cells [104, 105] high levels of CXCL10 are present in patients with AT, in particular in the presence of hypothyroidism. HCV thyroid infection may act by upregulating CXCL10 gene expression and secretion in thyrocytes recruiting Th1 lymphocytes that secrete IFN- and TNF-. these cytokines induce CXCL10 secretion by thyrocytes, thus perpetuating the immune cascade. IL-1 and TNF- were not associated with the presence of AT in MC + HCV patients. IL-6 was modestly but significantly increased in patients with AT [5, 123\u2013125]."}
