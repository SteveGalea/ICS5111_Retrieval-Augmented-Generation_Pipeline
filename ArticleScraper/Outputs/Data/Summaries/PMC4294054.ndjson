{"summary": "MERS-CoV was first reported in a Saudi Arabian patient in september 2012. as of 23 April 2014, 253 laboratory-confirmed cases and 93 deaths have been reported to the world health organization. there has also been an increase in the number of cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia and the united arab Emirates. there is no consensus among international bodies on the use of surgical masks for the prevention of MERS-CoV transmission. there is no consensus among international bodies on the use of surgical masks when caring for suspects with possible or confirmed MERS-CoV and particulate respirators. a series of questions were posed to a panel of experts consisting of Dr Ling Moi Lin, Professor Paul Anantharajah Tambyah, Professor Seto Wing Hong, Dr Brenda Ang and Dr Joanne Tay. the debate methodology was chaired by Dr Brenda Ang, Senior Consultant, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and Dr Joanne Tay, Deputy Director, Communicable Diseases Division, Ministry of Health, Singapore. the index patient had presented with atypical symptoms, complaining of fever, chills and diarrhoea. after seven days, MERS-CoV was suspected in the index patient. there was only one reported transmission to a fellow patient. used surgical masks, 54.4%, N95 masks and 15.3%, paper masks. recommendation for use of surgical masks may be counterproductive. a properly worn surgical mask is more protective than an inappropriately used N95 mask. phylogenetic and immunologic similarities between SARS and MERS-CoV should not lull us into extrapolating data and experience from SARS in its entirety. there are stark differences in CFRs at the moment, and hence the anxiety level of healthcare workers has been raised. the use of entry temperature screening is controversial, with significant human resource implications and questionable effectiveness. the use of surgical masks during aerosol-generating procedures can be appreciated by extrapolating from the experience with SARS. new viruses with pandemic potential will continue to emerge. recommendations should be evidence-based, not fuel paranoia and anxiety. in another hospital outbreak in eastern Saudi Arabia, there were 23 confirmed cases and 11 probable cases in healthcare facilities in al-Hasa. it was not possible to determine whether the virus was transmitted when the contact was more than one metre away from the case patient. infection control precautions could be extrapolated from the experience with SARS in 2003. MERS-CoV is postulated to be a droplet- and contact-transmissible respiratory virus infection with no sustained person-to-person transmission. a properly worn surgical mask is more protective than an ill-fitted, inappropriately used N95 mask. a good and cost-effective way to prevent its transmission in the healthcare setting is through barrier precautions, which include the use of gloves, gowns and masks. the use of surgical masks alone may not be sufficient. the use of surgical masks alone may not be sufficient. the highest risk of transmission of SARS to healthcare workers was consistently reported during tracheal intubation,(24-27) and during noninvasive ventilation, tracheotomy and manual ventilation before intubation. a systematic review by Jefferson et al in 2010, the use of face masks significantly reduced the spread of respiratory viruses. the spread of MERS-CoV with travellers as potential vectors is most feared. no international or regional consensus on the recommendations for respiratory precautions for MERS-CoV among the various infection control professionals. there have been no cases of MERS-CoV in Singapore. the threat of MERS-CoV spreading to our shores is very real. a recent fatal case of MERS-CoV in a Malaysian."}
