{"summary": "the burden of viral hepatitis has substantially increased over the last two decades. hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are responsible for >90% (96% in 2013) of viral hepatitis-related mortality and disability. hepatitis E virus (HEV) is endemic in many low-income countries. rodent meat is a popular source of protein for human consumption in the mekong delta. the total annual consumption of rat meat in Vietnam is estimated at 3300\u20133600 tonnes. bat faeces collected from bat caves or farms is used as natural fertilizer in Vietnam. 157 bats were trapped at six sites in the provinces of Dong Thap and Quang Ngai in may 2013 using mist nets and harp traps. a total of 157 bats were trapped at six sites in the provinces of Dong Nai (in Cat Tien National Park) and Quang Ngai (in Cat Tien National Park) in may 2013. lysate was applied to an AllPrep DNA spin column for DNA to bind onto the column. lysate was added to the flow-through and RNA and bound to the membrane. extracted nucleic acid was used in screening for the targeted hepatitis viruses. sequenced screening fragments of homologues of hepacivirus, hEV, and pegivirus were 257, 284 and 360 nucleotides. libraries were prepared from total extracted RNA using an Illumina platform. hepacivirus RNA Titer Measurement Two real-time PCR primer sets in the 5\u2032 untranslated region of bamboo rat hepaciviruses and the screening fragment of other rat hepaciviruses were designed using sequences available from this study. the targeted regions were amplified from positive samples and cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector. a total of 435 rats purchased from markets in five of twelve provinces in the Mekong Delta during 2012\u20132015. 82 farmed bamboo rats purchased from a market in dak Lak in 2014\u20132015 were enrolled. a total of 226 trapped rats were also included. acid Extraction RNA was manually extracted from 638 rodent serum samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) samples from 157 bats and 470 rodents were subjected to nucleic acid extraction using the manufacturer. primers targeting a highly conserved region of the polymerase gene of sequences from all known HBV hosts were designed for a nested PCR protocol. length of sequenced screening fragments of homologues of HBV, HEV, HCV, and pegivirus was 257, 284 and 360 nucleotides. hepacivirus RNA Titer Measurement Two real-time PCR primer sets were designed using sequences available from this study. the targeted regions were amplified from positive samples and cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Southampton, UK) maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the MEGA 7.0 software package [33] with 1000 bootstrap resamples. the best-fitting model for each sequence dataset was first determined and used for phylogenetic reconstruction. results 3.1. tus losea 19 1 (5.3) 2 (10.5) 0 Rattus norvegicus 39 0 0 Rattus tanezumi 17 0 1 (5.9) 0 Rhizomys pruinosus 82 35 (42.7) 0 0 Total 470 38 (8.1) 14 (3) 0 3.2. hepacivirus sequences (360 nucleotides) formed two well supported clades. all of 35 sequences from Rhizomys pruinosus shared 84.5\u2013100% pairwise nucleotide identity. three sequences from Rattus losea and Rattus argentiventer grouped in clade 2. slated region sequences of these hepaciviruses contain two miR-122 seed sites (CACUCC), which were located 51 nucleotides from each other. slated region sequences of these hepaciviruses contain two miR-122 seed sites, which were located 51 nucleotides from each other, as consistent with the suspected hepatotropism of the viruses. the 15 HEV sequences (284 nucleotides) from four rodent species were 84.4\u201399.3% identical to each other. the obtained complete genome of rat HEV comprised of 6960 nucleotides excluding the poly A tail. its concatenated ORF1 and ORF2 differed by 6.8% at amino acid level to the closest match. Bat031 consistently showed greatest sequence identity to KY905324 in all 4 ORFs. however, bat033 shared highest identity to KY905328 in the P and S ORFs. Labels for sequences obtained in this study are highlighted in bold. 470 rodents (six species) were screened for pegivirus and human hepatitis B, C, E viruses. hepaciviruses were the most commonly detected (8.1% of rodent samples, from three species), followed by hepatitis E related virus (3% of rodent samples, from four species) hepatitis B related viral DNA was only detectable in three bats (2 species) sample set included 30 bamboo rats and 335 other rats with positive liver samples. hepacivirus RNA was only detected in serum samples of 10 bamboo rats. concentration of RNA was high in both liver tissue. the four Vietnamese bamboo rat hepacivirus genomes were highly similar to each other. they were highly different from the closest sequence (KC815310). the amino acid p-distances of the obtained hepacivirus sequences and KC815310 in the regions 1123\u20131566 and 2536\u20132959 were 30% and 32%, respectively. the trees were drawn to scale; bar, estimated number of substitutions per site. the trees were drawn to scale; bar, estimated number of substitutions per site. 1 and ORF2 differed by 6.8% (Table 2) at amino acid level to the closest match (JX120573) these two sequences belong to a same genotype in the species Orthohepevirus C. Labels for sequences obtained in this study are highlighted in bold. bootstrap support values of 70% are shown. the trees were drawn to scale; bar, estimated number of substitutions per site. the two Vietnamese pegivirus sequences from Rattus tanezumi grouped with a sequence previously reported from Rattus norvegicus. more highly divergent hepacivirus and pegivirus sequences are expected to be discovered from rodents in future studies. absence of bat HEV, hepacivirus, pegivirus, and low detection frequency of bat HBV are consistent with their low prevalence. prevalence of hepacivirus in the farmed bamboo rats was unprecedentedly high (42.7%) the zoonotic potential of the detected viruses is unknown. four rodent species were infected with highly similar HEV homologues. this is a characteristic that may lead to their establishment and emergence in new hosts."}
