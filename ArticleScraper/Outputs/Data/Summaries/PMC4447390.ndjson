{"summary": "eukaryotic (+)RNA viruses replicate their genomes using viral replication complexes (VRCs) plants have evolved ways to hijack host factors and reprogram host cell metabolism for their successful infection. viruses must be evolved to achieve a good balance between hijacking/reprogramming host factors for efficient viral replication. arf1 is a small GTPase that regulates COPI vesicle formation. p27 interferes with host membrane trafficking pathway in plant cells. PA is normally present in small amounts (less than 1% of total phospholipids) but rapidly and transiently accumulates in lipid bilayers in response to different abiotic stresses such as dehydration, salt, and osmotic stress. PA also regulates salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense signaling in plant cells. Nicotiana benthamiana PLD and PLD were interaction partners of p88pol. p27 auxiliary replication protein interacted with PA in vitro. p27-HF and p88pol-HF replication proteins can support RNA2 replication. LC/MS/MS analysis of the isolated proteins excised from gels led to the identification of many host proteins. these proteins included PLD and PLD, and several Arf1 effector proteins, such as coatomer subunits and clathrin heavy chain. both p27 and p88pol-HF were co-immunoprecipitated with p27 and RNA2. p88pol can be detected only when viral RNA replication takes place. p88pol can be detected by immunoblot in N. benthamiana. mCherry-fused p27 (p27-mCherry), p88pol, RNA2 and p19 (panel III and IV) in N. benthamiana leaves by Agrobacterium infiltration. fluorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy at 4 days after infiltration. p88pol-HA was copurified with p88pol-HA and firefly luciferase (FLuc-FLAG) p88pol-HA was not copurified with p88pol-HA. p88pol-HA was copurified with p88pol-HA, but not with FLuc-HA. both PLD and PLD are required for infection of host plants with RCNMV. endogenous transcript levels of NbPLD or NbPLD were downregulated using tobacco rattle virus-based virus-induced gene silencing. the empty TRV vector (TRV:00) was used as a control. newly developed leaves were inoculated with RCNMV RNA1 and RNA2. defense-related genes were not significantly increased in NbPLD- or NbPLD-knockdown plants compared with those in TRV control plants. some genes including PR-1, PR-2, and CYP71D20 genes were even repressed in NbPLD- or NbPLD-knockdown plants. N. benthamiana protoplasts were inoculated with RCNMV RNA1 and RNA2 and incubated with n-butanol or tert-butanol. increasing n-butanol concentration caused a progressive reduction of viral RNA accumulation. n-butanol did not affect the accumulation of rRNA (Fig 4A) the inoculated protoplasts were inoculated with in vitro transcribed RNA2 together with plasmids expressing p27-HA and p88-HA. the inoculated protoplasts were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 18 hours in the presence of progressively increasing concentrations of PA. tert-butanol treatment caused the induction of CYP71D20, ACRE132, and WIPK genes. this may explain weak negative effect of tert-butanol on RNA replication. commercially available soy-derived PA was supplied to RCNMV-inoculated N. benthamiana protoplasts. in this experiment, the accumulation of p27 replication protein was not significantly changed. however, the replication of RNA2 was not enhanced by exogenously supplied PA. this suggests that the threshold of PA requirement for RNA2 replication is lower than that for RNA1. N. benthamiana protoplasts were inoculated with BMV RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3 transcribed in vitro. the inoculated protoplasts were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 18 hours. the inoculated protoplasts were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. PA enhances accumulation of negative-strand RNA1 and the 480-kDa replicase complex in BYL. this may also support a direct role for PA in the enhancement of RdRP activity rather than the formation of the replicase complex. p27 exhibited weak binding to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. neither exogenously supplied PC nor PE promoted RCNMV replication in N. benthamiana protoplasts. lipids were extracted and the amount of PA was analyzed by thin layer chromatography. the spot was scratched out from Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stained TLC plates and subjected to LC/MS analysis. the accumulation levels of NbPLD and NbPLD transcripts in RCNMV-infected plants were about 1.2- and 1.9-fold higher, respectively, than those in control plants. the increase in NbPLD transcripts was insignificant by the Student\u2019s t-test. m/z 391.2 and 413.2 arose from the neutral loss of C18:3. m/z 409.2 and 431.2 arose from the neutral loss as ketene from the each precursor ion. the other ions, m/z 671.5, 693.4, 695.5, and 697.5 also produced the similar MS2 spectra. newly developed leaves were inoculated with RCNMV RNA1 and RNA2 at 18 dai. no morphological defects such as chlorotic and stunted phenotypes were observed at this stage. the numbers below the images represent the relative accumulation levels (means standard error) of viral RNAs (RNA1 and RNA2) using the Image Gauge program (Fuji Film), which were calculated based on three independent experiments. RT-PCR results for the RbcS gene demonstrated that equal amounts of total RNA were used for the RT. the expression levels of these defense-related genes were not significantly increased in NbPLD- or NbPLD-knockdown plants compared with those in TRV control plants. some genes including PR-1, PR-2, and CYP71D20 genes were even repressed in NbPLD- or NbPLD-knockdown plants (S5 Fig) the effects of n-butanol and exogenously supplied PA on RCNMV RNA replication were also observed in tobacco BY-2 protoplasts. the inoculated protoplasts were inoculated with in vitro transcribed RNA1 and RNA2 together with plasmids expressing p27-HA. total RNA was analyzed by northern blotting using ribonucleotide probes that recognize specifically RCNMV RNA1 and RNA2 respectively. the numbers below represent the relative accumulation levels (means standard error) of viral RNAs (RNA1 and RNA2) using the Image Gauge program. exogenously added PA enhanced the accumulation of RNA1 in a dose-dependent manner (up to 6-fold increase by 5 M PA) neither exogenously supplied PC nor PE significantly affected the accumulation of viral RNA in N. benthamiana protoplasts. the negative impact of n-butanol on the accumulation of RNA2 may be the indirect action of this primary alcohol. co-IP experiments showed interactions between BMV replication proteins and NbPLD-FLAG. exogenously added PA did not affect the accumulation of BMV RNA. the numbers below represent the relative accumulation levels (means standard error) of viral RNAs (RNA1 + RNA2 + RNA3 + RNA4) using the Image Gauge program. PA stimulates VRC activity in vitro PA acts as a second messenger in signal transduction during multiple biotic and abiotic stress responses. p27 replication protein binds to PA in vitro. p27 exhibited weak binding to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. p27 fragments did not give PA binding signals, suggesting overall protein conformation may be important for p27\u2013PA binding. p27-FLAG or its variant proteins expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) were purified by agarose beads. RCNMV promotes PA accumulation in planta Next we investigated whether RCNMV infection affects the amount of PA in plant leaves. at 2 dai, lipids were extracted and the amount of PA was analysed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) lipids from leaves expressing empty vector or RCNMV RNA1 plus RNA2 were subjected to thin layer chromatography (TLC) the same samples were again subjected to TLC, and the spot was scratched out from Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) stained TLC plates and subjected to LC/MS analysis. NbPLD- or NbPLD-knockdown plants showed reduced accumulation of PA compared with TRV control plants. this suggests that these PLDs contribute to PA production in N. benthamiana. these results further supported the idea that RCNMV-induced PLDs-derived PA plays an important role in RCNMV replication. the replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus is enhanced by deletion of the PA phosphatase, which converts PA into DAG in yeast. ectopic expression of Arabidopsis PA phosphatase, Pah2 in N. benthamiana results in the inhibition of tombusviruses and RCNMV infection. this is critical for the viral life cycle because PA interacts with p27 auxiliary replication protein (Fig 7) and enhances viral replication through upregulating the activity and/or assembly of the 480-kDa replicase complex. it is likely that PA is involved in RNA replication of many (+)RNA viruses. exogenous PA enhanced the accumulation of newly synthesized viral RNA. exogenous PA binding to proteins promotes the formation and/or stability of protein complexes. PA could promote viral replicase activity and/or assembly directly. RNA1 and RNA2 have differential PA requirements in RNA replication. RNA1 requires a larger amount of PA for maximum efficiency of its replication than that required by RNA2. RNA1 also serves as a template for transcription of subgenomic RNA, which encodes CP. HCV infection stimulates the production of cellular PC, PE, and PI4P and HCV co-opts PI4KIII for replication. the elevated PC has been proposed to serve as a building block for the formation of the viral replication factory [68, 69]. pB1TP3, pB2TP5, and pB3TP8 are full-length cDNA clones of RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3 of the BMV M1 strain. the constructs described previously used in this study include pBICp27 [71], pBICp88 [71], pBICR1R2 [71], pBICp19 [71], pCOLDIp27-FLAG [49], and pC the amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and inserted into the corresponding region of pBICP35. the amplified fragment was digested with AscI and inserted into the corresponding region of pBYL2 [12] the amplified fragment was digested with AscI and inserted into the corresponding region of pBYL2 to generate pBYLNbPLD-FLAG. pBYLAtPAH1-HA A PCR fragment from cDNA derived from N. benthamiana was digested with BamHI and XmaI. pBYLFLuc-HA A PCR fragment from pLUCpA60 [75] was digested with AscI and inserted into the corresponding region of pBYL2. the amplified fragment was digested with AscI and inserted into the corresponding region of pBYL2. the amplified fragment was digested with AscI and inserted into the corresponding region of pBICsGFP. pTVNbPLD A PLD cDNA fragment was amplified from cDNA derived from N. benthamiana (NbPLD) RNA. generated PCR product was then cloned in the antisense orientation into pTV00. plants were grown on commercial soil (Tsuchi-Taro, Sumirin-Nosan-Kogyo Co.
