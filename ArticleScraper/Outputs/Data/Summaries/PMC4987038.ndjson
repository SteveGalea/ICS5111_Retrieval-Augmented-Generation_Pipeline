{"summary": "open science converges on the concept of unlimited access to all aspects of research, to allow anyone to follow, use, and participate in science. open science comprises a growing list of other \u201copens\u201d such as open access, open data, and open source (software is freely available and may be modified and distributed) major public health research funders have implemented policies that encourage or require data sharing. major research sponsors have implemented policies that encourage or require data sharing. the number of articles indexed in PubMed that were freely available online within a year of publication nearly doubled from 2006 to 2010. 80% of peer-reviewed epidemiological modeling studies published during the outbreak used only open data [22]. 80% of peer-reviewed epidemiological modeling studies published during the outbreak used only open data [22]. open science comprises a growing list of other \u201copens,\u201d such as open access. open data (data, including data underlying publications, are freely available online and may be used and shared), and open source (software is freely available and may be modified and distributed) the proportion of articles indexed in PubMed that were freely available online within about a year of publication nearly doubled from 2006 to 2010, from 26% to 50%. a search of the Scopus database in April 2014 estimated that 71% of biomedical research papers published during 2011\u20132013 were freely available online. in 2016, the international committee of medical journal editors (ICMJE) proposed the requirement that authors submitting clinical trial reports to ICMJE member journals make the deidentified individual patient data underlying the study available within 6 months scientists may doubt that sharing data will advance their scholarly stature as much as publishing primary research. fear of granting a competitive advantage to other scientists is a deterrent to sharing in the usual course of scientific research [31]. a review of the Ebola response found that affected countries lacked integrated standards for data collection. in Sierra Leone, inadequate standards allowed a date to refer ambiguously to when data was collected, submitted, or edited. this essential element of effective data sharing cannot be expected to materialize during a crisis. establishing openness as the standard will help build the scientific foundation needed to contain the next outbreak. recent epidemics were surprises\u2014Zika and chikungunya sweeping through the Americas; an Ebola pandemic with more than 10,000 deaths."}
