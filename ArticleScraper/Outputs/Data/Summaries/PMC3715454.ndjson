{"summary": "most cases cause chronic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. current treatment of chronic hepatitis C is based on combination of pegylated interferon-alpha (IFN-) and ribavirin. approximately 50% of treated patients infected with genotype 1 do not respond, or show only a partial or transient response. GL has been considered as a potential treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C. long term administration of GL to patients is effective in suppressing serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological change. a direct anti-viral effect of GL against HCV has never been reported. oxyethyl phosphorylcholine (OPC) (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI), sPLA2IIA Inhibitor I (MERCK, Darmstadt, Germany), anti-Actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were purchased. the solvents were distilled water (GL), ethanol (OPC) and DMSO (sPLA2IIA inhibitor) the cells were harvested 48 hours later to determine intracellular luciferase activity. after 72 hours of treatment with GL, the replicon-transfected cells were harvested for either measurement of luciferase activity (Promega) or HCV RNA titer. the replication efficiency of HCV in each preparation was calculated as the percentage of luciferase activity compared with that of cells subjected to the control treatment. RNA interference The siRNA targeted to PLA2G1B, 5\u2019- GCUGGACAGCUGUAAAUUUTT-3\u2019 and scramble negative control siRNA to PLA2G1B were purchased from Sigma (Tokyo, Japan) cells in a 24-well plate were transfected with siRNA using a triglyceride kit (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, triglyceride Triglyceride (TG) was measured the human hepatoma cell line, Huh7, and its derivative cell line, Huh7.5.1, provided by Francis Chisari (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) were maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418. GL (20-carboxyl-11-oxo-30-norolean-12-en-3-yl-2-O--D-glucopyranosiduronic acid) and cell viability was determined using the Lumipulse Ortho HCV antigen kit. electroporation of HCV RNA lacking E1 and E2 in vitro synthesis of HCV RNA JFH1 lacking E1 and E2 (JFH1delE1E2) was performed. cells were inoculated with cell culture supernatant medium containing HCVcc. after 3 hours of incubation, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS. the infectious titer in the culture medium was determined by quantification using the Lumipulse Ortho HCV antigen kit. immunostained cells were fixed with methanol and immunostained with a mouse monoclonal anti-core antibody and a rabbit polyclonal anti-NS5A antibody [22], followed by an Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. cells were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Epon. HCVcc-infected cells were treated with various concentrations of GL for 72 hours. infectivity was determined by immunostaining. effects of GL on entry of HCVpp and VSVpp were measured. treatment of HCVpp2a with GL resulted in a moderate reduction of luciferase activity in the cells infected with HCVpp, with an EC50 value of 728 M. no cytotoxic effects of GL were observed. medium was replaced with DMEM without GL. the levels of HCV core antigen in the medium were determined at 72 h postinfection (p.i.) there was no significant reduction of HCV production. LDs in un-ifected cells (G) and un-infected cells (H) treated with GL at 500 M were quantified. LD fraction was collected from cell lysates. immunofluorescence staining examined subcellular co-localization of HCV core (Figure 2C) or NS5A (Figure 2D) with LDs in HCVcc-infected cells with or without GL treatment. intensity profiles along the line segments demonstrated that core proteins were tightly colocalized with LDs in the HCVcc-infected cells treated with GL. anti-core antibody stained the membrane around LDs. in nave Huh7 cells, the close association of LDs with ER was rarely observed. GL inhibits release, but not assembly and budding, of infectious HCV particles. treatment with GL effectively decreased the cellular level of PLA2G1B. sPLA2IIA inhibitor I inhibited both HCVpp entry (Figure 3A) and subgenomic replicon replication (Figure 3B) there was no significant cytotoxicity seen after these treatments. infected cells were treated with GL (500 M) with or without OPC (10 M) and intracellular specific infectivity was measured. results are expressed as the mean SD of the percent of the control from four independent experiments. the target causing the anti-HCV effect of GL differs from that of IFN. a combination therapy of IFN with GL could be an effective treatment for HCV. we analyzed the level of albumin, an abundantly secreted protein from hepatocytes, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a component of lipoproteins, in the culture supernatants of Huh7 cells. they were not influenced by GL treatment (Figure S5). effects of GL on entry of HCVpp and VSVpp were determined by measuring the luciferase activity at 72 hours post-transfection. effects of GL on HCV replication were tested by electroporation of HCV RNA lacking E1E2. luciferase activity of GL-treated cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 738 M. no significant reduction of luciferase activity in the cells infected with HCVpp1b and VSVpp. extra- (A) and intracellular specific infectivity (B) were determined. specific infectivity was determined as the ratio of infectious virus titer to HCV core antigen level, as described previously [28] there was no significant cytotoxicity following these treatments. EM using the LAB method of LDs in infected cells treated with GL at 500 M. mouse IgG or anti-core monoclonal antibody was used for primary antibody. we quantified the size of LDs in HCV-infected cells and un-infected cells. we found that GL did not affect the size of LDs in un-infected cells. on the other hand, the size of LDs increased in HCV-infected cells. GL inhibits release, but not assembly and budding, of infectious HCV particles in cells treated with GL. a reduction in infectivity by GL-treatment was observed in fractions 1-7. a reduction in infectivity was observed in fractions 1-7. effects of PLA2 inhibitor on the entry of HCVpp were determined by measuring the luciferase activity at 72 hours post-infection. anti-human CD81 antibody (10 g/ml) was used as a positive control for reducing HCV entry to the cells. 2 inhibitors and extra- and intracellular specific infectivity were measured. OPC slightly decreased specific infectivity of virus in the supernatant and significantly increased specific infectivity of virus in the cell lysate. sPLA2IIA inhibitor I significantly decreased the specific infectivity of virus in both the supernatant and cell lysate. a combination therapy of IFN with GL could be an effective treatment for HCV. the results indicated that a combination therapy of IFN with GL could be an effective treatment for HCV. a combination therapy of IFN with GL could be an effective treatment for HCV. GL effectively inhibits the replication of VZV [10], HSV-1 [9], EBV [15] and HIV [13]. GL has a membrane stabilizing effect [37] and a reduction of membrane fluidity [38], [38]. this is the first report that GL can suppress virus release. we demonstrated the importance of PLA2G1B in HCV release by PLA2G1B inhibitor and siRNA against PLA2G1B. the overexpression of PLA2G1B did not have any effect on HCV release. this result is generally observed in other host factors that involved in HCV lifecycle. menzel et al. showed that inhibition of PLA2G4A produces aberrant HCV particles [45]. the EC50 of GL treatment for intracellular infectivity was 16.5 M. the maximum peripheral concentration of GL in normal patients is 145 M. IFN (10 IU/ml) was used as a positive control. results are expressed as the mean SD of the percent of the control. pISRE-Luc vector contains the firefly luciferase reporter gene. luciferase reporter downstream of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase was used as an internal control. luciferase activities were measured using the dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. results are expressed as the mean SD percent of the controls."}
