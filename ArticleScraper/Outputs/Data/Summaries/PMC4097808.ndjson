{"summary": "the induction of neutralizing antibodies is believed to be responsible for long-term immunity after natural infection and vaccination. effective B cell responses, however, are strongly dependent on the induction of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that contribute to affinity maturation, isotype switching, and immunological memory (4, 5). direct cell-cell interactions of B cells with CD4+ T cells are mediated by the TCR specifically recognizing peptide\u2013MHC-II complexes on the B cell. these peptides are generated from protein antigens that are bound and endocytosed by B cells through their cognate B cell receptors. data obtained with influenza virus and hepatitis B virus (HBV) indicate that B cells can internalize whole virus particles. m is composed of only three structural proteins, the capsid protein C and two membrane-associated proteins, prM/M and E. prM (precursor of M) is a component of immature particles and is proteolytically cleaved during virus maturation, leaving M in the membranes of fully infectious virions. individual CD4+ T cell responses to TBE virus C, prM/M, and E from 40 booster-vaccinated, 45 infected, and 5 TBE-naive individuals were determined by IL-2 ELISpot assay. significant differences were observed for the responses to C and E (indicated by stars) study group included 40 healthy Caucasians who received a booster vaccination with an inactivated whole-virus TBE vaccine. no participants had taken immunosuppressive drugs or had any acute infection, clinically significant disease, or any health condition known to influence immune responses. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole-blood samples collected in sodium citrate tubes by density gradient centrifugation. serum or plasma samples were stored at 20\u00b0C until analysis. PBMCs were depleted of CD8+ T cells using anti-CD8 antibody-coated immunomagnetic beads and LD columns. a total of 188 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids (aa) were synthesized by and purchased from JPT (Berlin, Germany) the purity of all peptides was >70% as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. up to 12 peptides were arranged into minipools of C (n = 10), prM/M (n = 13), and E (n = 22) plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 50 l of AIM-V medium (Gibco) and 2 105 CD8-depleted PBMCs. the cells were then stimulated with 50 l of either pooled peptide or single peptide at a final concentration of 2 g of each peptide/ml or with 0.5 g/ml phytohemagglutinin as a positive control a positive test result was defined as >20 spots per 1 106 CD8-depleted PBMCs. the response to a single peptide was defined as positive if test results after stimulation with the maxi- and minipools containing the peptide. mature TBE virus (strain Neud\u00f6rfl) was grown in primary chicken embryo cells, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and purified by two cycles of sucrose density gradient centrifugation. the purified virus, at a final protein concentration of 100 g/ml in TAN buffer, was mixed with -d-dodecylmaltoside (DDM; final concentration, 1%) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. NCBI GI 27596775) and KUN C (strain MRM61C; Swiss-Prot/GenBank accession number P14335) were aligned. no crystallographic data exist for the DEN virus E stem-anchor region. amplification products were purified by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. Peptides with an IEDB percentile rank score of 5 or lower were used for further analysis. predictions were done for all peptides used for experimental testing. prediction of CD4+ T cell epitopes and labeling of the transmembrane domains was done. the percentage of hydrophobic amino acids in selected TBE virus peptides was calculated using the web-based Peptide Property Calculator from GenScript. a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the number of single peptides that induced a CD4+ T cell response. participants had taken immunosuppressive drugs or had any acute infection, clinically significant disease, or any health condition known to influence immune responses. study group consisted of 47 Caucasians (age range, 18 to 81 years; median age, 52 years; 25 female and 22 male) hospitalized with clinical symptoms of acute TBE virus infection. PBMCs were depleted using anti-CD8 antibody-coated immunomagnetic beads. the PBMCs were resuspended in serum-free medium (AIM-V; Gibco) the cells were counted, centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min, and resuspended at a final concentration of 2 106 cells/ml in AIM-V medium. up to 12 peptides were arranged into minipools of C (n = 10), prM/M (n = 13), and E (n = 22) each peptide present in two different minipools. samples were then tested with single peptides. peptide or single peptide at a final concentration of 2 g of each peptide/ml or with 0.5 g/ml phytohemagglutinin as a positive control. plates were washed twice with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. a positive test result was defined as >20 spots per 1 106 CD8-depleted PBMCs. serum or plasma samples were quantified in arbitrary units (AU) using a standard human anti-TBE virus serum set at 1,000 AU. ELISA values above 220 AU were considered positive. id was separated from solubilized membrane proteins by centrifugation at 14,600 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the pellet was solubilized by incubation in TAN buffer containing 0.2% SDS for 30 min at 65\u00b0C. the purity of the capsid and membrane protein fractions was controlled by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli. alignment was done using Geneious Pro, version 5.0.4 (Geneious alignment, BLOSUM62; gap open penalty, 12; gap extension penalty, 3; global alignment [Needleman-Wunsch]). amplification products were purified by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and directly sequenced by cycle sequencing with Big Dye Terminator chemistry on an ABI 3100 capillary sequencing device. es and labeling of the transmembrane domains were done for the following proteins: YF virus prM/M and E (GenBank U17066) and TM label (Swiss-Prot/GenBank P29990); severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus spike 2, E, and M (GenBank AAP41036.1) and TM label (Swiss-Prot/GenBank P03437); influenza virus hemagglut a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the number of single peptides that induced a CD4+ T cell response. for identification of the peptides that most frequently induced a CD4+ T cell response, a Fisher's exact or chi-square test was used. TBE-naive individuals (n = 5) showed no response to any of the tested peptide pools. considerable individual variation of the ratios of E- and C-specific spots was observed in both vaccinated and infected individuals. peptides from the C protein are 2- to 3-fold overrepresented (32% of total response), considering its molecular mass of only 10.6 kDa (15% of total molecular mass in immature and 13% in mature virus particles) this suggests that peptides from the C protein are either specifically favored during CD4+ T cell stimulation or that they are overrepresented in the virus particle relative to the envelope proteins. c to Env C to E+M C to E+prM E+prMd 1 79.6 138.0 0.58 0.17 0.15 3.4 3.9 2 69.6 154.0 0.45 0.17 0.15 2.9 3.3 a Molecular weight (MW) values are as follows: C, 10,600; E, 53,500; M, 8,300; prM, 18,500. b Env, envelope proteins (E+prM/M) responses, patterns of immunodominance and possible differences can become apparent only from cumulative data. we therefore calculated the frequency of obtaining a positive ELISpot assay result for each peptide using the results from all vaccinated and infected individuals obtained from the single-peptide testing. this frequency is displayed in Fig. 5A (vaccinated individuals) and Fig. 5B (patients) as the percentage of responders out of all individuals reacting with at least one peptide of vivirus Kunjin C protein (24) consisting of four helices (H1 to H4; left panel) no crystallographic data exist. stem-anchor region consists of three alpha-helices in the stem and two alpha-helices in the transmembrane (TM) anchor (34). the same peptides also induced the highest numbers of spots in the ELISpot assays. the same peptides also induced the highest numbers of spots in the vaccinated and infected individuals. however, specific differences also became apparent in some instances. peptides forming a helix in the so-called stem region of E were absent in vaccinated and infected individuals. for this purpose we selected pairs of individuals from both groups that had similar extent of reactivities with the respective peptide pools (Fig. 1) to avoid misinterpretations due to differences in response magnitude. the prediction program provided a percentile rank as a measure of their propensity to be a CD4+ T cell epitope. for each of the different peptides tested experimentally, the prediction program provided a percentile rank as a measure of their propensity to be a CD4+ T cell epitope. the results displayed in Fig. 5D and E show the distribution of these predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes in the sequences of C, prM/ the epitope predictions yielded an excellent match with the experimental data (ca. 75%). the congruence of epitope prediction dropped from 75% to 42% for C peptides. of all predicted epitopes, only 24% and 10% were also experimentally identified for C and E. us of the membrane proteins prM/M and E (Fig. 5), which did not have a counterpart in the experimental data. these sequences constitute a double membrane-spanning element (Fig. 5 labeled TM) that is derived from the specific mode of flavivirus polyprotein processing. CD4+ T cell epitopes for surface proteins of hepatitis B virus (HBV), influenza virus, vaccinia virus (EV) (extracellular envelope virion [EV]), SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), HIV, and yellow fever (YF) virus were predicted using common human HLA class II alleles. TBE-naive individuals (n = 5) showed no response to any of the tested peptide pools. significant individual variation of the ratios of E- and C-specific spots was observed. correlations were calculated using a Spearman correlation coefficient. peptides of the C protein are 2- to 3-fold overrepresented (32% of total response), considering its molecular mass of only 10.6 kDa (15% of total molecular mass in immature and 13% in mature virus particles. this suggests that peptides from the C protein are either specifically favored during CD4+ T cell stimulation or that they are overrepresented in the virus particle relative to the envelope proteins. a Molecular weight (MW) values are as follows: C, 10,600; E, 53,500; M, 8,300; prM, 18,500. a soluble fraction (containing the membrane-associated proteins E and prM/M) and aggregated fraction (containing protein C) were separated by low-speed centrifugation. the positions of E, prM, C, and M are indicated. single peptides yielded only a few positive signals. single peptides yielded only a few positive signals. vaccinated individuals recognizing a specific single peptide were too low for evaluation. crystallographic structure of the TBE virus soluble E (23) consisting of three domains (DI, DII, and DIII; right panel) no crystallographic data exist. stem-anchor region consists of three alpha-helices in the stem and two alpha-helices in the transmembrane (TM) anchor (34). two peptide clusters dominated the total CD4+ T cell response. C peptides of cluster 2 were recognized by up to 74% of vaccinated and 55% of infected responders. peptides of domain III (DIII) were overrepresented and yielded three distinct peaks in Fig. 5A. we made comparative analyses of the breadth of C- and E-specific responses in our groups of vaccinated and infected individuals. for this purpose we selected pairs of individuals from both groups that had similar extent of reactivities with the respective peptide pools. the program most frequently predicted the same set of peptides derived from helices 2 and 4 of C. the peptide yielding the highest percentage of responders in both vaccinated and infected individuals was not within the top binders in the prediction. the prediction and percentage of predicted peptides that were also identified experimentally were included in this analysis. a striking feature of the predicted patterns was the dominance of peptides from the C terminus. s constitute a double membrane-spanning element (Fig. 5 labeled TM) that is derived from the specific mode of flavivirus polyprotein processing and anchors these proteins first in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and then in the viral membrane (54). s constitute a double membrane-spanning element that is derived from the specific mode of flavivirus polyprotein processing. virus, vaccinia virus (VACV), vaccinia virus (SARS-CoV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), HIV, and yellow fever (YF) virus were predicted using common human HLA class II alleles. positions of transmembrane domains within the respective amino acid sequences are indicated by open rectangles. CD4+ T cells specific for internal proteins can internalize whole-virus particles and present peptides of internal proteins together with MHC-II at their plasma membranes. this could theoretically lead to a stronger envelope protein-specific CD4+ T cell response in TBE patients than in vaccinees. however, overall reactivities with all three structural proteins were similar in vaccinated and infected individuals. despite the strong variability of individual peptide specificities, characteristic patterns of immunodominance were observed at the population level. despite the strong variability of individual peptide specificities, characteristic patterns of immunodominance were observed at the population level. these epitopes include -sheets as well as loops extending from the lateral upper part of the domain (23). these loops protrude from the surface of the virion and have been shown for different flaviviruses to be targets of strongly neutralizing antibodies in mice. cinated and infected individuals resulted from HLA class II heterogeneity. they more likely reflect an influence of the different routes of antigen presentation in the two groups. some peptides are generated only in the course of infection and protein synthesis in infected cells. about 70% of experimentally identified peptides did not have an IEDB percentile rank score of 5 or lower. the dominance of DIII-derived peptides observed after both vaccination and natural infection was not apparent in the prediction, suggesting the importance of protein-specific and protein domain-specific factors that can affect the match between epitope prediction and experimental data. peptides of the TM domain were among the most frequently predicted. but when analyzed experimentally, they failed to be associated with a similar dominance (40, 59\u201367) there was a single exception, the N-terminal TM domain of HBsAg, which is described as being immunodominant in humans (50, 55\u201358).
