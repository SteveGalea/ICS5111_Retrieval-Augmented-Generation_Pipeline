{"summary": "gamma-herpesviruses are an example of a viral RNase that displays both broad targeting of RNAs and a poorly understood level of selectivity. gamma-herpesviruses include the human pathogens Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which causes Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. ologs of SOX in the other human gamma-herpesvirus, EBV BGLF5, and in the model murine pathogen murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV68 muSOX) also degrade RNA in cells. studies in MHV68 suggest that host shutoff by the SOX family of proteins is crucial for viral replication in specific cell types. this ability of SOX to cut at specific locations within mRNA argues for a degenerate targeting motif. in general, the principles guiding the positioning of RNA cleavages by cellular and viral mRNA endonucleases are not well understood. bioinformatics pipeline to detect high-confidence SOX cleavage sites across the mRNA transcriptome following PARE prior analyses of individual mRNAs. the mRNA was cleaved in the same location regardless of whether SOX was transiently expressed in 293T cells or expressed from the KSHV genome in lytically-reactivated iSLK.219 cells. this is in agreement with the fact that SOX activity does not rely on any additional viral proteins PARE libraries from two replicates of SOX-expressing or GFP control cells extracted the 5\u2019 end of each mapped read, which represents the cleavage site (S1 Table). Fig 1. PARE experimental procedure and peak finding analysis pipeline. the analysis uses a Bayesian probability framework to determine if the read counts at a given location differ significantly between control and test samples. for a given control read count, we compute a threshold that the read counts in the test samples have to exceed to be considered part of a \u201cpeak\u201d. cent windows that passed the cutoff were then combined into a single peak. we optimized the user-defined confidence level and ratio by determining how many peaks were detected when comparing each SOX replicate sample to its GFP control to detect SOX-specific peaks. varying the parameters improved discrimination of SOX-specific peaks and reduced detection of \u201cnoise\u201d peaks specific to one repeat. up to 20% of the SOX-specific peaks but fewer than 9% of control GFP-specific peaks were shared between the replicates. read counts at the putative cut site in the two replicates were highly correlated. a scanning window of 4 nt, a multiplicative factor of 4, a confidence level of 99.99%, were used to predict cut sites. all cuts sites 5 nt apart in the two replicates were used for the analyses. transcription start sites may represent the beginning of full-length decapped mRNAs rather than endonuclease cleavage fragments. these analyses indicate that SOX cut sites are not restricted to a particular region of the mRNA. cleavage sites may be enriched in areas of the transcripts that are not covered by ribosomes. 200 nt sequences surrounding SOX cleavage sites were cloned into the GFP reporter at nt 715 (with the exception of panel E; in this case the insertion was at nt 459) the GFP- based reporters were then co-expressed with SOX (\u201c+\u201d or \u201c+SOX\u201d) in shXrn1-treated cells. the arrowheads point to the additional cleavage fragments resulting from the insertions. the original cleavage site in the GFP coding region was almost completely abolished in favor of the new cleavage site. insertion of the LIMD1 200 nt sequence in a different position in the GFP mRNA also elicited SOX cleavage. the site likely occurs in an unstructured region of the mRNA. the accessibility was computed using Localfold [28] on a 300 nt sequence surrounding the cut site. log2 likelihood of each of the 4 nucleotides at position relative to the cut in cut sites shared between the two SOX samples. the position right after the cut site (position 0) was preferentially C or T. pyrimidines C or T were found at 85% of the SOX cut sites. C or A were the most frequent bases at position 0 in cuts specific to GFP control samples. the cut sites in six out of seven of the RNAs fold in hairpin structures with oligo-A stretches and the cleavage sites in unpaired loops. the only exception was MAPK8IP3, which also lacked the oligo-A sequence. the structure predictions mirror the accessibility results from Localfold analysis. the GFP mRNA was detected using Northern blotting. the empty arrowheads point to the additional cleavage fragment. the filled arrowheads point to the normal GFP cleavage fragment. we shortened the inserted sequence from 200 nt to 54 nt, 39 nt and 33 nt. the same sequences are present in the 200 nt and the 33 nt SRSF3 insertion. the same sequences are present in the 200 nt and the 33 nt SRSF3 insertion. mutating an A dimer just upstream of the cut site in a SRSF3 insertion construct reduces SOX-mediated cleavage. mutating the nucleotide at position 0 from an A to a G prevented SOX-mediated cleavage in two out of three of the RNA we tested. bases around the cut site diverged from the expected distribution for human RNA sequences. the log likelihoods for our PWM were derived from 129 very high confidence SOX cut sites identified in both of our experimental repeats. the presence of preferred nucleotides in positions -10 to +9 from the cut site results in higher (positive) log likelihood scores, whereas a poorer match to the motif produces a lower (negative) log likelihood score. a position weight matrix (PWM) for nucleotide likelihood in the 20 nt surrounding the SOX cut sites was generated from the 129 sequences that contained SOX-specific sites with a confidence level of 99.999%. the results of these analyses indicate that although the precise sequence composition may vary, there is a specific element marking SOX cut sites that is not observed in control samples. 10 out of 271 (4%) of the cuts were found at the site with the best score. the cumulative frequency distribution for the percentile of the score at the cut was plotted. the prevalence of high scoring sequences may explain how SOX is able to degrade most transcripts. MHV68 [16] shows degradation of viral transcripts by proteins of the SOX family. coding RNAs tended to contain sequences that were slightly better matches to the motif than non-coding RNAs. we also wanted to test whether sequences around the experimentally determined SOX cleavage sites were more likely to match the motif. we plotted the fold change for each gene against the best motif score for that gene. inverse correlation between the fold change in mRNA levels and the motif scores. the level of down-regulation of mRNAs by SOX is in part determined by the degree to which their sequence is a good match for the SOX targeting motif. degradation intermediates are cleared by the host 5\u2019-3\u2019 exonuclease Xrn1 [5]. cells expressing GFP alone were used as controls to filter out RNA fragments generated by cellular RNases or other processing events. positions referred to as \u201cpeak\u201d and \u201ccut site\u201d in the text are marked on the graph. Flow chart of steps used to define SOX cut sites used for further analyses. the software builds a reference table of the thresholds for the entire dataset. read counts were statistically higher in the samples from SOX-expressing cells than in control samples (peaks) the ratio used to determine thresholds was computed from the user-defined multiplicative factor and the ratio of the total number of reads mapping to each exon. we integrated read counts within small windows (4 nt) rather than single nucleotides. this program could be used to identify the ends of degradation fragments in other degradome datasets that contain matching test and control samples. a higher number of peaks specific to SOX-containing samples relative to control samples, consistent with broad mRNA targeting by SOX. up to 20% of the SOX-specific peaks but fewer than 9% of control GFP-specific peaks were shared between the replicates. peak height is defined as the highest read count within the peak window. position of the cut sites within the mRNAs relative to the length of the transcript. ND = not determined, because multiple transcript isoforms are present in the annotation. only a fraction of the peaks was located within 50 nt of any of these landmarks in either case. the 15\u201320% of both SOX and GFP peaks near annotated transcription start sites may represent the beginning of full-length decapped mRNAs rather than endonuclease cleavage fragments. sequences surrounding the SOX cut site in human mRNAs contain a SOX targeting sequence. n.d. = not detected with RACE primers used. 200 nt sequences surrounding SOX cleavage sites were cloned into the GFP reporter. the insertion of the sequences from six out of seven of the candidate SOX cleavage sites resulted in the appearance of a second RNA fragment in SOX-expressing cells. the intensity of the additional cleavage products varied between the insertions, suggesting some sequences are better SOX targets than others. we found that the original cleavage site in the GFP coding region was almost completely abolished in favor of the new cleavage site. the nucleotides 5\u2019 of the SOX cut were more accessible (thus presumably unstructured) than surrounding sequences. this pattern was different from the sequences surrounding the cut sites. analysis of sequences surrounding the cut sites reveals common structural and sequence features. varying number of sequences used for the analyses in the different panels is a result of the requirement for sufficient flanking sequences in the same annotated exon. we also computed the log likelihood for different nucleotides at positions around the SOX cleavage. first, the position right after the cut site was preferentially C or T. analysis of an endogenous SOX cleavage sequence confirms role of oligo A sequence and potential structural element. RNAfold predicted that the 50\u201354 nt surrounding the cut sites in six out of seven of the RNAs fold in hairpin structures with oligo-A stretches. the only exception was MAPK8IP3, which also lacked the oligo-A sequence. RNAfold was used to predict the structure of all 50-nt sequences. the proportion of cut site where the location of the cut was predicted to be unpaired, that had an unpaired A dimer within 5 nt of the cut or both is plotted. the insertion of the SOX cut site in SRSF3 was mutated to a G (A G) and the A dimer preceding the SOX cut site was mutated to a C dimer (AA CC) the efficiency of the cleavage could vary depending on the length of the inserted endogenous sequence. a TGAAGT sequence 5 nt before the GFP cut site to TGAGTG could abolish the cleavage site in GFP. mutating the nucleotide at position 0 from an A to a G prevented SOX-mediated cleavage in two out of three of three of the cut site. a similar TGAAAG sequence predicted to be in an unpaired loop. these data suggest that SOX activity is inhibited by the presence of a G nucleotide as the residue 3\u2019 of the cleavage. a conserved sequence pattern is specific to SOX-dependent cut sites. sequences flanking the cut sites lacked a strong consensus motif. sequences flanking the set of reproducible SOX cut sites were a closer match to the motif compared to those surrounding GFP-specific fragment ends. a similar difference was seen when analyzing the sequences surrounding all potential SOX and control (GFP) cut sites from each of the two biological repeats. human transcripts were divided into coding and non-coding based on the annotation in ENSEMBL. the frequency distribution histogram for the top scores for each transcript is shown. 10 out of 271 (4%) cuts were found at the site with the best score. the prevalence of high scoring sequences may explain how SOX is able to degrade most transcripts. we found that KSHV transcripts also contained sequences that matched the motif. this suggests that sequence specificity is not used by SOX to discriminate between host and viral mRNAs. human transcripts were classified as down-regulated by SOX or SOX escapees. the best motif score for each RNA detected in the RNAseq experiment was then computed using a 20-nt scanning window. we found that the down-regulated RNAs had better motif scores than the escapee RNAs. a degenerate sequence pattern can be found in all viral and host RNAs. good matches for a loosely defined sequence pattern can be found in all viral and host RNAs, enabling cleavage to be simultaneously specific and widespread. it may explain why SOX has less dramatic effects on RNA than other viral RNases. subsets of viral and cellular transcripts are not susceptible to host shutoff [6,7,16,17], and it is likely that at least some of these escape due to the absence of a robust targeting element. however, the correlation between scores of matches to the motif and the level of degradation of host mRNAs suggest that sequences within the motif can influence rates of degradation of different RNAs. in vitro studies indicate that the binding affinity of SOX for RNA is much lower than its affinity for DNA [34], which is also processed by SOX during viral genome replication in the nucleus. this suggests that SOX may not recognize RNA targets directly but may instead be recruited by a protein partner. shXrn1 cells were generated using pTRIPZ-shXrn1 (Thermoscientific, clone V2THS_89028/RHS4696-99704634, targeting sequence: TATGGTGAGATATACTATG) to induce expression of the shXrn1 cells were treated with 1 g/ml doxycycline (Fisher) for 4\u20135 days prior to harvesting. nt 459 of the GFP coding region using Quikchange mutagenesis (Agilent) and the 200 nt surrounding the cleavage site in LIMD1 were inserted at this location. mutate the AAA sequence preceding the cleavage site to CCC, GGG and TTT in the pd2eGFP construct containing the 100 nt LIMD1 fragment. cDNA was synthesized using oligodT directed primers. cDNA was then amplified 15 times. libraries were checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer. a Bayesian probability framework was used to find peaks that were specific to test samples compared to control samples. at a given location, we assume that there is an underlying rate at which reads are produced, and the observed count follows a Poisson distribution with mean equal to this rate. we then deem that there is a significant difference between the control and test at that location. between test/control read counts of 4 and a confidence level of 99.99% or 99.999% were used to output specific peaks. for subsequent bioinformatics analysis only peaks that were found in both biological repeats were used. the log likelihood score was then calculated for all sequences surrounding cut sites. the highest score was recorded for each mRNA. the ENSEMBL annotation was also used to determine whether the transcripts were spliced. the structure of the sequences surrounding the validated cut sites was predicted using the RNAfold webserver (Vienna RNA package [29]) the results were analyzed to determine whether either of the nucleotides at position -1 and 0 was predicted to be unpaired. RNA analysis Total cellular RNA was isolated for Northern blotting using Trizol (Life Technologies) protein harvesting and western blotting Protein was isolated for western blots in protein lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) western blots were performed with mouse anti-Xrn1 antibodies (Bethyl laboratories or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000) or mouse anti-tubulin antibodies (1:3000, Sigma Aldrich) for the second biological repeat of the PARE experiment, cells were transfected twice with the siRNA against Xrn1 as previously described. for the second biological repeat of the PARE experiment, cells were transfected twice with the siRNA against Xrn1 as previously described. the 100 nt LIMD1 fragment, the 100 nt PGAM1 fragment or the 33 nt SRSF3 fragments mutate the cleavage site from A to G. mutate the GFP TGAAGT to TGAGTG. all primers used for cloning are listed in S5 Table. trimmed reads that were longer than 22 nt or shorter than 19 nt were discarded. no mismatches were allowed (-N 0 option), and only alignments that uniquely mapped to the annotated portion of the genome were retained. we then use Bayes' theorem to construct posterior distributions for the rates. we then deem that there is a significant difference between the control and test at that location. we then deem that there is a significant difference between the control and test at that location. sequences of 300 nt on each side of the cut site were analyzed. 129 cut sites were deemed high confidence in our analysis. log likelihood score for each 20 nt sequence was calculated in all sequences longer than 20 nt. the highest score was recorded for each mRNA. RNAs annotated as \"protein coding\", \"nonsense mediated decay\" and \"non stop decay\" were considered coding. the ENSEMBL annotation was also used to determine whether the transcripts were spliced. RNA analysis Total cellular RNA was isolated for Northern blotting using Trizol. blots were probed with 32P-labeled DNA probes made using Decaprime II. secondary antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilution and purchased from Southern Biotech. 5\u2019 RACE analysis of GFP degradation fragment was carried out in KSHV-infected iSLK-219 cells also expressing shRNAs against Xrn1. arrows indicate the 5\u2019 ends detected by sequencing of the cloned 5\u2019 RACE product. peaks were identified as a function of the maximum distance allowed between the peaks. a-f) Plots of read counts (5\u2019 ends only) for 200 nt surrounding the chromosomal position of selected SOX cut sites in the four samples. all plots represent a section of the marked exon. the GFP reporters were co-expressed with SOX (\u201c+\u201d) or an empty vector control (\u201c-\u201d) in shXrn1-treated cells. the empty arrowheads point to the additional cleavage fragment resulting from insertions, whereas the filled arrowheads point to the normal GFP cleavage fragment.
