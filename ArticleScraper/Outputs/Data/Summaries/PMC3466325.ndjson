{"summary": "vaccines based on attenuated viral vectors (e.g. poxviruses, adenovirus) are highly immunogenic and relatively inexpensive to produce. pre-existing anti-vector immunity can significantly impair the ability to raise immune responses to vaccination in the pre-immune host. that suggests that it will be advantageous to prioritize development of viral vaccine vectors to which pre-existing immunity is rare in the human population. a single cycle non-replicating experimental rVSV vaccine developed a high fever and transient viremia in the first 24 hours after vector administration [15]. that result demonstrated that even single cycle vectors can induce significant adverse side effects. rVSV-based vaccines to move forward to clinical use are important to identify ways to eliminate rVSV vector-associated pathology that do not at the same time compromise vector immunogenicity or oncolytic properties. IL-1 receptor deficient mice were immunized with a single intramuscular injection of 5108 PFU live replication-competent rVSV. all animals survived the immunization, but wild type mice lost 10% of their pre-immunization body weight by the first day after immunization. IL-1R/ mice had minimal pathology, losing only a small amount (5%) of weight on the first day after immunization. IL-1R/ mice (n = 3) lost less weight and recovered more quickly than wild type (WT, n = 4) mice after immunization. difference in weight loss was significant from day 1-day 4 after challenge. wild type mice challenged with rVSV produce IL-1 locally and systemically. groups of adult female mice were immunized with two injections (5108 PFU per injection) of rVSV in each rear quadriceps. at 12 and 24 hours after infection mice (n = 4 per timepoint) were sacrificed and IL-1 in the blood. intramuscularly immunized mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R/) with 5108 PFU of rVSV measured viral loads, induction of antibody and T cell responses, and protection from rechallenge. the results showed that IL-1 is not required for the control of VSV replication in vivo. mice were fully protected from rechallenge, while nave wild type animals lost 20% of their pre-infection body weight. IL-1 was not required either for the control of rVSV replication in vivo or for the generation of protective anti-VSV immune responses. a cohort of nave wild type mice (n = 7) was challenged intranasally with a semi-lethal dose of rVSV (1108 PFU) at eight weeks after the primary infection all mice were challenged intranasally with a semi-lethal dose of rVSV. the authors did not test whether RIG-I, ASC, and caspase-1 were required to produce IL-1 in response to VSV in vivo. it was not practical to test RIG-I deficient mice for IL-1 induction. we infected three groups in parallel (5108 PFU rVSV intramuscular) IL-1R/ mice (n = 4) lost significantly less weight than wild type (n = 5) mice. difference in weight loss between IL-1R/ and ASC/ mice was significant on first and second day after challenge. the comparison of IL-1 production by wild type and ASC/ mice has been performed four times with consistent results. panel B shows average percent initial weight for wild type (n = 6) and ASC/ (n = 5) mice after intramuscular challenge with 5108 PFU of rVSV. IL-1R/ mice lost significantly less weight than wild type (days 2\u20134) or ASC/ mice (days 1\u20132). a cohort of nave wild type mice (n = 5) was challenged intranasally with a semi-lethal dose of rVSV (1108 PFU) all pre-immune mice had robust immunity to rechallenge (Panel F) and did not lose weight. one of the nave mice succumbed to infection. groups of adult C57BL/6 wild type or caspase 1/ mice were immunized with two injections (5108 PFU per injection) of rVSV. at 24 hours after infection mice (n = 2\u20133 mice per timepoint) were sacrificed and IL-1 in the draining popliteal LN (Panel A left) and quadriceps muscle (Panel A right) was quantitated. mouse deficient in the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R/) are protected from weight loss after immunization with VSV vaccine vectors. weight loss is usually maximal by the second day after immunization but most animals recover. IL-1R/ mice (n = 3) lost less weight and recovered more quickly than wild type mice (WT, n = 4) after immunization. difference in weight loss was significant from day 1-day 4 after challenge. wild type mice challenged with rVSV produce IL-1 locally and systemically. mice immunized intramuscularly with rVSV had accumulations of IL-1 in the blood, in the quadriceps muscle and in the popliteal lymph node that drains the quadriceps at 12 and 24 hours after immunization with VSV rwt. sham-inoculated mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R/) with 5108 PFU of rVSV and measured viral loads, induction of antibody and T cell responses, and protection from rechallenge. IL-1 is not required for the control of VSV replication in vivo. IL-1R/ mice had slightly fewer anti-VSV N specific CD8 T cells in the blood than wild type animals at 14 and 28 days after immunization. the difference was statistically significant at 14 and 28 days after immunization. mice were sacrificed at 24 hours after infection and viral titers determined in the quadriceps muscle (Panel A) there was no significant difference in viral loads between the two groups. IL-1 is synthesized as an inactive precursor molecule (pro-IL-1) it must be cleaved intracellularly by endogenous protease caspase-1 [25], [26], [27], or extracellularly by matrix metalloprotease 9 [28] or other neutrophil and mast cell-associated proteases [30] to become biologically active. it was not practical to test whether RIG-I deficient mice were required to produce IL-1 in response to V IL-1 induces acute weight loss after rVSV infection. n = 5) mice lost slightly less weight after rVSV challenge than wild type mice infected in parallel. difference in weight loss between wild type and wild type mice was small but highly reproducible. mice deficient in the inflammasome adaptor ASC (ASC/) are partially protected from acute pathology after intramuscular rVSV immunization. groups of adult female C57BL/6 wild type or ASC/ mice were immunized with two injections (5108 PFU per injection) of rVSV. panel D shows average serum neutralizing titers for WT (n = ) and ASC/ (n = ) mice after primary immunization with VSV. there were no significant differences in neutralizing titer between the two groups. caspase-1 deficient mice immunized intramuscularly with 5108 PFU of rVSV. the difference in weight loss between wild type and caspase-1/ mice was significant only on days 2 and 3 after challenge. the comparison of IL-1 production by wild type and caspase 1/ mice has been performed twice with consistent results. panel B shows average percent initial weight for wild type and caspase 1/ mice (n = 5 per group) after intramuscular challenge. studies have correlated increased levels of IL-1 or other pro-inflammatory cytokines with the induction of high fevers or other adverse events in response to live virus vaccination in humans [36], [40], or have identified genetic polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene which predispose individuals to severe adverse events after receiving live virus vaccines. a significant drawback to intranasal immunization with rVSV is the risk of neurotropic spread of the virus. mice deficient in the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) are significantly protected from weight loss after intramuscular challenge with VSV. the IL-1 receptor binds IL-1 and IL-1. IL-1 is more commonly associated with these pathologies than is IL-1. rVSV vectors to suppress IL-1 production and/or signaling would be a rational approach to reducing rVSV associated pathology. none of these had examined whether or not the induced IL-1 contributed positively to or was required for generation of immune responses or protection. in other viral infection models where this has been investigated, published reports are not in agreement. IL-1R/ mice challenged with VSV made robust humoral and cellular responses to VSV antigens, and were fully protected from a high dose intranasal rechallenge with VSV. the number of anti-VSV specific CD8 T cells was significantly lower in IL-1R/ and ASC/ mice at 14 days after infection, but not significantly different at either 7 or 28 days after infection. the second question arising from our results is how the VSV-induced production of IL-1 might be suppressed. we decided to determine whether there might be a way of suppressing IL-1 only in the cells directly infected with VSV, or within the focus of VSV-infected cells. ELISA assays do not rigorously discriminate between detection of pro-IL-1 and detection of the cleaved active IL-1. however, it is possible that some of the IL-1 detected in caspase/ mice was not biologically active. soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist contributes to acute pathology after intramuscular immunization with VSV. IL-1 was not required for control of viral replication, for the induction of cellular or humoral immune responses, or for development of protective immunity to rechallenge. these results add to our understanding of the role for IL-1 in promoting adaptive immunity. mice were injected with the indicated amount of virus(es) in 50 l total volume. mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and administered the indicated amount of virus in 30 l total volume. assay for neutralizing antibody against VSV Blood was obtained from mice on days 7, 14 and 28. heat inactivated serum was diluted in serum-free DMEM. the final dilution in the first well of a 96-well plate was 110 for day 7 samples. the tetramer was a PE-conjugated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I Kb tetramer (NIH Tetramer Facility) containing the H-2Kb restricted peptide VSV N53\u201359 (N-RGYVYQGL-C) background was routinely less than 0.1% and was subtracted from all reported percentages. mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and administered the indicated amount of virus in 30 l total volume. determination of viral titers by plaque assay Mice were sacrificed via anesthetic overdose and organs removed aseptically. 100 PFU of rVSV diluted in serum-free DMEM was added to each well and incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C-5%CO2 for three days. the neutralizing titer was defined as the highest dilution of serum that gave 100% neutralization of rVSV. a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I Kb tetramer (NIH Tetramer Facility) containing the H-2Kb restricted peptide VSV N53\u201359 (N-RGYVYQGL-C) was used to determine background levels of tetramer binding. background was routinely less than 0.1%."}
