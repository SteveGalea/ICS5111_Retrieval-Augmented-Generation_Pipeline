{"summary": "polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small non-enveloped DNA tumor viruses belonging to the polyomaviridae family. the first two human PyVs, JC and BK PyV, were discovered in 1971. an additional 11 human PyVs have been uncovered. SV40 contains a circular doubled-stranded DNA genome of approximately five kilobases. it encodes seven genes, three structural genes called VP1, VP2, VP3, and four non-structural genes called VP4, large T antigen, small T antigen, and agno protein. SV40 lacks a surrounding envelope and instead contains a protein capsid composed of 360 VP1 copies arranged as 72 pentamers. SV40 mobilizes to the nucleus, where ensuing transcription and replication of the viral genome causes lytic infection or cellular transformation. ensuing transcription and replication of the viral genome causes lytic infection or cellular transformation. a folded polypeptide is packaged into coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles and exits the ER en route for secretion. a third of all mammalian genes encode proteins that are translocated into the ER. the ER maintains a quality control system that prevents the generation of misfolded ER proteins. ER-associated degradation pathway identifies and triages misfolded ER proteins. ER-resident chaperones target the misfolded client to the retro-translocation machinery on the ER membrane. a major component of this channel is the Sel1L-Hrd1 membrane complex. a misfolded polypeptide is targeted to a protein-conducting channel that retro-translocates the substrate from the ER into the cytosol. the multi-pass ER transmembrane protein called E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Hrd1 (synoviolin) is a strong candidate. other components such as the Hrd1-interacting partners called Derlins have also been implicated. polyubiquitination is thought to prevent \u201cback-sliding\u201d of the client into the cytosol. it is catalyzed by cytosolic chaperones that actively extract the polyubiquitinated substrate into the cytosol. this is accomplished by the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities. SV40 is thought to disguise as a \u201cmisfolded\u201d substrate. it co-opts components of the ERAD machinery in order to penetrate the ER membrane and reach the cytosol. this conformational change generates a hydrophobic viral particle that binds to and inserts into the ER membrane. ERp57-ERp29 triad has also been reported to act on JC PyV during infection. penetration across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol is a decisive SV40 infection step. this process can be conceptually divided into ER lumenal, membrane, and cytosolic events. the cytosolic complex is composed of 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsc70), human heat shock protein 105 kDa (Hsp105) and small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha (SGTA) that extracts SV40 into the cytosol. SGTA\u2019s precise function is unclear, but can either regulate Hsc70\u2019s ability to engage SV40, bring Hsc70 and Hsp105 adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-bound form, BiP has a high affinity for its substrate. adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-BiP displays a low substrate-binding affinity. ER-resident ERdj3 was found to promote SV40 ER membrane transport by stimulating SV40-BiP interaction. Sel1L [50] but not Hrd1 [59] plays a role in SV40 and JC PyV infection [58] there may exist a pool of Sel1L that does not bind to Hrd1. this pool might recruit previously uncharacterized ER (or possibly cytosolic) proteins that promote PyV infection. ER membrane components such as the Derlins have also been reported to mediate ER-to-cytosol transport of SV40 [50], as well as the murine PyV [64], and BK PyV [65]. unbiased RNA interference (RNAi) screen, three ER transmembrane J-proteins (B12, B14, and C18) were found to be essential in promoting SV40 and BK PyV infection [60], but the precise molecular AP29), B12, B14, and C18, reorganize into distinct subdomains within the ER membrane called foci during SV40 infection. the VP2/VP3 exposed, membrane penetration-competent form of SV40 is found predominantly in these punctate structures [70] SV40 mutants which cannot transfer across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol fail to trigger foci formation. p97 normally provides the primary driving force to extract a misfolded client from the ER into the cytosol. however, this cytosolic ATPase is not involved in SV40 infection. we pinpointed a cytosolic complex composed of Hsc70, human heat shock protein 105 kDa (Hsp105) that plays an essential role in ejecting SV40 into the cytosol. iterative rounds of Hsc70-Hsp105 binding to and release from SV40 are thought to provide the major driving energy to extract the viral particle from the ER membrane. a disaggregation activity is used to drive cytosolic release of a virus from the ER. SGTA catalyzes an important step in the guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathway. SGTA delivers a hydrophobic protein from the cytosol to the ER. in the GET pathway, SGTA extracts a hydrophobic protein complex (SV40) from the ER into the cytosol during SV40 infection. SV40 is thought to disguise as a \u201cmisfolded\u201d substrate, co-opting components of the ERAD machinery in order to penetrate the ER membrane and reach the cytosol. this conformational change generates a hydrophobic viral particle that binds to and inserts into the ER membrane, a step required for successful membrane transport. ER membrane to reach the cytosol is a decisive SV40 infection step. the process can be conceptually divided into ER lumenal, membrane, and cytosolic events. SV40 is maintained in a soluble state by interacting with ADP-binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) iterative cycles of Hsc70-Hsp105 binding to and release from SV40 are thought to extract SV40 into the cytosol. SGTA\u2019s precise function is unclear, but can either regulate Hsc70\u2019s ability to engage SV40, bring Hsc70 and Hsp105 in proximity due to its ability to dimerize. adenosine diphosphate (ATP)-BiP displays a low substrate-binding affinity. ER-resident ERdj3 was found to promote SV40 ER membrane transport. only glucose-regulated protein 170 kDa (Grp170) promotes SV40 release from BiP. there may be a pool of Sel1L that does not bind to Hrd1. this pool may recruit previously uncharacterized ER (or possibly cytosolic) proteins that promote PyV infection. a clear theme has come into focus for ER luminal events initiating the membrane transport process. three ER transmembrane J-proteins (B12, B14, and C18) were found to be essential in promoting SV40 and BK PyV infection [60] of these J-proteins, B12 and B14 have been previously implicated in the ERAD process [66,67,68] part of their mechanism of action likely involves the recruitment of cytosolic Hsc70 and associated co-chaperones. v2/VP3 exposed, membrane penetration-competent form of SV40 is found predominantly in these punctate structures [70] SV40 mutants which cannot transfer across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol fail to trigger foci formation. v40 mutants which cannot transfer across the ER membrane to reach the cytosol also fail to trigger foci formation. p97 normally provides the primary driving force to extract a misfolded client from the ER into the cytosol [46] but this cytosolic ATPase is not involved in SV40 infection [59]. a classical biochemical approach was used to identify the putative cytosolic extraction machinery. iterative rounds of Hsc70-Hsp105 binding to and release from SV40 are thought to provide the major driving energy to extract the viral particle from the ER membrane. a disaggregation activity is used to drive cytosolic release of a virus from the ER. SGTA delivers a hydrophobic protein from the cytosol to the ER. it extracts a hydrophobic protein complex (SV40) from the ER into the cytosol. SGTA may regulate Hsc70\u2019s ability to engage SV40. SGTA appears to be exploited by other viruses for different purposes, consistent with its ability to function in numerous cellular pathways. a major ER quality control pathway called ERAD is exploited by the archetype PyV SV40, as well as other PyV family members, during ER membrane penetration. non-enveloped viruses are exploited to create a hydrophobic particle that inserts into the ER membrane. if true, this would be the first instance of a viral particle that selectively builds a physical structure through which it crosses a host membrane. despite emerging insights into the overall PyV infection pathway, many critical questions remain."}
