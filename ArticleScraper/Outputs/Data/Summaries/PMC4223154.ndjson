{"summary": "west Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that circulates in a bird-mosquito enzootic cycle with humans and horses as incidental hosts. it belongs to the Japanese encephalitis subgroup that also includes japan encephalitis virus (JEV), st. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. NS1\u2032 protein synthesis, its amino acid sequence, and RNA sequence requirements for PRF were experimentally demonstrated in mosquito cells, mammalian cells, and cell-free settings. PRF occurred in 50% of translational events and led to the production of NS1\u2032 protein containing the entire NS1 sequence. puromycin resistance gene F2A \u2013 foot and mouth virus 2A autoprotease, LacZ \u2013 -galactosidase gene, E22 \u2013 WNVKUN sequence coding for entire non-structural region, HDVr \u2013 hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, pA- polyA signal. the underlined sequence indicates the slippery heptanucleotide frameshift motif and in bold are the two silent nucleot single mutation G66A in the NS2A gene ablated production of NS1\u2032 and reduced neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness in mice. NS1\u2032 protein produced by the wt jaOArS982c was shown to co-localize with NS5 protein [25], indicating a role for NS1\u2032 in RNA replication. a clear function for NS1\u2032 remains to be elucidated and some of the results seem to be contradictory. an area of investigation that has been seemingly neglected is the possibility that the frameshift itself has a function in addition to or independent from potential function(s) of the NS1\u2032 protein itself. in the absence of PRF (during WT infection) proteins located upstream of the PRF will be produced in excess to those proteins located downstream of the PRF site. we investigated for the first time the role of NS1\u2032 (PRF) in virus infection, replication, and transmission following infection of Culex mosquitoes. previously we did not detect significant differences in accumulation of WT and A30A\u2032 WNVKUN viruses in the supernatant of infected vero 76 or C6/36 mosquito cells. this suggests a potential role in replication for the NS1\u2032 protein. otide mutations in the NS2A gene disrupt formation of pseudoknot structures required for PRF but do not change the amino acid sequence of the NS2A protein. these mutations disrupt formation of pseudoknot structures required for PRF but do not change the amino acid sequence of the NS2A protein (Figure 1 B and C) EV chimeric replicons the authors concluded that a mutation in the frameshift motif in NS2A was selected to eliminate PRF. genomes that were deficient in PRF were more efficiently packaged than WT genomes that were competent in PRF and producing NS1\u2032 [26]. we decided to investigate whether the viral spread was affected by PRF-eliminating mutations by using a low MOI. kinetics of infection was followed by IFA with anti-E monoclonal antibodies. the percentage of infected cells was determined automatically by Incell-1000 Workstation software. we also analysed replication and cytopathicity (CPE) of WT and A30A\u2032 WNVKUN viruses in another mammalian cell line LLC-MK2. significant and similar severity of CPE upon infection of DF-1 cells. this is in contrast to significant differences between wt and PRF-deficient virus replication in DF-1 cells reported for JEV [25]. it is not unreasonable to assume that PRF deficiency may affect replication of JEV and WNV differently. WT mutants A30A\u2032 and A30P were attenuated in weanling mice. WNVKUN mutant A30P was also attenuated in adult animals. this raised the possibility that interferon-independent pathways may be involved in this attenuation. low passage primary WT and IRF3/7/ MEFs were infected at MOI of 1 with WNVKUN WT, WNVKUN A30A\u2032, or WNVKUN A30P viruses. 48 hpi total RNA was extracted and used for analysis of global gene expression by microarrays. A30A\u2032 WNVKUN viruses in WT or IRF3//7/ MEFs produced similar transcriptional profiles. only a small number of genes were differentially affected between these two infections. differences detected were relatively small despite 10-fold difference in viral titres. differentially expressed genes were abundant when comparisons included transcriptional changes induced by A30P WNVKUN virus infections. the A30P mutation played a significant role in the differential regulation of hundreds of genes compared to the WT or A30A\u2032 virus infections in IRF3//7/ MEFs. all 3 viruses, however, did induce upregulation and downregulation of a large number of host transcripts in both cell types when compared to Mock cells. single nucleotide polymorphisms in WT and A30A\u2032 WNVKUN genome pools for the presence of single nucleotide variants. 4198 aT 0,58> 0.014 WT 1201 g 2411 gA 27,1> 0.012 WT 1203 a 2812 aG 29,1> 0.011 WT 1261 a 2790 aG 0,28> 0.010 WT 1475 c 3408 cA 97,3> 0.029 WT 1479 c 3468 cG 49,4> 0.015 WT 1480 g 4790 gC 46,4 0.015 A30A\u2032 1483 g 5624 gC 77,2 0.014 A30A\u2032 1784 a 2875 aG 55,2> 0.020 A30A\u2032 2820 c 2241 cT 3,50> 0.024 We did not find significant differences between WT and A30A\u2032 WNVKUN genomes related to the presence or abundance of variants. however, 11% of the WT reads across the pseudoknot region contained a variant an unexplored consequence of PRF in the NS2A gene is its potential impact on altering the expression of viral proteins. occurrence of PRF at the start of the NS2A gene should change this 11 ratio and should produce a surplus of structural proteins. this is, proteins located in the viral genome before the PRF site will be produced from each translatable molecule. NS3 or NS5 proteins relative to -gal accumulation should be increased in Rep-A30A\u2032 transfected cells. total protein lysates were lysed with RIPA buffer at 48, 72 and 96 hours post electroporation. ratio of -gal/NS proteins in Rep-WT was set to 1.0. Ratios of -gal/NS proteins were calculated and plotted as a function of KUNRep-WT ratios. BHK-21 cells were infected with WNVKUN WT or A30A\u2032 virus. at 48 and 72 hpi proteins were pulse-labelled with 35S methionine/cysteine with and without brefedrin A treatment. the presence of PRF in the NS2A gene of WNV alters the equimolar ratio of viral structural and NS proteins. the presence of PRF in the NS2A gene of WNV alters the equimolar ratio of viral structural and NS proteins, in the replicon or virus infection settings. viremia profiles of HOSPs inoculated with WNVNY99 WT (NY99 WT) or WNVNY99 A30A\u2032 (NY99 A30A\u2032) viruses showed noticeable attenuation at peak time of infection. differences in virus titres between wild-caught HOSPs were not statistically significant. both the A30A\u2032 and A30P viruses were transmitted at significantly lower rates (P0.005) than the WT virus. lack of PRF/NS1\u2032-deficient mutants show reduced replication and dissemination in Culex annulirostris mosquitoes. s were inoculated onto confluent monolayers of C6/36 cells in a 96 well microtiter plate. infection detected by a cell culture enzyme immunoassay. a one-way ANOVA was employed to determine significant differences in mean viral titers. NS1\u2032 and NS1 protein co-localise within infected cells. NS1\u2032 protein is able to complement replication of replication-deficient NS1-deletion mutants in trans. to this end we used 2 WNVKUN replicons, SP6KUNrep3gal (PRF-competent, wt) and SP6KUNrep3gal/NS2A-A30A\u2032. X-gal staining of electroporated cells showed similar numbers of -gal expressing cells at all time-points tested for both replicons. results were confirmed by Northern blot of total RNAs from electroporated cells using a radiolabelled 3\u2032-UTR probe. findings indicate absence/presence of NS1\u2032/PRF does not have a significant effect on replication and accumulation of replicon RNAs confirming previous results with full length infectious clo NVKUN viruses and progress of infection followed by IFA with anti-E monoclonal antibodies. at 24 hpi only a few cells were infected with either virus. by 36\u201348 hpi most cells were infected. DF-1 and LLC-MK2 cell lines were infected with WNVKUN WT, WNVKUN A30A\u2032, and WNVKUN A30P viruses. this mutation also eliminates PRF and production of NS1\u2032. this mutation also changes amino acid 30 in NS2A protein from Ala to Pro. staining at 5 dpi of DF-1 and LLC-MK2 cells infected with WT, A30A\u2032, or A30P viruses at MOI of 1. A30P WNVKUN virus showed significant CPE in LLC-MK2 cells and was indistinguishable in growth properties. titers of viruses accumulated in the supernatant of infected cells at this time point indicated that A30P and A30A\u2032 viruses reached lower titers than WT virus during infection of WT MEFs. expression of several hundred genes was affected by viral infection of WT MEFs. 169 WT MEF A30A\u2032 vs Mock 318 114 WT MEF A30P vs Mock 304 81 WT MEF WT vs A30A\u2032 15 5 WT MEF A30A\u2032 vs A30P 0 0 WT MEF WT vs A30P 8 0 IRF3//7/ dko WT vs Mock 1470 1528 IRF3//7/ dko W WT vs A30A\u2032 ID logFC Fold Mmp10 0.94 1.92 Serpinb2 0.74 1.67 Mmp13 0.69 1.61 Gas7 0.68 1.61 Tlr2 0.65 1.57 Cd40 0.63 1.55 1200002N14Rik 0.62 1.53 Atm 0.58 1.49 Clec4e 0.58 1.49 Oasl1 0.57 1.49 Serpina3f 0.57 1.48 Cxcl10 0.56 1.48 Ccr differentially expressed genes were abundant when comparisons included transcriptional changes induced by A30P virus infections. the mutation played a significant role in the differential regulation of hundreds of genes compared to the WT or A30A\u2032 virus infections in IRF3//7/ MEFs. table 4 shows a list of variants detected within the WT (15/52) and A30A\u2032 (15/51) sequence collections and represent rare variants. reads were observed on both sequence strands and were observed in a least 25 independent sequence reads. 0.020 A30A\u2032 253 t 3151 tG 59,6> 0.021 A30A\u2032 826 t 3780 tC 0,38> 0.010 A30A\u2032 831 a 3171 aT 0,39> 0.012 A30A\u2032 835 a 3007 aC 1,36> 0.012 A30A\u2032 1201 g 2552 gA 42,3> 0.018 A30A\u2032 1203 a 2896 a the critical 3615 position suggests that WT genome pool does contain mutated genomes unable to elicit PRF events. an unexplored consequence of PRF in the NS2A gene of flaviviruses is its potential impact on altering the expression of viral proteins. the occurrence of PRF should affect translation of all non-structural proteins. a replicon system where the structural genes were replaced by galactosidase (-gal) gene was employed. a Western blot was performed to measure the accumulation of -gal protein and NS proteins (NS3 and NS5) in cells electroporated with WNVKUN Rep-WT and Rep-A30A\u2032 RNAs. NS2A-A30A\u2032 mutation decreased both, -gal/NS3 and -gal/NS5 ratio by 20%40% relatively to Rep-WT. results are in line with the frequency of PRF events reported for WT virus [23] structural proteins assemble into viral particles that are secreted into media during viral secretion. this is likely to reduce the amount of intracellular structural proteins available in cell lysates. the addition of BFA late in the infection drastically reduces the amounts of secreted structural proteins (virions) without affecting viral protein synthesis. we inoculated groups of ten HOSPs with 1500PFU of WT WNVNY99 and A30A\u2032 mutant WNVNY99 viruses. we collected serum daily for 7 days after infection to analyze virus titers by plaque assay on BHK cells. we inoculated groups of ten HOSPs with 1500 PFU of WNVNY99 and A30A\u2032 mutant WNVNY99 viruses. bled daily for 7 days after infection to analyze virus titers by plaque assay on BHK cells. groups of ten HOSPs infected with 1500PFU of each virus. bled daily for 7 days after infection. lack of PRF/NS1\u2032 affected the ability for the virus to replicate in the mosquito body. the titers in the bodies and saliva expectorates were significantly lower (P0.0001) in mosquitoes infected with A30A\u2032 and A30P, than those in the WT viruses. titers in the bodies and saliva expectorates were determined by inoculation of ten-fold dilutions of the filtered homogenates. a one-way ANOVA was employed to determine significant differences in mean viral titers within the mosquito bodies and saliva expectorates. we also examined the ability for the virus to replicate in and be transmitted by Cx. annulirostris after IT inoculation. bypassing the midgut produced higher rates of infection with the mutant viruses, with almost all mosquitoes becoming infected. this potentially led to the lower transmission rate observed in the mutant viruses when compared to the WT virus. the presence or absence of PRF/NS1\u2032 production impacted the ability of the mutated replicon to be encapsidated into virus-like particles. this is in contradiction to the findings of Winkelmann et al. who found that abolishment of PRF and NS1\u2032 production impacted the ability of the mutated replicon to be encapsidated. differentially expressed genes in response to A30P infection include transcription factors, anti-apoptotic signals, and thermo-tolerance factors. further studies are required to determine the role for the host genes shown the most differences in induction/repression between WT and A30P or A30A\u2032 and A30P viruses in WNV-host interactions. this is the first time that the effect of the PRF on the expression of flavivirus proteins has been demonstrated. we hypothesize that such \u201cexcess\u201d of structural proteins may lead to an increase in prM-E particles and/or act as an elegant modulator of viral protein expression. the difference between in vitro and in vivo results is often seen for the bird phenotype. the difference between in vitro and in vivo results is often seen for the bird phenotype. a role in replication of PRF/NS1\u2032 in birds and mosquitoes would explain the phenotypes observed. the PRF motif is highly conserved among the JEV serocomplex viruses that utilize both Culex mosquito vector and avians as their primary vertebrate replication hosts. other flaviviruses that utilize primate and Aedes vectors such as Dengue virus 1\u20134 and Yellow fever viruses or rodents and ticks have not demonstrated to encode PRF. the results presented herein show the role of PRF as mechanism for modulating the stoichiometric ratio of structural to non- electroporation Linearized DNA template from KUNV replicon plasmids was transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche) as per manufacturer instructions. cells were then resuspended in 10 ml of DMEM containing 5% FCS, seeded into culture plates, and incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 and humid conditions. cells were seeded into 24-well plates and infected at MOI 0.01. infected cells were fixed and permeabilised at 24, 36, 48, 60 hours post infection. cells were stained for 1 h with mouse anti-E monoclonal antibodies 3.91D. microarray analysis Low passage primary WT and IRF3//7/ MEFs were infected with WT, A30A\u2032, or A30P viruses at MOI of 1. At 48 hpi total RNA was extracted with Trizol and an Illumina DNA microarray was run on 16 samples. the raw signal intensity was extracted from the encrypted binary.idat files using the IDATreader package. protein analysis Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and with NuPAGE LDS sample loading buffer (Invitrogen) for 20 min and heated at 95% for 3 min before loading total protein samples (10 l) onto a 15-well precast Express PAGE gel. membranes were washed 3 times with TBST (at least 5 min each time) and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS. HOSPs were trapped by seed-baited ground traps in Larimer County, Colorado. birds were bled and sera assayed for neutralizing antibodies against WNV and SLEVs. mosquitoes were colonized from material collected from the Boondall Wetlands, Brisbane, Australia in 1998. previous experiments had demonstrated high infection and transmission rates with a wild type WNVKUN strain in this colony of Cx. annulirostris. the bodies, legs and wings were placed in separate 2 ml vials containing 1 ml of growth media with 3% FCS and three sterile 5 mm glass beads. samples were filtered through a 0.2 m Supor membrane filter (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) to reduce bacterial and fungal contamination. plates were incubated at 28\u00b0C in the absence of CO2. orates were analysed using multiple factor ANOVA test. homogeneity of variance was considered statistically significant. all analyses were performed using R and/or GraphPad statistical packages. ml of DMEM containing 5% FCS was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) after transfer of total RNA onto nitrocellulose membrane viral genome-specific RNAs were detected by hybridization with KUNV 3\u2032-UTR-specific probe. for in-situ X-gal staining replicon-transfected cells in a 24-well plate were washed with PBS, fixed with 500 l 4% paraformaldehy cells were imaged using IN-cell 1000 analyser (GE Healthcare) at the required excitation and emission wavelengths. percentage of E-positive cells (% infected) was determined using IN-Cell 1000 Workstation software. differential expression was defined when a gene had a log-fold-change of 1 or >1. error correction for the p-values was performed according to methods described by Benjamini and Hochberg. proteins were separated by electrophoresis at 120 V for 1 h and transferred to PDVF membrane (GE Healthcare) for 1.5 h at 45 V using a wet transfer apparatus. membranes were washed 3 times with TBST (at least 5 min each time) and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS. ten HOSPs were inoculated subcutaneously in the breast region by 28-gauge needle. inoculated HOSPs were bled once daily by jugular venipuncture through 7 dpi. 0.1 mL of whole blood was drawn and expelled into a cryovial containing 0.45 mL of BA-1 media. 5\u201310 day old mosquitoes were inoculated with 220 nl of virus suspension. mosquitoes were maintained on 10% sucrose at 28\u00b0C, high relative humidity and a 12L12D lighting regime. saliva was collected by inserting the proboscis into a capillary tube containing 25 L of growth media with 3% FCS. the filtrates were inoculated into the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. plates were incubated at 28\u00b0C in the absence of CO2. the bodies and saliva expectorates were titrated as ten-fold dilutions. the legs and wings were assessed for infection only."}
