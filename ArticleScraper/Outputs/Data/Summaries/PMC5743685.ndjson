{"summary": "introduction canine distemper virus (CDV), a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, causes a severe highly contagious lethal disease in carnivores, such as dogs, lions, ferrets, raccoon dogs, foxes, and minks. the disease is distributed worldwide and is characterized by respiratory and gastrointestinal tract symptoms with generalized immunosuppression. the infection of various viruses has been demonstrated to interact widely with host cell proteins. some interactions elicit changes in the host proteome upon virus infection. many studies have reported the effects of CDV infections on the host cell proteins. pathogenesis for several viral pathogens, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human influenza A (Vester et al., 2009), canine parvovirus (CPV) (Zhao et al., 2016), marek's disease virus (MDV) (Chien et al., 2016) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have emerged as a powerful quantitative proteomic technique. isolate (7 passages) of the virus from a morbid dog in 2013 was preserved in our laboratory. three additional passages of the virus were performed in Mv.1.Lu cells. the virus was propagated in vero cells. viral propagation was confirmed by observation of the CPE. the one-step growth curve was generated according to Chuzo ushimi. qRT-PCR was applied to detect the viral RNA at each indicated time. iTRAQ 116, 117, or 118 were labeled with iTRAQ 116, 117, or 118. the labeled samples were then mixed and dried with a rotary vacuum concentrator. peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. the LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, U.S.A.) the mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. MS data was acquired using a data-dependent top 10 method. methyl (C), iTRAQ8-plex (N-term) and iTRAQ8-plex (K) as fixed modifications. the strict maximum parsimony principle was performed. only peptide spectra with high or medium confidence were considered. real-time RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, U.S.A.) from Mv.1.Lu cells infected with 2 MOI PS or mock-infected cells at 12 and 24 hpi. after treatment with gDNA Removal, 4 g of each total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. cell lysates were harvested at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hpi from PS-, CDV3-, and mock-infected cultures. for confirmation of the data by western blotting, cell lysates were harvested at 12 and 24 hpi from PS-, CDV3-, and mock-infected cultures. primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. the protein bands were detected using the ECL Detection Kit (Beyotime, China) cell culture and virus infection Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv.1.Lu cells) were purchased from the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) they were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco \u00aeInvitrogen, U.S.A.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the TCID50 was calculated using the Reed-Muench formula. because of the low virus titer and the impurity of the virus suspension, virus concentration and purification were performed to improve the virus titer. the cells were collected at 24 hpi for the protein extraction. three biological replicates were prepared for all samples. all experiments were performed under Biosafety Level 2 conditions. the peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with a gradient of buffer B (500 mM KCl, 10 mM KH2PO4 in 25% of ACN, pH 3.0) the elution was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. each fraction was injected for nanoLC-MS/MS analysis. survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200. resolution for HCD spectra was set to 17,500 at m/z 200. the isolation width was 2 m/z. iTRAQ 113, 114, and 115 were used as references. GO enrichment on three ontologies was applied based on the Fisher's exact test. only functional categories with p-values under a threshold of 0.05 were considered significant. the primers for amplifying TRAF6, TRAF2, IRAK4, IRAK2, NFB2, CCL2, TNF-, IL-6, and GAPDH are presented in Table 1. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. the relative gene expression was calculated using the 2CT model. cell lysates were harvested at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hpi from PS-, CDV3-, and mock-infected cultures. the protein bands were detected using the ECL Detection Kit (Beyotime, China) the GAPDH protein was used as an internal control. BIB (IB-) rabbit polyclonal antibody (PA5-40909, ThermoFisher, U.S.A), RPS29 rabbit polyclonal antibody (4812, CST, U.S.A), Phospho-NF-B p65 rabbit polyclonal antibody (MA5-15181, ThermoFisher, U.S.A), and GAPDH rabbit polyclonal antibody (CW0101M, CWB an optimal time point under PS infection for proteomic analysis was then identified. up to 36 hpi, an obvious CPE was observed and nearly 50 percent of the cells were detached at 48 hpi. a high viral load was maintained and most cells showed little CPE. iTRAQ-coupled LC\u2013MS/MS analysis identified and measured 37,145 peptides and 6184 proteins. 151 and 369 proteins were markedly up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively. receptor-associated kinase 4 2.08 gi|511851258 APOA1 Apolipoprotein A-I 2.03 gi|511858549 TSPAN8 Tetraspanin

involved in the immune response process were detected. 13 strongly interacting proteins were interestingly grouped into a functional set chiefly associated with the NF-B signaling pathway. the iTRAQ-MS data was confirmed by western blotting or real-time RT-PCR. we selected significantly changed proteins, including NF-B1, RelA, MHC-I, RPS29, and NFBIB, which reliably cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies to the corresponding human proteins. however, due to the limitation of the availability of antibodies to Neovison vison proteins, the confirmation of DEPs was restricted. 8 different expression proteins related to NF-B pathway tested using real-time RT-PCR method. each gene was performed in three independent experiments. error bars represent the standard error for triplicate samples. NF-B P65 showed apparent nuclear translocation in PS-infected cells. expression of phosphorylated p65 and IB- was also detected in CDV3-infected cells. CDV infection strengthened NF-B P65 phosphorylation and degradation. the fluorescent images were analyzed under a confocal microscopy. discussion CDV infection commonly causes a severe lethal disease in carnivores, including minks. the molecular mechanisms involved in viral pathogenesis and host immune responses have not been fully elucidated. NF-kB has been reported as activated following various viral infections of porcine parvovirus (Cao et al., 2017), type 2 porcine circovirus (Wei et al., 2008), and herpes simplex type 1 (Patel et al., 1998). NF-kB activation has previously been shown in MV infection (Helin et al., 2001) the activation of NF-B p65 in CDV3-infected Mv.1.Lu cells also confirmed these findings. the previous finding that NF-B activation was found in human cells after CDV (Onderstepoort strain) challenge. these findings enriched the current knowledge of NF-B activation by CDV infection. inflammasome NLRP3, known as the NOD-like-receptor-family, pyrin domain-containing 3, recognizes several RNA viruses. NF-B-induced activation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1 gene expression is required for activating caspase-1 by the NLRP3 inflammasome. the NHERF, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, commonly locates or becomes enclosed in the intestinal brush border, thereby binding to the renal proximal tubule brush border Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 protein. this protein is responsible for the absorption of electroneutral salt in the intestine and is the most essential sodium absorptive transporter. previous reports have demonstrated that NHERF down-regulation leads to reduced Na+ absorption though affecting NHE3 activity the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway is responsible for a wide variety of cellular functions. the activation of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway is required for influenza virus replication (Widjaja et al., 2010) and is also required for other viruses. ISGylation involves the co-operation of E1, E2, E3 and an ISG15-specific isopeptidase enzyme. TRIM33 functions in monocyte/macrophage mediated inflammation. ubiquitination appeared to be a pivotal regulatory mechanism in the immune responses to CDV infection in mink. CDV induces apoptosis in the cerebellum and lymphoid tissues of the natural infection of dogs and in vero cells in vitro. this finding was consistent with previous reports showing that CDV induces apoptosis in the cerebellum and lymphoid tissues.
