{"summary": "neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the onset and development of neurodegeneration disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. immune tolerance refers to the unresponsiveness of the immune system to continuous or repeated stimulation to avoid excessive inflammation and unnecessary by-stander injury. repeated intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 mg/kg LPS for 4 days induced peripheral immune tolerance of PBM. monocytes were restimulated by a single high-dose LPS (100 ng) for 4 h in vitro. striatal injection of 15 g LPS induced significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. the results implied that striatal injection of 15 g LPS induced significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN."}
