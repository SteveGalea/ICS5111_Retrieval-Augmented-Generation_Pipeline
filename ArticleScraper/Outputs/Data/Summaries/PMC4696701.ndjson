{"summary": "samples from 7 patients identified as positive for MERS-CoV were sequenced. these patients were identified by using sequences upstream of the envelope protein gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1a in real-time reverse transcription PCRs (5). index case-patient 1 (PAT001) had traveled to Bahrain, the united arab emirates, and Saudi Arabia during April 24\u2013May 4, 2015. after visiting a local clinic, his symptoms worsened, and he was hospitalized on may 15. he shared a room with PAT003 and the same ward with PAT009, PAT012, PAT013, and PAT015. PCR products were pooled and fragmented to an average of 300 bp. a sequencing library was constructed by using the Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA Sample Prep Kit. 131 reference MERS-CoV S gene sequences from GenBank and MERS-CoV Sequences were aligned by using MUSCLE software (9) phylogenetic analysis of 139 spike glycoprotein gene sequences was performed using RAxML software. tree was visualized with FigTree v.1.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree). clades of MERS-CoV are indicated in bold. 183 258 409 1586 1588 1848 1886 3177 3267 (61) (86) (137) (529) (530) (616) (629) (1059) (1059) (1089) JX869059_HCoV-EMC_2012 C (G) T (V) A (S) T (I) G (V) T (V) G (R) T (D) C (S) KR011266_KSA_Hu/Riyad \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/001_05_2015 [PAT001] \u2022 C (V) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 MERS-CoV strain ChinaGD01 (KT006149) of 8 nucleotide substitutions, 4 were nonsynonymous. 2 nonsynonymous variants (S137R, I529T, V530L, and R629H) were identified in isolates from PAT002. this mutation rate for the S gene was higher than that for complete MERV-CoV genomes in other studies. more data are required to demonstrate the pattern of MERS-CoV evolution during the outbreak in south Korea because results are limited by a relatively low number of sequences."}
