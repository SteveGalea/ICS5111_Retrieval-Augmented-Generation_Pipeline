{"summary": "broad cross-reactive HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in vivo is rare. it is likely due to protection of conserved structures of the virus envelope glycoprotein (Env) by variable loops, extensive glycosylation, occlusion within the oligomer, and conformational masking. only several exhibit neutralizing activity to primary isolates from different clades. we have previously analyzed the sequences of all known bnAbs. we have found that they are highly divergent from germline antibodies. we have hypothesized that the relatively high degree of specific somatic hypermutations may preclude binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein to closest germline antibodies. the hybrid between the mature X5 heavy chain and its germline-like light chain bound better than did the germline-like X5 but similarly to the mature X5. this hybrid bound weaker than the germline X5 (Figure 1d) scFv X5 neutralized a subset of pseudoviruses neutralized by the mature X5. the mature X5 neutralized all of them efficiently at the concentration used. the germline-like X5 neutralized all of them efficiently at the concentration used. ovirus infection by mature and germline scFv X5 was tested with a single concentration of both X5 original and germline. the concentration of scFv used is 600 nM. the names of the Envs used are shown on the X-axis. the single concentration used for each antibody was 2.5 M. 2.4. identification of possible b12 intermediates in the maturation pathway of b12. samples 1\u20139 are original, germline, A52P/G53Y, G53Y, math/germl, germh/matl, G53D, A52P/T57K, and A52P. the bindings by the selected scFv were analyzed against bal gp120 in an ELISA. germline-like b12 consistently showed no binding even at the highest concentration. all the b12 intermediates competed with sCD4 for binding to gp120. the competition was proportional to their binding abilities. the bound sCD4 was detected with anti-his-HRP. DB, did not bind; N/A, did not test; \u201c>M\u201d, binding affinity in the range above M. Germh/matl, germline heavy chain fused with mature light chain. nine HIV Env-pseudotyped viruses were tested with a panel of scFv-Fc b12 variants. the original-Fc b12 was used at a concentration of 0.3 M, while all the other b12\u2013Fc fusion variants including the germline-Fc b12 were used at a concentration of 2 M. hybrid math/germl and germh/matl antibodies were tested. they showed significantly higher human cell binding approaching the level displayed by the mature b12. these findings indicate that specific binding to Env and self antigens were acquired concomitantly through the b12 maturation process. this hybrid bound weaker than the germline X5 (Figure 1d) in all cases the hybrid molecules bound the Env suggesting that the heavy chain of the mature X5 and likely of the germline-like X5 dominate the interaction. mature and germline-like X5 neutralized all of them efficiently at the concentration used. the germline-like X5 neutralized all of them almost as efficiently as the mature one. but the germline-like X5 lost completely the neutralizing ability against B clade, R5 or dual tropic isolates. IC50s of the mature and germline scFv X5 against representative HIV isolates were used in the neutralization assay. lack of binding of germline-like b12 as scFv and as a bivalent Fc fusion protein to a panel of Envs. in all cases we found that germline-like b12 lacks measurable binding to an Env. all three mutations in H2 of the mature b12 resulted in amino acids that are very different from their germline counterparts. a series of mutants were generated surrounding the germline b12 H2 region as described in the Methods. the bindings by the selected scFv were analyzed against bal gp120 in an ELISA. two concentrations including 8 (bar closer to Y-axis) and 2.7 M of each scFv were used. the maximum value of Y-axis was set at 0.5 to reflect the weak bindings. sCD4 and scFv-Fc b12 showed no competition with sCD4. both mutations, G53Y and A52P, could play a role in pathway from germline b12 to mature b12. b12 construct germline A52P/T57K G53Y A52P/G53Y germh/matl math/germl mature scFv DB DB >M 87.3 nM >M 34.5 nM 1.3 nM scFv-Fc DB N/A N/A >M 29.3 nM >M 2.6 nM 0.4 nM 2.5. b12 neutralized efficiently all isolates from cla the original-Fc b12 was used at a concentration of 0.3 M. for each isolate, the bars represent the percentage of activities of the viruses treated with PBS only, b12-Fc, math/germl-Fc, A52P/G53Y-Fc, germh/matl-Fc, and germline-Fc. Germline-Fc, math/germl-Fc, germh/matl-Fc and original-Fc b12 proteins were used at a concentration of 1 M in the flow cytometry assay. the concentration used remained at 1 M. the epitope of m1a1 overlaps significantly more with that of the mature X5 than with germline X5. the subsequent mutations expanded its targets to include B clades, X4 tropic isolates and those from other clades. it remains to be seen if other CD4i antibodies possess antigen binding and neutralizing abilities as observed with X5. a single mutation, G53Y, conferred detectable germline-like b12 binding to Env. this suggests that this scenario is possible. however, similar to X5 b12 was selected through phage display procedure. codon-optimized sCD4 D1-2 was cloned into expression vector pSecTag2B. transfected into 293 freestyle cells and expressed according to manufacturer's suggested protocol. the secreted sCD4 D1-2 was purified using a Nickle column. a collection of germline b12 variants containing one, two or three residues from mature b12 form were generated through this process. single clone was inoculated into 2YT supplemented with 100 units of ampicillin, 0.2 % glucose and incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking. cells were then collected, lysed with polymyxin B (Sigma, St Louis) in PBS. the mouse-anti-His-HRP was used to detect the scFv-Fc and IgG bindings in most of the ELISA. the mouse-anti-human Fc-HRP was used to detect the scFv-Fc and IgG bindings. gene synthesis and expression plasmid constructions were synthesized by Genescript (Genescript, Piscatawy, NJ) the scFv fragment was cloned into the pComb3X plasmid for expression in bacteria. the scFv fragments were fused with human IgG1 and cloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pSecTag2B (Invitrogen) inoculated into 2YT supplemented with 100 units of ampicillin, 0.2 % glucose and incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking. cells were then collected, lysed with polymyxin B (Sigma, St Louis) in PBS. scFv-Fc and IgG proteins were purified using a protein-A sepharose column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) s were analyzed using the weighted least-squares fitting of data to the function (Hill equation). 4.6."}
