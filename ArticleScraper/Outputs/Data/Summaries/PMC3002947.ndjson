{"summary": "experimental adenovirus-based vaccine vectors are promising alternatives to conventional vaccine platforms. human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) vectors are well-characterized and are being developed against several infectious disease models. chimeric simian adenovirus 21 vector protected mice against lethal Ebolavirus challenge and generated robust T-cell responses. the external hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein mediates receptor binding, fusion, and can generate both strong antibody and cell-mediated immune responses [16]. despite the limited incidence of human-to-human-transmission, high mortality rates (>60%) and continuous evolution of the virus represent a concern for future influenza pandemics. human sera was neutralized at the highest dilution of 1160 (6.25103 mg/ml human Ig) neutralization of PAV3 was not detected at 120 (5.0102 mg/ml), the lowest dilution tested. a robust antibody response is important for the prevention of influenza virus infection. an HI assay was performed using serial dilutions of the treated serum combined with H5N1-H05 virus and horse red blood cells to detect inhibition of cell agglutination. the reciprocal of the highest dilution which did not agglutinate red blood cells was scored as the HI antibody titre. serum was obtained from groups of 4 BALB/c mice on days 8, 10, 14 and 21 post-vaccination with 1010 vp/mouse of PAV3-HA or AdHu5-HA. HI antibody titre was determined as reciprocal of highest serum dilution with absence of CPE. serum from 25 days post-immunization was also monitored for NAB titre. the data represent average values and standard deviations from 3 to 5 experiments. the presence of neutralizing antibodies to inhibit active H5N1-H05 infection was also evaluated. a reference HI antibody titre of 40 is recommended for influenza vaccine candidates. both vaccines met this requirement at all doses prior to challenge. a strong antibody response is important for immediate and long-term protection against influenza viruses. the number of sfc/million splenocytes detected at day 8 was statistically significant between PAV3-HA and AdHu5-HA vaccines. the H05-HA immunodominant epitope also stimulated the strongest T-cell responses on day 8 for the PAV3-HA vaccine compared to AdHu5-HA. mouse spleens were harvested 8, 10, 14 and 21 days post-immunization. positive responses for IFN secretion were determined. bars represent the total number of spot-forming cells/million mononuclear cells for all peptide pools combined. cells were stained with anti-mouse CD8-FITC and an anti-mouse IFN-PE. the frequency of IFN positive CD8+ T-cells was 3.40.3 and 2.80.3 percent for PAV3-HA or AdHu5-HA, respectively. the success of rapid vaccination regimen was evaluated in two parts. virus titers were 3.571066.26106, 1.401064.87106, and 4.821066.57106 TCID50/g, for days 5, 8, and 10 respectively. the PAV3-HA vaccine was associated with significantly lower viral load in animals vaccinated at both days 5 and 8 compared to AdHu5-HA. Lungs were harvested from the mice on day 3 post-challenge. TCID50 titre was determined using serial dilution of lung homogenates on MDCK cells. data is presented as log10 TCID50/g of lung tissue. higher HI antibody titers for PAV3-HA compared to AdHu5-HA. NAB titers were 2315 and 1011 for AdHu5-HA. ELISA assay also performed to detect total IgG antibody titres. serum was collected 12 months post-vaccination from mice immunized with PAV3-HA () or AdHu5-HA () HI and NAB responses were evaluated. data represent average values and standard deviation from one experiment performed with one vector preparation of each vaccine. expression of the PAV3-HA and AdHu5-HA vaccines was evaluated in VRIBL E1, HEK 293, and mouse AB12 cells. in vivo expression of PAV3-HA or AdHu5-HA in muscle tissue was detected 4 days post-immunization. a robust antibody response is important for the prevention of influenza virus infection. transgene expression was detected by Western Blot using anti-H5N1 mouse sera and a goat anti-mouse-HRP secondary antibody. M = Marker, Lane 1 = expression of AdHu5-HA in HEK 293 cells, Lane 2 = expression of PAV3-HA in VRIBLE1 cells, Lanes 3 and 4 expression of PAV3-HA and PAV3-HA in mouse syngenic AB12 cells. serum from obtained on 8, 10, 14, and 21 days post-vaccination with 1010 vp/mouse of PAV3-HA or AdHu5-HA. serial dilutions of was also incubated with 100 pfu of H5N1-H05 virus, added to MDCK cells and monitored for the presence of cytopathic effects. HI reciprocal titres of 986326, 1093293, and 1280 for the PAV3-HA vaccine or 1066330, 1066330, and 1173261 with AdHu5-HA were detected for 108, 109 or 1010 vp/mouse doses respectively. both vaccines met this requirement at all doses prior to challenge. the peptide corresponding to the immunodominant H5N1-H05 HA epitope was evaluated alongside an unrelated control peptide (TYQRTRALV, A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1 nucleoprotein) the cells were restimulated with pools of overlapping peptides corresponding to the entire H05-HA protein. 178 or 1,36436 sfc/million were detected from PAV3-HA or AdHu5-HA immunized mice respectively. T-cell responses of 77074 and 45384 were detected from PAV3-HA or 79158 and 59084 from AdHu5-HA at days 14 and 21 post-immunization. spleens were harvested 8, 10, 14, and 21 days post-immunization. bars represent the total number of spot-forming cells/106 mononuclear cells. data represent average values and standard deviations from 3 experiments. cellular responses following vaccination with PAV3-HA were further characterized by detecting the relative frequency of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells expressing IFN- by flow cytometry. BALB/c mice were challenged with a lethal dose of H5N1-H05 virus at 5, 8 and 10 days post-vaccination. animals challenged 8 days post-vaccination experienced significantly greater survival with the PAV3-HA vaccine than for AdHu5-HA (11% survival) both vaccines were fully protective with minimal signs of disease when administered 10 days prior to challenge. group of 6 BALB/c were vaccinated with 1010 vp/mouse of PAV3-HA or AdHu5-HA. challenged with 100LD50 of H5N1-H05 on days 5, 8, and 10 post-vaccination. data represent average values and standard deviations from 2 experiments performed with 2 independent vector preparations of each vaccine. protection against clinical signs of disease with minimal weight loss and full survival was observed at the 1010 vp/mouse dose for both Ad-based vaccines. the PAV3-HA vaccinated mice were either asymptomatic or having milder signs of disease (14% weight loss) compared to AdHu5-HA (21% weight loss). 20 days post-vaccination, the mice were challenged with 100LD50 of H5N1-H05 virus and monitored for (i) survival and (ii) weight loss and clinical signs of disease. long-term protection was evaluated in groups of six BALB/c mice vaccinated with PAV3-HA 109 () vp/mouse, AdHu5-HA 108 (), 109 (), and 1010 (), or PBS Control (\u2022). the final development of a new adenovirus serotype to approved human vaccines has been hampered by the presence of natural pre-existing immunity to AdHu5 which is present in a large fraction of the human population. a new adenovirus serotype also increases the spectrum of possible applications such as sequential vaccination with other adenovirus vectors. a 109 vp/mouse dose was observed after vaccination with PAV3-HA. greater weight loss was observed with the AdHu5-HA vaccine. the exact levels of neutralizing antibodies correlating with full protection from infection with homologous virus is still uncertain. re-administration did not result in hepatotoxicity or reduced transgene expression. several pathologies including liver damage indicated by elevated transaminase, low platelets count, and lymphocytopenia were observed in nonhuman primates administered similar doses [9], [10], [34], [35]. adenoviral vectors can rapidly generate a strong immune response. human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) and mouse AB12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamate, sodium pyruvate (NaPyr) and antibiotics. all infectious recombinant adenovirus constructs were propagated on HE the H5N1 hemagglutinin (H05-HA) gene was first cloned into the pCAG plasmid to generate the pCAG-HA construct. the pCAG-HA expression cassette was then excised and inserted into two shuttle vector systems. transfer plasmid pPAV227 was also modified to include the SV40 polyadenylation signal from pShuttle2. pFPAV227-HA was generated through homologous recombination. HEK 293 cells were transfected with 10 g of linearized pAdenoX-HA DNA. cells were cultured until the appearance of cytopathic effects. expression of recombinant adenovirus PAV3-HA or AdHu5-HA was confirmed in HEK 293, VRIBL E1 and AB12 cells using standard Western blotting techniques. muscles were homogenized and normalized per gram of muscle tissue in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. ELISPOT-IFN plates were coated with purified mouse IFN. overlapping 15mer peptides spanning entire H05-HA protein were resuspended overnight in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and allocated in pools by matrix format. s were visualized and counted using an ELISPOT plate reader. cells were restimulated with 9mer H05-HA, PR8-NP, or 8mer ZGP individual peptides in DMEM. cells were stimulated for 5 hours and stained with anti-mouse CD8-FITC. uent mixed with 100 pfu/well of homologous A/Hanoi/30408/2005 virus. hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays performed in phosphate buffered saline. 50 l/well was added to a 96-well V-bottom microtiter plate. 96-well plates were coated with 1 ug/ml H5 HA antigen overnight at 4\u00b0C. after three washes, a goat anti-mouse conjugated to HRP was applied as the secondary antibody for 45 minutes. a 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution was added to react with the HRP conjugate and incubated in the dark for 20 minutes.
