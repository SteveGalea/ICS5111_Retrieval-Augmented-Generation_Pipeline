{"summary": "ICTV recognizes 7 orders, 104 families, 23 subfamilies, 505 genera, and 3186 viral species (2). the number of viral families without an order is expected to continue to increase, especially with the discovery of novel viruses from atypical environments. FFs include domains that are typically more than 30% identical in their sequence composition. FFs group FFs with common 3D structural cores and biochemical properties, albeit with low sequence identity (could be 15%). Hence, FSFs are more conserved in evolution and suitable for deep evolutionary comparisons (5, 12). cellular data set included 1620 proteomes from 122, 1115, and 383 organisms from the superkingdoms archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. analysis revealed that, despite high levels of diversity, viral proteomes retain traces of ancient evolutionary history that can be recovered using advanced bioinformatics approaches. the model for the origin and evolution of the \u201cviral supergroup\u201d captures the many aspects of viral diversity. a total of 1995 significant FSF domains (E 0.0001) were detected in 11 million proteins of 5080 proteomes sampled from cells and viruses. the remaining FSFs (716) either were shared between cells and viruses. the gains were more common in Eukarya (283 FSFs) and Bacteria (154 FSFs) than in Archaea (24 FSFs) and viruses (66 FSFs) the 66 virus-specific FSFs (VSFs) include domains involved in viral pathogenicity. FSFs were referenced by either SCOP ID or css. for example, the P-loop containing NTP hydrolase is c.37.1, where \u201cc\u201d is the / class of secondary structure present in the protein domain, \u201c37\u201d is the fold, and \u201c1\u201d is the FSF. dsDNA 56548 d.180.1 V Conserved core of transcriptional regulatory protein vp16 dsDNA 90246 h.1.24 V Head morphogenesis protein gp7 dsDNA 47724 a.54.1 V Domain of early E2A DNA binding protein, ADDBP dsDNA 57917 g.51.1 V Soluble secret chemokine inhibitor, VCCI dsDNA 89428 b.126.1 bacteriophage procapsid ssDNA 50176 b.37.1 V N-terminal domains of the minor coat protein g3p ssDNA 75404 d.213.1 V VSV matrix protein Minus-ssRNA 118173 d.293.1 V Phosphoprotein M1, C-terminal domain Minus-ssRNA 69922 f.12.1 V Head and neck region of the ectodomain of NDV fusion glycoprotein Min Plus-ssRNA 101816 b.140.1 V Replicase NSP9 Plus-ssRNA 140367 a.8.9 V Coronavirus NSP8\u2013like Plus-ssRNA 143076 d.302.1 V Coronavirus NSP8\u2013like Plus-ssRNA 144246 g.86.1 V Coronavirus NSP10\u2013like Plus-ssRNA 103068 d.254.1 V Accessory protein X4 (ORF8, ORF7a like ssRNA binding domain dsRNA 82856 e.42.1 EV L-A virus major coat protein dsRNA 140809 a.260.1 EV Rhabdovirus nucleoprotein\u2013like Minus-ssRNA 101399 a.206.1 EV P40 nucleoprotein Minus-ssRNA 55405 d.85.1 EV RNA bacteriophage capsid protein Minus-ssRNA 68918 a BV Clostridium neurotoxins, \u201ccoiled-coil\u201d domain dsDNA 47681 a.49.1 BV Tetramerization domain of the Mnt repressor dsDNA 54328 d.15.5 BV Staphylokinase/streptokinase dsDNA 64465 d.196.1 BV Outer capsid protein sigma 3 dsRNA 57987 h.1.4 EV STIV B116-like dsDNA 58064 h.3.1 ABEV Influenza hemagglutinin (stalk) dsDNA, minus-ssRNA Table 2 Significantly enriched \u201cbiological process\u201d GO terms in (66 +43) VSFs (FDR 0.01).

BV FSFs were part of our selection, suggesting that a large number of BV FSFs originated in viruses. bacterioviruses are known to mediate gene exchange between bacterial species (25), our finding is biologically significant and less likely attributable to mistakes in HMM assignments. most viral proteins were restricted to a single viral subgroup. some could be candidates of virus-to-virus HGT during coinfection of a common host. some could be candidates of virus-to-virus HGT during coinfection. the global nature of viral proteomes must be considered when speculating about viral origins. we plotted FSF use and reuse for viruses and only \u201cfree-living\u201d organisms that eliminated the overlap between large dsDNA viruses and microbial parasites. this suggests that proteomes of viruses, especially giant dsDNA viruses, are similar in size to many well-known cellular parasites. 1022 FSFs were encoded by archaeal proteomes. 533 (52%) were shared only with Bacteria and Eukarya. 465 (45%) were also shared with viruses. eukaryal proteomes encoded a total of 1661 FSFs. median f value in archaea for FSFs shared only with cells was 0.45. medians increased from 0.30 to 0.62 (up by 106%) in Bacteria and increased most significantly from 0.39 to 0.93 (up by 138%) in Eukarya. virus mediated spread of these FSFs by serving as vehicles of gene transfer. a large number of DNA viruses (mostly Caudovirales) infected prokaryotic hosts. the bias in the distribution of replicon types in superkingdoms leads to an interesting possibility about the early origin of RNA viruses and their loss in prokaryotes. to date, no virus is known to infect organisms in more than one superkingdom. it simply refers to the count of FSFs shared between archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses. f values were averaged for all FSFs in each of the seven Venn groups defined in (B) in archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal proteomes. we found that viruses infecting species in each of the three superkingdoms shared a total of 68 FSFs. FSFs in a, b, or e Venn groups could be more influenced by HGT. they represent viruses infecting only a single superkingdom. 198 FSFs unique to bacterioviruses could be a result of HGT. the evolution of viruses follows a bidirectional route influenced by the vertical inheritance of a structural core present in many distantly related viruses. this is in line with previous understanding that eukaryoviruses are very distinct from archaeoviruses (46) adenovirus-like (characterized by the double jelly-roll fold) and HK97-like lineages infect species in the three superkingdoms, suggesting their ancient origin before the divergence of modern cells. adenovirus-like (characterized by the double jelly-roll fold) and HK97-like lineages infect species in the three superkingdoms, suggesting their ancient origin before the divergence of modern cells. major capsid protein gp5 HK97-like 0.2352 103417 e.48.1 Major capsid protein VP5 HK97-like 0.00006 88633 b.121.4 Positive stranded ssRNA viruses Picornavirus-like 0.00364 88645 b.121.5 ssDNA viruses Picornavirus-like 0 88648 b.121.6 Group I dsDNA viruses Picornavirus-like 0 0 50176 b.37.1 N-terminal domains of the minor coat protein g3p Other/unclassified 0 103068 d.254.1 Nucleocapsid protein dimerization domain Other/unclassified 0 Viral hallmark architectures in cells. only the \u201cMajor capsid protein gp5\u201d FSF (d.183.1) of Caudovirales (HK97-like lineage) was present in 24% of cellular prote viral capsid/coat FSFs have no SCOP structural relatives. rare capsid structural homologies in cellular proteomes suggest either instances of virus-to-host HGT or relics of ancient coexistence of cells and viruses. the minus-ssRNA and dsDNA groups circumscribed the most widely shared FSFs. a seven-set Venn diagram makes explicit the 127 (27 \u2013 1) combinations that are possible with seven groups. ssDNA, minus-ssRNA 88633 b.121.4 Positive stranded ssRNA viruses dsDNA, dsRNA, minus-ssRNA, plus-ssRNA 57850 g.44.1 RING/U-box dsDNA, minus-ssRNA, plus-ssRNA 51283 b.85.4 dUTPase-like dsDNA, dsDNA-RT, s 550 d.93.1 SH2 domain dsDNA, ssRNA-RT 55464 d.89.1 Origin of replication binding domain, RBD-like dsDNA, ssDNA 56399 d.166.1 ADP ribosylation dsDNA, ssDNA 100920 b.130.1 Heat shock protein 70 kD (HSP70), peptide binding domain dsDNA, plus-ssRNA 47413 a lavaminate synthase\u2013like dsDNA, plus-ssRNA 53756 c.87.1 UDP-glycosyltransferase/glycogen phosphorylase dsDNA, dsRNA 81665 f.33.1 Calcium ATPase, transmembrane domain M dsDNA, plus-ssRNA 52949 c.50.1 Macro domain\u2013like dsDNA, plus-ssRNA minus-ssRNA 50630 b.50.1 Acid proteases dsDNA-RT, ssRNA-RT 47459 a.38.1 HLH, helix-loop-helix DNA binding domain dsDNA, ssRNA-RT 50939 b.68.1 Sialidases dsDNA, minus-ssRNA 55166 d.65.1 Hedgehog/DD peptidase dsDNA, s polymerase I, and the catalytic domain of Y-family DNA polymerase, was detected in six of the seven viral subgroups. three additional FSFs, the \u201cP-loop containing NTP hydrolase\u201d (c.37.1), the \u201cRibonuclease H\u2013like\u201d (c.55.3) and the \u201cPositive stranded ssRNA viruses\u201d (b.121.4) were detected in four of the seven viral sub only 19 of the 120 possible Venn subgroups of shared FSFs existed. only 8 of 21 and only 6 of 35 possible subgroups shared by two and three viral groups were present. dsDNA viruses, which hold the largest proteomes, were part of 11 of these 14 Venn subgroups. recombination between RNA and DNA viruses can sometimes generate \u201chybrid\u201d viruses with DNA genomes. a large number of FSFs were shared between viruses belonging to different replicon types. reconstruction of phylogenomic trees of domains (ToD) showed that most viral FSFs originated very early in evolution. toD describe evolution of 1995 FSF domains (taxa) in 5080 proteomes (characters) the bar on top of ToD is simple representation of how FSFs appeared in its branches. FSFs were labeled blue for cell-only and red for those shared with or unique to viruses. the most ancient FSFs found in cells were also shared by very different groups of viruses. the ABEV group was followed by the appearance of the ABE group. the first FSF in ABE was the \u201cACT-like\u201d FSF (d.58.18) the late appearance of VSFs (V group in Fig. 5A) is interesting because it includes FSFs involved in viral pathogenicity. they represent the time point when proto-virocells completely lost their cellular nature. this idea is strengthened by the evolutionary appearances of the AV, BV, and EV groups soon after the FSFs of the superkingdom-specific A, B, and E groups. some of the most popular FSFs again included the P-loop containing NTP hydrolase (c.37.1), DNA/RNA polymerases (e.8.1) and Ribonuclease H\u2013like (c.55.3) FSFs. in turn, the Lysozyme-like FSF was detected in a large number of viruses (18%), mostly bacterioviruses. proteomes of RNA viruses are more ancient than proteomes of DNA viruses A series of experiments determined the relative age of each viral subgroup. in all viruses, regardless of the replicon type, median nd values were very low (see white circles), suggesting that HGT may have played evolutionary roles only very recently. the length of Ariadne\u2019s threads identifies FSFs that were shared by more than three viral subgroups. numbers next to each circle give the mean nd of FSFs shared by each combination. numbers in parentheses give the range between the most ancient and the most recent FSFs that were shared by each combination. base of toP that was distinguishable from cells by 76% bootstrap (BS) support. Bacteria and Eukarya formed monophyletic groups (blue and green circles) supported by 66% and 100% BS. this topology supported an ancient origin of both viruses and Archaea. bActinobacteria, Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Fibrobacter, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes. the most basal taxa corresponded to RNA and retrotranscribing viruses. retrotranscribing viruses originated before bona fide DNA viruses. polydnaviruses encode segmented viral genomes (mostly RNA) in ancient cells. a tree of viruses (ToV) reconstructed from abe core FSFs further confirmed an early origin in RNA viruses. alphaviruses were initially classified by the ICTV under Flaviviridae. but were later assigned their own genera in Togaviridae. both viral families show striking similarities in virion architecture (enveloped and spherical) toP reconstructed from abundance of conserved FSF domains present a \u201cthird\u201d and global view of the evolutionary relationships of viruses. toP also provide interesting information regarding the evolution of virion morphotypes. phylogeny of Fig. 7A was not influenced by processes that could artificially increase genomic abundance. phylogenomic network retained most evolutionary relationships defined earlier by ToP but also recovered a closer grouping of herpesviruses with Podoviridae. proteomes are biological systems that are made up of component parts. each component contributes an age to the overall age of the cellular or viral system. evoPCO method revealed four clouds of proteomes in temporal space that correspond to viruses. topology supports earlier results from comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses. some giant viruses appeared more derived, supporting their ancient coexistence with cells (19, 73) the topology and ordering of proteomes in evoPCO analysis were further supported by a neighbor-joining tree. most populated Venn groups of universal FSFs found in both cells and viruses (ABEV) or shared by archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (ABE) had 442 and 457 FSFs, respectively. the large size of the ABEV group, which is one-fifth of the total FSFs (442), suggests coexistence of ancient viruses and cells. numbers in parentheses indicate the total number of viral proteomes in each group.

RNA viruses infecting the three superkingdoms were also enriched in archaeal proteomes. RNA viruses infecting different superkingdoms share FSFs that were retained during their evolution from ancient cells. this is consistent with Eukarya hosting a large number of viruses from each replicon type. a, bacterioviruses (b), and eukaryoviruses (e) were pooled into the abe Venn group. those shared by viruses infecting two different superkingdoms were pooled into the ab, ae, or be group. those unique to viruses infecting a single superkingdom were pooled into the ab, ae, or be group. viruses infecting species in each of the three superkingdoms shared a total of 68 FSFs. this is a strong indication of both the ancient origin of viruses and their coexistence with ancient cells. FSFs in a, b, or e Venn groups could be more influenced by HGT. this is because they represent viruses infecting only a single superkingdom. a minor role for HGT cannot be ruled out with confidence. 198 FSFs unique to bacterioviruses could be a result of HGT in either direction in Bacteria and viruses. bacterioviruses are known to mediate gene exchange between bacterial species. bacterioviruses are known to mediate gene exchange between bacterial species. icosahedral viruses have been defined mainly for icosahedral viruses. these lineages capture many viral families and attempt to simplify the overall diversity of the virosphere. members of the PRD1/adenovirus-like and HK97-like lineages infect species in the three superkingdoms. have negligible f values in cells 82856 e.42.1 L-A virus major coat protein BTV-like 0.00025 56831 e.28.1 Reovirus inner layer core protein p3 BTV-like 0.00019 48345 a.115.1 A virus capsid protein alpha-helical domain BTV-like 0 56563 d.183.1 Major capsid protein gp5 HK97-like 0.2352 103417 e. 85.1 RNA bacteriophage capsid protein Other/unclassified 0.00006 48045 a.84.1 Scaffolding protein gpD of bacteriophage procapsid Other/unclassified 0 47852 a.62.1 Hepatitis B viral capsid (hbcag) Other/unclassified 0 101257 a.190.1 Flavivirus capsid protein C Other/unclassified 0 50176 b two viral FSFs are part of bacterial carboxysomes. both had an f value of 0 in sampled viral proteomes. this could also be explained by the loss of an ancient capsid protein fold in modern viruses. the number of shared FSFs in each viral subgroup exceeded the number of unique FSFs, except for dsDNA and minus-ssRNA viruses. minus-ssRNA and dsDNA groups circumscribed the most widely shared FSFs. dsDNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, plus-ssRNA 53335 c.66.1 S-Adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases dsDNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, plus-ssRNA 53098 c.55.3 Ribonuclease H\u2013like dsDNA, ssRNA-RT, ssDNA, minus-ssRNA 8 dsDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA-RT 57924 g.52.1 Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat dsDNA, plus-ssRNA 50249 b.40.4 Nucleic acid binding proteins dsDNA, ssDNA 53041 c.53.1 Resolvase-like dsDNA, ssDNA 55550 d.93.1 SH2 domain dsDNA, dsDNA, plus-ssRNA 47794 a.60.4 Rad51 N-terminal domain\u2013like dsDNA, plus-ssRNA 143990 d.336.1 YbiA-like dsDNA, plus-ssRNA 55811 d.113.1 Nudix dsDNA, dsRNA 51197 b.82.2 Clavaminate synthase\u2013like dsDNA, plus-ssRNA 53756 minus-ssRNA 90257 h.1.26 Myosin rod fragments dsDNA, ssRNA-RT 54117 d.9.1 Interleukin 8\u2013like chemokines dsDNA, dsRNA 58069 h.3.2 Virus ectodomain ssRNA-RT, minus-ssRNA 50630 b.50.1 Acid proteases dsDNA-RT, ssRNA-RT 47459 dsDNA, ssRNA-RT 58064 h.3.1 Influenza hemagglutinin (stalk) dsDNA, minus-ssRNA The \u201cDNA/RNA polymerases\u201d FSF (e.8.1), which includes T7 RNA polymerase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of plus-sense and dsRNA viruses, was detected in six of the seven viral subgroups. only 19 of the 120 possible Venn subgroups of shared FSFs existed. only 8 of 21 and only 6 of 35 possible subgroups shared by two and three viral groups were present. dsDNA viruses, which hold the largest proteomes, were part of 11 of these 14 Venn subgroups. RNA viruses define most threads and their proteomes are the most reduced. this leads to speculation that perhaps RNA viruses predated DNA viruses in evolution. recombination between RNA and DNA viruses can sometimes generate \u201chybrid\u201d viruses with DNA genomes but capsids typical of RNA viruses. phylogenetic distance on a relative scale from 0 (most ancient) to 1 (most recent) we plotted FSFs in each of the 15 Venn groups in Fig. 1A against their FSF ages (that is, nd values) boxplots identify the most ancient and derived Venn groups. n group, which includes 442 FSFs encoded by both cells and viruses, was the most ancient group and covered the entire nd axis. the median nd was 0.4, suggesting that at least 50% of ABEV FSFs originated very early in evolution. d.58.18 was most likely \u201clost\u201d (or never gained) in ancient viruses. the late appearance of VSFs (V group in Fig. 5A) is interesting because it includes FSFs involved in viral pathogenicity. this idea is strengthened by the evolutionary appearance of the AV, BV, and EV groups soon after the FSFs of the superkingdom-specific A, B, and E groups. it is possible that this repertoire was provided to eukaryotes from viruses or was simply gained in eukaryoviruses from their eukaryotic hosts through HGT. this repertoire was provided to eukaryotes from viruses or was simply gained in eukaryoviruses from their eukaryotic hosts. viral proteomes encode both very ancient and very derived FSFs. the former group was most likely inherited vertically from the common ancestor of cells and viruses. the latter could be a result of recent HGT gains from cells or shared innovation. unified minus-ssRNA, plus-ssRNA, and dsRNA proteomes were particularly enriched in ancient domains. the length of Ariadne\u2019s threads (colored lines) identifies FSFs shared by more than three viral subgroups. numbers next to each circle give the mean nd of FSFs shared by each combination. a set of 368 proteomes (taxa) were randomly sampled from cells and viruses. the rooted phylogeny dissected proteomes into four supergroups. Viruses formed a distinct paraphyletic group at the base of ToP. aActinobacteria, Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Fibrobacter, Firmicutes, and Thermotogae. the most basal taxa corresponded to RNA and retrotranscribing viruses. these included well-known dsRNA viral families that have segmented genomes. retrotranscribing viruses originated before bona fide DNA viruses. a tree of viruses (ToV) reconstructed from abe core FSFs further confirmed early origin in RNA viruses. toP phylogeny was compared against ICTV and structure-based classifications. the genera Flavivirus (Flaviviridae) and Alphavirus (Togaviridae) were grouped together. both viral families show striking similarities in virion architecture and genome replication strategies. close grouping of all giant viruses supports the proposal of the viral order \"Megavirales\" (71) and a previous reconstruction (19). however, herpesviruses and Caudovirales that share the common HK97 capsid protein fold did not form a single group (47), but they were in close proximity. mapping of virion morphotypes onto ToP likely hints toward the origin of viruses from a limited number of structural designs. however, we caution that morphological similarities may also stem from convergent evolution. the early appearance of virions harboring segmented RNA genomes is remarkable and worthy of further attention. the evolutionary principal coordinate (evoPCO) analysis combines the power of cladistic and phenetic approaches. the distance between proteomes reflects phylogenetic dissimilarity in the age of FSF domain repertoires. each component contributes an age to the overall age of the cellular or viral system. PCO method revealed four clouds of proteomes in temporal space that correspond to viruses and to the three cellular superkingdoms. we inferred viruses as the most ancient supergroup followed by Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, in that order. this topology supports earlier results from comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses. virocells produce viral gametes that are functionally analogous to cellular gametes of sexually reproducing species, which fuse during fertilization. virocells produce viral gametes that are functionally analogous to cellular gametes of sexually reproducing species, which fuse during fertilization. virocells produce viral gametes that are functionally analogous to cellular gametes of sexually reproducing species, which fuse during fertilization. we propose that the encoded genetic makeup define the functionalities of virions, capsids, and replicons that are necessary to complete the reproduction cycle of a virus. we therefore study the proteomic composition of viral replicons to infer viral evolutionary trajectories. this proposal suggests an early origin of self-replicating viral replicons predating the origin of cells. ribosomal machinery and other cellular features were yet to fully materialize. the proto-virocell genomes coexisted in the intracellular environment. primitive capsid-like structures could have been built from folds seen in prokaryotic protein nanocompartments or by formation and secretion of membrane vesicles. modern-day viral capsids store nucleic acids, while prokaryotic protein compartments store enzymes. modern cells frequently secrete membrane vesicles to communicate with other cells. these vesicles are also morphologically similar to spherical viruses. these vesicles can package viral genes and contribute toward viral infection. viruses gain complete access to and control of the cellular machinery to create genes and protein folds. viruses can also pick old or newly created genes from cells, spreading them to other cellular lineages through virus-to-cell gene transfer. a large number of these proteins are likely very ancient. the rapid evolution of class I proteins in viruses after uptake from cells or acquisition from yet-to-be-discovered cellular species is less satisfactory. the latter scenario posits a decrease in the number of VSFs with the sampling of more cellular genomes, which has not been observed. our discovery of 66 bona fide VSFs and 43 additional VSFs in cellular proteomes is additional support for this argument. together, we argue that the gene-creation and gene-transfer abilities of viruses have been significantly underestimated by some authors [for example, (76)]. the viral mode of life originated more than once in evolution. the support for a monophyletic origin is weak but could be explained by reductive evolution. some ancient FSFs were shared by four to six viral subgroups including mostly RNA viruses. archaeal membrane lipids are different from bacterial and eukaryal membranes. fusion or archaeal-ancestor scenarios posit the transition of archaeal membrane into bacterial/eukaryal membrane. both scenarios also posit the accelerated appearance of a remarkable number of eukaryote-specific folds. the distribution and abundance of RNA viruses in eukaryotes are in disagreement with the aforementioned scenarios because of the paucity of RNA viruses in prokaryotes. eukaryotic RNA viruses are abundant in the superkingdom Eukarya (for example, dsRNA in Fungi, RNA in Plants and retrotranscribing viruses in Plants and Metazoa) archaeal viruses, plasmids, insertion sequences, and antiviral defense closely resemble the mobilome and defense system in Bacteria. even the archaeal member viruses of the PRD1/adenovirus-like and HK97-like lineages are more similar to bacterioviruses than to eukaryoviruses (117). phylogenetic reconstructions depend on the choice of phylogenetic model. some ancestral FSFs were lost from census because of historical bottlenecks. phylogenetic reconstructions depend on the choice of phylogenetic model. our conclusions are the \u201cmost likely\u201d and \u201cmost parsimonious\u201d scenarios inferred from comparative genomic (for example, Venn diagrams and f values) and phylogenomic approaches (toD, ToP, and evoPCO) a consensus regarding viral evolution will be reached in the near future to benefit both viral biology and taxonomy. the true \u201cself\u201d of a virus is the intracellular virus factory of infected cells. virocells produce viral gametes that are functionally analogous to cellular gametes of sexually reproducing species, which fuse during fertilization. virocells produce viral gametes that are functionally analogous to cellular gametes of sexually reproducing species. reductive evolution suggests an early origin of self-replicating viral replicons predating the origin of cells. this suggests an early origin of self-replicating viral replicons predating the origin of cells. the large size of the ABEV group is also incompatible with the virus-first scenario. proto-virocells reduced into modern viruses, whereas their siblings diversified into archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. the proto-virocell genomes coexisted in the intracellular environment and reproduced either without lysis. primitive capsid-like structures could have been built from folds seen in prokaryotic protein nanocompartments or by formation and secretion of membrane vesicles. icle-related scenarios explain how virions were synthesized in proto-virocells to export viral genetic information. plasmids and other selfish genetic elements also originated from proto-virocells but did not acquire capsids. our phylogenomic reconstructions also show that proto-virocells initially harbored segmented RNA genomes. virocells, is biphasic and identifies an early cell-like phase followed by the emergence of modern-day viral lineages. a large number of these proteins are likely very ancient and thus are no longer detectable either by BLAST or HMM-based searches. this phenomenon has been greatly underestimated in the past but is now being acknowledged. the major fraction of viral proteomes includes proteins with no detectable cellular homologs. this subset is likely indicative of the gene-creation abilities of viruses during the virocell life cycles. each of the three possibilities has known examples. the influenza virus genome typically contains six to eight RNA segments. this is compatible with the proposal of Woese (107) that the earliest cells stored genes in the form of segmented RNAs. the ubiquity of the use of RNA primers in the synthesis of DNA and its deoxyribonucleotide precursors of RNA (108) is additional support for this argument. eukaryotes originated either by \u201cfusion\u201d of two prokaryotic cells or from a subgroup of Archaea. these scenarios logically constrain the origin of eukaryoviruses from the merging of prokaryotic viruses. fusion or archaeal-ancestor scenarios postulate transition of one domain of life into another. the origin of eukaryoviruses from prokaryotic viruses is less likely because many families of eukaryoviruses have no counterpart in either Archaea or Bacteria. only two FSFs were shared by archaeoviruses and eukaryoviruses involved in DNA replication/repair and metabolism (c.76.1) the distribution and abundance of RNA viruses in eukaryotes are in disagreement with the aforementioned scenarios because of the paucity of RNA viruses in prokaryotes. RNA viruses are abundant in the superkingdom Eukarya (for example, dsRNA in Fungi, RNA in Plants, and retrotranscribing viruses in Plants and Metazoa). aeal viruses of the PRD1/adenovirus-like and HK97-like lineages are more similar to bacterioviruses than to eukaryoviruses (117). this suggests that both Archaea and Bacteria have experienced similar selection pressure to get rid of RNA viruses early in evolution (46). this suggests that both Archaea and Bacteria have experienced similar selection pressure to get rid of RNA viruses early in evolution. phylogenetic reconstructions depend on the choice of phylogenetic model and search strategy for optimal trees. some ancestral FSFs were lost from our census because of historical bottlenecks that have characterized cellular evolution. phylogenetic reconstructions are reliable in general. 190,610 viral proteins corresponded to proteomes of 3966 viruses. unclassified and unassigned phages and viruses were excluded from the analysis. a total repertoire of 1995 significant FSF domains were detected in the entire set of 5080 proteomes. maximum parsimony (MP) was used to reconstruct ToD and ToP. ToD described evolution of proteomes (taxa) using proteomes as characters. in turn, ToP resembled conventional phylogenies. the transformation ensured that FSF absences did not contribute age to the multidimensional temporal space. evoPCO method provided the three most significant loadings that described how component parts (FSFs) contribute to the history of systems. 190,610 viral proteins corresponded to proteomes of 3966 viruses. unclassified and unassigned phages and viruses were excluded from the analysis. deltaviruses that require helper coviruses to replicate in host tissues were excluded from the analysis. maximum parsimony (MP) was used to reconstruct ToD and ToP. toD described evolution of proteomes (taxa) using proteomes as characters. toD resembled conventional phylogenies that described evolution of proteomes. transformation ensured that we did not lose information about FSFs of very ancient origin. evoPCO method provided the three most significant loadings that described how component parts (FSFs) contribute to the history of systems.
