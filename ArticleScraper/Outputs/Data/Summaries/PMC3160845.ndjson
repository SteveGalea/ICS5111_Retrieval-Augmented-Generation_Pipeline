{"summary": "many countries use sentinel surveillance systems to ascertain rates of medical consultations associated with influenza-like illness [1], [2], and these data typically track the influenza epidemic curve. serological surveillance can permit robust estimates of incidence rates in a population, although it can be costly. in this paper we present the deconvolution (estimation) process in detail. we test the effect of deconvolution on simulated incidence and symptom profile curves. we apply it to syndromic data collected during the declining period of an influenza outbreak on the university of Michigan campus. for each infection we assume that the matrix has rank, which implies that and that there is no infection for which the distribution of symptom profiles can be expressed as a linear combination of the other symptom profile distributions. a separate study tailored for the specific population and the circulating influenza strain should render a more accurate estimate of the asymptomatic fraction. 118 influenza positive contacts in [12] had a presence of at least one of the following four signs or symptoms: fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat. the distribution of symptom profiles reported by cases with ARI not associated with influenza may be quite specific to the location and the circulating respiratory viruses. inference process 3.1 EM iterations Estimation of the parameters and can be done with the aid of the Expectation Maximization algorithm [6], [7], [13] which iterates in the space of parameters and increasing the likelihood of observations with each iteration. denote for any parameters the expectation of the variable conditional on the observations. EM iterations in all the parameters are possible, such as starting from an estimate in Method 1 and using both equations (4) and (5) for subsequent iterations. the classical EM scheme is fairly robust for sufficiently large data sets: iterate all parameters simultaneously using both equations (4) and (5) in each step until convergence. re-estimate the influenza symptom profile distribution by multinomial binning of size 500 with the initial distribution. for non-flu symptoms, use the simulated symptom data from the first 3 weeks and the last 3 weeks (weeks 20\u201322) of the epidemic. surveillance data for those last two weeks in the survey was used to assess the non-flu symptom profile distribution. weekly symptom profile counts attributable to non-flu cases were estimated to be quite low, of the same magnitude as the noise (departure from expected values) weekly estimates of flu incidence for such a small sample size are generally upwardly biased because they cannot go below 0. for each infection let be the probabilities of particular symptom profiles for a person with that infection. for each infection let be the probability of particular symptom profiles for a person with that infection. symptom profile distributions Equation (1) shows that the syndromic data alone cannot identify the number of symptomatic individuals with each infection. symptom profile distributions are multinomial with size and the parameters (1) where is a vector by matrix multiplication. the distribution of symptom profiles reported by cases with ARI not associated with influenza may be quite specific to the location and the circulating respiratory viruses. overall counts of symptom profiles reported by symptomatic individuals during that period give an estimate of the non-flu symptom profile distribution. iterates in the parameters using equation (4) (keeping the parameters constant) such iterates will converge to the unique maximum likelihood estimate for the incidence parameters conditional on the parameters. the initial condition corresponds to expected weekly incidence 1 for each infection in the survey sample. inference method 1 essentially assumes that the distribution of symptoms is known. method based on equations (3) and (4) was introduced in the optics literature [15], [16] and subsequently used in the epidemiological literature [13], [17], [18]. the influenza incidence curve corresponds to an epidemic with basic reproductive number 1.35 and the serial interval distribution with mean 2.6 days [20] truncated at 7 days in a homogeneous population of 3,000,000. for illustration purposes we have generated the non-flu symptom profile distribution for our simulations using the data from [21]. the output of the deconvolution process is an estimate of incidence between weeks 4\u201319. the accuracy of the deconvolution process depends not just on the number of individuals of survey but also on the level of circulation of influenza as well as other symptom causing pathogens. the bootstrap simulations have shown to be unbiased. symptom profile distributions Figure 1A plots the distribution of symptom profiles for non-flu cases obtained from data in [21] and [21]. the cumulative number of symptomatic influenza cases between weeks 4 and 19 was 993,693. the cumulative number of symptomatic influenza cases between weeks 4 and 19 was 993,693. symptom profiles (2b) and deconvolution Method 2 were used. the decline in the flu outbreak is statistically significant. for example during the first 3 weeks, 221/1555 (14.21%) of symptomatic individuals in the survey had fever. during the next 3 weeks, 108/1004 (10.76%) of symptomatic individuals had fever (OR 1.37, p-value 0.011 for the Fisher exact test) we have performed 600 3-step simulations as specified in section 4 of the methods, both for Method 1 and Method 2. Figure 3 plots two samples of 5 deconvolved influenza symptomatic incidence curves against the original one (black) the cumulative number of symptomatic influenza cases between weeks 4 and 19 was 993,693. 2.1 Synthetic incidence curves We have generated synthetic incidence curves for flu and non-flu symptomatic cases as described in the Methods. 2.2 Symptom profiles (2a) We have performed 600 3-step simulations as specified in section 4 of the methods. the cumulative number of symptomatic influenza cases between weeks 4 and 19 was 993,693. for the sample of 600 deconvolved symptomatic influenza incidence curves, their cumulative incidences have mean 1,011,040. 95% of the cases fell between 793,340 and 1,209,297. this percentage declined towards the end of the survey period. the key potential limitation of our method is the ability to accurately estimate the distribution of symptom profiles for influenza and non-influenza cases. estimates of the flu incidence is particularly sensitive to an estimate of the non-flu symptom profile distribution because there are many more symptomatic non-flu cases compared to the number of symptomatic flu cases in a survey. a large non-flu outbreak with \u201catypical\u201d symptoms is added as an unobserved component. for the influenza symptom profile distribution, the most accurate estimates should be obtained using data for each specific (evolving) influenza season. the accuracy of the PCR test is correlated with symptom presentation [23] data on symptom profiles for influenza used in the deconvolution process for the university of Michigan campus is obtained from a different population in [12]. a careful study design should be used to avoid some issues. such design should involve the recruitment of a large number of individuals.
