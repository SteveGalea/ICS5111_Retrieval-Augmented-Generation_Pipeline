{"summary": "acyclic nucleosides/nucleotides act as antimetabolites. adefovir is active against DNA viruses and retroviruses. tenofovir exhibits high potency and selectivity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses and hepatitis B virus. several nucleotide analogues have been designed by incorporation of a phosphonate residue (RO)2P(O)\u2013CH2\u2013) instead of a phosphate group (RO)2P(O)\u2013O\u2013C(5\u2032)) to avoid the first phosphorylation step and to ensure the stability of phosphonates to enzymatic hydrolysis [32,33,34,35]. 2-amino-6-chloropurine and guanine as nucleobases have been designed to study their antiviral and cytostatic properties. to install a guanine moiety at C4 in the 1,2,3-triazole ring, two strategies were used. the dipolar cycloaddition of the respective azidoalkylphosphonates 14 to propargylated guanines should directly lead to Compound 15 or 16 [41, lguanine 18b and all azidoalkylphosphonates 14a\u2013k are known compounds. cycloadditions of propargylated guanines 18a and 18b failed because of low solubility of guanines 18a and 18b (Scheme 2). azides 14 were subjected to cycloaddition with Compound 19 in presence of Cu(I) salt under microwave irradiation to give 1,2,3-triazoles 17a\u2013k. subsequently, 17a\u2013k were treated with 75% trifluoroacetic acid. attempts at preparing (1R,2S)-16k and (1S,2S)-16k failed. vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus-1, adenovirus-2, cytomegalovirus (AD-169 strain and Davis strain) and varicella-zoster virus were used as reference compounds. no inhibitory activity against any virus was detected at 250 M. the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay system. the cytostatic activity of the tested compounds was defined as the 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC50), causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferation. 206 49 16f >250 >250 195 78 16g >250 >250 250 16i >250 >250 210 13 16j >250 >250 >250 212 54 5-fluorouracil 0.33 0.17 18 5 0.54 0.12 a 50% Inhibitory concentration or compound concentration required to inhibit tumor cell proliferation by 50%. only (1R,2S)-17k and (1S,2S)-17k appeared to be the most active toward all tested cancerous cell lines. propargylated guanines 18a (R = H) and 18b (R = Ac) to various azides failed because of low solubility of guanines 18a and 18b (Scheme 2). Attempts at running a cycloaddition of the phosphonate 14a with propargylguanine 18a at 110 \u00b0C in toluene resulted in the recovery of starting materials only. phosphonates 16a\u2013j and 17a\u2013k were evaluated for their antiviral activities against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses. they were treated with 75% trifluoroacetic acid to provide acyclic guanosine analogues 16a\u2013k in good yields (92%\u201398%) cytotoxicity of the tested compounds was defined as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (CC50) that causes a microscopically-detectable alteration of normal cell morphology. the cytostatic activity of the tested compounds was defined as the 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC50), causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferation. cytostatic activity was determined against murine leukemia L1210, human T-lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma cells. none of the tested compounds affected cell morphology of HEL, HeLa, Vero, MDCK and CRFK cells at concentrations up to 100 M. only (1R,2S)-17k and (1S,2S)-17k appeared to be the most active toward all tested cancerous cell lines. IR spectral data were measured on an Infinity MI-60 FT-IR spectrometer. Melting points were determined on a Boetius apparatus (VEB Kombinat NAGEMA, Dresden, DDR\u2014Currently Germany) the solution was concentrated in vacuo, and the crude product was purified on a silica gel column with chloroform\u2013methanol mixtures (50:1, 20:1 or 10:1, v/v) to give the appropriate 1,2,3-triazoles 17. the solution was concentrated in vacuo. anal. calcd. for C13H18ClN8O3P: C, 38.96; H, 4.53; N, 27.72. diethyl 2-4-[(2-amino-6-chloro-9H-purin-9-yl)methyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-ylethylphosphonate. anal. calcd. for C14H20ClN8O3P: C, 40.54; H, 4.86; N, 27.01.
