{"summary": "DEN is an emerging arthropod-borne infectious disease which is caused by DENV. the virus is transmitted by female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions. four serotypes of DENV have been identified to date. the only licensed DEN vaccine (CYD-TDV) available is a tetravalent, recombinant, live attenuated DEN vaccine (CYD-TDV) developed by Sanofi Pasteur (Guy et al., 2015) the vaccine has shown varied efficacy against different serotypes and in different age groups. DENV belongs to the family Flaviviridae of which the members are well known as human pathogens. they are enveloped viruses with positive sense, single stranded RNA. the virus particle is about 50 nm in size and the RNA genome (10.7 kb) is encapsulated. NS1 anchors the replication complex to the ER membrane and interacts physically with NS4B. NS3 functions as a serine protease, RNA helicase and nucleotide triphosphatase/RNA triphosphatase, and its protease activity is dependent on the cofactor NS2B.

RNA genome (10.7 kb) is encapsulated by a protein shell. viral genome replication process within host cell is driven by NS proteins. NS1 anchors the replication complex to the ER membrane and interacts physically with NS4B. NS3 functions as a serine protease, RNA helicase and nucleotide triphosphatase/RNA triphosphatase. lycosylation is the post-translational modification of biomolecules such as proteins or lipids through the enzymatic attachment of complex oligosaccharide structures to the peptide backbone or lipid anchor. lycosylation is the post-translational modification of biomolecules such as proteins or lipids through the enzymatic attachment of complex oligosaccharide structures to the peptide backbone or lipid anchor. over 70% of the euk high mannose, hybrid and complex N-linked glycans are enzymatically attached to the N-X-S/T sequence of the glycoprotein. such complexity can be found with the isomerism/anomercity of a sugar. differences of their isomeric linkages can affect the selectivity of their host receptors and thus biology. a series of glycosidases trim down the mannose residues before glycotransferases present in the glycans extend the antennae of the glycans to produce larger hybrid or complex structures. the bulk of mammalian glycoproteins expressed and/or purified in insect cells have used cell lines from Spodoptera frugiperda (sf9, sf21) idic N-linked structures are the dominant forms in insect-cell derived glycoproteins. the advent of high resolution glyco-analytical tools was recently challenged by the advent of high resolution glyco-analytical tools. these tools were able to identify glyco-epitopes such as [alpha]1-3 fucosylation. studies performed with mosquito cell lines A. albopictus and A. aegypti showed that glycoproteins produced in these cell lines display predominantly high mannose and pauci-mannosidic structures. in these initial experiments, the presence of mannosidase-resistant structures was observed. in the past decades, scientists have mostly relied on digestive enzymes. the field has benefited from labels such as 2-AB, 2-AA (LC separation) and 9-Aminopyrene-1,4,5-trisulfonic acid (CE separation), whereby glycans are tagged at a glycan\u2019s reducing end and the identity of these glycans is assigned based on their retention time behavior across a HILIC or CE. glycoproteomics allows investigators to understand the degree of glycosylation on various sites of the glycoprotein. the platform is adapted from proteomics and relies heavily on mass spectrometry and substantial data analysis. key to any glycoproteomics method is the enrichment of glycopeptides. Glycosylation is responsible for correct protein folding/structure, protein trafficking and stability, receptor/ligand recognition as well as increasing its half-life in the blood stream. at the protein level, complex sugar structures modulate receptor functions and thus are integral to regulate normal cell\u2013cell, cell-substrate communication and adhesion. viruses are heavily dependent upon the glycosylation machinery of the host cell to glycosylate their proteins. glycosylation can be involved in receptor binding. this is exemplified by HIV and DENV which rely on high mannose type glycosylation to bind to their MRs or DC-SIGN that are present on host immune cells. glycosylation is a means to evade immune recognition within the host by changing glycan sites. there are two types of protein glycosylation distinguished by their site of attachment on the protein backbone. N-linked glycosylation where the glycan is covalently attached to the asparagine (N) and O-linked glycosylation where the glycan is linked to oxygen from some serine (S) or threonine (T) residues. this is in contrast to 2,6 linked sialic acid normally found in the human host receptors with very low 2,3-linked sialic acid expressed in the lower respiratory tract. in mammalian cells, N-glycosylation takes place predominantly within the ER. this involves enzymatic synthesis of dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3. glycosylation occurs entirely in the Golgi apparatus. it does not involve any glyco-lipid intermediates and no glycosidases appear to be involved in their synthesis and processing. most our knowledge in insect glycosylation was derived from studies performed on Drosophila melanogaster and baculoviral-insect systems. the presence of a truncated trimannosyl N-glycan with an [alpha]1,6-linked fucose was reported. lysed cell extracts from sf9 and High five cells lack the nucleotide donors for sialic acid (CMP-NeuAc) chromatography (Johnson et al., 1994), lectin-binding assay (Johnson et al., 1994; Hacker et al., 2009) and radioactive labeling (Smith and Wright, 1985) have helped increase the efficiency of glycomic approaches. the use of exoglycosidase arrays adds further confidence to a glycan\u2019s structure elucidation. the evolving development of glycan labeling has meant that newer, faster labeling and highly sensitive labels can increase the throughput and efficiency of a glycomic analysis. the most common are MALDI and electrospray ionization. glycoproteomic methodologies follow similar approaches to proteomics. key to any glycoproteomics method is the enrichment of glycopeptides. this is important to reduce the ion suppression from peptide mass spectrometry signals without enrichment. complex sugar structures modulate receptor functions and regulate normal cell\u2013cell, cell-substrate communication and adhesion. all living cells are covered by a dense glycocalyx. pathogens and foreign objects must deal with this complex forest of cell surface glycoconjugate upon entering the host cell. glycosylation is a means to evade immune recognition within the host by changing glycan sites. glycan structure has been reported to mask antigenic sites from recognition by neutralizing antibodies. Dimerization of E proteins at neutral pH positions the fusion loop into a hydrophobic pocket formed by DI and DIII of the adjacent E monomer. this helps prevent premature exposure of the fusion loop before endocytosis of the virion by a new host cell. the pH-dependent hinge at the DI-DII interface facilitates structural rearrangement of E protein during virion maturation and fusion process. in the ER, DENV E protein undergoes N-linked glycosylation at two asparagines, N67 and N153 located in DII and DI respectively. the site is unique to DENV and has been proposed to interact directly with DC-SIGN, one of the host cell receptors. no O-linked glycan has been detected to date. glycosylation of DENV E (A) and NS1 (B) proteins in mammalian cells. monomeric NS1 protein is glycosylated with high mannose glycans at N130 and N207. the monomer rapidly dimerizes in the ER and membrane-associated NS1 dimers (1) are involved in virus RNA replication. glycans from deNV1-4 (vaccine CYD-TDV) produced in mammalian vero cells have been reported to consist of high mannose, complex and hybrid glycans with complex glycans as the major glycan species. most of the complex or hybrid glycans at N153 were found fucosylated across all four DENV serotypes. a higher content of complex or hybrid glycans was found in DENV2. high mannose glycans were detected as the main glycan species for DENV1, 3 and 4. the differential glycosylation pattern between DENV2 and DENV1, 3, 4 may impact on various aspects of dengue pathogenesis. NS1 dimer is formed when two -roll domains dimerize at the center. these dimers tend to trimerize resulting in hexameric NS1. the hexamer crystal structure revealed a barrel-shaped oligomer with a central open channel. the exact mechanism of NS1 hexamer formation remains unclear. the functions of NS1 are closely associated to its cellular location. ER membrane-associated dimeric NS1 has been found to co-localize with viral dsRNA. a less conserved glycosylation site at N175 has been reported in WNV, St. Louis encephalitis virus and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. in all four serotypes of DENV, intracellular and extracellular DENV NS1 display different types of N-glycans as the oligosaccharides undergo modification during the maturation process. the protein is glycosylated at N69 (Table 1) with circumstantial evidence for N-linked glycosylation at sites 7, 31, and 52. it was found that -glucosidase inhibitor reduced the amount of prM-E heterodimer, suggesting the N-glycans are required for productive folding pathway of these glycoproteins. 3 strains GZ/10476/2012 (Accession no: KC261634) and DENV 4 isolate GZ30 are aligned against protein entries from Conserved Domain Database or UniProt using BLAST. the external protein shell of DEN virion consists of 180 copies of E (53\u201356 kDa) and prM glycoproteins whereby only E proteins are exposed on the surface. fusion loop into a hydrophobic pocket formed by DI and DIII of the adjacent E monomer. this helps prevent premature exposure of the fusion loop before endocytosis of the virion by a new host cell. in the ER lumen of the host cell, membrane-associated E protein is generated after co-translational processing of the viral precursor polypeptide by host Signalase. the glycosylation site is unique to DENV and has been proposed to interact directly with DC-SIGN, one of the host cell receptors. however, N153 represents the conserved glycosylation site in the family Flaviviridae. no O-linked glycan has been detected in mosquito cell-derived virions. glycosylation of DENV E (A) and NS1 (B) proteins in ER. monomeric NS1 protein is glycosylated with high mannose glycans at N130 and N207. the monomer rapidly dimerizes in the ER and membrane-associated NS1 dimers are involved in virus RNA replication. glycans from deNV1-4 (vaccine CYD-TDV) produced in mammalian vero cells have been reported to consist of high mannose, complex and hybrid glycans with complex glycans as the major glycan species. most of the complex or hybrid glycans at N153 were found fucosylated. high mannose glycans were detected as the main glycan species for DENV1, 3 and 4. a higher content of complex or hybrid glycans was found in DENV2. the differential glycosylation pattern between DENV2 and DENV1, 3, 4 may impact on various aspects of dengue pathogenesis. NS1 dimer is formed when two -roll domains dimerize at the center. these dimers tend to trimerize resulting in hexameric NS1. the hexamer crystal structure revealed a barrel-shaped oligomer with a central open channel. the exact mechanism of NS1 hexamer formation remains unclear. ER membrane-associated dimeric NS1 has been found to co-localize with viral dsRNA. hexameric NS1 is able to bind to the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. a less conserved glycosylation site at N175 has been reported in WNV, St. Louis encephalitis virus and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. a less conserved glycosylation site at N175 has been reported in all four serotypes of DENV. the oligosaccharides undergo modification during the maturation process. the protein is glycosylated at N69 (Table 1) with circumstantial evidence for N-linked glycosylation at sites 7, 31, and 52 (Courageot et al., 2000). -glucosidase inhibitor reduced the amount of prM-E heterodimer, suggesting the N-glycans are required for productive folding pathway of these glycoproteins. deNV 4 isolates GZ30 (Accession no: JQ822247) are aligned against protein entries from Conserved Domain Database (CDD) or UniProt using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) the N-glycosylation site is located at residue 64 to 69 depending on the serotype. the interaction between DC-SIGN and DENV can be inhibited by the addition of mannose and mannan. the carbohydrate recognition domain of DC-SIGN interacts directly with the N67-glycan of E dimers. lectin (HHA)-resistant DENV failed to infect DC-SIGN(+) DC. MR shows a preferential binding to terminal mannose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine while DC-SIGN binds to high-mannose oligosaccharides. MR shows a preferential binding to terminal mannose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine while DC-SIGN binds to high-mannose oligosaccharides. loss of the site through site directed mutagenesis (N67Q) in E protein was sufficient to render DENV2 (strain 16681) growth defective in BHK-21 cells, a DC-SIGN(-) cell line. lack of virion release may be due to impaired virion secretion along the ER-Golgi secretory pathway in the absence of N67-glycan tag on E protein. strain 16681 differed from strains PUO-218 and NGC at two positions. arginine (R)120 and hydrophobic isoleucine (I) replace T170 in strains PUO-218. N153-glycan on E protein is important but not essential for DENV survival in mosquito cells. successive passages of DENV in C6/36 cells in vitro resulted in mutation at T155 which ablates the N153-glycosylation motif. the non-glycosylated variant was able to propagate in mosquito cells. removal of glycan from N207 in DENV1 and DENV2 (16681) NS1 protein produced similar growth and virus titers compared to WT in mammalian cells. double mutation attempts (N130Q/N207Q and T132N/T209N) failed to generate genetically stable mutant viruses. the use of tunicamycin, an enzyme targeting the host glycosylation enzymes, allowed confirm that absence of N-glycan was solely responsible for the instability of NS1 oligomers. also, the secretion of NS1 was reduced when complex glycans maturation was blocked by glycosylation inhibitors. high-mannose glycans at N207 stabilizes NS1 dimer (Pryor et al., 1998; Flamand et al., 1999; Somnuke et al., 2011) reduced levels of DENV 4 N207Q and N130Q/N207Q NS1 proteins were observed in culture supernatant. the enhanced neurovirulence could be attributed to the reduced immunogenicity of the virus. the complement cascade is the central defense mechanism of innate immunity which triggers the immune effector function to remove infectious pathogens and modified self cells upon activation. MBL is reactive to high mannose oligosaccharides and thus can efficiently recognize insect cell-derived DENV with high mannose glycans present on its E proteins. however, mammalian cell-derived DENV was found to be effectively inhibited and neutralized by mouse MBL. secreted NS1 binds directly to C4BP, a major inhibitor of the C4b component. this binding leads to the recruitment of C4BP on cell surface via NS1 and inactivates C4b thereby interfering with the formation of the membrane attack complex. the work has demonstrated a competitive binding of NS1 to MBL. anti-CLEC5A monoclonal antibody reduced DENV-induced vascular leakage in a mouse model. anti-CLEC5A monoclonal antibody reduced DENV-induced vascular leakage in a mouse model. a potential therapeutic approach to counteract excessive inflammatory responses involved in severe DEN. Cryo-EM data of DENV/DC-SIGN complexes reveals that the carbohydrate recognition domain of DC-SIGN interacts directly with the N67-glycan of E dimers. lectin (HHA)-resistant DENV failed to infect DC-SIGN(+) DC, in contrast to productive infection and replication in DC-SIGN(-) and carbohydrate-independent cells. deglycosylated (N67-) DENV1 and DENV2 showed enhanced infectivity in mosquito cells (C6/36) compared to wild type (WT) the entry mode employed by Flavivirus (DENV and JEV) was shown to involve membrane fusion instead of receptor-mediated endocytosis. loss of the site through site directed mutagenesis (N67Q) in E protein was sufficient to render DENV2 (strain 16681) growth defective in BHK-21 cells, a DC-SIGN(-) cell line. lack of virion release may be due to impaired virion secretion along the ER-Golgi secretory pathway in the absence of N67-glycan tag. strain 16681 differed from strains PUO-218 and NGC at two positions. uncharged polar threonine replaces charged R120 and hydrophobic isoleucine (I) replaces T170 in strains PUO-218 and NGC. glycan on E protein is important but not essential for DENV survival in mosquito cells. successive passages of DENV in C6/36 cells in vitro resulted in mutation at T155 which ablates the N153-glycosylation motif. however, the non-glycosylated variant was able to propagate in mosquito cells. double mutation attempts failed to generate genetically stable mutant viruses. the impact of deglycosylation at this site varies depending on the virus strain and amino acid residue used for replacement. further investigation on the importance of the N-glycosylation motif was done by Lee et al. (2010) through extensive point mutation within the conserved N-x-T/S motif of DENV2. replacement of T69 by a larger and more hydrophobic residue (leucine and valine) either by molecular cloning (Lee et al., 2010) generated viable virus that retained efficient growth in BHK-21 and Vero cells in the absence of N67 glycan glycan tag for chaperone-assisted folding followed by productive protein secretion. structural comparison of the WT strains and their respective mutants needs to be carried out. NS1 Protein Glycosylation N130A NS1 mutant virus of DENV1 (Tajima et al., 2008) and DENV2 (NGC) failed to generate viable virus in both mammalian and mosquito cells. Mutation at N130 in DENV4 NS1 caused reduced viral growth in mammalian cells and C6/36 cells. however, N130Q NS1 mutant of DENV2 (16681) produced infectious virus with a similar tit single and double NS1 mutant proteins are secreted from infected cells. the impact of deglycosylation on secretion is thought to be associated with the stability of the NS1 oligomer. majority of the secreted proteins are hexamers (Somnuke et al., 2011) whereas secreted N130Q and N130/N207Q NS1 proteins showed reduced hexamer population and increase in higher order oligomer (>675 kDa) population. the presence of complex glycan at N207 is critical for both NS1 secretion and NS1 hexamer stability. the reduced neurovirulence of these viruses may be linked to reduced levels of extracellular hexameric NS1. the reduced neurovirulence of these viruses may be linked to the reduced levels of extracellular hexameric NS1. MBL differentiates self- from non-self-antigens based on a sugar density-dependent recognition mechanism. additional N67-glycan in DENV could promote a more efficient recognition and binding by MBL. the role of NS1 glycosylation in the ability of the protein to interfere with complement activation has been ignored. a recent study reported that secreted NS1 binds directly to C4BP, a major inhibitor of the C4b component. this binding leads to the recruitment of C4b on cell surface via NS1 and inactivates C4b thereby interfering with the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) direct interaction between DENV and CLEC5A on macrophages indicates that virus glycosylation plays a role in DEN pathogenesis. deglycosylation is a post-translational modification which significantly affects the conformation of a protein. the role of glycosylation and glycan structures in deglycosylation has yet to be reported. the ability of Celgosivir treatment, a bicyclic iminosugar that inhibits glycosylation through negatively binding to ER [alpha]-glucosidase II, to protect mice from a lethal DENV challenge indirectly demonstrates the importance of glycosylation in DENV virulence. however, efforts to characterize the nature of the glycan structures in DENV have remained timid. the accessibility of the epitope that they target can be influenced by the glycosylated status of the protein. this approach is critical for the development of new therapeutics with broader activity and increased efficacy. the DEN field as a whole would benefit greatly from in-depth understanding and characterization of the glycosylation patterns of DEN virions."}
