{"summary": "HCV is a small positive single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family. this enveloped virus infects hepatocytes and causes serious liver diseases in humans. a new era finally started in 2014 thanks to the development of direct-acting antiviral arsenal which enables to achieve a sustained virologic response in more than 90% of treated patients in clinical trials. a proof of concept has been provided in vitro and in vivo by using several lectins such as Cyanovirin-N, Griffithsin or Scytovirin. however, a potential resistance of HCV to such a therapeutic strategy has never been investigated. the soluble recombinant form of the CD81 large extracellular loop (CD81-LEL) was produced as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein as described previously [20] the 3/11 monoclonal antibody (anti-E2; kindly provided by J. McKeating, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom) was produced in vitro by using a MiniPerm apparatus (Heraeus), as recommended by the manufacturer. luc-DM genome contains a Renilla Luciferase reporter gene and two adaptive mutations (R1373Q and C2441S in NS3 and NS5A, respectively) these plasmids were used to produce HCV RNA by in vitro transcription which were electroporated into HuH-7-RFP-NLS-IPS cells. supernatants of electroporated cells were recovered and filtered through a 0.45-m-pore-sized membrane, infected cells were subcultured every three to four days in the presence of the lectins. supernatants were recovered and used to infect naive cells. the concentrations of each lectin were increased in a stepwise manner. inhibition assays were performed by preincubating HCVcc with lectins, the 3/11 MAb or CD81-LEL for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after 3 h of contact with HCVcc, cells were further incubated for 72 h with complete medium. the 3/11 MAb was purified using the Pierce Protein G plus Agarose. the C4 MAb (anti-actin) was purchased from Millipore. plasmid encoding the JFH1-CS-A4 genome. cell viability measured using the cellTiter-glo\u00ae luminescent / Cell viability assay. selection and isolation of lectin resistant HCV strains HuH-7-RFP-NLS-IPS were infected with a stock of the HCV JFH1-CS-A4 strain. HCV RNA quantification Total cellular RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) sequences of viral genomes isolated after selection HCV RNA in supernatants were determined by directly sequencing overlapping purified RT-PCR fragments. we cultivated HCV in vitro in the presence of increasing concentrations of different high-mannose specific lectins: GNA, CV-N, ConA and GRFT. first, we infected cells in the presence of the 90% effective concentration of each lectin. as soon as all cells were infected, supernatants were recovered and used to infect naive cells in the presence of lectins. HuH-7-RFP-NLS-IPS cells were inoculated with the strains isolated after selection (GNA, CV-N, ConA and GRFT virus) in the absence (+) of 3 g/mL of GNA (A), 0.3 g/mL of CV-N (B), 10 g/mL of ConA (C) or 1 g/mL of GRFT (D) after 48 h, cells were lysed and intracellular HCV the mutation has previously been shown to lead to a shift of the E2N1 N-glycan from N417 to N415 [26] when the virus was passaged in absence of lectin, we only detected the mutation I599V in E2. in these sequences, only three synonymous mutations were identified (one in the end of Core, and two in p7, after GNA exposure) this mutation prevents the modification of E2N4 N-glycosylation site on asparagine 448. similar mutations have already been identified in cell culture adaptation in absence of lectin. the mutation S449P prevents the modification of the E2N4 N-glycosylation site which is conserved in 97.6% of sequences of all genotypes and 100% of genotype 2a sequences. mutations were introduced into a modified JFH1 genome expressing a Renilla Luciferase reporter gene by reverse genetics. some individual mutations or combinations of two mutations led to slight variations of the replication measured as Luciferase activities 24, 48 and 72 h after electroporation. an increased replication was observed at 72 h for the N417S, L612M and V284A-S449P mutants (1.6-, 1.6- and 2.0-fold WT respectively, p 0.05) the production of infectious virus for a400D and a400D-L755M mutants was significantly decreased as compared to that of the WT (3.0- and 2.5-fold WT, p 0.05 and p 0.001, respectively) however, the different combinations of three mutations that were found at the end of each selection did not have any significant effect on infectious viral particle production. expression of E1E2 viral glycoproteins and actin was analyzed in cell lysates 72h post-electroporation by western blotting with specific MAbs (A4 [anti-E1], 3/11 [anti-E2] and C4 [anti-actin]. effects of the mutations selected upon lectin exposure on sensitivity to lectin inhibition. the results obtained with a400D, M338V-A400D and A400D-L755M mutants were surprising. the infectivity was increased at low concentrations of GRFT. this could suggest that the mutation confers a susceptibility to a beneficial conformational change induced by low concentration of GRFT. mutations identified upon lectin exposure affected the N-glycosylation of E2 envelope protein known to protect the CD81 binding site from neutralizing antibodies. we also investigated the mutant sensitivity to the 3/11 neutralizing MAb and to a soluble form of the CD81 large extracellular loop. ivity compared to infection in absence of inhibitory protein is reported as means S.D. of at least three independent experiments. we hypothesized that other mutations which improve the virus fitness or modify the property of the viral particles could have been fixed upon lectin exposure. in vitro in the presence of increasing concentrations of different high-mannose specific lectins. we infected HuH-7-RFP-NLS-IPS cells in the presence of the 90% effective concentration of each lectin (1, 0.1, 2 and 1 g/mL for GNA, CV-N, ConA and GRFT, respectively) HuH-7-RFP-NLS-IPS cells were inoculated with the strains isolated after selection (GNA, CV-N, ConA and GRFT virus) in the absence (+) of 3 g/mL of GNA (A), 0.3 g/mL of CV-N (B), 10 g/mL of ConA (C) or 1 g/mL of GRFT (D) after 48 h, cells were lysed and intracellular HCV the mutation has previously been shown to lead to a shift of the E2N1 N-glycan from N417 to N415

inhibition. mutants M338V-N417S-L755M, M338V-L612M-L755M and M338V-A400D-L755M were more sensitive to inhibition by other lectins. this could suggest that the A400D mutation confers a susceptibility to a beneficial conformational change induced by low concentration of GRFT. mutant sensitivity to 3/11 MAb and soluble CD81 inhibition. mutations identified upon lectin exposure affected the N-glycosylation of E2 envelope protein. we also investigated the mutant sensitivity to the 3/11 neutralizing MAb and to a soluble form of the CD81 large extracellular loop. analysis of the core and the non-structural protein genes of the strains isolated upon escalating lectin exposure. we hypothesized that other mutations which improve the virus fitness or modify the property of the viral particles could have been fixed upon lectin exposure. characterization of the E1E2 mutations, alone or in combination, evidenced a positive selection on the E1E2 coding region. other mutations were also detected in the regions encoding the core and the non-structural proteins of the isolated strains. a second region under positive selection corresponding to the end of NS5A, a region known to be frequently mutated during cell culture adaptation. mutation was responsible for a 1.7-fold increase of the infectivity. this mutation is also known to lead to a shift of the E2N1 N-glycan from N417 to N415, which prevents the recognition of N415 residue by several neutralizing antibodies. mutation L612M, which may be critical for the overall E2 architecture, also increases the sensitivity to GNA. development of HCV resistance against CBAs is unlikely to result in an enhancement of neutralization by the immune system. despite recent approval of several direct-acting antivirals, NS3/4A, NS5A or NS5B proteins are unlikely to find an indication for HCV treatment. the viability in absence of lectin and are reported as the means S.D. of at least three independent experiments.
