{"summary": "the first MERS case was identified on 20 May 2015; a 68-year-old man returning from the Middle East was diagnosed with MERS. it passed nine days after he had sought medical care. the number of quarantined individuals peaked on 17 June, with 37 cases. the lack of credible information is often filled by rumors. the lack of credible information is often filled by rumors. the lack of credible information is often filled by rumors. study tested the psychological impact of MERS-CoV outbreaks on emergency room resident physicians. majority (91%) agreed that their work put them at risk of infection. majority of ERRPs felt their job would expose their families to risk of infection. a buzz of negative emotions (i.e., anxiety or fear) was more prevalent in online discussion boards, on twitter, and in online cafes. news buzz, but not rumor buzz, was associated with positive MERS emotions (i.e., being calm or composed) a few previous studies have examined the determinants of the perceived risk of MERS. for example, Yang and Cho reported that risk perception was positively associated with overreaction by the public. the infection sensitivity of community residents during the MERS outbreak in Korea correlated with gender, age, occupation, and health behaviors. cultural value, as a fundamental set of factors, critically influences the perception of science and technology, i.e., perceived benefit, perceived risk, trust, negative feeling, and knowledge. we focused on cultural value, science and technology optimism (referred to as \u201cS&T optimism\u201d henceforth), and ideology. egalitarians are predicted to be more concerned about large-scale environmental risks with potentially catastrophic consequences such as nuclear power and ozone depletion. individualists would consider these risks to have been exaggerated. strong S&T optimism in individuals decreases the perceived risk of MERS. hypothesis 2 (H2) suggests progressive individuals perceive more risk from specific events than conservative individuals do. the mayor blamed the central government's failure to filter suspected MERS patients and for hiding important information that could have been useful for the public and municipalities. the tory ruling party accused the mayor of spreading false rumors. such political conflicts started just not from the MERS case. trust increases the acceptance of new and emerging technologies. findings imply trust plays a critical role in attenuating the degree of perceived risk. perceived vulnerability is usually depicted as a necessary (but insufficient) motivator of precautionary behavior. in the case of disease, perceived vulnerability refers to the extent to which individuals feel that they would acquire some disease. people with higher self-efficacy have lower risk perceptions regarding a health issue. those with lower self-efficacy have higher risk perceptions regarding the same health issue. self-efficacy for MERS was negatively associated with risk perceptions. higher social class reduces perceived risk about nanotechnology and animal cloning. hypothesis 8 (H8). Higher income or social class decrease perceived risk. 255 (55.4%) respondents had knowledge of MERS-CoV. majority of camel owners (79.5%) had a low to moderate level of knowledge. more than half had a low perceived risk of susceptibility to contract the disease. 78 camel owners were aware of the disease (93.6%), mostly as a result of TV (75.6%). a buzz of negative emotions was more prevalent in online discussion boards, on twitter, and in online cafes, rather than on news sites and blogs. most respondents believed washing hands with soap and water and keeping away from sick individuals were protective measures against the disease. a few previous studies have examined the determinants of the perceived risk of MERS. value factor value provides a basic orientation that directs perception and attitude. focuses on the objective state of individuals or assets they possess. focuses on the objective state of individuals. egalitarians are predicted to be more concerned about large-scale environmental risks with potentially catastrophic consequences such as nuclear power. individualists would consider these risks to have been exaggerated. et al. [25] proposed that nine risk characteristics influence perceived and acceptable risk. two characteristics, known to the science, and controllability, are critical factors in risk judgment. this acquisition of precise knowledge and improved controllability of risk usually reduces uncertainty that increases risk perception. the conflicts between the right and the left peaked when the left-oriented mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, criticized the president. he criticized the mayor, saying that the mayor\u2019s independent actions could lead to confusion among the public. risk studies have frequently examined trust as the target variable. trust has an indirect effect on the emotional aspect that influences perceived benefits and risks related to food involving nanotechnology. trust increases the acceptance of new and emerging technologies. the greater trust individuals have will decrease the perceived risk of MERS. the greater the amounts of trust individuals have will decrease the perceived risk of MERS. the strong belief in resilience lowers individuals\u2019 risk perception of MERS. hypothesis 6 (H6) suggests the strong belief in resilience lowers individuals\u2019 risk perception of MERS. income and social class represent economic resources. those with lower income tended to perceive a lower risk than those in lower-social class did. students had 53.5% of the essential knowledge pertaining to MERS. 255 (55.4%) respondents had knowledge of MERS-CoV. more knowledge related to avian influenza decreases risk of avian influenza. we hypothesized that not only the perception factor, but also the value and resource factors, influence the perceived risk of MERS. Rokeach defined a value as an enduring belief that a specific mode of conduct is personally or socially preferable to an opposite or converse mode of conduct. egalitarians are predicted to be more concerned about large-scale environmental risks with potentially catastrophic consequences such as nuclear power and ozone depletion. individualists would consider these risks to have been exaggerated. optimism decreased risk perceptions regarding climate change and GMO food. if individuals feel that they do not precisely understand the risk object, they exhibit higher risk perception and less acceptance. trust in science and scientists, i.e., an alternative version of optimism, has an impact on risk perception. the conflict between the right and the left peaked when the left-oriented mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, criticized the president. the conflicts between the right and the left peaked when the left-oriented mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, criticized the mayor. the mayor said the independent actions could lead to confusion among the public. risk studies have frequently examined trust as the target variable. trust in the media (broadcasting), local government, and NGOs was positively associated with cumulative risk perception. the greater the amounts of trust individuals have will decrease the perceived risk of MERS. the greater the amounts of trust individuals have will decrease the perceived risk of MERS. the strong belief in resilience lowers individuals\u2019 risk perception of MERS. hypothesis 6 (H6) suggests the strong belief in resilience lowers individuals\u2019 risk perception of MERS. economic resources provide various instruments to avoid a hazard, e.g., more safe places and speedy vehicles, which can be used to escape from disease. income and social class represent economic resources. the deficit model argues that a lack of adequate knowledge mainly influences public skepticism toward modern science and technology. if provided sufficient information about science and technology, the public could change its mind and make a good decision. hypothesis: Hypothesis 10 (H10). More knowledge related to MERS decreases individuals\u2019 perceived risk of MERS. we hypothesized that not only the perception factor, but also the value and resource factors, influence the perceived risk of MERS. 39 113 (14.0%) 2.940 0.653 40\u201349 162 (20.0%) 2.978 0.641 over 50 109 (3.5%) 3.155 0.690 Total 809 (100.0%) 2.984 0.624 Household Income(Million won) 299 125 (19.7%) 2.950 0.614 300\u2013499 177 (27.9%) 3.003 0.629 500\u2013699 185 (29.2%) 2.999 0.589 700 147 (29.2%) 3.
