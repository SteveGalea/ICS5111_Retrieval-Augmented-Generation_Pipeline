{"summary": "PRRs detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (1, 2). PRRs activate intracellular signaling pathways. IFN-/ are representative cytokines that elicit innate immune responses to establish an antiviral state in infected cells and neighboring noninfected cells. all of the RLR members share a DExD/H-box RNA helicase domain and a C-terminal regulation repressor domain (RD) and a C-terminal regulation repressor domain (RD) all of the RLR members share a DExD/H-box RNA helicase domain and a C-terminal regulation repressor domain (RD) measles virus (MeV; negative-sense ssRNA) and reovirus (dsRNA) were reported to be sensed by both RIG-I and MDA5 (19, 28\u201331) this non-self-recognition largely depends on the features of foreign nucleic acids, such as nucleic acid sequences. nsp2 to -6, nsp2TF, nsp2N, nsp7, nsp7, and nsp8 to -12. PRRSV mainly targets primary porcine alveolar macrophages. however, PRRSV is sensitive to IFNs, which is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. the 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot variants suppressed PRRSV replication in PAMs. the predicted similar structures of equine arteritis virus (EAV) and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) exhibited similar effects. a slight increase of IFN- and IFN-1 was not observed until 6 hpi or 12 hpi with BJ-4 and HN07-1. PRRSV RNA was detected at 6 hpi and continued to increase rapidly at 12 hpi before decreasing at 24 hpi in BJ-4-infected cells. IFN induction in CRL2843-CD163 and PAMs in response to PRRSV infection. some genes induced by HN07-1 exhibited a delayed and lower response compared with that of the BJ-4 strain. at 24, 48, and 72 hpi, the IFN- mRNA levels in the cells were determined by qRT-PCR. total RNA was extracted from cell lysates. IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-1, PKR, OAS, ISG56, and MX1 were quantified by qRT-PCR. endosomal TLR3/7 were relevant to PRRSV-induced IFN- production. we used short interfering RNA (siRNA) to specifically knock down endogenous expression of TLR3/7 as well as the cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5. the effects of these gene knockdowns on IFN- induction were evaluated. IFN induction by PRRSV is dependent on cytosolic sensors RIG-I, MDA5, and endosomal TLR3. CRL2843-CD163 cells were pretreated with 0 M, 20 M, 40 M, or 80 M chloroquine for 1 h, followed by infection with PRRSV BJ-4 (MOI of 1) after 24 h. the 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot region of PRRSV genome RNA is a key element for IFN induction. we then used an in vitro transcription system to generate the entire 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR of PRRSV and characterized their immunoreactivities by transfection into PAMs. three truncated mutants of the 3\u2032 UTR (1-16&131-151, 15-84, and 79-131) test their immune-stimulatory abilities in PAMs and CRL2843-CD163 or PAMs. results showed none of these eight fragments showed IFN- increase in CRL2843-CD163 or PAMs. RNA was isolated to determine IFN- and IFN- mRNA levels. truncated fragments of this 3\u2032 UTR structure were synthesized by in vitro transcription. they were synthesized by in vitro transcription. the 50-151 fragment, also designated the pseudoknot structure, induced the most IFN-. the pseudoknot fragments of HP-PRRSV strain HN07-1 and PRRSV strain BJ-4 largely increased IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 mRNA expression at 6 h and 12 h. the pseudoknot fragments increased IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 mRNA expression at 6 h and 12 h. cells were harvested 0, 6, 12, or 24 h later for dual-luciferase assay. cells were transfected with 1 g of 3\u2032 UTR 1-151 or 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcripts of PRRSV BJ-4 genome for 6 h, 12 h, or 24 h. the base pairing was restored in mutant SW12 by exchanging the seven nucleotides in the core of SL1 and SL2 simultaneously. the orientation of the central seven nucleotides in SL1 and SL2 was changed in mutant OR12, which restored the base-pairing possibilities. the mutants OR1 and OR2 were generated by changing the orientation of the central seven nucleotides in the loop of SL1 or SL2. siRNA targeting RIG-I and TLR3 markedly reduced IFN-, IFN-, ISG56, and MX1 expression in PAMs transfected with pseudoknot of BJ-4. the protein levels of RIG-I and MDA5 were also detected. the HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding Flag-pRIG-I. they were incubated with biotinylated RNA as indicated and subjected to pulldown. the plasmid encoding Flag-pRIG-I was used as a positive control. flag-pRIG-I is composed of three main structural domains. two CARD domains at the N terminus for signal transduction, the central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain and C-terminal domain (RD) for RNA binding (12, 15) results strongly suggested that the C-terminal portion of RIG-I (pRIG-I-RD) pRIG-I-RD and BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcript chromatograms were mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio on ice for 1 h. the pRIG-I-RD and BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcripts were synthesized by in vitro transcription as mentioned above. the pseudoknot of the PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR had an anti-PRRSV effect in PAMs. the mutant SW1 transcripts were inoculated with BJ-4 (MOI of 1) for 24 h or 18 h. transfection with pseudoknot segments significantly suppressed PRRSV replication in PAMs. PAMs were transfected with BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknots, BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot SW1 transcripts, 1 g poly(IC), or no-RNA control. cells then were infected with PRRSV BJ-4 for 12 h or 18 h. pseudoknot mutant SW1-induced IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 expression levels were significantly reduced compared with those of the control. results suggest PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot segments could induce significant IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 expression and have an anti-PRRSV effect. the sequence alignments revealed that the pseudoknot sequences were conserved in different arteriviruses. the predicted results showed that other arterivirus members, including EAV, LDV, and SHFV, possessed pseudoknot structure. previous reports obtained evidence of the pseudoknot interaction near the 3\u2032 end of the EAV genome. the mutants SW4, SW5, OR4 and OR5 exhibited lower IFN induction than the original pseudoknot of EAV. the results strongly demonstrated that the pseudoknot interaction was important for IFN induction, which was conserved among arteriviruses. for PRRSV type 1 (European type), the isolates shown were Lelystad (M96262), 14432/2011 (KR296711), LV4.2.1 (AY588319), DV (KF991509), EuroPRRSV (AY366525), and Olot/91 (X92942) for EAV, the isolates shown were Bucyrus (NC_002532), Vienna (X78497), CW01 (AY349168), and PRRSV induces an antiviral response in PAMs. results showed that PRRSV significantly increased IFN- mRNA production in CRL2843-CD163 upon HN07-1 and BJ-4 infection. the results indicated a difference in IFN induction between HP-PRRSV HN07-1 and PRRSV strain BJ-4. all of them were upregulated after PRRSV infection and peaked at 24 hpi. PRRSV RNA was detected at 6 hpi and continued to increase rapidly at 12 hpi. at 24, 48, and 72 hpi, the IFN- mRNA levels in the cells were determined by qRT-PCR. transfection of 1 g poly(IC) was used as a positive control. and MX1 were quantified by qRT-PCR at the indicated times. RE, relative expression. RLU, relative luciferase units. data are expressed as means SEM from three independent experiments. PRRSV titers in the supernatant were assessed by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. decreased expression of RIG-I, MDA5, and TLR3, but not TLR7, significantly increased the viral yields at least 2.18-fold compared to that of control CRL2843-CD163 cells. IFN- mRNA production was determined by qRT-PCR. at 36 hpi, total RNAs were subjected to qRT-PCR analysis for IFN- and IFN- mRNA. we used an in vitro transcription system to generate the entire 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR of PRRSV and characterized their immunoreactivities by transfection into PAMs. as expected, transfection of 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR induced IFN- and IFN- with a dose-dependent increase (Fig. 3A and B) RNA was isolated to determine IFN- and IFN- mRNA levels. at 6 h posttransfection, RNA was isolated to determine IFN- and IFN- mRNA levels. a schematic representation of 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR of BJ-4 was shown. truncated fragments of this 3\u2032 UTR structure were synthesized by in vitro transcription. their immunoactivities then were detected by transfection into PAMs. the 50-151 fragment, also designated the pseudoknot structure, induced the most IFN-. PAMs were transfected with 1 g of 3\u2032 UTR 1-151 or 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcripts of PRRSV BJ-4 genome for 6 h, 12 h, or 24 h. mRNA levels in the cells were analyzed by qRT-PCR. FN-, IFN-, and ISG56 mRNA levels in the cells were analyzed by qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR used 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 g of the 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcripts for 6 h (F) or 12 h (G) the mutants OR12 and SW12 showed the most robust IFN- and IFN- mRNA response, similar to that of the original pseudoknot structure. the mutants OR1 and OR2 were generated by changing the orientation of the central seven nucleotides in the loop of SL1 or SL2. the base-pairing possibilities were restored in mutant SW12. siRNA targeting RIG-I and TLR3 markedly reduced IFN-, IFN-, ISG56, and MX1 expression in PAMs transfected with pseudoknot of BJ-4. siRNA targeting MDA5 and TLR7 did not. signaling cascades leading to IFN-, IFN-, ISG56, and MX1 mRNA induction are initiated by RIG-I and TLR3. HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding Flag-pRIG-I. they were incubated with biotinylated RNA as indicated and subjected to pulldown. previous studies have demonstrated that the 5\u2032-triphosphate end of RNA generated by viral polymerases is responsible for RIG-I recognition. the ectodomain of pTLR3 (pTLR3-ECD) interacted with the pseudoknot labeled by biotinylated nucleotide but not the cytoplasm of pTLR3 (pTLR3-TIR) these data demonstrated a strong and specific interaction between the pseudoknot region of the BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR and RIG-I and TLR3. the pRIG-I-RD and BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcript chromatograms were mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio on ice for 1 h. plotted are UV absorption profiles (260 nm and 280 nm) the retention volumes for each elution are shown on the chromatograms. the pseudoknot segments reduced the viral yields at least 2-fold compared to those of control cells at 12 hpi or 18 hpi in supernatant. in contrast, the pseudoknot mutant SW1 showed no inhibiting effects on PRRSV titer at 12 hpi and weakly inhibiting effect at 18 hpi. PAMs were transfected with BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot, BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot SW1 transcripts, or no-RNA control. cells then were infected with PRRSV BJ-4 for 12 or 18 h, and IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 were analyzed. pseudoknot interaction is conserved among all known arteriviruses. alignment of the 3\u2032 end of different arteriviruses was performed. pseudoknot interaction regions were identical to that of the standard isolate VR-2332. the predicted pseudoknot regions of EAV, PRRSV, LDV, or SHFV were generated and transfected into PAMs for 6 h or 12 h. the results indicated that all predicted pseudoknot regions of EAV, PRRSV, LDV, and SHFV induced IFN- and IFN- mRNA increase. we then further ensured that the pseudoknot interaction was crucial for IFN induction. for PRRSV type 2 (European type), the isolates were VR2332 (U87392), BJ-4 (AF331831), A2MC2 (JQ087873), HN1 (AY457635), LMY (DQ473474), HN07-1 (KX766378), 15GD1 (KX815407), P129 (AF494042), CH-1a (AY032626), FJZ03 (KP860909), F the predicted pseudoknot of EAV (Brucyrus), SHFV (M6941 [accession number KM371105]), LDV (Plagemann [accession number U15146]) and PRRSV (VR2332 [accession number U87392]) are shown. RNA pseudoknot structure residing in the PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR was directly involved in IFN induction. disruption of loop interaction inside the pseudoknot by introducing nucleotide mutation impaired IFN production. 3\u2032 UTR synthesized full-length and truncated RNA using in vitro transcription system or chemical synthesis. none of the truncated segments showed the remarkable IFN response. previous studies have demonstrated that the subgenomic RNAs of Nidovirales viruses generate a nested 3\u2032-coterminal set of subgenomic mRNAs. studies on bovine coronavirus obtained enzymatic probing evidence for the existence of the pseudoknot of synthetic transcripts (69). the pseudoknot fragments used in this study were synthesized by in vitro transcription in our study. previous studies have shown that PRRSV induced weaker responses than sensitive IFN agonists. recognition of viruses is the initiation of antiviral immune response. this suggests that PRRSV components indeed have its ability to induce antiviral signaling, whereas the proteins of PRRSV, especially nsps, inhibit host antiviral immune responses. RIG-I senses RNA with uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphates (81), base-paired structures, or panhandle structures. RIG-I senses short dsRNAs, while MDA5 senses long dsRNAs (36, 82). RNA (81, 85), and Devarkar et al. demonstrated the interaction of the helicase-RD domain with Cap-0 dsRNA as well as 5\u2032ppp RNA through determining the structures of the complexes. the RD domain of RIG-I is crucial for RNA recognition. the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm. the genomic RNA serves as the mRNA for immediate translation of the large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. after cleavage, these proteins assemble into a replication and transcription complex (RTC) the cell lines CRL2843 (3D4/21) and CRL2843-CD163 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. the cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. mutants of RIG-I and TLR3 were generated by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using RNA extracted from CRL2843-CD163 cells as templates and inserted into pEF-BOS vector. the full-length 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR sequences were amplified by RT-PCR using RNA extracted from PRRSV BJ-4-infected PAMs. anti-RIG-I (D33H10), anti-actin (13E5), anti-actin (13E5), anti-actin (13E5), anti-actin (13E5), anti-actin (13E5), and anti-actin (13E5). mouse anti-Flag (D74E4) antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5,000. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was set up as an endogenous control. a plasmid bearing a fragment of the PRRSV ORF7 sequence (372 bp) was constructed to generate a standard curve, and then PRRSV RNA copies were calculated by normalization to the standard curve. siRNA sequences target gene Target sequence (5\u20323\u2032) DDX58 (RIG-I) GCAGGUUAUUCUGGACUUUTT MDA5 CCUCAGAUAUUGGGACUAATT TLR3 GCUUAAGUGUG. siRNA sequences target gene Target sequence (5\u20323\u2032) DDX58 (RIG-I). cells were transfected with 1 g IFN--Luc and 100 ng pRL-TK renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) as an internal control. cells were inoculated with PRRSV at 24 h or transfected with 1 g full-length 3\u2032 UTR or truncated fragments, including 1-151, 50-88, or pseudoknot fragment of the 3\u2032 UTR.

CRL2843-CD163 cells were pretreated with 0 M, 20 M, 40 M, or 80 M chloroquine for 1 h, followed by infection with PRRSV BJ-4 (MOI of 1) after 24 h. the 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot region of PRRSV genome RNA is a key element for IFN induction. we then used an in vitro transcription system to generate the entire 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR of PRRSV and characterized their immunoreactivities by transfection into PAMs. three truncated mutants of the 3\u2032 UTR (1-16&131-151, 15-84, and 79-131) test their immune-stimulatory abilities in PAMs and CRL2843-CD163 or PAMs. results showed none of these eight fragments showed IFN- increase in CRL2843-CD163 or PAMs. RNA was isolated to determine IFN- and IFN- mRNA levels. truncated fragments of this 3\u2032 UTR structure were synthesized by in vitro transcription. they were synthesized by in vitro transcription. the 50-151 fragment, also designated the pseudoknot structure, induced the most IFN-. the pseudoknot fragments of HP-PRRSV strain HN07-1 and PRRSV strain BJ-4 largely increased IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 mRNA expression at 6 h and 12 h. the pseudoknot fragments increased IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 mRNA expression at 6 h and 12 h. cells were harvested 0, 6, 12, or 24 h later for dual-luciferase assay. cells were transfected with 1 g of 3\u2032 UTR 1-151 or 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcripts of PRRSV BJ-4 genome for 6 h, 12 h, or 24 h. the base pairing was restored in mutant SW12 by exchanging the seven nucleotides in the core of SL1 and SL2 simultaneously. the orientation of the central seven nucleotides in SL1 and SL2 was changed in mutant OR12, which restored the base-pairing possibilities. the mutants OR1 and OR2 were generated by changing the orientation of the central seven nucleotides in the loop of SL1 or SL2. siRNA targeting RIG-I and TLR3 markedly reduced IFN-, IFN-, ISG56, and MX1 expression in PAMs transfected with pseudoknot of BJ-4. the protein levels of RIG-I and MDA5 were also detected. the HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding Flag-pRIG-I. they were incubated with biotinylated RNA as indicated and subjected to pulldown. the plasmid encoding Flag-pRIG-I was used as a positive control. flag-pRIG-I is composed of three main structural domains. two CARD domains at the N terminus for signal transduction, the central DExD/H box RNA helicase domain and C-terminal domain (RD) for RNA binding (12, 15) results strongly suggested that the C-terminal portion of RIG-I (pRIG-I-RD) pRIG-I-RD and BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcript chromatograms were mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio on ice for 1 h. the pRIG-I-RD and BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcripts were synthesized by in vitro transcription as mentioned above. the pseudoknot of the PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR had an anti-PRRSV effect in PAMs. the mutant SW1 transcripts were inoculated with BJ-4 (MOI of 1) for 24 h or 18 h. transfection with pseudoknot segments significantly suppressed PRRSV replication in PAMs. PAMs were transfected with BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknots, BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot SW1 transcripts, 1 g poly(IC), or no-RNA control. cells then were infected with PRRSV BJ-4 for 12 h or 18 h. pseudoknot mutant SW1-induced IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 expression levels were significantly reduced compared with those of the control. results suggest PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot segments could induce significant IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 expression and have an anti-PRRSV effect. the sequence alignments revealed that the pseudoknot sequences were conserved in different arteriviruses. the predicted results showed that other arterivirus members, including EAV, LDV, and SHFV, possessed pseudoknot structure. previous reports obtained evidence of the pseudoknot interaction near the 3\u2032 end of the EAV genome. the mutants SW4, SW5, OR4 and OR5 exhibited lower IFN induction than the original pseudoknot of EAV. the results strongly demonstrated that the pseudoknot interaction was important for IFN induction, which was conserved among arteriviruses. for PRRSV type 1 (European type), the isolates shown were Lelystad (M96262), 14432/2011 (KR296711), LV4.2.1 (AY588319), DV (KF991509), EuroPRRSV (AY366525), and Olot/91 (X92942) for EAV, the isolates shown were Bucyrus (NC_002532), Vienna (X78497), CW01 (AY349168), and PRRSV induces an antiviral response in PAMs. results showed that PRRSV significantly increased IFN- mRNA production in CRL2843-CD163 upon HN07-1 and BJ-4 infection. the results indicated a difference in IFN induction between HP-PRRSV HN07-1 and PRRSV strain BJ-4. all of them were upregulated after PRRSV infection and peaked at 24 hpi. PRRSV RNA was detected at 6 hpi and continued to increase rapidly at 12 hpi. at 24, 48, and 72 hpi, the IFN- mRNA levels in the cells were determined by qRT-PCR. transfection of 1 g poly(IC) was used as a positive control. and MX1 were quantified by qRT-PCR at the indicated times. RE, relative expression. RLU, relative luciferase units. data are expressed as means SEM from three independent experiments. PRRSV titers in the supernatant were assessed by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. decreased expression of RIG-I, MDA5, and TLR3, but not TLR7, significantly increased the viral yields at least 2.18-fold compared to that of control CRL2843-CD163 cells. IFN- mRNA production was determined by qRT-PCR. at 36 hpi, total RNAs were subjected to qRT-PCR analysis for IFN- and IFN- mRNA. we used an in vitro transcription system to generate the entire 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR of PRRSV and characterized their immunoreactivities by transfection into PAMs. as expected, transfection of 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR induced IFN- and IFN- with a dose-dependent increase (Fig. 3A and B) RNA was isolated to determine IFN- and IFN- mRNA levels. at 6 h posttransfection, RNA was isolated to determine IFN- and IFN- mRNA levels. a schematic representation of 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR of BJ-4 was shown. truncated fragments of this 3\u2032 UTR structure were synthesized by in vitro transcription. their immunoactivities then were detected by transfection into PAMs. the 50-151 fragment, also designated the pseudoknot structure, induced the most IFN-. PAMs were transfected with 1 g of 3\u2032 UTR 1-151 or 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcripts of PRRSV BJ-4 genome for 6 h, 12 h, or 24 h. mRNA levels in the cells were analyzed by qRT-PCR. FN-, IFN-, and ISG56 mRNA levels in the cells were analyzed by qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR used 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 g of the 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcripts for 6 h (F) or 12 h (G) the mutants OR12 and SW12 showed the most robust IFN- and IFN- mRNA response, similar to that of the original pseudoknot structure. the mutants OR1 and OR2 were generated by changing the orientation of the central seven nucleotides in the loop of SL1 or SL2. the base-pairing possibilities were restored in mutant SW12. siRNA targeting RIG-I and TLR3 markedly reduced IFN-, IFN-, ISG56, and MX1 expression in PAMs transfected with pseudoknot of BJ-4. siRNA targeting MDA5 and TLR7 did not. signaling cascades leading to IFN-, IFN-, ISG56, and MX1 mRNA induction are initiated by RIG-I and TLR3. HEK293T cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding Flag-pRIG-I. they were incubated with biotinylated RNA as indicated and subjected to pulldown. previous studies have demonstrated that the 5\u2032-triphosphate end of RNA generated by viral polymerases is responsible for RIG-I recognition. the ectodomain of pTLR3 (pTLR3-ECD) interacted with the pseudoknot labeled by biotinylated nucleotide but not the cytoplasm of pTLR3 (pTLR3-TIR) these data demonstrated a strong and specific interaction between the pseudoknot region of the BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR and RIG-I and TLR3. the pRIG-I-RD and BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot transcript chromatograms were mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio on ice for 1 h. plotted are UV absorption profiles (260 nm and 280 nm) the retention volumes for each elution are shown on the chromatograms. the pseudoknot segments reduced the viral yields at least 2-fold compared to those of control cells at 12 hpi or 18 hpi in supernatant. in contrast, the pseudoknot mutant SW1 showed no inhibiting effects on PRRSV titer at 12 hpi and weakly inhibiting effect at 18 hpi. PAMs were transfected with BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot, BJ-4 3\u2032 UTR pseudoknot SW1 transcripts, or no-RNA control. cells then were infected with PRRSV BJ-4 for 12 or 18 h, and IFN-, IFN-, and ISG56 were analyzed. pseudoknot interaction is conserved among all known arteriviruses. alignment of the 3\u2032 end of different arteriviruses was performed. pseudoknot interaction regions were identical to that of the standard isolate VR-2332. the predicted pseudoknot regions of EAV, PRRSV, LDV, or SHFV were generated and transfected into PAMs for 6 h or 12 h. the results indicated that all predicted pseudoknot regions of EAV, PRRSV, LDV, and SHFV induced IFN- and IFN- mRNA increase. we then further ensured that the pseudoknot interaction was crucial for IFN induction. for PRRSV type 2 (European type), the isolates were VR2332 (U87392), BJ-4 (AF331831), A2MC2 (JQ087873), HN1 (AY457635), LMY (DQ473474), HN07-1 (KX766378), 15GD1 (KX815407), P129 (AF494042), CH-1a (AY032626), FJZ03 (KP860909), F the predicted pseudoknot of EAV (Brucyrus), SHFV (M6941 [accession number KM371105]), LDV (Plagemann [accession number U15146]) and PRRSV (VR2332 [accession number U87392]) are shown. RNA pseudoknot structure residing in the PRRSV 3\u2032 UTR was directly involved in IFN induction. disruption of loop interaction inside the pseudoknot by introducing nucleotide mutation impaired IFN production. 3\u2032 UTR synthesized full-length and truncated RNA using in vitro transcription system or chemical synthesis. none of the truncated segments showed the remarkable IFN response. previous studies have demonstrated that the subgenomic RNAs of Nidovirales viruses generate a nested 3\u2032-coterminal set of subgenomic mRNAs. studies on bovine coronavirus obtained enzymatic probing evidence for the existence of the pseudoknot of synthetic transcripts (69). the pseudoknot fragments used in this study were synthesized by in vitro transcription in our study. previous studies have shown that PRRSV induced weaker responses than sensitive IFN agonists. recognition of viruses is the initiation of antiviral immune response. this suggests that PRRSV components indeed have its ability to induce antiviral signaling, whereas the proteins of PRRSV, especially nsps, inhibit host antiviral immune responses. RIG-I senses RNA with uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphates (81), base-paired structures, or panhandle structures. RIG-I senses short dsRNAs, while MDA5 senses long dsRNAs (36, 82). RNA (81, 85), and Devarkar et al. demonstrated the interaction of the helicase-RD domain with Cap-0 dsRNA as well as 5\u2032ppp RNA through determining the structures of the complexes. the RD domain of RIG-I is crucial for RNA recognition. the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm. the genomic RNA serves as the mRNA for immediate translation of the large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. after cleavage, these proteins assemble into a replication and transcription complex (RTC) the cell lines CRL2843 (3D4/21) and CRL2843-CD163 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. the cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. mutants of RIG-I and TLR3 were generated by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using RNA extracted from CRL2843-CD163 cells as templates and inserted into pEF-BOS vector. the full-length 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR sequences were amplified by RT-PCR using RNA extracted from PRRSV BJ-4-infected PAMs. anti-RIG-I (D33H10), anti-actin (13E5), anti-actin (13E5), anti-actin (13E5), anti-actin (13E5), anti-actin (13E5), and anti-actin (13E5). mouse anti-Flag (D74E4) antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5,000. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was set up as an endogenous control. a plasmid bearing a fragment of the PRRSV ORF7 sequence (372 bp) was constructed to generate a standard curve, and then PRRSV RNA copies were calculated by normalization to the standard curve. siRNA sequences target gene Target sequence (5\u20323\u2032) DDX58 (RIG-I) GCAGGUUAUUCUGGACUUUTT MDA5 CCUCAGAUAUUGGGACUAATT TLR3 GCUUAAGUGUG. siRNA sequences target gene Target sequence (5\u20323\u2032) DDX58 (RIG-I). cells were transfected with 1 g IFN--Luc and 100 ng pRL-TK renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) as an internal control. cells were inoculated with PRRSV at 24 h or transfected with 1 g full-length 3\u2032 UTR or truncated fragments, including 1-151, 50-88, or pseudoknot fragment of the 3\u2032 UTR.

BJ-4 (GenBank accession number AF331831) was a kind gift from Hanchun Yang. expression vectors, designated pMD19T-5\u2032 UTR and pMD19T-3\u2032 UTR, were constructed for in vitro transcription. the full-length 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR cDNA sequences were amplified by RT-PCR using RNA extracted from PRRSV BJ-4-infected PAMs. the first two nucleotides of the antisense 5\u2032 termini were modified with 2-O-Me (2\u2032-O-methyl) antibodies and reagents were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (CST) lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. membranes were incubated with antibodies diluted to the following levels. cDNA was prepared from total RNAs using a TRIzol reagent kit. gene-specific primers for pig IFN-, IFN-, IFN-1, PKR, OAS, ISG56, MX1, DDX58 (RIG-I), MDA5, TLR3, TLR7, PRRSV ORF7, and GAPDH are listed in Table 2. the siRNAs targeting RIG-I, MDA5, TLR3, TLR7, and negative-control siRNA (NC) were designed and synthesized by GenePharma.
