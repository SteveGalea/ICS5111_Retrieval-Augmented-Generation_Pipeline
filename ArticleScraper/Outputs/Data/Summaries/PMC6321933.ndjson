{"summary": "neurotropic viral infections are associated with the accumulation of multiple B cell subsets within the central nervous system (CNS) whose composition alters with time, indicating ongoing turnover and differentiation (1\u20133). if the turnover in the CNS involves replacement by newly recruited B cells derived from the periphery. GC reactions are marked by class-switched Ig and somatic hypermutation (SHM), thereby imprinting long-lived ASC and Bmem (15\u201318). these processes are both mediated by the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which introduce mutations in DNA by deaminating the cytidine base to create uracil. uracil-DNA glycosylase and apurinic endon the vast majority of plasmablasts and IgD B cell subsets in the CNS have undergone SHM driven by viral Ag-specific B cell receptor (BCR) activation. however, identification of virus-specific ASC or Bmem generally depends on enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT) techniques using virus or viral lysates as the capture Ag. mem in the CLN and CNS of infected AIDCre-Rosa26tdTomato mice using the CD19+ tdTomato+ IgD CD138+ and the CD19+ tdTomato+ IgD CD138+ phenotype. tdTomato+ B cells only accumulated in the CNS following peripheral GC formation and continued well into the chronic infection phase. virus-specific ASC measured by ELISPOT peak at day 14 p.i., coincident with defined anatomical GC formation in CLN (1, 29). both total and virus-specific ASC only start emerging in the CNS at day 14 p.i. and increase thereafter. a small fraction of GL7+ cells showed no AID-driven tdTomato reactivity. untreated mice showed no AID-driven tdTomato reactivity. untreated mice showed no tdTomato reactivity. tdTomato+ CD138+ tdTomato+ cells were tdTomato+ at day 14 p.i. the fraction of GL7+ cells was only slightly smaller than that of tdTomato+ cells at day 14 p.i. this was confirmed by monitoring the expansion of tdTomato+ cells. the fraction of tdTomato+ cells expressing tdTomato increased to 80% by day 7 p.i. and plateaued at 90% by day 14 p.i. the results confirm AID-dependent SHM and class switch recombination (CSR) total Bmem did not show increased frequencies within CD19+ CLN B cells in infected compared to naive mice until day 21 p.i. but unlike ASC, Bmem did not demonstrate a rapid increase in the frequency of tdTomato+ cells at day 7 p.i. significant differences from the results for naive mice (day 0 p.i.) are denoted as follows: *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.01;***, P 0.001. peak numbers of virus-specific tdTomato+ B cells coincide with GC formation in the CLN. total CD19+ B cells were stable throughout day 14 p.i. and decreased thereafter, reflecting overall decreased cellularity of CLN following intracranial (i.c.) MHV infection. the absolute numbers of tdTomato+ cells were most abundant at day 14 p.i. the numbers of tdTomato+ IgD+ B cells were consistently low (3.0 104). at day 14 p.i., they comprise mainly IgD CD138 Bmem (72%) and a smaller proportion of CD138+ ASC (8%). tdTomato+ B cells localized predominantly to GCs in CLN. AIDCre-Rosa26tdTomato mice already exhibited small foci of tdTomato+ B cells within follicles, indicative of early GC formation. by day 14 p.i., tdTomato+ B cells formed large foci typical of GC morphology within follicles. these structures were maintained through day 21 p.i. and day 28 p.i. both organs harbored low numbers of CD19+ B cells in naive mice. tdTomato+ cells emerged in both brains and spinal cords at day 14 p.i. and progressively increased throughout day 28 p.i. tdTomato+ cells within the total CD19+ population did not exceed 20% in brains. numbers of CD19+ tdTomato+ cells are subdivided into CD138+ ASC, IgD CD138 Bmem, and IgD+ B cell subsets for brain and spinal cord. data represent the mean values SEM for individual mice from 2 separate experiments. data represent the mean values SEM for individual mice from 2 separate experiments, each comprising 3 to 4 individual mice per time point. IgD CD138 Bmem in spinal cords were significantly elevated at day 21 p.i. the percentage of tdTomato+ cells was already higher at day 14 p.i. tdTomato+ cells increased progressively, reaching 70% by day 28 p.i. tdTomato+ cells are concentrated in focal white matter tracks along the spinal cord, but rarely form clusters. despite their low proportions in CLN throughout persistence, ASC increased in both brains and spinal cords, resulting in proportions approximately equal to those of Bmem by day 28 p.i. tdTomato+ cells progressively accumulated in the CNS coincident with mature GC formation at days 14 to 28 p.i. it remained unclear whether they were continuously recruited from ongoing peripheral GC reactions or underwent further affinity maturation and differentiation within the CNS. hg mRNA levels were 10-fold higher in spinal cords than in brains. mRNA kinetics were similar to those in MHV-JHMv2.2-1-infected mice. tdTomato+ B cells in the CNS after day 20 p.i. would imply that these cells were derived from protracted peripheral GC reactions sustained during the chronic phase. CLN, brain, and spinal cord cells were thus assessed for the presence of tdTomato+ ASC and Bmem cells by flow cytometry 8 days after initial tamoxifen administration. data represent the mean values SEM for individual mice from 2 separate experiments, each comprising 2 to 3 individual mice per time point and group. in the brains and spinal cords of infected mice, the frequency of tdTomato+ cells in total CD19+ B cells was significantly decreased in mice receiving tamoxifen beginning at day 20 p.i. compared to the frequency in mice receiving treatment from day 0 p.i. phenotypically precedes virus-specific ASC by 7 days p.i. (23) both total and virus-specific ASC start emerging in the CNS at day 14 p.i.. we therefore questioned whether early ASC expansion is driven by Ag-independent innate immune signaling. naive mice treated with tamoxifen 2 days prior to analysis and MHV-infected mice from day 0 throughout day 14 prior to analysis. gating on CD19+ B cells from naive mice (A) or infected mice at 14 days p.i. (B) tdTomato+ GL7+ cells were tdTomato+ (Fig. 1D) consistent with GC formation (4, 32) compared frequencies of CD138+ tdTomato+ ASC to virus-specific ELISPOT analyses in CLN and brains at day 14 p.i. gregation into structurally mature GC defined by dark- and light-zone domains by day 21 p.i. following infection with the JHMv2.2-1 virus variant (1). results confirm AID-dependent SHM and class switch recombination (CSR), typical of GC B cells, and showed maintenance of GC activity out to day 28 p.i. Bmem and ASC exhibited similar fractions of tdTomato+ cells in naive CLN (7%) despite this initial divergence, the tdTomato+ fraction in Bmem increased to 50% at day 14 p.i. and remained stable out to day 28 p.i. tdTomato+ cells coincide with GC formation in the CLN. data for tdTomato-negative (tdTomato) cells are represented in black. data for tdTomato+ cells are shown in red. total ASC peaked at day 7 p.i. (2.0 104), prior to maximum GL7+ B cells (8.0 104) by day 28 p.i., ASC declined rapidly, reaching only 2 103. the high proportion (65%) of ASC expressing tdTomato at day 7 p.i. thus surpassed AID-expressing ASC numbers during maximal GC differentiation after day 14 p.i. the numbers of tdTomato+ IgD+ B cells were consistently low (3.0 104). at day 14 p.i., they comprised mainly IgD CD138 Bmem (72%) and a smaller proportion of CD138+ ASC (8%). tdTomato+ B cells localized predominantly to GCs in CLN. by day 14 p.i., tdTomato+ B cells formed large foci typical of GC morphology within follicles. these structures were maintained through day 21 p.i. and day 28 p.i. overall, these kinetics of GC formation are similar to those of infection with MHV-JHM2.2v-1 (1). however, the maximum GL7+ tdTomato+ populations nevertheless coincide with mature GC formation. tdTomato+ cells emerged in both brains and spinal cords at day 14 p.i. and progressively increased throughout day 28 p.i. whereas the proportion of tdTomato+ cells within the total CD19+ population did not exceed 20% in brains, it reached nearly 80% in spinal cords at day 28 p.i. data represent the mean values SEM for individual mice from 2 separate experiments, each comprising 3 to 4 individual mice per time point. asterisks in red or black denote significant differences in the tdTomato+ or total population. tdTomato+ cells dominate the ASC and Bmem subsets in spinal cords. IgD CD138 Bmem in spinal cords were significantly elevated at day 21 p.i. and reached 6-fold-higher levels than in naive mice by day 28 p.i. the percentage of tdTomato+ B cells was already higher at day 14 p.i. and increased progressively, reaching 70% by day 28 p.i. histological evaluation of spinal cords for tdTomato+ cells at day 21 p.i. supported prominent localization to white matter tracks. in the brain, more differentiated IgG+ B cells preferentially accumulated in the parenchyma with a scattered rather than clustered pattern. tamoxifen-treated MHV-A59-infected AIDCre-Rosa26tdTomato mice exhibited detectable Aicda transcripts. mRNA levels were assessed as a measure of ASC IgG secretion. levels were overall 4 orders of magnitude (104) lower than in CLN. Ighg mRNA levels were overall lower in the CNS than in CLN. the 100-fold-higher ratio of Aicda relative to Ighg mRNA levels in CLN versus spinal cords confirmed minimal local AID activity in the CNS. mice receiving tamoxifen starting at day 20 p.i. showed a frequency of 30% tdTomato+ cells in the CD138+ ASC population. the frequencies of tdTomato+ cells within the GL7+ GC phenotype B cells were similar, at 80%. these results support continual selection and turnover of virus-specific B cells in the CLN, consistent with ongoing GC reactions during chronic infection. the frequency of tdTomato+ cells in total CD19+ B cells was significantly decreased in mice receiving tamoxifen beginning at day 20 p.i. compared to the frequency in mice receiving treatment from day 0 p.i. the frequencies of CD19+ B cells within CD45HI infiltrates were not significantly different between treatment groups in either the brains or spinal cords. however, these mice exhibited appreciable accumulations of tdTomato+ B cells, reaching tdTomato+ population was comprised of similar proportions of CD138+ ASC and IgD CD138 Bmem. CD138+ tdTomato+ ASC peaked at day 7 p.i., accounting for 65% of total ASC. these ASC were previously interpreted to result from innate bystander activation. accelerated substantially out to day 28 p.i. following the formation of peripheral GCs in CLN. but tdTomato+ B cell numbers declined after day 14 p.i. the progressive increase in tdTomato+ B cells in the CNS thus supported the idea of ongoing egress of GC-matured B cells from CLN and subsequent migration to the persistently infected CNS. tdTomato+ Bmem and ASC were sparse at day 7 p.i., and increase by day 14 p.i. coincided with overt GC formation. tdTomato+ Bmem accounted for nearly 50% of tdTomato+ Bmem cells by day 28 p.i. tdTomato+ B cells were derived from B cells initiating AID-driven tdTomato expression after day 20 p.i. tamoxifen administration supported 20% of tdTomato+ B cells. tdTomato+ B cells were derived from B cells initiating AID-driven tdTomato expression after day 20 p.i. tamoxifen treatment is consistent with the notion that ongoing recruitment primarily involves ASC still undergoing SHM after day 20 p.i. we have excluded de novo AID expression within the CNS based on previous analysis of mRNA transcript levels from IgD CD138 Bmem and CD138+ ASC. mice of 6 to 8 weeks of age were infected by intracranial injection with 2,000 PFU of hepato- and neurotropic MHV-A59. mice were administered 3 mg of tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) via oral gavage every other day. saline (PBS)-perfused mice were mechanically homogenized in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS using ice-cold Tenbroeck grinders. the suspensions were centrifuged at 450 g for 7 min at 4\u00b0C. cells were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer. sterile white 96-well filter plates with 0.45-m-pore-size hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane were stripped with 70% ethanol for 2 min, washed with 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer. wells were washed with washing buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in 1 PBS) and blocked with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) in RPMI medium for approximately 16 h at 4\u00b0C CLN and spinal cords from PBS-perfused mice were snap-frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetex, Torrance, CA) and sectioned at 10 m (CLN) or 12 m (spinal cords) using a leica CM3050 S cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA) slide-mounted tissue sections were fixed with 4% electron microscopy (EM)-grade paraform images were analyzed using Image J software (NIH; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij) implementing the FIJI plugin set. CLN, brains, and spinal cords harvested from individual mice were snap-frozen, treated with 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), and homogenized using a TissueLyser and stainless steel beads. all results are expressed as the mean values standard errors of the means (SEM) data were plotted and statistical significance determined utilizing GraphPad Prism 6 software. mice were administered 3 mg of tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) via oral gavage every other day. treatment was initiated at day 0 p.i. unless otherwise stated. cells were isolated from the CNS as described previously. cells were then washed with FACS buffer, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed on a BD LSR II or FACSAria III flow cytometer. the data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR) washes with washing buffer and 1 PBS, respectively, diaminobenzadine (DAB) solution added to visualize spots. after spots had developed sufficiently, the reaction was stopped by flushing wells with H20 and the plates left to dry in the dark. rat and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-hamster Abs were stained overnight at 4\u00b0C. sections were mounted with Vectashield hard-set mounting medium with DAPI. images were analyzed using Image J software (NIH; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij) mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), activation-induced cytidine deaminase and immunoglobulin gamma heavy chain (Ighg) were determined using TaqMan universal master mix."}
