{"summary": "pancreatic cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths in the united states [1] and has the lowest 5-year survival rate (7%) for solid tumors [2] largely owing to the fact that radiation, surgery, and current chemotherapy options are ineffective. new treatment strategies are essential because mesothelin is overexpressed in a high percentage of ovarian cancers, pancreatic cancers, non\u2013small lung cancers, and mesotheliomas. chimeric antibodies, immunotoxins, and drug conjugates that bind mesothelin are being tested as well as chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T cells) the most well-characterized recombinant immunotoxins against mesothelin are SS1P and monoclonal antibodies are MORAb-009 [16]. avian poxvirus vector entered NIH-sponsored Phase 2b/3 trials in 2016. vaccinia virus is the most commonly used poxvirus vaccine vector. but its use is limited by its potential virulence, especially in immunocompromised hosts. panc02 cells were grown in RPMI, with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. this has a great advantage over tumor studies performed with xeno- or allografts in immunocompromised mice. mesothelin was cloned into a vector (pLW44, a gift from L. Wyatt, National Institutes of Health) in both cases, mesothelin was cloned into a vector. recombinant viruses were selected, purified, and analyzed to confirm the genotype by raid prep PCR analysis. western blot BHK cells (2x106cells/well) were uninfected or infected with the 3 MVA viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 plaque forming units (pfu, infectious virus particles) of virus per cell for 13 h in 5% CO2 atmosphere. cells were lysed with disruption buffer and heat inactivated at 95\u00b0C for five minutes. mice were kept in conventional conditions with full access to food and water. all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. mice injected i.m. (n = 5) with PBS, normal wild type MVA, or MVAmesoA35Del. a virus (MOI = 3), or Lewis Lung cells, does not express mouse mesothelin [7], followed by incubation for 40 h at 37\u00b0C. plates were developed with an agarose-BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3- indolylphosphate)-AMP mixture. spots were counted by using a dissection microscope. mice were injected with 3.8 x 107 pfu/mouse i.m. in 25 ul. mice were injected i.m. with 3.8 x 107 pfu/mouse i.m. in 25 ul. mice were boosted 1 month later with 1.5 x 107 pfu/mouse. panc02 cells were grown in RPMI, with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. Vaccinia virus, MVA, and the MVA A35 deletion mutant viruses were previously described. othelin was cloned into a vector (pLW44, a gift from L. Wyatt, National Institutes of Health) designed for insertion into an area of the MVA genome where genes had been naturally deleted during passage of the virus. recombinant viruses were selected, purified, and analyzed to confirm the presence of the mesothelin gene by raid prep PCR analysis. cells were lysed with disruption buffer and heat inactivated at 95\u00b0C for five minutes. DNA was sheered using a 22-gauge needle and samples were loaded onto a pre-cast 4\u201320% gradient gel for SDS-PAGE and transferred overnight. membrane was blocked for 30 minutes at room temperature with 1% fat free milk in TBS. we injected mice i.m. (n = 5) with PBS, normal wild type MVA, MVAmeso, or MVAmesoA35Del (3.8 x 107 pfu/mouse i.m. in 25 ul, and boosted 1 month later with 1.5 x 107 pfu/mouse i.m. in 25 ul. we monitored mouse health daily by body score condition and weight up to 125 days. 350,000 cells were plated in a 24-well plate. panc02 cells were infected with MVA at an MOI of 5 pfu/cell for 2 h. inocula were removed and cells were washed once. female C57BL/6 mice were injected s.c. in the right flank with Panc02 cells (6.4x105), one injection per mouse, under isoflurane (3%) inhalation anesthesia. mice were humanely euthanized if they reach endpoints of body condition score, tumor size, ulceration, or impairment. mesothelin protein was detected as a broad band 50 kDa. mesothelin protein was strongly expressed in both MVA mesothelin virus-infected BHK cells, with monomers and apparent dimers (100 kDa) but not in cells infected with the recombinant virus or uninfected BHK cells. recombinant mesothelin expressing viruses express significant quantities of mesothelin protein in infected cells. mesothelin is expressed from MVAmeso viruses. cells were lysed and samples were loaded onto a pre-cast gel. ants of BHK cells infected with the 3 MVA viruses were detected by Western blot. several protein bands that react with rabbit anti mesothelin antisera were detected. recombinant mesothelin is released into supernatants. 57BL/6 mice (n = 5) were injected i.m. with PBS, MVA, MVAmeso or MVAmesoA35Del. they were monitored daily by body score condition (no change) and weight up to 125 days. no adverse effects were noted. vaccination with the MVAmesoA35Del virus induced 52% more responding T lymphocytes compared to the MVAmeso virus. splenocytes were harvested 1 month later. over 48 h the number of infectious MVA virions increased in BHK cells more than 2 logs. pfu replication in panc02 cells also increased by more than 2 logs. this suggests that the MVA viruses might be effective oncolytic viruses in vivo. panc02 cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plate. MVA was added to the wells at an MOI of 0.5 or 5.0 pfu/cell. after 24 h, 10 ul MTS/PMS was added to each well. mice were injected s.c. in one flank with 640,000 wild type Panc02 cells. mice were injected i.m. contralaterally with PBS or 7.6 x 107 pfu/mouse of MVA, MVAmeso (Meso) or MVAmesoA35Del (A35D) viruses. mice were vaccinated 2 times and then injected with tumor cells 2 weeks later. mice were allowed to grow to 100 mm3 and 3.5 x 106 pfu/mouse in 25 ul of MVA, MVAmeso (meso) or MVAmesoA35Del (A35D) viruses were injected directly into tumors 3 times. evidence suggests it is possible to generate an anti-tumor response. mesothelin is a tumor associated antigen that can be detected in panc02 murine pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line. mesothelin is a tumor associated antigen that can be detected in panc02 cells grown in vitro or as. multiple forms and sizes of cleaved mesothelin proteins have been reported to be released from cells expressing mesothelin. mesothelin protein is released into supernatants of panc02 cells, a carboxy terminal region released by furin cleavage and one derived from the amino terminus. female C57BL/6 mice (n = 5) were injected i.m. with PBS, MVA, MVAmeso or MVAmesoA35Del. no adverse effects were noted after the vaccination. mice vaccinated with MVA, MVAmeso and MVAmesoA35Del all had good responses to restimulation with vaccinia virus. vaccination with the MVAmesoA35Del virus induced 52% more responding T lymphocytes compared to the MVAmeso virus. MVA is unable to replicate in almost all mammalian cells. the tumor or microenvironment supports viral replication. we wanted to assess if MVA was able to replicate in panc02 cells. panc02 cells were uninfected or infected with an MOI of 0.5 or 5 pfu/cell. the infection was allowed to proceed for 24 h, and MTS reagent was added to measure cell metabolism. similar results were found when infecting Panc02 cells with MVAmeso and MVAmesoA35Del viruses. tumors formed by these cells were significantly smaller than the tumors expressing wild type levels of mesothelin. we also tested whether the mesothelin expressing viruses might have greater efficacy against panc02 cells that expressed higher levels of the panc02 target. injections since MVA is able to replicate in and kill Panc02 cells in vitro. tumors were allowed to grow to 100 mm3 and 3.5 x 106 pfu/mouse in 25 ul of MVA, MVAmeso (meso) or MVAmesoA35Del were injected directly into tumors 3 times, 5 days apart. the mesothelin protein was expressed in an immunogenic form by the virus in the infected mice. it was able to replicate in and kill Panc02 tumor cells grown in vitro. this suggests that it would be an effective oncolytic virus in vivo. mesothelin is known to be detectable in panc02 cells [7] and in sera from patients with mesothelin expressing tumors. this shed soluble mesothelin may be taken up by other cells and bind anti-mesothelin antibodies rendering them ineffective. new developments with CART cells [10] may be able to more effectively facilitate T cell targeting and killing of cancerous cells. anti mesothelin immune response may induce autoantibodies to target antigen. these antigen-spreading autoantibodies may cause increased damage to the animal. antigen spreading was associated with a trend toward decreased survival."}
