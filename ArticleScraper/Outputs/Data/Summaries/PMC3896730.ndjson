{"summary": "71/104 (68.3%) dogs with diarrhea were positive for at least one pathogen. a single infection in 39/71 dogs (54.9%) and co-infections in 32/71 dogs (45.1%), including 21/32 dogs (65.6%) with dual, 5/32 (15.6%) with triple, and 6/32 (18.8%) with quadruple infections. no statistical difference was observed in the duration of diarrhea or the number of deaths in the presence or absence of single or co-infections. the effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear because the rate of death and the duration of diarrhea did not seem to be affected by these factors. real-time PCR Potential enteropathogens were identified in 71/104 (68.3%) diarrheic samples in the present study, most of which contained multiples pathogens. single infections were observed in 39/71 (54.9%) positive samples and co-infection in 32/71 (45.1%) possible samples. the association of viral and bacterial infections was the most prevalent type of co-infection in the diarrheic group (37.5%). CPV-2 and canine coronavirus (CCoV) constituting 75.0% of this type of co-infection. CPV-2 was the second most prevalent pathogen, found in 36/104 (34.6%) diarrheic dogs and 0/43 (none) control dogs.

CCoV infections are characterized by high morbidity and low mortality, with typically mild enteritis in dogs [23,24], 11/12 (91.7%) diarrheic dogs with CCoV were co-infected. the most prevalent pathogens in diarrheic dogs in Brazil were C. perfringens alpha toxin, CPV-2, and Giardia spp. in this study, co-infection did not increase the duration of diarrhea. the effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear. feces included those with scores from 1 to 3, whereas control dogs had no history of gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia) and fecal samples with a score of 4. real-time PCR results for samples collected in different countries were obtained either by shipping the samples to the united states for commercial real-time PCR analysis. housekeeping gene (18S rRNA) was used to determine amounts of genomic DNA and cDNA after reverse transcription and to confirm DNA integrity. the PCR tests were based on the IDEXX proprietary RealPCRTM service platform (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME, USA) amplification efficiency, linearity, intra-run reproducibility, inter-run reproducibility, r2 value, and signal-to-noise ratio of the fluorescent signal. each assay had an analytical sensitivity of 10 molecules and an amplification efficiency between 95% and 100%. a fecal flotation procedure was performed with zinc sulfate [29] and saturated sodium chloride [30] flotation solutions. the parasitological test was performed with light microscopy by identifying the parasite eggs, larvae, cysts, and oocysts. results from 12,370 commercial samples using the same real-time PCR diarrhea panel performed in the Brazilian samples were obtained from samples originated from the united states (7829), Australia (526), Canada (2855), United Kingdom (674) and japan (486). the real-time PCR results were obtained either by shipping the samples to the united states for commercial real-time PCR analysis. ide regions were selected and two primers and a hydrolysis probe were designed to hybridize to them. an additional two primers flanking the fragment amplified in the real-time PCR assay were designed for sequence verification purposes. real-time PCR was performed with standard primer and probe concentrations using a commercially available mastermix. each assay had an analytical sensitivity of 10 molecules and an amplification efficiency between 95% and 100%. clinical samples were selected based on a reference method for each test and a correlation study was performed. the parasitological test was performed with light microscopy by identifying the parasite eggs, larvae, cysts, and oocysts according to their morphological characteristics. the results were subjected to statistical analysis with the 2 test or Fisher\u2019s exact probability."}
