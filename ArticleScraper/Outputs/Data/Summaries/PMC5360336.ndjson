{"summary": "a generic ordinal sequential trial design is proposed for a randomised clinical trial comparing an experimental treatment for an emerging infectious disease with standard care. the design is intended as an off-the-shelf, ready-to-use robust and flexible option. the trial is powered to detect a generic clinically relevant difference. the Generic Ordinal Sequential Trial (GOST) is a flexible, off-the-shelf statistical design for a randomised clinical trial comparing an experimental treatment with standard care for an emerging infectious disease. key aspects of GOST are fixed in advance so that clinicians and statisticians can immediately adopt these generic features. the trial is powered to detect a generic clinically relevant difference. total sample sizes of between 150 and 300 patients prove to be adequate in many cases. the precise value depends on both the magnitude of the treatment advantage and the nature of the ordinal scale. the special case k = 2 allows for a binary outcome such as alive or dead. a response that is available after a short and fixed duration of follow-up reduces the risk of loss to follow-up. a pilot study of conventionally treated patients might be used to determine a binary endpoint for the trial. the null hypothesis is that E has no effect, in which case PEj = PSj and so Rj = 1 for each value of j from 1 to k\u20131 is set to equal 0.025. this is the one-sided risk of type I error (denoted by ) and the value of 0.025 is chosen for GOST to follow convention. the trial will be monitored using a series of up to 20 interim analyses. such a choice will lead to around 20 to 30 new responses (totalled over S and E) being needed between consecutive interim analyses. it will also be seen that typically only 8 to 12 of these analyses will be required before the trial stops. Fig 2 shows the probability that E wins, plotted against the natural logarithm, of the true odds ratio R. when R = 1 ( = 0) the plotted probability is 0.025 and when R = 2 ( = 0.693) it is 0.90. Fig 4 shows the expected value of V at the end of the trial. Fig 3. Probability of stopping at or before the ith interim analysis, i = 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20; plotted against the true value of the log-odds ratio = logeR. the primary analysis will be based on the sequential design used, and will feature a one-sided p-value for the null hypothesis of no treatment difference. results Consider comparing an experimental treatment (E) with standard therapy (S) for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) motivated by a sudden increase in the number and geographical spread of incident cases. randomisation is 1:1. We choose D = 28 days and outcome categories C1: alive and not receiving ventilation; C3: alive and receiving only non-invasive ventilation and C4: dead.
