{"summary": "in 1977, Frederick Sanger successfully sequenced the entire genome of Phage phiv;X174 (1). since then, a huge number of virus genomes have been sequenced. INSDC makes a substantial amount of genomic data available in a public database. complete genome/segment data were identified by the description in the definition line of the flat file. we extracted genome records with the words \u2018complete genome\u2019 and \u2018complete sequence\u2019, and without the words \u2018TPA\u2019 or \u2018nearly complete\u2019 in the definition line. schema shows the system architecture and data flow of GIB-V. GIB-V uses postgreSQL as its relational database management system. genome/segment data are extracted from the DDBJ database and stored to the homology search server. the \u2018Virus Information Page\u2019 provides access to information about the individual virus genome/segment. when two or more genomes/segments are registered at the same virus name, each genome/segment can be accessed by selecting the related accession number. BLAST search GIB-V can execute a BLAST search (10) for ORF sequences. the user can select from blastn, blastp, blastx and tblastx search options. a single family or all families can be selected. the user can find either viruses or ORFs by the combinations of multiple keywords up to 5 terms. db_xref (pointer to related information in another database), EC number, function, gene name, product name, protein ID, bound moiety (molecule/complex that may bind to the given feature), phenotype, location and other qualifiers defined by INSDC can be accessed from the search results. the complete list of virus data stored in GIB-V can be viewed by clicking \u2018GENOME LIST\u2019 on the main menu bar. if two or more genomes/segments are registered at the same virus name, each genome/segment can be accessed by selecting the related accession number. the \u2018Feature List\u2019 page displays the nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence of each ORF in the list. the \u2018Feature Information\u2019 page displays the feature/qualifier information for each ORF. both the amino acid sequence and nucleic acid sequence are displayed with the feature/qualifier information. the user can find either viruses or ORFs by the combinations of multiple keywords up to 5 terms. INSDC accession number, virus name, country, note, isolate, segment, serotype, specific host and strain are usable for viruses search. the user clicks the target checkbox and download button to download the specified genome/segment data in flat file form. the download page also can be entered from each \u2018Virus Information\u2019 page. FUTURE PLANS We have developed G-InforBIO system, a tool for genome data management and sequence analysis."}
