{"summary": "the aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify the level of knowledge, perceptions and practices of HCWs on using RPE. a significant association was observed between knowledge and age, job experience, history of using respirator and marital status. Surgical masks protect HCWs from inhalation of infected droplets and microorganisms transmitted through the mouth and nose. N95 respirators provide better protection than surgical masks. but they can cause breathing resistance, heat, moisture and discomfort for users. five Occupational health and safety experts and five HCWs assessed the validity of the questionnaires. the questionnaire consisted of four components including: demographic, knowledge (22 items), perceptions (eight items) and practice (seven items) knowledge items were categorised as true (score 2), false (score 0) or don\u2019t know (score 1). practice items also were categorised as yes (score 1) and no (score 0). five Occupational health and safety experts and five HCWs assessed the validity of the questionnaires. knowledge items were categorised as true (score 2), false (score 0) or don\u2019t know (score 1). practice items also were categorised as yes (score 1) and no (score 0). value of 0.05 was used for all statistical procedures. HCWs spent an average of 3 h per day using RPE and had seven years of experience using RPE. most of the participants believed risk of respiratory hazards at their workplace was moderate to high. average scores of knowledge, perceptions and practice of HCWs on using RPE were calculated at 66.50% 11.93, 80.32% 10.05 and 70.12% 20.51 respectively. the majority of HCWs had moderate knowledge and practice (68.7% and 48.9%, respectively) and good perceptions (71.8%) regarding the use of RPE. experience of using the RPE (years)* 10 65.28 11.43 0.005 79.63 9.53 0.060 69.90 19.99 0.772 10 69.75 12.70 82.14 11.17 70.69 21.95 Experience of using the RPE (years)* 10 65.50 11.40 0.012 79.72 9.49 0.073 70.09 19.77 0.976 10 69.63 13.07 82.21 11.49 70.18 22.81 57 1.48 Janitor 29.09 4.72 32.59 4.37 5.48 1.24 Type of hospital* General 65.25 10.96 0.084 79.69 9.46 0.302 68.63 19.89 0.236 Specialty 67.69 12.71 80.92 10.57 71.52 21.05 Perceived risk of respiratory hazards in the workplace Low 61.24 13.20 0.007 79.35 13.13 0.202 67.76 23.10 0.637 Mode Powered air-purifying Respirator (PAPR) was at a moderate level. these respirators are usually used for employees who have facial hair or who cannot effectively fit the respirator on their face. however, it is necessary to promote the knowledge of studied HCWs about the use and limitation of these RPE. married individuals had significantly higher knowledge than single individuals, possibly because married individuals were older (34.49 years versus 27.17 years) and old individuals ( 35 years) had significantly higher knowledge than young counterparts (35 years)"}
