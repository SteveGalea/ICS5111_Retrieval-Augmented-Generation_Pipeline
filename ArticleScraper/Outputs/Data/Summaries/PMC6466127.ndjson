{"summary": "bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse mammals with over 1300 species distributed globally. population sizes are decreasing (22%) or unknown (57%) for a vast majority of bat species. there is limited capacity to manage and protect bat populations in much of the world. more than half of all infectious diseases that affect human populations (60%) result from pathogens that are shared with animals, both wild and domestic. 75% of emerging zoonotic diseases are attributed to pathogens with origins in wildlife reservoirs. rapid modification of the environment and human encroachment promotes interactions between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife species. a new regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in western Asia. the western Asia Bat Research Network (WAB-Net) has limited research on bats and their associated viruses. a combination of other physiological, immunological, and life history factors, some of them directly related to flight, may make bats important as viral reservoirs. bats are known to harbor diverse assemblages of viruses in at least 24 viral families. one viral family of particular concern is coronaviruses (CoVs) one viral family of particular concern is the presumptive progenitor hosts of several CoVs. bats are often assumed to harbor viruses with little to no evidence of symptoms. some bat viruses can cause morbidity or mortality in bats. a recently discovered filovirus, Lloviu virus, appears to have contributed to multiple bat die-offs in France, Spain, and Portugal in 2002. widespread application of pesticides to control crop pests has contributed to decline in regional bat populations. a more recent and unique threat to bats in western Asia is the fraudulent scheme of selling \u201cbat nests\u201d on facebook and other social media platforms. sellers claiming the \u201cnests\u201d contain \u201cred mercury\u201d that has healing properties [61]. livestock production and development, the primary threat to bats globally, is a major risk factor for zoonotic disease emergence. clearing of forested habitats, specifically for agricultural crops, leads to the direct destruction of roosting and foraging sites, and therefore displaces bat populations. cave disturbance, such as resource extraction, hunting, and ecotourism, is a major threat to bat populations. bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse, and known reservoir hosts for a diverse range of viruses with zoonotic potential. how can bat experts learn from disease experts to understand the role of human threats in altering host\u2013virus dynamics\" the agreement on the conservation of populations of European Bats (EUROBATS) is the only regional bat network to convene a multidisciplinary workshop. the workshop laid the foundation for the Resolution on Bats and Rabies in Europe. one multidisciplinary consortium, the Bat One Health Research Network (BOHRN), is now addressing these important issues at a global scale by connecting bat experts and public health researchers. monitoring ecological dynamics and interactions among bats and other wild and domestic animals coupled with behavioral and socio-economic studies of humans in shared ecosystems are hallmarks of a One Health approach. bats host a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses per species compared to other orders. a combination of other physiological, immunological, and life history factors may make them important as viral reservoirs. bats are known to harbor diverse assemblages of viruses in at least 24 viral families. bats are likely the evolutionary origin hosts of - and -CoVs and possibly all Coronaviridae. they harbor a considerable diversity of CoVs, and are the most likely evolutionary source of MERS-CoV. the virus is currently circulating in dromedary camels and is transmitted to people via camels in the middle east and north and east Africa. recently discovered filovirus, Lloviu virus, found in miniopterus schreibersii, a bat species widely distributed across Europe and Asia. it appears to have contributed to multiple bat die-offs in france, Spain, and Portugal in 2002. some bat-associated viruses, in this case a relative of Ebola and Marburg viruses, may also be pathogenic to bats. there are no documented cases of bats building nests [62]. the perceived notion that bats create such economically valuable structures has likely led to increased cave disturbance. this fraud is speculated to have originated in Iran but has quickly grown in popularity in Jordan [63] and Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Iraq [61] bats are highly mobile, and often have geographic distributions that extend across political boundaries. bats are long-lived and therefore require long-term studies that can withstand funding shortages and changes in government priorities and policies. a regional network approach can enhance bat conservation and zoonotic disease mitigation efforts. the agreement on the conservation of populations of European bats (EUROBATS) is the only regional bat network to convene a multidisciplinary workshop. collaboration is required among diverse experts, including bat conservationists, public health officials, and virologists. the workshop laid the foundation for the Resolution on Bats and Rabies in Europe and development of standardized protocols for EBLV surveillance programs in all european countries. a one health approach must synergize with individual experts in bat ecology, physiology, behavior, and genetics. a combined bat conservation and infectious disease research network de novo would allow for full integration of these two disciplines from the start. western Asia is the only contiguous block of countries that currently lack an organized network of bat researchers. a recent resurgence in bat research is reshaping our understanding of the distribution of bats in the region. a recent resurgence in bat research is reshaping our understanding of the distribution of bats in the region. the conservation status and distribution of nearly 1300 bat species has been assessed by bat experts. 96 bat species were recorded in the 20 countries of western Asia. species richness in the region has not been reassessed since 2008. many species have not been reassessed since 2008. western Asia represents a unique regional mixing pot of bat species from different zoogeographic regions. 96 bat species native to Western Asia occupy 8 of the 12 geographic regions designated by IUCN. over 90% of all species are distributed in more than one region. in Slovenia, nearly 40% of fecal samples collected from R. hipposideros tested positive for SARS-like CoVs, in particular the bat-associated SARS isolate Rp3/2004 [117]. there is also evidence that R. hipposideros contributed to a recombinant CoV strain thought to have ancestral linkages to HCoV-NL63 [118], a human-CoV that can account for up to 10% of respiratory infections annually [119]. Counts of publications that include specific search terms were mapped using packages rworldmap [122] and viridis [108] in R version 3.4.3 [109]. Counts of publications that include specific search terms were mapped using packages rworldmap [122] and viridis [108] in R version 3.4.3 [109]. globally, nearly half of all countries had less than five bat-related publications indexed in PubMed (42%, see Table S4) Western Asia, together with much of Africa, had some of the lowest numbers of bat-related publications. a few countries reported relatively high publication counts, specifically Turkey and Israel. research effort on bat-associated viruses is heavily skewed towards the united states. of the 20 countries comprising Western Asia, only two have more publications on bat-associated viruses than the global average of 20 publications/country. research effort on bat-associated CoVs significantly correlated with species richness across the 247 countries included in our analysis. 71% of all other countries reporting no published research on bat-associated CoVs. the research effort was greatly skewed towards the united states and china. more than half of the countries in western Asia had no published research on bat-associated viruses. more than half of the countries in western Asia had no published research on bat-associated viruses. conflict in several western Asia countries, ranging from war in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen, threaten the safety of wildlife researchers. a recent resurgence in bat research is reshaping our understanding of the distribution of bats in the region. a recent resurgence in bat research is reshaping our understanding of the distribution of bats in the region. the conservation status and distribution of nearly 1300 bat species has been assessed by bat experts. arid regions have the lowest species richness, including the vast majority of Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, and Iraq. estimates of species richness are lower than depicted, e.g., at least one species has been shown to be a local variant of a widespread species rather than a distinct species [102]. western Asia represents a unique regional mixing pot of bat species from different zoogeographic regions. 96 bat species native to Western Asia occupy 8 of the 12 geographic regions designated by IUCN. over 90% of all species distributed in more than one region. Rhinolophus hipposideros has been found to harbor SARS-like CoVs. in Slovenia, nearly 40% of fecal samples collected from R. hipposideros tested positive for SARS-like CoVs, in particular the bat-associated SARS isolate Rp3/2004 [117]. there is also evidence that R. hipposideros contributed to a recombinant CoV strain thought to have ancestral linkages to HCoV-NL63 [118]. Counts of publications that include specific search terms were mapped using packages rworldmap [122] and viridis [108] in R version 3.4.3 [109]. research effort based on the number of publications indexed in PubMed that included the specific search terms listed in each column by country. globally, nearly half of all countries had less than five bat-related publications indexed in PubMed (42%, see Table S4) Western Asia, together with much of Africa, had some of the lowest numbers of bat-related publications. a majority of bat species distributed in Western Asian countries are considered least concern (77%) research effort on bat-associated viruses is heavily skewed towards the united states. of the 20 countries comprising Western Asia, only two have more publications on bat-associated viruses than the global average of 20 publications/country. research effort on bat-associated CoVs significantly correlated with species richness across the 247 countries included in our analysis. 71% of all other countries reporting no published research on bat-associated CoVs. research effort was greatly skewed towards the united states and china. more than half of the countries in western Asia had no published research on bat-associated CoVs (Table 1). more than half of the countries in western Asia had no published research on bat-associated CoVs. conflict in several western Asia countries, ranging from war in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen, to political instability in Iraq and Yemen. turbulence in the region has driven an increase in international concern for global health security. but there remains limited capacity and unequal access to critical infrastructure and resources to improve biosurveillance across western Asia. despite investments by local and foreign governments to support biosafety and biosecurity programs in the region, there remains limited capacity. population trends for most bat species in Western Asia are unknown or decreasing. 9% of species lack sufficient information to even assess their conservation status. more research is needed to assess and prioritize species for conservation. surveillance or discovery studies on bat-associated viruses in western Asia is scant. the research effort was quantified as the number of publications indexed in PubMed that included the search terms (\u201cbat\u201d OR \u201dbats\u201d OR \u201cChiroptera\u201d) AND (\u201cvirus\u201d OR \u201cviruses\u201d) by country. the research effort was quantified as the number of publications indexed in PubMed that included the search terms (\u201cbat\u201d OR \u201dbats\u201d OR \u201dChiroptera\u201d) AND (\u201ccoronavirus\u201d OR \u201ccoronaviruses\u201d) by country. as expected, Saudi Arabia had the highest number of publications returned when searching for bat-associated CoV research in Western Asia. militancy in the region has deprioritized government investments in wildlife or zoonotic disease research. turbulence in the region has driven an increase in international concern for global health security. but there remains limited capacity and unequal access to critical infrastructure and resources to improve biosurveillance across western Asia. a few existing networks in the region are aligned with WAB-Net. despite the value and successes of these few established efforts, most research within the region remains either monodisciplinary, or limited in its geographic scope. a successful bat one health research program in western Asia will require hands-on, hypothesis-driven research projects that integrate applied bat ecology with disease surveillance. the initial goals of the WAB-Net research program include: identify the link between host and viral diversity, and if host-specific traits predict viral strain diversity. a system-wide, hypothesis-driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors. a system-wide, hypothesis-driven approach will allow for better identification of emerging disease risk factors, and more effective policy recommendations for reducing the disease transmission and spread [146,148]. in-service training consists of

health research networks exist to facilitate the transfer of knowledge between members. networks make it easier for members to engage in collaborative projects and leverage additional resources that may be useful in one\u2019s research. members are encouraged to share data with others in the network. workshops bring together individuals from disparate fields and provide a space for networking, data sharing, and collaboration to effectively address research gaps within a network\u2019s scope. a single 2-week bat-borne surveillance workshop held in 2014 led to a massive interconnected network of scientific relationships and output. international research is most likely to be successful if specific topics and hypotheses are identified by local (in-region) scientists and stakeholders. international research is most likely to be successful if the specific topics and hypotheses are identified by local (in-region) scientists and stakeholders. the WAB-Net research program will use field, laboratory, and analytical methods to address outstanding questions surrounding host\u2013virus dynamics. the initial goals of the research program include: identify the link between host and viral diversity; characterize the influence of environmental degradation and bat-human interactions on viral prevalence. WAB-Net aims to serve as a \u201cbridging actor\u201d within the network. it will leverage its connections with scientists and other stakeholders in the region. the central goals of WAB-Net are to provide support to existing organizations and scientists, strengthen scientific capacity building, and bring together groups. ecologists on how to properly don and remove personal protective equipment (PPE); safely capture, handle, and identify local bat species. the second is a \u201cfield-to-laboratory\u201d research exchange, designed to expose local scientists to every aspect of a multidisciplinary research project. this is especially helpful in providing researchers of a given discipline with a more complete view of what a cross-disciplinary research project entails. aims to serve as a multi-use One Health spatial database, storing ecological and viral data, and linking to other infectious disease, ecological, and biodiversity datasets. successful bat research networks rely on strong connections between members that are formed through trust, collaboration, and dialogue, and weaken or cease to exist. research findings should be reported in a manner that avoids fear-mongering statements and promotes the ecological and economic benefits of protecting local bat populations. if reporting is done improperly and in haste, consequences include the destruction of roosting sites or culling bat populations, which can undermine conservation efforts. in-service training consists of hands-on opportunities for professional training and development to build specific scientific skills. one health networks often foster multidisciplinary research that relies on the transfer of knowledge and skills between its members and across disciplines for their success. the network currently consists of two programs designed to equip network members with a diverse set of skills. network members are encouraged to share data with others in the network. members are also allowed the option to withhold certain information as deemed necessary. such databases are only successful if network participants contribute in a trusting manner. a single 2-week bat-borne surveillance workshop held in 2014 led to a massive interconnected network of scientific relationships and output. the first workshop was held in Tbilisi, Georgia, from 17\u201320 September 2018, and included 39 participants from 14 countries. websites and social media accounts can facilitate information sharing and discussion among research teams. western Asia is a region with 96 species that overlap at the biogeographic crossroads of Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe. research on bats and bat-associated viruses is highly fragmented across the region and severely limited in most countries. the western Asia bat research network will facilitate cross-border research cooperation to guard against threats posed by humans that jeopardize bat populations. the network will serve as a model for the development of additional research networks to study host\u2013virus dynamics in other taxa native to western Asia."}
