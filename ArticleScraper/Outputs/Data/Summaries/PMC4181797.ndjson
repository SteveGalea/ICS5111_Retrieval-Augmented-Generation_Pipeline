{"summary": "influenza A is one of the major viral pathogens causing pediatric acute respiratory infection (ARI) the spread of pandemic influenza A (A(H1N1)pdm09) in 2009 around the globe had a huge impact on global health. in the united states, the number of deaths due to A(H1N1)pdm09 among children was nearly four times greater than the previous seasonal influenza seasons. in the united states, the number of deaths due to A(H1N1)pdm09 among children was nearly four times greater than the previous seasonal influenza seasons. the total population in the catchment area was 198 729 with 48 260 aged 15 years and 13 935 aged less than 5 years. influenza vaccine had not been included in the national immunization program and was rarely used in our setting at the time of study. nasopharyngeal sample collection was used for nasopharyngeal sample collection. x-rays were taken within 48 hours on admission and read in accordance with the WHO radiological reading guideline. laboratory testing Collected NSP samples were processed within 3 hours and stored at 80\u00b0C. study population Our study site covers the 16 communes of Nha Trang City in Khanh Hoa Province, central Vietnam. the total population in the catchment area was 198 729 with 48 260 aged 15 years and 13 935 aged less than 5 years. laboratory testing Collected NSP samples were processed within 3 hours and stored at 80\u00b0C. RT-PCR assays targeted the influ-A matrix gene, so it can detect all influenza A viruses including A(H1N1)pdm09. a total of 2736 hospitalized ARI cases were enrolled of which 354 (129%) were positive for influ-A. influenza A genotyping was performed and 215 (61%) of the samples were genotyped of which 57 (16%) were A(H1N1)pdm09, 117 (33%) were H3N2, and 41 (12%) were seasonal H1N1. pdm09 started in November 2010 and went up till March 2011. the patterns of seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 and A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus infections among hospitalized acute respiratory infection cases are shown in Table 1. the incidence was highest among children aged 12\u201323 months (1132 per 100 000) followed by those aged 11 months (857 per 100 000). 303 (253\u2013362) 45 389 (291\u2013520) 28 303 (209\u2013437)

(A(H1N1)pdm09, n = 57). the duration for onset to hospitalization was shorter (1. the A(H1N1)pdm09 cases had lower body temperature (384 versus 397\u00b0C, P = 00003), slower pulse rate (986 versus 1142/minute, P = 00001) and less wheeze (P = 00001) compared with seasonal influenza cases. temperature (\u00b0C) 379 (09) 0001 Pulse rate (per minute) 1142 (117) 986 (127) 0001 Wheeze Yes 145 (54) 9

before and 28 after pandemic influenza outbreak were not applicable to genotyping. the incidence was highest among children aged 12\u201323 months (1132 per 100 000) followed by those aged 11 months (857 per 100 000). this pattern was similar for both pandemic and seasonal influenza cases. annual incidence of hospitalized influenza cases per 100 000 population estimated for each period among children aged 5 year was 474, 452, and 387. 66 474 (372\u2013602) 63 452 (353\u2013578) 54 387 (297\u2013505) 60 38 690 36 22 (16\u201330) 11 23 (13\u201341) 7 18 (9\u201337) 12 31 (18\u201354) 6 16

2007\u20132008 and 2008\u20132009 influenza seasons. this pre-pandemic incidence was similar to incidence data from Bangladesh which was 670 and 440 per 100 000 in 2008 and 2009. no pediatric hospitalization due to A(H1N1)pdm09 was identified in the post-pandemic season. similar reduction in influenza cases in the post-pandemic period was also reported in the united Sates from 798 during the pandemic to 365 in the next influenza season. in 2009, the WHO declared globally the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic influenza outbreak. the first case of A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected in Nha Trang on July 30, 2009. if illness is severe, they will be referred to KHGH. genetic background may also play a role because a polymorphism at IFITM3 allele (SNP rs 12252-C) has been shown to cause a reduced influenza virus restriction. a large portion of samples from 2007 and 2008 (n = 91) was not available for genotyping due to lack of samples. the study only covered the hospitalized pediatric influenza cases. 24 the influenza pneumonia incidence was slightly lower: 236 per 100 000 during 2005\u20132008 periods, 312 in 2005, and 144 in 2007\u20132009 periods. compared with our data, higher incidence rates were reported from neighboring countries such as Singapore26 (177 per 100 000) but lower rates were reported from United States25 (798 per 100 000), Australia28 (61 per 100 000), Japan14 (40 per 100 000), and Malaysia29 (24 per 100 000). influenza surveillance and detection system may be different between during and after the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in some countries. each country adopted various management programs to control the outbreak during the pandemic, including school closure, antiviral treatment, and behavior change due to pandemic awareness. the overall influenza A incidence rate did not increase (452 versus 387 per 100 000) in the post-pandemic season, the incidence of A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalization increased two times from 26 to 53 per 100 000 during the post-pandemic period. in argentina, no pediatric hospitalization due to A(H1N1)pdm09 was identified in the post-pandemic season. in 2009, there were several reports regarding the disease severity of A(H1N1)pdm09 especially from Mexico32, Argentina6 and the united states. the cases were older children, came to the hospital earlier after the onset (median 16 days), had lower rate of RCP (11% versus 27%) and milder symptoms compared with seasonal influenza A cases. if illness is severe, they will be referred to KHGH. a polymorphism at IFITM3 allele (SNP rs 12252-C) has been shown to cause a reduced influenza virus restriction. a large portion of samples from 2007 and 2008 (n = 91) was not available for genotyping due to lack of samples. the funding agencies had no role in designing, conducting, analyzing the data, and preparation of the manuscript. authors have no conflict of interest with regard to the content of this manuscript."}
