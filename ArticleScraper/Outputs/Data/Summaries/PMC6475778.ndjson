{"summary": "acute respiratory viral infections, such as influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cause severe morbidity and mortality. pandemic IAVs often emerge and can cause catastrophic illness and widespread death. AM plays important roles in lung homeostasis and pulmonary antimicrobial defense (16, 17) compared to other tissue macrophages, monocytes, and monocyte-derived cells, AM have distinct functions and phenotypes. PPAR-, mTORC1, the phosphoinositide kinase PIKfyve, and L-plastin, were also recently shown to be important in AM development and function. PPAR- was downregulated in AM via IFNs following IAV infection. PPAR- repressed macrophage proinflammatory responses and promoted the expression of wound healing gene programs independent of M2 polarization. a number of TFs involved in antiviral innate immunity were upregulated. several TFs, including Pparg, were downregulated in AM following IAV infection. western blot analysis confirmed decreased PPAR- protein levels. IFN- treatment suppressed PPAR- expression in AM. we infected AM with IAV and then blocked type I IFN signaling. together, these data suggest that IAV infection inhibited PPAR- expression in AM through IFN signaling. blot analysis of PPAR- levels in AM (isolated and pooled from at least 3 mice) with or without IAV infection overnight. bar graph represents relative density of PPAR- band pooled from three independent experiments. Lyz2-cre-driven PPAR- deficiency in AM resulted in relatively normal AM development (Fig. 2A) in fetal monocytes. compared to the severe defects of AM development and maturation (evidenced by a dramatic increase of CD11b [19]) in PpargCD11c mice, PpargLyz2 mice had comparable percentages of AM and only slightly increased CD11b expression compared to those of control mice. PPAR--deficient AM exhibited enhanced type I IFN and inflammatory gene expression but showed similar levels of Retnla and Arg1 expression compared to those of control AM at 3 dpi. PPAR- suppresses antiviral inflammation but does not regulate M2 genes following IAV infection. ifnb1, Tnf, Ccl2, Retnla, and Arg1 gene expression levels in AM were determined at days 1 and 3 postinfection. myeloid PPAR- suppresses host antiviral responses and disease development following IAV infection. compared to control mice, PpargLyz2 mice had increased host mortality and morbidity and delayed weight recovery following IAV infection. myeloid PPAR- suppresses host mortality, morbidity, and pulmonary inflammation. control or PpargLyz2 mice were infected with IAV. PPAR- suppresses host mortality, morbidity, and pulmonary inflammation. gLyz2 mice showed a trend of increased CCL2 protein levels in the BAL fluid at 7, 10, or 15 dpi. lungs showed altered expression of inflammation-related genes at day 10 postinfection. PPAR- deficiency leads to enhanced early viral replication, an exuberant inflammatory reaction, and increased severity of host sickness. yz2 mice with RSV examined host morbidity and lung inflammatory responses. myeloid PPAR- deficiency increased weight loss following RSV infection. we also found that PpargLyz2 mice had increased inflammatory innate immune cells present in the lungs at 4 dpi. we crossed a Lyz2-cre mouse with a cre reporter strain to examine Cre deletion in the myeloid compartment. we observed Lyz2-cre activity in the majority of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. PPAR- in AM and monocytes/monocyte-derived macrophages in controlling host disease development during IAV infection. we crossed PpargLyz2 mice to Ccr2/ mice to block monocyte traffic to the infected lungs. compared to Ccr2//Ppargfl/fl mice, Ccr2//PpargLyz2 mice lost more weight. Western blot analysis of PPAR- protein expression in sorted AM, CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils in the lungs of naive WT mice (pooled from 3 mice per group). PPAR--deficient AM are thought to be involved in the tissue repair process following lung injury (32). PPAR- deficiency resulted in impaired expression of large numbers of wound-healing-related genes, including epithelial and endothelial growth factors. levels of a number of factors involved in tissue remodeling, including Mmp7, Mmp9, and Timp1, were also decreased in PPAR--deficient AM. BAL fluid total protein concentrations determined at 1, 3, 7, 10, or 15 dpi. data are representative of results from at least two independent experiments. to this end, we examined whether PpargLyz2 mice had impaired tissue recovery in vivo following viral clearance. lungs of control and PpargLyz2 mice exhibited lower Sftpb and Abca3 expression levels than those of control. PPAR- promoted AM tissue repair function and impaired tissue recovery following IAV infection. Western blot analysis confirmed decreased PPAR- protein levels in AM. we sorted AM (CD11c+/Siglec F+) from the lungs of uninfected mice. we examined Pparg expression by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) following IFN- treatment, IAV downregulates PPAR- expression in AM. comparison of expression levels of 84 transcription factors in AM (isolated and pooled from at least 3 mice) with or without IAV infection overnight in vitro determined by qRT-PCR. expression in AM (isolated and pooled from at least 3 mice) with or without IFN- treatment in the presence or absence of anti-IFNAR1 overnight in vitro determined by qRT-PCR. PPAR- suppresses antiviral inflammation but does not regulate M2 genes following infection. in adult AM compartments, and AM from adult PpargLyz2 mice exhibited impaired PPAR- expression (30). we then isolated AM from uninfected control or PpargLyz2 mice and infected the AM with IAV in vitro. following infection, WT and PpargLyz2 AM showed relatively comparable levels of viability. airway AM percentages and CD11b expression on AM from control (Ppargfl/fl), PpargCD11c, and PpargLyz2 mice. Western blot analysis of PPAR- expression in sorted AM (isolated and pooled from 2 to 3 mice) from control (Ppargfl/fl) or PpargLyz2 mice. we examined the kinetics of IAV replication in the respiratory tract using a PFU assay. we found that PpargLyz2 mice showed significantly increased virus titers in the early days following IAV infection (4 dpi) compared to control mice. however, most of the mice cleared their infectious virus at around 10 dpi. expression levels of 84 inflammation-related genes in lungs from control or PpargLyz2 mice at day 10 postinfection. data are representative of results from at least two independent experiments (n = 3 to 6 mice per group) except for panels A to C. myeloid PPAR- deficiency leads to enhanced early viral replication, an exuberant inflammatory reaction, and increased severity of host sickness. we infected control or PpargLyz2 mice with RSV, a virus that affects millions of children. macrophage PPAR- suppresses pulmonary inflammation during RSV infection. qRT-PCR analysis of Ifna4, Ifnb1, Il1b, Tnf, Ccl2, Retnla, and Arg1 expression in AM (isolated and pooled from at least 3 mice) from control (Ppargfl/fl) or PpargLyz2 mice were infected with RSV. AM expressed high levels of PPAR-, and the lung CD11b+ monocyte/macrophage population expressed comparatively low levels of PPAR-. neutrophils did not express detectable PPAR-, which is consistent with data from a previous report. we sorted AM, CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages and CD45 cells. MC21 treatment greatly decreased monocyte infiltration into the lung. however, MC21 treatment did not significantly alter host weight loss in either control or PpargLyz2 mice. this suggests that monocytes are dispensable for phenotypes observed in PpargLyz2 mice following IAV infection. control mice were infected with IAV and treated with control IgG or MC21 mAb. PPAR- deficient AM resulted in impaired expression of large numbers of wound-healing-related genes. levels of a number of factors involved in tissue remodeling decreased in PPAR--deficient AM. genes of AM isolated (pooled from 3 mice) from uninfected control or PpargLyz2 mice. red dots, genes upregulated in PPAR--deficient AM; green dots, genes downregulated in PPAR--deficient AM. PpargLyz2 mice still had significantly higher proportions of inflamed and/or damaged areas that were not properly repaired at day 15 postinfection. we first examined airway inflammatory cell content (monocytes and neutrophils) at 15 dpi, suggesting that PpargLyz2 mice had impaired pulmonary inflammation resolution. PPAR- is an anti-inflammatory transcription factor able to antagonize NF-B-mediated cytokine production constitutively and in response to toll-like receptor ligand stimulation (45). PPAR-deficient AM produced increased levels of both antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines in response to IAV and RSV infections. inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived cells have been associated with the development of immunopathology. these cells also contribute to normal antiviral responses. blockage of migration to the lung due to CCR2 inhibition or deficiency impaired host viral clearance during RSV and IAV infections. PPAR- deficiency did not result in decreased M2 gene expression in AM with or without IAV or RSV infection. PPAR- is vital for proper function of AM during respiratory viral infection by restricting their inflammatory features and simultaneously promoting their repair roles. dysregulated inflammatory cytokine production in PPAR-deficient AM contribute to the severe outcome of IAV infection in myeloid PPAR-deficient mice. PPAR- regulates inflammatory responses of AM, the development of acute host disease, and proper restoration of tissue homeostasis following respiratory viral infections. ice and inoculated into anesthetized mice through the intranasal route. 105 AM were plated in a 12-well plate and treated with 50 ng/ml IFN- (BioLegend) or the vehicle overnight. mRNA from cultured AM (pooled from multiple mice), in vivo-sorted AM (pooled from multiple mice) or homogenates from individual lungs was isolated with a total RNA purification kit. random primers (Invitrogen) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) were used to synthesize first-strand cDNAs from equivalent amounts of RNA from each sample. first-strand cDNA was mixed with 2 Fast SYBR green master mix (Applied Bioscience) and water in a formula as directed in the manual. twenty-five microliters of the mixture was added to each well of a 96-well plate provided by the manufacturer. the raw data were analyzed with software provided by Qiagen. samples were shipped to the Mayo Clinic Histology Core Lab. they were embedded in paraffin, and 5-m sections were cut for hematoxylin and eosin staining. computer-based image analysis was performed using ImageJ software. membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary Ab. peroxidase activity was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence. chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. precleared extracts were then incubated with 60 l of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz) for ChIP with 5 g of the appropriate antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. beads were washed once with low-salt immune complex wash buffer. real-time PCR data are represented as fold changes over the control.
