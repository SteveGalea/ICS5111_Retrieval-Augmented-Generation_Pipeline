{"summary": "in the past decade, ZIKV has emerged into new areas, including a large outbreak in Micronesia in 2007, where 73% of the population was infected within a 4-month period (3). the outbreak in the south Pacific is thought to be the source of virus introduced to Brazil, supported by the close genetic relationship of South Pacific and epidemic Latin American strains (5). cDNA-based infectious clones (ICs) have been generated for other flaviviruses, including west Nile virus, yellow fever virus, deNV, and ZIKV (11\u201317), but flavivirus reverse genetics systems can be more challenging than those for many other viruses. recent efforts to generate ZIKV recombinant viruses have resulted in different cloning strategies, all of different ZIKV strains. the resulting ZIKV recombinant viruses grow to similar peak titers as their parental isolate viruses. recombinant viruses were virulent in Ifnar1/ Ifngr1/ C57BL/6J mice. there was a large difference in murine pathogenesis between the two strains. the genome of the virus is divided into 4 fragments using the diagrammed restriction endonucleases and cloned into high-copy-number vectors. a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme is placed after the final genomic nucleotide for RNA stability. MR766 +gly IC had significantly higher early growth than the other 3 strains. western blot of E protein from MR766 isolate and 3 infectious clones performed using the pan-flavivirus MAb 4G2. this represents a diversity of only 0.23% between the 3\u2032 UTRs of H/PF/2013 and PRVABC59. the H/PF/2013 and MR766 3\u2032 UTRs differ by 17 nucleotides (3.90%) these results indicate a high degree of conservation of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR genomic regions. development of a ZIKV reverse genetics system using unidirectional assembly of a quadripartite genome. we previously developed reverse genetics platforms that are comprised of multipartite genomes with unidirectional assembly to generate stable infectious clones for coronaviruses (24, 25) and DENV (20\u201322) mr766 infectious clone included engineered ablation of duplicate restriction sites. we also digested cDNA from the clone and isolate viruses. mr766 substrain sequences differ and encode an intact N-linked glycosylation site at N154 of E. individual foci on vero cells 44 to 46 h postinfection were measured using a CTL Immunospot analyzer. at least 65 foci were measured per virus. MR766 +Gly formed significantly larger foci than MR766 isolate, MR766 +Del, or MR766 Gly. natural isolate and clone virus have similar growth kinetics at 32\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. peak infectious titers for the P1 stock of H/PF/2013 infectious clone (IC) were lower than those for the natural isolate at both temperatures. the first Brazilian ZIKV sequence published online was strain SPH2015. it predates more commonly used Brazilian ZIKV strains such as the PRVABC59 isolate. we grafted the final 129 nucleotides from H/PF/2013 onto the SPH2015 sequence to produce a complete ZIKV genome. a series of seven nucleotides were found within the first 20 nt of the SPH2015 genome that did not match other ZIKV strains. this modification allowed us to recover viable SPH2015 clone virus (Fig. 3C), suggesting the published sequence contains lethal errors. our infectious clones represent one isolate from each clade. the French polynesian strain acts as the closest relative to the Brazilian clades. phylogenetic tree of Brazilian ZIKV sequences was acquired from GenBank. using maximum likelihood (RAxML software) with 100 bootstrap replicates, only bootstrap support values of >50 are displayed at each node. the topology of each clade and support values are sensitive to the specific sequences used. the beH819015 recombinant was viable and made infectious foci of similar size as the SPH2015 IC. the recombinant was viable and made infectious foci of similar size as the SPH2015 IC, but both are smaller than H/PF/2013 and PR2015 (Fig. 3C; Fig. S2). anti-fusion loop MAb 4G2 stained only DENV4-infected cells. anti-prM DENV MAb 2H2 stained only DENV4-infected cells. defining cross-reactive and virus-specific epitopes between ZIKV and DENV is a critical component of developing ZIKV diagnostics. active MAbs 1C19 and 1M7 bound all DENV and ZIKV strains tested. 1B22, a prM-specific MAb, bound only the 4 DENV serotypes. DT000 is serum isolated from a traveler with repeat flavivirus vaccinations and infections. PF/2013 clone-infected mice exhibited more gradual weight loss than those infected with the isolate virus (P 0.0001) additional mice were infected with either of the Brazilian clones (SPH2015 IC or BeH819015 IC) with a higher dose of 103 FFU due to unpublished data suggesting that these infectious clones are attenuated in comparison to the H/PF/2013 viruses. n = 9), infectious clone virus (n = 9), or PBS (n = 7) were inoculated into IFNGR-knockout mice by footpad injection with 102 FFU (A and B) in parallel, Ifnar1/ and Ifngr1/ mice were inoculated by footpad injection with 103 FFU of BeH819015 (n = 6) or SPH2015 (n = 6). the genome of the virus is divided into 4 fragments using the diagrammed restriction endonucleases and cloned into high-copy-number vectors. the genome of the virus is divided into 4 fragments using the diagrammed restriction endonucleases and cloned into high-copy-number vectors. MR766 +gly IC had significantly higher early growth than the other 3 strains by 2-way analysis of variance with Tukey\u2019s test. Western blot of E protein from MR766 isolate and 3 infectious clones performed using the pan-flavivirus MAb 4G2. this represents a diversity of only 0.23% between the 3\u2032 UTRs of H/PF/2013 and PRVABC59. the H/PF/2013 and MR766 3\u2032 UTRs differ by 17 nucleotides (3.90%) these results indicate a high degree of conservation of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR genomic regions. reverse genetics platforms are comprised of multipartite genomes with unidirectional assembly to generate stable infectious clones for coronaviruses (24, 25) and DENV (20\u201322) the partition sites were chosen to mimic those used to construct DENV infectious clones by this method (20) mr766 infectious clone included engineered ablation of duplicate restriction sites. we also digested cDNA from the clone and isolate viruses. mr766 substrain sequences differ and encode an intact N-linked glycosylation site at N154 of E. individual foci on vero cells 44 to 46 h postinfection were measured using a CTL Immunospot analyzer. at least 65 foci were measured per virus. MR766 +Gly formed significantly larger foci than MR766 isolate, MR766 +Del, or MR766 Gly by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparison test. peak infectious titers for the P1 stock of H/PF/2013 infectious clone were lower than those for the natural isolate at both temperatures. the likely differences in isolate and recombinant virus yields may reflect a loss in cooperativity due to the reduced quasispecies populations present in the molecularly cloned stocks. the first Brazilian ZIKV sequence published online was strain SPH2015. it predates more commonly used Brazilian ZIKV strains such as the PRVABC59 isolate. we grafted the final 129 nucleotides of the 3\u2032 UTR sequence onto the SPH2015 sequence to produce a complete ZIKV genome. a series of seven nucleotides were identified within the first 20 nt of the SPH2015 genome that did not match other ZIKV strains. this modification allowed us to recover viable SPH2015 clone virus (Fig. 3C) phylogenetic tree of Brazilian ZIKV full-length sequences. ZIKV sequences were acquired from GenBank and this study. the 5\u2032 UTR was removed from each lineage. multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT. two distinct clades of Brazilian ZIKV sequences are highly supported in all three versions. the topology of each clade and support values are sensitive to the specific sequences used. clone of ZIKV BeH819015 using site-directed mutagenesis to change the six nucleotide differences in SPH2015 to those of BeH819015. the recombinant was viable and made infectious foci of similar size as the SPH2015 IC, but both are smaller than H/PF/2013 and PR2015 (Fig. 3C; Fig. S2). anti-fusion loop MAb 4G2 stained only DENV4-infected cells. anti-prM DENV MAb 2H2 stained only DENV4-infected cells. defining cross-reactive and virus-specific epitopes between ZIKV and DENV is a critical component of developing ZIKV diagnostics. 1B22, a prM-specific MAb, bound only the 4 DENV serotypes. DT000 is serum isolated from a traveler with repeat flavivirus vaccinations and infections and is used to control protein loading. all ZIKV-infected mice succumbed to infection (Fig. 6B) but there was a statistical difference by log rank for recombinant viruses. additional mice infected with either of the Brazilian clones (SPH2015 IC or BeH819015 IC) with a higher dose of 103 FFU. Ifnar1/ and Ifngr1/ mice were inoculated by footpad injection. weight loss and mortality were recorded through 25 days postinfection. emergence of ZIKV in the Americas highlights importance of understanding molecular mechanisms regulating flavivirus transmission, spread, and emergence. several groups have reported clones using low-copy-number plasmids, plasmids with introns or multipiece systems (15\u201317, 19) to overcome the bacterial toxicity of the plasmids. a full-length infectious cDNA clone of a 2010 ZIKV strain from Cambodia (FSS13025) was generated using a sequentially assembled multipiece system to generate a single-piece infectious clone (40) previous studies have analyzed ZIKV sequences from the current epidemic (5, 34, 42, 43), and two clades can be seen in some analyses. the presence of two distinct clades could indicate independent introductions of ZIKV into Brazil, an earlier introduction than previously appreciated. types did not bind to cells infected with any ZIKV strains, suggesting prM is not antigenically conserved. identifying antigenically distinct epitopes is important for developing diagnostics that can identify ZIKV infection in devseropositive individuals. retrospective analyses of this outbreak identified previously unappreciated associations with fetal neurodevelopmental abnormalities (48) it is unclear why severe manifestations of ZIKV infection have become evident only in the most recent outbreaks. it is plausible that viral genetic changes could result in new disease phenotypes. vero-81 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM)\u2013F-12 50/50 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5% HI fetal bovine serum and antibiotics/antimycotics (52) for growth curve analyses, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in triplicate. supernatants were collected at 4, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postinfection the RNA was treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Ambion) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after another phenol-chloroform extraction, the RNA was incubated with T4 RNA ligase I (Ambion) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then overnight at 4\u00b0C, to ligate the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. cDNA was made and used to generate an amplicon containing both the 5\u2032 and 3 the resulting purified plasmids were digested, ligated, in vitro transcribed, and electroporated into C6/36 cells. supernatants from electroporated C6/36 cells were harvested after 6 to 7 days and passaged once on C6/36 cells to generate virus stocks. maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were generated using RAxML (56) using 100 bootstrap replicates. mice were infected with 103 FFU of ZIKV H/PF/2013 isolate. mice were monitored daily for signs of morbidity or mortality. Ifnar1/ mice were infected with 105 FFU of ZIKV clones of SPH2015, BeH819015, or H/PF/2013. the MR766 strain of ZIKV was obtained from the world reference center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses. ation/permeabilization with 4% paraformaldehyde-0.01% saponin using primary MAb E60 (38) or 4G2 (51) and secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), followed by TrueBlue substrate (KPL). number and size of foci were analyzed with a CTL Immunospot instrument. Viral genome sequencing and modified 5\u2032-3\u2032 RACE. artite unidirectional molecular clone strategy similar to that previously described for deNV and emerging coronaviruses. we identified naturally occurring class IIG nonpalindromic restriction endonuclease sites within the six ZIKV full-length genomes. a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme was added directly after the last nucleotide of each ZIKV genome to generate an authentic 3\u2032 end. full-length sequences (>10,000 nt) were obtained from GenBank and from sequencing of laboratory clones/isolates. sequence alignments were either manually edited to remove the 5\u2032 UTR, left as downloaded, or manually modified to provide viable 5\u2032 UTR variant variants for Haiti/1225/2014 and SPH2015. six- to 8-week-old male and female Ifnar1/ Ifngr1/ mice were infected with 105 FFU of ZIKV clones of SPH2015, BeH819015, or H/PF/2013. mice were monitored daily for signs of morbidity or mortality and twice daily after losing 20% of their starting weight."}
