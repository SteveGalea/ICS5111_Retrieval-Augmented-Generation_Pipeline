{"summary": "a viral infection has significant effects on the host\u2019s gene expression program. viruses manipulate the host\u2019s gene expression response pattern. to assure survival, viruses manipulate the host\u2019s gene expression response pattern in order to maximize viral replication. double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) Herpesviridae Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) Linear dsDNA genome remains encased in enveloped viral capsid Viral DNA is replicated and transcribed in the cell\u2019s nucleus Life cycle has separate latent and infectious lytic phase Kaposi Sarcoma Herpes Virus (KSHV) Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) Herpes Virus Saimiri ( patitis C Virus (HCV) Enveloped virion mRNA is without a poly(A) tail but can be capped (WNV and DENV) or uncapped (HCV) Replication is cytoplasmic Dengue Virus (DENV) west Nile Virus (WNV) togaviridae Sindbis Virus (SINV) Non-enveloped virion with linear RNA genome mRNA is capped but not polyadenylated down-regulation of host gene expression can take place co-transcriptionally in the nucleus or post-transcriptionally in the nucleus or cytoplasm. some viruses have developed ways to block multiple steps leading to the formation of a mature mRNA. some viruses have developed ways to block multiple steps leading to the formation of a mature mRNA. poliovirus encodes the 3C protease that inactivates the first basal transcription factor that initiates mRNA transcription from RNAPII driven promoters. the vesicular somatic virus (VSV) encoded noncatalytic matrix protein also inhibits TFIID [7] influenza virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can shut down host mRNAs by several mechanisms. first, it binds to the 30 kDa subunit of the cleavage polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) NS1 also inhibits poly(A) binding protein (PABP) causing disruption of polyadenylation, which inhibits mRNA export to the cytoplasm. mRNAs are protected by the virtue of possessing 5\u2032-caps and 3\u2032-poly(A) tails that protect the mRNA from exonucleases that remove nucleotides from the 5\u2032-end. other viruses including bunyaviruses and orthomyxoviruses use cap-snatching mechanisms to remove the 5\u2032-cap of the mRNA. the 5\u2032-cap is recognized by the influenza virus PB2 subunit of the viral RNA polymerase in the nucleus of the host cell. the endonucleolytic function is carried out by the polymerase subunit PA (polymerase acidic protein) in bunyaviruses and arenaviruses, cap-snatching happens in the cytoplasm. the prototypical poxvirus, Vaccinia virus (VACV) expresses two decapping eukaryotic viruses, including both DNA and RNA viruses, trigger mRNA degradation either by a virally encoded endonuclease. in some cases they make use of a host endonuclease to cleave the cellular mRNA. in this section of the review we discuss several examples of viral factors that show a high level of similarity in their mechanism of cleavage and degradation. viral gene expression is upregulated with a concomitant down-regulation of cellular mRNAs through host shut-off mechanisms. SOX and BGLF5 are both alkaline exonucleases that induce DNA exonucleolytic cleavage. they also induce host mRNA degradation initiated by endonucleolytic cleavage. the -coronaviruses, SARS CoV and MERS CoV, initiate host shut-off using nonstructural protein NSP1 [27,28,29,30,31] host shut-off appears to be initiated in the nucleus while upon SCoV infection host shut-off is confined to the cytoplasm. poliovirus Picornaviridae Protease 3C mediated cleavage of TFIID VSV Rhabdoviridae Protein M mediated inhibition of TFIIH Influenza Orthomyxoviridae NS1 blocks RNA processing by CPSF, PAB, U6 RNA Post-transcription suppression of mRNA RVFV Bunyaviridae Nucleocapsid protein mediated 5\u2032-cap removal Influenza Orthomyxovirida RVFV encoded NSs also induces relocalization of poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABP1) to the nucleus where it forms nuclear speckles. relocalization of PABP1 to the nucleus is known to be responsible for inhibition of protein translation. the virus ensures that PABPC is captured and sequestered in the nucleus. BGLF5 alone can relocate PABPC into the nucleus. ZEBRA is also able to direct the intracellular relocalization of PABPC. cleotide long ARE in its 3\u2032-UTR renders it resistant to SOX-mediated cleavage. il6 mRNA is also resistant to HSV-1 VHS, suggesting that the host uses common escape mechanisms against host shut-off by different viruses. viruses employ one or multiple ways to down-regulate host gene expression at the level of mRNA while promoting stability of the viral RNA. poliovirus encodes the 3C protease that inactivates the first basal transcription factor that initiates mRNA transcription from RNAPII driven promoters, transcription factor II D (TFIID) virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can shut down host mRNAs by several mechanisms. first, it binds to the 30 kDa subunit of the cleavage polyadenylation specificity factor. both transcription termination and RNA processing are disrupted by this interaction. influenza virus protein NS1 blocks pre-mRNA cleavage by inhibiting polyadenylation factor CPSF and poly(A) binding protein PABP. NS1 also blocks pre-mRNA splicing by interfering with the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. mRNAs are protected by the virtue of possessing 5\u2032-caps and 3\u2032-poly(A) tails. dRP L cleaves the RNA and uses the capped RNA fragment as a primer. the 5\u2032-cap is recognized by the influenza virus PB2 subunit of the viral RNA polymerase in the nucleus of the host cell. the endonucleolytic function is carried out by the polymerase subunit PA (polymerase acidic protein) translational inhibition can be indirectly achieved by dampening transcription and RNA processing. many eukaryotic viruses trigger mRNA degradation either by a virally encoded endonuclease or by a host endonuclease to cleave the cellular mRNA. in the latent phase of infection by KSHV and EBV, the majority of viral gene expression is restricted. a concomitant down-regulation of cellular mRNAs is initiated during the early lytic phase. SOX and BGLF5 are both alkaline exonucleases that induce DNA exonucleolytic cleavage. a similar host shut-off pathway has been discovered for coronaviruses. the -coronaviruses, SARS CoV and MERS CoV, initiate host shut-off using nonstructural protein NSP1. -coronaviruses that carry out host shut off by cleavage and degradation of mRNAs dampen host gene expression without RNA cleavage. SOX and NSP1 stall translation after the 40S ribosome complex has bound mRNA, blocking formation of the 80S complex. Table 2 summarizes several mRNA suppression strategies discussed here. pol II polyadenylated RNAs are degraded through nucleolytic cleavage. relocalization of PABP1 to the nucleus ensures instability of host mRNAs. relocalization of PABP1 to the nucleus is known to be responsible for inhibition of protein translation. KSHV encodes polyadenylated and nuclear (PAN) RNA that is both intronless and noncoding but is capped and polyadenylated. the virus ensures that PABPC is captured and sequestered in the nucleus. BGLF5 alone can relocate PABPC into the nucleus. KSHV-encoded protein SOX targets the 5\u2032-UTR of most cellular mRNAs. one report suggests a concentration dependent down-regulation of mRNAs. il6 mRNA is also resistant to HSV-1 VHS, suggesting that the host uses common escape mechanisms against host shut-off by different viruses. mRNA is capped and polyadenylated, however, in an in vitro, assay it fails to get cleaved and degraded unlike cellular mRNAs. virus employ one or multiple ways to down-regulate host gene expression at the level of mRNA while promoting stability of the viral RNA. RNAi pathways are a conserved eukaryotic mechanism. microRNAs (miRNAs) and short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are major pathways for small RNA biogenesis and function. miRNAs are typically derived from long Pol II transcripts. they undergo two cleavage steps to become 22 nt dsRNAs. siRNAs are perfectly complementary to target mRNAs. this complementarity activates the endonuclease or \u201cslicer\u201d activity of Ago so that the target is cleaved and quickly degraded. RNAi pathway represents primary innate immunity anti-viral response. small RNA biogenesis machinery or precursor dsRNAs can prevent initial expression of small non-coding RNAs in the RNAi pathways. in mammals these viral dsRNA products are recognized by several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as RIG-I, MDA5, and TLR3. in vertebrates, intracellular dsRNA can directly activate the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synth siRNAs of viral origin have been undetectable in most studies of infected mammalian somatic cells. differentiation of the cells dramatically decreases their ability to produce virally derived siRNAs. this is particularly interesting as the IFN response is not active in oocytes and embryonic stem cells (ES cells) VACV infection of mammalian cells has been shown to result in the polyadenylation and subsequent degradation of host miRNAs. the larger subunit of the virally encoded heterodimeric poly(A) polymerase, VP55, was shown to be necessary and sufficient for this small RNA tailing and degradation either upon VACV infection or upon infection by a recombinant VSV virus that encodes VP55 [86,87] mammalian cells infected with mutant viruses show reduced virulence and pathogenicity. the accumulation of a structured RNA that would be expected to activate the immune system actually results in sustained anti-viral IFN signaling in mammalian cells. the only genetic rescue of VSR-deficient viruses in RNAi-deficient mammalian host cells was achieved for noV replication in ESCs. this represents convincing evidence for a VSR function of the noV B2 protein and an anti-viral role for RNAi in ESCs. many vertebrate viruses have co-opted the RNAi machinery for pro-viral functions. sponging of host miR-122 and let-7 created environment favoring oncogenic potential. suppression of small RNA biogenesis would also be disadvantageous to viruses that encode their own miRNAs within their genome. many of these virally-encoded miRNAs have been shown to play a critical role in the viral life cycle. five out of seven miR-17 family of miRNAs, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-93 and miR-106b, are degraded upon human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infection. in each case, miRNAs are degraded in response to being bound by specific virally-expressed RNAs that bear no evolutionary relationship to one another. hCMV m169 binds to and induces the degradation of miR-27. HSUR-1 also binds to and induces the degradation of miR-27. the intergenic noncoding region in UL144-145 RNA binds and induces the degradation of miR-17. miR-27 shows increased tailing and trimming in response to mCMV infection. despite observations of miRNA-induced degradation by viral RNAs, little is understood about how miRNAs get turned over in general. all RNA viruses, except retroviruses, create long dsRNAs during their life cycle. these dsRNAs can yield siRNAs with perfect complementarity to the RNA genome of RNA viruses or viral transcripts of either RNA or DNA viruses, thereby destabilizing the genome or shutting down expression of viral transcripts. in mammals these viral dsRNA products are recognized by several pattern recognition receptors. these receptors activate the interferon (IFN) response, which is a hallmark of vertebrates. intracellular dsRNA can also directly activate the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) carditis virus (EMCV) infects embryonic stem cells. it produces readily detectable levels of virally derived siRNAs. differentiation of the cells dramatically decreases their ability to produce virally derived siRNAs. this is particularly interesting as the IFN response is not active in oocytes and embryonic stem cells (ES cells) a recombinant VSV virus encodes VP55 [86,87]. recombinant VP55 viral titers are actually attenuated instead of enhanced. the decrease in miRNAs leads to an enhancement of the interferon response. sfRNA generation shows reduced virulence and pathogenicity. sfRNAs suppress siRNAs and miRNAs in both human and insect cells. some other proposed VSRs in mammalian viruses are the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein [93], Influenza virus NS1 protein, VACV E3L [94], nodamura virus B2 and primate foamy virus Tas [96]. many vertebrate viruses have co-opted the RNAi machinery for pro-viral functions. viral infection often alters host-cell miRNA expression to its advantage. in some cases, miRNAs might even be homologs of the cellular miRNAs. viruses that encode their own miRNAs are the herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and polyomaviruses. many of these virally-encoded miRNAs have been shown to play a critical role in the viral life cycle. a complete shutdown of small RNAs in these viruses would therefore not be advantageous. 93 and miR-106b, are degraded upon human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infection. in each case, miRNAs are degraded in response to being bound by specific virally-expressed RNAs that bear no evolutionary relationship to one another. in mCMV, miR-27 is bound by a small non-coding RNA, HSUR-1, which resembles snRNAs of eukaryotic cells. HSUR-1 also binds to and induces the degradation of miR-27. the intergenic noncoding region in UL144-145 RNA of human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) binds and induces the degradation of miR-17. HSUR-1 is itself degraded by an ARE-dependent pathway. some viruses use miRNAs to stabilize and replicate their genomes. some use miRNAs to stabilize and replicate their genomes. others have developed clever strategies to down-regulate particular cellular miRNAs. in this review, we have discussed how viruses antagonize host mRNAs. despite the compact genomes of most viruses several also genomically encode their own non-coding RNAs."}
