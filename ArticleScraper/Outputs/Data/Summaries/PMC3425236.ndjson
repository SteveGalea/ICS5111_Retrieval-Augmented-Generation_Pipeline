{"summary": "three locations were selected, at the scale of province, municipality and barangay (i.e. village) data on disease incidence, programme activities, and programme management were collected on-site through meetings and focus group discussions. to be effective, vector control should be targeted where and when people are most at risk. well-adapted and well-targeted vector control strategies will ensure the efficient use of resources and contribute to the effective reduction of the disease burden. malaria, dengue, lymphatic filariasis and Japanese encephalitis are all transmitted by mosquitoes. case studies are a powerful advocacy tool because they can demonstrate benefits through real-world examples. study was initiated on the assumption that lessons could be learned about operational efficiency and sustainability. results were evaluated in relation to five key elements laid-out in framework on IVM. usan del Norte province in northern Mindanao was selected as a known example of a barangay with active involvement of local leaders and communities in vector control. the micro-stratification, conducted in 2010, categorized individual barangays as having'stable transmission', 'unstable transmission','sporadic transmission' or being'malaria prone' malaria epidemiology Item Category 'Stable transmission' 'Unstable transmission' 'Malaria prone' Categorization criteria String of 6 or more months with continu-ous transmission in the period 2007-09 String of 2-5 months with continuous transmission in the period 2007-09 At least one indigenous case in the period 2005-09 No indigenous case in the period 2005-09 Number of barangays: Cagayan Province 15 77 164 565 Isabela Province 6 26 58 745 barangays with'stable transmission' were given greater emphasis on vector control. barangays with sporadic malaria were given emphasis on disease surveillance to detect any remaining cases or re-introductions. trend is strong indication that the strategy with its package of interventions has been effective. despite the demonstrated benefits, there is potential to improve the programme. if ecological and sociological elements are incorporated into the micro-stratification, this could increase the programme's effectiveness in a decentralized health system. malaria cases in Antagan were mostly male (92%), from 11 to 30 years (77%), occupational loggers (53%) or farmers (32%), and that 65% of all cases occurred during the months of June and July, coinciding with the planting season of rain-fed crops in the hills. malaria cases did not decline even with high coverage of LLINs and IRS. case from Cagayan Valley demonstrates a model for planning and adapting malaria control strategies to the epidemiological situation in each barangay. entomological surveillance to confirm the absence of malaria vectors within the barangay proper will help improve the efficient allocation and use of resources. in 2006, a training programme was conducted for 23 barangay health workers on communication and social mobilization for dengue prevention and control. the health workers conducted monthly activities of health promotion and dengue vector surveillance in four barangays selected as dengue hotspots. the number of water-holding bodies and those with presence of larvae of Aedes spp. were recorded in 100 sampled households per barangay. in barangays that were dengue hotspots, the existing 'barangay health emergency response' teams were trained to adopt dengue prevention as part of their job description. these teams, present in every barangay since they were enacted nationwide in 2003 to stop the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), began to organize weekly clean-up drives and conduct vector larval surveillance. gue vectors were implemented in hotspot barangays. barangay chiefs and councillors were among those trained on dengue prevention. the number of confirmed malaria cases was determined at 490 (i.e. incidence rate of 129 per 1,000 population) in 2005, full coverage of the population with insecticidal nets has been achieved. a barangay action committee on malaria was established to plan and coordinate malaria control. under the auspices of this committee, an anti-malaria brigade of volunteers was formed in every sitio. they assisted in health promotion, LLIN surveys, mass blood surveys, rearing and releasing of larvivorous fish for vector control and, in some instances, intradomiciliary spraying. microscopist and barangay health worker played role in co-ordinating malaria control activities in Simbalan. she supervised the RDT sites, mobilized mass blood surveys where recent cases have been found. she organized surveys on the needs, quality and utilization of bed nets. the micro-stratification, conducted in 2010, categorized individual barangays as having'stable transmission', 'unstable transmission','sporadic transmission' or being'malaria prone' the majority of cases were infected with Plasmodium falciparum. the purpose of the micro-stratification was to aid programme managers in their planning, choice of interventions and efficient use of resources for case detection and vector control. malaria distribution was highly focal, with'stable transmission' occurring in less than 1% of the barangays. barangays with sporadic malaria were given emphasis on disease surveillance to detect any remaining cases or re-introductions. 4,566 11,954 5,726 2007 869 51,774 22,230 4,673 1,162 57,227 20,800 11,425 2008 239 65,244 0 7,034 772 47,433 2,680 13,541 2009

decline in Mabuno barangay, despite full coverage with vector control interventions. 65% of cases occurred during the months of June and July. malaria cases did not decline even with high coverage of LLINs and IRS. most cases were indigenous people living in make-shift houses in the foothills. transmission has continued among indigenous people living unprotected from infectious bites outside of the barangay proper. malaria prevalence was not yet fully operational in 2005. no more cases of indigenous transmission were reported after 2008. prevalence of dengue, transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, has been on the increase. a rapid deployment team was recruited to strengthen case detection and outbreak response in the barangays. the task force and its rapid deployment team had been funded by a local mining company as a form of public-private collaboration. they were available as in-kind support for malaria control. weekly rounds were repeated for up to 10 times. entomological monitoring provided feedback for decision-making. active case surveillance and campaigns to treat curtains with pyrethroids against dengue vectors were implemented. cases of dengue fever dropped from 185 in 2010 to 108 in 2011. the next years will show whether the strategy leads to a further reduction in disease cases and whether the political commitment can be sustained. cases of dengue fever dropped from 185 in 2010 to 108 in 2011. from 2005, five types of local initiatives on malaria control emerged. a barangay action committee on malaria, with participation from local officials, health workers, teachers, and several community-based groups, was established. from 2005, five types of local initiatives on malaria control emerged. local initiatives benefiting malaria control Local
