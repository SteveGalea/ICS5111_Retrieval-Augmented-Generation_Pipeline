{"summary": "new technology allows us to reconstitute the genomes of many organisms on at least a small scale and, in some cases, a large scale. applications seem almost limitless, spanning engineered vaccines, foodstuffs with improved nutrition, biofuels, industrial enzymes, nanoscale electronics, living sensors, and transforming insects to incapacitate their ability to transmit diseases. this article considers the evolution of engineered genomes for use as live, attenuated viral vaccines. the oral polio vaccine (OPV) consists of three viral strains, each attenuated for low virulence. the risk of disease from the vaccine is maybe 1 in 750,000 recipients. the vaccine has evolved reversal of the attenuation many times. reversal of attenuated vaccine strain is an evolutionary process. reversion to virulence must be so slow that descendants disappear before evolution enables it to initiate an epidemic. reversal of attenuated vaccine strain is an evolutionary process. the evolutionary issues of a vaccine strain are conveniently explained in terms of the basic reproductive of the infection, R0. attenuated strains are designed either to be confined to the vaccinated individual, thus failing to transmit entirely. each vaccinated host establishes fewer than one new infection on average ( 0 R 0 1 ). adaptive evolutionary process expected to increase with population size and with increasing time to extinction. Vaccines whose intrinsic R0 (before evolution) are 0.4 or less are expected to die out quickly. if the chain is long enough, there may have been enough evolution. the net probability of evolving a virus that exceeds the epidemic threshold combines the probability of each chain length with the probability that viruses in that patient have R 0 > 1 and escape to the next patient. if chain lengths are short, the virus either never evolves R 0 > 1 or is slow to do so. some attenuation designs may so constrain evolution that the virus is unable to evolve R 0 > 1. such designs would allow the vaccine to be used without fear of reversion. poliovirus is unusual in that it is a case in which we can no longer afford reversion to wild-type virulence. the evolution of an attenuated strain does not require an actual genetic reversal of the attenuating mutations. the design of an attenuated strain to avoid strict genetic reversal of the changes does not ensure the absence of an evolutionary reversal of the changes. chimps were not natural hosts for poliovirus, but wild-type virus delivered in this fashion could make them sick. for many other cases, the virus must be tested in humans before attenuation is known. attenuation by this method may yield genetically polymorphic strains. attenuation by silent codon changes is also haphazard, especially considering that even different serotypes of the same virus may not provide cross protection. a virus from another host may be many mutations away from higher virulence. a simple way to fix random mutations is to force the population through a series of extreme bottlenecks. some exchanges make small fitness differences, so they are not strictly fitness neutral. if many exchanges are made in a viral genome, viral reproduction can be slowed down to arbitrary levels. virus encodes the same proteins as the wild type and is antigenically the same as wild type. if each engineered codon change has a small individual effect, achieving a significant magnitude of attenuation will require many such changes and the level of attenuation will be finely adjustable. the method also offers a second predicted advantage for a vaccine: slow reversion. all three protocols proposed for poliovirus achieved attenuation in a satisfying, quantitative fashion. fitness declines approximately linearly with the number of suboptimal codons in phage T7. if attenuation is dependent on those two dinucleotides, it will enable greater predictability in attenuation. this model cannot explain attenuation with bacterial viruses, of course. there are multiple mechanisms contributing to attenuation by silent codon replacement. some of the more rapid reversions were in HIV-1, with complete recovery of fitness in 15 passages (10-fold dilutions each), with complete recovery of fitness in 15 passages (10-fold dilutions each, Martrus et al. 2013). most of the fitness gain was from adaptation to culture conditions, hence slow reversion of the engineered fitness drop. any single reversion mutation should ascend slowly because of its small fitness benefit. the prediction of slow recovery could fail for two reasons. evolution must reverse each of the attenuating mutations to reverse the attenuating fitness effect. silent codon replacements have revealed highly regular, quantitative attenuation in proportion to the number of codon changes. fitness declines approximately linearly with the number of suboptimal codons in phage T7. in some short-term adaptations, there has been no obvious evolutionary fitness reversion. some studies codon-modify viral genomes that have not been pre-adapted to the growth conditions used in the adaptations. both the codon-modified virus and the unmodified virus show considerable fitness gains during the adaptations. evolutionary reversals of codon-deoptimized viruses exhibit slow or moderately slow recovery but faster than predicted if reversion occurred. if CpG and UpA dinucleotides are the primary determinants of attenuation, the ability to predict recovery could improve. at present, experimental work is needed to determine the pace of recovery for each individual implementation. bacteriophage T7 is unusual among DNA phages in that it encodes its own RNAP. a \u2018downstream\u2019 shift in the location of the RNAP gene causes well-understood delays in the life cycle, giving rise to robust predictions of fitness drops. the most integrated analyses of attenuation by rearrangement are with T7. the most extreme displacement of the RNAP gene had a severe fitness impact. the difficulty in prediction raises doubts about the feasibility of prediction. despite the difficulty in prediction, these studies raise the possibility of using genome rearrangements to create and evolve a permanently attenuated virus. despite the difficulty in prediction, these studies raise the possibility of using genome rearrangements to create and evolve a permanently attenuated

approximate upper limit of fitness. a concern with any deletion is a possibly altered immune response due to the absence of antigenic epitopes. any non-essential gene or gene segment will potentially work. the absence of such genes may impair viral growth, but the effect on virulence is for reasons other than growth rate. 8.1 Prediction There are few generalities evident. the fitness-reducing effect from deleting a non-essential element is usually difficult to predict even semi-quantitatively without a detailed model of genome dynamics. however, different deletions together should often lead to greater fitness reduction than the individual deletions. in an HIV-1 with three partial deletions, duplication in a promoter region led to major fitness increases while leaving intact the original deletions. one of the best studied evolutionary recoveries from the perspective of underlying mechanisms is of DNA ligase gene deletions in the related phages T7 and T3. 8.1 Prediction There

however, different deletions together should often lead to greater fitness reduction than the individual deletions. in an HIV-1 with three partial deletions, duplication in a promoter region led to major fitness increases while leaving intact the original deletions. a reduction in genome replication (by disruption of DNA metabolism) allows most any gene to interact with, and thus compensate for the absence of ligase. the limiting step is now our understanding of what attenuates, and for viruses capable of autonomous amplification, how evolution can reverse that attenuation. the emphasis here is on approaches that are potentially general to many viruses and have also been implemented at least experimentally. this approach has been implemented in the flu mist influenza vaccine. the approach avoids the need to attenuate each serotype. it does require a priori knowledge of antigens driving the immune response. a virus with altered tropism could be permanently attenuated. recombination between an attenuated strain and the wild type may be inconsequential. a factor in the evolutionary reversion of some attenuated vaccines is recombination. the evolution of a high-fitness vaccine-recombinant strain has in fact been reported in a poultry virus. the recombinant virus even appears to have higher fitness than the previous wild-type virus. recombination among different strains may be greatly increased in the high viral loads introduced by vaccination."}
