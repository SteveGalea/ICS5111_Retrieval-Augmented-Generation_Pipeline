{"summary": "eukaryotic messenger RNAs have evolved mechanisms to protect their RNA 5\u2032-end with a cap moiety indistinguishable from cellular cap structure. most RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to protect their RNA 5\u2032-end with a cap moiety indistinguishable from cellular cap structure. most RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to protect their RNA 5\u2032-end with a cap moiety indistinguishable from cellular cap structure. this step renders the GTase reaction irreversible. further methylation at the 2\u2032-O position of the ribose of the first nucleotide leads to 7mGpppN2\u2032-Om-RNA (cap-1 structure) several recent studies reveal that viral RNA capping pathways are highly diverse in enzymes, reaction sequences, and mechanisms. in vitro enzymatic synthesis of capped mRNAs remains challenging. it is known that viral enzymes cap defined and specific RNA sequences present at the RNA 5\u2032 end. these sequences are very difficult to synthesize using T3, T7, or SP6 DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. the synthesis of 5\u2032-capped RNAs on solid support was established more than 20 years ago. the instability of N7-methylguanosine under acidic conditions has limited the efforts in this area. two examples of a successful synthesis of the same short 5\u2032-capped oligonucleotide GpppApUpA on solid support have been described in the literature. the linker between the RNA chain and the support was not base-labile. the 130-mer sequence was chemically assembled by using 2-cyanoethoxymethyl as the 2\u2032-OH protecting group. then the 5\u2032 end was pyrophosphorylated to add the cap structure with a capping enzyme. the need of a universal and efficient method to obtain synthetic 5\u2032-capped RNA has been growing. chemical synthesis of small-capped RNAs is a bottleneck for biological and structural studies enzymes involved in the RNA capping pathway. the lack of methods allowing the production of large amounts capped RNAs has probably impeded the crystal structure determination of enzymes in complex with such capped RNAs. the RNA assembly was performed with the pivaloyloxymethyl (PivOM) technology recently introduced by our group for RNA synthesis on solid support. a treatment with Et3N-3HF/N-methylpyrrolidone at 65\u00b0C, used to remove TBDMS groups, resulted in a total hydrolysis of the TP moiety. the capping reaction was performed for 160 sec with phenoxyacetic anhydride instead of the regular acetic anhydride. the terminal adenosine in the SARS sequence AUAUUA was also replaced by a 2\u2032-O-methyl adenosine to give A2\u2032-OmUAUUA. phosphoroimidazolide derivatives react with numerous nucleophiles as pyrophosphate or nucleoside mono-, di-, or triphosphates. phosphoroimidazolide derivatives are known to react with numerous nucleophiles as pyrophosphate or nucleoside mono-, di-, or triphosphates. diesters were hydrolyzed with triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer to the stable 5\u2032-H-phosphonate supported RNAs (Scheme 3) these entities were then oxidized in strict anhydrous conditions with carbon tetrachloride in the presence of imidazole and N,O-bis-trimethylsilylacetamide (BSA) salt and 5\u2032-phosphoroimidazolidate supported RNAs were performed at 30\u00b0C overnight in presence of 400 mM ZnCl2 in dry DMF. solid-supported cap-RNAs were treated first with 1 M DBU solution in dry CH3CN for 3 min to remove cyanoethyl protecting groups from the phosphates. the conversion of RNAs into the desired capped Gppp-RNAs (1\u201311) reached a satisfactory average yield between cellular mRNAs used as a translation template by the ribosomal complex are methylated at their N7 position by cellular N7-MTase. we cloned and purified the human N7-hMTase carrying a six histidine tag into a bacterial expression plasmid. after bacterial expression, the protein was purified by gel filtration. the N7-hMTase stored at 20\u00b0 in 50% glycerol is stable and keeps its MTase activity for >2 yr. TABLE 2. Data for 7mGppp-RNAs (12\u201316) after enzymatic methylation of Gppp-RNAs (2\u20134), (9\u201310) SCHEME 4. (Guanine-N7)-methyltransfer reaction on 5\u2032-Gppp-RNA. 62, 125, 250, and 1000 nM of N7-hMTase was incubated with methyl donor (AdoMet) containing a tritiated methyl group. the reaction products were then separated from free AdoMet by filter binding assays using DEAE filtermats. the percentage of methylated Gppp-RNA (5) was quantitated by measurement of the radioactivity transfer onto the substrate RNA. for this purpose, the synthetic capped RNAs (2\u20134), (9\u201310) were incubated in the presence of 250 nM N7-hMTase and 0.4 mM of the methyl donor (AdoMet) for 5 h at 30\u00b0C. the progress of the methylation reaction was followed by HPLC analysis after 1 the methylation reaction of the cap structure was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. the lower yields of 85% and 86% obtained for RNA (13) and (14), respectively, may be explained by a slight RNA degradation which was considered acceptable for short sequences. hMTase-mediated N7-methylation was equally efficient irrespective of the substitution at the 2\u2032 position of the 5\u2032 end ribonucleotide (2\u2032\u2019-OH or 2\u2032-O-methyl) hMTase-mediated N7-methylation of the cap structure can occur even when the 5\u2032-terminal ribonucleotide is already 2\u2032-O-methylated. RNA assembly was performed using human N7-Mtase with quantitative yield. 7mGpppN-RNAs or 7mGpppN2\u2032-Om-RNAs were obtained as pure materials after a simple purification process. the easier access to capped RNAs are very attractive and promising for structural and mechanistic studies of their complexes. RNA oligomers were prepared on a 1-mol scale from the assembly of 2\u2032-O-PivOM phosphoramidites on CPG solid support through the succinyl linker. amidites used at 0.1-M-concentration in CH3CN and activated by 5-benzylmercaptotetrazole (BMT, 0.3 M) were reacted with 5\u2032-OH supported nucleoside for a 180 sec coupling step. the PivOM method involves the triphosphate motif formation by the reaction of commercially available GDP with an activated phosphate group at the 5\u2032 terminus of the solid-supported and protected RNA. another way would have been to activate GDP with imidazolide (Im) and to react with 5\u2032-phosphorylated supported RNA. the fastest and easiest way to prepare an activated phosphate was through the H-phosphonate intermediate which was readily obtained using commercially available reagents. after RNA assembly, the 5\u2032-OH of the fully protected oligomers were converted to their H-phosphonate monoester with >95% yield by reaction with diphenyl H-phosphonate. the addition of metal chlorides was reported to generate a clear homogenous solution. the triphosphate bond formation between GDP bis (tri-n-butylammonium) salt and 5\u2032-phosphoroimidazolidate supported RNAs was performed at 30\u00b0C overnight in the presence of 400 mM ZnCl2 in dry DMF. RNA sequences (10\u201311) incorporated a 2\u2032-O-methyl ribonucleotide at the 5\u2032 end, the yields reaching 50%. after purification, the capped GpppN-RNAs and GpppN2\u2032-Om-RNAs were isolated, with satisfactory yields (ranging from 33% to 42%) and with high purity (>97%) cellular MTase recognizes chemically prepared compounds. we cloned the N7-hMTase carrying a six histidine tag into a bacterial expression plasmid. after bacterial expression, the protein was purified in two steps. the N7-hMTase recovered after each purification step was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue. Lane 1 corresponds to the molecular weight marker, lanes 2, 3 and 4 to the protein eluted from IMAC, heparin, and S200 column, respectively. the reaction products were separated from free AdoMet by filter binding assays using DEAE filtermats. 62, 125, 250, and 1000 nM of N7-hMTase was incubated with GpppAGUUGU (5) in the presence of methyl donor (AdoMet) the reaction products were separated from free AdoMet by filter binding onto DEAE filtermats. the percentage of methylated Gppp-RNA (5) was quantitated by measurement of the radioactivity transfer onto the substrate RNA. methylated cap-RNA (12) was complete since no trace of the starting material (2) was observed. only the presence of the remaining AdoMet and the formed AdoHcy as by-products was observed at RT 0.99. 7mGppp-RNAs (12\u201316) were separated from the N7-hMTase. anion-exchange HPLC profile of reaction medium at t = 1 h of incubation with hMTase. hMTase-mediated N7-methylation was equally efficient irrespective of the substitution at the 2\u2032 position of the 5\u2032 end ribonucleotide (2\u2032\u2019-OH or 2\u2032-O-methyl) the synthesis of Gppp-RNAs using vaccinia virus guanylyltranferase is rather inefficient. we also set up the enzymatic assay allowing methylation of N7-guanine. this methylation was performed using human N7-Mtase with quantitative yield. RNA sequences were assembled on a 1-mol scale in Twist oligonucleotide synthesis columns (Glen research) using the PivOM amidites (5\u2032-O-DMTr-2\u2032-O-PivOM-[U, CAc, APac or GPac]-3\u2032-O-(O-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropyl-phosphorus) the PivOM amidites are also commercially available at Chemgenes. the 5\u2032-O-DMTr-2\u2032-O-Me-ABz-3\u2032-O-(O-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropyl-phosphoramidite) was purchased from Chemgenes. solution was pushed back and forth for 5 min, then left to react for 5 h at 30\u00b0C. solution was washed twice with anhydrous CH3CN (2 2 mL), followed by a 1 min flush with argon. the Dowex column was rinsed with water (80 mL) to reach pH 5\u20136. the solvents were evaporated from the collected solution, and the residue was coevaporated four times with absolute ethanol. the residue was then lyophilized from water to afford a white hygroscopic powder. solid-supported Gppp-RNAs (1\u20139) and GpppN2\u2032-Om-RNAs (10\u201311) were deprotected and released from the support as follows: first, a 1 M solution of 1,8-diazadicyclo-[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in anhydrous CH3CN was applied to the column for 3 min. second, a 30% aqueous ammonia solution was applied to the column in three the crude mixtures (1\u20135), (10\u201311) were then purified by semipreparative IEX-HPLC using a 0%\u201375% linear gradient of buffer B in buffer A at 50\u00b0C. the pure fractions of the Gppp-RNAs (1\u20135), (9\u201311) were pooled in 100-mL round-bottomed flasks and were concentrated to 0.5 mL under reduced pressure with a bath at 30\u00b0C. pDest14 was cloned into expression vector pDest14 (Invitrogen) to yield pDest14/6His-hMTase. it was grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. expression allowed for 18 h at 17\u00b0C. hMTase was eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0\u20131 M) in the same buffer. the protein elutes between 150 and 350 mM NaCl. the protein elutes between 150 and 350 mM NaCl. the reaction was started either with AdoMet after a pre-incubation of N7-hMTase with RNA. samples were then transferred to glass-fiber filtermats (DEAE filtermats, Wallac) by a Filtermat Harvester (Packard Instruments) crude 7mGppp-RNAs (12\u201314), (16) were analyzed using IEX-HPLC and a step gradient of 0%\u201315% of solvent B for 5 min, then 15%\u201330% for 15 min. after a 5-h incubation, the reaction was complete. mixture was subsequently redissolved in 2 mL of 50 mM TEAAc, pH 7.
