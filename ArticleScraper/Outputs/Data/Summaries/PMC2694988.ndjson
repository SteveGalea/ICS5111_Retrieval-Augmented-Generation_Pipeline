{"summary": "a 2007 article in PLoS Medicine described a new process used by the world health organization for rapidly developing clinical management guidelines. these situations include outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. the authors discussed how they developed such a \u201crapid advice\u201d guideline for the pharmacological management of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. inadequate initial treatment of life-threatening infections has serious consequences. common sense argues for recommending higher doses for such infections, at the expense of increased toxicity, to avoid any possibility of under-dosing patients with unusual pharmacokinetics. a \"rigorous and transparent\" process has recommended an adult dose of 75 mg twice daily for five days. oseltamivir doses of up to 1,000 mg have been given to volunteers. there seems little to gain and everything to lose by using a low dose of oseltamivir. in the case of pandemic influenza, the GRADE process has resulted in a dose recommendation for H5N1 influenza that could be too low. a \u201cmechanism-based\u201d approach would lead to initial use of the highest oseltamivir doses considered to have a low risk of major toxicity in H5N1 influenza. inadequate initial treatment of life-threatening infections has serious consequences. common sense argues for recommending higher doses for such infections. fortunately human infections are still rare, but this rarity also means that there are no published RCTs of treatment. dase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is considered the drug of choice [4],[5]. there is no parenteral formulation. H5N1 influenza replicates more rapidly than seasonal influenza viruses [4],[5], reaching much greater viral burdens than other human influenza viruses [6]. in the case of pandemic influenza, the GRADE process has resulted in a dose recommendation for H5N1 influenza that could be too low. a \u201cmechanism-based\u201d approach would lead to initial use of the highest doses considered to have a low risk of major toxicity in H5N1 influenza. oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) viruses are resistant to zanamivir. they are still susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir (Relenza) there are at least ten clades of H5N1 influenza viruses. clades 1 and 2.1 viruses are often adamantane-resistant, and representatives of clades 2.2 and 2.3 are adamantane-susceptible. combination of oseltamivir and ribavirin showed additive efficacy against clades 1 and 2. neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir has three chemical groups that interact with the active-site residues of neuraminidase, resulting in tight binding and a slow rate of dissociation. the ability of pioglitazone to modulate tissue-damaging compounds of the innate immune response without compromising T cell-mediated viral clearance. many virus and host factors influence the outcome of H5N1 disease progression. multiple anti-influenza drugs must be used to effectively treat and prevent the spread of infection. no definitive treatment exists for human infection with SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) sporadic human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 virus has caused illness in more than 440 people in 15 countries. mortality consistently higher than 60% among reported cases. clinical data on H5N1 antiviral treatment to guide clinicians are limited. oseltamivir strains in four clades, including three subclades of clade 2 viruses, have infected humans to date. resistance to adamantane antivirals (amantadine, rimantadine) is widespread among clade 2.1 and clade 1 virus. the biggest challenge for physicians to initiating antiviral treatment is to identify H5N1 virus-infected patients early, before severe disease progression has occurred. fortunately, H5N1 virus infection remains rare worldwide, so the only way to detect early infection is to test a huge number of suspected cases early. high-dose oseltamivir administration via oral gastric tube has been shown to achieve high plasma levels in two ventilated patients with H5N1 [56] in a very small number of severely ill patients with H5N1. the source of the immunotherapy was convalescent plasma from patients with H5N1 who survived or from a participant in an H5N1 vaccine clinical trial [50],[57],[58]. 5N1-affected countries may lead to improved clinical management with higher patient survival. a number of combined strategies should be considered for therapy of patients with H5N1."}
