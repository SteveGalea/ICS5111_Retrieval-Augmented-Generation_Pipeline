{"summary": "fecal, intestinal content, liver, kidney, lung, and blood samples were collected. total RNA was extracted from these samples and subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. results showed that these samples were positive for PdCV but negative for PEDV, TGEV, and PRCV. approximately three-fourths of the viral genome encodes two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), producing up to 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP) downstream of ORF1, PdCV contains six additional ORFs (ORF2 to ORF7) that code for the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), and NS7. the genome sizes (25,422 nt) of all U.S. PdCVs are identical. the genome sizes (25,422 nt) of all U.S. PdCV strains are identical. the genome sizes (25,422 nt) of all U.S. PdCVs are identical. only 3 amino acid differences were found in the NS6 proteins among all PdCV strains. the nucleotide sequences of the N and NS7 genes of PdCV Ohio CVM1 share higher homology with those of Hong Kong strain HKU15-44. corresponding nucleotides in all other U.S. strains are 405T, 534A, 558A, and 564G. phylogenetic trees were constructed using 11 U.S. PdCV strains, two Hong Kong PdCV strains, one South Korean PdCV strain, and nine avian deltacoronavirus strains. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method in the MEGA 6 program using 11 U.S. PdCV strains, two Hong Kong PdCV strains, one South Korean PdCV strain, and nine avian deltacoronavirus strain phylogenetic analysis of mammalian and avian deltacoronaviruses. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. the scale bar indicates the estimated number of substitutions per 20 amino acids. the two uninfected Gn piglets had normal feces (score of 0) and no clinical signs of illness. the piglets Experiment Pig typea No. of piglets Virus/doseb Clinical sign scorec ITd (days) three out of five Gn piglets in one isolator were orally inoculated with 106 PFU of the PdCV MI strain, a swine testicular (ST) cell-adapted, plaque-purified virus. the other two Gn piglets in the same isolator received Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) the cell culture-adapted PdCV MI strain caused gross pathology similar to that of PdCV Ohio CVM1 in piglets. twenty-four hours after challenge with PdCV Ohio CVM1, severe villous atrophy of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was apparent. no lesions were found in the stomachs of uninfected piglets. a viable syncytial giant cell in jejunal epithelia is adjacent to a necrotic syncytial giant cell that is in the process of being sloughed into the intestinal lumen. by 48 h p.i., villous atrophy of the small intestine was further advanced; all divisions of small intestine contained only short blunted villi variably lined by flatt. many mucosal epithelial cells were necrotic and lysed. nuclear changes consistent with cell death included pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and karyolysis. epithelium-origin syncytial giant cells were still evident. regeneration was most prominent in the duodenum and least evident in the ileum. multinucleated giant cells could still be seen, but these were necrotic and in the process of being sloughed into the gut lumen. small foci of mononuclear cell infiltrates and occasional dilated gastric pits were seen in gastric mucosa. the figure illustrates the bronchocentric distribution of the nonexudative histologic change in the lung. the figure illustrates interstitial thickening of the alveolar cell walls. the figure illustrates interstitial thickening of the alveolar cell walls. PdCV replicates in the epithelium of the small intestine and does not cross-react serologically with PEDV. panels A to C were stained with hyperimmune serum against PEDV. ecal samples 24 to 72 h p.i. were relatively low. viral RNA shedding in intestine and feces significantly exceeded that of the input virus. three 19-day-old Gn piglets were orally inoculated with 106 genomic RNA copies of PdCV Ohio CVM1. three 10-day-old Gn piglets were orally inoculated with 106 PFU of the PdCV MI strain. piglets C1 and C3 did not receive virus inoculation and were terminated on day 7 p.i. all four piglets inoculated with the PdCV MI strain developed sudden-onset, severe, and watery diarrhea. all piglets had severe watery diarrhea on day 1 p.i., but no or low viral RNA (1.0 log10 viral RNA copies/g) was detected in feces. no obvious gross and histologic lesions were observed in conventional piglets. disease associated with PdCV has not been reported in china and other Asian countries. however, clinical signs were not described in their study. further outbreaks of HKU15-associated diseases in pigs have not been documented. the first mammalian source of deltacoronavirus was detected in rectal swabs of Asian leopard cats. 2.4% of Asian leopard cats (35 out of 1,453 samples) were positive for deltacoronavirus. 1.1% of Chinese ferret-badgers were also positive for deltacoronavirus. TGEV and PEDV are members of the Alphacoronavirus genus. they cause almost identical clinical signs and gross and histological lesions in young, susceptible pigs (6, 12, 24, 26) however, there is no serological cross-reactivity between TGEV and PEDV. mild and ill-defined interstitial lesions in pulmonary parenchyma suggest PdCV may have an unrecognized PRCV-like respiratory component. the demonstrated pathogenicity in PdCV may reflect an emergent property inherent in sequence changes from otherwise closely related CoVs. Ohio CVM1 caused more severe disease in conventional piglets than in Gn piglet at the same inoculation dose. the reduced virulence of the MI strain may reflect a degree of attenuation secondary to cell culture adaptation. five grams of feces and intestine contents were homogenized in 50 ml of DMEM. the suspension was centrifuged at 5,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. filtered intestinal contents were negative for any bacteria or fungal growth. RT-PCR was performed using a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) eight sets of primers were designed to amplify the full-length genome of the PdCV Ohio CVM1 strain. the PCR products were purified and sequenced at the Ohio State University plant microbe genetics facility. five 19-day-old Gn piglets were randomly divided into two groups. two piglets in group 1 served as uninfected controls. piglets were orally challenged with 5.0 ml of filter-sterilized intestinal contents. three piglets (C1, C3, and C5) in isolator 1 were orally challenged with 5 ml of DMEM containing 106 PFU of the PdCV MI strain. the remaining two piglets (C2 and C4) did not receive any treatment. this experiment was designed to determine whether PdCV can be transmitted from the virus-inoculated piglets to the uninoculated piglets. blood and serum were collected first postmortem. tissue samples were glandular stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, ileum, cecum, spiral colon, terminal colon, spleen, liver, kidney, and lung. total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy minikit. intestine, stomach, lung, kidney, spleen, and liver were fixed in 10% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered formalin for 24 to 36 h. sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the nucleotide sequences of the genomes and the amino acid sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) were compared to those of other CoVs using DNASTAR software. phylogenetic tree construction was performed using the neighbor-joining method with the MEGA 6 program. download Figure S2, TIF file, 2.6 MB (2.6MB, tif) Figure S3 Gross pathology of gnotobiotic piglet infected by the PdCV MI strain. intestinal tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin."}
