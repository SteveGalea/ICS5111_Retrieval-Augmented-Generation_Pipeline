{"summary": "CSCs are thought to be responsible for cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance. they were not isolated until the mid-1990s, but the concept dates back more than one and a half centuries ago. skeptics of the hypothesis criticize the use of surface biomarkers or enzymatic activity for the identification of CSCs. critics have challenged whether tumor growth must be initiated by a rare CSC population. stem cell niche is a specialized microenvironment where normal cells and CSCs reside. the niche is composed of a heterogeneous population of cells that provide normal stem cells with signals to proliferate, differentiate, and undergo asymmetrical cellular division. it is unclear whether CSCs direct the formation of the TME or take advantage of the resident microenvironment. a number of processes are thought to contribute to the establishment of a TME. chronic inflammation from wounding or carcinogen exposure enhances cell proliferation and activates the microenvironment. hypoxia, inflammation, and desmoplasia influence CSCs through secretion of factors that activate developmental signaling pathways. Conversely, CSCs secrete pro-angiogenic and growth factors to promote a tumor-supportive TME. these studies show that elements of the TME are instructive to tumor cells making them more or less tumorigenic. tracheal epithelium is composed mainly of columnar and mucus secreting goblet cells that function to trap and clear foreign particles. cellular turnover in the adult trachea is very low (39) until epithelial injury elicits a rapid response of proliferation in surviving cells, except ciliated cells (40), to repair the tissue. the supposition of Clara cells as progenitors for the airway epithelium has been widely disputed due in large part to the identification of subpopulations of CCSP-expressing cells. the variant Clara cells express lower levels of CCSP, but do not possess the ability to self-renew. the specific cell of origin that gives rise to small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) remains to be elucidated. it is alluring that SCLC predominately localizes to the midlevel bronchioles and is associated like PNECs with primitive neuroendocrine features. analysis of human lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples has revealed a BASCs phenotype in 52 of 57 cases characterized by expression of SPC, CCSP, and OCT4 (60). these studies strongly implicate self-renewing BASCs in the development of murine adeno- and bronchioalveolar carcinomas; however, it remains to be elucidated in human lungs. it is plausible that the c-Kit positive human lung stem cells are adult somatic lung cells that have been induced or derepressed to form a novel committed progeny. iPS cells, even without the use of a retrovirus, have demonstrated a degree of risk in developing teratomas (65). rat tracheal basal cells were found to be competent in reconstituting a complete mucociliary epithelium in denuded tracheal grafts (42). human bronchial basal cells have also been shown by in vitro assays to form heterogeneous spheres. this locus also contains the transcription factor gene Sox2. a novel isolation method characterized murine lung CCSP-expressing cells that exhibited a number of stem cell-like properties. the supposition of Clara cells as progenitors for the airway epithelium has been widely disputed due in large part to the identification of subpopulations of CCSP-expressing cells that may or may not be independent cell populations. distal airways include the terminal bronchioles and alveoli and function in gas exchange. PNECs may be the origin of SCLC. c-Kit positive human lung stem cells could induce lung repair following injury. this subpopulation of cells expressed four genes known to govern pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) the presence of a bona fide human lung stem cell does not depreciate the importance of Basal cells, variant Clara cells, PNECs, or BASCs in response to lung repair and regeneration. despite the complexity of the disease, identification and validation of lung CSCs has been obstructed by the complexity of the disease and a deficiency in understanding the hierarchical structure of lung epithelial stem cells. the significance of CD133 expression as a prognostic marker in NSCLC has been controversial. mizugaki et al. (72) reported that CD133 expression was significantly correlated with pathological stages II, III and IV and was an independent factor for poor prognosis. other lines of evidence have surfaced to suggest the original significance of CD133 expression may have been overstated. CD44 is poised to be a key player in identifying CSCs due to its innate ability to regulate adhesion, differentiation, homing, and migration. in lung cancer models, elevated CD44 expression was initially detected on specific differentiation phenotypes, including activated type II pneumocytes, squamous metaplasia. Akunuru et al. (92) demonstrated that an ALDH subpopulation from multiple NSCLC cell lines had stem cell-like qualities. these cells had a significant increase in expression of the developmental gene Notch1, self-renewal genes hes1 and shh, and EMT markers Twist and Snail. CD166 is a validated stem cell marker in normal hematopoietic and MSCs. it is widely accepted as a CSC marker in colorectal cancer (101), prostate (102,103), and glioblastoma (104) EC functional capacity to rescue mice from acute lung injury was unequivocally specific to CD166+ differentiated LECs. further studies are needed to investigate the therapeutic benefit and pathophysiological consequences of CD166 expression. uPA and its receptor uPAR play an integral role in regulating pathways important in cell migration and invasion (118). the importance of uPAR signaling was highlighted with the discovery of its role in inhibition of apoptosis (118). reversion of cell surface markers and/or long-lived dormant CSCs may have been activated in response to self-feedback regulation or a changing stem cell niche. a deeper understanding of CSC origin, function, and interaction with the microenvironment will aide in profiling the optimum combination of tumor specific CSC markers as well as identification of residual CSCs. CD133 expression may be used as a predictor for efficacy of cytotoxic therapy. but it did not represent a prognostic marker for positive in NSCLC. other lines of evidence have surfaced to suggest original significance may have been overstated. CD44 is poised to be a key player in identifying CSCs due to its innate ability to regulate adhesion, differentiation, homing, and migration. leung et al. demonstrated a subpopulation of CD44+ NSCLC cells were cisplatin-resistant and capable of spheroid body formation, in vivo tumor initiation and serial tumor transplantability. NSCLC patients harboring tumor cells overexpressing ALDH1A1 have significant resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chemotherapy drugs. in vivo non-cancerous airway epithelium exhibited high levels of ALDH1/2 expression, while in vitro two immortalized non-cancerous airway epithelial cell lines showed very weak expression. signaling pathways in enriched ALDH subpopulations may yield advancements in understanding lung CSC development and maintenance. other lung CSC markers CD166, also known as Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (ALCAM), are involved in differentiation, homing and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells. BMI1 polycomb ring finger oncogene (BMI-1) is involved in axial patterning, haematopoiesis, and cell cycle regulation (107). it is known to have a critical role in regulating self-renewal and maintenance of normal lung epithelial and BASCs (108) and CSCs (109). uPA and receptor uPAR play an integral role in regulating pathways important in cell migration and invasion (118). uPAR signaling was highlighted with the discovery of its role in inhibition of apoptosis (118). a subpopulation of SCLC cells from multiple cell lines demonstrated multidrug resistance, clonogenicity, and co-expressed the putative CSC marker CD44 (119). the existence of multiple CSC pools within individual tumors necessitates development of robust marker strategies that consider the dynamic state of CSCs. a deeper understanding of CSC origin, function, and interaction with the microenvironment will aide in profiling the optimal combination of tumor specific CSC markers. Wnt binds its receptor Frizzled activating Dvl proteins. these proteins block the Axin/APC/GSK-3 complex derepressing -catenin facilitating its promotion of cell proliferation. cisplatin-resistant A549 cells treated with a GSK-3 inhibitor had an increase in activity of Wnt signaling and expression of OCT4. inhibition of Wnt/-catenin signaling resulted in a dramatic reduction in OCT4 expression and cisplatin-sensitization. these studies provide strong evidence that Wnt signaling plays an important role in lung CSC properties. notch signaling is active in human lung tumor tissue samples and hypoxic lung tumor cell lines, but not normoxic tumor cell lines. cellular (NSCLC vs. SCLC) and microenvironmental (hypoxia) contexts play a profound role in tumor cell response to Notch activation. loss of PTEN causes or contributes to tumorigenesis in multiple tissues suggests PTEN may play a role in self-renewal and differentiation of TICs. additional studies have shown that PTEN plays a pivotal role in lung stem cell homeostasis and cell differentiation. these studies support a role for PTEN in lung carcinogenesis. Wnt binds its receptor Frizzled activating Dvl proteins. these proteins block the Axin/APC/GSK-3 complex derepressing -catenin facilitating its promotion of cell proliferation by regulating cyclin D1. notch activity has most commonly been reported in the context of Notch3 upregulation, but a gain-of-function Notch1 mutation has also been reported. other groups have shown that Notch activity facilitates NSCLC survival through inhibition of proapoptotic Bim and induction of antiapoptotic Survivin. shh signaling pathway regulates stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, and cell proliferation. tyrosine phosphatase, a known tumor suppressor gene (155), is a known tumor suppressor gene. studies show 74% of lung tumors had reduced or lost PTEN expression associated with alterations in TP53 staining (161) chemotherapeutic strategies against cancer are severely limited and routinely unsuccessful. the mechanisms by which CSCs are resistant to conventional therapies are very diverse. novel therapeutic strategies must be developed to eliminate CSCs. successful pre-clinical and clinical trials have employed strategies of targeting CSCs via use of CSC surface markers, inhibition of developmental stem cell pathways, and ablation of CSC niches. combinational treatment of enriched CD133+/CD44+ lung stem cells with antipsychotic drug trifluoperazine and gefitinib or cisplatin resulted in downregulation of CSC-associated gene signatures. in vitro targeting of the Hh pathway has shown effective anti-tumorigenic activity in adenocarcinoma and SCLC as well as enhanced the effects of cisplatin (173) clinical trials will ascertain if CSC signaling is inhibited by mithramycin, a telomerase inhibitor, in thoracic malignancies. clinical trials testing cancer stem cell-targeted therapies in lung cancer patients are summarized in Table 1. Clinical trials testing cancer stem cell-targeted therapies in lung cancer patients. the ability of a cell to colonize a foreign microenvironment reflects its hierarchical position within the original tumor. in the last several years, researchers have devoted a tremendous amount of resources to the development of novel therapeutic strategies including the innovation of nanomedicine. a multifunctional nanoparticle could be elegantly designed to carry four key elements. nanoparticles are not necessarily the silver bullet for cancer therapy. nanoparticles are riddled with challenges such as size, charge, biodistribution, and variability in manufacturing."}
