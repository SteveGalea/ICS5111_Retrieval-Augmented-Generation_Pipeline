{"summary": "the lung is an attractive target organ for RNAi-based therapy. previous work harnessing RNAi for treatment of acute pulmonary infections has shown promise1,2,3,4 but target gene knockdown has been transient and not restricted to specific lung lineages. specificity of RNAi expression is strongly associated with mechanism of delivery. method to downregulate expression of a gene central to the inflammatory response in the lung. lentivirus-based approach to track transcription factor activity in live animals. lentivirus-based approach to track transcription factor activity in live animals. lenti-DsRed-shGFP vector designed for delivery of a shRNA sequence targeting enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) a 20 bp sense sequence depicted in red targets eGFP and is followed by a linking loop sequence (blue) and then by the complementary, antisense sequence (green) lenti-DsRed-shGFP or -scramble was delivered to transgenic -actin-GFP mice by intratracheal instillation. four weeks later, alveolar macrophages (AMs) were harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage. lentiviral transduction of a subset of lung CD11b+/CD11c+ dendritic cells occurs. transcription factor NF-B has been implicated in a variety of lung diseases. nonselective or global inhibition of NF-B can be highly toxic, as evidenced by embryonic lethality of the p65 knockout mouse. western blots of lysates from clonal populations of Raw 264.7 macrophages found less p65 protein in lenti-GFP-shp65 transduced clones than in those transduced with lenti-GFP-scramble. p65 knockdown in vitro and in vivo has been modified to target the NF-B subunit, p65 (RelA) lenti-GFP-shp65 knockdown was restricted to transduced (GFP+) cells. fewer neutrophils were found in BAL cytospins from mice treated with lentivirus. p65 mRNA was significantly reduced in transduced (GFP+) AMs. p65 knockdown was occurring only in transduced AMs or was spreading to all resident (CD11c+) lung AMs. p65 knockdown selectively occurred in GFP+ AMs and persisted in the setting of LPS-induced inflammation. p65 knockdown did not significantly affect expression of several other genes known to be NF-B dependent. lentivirus-based knockdown of p65 message restricted to transduced AMs 4 weeks after lentiviral treatment. knockdown of p65 in transduced subset resulted in decreased presence of neutrophils in the BAL of LPS-exposed mice. to assess the effects of relative p65 levels on global lung inflammatory signaling, we analyzed levels of 11 different cytokines. in the BALF of mice deficient in p65 resulting either from RNAi delivery (with lenti-GFP-shp65) or cre-mediated excision (p65/) we sought to track in real time the kinetics of NF-B activation in AMs in vivo. traditional assays of NF-B activation require harvesting the cells (in vitro) or animal (in vivo) of interest to determine whether nuclear translocation and DNA binding of promoter activity is turned on in the presence of NF-B activation. promoter activity is constitutively expressed by the ubiquitin C promoter. lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP treated Raw 264.7 cells by flow cytometry. luciferase production was not affected by NF-B binding activity. transduction with lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP resulted in luciferase activity. in vivo, real-time imaging of NF-B activation was performed. more recent literature has instead reported that resident AMs persist in the alveolar space following LPS. a high percentage of lavaged AMs were found to be GFP+. BAL cells from animals previously treated with lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP demonstrate NF-B-driven luciferase activity, regardless of whether or not they were previously exposed to LPS in vivo. subsets of AMs lavaged from each animal were cultured overnight before incubation in media with or without LPS. the dTomato reporter has been cloned into the second position of lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP to create lenti-NF-B-luc-dTomato. this combination of reporters allows independent tracking of transduced cells in experiments combining this vector with lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP reporter vector. lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP reporter vector has been cloned into the second position. two weeks after IT lenti treatment, a photon camera was used to quantify luciferase activity of recipient mice. less NF-B-driven luciferase activity is measured in lenti-GFP-shp65 treated mice in response to IT LPS. fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry revealed no difference in the percentage of AMs transduced with lenti-NF-B-dTomato in the two experimental groups. repeat experiments substituting lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP resulted in higher transduction efficiency consistent with our typical results. lenti-DsRed-shGFP vector designed for delivery of a shRNA sequence targeting enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) a 20 bp sense sequence depicted in red targets eGFP and is followed by a linking loop sequence (blue) and then by the complementary, antisense sequence (green) lenti-DsRed-shGFP or -scramble was delivered to transgenic -actin-GFP mice by intratracheal instillation. four weeks later, alveolar macrophages (AMs) were harvested by bronchoalveolar lavage. lentiviral transduction of a subset of lung CD11b+/CD11c+ dendritic cells does occur. transcription factor NF-B has been implicated in a variety of lung diseases. nonselective or global inhibition of NF-B can be highly toxic. western blots of lysates from clonal populations of Raw 264.7 macrophages found less p65 protein in lenti-GFP-shp65 transduced clones than in those transduced with lenti-GFP-scramble. the vector depicted in Figure 1a has been modified to target the NF-B subunit, p65 (RelA) mice treated with control vector (fluorescence activated cell sorter) plots depict representative data. p65 knockdown after treatment with lenti-GFP-shp65 persisted in setting of LPS stimulation. fewer neutrophils were found in BAL cytospins from mice treated with lentivirus. p65 knockdown was occurring only in transduced AMs or was spreading to all resident (CD11c+) lung AMs. we then quantified p65 mRNA levels, comparing sorted transduced AMs (GFP+) to nontransduced (GFP) AMs from groups of mice treated with the control versus shp65 expressing vectors. lentivirus-based knockdown of p65 message restricted to transduced AMs 4 weeks after lentiviral treatment. knockdown of p65 in transduced subset resulted in decreased presence of neutrophils in the BAL of LPS-exposed mice. p65 is deleted after cre-mediated excision in myeloid cells including AMs. to allow tracking of NF-B activation in vivo, we created a novel lentiviral vector (lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP, Figure 3a) containing four tandem copies of the NF-B consensus sequence located upstream of the minimal TA promoter (TAp), the TATA box of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter. this combination of reporter genes allows for independent tracking of transduce promoter activity is turned on in the presence of NF-B activation. lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP treated Raw 264.7 cells by flow cytometry. 37% of cells are transduced (GFP+) NF-B-luc-GFP-transduced cells alone exhibited a dramatic increase in luciferase activity indicating that NF-B-driven luciferase production had occurred. a subset of cells was analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the transduction efficiency. the GFP mean fluorescence intensity of LPS stimulated and unstimulated cells was identical, indicating that UBC-driven gene expression from the second position was not affected. more recent literature has reported that resident AMs persist in the alveolar space following LPS. a high percentage of lavaged AMs were found to be GFP+ suggesting that tagged AMs persisted in the alveolar space following inflammatory injury. subsets of AMs lavaged from each animal were cultured overnight before incubation in media with or without LPS. tagged AMs persisting after LPS stimulation were in fact capable of upregulating NF-B activity in response to repeated LPS exposure. the dTomato reporter vector has been cloned into the second position of lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP to create lenti-NF-B-luc-dTomato. the red dTomato fluorochrome has been cloned into the second position of lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP to create lenti-NF-B-luc-dTomato. two weeks after IT lenti treatment, a photon camera was used to quantify thoracic luciferase activity of recipient mice. less NF-B-driven luciferase activity is measured in lenti-GFP-shp65 treated mice in response to IT LPS. the presence of lenti-NF-B-dTomato in this experiment resulted in lower transduction efficiency consistent with our typical results. repeat experiments substituting lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP resulted in higher transduction efficiency consistent with our typical results. p65 knockdown diminishes the LPS-induced influx of neutrophils to the lung demonstrating its functional significance. knockdown of p65 in a subset of AMs is sufficient to decrease NF-B signaling in the entire lung. both resident AMs and alveolar epithelial cell NF-B signaling ultimately contribute to the inflammatory response in the lung. lenti-GFP-shp65-transduced dendritic cells persist in the alveolar space even after significant inflammatory LPS injury. if confirmed, this finding could have broad implications for clinical application of lentiviral gene therapy. our vector allows for linear tracking of p65 activation in individual, live animals. this characteristic has many potential advantages, not the least of which is the need for fewer animals to perform measurements at multiple time points. this tool will provide a new approach to the study of AM function and could potentially be used to alter the course of lung diseases. pLVTHM is a previously published lentiviral backbone expressing a GFP reporter gene under control of the ubiquitous EF1 promoter. an element precedes the H1 promoter that allows tetracycline (teto)-inducibility of the H1 promoter in the presence of additional constructs that express a repressor fusion protein, TTR-KRAB. amplicon was cloned into the pLVTHM backbone downstream of the EF1 promoter. previously published shRNA's targeting eGFP16 or p6530 were adapted for cloning into pLVTHM by the addition of MluI (5\u2032) and ClaI (3\u2032) restriction sites. d cells were harvested and fluorochrome expression was assessed by flow cytometry (BD FACScan; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, and FlowJo analysis software; Treestar, Ashland, OR) Raw 264.7 cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml LPS (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) for 6 hours before analysis. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane in preparation for IT lentivirus or IT LPS injections. RNA was isolated from sorted, GFP+ AMs using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) mRNA expression levels were normalized to 18s rRNA and quantification of relative gene expression presented as fold change compared with the relevant baseline was calculated using the 2-CT method. all flow cytometry was performed on BD FACScan or BD LSR II (BD Biosciences) instruments. analysis of raw data was completed using FlowJo software (Treestar) BALF aliquots from mice exposed to lentiviruses and LPS were analyzed for levels of up to 11 cytokines. fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis of lavaged AMs from a mouse treated with a mixture of red (CMV-dsRed) and green (NF-B-luc-GFP) lentivirus. similar percentages of double positive AMs between groups."}
