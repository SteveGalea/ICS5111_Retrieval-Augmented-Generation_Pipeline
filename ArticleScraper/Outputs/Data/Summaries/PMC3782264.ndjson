{"summary": "current human clinical trials using live attenuated virus vaccines are rare. current human trials using live attenuated virus vaccines are rare. a variety of other antigen delivery systems are available for vaccine research. the induction of optimal immunity is incompletely understood. the choice of one vector over another for each vaccine has been largely based on the key characteristics of the vector. some of these vectors have been employed in clinical trials for an anti-HIV-1 vaccine[16-20], all obtaining unsatisfactory results. the fate of the DNA after injection has been a concern due to the risk of integration of the nucleic acids into the host genome. however, all available data suggest that frequency of integration is below the frequency of spontaneous mutation. failures and triggering of disease exacerbation instead of protection have also been reported on the use of DNA vaccines. VLP-based vaccines are in various stages of development, spanning preclinical evaluation to market. this can be achieved by constructing chimeric VLPs that display heterologous epitopes. however, generating chimeric VLPs is almost impossible to predict. phage libraries with specific antisera have been screened to identify phages displaying peptides, which correspond to or mimic antigenic epitopes. the filamentous bacteriophage fd (others are M13, f1) is well understood at both the structural and genetic levels. hybrid bacteriophages simultaneously displaying helper and/or cytotoxic epitopes on the same virion. they were obtained by infecting bacterial cells, harboring a plasmid encoding a modified gene VIII, with an engineered bacteriophage carrying a second copy of a modified gene VIII. this surprising finding supports the further exploration of this benign bacteriophage as a powerful and versatile antigen-delivery system. functional phage particles were purified and Western immunoblotting analysis confirmed the identity of the 90 kDa scFv fusion protein expressed by the recombinant fd. bacteriophage fd particles displaying the scFv from NLDC-145 mouse monoclonal antibody at the N-terminus of the pIII gene were able to induce activation and maturation of mouse DCs in vivo or in vitro. two of its component enzymes, E1 and E3, assemble over the surface of a large structural scaffold formed by the core enzyme, E2, a dihydrolipoyl acyltransferase. the core enzyme, a lipoyl domain (LIP) of 9.5 kDa, a peripheral subunit-binding domain (PSBD) of 5.3 kDa and a catalytic (acetyltransferase) core domain ( a suitable engineered E2 core (E2DISP) can display 60 copies of heterologous polypeptides on the surface of a high molecular mass scaffold[72]. this property can be exploited for vaccine design. small epitopes (9-15 aa) displayed on the scaffold elicit both cellular and humoral specific immune responses. if soluble, the proteins can be denatured and refolded slowly by step-down dialysis to obtain soluble VLPs. this reduces the number of displayed heterologous proteins per VLP. in this context we have successfully expressed and refolded a large array of HIV antigens and protein domains. we evaluated the immunogenicity of these purified 60mer VLPs in mice and rabbits, alone and in combination with an HIV Env glycoprotein (gp160) expression plasmid. we demonstrated that simultaneous co-immunization with Env(V3)-E2 VLPs and gp160 encoded DNA was more effective than each individual component alone. the exposed peptides have a stable three-dimensional structure closely resembling what they exhibit in the wild-type parent protein[66]. we have shown that the peptides expressed on the pVIII phage major coat protein can both produce specific antibodies and present T helper epitopes[67]. we have engineered two restriction sites into the fdAMPLAY388 bacteriophage vector by site-directed mutagenesis. this allows the insertion of peptides/proteins at the N-terminus of the pIII gene. thus, we cloned into the fdAMPLAY vector a single chain antibody fragments (scFv) from NLDC-145 mouse monoclonal antibody. the scFv is composed of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain variable regions of the mouse monoclonal antibody NLDC-145, assembled with a (Gly4Sert)3 linker to yield a 750 bp long single-chain fragment. the PDH complex belongs to the family of 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes. Efficient refolding of E2 into the 60-mer is also possible by replacing the natural peripheral domains with foreign peptides as N-terminal fusions to the CD. a suitably engineered E2 core (E2DISP) can display 60 copies of heterologous polypeptides on the surface of a high molecular mass scaffold. this property can be exploited for vaccine design. large polypeptides can be presented on the scaffold as N-terminal fusions to the acetyltransferase CD. in practice, several proteins, such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP), have been expressed as an N-terminal fusions[72]. monomers at different molar ratios reduce the number of displayed heterologous proteins per VLP. we have successfully expressed and refolded a large array of HIV antigens and protein domains. in this context, we have successfully expressed and refolded a large array of HIV antigens and protein domains. the revival of interest in vaccines has been underpinned by a rapidly expanding body of knowledge in the fields of immunology and biotechnological advancement in recent years. the revival of interest in vaccines has of course been underpinned by a rapidly expanding body of knowledge in the fields of immunology. could be combined with other well-studied vaccines in attempt to elicit full-spectrum immune responses."}
