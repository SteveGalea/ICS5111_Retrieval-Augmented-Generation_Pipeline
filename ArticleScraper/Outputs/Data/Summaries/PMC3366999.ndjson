{"summary": "avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1) has spread across 3 continents. it is now considered to be endemic in several south-east Asian countries and Egypt. ongoing circulation of HPAIV H5N1 continues to be a major public health concern. viet Nam is one of the most severely affected countries in the current HPAI H5N1 pandemic [20], with the disease considered to be endemic in both northern and southern Viet Nam. only sporadic outbreaks have been reported in both northern and southern Viet Nam [20] traders were asked to identify the other LBMs of which they were aware and to rank them according to the number of live poultry sellers. these identified LBMs were then integrated into the survey and their traders were in turn asked to name the LBMs that they considered the biggest. in total, 30 markets were recruited in northern Viet Nam. traders in the markets had to sell or purchase birds in an LBM at least 1 day per month. a seller was defined as selling live poultry mostly to the end-user or to another trader who would then sell the poultry at another location. a middleman was defined as selling live poultry to mostly sellers or purchasing live poultry from sellers. markets classified as retail or wholesale markets if more than two thirds of sellers were retailers or wholesalers. trade practices likely to influence the sustainability of virus circulation were recorded. susceptibility of chickens and ducks (muscovy or mallard duck derived breeds) to infection is known to differ. Statistical analysis questionnaire data were entered in Microsoft Access 2007\u00ae database. the accuracy of the data entry was verified by cross-checking each questionnaire with the recorded entry. factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) [29], [30] was used. live poultry trade is only a small, irregular activity in most markets. only the largest LBMs in terms of the number of poultry sold were eligible. study provinces were selected based on demographic features rather than outbreak reports. the snowball approach described above was applied only at the province level in Bac Giang, but also at the lower administrative level, the district level, in Ha Noi. the present day province of Ha Noi is the result of the recent merging of an urban centre (former Ha Noi province) and a rural area (former Ha Tay province) 4 of 5 districts in the urban centre and 2 of 13 districts in the rural area were randomly selected. traders consisted of sellers and middlemen. a seller was defined as selling live poultry mostly to the end-user. a middleman was defined as selling live poultry to sellers and then selling them at another location. Traders' practices likely to influence the sustainability of virus circulation in LBMs were recorded. the number of days during which traders were active, and the length of time they spent at market in a day. the susceptibility of chickens and ducks (muscovy or mallard duck derived breeds) to infection is known to differ. variables were summarized as medians with inter-quartile ranges (IQR); binary and categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) [29], [30] was used. this method allows a reduction in the dimensions of multivariate data. men in 8 Cambodian LBMs declined interviews. the refusal rate was 8% among Vietnamese traders. in Cambodia, only 2 (2%) people declined interviews. most Vietnamese (80%, n = 340) and Cambodian (70%, n = 54) sellers reported having a surplus, at least occasionally. most middlemen kept their poultry in LBMs for a very short time. Sellers trading only chickens 20 (47%) 51 (31%) 16 (23%) 30 (47%) Sellers trading only ducks 3 (7%) 14 (9%) 9 (13%) 17 (27%) Number of poultry sold No. chickens sold/day 7 (6\u201310) 20 (11\u201342) 10 (5\u201319) 200 (100\u2013417) No. ducks sold/day 6 (5\u20139) 15 (8\u201330) 9 (5\u201315) 142 (100\u2013200) Supply management No supply (farmers) 40 (93 1 (2%) Small commercial farms (50\u2013500) 1 (33%) 74 (52%) 34 (62%) 33 (58%) Large farms (>500) 0 (0%) 14 (10%) 4 (7%) 23 (40%) No. suppliers*** No. supplying farmers/day - 3 (2\u20135) 3 (1\u20134) 1 (1\u20132) Sellers visiting at least another market Yes 9 (21%) 78 (48%) 27 (38%) 2 (3%) No 34 (79%) 84 (52%) 44 (62%) 62 Vietnamese sellers in Cluster V.1 were farmers or occasional sellers. most farmers' flocks consisted of 50\u2013500 birds and were located in the market vicinity. cluster V.4 included sellers spending more time at market, with 64% (n = 64) trading at least 10 hours per day, and selling substantially more poultry than other clusters. median surplus frequency of 29% and median proportion of unsold birds, less than 10% for chickens and ducks, were much lower than those reported by cluster V.3 sellers. cluster V.2 and V.3 sellers were also supplied by backyard farms, while cluster V.4 sellers were also supplied by large farms (>500 birds) cluster V.3 was the only, or the predominant, seller profile in 13 of the 17 Ha Noi retail and mixed markets. however, this seller profile was absent in 2 markets located in peri-urban areas, far from the main urban centres. clusters V.3 sellers (medium-scale sellers with high surplus) increased the time spent by birds in the LBM system. surplus and supply features exhibited by cluster V.2 and V.4 sellers (large-scale sellers) meant their birds spent little time in LBMs, limiting their potential to sustain virus circulation. most large-scale sellers (V.4) operated in Ha Noi wholesale markets. from which a substantial part of the poultry population was then sold to retail market sellers. in contrast, cluster V.1 sellers (farmers and irregular sellers) were unlikely to play a major role in spatial virus spread as they only traded in markets located in their vicinity. sellers operated in provinces other than Phnom Penh. basic information on market type and location could be easily collected from each LBM. implementation of strategies aiming at breaking virus amplification cycles in all markets is unnecessary. the retail and mixed markets identified in Ha Noi were likely to be similar to those not identified, given similar population densities and housing. the type and location of an LBM could be a good predictor of its seller profile composition and, thus, of its potential for sustaining virus circulation. this is of particular importance in resource-scarce countries with extensively developed LBM systems."}
