{"summary": "over 360 million people are persistently infected with hepatitis B virus. 1 million die each year from liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. BV-infected patients exploited the conventional HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-based protein vaccines. however, none of them led to an effective control of HBV infection. the strategies designed to specifically stimulate an HBV-specific T-cell response by a DNA vaccine encoding small and medium HBsAgs were also not successful. in recent years, additional criteria were developed to assess the quality of the responses to the new vaccines. we could demonstrate an excellent multifunctionality of the elicited WHcAg-specific CD8+ T cells in the mouse model. all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. pCGWHc plasmid was obtained from the WHV strain 8 WHcAg gene. the adenoviral vectors Ad5WHc and Ad5F35WHc expressing WHcAg were constructed using the AdEasy system and vectors pShuttle, pAdEasy-1, and pAdEasy-1/F35. the cassette insert was amplified by PCR using specific primers introducing XbaI and SbfI restriction sites. the insert was introduced into the XbaI/SbfI site between the -globin intron and polyadenylation signal of the expression cassette. up to 5 106 HEK-293A cells per well of a six-well plate were incubated until the cells reached a confluence of 80 to 90%. if staining, cells were fixed with 50% methanol (20 min at 4\u00b0C) the expressed WHcAg was detected by indirect staining with rabbit antiserum and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody as described previously (41). mice were pretreated by intramuscular injection of 50 l of cardiotoxin. animals were then intramuscularly vaccinated three times with 100 g of pWHcIm or pCGWHc (50 l per muscle) for the heterologous DNA prime-AdV boost regimen, mice received cardiotoxin pretreatment. two nave woodchucks (animals 46949 and 46957) were immunized with 5 109 PFU Ad5WHc and 4 weeks later boosted with 1 1010 PFU of Ad35WHc. two weeks after the last immunization, the woodchucks were challenged with 107 WHV genome equivalents (GE) two untreated woodchucks were infected only with WHV and served as controls. staining was performed using anti-CD8 (clone 56.6-7; BD Pharmingen) and anti-CD4 (clone L3T4; BD Pharmingen) T-cell antibodies. staining was performed during a 5-h restimulation of the splenocytes. target and referent cells in a 1:1 ratio were transferred into immunized mice 8 days after the last immunization and into age-matched nave mice. the splenocytes from these mice were analyzed by flow cytometry for the killing of the target cells. anti-human CD4 allophycocyanin-conjugated antibody (clone L200; BD Pharmingen) was used. Dead cells were excluded from analyses using 7AAD. glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), also known as aspartate transaminase, was quantified according to the standard diagnostic procedure at the central laboratory of university hospital Essen. a score of 21 for the SYFPEITHI program and a score of 200,000 for the BIMAS algorithm were considered good prediction scores. baby hamster kidney cells 21 (BHK-21; ATCC, CCL-10) were grown in monolayers in Eagle's minimum essential medium. human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK-293A; Microbix Biosystems, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with high glucose. cassette insert was amplified by PCR using primers introducing XbaI and SbfI restriction sites. insert was introduced into the XbaI/SbfI site located between the -globin intron and polyadenylation signal. recombinant Ad5WHc and Ad5F35WHc were generated by homologous recombination of pShuttleWHc.in with pAdEasy-1 and pAdEasy-1/F35. the vectors were purified with a Vivaspin AdenoPACK 100 kit. cultured cells were lysed in 1 SDS sample buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail. protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. proteins were stripped and reprobed with anti-beta-actin antibody as a loading control. animals were then intramuscularly vaccinated three times with 100 g of pWHcIm or pCGWHc (50 l per muscle) for the heterologous DNA prime-AdV boost regimen, mice received cardiotoxin pretreatment and two DNA immunizations. two untreated woodchucks (animals 58055 and 58056) were challenged with 107 WHV genome equivalents (GE) two untreated woodchucks were infected only with WHV and served as controls. preparation and in vitro stimulation of murine splenocytes was performed according to a previously described protocol (26). anti-IFN- (clone XMG1.2; BD Pharmingen), anti-tumor necrosis factor ([TNF-] clone MP6-XT22; eBioscience, Hatfield, United Kingdom) and anti-IL-2 (clone JES6-5H4; eBioscience, Hatfield, Germany). target and referent cells in a 1:1 ratio were transferred into immunized mice 8 days after the last immunization. splenocytes from these mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. 5 104 PBMCs were stimulated in vitro with WHcAg-derived peptides (EMC Microcollections) at a concentration of 5 g/ml for 5 days. unstimulated cells and cells stimulated with the CMV-derived peptide (YILEETSVM) served as negative controls. major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I)-restricted epitopes of WHcAg were predicted by two independent algorithms. a score of 21 for the SYFPEITHI program and a score of 200,000 for the BIMAS algorithm were considered good prediction scores. RESULTS Identification of the CD8+ epitopes of WHcAg in C57BL/6 mice. mer peptides, c6-20, c11-26, and c86-100, specifically stimulated CD8+ T cells to produce IFN- at mean frequencies 29.1%, 8.9%, and 16.8% respectively. a screening with shorter, overlapping 9-mer peptides covering the sequence of WHcAg from amino acids (aa) 7 to 22 and 86 to 100 was performed. peptides c6-20 and c11-25 within pool 1 and c86-94 within pool 3. overlapping 9-mer peptides pointed out exact positions of epitopes c13-21 (C) and c86-94 (D) unstimulated cells and cells stimulated with CMV-derived peptide served as controls. the levels of anti-WHc increased significantly in both groups of mice. the magnitude of the humoral response induced by immunization with the pCGWHc plasmid was significantly higher (P 0.005) at every analyzed time point than the response in pWHcIm-vaccinated mice. expression of WHcAg in HEK-293A cells 36 h after infection with recombinant adenoviral vectors Ad5WHc and Ad35WHc (MOI of 10) was performed using WHcAg-specific rabbit antiserum and a secondary FITC-conjugated antibody. control -actin immunoblotting was performed to estimate the variation in the total protein content of the cell lysates. unstimulated cells and cells stimulated with unrelated peptide served as controls. asterisks mark statistically significant difference between plasmid-vaccinated groups and control group of mice. a similar outcome was observed in splenocytes expanded with peptide c86-94. the mean percentages of IFN-+ CD4+ T cells were significantly higher in the group of mice immunized with pCGWHc than in the pWHcIm-immunized group. the heterologous DNA prime-AdV boost immunization elicits both robust and functional WHV-specific immune responses. the levels of anti-WHc antibodies were comparable in all mice immunized with pCGWHc plasmid either once or twice. the levels of IgG2a were significantly higher in the groups of mice boosted with recombinant adenoviral vectors than in those immunized with the DNA vaccine plasmid pCGWHc (P 0.005) DNA-Ad35WHc regimen with the DNA-only immunization regimen was performed by intracellular IFN- staining of splenocytes isolated 2 weeks after the last immunization. the mean percentage of IFN-+ CD8+ T cells directed against CD8+ T-cell epitope c13-21 was approximately 21.9% for the pCGWHc-immunized group of mice. a similar correlation was observed for splenocytes expanded with degranulation capacity of IFN-+ CD8+ splenic T cells expanded in vitro for 7 days with peptide c13-21. the bars represent the mean values and standard errors of the means obtained for each group of mice. asterisks mark statistically significant difference between plasmid-vaccinated groups and control group of mice. we determined the production of TH1 type cytokines by CD8+ T cells. the cytokine that had the strongest expression within the CD8+ T-cell population was IFN-. the least abundant cytokine was IL-2 (approximately 4-fold lower expression than IFN-) mice were immunized three times with the pCGWHc plasmid. at day 5, 8, or 14 after the last immunization, mice were sacrificed. the most effective elimination of peptide c13-21-loaded cells was observed in the spleen. background obtained in mice immunized with vectors that did not express WHcAg was 1.9%. kinetics of WHcAg-specific CTL-mediated elimination of target cells. mice were immunized two times with pCGWHc and boosted with pCG. two nave woodchucks (numbers 46949 and 46957) were immunized with both pCGWHc and pCGWHc. the other two animals (numbers 58063 and 70096) were immunized three times with the pCGWHc plasmid and served as a reference. woodchucks 46949 and 46957 immunized just once with Ad5WHc had aT-cell responses. the induced WHcAg-specific CTL response was significantly boosted in both animals. a greater than 4-fold increase in the percentage of WHcAg-specific CD107a+ CD3+ CD4[] T cells (13.3%) was shown. dot plots of PBMCs from woodchucks 58063 and 70096 immunized three times with DNA vaccine, pCGWHc. PBMCs were stimulated for 5 days with a panel of 10 WHcAg-specific peptides in triplicates. cells were then pulsed with [2-3H]adenine for 16 h. animal 58063 in Fig. 8A and animal 70096 received three immunizations with pCGWHc. serum WHV DNA was detected at only 2 to 4 weeks after the challenge. another animal showed viremia from weeks 2 to 4 p.i. and a brief breakthrough at week 7 p.i. two WHV nave woodchucks were immunized three times with pCGWHc plasmid (A and B) or with Ad5WHc/Ad35WHc (C and D) two weeks after last immunization woodchucks were intravenously inoculated with 1 107 WHV GE (week 0). the viral DNA was quantified by real-time PCR with a detection limit of 103 genome equivalents per reaction. cellular immune responses were determined by a CD107a degranulation assay in woodchuck sera. unstimulated cells and cells stimulated with WHsAg-derived epitopes. class I (MHC-I) H-2b-restricted epitopes within the WHcAg were used to accurately evaluate the CD8+ T-cell response in mice. we used the classical approach using overlapping peptides and in silico prediction algorithms. a screening with shorter, overlapping 9-mer peptides covering the sequence of WHcAg from amino acids (aa) 7 to 22 and 86 to 100 was performed. c57-65 (QALVCWDEL) and c132-140 (YRPPNAPIL) did not induce any IFN- production by CD8+ T cells. splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice immunized with a DNA plasmid expressing WHcAg were expanded in vitro with six pools containing six overlapping 15-mer peptides covering the sequence of WHcAg. after 7 days of culturing, intra a new DNA plasmid (pCGWHc) showed significantly higher WHcAg expression levels than a previously used DNA vaccine, pWHcIm. improved antigen expression may lead to induction of a more robust and multifunctional immune response in vivo. pWHcIm plasmid and pCGWHc plasmid containing -globin intron sequence. level of WHcAg expression between the plasmids was compared in the BHK cells 24 h posttransfection by indirect immunofluorescence staining (A and B, middle panels) and Western blotting (A and B, lower panels) four mice were injected intramuscularly with 100 l of PBS. asterisks mark statistically significant difference between pWHcIm- and pCGWHc-immunized mice. asterisks mark statistically significant difference between plasmid-vaccinated groups and control group. the magnitude of IFN- production by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the spleens of mice vaccinated with the pCGWHc plasmid was considerably greater than that of the pWHcIm-immunized group. the mean IFN- response after stimulation with immunodominant CD8+ epitope c13-21 was 57.4% for pCGWHc-vaccinated mice, which was significantly higher than the 29.5% detected for mice were primed two times (2) by immunization with the pCGWHc plasmid. four weeks later, boosting immunization with Ad5WHc or Ad35WHc. levels of anti-WHc antibodies were comparable in all mice immunized with just the pCGWHc plasmid. pCGWHc for reference was performed by intracellular IFN- staining of splenocytes isolated 2 weeks after the last immunization. no statistically significant difference in percentages of IFN-+ CD4+ T cells between the groups immunized with WHcAg-expressing vaccines was detected. Mice immunized with empty pCG and Ad5GFP served as controls. representative and summary WHcAg-specific IFN-+ CD4+ T-cell responses detected in the splenocytes expanded in vitro for 7 days with CD4+ T-cell epitope c13-21. the percentages of CD107a+ CD8+ T cells were significantly higher (P 0.0005) in the groups of mice boosted with Ad5WHc and Ad35WHc-only-immunized mice. the cytokine that had the strongest expression within the CD8+ T-cell population in all immunized groups was IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2. the average values of single, double, and triple cytokine producers were approximately 18%, 62%, and 20%, respectively. DNA prime-AdV boost immunization induces CD8+ T cells of stronger cytotoxic potential in vivo than DNA immunization alone. mice immunized in the DNA prime-Ad5WHc manner showed improved elimination of the peptide c13-21-loaded target cells from the spleen. the mean percentage of killing determined for six mice in that group was 43.8%. the bars represent the mean values and standard errors of the means obtained from groups of six mice immunized with WHcAg-expressing vaccines and four control mice immunized with empty pCG plasmid. the asterisks mark the statistically significant difference: *, 0.05; **, 0.005) pCGWHc plasmid of the nave woodchucks 58059 and 58063 induced a significant degranulation response against WHcAg epitope c96-110. the percentages of 2.7% CD107a+ T cells in the CD3+ CD4[] population detected for woodchuck 58063 and 2.5% detected for woodchuck 70096 were significantly higher than background values. woodchuck 58063 to c117-132 (SI of 3.0) and woodchuck 70096 to c109-124 (SI of 3.2) cellular immune response in woodchucks immunized with pCGWHc plasmid or adenoviral vectors. the PBMCs were stimulated for 5 days with a panel of 10 WHcAg-specific peptides in triplicates. the cells were then pulsed with [2-3H]adenine for 16 h. the incorporation of [2-3H]adenine was measured. the detected CTL responses were predominantly WHcAg specific. the degranulation responses against WHcAg-derived epitope c96-110 were usually present at the end of the viremia period. only a slight elevation in GOT levels was observed in immunized animals. two WHV nave woodchucks, 58055 (A) and 58056 (B), were intravenously inoculated with 1 107 WHV GE (week 0) the viral DNA was quantified by real-time PCR with a detection limit of 103 genome equivalents per reaction. cellular immune responses were determined by a CD107a degranulation assay in woodchuck PBMCs expanded in vitro for 3 days. woodchuck 58055 developed a chronic WHV infection and borderline CTL responses. no elevation of GOT levels was observed in the second control animal, 58056, indicating the lack of WHV-specific T-cell activity in the liver. the improved WHcAg expression by the novel DNA vaccine resulted in stronger humoral and cellular immune responses in mice than the previously used DNA vaccine (41, 44). as expected, both plasmids induced a TH1 response, confirmed by the IgG2a subtype of anti-WHc. cinia virus (58) and leishmania major (17) showed significantly higher percentages of CD107a+, IFN-+, TNF-+, and IL-2+ CD8+ T cells than the group immunized with DNA only. this finding can be a result of using the same priming strategy for all immunization regimens. denine-based proliferation assay was extremely low and detectable only in several woodchucks. these proliferative T-cell responses were slightly higher in woodchucks immunized with pCGWHc/Ad35WHc than in DNA-immunized woodchucks. the difference in the magnitude of the T-cell response elicited by the two vaccination regimens was well marked in the results of the flow cytometric CD107a degranulation assay. immunization of woodchucks resulted in a rapid and more robust production of anti-surface antibodies after WHV challenge. the most prominent anti-WHs response was detected in all immunized woodchucks. plasmid DNA vaccine and recombinant adenoviral vectors elicited a significant CTL response in nave woodchucks. a combination of these vaccines could be used as a therapeutic strategy against chronic hepadnaviral infections."}
