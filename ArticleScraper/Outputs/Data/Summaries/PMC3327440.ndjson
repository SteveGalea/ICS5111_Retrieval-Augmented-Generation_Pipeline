{"summary": "three microliters of dispase at a concentration of 0.2 U/l were injected into the vitreal cavities of 4\u20136-week-old mice. hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence analysis, and electroretinograms of the eyes were then performed to assess ocular changes. results Neutrophils were the main inflammatory infiltrating cells appearing at the anterior chamber. PVR is the most common cause of recurrent retinal detachment after retinal detachment repair, occurring in 5%\u201311% of patients [10,11]. the autoimmune hypothesis has been prompted by the observation that a PVR-like disease can be induced in rabbits. the pathogenesis of the anterior chamber and immune reactions has not been well documented. it is important to study the ocular pathogenesis and immune reaction after intravitreal dispase injection in mice. female mice, 4\u20136 weeks old, were anesthetized with 4.3% chloral hydrate. Pupils were dilated with 0.5% tropicamide (Shenyang Sinqi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd). intravitreal injections were performed in the dorsonasal quadrant (1 o\u2019clock) 1.5 mm away from the corneal limbus of the right eye. clinical PVR-like signs were defined as the presence of retinal folds, epiretinal membranes, and an uneven iris at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks during this experiment. mice used for histological studies were sacrificed at 0 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 5 days or 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks after injection. sections were washed four times in PBS (5 min each time) and mounted under coverslips in antifade solution (Applygen Technologies Inc., Beijing, China) the eyes were dilated with 0.5% tropicamide and dark-adapted for at least 30 min. the recordings were made using the Roland Ganzfeld system and PC-based signal acquisition and analysis software (Fa. Roland Consult, Brandeburg, Germany). the bright-flash response was elicited using the ISCEV standard flash of 2.4 cd/m2. the plates were then blocked with RPMI 1640 medium for 2 h. they were then stored overnight at 4 \u00b0C. the single-cell suspensions were plated in complete RPMI 1640. substrate solution (BD) with 200 l AEC chromogen solution (BD) 100 ul of the mixture was plated per well. plates were air dried overnight and read by the Champ Spot II ELISpot reader. intracellular staining and flow cytometry were performed. Isotype-matched controls for cytokines were included in each staining. ERG data were compared using the Student t test. a value of p0.05 was considered statistically significant. three l of dispase at 0.02 U/l were injected into the vitreal cavities using a Hamilton syringe fitted with a 30 G needle. control animals received 3 l of sterile saline solution. mice were divided into a dispase-injected group and a saline-injected control group (n=92, n=68) after injection, and dissected eyes were cryopreserved using the optimal cutting temperature compound. consecutive 6 m thick sections of each sample were cut and thaw-mounted onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides. primary antibodies served as markers, including glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP), glutamine synthase (GS), retinal pigment epithelium 65 (RPE65), alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), F4/ mouse monoclonal Abcam plc 332 Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, UK 1:50 a-SMA Rabbit polyclonal Abcam plc 332 Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, UK 1:50 a-SMA Rabbit polyclonal Abcam plc 332 Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, UK 1:50 CD3 Rat monoclonal R&D Systems, Inc, USA 1:50 CD56 Rabbit polyclonal Boster Biologic Technology, WuHan, China 1 photopic responses (settings: 0dB standard flash, fix on, backlight off 0.2HZ) and 30 Hz flicker ERGs were recorded. an enzyme-linked immunospot assay was performed, as described by Jager et al. as a positive control, 2 g/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Fluka, Sigma, Carlsbad, CA) was added in the absence of dispase. after 20 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C in CO2 incubators and washing, 2 g/ml of biotinylated antimouse-IFN- detection Ab (BD) in PBS/BSA/Tween. single-cell suspensions from the spleens of model mice at 4 weeks were prepared. dispase was added as a stimulus at 0.02 U/ml; as a positive control, 2 g/ml PHA (Fluka; Sigma, Louis, MO) were added in the absence of dispase. neutrophils appeared from hour 8 to hour 48 at the anterior chamber. no CD3+ labeled T cells, F4/80+ labeled macrophages, or CD56+ labeled natural killer (NK) cells were observed in the vitreous cavities. proliferative vitreoretinopathy development at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after dispase injection. hemorrhages, cataracts, and PVR were observed in the dispase-injected groups. retinal pigment epithelia Protein 65 (RPE-65; F) in epiretinal membranes (EMs) of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) model eyes. fibroblast cells, M\u00fcller cells, astroglial cells, and RPE cells involved in the process of PVR. mesopic ERG (0dB standard flash, fix on, backlight off 0.2HZ) data showed decreases in the a-wave in dispase-injected amplitude p-value a-wave saline-injected control eyes 10.8174.6006/uV 0.2120(>0.05) dispase-injected control eyes 8.01434.3735/uV b-wave saline-injected control eyes 100.0029.698/uV 0.001(0.05) dispase-injected control eyes 19.8867.774/uV Mesopic ERG (0dB Standard Flash, Fix On, BackLight Off intracellular staining was performed to test if IFN- was secreted from the spleens of dispase-injected mice at 4 weeks. the results indicate that IFN- was not secreted by CD4+ or CD8+ labeled T cells in dispase-injected mice. no CD3+ labeled T cells, F4/80+ labeled macrophages, or CD56+ labeled natural killer (NK) cells were observed in vitreous cavities or retinas at any early time point in either of the two groups. inflammatory infiltration profile (0\u20135 day time points) in diapase-injected control mice. dispase-injected mice developed cardinal features of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) no structural abnormalities were found in the control eyes at same time points. mesopic ERG (0dB standard flash, fix on, backlight off 0.2HZ) data showed decreases in the a-wave in dispase-injected PVR eyes. scotopic ERGs showed significant decreases in b-wave amplitudes of dispase-injected PVR eyes, but no decreases in the a-wave amplitudes of dispase-injected PVR eyes. uV b-wave saline-injected control eyes 100.0029.698/uV 0.001(0.05) dispase-injected control eyes 46.16727.766/uV 0.0110(0.05) dispase-injected control eyes 21.83611.487/uV b-wave saline-injected control eyes 180.5054.099/uV 0.0013(0.05) IL-2 was not detected at 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks in either dispas intracellular staining was performed to test if IFN- was secreted from the spleens of dispase-injected mice at 4 weeks. the results indicate that IFN- was not secreted by CD4+ or CD8+ labeled T cells in dispase-injected mice. authors have reported effects of matrix metalloproteinases [4] and a chimeric ribozyme-targeted proliferating cell nuclear antigen [5]. glial cells displaying upregulation of purinergic P2 receptor\u2013mediated responses [6,7] and the interaction of cell surface molecules, extracellular matrix proteins, cytoskeletal elements [8] and a foldable capsular vitreous body [9] in PVR. the role of inflammatory and immune cells in PVR membranes in the late stage of PVR has been reported in several studies. T lymphocytes were found in five of the eight subretinal membranes. CD4+ T cells were demonstrated in four of the membranes and CD8+ T cells in one of the membranes. three of six frozen membranes contained T cells positive for the IL-2 receptor. no B lymphocytes or neutrophils were observed, and there were no deposits of complement or immunoglobulins. clinically significant PVR with retinal detachment developed in 75% of mice at 8 weeks. the results of a recent study did not support the assumption that CD44 has a functional role in the pathogenesis of PVR. despite the prevalence of the autoimmune hypothesis for PVR, the present treatment of human PVR in clinics targets inflammation and proliferation. intravitreal dispase injection involved in mice."}
