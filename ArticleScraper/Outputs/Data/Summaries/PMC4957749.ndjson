{"summary": "enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are the main cause of morbidity and mortality due to diarrhea in travelers to and children under five in the developing world. the plasmid-encoded heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-I) of classical ETEC is structurally, functionally and immunologically related to cholera toxin (CT) of Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera (Sack 2011) initial studies identified two strains that produced LT-IIa (Pickett et al. 1986) or LT-IIb (Pickett et al. 1989) variants. recently, a third variant (LT-IIc) was described in a strain isolated from sick ostriches. the LT-II family now consists of three related subgroups. all LT-II toxin genes are flanked 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 by phage-related genes, suggesting that they may be prophage-encoded. all genes immediately 5\u2032 of the LT-II genes encode very similar phage lysozyme-like proteins. the immediate 3\u2032 phage-related genes are conserved within. this constitutively activated ADP-ribosylated Gs permanently activates host adenylate cyclase. this leads to increased cAMP levels that in intestinal cells ultimately lead to increased chloride secretion and production of profuse watery diarrhea. PT is also an A-B toxin with a single enzymatic subunit (S1) and a heteropentameric-binding subunit consisting of a five gene operon. CT and LT are potent immunomodulators that suppress an inflammatory response to infection. PT also promotes airway colonization and contributes to immunomodulatory effects observed during infection. these toxins have multiple effects on the host beyond the major disease symptom. LT-IIa isolate KH655 was obtained from ICDDRB, Bangladesh. Escherichia coli TE1 (Jobling and Holmes 2000) was used for routine cloning and expression of toxin genes. PCR was done with 0.2 mM dNTPs and 0.2 M primers. EplBIIa was amplified with EplBIIaKpnF and EplBIIaApaR. cloned as a KpnI-ApaI fragment into pApaH6 to make pAEplBgpgph6. the coding sequence for EplB is joined directly to a gly-pro-gly-pro-his6 linker. bound proteins were eluted with Talon buffer with 150 mM imidazole. toxin-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (buffer A) and further purified by HQ10 anion exchange chromatography. toxin containing extracts were serially diluted in 50 l of medium in 96-well plates. seeded with 150 l of freshly harvested cells in serum-containing medium at 104 cells per well. toxin neutralization was done by incubating cell extracts for 20 minutes. EplBIIa was amplified with EplBIIaKpnF and EplBIIaApaR and cloned as a KpnI-ApaI fragment into pApaH6 to make pAEplBgpgph6. the coding sequence for EplB is joined directly to a gly-pro-gly-pro-his6 linker. chromatography from 1% Elugent (Calbiochem) extracts washed with extraction buffer with 5 mM imidazole until absorbance at A280 nm returned to baseline. bound proteins were eluted with Talon buffer with 150 mM imidazole and fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE. toxin containing extracts were serially diluted in 50 l of medium in 96-well plates. seeded with 150 l of freshly harvested cells in serum-containing medium at 104 cells per well. toxin neutralization was done by incubating cell extracts for 20 minutes prior to tissue culture assay. isolates producing LT-IIa and LT-IIc encode a novel PT-like toxin closely linked to the LT-II toxin locus I previously identified the genomic locus for the first type LT-IIc2 toxin in strain 442/2. this amplicon was used to determine the complete sequence of the inverse PCR product. this produced a further 2.3 kb of sequence that, in the genome, is 5\u2032 of the novel type II toxin locus eplBA was followed by a three gene phage lysis cassette (holin-holin-lysin) the last encoded the gene previously identified as a lysin immediately 5\u2032 of the LT-IIc operon. it was possible that other LT-II isolates also encoded similar novel toxin loci. upper solid line shows insert sequenced from pCP3727. dotted line shows region sequenced by primer walking into cosmid A38. red boxes identify key conserved catalytic resides in PltA. a primer pair designed to highly conserved regions of the Q and holin genes amplified the corresponding region from the LT-IIc2 locus. the LT-IIc locus encodes a complete eplBA operon similarly located 3\u2032 of a Q-like gene. the predicted LT-IIa and LT-IIc eplBA loci encode highly related polypeptides. both eplBA and LT-IIa toxins are biologically functional and simultaneously expressed from native promoters. both eplBA loci also have predicted promoters within the 300 bp 5\u2032 proximal region that could drive transcription of the toxin loci independent of phage transcription. cosmid cell extract treated CHO cells grew in tight clusters with elongated morphology, showing both PT-like and LT-II activity. pre-incubation of extract with toxin-specific rabbit-anti-serum neutralized the toxins and resulted in monolayers that formed clusters only. morphological changes are specific to each toxin; their effects are independent of each other. enteric pathogen encodes and can simultaneously produce both types of toxins that are predicted to completely inactivate control over cAMP production in target cells. concurrent production of both toxins thus has the potential to increase disease severity by maximizing cAMP production leading to greater net fluid secretion. the EplBA and LT-II loci are encoded by a full-sized lambdoid prophage. a\u2013C and D\u2013F are from independent experiments. the rac locus was originally defined by mutations that suppressed the recombination deficiency phenotypes of recBC mutations. this data indicated that the LT-II locus is contained within a lambdoid-type prophage integrated at the same site as the the complete insert in cosmid A38 shows that it begins with 5 kb of chromosomal DNA 99% identical to the K12 chromosomal genes 5\u2032 of the rac prophage locus. following the integration site in ttcA is 30 kb of a lambdoid-type prophage inserted at the K12 rac locus. this appears to be a portion of a complete lambdoid-type prophage inserted at the K the LT-Ia Rac prophage appears largely intact and is organized in typical lambdoid manner. it has homologs of many of the genes still present in the defective Rac prophage in K12 strains. the majority of the genes in the first 9.5 kb of the prophage are encoded on the reverse strand. the last 28 kb of the prophage genome is predicted to encode mostly structural proteins for packaging DNA and forming the phage particles. the second att site creates a pseudo gene ttcC 5\u2032 of the chromosome uspF both on the reverse strand. daE 59 C 7691-7515 Rac prophage conserved 9 kilR 74 C 7906-7685 Rac inhibitor of FtsZ, killing protein 10 HPa 78 8304-8537 No CDDb match 11 HP 102 8804-8499 No CDD match 12 dicA 154 C 9517-9066 Transcriptional regulator.

LT-IIc prophages must be significantly different from LT-IIa in their right arms. five outward-directed LT-IIa-specific primers from 4 kb distal to the insertion site, down to only 170 bp 5\u2032 of the racrhsF3 positive primer, fail to give products with uspFR on any LT-IIc isolate DNA template. for comparison, there are few published studies describing Rac-like phage racrhsF3 has a partial secondary priming site 7 bp 5\u2032 of its complete match in the LT-II prophage genome. the smallest band in each lane is the primer-dimer of racrhsF3 and ttcAR primers, which is preferentially produced in the absence of functional template. the LT-IIa Rac prophage is most similar to the LT-IIa Rac prophage. a global comparison shows more than half of these two prophage genomes are 90% identical. these non-homologous regions include portions of the recombination genes, key regulatory genes, replication genes and, significantly, the morons encoding EplBA and LT-IIa toxins. no products were obtained from three LT-IIc1 subtype strains and the lone LT-IIb strain. PCR with the RacatermF primer and a reverse primer internal to eplB (EplBR) was used to determine the frequency that eplBA toxin genes are associated with their LT-II locus. the 4 LT-IIc1-c4 type strain EplB proteins are very similar. each gene encodes a polypeptide with a well-defined 21 residue signal sequence ending with canonical cleavage sites. the major differences in the predicted protein sequences is due to a variable number of repeats directly following the predicted signal sequence. isolates tested are (LT-II type and number of DVSS repeats given in parentheses) lane 1, 442/2 (IIc2, 7); 2, 357900 (IIc1, 6); 3, W517 (IIc4, 5); 4, F150 (IIc3, 4); size markers\u2014300, 200 and 75 bp, noted on left side of gel. EplB subunits divide into two main groups with either AKTG or TKRD signatures. two single residue variants are also identified, one in each group, and the two LT-IIa-specific EplB alleles are further variants of the AKTG signature. each isolate could be put into one of seven groups based on the size of the amplimer. LT-IIc5 and LT-IIc6 did not produce PCR products with RacatermF and an eplB-specific reverse primer. both LT-IIc isolates did not encode EplBA toxins but instead encoded unique alleles of a second different, but still related, two-gene ADP-ribosylating toxin operon that has a more typical A-B gene order. 99% of LT-IIa loci encoding alternative PT-like toxin (EalAB) genes differ at only 2/242 residues. ealAB-encoding loci were found in two more LT-IIc5 isolates. es were all identical and showed 99%\u2013100% amino acid identity to EalAB from LT-Iic5. the LT-IIa EalAB locus was unique and the encoded polypeptides differed from all the others. the major differences occur in the intergenic region between the end of the EalB gene and the start of the first holin gene. both toxin loci fit the definition of morons, as beneficial elements that usually have their own promoters and terminase genes. the most likely way to generate recombinants is by superinfection, of a type II ETEC isolate with a resident rac prophage, by an active toxin-encoding phage with homologous Q, holin and terminase genes. LT-II toxin is encoded by a different defective prophage remnant and does not encode a PT-like toxin within the same prophage. ealBA and ealAB loci among 50 LT-II ETEC isolates. only four isolates produced no PCR product using Q and holin primers. the LT-IIb strain does not produce a PT-like toxin. it does, however, encode a lysin gene 5\u2032 of the LT-IIb locus. this cosmid appears chimeric (more than one contiguous genomic Sau3AI fragment inserts) the 10 kb DNA fragment encompasses 5 kb of sequence 5\u2032 of the LT-IIb locus, joined to 26 kb of unlinked chromos strain 41 encodes LT-IIb (but no PT-like toxin) within a non-Rac prophage. eplBA and ealAB families predicted to encode an enzymatic (ADP-ribosyltransferase) A subunit and a ligand-binding B subunit. oxyl-terminal halves share extensive amino acid homology with the enzymatic S1 subunit of PT Fig. S5, Supporting Information. the more divergent carboxyl termini are likely a function of the need to preserve interaction with their similarly related but quite different B subunits. crystal structures are available for PltBA (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) the critical function of PltA may be coupling the CdtB toxin protein to the PltB subunit (ligand-binding component) in its unique tripartite (A2-B5) toxin complex. all other toxins with S1-like subunits are therefore likely to be functional ADP-ribosyltransferases, and like PT, modify and inactivate inhibitory G-proteins. all five B subunits show weak homology to PT-S2/S4 subunits. features conserved include cysteine pairs that in structures of PltB, SubB and PT-S2/S4 form disulfide bridges. critical ligand-binding residues also identified in Fig. S6 (Supporting Information) eplB and eplA genes are necessary and sufficient to express this novel toxin activity. essentially pure assembled EplBA holotoxin was affinity purified from cell lysates of TE1 [pAEplBgpgpH6EplA] by metal-chelate (Talon) chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. a second peak consisted of free B subunits. I cloned, expressed and purified his-tagged EalAB holotoxin. both tagged variants of EplBA and EalAB holotoxin formed stable multimeric complexes that produced the characteristic clustering phenotype. lanes 3, 4, 5 control cross-linking of CTB; lanes 6, 7, molecular size standards (in kDa); lanes 8, 9 and 10, cross-linked EplBgpgpH6. ligand-binding function for PT resides in its B subunits (Rossjohn et al. 1997). the PltB subunit was determined to be terminal galactose with N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) the structures of SubB (Byres et al. 2008), SubAB (Le Nours et al. 2013) and Typhi toxin (PltBACdtB) have nearly identical backbone folds. the more divergent PltB and PT-S2 B subunits\u2019 sugar-binding domains have glycan array has 610 unique mammalian glycans. toxins bind best to glycans with terminal gal-(2-3)-Neu5Ac. glycans with terminal gal-(2-3)-Neu5Ac also bind to glycans with terminal gal-(2-3)-Neu5Gc. Y-axis values represent the average relative fluorescence unit signal of bound toxin (200 g mL1) detected with Alexa488-labeled anti-His antibody. the schematic structure of the most relevant glycans bound (top two glycans for each subunit, first shared glycan\u2014no. 9 for EplB and no. 10 for EalB, and the second Neu5Gc-containing glycan for EalB) Gal1-4(Fuc1-3)GlcNAc1-6(Neu5Ac2-6(Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-3)Gal1-4Glc-Sp21 4 32 144 1451 0.89 Gal1-3Gal1-4Glc-Sp0 5 33 491 1319 0.81 Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-3Gal1-4GalNAc-Sp0 7 11 238 1129 0.69 Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-4GlcNAc- N-acetyl-neuraminic acid; Neu5Gc, N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid; Gal, galactose; GalNAc, N-aceytl-galacotosamine; Glc, glucose; GlcNAc, N-acetyl-glucosamine; Fuc, Fucose; Mannose, Sp, spacer (number indicates specific type) EplB and EalB bind very similar glycans despite having only 23% identity in their mature subunits. toxins bind sialated galactose residues, as do PltB (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) and SubB (Byres et al. 2008) glycans with fucosylation of the GlcNAc residue are bound with increased affinity for both toxins. both EplB and EalB bind to Neu5Ac alone, ranked no. 20 and 23, respectively. increased ability of EalB to bind Neu5Gc-containing glycans correlate with the animal origin of the majority of the EalAB-positive type II ETEC isolates. type II isolates producing LT-IIa and LT-IIc encode a novel PT-like toxin closely linked to the LT-II toxin locus I previously identified the genomic locus for the first type LT-IIc2 toxin in strain 442/2. this 4 kb amplicon was used to determine the complete sequence of the inverse PCR product. this produced a further 2.3 kb of sequence that, in the genome, the cloned sequence begins with a similar three-gene lysis cassette. it shows that the LT-IIa locus encodes a complete syntenic eplBA gene pair that are located 3\u2032 of a predicted phage antiterminator Q-gene. toxin locus linked to LT-IIa enterotoxin genes and comparison of A and B subunit polypeptides. upper solid line shows insert sequenced from pCP3727, and dotted line shows region sequenced by primer walking into cosmid A38. a primer pair designed to highly conserved regions of the Q and holin genes amplified the corresponding region from the LT-IIc2 locus. the LT-IIc locus also encodes a complete eplBA operon similarly located 3\u2032 of a Q-like gene. the predicted LT-IIa and LT-IIc eplBA loci encode highly related polypeptides. s are 97% identical, differing at only five of 229 residues, and are 53% and 27% identical to the mature PltA and PT-S1 polypeptides. both eplBA loci have predicted promoters within the 300 bp 5\u2032 proximal region that could drive transcription of the toxin loci independent of phage transcription. cosmid cell extract treated CHO cells grew in tight clusters with elongated morphology, showing both PT-like and LT-II activity. pre-incubation of extract with toxin-specific rabbit-anti-serum neutralized the toxins and resulted in monolayers that formed clusters only. morphological changes are specific to each toxin; their effects are independent of each other. enteric pathogen encodes and can simultaneously produce both types of toxins that are predicted to completely inactivate control over cAMP production in target cells. concurrent production of both toxins thus has the potential to increase disease severity by maximizing cAMP production leading to greater net fluid secretion. LT-IIa and -EplBA are encoded by a full-sized lambdoid prophage. a\u2013C and D\u2013F are from independent experiments. the eplBA and LT-II toxin loci are encoded by a full-sized lambdoid prophage. a\u2013C and D\u2013F are from independent experiments. doid-type prophage integrated at the same site as the Rac prophage in ttcA. following the integration site in ttcA is 30 kb of a lambdoid-type prophage. this appears to be a portion of a complete lambdoid-type prophage inserted at the K12 rac locus. the LT-Ia Rac prophage appears largely intact and is organized in typical lambdoid manner. it has homologs of many of the genes still present in the defective Rac prophage in K12 strains. the majority of the genes in the first 9.5 kb of the prophage are encoded on the reverse strand. the last 28 kb of the prophage genome is predicted to encode mostly structural proteins for packaging DNA and forming the phage particles. the second att site creates a pseudo gene ttcC 5\u2032 of the chromosome uspF both on the reverse strand. ydaE 59 C 7691-7515 Rac unknown function 8 kilR 74 C 7906-7685 Rac inhibitor of FtsZ killing protein 10 HPa 78 8304-8537 No CDDb match 11 HP 102 8804-8499 No CDD match 12 dicA 154 C 9517-9066 Transcriptional regulator; RacR repressor in Rac prophage 13 dicC 83 9625-9873 DicC transcription itoxin (hok starts 17873, 52 codons); Pfam 08848 28 rem 59 18353-18529 Qin K12 defective prophage no known function 29 irsA 200 18589-19188 Increased resistance to stress Salmonella phage; DUF1367 30 ybcO97 19188-19748.

LT-IIc prophages must be significantly different from LT-IIa in their right arms. five outward-directed LT-IIa-specific primers from 4 kb distal to the insertion site, down to only 170 bp 5\u2032 of the racrhsF3 positive primer, fail to give products with uspFR on any LT-IIc isolate DNA template. for comparison, there are few published studies describing Rac-like phage racrhsF3 has a partial secondary priming site 7 bp 5\u2032 of its complete match in the LT-II prophage genome. smallest band in each lane is the primer-dimer of racrhsF3 and ttcAR primers. currently no complete E. coli genomes have EplBA/EalAB and LT-II-encoding toxin prophages at the rac locus. the LT-IIa Rac prophage is most similar to the LT-IIa Rac prophage. a global comparison shows more than half of these two prophage genomes are 90% identical. these non-homologous regions include portions of the recombination genes, key regulatory genes, replication genes and, significantly, the morons encoding EplBA and LT-IIa toxins. products from all bar four of our 50 LT-II isolates were obtained. no products were obtained from three LT-IIc1 subtype strains and the lone LT-IIb strain. PCR with the RacatermF primer and a reverse primer internal to eplB was used. 4 type strains are L, E, V, D and G, respectively. each gene encodes a polypeptide with a well-defined 21 residue signal sequence ending with canonical cleavage sites. surprisingly, the major differences in the predicted protein sequences is due to a variable number of repeats directly following the predicted signal sequence. agarose gel of PCR amplimers from E. coli cells using EplBmatF and EplBR primers. isolates tested are (LT-II type and number of DVSS repeats given in parentheses) lane 1, 442/2 (IIc2, 7); 2, 357900 (IIc1, 6); 3, W517 (IIc4, 5); 4, F150 (IIc3, 4); size markers. lB amino acid sequence for isolate T5 is given in row 1, and dots show identical residues in other EplB subunits. differences from T5 are shown with a blue background, gaps in the protein sequences are shown as dashes. signal sequences are boxed. lBA-negative LT-IIc isolates encode alleles of a second novel PT-like toxin family. the type strains for LT-IIc5 and LT-IIc6 did not produce PCR products with RacatermF and an eplB-specific reverse primer. they did produce slightly smaller (2.5 versus 2.8 kb) amplicons with RactermF and RacholinR primers compared to eplBA Ic5 and LT-IIc6 are almost identical (99%), differing at only 2/242 residues. their EalB polypeptides are more divergent (84% identity) differing at 22/142 residues. identification of LT-II loci encoding alternative PT-like toxin (EalAB) genes. the IIc1v EalAB polypeptides were all identical and showed 99%\u2013100% amino acid identity to EalAB from LT-IIc5. the LT-IIa EalAB locus was unique, and the encoded polypeptides differed from all the others. the major differences between the EalAB-encoding loci occur in the intergenic region between the end of the EalB gene and the start of the first holin gene. both toxin loci fit the definition of morons, as beneficial elements that usually have their own promoters and terminase genes. the most likely way to generate recombinants is by superinfection, of a type II ETEC isolate with a resident rac prophage, by an active toxin-encoding phage with homologous Q, holin and terminase genes. LT-II toxin is encoded by a different defective prophage remnant and does not encode a PT-like toxin within the same prophage. only four isolates produced no PCR product using the Q and holin gene-specific primers. LT-IIc1 isolates were negative by PCR with Q-holin primers. 1 carrying the cosmid clone, D27, showed clustering activity on CHO cells, indicating that the LT-IIb strain does not produce a PT-like toxin. it does, however, encode a lysin gene 5\u2032 of the LT-IIb locus. this cosmid appears chimeric (more than one contiguous genomic Sau3AI fragment inserts), and has a 10 kb Sau3AI fragment encoding strain 41 encodes LT-IIb (but no PT-like toxin) within a non-Rac prophage. eplBA, ealAB and other PT-like toxins predicted to encode an enzymatic (ADP-ribosyltransferase) more conserved amino-terminal regions and more variable carboxyl-terminal halves. the more divergent carboxyl termini are likely a function of the need to preserve interaction with their similarly related but quite different B subunits. crystal structures are available for PltBA (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) the critical function of PltA may be coupling the CdtB toxin protein to the PltB subunit (ligand-binding component) in its unique tripartite (A2-B5) toxin complex. all other toxins with S1-like subunits are therefore likely to be functional ADP-ribosyltransferases, and like PT, modify and inactivate inhibitory G-proteins. all five B subunits show weak homology to PT-S2/S4 subunits. features conserved include cysteine pairs that in structures of PltB, SubB and PT-S2/S4 form disulfide bridges. critical ligand-binding residues also identified in Fig. S6 (Supporting Information) both eplB and eplA genes are necessary and sufficient to express this novel toxin activity. I appended a 6-his tag with a (gly-pro)2-encoding linker to the carboxyl terminus of EplB. expressed this gene as an operon with native eplA. I cloned, expressed and purified his-tagged EalAB holotoxin. tagged variants of EplBA and EalAB holotoxin formed stable multimeric complexes that produced the characteristic clustering phenotype when added to CHO cells. lanes 3, 4, 5 control cross-linking of CTB; lanes 6, 7, molecular size standards (in kDa); lanes 8, 9 and 10 cross-linked EplBgpgpH6. ligand-binding function for PT resides in its B subunits (Rossjohn et al. 1997). the preferential glycan recognized by the PltB subunit was determined (Song, Gao and Galan 2013) to be terminal galactose with (2-3)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) the structures of SubB (Byres et al. 2008), SubAB (Le Nours et al. 2013) and Typhi toxin (PltBACdtB) have nearly identical backbone folds. glycan array has 610 unique mammalian glycans. toxins bind best to glycans with terminal gal-(2-3)-Neu5Ac. sialated glycoproteins are functional ligands for EplBA and EalAB toxins. y-axis values represent the average relative fluorescence unit signal of bound toxin (200 g mL1) detected with Alexa488-labeled anti-His antibody. the schematic structure of the most relevant glycans bound (top two glycans for each subunit) is shown beneath the panels.
