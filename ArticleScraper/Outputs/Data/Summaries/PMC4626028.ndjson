{"summary": "high mortality and historical case fatality rates have stoked public panic. lack of available clinical and public health expertise has led the media to turn to infectious disease scientists for information. a small subset of information presented to news sources has fanned flames of panic among the public, government officials, and policy makers. studies have examined the mutation rate of the outbreak and determined that the current strains do not have increased rates of mutation compared to previous outbreaks. the current strains do not have increased rates of mutation compared to previous outbreaks and that these mutations have no apparent effect on virulence. to date, there have been no studies conclusively demonstrating EBOV aerosol transmission. a key claim of theirs does not entail conclusive evidence of novel transmission. a self-report of contact history can be unreliable. john avlon: Managing uncertainty Matters of uncertainty is fraught for scientific communication. he says low probability events are likely to cause confusion and panic. avlon: it's a tacit endorsement that an event won't happen. avlon: scientists generate claims that are probabilistic in nature. the current EBOV outbreak has not threatened the target audience of these opinions (e.g., United States, Canada, and Mexico), thus limiting the political will to engage in expensive or controversial public health practices. the impact of an airborne EBOV on public health and clinical medicine drastically changes health care and public health interventions. the potential impact of the Ebola virus transmission articles is illustrated by the public panic. it is up to the scientific community as whole to ensure that science drives discussions of emerging infectious disease and outbreak management in the future."}
