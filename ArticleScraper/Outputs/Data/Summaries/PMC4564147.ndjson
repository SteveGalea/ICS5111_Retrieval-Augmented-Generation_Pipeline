{"summary": "an agro-infiltration method previously described by English et al. (1997) has been applied for PVX infection to Nicotiana benthamiana. after two or three weeks, the treated-leaves were collected from healthy and diseased plants. dNTPs from 0.2 to 1.4 mM, FIP and BIP (inner primers) from 20 to 40 pmole, and F3 and B3 (outer primers) from 5 to 10 pmole. real-time monitoring RT-LAMP amplification was spectrophotometrically monitored by recording optical density at 400 nm. primer design Primer sets were designed from the coat protein (CP) gene of PVX. three primer sets were designed using Primer Explorer V4 (Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan) and the other three primer sets were designed using Lamp Designer (Premier Biosoft, USA) RT-PCR products were incubated at 45\u00b0C for 30 min and denatured at 94\u00b0C for 5 min. mixture was incubated at 45\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 50.7\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec. primer sets A, C, and F showed ladder-like bands on the agarose gel only for the PVX RNA containing samples. agarose gel showed ladder-like bands on the agarose gel. but not rom RT-LAMP products of RNAs from healthy plant leaves. RT-LAMP reactions were carried out using gradient PCR setting the temperature range from 56\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C. RT-LAMP products by gradient PCR. M, molecular size marker; (), without RNA. electrophoresis results of the effects of different primer concentrations on RT-LAMP. positive tubes emitted bright fluorescent light, but negative samples showed dim or no fluorescent light. RT-LAMP amplification products could be visualized when 2 g to 0.02 ng of PVX RNA was used as the template. no products were visualized when 0.02 ng of PVX RNA was used. primer set A was selected and used for RT-LAMP PCR. RT-LAMP reactions were carried out using gradient PCR setting temperature range from 56\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C. dNTPs and outer (F3 and B3) and inner (FIP and BIP) primers were also generated. a similar amount of RT-LAMP products was obtained regardless of the concentrations of outer primers (F3 and B3). the concentrations of FIP and BIP were more effective than those of outer primers (F3 and B3). RT-LAMP amplification products were visualized using fluorescent dyes under ambient light or UV light. positive tubes emitted bright fluorescent light, but negative samples showed dim or no fluorescent light. no products were visualized when 0.02 ng of PVX RNA was used as the template. ELISA methods have drawbacks such as long reaction time, less specificity caused by cross reactivity, fewer antibodies available, and less sensitivity. molecular-based assays are known to have higher sensitivity, but RT-PCR-based assays may remedy additional defects of ELISA. only one primer set (set A) was selected based on its specificity (Fig. S1 and S2) and sensitivity (Fig. 2) for highly successful detection of PVX. sensitivity for detecting Classical swine fever virus is slightly lower for RT-PCR compared to RT-LAMP. the optimum temperature of the RT-LAMP to detect PVX seemed to range from 59 to 69.1\u00b0C. this might be because of inactivation of enzymes or reaction instability caused by too high or low temperatures. different target genes may require different concentrations of dNTPs when amplified by LAMP-based methods. many other applications for diagnostic purposes."}
