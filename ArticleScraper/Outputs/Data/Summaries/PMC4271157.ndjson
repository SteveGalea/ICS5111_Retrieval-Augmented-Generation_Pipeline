{"summary": "toV infections are generally asymptomatic, but sometimes they can cause severe diarrhea when concurrent infections occur with other enteric pathogens (1, 3\u20135). there is no in vitro system to grow PToV, there is very little information known about the virus. the polyprotein-encoding open reading frame (ORF1ab) was identified from nucleotides 794 to 20910 and encoded a replicase of 4,418 amino acids. the spike protein-encoding gene from PToV-NPL/2013 showed only 92% identity to that of PToV-SH1, suggesting that the S gene of PToV circulating in the united states is slightly different from the isolates circulating in China. complete genome sequence of PToV-NPL/2013 deposited in GenBank. accession number KM403390."}
