{"summary": "microorganisms on hospital surfaces can be transmitted to the hands of healthcare workers, patients, and visitors, resulting in cross-infections and epidemics. in recent decades, many polymeric surfactant products have been shown to have excellent antimicrobial properties against surface contamination. however, none have been tested on hospital surfaces. the prevalence of hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) infection varies geographically. Hong Kong is one of the high-prevalence areas in Asia [17] there has been no epidemiological study on surface MRSA-related contamination in the general wards of Hong Kong hospitals. a field experimental study was designed to assess the degree of staphylococcal contamination on the bedside surfaces of a medical ward. the ward was occupied by an MRSA-positive patient for 24 h. swabbing was performed at three random spots of each sampling surface. a total of 12 swab specimens (three samples per site four spots) were collected from each bed-unit. a total of 864 swab specimens were collected from the designated site surfaces. the decontamination property of the JUC polymer was evaluated on the same designated sites of the bed-units used for the staphylococcal assessment. the experimental arm tested the JUC spray plus the routine daily cleaning. swabbed specimens were collected at 08:00 hours as the baseline. the control arm tested the routine daily cleaning alone. the demographic characteristics of the patients occupying the bed-units, including their MRSA status, are summarized in Table 1. a total of 18 patients were involved in each arm of the study. each swab sample was collected from a surface area of 10 cm2. the minimum detection limit of the sampling technique was defined as 1 cfu/cm2. positive growth on the plates was followed up using the coagulase test. the experimental procedure was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the study hospital. it involved only the environmental surfaces around the bed-units inside a ward cubicle, where neither patients nor ward staff were involved. at admission, the MRSA status of the patients was confirmed according to the patients\u2019 history and information provided by the hospital infections control team. swabbing was performed at three random spots of each sampling surface. a total of 12 swab specimens (three samples per site four spots) were collected from each bed-unit. the swabbed specimens were inoculated into vials containing 1 mL of sterile water and transferred to PetrifilmTM Count Plates (3M, St. Paul, MN, USA) the degree of contamination in the bed-units occupied by MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients was compared. the hypochlorite solution was freshly prepared according to hospital guidelines by a duty healthcare worker. the experimental arm tested the JUC spray plus the routine daily cleaning. the control arm tested the routine daily cleaning alone. the swabbed specimens were collected at 08:00 hours as the baseline. the demographic characteristics of the patients occupying the bed-units, including their MRSA status, are summarized in Table 1. a total of 18 patients were involved in each arm of the study. each swab sample was collected from a 10 cm2 surface area. the minimum detection limit of the sampling technique was defined as 1 cfu/cm2. positive growth on the plates was followed up using the coagulase test. positive staphylococcal growth was recovered from 83% (five out of six) and 77% (23 out of 30) of the bedside surfaces occupied by MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients. 108 swabs from each bed-unit were collected at 08:00 hours. CNS, MSSA, and MRSA were recovered from 44%, 28%, and 56% of all bed-units sampled. the mean CNS concentrations in the bed-units of the MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients were 1.9 cfu/cm2 and 1.6 cfu/cm2 respectively. all CPS isolates were revealed to be oxacillin resistant with an overall burden of 3.9 cfu/cm2. a total of 36 bed-units were sampled in 6 separate days at 08:00 hours. the studied cubicle was fully occupied in all those days. only one MRSA-positive patient was included in each sampling day. some of the mean cfu/cm2 values presented in this table were smaller than the detection limit as influenced by a large number of 0 (non-detectable) values. the decrease in staphylococcal concentrations recovered from the bedside surfaces irrespective of the patients\u2019 MRSA status (n = 36) the same trend was observed in the bed-units of MRSA-positive and negative patients. however, the increase in staphylococcal contamination was approximately four times that in the MRSA-positive bed-units. the surface of the left-side handrail was found to have an MRSA concentration 11-fold significantly (p 0.05) higher than that of the right-side handrail. bed-units showed a positive growth in staphylococcal bacteria according to the staphylococcal types recovered from the specimens collected four hours after the application of JUC spray. a total of 18 bed-units were studied for each arm. a large number (about 80%) of bedside surfaces was contaminated. oxacillin resistance was prevalent, occurring around the beds of MRSA-positive patients. the results reflected the natural contamination within the ward. the most clinically important CNS causing nosocomial infections is known to be Staphylococcal epidermidis. the most clinically important CNS causing nosocomial infections is known to be Staphylococcal epidermidis, which is frequently sourced from the skin normal flora of patients and healthcare workers. a local study reported on the failure of disinfection efforts using hypochlorite wiping by demonstrating the presence of MRSA in bedside rails after hypochlorite wiping. a possible cause was the failure to thoroughly rinse the wipe, as suggested by the presence of bacteria in the wipe before wiping was carried out. occus aureus, Treponena pallidum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Gonococcus, Colibacillus, Candida albicans, and SARS coronavirus have long-lasting antimicrobial activity. the manufacturer has claimed its antimicrobial properties last for eight hours, which requires further confirmation. the lethal dose 50 (LD50) was determined as >10,000 mg/kg, which is essentially non-toxic. a large number (about 80%) of bedside surfaces was contaminated. oxacillin resistance was prevalent, occurring at one hour and five hours after a hypochlorite wiping. surface MRSA contamination was commonly reported in bed-units or rooms occupied by MRSA-positive patients. a sophisticated genotyping analysis is needed to confirm that the MRSA isolates were shed from the MRSA-positive patients and dispersed within the ward. the activities of the nursing station might also be a potential source of heterogeneous contamination. however, such activities would be considered part of the natural ward environment. hypochlorite disinfectants are well known for being able to eliminate a wide spectrum of bacteria, including MRSA. the current results show the drawbacks of relying on hypochlorite wipes to decontaminate hospital environments. a local study reported on the failure of disinfection efforts using hypochlorite wiping. in vitro cytotoxicity ranging from 99 to 100 percent has been tested on pathogenic microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Treponena pallidum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Gonococcus, Colibacillus, Candida albicans, and SARS coronavirus. the results suggest that the JUC polymer has a long-lasting antimicrobial activity of at least four hours after application. the antimicrobial activity of JUC coating should be tested against other important organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and multidrug resistant (MDR) gram-negative organisms. such surface treatment should be abandoned if the MDR gram-negatives appear and cause problem for patients. this is the first study that has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of JUC spray as an enhanced surfactant disinfectant."}
