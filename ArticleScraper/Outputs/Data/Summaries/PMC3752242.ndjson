{"summary": "TLR7 and RIG-I signaling mediates protection against lethal IAV challenge. we first investigated virus replication in cells deficient in TLR7, MAVS, or both. compared with mice with a lethal dose of PR8 NS1-GFP virus. avs/ mice showed enhanced recruitment of monocyte-derived DCs in the lung. the Tlr7/Mavs/ mice lost significantly more weight than WT mice at 2 and 3 dpi. but succumbed to infection, both with respect to weight loss and mortality. ckout mice harbored significantly lower pulmonary viral titers in the airway at 4 and 9 dpi compared with WT mice. no obvious difference in pathology observed between the infected WT and Tlr7/Mavs/ mice. impaired, but not enhanced, antibody responses to IAV have been observed in infected Tlr7/ and Myd88/ mice (13, 16). however, we focused on the innate-immune mechanism in Tlr7/Mavs/ mice that confer resistance to a sublethal dose of respiratory IAV infection. Tlr7/Mavs/ mice sustained a lower pulmonary viral titer throughout the course of infection. expression of TLR7- and RIG-I/MAVS induces redundant pathways in promoting replication and spread of IAV in the airway. VS in hematopoietic compartment promotes respiratory influenza virus infection in vivo. WT, WTTlr7/Mavs/, Tlr7/Mavs/WT and BM chimeric mice were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose (10 pfu) of A/PR8 influenza virus. mavs/ mice receiving BAL from infected WT mice showed increased number of cellular infiltrates into the airway compared with untreated Tlr7/Mavs/ mice 4 d after influenza virus infection. inflammatory factors released into the airway of WT infected mice were sufficient to restore viral replication in the Tlr7/Mavs/ mice. UV-irradiated BAL harvested from IAV-infected Tlr7/Mavs/ mice was applied intranasally to WT recipients 24 h before a sublethal dose of respiratory IAV challenge. at 4 dpi, the number of cellular infiltrates in the airway and the level of pulmonary viral titer remained similar between WT mice receiving BAL from Tlr7/Mavs/ mice and their untreated y6c+Ly6GCD11cint were severely reduced in the airway of Tlr7/Mavs/ mice at 4 dpi. in contrast, the frequency of infiltrated CD11b+Ly6CloLy6G+ neutrophils was higher in Tlr7/Mavs/ mice than in WT mice. this indicates that there was no general deficiency in the recruitment of all leukocyte subsets in the recruited CD11b+Ly6c+CD11c+ monocyte-derived DC population was the predominant infected cell type in the lung of WT mice. notably, the infected inflammatory monocytes, as well as other cell types being infected with IAV in WT mice, were missing in the IAV-challenged Tlr7/Mavs/ mice. TLR7 and RIG-I signaling mediates protection against lethal IAV challenge. we first investigated virus replication in cells deficient in TLR7, MAVS, or both. ected mice, Tlr7/Mavs/ mice showed enhanced recruitment of monocyte-derived DCs in the lung. infected monocyte-derived DCs accounted for the main difference between the WT and Tlr7/Mavs/ mice. Tlr7/Mavs/ mice harbored significantly lower pulmonary viral titers in the airway at 4 and 9 dpi compared with WT mice. NP+ cells lining the airways of Tlr7/Mavs/ mice were more sparsely distributed six days after 10 pfu of A/PR8 influenza virus challenge. Tlr7/Mavs/ but not Mavs/ or Tlr7/ mice are resistant to a sublethal dose of respiratory IAV infection. Tlr7/Mavs/ mice were infected intranasally with 10 pfu of A/PR8 influenza virus. BM chimeric mice were challenged with a sublethal dose of PR8 influenza virus. pulmonary viral titers were similar between WTWT mice and WTTlr7/Mavs/ mice. BM chimeric mice were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose (10 pfu) of A/PR8 influenza virus (A) soluble factors released into the airway of WT mice in response to IAV infection support viral replication. Tlr7/Mavs/ mice receiving BAL from infected WT mice showed increased number of cellular infiltrates into the airway compared with untreated Tlr7/Mavs/ mice 4 d after influenza virus infection. notably, viral titers in the Tlr7/Mavs/ mice treated with BAL from infected WT mice were restored to the level of WT mice. UV-irradiated BAL harvested from IAV-infected mice was applied intranasally to WT recipients 24 h before a sublethal dose of respiratory IAV challenge. at 4 dpi, the number of cellular infiltrates in the airway and the level of pulmonary viral titer remained similar between WT mice receiving BAL from Tlr7/Mavs/ mice and their untreated WT counterparts. ocyte-derived DCs (CD11b+Ly6c+Ly6GCD11cint) were severely reduced in the airway of Tlr7/Mavs/ mice at 4 dpi. in contrast, the frequency of infiltrated CD11b+Ly6CloLy6G+ neutrophils was higher in Tlr7/Mavs/ mice than in WT mice. this indicates that there was no general deficiency the recruited CD11b+Ly6c+CD11c+ monocyte-derived DC population was the predominant infected cell type in the lung of WT mice. notably, the infected inflammatory monocytes, as well as other cell types being infected with IAV in WT mice, were missing in the IAV-challenged Tlr7/Mavs/ mice. a sublethal dose of virus challenge in Tlr7/Mavs/ mice unexpectedly resulted in significantly lower viral titers. the apparent resistance to IAV replication in Tlr7/Mavs/ mice was associated with diminished proinflammatory cytokine and IFN production. the recruitment of large number of leukocytes provides a target of virus infection in the respiratory tract. previous studies have shown that IAV are able to infect both nonimmune (such as tracheal epithelial cells) and immune cells in the respiratory tract. studies are needed to decipher what triggers the switch between TLR7/MAVS-dependent vs. TLR7/MAVS-independent modes of monocyte recruitment. the study highlights the importance of evaluating host\u2013virus interaction at a physiological viral challenge dose to reveal mechanisms that are otherwise obscured at high lethal doses of infection. treatment with IFNs increases susceptibility of monocyte to infections by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by up-regulating monocyte expression of the porcine Arterivirus receptor sialoadhesin (35). also, TNF- production by macrophages infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus, a (+)ssRNA feline coronavirus, increases expression of receptor, feline aminopeptidase N, for feline infectious peritonitis virus entry. all KO mice had been backcrossed at least nine generations onto the C57BL/6 background. all procedures used in this study were approved by the Yale Animal Care and Use Committee. single-cell suspensions of lung samples were prepared as previously described. for staining, fluorochrome-labeled anti-CD8 (53-6.7), anti-CD4 (RM4-5), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-Ly6G (1A8), anti-F4/80 (BM8), and anti-CD45 (30-F11) antibodies were from BioLegend. BMDCs prepared as described earlier (18) were incubated with indicated multiplicity of infections of PR8 NS1-GFP influenza virus in 100 L per well of 0.1% BSA PBS at 5 105 cells/well. cells were harvested and stained with live/dead fixable aqua stain (Invitrogen) and antibodies against CD11c and MHC-II. FITC-conjugated anti-influenza A NP monoclonal antibody (Pierce antibodies) was applied at 1:10 for 1.5 h at room temperature. slides were washed and incubated with DAPI (Molecular Probes) and mounted with Fluoromount-G. mice were fully anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine and then infected by intranasal application of 20 L of virus suspension (10\u2013100 pfu of A/PR8 or 1 106 pfu of PR8 NS1-GFP in PBS, as indicated) this procedure leads to the upper and lower respiratory tract infection. 2 antibody (1:600) for 30 min on ice, followed by secondary staining with a Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) for 20 min on ice. live cells were gated based on forward and side scatter properties. in the lung, alveolar macrophages were excluded from FACS gating. virus in the samples were inactivated by exposure to 1 J/cm2 UV light three times with Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene) samples were concentrated using amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units (Millipore) and 30\u201340 L were injected intranasally into four to five mice per group. 10__index.html (7.3KB, html)."}
