{"summary": "the internet has dramatically changed the availability of information about outbreaks. but little research has been done in comparing professional and public online information needs around major infection outbreaks and correlate these with media coverage. the internet has dramatically changed the availability of information about outbreaks. meningitis was a clear example of a disease with heightened media coverage tending to focus on individual and celebrity cases. in 2009, there was no corresponding increase in media coverage. norovirus showed online public and professional interest correlating with seasonal occurrences of the disease. in the internet era professionals and the public increasingly use online resources to meet their information needs and seek up-to-date evidence. media coverage of infection outbreaks, public health issues, and media-mediated risk advice is increasingly influencing public perceptions and often distorting health critical information. a number of studies have investigated health care professionals\u2019 online information seeking behavior. a number of studies have investigated health care professionals\u2019 online information seeking behavior. a number of studies have investigated health care professionals\u2019 online information seeking behavior. media coverage of disease outbreaks may be exaggerated due to certain needs. some parents refused to have their children vaccinated with the combined MMR vaccine. media coverage can be distorted, giving extra attention to stories about health concerns that have little real impact, while largely ignoring those that cause much more harm. 80% of the general public and a comparable proportion of medical professionals access information via the internet. the last decade witnessed turbulent events in the domain of infectious diseases and public health. media coverage of infection outbreaks, public health issues and media-mediated risk advice is increasingly influencing public perceptions. 53% of the population in the u.s. use the Internet daily, with 69% having a broadband connection. a study by seybert in 2011 found that 54% of EU Internet users used the Internet to look for health-related information. alghanim et al surveyed information seeking behavior of primary health care physicians in saudi arabia. half of rural physicians used online databases and general websites to find information, rising to over 70% for urban physicians. public health and infection is one of the most varied domains of medicine. media coverage can also help to limit an outbreak, by causing individuals who are susceptible to the disease to isolate themselves from infected individuals. the 2009 swine flu outbreak was a health event covered extensively by the mass media and with an impact investigated by research studies. this unique dataset reflects the levels of interest in the topics by the general public who seek health care information online on Google. the number of news articles retrieved from the LexisNexis database, concerning same topics as were used for the other datasets. the timeframe of the study was from week 31 (end of July) 2006 until the end of 2010, which is the period for which we have NeLI/NRIC data. the dataset 1: professional information user needs is hard to determine the information needs of health care professionals. reviewer's assessments are attached to documents within the library. a key benefit of NeLI/NRIC is that reviewer's assessments are attached to documents within the library. each review is signed by the reviewer and may be commented on by registered users. each log entry contains details of an HTTP request sent from a Web browser to the Web server, including the date of each request, the IP address of the visitor, the page requested, and other data. a sample log entry for a Web access to NeLI is annotated with the meanings of the available fields. all the content of the evidence-based library is in the public domain and free to use. users can join the subscription list either personally at a conference, at a study day where NeLI/NRIC is presented or online at a dedicated subscription page. the subscription database holds details for over 3500 NeLI/NRIC users. dataset 3: media coverage of infection outbreaks\u2014News articles from LexisNexis. results can be saved as a text list, from which the dates of the articles can be extracted. spam is created by automated programs that generate Web log entries with the referrer site field set to a specific Web address. this is intended to generate free advertising if the weblogs are made available online. the logs were pre-processed with the following steps: all entries with an IP address in a list of developer IPs were removed. search was much more commonly performed than searching (93% of the total) [34]. autocomplete function (which suggests keywords after the user has typed a few characters) was used. finding information on NeLI/NRIC can be achieved either by using an external search engine or an internal search on the NeLI/NRIC site. avian influenza, or \u201cbird flu\u201d, and swine influenza, or \u201cswine flu\u201d have been widely covered by the media. we found totals for \u201cinfluenza\u201d as a whole. this dataset reflects the levels of interest in the topics by the general public who seek health care information online on Google. the numbers of news articles retrieved from the LexisNexis database, concerning the same topics as were used for the other datasets. the timeframe of the study was from week 31 (end of July) 2006 until the end of 2010. the other datasets (Google Trends data and LexisNexis news article data) also cover this period. reviewer's assessments (RAs) are attached to documents within the library. they provide a short summary of what the document is about. each review is signed by the reviewer and may be commented on by registered users. visitors can only determine which page they browsed before arriving at NeLI/NRIC. the site had over 5000 unique users per month in 2011. the number of visitors and page views for NeLI/NRIC between 2006 and 2011 has declined. the breakdowns of professions and specialities are detailed in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 in Multimedia Appendix 1. the breakdowns of professions and specialities are detailed in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 in Multimedia Appendix 1. dataset 3: Media Coverage of Infection Outbreaks\u2014News Articles From LexisNexis The third dataset, measuring media coverage of specific topics, is the newspaper articles retrieved from the LexisNexis database [30]. reviewer's assessments (RAs) are attached to documents within the library. each review is signed by the reviewer and may be commented on by registered users. documents can be found by searches (either simple keyword search or more complicated searches with Boolean operators) the site had over 5000 unique users per month in 2011 and between 20,000 and 30,000 page views (Figure 4). from 2006 to 2008, NeLI/NRIC was heavily promoted at conferences and other events, seemingly leading to an increase in visitor numbers. NeLI/NRIC users The portals are aimed at health care professionals with interests in infection. the site had over 5000 unique users per month in 2011. from 2006 to 2008, the site was heavily promoted at conferences. database holds details for over 3500 NeLI/NRIC users. the breakdowns of professions and specialities are detailed in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 in Multimedia Appendix 1. Google Users Google is currently the most commonly used search engine worldwide, with 90% of the market share globally, and 80% in the united states, according to StatCounter Global Stats [29]. referrer site field set to a specific Web address was removed. the browser type field was examined and those that did not correspond to common Web browsers were removed. the previous step still left a large number of entries that were clearly produced by Web crawlers. we concentrated on category browsing and document views, as (1) browsing was much more commonly performed than searching (93% of the total) [34], (2) factors such as misspellings, synonyms, and complex search phrases make analysis of search terms much more complicated, and finally (3) for advanced keyword searches, an autocomplete function was used. search results for partial words are also recorded in the logs. the results can be achieved either by using a search from an external search engine or by an internal search on the NeLI/NRIC site. avian influenza, or \u201cbird flu\u201d, and swine influenza, or \u201cswine flu\u201d) were analyzed using the same search terms as the results used for the Google Trends results. a similarity measure was set to \u201cOn, high similarity\u201d to exclude duplicate articles. the articles were sorted by date and counted to give weekly totals. the last decade has been eventful in the domain of infectious disease. there have been periods of emerging infections (SARS), epidemic outbreaks (avian flu), a pandemic (swine flu in 2009) and recurring outbreaks for common infections (influenza, MRSA) we evaluated the 3 datasets to try to understand the correlations. figures show levels of professional interest (measured by numbers of NeLI/NRIC accesses of the Clostridium difficile and MRSA taxonomy pages) the public and professional interest (measured by comparative frequencies of Google searches for the terms \u201cClostridium difficile\u201d and \u201cMRSA\u201d) is \u201cnoisier\u201d (have a higher variance) than the Google Trends data. there are periods of increased activity early in the second half of 2006 and in the first half of 2010. it is likely that the increased activity in 2006 is due to the high levels of promotional activities for the newly relaunched NeLI/NRIC sites. more evidence for this comes from comparing the graphs in later sections, which show a similar pattern. heightened media coverage in late 2007 over the Healthcare Commission report had a correlation to professionals\u2019 needs. heightened media coverage in late 2007 had a correlation to professionals\u2019 needs, who were likely to access the report but around 3 times rather than 6 times more frequently than the baseline. the most accessed page for the Knowledge Week was a special front page that was not counted in our analysis of searches for the disease. this shows up as a peak (3.2 times baseline) in week 26 of 2007, following a public interest peak (2.8 times baseline), a professional interest peak (4.2 times) in week 22 and a media peak (5.7 times) in week 23. media coverage peaks in mid-2007 (5.7 times baseline), mid-2008 (1.9 times baseline) and late 2008 (about a successful human windpipe transplant) there are peaks each year from 2007-2010 (2.5, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.1 times the baseline, respectively) the four largest peaks are in week 20, 2007 (3.0 times baseline) in week 39, 2007 (2.5 times baseline), with stories about an individual boy\u2019s death and others about a boy who changed his accent after surgery for meningitis. there is a clear seasonal trend to the professional and public interest and media coverage. professional interest tends to mirror public interest, except for heightened activity in late 2009 and early 2010 (up to 8.2 times baseline) this extra activity is due to publication of the HPA\u2019s guideline \u201cNorovirus outbreak reporting scheme\u201d in December 2009. new strains and variants of the influenza virus are constantly emerging. new strains and variants of the virus are constantly emerging. the terms \"avian influenza\" and \"swine influenza\" refer to influenza viruses found in birds and swine. the interest in this disease on NeLI/NRIC has shown to be lower as seasonal influenza does not require regular and more specialized evidence. otherwise there was constant public interest in the disease while professionals had several spikes mostly in winter months indicating an increased information need around seasonal influenza. public interest peaks in week 17 of 2009, while the peak in media coverage followed in week 18. the difference of one week is probably not significant here, as the process of collating results into weekly totals will have some uncertainties. heightened media interest in these weeks related to the outbreak in Mexico. public interest during the autumn second peak of the disease was 5.7 times smaller than during the April peak, but is clearly visible in Figure 16. the public and professional interest, and media coverage for Clostridium difficile and MRSA are measured weekly and normalized. the average monthly global number of searches for the phrase \"what. the maximum level of professional interest occurs at week 43 in 2007. the professional interest level at this peak was 2.6 times the baseline level. there are periods of increased activity early in the second half of 2006 and in the first half of 2010. the healthcare commission attributed the deaths of 90 patients at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals in Kent to infection from C difficile, which causes severe diarrhoea. heightened media coverage in late 2007 had a correlation to professionals\u2019 needs, who were likely to access the report but around 3 times rather than 6 times more frequently than the baseline. the public and professional interest is \u201cnoisier\u201d than the Google Trends data. the average monthly global number of searches for the phrase \u201cwhat is C diff\u201d was 368,000. the maximum level of professional interest occurs at week 43 in 2007. the professional interest level at this peak coincided with the maximum levels of public interest and media coverage. there are periods of increased activity early in the second half of 2006 and in the first half of 2010. the healthcare commission attributed the deaths of 90 patients at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals in Kent to infection from C difficile, which causes severe diarrhoea. heightened media coverage in late 2007 had a correlation to professionals\u2019 needs, who were likely to access the report but around 3 times rather than 6 times more frequently than the baseline. a tuberculosis \u201cKnowledge Week\u201d was held on NeLI/NRIC in conjunction with the HPA from March 26-30, 2007, to provide health care professionals with quick and easily accessible up-to-date knowledge on the disease. the most accessed page for the Knowledge Week was a special front page that was not counted in our analysis of searches for the disease. media coverage peaks in mid-2007 (5.7 times baseline), mid-2008 (1.9 times baseline) and late 2008 (about a successful human windpipe transplant) there are peaks each year from 2007-2010 (2.5, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.1 times the baseline), respectively. TB is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. the overall level of professional interest appears from the graph to be declining, although this may be misleading. a tuberculosis \u201cKnowledge Week\u201d was held on NeLI/NRIC in conjunction with the HPA from March 26-30, 2007, to provide health care professionals with quick and easily accessible up-to-date knowledge. the highest level in public interest occurred in may 2007 (week 21, 2.8 times baseline), which seems to be related to a story concerning a US citizen infected with TB who took a flight to Europe. the yearly dip in interest at the end of each year is also evident. professional interest Professional interest was heightened in the years 2006 and 2007 but has declined since then. some of this decline can be explained as due to enhanced levels of interest when the NeLI/NRIC sites were relaunched in 2006. the four largest peaks are in week 20, 2007 (3.0 times baseline), with the main focus on the singer who contracted meningitis. in week 39, 2007 (2.5 times baseline), with stories about an individual boy\u2019s death and others about a boy who changed his accent after surgery for meningitis. there is a small peak in interest at the time of publication. there is a large peak in the next (full) week, and then a gradual decline. professional interest tends to mirror public interest, except for heightened activity in late 2009 and early 2010 (up to 8.2 times baseline) the public interest levels are also biased towards the northern hemisphere. it is not surprising that they closely match data for the actual occurrence of the disease. there is clearly a close correspondence with the graphs of Figure 11. peak is due, in part, to the document being published near the end of that week, followed by a large peak in the next (full) week. peak is due, in part at least, to the document being published near the end of that week, followed by a large peak in the next (full) week, and then a gradual decline. new strains and variants of the influenza virus are constantly emerging. new strains and variants of the virus are constantly emerging. the terms \"avian

totals will have some uncertainties. heightened media interest in these weeks related to the outbreak in Mexico. public interest during the autumn second peak of the disease was 5.7 times smaller than during the April peak, but is clearly visible in Figure 16. interest in the disease on NeLI/NRIC has shown to be lower as seasonal influenza does not require regular and more specialized evidence. results figure 15 shows the professional interest, public interest, and media coverage for \u201cinfluenza\u201d. public interest in the disease peaks in week 17 of 2009, while the peak in media coverage followed in week 18. the difference of one week is probably not significant here, as the process of collating results into weekly totals will have some uncertainties. second peak of the disease was 5.7 times smaller than during the April peak, but is clearly visible in Figure 16. we compared these with media coverage to illustrate where the media interest could have fueled public interest in the disease and what the reaction was of professionals to key outbreaks and policy changes. meningitis was a clear example of a disease that has a heightened media coverage that tends to focus on individual tragic cases and celebrity stories (RQ2). an exception was norovirus, which showed a seasonal pattern for both groups and matched the periodic disease occurrence (RQ3) we have assumed that a majority of NeLI/NRIC users are health care professionals, compared to Google searches. so we assume that NeLI/NRIC accesses better reflect the interests of health care professionals, whereas Google searches reflect the interests of the wider public. this assumption is reasonable, as (1) the websites are designed to provide specialist information targeted and promoted at infection professionals. internet has revolutionized the way we seek up-to-date evidence and information for public during major infection events and outbreaks. compared professional and public online information needs around major infection events and outbreaks over the period from mid-2006 to the end of 2010. we have analyzed the information needs of public and professionals around key infectious disease outbreaks and events in the 4.5 years from the end of July 2006, until the end of 2010. we compared these with media coverage to illustrate where the media interest could have fueled public interest in the disease and what the reaction was of professionals to key outbreaks. professionals\u2019 interest did not follow media coverage, but spikes occurred during outbreaks (MRSA, C difficile) release of major national policy or important document (RQ1). an exception was norovirus, which showed a seasonal pattern for both groups and matched the periodic disease occurrence (RQ3) we have assumed that a majority of NeLI/NRIC users are health care professionals, compared to Google searches. so we assume that NeLI/NRIC accesses better reflect the interests of health care professionals, whereas Google searches reflect the interests of the wider public. users did what they did on the site and whether they were dissatisfied with the results [21]. the role of online media with increasing coverage of public health events has contributed to the demand for information."}
