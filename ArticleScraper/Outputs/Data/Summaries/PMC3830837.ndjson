{"summary": "the 11 kb genome of CHPV [5] is encapsidated by nucleocapsid (N) protein and serves as a template for both replication and transcription. the transcription of the genome by viral encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; L protein) produces five capped and polyadenylated mRNAs which code for five proteins nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M structures of CHPV N and M proteins were generated by homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL workspace, G protein using I-TASSER, and P protein using a modified abinitio method. the involvement of N protein fragments in interactions of N with N, P, and G proteins was predicted using ZDOCK rigid-body docking method. the structure of CHPV G protein in its perfusion state (530 aa) was generated using I-TASSER [15, 16] and the atomic clashes along with bond length errors within the structure were removed by using ModRefiner [17]. threading-based modeling was used for G protein since its full-length template (VSV G) was not available in PDB. CHPV protein structures thus generated were subjected to prepare protein protocol of Accelrys Discovery Studio Client 2.55 for the energy minimization, optimizing short/medium sized loop regions, and protonating the protein structures. the stereochemical quality was estimated using Ramachandran plot, Verify3D, and ERRAT. pGBKT7 (BD, bait) and pGADT7 (AD, prey), Clontech, USA. primer pairs span nucleotides 1\u201390 bp (N1), 61\u2013894 bp (N2), and 693\u20131260 bp (N3) of the complete nucleocapsid ORF cloned in pET33b vector. 5 GST-N2 N2 F BamHI (pGEX-4T3) GCTAACAGGATCCATGGAAGACCCAGTGGGGATTTTTTTG. the restriction enzymes were amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction. the vectors, pGBKT7 and pGADT7, were linearized by the same enzyme combination and subsequently ligated with the digested N protein fragments. pGEX-4T3 constructs called GST-N1, GST-N2, and GST-N3 contain the three fragments fused in frame with GST tag at the N terminus. successful transformants were screened on Synthetically Defined (SD, Clontech, USA) media lacking amino acids tryptophan and leucine. y187 yeast strain was allowed to mate with each prey construct in AH109 yeast strain. mated diploids containing both bait and prey vectors were selected on SD media lacking tryptophan and leucine (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His) the structure of CHPV G protein in its perfusion state (530 aa) was generated using I-TASSER [15, 16] and the atomic clashes along with bond length errors within the structure were removed. the structure of CHPV P protein was modeled using abinitio method in combination with protein folding constraints. Oligomerization and C-terminal domains were modeled using SWISS-MODEL workspace while N-terminal and interconnecting domain models were obtained using I-TASSER and QUARK [18] respectively. the complete model was assembled manually by reproducing the torsion angles from the individual modeled segments to the extended polypeptide chain (289 amino acid) primer pairs span nucleotides 1\u201390 bp (N1), 61\u2013894 bp (N2), and 693\u20131260 bp (N3) of the complete nucleocapsid ORF cloned in pET33b vector [7] the clone of CHPV N gene was a kind gift from Dr. Dhrubajyoti Chattopadhyay of Dr. B. C. Guha the names of the restriction enzymes are in italics and their recognition sequences in bold. the vectors, pGBKT7 and pGADT7, were linearized by the same enzyme combination and subsequently ligated with the digested N protein fragments. 7 constructs, BD-N1, BD-N2, and BD-N3, encoded the fragments N1 (30 amino acids), N2 (278 amino acids) and N3 (191 amino acids) fused in frame downstream of AD domain. pGADT7 constructs, AD-N1, AD-N2, and AD-N3 encoded the corresponding fragments fused in frame downstream of AD domain. successful transformants were screened on Synthetically Defined (SD, Clontech, USA) media lacking tryptophan and histidine (SD/-Trp/-His) for bait constructs and on SD media lacking leucine and histidine (SD/-Leu/-His) for prey constructs. successful diploids containing both bait and prey vectors were selected on SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-gal plate for the protocol involved has been described earlier by the authors. results 3.1. Model Building and Validation CHPV P protein structure was transformed locally to introduce disulfide links between Cys37\u2013Cys172 and Cys57\u2013Cys286. the best pose with minimum E RDOCK score was chosen as near-native structure for each interaction. it was observed that N terminal region of N protein (N1, Nt arm) interacts with N, P, and M proteins while the central N2 (Nt lobe) interacts with N, P, and G proteins and C terminal region N3 (Ct lobe) interacts with N, P, and G proteins. CHPV N protein is shown in blue and M, P, and G proteins are shown in red. residues of CHPV N protein in the NM interface correspond to N1 and N2 fragments. the NN interaction has been discussed previously by the authors. X-Alpha galactosidase assay for interaction confirmation. all possible interacting pairs of CHPV nucleocapsid protein with other viral proteins with controls were plated in an array format on plate containing X--gal (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-gal) the results obtained were consistent in both directions except for BD-P which was autoactivating. ian virus large T-antigen encoded by pGBKT7-53 and pGADT7-T vectors as BD and AD fusions are known to be interacting proteins. pGBKT7-Lam and pGADT7-T encoding noninteracting Lamin protein and Simian virus large T-antigen served as negative interaction control. 8 (interaction of N1 with N, P, and M proteins; N2 with N and G proteins and N3 all four viral genes cloned individually as DNA-binding domain fusion (bait) and transformed in Y187 yeast strain were systematically mated with N1, N2, and N3 cloned individually as DNA-activation domain fusions (prey), transformed in AH109 yeast strain. diploid cells formed were selected on SD medium lacking amino acids tryptophan and leucine. the binding of N1 region with a nonrelevant protein-nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) as Strep tag fusion and binding of Strep (Strep-N, Strep-P, Strep-M and Strep-G) and GST (GST-N1, GST-N2, and GST-N3) fusions directly with the Streptactin plate were taken as experimental controls. the known interaction pairs (PN and PP) and noninteractors (PM and PG) of CHPV were included as experimental controls. the absorbance at 450 nm is plotted on the y axis (10 division = 0.2 OD) the test protein pairs are considered on the x axis. an acceptable docking pose has been defined as one where the RMSD of one of the proteins is 10 from the cluster center. the best pose with minimum E RDOCK score, generated after RDOCK refinement, was chosen as near-native structure for each interaction. top rank NM complex ZDOCK pose 684 (E_RDOCK score\u201431.356) top rank NP complex ZDOCK pose 220 (E_RDOCK score\u201427.932) CHPV proteins are represented as cartoons models. the residues of CHPV N protein in the NM interface correspond to N1 and N2. the interactions involving N1 and N2 fragments were analysed using BD-N1 and BD-N2. BD-P was found to activate the histidine reporter gene. combinations involving P protein were studied in context of reverse direction taking P protein as AD fusion. colonies which grew on histidine-deficient media were considered positive. blue colored colonies indicated positive interactions. p53 and Simian virus large T-antigen encoded as BD and AD fusions. X represents positive interaction. X represents negative interaction. all four viral genes cloned individually as DNA-binding domain fusion (bait) were systematically mated with N1, N2, and N3 cloned individually as DNA-activation domain fusions. s were expressed and the cell lysates were analysed for the solubility of these fragments. all three fragments were soluble (data not shown) and were used for the binding assay. binding of N1 region with a nonrelevant protein-nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) of Chikungunya virus was also taken as experimental controls. p-G, and Strep-nsP1) and only GST tag fusion proteins (GST-N1, GST-N2, GST-N3 and GST-P) were considered as background controls. a nonrelevant Strep tag fusion protein (Strep-nsP1) of Chikungunya virus was taken to test the specificity of N1 interactions. authors reported the interaction of N protein with N, P, M, and G proteins of CHPV [14] in a recent study on intraviral protein interactions among Chandipura viral proteins. a series of interactions studies using bioinformatics-based docking studies, yeast two-hybrid system, and ELISA have been performed. each combination of nucleocapsid protein fragments and CHPV full-length proteins was tested using ZDOCK, Y2H, and our bioinformatics predictions have narrowed down these regions to smaller peptides including residues 8 to 22 at the N terminus and 245 to 256 in the central region. we suggest the involvement of intermittent residues from 321 to 395 at the C terminus in the oligomerisation of N protein."}
