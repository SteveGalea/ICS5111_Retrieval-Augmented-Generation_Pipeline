{"summary": "equid herpesviruses, equine arteritis virus, africa horse sickness virus, equine coronavirus, Hendra virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, equine influenza virus, west Nile virus, eastern Equine Encephalitis, Western Equine Encephalitis, and most recently equine parvovirus-H causing hepatitis [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] a bat pegivirus was first identified using a degenerate PCR approach [19] and shown to be a common equine infection but was also not associated with equine liver disease [15]. a viral metagenomics study of equine serum pools recently identified the four equine viruses listed above plus unexpectedly the porcine Suid betaherpesvirus 2 [21]. the 13 horses with respiratory signs each had respiratory swabs that tested non-reactive for EHV-1/-4, EIV, ERAV/ERBV, and Streptococcus equi subspecies equi. all 53 samples from these 27 sick horses were analyzed in 12 pools of 4\u20135 samples using viral metagenomics. free nucleic acids in the 400 L filtrates were digested using DNAse and RNAse enzymes to enrich for viral nucleic acids protected within viral capsids. nucleic acids were then extracted and amplified by random RT-PCR followed by using the NexteraTM XT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) real-time PCR assays were developed to the three parvoviruses detected here using HTS (horse parvovirus-CSF, novel eqcopivirus, and bovine serum-associated bosavirus) real-time PCR assays were also designed for equine hepaciviruses detected in one plasma pool and for the recently identified eqPV-H pathogen using previously described PCR conditions. 68 horses were analyzed using one or two of three types of biological samples (plasma, CSF, and respiratory swabs) plasma and respiratory swabs were collected from 13 horses with neurological signs. 13 horses with neurological signs each had CSF with evidence of lymphocytic pleocytosis. each had respiratory swabs that tested non-reactive for EHV-1/-4, EIV, ERAV/ERBV, and Streptococcus equi subspecies equi. all 53 samples from these 27 sick horses were analyzed in 12 pools of 4\u20135 samples using viral metagenomics. RNA Isolation Kit was used to generate a library for Illumina MiSeq. raw data were pre-processed by subtracting human and bacterial sequences, duplicate sequences, and low quality reads. candidate viral hits were then compared to an in-house non-virus non-redundant protein database to remove false positive viral hits. PCR assays were also designed for equine hepaciviruses detected in one plasma pool and for the recently identified hepatotropic equine parvovirus-H pathogen. oligonucleotides were serially diluted and real-time PCR results endpoint detection were estimated at 100 to 125 input genome equivalents. phylogenetic analysis used sequences from nineteen different copiparvoviruses and human parvovirus B19 (AY386330) was used to root the tree. a total of 15.2 million reads generated for an average number of reads of 1.1 million per pool. equine copiparvovirus (eqcopivirus or EqCoPV) was named equine copiparvovirus (eqcopivirus or EqCoPV) reads matching previously described horse parvovirus-CSF genome were also detected. contigs showed 92\u201393% nt identities to equine pegivirus 1 (KC410872) in GenBank. another copiparvovirus was also detected but likely originated from fetal bovine plasma spiked into the respiratory swab viral transport medium. the nonstructural protein (NS1) proteins had 43.4% (coverage: 74%) and 31.3% (coverage: 69%) aa identity to the corresponding proteins of horse parvovirus-CSF (KR902500) and equine parvovirus-H (MG136722), respectively. the ORF structure of eqcopivirus is shown in Figure 1A. sample Type Pool Equine Hepacivirus EqPV-H Eqcopivirus Horse Parvovirus-CSF Bosavirus Neurological Signs Plasma 1 Pool1 30.32 Plasma 2 Plasma 3 Plasma 4 27.7 20 Plasma 5 Pool2 Plasma 6 34.65 36.73 Plasma 7 23.6 Plasma 8 Plasma 9 Pool3 Plasma 10 33.82 Plasma 11 Plasma 12 Plasma 13 CSF 1 Pool4 CSF 2 CSF 3 CSF 4 CSF 5 Pool5 CSF 6 CSF 7 CSF 8 bosavirus was originally described as a contaminant of fetal bovine serum. none of the other equine samples were preserved using fetal bovine serum. most commonly detected virus was the new eqcopivirus detected in 16/94 samples (14/68 horses) a total of 15.2 million reads were generated for an average number of reads of 1.1 million per pool. a total of 15.2 million reads were generated for an average number of reads. novel copiparvovirus reads from three pools generated contigs ranging in size from 1417 to 5158 nt. equine hepacivirus, equine pegivirus D, and equid gammaherpesvirus 2 and 5 in one pool each. most commonly detected eukaryotic viral reads belonged to the Copiparvovirus genus of Parvoviridae family. contigs showed 97.9\u201398.7% nt identities to equine hepacivirus (JQ434008) in GenBank. total of 13 different equid gammaherpesvirus 2 and 5 contigs were generated from 120 and 25 reads in a pool of swab from horses with respiratory symptom. the predicted capsid proteins (VP1) of eqcopivirus showed closest aa identity of 43.4% (coverage: 77%) and 37.7% (coverage: 53%) to the corresponding proteins of its closest relative the horse parvovirus-CSF (KR902500) and equine parvovirus-H (MG136722). the nonstructural protein (NS1) proteins had 43.4% (coverage: 74%) and 31.3% (coverage: real-time PCR assays were used for equine hepaciviruses and the recently identified hepatotropic equine parvovirus-H pathogen. these PCR assays were then used on all 94 available equine plasma, CSF, and respiratory swabs. positive detections are shown with Ct values that are proportional to their nucleic acid target concentration. bosavirus was originally described as a contaminant of fetal bovine serum. it was detected in every respiratory swab sample with nearly identical CT value. none of the other equine samples were preserved using fetal bovine serum. eqcopivirus prevalence in plasma samples from respiratory cases (4/14 or 28.6%) was compared to that in plasma from healthy animals (7/41 or 17%) the difference (measured using Fisher\u2019s exact test) yielded a non-significant p value of 0.443. the next two most prevalent viruses were the hepatotropic parvovirus-H and equine hepacivirus both found in 11/89 samples including 3 co-infections. equine hepacivirus, equine pegivirus, and equine herpesvirus 2 and 5 were also detected. the presence of viral nucleic acids detected by PCR or HTS does not prove the presence of infectious viruses. PCR previously showed EqPV-H DNA to be present in the plasma of 13% healthy horses in the us [2] and 12% of healthy race horses in China [13], rates of viremia similar to that detected here in 6/41 (15%) of healthy horses. the eqcopivirus genome described here represents the third parvovirus species confirmed to infect horses by virtue of detection in multiple equine plasma, CSF, and respiratory swabs. horse parvovirus-CSF [20] (n = 2) and eqcopivirus (n = 1) in horses indicates a possible role for these viruses in these neurological signs. the availability of eqcopivirus genome sequences will now allow the design of hybridization probes to determine whether infected cells can be identified in fixed brain or lung tissues from animals with unexplained neurological or respiratory signs."}
