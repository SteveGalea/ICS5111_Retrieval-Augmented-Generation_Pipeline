{"summary": "the study period was January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2003. all respiratory specimens are routinely cultured using 4 continuous cell lines. this could support the growth of various viruses including influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus. in 2003, the monthly number of respiratory specimens ranged from 665 to 5,432 (mean 1,399), in comparison with a range throughout the years 1998\u20132002 of 757 to 3,162 (mean 1,334.5) a surge in the number of specimens was noted during March and April 2003 (5,432 and 3,758, respectively) similar changes in PPS were not observed for hepatitis B, which is caused by a bloodborne virus with a different mode of transmission than that of 94 0.072\u20130.216 0.145\u20130.232 0.123\u20130.173 0.040\u20130.105 0.009\u20130.044 0.008\u20130.030 0.022\u20130.110 % change +19 \u201326 \u201356 \u201382 \u201388 \u201358 \u201333 \u201347 +49 +87 \u201349 \u201344 Parainfluenza No. isolates 29 35 75 12 2 1 11 26 29 68 75 112 No. tests performed 1,166 1,530 5,432 3, 0.022 0.032 Range of PPS (98\u201302) 0.003\u20130.054 0.010\u20130.065 0.037\u20130.090 0.055\u20130.155 0.049\u20130.112 0.042\u20130.098 0.038\u20130.113 0.046\u20130.126 0.057\u20130.118 0.018\u20130.051 0.001\u20130.060 0.001\u20130.072 % change +203 \u201364 \u201378 \u201394 \u201395 \u201395 \u201386 \u201315 0.189 0.147 0.153 Average PPS (98\u201302) 0.147 0.132 0.127 0.129 0.125 0.156 0.154 0.156 0.168 0.167 0.148 Range of PPS (98\u201302) 0.083\u20130.228 0.079\u20130.190 0.093\u20130.153 0.070\u20130.168 0.085\u20130.162 0.096\u20130.188 0.104\u20130.186 0.068\u20130.228 0.086\u20130.250 0.081\u20130.233 0.099\u20130.249 0.082 population coverage for influenza vaccination in Hong Kong has been 15% throughout the study period (A. Chan, pers. comm.) the concomitant significant reduction in PPS for all 4 respiratory viruses in the same period argues against 2003's being a milder year for influenza. each of these measures could not be estimated in our study. the effective implementation of such measures requires determined and sustained educational efforts from health authorities with collaboration of the public."}
