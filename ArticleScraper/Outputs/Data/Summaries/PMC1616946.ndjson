{"summary": "eukaryotic ribosomal frameshifting occurs when the P-site tRNA does not form standard codon\u2013anticodon interactions (8). a correlation between +1 frameshift efficiency and the final stability of the P-site tRNA\u2013mRNA interaction in the 0 frame has been shown previously (9,10). a wide variety of structures, most commonly H-type pseudoknots (17) have been identified which stimulate 1 frameshifting in eukaryotes. RNA pseudoknots have also been shown to stimulate programmed +1 frameshifting in many eukaryotic antizyme genes. frameshifting at the mammalian antizyme mRNA shift site, UCC UGA, is stimulated by two cis-acting signals (39,40) one of these, the 5\u2032 element, encompasses 50 bases upstream of shift site. the other cis-acting element is a pseudoknot located 3\u2032 of the shift site. frameshift reporter constructs and 2\u2032-O-Methyl oligonucleotides were synthesized at the university of Utah DNA/Peptide Core Facility. they would have appropriate ends to ligate into the SalI/BamHI sites of the dual luciferase vector, p2luc (45). 2\u2032-O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) 2\u2032-O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) shifting was calculated as the percentage of full-length (frameshift) product relative to the termination product and the full-length product combined. the reported values are the average and standard deviations obtained from at least three independent measurements. ucleotides were synthesized at the University of Utah DNA/Peptide Core Facility. they would have appropriate ends to ligate into the SalI/BamHI sites of the dual luciferase vector, p2luc (45). the sequence was verified as described previously (46). 2\u2032-O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) 2\u2032-O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) p2lucAZ1PKdel was co-transfected into CV-1 cells with varying concentrations of AZ1B 2\u2032-O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C (5% CO2) for 20 h. sequences containing shift-prone sites were cloned between the two reporter genes. the downstream firefly luciferase gene is in the +1 reading frame. the resulting constructs were then transcribed and translated in vitro. each construct was subjected to coupled transcription and translation reactions. p2luc-AZ1wt contains the wild-type antizyme frameshift cassette. p2luc-AZ1-0sp has a 3 bp deletion of the spacer sequences separating the shift site from the pseudoknot. fluc and Rluc represent Firefly and Renilla luciferase genes. antizyme shift site 2\u2032-O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were designed to anneal downstream of the UCC UGA shift site of RNA produced from p2luc-AZ1PKdel (AZ1PKdel) the 3\u2032 ends were located 0 (AZ1A), 3 (AZ1B) or 6 (AZ1C) nt downstream of the UGA codon of the shift site. no antisense oligonucleotide was added to reticulocyte lysate translations. no antisense oligonucleotide was added to transcription and translation reactions. p2luc-AZ1PKm1 contains sequences from the 5\u2032 half of the axis formed by the stacking of stem 1 and stem 2 of the pseudoknot. PKm2 is the same except that a mispaired C and bulged A were located at positions 9 and 16, respectively. p2luc-AZ1wt and antisense oligonucleotide PKm2 induced frameshifting. PKm1 and PKm2 induced 30 and 22% frameshifting. neither PKm1 nor PKm2 induced frameshifting to the same levels as with AZ1B. 2\u2032-O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were designed to anneal between 3 and 15 nt (SL1) or 3 and 22 nt (SL2) downstream from the UGA codon of the shift site. frameshift efficiency induced by these two antisense oligonucleotides, 8 and 22% respectively, was somewhat lower than that observed with PKm1 and PKm2. p2luc-AZ1FS (AZ1 FS) or p2luc-AZ1FS-UGG (AZ1FS-UGG) were transcribed and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence or absence of 0.4 mM spermidine. spermidine induced 3, 1 and 1.4% frameshifting in the presence of spermidine and 1.9, 0.8 and 1.7% frameshifting. p2lucAZPKdel was transfected into cultured cells with p2lucAZ1PKdel. the cells were incubated for 20 h and the percent frameshifting was determined by assaying firefly and Renilla luciferase activity in cell lysates. maximum levels of frameshifting were observed in the presence of 0.4 mM spermidine. low-level frameshifting, 0.1% or less, was observed in the absence of exogenous spermidine. the location of the full-length frameshift product (+1 FS) and non-frameshift termination product (Term) are indicated. trans-acting stimulators of frameshifting at antizyme shift site 2\u2032-O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were designed to anneal downstream of the UCC UGA shift site of RNA produced from p2luc-AZ1PKdel. RNA was transcribed from p2luc-AZ1PKdel in the absence of oligonucleotide. RNA was added to reticulocyte lysate translations in the absence of increasing amounts of spermidine. no 1 frameshift product was observed when the wild-type antizyme cassette was examined in the absence of antisense oligonucleotide addition. it was of interest to determine whether the wild-type antizyme pseudoknot could induce 1 frameshifting when located in the equivalent position. in this case, the wild-type pseudoknot is directly 3\u2032 adjacent to the shift site. PKm1 has perfect complimentarity to the region starting 3 nt and ending 21 nt downstream of the UGA shift site codon. a mispaired C and bulged A were located at positions 9 and 16, respectively. p2luc-AZ1wt and PKm2 induced 30 and 22% frameshifting. a second construct, p2luc-AZ1sl, was designed to contain only the 5\u2032 half of stem 1 of the antizyme pseudoknot downstream from the UCC UGA shift site. frameshift efficiency induced by these two antisense oligonucleotides, 8 and 22% respectively, was somewhat lower for the longer antisense oligonucleotide (SL2) each antisense oligonucleotide AZ1A, AZ1B or AZ1C was added to coupled transcription and translation reactions with p2luc-AZ1FS. frameshift efficiency was measured at 11, 8 and 4%, in the presence of spermidine and 3, 0.4 and 0.2% in its absence for AZ1A, AZ1B and AZ1C. AZ1C induced 3, 1 and 1.4% frameshifting in the presence of spermidine. 1.9, 0.8 and 1.7% frameshifting in its absence. antisense oligonucleotides induced frameshifting in cultured mammalian cells. variations of the IBV pseudoknot have demonstrated a lack of correlation between the extent of pausing and the efficiency of frameshifting (47). the resulting movement of the tRNA displaces the anticodon loop towards the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA. frameshifting is induced when the antisense\u2013mRNA duplex begins 3 nt downstream of the UGA of the shift site. the stimulatory secondary structure would be encountered by the ribosome when the UCC codon enters the A-site of the ribosome. this latter event most likely involves competition between termination and +1 frame decoding when the UGA codon is in the A-site. spermidine stimulation was observed in the absence of the 5\u2032 element. cis-acting element is not required for polyamine responsiveness. spermidine stimulation was virtually eliminated by altering the UGA codon to UGG."}
