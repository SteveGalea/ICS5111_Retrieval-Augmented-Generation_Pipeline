{"summary": "MGRAT intends to assess the risks associated with religious mass gathering events in Indian settings. content validity index and Fleiss kappa statistics were calculated to assess the agreement between multiple raters. mass gatherings cause notable challenges in terms of communicable and non-communicable disease surveillance, emergency preparedness, environmental health, vaccination, food safety, crowd management. such gatherings are accumulations of \"well people,\" but such events are not very well understood. a ten-year analysis of public health safety in 27 traditional MG events of India indicated around 936 dead and 540 injured casualties. there is no systematic process of the RA conducted in the field. the proposed RA tool (MGRAT-Mass Gathering Risk Assessment Tool) will be fundamental in identifying potential public health risks. a sum total of forty-eight unique health risks were identified. seven domains and twenty-three items were generated from the content analysis. content validity questionnaire consisted of 28 questions. data collected from experts through content validity questionnaire were entered and analyzed with statistical software Epi info 7.1.5.2 version. content validity index for overall scale and item wise (I-CVI) were calculated. draft tool was circulated among six subject experts for review. four experts from department of public health and preventive medicine and two academics/research consultants. experts were asked to assess the tool and give their comments about the domains, items, relevant responses, and overall presentation of the tool. Item-content validity index (I-CVI) of \"Solid waste management\" (item no 14) was calculated to be 0.17. items 7, 9, 14, and 20 were retained in the tool with minor modifications. 6 1 13 3 Sanitation and hygiene facilities 6 1 14 3 Solid waste management - - - - 1 0.17** 15 3 Special rituals 6 1 16 4 Food safety 6 1 17 4 Water safety 6 1 18 5 Crowd management 6 1 19 5 Event access points 6 1 19 5 Fire safety - 5 0.83* 21 5 Natural hazards management 6 1 22 6 Level of medical services at the venue 6 1 23 7 Preplanning activities 6 1 S-CVI/Ave: 0.92. agreement between the experts was calculated and reported. agreement between the experts expressed as CVI and Fleiss kappa statistics. kappa statistic is a consensus index of inter-rater agreement that adjusts for chance agreement. kappa is a consensus index of inter-rater agreement that adjusts for chance agreement. kappa statistics to measure agreement between multiple experts showed a significant agreement value of 0.522. content validity is a systematic process, which includes the judgment/quantification on instrument items by content experts. this study indicated that the MGRAT is a valid tool, which enjoys an appropriate level of content validity."}
