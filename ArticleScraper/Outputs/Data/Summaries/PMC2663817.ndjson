{"summary": "new artemisinin-based combination therapies offer excellent efficacy. resistance to most artemisinin partners drugs has already been seen. it is important to characterize biochemical features and biological roles of new drug targets. the hydrolysis of hemoglobin by malaria parasites is a massive proteolytic enterprise. falcipain inhibitors completely block hemoglobin hydrolysis by erythrocytic parasites. falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 hydrolyze native hemoglobin under biochemical conditions of the food vacuole. urea solubilized inclusion bodies from falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 fused to a 6HIS tag were purified by ultra-filtration and bound to Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) columns. urea solubilized inclusion bodies from bacteria fused to a 6HIS tag were purified by ultra-filtration. falcipain-2 (50 nM) and falcipain-3 (300 nM) were assayed in triplicate at 25\u00b0C in 100 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Brij-35, 1% v/v DMSO, pH 5.5. each peptide (250 mM) was incubated in duplicate with 65 nM falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 in 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 2 mM DTT, and 50% H2 18O at 37\u00b0C. peptide hydrolysis data were custom-ordered from Sigma-Genosys. the second incorporation depends on the ability of the enzyme to rebind the cleaved peptide product and catalyze the carbonyl oxygen exchange reaction. in the presence of 50% H2 18O, peptides displayed an 18O-isotope signature of 11 (unlabeled: single labeled) peptides with initial single label followed by double label were included. if the single label significantly increased with time, peptides with slight labeling at 0 min were included; h) if the single label significantly increased with time, peptides with slight labeling at 0 min were included. a 20 minute linear gradient from 2% B to 50% B was run at a 250 nL/min flow rate. nitrogen served as a collision gas and collision energy was automatically adjusted. peptides were identified by using the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Science; version 2.1) bound protein was eluted sequentially with 500 mM and 1 M imidazole. eluates 100-fold in 100 mM Tris-HCl, 15% sucrose, 250 mM arginine, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM reduced-glutathione (GSH), 1 mM oxidized-glutathione (GSSG) and incubating at 4\u00b0C overnight. peptide-conjugated ACC contained 160,000 different P1- P4 peptide sequences. cleavage of the substrates by a protease released free ACC. excitation and emission maxima from 325 and 400 nm to 380 and 460 nm. each peptide (250 mM) was incubated in duplicate with 65 nM falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 in 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 2 mM DTT, and 50% H2 18O at 37\u00b0C. es were custom-ordered from Sigma-Genosys. peptides that were proteolytically generated displayed an 18O-isotope signature of 11 (unlabeled: single labeled) at their newly-formed C-termini. the extent of 18O incorporation for each peptide was determined by linear regression analysis of the raw spectra. proteolytic products formed while the C-termini stayed intact did not incorporate 18O. peptides should be seen in at least two time points and in replicate analyses. peptides should not be seen at the zero time point. a 20 minute linear gradient from 2% B to 50% B was run at a 250 nL/min flow rate, utilizing solvents A: (2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) precursor ion selection employed an automated routine that consisted of a one survey MS scan (1 s, m/z 400\u20131700) nitrogen served as a collision gas and collision energy was automatically adjusted depending on the size and charge state of the precursor ion. tetrapeptide library, 12-mer peptides representing the sequences of and globin, and intact hemoglobin. all assays were performed under conditions matching, to the best of our knowledge, those of the P. falciparum food vacuole. cleavage of 12-mer peptides spanning the sequences of and globin. each potential cleavage site was considered with at least 3 P or P\u2032 amino acids present. proteases and peptide substrates incubated with 50% H2 18O. more thorough analysis of cleavage for each amino acid at each P1\u20134 position is in supplementary material. cleavages demonstrated at sites with multiple different prime-side amino acids. most preferred amino acids were ala and leu. a free software for plotting consensus sequences was used to plot P4- P4\u2032 preferences. a simple step-wise pathway for hemoglobin degradation was not seen. instead, we identified over a hundred peptides of molecular weight 9 kDa or less after 5 minute incubations of human hemoglobin with falcipain-2 or falcipain-3. cipain-3 were expressed in bacteria, purified, and refolded to active proteases. these proteases have previously been shown to readily hydrolyze hemoglobin [15], [17], and also to cleave peptide substrates after leu-Arg-, Val-Leu-Arg-, and Val-Leu-Lys- [17] leu and a slight preference for Val. Amino acid preferences were less pronounced at the P3 and P4 positions, although specificities for both enzymes were similar. at P3, positively charged amino acids, hydrophobic amino acids, and Pro were preferred. cleavages by falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 were seen at 25 of 36 positions with P2 Leu and by falcipain-3 at 22 of 36 such positions. analysis of step-wise hydrolysis of peptides yielded a complex picture for both and globin and either falcipain-2 or falcipain-3. cleavage of globin peptides is based on analysis of cleavage of 12-mer peptides spanning the sequences of and globin. cleavage site preferences for falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are shown schematically. cleavage sites were identified in both loops (blue color) and helices (red color) of human globin. no particular preference for buried or exposed cleavage sites on the hemoglobin tertiary structure. falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are critical hemoglobinases of P. falciparum. we evaluated hydrolysis of small peptide combinatorial libraries by falcipains. other proteases that have been evaluated in this manner include caspases [32], the serine protease granzyme b [32], [33], [34], a coronavirus cysteine protease [35], a tick asparaginyl endopeptidase [36], and human kalikreins [37]. inhibitors with either Phe or Leu at P2 were effective, but activity improved 10-fold for fluoromethyl ketones, vinyl sulfones, and aldehydes with P2 Leu. elaboration of enzyme specificity using tetrapeptide scanning libraries provided accurate prediction of optimal small molecule inhibitors. prior studies have estimated the pH of the food vacuole at 4.5\u20135.8. cysteine proteases of schistosomes or malaria parasites have been unsuccessful due to an inability to identify the ordered generation of cleavage fragments. despite rigorous filtering to identify only bona fide cleavage fragments, we found that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 hydrolyzed hemoglobin simultaneously. this result is consistent with known features of other papain-family cysteine proteases that take advantage of its broad substrate specificity. plasmepsins I\u2013IV, the 4 known food vacuole plasmepsins, was not lethal to P. falciparum. knockout of either falcipain-3 [11] or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I [46] appears to be lethal, arguing for essential functions for these enzymes. falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are not biochemically identical. they are expressed sequentially during the parasite life cycle. falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 contain a short C-terminal insertion. this is unique among studied papain-family proteases. only 15 of 37 cleavages identified after incubation with food vacuole extracts were seen after incubation with falcipain-2 or falcipain-3. some hemoglobin cleavages appeared to be generated uniquely by proteases other than the falcipains. some falcipain activity may have been missed in studies of vacuole extracts. falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are capable of rapid hydrolysis of hemoglobin at multiple cleavage sites. it is of interest that two common polymorphisms leading to alterations in the sequence of hemoglobin offer protection against severe malaria [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], and many others may offer protection against malaria. our results show that the falcipains hydrolyze hemoglobin at multiple sites, allowing efficient degradation of this substrate. the falcipains are the key proteases responsible for the massive hydrolysis of hemoglobin that occurs over the course of the intraerythrocytic life cycle."}
