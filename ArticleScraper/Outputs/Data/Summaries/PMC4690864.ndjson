{"summary": "electron microscopy (EM) has played a major role due to the small size of virus particles that, with very few exceptions, cannot be visualized by conventional light microscopy. e.g., viruses were detected indirectly by means of the cytopathic effect they cause in infected cells or through clinical manifestations. during the 20th century EM has been a standard technique for virus diagnosis. in this review we have compiled information about the different EM approaches with a focus on methods allowing the visualization of cellular structures in 3D. the standard method to prepare viruses for EM involves the following steps: fixation, embedding and sectioning. ation is done with heavy metals (e.g., osmium tetroxide (OsO4) and uranyl acetate (UA) samples are dehydrated with increasing concentrations of an organic solvent (e.g., ethanol or acetone) and embedded into a plastic resin. coverslips must be removed from the polymerized resin block by successive immersions in liquid nitrogen and hot water. for rapid immobilization of cells by HPF, they must chemical fixation of cells is usually performed with buffered aldehydes. the aldehydes create an inter- and intra-molecular network of covalent interactions. this results in the formation of a large 3D network of irreversible cross-links throughout the cytoplasm in tenths of seconds to minutes. sodium cacodylate, sodium phosphate, HEPES (4-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) and PIPES (piperazine-N,N\u2032-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) are among the most widely used. best results require adaptation to individual experimental conditions. the main drawback of chemical fixation is that it alters the structure of the cell by forming a network of cross-linked molecules. EM micrographs were taken with permission from Romero-Brey et al. cryo-Fixation Freezing techniques represent an alternative to the artifact-prone chemical fixation. the basic principle is to arrest cells by rapid cooling, a process that takes a few milliseconds, resulting in the simultaneous stabilization of all cellular components without altering their environment. ice crystals alter the cytoplasm ultrastructure by inducing phase segregation between water and solutes. high pressure freezing (HPF) prevents expansion of water, lowering its freezing point, increasing the freezing rate and reducing the crystallization rate of ice. cells must be grown on resistant supports like sapphire [45,46] or aclar [47,48,49] discs. aclar discs are normally carbon coated to improve cell attachment. chemically inactivated samples can be also subsequently subjected to cryo-fixation outside the laboratory. this combination can result in an even better preservation of the subcellular structure compared to samples preserved by chemical fixation alone. however, this combination can result in an excellent preservation of the DMVs induced by HCV. osmium tetroxide (OsO4) and uranyl acetate (UA) are used after chemical fixation as contrasting agents in routine EM. heavy metals like osmium tetroxide (OsO4) and uranyl acetate (UA) are used after fixation as contrasting agents in routine EM. epoxy resins are an excellent embedding medium for high-resolution structural preservation and 3D analysis. they can be stored in liquid nitrogen (LN2) or immediately further processed by means of freeze substitution (FS) epoxy resins can be used to embed freeze-substituted samples. the final polymerization step can be induced at room temperature with UV light (360 nm) the samples should be further dehydrated at room temperature after the substitution to be subsequently embedded and polymerized at high temperatures. TEM consists of post-staining grids with UA and lead salts. sections can be directly observed by TEM, without requirement for on-section staining. TEM-working principle adapted from Briggman and Bock. frozen-hydrated sections can be analyzed by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) the method of choice is freezing or vitrification of cells followed by their direct examination at very low temperatures by cryo-EM. however, due again to the limited penetration power of electrons, only the thin cell periphery of frozen cells can be visualized by standard cryo-EM. artifacts caused by extraction, denaturation, steric hindrance, chemical alteration of epitopes and changes in volume and shape. fixation of cells can be carried out by two different methods: chemical fixation (Figure 1A) or cryo-immobilization (i.e., physical-fixation; Figure 1B) sodium cacodylate, sodium phosphate, HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) and PIPES (piperazine-N,N\u2032-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) are among the most widely used. best results require adaptation to individual experimental conditions. EM micrographs were taken with permission from Romero-Brey et al.. the main drawback of chemical fixation is that it alters the structure of the cell by forming a network of cross-linked molecules. cryo-Fixation Freezing techniques represent an alternative to the artifact-prone chemical fixation. the basic principle is to arrest cells by rapid cooling, a process that takes a few milliseconds, resulting in the simultaneous stabilization of all cellular components without altering their environment. ice formation is pre-incubating the biological samples with anti-freeze agents to reduce the concentration of free water. however, the use of these cryoprotectants introduce alterations in the original cytoarchitecture [40]. the unique means to preserve cells in its native state in absence of cryoprotectants is to freeze them in such a way that the water of the living cells turn into vitreous ice [37] chemical and cryo-Fixation Handling of infectious specimens requires working under strict biosafety level (BSL) conditions. chemically inactivated samples can be also subjected to cryo-fixation outside the BSL laboratory. this combination can result in an even better preservation of the subcellular structure as compared to samples preserved by chemical fixation alone. chemical fixation of cells is usually performed with buffered aldehydes. the aldehydes create an inter- and intra-molecular network of covalent interactions. this results in the formation of a large 3D network of irreversible cross-links throughout the cytoplasm in tenths of seconds to minutes. a buffer with a physiological pH (6.8\u20137.4) and a concentration of at least 0.1 M (mol/L) is among the most widely used. the best results require adaptation to individual experimental conditions. the best results require adaptation to individual experimental conditions. EM micrographs were taken with permission from Romero-Brey et al.. the main drawback of chemical fixation is that it alters the structure of the cell by forming a network of cross-linked molecules. cryo-Fixation Freezing techniques represent an alternative to the artifact-prone chemical fixation. the basic principle is to arrest cells by rapid cooling, a process that takes a few milliseconds, resulting in the simultaneous stabilization of all cellular components without altering their environment. this lies in the poor heat conductance of water: high superficial cooling rates rapidly decay within the sample. a way of preventing ice formation is pre-incubating the biological samples with anti-freeze agents to reduce the concentration of free water. however, the use of these cryoprotectants introduce alterations in the original cytoarchitecture. the unique means to preserve cells in its native state in absence of cryoprotectants is to freeze them in such a way that the water of the living cells turn into vitreous ice [37] a combination of chemical and cryo-Fixation Handling of infectious specimens requires working under strict biosafety level (BSL) conditions. samples must be inactivated before leaving these facilities, which is achieved by chemical fixation. however, few laboratories in the world are equipped with freezing devices, as well as with cryo-microscopes. this alternative dehydration protocol has been successfully used to study the Rubella Virus factories [54]. this hybrid method also caused a slight extraction of the cytosol. a note of caution should be added that aldehyde pre-fixation might change the morphology of some cell organelles as previously reported. conventional plastic embedding requires resins with heat-induced (above 50 \u00b0C) polymerization such as epoxy resins. resulting high degree of covalent interaction between epoxy resins and the biological material make these resins not well compatible for immunocytochemistry. resins are mostly used for immunocytochemistry and correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) studies. epoxy resins can be also used to embed freeze-substituted samples. long periods of infiltration are characteristic of the FS approach. osmicated cells can still be used for immunocytochemical approaches. osmicated cells can still be used for subsequent immunocytochemical approaches. epoxy resins are an excellent embedding medium for high-resolution structural preservation. the initial polymerization of the resin is usually carried out at sub-zero temperatures. low viscosity resins (e.g., lowicryl, LRWhite and LRGold resins) which enable infiltration at very low temperatures, are mostly used. they also have a low tendency to co-polymerize with the sample structure. the size of the section is limited by the size of the 3.05 mm round standard EM grid. ultrathin sections (60\u201380 nm) are obtained and remain floating on the surface of the water shank of the diamond knife. they normally need to be contrasted before they can be visualized by TEM. beam is generated (by a thermionic or a field emission gun) and accelerated under vacuum. scattered electrons are focused by electromagnetic lenses and magnified onto an imaging device such as a fluorescent screen or recorded with a digital camera. TEM-working principle is adapted from Briggman and Bock [78] CEMOVIS is a much more accessible approach ([86], reviewed in [87]) despite its critical challenges: obtaining good quality sections (without knife marks, crevasses or ripples, produced during sectioning) that remain attached to the EM grid [88] and its subsequent imaging at low temperatures and also low electron doses. means of plastic-EM (A-E, on the left) or cryo-EM (F-K, on the right) can be analyzed by ET and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) tomography. sections of 300 nm and 500\u20131000 nm of a region of interest (ROI, highlighted in green) can be analyzed. a FIB can be used to slice 30 nm sections from the block face of vitrified cells. techniques allowing for wider fields of view are highlighted in orange. in green are those allowing the imaging of smaller fields of view.

a total of 8.4 m) of cells containing cylindrical inclusions (CIs) revealed that these structures form long tubes throughout the cytosol. serial sections of VZV-infected cells have been analyzed by SEM. a focused ion beam ([178,179], and others) act as nano-scalpels. once a thin slice is made (3\u201350 nm) the block face is imaged with SEM using low accelerating voltage. this technique is normally used to specifically view heavy metal-stained cellular components. an improved protocol for cell preparation to be analyzed in this way has been recently published. the embedded cells must be trimmed and mounted on a SEM specimen stub with silver paint. the whole specimen must be platinum or gold alloy coated to improve conductivity. ified specimens have low inherent contrast and are electron-dose sensitive. cryo-EM is not as widely used as plastic-EM, but in returns yields datasets with very high resolution, disclosing molecular details of the cellular landscape. as plastic-ET, can be applied to entire vitrified cells (Figure 5B), avoiding the arduous cutting step (reviewed in [147,187,200]) the method is routinely performed with plunge frozen cells [27] (Figure 4H) soft X-ray cryo-tomography is a powerful method that takes advantage of the high penetration power of X-rays (up to 10 m) [209,210] without using any fixative or contrasting reagent [211,212]. this technique has provided further insights into the Vaccinia virus and Herpesvirus infection cycles [90,145]. thin sections (250\u20131000 nm, in pink) can be analyzed by means of electron tomography (ET) or scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography using microscopes operated with voltages >100 kV. thicker sections (300 nm) can be analyzed by means of electron tomography (ET) ([146,147,148]) based on the principle defined by Radon in his seminal paper of 1917 [151]: 3D information (a tomogram) can be retrieved from the projections of an object. the higher their accelerating voltage, the thicker the objects that can be analyzed. to overcome this problem the specimen can be tilted around two orthogonal axes (dual-axis tomography) applications to the Study of Virus-Infected Cells ET has become an important method for virologists. the bulk of these studies relates to virus-induced remodeling of cell membranes in order to build up their replication organelles, mostly positive-strand RNA viruses. the target cell extends long filopodial bridges towards the infected cell across the intercellular gap. the target cell extends long filopodial bridges towards the infected cell. the target cell extends long filopodial bridges towards the infected cell. 2D projections of the same field of view are acquired every tilted angle, from which the cell volume is subsequently reconstructed in silico. cryo-ET, cryo-STEM tomography or soft X-ray cryo-tomography can be applied to vitrified cells grown on EM grids. the microscope must be operated at very low temperatures and with low electron doses. the specimen can be tilted around two orthogonal axes (dual-axis tomography) the two tomograms are then computed from each tilt series. this method reduces at least the missing-wedge to a missing-pyramid, resulting in a gain of 3D information. the information obtained through ET is from a small percentage of the whole cell volume. digital slice derived from STEM tomography of 280 nm thick section. cellular and viral structures were segmented on all 28 sections.

Description Apart from serial ET, another way of circumventing the limited thickness of ET is the use of the STEM modus allowing the collection of tomographic datasets. main advantage of using the STEM modus is its scanning geometry that allows for dynamic focusing so that the imaging conditions are uniform across a tilted specimen [160]. the main advantage of using the STEM modus is its scanning geometry. it allows for dynamic focusing so that the imaging conditions are uniform across a tilted specimen [160]. TEM tomography of thick, plastic-embedded sections has revealed an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and far higher contrast over conventional TEM tomography. a ribbon of consecutive ultrathin sections (60\u201380 nm) of a cell can be obtained manually (A) or automatically on a tape (ATUM, automatic tape-collecting ultramicrotome) (B) and subsequently analyzed by TEM (C) or SEM (D) ATUM-SEM allows to reliably cut thousands of sections as thin as 30 nm. manuel serial sectioning has been used to study virus-infected cells by means of TEM. serial sectioning can be performed to the entire cell volume and provide information about its architecture. micrographs obtained either by TEM or scanning EM (SEM) must be taken from every section and be aligned to obtain a stack of images. a ribbon of consecutive ultrathin sections (60\u201380 nm) of a cell can be either obtained manually (A) or automatically on a tape (ATUM, automatic tape-collecting ultramicrotome) (B) manual sectioning allows to reliably cut thousands of sections as thin as 30 nm. sections can be collected automatically for SEM imaging on electron-opaque plastic tapes (ATUM, automatic tape-collecting ultramicrotome) the working principle of these approaches is the same as with serial sectioning. the sectioning is integrated inside the SEM microscope and carried out in a fully automated manner with the help of a diamond knife and a focused ion beam. the sequential \u201cslicing and imaging\u201d process can be repeated ad libitum allowing to produce a stack of images that can be computationally combined into a 3D reconstruction [182]. the cells can be prepared as for TEM. SBEM has not been applied yet to the study of viral infection. but FIB-SEM, also called IA-SEM, has been extensively employed for the study of HIV release and spread. the newly generated block face is milled (with the FIB, blue), resulting in the removal of a thin layer (as small as 3 nm; [181]) the sequential \u201cslicing and imaging\u201d process can be repeated ad libitum allowing to produce a stack of images that can be computationally combined into a 3D reconstruction [182]. FIB-SEM allows site-specific imaging, which makes it ideal for correlative microscopy approaches. it requires a very expensive specialized instrument and the sections cannot be re-examined again. SBEM has not been applied yet to the study of viral infection. Cryo-ultramicrotomy has shown its capability in producing samples of vitrified cells and tissues for visualization by cryo-TEM and tomography [191,192,193]. however, sectioning at cryogenic temperatures is notoriously difficult and artifact-prone: sections inevitably suffer from adverse distortions caused by harsh mechanical interactions of a diamond knife and a moving specimen block during the cutting process. the herpesvirus life cycle is the most comprehensively studied [202]. the study of the envelopment of herpes simplex Virus particles is the most comprehensively studied [202]. the increase in acceptable specimen thickness of cryo-STEM tomography (also called CSTET) broadens its applicability. Cryo FIB-SEM FIB-milling can be used for serial block imaging of (high-pressure)-frozen hydrated specimens in the SEM, generating large volume data for 3D analysis in an automated fashion [216]. the lack of compression artifacts associated with cutting allows a more accurate merging of sequential images to get large datasets. a common feature to all approaches with exception of CETOVIS is its speed: imaging can start immediately after freezing. Cryo-FIB Cryo-FIB represents an emerging alternative technique for \u201cthinning\u201d frozen biological specimens without the above mentioned limitations of cryo-ultramicrotomy [196] Cryo-FIB (CET) can be applied to entire vitrified cells (Figure 5B), avoiding the arduous cutting step. the increase in acceptable specimen thickness of cryo-STEM tomography (also called CSTET) broadens its applicability (Figure 4I) due to the weak electron scattering properties of light elements, the main components of biological, unstained vitrified specimens are, in principle, not the ideal candidates for STEM imaging. high resolution of cryo-ET has limited its use when fine ultrastructural details are needed. this technique has provided further insights into the Vaccinia virus and Herpesvirus infection cycles [90,145]. it can be used for serial block imaging of (high-pressure)-frozen hydrated specimens. FIB-SEM represents the most modern technique, although resolution in the Z-plane is still lower than with ET. the possibility to reconstruct complete cell volumes in an automatic manner provides unprecedented insights into the morphology of inter-cellular contacts as well as large cell organelles and their remodeling upon virus infection. molecular architecture of complexes can be resolved in their natural cellular environment, devoid of staining and chemical fixation artifacts. cryo-EM is currently the most promising approach to comprehensively map the macromolecular architecture of proteins or proteins assemblies. the main drawback of EM is its inability to study the dynamics of biological processes. D information will become available in the not too distant future."}
