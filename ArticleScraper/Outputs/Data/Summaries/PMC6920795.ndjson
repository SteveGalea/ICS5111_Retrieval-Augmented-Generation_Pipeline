URTIs vary from self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) to life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) a working group of the Fourth European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-4) reviewed literature on community respiratory viruses and made recommendations in January 2013. the main laboratory tests used are nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT), direct antigen testing (DAD), and virus isolation by cell culture (VIC). NAT is often preferred, having a higher sensitivity and shorter turn-around time (24 h), as well as the possibility of multiplexing. upper respiratory tract infectious disease (URTID) The detection of CRVs in upper respiratory tract fluid specimens, together with symptoms and/or signs and other causes excluded. CRVs in respiratory secretions, preferentially in samples taken from the sites of involvement. demic occurred in 1580 (originating in Asia); it was followed by pandemics in 1729 (Russia), 1781\u20131782 (China), 1830\u20131833 (China), 1898\u20131900 (Russia), 1918\u20131920 (USA), 1957\u20131958 (Yunnan Province, China), 1968\u20131970 (Hong Kong), and 2009\u20132010 (Mexico) the 1918\u20131919 pandemic alone was responsible for an estimated death toll of 50 million (or higher) [21 the 2009 pandemic had 18,631 laboratory-confirmed pandemic deaths reported by the world health organization. however, the total mortality burden was estimated to be 10 to 15 times higher, with a surprisingly high (62\u201382%) percentage of deaths attributed to persons under 65 years of age [32,33] corticosteroid treatment in patients with AH1N1 2009 pandemic influenza was associated with increased risk of superinfections. a meta-analysis reveals a conservative estimation of 33.8 million RSV-related LRTIs worldwide in children younger than 5 years. patients with HSCT evaluated prospectively during a single influenza season in Switzerland showed RSV infection in 7.95% of swabs (21/264 swabs, from a total of 193 patients) shedding of RSV was demonstrated in HSCT recipients in Germany, emphasizing the need for infection control. HSCT recipients 626 transplant recipients of which 27 patients with 29 (4.3%) episodes of any viral RTI, 8 (27.58%) of which were RSV - Other viruses (no. cases): HRV (11), Influenza A (5), HPiV3 (4), HEnV (2), CMV (9) - RSV pneumonia in 2/8 cases, one death, not attributable to infection McCarthy et al., 1999 [51] HSCT recipients 336 transplant recipients, 26 HSCT recipients with URTI are stratified by the ISI into low-risk (score 0\u20132), medium-risk (score 3\u20136) and high-risk (score 7\u201312) categories. no significant increase in morbidity or mortality was identified in patients with HSCT or solid organ transplant versus immune-competent patients. mortality is higher for patients over 60 years or with lymphopenia on admission. seroprevalence studies have indicated primary infection occurs before the age of 5 and virtually all children are infected by the age of 10 [65,66,67,68], with reinfection occurring throughout life [69]. a systematic review including 17 studies showed an incidence of HMPV infections of 5% in hematological malignancy and HSCT patients. human rhinoviruses (HRVs), a group of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, circulate throughout the year and are the most common cause of URTIDs. largely benign in immunocompetent patients, their role in the morbidity and mortality of at-risk populations has only come to attention only in recent years. LRTI was preset at onset in 33% of cases, with progression from URTI to LRTI occurring in 6% of cases. direct impact on mortality was uncertain due to the frequency of copathogens. the importance of HEV infections among hematology patients may have been understated. human coronaviruses (HCoV), belonging to the Coronaviridae family, are large, enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses. the genome of the virus is packed inside a helical capsid and surrounded by an envelope with three associated proteins. their ability for animal to human and rapid interhuman transmission have made them one of the most dangerous respiratory pathogens of the new century. mortality from HCoV LRTI may be higher than originally thought. high viral load, high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning were found to be associated with prolonged viral shedding. a study comparing immunocompetent and immunocompromised children infected with HCoV identified, in multivariable models, younger age, underlying pulmonary disorders, respiratory copathogens and an immunocompromised state as risk factors for LRTI [118] a prospective study evaluating children with cancer diagnosed with viral respiratory infections identified HBoV in 8% of all RTIs where an etiological agent was found. HBoV infection in 6/79 HSCT recipients, 1 of which progressed to LRTI, with 0 fatalities, but with viral copathogens identified in 5/6 cases. the study found HBoV infection in 57.1% of diagnosed LRTIs. fatal outcomes have been known to occur in patients with leukemia and HSCT. the same study identified viral, bacterial, or fungal copathogens in 53% of patients with HPIV-3 pneumonia. 33.8 million episodes (22% of all LRTIs) in children 5 years old 2005 estimates: 66,000\u2013199,000 in children 5 years old 0.3\u201314% (pediatric), 1\u201331% (adult) 32% Host-related; ISI: neutropenia, lymphopenia, age 40 years, graft-versus-host disease, corticosteroid use, myeloablative chemotherapy. 27% in patients who develop HMPV LRTI Host- the development of potent antivirals varies greatly depending on the virus type. neuraminidase inhibitors are the only effective therapeutic agents against influenza infections for nearly two decades. concerns may arise regarding baloxavir marboxil\u2019s low genetic barrier. the majority of patients in which resistance occurred appear to have been infected with the A(H3N2) strain. patients infected with the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain were shown to only develop resistance in 2.2% of cases. nal antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin protein are another avenue of research. MHAA4549A has shown promising results in phase 1 and 2a trials. VIS410 was shown to have favorable effects on symptom resolution and viral replication in adults with uncomplicated influenza A infections. ALS-008176 (lumicitabine), an oral nucleoside analogue prodrug with promising preliminary results [164], started several phase 2 trials studying its efficacy on RSV infections in children and infants. GS-5806 (presatovir), a drug blocking RSV fusion protein [165], has undergone several trials, studying its effects on both general population (NCT02135614) and HSCT recipients with RSV URTI (NCT0225440 vapendavir, a newer capsid binder, recently failed to prove superior to placebo in improving lung function or reducing asthma exacerbations in asthmatic patients. a phase 2 trial studying vapendavir treatment for HSCT patients with RV URTI was planned (NCT03024177), but later withdrawn. neuraminidase inhibitors have been the only effective therapeutic agents against influenza infections for nearly two decades. despite promising initial results, concerns may arise regarding baloxavir marboxil\u2019s low genetic barrier, which seem to have already lead to the emergence of antiviral resistance. the majority of patients in whom resistance occurred appear to have been infected with the A(H3N2) strain, whereas patients infected with the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain were shown to only three potential targets are the PA protein (endonuclease), the PB1 protein (RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase) and the PB2 protein (cap-snatching subunit) Favipiravir (T-705\u2014Toyoma Chemical), a PB1 inhibitor, has shown broad activity against influenza virus, including neuraminase-inhibitor resistant strains. another PB2 inhibitor, CC-42344, is scheduled to a possible general antiviral agent investigated in uncontrolled trials has been aerosolized and/or systemic ribavirin, with or without intravenous immunoglobulin association. this appears to be effective in both preventing progression to LRTI and treatment of pneumonia caused by RSV and HPIV. concerns exist about the limitations of aerosolized ribavirin in regards to environmental exposure and potentially teratogenic effects in pregnant healthcare workers and visitors. AK0529 (ziresovir) [166], an orally bioavailable RSV fusion protein inhibitor, is currently undergoing a phase 2 study on adults with RSV infection in China (NCT03699202). a multicentric study on a pediatric population has been completed, with results upcoming (NCT02654171), a trimeric nanobody that binds to the antigenic site II of the RSV F protein with high affinity. a phase 2 trial studying vapendavir treatment for HSCT patients with RV URTI was planned (NCT03024177), but was later withdrawn. other classes of antiviral agents, including the 3C protease inhibitor rupintrivir, the nucleoside analog inhibitor MK-0608, and the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III (PI4K-III) kinase inhibitor PIK93, dation Strength of Recommendation/Quality of Evidence should be considered BII Patients with hemato-oncological disease and CRV RTID Deferral of conditioning/chemotherapy could be considered BIII Patients undergoing allogenic HSCT or HSCT recipients with RSV URTI. fectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Canada (AMMI) and the CDC make several in-depth, point-by-point recommendations. from general infection control acts (such as droplet and standard precaution) to specific measures (such as targeted therapy with ribavirin or palivizumab in RSV infection or vaccination or neuraminidase treatment in influenza HSCT recipients with adenovirus infection and potential recipient/candidate contact should be placed droplet and standard precautions to prevent transmission AIII HSCT recipients 6 months after HSCT, during community influenza outbreaks that lead to nosocomial outbreaks. systematic management of CRV infections could prove rewarding in terms of outcome improvement in hematology patients."}
