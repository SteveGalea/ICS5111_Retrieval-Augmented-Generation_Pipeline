{"summary": "the worldwide exchange of genome data from viruses causing severe transboundary diseases is urgently needed in human and veterinary medicine. advances in classical molecular techniques such as improved complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis and PCR performance have increased the length and quality of sequence reads achieved by Sanger sequencing. the implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has revolutionized the genetic typing of pathogens in terms of sensitivity and speed. the DB included sequences of short genome fragments, namely a partial 5\u2032 non-translated region (5\u2032NTR, 150 nt), a partial E2 (190 nt) and a partial NS5B (409 nt) encoding fragment. this strategy has been already applied at the EURL CSF for recent molecular epidemiological studies on CSFV [10,11,12]. coding sequences of the CSF-DB catalogue numbers CSF0088, CSF0183, CSF0605, CSF0631, CSF0804, CSF0818, CSF0819, CSF0869, CSF0934, and CSF1040 were included in the CSF-DB. each master entry and each sequence can be stored with a location text like a city or region name. database (DB) design The CSF-DB runs on a Linux server using a MySQL-Server (Version 5.5.50) the web frontend for maintaining, searching, and accessing the separately running genetic typing module is written in PHP (Version 5.4.45). the PHP scripts run on an Apache web server (Version 2.2.22). the original typing module was implemented in Borland Delphi 7 running on a 32 bit Windows environment. the software was recompiled using a 64 bit Windows environment with a Delphi compiler (RAD Studio XE5; Embarcadero, Austin, Texas, USA) the DB already harbors over 1000 sequences of the short E2 fragment and 265 full E2 gene sequences, which were generated and added to promote the use of longer sequence regions in CSFV phylogeny. since 2007, 77 new virus isolates have been included in the DB. the new tool allows the user to search for all outbreak isolates from a given catalogue number related to a country or year of isolation. each outbreak location is displayed by a colored flag, with each color representing a distinct genotype. clicking on the capital symbol of a country provides an overview of available database entries ordered by isolation year and CSFV genotype. the genetic typing module allows phylogenetic analysis of up to ten sequences of choice. newly generated sequences and additional sequences from the DB can be included. newly generated sequences and additional sequences from the DB can be included. the DB contains information on a total amount of 1,075 CSFV isolates stored in the virus collection of the EURL CSF. the DB already harbors over 1000 sequences of the short E2 fragment and 265 full E2 gene sequences. since 2007, 77 new virus isolates have been included in the DB. Sequences of the genome regions NS5B and 5\u2032NTR-E2 are currently rarely used for genetic typing of CSFV. map was generated by selecting the countries Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. clicking on the flagged outbreak location provides additional information including catalogue number (e.g., CSF1053), year of isolation, animal species (domestic pig (dp) or wildboar (wb)), genotype, and location with longitude and latitude coordinates. phylogenetic tree based on complete E2 coding sequences is supported by high bootstrap values at important nodes defining the different subgenotypes or phylogenetic clades. a neighbor-joining tree comprising a pre-defined set of reference sequences and ten additional sequences obtained from endemic CSF disease situations in wild boar in balkan countries between 1998 and 2010. phylogenetic analysis based on the genetically variable E2 fragment (190 nt) gives more reliable and timely results. increasing availability of longer nucleotide sequences, such as the complete E2 gene (1119 nt) and even full genome sequences (12.3 kB, will further improve the possibilities for high-resolution phylogenetic analyses. predefined phylogenetic tree ensures that the dataset is representative for sequences of different genotypes. also, the use of defined genomic regions for genetic typing allows for an easy comparison of phylogenetic trees generated by different laboratories. the approach presented here is easy to use and ensures consistent quality by the same bio-mathematical procedure and the same reference sequence set among all users. can serve as a blueprint for other pathogen-specific databases and sequence analysis platforms."}
