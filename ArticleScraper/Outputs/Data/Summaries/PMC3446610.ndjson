{"summary": "type I interferons (IFNs) are the first line of host immune defense against viral infection. their expression is tightly regulated through IRFs, particularly IRF3 and IRF7 (20, 45) despite its low expression in most cell types, IRF7 plays crucial roles in regulation of type I IFN gene expression. KSHV encodes proteins to counter the actions of IRF7 (5, 6, 25, 60, 66) it is etiologically associated with a number of human cancers, such as Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease (7, 16, 17). a unique temporal and spatial expression gives it a unique advantage in combating host antiviral responses during the very early stages of infection. it allows it to suppress IRF7 activation, block the positive-feedback loop, and prevent expression of IFNs and ISGs. we demonstrated that wild-type KSHV induces little antiviral response. 93T cells and HEK293-TLR3 cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium. iSLK cells expressing doxycycline-inducible replication and transcription activator (RTA) were cultured and maintained as previously described. BAC36-wt, a bacterial artificial chromosome clone that carries the entire KSHV genome (63), and BAC36-stop45, an ORF45-null mutant that carries Rabbit anti-TBK1 antibody was purchased from Millipore. Rat anti-LANA antibody was described previously (64) orF45-S41 antisense, TCGAGCCTGCCAAATCCTGGAAGTGATGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG HEK293T cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were lysed with whole-cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate [Na3VO4], 40 mM -glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 10% glyce cell suspension was sonicated, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. after 30 min of incubation, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min. GST proteins were eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione\u201350 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. immunoprecipitated beads were resuspended in 100 l of TBS plus 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4 and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail. reaction mixtures were kept at 30\u00b0C for 30 min, and reactions stopped by the addition of 2 Laemmli sample buffer. luciferase activity was expressed in arbitrary units by normalization of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity. cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in buffer. cells were fractionated on a superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel column. iSLK cells expressing doxycycline-inducible replication and transcription activator (RTA) were cultured and maintained as previously described. BAC36-wt, a bacterial artificial chromosome clone that carries the entire KSHV genome (63), and BAC36-stop45, an ORF45-null mutant that carries a premature stop codon. Plasmids expressing Flag-IRF7, Flag-IRF3 and Flag-ORF45 were generated by subcloning of the coding sequence into pCMV-TAG3 (Stratagene) Plasmids pKH3-TBK1 and pKH3-IKK were generated by cloning of the cDNA fragments into pKH3 vector. HEK293T cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with whole-blown saline. all clones were sequenced for assurance of accuracy. cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. proteins were eluted by incubation with 150 g/ml 3Flag peptide or 100 g/ml 3HA peptide. the supernatant was incubated with glutathione beads at 4\u00b0C overnight. the eluates were dialyzed in buffer A150 (25 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, and 150 mM NaCl) the protein concentration was determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) the in vitro kinase reaction was performed by incubation of 5 l of IP complexes with 2.5 g GST substrates. reaction mixtures were kept at 30\u00b0C for 30 min, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 Laemmli sample buffer. luciferase activity was expressed in arbitrary units by normalization of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity. the cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in buffer. the sites of human IRF7 direct phosphorylation by IKK and TBK1 were reported to be Ser477 and Ser479 (42). the results were confirmed by our own mutational and functional analyses. we used the phosphorylation-specific antibody anti-pIRF7 (Ser477/479) to examine IKK- and TBK1-induced IRF7 phosphorylation in cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with 100 ng HA-IKK plus 1 g of flag-tagged expression plasmids encoding wild-type IRF7 or the S477A, S479A, or S477/479A mutant. at 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with antibodies as indicated. SHV ORF45 does not interfere with interactions between the kinases and their substrates. we envision three possible scenarios: (i) ORF45 directly inhibits the kinase activity of IKK and TBK1. ORF45 does not interfere with the association between IRF7 and IKK. HEK293T cells were transfected with flag-IRF7-, HA-IKK-, and ORF45. s were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. if ORF45 does not prevent IKK/TBK1 from interacting with IRF7, they all may associate with one another. similar results were obtained with TBK1. the full-length ORF45 protein purified from the baculovirus expression system can be self-phosphorylated in vitro. it is presumably because of tightly associated kinases such as the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase. when ORF45 protein was incubated with IKK or TBK1, its phosphorylation was further increased. lanine in the fragment from aa 116 to 237 abolished the phosphorylation. results indicate that KSHV ORF45 is phosphorylated by IKK and TBK1 on Ser41 and Ser162. basal phosphorylation of ORF45 was detected in HEK293T cells. the level of ORF45 phosphorylation was significantly increased by coexpression of IKK or TBK1. the phosphorylation of ORF45 was reduced by mutation of both Ser41 and Ser162. HEK293T cells were transfected with 5 g of wild-type ORF45 or ORF45-S41A, ORF45-S162A, or ORF45-S41/162A in the absence of 500 ng of HA-IKK expression plasmids. at 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF45 antibody. KSHV ORF45 competitively inhibits phosphorylation of IRF7 by IKK and TBK1. phosphorylation of ORF45 fragments by IKK or TBK1 seems more efficient than that of IRF7. amounts of proteins subjected to in vitro kinase assays with HA-IKK. peptides aligned to consensus substrate phosphorylation motif of IKK. GST-IRF7 (aa 283 to 503) proteins were mixed with increasing amounts of full-length (FL) ORF45 proteins in reactions for in vitro kinase assays. GST-ORF45-S41/162 peptide competitively inhibits phosphorylation of IRF7 by IKK/TBK1 in vitro. GST-IRF7 (aa 283 to 503) proteins were mixed with increasing amounts of GST-ORF45-S41/162 peptide. the assays were performed as described for panel B. a GST fusion peptide that contains both Ser41 and Ser162 inhibited IRF7 phosphorylation at higher concentrations. expression of the same GST fusion peptide had no effect on IRF7 phosphorylation in cells. this suggests that inhibition of IRF7 phosphorylation in cells requires the interaction between ORF45 and IRF7. luciferase reporter assays revealed that the mutant inhibited the transactivation activity of IRF7 less effectively than did the wild-type ORF45. the mutant also apparently bound to IKK/TBK1 as efficiently as did the wild-type ORF45 (Fig. 6D and E) the wild-type ORF45 inhibited IRF7 in a dose-dependent manner. the ORF45-S41/162A mutant had a diminished effect under similar conditions. the critical role of Ser41 and Ser162 of ORF45 in the inhibition of IRF7 suggests that ORF45 inhibits phosphorylation of IRF7 by acting as an alternative substrate. HEK293T cells were transfected with 5 g of Flag-IRF7, 500 ng of HA-IKK, and 10 g of wild-type ORF45 or ORF45-S41/162A mutant expression vectors. at 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 affinity beads. HEK293T cells were transfected with the IFN-1 promoter reporter, IRF7, and 60 ng ORF45 with or without 2 ng IKK expression plasmids. at 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and used for dual-luciferase assays. IRF7 and IRF3 are activated by phosphorylation on the C-terminal serine/threonine residues by IKK and TBK1 (8, 13, 52) the sites of human IRF7 direct phosphorylation by IKK and TBK1 were reported to be Ser477 and Ser479 (42) the results were confirmed by our own mutational and functional analyses. HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 g of flag-tagged IRF7 and 100 ng of HA-IKK/TBK1 or their kinase-dead mutant (S38A) plasmids. at 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with antibodies as indicated. ORF45 does not inhibit phosphorylation of IRF3 by IKK or TBK1. cells were transfected with 1 g Flag-IRF3 together with 100 ng of HA-IKK (E) or HA-TBK1 (F) expression plasmids. pCR3.1-ORF45 does not interfere with interactions between the kinases and their substrates. KSHV ORF45 does not interfere with the interactions between the IKK/TBK1 kinases and their substrates. similar results were obtained with TBK1. these results suggest that ORF45 does not interfere with the association between IRF7 and IKK. lysates of HEK293T cells expressing Flag-IRF7 and HA-IKK in the presence or absence of ORF45 were fractionated on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. if ORF45 does not prevent IKK/TBK1 from interacting with IRF7, they all may associate with one another because IRF7 interacts with both ORF45 and IKK/TBK1. pIRF7 in fractions of lysates of cells expressing no ORF45 peaked. the effect was most obvious in fraction 32, in which the amount of ORF45 protein peaked. the full-length ORF45 protein purified from the baculovirus expression system can be self-phosphorylated in vitro. the full-length ORF45 protein purified from the baculovirus expression system can be self-phosphorylated. replacement of ser41 with alanine in the fragment abolished the phosphorylation. replacement of ser162 with alanine also abolished the phosphorylation. results indicate that KSHV ORF45 is phosphorylated by IKK and TBK1 on Ser41 and Ser162. KSHV ORF45 is phosphorylated by IKK and TBK1 in cells. a phosphorylation-specific antibody to ORF45 is not available. the level of ORF45 phosphorylation was significantly increased by coexpression of IKK or TBK1. HEK293T cells were transfected with 5 g of wild-type ORF45 or ORF45-S41A, ORF45-S162A, or ORF45-S41/162A expression vectors. at 48 h after transfection, cells were prepared, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed as described above. HEK293T cells were transfected with commercially validated siRNAs against TBK1 and IKK. the cells were further transfected with flag-ORF45 expression plasmid 24 h later. KSHV ORF45 competitively inhibits phosphorylation of IRF7 by IKK and TBK1. peptides containing the phosphorylation sites of IRF7 (Ser477/479), ORF45 Ser41, Ser162, and chimeric Ser41/Ser162 were expressed and purified from E. coli. equal amounts of the proteins were subjected to in vitro kinase assays with HA-IKK. IRF7 (1 g), IKK (100 ng), and increasing amounts of FL-ORF45 (100 ng, 500 ng, 2 g, and 4 g) were transfected into HEK293T cells. at 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies as indicated. in vitro kinase assays, phosphorylation of IRF7 on Ser477 and Ser479 was inhibited by ORF45 in a dose-dependent manner. expression of full-length ORF45 also inhibited IRF7 phosphorylation on Ser477/479 in cells in a dose-dependent manner. expression of the same GST fusion peptide had no effect on IRF7 phosphorylation in cells. the wild-type ORF45-S41/162A mutant inhibited IRF7 phosphorylation by IKK and by TBK1. however, the mutant also apparently bound to IKK/TBK1 as efficiently as did the wild-type ORF45. luciferase reporter assays revealed that the mutant inhibited the transactivation activity of IRF7 less effectively than did the wild-type ORF45. fected IRF7 and IFN-1 reporter plasmids into these cells and treated them with doxycycline to initiate KSHV lytic replication. the increase was significantly higher in cells infected by the wild-type ORF45-null mutant, suggesting that ORF45 is required for inhibition of IRF7 during KSHV lytic replication. HEK293T cells were transfected with 5 g of Flag-IRF7, 500 ng of HA-IKK, and 10 g of wild-type ORF45 or ORF45-S41/162A mutant expression plasmids. at 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 affinity beads. the input WCL and IP complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies as luciferase activity expressed in arbitrary units by normalization of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity. hek293T cells were transfected with the IFN-1 promoter reporter, IRF7, and 60 ng ORF45 with or without 2 ng IKK expression plasmids. at 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and used for dual-luciferase assay cytoid dendritic cells are the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of IRF7 and IRF3 after viral infection. we therefore sought to determine whether and how ORF45 inhibits IRF7 phosphorylation by IKK and TBK1 by acting as an alternative substrate. the interactions are exploited by a number of viruses as strategies for inhibition of activation of IKK and TBK1. other viral proteins, like ORF45, are found to be phosphorylated by IKK/TBK1 including the P protein of Borna disease virus (58), VP35 of Ebola virus (44), and the V proteins of several paramyxoviruses (36). ORF45 acts as a better substrate in in vitro kinases assays. it inhibits IRF7 phosphorylation specifically and has little effect on IRF3 phosphorylation in cells. ORF45 appears to act as a scaffold by interacting with both IRF7 and IKK/TBK1. phosphorylation sites (Ser41 and Ser 162) of ORF45 might be more accessible to the kinases than those of IRF7. ORF45 selectively inhibits IRF7 phosphorylation but spares the IKK/TBK1 kinases themselves. both IKK and TBK1 have been identified as products of tumor genes that have transforming potential."}
