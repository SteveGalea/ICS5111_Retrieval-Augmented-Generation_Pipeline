{"summary": "DDX5 is a prototypical member of the large Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD)-box ATP-dependent RNA helicases family. it has extensive amino acid sequence homology in various organisms from Escherichia coli to humans. the protein plays multifunctional roles involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism. DDX5 RNA or DNA helicases are categorized based on the substrates they bind. dEAD box polypeptide 5 (DDX5) enhances virus proliferation. IBV-CoV nsp13 Enhances virus proliferation. dEAD-box helicase family is named for its conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp motif. DDX5 is a 68 kD helicase with 614 amino acids in its full length. the Q motif is named for the conserved glutamine residue present in more than 99% of DEAD-box helicase sequences. DDX5 also contains a Arg-Gly-Ser-Arg-Gly (RGS-RGG) motif and an Ile-Gln (IQ) motif. the motif can function as an RNA-binding site to interact with RNA or DDX3 for modulating biological functions. nsp13 characterizes the enzymatic activities that can unwind both RNA and DNA duplexes. host RNA helicases may be hijacked by viruses to facilitate replication of their viral genome. DDX5 may act as a coactivator to enhance viral genome transcription and virus proliferation. recruitment of DDX1 to the phosphorylated-N-containing complex mediated by N phosphorylation can facilitate template readthrough and longer subgenomic mRNA synthesis. main role of DDX1 and DDX5 when hijacked by coronavirus is to positively modulate viral genome transcription and virus proliferation. more than 300 cellular factors have been identified that may be involved in this process. DDX3 is recruited to the trans-activation responsive hairpin by interaction with viral Tat to facilitate HIV-1 mRNA transcription and translation [57,58]. DDX5 was found to be a new co-factor of HIV-1 that interacted with HIV-1 Rev through the RRE axis, suggesting its specific links to HIV-1 replication [50] DDX5 and DDX17 exist as homo- or heterodimers to be used by HIV but function in different phases of the virus\u2019 lifecycle. other RNA helicases, including DDX1, DDX21, and DDX56, also have been shown to associate with HIV-1 Rev and to stimulate the Rev function. DDX5 Is Involved in the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Life Cycle Hepatitis C, a contagious liver disease, is caused by HCV, which belongs to a positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. at least 10 proteins are encoded by the positive single-stranded 9.6 kb RNA genome of HCV, including three structural proteins (the core protein and envelope (E) proteins E1 and DDX5 is redirected from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in Huh7 cells infected with cell culture-produced HCV (HCVcc). the first 51 residues of N-terminal fragment are variable, suggesting the highly dynamic interaction between DDX5 and NS5B in infected cells. the increased HCV RNA in the DDX5 siRNA treated cells did not cause increased production of cell-free infectious virus particles. this finding may indicate that DDX5 was involved in a regulatory role at a later stage of the HCV life cycle. DDX5 was also found to be interacted with the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of HCV. a single-strand positive-sense RNA encodes a single polyprotein composed of three structural proteins and seven non-structural (NS) proteins in the order 5\u2032-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2a-NS2b-NS3-NS4a-NS4b-NS5-3\u2032. the seven C-terminal non-structural proteins (NS1\u2013NS5) are involved in multiple steps of viral life cycles such as RNA replication, virus assembly, and innate NS3 and NS5 functions as RNA helicase, RNA triphosphatase, and RNA-stimulated nucleoside triphosphatase. DDX5 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm to regulate RNA translation. no drugs or molecule inhibitors targeting DDX5 are available. pestiviruses contain single-stranded RNA genomes of 12.3\u201312.5 kb. they are co- and post-translationally processed from a single RNA into four structural and eight nonstructural proteins. the genus Pestivirus belongs to the family Flavivirus, which cause economically important diseases of farm animals. PRRSV contains a single-strand, positive-sense RNA of approximately 15 kb in length, composed of at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs) and a poly-A tail at the 3\u2032-terminus. ORF1a and ORF1b encode the replication-related polymerase proteins. nsp9 is involved in viral replication and genomic transcription. dEAD and helicase domains (aa1-436) of DDX5 bind with the C-terminal portion of nsp9. PRRSV carries its own helicase, nsp10, with helicase activity. recruitment of host DDX5 by nsp9 may function as a cofactor for RNA unwinding, export, and/or translation of PRRSV. DDX5 colocalizes with viral NPs in the nucleus during viral RNA replication and transcription. DDX17 has been found to colocalize with H5N1 NPs in the nucleus. in uninfected cells, DDX17 exhibits as punctated. immunoprecipitation identified DDX5 as an interacting partner of EBNA2. DDX5 may serve as methylation substrate to facilitate gene expression activation by EBNA2. but the relevance of EBNA2-DDX5 interaction and functions during virus infection remains elusive. DDX5 depletion upregulated DDX17 expression, restricting bunyavirus infection in an interferon-independent manner. DDX5 has a role in transcription of HBV minichromosome by a mechanism not yet determined. DDX5 is also the causative agent of chronic hepatitis. dx21, DHX33, DHX36, DDX41, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I/DDX58) and melanoma differentiation- associated gene 5 (MDA-5) these helicases are characterized by caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD) at the N-terminal region, which interact with other CARD-containing proteins to transduce the signaling cascade. no literature indicates the function of host RNA helicases may be hijacked by viruses to facilitate replication of their viral genome. nsp13 gene used as a probe for two-hybrid screening in yeast and mammalian cells. inhibition of DDX5 results in suppression of viral replication. human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus of the lentivirus genus with an RNA genome of 9 kb. nine polypeptides are encoded by the genome RNA, containing three structural proteins Env (envelope), Gag (group-specific antigen) and Pol (polymerase); four accessory proteins, Nef, Vif, Vpu, and Vpr; and the regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev. DDX3 is recruited to the trans-activation responsive (TAR) hairpin by interaction with viral Tat to facilitate HIV-1 mRNA transcription and translation. DDX5 was found to be a new co-factor of HIV-1 that interacted with HIV-1 Rev through the Rev response element (RRE) axis, and thus affects Rev function to enhance HIV-1 replication [17]. DDX5 is involved in the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) life cycle. hepatitis C is caused by HCV, which belongs to a positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. other RNA helicases, including DDX1, DDX21, and DDX56, also associate with HIV-1 Rev. at least 10 proteins encoded by the positive single-stranded 9.6 kb RNA genome of HCV. NS5B can transcribe the positive- and negative-strand RNA genome of the virus. NS5B has been shown to interact with a mass of host proteins through yeast two-hybrid screening. the first 51 residues of DDX5 are variable, which could fold back to block one of the NS5B binding sites. previous studies have shown that knockdown of DDX5 by RNAi in 293 cells reduced the synthesis of negative-strand HCV RNA, suggesting that DDX5 may be beneficial to the synthesis of the HCV genome (HCV-S1 strain) the knockdown of DDX5 results in reduction viral translation efficiency. but has no effect on HCV replicon, suggesting the essential roles of DDX5 in HCV replication. further investigations and studies should aim to elucidate the precise role of DDX5 in HCV replication. core (C), premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins (NS1\u2013NS5) are components of extracellular mature virus particles. recently, it has been shown that DDX5 can interact with JEV core protein (C), NS3 and NS5 and can host DDX5 act as a positive regulator for JEV replication. both knockdown of DDX5 and overexpression of DDX5 mutants lacking helicase activity can decrease JEV replication. NS5 works as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and methyltransferase. the viral proteins bind the 3\u2032-untranslated region and lead to the formation of replication complex (RC) DDX5 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm to increase the efficiency of RNA separation. ed RNA genomes of approximately 12.3\u201312.5 kb are co-translationally processed from a single RNA into four structural and eight nonstructural proteins in the order NH2-Npro-C-Erns-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS5B-COOH [90,91] Npro is a 168-amino-acid autoprotease, with cysteine protease activity in a nsp9 possesses a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain in its C-terminal portion that contributes to its polymerase activity and the virulence of PRRSV. overexpression of DDX5 in MARC-145 cells showed an enhancement effect on the replication of PRRSV; meanwhile, silencing of DDX5 expression in MARC-145 cells might significantly inhibit the replication of viruses. influenza virus is a major public health problem, causing seasonal epidemics in humans and occasionally lethal global pandemics. as many as 500 million people a year are infected with influenza A virus worldwide, with more than 500,000 deaths. DDX5 and DDX17 colocalize with viral NPs in the nucleus. influenza viruses have evolved to hijack host DDX5 and/or DDX17 in order to facilitate their own proteins\u2019 nuclear export. infections cause no symptoms in young children but result in the development of infectious mononucleosis at adolescence or later. myxoma virus exhibits rabbit-restricted host tropism but reveals a much broader cellular host range in cultured cells. a siRNA library screen targeting the 58 human RNA helicases has shown that DDX5 knockdown enhances MYXV replication. the knockdown of DDX5 in multiple human cell lines increased MYXV replication and enhanced foci size and virus spread. DDX5 regulates PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2) stability and function, represses HBV minichromosome and expression of specific host genes involved in HBV-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis [23,115] DDX5 was downregulated and leads to the degradation of SUZ12, which results in the transcription viral cccDNA-encoded genes. DDX5 lacks the CARD signaling domains, and no literature indicates the function of DDX5 in regulating the production of type I interferon. the issue of whether DDX5 contributes to antiviral responses or regulation of innate immune responses remains uncertain, and more studies are needed. emerging studies on DDX5 have supplemented our knowledge about multiple functions of DDX5 in recent years. however, the overall picture remains fragmentary. research is still needed to resolve seemingly contradictory data on the role(s) of DDX5 in response to different virus."}
