{"summary": "floods are the most common natural disaster worldwide and specifically in Europe. between 1997 and 2006, the number of global flood events doubled. a flood is defined as the overflow of areas that are not normally submerged with water or a stream that has broken its normal confines or has accumulated due to lack of drainage. despite the occurrence of two flood events exceeding the 100-y flood level in 1997 and 2002, no increased trend in extreme flood frequency over recent decades. both climatic and non-climatic impacts, such as land-use dynamics, are expected to influence future flooding in Europe. flood-affected areas serve as ideal breeding grounds for pathogens and may alter vector breeding grounds and zoonotic reservoirs. flood-affected areas serve as ideal breeding grounds for pathogens and may alter vector breeding grounds and zoonotic reservoirs. giardia, hanta virus infections, health, health effect*, health impact*, hemorrhagic fever, hepatitis A, hepatitis E, illness, infectio*, infectious disease*, japanese encephalitis, legionellosis, leptospirosis, lyme disease, lymphatic filariasis, malaria, morbidity, mosquito*, norovirus, naeg*, exclusion criteria Papers concerned primarily with mental health effects, flood-related injuries, population displacement, economic costs, and disruption of food supplies. most of the data was observational, and because of insufficient numbers of similar studies, and variation in outcome reporting no studies were excluded on the basis of study quality. 106 full-text articles were examined in more detail for eligibility. 38 peer-reviewed articles were found to fit the inclusion criteria. increased infectious disease transmission and outbreaks following global flood events have been documented. the most common water-borne pathogens to be identified following flooding were vibrio spp. the most common water-borne pathogens to be identified following flooding were campylobacter, followed by vibrio spp. studies have implicated excess rainfall in water-borne disease outbreaks. the risk of gastroenteritis was significantly associated with depth of flooding in people whose households were flooded. an outbreak of norovirus in american tourists was linked to direct exposure to floodwater contaminated with raw sewage in Germany. the rates of serologically confirmed cases of leptospirosis were three times higher than usual at 0.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants. the first leptospirosis outbreak in Austria in July 2010 involved four athletes who swam in recreational waters during a triathlon. seven out of 44 subjects exposed to floodwaters exhibited anti-Leptospira specific IgM antibodies. five were confirmed positive by micro-agglutination test. the rate for seroconversion for leptospirosis appeared to be low. flooding may initially wash out vector populations, but they return when the waters recede. vector-borne diseases are likely to have mid-term to long-term impacts on health following flooding. in 1997, heavy rains in moravia, Czech Republic resulted in flooding. mosquito populations in the area amplified immediately. environmental factors such as flooding can facilitate re-emergence of WNV. household interventions were more effective in preventing diarrhea than interventions at the water-source. hand-washing interventions reduced diarrhea episodes by one-third. rodent control is another prevention measure that needs to be considered. the frequency of infectious diseases can increase in the weeks to months after flooding. however, there remains scientific uncertainty about the strength of association between infectious disease incidence and flooding. floods can cause population displacement and changes in population density, raise concern about waste management and the availability of clean water. many studies attempted to collect retrospective data, had methodological shortcomings, lacked longitudinal data/baseline health data, and control groups for comparison. many studies relied on data from disease surveillance systems. population displacement can distort rates of comparison for infectious disease incidence. there are clear research needs to improve the understanding of the association between infectious diseases and flooding. more robust epidemiological studies on infectious diseases covering the pre-, mid-, and post-flood periods. extreme torrential rain (> 350mm) a significant risk factor for enteroviruses (RR = 5.981; 95% CI 1.474\u201323.760) and bacillary dysentery (RR = 7.703; 95% CI 1.53\u20132.52) cholera cases positively correlated with 24-h cumulative rainfall. 5 cases reported excess flooding of homes and 0 had traditional risk factors for melioidosis. all cases survived. dehydration seen in 2007 compared with 2004 and 1998 (p 0.001). findings showed alterations in clinical features and phenotypic changes of major bacterial pathogens. cholera cases 5.9 times higher (95% CI 5\u20137) and non-cholera cases 1.8 times higher than expected. those without microbiologically identifiable V. cholerae (OR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.23\u20132.14; p = 0.001) more likely to have severe dehydration during floods than during non-flood periods. median of 17.5 d for epidemics to end after rivers fell below flood stage. 93 (69 typhoid and 24 paratyphoid) enteric fever cases compared with 289 non-enteric fever patient controls. house flooding a signicant risk factor for paratyphoid fever; when paratyphoid group was compared with community control. 6 patients identified with history of contact with contaminated soil/water. 5/6 patients (83%) suffered from leptospirosis after typhoon. of 236 suspected cases admitted, 105 tested with Dip-S-Tick IgM ELISA. 7/44 patients exposed to floodwaters exhibited anti-Leptospira specific IgM antibodies and 5 confirmed positive. re-testing months later found significant antibody titers > 100 against serovar Copenhangeni in 3 cases. rates of reported and serologically confirmed cases of leptospirosis 3 times higher with specific morbidity. 94 confirmed cases in 1997 and 92 confirmed cases in 2002. two-thirds from inundation areas, half directly associated with floodwater. average number of acute schistosomiasis cases recorded in flood years 2.8 times higher than in years with little to no flooding. re-emerging and new snail infested areas in flood years on average 2.6 and 2.7 times larger than in years with normal water levels."}
