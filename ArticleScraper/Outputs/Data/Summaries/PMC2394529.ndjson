{"summary": "Graphical displays of results allow researchers to summarise and communicate key findings of their study. results We identified 57 primary studies and 49 systematic reviews. ROC plots were the most common type of plot included in systematic reviews. test result + a b - c d Sensitivity a/(a + c) - Proportion of true positives that are correctly identified by the test Likelihood ratio (LR) Describes how may times a person with disease is more likely to receive a particular test result than a person without disease. the more common a disease is, the more likely it is that a positive test result is right and a negative result is wrong. the more common a disease is, the more likely it is that a positive test result is right and a negative result is wrong. the CA-19-9 antigen test to diagnose pancreatic cancer is an example of continuous data. it is also possible to construct similar graphs for categorical test results. for smaller numbers of categories, similar information can be conveyed using paired bar charts/histograms. ROC plots show how estimated sensitivity and specificity vary according to the threshold chosen. sensitivity and specificity corresponding to a threshold of 39.3 are 74% and 90% respectively. sensitivity and specificity corresponding to a threshold of 39.3 are 74% and 90% respectively. design of the study and provide information on the numbers of participants at each stage of the study as well as the results of the study. the diagram does not show the design (diagnostic case-control) and results of the study. ROC plots and summary ROC (SROC) curves can be used to present the results of diagnostic systematic reviews. each point typically represents a separate study or data set within a study. unless there are very few studies, it is not feasible to display confidence intervals as the plot would become cluttered. graphical displays aim to put results of diagnostic test evaluations into clinical context. probability ratio nomogram (Figure 4a) and probability-modifying plot (Figure 4b) each allows the reader to estimate the post-test probability of the target condition in an individual patient, based on a selected pre-test probability. we used data from a study of the biochemical tumour marker CA-19-9 antigen to diagnose pancreatic cancer to construct these graphs. a. Dot plot. b. Box-and-whisker plot. c. ROC Plot. d. Flow diagram. Box and whisker plots summarise these distributions. a test that provides no diagnostic information (AUC = 0.5) will produce a straight line from the bottom left to the top right. a test that provides no diagnostic information (AUC = 0.5) will produce a straight line from the bottom left to the top right. ROC plots show how estimated sensitivity and specificity vary according to the threshold chosen. ROC plots are thought to be difficult to interpret as they describe the characteristics of the test in a way which does not relate directly to its usefulness in clinical practice. the STARD (standards for reporting of diagnostic accuracy) statement recommends the inclusion of a flow diagram in all reports of primary diagnostic accuracy studies. forest plots are commonly used to display results of meta-analysis. they display results from the individual studies together with a summary (pooled) estimate. the pooled estimate is displayed as a diamond whose centre represents the estimate and tips the confidence interval. results for several tests can be displayed on the same plot. it is also possible to display pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. ROC plots may also be used to investigate possible explanations for differences in estimates of accuracy between studies. probability ratio nomogram (Figure 4a) and probability-modifying plot (Figure 4b) each allows the reader to estimate the post-test probability of the target condition in an individual patient, based on a selected pre-test probability. the probability-modifying plot depicts separate curves for positive and negative test results. box and whisker plots summarise these distributions. the central box covers the interquartile range with the median indicated by the line within the box. the whiskers extend either to the minimum and maximum values or to the most extreme values within 1.5 interquartile ranges of the quartiles. sensitivity (true positive rate) is plotted against 1-specificity. each point represents a different threshold in the same group of patients. sloping lines are used for continuous test results while sloping lines are used for ordered categories. ROC curves may be derived directly from the observed sensitivity and specificity corresponding to different test thresholds. the STARD (standards for reporting of diagnostic accuracy) statement recommends the inclusion of a flow diagram in all reports of primary diagnostic accuracy studies. this should illustrate the design of the study and provide information on the numbers of participants at each stage of the study. the pooled estimate is displayed as a diamond whose centre represents the estimate and tips the confidence interval. for diagnostic accuracy studies, measures of test performance are plotted on the horizontal axis. paired forest plots do not directly display the inverse association between the two measures that commonly results from variations in threshold between studies. studies that included an inappropriate patient spectrum grossly overestimated both sensitivity and specificity. other plots Various other graphical methods have been developed to display the results of systematic reviews. the probability-modifying plot depicts separate curves for positive and negative test results. the reader draws a vertical line from the selected pre-test probability to the appropriate likelihood ratio line and then reads the post-test probability off the vertical scale. number of primary studies identified from the journals searched together with the number of studies from each journal that included graphical displays Journal Number of studies Number with graphs (%) Clinical Chemistry 25 18 (72) American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology 1 0 (0) Annals of Internal Medicine 6 3 (50) BMJ 3 0 (0) European Journal of Pediatrics 1 0 (0) Gastroenterology 7 4 (57) JAMA 5 2 (40) the majority of studies using these types of plots were of laboratory tests. an ROC curve was displayed in 15 (26%) studies. only two provided any indication of the thresholds corresponding to one or more points. primary diagnostic accuracy studies published in 2004, identified by hand searching 12 journals, and diagnostic systematic reviews published in 2003, identified from DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) searches were conducted in 2005 and so these years were the most complete available years for searching. three of the eight systematic reviews that assessed clinical examination looked at whether a variety of signs or symptoms were present or absent. none of the tests evaluated in any of the primary studies were truly dichotomous: they all gave continuous or categorical results. systematic reviews ROC plots included in 22 (45%) reviews. twenty showed individual study estimates of sensitivity and specificity, 14 fitted SROC curves. one study added a box and whisker plot to each axis to show distributions of sensitivity and specificity. use of summary estimates in this way is questionable in the context of reviews of diagnostic accuracy studies. it is particularly problematic if the summary estimate is the only information conveyed in a graphic. inclusion of some form of graphical presentation of test accuracy data has a number of advantages compared to not using such displays. journal guidelines and the STARD statement need to encourage the use of graphs in reports of test accuracy. graphical displays of diagnostic accuracy data should convey both diagnostic accuracy and predictive value. graphical displays are currently underused in primary diagnostic accuracy studies and systematic reviews of such studies. aere V, Bali M, Winant C, Coppens E, et al.
