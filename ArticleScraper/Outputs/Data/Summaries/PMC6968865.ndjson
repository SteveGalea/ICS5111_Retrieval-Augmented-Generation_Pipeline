{"summary": "the family flaviviridae and alphaviridae contain a diverse group of pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. a novel chemistry, 3base, simplifies the viral nucleic acids allowing the design of RT-PCR assays capable of pan-family identification. flaviviruses typically contain a positive sense single-stranded RNA genome of 10-11kb in length. the genome encodes 3 structural proteins (Capsid, prM, and Envelope) and 8 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5 and NS5B) at the genomic level alphaviruses consist of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome 11 to 12kb in length with a 5\u2019 cap, and 3\u2019 poly-A tail. alphavirus particles are enveloped, have a size of around 70 nm in diameter under the electron microscope and appear to be spherical with a 40 nm isometric nucleocapsid. notable viruses that infect the human population include chikung the most accurate method to diagnose viral agents is real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primer and probe sequences complementary to the viral RNA are designed and cycled through a series of steps with positive samples seen as amplification curves. this process can be completed in less than 1 hour, which significantly assists in patient management. the 3base protocol deaminates all cytosine residues in nucleic acids to a uracil intermediate. this process makes closely related species more similar at the genomic level. this novel method ultimately means that primers and probe sets can be designed that have fewer mismatches and are able to hybridise to previously heterogeneous target regions. operative Services, Planning and Policy approved the study. all adults provided verbal consent either for themselves or for their children to be included in the study.

PCR amplification was carried out using either the Biorad CFX96/384 (Biorad, Hercules, USA) or the MIC (Biomolecular Systems, Sydney, Australia) platforms. disease incidence for any given island was compared to the average incidence for the whole country using the z-score test for two population proportions. bp DNA sequences contain the identical primer and probe binding sites that are present in the viral nucleic acids of the target virus. the size of the amplicons is the same as those amplified in the viral nucleic acids to ensure results generated are consistent with what would occur in the native virus.

Fig 3 shows the results obtained using the pan-alphavirus assay. results obtained using the pan-alphavirus assay (Cycle threshold (Ct) from a single PCR replicate. LLOD was defined as the lowest dilution in which all ten PCR replicates gave a positive signal. the whole viral samples performed better than the purified RNAs when diluted in human serum. LLOD for each viral target of the assay was 0.63 copies per PCR. a total of 187 samples were tested during the 2016\u20132017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. the original testing algorithm consisted of screening each sample for pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue only. no molecular tests were available at port Vila Central hospital for the detection of dengue virus. samples previously tested for NS1 antigen/IgG and IgM were obtained from patients in the months December 2016 to February 2017. 187 samples were tested during the 2016\u20132017 Vanuatu dengue-2 outbreak. the original testing algorithm consisted of screening each sample for pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue only. a total of 187 samples were tested (Table 5) during the 2016\u20132017 outbreak. Fig 6 shows the number of dengue infections by age and the age of the general population. results generated have shown that the 3base assay is able to sensitively and specifically detect the presence of flavivirus, alphavirus and dengue using synthetic constructs, whole viral RNA, whole viral particles and contrived clinical samples. RT-PCR assays can be designed to specifically target individual serotypes. however, very few assays are able to target all the members of complex groups such as flavivirus or alphavirus using a single primer and probe set. both flavivirus and alphaviruses show a different global distribution with viruses such as YFV endemic in africa. the pan-flavivirus assay was able to detect DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, ZIKV, YFV, WNV and TBEV down to 13 copies per reaction for most viruses. LLOD studies were conducted using whole intact viral particles that had been inactivated in order to render them non-infectious. parainfluenza-3, parainfluenza-4A, Respiratory Syncytial virus (subtype A), rhinovirus and Varicella Zoster virus. positive and extraction controls gave the desired signals. QCMD panels for DENV, ZIKV virus and CHIKV from 2016\u20132018 were obtained to monitor the performance of the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue assays. the case fatality from dengue has dropped from 6.62/100 in 2002 to 0/100 in 2010. there have been no Chickungunya and only one Zika case recorded on the islands. there are 2 main referral hospitals in the region; port Vila Central is the largest referral hospital in the region. the MIC is a 48 well 4-colour instrument that takes around 2 hours to complete a run using the pan-flavivirus/pan-alphavirus/pan-dengue/DENV-2 assays. total turn-around time from sample to result is in the order of 3 hours 30 minutes. in total, 187 patient samples with suspected DENV infection were processed using the system. of these, 116 gave triple pan-flavivirus, pan-dengue virus and DENV-2 positive results (62%) 7 samples that were positive only for the pan-dengue assay but all these samples gave very weak PCR signals with Ct values greater than 40. the islands of aniwa (P = 0.0035), Ambae (P0.00001), Tongoa (P0.00001), and Emae (P0.00001) had a higher number of positive cases than would be expected from the number of residents alone. the islands of aniwa (P = 0.0035), ambae (P0.00001), and ambae (P0.00001) had a higher number of positive cases than would be expected from the number of residents. the pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue assays have a high sensitivity and specificity when using whole viral nucleic acids and intact viral particles. the assay performed well, if not better than other assays used in laboratories worldwide when tested on confirmed reference materials and international standards."}
