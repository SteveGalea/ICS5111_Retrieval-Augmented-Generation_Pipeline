{"summary": "severe sepsis has a population prevalence of 300/100 000 in the united states. severe sepsis has already been acknowledged as the first cause of death in noncoronary ICUs with a high mortality rate of approximately 25\u201350%. pathogens in Sepsis Defensins have broad spectrum antimicrobial activities against most pathogens in sepsis. they are constitutively expressed in human neutrophils or intestinal Paneth cells (human defensin [HD] 5-6). they can inhibit a large variety of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and some species of fungi and viruses. defensins kill bacteria by inhibiting synthesis of bacterial cell wall. antimicrobial action appears to be regulated by the redox response. -defensin-1 become more potent after reduction of disulfide bridges by thioredoxin. recombinant -defensin-2 could downregulate expression of ICAM-1 in lung tissue 24 h, 36 h, and 72 h after CLP. recombinant -defensin-2 could downregulate expression of ICAM-1 in lung tissue 24 h, 36 h, and 72 h after CLP. preterm neonates had lower level of -defensin-2 in cord blood compared to term neonates. rhesus macaque -defensin (RTD), which has six subtypes, has been extensively studied. rhesus macaque -defensin (RTD), which has six subtypes, has been extensively studied. knock-out animal model is one of the most convincing means to determine the role of a specific molecule in the physiopathology of a certain disease. however, as members of the defensin family have overlapped biological functions, the function of the knock-out gene may probably be compensated by other defensins. genetic association analysis is a good alternative that can effectively explore the relationship between genetic polymorphism and sepsis. \u201344G allele closely related with susceptibility to severe sepsis and poor outcome. individuals with haplotype \u201320A/\u201344C/\u201352G were less susceptible to severe sepsis. -defensin-1 may be an influential factor in immune defense. copy number variation (CNV) is a kind of genetic polymorphism that accounts for approximately 12% of human genomic DNA. it refers to a large-scale duplication or deletion of certain DNA sections, which causes a variation in the number of copies of one or more genes. 179 severe sepsis and 233 healthy controls for DEFA1 and DEFA3. chemoattracting and immunomodulating effects make defensins a double-edged sword in the pathogenesis of sepsis. recent investigations showed that the chemoattractant and antimicrobial activities of defensins could be separated, which shed light on the design of defensin-derived pharmaceuticals."}
