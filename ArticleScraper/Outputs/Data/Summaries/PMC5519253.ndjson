{"summary": "alphavirus M1 is a naturally existing oncolytic virus with significant anticancer activity against different kinds of cancer (eg, liver cancer, bladder cancer, and colon cancer) the number of new cases is expected to rise by about 70% over the next 2 decades. no clinical, biochemical, immunological, or medical evidence of toxicity was found. cynomolgus macaques suggested the safety of intravenous administration of oncolytic virus M1 in cancer patients in the future. cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) was shown as an ideal animal species for virus infection study. in the first round of administration, five experimental macaques were intravenously injected with six times of oncolytic virus M1 (1109 PFU/dose) in 1 week. the last two rounds of injections were further completed in the following months. the number of new cases is expected to rise by about 70% over the next 2 decades. the number of new cases is expected to rise by about 70% over the next 2 decades. development of novel therapeutic agents is urgently needed for clinical cancer therapy. GMSCs have the capacity to inhibit immune responses and control the development and severity of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice that is dependent on CD39/CD73 signaling pathway and partially on the induction of CD4+CD39+FoxP3+ Treg cells. GMSCs dramatically and directly inhibited NF-B and RANKL-mediated osteoclast formation, as well as bone erosion. rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic symmetrical autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation that affects the small diarthrodial joints. GMSCs have the capacity to inhibit immune responses and control the development and severity of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) the infusion of GMSC can markedly inhibit human PBMCs-initiated xenogenic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) this effect requests the CD39/CD73 and IDO signals.

GMSCs are significantly better than bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. many viruses encode deubiquitinating enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. many viruses encode deubiquitinating enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. vDUBs are responsible for cleaving the viral replicase polyproteins during replication. crystallization studies further revealed critical molecular interactions between UbVs and MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs. expression of UbVs during MERS-CoV infection reduced infectious progeny titers by more than four orders of magnitude. many viruses encode deubiquitinating enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. a variety of viral DUBs (vDUBs) are responsible for cleaving the viral replicase polyproteins during replication, and are thus critical components of the viral replication cycle. we report the use of phage-displayed ubiquitin variant (UbV) libraries to rapidly identify potent and highly selective protein-based inhibitors targeting the DUB domains of MERS-CoV and CCHFV. our results thereby establish a strategy to produce protein-based inhibitors that could protect against a diverse range of viruses by providing UbVs via mRNA or protein delivery technologies. funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. many viruses encode deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. many viruses encode deubiquitinating enzymes that are critical for viral replication. phage-displayed ubiquitin variant libraries are used to rapidly identify potent and highly selective protein-based inhibitors targeting the DUB domains of MERS-CoV and CCHFV. UbVs bound the vDUBs with high affinity and specificity to inhibit deubiquitination, deISGylation and in case of MERS-CoV also viral replicative polyprotein processing. the funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis. the relationship between biofilm formation ability and antibiotics resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii Fei LIN1, Bing-jie DU1, Gao CAN1, Xu JIA2, Bao-dong LING1,*. the clinical isolates have strong biofilm ability on the surface of polypropylene than glasses, showing the strong biofilm ability on the shaking condition than stable. the biofilm formation could lead to bacterial resistance to antibiotics and clinical therapy failure. clinical isolates have strong biofilm ability on the surface of polypropylene than glasses, showing the strong biofilm ability on the shaking condition than stable. the biofilm formation could lead to the bacterial resistance to antibiotics and clinical therapy failure. ine and colistin resistance ratio increased from 0 to 15.38%. the other 10 antibiotics resistance ratio increased to 100%. MIC values for 12 antibacterial ranged from 1 to 1024. A. baumannii showed different levels of reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine, benzalkonium bromide, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide. the ratios of 11 reported biocide resistant genes in A. baumannii were above 68.09%, and 100% for adeJ, abeD, fabI and aceI. study aimed to investigate molecular resistant characteristics of A. baumannii to biocides. forty-seven clinical isolates were collected and their susceptibility to commonly used biocides was tested. clone complex (CC) 92 was the major clone spread in hospitals. 2 isolates belonged to pulsotype A, 3 isolates belonged to pulsotype B. fabI and aceI displayed different expressions between higher and lower isolates. the incidence of biocide resistance genes was analyzed through polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. the results revealed that A. baumannii showed different levels of reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine, benzalkonium bromide, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, especially extensive resistance to triclosan. nAChR mediate Fas demethylation and upregulated Fas apoptotic pathway contribute to prenatal nicotine exposure-induced thymocyte apoptosis. prenatal cigarette smoke exposure has been reported to increase thymocyte apoptosis and result in postnatal immune impairments. nicotine increased 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression, activated Fas apoptotic pathway and promoted thymocyte apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. nicotine could induce Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) 2 expression and Fas promotor demethylation, which can be abolished by TET2 siRNA transfection. nicotine is one of the leading candidates in cigarette smoke for causing immune cell apoptosis. however, whether prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) induce thymocyte apoptosis remains unclear. prenatal cigarette smoke exposure has been reported to increase thymocyte apoptosis and result in postnatal immune impairments. the results showed that PNE caused immune impairments in female offspring on postnatal day (PND) 49. nicotine increased 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression, activated Fas apoptotic pathway, and promoted thymocyte apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. nicotine could induce Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) 2 expression and Fas promotor demethylation, which can be abolished by TET2 siRNA transfection. patients with rheumatoid arthritis (63 cases), systemic lupus erythematosus (65 cases), and ankylosing spondylitis (26 cases). MANF transcription levels were elevated in PBWC and synovial tissues in rabbit osteoarthritis induced by methylated bovine serum albumin and rat rheumatoid arthritis. MANF is an ER stress inducible secretory protein and has protective effects against various neural injuries. mRNAs were up-regulated in the peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (63 cases), systemic lupus erythematosus (65 cases), and ankylosing spondylitis (26 cases) MANF inhibited p65-mediated transcriptional activation by interfering with the binding of p65 to its target genes promoters. MANF suppressed the expressions of NF-B-dependent target genes and the proliferation of inflammatory synoviocytes. this suggests that MANF may be a negative regulator of inflammation. response element activated MANF transcription by using luciferase reporter gene technology. tunicamycin, LPS, or TNF caused MANF to re-localize to the nuclei. MANF inhibited p65-mediated transcriptional activation by interfering with the binding of p65 to its target genes promoters. the colon tissue 1.0 cm distal to the cecum was ligated and punctured once with a no. 16 steel needle. the results showed day 1 after the CLP surgery was the turning point of over-inflammation to immunosuppression. AS protects CLP immunosuppression mice against sepsis by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine release. CLP mice model was carried out, and then the influence of artesunate (AS) and its underlying mechanisms were investigated using this model. the results showed day 1 after the CLP surgery was the turning point of over-inflammation to immunosuppression. the colon tissue 1.0 cm distal to the cecum was ligated and punctured once with a no. 16 steel needle to establish CLP mice model. the results showed day 1 after the CLP surgery was the turning point of over-inflammation to immunosuppression."}
