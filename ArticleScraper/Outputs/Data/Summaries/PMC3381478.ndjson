{"summary": "ADEM is characterized by widespread demyelination that involves the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. one case of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and two cases of hepatitis A virus with ADEM have been reported. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine revealed multifocal high signal intensity lesions on fluid attenuated inversion recovery and T2-weighted images in the brainstem, thalamus, and cervical and thoracic spinal cord. DISCUSSION HCV infection is a common and chronic disorder with numerous extrahepatic manifestations. it can involve the renal, dermatologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, or nervous system, however, rarely involves the central nervous system. in a case of acute transverse myelitis associated with chronic HCV infection, anti-HCV antibody was present in the CSF. it is hypothesized that the virus might have penetrated blood brain barrier and involved the CNS directly."}
