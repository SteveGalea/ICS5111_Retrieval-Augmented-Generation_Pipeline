{"summary": "wild waterbirds are the original reservoir for 16 haemagglutinin subtypes (H1\u2013H16) and nine neuraminidase subtypes (N1\u2013N9) of influenza A virus. the main wild bird species involved belong to the orders Anseriformes (mainly ducks, geese and swans) knowledge of virulence of high pathogenic avian influenza virus for wild birds is important for several reasons. the current high pathogenic avian influenza virus of the subtype H5N1 circulating in poultry regularly spills over into wild birds. there is concern that it may adapt and become endemic in these species, which would make eradication virtually impossible. dorland's medical dictionary defines virulence as \u2018the degree of pathogenicity of an organism\u2019 and pathogenicity as \u2018the quality of producing or the ability to produce pathologic changes or disease\u2019. other definitions of virulence are in use in the scientific literature on host\u2013pathogen interactions. the threshold cycle value of the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used as a measure of the shedding intensity of LPAIV. 17 studies reported on virulence of experimental infections of wild or domesticated anseriform or charadriiform species with LPAIV strains originating from wild anseriform or charadriiform species. routes of inoculation were intravenous (two studies), aerogenic (one study), supra-ocular (one study, in combination with nasal cavity and pharynx) and intrarectal (one study) the dose of the virus inoculum per bird ranged from 1 105 to 1 108.7 median egg infectious dose or comparable unit of measurement. mallard seven-month-old hunter-killed mallard H5N1 IV 1.25 105 EID50 [28] comm. layer type duck three-week-old goose H5N2 NAS 1 107.2 EID50 [29] cherry valley dom. duck five-week-old migratory ducks H5N1 NAS 1 108 EID50 [30] mallard 13-week-old mallard and duck H4N6 and H5N2 OCU, aBirds were exposed to virus aerosols ranging from 3.3 103 to 1.6 105 EID50 per litre of air. Mortality No mortality was recorded in any of the 17 studies on experimental infections (table 2). 16 swans sham-inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS; [35]) were observed between 13 Bewick's swans inoculated intratracheally and intra-orally with LPAIV. a control group of 16 swans sham-inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS;

[44]. fected birds in body weight at capture, abdominal profile index at departure, or rate of change in abdominal profile index were not reported in any of the nine studies. the only clinical signs reported were in two LPAIV-infected Bewick's swans, which had lower food intake than four uninfected birds. however, there was no significant difference between infected and uninfected birds in bite rate or bites per produced faecal dropping [35] a higher probability of myocarditis, interstitial nephritis, pancreatic infiltration, periportal infiltration and/or necrosis in the liver. none of these histological lesions co-localized with the expression of influenza viral antigen by immunohistochemistry; therefore, LPAIV infection could not be confirmed as their cause. 19 birds infected with LPAIV at the beginning of winter had significantly lower probability of being seen the following winter than 63 uninfected birds. this was most apparent in juvenile swans, which were less than half as likely to return when they had been infected compared with those that had not been infected. the Netherlands showed no significant differences in resighting after capture. ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) in the year following capture were not significantly different between LPAIV-negative birds (494 of 1070, 46%) and LPAIV-positive birds (73 of 163, 45%; [44]). mortality was not recorded in the remaining five studies. the only clinical signs reported were in two LPAIV-infected Bewick's swans, which had lower food intake than four uninfected birds. however, in a follow-up study with a larger number of Bewick's swans there was no significant difference between infected and uninfected birds. interstitial nephritis, pancreatic infiltration, periportal infiltration and/or necrosis in the liver. none of these histological lesions co-localized with expression of influenza viral antigen by immunohistochemistry; therefore, LPAIV infection could not be confirmed as their cause. breeding status of adults in the year after capture differed on the basis of infection status in the winter of capture. neither of the infected swans from the 2005/2006 winter, studied by van Gils et al. [12] returned with offspring the following winter, while two of eight uninfected birds from that season returned with offspring. inoculation in the trachea, in the rectum, in the vein, or by aerosol may be considered as good approximations of the natural route of infection. pneumonia from LPAIV infection was detected neither in naturally infected birds [20,41,42] nor in birds inoculated experimentally via another route than the trachea [23,32,34,38] virulence of LPAIV is not virulent for wild waterbirds under field circumstances. a third caveat of experimental infection studies is the lack of sensitivity to detect clinical signs, other than changes in body weight or body temperature. avian poxvirus and mycoplasma gallisepticum infect external organs. infection lasting one to two weeks is characterized by infection lasting one to two weeks. migratory behaviour of free-living waterbirds makes it difficult to capture and sample them for LPAIV infection more than one time. one bird may have had several more LPAIV infections, while the other did not. the cumulative burden of LPAIV infection during the study period would differ substantially between the two birds, despite having been placed in the same category 'infected' studies of experimental infections are related to route of inoculation, animal husbandry and clinical examination. if we consider free-living waterbirds to be infected with LPAIV by faecal\u2013oral transmission [11], then inoculation in the nasal cavity or on the eye may be considered as good approximations of the natural route of infection. inoculation in the trachea, in the rectum, in the vein, or by aerosol may be considered as good a captive bird in the laboratory is kept at room temperature, is provided with food and water ad libitum, and generally does not need to migrate, produce eggs or moult. failure to observe virulence of LPAIV under laboratory circumstances does not mean that LPAIV is not virulent for wild waterbirds under field circumstances. a third caveat of experimental infection studies is the lack of sensitivity to detect clinical signs. important caveats of natural infection studies are related to the practical difficulty of adequately measuring the burden of LPAIV infection in free-living waterbirds. compared with pathogens such as avian poxvirus and mycoplasma gallisepticum. a one-time measurement is inadequate as a measure of the association between LPAIV infection and other variables determined at the same time. two birds may test positive for LPAIV at the time of banding. but between the time of banding and the time of observation for survival rate, one bird may have had several more LPAIV infections. the cumulative burden of LPAIV infection during the study period would differ substantially between the two birds. despite these possibities, the bird would be classified as 'uninfected' conclusions One or more caveats apply to most studies reviewed here (table 2). pathogenesis of diarrhoea from these three viruses is considered multifactorial. rotavirus has an enterotoxin, non-structural protein 4, that is able to induce diarrhoea in absence of histological damage. future directions Future studies could be designed to determine whether LPAIV infection of wild waterbirds decreases digestive tract function. a small reduction in digestive tract function could have a substantial effect on free-living wild waterbirds. reduced digestive tract function means birds need to find more high-quality food for the same level of refuelling, delaying the timing of their migration. endemic LPAIV infection in a particular wild waterbird species may be a genetic adaptation against too severe reduction in digestive function."}
