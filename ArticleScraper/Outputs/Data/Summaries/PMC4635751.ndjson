{"summary": "viral epidemiology of viral RTIs has been studied more extensively among pediatric populations compared with adult populations throughout the world. most studies describing the viral etiology of respiratory illness in Taiwan, a subtropical country in eastern Asia, were limited to pediatric populations. acute RTI was defined as the presence of acute RTI and a new infiltrate on chest radiograph. acute RTI was defined as the simultaneous occurrence of at least 1 respiratory symptom or sign. acute RTI was defined as the presence of acute RTI and a new infiltrate on chest radiograph. thoat swabs from 42 cases without respiratory infections were included as control samples for PCR/ESI-MS analysis. 15 patients with exclusively bacterial infections were admitted to NCKUH and 27 individuals without active infections. ion and Identification by PCR/ESI-MS Total nucleic acids were extracted from 700 L of swab samples using a nucleic acid autoextractor. the eluate was stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. PLEX-ID Respiratory Virus assay detects human adenovirus, hCoV, hMPV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1 to 3 and RSV,6. acute RTI was defined as the presence of acute RTI and a new infiltrate on chest radiograph. the most recent episode was counted as separate only if the patient fully recovered from the previous episode. the most recent episode was counted as separate only if the patient fully recovered from the previous episode. thoat swabs from 42 cases without respiratory infections were included as control samples for PCR/ESI-MS analysis. 15 patients with exclusively bacterial infections were admitted to NCKUH. 27 individuals without active infections included 10 patients with stable chronic diseases. nucleic acids were extracted from 700 L of swab samples using a nucleic acid autoextractor. the eluate was stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. PLEX-ID Respiratory Virus assay detects human adenovirus, hCoV, hMPV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1 to 3 and RSV,6. PLEX-ID manufacturer.6,8,13,14 Samples in which PCR/ESI-MS results disagreed with culture results were reexamined by a second molecular method. a total of 267 episodes of acute RTIs from 263 patients were recorded during the 9-month study period. patients with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections, Patients With Exclusively Bacterial Infections, and Individuals Without Active Infections Examined Between October 2012 and June 2013 Virus Detection by Culture All 267 respiratory samples from each RTI case were examined for viruses by both virus isolation and PCR/ESI-MS. influenza A (48 cases, 18.0%), enterovirus (13, 4.9%), and parainfluenza virus (2, 0.7%). more than 1 respiratory virus was detected in 11 (4.1%) patients. rhinovirus (5 cases) was most likely to be codetected with another respiratory virus. PCR/ESI-MS identified additional respiratory viruses in 65 culture-negative samples, mostly rhinovirus (21 samples), and a second respiratory virus in 3 culture-positive influenza A samples. the positive detection rates declined with age: 55.3%, 41.7%, and 34.5% in the 18\u201339, 40\u201359, and 60-year-old groups. a higher positivity rate was observed in patients with URTIs than that in patients with LRTIs (50.5% vs. 38.2%, P = 0.10) univariate analysis revealed that patients with 1 of the following conditions were more likely to have non-influenza respiratory virus infections. arthralgia was more frequently observed in influenza A infections than in non-influenza infections. of 55 cases of LRTIs, coinfection with bacterial pathogens by sputum culture or blood culture was found in 3 (8.8%) of 34 patients who tested positive for respiratory viruses and in 2 (9.5%) of 21 patients who tested negative for respiratory viruses. four of 6 cases of influenza A LRTI had received oseltamivir. 267 respiratory samples from each RTI case were examined for viruses by both virus isolation and PCR/ESI-MS. for virus isolation, respiratory viruses were detected in 63 (23.6%) cases, including influenza A (48 cases, 18.0%), enterovirus (13, 4.9%), parainfluenza virus (2, 0.7%), and no coinfection was detected. hMPV (10, 3.7%), adenovirus (6, 2.2%), adenovirus (6, 2.2%), adenovirus (6, 2.2%), and parainfluenza (4, 1.5%) were detected in small proportions of cases. rhinovirus (5 cases) was most likely to be codetected with another respiratory virus. the positive detection rates declined with age: 55.3%, 41.7%, and 34.5% in the 18\u201339, 40\u201359, and 60-year-old groups respectively. a higher positivity rate was observed in patients with URTIs than that in patients with LRTIs (50.5% vs. 38.2%, P = 0.10) univariate analysis revealed that patients with 1 of the following conditions were more likely to have non-influenza respiratory virus infections. arthralgia was more frequently observed in influenza A infections than in non-influenza infections. of 55 cases of LRTIs, coinfection with bacterial pathogens by sputum culture or blood culture was found in 3 (8.8%) of 34 patients who tested positive for respiratory viruses and in 2 (9.5%) of 21 patients who tested negative for respiratory viruses. four out of 24 patients vaccinated for influenza vaccine in 2012\u20132013. study enrolled immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients visiting a local clinic or a medical center who presented with an URTI or LRTI. by supplementing the conventional culture method with PCR/ESI-MS, a 2-fold increase in the respiratory virus detection rate was achieved, from 23.6% by culture alone to 47.9% by a combination of both methods. influenza A and rhinovirus were the 2 most frequently detected respiratory viruses, whereas hCoV, hMPV, enterovirus, adenovirus, RSV, and parainfluenza were detected in small proportions of cases. this finding is similar to the viral epidemiology of adult RTIs observed by other study groups. in the genus Enterovirus, acid-labile rhinovirus can be differentiated from enterovirus using an acid lability test. the 13 hCoVs were subtyped as hCoV-OC43, -229E, and -HKU1. the newly identified HCoV-NL63 was not detected during the study period, and a low detection rate (1%) was reported in China. the association of non-influenza virus infection with patients with comorbidities or LRTIs suggests that a complete respiratory viral panel would be appropriate in the diagnostic work-up for RTIs in these populations. parainfluenza type 4 and 3 newly identified respiratory viruses, human bocavirus, human polyomavirus KI and WU polyomavirus were not included in the panels. non-influenza respiratory virus infection was significantly associated with patients with comorbidities and with LRTIs. additional studies are warranted to delineate the clinical need for and economic benefits of including non-influenza respiratory viruses in the diagnostic work-up."}
