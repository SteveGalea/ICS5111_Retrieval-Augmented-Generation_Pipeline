{"summary": "the emergency use authorization authority allows the FDA to authorize use of medical countermeasures to diagnose, prevent, or treat conditions associated with the emergency. ongoing research is developing medical countermeasures deployable in public health emergencies. the use of EUAs does not require informed consent by the consumer but relies on a fact sheet that should be highly accessible. nearly 6 out of 10 americans opposed changing safety standards to allow for faster approval of new prescription drugs and medical devices. roughly 40% favored speedier FDA action. this may suggest greater public concern about EUAs and medical countermeasures. strong communication between the FDA and the public is critical to ensuring that the benefits of EUA products are realized in a time of crisis. communication in an emergency should include message materials that answer key questions, provide action steps, are easily understood, include credible information, and reflect disclosure from government agencies. trust, uncertainty, and risk perception are critical determinants of public reactions in emergencies. trust is known to play an important role in public adherence during a public health emergency. there is substantial interest in more nuanced studies of trust, its components, and its impact on behaviors during one specific emergency. uncertainty arises throughout public health emergencies including: who or what caused the emergency; how many lives have been lost and the extent of infrastructure damage; what members of the public can do to protect themselves; and when the emergency will be over. uncertainty and conflicting opinions can create even more confusion. fewer than 3 in 10 americans have expressed trust in the federal government in every major national poll conducted since 2007. fewer than 3 in 10 americans have expressed trust in the federal government in every major national poll conducted since July 2007. uncertainty, concerns about equity, agency disagreements, and mixed messaging can diminish trust in public health agencies. the more people trust their government or the communicating official, the better they are able to handle fear in uncertain situations. uncertainty may be because the uncertainty communication literature in relation to crises is limited. the government may be able to influence the public's acceptance of future changes in understanding and behavioral recommendations. these kinds of situational updates can help ensure effective communication, while maintaining credibility in public health agencies. research team conducted 148 intercept interviews from December 2015 through June 2016 across the Washington, DC region. the average participant age was 32 years, ranging from 18 to 83 years old (SD = 15.47) and 35% self-identified as female. interviews were not recorded because of the sensitivity of the topic and the high level of background noise. interviews were conducted in the afternoons and early evenings after work hours. participants were read a brief message that informed them about a new treatment they may be recommended to take by the FDA during a public health emergency. both scenarios were presented as a 3-page document. measures were administered in an oral interview in which researchers recorded responses from a scripted survey. a sample item would read, \"What remaining questions do you have regarding this information\" the instrument was evaluated by several public health experts external to the project's data collection. the average participant age was 32 years, ranging from 18 to 83 years old. the average participant age was 32 years, ranging from 18 to 83 years old. interviewers transcribing all comments from subjects by hand, verbatim. both scenarios were presented as a 3-page document, mirroring existing FDA content. participants were asked to identify other information they needed. participants were asked to define common words used by the FDA. results Understanding medical countermeasure Messages The majority of participants reported that they understand that the FDA was asking them to immediately take the recommended vaccine or medication. there were no significant differences between groups on understanding of the scenarios. participants were asked to listen to a series of words and then tell us immediately what comes to mind. the language seemed challenging to participants. on average, respondents did not know the meaning of. a word more than a tenth of the time did not reverse the trend.

of expressions. the standard deviation of all these categories when pooled is 23.27. the tone value for open-ended responses was a 36.50 mean with a standard deviation of 40. but when we removed single-word responses, the new value had a mean of 25.20 and a standard deviation of 33.70. a series of t-tests were conducted to determine just how negative the data is. responses categorized as \u201ctake the medication\u201d or \u201cother\u201d), most responses reflected comprehension of the FDA's message. participants stated that the FDA was asking them to \u201cwatch out for the disease,\u201d \u201ctell you about a vaccine\u201d and \u201cresearch more\u201d. a multivariate general linear model was conducted to predict trust in government, the CDC, and the FDA based on racial identity, gender, and type of hazard presented#. the analysis indicated significant differences for willingness to take the medication (F(3,109) = 4.391, p =.006, Wilks =.892), disease

R2 =.371) was not significant. racial identity is critical for predicting trust in the government overall. a series of linear regressions indicated differences between racial/ethnic groups in vaccine and medicine compliance (DV) the difference between racial and ethnic groups was predicted by information clarity (IV), persuasiveness (IV), fear from reading the information (IV) and trust in government (IV). the difference between Caucasians and Hispanics was not significant.
