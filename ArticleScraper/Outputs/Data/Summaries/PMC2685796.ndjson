{"summary": "the results for non-medical items showed medical waste and common trash both have the highest rate (94.6 percent) of being outsourced. the lowest rate of outsourcing is in utility maintenance (13.5 percent) the lowest rate of outsourcing is in ambulance units (51.4 percent) laundry jumped ahead of housekeeping as the top hospital department-management contract in this year's annual Outsourcing Survey. the european healthcare IT outsourcing market generated revenues of US$396.4 million in 2005 and estimates they will reach US$697.7 million in 2010. the most outsourced functions in healthcare are information technology, finance, and support services. apparent cost means the cost can be seen in the income statement for buy the service or goods. outsourcing resulted in increased staff morale, upgraded capital equipment and improved services. the outsourcing of pathology and dental technical services was simply to reduce costs. the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from china to Taiwan has had an obvious impact on local hospitals' outsourcing ability [20]. a study explored outsourcing in Taiwanese hospitals, comparing the differences between them based on hospital ownership and accreditation level. the 77 local hospitals were chosen by stratified system sampling methods from 382 local hospitals. the total sample size is 165, with 37 completed questionnaires returned. the returned samples were 6/14 = 35.3%, in regional hospitals 21/71 = 29.5%, and in local hospitals 10/77 = 12.9%. the validity of the questionnaire was further confirmed by 3 directors of medical doctor and 2 hospital management specialists. the questionnaire was mailed to all 17 medial centers and all 71 region hospitals. the sample medical centers have the bed number from 800 to 2500. the returned samples in medical centers were 6/14 = 35.3%, in regional hospitals were 21/71 = 29.5%, and in local hospitals were 10/77 = 12.9%. we prudently analyzed the returning samples and found they were evenly spread across the north, central, and south region of Taiwan. validity of the questionnaire was further confirmed by 3 directors of medical doctor and 2 hospital management specialists. results This research conducted the scale's reliability, and underlying dimensionality. the lowest percentage is in utility maintenance (13.5%). hemodialysis center also has a higher rate of outsourcing. a paired t-test was conducted between medical items and non-medical items. utility maintenance and security guard services are statistically significant at the alpha equals 0.05 level. both items are assessed from not-for profit hospitals. medical items have a higher score than non-medical items on satisfaction score. medical items need more professional training, purchase and maintain medical equipment. outsourcing of non-medical items such as linen and maintenance paid less to outsourcing companies. the \"saving cost\" is significant on both factor 1 and factor 2 of non medical items. this means hospitals believe outsourcing have better ability on the performance. the second factor is \"finance\", this means outsourcing can contribute hospital's finance. square (2) test, P value, the goodness-of-fit index (GFI), AGFI, and the root mean square error of approximation are recommended. the initial model is Figure 1A, the model indicating and acceptable model of it. the correlation between \"operation\" and \"satisfaction\" is significant. the contract documents are not easy to fill out, and are based on honesty, equality, and mutually trust. the decision differs between public and private hospitals. in not-for-profit hospitals, the CEO stated that only the CEO, CFO, and the Director of the Finance can make the choice to outsource an item. the results of the second part of the questionnaires are shown in Table 1. the results of the third part of the questionnaires are shown in Table 2. For non-medical items: common and medical waste has the highest percentage (94.6%) of outsourcing. the highest outsourcing rate is in the ambulance department (51.4%) hemodialysis center also has a higher outsourcing rate (50%) for medical items. paired t-test was conducted between medical items and non-medical items. higher scores is saving human resource (HR, 3.92) while the service quality (SQ) and saving capital investment (SI) got the lowest score (3.03). p-Value speciality performance 3.24 4.16.723.602 7.03 0.000* saving capital investment 3.03 4.08.687.640 8.22 0.000* saving cost 3.59 3.38.725.828 -2.09 0.044* saving human resource 3.92 3.86.682.822 -0.47 0.644 adaptability to environment 3.62 4.00.721.745 3.87 0.000* total satisfaction 3.49 3.84.692.602 2.84 0.007* N = 37. hospitals have limited space, and lack the area to build refuse burning facilities. outsourcing this service has saved hospitals space and funds. the gift store is often outsourced because it is not one of the hospital's major concerns. the Pearson Chi-square tests and ML Chi-square were performed and recorded on table 3. both items are assessed from not-for profit hospitals that have higher outsourcing percentage levels than private and public hospitals. both items are significant: the gift store and ambulance service. non-medical items have a higher score than medical items on satisfaction score. the medical items need more professional training, purchase and maintain medical equipment. outsourcing of non-medical items such as linen and maintenance paid less to outsourcing companies. this study defines the first factor is \"performance\", this means hospitals believe outsourcing have better ability on the performance. the second factor is \"finance\", this means outsourcing can contribute hospital's finance. the third factor is \"human resource,\" such as the security, linen, and waste treatment. the initial model is Figure 1A, the model indicating and acceptable model of it. for non-medical items, the Figure 1D model also show a better model fitting than Figure 1D. the correlation between \"operation\" and \"satisfaction\" is significant. the decision differs between public and private hospitals. in not-for-profit hospitals, the CEO stated that only the CEO, CFO, and the Director of the Finance can make the choice to outsource an item. the outsourcing of common and medical waste is a very high percentage (94.6%) on the other hand, the outsourcing of nutrition, nursing, and pharmacy have a lower percentage (less than 3%) the drawbacks of regulations have limited the public hospitals to operate the outsourcing contracts. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions CTH was responsible for primary data cleaning and analysis."}
