{"summary": "12 healthy individuals and 10 HLA-A2\u2013positive patients with chronic hepatitis C were studied. all patients repeatedly tested positive for anti-HCV antibodies. none of the patients tested positive for autoimmune hepatitis serum markers. 4 106 PBMCs were incubated with synthetic peptide (10 g/ml; Chiron Mimotopes) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 g/ml) and Hepes (5 mM) containing 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FCS (h2-medium) Peptide-specific induction cultures were depleted of CD4+ cells using negative selection according to manufacturer's instructions. cells were plated in FCS-medium in the presence of PHA (1 g/ml), rIL-2 (30 U/ml), irradiated (10,400 rads) allogeneic PBMCs (106 cells/ml), peptide-pulsed (10 g/ml; 1 h) JY EBV-B cells specific lysis was calculated as difference between lysis of targets with peptide (or plasmid) and targets without peptide (or plasmid) in functional MHC binding assays, JY target cells were pulsed with synthetic peptide for 90 min after 51Cr labeling, then washed twice with PBS containing 10% FCS-medium, and used as described above. a fluorescein (FL)-labeled reference peptide (FLPSDC(FL) FPSV), 25 l (end concentration, 150 nM), was incubated with 25 l of competitor peptide in a 96-well V-bottomed plate. the mixture was incubated for 24 h at 4\u00b0C, washed twice with PBS containing 1% BSA (PBA1%), resuspended in PBA1% containing cells were incubated for 0, 2, 4, and 6 h at 37\u00b0C. then stained with BB7.2, an HLA-A2 confirmation-specific mAb 27 and goat anti\u2013mouse FITC. the cells were fixed by resuspension in PBA1% containing 0.5% paraformaldehyde. the human B lymphoblastoid cell line AHH-1 TK+/ derived from the RPMI 1788 cell line was maintained in FCS-medium. PBMCs from HLA-A2\u2013positive healthy donors and HCV patients were isolated on Ficoll-Paque density gradients. cultures were restimulated with 106 peptide-pulsed, irradiated cells in 1 ml of AB-medium containing rIL-2 (20 U/ml; EuroCetus B.V.) the cultured PBMCs were tested for CTL activity against different peptides on day 35. cytolytic activity was determined in a standard 4-h 51Cr-release assay. 2,500 K562 cells per well were added to reduce unspecific lysis. Spontaneous release was 25% of maximum release in all assays. eluted cells were buffered with cold IMDM, washed with IMDM, and resuspended at 5 105 cells/ml in IMDM plus 1.5 g/ml 2-microglobulin. a fluorescein (FL)-labeled reference peptide (FLPSDC(FL) FPSV), 25 l (end concentration, 150 nM), was incubated with 25 l of competitor peptide (different end concentration cells were washed twice with ice-cold IMDM and resuspended in 1 ml IMDM. cells were then stained with BB7.2, an HLA-A2 confirmation-specific mAb 27 and goat anti\u2013mouse FITC. were obtained measuring the peptide-induced stabilization of HLA-A2 molecules at the surface of transporter-associated with antigen processing\u2013deficient T2 cells. the CYP2A6 8\u201317 as well as the CYP2A7 8\u201317 peptides dissociated much faster with half-lives of 1 h. in five individuals, the HCV core 178\u2013specific CTLs recognized the inducing HCV peptide but also CYP2A6 and/or CYP2A7 self-peptides. a higher specific lysis of targets presenting CYP2A7 was observed in most cases. two donors recognized all three peptides, three individuals recognized HCV core 178 and CYP2A7 8\u201317. PBMCs from healthy HCV-seronegative blood donors were stimulated with HCV core 178\u2013187 (a), CYP2A6 8\u201317 (b), or CYP2A7 8\u201317 peptides. after 5 wk of stimulation, peptide-specific lysis of each culture was determined on JY target cells pulsed with HCV core 178\u2013187 (white bars), CYP2A6 8\u201317 (black bars), or CYP the higher off-rate of the CYP peptides had no effect on CTL recognition. recognition of CYP2A7 is less affected and there is no effect on recognition of CYP2A6. the ability of HCV core 178\u2013induced CTLs to recognize endogenously synthesized CYP2A6 antigen was studied using the AHH-1 TK+/ cell line transfected with CYP2A6 (h2A3) and cells transfected with the unrelated CYP2D6 (h2D6) as target cells in 4- and 8-h cytotoxicity assays. cytotoxicity assay performed in the presence of K562 cells. HLA-A2 binding properties of HCV core 178 and homologous CYP peptides were determined. PBMCs from 12 healthy HCV-seronegative, HLA-A2\u2013positive blood donors were stimulated with synthetic HCV core 178\u2013187, CYP2A6 8\u201317, or CYP2A7 8\u201317 peptide. after 5 wk, the cultures were tested for CTL activity against target cells presenting each of the three peptides. PBMCs from healthy HCV-seronegative blood donors were stimulated with HCV core 178\u2013187 (a), CYP2A6 8\u201317 (b), or CYP2A7 8\u201317 peptides. no CTL response could be induced with the self-peptides CYP2A6 8\u201317 (Fig. 2 c) in any of the 12 donors tested. the same strategy was used to analyze the HCV core 178\u2013specific CTL repertoire in patients with chronic HCV infection without markers for AIH. the percentage of patients having cross-reactive CTLs is comparable to that of healthy donors. this is not astonishing, as chronic HCV infection is associated with a low number of CTLs in the peripheral blood 29 30. a panel of three different anti-CD8 antibodies tested their effect on target cell lysis. recognition of HCV core 178 depends in part on CD8 availability. self-peptide recognition of CYP2A6 does not. CYP2A6-transfected cells by CTL lines from donor 2 were higher than lysis of the parental cell line AHH-1 TK+/ or control cells transfected with CYP2D6 (squares) cross-reactive CTL lines derived from donor 2 were tested for their ability to lyse AHH-1 TK+/ target cells transfected with CYP2D6. the induction of self-reactive CD8+ CTLs by a viral epitope is compatible with molecular mimicry (resemblance of pathogen and host antigens) the induction of self-reactive CD8+ CTLs by a viral epitope is compatible with molecular mimicry (resemblance of pathogen and host antigens), a mechanism that has been described mainly at the level of antibodies and CD4+ T cells 16 17 18. complexes of the native ligand or APLs with MHC molecules binding to the TCR can induce different intracellular signals in T cells 36 37 38. the level of T cell activation is dependent on the number of TCRs triggered in a process of serial engagement of many TCRs by a few peptide\u2013MHC complexes. a subpopulation of cross-reactive CTLs shows no differences in recognition of the three peptide ligands. cross-reactive CTLs may contribute to liver cell damage by lysis of infected hepatocytes during ongoing viral infection and by lysis of uninfected autoantigen-expressing hepatocytes. authoreactive CD4+ T cells could maintain the autoreactive CD8 T cell response after viral clearance. authors: viral epitope and viral epitope are coexpressed and colocalize to the liver. authors: absence of CYP-inducible CTLs in peripheral blood suggests central or peripheral tolerance mechanisms are operational. authors: this disease has been described to occur subsequent to HCV infection. autoimmune disease is upheld by ongoing hepatocyte lysis by cross-reactive, HCV-induced CTLs maintained by autoreactive helper T cells. the coincidence of HCV, autoreactive B cells, and autoreactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells is thus required for the induction of HCV-associated AIH."}
