{"summary": "TB is an air-borne infective disease caused by the slowly-replicating bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) an estimated 8.6 million new cases of TB and 1.3 million deaths, including 320,000 deaths among HIV-positive people, were recorded in 2012. india and china have the largest number of cases at 26% and 12% of the global total, respectively. the tuberculosis morbidity based on age structure from 2005 to 2012 in china. different models have been developed for defining target sub-populations for treating latent TB infections and incorporating certain factors, such as drug-resistant strains. we estimated the basic reproduction number R 0, analyzed the globally dynamic behavior of the model. we used the model to simulate the annual data of infected TB cases reported by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) from 2005 to 2016. the susceptible class was divided into three age groups: childhood ( S 1 ), middle-aged ( S 2 ), and senior ( S 3 ). we assumed that the latent, infectious, and recovered classes are the same for different age groups. d is the natural death rate; is the disease-induced death rate; is the recovery rate; and is the recurrence rate of successfully treated TB cases. china developed and implemented two five-year national plans in the 1980s and one 10-year national plan in the 1990s. d S 1 d t = A d 1 S 1 m 1 S 1 1 S 1 I, d S 2 d t = m 1 S 1 d 2 S 2 2 I m 2 S 2, d S 3 d t = m 2 S 2 d 3 S 3 3 I, d E d t = ( 1 p ) In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (denoted R 0 ) of an infection can be viewed as the (4) This model has a disease-free equilibrium P 0 = ( S 1 0, S 2 0, S 3 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ) where S 1 0 = A d 1 + m 1, S 2 0 = m 1 A ( d 1 + m 1 ), S 3 0 = m 1 m 2 A ( d 1 + m 1 ) ( d 1 + m 1 ) ( d 1 + m 1 ) ( d 2 + between 2005 and 2012, a total of 14,221,317 active TB cases were reported. between 2005 and 2012, a total of 14,259,308 active TB cases were reported. the susceptible class was divided into three age groups: childhood ( S 1 ), middle-aged ( S 2 ), and senior ( S 3 ). we assumed that the latent, infectious, and recovered classes are the same for different age groups. d is the natural death rate; is the disease-induced death rate; is the recovery rate; and is the recurrence rate of successfully treated TB cases. china developed and implemented two five-year national plans in the 1980s and one 10-year national plan in the 1990s. assuming the newborns that received the BCG vaccine remain in the susceptible compartment, Model (1) becomes the following: d S 1 d t = A d 1 S 1 m 1 S 1 1 S 1 I, d S 2 d t = m 2 S 2 2 S 2 I, d S 3 d t = m 2 S 2 d 3 S 3 I, d E d t = ( 1 p ) (4) This model has a disease-free equilibrium P 0 = ( S 1 0, S 2 0, S 3 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. the endemic equilibrium P * = ( S 1 *, S 2 *, S 3 *, E *, I *, R *. the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 revealed substantial weaknesses in the country\u2019s public health system. the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome revealed substantial weaknesses in the country\u2019s public health system. values of the parameters are listed in Table 2 and the detailed estimation process of the parameter values are as follows. the parameters of Model (2) are listed in Table 2. the initial number of people infected with TB is I ( 0 ) = 1, 259, 308, which is the number of people infected with TB in 2005. the percent ages of people with a TB bacteria infection but asymptomatic and those successfully treated for TB are 12.1% and 80%. the latent period of TB is about two months [33], thus we calculated the re-activation rate of latent TB patients v = 12 2 = 6 annually. from the 2013 WHO global tuberculosis report [2], we obtained the disease-induced death rate = 0.0025. from Blower et al. [10], we knew the fraction of fast-developing infectious cases p is 0.05 and the recovery rate is = 0.496. we used Z ( t ) to estimate the newly-infected TB cases per year. the decrease may be due to the current control strategies not being fully effective [31], which aligns with the dynamic behaviors of Model (2). the light grey area is the 95% confidence interval (CI) for all 2000 simulations. the blue circles are the reported TB infection cases. we also calculated the residual of 2016 as 235 and R-square (R 2 ) statistic. 3000 input parameter vectors were then used to calculate the numerical distribution of the basic reproduction number R 0. estimated the basic reproduction number from 2005 to 2016 is R 0 = 1.7858 and the 95 % confidence interval of R 0 is ( 1.7752, 1.7963 ). the WHO proposed a post-2015 global End TB Strategy in 2014 [37]. this strategy aims to end the global TB epidemic, with targets to cut new cases by 90% by 2035 and a milestones of 50% reduction in TB incidence rate in 2025. in this analysis, 3 are the most important risk factors for TB control. TB cases (a) under control strategies of decreasing 3 from 1 to 0.5; (b) under control strategies of increasing from 1 to 1.15; and (c) under a combination of control strategies of increasing from 1 to 1.15; and (c) under a combination of control strategies of increasing from 1 to 1.85, simultaneously. confidence interval are d 0.0067, 95 % CI ( 0.0065, 0.0069 ) d 1 0.0017, 95 % CI ( 0.0013, 0.0021 ) d 3 0.0367, 95 % CI ( 0.0352, 0.0382 ) and A 1.623 10 7, 95 % CI ( 1.606 10 7, 1.643 10 7 ). the initial number of people infected with TB is I ( 0 ) = 1, d 2 m 2 d 2 d 3 d t = m 2 d 3 d t = m 2 d 3 d t = m 2 d 3 d t = m 2 d 3 d t = m 2 d 3 d t = m 2 d 3 d t = m 2 d 3 d t = m 2 d 3 d t = m 2 d 3 d X ( t ) represents the cumulative number of people infected with TB at time t. I ( t ) denotes the number in compartment I at time t, which includes the newly-infected TB cases and recovery TB cases at time t. trajectories of the TB infection data, both cumulative and newly-infected TB cases, based on 2000 independent repeated simulations of Model (2). we calculated the residual of 2016 as 235 and R-square (R 2 ) statistic to show goodness of fit [34], where the R-square value is 0.9812. we performed a Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on the estimated parameters. we stratified the PDFs into 3000 equiprobability areas and then randomly sampled 3000 times without replacement, forming 3000 input parameter vectors. we can calculate partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) which reflects the correlation between parameters A, 1, 2, 3, m 1, and R 0. the PRCC of the estimated parameters with respect to R 0.
