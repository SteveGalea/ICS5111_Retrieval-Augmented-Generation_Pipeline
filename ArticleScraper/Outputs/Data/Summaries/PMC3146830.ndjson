{"summary": "the west of Scotland specialist virology centre (WoSSVC) in scotland tested > 16 000 clinical samples for H1N1/2009. most were from patients clinically diagnosed with H1N1/2009. all were given a full respiratory screen using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. six genes (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS) were similar to viruses previously identified in triple-reassortant swine influenza viruses in north american pigs. the remaining two genes (NA and M) were derived from Eurasian swine influenza viruses. the virus was responsible for the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. the west of Scotland specialist virology centre (WoSSVC) tested 16 264 clinical samples for H1N1/2009. of these, only 1516 were positive (9% overall for the period of April-July; range 5-10% per month) this is especially true for respiratory pathogens. samples submitted included gargles, throat swabs, nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, sputums, and endotracheal secretions. the number collected each month and the age of the patients is shown in Table 2. 78 48.8 (45-52.4%) 693 56.5 (53.7-59%) 1652 50.9 (49.1-52.6%) > 65 yrs 84 13.9 (11.2-16.4%) 109 16.8 (14-20%) 87 11.2 (14-20%) 148 12.1 (10.3-14%) 428 13.2 (12-14.4%) mycoplasma pneumoniae Cytadhesin P1 (P1) gene AAGCAGGAGTGACGGAAACAC CACCACATCATTCCCCGTATT CY5-CTCCACCAACAACCTCGCGCCTA-BHQ Human metapneumovirus A Fusion GCYGTYAGCTTCAGTCAATTCAA TCCAGCATTGTCTGAAAATTGC VIC-CGCACAACATTTAGAAACCTTCT-MGBNFQ Parainfluenza one-step rtRT-PCR was performed on 6 l of RNA extract with the Platinum One-step qRT-PCR kit. the primers were at a final concentration of 0.4 M and the probe at 0.2 M. a single cycle of reverse transcription for 15 min at 50\u00b0C, 2 min at 95\u00b0C for reverse transcriptase inactivation and DNA polymerase activation followed by 40 amplification cycles of 15 sec at 95\u00b0C and 34 secs at 60\u00b0C each. the threshold cycle (Ct) for each sample was calculated by determining the point at which the fluorescence exceeded the threshold limit. samples submitted included gargles, throat swabs, nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, sputums, and endotracheal secretions. the number collected each month and the age of the patients is shown in Table 2. the oligonucleotide primers and probes for the influenza A generic assay and the H1N1/2009 specific assay are described elsewhere. the primers and probes for the influenza A generic assay and the H1N1/2009 specific assay are described elsewhere.
