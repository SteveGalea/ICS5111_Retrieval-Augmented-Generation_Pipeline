{"summary": "the time-series susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered model was developed by Finkenst\u00e4dt & Grenfell [10] to offer an accurate and straightforward way to statistically connect mechanistic models of infectious disease transmission with time-series data. TSIR models readily account for inhomogeneous mixing by allowing for rates of contact between susceptible and infectious hosts to depend on their densities nonlinearly. mixing parameters have an interpretation as corrections for approximating a continuous-time process with a discrete-time model [16,17] there are a number of reasons why mixing might vary in time or space. seasonal variation in mixing might arise because of travel associated with labour [18], religious events [19] or vacation [20], or because of the timing of school openings in case of influenza [21]. we performed an analysis of district-level time series of dengue transmission in the Punjab province of Pakistan using a TSIR model. we also made estimates of the relationships between density-independent transmission potential and putative drivers thereof, such as temperature, to allow for the relative roles of extrinsic and intrinsic factors to be teased apart. no comprehensive nationwide entomological surveys have been performed in Pakistan. we use a probabilistic model to infer probability of occurrence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. a regression tree model was applied that predicts a continuous spatial surface of mosquito occurrence from a fitted relationship between the distribution of these mosquitoes and their environmental drivers. covariates used in this study to derive environmental drivers of transmission. aedes aegypti probability of occurrence (a); A. albopictus probability of occurrence (b); urbanicity (c); weighted urban accessibility (d); population density and study area (e); precipitation (f); EVI mean (g). t,i was fitted using covariates shown in figure 1. the time-varying climatological covariates are all fit as a smooth spline. we used equation (2.1) to establish: 2.3 from which we obtained 2.4. we then examined how variation in l and 2 1 affected the left-hand side of equation (2.4) and also the critical proportion of the population to control in order to effect pathogen elimination. the improved vegetation index (EVI) was applied to the MOD11A2 satellite to produce 16-day and monthly pixel-based estimates for 2011\u20132014. the same method was again applied to derive the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from the MOD11A2 satellite to produce 16-day and monthly pixel-based estimates. t,i was fitted using covariates shown in figure 1. the time-varying climatological covariates are all fit as a smooth spline. t,i is fit using generalized additive model regression. a 'full' model using the density-dependent covariates was combined into a single model which was then subjected to backwards selection. the mixing coefficient was initially set equal for each district and once a final model was arrived upon, the mixing coefficient was allowed to vary separately from the other coefficients. the model source code and processing of covariates will be made available in line with previous projects [54] a model that explained 76.9% of the deviance had an adjusted R2 of 0.746. climatological covariates that were fit as smooth splines, temperature, lagged temperature and EVI remained in the model. average distribution of R0 with green representing Lahore versus red all other districts (a), their geographical distribution (b) and over time in which the green line again is representing Lahore versus the red line representing all other districts (c) outputs correspond to the model without including density-related variables. the final model was then compared to a nested model in which the coefficient for Lahore was allowed to vary independently of all other districts. the best-fit mixing coefficient was 0.58, barely lower than the mixing coefficient for non-Lahore districts in the climatological model. the estimated median R0 clustered around 2 (mean = 1.8), and again the R0 for non-Lahore was largest, but in this model it was considerably larger than in the climatological model. the straight line indicates the critical proportion assuming the in each population are equal. order of magnitude of the infectious population refers to number of infectious people in powers of 10; i.e. the range is 10\u2013100 000. gypti map for the A. albopictus map changed very little to 76.8%. climatological covariates were fit as smooth splines, temperature, lagged temperature and EVI remained in the model. a significant amount of periodic variation unexplained by the climatological covariates alone. the median R0 for Lahore ( = 0.74) was estimated at 3.28, the highest among all districts. the density-dependent covariates were then added to the full model and backwards selection was performed again. model it was considerably larger than in the climatological model. the urban map (p = 0.01) and the weighted access map (p = 3 105) nested model that allowed lahore's mixing coefficient to vary was fitted. there was no significant difference between the mixing coefficients (p 1). the order of magnitude of the infectious population refers to number of infectious people in powers of 10; i.e. the range is 10\u2013100 000. this regional variability in mixing has direct implications for estimates of the basic reproductive number of dengue. large-scale mosquito suitability surfaces helped capture the environmental determinants of dengue transmission [28]. an important and unresolved question for dengue is how to best optimize the delivery of intervention strategies to reduce disease incidence, which is determined by R0. Using results presented here on mixing coefficients and environmental drivers will help pinpoint areas of major risk of importation more accurately. using the fitted relationships of the environmental drivers of transmission and R0 will enable future analyses and comparisons between diseases and geographical regions. funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of manuscript."}
