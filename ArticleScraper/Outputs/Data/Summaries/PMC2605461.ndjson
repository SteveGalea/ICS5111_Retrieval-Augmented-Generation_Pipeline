{"summary": "the development of qualified and able public health leaders has become a new urgency in building the infrastructure needed to address public health emergencies. the systemic and scientific training model need further improvement and development. the purpose of this study was to develop, deliver, and evaluate a participatory leadership training program for emergency response. the emergency preparedness capability of public health leaders was insufficient in china [11,12]. one emergency preparedness training program was developed and supported by the TMCEI. the study was carried out by tongji medical college emergency institute (TMCEI) from 2006 to 2007. the model is an integrated system with results from one phase influencing the next. information resulting from evaluation of training effectiveness is used to determine whether the training met its previously defined aims and objectives. each class lasted 14 days (112 hours) two participants did not complete their training for reasons unrelated to the training, and they were not included in the evaluation (N = 41, 95.35% response rate). trainers came from MOH, WHO, Chinese CDC, Fudan University, Wuhan University, and Huazhong University of science and technology. Describe his/her functional role(s) in emergency response and demonstrate his/her role(s) in regular drills. Identify and locate the agency emergency response plan (or the pertinent portion of the plan) participants completed the first measurement (pre-test, baseline) on the first day of training. participants were mailed a copy of the survey with a self-addressed return envelope. feedback of the results of the evaluation was made immediately. scores of self-assessment were derived for each domain by participants' response to all the frequency questions separately. repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test differences between pre-test, post-test, and follow-up test. data was analyzed by one way ANOVA with SPSS12.0 for Windows. the training contents were subjected to continuous monitoring and evaluation during the entire training period. the training contents were subjected to continuous monitoring and evaluation during the entire training period. the program was designed to be innovative, relevant, flexible and not just a \"one size fits all\" anonymous questionnaires and semi-structured interviews assessed individual basic information, knowledge levels, and self-assessment of skills regarding emergency preparedness. the questionnaire was designed by experts in the field of training programs. participants completed the first measurement (pre-test, baseline) on the first day of training. the post-training measurement (post-test) was conducted at the end of the last day of training. participants were mailed a copy of the survey with a self-addressed return envelope. data was analyzed by one way ANOVA with SPSS12.0 (SPSS. Inc., USA) for Windows. most participants were male (N = 36, 87.80%) and over half had earned a bachelor's degree or master's. most participants had more than five years of experience as public health leaders. participants reported a significant improvement in their skills in all fifteen competency areas examined in post-test as compared with pre-test (P 0.01). the greatest improvements were reported in the leaders' ability to \"match the skills and knowledge\" twelve months later, there was a slight decline in some competency areas examined as compared with post-test (P > 0.05), but the mean scores had dramatically increased in all fifteen competency areas examined as compared with pre-test (P 0.01). change in self-assessment of skills skills Level, Mean(SD) Pre-test Post-test Follow-up test Cope with and lead changes in public health practice. participants indicated a perception of high quality for the training methods, contents, presentations, instructors' responsiveness and value, and the sessions overall. most participants (N = 37, 90.24%) thought these training methods were excellent or very good, and that made the training contents could be understood clearly and easily. an outbreak of avian influenza occurred in anhui and Hunan provinces. more than ten thousand poultries were infected and over fifty thousand poultries were killed. some leaders involved firsthand in the outbreak response. effectiveness of the leadership training was shown indirectly. knowledge levels regarding public health emergency preparedness were relatively low before training. a significant increase was observed in the mean knowledge scores (Pre-test: 21.63 6.37; Post-test: 31.59 5.85; Follow-up test: 32.29 5.15) (P 0.01). improvement in the mean score from 2.66 to 3.83, P 0.01), \"lead and participate in groups to identify public health problems\" smaller improvement was detected in the leaders' ability to \"match the skills and knowledge of public health workers with appropriate tasks\" twelve months later, there was a slight decline in some competency areas examined as compared with post-test (P > 0.05), but the mean scores had dramatically increased. social, and political implications of alternative policy options 2.54(0.92) 3.49(0.71)* 3.68(0.69)* Work with, coordinate, and/or lead community efforts to address public health problems 2.88(0.81) 3.80(0.71)* 3.76(0.70)* Build strong and ongoing relationships with the community 2.95(0.86) 3.90(0.80)* 3.93(0.85)* Collaborate with colleagues and the community to manage and investigate public health problems. more than ninety-five percent of participants (N = 39) reported that the training model was scientific and feasible. most participants (N = 40, 97.56%) were very satisfied with the venue, training logistics and services. only one participant (N = 1, 2.44%) suggested logistics and services should be improved. leadership training continuously strives to improve the system and enhance the preparedness of public health leaders in responding to emergencies [13]. the results of follow-up also showed a significant improvement in the knowledge levels and skills of leaders who participated in the training. this is similar to results found by Potter et al [9]. the leadership training model allows for a systematic approach to assessing, designing, developing, implementing, and evaluating training that is both competency-driven and practice-based. the model is a closed-loop system, and the continuous monitoring and evaluation could improve the effectiveness of training. gara OB were critical in their critical reading of the manuscript."}
