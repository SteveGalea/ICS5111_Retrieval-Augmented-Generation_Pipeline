{"summary": "small animal models that support the development of adult parasites have not been identified. new mouse models for onchocerciasis will enable the development of O. volvulus specific biomarkers. a limited number of biomarkers have been identified in the urine that can distinguish between past and present infections. the only susceptible animal hosts for O. volvulus are chimpanzees [9,10] and mangabey monkeys [11]. novel strains of CC mice have been identified that are susceptible to specific bacteria, viruses, and parasites of humans [18\u201323] as an alternative approach to overcome murine resistance to infection, mice have been developed with greatly diminished immune responses. NSG mice have the unique ability to support several different xenografts. these include human hematopoietic stem cells that allow for the development of an immature partially-functional human immune system. this results in increased numbers of CD33+ myeloid cells, B-cells, T-cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. we were able to develop convenient and tractable murine models that support the development of O. volvulus L3 into advanced larval stages. the parasite material was collected during the years 1994\u20131999 in the research facility at the tropical medicine research station, Kumba, Cameroon. the developed L3 were collected from dissected flies, cleaned, and cryopreserved in dimethyl sulfoxide and sucrose. the worms were then washed 5 times in a 1:1 mixture of NCTC-135 and Iscove\u2019s modified Dulbecco\u2019s medium (Sigma, St. Louis MO) batches of L3 with viabilities greater than 50% at 21 days post implantation were used. CC strains can be found on the UNC Systems Genetics website at http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py. the mice were kept under temperature, humidity and light cycle-controlled conditions and fed autoclavable rodent chow and given water ad libitum. mice were injected with 5106 BESM, HaCaT, LEC, or HuSkMc cells weekly throughout the experiment. the frequency of injection was determined by in vivo imaging experiments. mice were injected with 5106 cells subcutaneously weekly throughout the experiment. atopoietic cells per l of whole blood were used for experimentation. mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories or were prepared following previously established protocols. mice were necropsied following previously established protocols for the isolation of filarial worms. mice were anesthetized using isoflurane gas and exsanguinated. the head was removed from the body of the mouse and discarded. the remaining internal organs and skin were removed from the muscles. urine was thawed on ice, centrifuged and then filtered through a 0.22 M filter. samples brought to 1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mM dithiothreitol, sonicated briefly. LC was performed using an Easy-nLC 1000 UHPLC system. mobile phase A was 97.5% MilliQ water, 2% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. mobile phase B was 99.5% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. MGF files were generated from mzML using the Peak Picker HiRes tool. all searches required 10 ppm precursor mass tolerance, 0.02 Da fragment mass tolerance, strict tryptic cleavage, up to 2 missed cleavages, fixed modification of cysteine alkylation and variable modification of methionine oxidation. the procedures used for the production of O. volvulus forest strain third-stage-larvae (L3) were approved by an NIH accredited Institutional Review Board of the Medical Research Council. the protocol was reviewed and approved annually. after seven days the flies were dissected and the developed L3 were collected, cleaned and cryopreserved. mice were washed 5 times in a 1:1 mixture of NCTC-135 and Iscove\u2019s modified Dulbecco\u2019s medium. the mice were fed autoclavable rodent chow and given water ad libitum. the mice were kept under temperature, humidity and light cycle-controlled conditions. mice were injected with 5106 BESM, HaCaT, LEC, or HuSkMc cells subcutaneously weekly throughout the experiment. the frequency of injection was determined by in vivo imaging. genes encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase were inserted into HuSkMc cells using lentiviral vectors following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. isolated cells were grown in HuSkMc media as described above and 5106 cells were injected subcutaneously into NSG mice. humanized mice with multiple human-cell types Two approaches were used to create humanized mice containing multiple human-cell types. mice were treated with busulfan (Sigma) (20 mg/kg IP) and injected retro-orbitally with 5x105 CD34+ stem cells. eight weeks following stem cell xenograft the peripheral blood from the BLT mice was screened for the presence of human cells. qPCR screening of tissues for the presence of O. volvulus parasites PCR screening was performed on all the infected mouse tissues. worms were placed in boiling fixative consisting of 95% ethanol and 5% glycerol. worms were transferred to glycerin jelly (gelatin 10 g, ddH2O 60.0 ml, glycerine 70.0 ml, Phenol 1.0 ml) samples brought to 1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mM dithiothreitol, sonicated briefly, and incubated in a Thermo-Mixer at 90o C, 1,000 RPM for 20 min. the supernatant was transferred to a passivated 30 kD MWCO device (Millipore, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany mobile phase B was 99.5% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. the 240 min LC gradient ran from 0% B to 35% B over 210 min. samples were loaded directly to the column. all searches required 10 ppm precursor mass tolerance, 0.02 Da fragment mass tolerance, strict tryptic cleavage, up to 2 missed cleavages, fixed modification of cysteine alkylation and variable modification of methionine oxidation. proteome cluster builds species- and genus-specific protein sequence libraries from the most current UniProtKB distribution. five mice from each of the different strains were infected with 100 O. volvulus L3. none of the 5 strains of CC mice tested was susceptible to infection with O. volvulus L3. survival of larval Onchocerca volvulus in four mouse models. O. volvulus L3 (100/mouse) were injected subcutaneously into 4 different NSG based models. NSG mice (4 week n = 11 [2.3% Recovery], 8 week n = 4 [1.7% Recovery]) animals were necropsied and worms were recovered and measured. solid colored bar is the geometric mean of the lengths of larvae recovered from black flies. HuSkMc cell engrafted mice had an 81% established O. volvulus infection rate. at 8-weeks post-infection, mice with HuSkMc cells had a 58% established infection rate with a GM parasite recovery of 1.4 with a range of 1 to 3 per mouse. at each time point tested the parasites in HuSkMc-engrafted mice demonstrated continued parasite growth. at 4-weeks post-infection humanized mice contained a GM of 2.4 (range 1\u20137) worms/mouse. humanized NRG mice had a GM of 1.7 (range 1\u20134) worms/mouse. a significant increase in length was seen between the L3 and 4-week recovery. LT mice had an established infection rate of 60% with a GM of 2.3 (range 2\u20133) worms/mouse. growth of the parasites was equivalent to that seen in the NSG mice and other humanized models. 8-12-week old worms, the female ovejector formed and had attached to the body wall. the testis, located at approximately mid-body, had become elongate in shape and had looped posteriorly to form a classic shepherd\u2019s crook. male larva at approximately mid-body showed the testis (arrow), which is C-shaped, curved posteriorly, and has begun to grow posteriorly. a total of 7,430 proteins were identified based on the spectral matching to a combined protein database of human, mouse, O. volvulus and its Wolbachia (wOv) endosymbiont. of all the proteins identified, 155 O. volvulus proteins were detected in the infected mice and not in the control mice. 5 mice from each of the different strains were infected with 100 O. volvulus L3 and necropsied at 4-weeks post infection. none of the 5 strains of CC mice tested was susceptible to infection with O. volvulus. NSG mice were infected with 100 O. volvulus L3 and necropsied at 4- and 8-weeks following infection. 75% of mice had an established infection, with a GM recovery of 1.4 (range 1 to 3) worms per mouse. the percentage of mice in a group of infected animals from which live parasites were recovered was determined. after 4, 8 or 12-weeks, animals were necropsied and worms were recovered and measured. 80% of the mice had established infections at recovery with a GM parasite recovery of 1.4 with a range of 1 to 3 per mouse. at 4-weeks post-infection, 80% of the mice had established infections at recovery with a GM parasite recovery of 1.6 with 1 to 3 per mouse. 13 m (Min: 592 m, Max: 788 m), at 8-weeks lengths of 751 m (Min: 642 m, Max: 1,081 m), and at 12-weeks the GM length was 1,121 m (Min: 748 m) these growth rates represented significant changes between L3 and 4-week worms (p = 0.0010) and between 8- and 12-week worms (p0.0001) a significant increase in length was seen between the L3 and worms 4-weeks post infection (p0.0001) and between worms recovered at the 4- and 8-week time points (p0.0001) no nodules were found in any of these tissues upon necropsy. Detailed morphological analyses focused on worms recovered from mice infected for 8-weeks and HuSkMc humanized mice infected for 12-weeks. no differences in the ratio of males and female worms recovered from the mice was observed, however it was noted that most of the longer worms were females. a total of 7,430 proteins were identified based on the spectral matching to a combined protein database of human, mouse, O. volvulus and its Wolbachia (wOv) endosymbiont. a total of 7,430 proteins were identified based on the spectral matching to a combined protein database. 155 O. volvulus proteins (111 in serum and 44 in the urine) were detected in the infected mice. the mice had 5 proteins (OVOC11556, OVOC835, OVOC10244, OVOC4009 and OVOC9087) in common in the serum and 5 (OVOC7220, OVOC4139, OVOC224, OVOC8249 and OVOC9267) the CC mouse project was developed to produce an extremely diverse set of inbred animals that could be used for mapping different genetic traits. five different CC mouse strains, selected based on their diverse genetic backgrounds, were tested for susceptibility to O. volvulus. either mice are missing some integral factors required for parasite growth or the immune responses in mice are effective at eliminating the infection. studies with the human parasite S. stercoralis have demonstrated that the entire parasite life cycle will develop in NSG mice within 4-weeks [31] it is unlikely that the entire life cycle, including mating and development of microfilariae, will occur in NSG mice. humanization of the various immunocompromised mouse strains resulted in the development of an immature human immune system. the developing immune system in these mice displays a T-independent response, limited antigen-specific IgM responses, and the presence of multiple innate immune cells. non-human primates and mice successfully molt into L4. the lengths of the recovered parasites were significantly shorter than those recovered at 8 and 12 weeks post infection from the mice tested in this study. cost and ethical considerations limit the utility of primates for drug discovery and antigen identification. a percentage of larvae recovered after cryopreservation survived in diffusion chambers implanted in mice. the overall viability of the injected larvae played a role in the observed recovery rates. both male and female worms grew in length and resumed development in the human host. humanized mice have been shown to be effective at identifying biomarkers for early O. volvulus infections. humanized mice have also been shown to be effective at identifying biomarkers for early O. volvulus infections. proportional Venn diagrams depict the number of proteins identified in the (A) serum and (B) urine of control mice and BLT, HuSkMc mice infected with O. volvulus L3 larvae. NSG were engrafted with the following single cell types: LEC, HaCaT, or BESM. the table lists all the O. volvulus-derived proteins identified exclusively in the infected mice. the values denote peak area intensity of the peptides identified for each protein."}
