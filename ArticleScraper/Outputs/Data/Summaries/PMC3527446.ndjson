{"summary": "a new concept in cell biology is the formation of microscopically visible supramolecular assemblies involved in very distinct cellular processes, ranging from metabolism to RNA silencing. SGs belong to a novel family of cellular structures collectively known as mRNA silencing foci that harbour repressed mRNAs and their associated proteins. there is controversy on whether SGs and PBs are cause or consequence of mRNA repression. eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) bodies are another example linked to translation regulation. a number of dynamic supramolecular factories were reported to occur in several cell types. these include Purinosomes and glutamine synthetase foci, which concentrate specific biosynthetic enzymes. BUHO is easy to use and simple to adjust for the analysis of a variety of cellular components. the script was also useful to study the dynamics of specific neuronal mRNA silencing foci termed S-foci. to develop a MATLAB script we used SGs as a model system. to visualize SGs and cell nuclei we co-stained the cells with oligodT-Cy3 and DAPI. 63 confocal images of 512512 pixels were taken. Objects were identified as SGs by correlation with the selected prototypes using the MATLAB normxcorr2 function. D, Prototypes used to identify and analyze SGs. these were selected among 50 different examples to include differences in size, shape and intensity pattern. 3.6 3.6 stress 3 24 24 40 42 12 12 3.3 3.3 stress 4 18 18 12 12 5 5 2.4 2.4 stress 5 16 16 47 47 8 5.4 5.4 stress 6 27 27 87 89 17 17 5.1 5.2 Summary 1\u20136 125 125 282 280 65 64 4.3 4.4 Cells were considered positive when they contain two or more SGs. cells were clearly recognized in the image corresponding to this operation. MATLAB calculated the watershed lines according to the topographic distances method. the nucleus acted as a marker for cell position and the inverted Cy3 intensity gradient in the cytoplasm allowed the identification of the cell border. these include partially attached cells, due to the semi-adherence of the cell line, as well as a small number of unhealthy cells. the next step was to identify the SGs present in the micrographs of the training set. this was done using a normalized 2-D cross-correlation between the matrix that correspond to the oligodT-Cy3 signal and several prototype SGs. a reduced number (7.5%) of SGs were weakly stained. this was compensated by the application of the imfilter function with the fspecial: unsharp filter thus allowing faint or blurry SGs to be detected. for each micrograph, 16 correlations (8 prototypes, 2 Cy3-micrographs with or without filter) were assessed. redundancy allowed a single SG to be recognized by multiple prototypes. twenty four new prototypes were generated by three successive 90\u00b0 clockwise rotations. a variable fraction of SGs were identified by these 24 rotated prototypes. the number of pixels in the above objects is a good estimation of the SG size in the original micrographs. BUHO informs the cell number, the proportion of cells with SGs, the number of SGs per cell and their size with minimal deviation from manual-counted values. we investigated several examples of cytoplasmic foci stained with different strategies. we used BUHO for the analysis of a pilot experiment aimed to identify new genes regulators of SG formation. in all cases, we compared the BUHO output with values obtained manually and found that differences were lower than 5% of the values. data input, SGs were visualized by immunofluorescence against eIF3. images were taken at 63, 10241024 pixels and scaled down to 512 pixels. the same 8 prototypes are suitable for SG identification in mammalian or Drosophila cells exposed to different insults. adjustment of these parameters was performed by analyzing 123 representative S2R+ cells and 38 representative U2OS cells. the difference of these values from manual parameters was less than 4% for basal PBs and 10% for induced PBs in Drosophila cells. a specific kind of synaptic foci named S-foci dissolve upon N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) stimulation by NMDA provokes the complete dissolution of the S-foci located at the synapse [14], [15]. we studied the suitability of BUHO to assess this effect and compared it with the manual analysis. BUHO is a reliable bioinformatics tool to identify synapses. the presence of S-foci at the synapse was reduced to 50% of basal values. eIF2 kinase mediates SG formation upon oxidative stress in Drosophila. PP1-96A is the main phosphatase of eIF2. we speculated that this molecule affects SG stability. PP1 is the main eIF2 phosphatase and we evaluated phosphorylated eIF2 levels upon exposure to salubrinal. at this time, salubrinal was added to inhibit dephosphorylation. at this time, salubrinal was added to inhibit dephosphorylation and PeIF2 levels were monitored three hours after stress induction. none 37 37 3.6 3.6 none 47 47 4.5 4.5 none 40 4.4 4.4 none 42 43 4.0 3.9 none 40 41 5.5 5.4 none 42 42 3.9 3.8 LacZ 42 4.2 4.2 LacZ 42 42 4.3 4.3 LacZ 41 43 4.7 4.8 GCN2 29 28 4.2 4.2 GCN2 37 38 4.4 4.4 GCN2 26 23 3.5 3.5 PP1 59 58 5.0 4.9 PP1 54 52 4.2 4.2 PP the number of SG-positive cells at the indicated time points was evaluated manually (M) or by BUHO (B) in 63, 10241024 images. Error bars, standard deviation. C, Phosphorylation of eIF2 relative to basal conditions was evaluated three hours after stress induction. 512 matrices have values from 0 to 65535 corresponding to the intensity of each pixel in the16-bit images. MATLAB operations were adjusted iteratively to minimize deviation from the manual analysis (Table 1). SG recognition dropped from 80% to 20% at this ST value. a representative SG from the cell in the first row shows the seeds (red) created by the script. nine images from wells treated or not with arsenite (training set) were manually analyzed. cells were considered positive when they contain two or more SGs. intensity was clipped to 255 in both the DAPI and the Cy3 channels. the contrast of the DAPI signal was adjusted with the imadjust function and the DAPI signal was used to create a nuclear mask image. cells were clearly recognized in the image corresponding to this operation. a reduced number of cells were irregular and smaller than average, with an area smaller than 30 m2. a set of 8 prototypes were selected among 50 different examples SGs taken from the confocal images. points with correlation coefficients above the ST were eliminated using the image to black and white (im2bw) function, and a value of 0 was assigned to them. as expected, this operation generated a significant number of seeds inside the nucleus, as the abundant nuclear polyadenylated RNA is recognized by the Cy3-labelled probe (Figure 1A). a reduced number (7.5%) of SGs were weakly stained and were not recognized by the above operations. the script recognized all the SGs present in the original micrographs of the training set. but as expected, a single SG was frequently recognized by more than one prototype. the whole process of nuclei, cell and SG identification is depicted in Figure 1F. the number of cross-correlations to be performed, rotated versions were not included in the proposed collection of prototypes. the redundant recognition of a single SG leads to the assignment of more than one seed per SG. as a result, the SG will be counted more than once. PB size was evaluated using BUHO in 55 resting and 68 stressed S2R+ cells and in 15 resting and 23 stressed U2OS cells. 63, 10241024 (A) or 40, 20482048 (B) confocal images were used. size bar, 10 m. we compared the number of cells with SGs calculated by BUHO with the values obtained by manual analysis. at all the time points analyzed BUHO and manual values diverge in less than 5% relative to the average values. we extended this study to the analysis of SGs induced in a different experimental system. Drosophila PBs were analyzed at 63, 10241024 pixels. low intensity noise was removed with the im2bw function. prototypes I\u2013VIII were compared at STs 0.8, 0.88, 0.8, 0.8, 0.86, 0.86, 0.86 and 0.85 respectively. a specific kind of synaptic foci named S-foci dissolve upon N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) stimulation. a specific type of synaptic foci named S-foci dissolve upon synaptic stimulation. prototypes were compared at ST 0.8. a specific type of synaptic foci named S-foci dissolve upon synaptic stimulation. Optimal ST was determined to be 0.7 in a preliminary analysis. we calculated the percentage of synapses with S-foci at a distance lower than 0.5 m. BUHO is a reliable bioinformatics tool to identify synapses. we used the BUHO script for the analysis of a pilot experiment aimed to identify SG regulators. we analyzed three candidate genes predicted to affect SG formation. previous to the induction of oxidative stress, we treated the cells with dsRNA against FAK56D or PP1-96A. RNA against LacZ had no effect on SG formation. knockdown of PP1-96A enhanced SG formation in S2R+ cells. PP1 inhibitor salubrinal was added 1 hour after stress-stimulus. eIF2 levels were 50% higher in the presence of the PP1 inhibitor. we speculate that dephosphorylation of eIF2 is key in regulating SG dissolution. the success of BUHO in this pilot RNAi-based screen documented by automated microscopy underscores its potential in high-throughput imaging analysis. 204 control wells were analyzed by BUHO. a subset of 6 wells was analyzed manually. scores determined manually differ in less than 7% from those calculated by BUHO. the deviation between BUHO and manual values was less than 5% of the average values. using a different set of prototypes taken exclusively from confocal images or in combination with prototypes generated with Gaussian filters, we anticipate that BUHO will be a valuable tool for the analysis of additional cellular structures. salubrinal is a relatively new drug and its potential as therapeutic agent is expanding [36] the contribution of SG regulation to the beneficial effect of this inhibitor remains to be investigated. the use of BUHO for the automated analysis of other mRNA silencing foci, protein aggregates and cytoplasmic structures will require only minor modifications. BUHO addresses the number, size and distance between objects. it categorizes them by similarity in shape, size and intensity. this user-friendly script allows the analysis of high-throughput imaging data in short times. oxidative stress was triggered with 250 M arsenite plus 100 g/ml puromycin. strong oxidative stress was triggered with 500 M arsenite plus 250 g/ml puromycin during one hour. primary hippocampal neurons were prepared and treated with 30 M NMDA (Sigma) during 5 minutes. 63 micrographs were captured at 512512 pixels. cells in 384 MW plates were analyzed in an OPERA Autoscope at the DRSC. images were acquired using Zeiss LSM software at 25\u00b0C. the MATLAB script developed here, termed BUHO. the proposed collection of prototypes is available at PROTOTYPE.rar at the same URL. stress induction, drugs and dsRNA treatment of Drosophila and mammalian cells were grown in 384 MW plates. primary hippocampal neurons were prepared and treated with 30 M NMDA (Sigma) during 5 minutes as previously described. fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence SGs in Drosophila S2R+ cells were visualized using oligodT-Cy3 (Sigma) as previously indicated. images were acquired using Zeiss LSM software at 25\u00b0C. equipment adjustment was assessed using 1 m FocalCheck fluorescent microspheres. cells and particles were manually analyzed by Image J (NIH) the oligodT-Cy3 image was negatively converted with the imcomplement function (image complement) the two matrices were combined to generate an image with black nuclei and bright cytoplasm. the watershed transform algorithm (watershed function) was used to delimitate the cell borders. prototype V identifies three SGs previously detected by prototypes I, II and III. prototype VI identifies two new SGs and two SGs already detected by prototype III. prototypes VII and VIII don't match any SG in this image, according to their low identification rate."}
