{"summary": "astroviruses are non-enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses containing a 6.8 kb polyadenylated genome linked to a VPg protein on the 5\u2019end. the genome contains three overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) the nonstructural proteins (nsPs) are translated from the genomic RNA as two large polyproteins. astrovirus-infected intestines show relatively minor histological changes and inflammation, suggesting that major destruction of the intestinal epithelium and inflammatory responses do not play a role in AstV pathogenesis. however, it has been postulated that diarrhea may be caused by disruption of the absorptive/secretory function of the intestine and loss of intestinal epithelial barrier permeability [10,11,12] secreted key cytokines protect uninfected cells and stimulate leukocytes acting at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity [19,21]. Tissue cells recognize invading viruses mainly by intracellular pathways [20]. cellular pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) such as RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene 1) or MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5) activated receptors trigger a signaling cascade that activates MAVS a cell culture-adapted strain of serotype 4 HAstV was used in this study. viruses were pretreated with 10 g of trypsin (GIX Sigma) per ml for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed twice with MEM 0% FBS and inoculated with the virus. dsRNA polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and the BX795 inhibitor were purchased from InvivoGen. the synthetic analog of dsRNA polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) was dissolved in DMSO and stored as a 10 mM solution at -20\u00b0C. tV RNA, IFN-, GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and ISG56 mRNAs were performed using Expand Reverse Transcriptase and Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche) quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays were carried out using a Mx3000P instrument (Stratagene) primers and probes for HAstV genome quantification target OR a standard curve was constructed in every assay using 5 10-fold serial dilutions of the RNA sample corresponding to the positive and negative controls of the experiment. all samples were quantified at least in duplicate. the thermal protocol consisted of 30 min at 48\u00b0C followed by 10 min at 95\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. dilutions of culture media containing 1,000 U/ml of recombinant type I IFN were used as a reference control. ELISA assay for quantification of HAstV capsid protein was performed on serial 4-fold dilutions of samples. s and viruses CaCo-2 (ECACC 86010202), HeLa (ATCC CCL2), MA-104 (ATCC CRL-2378.1) and Vero (ATCC CCL81) cells were grown in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) a cell culture-adapted strain of serotype 4 HAstV. dsRNA polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and the BX795 inhibitor were inactivated by immunofluorescence after infecting CaCo-2 cells. the synthetic analog of dsRNA polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and the synthetic analog of dsRNA polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphate dehydrogenase, and ISG56 mRNAs were performed using Expand Reverse Transcriptase and Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche) quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays were carried out using a Mx3000P instrument (Stratagene) primers and probes for HAstV genome quantification target ORF1b region were previously described. a standard curve was constructed in every assay using 5 10-fold serial dilutions of the RNA sample corresponding to the positive and negative controls of the experiment. all samples were quantified at least in duplicate. the thermal protocol consisted of 30 min at 48\u00b0C followed by 10 min at 95\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. ELISA assay for quantification of HAstV capsid protein was performed on serial 4-fold dilutions of samples. a rabbit polyclonal anti-HAstV antibody was detected with mAb 8E7. undiluted cell lysates from mock-infected cultures were used as negative controls. RT-PCR was performed to detect viral RNA, IFN- mRNA, and ISG56 mRNA. a time course analysis of HAstV RNA synthesis was performed by qRT-PCR after infecting cells at 2 different MOIs. expression of ISG56 mRNA accumulated in cells treated with exogenous IFN and polyI:C-transfected cells starting at 12 h. levels of IFN- mRNA were quantified by qRT-PCR. levels of IFN- mRNA induced by HAstV peaked at 48 hpi. at 48 hpi, the percentage of cells with nuclear IRF3 increased up to 10.34 1.8 0%, but in any case was not close to 100%. at 12 hpi, IRF3 was localized to the cytoplasm of all HAstV-infected cells. together these results indicate that, despite the high number of HAstV-infected cells, the IFN response in infected cultures was attenuated. arrows indicate cells with nuclear translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus. data (mean values SEM) were calculated after counting the number of cells with nuclear IRF3 from 5 fields from coverslips from 2\u20133 independent experiments using the Image J software. reference control (cells treated with 1,000U/ml of recombinant type I IFN) are shown. data represent mean values of 2 independent experiments and error bars represent the SEM. IFN response to HAstV is dependent on virus replication. CaCo-2 wells were pre-treated with 10 M BX795 (or DMSO for untreated controls) for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C. after infection, DMSO (untreated), 1M or 5 M of BX795 was added in the culture media. HAstV production was measured by quantification of viral RNA by qRT-PCR. lack of cellular toxicity was estimated by observation of cells under the microscope. EMCV and RV SA11 were used as controls for an IFN-sensitive virus and an IFN-resistant virus. a reduction of 0.8 0.2 log was less than what was observed with EMCV. data represent mean values of 2\u20133 independent experiments and error bars represent the SEM. Asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference between mean titers from untreated and IFN-treated samples (t-test) (p0.001) HAstV infection is not able to block IFN response induced by dsRNA. caCo-2 cells were mock-infected, infected with HAstV at a MOI of 1 or RV at a MOI of 5, and 8 hours later, they were mock-transfected or transfected with polyI:C. levels of IFN- mRNA normalized versus GAPDH produced within each experimental condition at 32 hpi. incubation of cells with 1,000 U/ml of type I IFN did not affect TER. TER levels are expressed as the percentage of the measurement at 34 hpi. percentages of infected cells were expressed as the average percentage of IF-positive cells after analyzing 5 fields of each coverslip. the average number of log HAstV genome copies per infected cell was 5.80.9, 5.90.7, and 5.6 0.6 for HAstV-IV, HAstV-VI and HAstV-XII. the level of IFN- response in cells infected with HAstV containing nsP1a/4 genotype IV was lower than the IFN- response induced by mutants. polyI:C transfection induced IFN- gene transcription as early as 3 hours post-transfection (hpt), while IFN- mRNA could not be detected in HAstV-infected cells before 24 hpi. a 3-log increase in viral RNA titers was observed during the first 24 hours. levels of IFN- mRNA were quantified by qRT-PCR. subcellular localization of IRF3 was examined at a MOI of 1. levels of IFN- mRNA induced by HAstV peaked at 48 hpi. at 12 hpi, IRF3 was localized to the cytoplasm of all HAstV-infected cells. together these results indicate that, despite the high number of HAstV-infected cells, the IFN response in infected cultures was attenuated. qRT-PCR values were normalized to endogenous GAPDH mRNA levels at each time point. FN measured the presence of antiviral activity in supernatants from HAstV-infected cells at two different MOIs. samples were inactivated by a 1-h UV incubation prior to the assay. antiviral activity against EMCV could be detected in supernatants starting at 48 hpi. antiviral activity in the supernatant of cultures was never observed in cells infected with HAstV at a MOI of 10 (or an equivalent amount of UV-inactivated virus), and harvested at 48 hpi. results are expressed as level of antiviral activity relative values to the reference control. lack of cellular toxicity was estimated by observation of cells under the microscope. absence of cellular IFN responses were confirmed by lack of expression of IFN- mRNA by qRT-PCR. results show that treatment of cells with 5 M of BX795 resulted in a 2-fold increase in total HAstV RNA produced as well as in the amount of infectious progeny released in the supernatant compared to untreated cells. EMCV and RV SA11 were used as controls for an IFN-sensitive virus and an IFN-resistant virus. the number of HAstV-infected cells observed by IF at 24 hpi was slightly reduced after IFN treatment. a reduction of 0.8 0.2 log was less than what was observed with EMCV. caCo-2 cells were mock-infected, infected with HAstV at a MOI of 1 or transfected with polyI:C at 8 hpi. 20 hours later, total RNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR. supernatant of cells was collected to measure antiviral activity. HAstV infection is not able to disrupt the innate immune sensing pathway. results are expressed as relative values to the reference control. higher percentage of infected cells correlates with higher levels of transepithelial resistance (TER) disruption. but type I IFN does not cause a change in the TER. TER levels are expressed as the percentage of the measurement at 34 hpi. percentages of infected cells were expressed as the average percentage of IF-positive cells after analyzing 5 fields of each coverslip. the level of IFN- response in cells infected with HAstV was lower than the IFN response induced by mutants HAstV-VI and XII. normalized levels of IFN-/GAPDH response at 24 hpi were plotted against the average number of HAstV genome copies per infected cell after infecting differentiated cells with different nsP1a/4 mutants. HAstV infection is not able to block the ability of the cell to respond to dsRNA. HAstV capsid acts as an inhibitor of complement activation [16,17,18] and that intracellular uptake of complement factors bound to viral particles may trigger innate immune responses. HAstV genome is covalently linked to a VPg protein on its 5\u2019 end. large membrane rearrangements can be observed in HAstV-infected cells. innate responses have been shown to play a role in controlling AstV replication in available animal models. IFN- activates the same antiviral pathways as type I IFNs. they act through a different receptor that is expressed on the gastrointestinal and other mucosal epithelia. it determines the intestinal epithelial antiviral host defense against acute rotavirus infections [40] and persistent infections associated to murine noroviruses [41] nsP1a/4 variants correlate with differences in viral replication phenotype in cell culture as well as in virus shedding in patients. nsP1a/4 genotype influences the level of IFN response. nsP1a/4 genotype influences the level of IFN response. viral stocks produced in the absence of FBS for HAstV-IV have higher viral titers than stocks produced for the other genotypes. clinical isolates corresponding to genotype IV have been associated to persistent gastroenteritis."}
