{"summary": "networks were visualized using a degree sorted circle layout (intraviral protein-protein interaction networks) and a force-directed layout (virus-human protein-protein interaction networks) networks were visualized with Cytoscape (24) using a degree sorted circle layout (intraviral protein-protein interaction networks) and a force-directed layout (virus-human protein-protein interaction networks) 1000 random graphs were built according to the edge-swapping model. for each random graph building, the number of rewiring trials was at least equal to three times the number of interactions in the real graph. the clustering coefficient was then computed in each random graph. each virus randomly drew as many proteins as interactors from the human proteome. the procedure was repeated 10,000 times and the overlap size was systematically measured. the significance of the overlap size between interactors targeted by at least one viral protein was assessed using a hypergeometric distribution and R. random graphs were built according to the edge-swapping model. the number of rewiring trials was at least equal to three times the number of interactions in the real graph. the clustering coefficient was then computed in each random graph. the randomization procedure was weighted and corrected according to the connectivity of proteins. a theoretical distribution was computed for the 10,000 resampled values. for each virus, we randomly drew as many proteins as interactors from the human proteome. the power law is a plausible hypothesis for the data, otherwise it is rejected. for each graph, nodes were removed one by one randomly (random failures) or by degree-decreasing order (deliberate attacks) predicted disordered regions were collected for viral ends (viral proteins interacting with one and only one human protein) and for viral hubs (viral proteins interacting with numerous human proteins) the sequences were examined through all possible segments of incrementing length. host-host protein-protein interaction networks were reconstructed from the VirHostNet database (18). networks were visualized using a degree sorted circle layout (intraviral protein-protein interaction networks) or a force-directed layout (virus-human protein-protein interaction networks). MATLAB was also used for the statistical evaluation of power-law fit. disorder-degree correlation analysis DisEMBL was used to predict disordered regions in the sequences of viral proteins targeting human proteins (29). Various thresholds were chosen to define viral hubs: proteins connected to at least 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 60, or 100 human proteins. the p value was obtained by comparing the distribution of sizes with the observed number of overlapping interactors. the significance of the overlap size between interactors targeted by at least one viral protein and interactors targeted by at least two viral proteins was assessed using a hypergeometric distribution. nodes are labeled according to the NCBI protein definition. key network metrics were computed to examine the architectural features of these intraviral and human interactions. the scale exponent and p value assessing whether the power-law can be rejected as a good statistical model of the data, the indication brought by the degree distribution comparison procedure and the indication brought by the structural comparison procedure. the assortativity coefficient; the small-world information, i.e. the characteristic path length and the clustering coefficient computed from the single largest connected component. the scale-free architecture has been proposed to be a representative model of many cellular networks (22, 33) the degree distribution of a scale-free network is indeed expected to follow a power-law, at least asymptotically, with a scaling exponent typically ranging between 2 and 3 (33). according to this test, the power law is not a plausible model for VZV as well as for human degree distributions. results are given with a detailed interpretation in supplemental Table S3 and supplemental Information. the power-law model cannot be completely rejected for EBV, HSV1, KSHV, SARS-CoV, and VACV degree distributions but is never preferred either. all characteristic path lengths globally increase slowly, except for VACV network because of the very small size of its largest connected component. all intraviral networks maintain their characteristic path lengths during hub progressive removal, whereas human network clearly expands until a threshold at which the largest connected component is fragmented. cellular networks are often qualified as diassortive, meaning low-degree nodes are more likely to connect high-degree nodes, and reciprocally (28, 38). at first, correlation in node degrees was compared with those of random networks built on the edge-swapping model, which rewires edges while maintaining the degree distribution (28) intraviral interactomes share a diassortive nature with the human interactome but strongly differ when regarding the scale-free and the small-world architectures. intraviral interactomes can not be classified as small-world, in line with previous analysis (6, 9) eukaryotes, hubs (highly connected proteins) have been found to be more disordered than ends (proteins with only one partner) (30). disordered regions were predicted in viral hubs and then in viral ends using DisEMBL (29) virus-host interactomes are labeled according to the NCBI protein definition. virus ends (black line) are viral proteins having only one human interacting protein. virus-host interactomes were placed in the context of the human interactome. first, human proteins targeted by viral proteins were clearly overrepresented in the human interactome. this suggests viruses preferentially target host proteins already engaged in protein-protein interactions. then, analysis of subnetworks of host proteins that are targeted by the viruses indicates their interconnectivity appears significantly higher compared with the theoretical interconnectivity computed from resampled subnetworks. viruses target proteins that are strikingly interconnected, highly central, both locally (degree) and globally (betweenness), and that are relatively close to each other in the human interactome (2, 16, 23). the whole topological analysis was repeated using \u201cwithout a priori\u201d virus-host interactomes. two human proteins, LZTS2 and GOLGA2, have been identified in high-throughput screenings to interact with four viruses. in the human interactome LZTS2 interacts with TRAF2 suggesting that it may be involved in the functional modulation of the type I interferon pathway (42). a % Human proteins targeted by DENV (column 3), EBV (column 4), FLUAV (column 5), HCV (column 6), or VACV (column 7) the comparison of the five virus-host interactomes can also be done at an upper level. apoptosis, cell cycle, cytokine production, apoptosis, cell cycle. some targeted biological processes are more specifically related to the biology of a virus. this suggests that comprehensive exploration of the virus-host interactomes can be very instrumental in the discovery and understanding of infection and induced-pathogenicity processes. nodes are ordered according to a degree sorted circle layout. nodes are labeled according to the NCBI protein definition. the analysis was performed in parallel for the human interactome. network metrics EBV FLUAV HCV HSV-1 KSHV

KSHV, SARS-CoV, and VACV degree distributions but is never preferred either. simulations of random failures by removing nodes randomly ordered one by one was first performed for intraviral and human interactomes. all characteristic path lengths globally increase slowly, except for VACV network because of the very small size of its largest connected component. all intraviral networks maintain their characteristic path lengths during hub progressive removal. c, Changes in the characteristic path length (CPL) during the progressive removal of nodes in degree-decreasing order in intraviral and human interactomes, simulating deliberate attacks. the second frequently described signature of interactomes concerns the preferences of connections. cellular networks are often qualified as diassortive, meaning low-degree nodes are more likely to connect high-degree nodes. intraviral interactomes have a small characteristic path length and a large clustering coefficient compared with random networks. for each virus, a virus-host interactome was built without a priori using only high-throughput data (further referred as \u201cwithout a priori\u201d virus-host interactome). the five virus-host interactomes reveal that the degree of viral protein is heterogeneous. some of them targeting a high number of human proteins. the majority is targeting a small number. fLUAV-human interactome (H-FLUAV), HCV-human interactome (H-HCV) and VACV-human interactome (H-VACV) nodes are ordered according to a force directed layout. proteins from small viral proteomes target proportionally more distinct domains than proteins of viruses with larger proteomes. first, human proteins targeted by viral proteins were clearly overrepresented in the human interactome (Exact Fisher Test, all p values 2.2 1016) this suggests that viruses preferentially target host proteins already engaged in protein-protein interactions. then, analysis of subnetworks of host proteins that are targeted by the viruses indicates that their interconnectivity appears significantly higher compared with the theoretical interconnectivity computed from the path length distribution of targeted human proteins was significantly lower than the path length distribution in the human interactome (U test, all p values 2.2 1016), with characteristic path length between targeted proteins lower than in the human interactome. the whole topological analysis was repeated using \u201cwithout a priori\u201d virus-host interactomes. two human proteins, LZTS2 and GOLGA2, have been identified in high-throughput screenings to interact with four viruses. this suggests that proteins essential for a given virus tend to be also important for other viruses. protein overlaps between full data sets and data sets containing human proteins targeted by at least two proteins of the same virus. overlaps are given as percentages of the number of human proteins targeted by at least two proteins of the same virus. proteins targeted by at least two viruses could be identified. these processes correspond to the cellular response to viral infection. these processes correspond to the ability of the virus to hijack the cell machinery for its replication. the chosen layout shows the high heterogeneity in node degree for each interactome, ranging clockwise from low to high degree nodes, i.e. hubs.

of a scale-free network is indeed expected to follow a power-law. the power law model can be compared with several other competing distributions. the power law model cannot be completely rejected for EBV, HSV1, KSHV, SARS-CoV, and VACV degree distributions. the results are ambiguous. scale-free architecture leads a network to be highly tolerant to random failures but hardly resistant to deliberate attacks, because of its hublike core structure. simulations of random failures by removing the most connected nodes randomly ordered one by one was first performed for intraviral and human interactomes. in the network size, i.e. number of nodes, (as a fraction of the original value) during the progressive removal of nodes in degree-decreasing order in intraviral and human interactomes, simulating deliberate attacks. the second frequently described signature of interactomes concerns the preferences of connections. cellular networks are often qualified as diassortive. intraviral interactomes, except VACV, display negative values of assortivity coefficient (Table I) the third popular signature assigned to cellular networks is the small-world architecture (22, 39) such networks have a small characteristic path length and a large clustering coefficient compared with equivalent random networks. the degree of viral protein is heterogeneous, some targeting a high number of human proteins. for eukaryotes, hubs (highly connected proteins) have been found to be more disordered than ends (proteins with only one partner) deNV-human interactome (H-DENV), EBV-human interactome (H-EBV), FLUAV-human interactome (H-FLUAV), and VACV-human interactome (H-VACV) nodes are ordered according to a force directed layout. in virus-host interactomes, numerous domains were identified. proteins from small viral proteomes target proportionally more distinct domains. this is strikingly exemplified in supplemental Fig. S7. average betweennesses of targeted proteins four to five times higher than the average betweenness of the human interactome. for each virus, the path length distribution of targeted human proteins was significantly lower than the path length distribution in the human interactome (U test, all p values 2.2 1016) overlaps range from 5 to 20% of each data set and are all significantly high. most striking example concerns HCV and EBV which target 61 human proteins. two human proteins, LZTS2 and GOLGA2, have been identified in high-throughput screenings to interact with four viruses. overlaps are given as percentages of the number of human proteins targeted by at least two proteins of the same virus. overlaps are given as percentages of the number of human proteins targeted by at least two proteins of the same virus. the comparison of the five virus-host interactomes can also be done at an upper. a core of biological processes in which the targeted proteins are involved could be identified. these processes correspond to the cellular response to viral infection (such as immune response, cellular response to stress, positive regulation of cytokine production, apoptosis, cell cycle) Fig. 1 reveals that the eight interactomes are strikingly interconnected with a unique (or almost unique) single-connected component. the chosen layout shows the high heterogeneity in node degree for each interactome, ranging clockwise from low to high degree nodes. most cellular networks, and eukaryotic protein-protein interaction networks, have been described as scale-free, diassortive and small-world. most cellular networks, and eukaryotic protein-protein interaction networks in particular, have been described as scale-free, diassortive and small-world. 0.364 0.931 0.731 0.554 0.003 10\u20134 Degree distribution comparison Moderate

the power law is not a plausible model for VZV as well as for human degree distributions. power-law model cannot be completely rejected for EBV, HSV-1, KSHV, and VACV degree distributions. scaling parameters above three suggest a weak role for hubs. power law model can be compared with other competing distributions. the stickiness-index based model (36) is rather preferred, being the best-fitting model among those tested. a third method to assess the scale-free architecture concerns the network resilience. a scale-free architecture leads a network to be highly tolerant to random failures. characteristic path length (CPL) (as a multiple of the original value) during progressive random removal of nodes in intraviral and human interactomes, simulating random failures. c, Changes

architecture (22, 39) such networks have a small characteristic path length and a large clustering coefficient compared with equivalent random networks. five virus-host interactomes reveal that the degree of viral protein is heterogeneous, some targeting a high number of human proteins. for eukaryotes, hubs (highly connected proteins) have been found to be more disordered than ends (proteins with only one partner) (30) virus-host interactomes may at least partly correlate to their structural disorder level. deNV-human interactome (H-DENV), EBV-human interactome (H-EBV), FLUAV-human interactome (H-FLUAV), and VACV-human interactome (H-VACV) proteins from small viral proteomes target proportionally more distinct domains than viruses with larger proteomes (EBV and VACV) this suggests viruses preferentially target host proteins already engaged in protein-protein interactions. for each virus, the path length distribution of targeted human proteins was significantly lower

processes in which the targeted proteins are involved. these processes correspond to the cellular response to viral infection (such as immune response, cellular response to stress, positive regulation of cytokine production, apoptosis, cell cycle) this work is gathering various methods from graph theory as well as structural and functional analysis and provides a common analytical framework allowing interactome comparisons. it appears that intraviral interactomes tend to be highly coupled modules. these networks do not present a scale-free nor a small-world signature and are hardly resistant to random and deliberate attacks. a degree distribution statistical analysis, a network structure comparison and resilience analysis were combined. a degree distribution statistical analysis, a network structure comparison and a resilience analysis were combined to address the question of the scale-free architecture of intraviral interactomes. the most connected hubs tend to be the most intrinsically disordered. the most striking is for HCV, which targets pathways associated with metabolism and clinical syndromes. viruses use short linear motifs that mimic those of the human proteome to specifically target well-characterized domains of cellular proteins. they have also evolved original SLMs whose computational identification is in progress. the study of complex networks and their modeling are still in their infancy (21)."}
