{"summary": "cells were kept in plastic tissue culture flasks at 26\u00b0C. cells between passages 97 and 104 were grown on permeable filters. single-channel recording was performed in cells expressing both green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) the lower detection limit with our PCR unit was 40 cycles. the efficiency of the PCR reaction was determined with a plasmid containing 1 as 1.96-fold/cycle. A6 cells were maintained in plastic tissue culture flasks at 26\u00b0C with 4% CO2 in air. cells between passages 97 and 104 were grown on permeable filters for patch-clamp recording (66) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 was dissolved in 10 mM DMSO and applied as 10 M. drugs were added to the bath solution at least 20 min before channel recording. all primers were validated by melt curve analysis of subunit-containing plasmids. all data acquisition and analysis were performed as described previously (66). the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signaling) was dissolved in 10 mM DMSO and applied as 10 M. drugs were added to the bath solution at least 20 min before channel recording. all primers were validated by melt curve analysis of subunit-containing plasmids. data are reported as means SE. RESULTS Prior work has shown that subunits can alter ENaC activity. we did not examine the prevalence of subunits since there are a large number of them. but the 2 subunit was chosen because dimers containing this isoform are active in most assays of function and because it is common in most epithelia (49). the lower detection limit with our PCR unit (Bio-Rad Icycler) was 40 cycles. protein was loaded in each lane with antibodies at 1:500. all secondary antibodies were used at 1:5,000. G1, G2 and G4 are expected to run between 35 and 37 kDa. the NPo of G12-expressing cells is 0.07 0.02 (n = 25), which is significantly lower than the control value of 0.39 0.13 (n = 29), P = 0.003. each patch was recorded for 10 min, and therefore we should have reasonable estimates of channel N and also channel Po by dividing NPo by N. the average channel NPo of these G-expressing cells is presented side by side with the average values from their respective controls. NPo of these G22-expressing cells is 0.17 0.05 (n = 33) and that of its control is 0.15 0.05 (n = 36); NPo of these G32- and G42-expressing cells is 0.12 0.05 (n = 15) and 0.12 0.03 (n = 31) we measured an ENaC NPo of G42- or G52-expressing cells of 0.57 0.12 (n = 23) and 0.50 0.12 (n = 24), respectively. this result implies that the inhibitory effect of G12 on endogenous ENaC of A6 cells is not because of low ENaC activity in particular passages of cells. NPo of cells treated with U73122 is 0.31 0.11 (n = 27), while NPo of cells exposed to the inactive analog is 0.07 0.02 (n = 33), which is significantly lower than the PLC inhibitor-treated cells (P = 0.028). the effect of U73122 is on the G12-induced PLC activity since there was no effect of the inhibitor on control, untransfected cells. PLC inhibitor reverses inhibition of ENaC activity of cells treated with GFP&RFP. grey bars are for cells exposed to inactive analog U73433. open bars are for cells exposed to the inactive analog U73433. GF109203x (0.4 M) has no effect on channel activity of control cells. NPo of treated vs. untreated cells is 0.56 0.2, n = 22, vs. 0.55 0.17, n = 17. but GF109203x significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of G12 on ENaC activity. open bars are for cells exposed to GF109203X, indicated as PKC inhibitor (+) the number indicated on top of each column is number of successful patches. ERK1/2 is activated in - and -ENaC-expressing cells. the average N and Po of cells treated with U0126 vs. the untreated cells is 4 0.5 (n = 28) vs. 2.3 0.07 (n = 22), P 0.01; Po of treated vs. untreated is 0.17 0.03 (n = 21) vs. 0.11 0.02 (n = 19), P 0.01 (Fig. 6, C and D) ERK1/2 inhibitor reverses G12 inhibition of ENaC activity. PI3K and Src kinase inhibitors involved in G12-mediated ENaC inhibition. ly294002 inhibits neither ENaC in control cells nor ENaC in G12-expressing cells. ly294002 also inhibits ENaC activity in cells expressing GFP and RFP alone. the PI3K inhibitor had no significant effect on inhibition. cells were treated with the PP2 (10 M) or vehicle (DMSO) the inhibitor had no significant effect on inhibition. the 2 subunit was chosen because dimers containing this isoform are active in most assays of function. the lower detection limit with our PCR unit (Bio-Rad Icycler) was 40 cycles. all levels of expression were referenced to 2, which was not detected at less than 40 cycles. G2 and G4 are not detectable. effect of different G combinations on ENaC activity. transfection efficiency of A6 cells is low. the channel density, N, is 1.12 0.03 (n = 25) for G12-expressing cells. this is significantly lower than control cells with an N of 2.34 0.54 (n = 29) (P = 0.05) the average channel NPo of these cells is presented side by side with the average values from their respective controls. NPo of G22-expressing cells is 0.17 0.05 (n = 33) and that of its control is 0.15 0.05 (n = 36) NPo of G32- and G42-expressing cells is 0.12 0.05 (n = 15) and 0.12 0.03 (n = 31), respectively. the inhibitory effect of G12 on ENaC in A6 cells is not because of low ENaC activity in particular passages of cells. the lack of effect of G22\u2013G52 combinations on ENaC in A6 cells is not because of low ENaC activity. NPo of cells treated with U73122 is 0.31 0.11 (n = 27), while NPo of cells exposed to the inactive analog is 0.07 0.02 (n = 33), which is significantly lower than the PLC inhibitor-treated cells (P = 0.028) the effect of U73122 is on the G12-induced PLC activity since there was no effect of the inhibitor on control, untransfected cells. grey bars are for cells exposed to the inactive analog U73433, indicated as PLC inhibitor. open bars are for cells exposed to the inactive analog U73433. the number indicated on top of each column is number of successful patches. GF109203x significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of G12 on ENaC activity. NPo in the absence of GF109203x-treated cells is 0.23 0.07 (n = 29), which as expected, is significantly lower than that of control vector-expressing cells. GF109203x increased channel Po only slightly but significantly restored channel N of G12-expressing cells. the transient expression of G heterodimers results in sustained activation of the ERK1/2 kinase cascade (15, 22) ERK1/2 was reported to participate in EGF- or TGF-mediated inhibition of amiloride-sensitive transepithelial sodium current in A6 cells and in mouse cortical collecting duct cells (5, 37, 60, 62) ERK1/2 kinase basal activity is low in unstimulated A6 cells. this activation inhibits both N and Po of ENaC. NPo, N, and Po of -treated cells are significantly different from all other treatments. PI3K and Src kinase inhibitors were involved in ERK1/2 activation. we first recorded ENaC activity from control or G12-expressing cells. this inhibition was partially reversed when these cells were exposed to LY294002. cells were treated with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 M) or vehicle (DMSO) the inhibitor had no significant effect on inhibition. the major subunit present on A6 cells is 1 with over 3.31 times more than 4, the next most common subunit. the lower detection limit with our PCR unit (Bio-Rad Icycler) was 40 cycles. all levels of expression were referenced to 2, which was not detected at less than 40 cycles. the bicistronic vector pIRES-GFP expresses GFP coordinately with the gene construct. single-channel patches were only formed on cells that expressed both GFP and RFP, respectively. control cells which only expressed reporter genes were always recorded in parallel with cells coexpressing G. each patch was recorded for 10 min. the channel density, N, is 1.12 0.03 (n = 25) for G12-expressing cells. this is significantly lower than control cells with an N of 2.34 0.54 (n = 29) cells are 0.17 0.05 (n = 33) and that of its control is 0.15 0.05 (n = 36) NPo of G32- and G42-expressing cells is 0.12 0.05 (n = 15) and 0.12 0.03 (n = 31), respectively. NPo of G52-expressing cells is 0.11 0.04 (n = 32), while that of its control is 0.07 0.02 (n = 30) the lack of effect of G22\u2013G52 combinations on ENaC in A6 cells is not because of low ENaC activity in particular passages of cells. the closed state of ENaC is indicated with \u201cc\u201d and channel opening(s) are marked with \u201co\u201d. N of U73433-treated cells is 1.29 0.26 (n = 28), N of U73122-treated cells is 2.59 0.47 (n = 27), which is significantly higher than N of cells treated with the inactive analog (P = 0.017) grey bars are for cells exposed to the inactive analog U73433, indicated as PLC inhibitor. open bars are for cells exposed to the inhibitor U73122, indicated as PLC inhibitor (+) the number indicated on top of each column is number of successful patches. GF109203x increased channel Po only slightly but significantly restored channel N of G12-expressing cells. GF109203x increased channel Po only slightly but significantly restored channel N of G12-expressing cells. this result implies that PKC of A6 cells was activated by G12 overexpression. ERK1/2 was reported to participate in inhibition of amiloride-sensitive transepithelial sodium current in A6 cells and in mouse cortical collecting duct cells (5, 37, 60, 62) kinase inhibitor U0126 (1 M; IC50 = 0.07 M for MEK 1 and 0.06 M for MEK 2) (11) on ENaC activity of G12-expressing cells. ERK1/2 kinase basal activity is low in unstimulated A6 cells. this activation inhibits both N and Po of ENaC. NPo, N, and Po of -treated cells are significantly different from all other treatments. ENaC NPo of control or G12-expressing cells is significantly inhibited in the absence of LY294002 (the grey bars) the inhibitor of Src family kinases PP2 (10 M; IC50 = 1 M) affects neither ENaC in control cells nor ENaC in cells expressing GFP and RFP alone. protein-coupled receptors have been described in renal epithelial cells. these include type 2 vasopressin receptors (45), endothelin receptors (16), purinergic receptors (42, 43, 70), prostaglandin receptors (31, 36), dopaminergic receptors (23), and adenosine receptors (41). subunit were to modify activity in A6 cells it was likely to be 1. but that 1 was the predominant subunit in A6 cells it was likely to be 1. we used cells expressing GFP and RFP alone as a control for each drug treatment. in cells expressing GFP and RFP alone, U73122 tends to increase ENaC Po but the increase is not significant. kinase inhibitors used to probe signaling pathways that transduce the signal to ENaC. several PKC isoforms were involved in downregulation of ENaC surface expression. a consensus site for PKC on ENaC has never been reported. a consensus site for PKC on ENaC has never been reported. ERK1/2 inhibition of ENaC N and Po was also observed from lung alveolar type II cells. the mechanism by which ERK1/2 reduces ENaC surface expression is by ERK1/2 phosphorylation of ENaC, promoting binding of Nedd4-2 to ENaC. PI3K and Src family kinases are commonly involved in transferring G signal to ERK1/2. the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 has no effect on ENaC in either G12 or GFP- and RFP-expressing cells.
