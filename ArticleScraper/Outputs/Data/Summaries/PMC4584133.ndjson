{"summary": "study aims to establish the use of rolling circle amplification (RCA) based on internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) as a powerful, simple, and rapid procedure for distinguishing closely related organisms. 61 isolates belonging to three species of Trichophyton were identified to the species level based on microscopic and macroscopic examinations and their ITS rDNA regions were sequenced. the most frequent species of dermatophytes are Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, and T. rubrum. these species cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that vary from mild to severe, but infections are not life-threatening. conventional approaches for species-level identification in the diagnostic laboratory are based on morphological and physiological criteria. a total of 61 isolates belonging to three species of Trichophyton were examined. all samples from suspected patients were cultured on plates of Sabouraud glucose agar. the plates were incubated for 4 \u2013 6 weeks at 28\u00b0C. a sterile blade was used to scrape off the hyphae from the surface of the plate. cells were mechanically disrupted with a conical grinder for approximately 1 min. then incubated at 100\u00b0C for 15 min. phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) was used for extraction. amplification was performed as follows: 2 min at 94\u00b0C for primary denaturation, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C (45 s), 52\u00b0C (30 s), and 72\u00b0C (120 s), with a final 7-min extension step at 72\u00b0C. the approximate length of the three specific circular oligonucleotide probes for T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale, and T. tonsurans used in this GCCTGGgatcatgcttcttccattacgaggtgcccattacgaggtgcccattacgcgcagacacgatagtctaCCCATTCGCCTAGA-3\u2019) T. mentagrophytes (5\u2019-ATGGGCACCGAAGAAGCA-3\u2019) RCA1 (5\u2019-ATGGGCACCGAAGAAGCA-3\u2019) 3.3.4. hyper-branched or Rolling Circle Amplification RCA reactions were performed in a 25-L volume containing 8 U of Bst DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs), 200 M deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix, 1 L of each RCA primer, and 2 L of ligation product. the accumulation of double-stranded DNA products was detected by electrophoresis on 1% agarose containing ethidium bromide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) all colonies were examined macroscopically and microscopically in Lactophenol Cotton Blue. the species were identified based on microscopic morphology and in vitro tests. urease and hair perforating tests were required. ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers were amplified using the universal primers ITS1 (5\u2019-TCC-GTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3\u2019) and ITS4 (5\u2019-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3\u2019) PCR reactions were performed on a TC-312 thermal cycler (Techne, Duxford, Cambridge, United Kingdom) in 25-mL volumes containing 25 ng of template DNA, 2.5 mL of reaction buffer padlock probes targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were modified. RCA primers were synthesized by Anaspec Inc. (San Jose, CA, USA) gCl2, 2.5 L/mL bovine serum albumin (pH 7.5), 10 mM ATP, and 50 mM DTT with a total reaction volume of 10 L. one cycle of denaturation at 94\u00b0C of 5 min followed by five cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s and 4 min of ligation at 62\u00b0C. 150 L of 3.0 M sodium acetate buffer was added, the mixture was vortexed and incubated for 15 min at -20\u00b0C. phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) was used for extraction. DNA was allowed to precipitate with an equal volume of isopropanol for 10 min at -20\u00b0C and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm. PCR products were visualized by 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer, stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 g/mL), and photographed under UV transillumination. the approximate length of the three specific circular oligonucleotide probes for T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale, and T. tonsurans used in this study was 96 to 102 bp RCA1 (5\u2019-ATGGGCACCGAAGAAGCA-3\u2019) RCA2 (5\u2019-CGCGCAGACACGATA-3\u2019) 3.3.4. 1 L of padlock probe in 500 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 100 mM MgCl2, 2.5 L/mL bovine serum albumin. 31 isolates (50.8%) were identified as T. mentagrophytes var interdigitale. 11 isolates (18.2%) as T. rubrum, 9 isolates (14.7%) as T. tonsurans. 9 isolates (14.7%) were identified as non-Trichophyton species. RCA and subsequent detection by gel electrophoresis yielded positive results. identification of Trichophyton species is essentially based on macroscopic and microscopic observations of their morphological features. ITS-based analyses have found that sequence variation is limited to one or a few SNPs between certain species, such as between T. tonsurans and T. equinum, and between T. soudanense (7). probes are based on the rolling replication of short single-stranded DNA circles by certain DNA polymerases under isothermal conditions to detect target nucleic acid sequences. such probes comprise two sequences complementary to the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 termini of the target sequence joined by a genetic linker region. the intensity of the signal generated by the probe is then increased exponentially by hyper branching or RCA. the sequencing results for the ITS regions of rDNA showed 100% concordance with the RCA results. the RCA procedure required less than one working day, including DNA extraction, PCR amplification, hybridization, ligation of padlock probes."}
