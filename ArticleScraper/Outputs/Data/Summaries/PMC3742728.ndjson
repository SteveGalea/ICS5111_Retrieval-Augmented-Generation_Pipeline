{"summary": "x-ray reports could be used to identify pneumonia patients. x-ray reports could support the diagnosis of pneumonia. a manual EMR review of 2747 outpatient ARI visits identified x-ray reports. surveillance systems aimed at epidemics of acute respiratory infections (ARI) could help uncover outbreaks that involve only a small number of very sick patients, such as what initially occurred with SARS [1] or what could be anticipated shortly after a criminal release of plague [2] or tularemia [3]. electronic medical records (EMR) are fast becoming commonplace, and form a rich source of information that could be secondarily used for surveillance purposes. 99% of outpatients satisfied a broad definition of ARI. the ARI CDA flagged an outpatient visit if the provider assigned it an ARI-related diagnostic code OR issued a prescription for a cough remedy. participants were sampled only once, at their first eligible visit during the study period. all \u201cNon-Negative\u201d reports and a 10% sample of the \u201cNegative\u201d reports were blindly reviewed by a second pulmonary physician (n = 537) a second pulmonary physician (n = 537) a score between the two independent reviewers was 0.88 (95% CI 0.82:0.93). text analyses could separate non-negative from negative chest imaging reports. text classification models with the highest F-measure were retained for each training set. the four retained models were combined with other EMR-derived data. a subset of the ARI ICD-9 codes identified as positive for ARI symptoms by text analysis [10]. a subset of the ARI ICD-9 codes whose narrative included the string \"pneumonia\" a waiver of consent was granted because the research-related risks were minimal and did not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants. the ARI CDA flagged an outpatient visit if the provider assigned it an ARI-related diagnostic code OR issued a prescription for a cough remedy OR documented at least two symptoms from the above ARI case definition. report with comments on shrapnel, bullet fragments, pleural plaques or other abnormalities outside the lung parenchyma, calcified granulomas, old nodules, scars or chronic emphysematous changes were put in this category. report labeled \"non-negative\" if they could possibly support the diagnosis of pneumonia. cases with possible Pneumonia or Pneumonia-in-Plan were labeled \"Admitted\" if they gained admission to the hospital within 48 hours of index visit registration. otherwise, they were labeled \"Outpatient\" Candidate components for CDAs included those previously found useful to identify patients with ARI: ARI-related ICD-9 codes (labeled as \u201cARI ICD-9 codes\u201d), cough remedies [10], and clinical notes identified as positive for ARI symptoms by text analysis [10]. a random, 50% sample of the visits flagged by the [ARI CDA AND Text of Imaging Reports] query were manually reviewed. cases identified served as the reference to validate the PPV of selected pneumonia CDAs. reports were labeled \u201cNegative\u201d if they could possibly support the diagnosis of pneumonia. non-negative chest imaging report AND pneumonia listed as one of the top two diagnostic possibilities in a physician's or nurse practitioner's note. cases with possible Pneumonia or Pneumonia-in-Plan were labeled \u201cAdmitted\u201d if they gained admission to the hospital within 48 hours of index visit registration. text classification models with the highest F-measure were retained for each training set. the four retained models were combined with other EMR-derived data and performance of the resulting CDAs at identifying patients that fitted our case definition compared. a random, 50% sample of the visits flagged by the [ARI CDA AND imaging report] query were manually reviewed. the study population was 93% male, older (6115 years old, mean standard deviation) and 52.6% African American (Table 1). the number of patients belonging to the various age, sex and self-reported race groups (rows) are given for the overall study population (column 2), patients with Possible Pneumonia (column 3), Pneumonia-in-Plan (column 4), and for patient admitted for pneumonia (column 5). ninety percent of all index visits occurred in urgent/same day care settings. patients with Possible Pneumonia and Pneumonia-in-Plan had similar demographics. the latter population had more febrile symptoms. 84 (22.7) 67 (26.8) 36 (18.7) 22 (20.6) 38 (29.9) Absolute and relative (%, in parenthesis) number of pneumonia patients with symptoms that were part of our

sensitivity (28.5\u201356%, CDAs 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29, Tables 3\u20135) ARI ICD-9 code set increased detection sensitivity to 86\u201397%, but degraded PPV (6.3\u201323.5%) and overall performance. text analysis was used to flag chest imaging reports that could support the diagnosis of pneumonia. adding this component increased the PPV of otherwise identical CDAs by 23\u201370 absolute percentage points. results from the \u201cText of Imaging Reports\u201d classifier increased the F-measure of all CDAs that included the broad ARI ICD-9 code set. the added imprecision occurred mostly in the outpatient arena (CDA 19, 21, 26, 28, 33, 35, Table 5). PPVs actually increased for patients admitted to the hospital (CDA 33, 35, Table 5). the study population was 93% male, older (6115 years old, mean standard deviation) and 52.6% African American (Table 1). 355 (95.9) 243 (97.2) 125 (98.4) Female 187 (6.8) 15 (4.1) 7 (2.8) 2 (1.6) Race White 1013 (36.9) 132 (35.7) 93 (37.2) 49 (38.6) African-American 1446 (52.6) 210 (56.8) 143 (57.2) 75 (59.1) Hispanic-American 20 (0.7) 2 (0.5) 1 (0.4) 0 Other 268 (9.8) 26 (7.0) 13 ( possible Pneumonia (All) Pneumonia-in-Plan (All) Possible Pneumonia (Outpatients) Pneumonia-in-Plan (Outpatients) Admitted Pneumonia Sample Size 370 250 193 107 127 Symptoms and Signs Cough 287 (77.6) 196 (78.4) 162 (83.9) 88 (82.2) 94 (74) Sputum production 196 (53) 140 (56) 111 (57.5) 68 (63.6 populations with Possible Pneumonia (column 2) and Pneumonia-in-Plan (column 3) are broken down into outpatients (columns 4 and 5) and admitted subpopulations (column 6). illustrative CDAs for cases with Possible Pneumonia or Pneumonia-in-Plan are shown for all locations of care in Table 3. 86.1 13.7 83.3 52.8 91.1 12 79.6 68.5 9.3 63.6 PPV Validation* (%) 81 83 79 78 78 73 65 61 57 NPV (%) 91 90 93.2 88.2 93.8 98.1 95 95.2 94.4 98 92.4 97 100 97.4 F-Measure 44.2 43.6 27.0 24.7 69.6 24.1 73.8 52.4 56.4 21.0 30.4 68. 69 75 71.4 74 60 50 49.5 49 NPV (%) 93.1 93 96.2 92.2 96.2 98 97 97 96.8 99.4 95.9 98.5 100 98.6 F-Measure 32 35.4 19 24.1 65.7 17 67.4 38.9 50 11.9 30.1 57.1 9.7 55.7 Table 5. a broadly inclusive ARI ICD-9 code set increased detection sensitivity to 86\u201397%, but degraded PPV (6.3\u201323.5%) and overall performance. CDAs that did not include ICD-9 diagnostic codes were not among the most successful (data not shown) prescriptions for medications aimed at ARI symptoms and various groupings of antibiotics that could be used to treat bacterial pneumonias did not add value. the PPV of otherwise identical CDAs decreased 5.3\u201318% absolute percentages points compared to values obtained in the development phase of the study. the added imprecision occurred mostly in the outpatient arena (CDAs 5, 7, 12, 14, 19, 21, 26, 28, 33, 35, Tables 3\u20135) the ARI CDA was developed and validated against a population-based sample of over 15,000 EMR records. it recognized 99% of cases that satisfied a broad definition of ARI [10]. despite these differences, more than 95% of patients with Pneumonia-in-Plan satisfied the more permissive Possible Pneumonia definition in both our development and validation reference populations. prior attempts to automatically identify pneumonia patients have concentrated on diagnostic codes assigned after hospital discharge. discharge codes, however, are of limited value in epidemic surveillance because they are untimely and do not distinguish between community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia. classifying 26,581 imaging reports did more to improve detection performance than extracting ARI symptoms from almost 14 million clinical notes. however, our data support the notion that a generalized machine learning approach can perform well across information retrieval tasks [13], [14] our results represent a realistic environment in which to compare the relative performance of alternative detection approaches. an EMR-based approach that couples queries of structured data with text analysis of imaging reports can be used to assess disease severity in outpatients with ARI."}
