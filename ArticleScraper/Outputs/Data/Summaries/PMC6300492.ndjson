{"summary": "fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a serious life-threatening disease characterized by massive hepatocyte necrosis, severe liver damage, and high mortality. however, accumulating evidence suggests that, regardless of the pathogenesis of FH, the host's inflammatory responses contribute to liver microcirculatory disorders and injuries. clara cell 10 kDa protein (CC10), also considered to be uteroglobin, is one of members of secretoglobin superfamily. CC10 has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. reduced levels of CC10 are associated with allergic airway diseases. human monocyte cell line THP-1 was purchased from the cell Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) human umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. peritoneal exudative macrophages were harvested and lysed for real-time PCR and western blotting analysis. apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling method with a TUNEL apoptosis detection kit (Roche, Switzerland) cells were washed with PBS and incubated in the dark with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:100, Abnova,) at 4\u00b0C for 40 min. cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in 300 L PBS. immunohistochemistry of liver tissues was performed using SP-9001 SPlink Detection Kits. western blotting Liver tissue and cells were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer with phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) protease inhibitor. protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and western blotting was performed using a monoclonal mouse anti-human/mouse Fgl2 (1:750, Abnova, USA), and a monoclonal rabbit anti- human/mouse mFgl2 forward, 5\u2032-GCC AAA TGT GAG TCC CTG GAA-3\u2032; mFgl2 reverse, 5\u2032-TTC CAC CCA AGA GCA CGT TTA AG-3\u2032; hFgl2 forward, 5\u2032-ACA GTT CAG GCT GGT-3\u2032; hFgl2 forward, 5\u2032-GGC TTA AAG TTG GGT-3\u2032; HBP1 forward, 5\u2032-TGA g pcDNA3.1-hCC10 was mixed gently with lipofectamine 2,000. after incubation, the solution was added to CHO cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. at 48 h after transfection, cells were collected for real-time PCR and western blot analysis.

CC10 protein was injected into a mouse model established by MHV-3 infection. MHV-3-induced liver injury in CC10-treated mice occurred rarely. previous studies suggested fgl2 played a vital role in this process. CC10 treatment significantly reduced the production of Fgl2 in the infected liver and serum. lower mortality of CC10-treated mice after MHV-3 infection is due to lower levels of Fgl2 and decreased fibrinogen deposition. immunoprecipitation of protein extracts from pcDNA 3.1-CC10 and pcDNA3.1-hFgl2 co-transfected CHO cells with anti-Fgl2 or anti-CC10 antibodies. western blotting with Fgl2 and CC10 antibodies indicated that CC10 did not co-immunoprecipitate with Fgl2. results showed that CC10 has no direct interaction with Fgl2. the potential target of CC10 on other immune cells cannot be excluded.
