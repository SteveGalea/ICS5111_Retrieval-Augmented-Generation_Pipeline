{"summary": "PCR panels from 1088 diarrhoeic cats were available for analysis. prevalence was 56.9% (Co), 22.1% (Cl), 0.8% (Sa), 20.6% (Gi), 18.8% (Tr), 24.4% (Cr) and 1.0% (To). study examined faeces of 50 diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic cats entering a Florida animal shelter using a real-time PCR assay. multiple organisms were identified in 44% of diarrhoeic cats in that study. but specific patterns of co-infection were not evaluated. a study examining the effects of fenbendazole treatment in cats with concurrent Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. infection. results suggest a possible shared pathogenesis or symbiotic relationship involving selected feline enteropathogens. evaluating enteropathogen co-infection patterns could provide important information on pathogenesis, treatment options and prognosis in affected cats. ine panleukopenia virus, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella enterica, Giardia spp., T. foetus, Cryptosporidium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii. co-infection was investigated via two approaches \u2013 consideration of which enteropathogens were co-occurring in samples. all 1,882 feline faecal samples submitted to a reference laboratorya were considered. however, only samples collected from diarrhoeic cats were included in the current study. panels containing weak or borderline positive results (n = 16) and those from pooled faecal samples (n = 47) were excluded, resulting in 1088 samples being used in this study. combinations of pairs, triplets etc. all the way up to all 8 species were considered. for each comparison whether other species not being considered were present or not were ignored. for example, the co-occurrence \u2018C:PaGi\u2019 indicates co-occurrence of Pa and Gi irrespective of whether the other 6 species were present or not. Univariate general linear models with binomial errors were used to assess for differences in the prevalence of the 8 enteropathogen with pedigree status (DSH or pedigree) and age group (6 months, 6\u201312 months and >12 months) differences within factors were examined using standard post-hoc Tukey pairwise comparisons (phTpc), which adjusted for the multiple pairwise testing within a factor. a faecal sample was positive for Co and Tr, and negative for all other species tested (Pa, Cl, Sa, Gi, Cr and To) these fingerprints were first examined with hierarchical cluster analyses using Ward\u2019s minimum variance method to produce a cluster dendrogram. significance of each particular profile was then examined by comparing the number of observed samples with that particular profile to what would have been expected. male neutered, 139 (12.8%) male entire, 311 (28.6%) female neutered, 117 (10.8%) female entire and 53 (4.9%) male and female cats respectively where neutered status was not recorded. overall prevalences of enteropathogenic species were 56.9% feline coronavirus, 22.1% feline panleukopenia virus, 56.6% C. perfringens, 0.8% S. enterica, 20.6% Giardia spp. young cats (6 months) had significantly higher prevalences of infection than older cats for feline panleukopenia virus (46.6% vs. 20.9% (6-12 m) and 13.3% (>12 m), P 0.001) also had significantly higher prevalence of infection than the oldest cats for 3 other species. 62.5% of 1,088 samples had 2 or more species (mean x =2.01 1.3SD, Figure 2a) and 13.3% with 4 or more species detected. 12.7% of the samples submitted were negative for all 8 species. 28 of the possible co-occurrences were present more than would be expected if enteropathogens were present in samples at random. only 4 of the possible co-occurrences were observed less than expected, but differences were 2 (P > 0.472) only those co-occurrence combinations where either the number expected or observed was 3 are shown. the co-occurrence results are ordered left to right according to the number of species. the dark bars indicate statistically significant difference in observed minus expected with #P 0.001. the number in round brackets is the number of samples with that fingerprint. dotted polygons - sample/clusters referred to in text. there were 72 profiles observed + 9 profiles (bold italics) that were expected to be observed but were not. fingerprint profiles are coded according to exact enteropathogenic species present. there was a cluster of feline panleukopenia virus with Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. perfringens (N = 53, Figure 4[B]) but levels were as expected for F:Pa, F:PaClCr and F:PaCl (P > 0.044, Figure 5). there was also another very broad cluster of feline coronavirus with feline panleukopenia virus. faecal sample submissions from the cats with a history of diarrhoea included breed (100%), age (1,020 = 93.8%), gender (1,053 = 96.8%) and neuter status (952 = 87.5%). faecal samples were divided into 3 groups according to the age of the cat sampled. the overall prevalences of enteropathogenic species were 56.9% feline coronavirus, 22.1% feline panleukopenia virus, 56.6% C. perfringens, 0.8% S. enterica, 20.6% Giardia spp., 18.8% T. foetus, 24.4% Cryptosporidium spp. and 1.0% T. gondii. ia virus, Giardia spp., T. foetus and Cryptosporidium spp. (P 0.001, P > 0.091 for the other 3 species, Figure 1c) young cats (6 months) had significantly higher prevalences of infection than older cats for feline panleukopenia virus. youngest cats also had significantly higher prevalence of infection than the oldest cats for 3 other species. 12.7% of the samples submitted were negative for all 8 species. 86.2% of the cats with none of the 8 species detected were DSH. differences in mean species carriage in pedigree cats were significantly higher. feline coronavirus co-occurred with Giardia spp., and T. foetus, more frequently than expected, but not with feline panleukopenia virus. there were significantly greater co-occurrence in 13/56 (23%) of 3-way co-occurrences, 9/70 (13%) of 4-way co-occurrences and 1/56 (2%) of 5-way co-occurrences. the co-occurrence results are ordered left to right according to the number of species, in the order Co, Pa, Cl, Sa, Gi, Tr, Cr and To. the dark bars indicate statistically significant difference in observed minus expected with #P 0.001. polygons referred to in text are sample/clusters referred to in text. ii> F:CoPaCr (7), F:CoPaCr (5), F:CoPaGiTr (3); ii> F:CoPaClGiCr (10), F:CoPaClGiTr (12); ii> F:CoPaClGiTr (7), F:CoPaClGi there were 72 profiles observed + 9 profiles (bold italics) that were expected to be observed but were not. the next most common fingerprint was F:CoClTr (49, Figure 4), which was observed significantly more than expected. levels were as expected for F:Pa, F:PaClCr and F:CoPa. there was also another very broad cluster of feline coronavirus with feline panleukopenia virus and other enteropathogenic species. there was another apparent cluster of Cryptosporidium spp. with feline coronavirus. these were only expected to be observed in 2 or fewer samples. this left 175 potential profiles not observed. if these 2 species were excluded, then there were 64 possible fingerprints with the 6 other species. of these 56 (88%) fingerprint profiles were observed. the prevalence of individual enteropathogens (Figure 1a) correlated well with previous reports. the prevalence of individual enteropathogens was 56.9% of diarrhoeic faecal samples. this is comparable to a detection rate of 19.2% in 52 faecal samples from cats with diarrhoea. salmonella enterica and salmonella enterica were detected infrequently. co-infection with 2 enteropathogenic species was observed in 62.5% faecal samples. overall mean species carriage was 2.01 (Figure 2a) the duration and severity of diarrhoea was significantly greater in cats with chronic pre-existing and asymptomatic C. parvum infection than in specific pathogen free cats. co-infected cats were more likely to suffer episodes of acute self-limiting diarrhoea in the chronic phase (> 7 weeks) of T. foetus infection. 69% of diarrhoeic cats with none of the 8 species detected were >12 months old DSH cats. this is consistent with our finding of smaller numbers of enteropathogen species in older DSH cats. pathogenic mechanisms proposed for T. foetus include alterations in the normal flora, adherence to the epithelium, and elaboration of cytokines and enzymes. there was no control over the data provided at the time of sample submission, and no follow up in terms of treatment and outcome. a large scale study examining co-infection patterns of 8 enteropathogenic species in diarrhoeic cats. the results show that co-infection by these species is common in cats. the proportion of cats with none of the tested enteropathogenic species detected is greater than expected based on chance alone. competing interests JB works for IDEXX Laboratories which offers the 8-way feline PCR assay as a commercial test. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
