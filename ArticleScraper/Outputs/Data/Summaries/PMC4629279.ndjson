{"summary": "all the databases from EVD outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been cleaned and compiled into one anonymised individual-level dataset. since the virus' discovery in 1976, there have been six major outbreaks and one minor outbreak (Tandala 1977) reported in the DRC, four in the northern Equateur and Orientale provinces. map of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where the area of the circles are proportional to the number of cases (probable and confirmed) per outbreak. a detailed account of the outbreaks can be found in Appendix 1, Section B. in Boende most cases living in small villages Start Aug-76 Jun-76 Jan-95 Apr-07 Nov-08 Jun-12 End Oct-76 Jun-76 Jun-95 Oct-07 Jan-09 Nov-12 Oct-12 Healthcare facility involved in history Yambuku Catholic Mission Hospital \u2013 Kikwit II Maternity Unit and Kikwit General Hospital. case-fatality ratio and % female were calculated with only probable and confirmed cases. only cases for which outcomes were reported were included in the case-fatality ratio denominator. the date of infection was based on symptom onset when available (701/995). when it was not, hospitalisation dates were used (5/995). in other outbreaks, infection dates refer to onset of symptoms almost exclusively (>90%) the most commonly reported symptom was fever, which was reported by 95% of cases (95% CI = 92.6\u201397.3%) and at least 90% of cases in every outbreak. reports of vomiting were also similarly common across all major outbreaks. the highest average CFR was seen during the first outbreak in Yambuku. Kikwit, Mweka 2007, and Boende had high average CFRs. the highest average CFR was seen during the first outbreak in Yambuku. CFRs generally decreased during childhood and then increased again to plateau at around 70\u201380% in adulthood (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2). this pattern was less readily observed for the CFRs in the Yambuku outbreak. the baseline CFR in individuals over 15 years of age during the first month of an EVD outbreak who were admitted to hospital after 0.3 days. the CFR for individuals over 15 years of age during the first month of the outbreak during the Boende outbreak was estimated at 79% (95% CI = 25.8\u201399.5) 0\u20135 year olds had significantly higher CFRs (96%, 94% and 93%) than those over 15 years of age. the odds of dying declined on average by 35% (95% CI = 22.6\u201345.9) each month after the start of each outbreak. the spread of EVD during the first 2 weeks had been high (R > 3) in Kikwit 1995, Mweka 2007 and Isiro 2012, spread of EVD was sustained for more than 13 weeks. the largest delays between symptom onset to notification and hospitalisation were seen during the Kikwit outbreak (12.9 days and 5.0 days, respectively) longest delay between hospitalisation and death was observed during the Isiro outbreak (11.4 and 8.0 days, respectively) however, this was only recorded for the Kikwit, Mweka 2008, and Isiro outbreaks. the occupation was only recorded during three outbreaks: Kikwit, Boende and Isiro. the occupation was recorded for 85% (58/68) of cases. 14% (8) were known HCWs and 3% (2) were possible HCWs. the date of infection was based on symptom onset when available (701/995). when it was not, hospitalisation dates were used (5/995). in other outbreaks, infection dates refer to onset of symptoms almost exclusively (>90%) most commonly reported symptom was fever, which was reported by 95% of cases (95% CI = 92.6\u201397.3%) and at least 90% of cases in every outbreak. reports of vomiting were also similarly common across all major outbreaks. there was considerable variation in how frequently the remaining symptoms were reported for different outbreaks. Kikwit, Mweka 2007, and Boende had high average CFRs ranging from 74% to 78%. During the Isiro and Mweka 2008 outbreaks, the CFR was lower, at 54 and 44% (95% CI = 39.5\u201367.8 and 26.4\u201362.3) the baseline CFR in individuals over 15 years of age during the first month of an EVD outbreak was 74% (95% CI = 17.8\u201399.3) the CFR was similar during the Isiro outbreak but was significantly higher during the Kikwit outbreak (94%). the odds of dying declined on average by 31% (95% CI = 3.1\u201352.0%) each month after the start of an outbreak and increased by 11% (95% CI = 1.8\u201320.7%) per day that a symptom 0\u20135 year olds had significantly higher CFRs (96%, 94% and 93%) than those over 15 years of age. the odds of dying declined on average by 35% (95% CI = 22.6\u201345.9) each month after the start of each outbreak. in Kikwit 1995, Mweka 2007 and Isiro 2012, spread of EVD was sustained for more than 13 weeks. the largest delays between symptom onset to notification and to hospitalisation were seen during the Isiro outbreak (11.4 and 8.0 days, respectively). longest delay between hospitalisation and death was observed during the Mweka 2008 outbreak (11.0 days) the bars represent the observed frequency distributions of the delay from onset of symptoms to notification, onset of symptoms to hospitalisation, onset of symptoms to death, length of hospitalisation, and date of hospitalisation to death. this article provides for the first time a description and a line list for all outbreaks that have occurred in the DRC. this represents almost 40 years of surveillance data, seven outbreaks, and 996 suspected, probable, or confirmed cases. the odds of dying increase by 11% per day that a patient is not hospitalised. the basic reproduction numbers reported for the Kikwit outbreak (3.00) is comprised in the range found by other studies (1.36\u20133.65). our estimate for the Yambuku outbreak (5.00) is similar to that reported by Camacho et al. (4.71, range = 3.92\u20135.66) (Camacho et al., 2014) the remaining outbreak estimates have not been studied by other authors. the data presented were originally collected for the containment of the outbreaks rather than for providing the basis of an epidemiological study of the disease. however, variables are not recorded consistently across all outbreaks. epidemiological link between index cases and animal reservoirs has not been found for any of these outbreaks. all outbreaks except for the 2007 Mweka outbreak have involved hospital transmission during the early part of the outbreak. traditional burials are an important mechanism of transmission of EVD. the boende outbreak began whilst the west africa outbreak was gaining international importance. the more remote setting, a background antibody presence in the area and greater preparedness to EVD could have contributed to the avoidance of a larger outbreak. the high number of EVD cases between 25 and 64 years of age compared to the background demographics, the high CFR in children under five, the decrease in CFRs in those 5 to 15 and the subsequent increase in CFR during adulthood are phenomena that warrant further investigation. we included 262 of the 318 cases reported in Yambuku (1977) the aggregated line lists can be found in Supplementary file 1. suspected cases are all individuals (alive or dead) who had a fever. the age groups used were 0\u20135 years, 5\u201315 years, and >15 years. delay from symptom onset to hospitalisation was present for 63% of probable or confirmed cases. these dates were not recorded for Yambuku and Mweka 2007. the DLM is the public body in charge of containing EVD outbreaks in the DRC. these data were designed for outbreak containment rather than for epidemiological analysis. the fields selected were age, sex, date of symptom onset, date of hospitalisation, outcome, case definition, date of notification, date of death, occupation, fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, hiccups. all estimates presented (CFRs, symptom delays, and reproduction numbers) were computed omitting suspected cases. patients for whom the presence or absence of at least one symptom was reported did not display additional symptoms unless those were also reported. we assumed a serial interval of 15.3 days with a standard deviation of 9.3 days. delays in care were only calculated for those outbreaks for which the necessary dates were recorded. authors had no role in the design, collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. ia, generalized generalised joint pains, dysphagia, hiccups. clinical cases All those presenting hemorrhagic symptoms.
