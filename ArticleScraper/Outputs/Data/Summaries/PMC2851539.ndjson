{"summary": "IHR (2005) expands the scope of internationally reportable diseases and events, provides criteria for identifying novel epidemic events, and specifies conditions for involvement of the international community in outbreak responses. the revised regulations replace the previous disease-specific framework with one built on timely notification of all events that might constitute a public health emergency. IHR (2005) includes a list of diseases for which a single case must be reported to WHO immediately, regardless of the context in which the disease occurs. an event involving certain other diseases (e.g., cholera, pneumonic plague, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers) calls for a careful evaluation using the decision instrument. a third innovation under IHR (2005) is the requirement for member states to designate \u201cnational IHR focal points\u201d as the operational link for notification and reporting to WHO and for WHO to name corresponding \u201cIHR contact points\u201d effective communication between these 2 organizational entities will be central to the rapid management of a possible public health emergency of international concern. in many countries, national action plans can build on the influenza pandemic preparedness plans developed with WHO\u2019s guidance. specific WHO guidelines and initiatives, particularly in the areas of external quality assessment for laboratories, data gathering and analysis at the health district level, are being developed. IHR (2005) includes a list of diseases for which a single case must be reported to WHO immediately, regardless of the context in which the disease occurs. an event involving certain other diseases (e.g., cholera, pneumonic plague, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers) requires a careful evaluation. the need for recognition of specific diseases requires adequate diagnostic laboratory capacity. only the director general of WHO can determine whether an event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. the emergency committee is specifically set up to review a reported event and provide advice to the Director General. IHR (2005) introduces special provisions for travelers, including the obligation to treat them with respect for their dignity, human rights, and fundamental freedom. despite the broad new goals included in IHR (2005), improvements in global public health security will depend on what member states are actually able to do. a new organization, the international association of national public health institutes (IANPHI) was created to address these gaps through the enhancement and proliferation of NPHIs across the world. IANPHI aims to be a catalyst for sustained improvements in public health capacity and infrastructure globally. IANPHI is a professional association for NPHI directors. it fosters leadership development and advocacy for public health. IANPHI achieves its service mission through a 3-part approach of advocacy, technical assistance, and linkages. as of June 2007, IANPHI had awarded technical assistance grants to public health institutes in 5 nations. the new awards include 3 short-term grants to NPHIs in Thailand, Uganda, and Iran to support training and infrastructure development. a medium-term grant to the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research will support sustainable improvements in disease surveillance and outbreak investigation. IANPHI links NPHIs through annual meetings, regional events, leadership development activities, research seed grants. IANPHI aims to help national governments develop organizational infrastructures to devise and implement comprehensive public health priorities, meet global public health goals, develop workforce capacity, effectively absorb donor funds, address emerging threats, and improve the health of their populations. the success of IHR (2005) depends on strong national public health systems with well-trained staff and well-equipped facilities. the result will be better control of endemic diseases such as HIV/AIDS, acute lower respiratory tract infections, diarrheal diseases, measles, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases."}
