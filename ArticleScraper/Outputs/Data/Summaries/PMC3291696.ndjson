{"summary": "we compared the rates of new respiratory and gastrointestinal infections among elderly residents aged 65 years and older of 22 long-term care facilities. for each resident who visited the emergency department during the study period, we randomly selected two residents who did not visit the emergency department. these facilities were located in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, and Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, Quebec. we enrolled residents aged 65 years and older who lived in the participating facilities between September 2006 and may 2008. upper respiratory tract infection New onset of at least two of the following: runny nose or sneezing nasal congestion sore throat hoarseness or difficulty swallowing dry cough cervical adenopathy Lower respiratory tract infection New onset of at least three of the following: new or increased cough of acute onset new or increased sputum production fever (temperature > 38\u00b0C) pleuritic chest pain new or increased findings on chest examination AND one of the following: new or increased shortness of breath we chose a sample size of 405 residents who visited and 810 residents who did not visit the emergency department to provide 80% power to detect an absolute difference in the risk of infection of 3%. we calculated the incidence of new infections as a proportion, and we calculated the crude relative risk (RR) associated with a visit to the emergency department. we enrolled residents aged 65 years and older who lived in the participating facilities between September 2006 and may 2008. we concentrated on nonsummer months (September\u2013May) to maximize the likelihood of exposure to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in the emergency department. if a resident visited an emergency department more than once during a 10-day period, we included only the last visit. new or increased cough of acute onset new or increased sputum production fever (temperature > 38\u00b0C) pleuritic chest pain new or increased findings on chest examination AND one of the following: new or increased shortness of breath respiratory rate > 25/min worsening mental or functional status Acute gastroenteritis Noninfectious causes ruled out. staff performed blinded assessment of the outcomes by reviewing photocopies of charts, including notes, written orders and the results of ordered tests. we chose a sample size of 405 residents who visited and 810 residents who did not visit the emergency department to provide 80% power (two-sided = 0.05) we calculated the incidence of new infections as a proportion, and we calculated the crude relative risk (RR) associated with a visit to the emergency department. those who visited the emergency department had higher average scores on the Charlson Comorbidity Index than those who did not visit the emergency department. the residents\u2019 underlying medical conditions are summarized in Table 1. residents who had a record of prior pneumococcal vaccination for the current season were more likely than those who visited the emergency department to be more independent. the facilities declared 12 outbreaks of respiratory illness (influenza = 2, respiratory syncytial virus = 2, other respiratory viruses = 8). the reasons for residents\u2019 visits to the emergency department are summarized in Table 2. impaired mobility (including falls and fractures), neurologic and noninfectious gastrointestinal problems, and skin, soft tissue and cardiovascular complaints accounted for over 70% of visits. overall, 10% of residents with a cardiovascular complaint and 11% of those with a urinary tract infection developed an infection. visit to the emergency department was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of infection. a visit to the emergency department was associated with increased risk of infection only in the absence of an outbreak in the facility at that time. residents who visited the emergency department had higher scores on the Charlson Comorbidity Index. compared to those who did not visit the emergency department, they were more likely to dine in their own room and have visitors. increased number of visitors, however, might be expected to increase the risk of acquiring an infection. the absence of increased risk may be because of different practices in pediatric emergency departments, shorter lengths of stay, or greater exposure of children in community settings. residents of long-term care facilities often have multiple chronic diseases and functional impairments that predispose them to infection. this study has the limitations of a retrospective chart review. it is possible that some infectious outcomes were missed. however, the use of standardized and validated definitions for the diagnosis of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections should have balanced this risk in the two groups. residents were monitored more closely or if symptoms were documented with more precision. this study has the limitations of a retrospective chart review. it is possible that some infectious outcomes were missed. however, the use of standardized and validated definitions for the diagnosis of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections should have balanced this risk in the two groups."}
