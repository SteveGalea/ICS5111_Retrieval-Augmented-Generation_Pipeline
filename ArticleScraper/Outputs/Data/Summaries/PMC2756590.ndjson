{"summary": "genomes of well-recognized human pathogens, incidental pathogens, and their closely related nonpathogenic species are valuable for efforts to predict the propensity for host shifts and their consequences for human health. one illustrative example can be found in the genus Mycobacterium, which contains several severe human pathogens. there was a massive reduction in size of the two major surface protein gene families. this gene loss is thought to have been crucial for the organism to evade the human immune system by limiting the number of antigens on the bacterial surface. the uptake of a new virulence plasmid producing an immunosuppressive substance called mycolactone is also thought to have played a key role in evolution and host switch of M. ulcerans. a successful infectious bacterium must possess mechanisms for interacting with the host and evading the host immune system. key players in these processes are often proteins on the surface of the bacterium, including secretion systems that release effector proteins into the surrounding medium or directly into the host cells. the key players in these processes are often proteins on the surface of the bacterium. the disease, known as buruli ulcer, is becoming a serious public health problem in west and central africa as well as in other parts of the tropics. M. ulcerans appears to have switched from a generalist to a specialist lifestyle: starting with a progenitor very similar to the aquatic. complete genome assembly remains Difficult despite ease with which sequence data can be generated. resequencing readily detects SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in single-copy genes, but performs poorly in repeated and highly divergent regions of the genome. functional annotation of pathogen genomes is particularly important because genes involved in host-interaction processes are among the most difficult to annotate. a broader taxonomic breadth of bacteria, with one reference species per genus, would be desirable. tool was developed recently for genomes with a conserved order of genes. it has been applied to analyze sequence deterioration in typhus pathogen Rickettsia prowazekii and its closest relatives. software can also handle multiple genome comparisons from highly rearranged genomes. genes contributing to virulence are prone to horizontal gene transfer, gene duplications, and gene loss. homologs of virulence genes are often present also in nonpathogenic species, making it difficult to recognize pathogens solely from the gene content. one solution to this problem is to characterize the selective pressures on candidate vaccine targets. the aligned acfD genes from three V. cholerae strains (M2140, M1567, and M1118) are plotted separately. a line connects each site where the nucleotides in two strains differ from the third strain. noninformative sites were removed before plotting. microbial community sequencing poses new challenges and will require extensive bioinformatics development. a new field of comparative algorithms needs to be developed to provide meaningful comparisons between taxonomic profiles. to achieve these goals, investments in user-friendly software and improved visualization tools, along with excellent computational biology, will be of utmost importance. the slow transition from a scientific in-house program to the distribution of a stable and efficient software package is a major bottleneck in scientific knowledge sharing, preventing efficient progress in all areas of computational biology. edward et al."}
