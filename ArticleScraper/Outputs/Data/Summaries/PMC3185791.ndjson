{"summary": "the interferon family of cytokines is recognized as a key innate immune component. three classes of IFN have been identified that mediate through their cognate receptors the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. innate immune system is a complex network of interconnected pathways. host-virus interface is comprised of three fundamental components: recognition and induction of signaling by innate immune receptors, cellular antiviral responses and viral evasion of innate restriction mechanisms. a group of proteins with potent anti-viral properties known collectively as \u201crestriction factors\u201d are constitutively expressed or induced by type-1 interferon. they are able to limit viral replication by targeting specific steps in the life cycle. the first restriction factor for HIV-1 was discovered in 2002. the cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G is encapsidated in vif HIV-1 particles. it can deaminate cytidines in the single stranded DNA. APOBEC3G mutates viral genomes in target cells. rhesus TRIM5 is a multifunctional component of the innate immune system. it can also promote innate immune signaling that is triggered by interaction with the retroviral capsid lattice. TRIM5 would be the first described innate sensor recognizing HIV-1 capsid. the detection of potential candidate genes is influenced by many factors like timing and filtering thresholds. most genome-wide RNAi screens so far focused on identifying viral dependency factors that facilitate replication rather than identifying innate immune genes involved in restricting viral replication. silencing of all 22 genes enhanced both WNV and Dengue virus 2. RNAi studies identified antiviral defense genes in Drosophila. the exact mechanism of restriction is currently unknown. some cellular proteins identified as dependency factors might protect the virus against unknown cellular antiviral proteins. none of the above studies systematically investigated how non-structural proteins influenced the results of the siRNA screens. a number of screens mentioned above used non-replicating viruses. a study explored the global transcriptional profiles of different immune cell populations in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) on stimulation with type I and II interferons and factors involved in cell-mediated immunity. the study allowed the identification of both cytokine-specific and cell-specific transcriptional patterns. human immune system [88] Macrophages.com http://www.macrophages.com/ Broad repository for data and information about macrophages - Host-Pathogen interactions Pathogen interaction gateway http://molvis.vbi.vt.edu/pig/ User interface for searching available data and tools to predict interactions between host and pathogen [71] Virusmint http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/virusmint/Welcome.d jp/kegg Knowledge base containing biological pathway and molecular interaction related resources [99] PID http://pid.nci.nih.gov/ Molecular interactions and biological processes in biomolecular pathways [101] Other useful sites BioGPS http://biogps.gnf.org Free customizable gene annotation portal [102] Symatlas http://symatlas.gnf.org Gene expression atlas http://www.ebi.ac.uk cobasa et al. [59] investigated the regulation of the host response to 1918 influenza virus in the bronchi of infected macaques by comparison with a conventional influenza virus. a deregulation in 1918 infected macaques was also reported by Cilloniz et al. [60] who describe differential changes in inflammatory and cell death related genes. some of these genes were only active in cells that responded to interferon. other genes seem to act as direct inhibitor of HCV. regulation of the innate antiviral response can also be regulated through non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) the innateDB project collates and curates more than 13,000 innate-immune-relevant interactions and enhances pathway-specific networks. this database can identify network \u201chubs\u201d (i.e., highly connected nodes) and \u201cbottlenecks\u201d (i.e., key connector proteins central to many paths in the network) proteomic analyses on the global changes in the proteome after HIV-1 infection have recently been published. a third group revealed a metabolic rerouting of HIV infected T cells by using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis proteomic analysis. a biological system operates through the concerted action of different classes of molecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites) for each class, \u201comics\u201d technologies reveal a global view. each network represents a specific type of interaction involving different components, such as genes, transcripts, regulatory RNAs, proteins, modified proteins and metabolites. a comprehensive map of physical and regulatory interactions between influenza and its host was constructed. this led to 1745 selected candidate genes that may play a role in host responses. this led to the assignment of specialized roles in the host-pathogen network. major challenges in systems-biology research on Host-Viral Interactions Systems-biology datasets are inherent to (prone to) approach-specific limitations. factors like experimental assay design, choice of reagents and the existence of false positive and negative activities contribute to the variance between datasets and the complexity of the final results. the ultimate goal of the systems-based approaches is to enable the development of therapeutic strategies for antivirals that interfere with viral evasion of host immune defenses. a more global understanding of the innate immune response may lay the groundwork for improving vaccination strategies."}
