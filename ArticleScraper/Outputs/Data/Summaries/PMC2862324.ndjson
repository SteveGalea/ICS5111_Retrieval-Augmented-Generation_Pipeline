{"summary": "the filamentous bacteriophage fd is well understood at both the structural and genetic levels. the capsid contains one major protein pVIII largely alpha helical. it forms a shingled tubular array surrounding the single-stranded viral DNA with its N-terminal regions exposed on the viral surface. single-display bacteriophages fdOVA257\u2013264 were able to induce a sustained and antigen-specific CTL response in vivo and in vivo. single hybrid phages displaying a strong CTL epitope (OVA257\u2013264) were able to induce an efficient CTL response even in the absence of a T helper exogenous epitope. single hybrid phage preparations (fdOVA257\u2013264) displayed 450\u2013750 copies of major coat protein pVIII [6]. a total of 35 mice were sensitized by one injection of 50 g of the cytotoxic peptide. DTH reactions were elicited in mice after injection of 75 g fdOVA257\u2013264. between 10 and 48 hours the area of swelling was measured using a caliper. treatment with the depleting anti-CD4 mAb GK1.5 was performed every 3 days. the immunizations were performed on days 0 and 15 using 50 g fdOVA257\u2013264 administered either subcutaneously without adjuvant, or intraperitoneally in the presence of poly I:C. anti-allo responder cells were tested against either P815 (H-2d) or EL4 target cells. cells were incubated in anti-IFN- mAb precoated multiscreen plates with IL-2 at 20 U/mL and 5 105 irradiated syngenic spleen cells. toxic peptide (5\u2032-CCGCGGAGGGTTCCATCATCATCATCATCATCAACTTCGAAAAACTGGACGATCCCAAGG-3\u2032) into SacII-StyI-digested fdAMPLAY88 phage genome. the wild type (fdwt) or recombinant virions produced hybrid phages in the supernatant. a total of 35 mice were sensitized by one injection of 50 g of the mice were screened for seropositivity to Sendai virus, Rodent Coronavirus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. all experiments with mice were performed in accordance with European Union Laws and guidelines. FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb was used for in vivo CD4+ T cell depletion assessment. the efficiency of CD4+ T cell depletion was controlled by FACS analysis (FACSAria, Becton Dickinson) on spleen cells isolated from representative mice sacrificed at various time points. spleen cells from each mouse were stimulated in parallel cultures with irradiated spleen cells bearing the H-2d alloantigen (antiallo response) cells were harvested and tested for cytotoxic activity against 3H-TdR labelled targets in a 4-hour assay. fdOVA257\u2013264 administration is able to trigger DTH. mice were sensitized by one injection of 50 g of cytotoxic peptide. fdOVA257\u2013264 administration is able to trigger DTH. peptide from hepatitis B virus core antigen emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. 10 days after sensitization, DTH was performed by injecting into the right footpad fdOVA257\u2013264, fdwt, the synthetic OVA257\u2013264 peptide (pepOVA), or soluble ovalbumin. 10\u201348 hours later the area of swelling was measured using a caliper. the use of synthetic OVA257\u2013264 peptide in the presence of fdwt did not elicit DTH. this indicates that DTH was conferred by the antigenic determinant displayed on the phage surface. this indicates that induction of DTH by fdOVA257\u2013264 virions could not be ascribed to the presence of LPS contaminants in the phage preparations. the ELISPOT assay measures the frequency of IFN-producing splenocytes in response to in vitro stimulation with fdOVA257\u2013264 synthetic peptide. the filamentous bacteriophages administered without adjuvant are able to induce both relevant antigen-specific CTLs (mean 29.6% of lysis) and INF production (mean 124 Spot Forming Cells (SFC)/million cells) each symbol represents data obtained from a single mouse. the mean value SD for each group is reported. CD4+ T cell depletion was analyzed by cytofluorometry using noncompeting anti-CD4 antibody. fdOVA257\u2013264 administration is able to trigger DTH. mice were sensitized by one injection of 50 g of cytotoxic peptide and 140 g of T helper HBVc128\u2013140 (TPPAYRPPNAPIL) peptide. a significant swelling between 24 and 48 hours was induced in the footpad of mice challenged with fd OVA257\u2013264 virions. in contrast, a DTH reaction was not observed in mice challenged with wild type phage, synthetic OVA257\u2013264 peptide or soluble ovalbumin. the use of synthetic OVA257\u2013264 peptide in the presence of fdwt did not elicit DTH. this indicates that DTH was conferred by the antigenic determinant displayed on the phage surface. this indicates that induction of DTH by fdOVA257\u2013264 virions could not be ascribed to the presence of LPS contaminants in phage preparations. the filamentous bacteriophages administered without adjuvant are able to induce both relevant antigen-specific CTLs (mean 29.6% of lysis) and INF production (mean 124 Spot Forming Cells (SFC)/million cells) when we depleted the CD4+ T lymphocytes, the lytic activity and the IFN- production of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were lower (17% of lytic activity and 94 SFC INF/million cells) CD4+ T cell depletion was analyzed by cytofluorometry using noncompeting anti-CD4 antibody. the analysis was performed on spleen cells isolated from mice sacrificed at the time points indicated. a group of mice was also immunized with 50 g of fdOVA257\u2013264 without adjuvant and treated with anti-CD4 mAb. fd bacteriophage fd is a nonpathogenic virus that is not able to infect and replicate in eukaryotic cells. in the past few years we have shown that fd particles represent a good antigen delivery system both for T helper and CTL epitopes. this may allow the in vivo monitoring of immune responses mediated by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. the display of the epitope OVA257\u2013264 on the surface of fd virions is sufficient to sustain an MHC class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte response in vivo. the importance of specific CD4+ T cell help for CD8+ T cell mediated immunity is known. however interactions between cross presenting DC, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells are still not well defined. the addition of exogenous IL-2 to mice depleted of CD4+ T cells restores the secondary expansion of CTL [17]. we plan to investigate in future work the ability of phages to function as PRR agonist, to induce cytokine production, maturation of DCs, and to upregulate their costimolatory molecules. findings should be taken into consideration in designing fd particles for vaccine strategies."}
