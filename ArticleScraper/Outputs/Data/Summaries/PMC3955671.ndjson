{"summary": "PRRS virus (PRRSV) belongs to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales [2] and possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 15.4 kb in size. two distinct genotypes have been reported for PRRSV: European (type I) and North American (type II) genotypes. PRRSV has been shown to modulate type I IFN response [17] and nsp11 has been suggested to participate in the modulation of IFN response [18]. cellular transcriptional profiles during PRRSV infection have been studied to some extent [19, 20]. the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (MAb M2, Sigma) and the anti-BrdU antibody were purchased from Sigma. a donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Texas Red and a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with FITC were purchased from Invitrogen. 500 mL of 2xYT (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl per L) was inoculated with the 5 mL overnight culture. cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 7700 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. nsp11 was purified from the supernatants and concentrated to 1 mg/mL. a total of 2 mg of nsp11 was used to immunize a rabbit 5 times at 2-week intervals. an anti-PRRSV-nsp11 rabbit serum was generated. cellular DNA was extracted from MARC-nsp11 cells using QIAamp DNA kit (Qiagen) for reverse transcription (RT), total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega) followed by RT using the nsp11-specific reverse primer and PCR using the primer set. membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 1 h at room temperature. membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. dual Luciferase Reporter Assays double-strand RNA stimulation was conducted using poly (I:C) for nsp11-gene transfection, MARC-145 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and per well. 0.05 g of pRL-TK, 0.5 g of pIFN--luc, pIRF3-luc or pPRDII-luc were cotransfected. the microarray was repeated twice in triplicate each. the oligo package contained probes to interrogate 253,002 exons representing 28,536 annotated genes. the criteria for significance varied for the exon- and gene-levels. cells were seeded and grown for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS. for flow cytometry, cells were collected by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and resuspended in cold PBS to 1 106 cells per mL. the cell suspension was added dropwise to an equal volume of cold ethanol with continuous agitation. cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 7 min on ice. cells were then incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit antibody for 30 min. cells were then incubated with 4N HCl for 25 min at room temperature. cells MARC-145 and MARC-nsp11 cells were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the nsp11 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from the FL12 strain of PRRSV. the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (MAb M2, Sigma) and the anti-BrdU antibody were purchased from Sigma. polyinosinic:polycytidylic (poly [I:C]) as a double-stranded RNA analog was purchased from Sigma. a donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Texas Red and a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with FITC were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) STE (5 mL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mL of 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mL of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0 in 500 mL) resuspended again in 12.5 mL of 1X PBS, and DNase I (20 g/mL) and lysosome (200 g/mL) were added and treated for 1 h. the specificity of the antiserum was determined by immune-blot and immunofluorescence using PRRSV-infected cells. 0.5 g of the pLNCX2-FLAG-nsp11 plasmid was cotransfected with pVSV-G into the pantropic packaging cell line GP2-293. after 48 h of incubation, culture supernatants were collected and used to infect MARC-145 cells. PCR was performed using ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System and Software (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 25 L containing 2.5 L of cDNA synthesized from the RT reaction, 2.5 pmol of each primer, 12.5 L of SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 5 L of water. the primer sequences were designed using Primer 5.0 Software (Invitrogen) or obtained from previous reports. 100 L of total cell lysates was incubated with 1 L of the anti-nsp11 rabbit serum at 4\u00b0C for 4 h. supernatants were aspirated and washed with the lysis buffer twice. membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. pRL-TK and each of the three reporter plasmids were cotransfected with the same amount as that of the nsp11 gene transfection. twenty-four hours after transfection, 0.5 g of poly (I:C) was transfected into cells for 16 h. cells were lysed using the passive lysis buffer (Promega) the criteria for significance varied for the exon- and gene-levels. at the exon-level, the criteria were at least a 2-fold change and a raw P value 0.02, resulting in 8,693 significant exons. at the exon-level, the criteria were at least a 2-fold change. x-100 and 10 g/mL RNase A (Roche) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. samples were then analyzed using flow cytometry (BD AccuriC6), BD Accuri Cytometers. cells were incubated with 4N HCl for 25 min at room temperature. a goat anti-mouse antibody was applied to cells for 90 min. cells were then incubated with a goat anti-mouse antibody for 30 min. lentivirus containing the nsp11 gene from PRRSV strain FL12 and G418 (neomycin)-resistant cells were selected. cell clone \u201ca\u201d was chosen for further characterization and designated MARC-nsp11. nsp11 protein expression was also determined by immunoprecipitation using a rabbit anti-nsp11 antibody. cellular RNA was extracted from MARC-145, nsp11-gene transfected MARC-145, and MARC-nsp11 (lane 3) cells and subjected to DNase I treatment followed by RT-PCR or PCR. the regulatory function of nsp11 for IFN induction was first examined in MARC-nsp11 cells and in MARC-145 cells transfected with the nsp11 gene. sp11 in gene-transfected MARC-145 cells (a, b, and c) and stably-expressing MARC-nsp11 cells (d) cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with pXJ41 (0.5 g) or pXJ41-Flag-nsp11 plasmid of 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, or 0.1 g. after 24 h, cells were transfected with or MARC-nsp11 cells were cotransfected with pIFN--luc, pIRF3-luc, or pPRDII-luc and pRL-TK. all samples were treated and processed as described above. white bars represent MARC-145 cells, grey bars represent pLNCX2 retrovirus expression vector-transfected MARC-145 cells. the suppressive activities in MARC-nsp11 cells were less markedly compared to those of empty vector-transfected (gray bars) or mock-transfected (white bars) MARC-145 cells showed the decrease of luciferase activities compared to those in gene-transfected cells. 79 of the significantly regulated genes were placed into 17 categories. nsp11 regulated histone-related proteins, cell cycle and DNA replication pathways, MAPK signaling pathways, ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, and complementary pathways.

TNFSF10 and DEPTOR were chosen as the downregulated genes in the microarray assays. DUSPs regulate the cellular localization and activity of MAPK which functions in the negative feedback loop of ERK regulation [30]. DUSP1 dephosphorylates ERK in the nucleus and allows its trafficking to the cytoplasm [31], while DUSP6 causes the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 [31]. C-Jun/AP-1 and c-Fos genes were also upregulated in our study. cells were seeded in 60 mm-diameter dishes and cultivated for 24 h. cells were stained with 10 g/mL of propidium iodide (PI) and subjected to flow cytometry. cells were pulsed-labeled for 10 min, 20 min, or 24 h. 20 min would detect BrdU incorporation in a single cell cycle. a longer time incubation of 24 h would detect multiple cell cycles. the majority of normal cells would be positive for BrdU staining. cells were pulse-labeled with 10 M of BrdU for 10 min and 20 min, or 100 nM for 24 h. cells were then incubated with 4N HCl to denature the DNA. cells were then stained for DNA-incorporated BrdU using an anti-BrdU antibody. a total of 200 lamin-positive cells were counted. a total of seven drug-resistant clones were obtained and screened for nsp11 sequence by PCR. cell clone \u201ca\u201d was chosen for further characterization and designated MARC-nsp11. a 26 kD protein was specifically identified in MARC-nsp11 cells at a low level. cell lysates were prepared from MARC-145 (lane 1), nsp11-gene transfected MARC-145 (lane 2), and MARC-nsp11 (lane 3) cells. incubated with protein A sepharose beads and anti-rabbit nsp11-specific polyclonal Ab. immunoblot using anti-FLAG monoclonal Ab. PRRSV nsp11 has recently been suggested as a potential type I inter cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected with pXJ41 (0.5 g) or pXJ41-Flag-nsp11 plasmid. cells were transfected with 0.5 g/mL of poly (I:C) for 16 h. after 24 h, cells were transfected with 0.5 g/mL of poly (I:C) for 16 h. pIRF3-luc contains 4 copies of the IRF3-binding sequence. pPRDII-luc contains 2 copies of the NF-B binding sequence upstream of the luciferase gene. cells were transfected with the empty vector as a negative control. MARC-nsp11 cells showed the decrease of luciferase activities compared to those of empty vector-transfected (gray bars) or mock-transfected (white bars) MARC-145 cells showed the decrease of nsp11 activity. the suppressive activities in MARC-nsp11 were less markedly than those in gene-transfected cells. the functional groups were summarized into five major cellular pathways that were regulated by nsp11. nsp11 regulated histone-related proteins, cell cycle and DNA replication pathways, MAPK signaling pathways, ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, and complementary pathways.

RT-qPCR was conducted for these genes for differential gene expression. for quantitative PCR, two genes (NOL6 and EGR1) were chosen to represent upregulated genes by nsp11. TNFSF10 and DEPTOR were chosen as the downregulated genes in the microarray assays. bars illustrate the differential gene expression determined by RT-qPCR. DUSP1 dephosphorylates ERK in the nucleus and allows its trafficking to the cytoplasm [31], while DUSP6 causes the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 [31]. SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier 1) has multiple functions by attaching itself to substrates referred to as sumoylation. a total of 10 genes related to these pathways were found to be regulated. nsp11 cells at the S phase constituted 28.5% compared to 12.6% for nsp11 cells. cells were seeded in 60 mm-diameter dishes and cultivated for 24 h. cells were stained with 10 g/mL of propidium iodide (PI) a total of 200 lamin-positive cells (in red) were randomly chosen for each slide. a total of 200 lamin-positive cells (in red) were randomly chosen for each slide. a total of 200 positive cells (in green) were randomly chosen for each slide. cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 followed by staining with an anti-lamin antibody. cells were then incubated with 4N HCl to denature the DNA, and stained for DNA-incorporated BrdU using an anti-BrdU antibody. a total of 200 lamin-positive cells were counted, and of the 200 cells BrdU-positive cells were counte nsp11-regulated genes were regulated by highly pathogenic (HP)-PRRSV in PAMs. c-Jun and c-Fos are two effectors of the MAPK signaling pathway. they were specifically upregulated during PRRSV infection. the increase of helicase proteins may have caused a malfunction of the replication fork and thus the inhibition of DNA synthesis in MARC-nsp11 cells. for RNA viruses, influenza virus replication has been shown to be regulated by helicase and the MCM complex consisting of MCM2-7. cyclin T1 resides in the cytoplasm and contains an endoribonuclease activity. nsp11 may alter the function or expression of cytoplasmic cellular components such as mRNA modification, which may then result in the regulation of the cell cycle. nsp11 functions in the nucleus and nsp11 functions in the cytoplasm."}
