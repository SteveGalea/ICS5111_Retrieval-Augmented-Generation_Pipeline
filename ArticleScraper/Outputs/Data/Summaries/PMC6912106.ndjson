{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Rotavirus (RV) is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in young children and infants worldwide (1, 2). it is a nonenveloped RNA virus with a genome composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which replicates in cytoplasmic structures composed primarily of viral proteins (3\u20135). the first steps of viral morphogenesis and genome replication occur within cytoplasmic viral replication factories known as viroplasm NSP5 hyperphosphorylation involves the phosphorylation of serine 67 (Ser67) by casein kinase 1 (CK1) to initiate the phosphorylation cascade. the structure of NSP5 remains unknown, but readily forms oligomeric species in solution. previous studies on NSP5 have been carried out using mutants expressed in the absence of a complete set of viral proteins. recombinant rotaviruses (simian rotavirus A strain SA11) carrying different mutations in the NSP5 coding region of gs11 were obtained using a recently developed reverse-genetics protocol. two essential additional modifications were introduced to trans-complement the potential loss of NSP5 function in the rRV mutants. rRV-NSP5/KO. NSP5 expression and localization to viroplasms in virus-infected cells have been considered essential for virus replication. previous studies, using small interfering RNA targeting gs11 mRNA, have shown strong impairment of RV replication (12, 13) rRV-NSP5/KO strain does not replicate in MA-NSP5-EGFP cells. both genomic dsRNA synthesis (Fig. 2D) and infectious progeny virus production were completely abrogated in MA104 cells. together, these data confirm that NSP5 is essential for RV replication. rRV-NSP5/KO strain grown in MA-NSP5 or MA104 cells. data are expressed as means standard deviations (n = 3); **, P 0.01 (Student's t test). rRVs with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation. virus-infected cell extracts detected at 5 or 10 h postinfection (hpi). phosphorylation with -protein phosphatase (-Ppase) and alkaline calf intestinal Ppase (CIP) was previously used to discriminate phosphorylated from nonphosphorylated NSP5. the NSP5 band with the fastest PAGE mobility has been described as 26 kDa. Western blot analysis of -Ppase and alkaline Ppase treatment of lysates of MA104 cells infected with rRV-wt or rRV-NSP5/S67A. protein bands corresponding to NSP5 are shown. we then generated two additional rRVs harboring truncated versions of NSP5, one lacking the 18-aa-long C-terminal tail (rRV-NSP5/T) rRV-NSP5/T and rRV-NSP5/176-180 grown in MA-NSP5 and MA104 cells. we also investigated viroplasm formation in cells infected with these rRV mutants. during early infection (5 hpi), the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant produced structures resembling viroplasms that appeared smaller and more heterogeneous in shape. micrographs of rRV-wt- and rRV-NSP5/S67A-infected MA104 cells stained at 10 hpi with the indicated antibodies. structures produced by rRV-NSP5/S67A were morphologically similar to those observed during wt RV infection of MA104 cells silenced for CK1. rRV-wt-infected mutants yielded fiber-like structures containing only the VP6 protein. similar VP6 fibers are normally formed when VP6 is overexpressed in cells in the absence of other viral proteins. these results confirm the role of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation for controlling the assembly of regular-shaped viroplasms. confocal immunofluorescence micrographs of MA104, MA-NSP2-mCherry, and MA-NSP5 (lower panel) cells stained with anti-NSP5 and 5-EU (green) single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization of MA-NSP5-EGFP cells infected with rRV-wt, rRV-NSP5/S67A. at 10 hpi, abundant gs6 transcripts could be detected in all viroplasms identified in MA-NSP5-EGFP cells infected with rRV-wt. smFISH performed on cells infected with rRV-NSP5/T showed diffuse distribution of gs6 RNA that did not localize to any structures resembling viroplasms. lipid membranes could be identified in cells infected with rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant. the observed immature viroplasms appeared to be less electron dense. these data strongly support the role of NSP5 phosphorylation in maintaining viral RNA production and genome replication in viroplasms. CK1 investigated the phosphorylation mechanism of NSP5 during RV infection. we demonstrated that despite the presence of Ser67, deletion mutant NSP5/T was not phosphorylated and failed to form viroplasms. despite the presence of Ser67, deletion mutant NSP5/T was not phosphorylated. t analysis of extracts of MA104 cells coinfected with rRV-NSP5/S67A. blue arrowhead indicates NSP5/S67A; faster-migrating band corresponds to NSP5-T. NSP5 deletion mutant lacking amino acids 80 to 130 (NSP5/3) becomes hyperphosphorylated when expressed alone. it can function as an activator of NSP5/S67A phosphorylation. rRV-wt infection was confirmed by the Ppase treatment. in both cases, viroplasm formation and virus replication were not rescued. in both cases, viroplasm formation and virus replication were not rescued. similar results were obtained with rRV-NSP5/KO virus strain. western blot analysis (A) and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (B) of MA104, MA-T, and MA-3 cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/KO strain. cells were stained with indicated antibodies and DAPI. each rescued rRV was amplified in a stable transfectant cell line, MA104-NSP5 (MA-NSP5) supplying the wt NSP5 in trans. both steps i and ii were absolutely required for rescuing the NSP5/KO virus, confirming the essential role of NSP5 for RV replication. rRV knockout rRV (termed rRV-NSP5/KO) generated by reverse genetics. a stop codon at residue 18Y was introduced to rescue the NSP5/KO strain. analysis of MA104 virus-infected cell extracts confirmed the presence of NSP2 and VP2 but not of NSP5. rRV-NSP5/KO strain does not replicate in MA-NSP5-EGFP cells. microscopy of MA104, MA-NSP2-mCherry, and MA-NSP5-EGFP cells infected with rRV-wt or rRV-NSP5/KO. data are expressed as the means standard deviations (n = 3); **, P 0.01 (Student's t test). rRVs harboring NSP5 mutations previously known to impact NSP5 phosphorylation. the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant virus was stable after 10 passages in the wild-type MA104 cells. the mutant was not hyperphosphorylated in all cell lines tested, including MA104, U2OS, and Caco-2 cells. the wild-type rRV (rRV-wt) yielded multiple hyperphosphorylated NSP5 isoforms. dsRNA genome segments of rRV-wt and rRV-NSP5/S67A strains grown in MA-NSP5 and in MA104 wt cells. data are expressed as means standard deviations (n = 3); ***, P 0.001 (Student's t test) rRV-NSP5/T and rRV-NSP5/176-180 mutants did not show a classical hyperphosphorylation pattern. despite the presence of Ser67, and lack of Thr and Ser residues within the deletions, both mutants did not show a classical hyperphosphorylation pattern. viroplasm morphology in MA104 cells infected with rRV-wt and rRV-NSP5/S67A (MOI, 15 FFU/cell) at 5 hpi (upper panels) and 10 hpi (lower panels) cells stained with anti-NSP5 and DAPI. viroplasmic proteins, NSP2, VP6, and VP2 were also present in the aberrant structures. viroplasms containing NSP5, NSP2, or VP2 were also present in the aberrant structures, suggesting that they could also represent sites of virus replication. most viral transcripts localized in viroplasms of rRV-wt-infected cells. no viral RNA transcripts were detected in either wt MA104 or MA-NSP2-mCherry cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant. RNA accumulation in viroplasms was restored by infection with MA-NSP5 cells that supply wild-type NSP5 in trans. rRV-NSP5/S67A-infected cells were infected with rRV-wt or rRV-NSP5/S67A. at 10 hpi, abundant gs6 transcripts could be detected in viroplasms. smFISH performed on cells infected with rRV-NSP5/T showed diffuse distribution of gs6 RNA that did not localize to any structures resembl multiple membraneless electron-dense inclusions encircled by the well-defined endoplasmic reticulum (ER) filled with triple-layered particles (TLPs) were present in the cells. at late infection points (10 hpi), ER filled with TLPs appeared to adopt a more tubular morphology, suggesting a successive step in the virus egress. white arrows indicate endoplasmic reticulum surrounding viroplasms. black arrowheads indicate viral particles with an envelope. we have previously proposed a model of the hierarchical hyperphosphorylation associated with the assembly of viroplasms. variants were phosphorylated (Fig. 8A) (8, 19, 24, 26) this result was supported further by infecting the MA104 transfectant cell line stably expressing NSP5-T (MA-T) with the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain. the mutant was also unable to induce phosphorylation of NSP5/S67A following coinfection with the two rRVs. confocal immunofluorescence micrographs of MA104, MA-T, and MA-3 cells infected with rRV-NSP5/S67A. cells were stained with the indicated antibodies. viroplasms similar to those observed in wt MA104 cells were produced. regular round structures resembling viroplasms were recovered in these cells infected with rRV-NSP5/S67A. however, viral replication was nevertheless impaired. rRV-NSP5/T (A and C) or with rRV-NSP5/176-180 (B and D) open arrowheads indicate NSP5/T and NSP5/176-180. cells were stained with the indicated antibodies and DAPI. viroplasms have long been recognized as essential compartments supporting RV replication. a modified reverse-genetics system for rotaviruses (29) provides the first direct evidence of the essential role of NSP5 in viroplasm formation. the rRVs generated using this method failed to incorporate dsRNA originating from the NSP5-encoding mRNA lacking the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) the viroplasm formation and viral replication were efficiently rescued in the trans-complementing MA-NSP5 cell line. rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant formed aberrant structures resembling viroplasms that poorly support RV replication. this variant was still capable of producing infectious progeny, in contrast to the two other rRV mutant strains. smFISH results confirmed the presence of small amounts of plus ssRNA in some of these aberrant structures. this is consistent with the finding that the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain did replicate, albeit at much lower levels than rRV-wt. these structures are likely to sustain virus replication with decreased efficiency, which was further confirmed by the electron microscopy analysis of MA104 cells. the presence of VP6 around these structures was observed only with the hyperphosphorylated NSP5/S67A mutant, not with the other NSP5 phosphorylation-negative mutants. the observed failure to rescue the replication of the rRV-NSP5/KO strain to the wt levels in MA-3 cells could be the consequence of the incomplete recovery of the complex pattern of phosphorylated isoforms of wt NSP5. NSP5 interactions mediated by carboxy-terminal tails T result in substrate activation and a fully hyperphosphorylated NSP5. this process leads to the assembly of viroplasm scaffolds containing NSP2 (Fig. 11f) and recruitment of VP6, as well as the other viroplasmic proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3, to assemble replication-competent viroplasms. ser45 phosphorylated by CK1 primes it for hyperphosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) (38, 39), which triggers its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. NS5A phosphorylation has been shown to play a key role in controlling the establishment of replication complexes during HCV infection. MA104-NSP2-mCherry (MA-NSP2-mCherry), MA104-3 (MA-3), MA104-tail (MA-T) and MA104-NSP5wt (MA-NSP5) stable transfectant cell lines (embryonic African green monkey kidney cells, ATCC CRL-2378) were
