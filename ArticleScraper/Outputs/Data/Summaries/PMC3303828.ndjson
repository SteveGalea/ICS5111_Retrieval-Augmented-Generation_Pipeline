{"summary": "Ad exert an adjuvant-like effect by stimulating the innate immune system through both toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent and TLR-independent pathways [3], [4]. effectiveness of Ad vector-based vaccines against many infectious diseases has been evaluated in animal models and clinical trials in humans [5]\u2013[9]. a high level (up to a neutralization titer of 2240) of vector immunity can be tolerated or effectively overcome by increasing the vaccine dose or using alternate routes of vaccination. a high level (up to a neutralization titer of 2240) of vector immunity can be tolerated by increasing the vaccine dose or using alternate routes of vaccination. both genes in HAd-HA-NP were in the E1-parallel orientation. western blot analysis was done to confirm expression of HA and NP in 293 cells. a single band at approximate molecular weight of 56 kDa representing NP was visible in the HAd-HA-NP infected 293 cell lysate. i.n. and i.m. primed groups showed a dose-dependent increase in the levels of HAd-specific neutralizing antibody titers. i.m. primed groups showed a dose-dependent increase in the levels of HAd-specific neutralizing antibody titers. mice were primed intramuscularly (i.m.) or intranasally (i.n.) with a single dose of 107, 108, or 109 p.f.u. of HAd-WT. mice were bled by retro-orbital puncture to evaluate the development of HAd-specific neutralizing antibodies. the serum HI titers in 107 HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) were 1.5\u20132 fold lower than the nave immunized groups. i.n. immunization with HAd-HA-NP induced lower serum HI titers (22) compared to the group immunized i.m. with HAd-HA-NP (80). 10 6.50.1 107 HAd-WT (i.n.) 108 HAd-HA-NP (i.n.) 160 1.5 107 HAd-WT (i.n.) 108 HAd-HA-NP (i.n.) 120 1.5 108 HAd-HA-NP (i.n.) 108 HAd-HA-NP (i.n.) 120 1.5 108 HAd-HA-NP (i.n.) 5108 HAd-HA-NP (i.n.) 278 1.5 109 HAd-WT (i.m.) 5108 HAd-E1E3 (i.m.) 10 6.50.1 107 HAd-WT (i.m.) 108 HAd-HA-NP (i.m.) 105 1.5 107 HAd-WT (i.m.) 108 HAd-HA-NP (i.m.) nave and HAd-primed mice were immunized i.m. or i.n. twice at four week interval with HAd-HA-NP. HAd-primed mice inoculated with HAd-E1E3 (vector control) served as negative controls. in 109 i.m. HAd-primed groups immunized with HAd-HA-NP, a HI titer of 30 was induced. the levels of vector immunity induced by i.m. priming with 109 p.f.u. of HAd5-WT negatively impact the development of a humoral immune response against a HAd vector-based vaccine. NP-147 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells in nave or HAd5-primed mice were immunized with HAd-HA-NP. at four weeks after final immunization, animals were euthanized. at four weeks after final immunization, animals were euthanized, and the spleens were collected. increased vaccine dose by five-fold resulted in significantly higher percentages of NP-147 epitope-specific CD8 T cells in the 109 i.n. primed group compared to the 109 i.n. primed group receiving the lower vaccine dose (108 p.f.u.). however, this increase was not noticeable in the 109 i.m. primed group. a five-fold increase in the vaccine dose resulted in an increase in the number of IFN-secreting HA-518- or NP-147-specific CD8 T cells in all the primed groups except for the 109 i.m. primed groups. the increase in preexisting HAd5-neutralizing antibodies significantly improved with an increase in the vaccine dose by five-fold. the error bars represent Mean SD from five animals/group: *, P0.05; **, P0.01; **, P0.005;, P0.001;, P0.0001. the 107 HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) immunized with HAd-HA-NP had lung viral titers at or below the level of detection. 109 i.m. HAd-primed groups immunized with HAd-HA-NP by either route (i.n. or i.n.) even a five-fold increase in the vaccine dose did not yield complete protection in the 109 i.m. HAd-primed groups immunized with HAd-HA-NP. lecular weights 77 kDa and 50 kDa were observed in the HAd-HA-NP infected 293 cell lysate. a single band at approximate molecular weight of 56 kDa representing NP was visible in the HAd-HA-NP infected 293 cell lysate. i.n. and i.m. primed groups showed a dose-dependent increase in the levels of HAd-specific neutralizing antibody titers. the i.m. primed groups resulted in the development of higher levels of HAd-specific neutralizing antibody titers compared to the i.n. primed groups. 107 i.n. or i.m. HAd-primed groups developed significantly higher serum HI titers compared to the vector control group by both i.m. and i.n. (91) routes of immunization with HAd-HA-NP. in the 108 i.n. HAd-primed group, i.n. immunization with HAd-HA-NP induced lower serum HI titers (22) compared to the group immunized i.m. with HAd-HA-NP (80). an increase in the vaccine dose by five-fold resulted in significant (P0.05) enhancement of serum HI titers in mice immunized either i.n.

HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) immunized with HAd-HA-NP had lung viral titers on day 3 post-challenge below the level of detection. 108 HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) immunized with HAd-HA-NP had lung viral titers at or below the level of detection. HAd-HA-NP by either route (i.n. or i.m.) suggests the level of preexisting vector-neutralizing antibody titer could serve as an indicator for predicting the efficacy of Ad-based influenza vaccines. several preclinical studies have suggested that the presence of preexisting HAd-specific neutralizing antibodies might inhibit the generation of immune responses against the expressed immunogen. in the presence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies (300\u2013520), there was a modest decline in the levels of CMI and HI levels in response to immunization with HAd-HA-NP. further increase in the levels of vector-specific neutralizing antibody response (1000\u20131480) resulted in a greater decline in influenza virus-specific immune responses. a HAd-based influenza vaccine showed some inhibition in eliciting immunogen-specific immune responses in the presence of vector immunity. this effect was minimized by increasing the vaccine dose [31]. however, there were no strong correlations between vector immunity levels and a decrease in vaccine efficacy. the use of all human cell lines and the construction of a hybrid cell line was with permission from the Purdue University Institutional Review Boards. the IRBs are a unit of the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) which is housed within the Office of research administration. ination technique used to insert full-length coding region of HA gene. polybasic site QRERRRKKRG was modified to QRETRG. both genes in HAd-HA-NP were in the E1-parallel orientation. induction of vector-specific immunity and evaluation of vaccine efficacy 6\u20138 week old female BALB/c mice (10 animals/group) were inoculated by either the i.m. or i.n. route with a single dose of 107, 108, or 109 p.f.u. of HAd-WT. reassortant virus is not lethal and does not produce clinical disease and weight loss in mice. lungs were collected to determine viral titers to evaluate protective efficacy. thawed lung tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of sterile PBS. isolated and stained with a murine kd\u2013specific pentamer for immunodominant NP-147 epitope (Proimmune Inc., Bradenton, FL) conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE) and an anti-CD8 antibody conjugated with Allophycocyanin (APC) splenocytes were removed by staining splenocytes with anti-CD19 flouro-isothiocyanin (FITC) and the significance was set at P 0.05. the protocol was approved by the Purdue University Biosafety Committee. the 293 cell line was obtained commercially from American Type Culture Collection. replication defect HAd-E1E3 (HAd5 vector having deletions in the E1 and E3 regions) was purified by cesium chloride density-gradient centrifugation and titrated by plaque assay on BHH2C cells. recombination technique used to insert full-length coding region of HA gene. cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot [38] with a polyclonal serum against H5 HA (obtained from Immunology and Pathogenesis Branch, Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) and a monoclonal antibody against NP (obtained from Immunology and Pathogenesis Branch, Influenza Division,. five animals from each group were euthanized to collect spleen cells to evaluate the development of HA- and NP-specific antibodies. the remaining mice from each group were challenged with 100-fold of mouse infectious dose (MID50) of a reverse genetics derived A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) [PR8] containing HA and NA gene fragments of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1). HAd neutralizing serum antibody titers were determined as previously described. the virus neutralization titer was the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely prevented the development of c.p.e. pre-challenge serum samples were analyzed for the presence of HI antibodies. Splenocytes cultured in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO) served as positive control. log-transformation of titer measurement was assessed by Shapiro-Wilktest."}
