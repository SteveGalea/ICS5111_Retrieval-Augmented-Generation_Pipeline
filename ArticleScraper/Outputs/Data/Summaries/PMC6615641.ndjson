{"summary": "TIM-1 expression has been implicated in EBOV pathogenesis. it remains unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or. a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions. infection in the TIM-1-deficient mice suggests that virus entry via this receptor contributes to virus load. proinflammatory chemokines trended higher in organs from infected TIM-1-sufficient and -deficient mice compared to the TIM-1-deficient mice. apoptotic mimicry occurs after endosomal uptake of filovirions. one important family of PS receptors is the T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain (TIM) family. hTIM-1 and hTIM-4, but not hTIM-3, enhance entry of broad range of viruses. the ability of PS on Ebola virus like particles and EBOV glycoprotein pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus to bind to TIM-1 is equivalent, suggesting similar levels of PS present on the surface of these virions [15]. TIM residues within the binding pocket are essential for virion binding and uptake. TIM-1-deficient mice have lower morbidity and mortality than wild-type mice. study highlighted role of TIM-1 in non-permissive T lymphocytes. impact of TIM-1 on viremia in mice was examined in the plasma. the impact of the loss of TIM-1 was specific for EBOV GP-expressing viruses. reduced mortality observed in the EBOV GP encoding virus-infected TIM-1-/- mice was associated at late times during infection with lower viremia and virus loads in multiple tissues previously appreciated to be important. BALB/c Ifnar-/- and BALB/c Havcr1-/- mice were crossed for the creation of heterozygous progeny. PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. recombinant, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoded GFP and EBOV GP, EBOV O or the native VSV G glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV-GFP, EBOV GPO/rVSV-GFP) mice were infected i.v. with recombinant, infectious VSV. the dose of each stock was titered in vivo to identify stock concentrations that gave predictably high levels of mortality of Ifnar-/- mice in 5\u20137 days. mice were humanely euthanized if they reached a score of 4. titers were calculated as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL. all organ titers were normalized according to the weight of the organ at harvest. total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random primers. mice were injected with 200g of anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5) and 200g anti-CD8 (clone 2.43) depleting monoclonal antibodies. mice were weighed and scored for sickness daily as described above. survival was tracked; mice were weighed and scored for sickness daily. all animal procedures approved by the UI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) the study was performed in accordance with the IACUC guidelines. mice BALB/c TIM-1-deficient mice were a kind gift from Dr. Paul Rothman. PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. recombinant, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lacking the mucin domain of GP1 (EBOV GPO/rVSV-GFP) encoding its native glycoprotein, G (G/rVSV) mice were humanely euthanized if they reached a score of 4. recombinant, infectious VSV encoded EBOV GP, EBOV O or the native VSV G glycoprotein. the dose of each stock was titered in vivo to identify stock concentrations. titers were determined by end-point dilution on vero cell. organs were thawed and filtered through a 0.45 m syringe filter. infection was scored 5 days following infection for GFP positivity. mice were injected with 200g of anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5) and 200g anti-CD8 (clone 2.43) depleting monoclonal antibodies. mice were weighed and scored for sickness daily. survival was tracked; mice were weighed and scored for sickness daily. TIM-1 enhances EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPO/rVSV infection. but not VSV To create a TIM-1 deficient mouse, exons 4 and 5 of the Havcr1 gene encoding TIM-1 were replaced with the LacZ gene by homologous recombination. EBOV GPO pseudovirions and recombinant viruses have the same tropism as virus bearing EBOV GP. TIM-1-/- mice challenged with the same dose had significantly reduced mortality following EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPO/rVSV. TIM-1-/- mice infected with 105 iu of G/rVSV by i.v. injection. survival was assessed following infection for all mouse studies. hTIM-1 does not mediate WT VSV entry. EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis in TIM-1-/- mice was due to presence of EBOV GP expressed in the recombinant VSV rather than other VSV genes. reduced pathogenesis of EBOV GP expressing virus in TIM-1-/- mice was consistent with findings described by younan et al. using maEBOV [38] reduced virus replication in a number of organs was associated with the survival observed in TIM-1-/- mice. reduced virus replication in a number of organs was associated with the survival observed in TIM-1-/- mice at late times during infection. TIM-1-/- mice exhibit elevated levels of specific proinflammatory chemokines following EBOV infection. levels in the spleen, liver and kidney were examined prior to and after infection. nar -/-/TIM-1-/- (TIM-1-/-) mice were harvested from uninfected and infected mice. tissues were harvested at 3 or 5 days following infection with 105 iu of EBOV GPO/rVSV by i.v. injection. cytokines expression relative to murine HPRT for at least three independent livers, spleens and kidneys. tissues were harvested from uninfected and infected mice. RNA was isolated from the organs and expression of proinflammatory chemokines was quantified by qRT-PCR. results represent chemokine expression relative to murine HPRT. mice were intraperitoneally administered -CD8 mAb, 2.43, and -CD4 mAb, GK1.5, at days -1 and 2 following EBOV GP/rVSV infection. we depleted T cells in control and TIM-1-/- mice to assess outcomes during EBOV pathogenesis. 102 iu of EBOV GP/rVSV administered by intravenous infection (n = 10 mice per group) and two treatments of -CD8 mAb and -CD4 mAb at Day -1 and 2 from infection. TIM-1 enhances EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPO/rVSV, but not VSV. TIM-1-/- and control mice with full length EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPO/rVSV have the same tropism as virus bearing EBOV GP. TIM-1-/- mice challenged with the same dose had significantly reduced mortality following EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GPO/rVSV infection. mice were challenged with 101 iu of G/rVSV by i.v. injection. survival was assessed following infection for all mouse studies. hTIM-1 does not mediate WT VSV entry. infections in control and TIM-1-/- mice at a challenge dose of 101 iu. results provide evidence that the difference in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis in TIM-1-/- mice was due to the presence of EBOV GP expressed in the recombinant VSV rather than other VSV genes. /rVSV loads were much reduced in the brain of TIM-1-/- mice. reduced virus replication in a number of organs was associated with the survival observed in TIM-1-/- mice. titers were not significantly different between the control and TIM-1-/- mice at 5 days following infection. TIM-1-expressing mice exhibit elevated levels of proinflammatory chemokines following EBOV. cytokines expression in liver, spleen and kidneys of EBOV GPO/rVSV-infected Ifnar-/- and Ifnar -/-/TIM-1-/- mice. tissue was harvested at 3 or 5 days following infection with 105 iu of EBOV GPO/rVSV by i.v. injection. the presence of TIM-1 in mice contributes to EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis. this is associated with increased expression of proinflammatory chemokines. this is associated with increased expression of proinflammatory chemokines. mice were intraperitoneally administered -CD8 mAb, 2.43, and -CD4 mAb, GK1.5, at days -1 and 2 of EBOV GP/rVSV infection. TIM-1-/- expression on non-T cell populations contributes to pathogenesis. survival was assessed following infection with 7x102 iu of EBOV GP/rVSV administered by intravenous infection (n = 10 mice per group) loss of TIM-1 expression decreased overall mortality and delayed time-to-death of those mice that did succumb when challenged with EBOV GP/rVSV. a number of studies have shown at early times of infection EBOV antigens are primarily, if not exclusively, found in cells of the myeloid compartment [49, 61, 62], cells that do not express TIM-1. however, as infection progresses, additional cell types become EBOV antigen positive, suggesting a spread of virus to other cell types. new studies to evaluate role of additional cell surface receptors implicated in EBOV entry would provide valuable insights to the potential receptor redundancy. these receptors include other TIM family members, TAM tyrosine kinase receptors and C-type lectins. nic B cells induce cellular activation in a wide range of organisms from zebrafish to humans. this observation has led to the understanding that TIM-1 serves as a costimulatory molecule. transient TIM-1 expression on injured kidney epithelial cells serves an anti-inflammatory role through its uptake and clearance of apoptotic bodies. a caveat to our studies is that our infections were performed in mice on an Ifnar-/- background. studies have shown that a number of cytokines and chemokines are suppressed by the absence of type I interferon (IFN) responses in the first 24 hours of virus infection. ubiquitous cell lipid components such as PS, phosphatidylinositol or the ganglioside GM3 originally were proposed as the VSV cell surface receptor. however, more recent investigations have revealed that these lipids are not readily used as VSV cell surface receptors. in vivo pathogenesis induced by VSV would differ from EBOV GP/rVSV since the dependence on LDL receptors for entry is conferred by the VSV G glycoprotein. future studies will need to explore the impact that TIM-1 expression has on EBOV infection of specific cells within these organs. we will be able to better develop TIM-1 specific therapeutics against EBOV infection of specific cells within these organs. Titers were determined by endpoint dilution of serum on vero cells. solid lines indicate geometric mean for each data set. significance was calculated by Student\u2019s t-test comparisons."}
