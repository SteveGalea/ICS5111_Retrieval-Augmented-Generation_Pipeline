{"summary": "a systematic screening procedure was implemented to identify new blood-stage proteins as potential vaccine candidates. this included analysis of temporal gene expression relative to other well-characterized invasion-type genes and in silico interrogation of protein structural features. we scanned the entire protein sequence using a current state-of-the-art online threading program to identify coiled-coil regions. parasite culture supernatant or ring-stage invasion supernatant were used as the source for native PfSRA. the immunoblots were developed using goat -rabbit horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated, secondary antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. fluorescence microscopy was performed on an Olympus fluorescence microscope (BX41) images were processed using the open access Fiji-Image J software (National Institutes of Health) new state-of-the-art online threading program to identify coiled-coil regions. synthetic peptides harbor coiled-coil signatures corresponding to conserved regions in PfSRA orthologs. naive plasma was used as negative control. parasite culture supernatant or ring-stage invasion supernatant were used as the source for native PfSRA. immunoblots were developed using goat -rabbit horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated, secondary antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. -PfSRA P3 and -PfMSP-119 polyclonal antibodies were incubated with tightly synchronized segmenting schizonts that were allowed to rupture and release merozoites. the viability of the released merozoites was assessed at the different stages (early, mid, and late) of an invading merozoite. the PfSRA protein sequence harbored coiled-coil signatures. this signature forms stable structures that elicit functional antibodies. this signature was considered as a basis for the design of 3 PfSRA peptides. anti-PfSRA antibodies detect multiple processed fragments of native PfSRA during immunoblotting of 3D7 parasite culture supernatants (CSs) that were probed with preimmune sera (I), -PfSRA P1 antibody (II), -PfSRA P2 antibody (III), and PfSRA P3 antibody (IV). the colored bars at the far right represent the predicted processed fragments. the 32-kDa processed fragment of native PfSRA bound erythrocytes in a neuraminidase-sensitive, trypsin-sensitive, and chymotrypsin-resistant manner. -EBA-175 (R217) antibodies did not detect native EBA-175 under reduced condition. da full-length PfSRA and the 58-kDa processed fragment were also detectable. binding was sensitive to neuraminidase and trypsin treatments. recombinant EBA-175 (R217) bound erythrocytes with same sensitivity to enzyme treatments. secondary antibodies used are Alexa 488\u2013conjugated goat -mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), Alexa 568\u2013conjugated goat -rabbit IgG (1:200; Life Technologies). Exposure times were identical for all images of the same channel. -PfSRA P1 antibodies and -PfMSP119 antibodies colocalized at the parasitophorous vacuole in late trophozoites. in segmenting schizonts and released merozoites, both proteins colocalized on the merozoite surface. liquid immunofluorescence assays show colabeling of rabbit -PfSRA-1 (1:100; green) with mouse -PfAMA-1 (1:100; red) antibodies on the surface of released merozoites. secondary antibodies used were Alexa 568\u2013conjugated goat -rat IgG and Alexa 488\u2013conjugated goat -rabbit IgG (1:200; Life Technologies) invading merozoites at different time-points were colabeled with -PfSRA P3 and -PfMSP119 antibodies. no labeling was observed with -Pfs48/45 antibody. plasma samples from all 3 sites appeared to recognize all 3 PfSRA peptides. reactivity against PfSRA P2 was significant compared with NHS for plasma from Navrongo (P.0001) and Accra (P =.004) but not Navrongo (Figure 4C) data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v.6.01 and presented as scatter dot plots. significance of differences between respective peptide reactivities with plasma samples across the sites was based on the adjusted P values. -PfSRA is localized on the merozoite surface. nuclei stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. secondary antibodies used were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat. 3D7 gametocytes were stained with anti-PfSRA P3 antibody (red) nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue) preimmune sera and control immunoglobulin G did not inhibit parasite invasion at lower concentrations (25\u201375 g/mL) -PfSRA antibodies showed 60% inhibition of parasite invasion at 75 g/mL. anti-basigin antibodies showed 75% inhibition of parasite invasion at 10 g/mL. anti-PfSRA antibodies were tested at lower concentrations (25\u201375 g/mL) against P. falciparum clinical isolates (MISA010 and MISA 011) and a concentration-dependent inhibition of parasite invasion was observed. -PfSRA antibodies were inhibitory at 100\u2013750 g/mL. PfSRA has a signal peptide and a predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment site. the protein sequence harbored coiled-coil signatures. this signature forms stable structures that elicit functional antibodies. cut-1 and -2 represents the GPI\u2013transamidase cleavage site for the predicted GPI attachment signal. PfSRA P1, PfSRA P2, and PfSRA P3 designate conserved regions of PfSRA in different orthologs. -PfSRA-P1 antibody (II), -PfSRA-P2 antibody (III) and PfSRA-P3 antibody (IV) were used as a control, and it bound erythrocytes in a neuraminidase-sensitive, trypsin-sensitive, and chymotrypsin-resistant manner. -EBA-175 (R217) antibodies did not detect native EBA-175 under reduced condition. the 32-kDa fragment of PfSRA was clearly detected in the eluate. the binding was sensitive to neuraminidase and trypsin treatments. the binding was resistant to chymotrypsin treatment. colabeling of rabbit -PfSRA-1 (red) with mouse -PfAMA-1 (1:100; green) antibodies in intact schizonts show that PfSRA is localized on the merozoite surface. secondary antibodies used are Alexa 488\u2013conjugated goat -mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), Alexa 568\u2013conjugated goat -rabbit IgG (1:200; Life Technologies). Exposure times were -PfSRA P1 antibodies and -PfMSP119 antibodies colocalized at the parasitophorous vacuole in late trophozoites, segmenting schizonts and released merozoites. -PfSRA P1 antibodies and -PfAMA-1 antibodies labeled the surface of nonpermeabilized merozoites. immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Alexa 568\u2013conjugated goat -rabbit IgG (1:200; Life Technologies) nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue) secondary antibodies used were Alexa 568\u2013conjugated goat -rat IgG and Alexa 488\u2013conjugated goat -rabbit IgG (1:200; Life Technologies). ding merozoites were colabeled with -PfSRA P3 and -PfMSP119 antibodies. antibody labeling was visible at the development of ring-stage parasites. merozoites were colabeled with -MSP119 and -PfSRA P3. plasma antibodies from children in Accra and Navrongo showed no reactivity to the R1 peptide beyond background levels. plasma samples from all 3 sites appeared to recognize all 3 PfSRA peptides. reactivity against PfSRA P2 was significant compared with NHS for plasma from Navrongo and Accra. RA P3 with plasma samples from children with malaria residing in different transmission zones in Ghana (Kintampo, Navrongo, and Accra) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. showed immunoglobulin G levels in the respective plasma samples at 1:100 dilution. reactivity was expressed as optical density at 462 nm. malaria-infected patient plasma from 3 endemic sites detected PfSRA peptides by immuno-dot blotting. colocalization of -PfSRA P3 human antibody (green; 1:50) showed that PfSRA is localized on the merozoite surface. -PfSRA P1 antibodies labeling both male and female gametocytes. -tubulin antibodies labeling only male gametocytes. stain-specific expression of native Plasmodium falciparum surface-related antigen. gen Peptide-Induced Antibodies evaluated invasion inhibitory activity of -PfSRA antibodies against P. falciparum 3D7 and W2mef. all PfSRA peptide antibodies exhibited 70%\u201380% inhibition at 750 g/mL. preimmune sera and control immunoglobulin G did not inhibit parasite invasion at lower concentrations. -PfSRA antibodies were tested against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain. preimmune sera and R1 peptide antibodies were used as negative controls. data represented are from 2 independent assays performed in duplicate. the presence of proteolytic cleavage sites in PfSRA may allude to processing events occurring prior to invasion of erythrocytes. the presence of these proteolytic cleavage sites in PfSRA may allude to processing events occurring prior to invasion of erythrocytes. the 3 PfSRA peptide antibodies from rabbits specifically detected breakdown products of native PfSRA in ring-stage invasion supernatant or parasite culture supernatant and schizont lysates. this indicated that PfSRA synthetic peptides are antigenic mimics of the native parasite protein. all 3 rabbit -PfSRA peptide antibodies showed circumferential association on the merozoite surface at the timing of schizont rupture and merozoite release. a clear, punctate rim-fluorescence pattern was observed for all 3 rabbit -PfSRA peptide antibodies with the gametocyte surface marker Pfs48/45. infected children residing at different endemic sites showed differences in total IgG recognition frequencies for PfSRA peptides. this could be linked to varying transmission intensity rates as reported in previous studies. neuraminidase removes sialic acids from glycophorins, trypsin cleaves peptide backbones of several receptors. the observed invasion inhibitory activity of rabbit -PfSRA peptide antibodies could be attributed to indirect effects of antibody binding to the merozoite surface. the successful purification of a limited amount of PfSRA-specific human antibodies from patient plasma suggested that the synthetic peptides possessed structural integrity."}
