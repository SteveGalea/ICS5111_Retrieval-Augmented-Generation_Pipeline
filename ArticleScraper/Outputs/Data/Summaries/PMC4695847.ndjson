{"summary": "mammalian ARTs are categorized as members of the ADP-ribosyltransferase cholera toxin-like (ARTCs) or diphtheria toxin-like (ARTDs) sub-families. ARTC enzymes transfer single ADP-ribose residues to their substrates. ARTDs are intracellular enzymes able to transfer single ADP-ribose residues to their substrates. poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 is called PARP family. a new nomenclature and classification has been proposed. the ability of intracellular ART enzymes to form ADP-ribose polymers depends on the defined H-Y-E amino acid signature in the catalytic center. MARylation activity for both enzymes has been reported [9,10] suggesting other alterations in the active center are responsible for the lack of PARylation activity. MARylation in signaling and disease Protein Enzymatic activity Cellular process/ pathway Disease-related function ARTD3 MAR DNA repair [11] Not reported ARTD4 (PARP4, vPARP) MAR Vault particles [12] Multidrug resistance [13,14,15,16] Innate immunity [13 stress granules [17] ARTD13 (PARP13, ZAP, ZC3HAV1) inactive mRNA regulation and miRNA silencing [36] Component of stress granules [17] Viral defense [36] ARTD14 (PARP7, TiPARP) MAR AHR signaling [37,38,39,40] Translation [31] TCCD-induced hepatotoxicity [40] Inhibition of viral replication [43 lysine deacetylation was catalyzed by the use of NAD+ as a co-factor. lysine deacetylation is produced by the use of nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. a first indication that Sirtuins can function as mono-ARTs stems from the analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. the lack of efficient methods to analyze MARylation poses a burden on the verification of MARylated substrates identified in various screens. the analysis of the enzymes of the ARTD sub-family revealed a multitude of other functional domains, likely reflecting the involvement of these enzymes in a variety of cellular processes. macrodomains 2 and 3 of ARTD8, which are devoid of catalytic activity, have been identified as binding modules specific for at least some MARylated substrates. ARTD8 regulates signaling pathways and gene expression by MARylation 2.1. ARTD8 acts as a \u201ctranscriptional switch\u201d for STAT6-dependent transcription. it is associated with promoters of STAT6 responsive genes. ARTD8 is associated with promoters of STAT6 responsive genes. ARTD8 activates ARTD8 catalytic activity by an unknown mechanism. ARTD8 and HDACs are thereupon released from the promoter. ARTD8 controls HDAC activity and thus potentially histone acetylation in a promoter specific manner. ARTD7, ARTD8 and ARTD12 are associated with stress granule formation. ARTD12 localizes to the autophagy receptor p62 in an ubiquitin-dependent manner. ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14 have been suggested to inhibit translation as well as viral replication. MARylation of GSK3 by ARTD10 in vitro and overexpression of ARTD10 in cells reduces GSK3s kinase activity. increased kinase activity can be observed after ARTD10 knockdown and after overexpression of the MAR-specific hydrolase MACROD2. this provides first evidence that MARylation does indeed take place in cells and is able to regulate enzymatic activity. ARTD10 has been shown to interfere with NF-B signaling. ARTD10 knockdown in U2OS cells enhances the expression of these two NF-B target genes. ARTD10 is likely recruited to K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains via its two UIMs. TCCD is an environmental pollutant arising from industrial processes that elicits toxic responses in animals and humans. TCCD causes these effects by binding to the cytoplasmic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) once activated by ligand binding, AHR translocates into the nucleus where it dimerizes with its binding partner ARNT. MARylation by ARTD14 serves as an important PTM in the pathway controlling the response to environmental toxins such as dioxin. MACROD1 might antagonize the repressive effect by removing MAR from ARTD14, AHR or other so far unidentified substrates. key players of the UPR sensing the overload of unfolded polypeptides are the two kinases IRE1 (inositol requiring enzyme 1) and PERK ( ARTD15 knockdown results in increased sensitivity to ER stress. ARTD15 is associated with IRE1 and PERK and activated under ER stress conditions. modification of both kinases with mono-ADP-ribose is increasing their kinase activity. ARTC1 is transiently up-regulated. this promotes ADP-ribosylation and therefore inactivation of BiP. a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase is present in the ER that will be interesting to identify. ARTD10 was shown to interact with PCNA mediated by a region in ARTD10 termed PIP-box. ARTD10 is important for maintaining PCNA ubiquitination levels by an as yet unknown mechanism, favoring the recruitment of error-prone translesion synthesis polymerases to stalled replication forks. new research has linked the MARylation activity of SIRT6 to DNA repair. cells lacking SIRT6 are hampered to repair DSBs and mice devoid of SIRT6 exhibit impaired base excision repair [49,104] both enzymes cannot remove the ADP-ribose bound to the protein. the final step in completely removing PARylation requires MACROD2 and/or TARG1 or potentially other as yet unidentified enzymes. TARG1 may have a weak ability to revert PARylation directly by removing PAR chains. the IL-4/STAT6 signaling pathway is an important immune regulatory pathway. ARTD8 modulates this pathway depending on its macro- and C-terminal catalytic domains. ARTD8 acts as a \u201ctranscriptional switch\u201d for STAT6-dependent transcription. ARTD8 is a subunit of a transcriptional switch that controls HDAC activity and thus potentially histone acetylation in a promoter specific manner. further studies will have to address the precise mechanism that is controlled by ARTD8 and in which cellular processes this switch is operational. ARTD10 co-localizes with p62 in an ubiquitin-dependent manner and represses NF-B signaling. ARTD10 has been identified in a screen for interaction partners of the oncoprotein c-MYC [84]. increased kinase activity can be observed after ARTD10 knockdown and after overexpression of the MAR-specific hydrolase MACROD2. this provides first evidence that MARylation does indeed take place in cells and is able to regulate enzymatic activity. crosstalk exists between MARylation and other PTMs, including phosphorylation. ARTD10 has been shown to interfere with NF-B signaling. asome-mediated degradation allows for the release of the NF-B p65/p50 dimer. ARTD10-GW/UIM, a mutant that is catalytically inactive and fails to interact with K63-linked poly-ubiquitin, has no effect. TCCD causes these effects by binding to the cytoplasmic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) once activated by ligand binding, AHR translocates into the nucleus where it dimerizes with its binding partner ARNT (AHR nuclear translocator) ARTD14 is itself regulating AHR signaling in a negative feedback loop by acting as a transcriptional repressor. ARTD15 (PARP16) was characterized as a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase. ARTD15 knockdown results in increased sensitivity to ER stress. modification of both kinases with mono-ADP-ribose is increasing kinase activity. the chaperone BiP remains bound to IRE1 and PERK when ARTD15 is depleted. an alternative model worth considering and testing is that the MARylation of these transmembranous kinases in the cytosolic portion induces a structural change in the luminal domain. -ribosylhydrolase is present in the ER that will be interesting to identify. together these studies define the ER as a subcellular site that involves MARylation in protein quality control. ARTD1 but also ARTD2 are reacting to the damage by auto-PARylation. ARTD10 is important for maintaining PCNA ubiquitination levels by an unknown mechanism. ARTD8 interacts with PCNA in cells, preferentially when these are in the S-phase of the cell cycle. ARTD8 regulates DNA strand break repair via homologous recombination. SIRT6 mutants allowing the distinction of its deacetylase activity from its MARylation activity identified the latter to be important for its role in DSB repair. it appears that SIRT6 contributes to DSB repair indirectly through activating ARTD1 by MARylation. TARG1 may have a weak ability to revert PARylation directly by removing PAR chains. they may also prevent over-activation of ARTD1 by counteracting initial ARTD1 auto-MARylation. gene instability and acquisition of mutations are characteristic steps in tumorigenesis. authors and erasers of MARylation might as well contribute to cancer development. ARTD9 (PARP9/BAL1) is a risk factor for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. it acts as an oncogenic factor in DLBCL and possibly in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. ARTD9 modulates interferon -STAT1 signaling in a way that induces a transcriptional switch. ARTD8 interacts with DTX3L and ARTD9 but does not regulate the before mentioned IFN-STAT1-IRF1 axis. ARTD8 mediates IL-4-induced inhibition of apoptosis in B cells. interaction with ARTD8\u2019s catalytic domain is restricted to ARTD8\u2019s C-terminal region comprising the WWE and the catalytic domain [21] catalytic activity of ARTD8 might be important in this process. ARTD8 might be relevant as a therapeutic target in B cell malignancies and prostate cancer. ARTD10 induces apoptosis mechanistically. a tight regulation of ARTD10 levels in cells is essential for normal cell growth. the inflammatory NF-B pathway is activated in many types of hematological malignancies and solid cancers. ARTD4 localizes to the nucleus and the mitotic spindle. ARTD4-deficient mice are prone to carcinogen-induced colon tumor formation. SIRT6 is associated with the 5\u2019-UTR of L1 retrotransposons. it regulates the recruitment of KAP1 and HP1 factors associated with heterochromatin. this promotes the recruitment of HP1 to the L1 5\u2019-UTR. MACROD1 expression is induced by estrogen/estrogen receptor alpha (ER) signaling in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. overexpression of the estrogen receptor and activated ER signaling is observed in certain breast cancer subtypes but also in other tumors. en treatment and reduces tumor formation of tamoxifen resistant cells in a xenograft model. together the studies indicate involvement of enzymes controlling MARylation in cancer. however, it is not clear whether any of the writers and erasers of MARylation function as oncoproteins. ARTD9 is up-regulated in many tumors with frequencies of up to 10%. ARTD10 is overexpressed in between 20 and 30% of liver, esophagus, and ovarian cancer. ARTD14 is overexpressed in more than 20% of esophageal cancer. ARTD12 expression is up-regulated in a type I IFN-dependent manner. the long isoform of ARTD12 as well as ARTD10 and ARTD14 inhibit replication of several RNA viruses like alphaviruses. cellular translation is blocked after overexpression of these mono-ARTDs. ARTD13 (ZAP; zinc finger anti-viral protein) occurs in two isoforms. the short isoform lacks a C-terminal ART domain, whereas the long isoform is present. ARTD13 inhibits replication of certain retro-, alpha-, filo- and hepadnaviruses. crosstalk between other members of the ARTD family and ARTD13 may contribute to its cellular functions. a tight regulation of MARylation and PARylation involving mono- and poly-ARTDs as well as PARG seems to be important for the assembly of SGs and the function of miRNP complexes. SGs can be induced during infection of cells with certain viruses, suggesting that SGs can play an active role in anti-viral defense. intracellular mono-ARTDs and MARylation play an important role in the host\u2019s immune defense against infections. RNA viruses of the toga- and Coronaviridae families encode one or more macrodomains as part of non-structural proteins that are capable of binding to ADP-ribose and PAR. this raises the possibility that viral macrodomains could act as hydrolases for ADP-ribose modifications. ins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are of a distinct Sirtuin subclass referred to as SirTMs. these genes are genetically linked to genes expressing macrodomain proteins, which are capable to revert MARylation. bacterial pathogens use toxins, including ARTs, to alter and kill host cells. ARTD8 knockout mouse model argues for pro-allergic role of ARTD8. inhibition of ARTD enzymatic activity by PJ-34 reduced signs of inflammatory TH2 response. also inhibition of ARTD enzymatic activity by PJ-34 reduced signs of inflammatory TH2 response. ARTDs and Sirtuins consume NAD+ in the process of ADP-ribosylating substrates, requiring a salvage pathway to recycle nicotinamide as well as a de novo synthesis pathway. ARTD8 and ARTD10 have been shown to modulate cell survival or apoptosis. ARTD9 acts as an oncogenic factor in DLBCL and possibly in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. ARTD8 interacts with DTX3L and ARTD9 but does not regulate the before mentioned IFN-STAT1-IRF1 axis. ARTD8 acts as a pro-survival factor in B cells. ARTD8 suppresses apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. it is mediated by ARTD8, whose expression depends on JNK2. the interaction with JNK1 is restricted to ARTD8\u2019s C-terminal region. this indicates that ARTD8 might be relevant as a therapeutic target. ARTD10 is exposed to caspase-6-mediated cleavage at D406 inactivating its pro-apoptotic properties. as a non-cleavable mutant of ARTD10 induces efficiently apoptosis, the cleavage products alone do not. a tight regulation of ARTD10 levels in cells is indispensable for normal cell growth. vault RNA molecules and the three proteins MVP (major vault protein), ARTD4 (vPARP, PARP4) and TEP1 (telomerase associated protein 1). ARTD4 localizes to the nucleus and the mitotic spindle. ARTD4-deficient mice are prone to carcinogen-induced colon tumor formation [113] this suggests that SIRT4 contributes to a metabolic checkpoint by regulation of GDH in response to genotoxic stress [45]. besides this, SIRT4 is critical for genome integrity e.g. by facilitating clearance of -H2AX foci which arise at sites of DNA damage. several studies point to an association of MACROD1 (LRP16) with cancer. MACROD1 expression is induced by estrogen/estrogen receptor alpha (ER) signaling in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. overexpression of ER signaling stimulates proliferation of mammary cells. a recent publication demonstrates that tamoxifen-resistance in breast cancer can be mediated by the related MACROD2 [65]. the authors observed amplification and overexpression of MACROD2 in tamoxifen-resistant cells and in human breast cancer samples. this suggests that MACROD2 could become an important molecular target in the treatment of tamoxifen resistant breast cancer. ARTD3 is overexpressed in more than 30% of tumors of the large intestine. ARTD9, which is a risk factor for DLBCL, is up-regulated in many tumors with frequencies of up to 10%. ARTD10 is overexpressed in between 20 and 30% of liver, esophagus and ovarian cancer. IFNs are cytokines produced upon viral infections with the aim to induce anti-viral responses via the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. ARTD12 expression is up-regulated in a type I IFN-dependent manner. cellular translation is blocked after overexpression of these mono-ARTDs. a recent report showed that several mono-ARTDs have evolved under positive selection. this includes ARTD4, the three macrodomain-containing ARTDs, ARTD7, -8 and -9, and the catalytically inactive ARTD13. ARTD4 is part of vault particles, which are linked to immunity and viral infection. ARTD13 was demonstrated to localize to stress granules along with ARTD5, -7, -8, -12 and PARG [17]. SGs are dynamic ribonucleoprotein aggregations of translationally stalled mRNAs, ribosomal subunits and different RNA binding proteins. overexpression of the SG-associated ARTDs is sufficient to induced SG assembly and several SG components are modified with ADP-ribose some viruses actively inhibit SG formation during infection. this suggests that SGs can play an active role in anti-viral defense. viruses might have developed mechanisms to evade the host\u2019s immune defense. bacterial sirtuins have been described as mono-ADP-ribosylating enzymes. they are genetically linked to genes expressing macrodomain proteins. bacterial pathogens use toxins, including ARTs, to alter and kill host cells. reduced levels of TH2-specific cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were observed in in vitro differentiated TH2 cells isolated from ARTD8-deficient mice. a model was proposed, in which ARTD8 regulates binding of STAT6 to the GATA3 promoter, thereby modulating T helper cell differentiation. the induction of allergic airway disease in this ARTD8 knockout mouse model resulted in immune cell infiltration into the lung the innate immune system recognizes the nature of the invading pathogen through interactions of PAMPs and their respective cellular pattern recognition receptors. cytokine-mediated signaling is induced upon viral infections with the aim to induce anti-viral responses via the induction of IFN-stimulated genes. mono-ARTDs are induced upon stimulation with type I IFNs and exert anti-viral effects. ARTD12 is able to induce expression of an NF-B-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid and of endogenous NF-B target genes. MARylation by ARTD10 and ARTD12 may therefore modulate immune responses by targeting this pathway. ARTD4 is part of vault particles, which are linked to immunity and viral infection. crosstalk between other members of the ARTD family and ARTD13 might contribute to its cellular functions. ARTD13 localizes to stress granules (SGs) along with ARTD5, -7, -8, -12 and PARG. ARTD13 regulates miRNA silencing. intracellular mono- and poly-ARTDs and MARylation play an important role in the host\u2019s immune defense against infections. RNA viruses of the toga- and Coronaviridae families encode one or more macrodomains as part of non-structural proteins that are capable of binding to ADP-ribose and PAR. mutations in viral macrodomains result in reduced virulence in mice. mutation of the SARS-CoV macrodomain confers increased sensitivity to IFN treatment. to what extent these macrodomains interfere with ADP-ribosylation in the host cell needs to be investigated. ARTD8 regulates binding of STAT6 to the GATA3 promoter, thereby modulating T helper cell differentiation. reduced levels of TH2-specific cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 were observed in differentiated TH2 cells isolated from ARTD8-deficient mice. MARylation of HDAC2/3 and p100, or MARylation of additional substrates plays a role in these processes, has not been investigated in these studies. this is most likely the tip of the iceberg and we expect to see more evidence for regulatory functions of MARylation and the enzymes that control this PTM."}
