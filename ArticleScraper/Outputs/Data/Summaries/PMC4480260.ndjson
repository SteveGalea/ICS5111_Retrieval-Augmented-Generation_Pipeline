{"summary": "stem cell transplantation involves the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells from a suitable donor to a patient who has undergone chemotherapy. HSCT involves the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells from a suitable donor to a patient who has undergone chemotherapy. the goal of many HCT protocols is to achieve optimal graft-versus-tumor (GVT) activity in patients with malignant disease. bone marrow transplantation has been used as a treatment of choice in allogeneic transplantation. significant morbidity and mortality is associated with allogeneic HCT due to regimen-related toxicity (RRT),5 infection,6 and graft versus host disease. testing has become mandatory by the American Association of Blood Bank (AABB) the infectious disease screening was done as per the AABB standards 5.8.4 & 5.8.5.12. all samples that are pending Infectious disease screening results have to be quarantined. travel history includes travel to certain countries that is in the list of countries with prominent endemic diseases that might be transmitted through HSCT (e.g malaria); Chagas\u2019 disease, viral hepatitis and leishmaniasis. it must be ascertained if there is a history of blood product transfusion, solid organ transplantation in the previous 12 months. the total number of donors/patients recruited for stem cell transplantation was 278. a complete infectious disease screening on all donors/patients was carried out. the questionnaire is written in dual language namely English and Arabic. screening is carried out on donors (allogeneic) and on patients (autologous) as part of the bone marrow transplantation workup procedure. HIV, Hepatitis and CMV-IgM screening are performed by the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent assay. the number of positive cases in Infectious disease screening are listed. test for HIV, HBV and HCV are done by serology (designated as S) and by NAT analysis of the DNA/RNA. we have tabulated the distribution of the male and female donors among the various age groups from autologous and allogeneic donors. Table 2: Table showing the distribution of the autologous and allogeneic donors among various age groups. the isolation and transplantation regime of Hematopoietic Stem Cells has been published by us recently in the Journal of Transplantation. we have devised a new and a novel strategy to isolate stem cells from suitable donors and enumerate the number of stem cells that will be isolated from each collection. testing was done only by ELISA but became mandatory in 2010. NAT testing was mandatory for HIV and HCV. it became important to detect small quantities of RNA from the serum. anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with hepatitis B virus. this indicates that either the infection is resolved or it is a false positive result for Hepatitis B. a single autologous case (0.38%) where there was a positive indication for Hepatitis C virus. allogenenic donors showed a seropositive result to infectious disease screening. this indicates that there was a previous incidence of Hepatitis B but not currently prevalent in the donor at the moment. donor screening regime includes physical examination of the donor, history of previous donation and review of medical records. only a perfect match is allowed to donate as part of the directed donation regime. l involved in the collection, transportation, processing, storage and finally transplantation require to follow a strict protocol. it is imperative to ensure absolute Hematopoietic Stem Cell Graft safety for a successful transplantation outcome. we collect a minimum of 2.5\u20135 106 CD 34+ cells from each donor/patient per kg body weight. each collection is performed when the CD 34+ level reaches a minimum of 10 cells/l. a strict regime in infectious disease screening for allogeneic donors was maintained and found to be free from HIV, Hepatitis, syphilis and cytomegalovirus. the infectious disease screening is done as per the AABB Standards (5.8.5) involving Infectious disease screening. the tests are done for HIV, HBsAg, HBc, HCV and syphilis. between 1996 till date, peripheral blood stem cell units were harvested from 263 donors/patients. we do not have the data for anti-HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibodies) in order to indicate whether the presence of HBc antibodies is due to any recent vaccination. there was a single autologous case (0.38%) where there was a positive indication for Hepatitis C virus. this was confirmed by the NAT testing protocol. we have not performed any tests on the Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) nor have performed tests for Anti-Hepatitis B e antibody (Anti-HBe) there is a high prevalence of Hepatitis cases in Saudi Arabia. the donor screening regime includes physical examination of the donor, history of previous donation and review of medical records. this screening must be done preceding donation. 2 ml of the donor plasma was stored in Stem Cell Collection due to the possibility of development of new risk assessment. human T Lymphocyte Virus (HTLV) has been included in the infectious disease screening parameters by AABB. the severity and intensity of the disease may to localized to a particular region or may be country specific. sting of the donor sample is not required. all samples for PBSC are stored transiently until they are transplanted back to the patient."}
