{"summary": "study was performed to investigate the clinical significance of the serum albumin/globulin ratio (AGR) in elderly patients with AECOPD. differences in the AGR, logarithm of the serum C-reactive protein (LogCRP) level, prealbumin (PA) level, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) level were compared. acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is an acute event characterized by a worsening of the patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms that are beyond normal day-to-day variations. in 2020, COPD will represent the fifth largest disease burden worldwide and the third largest cause of death worldwide. 252 AECOPD patients were enrolled (228 men and 24 women; age range, 60\u201396 years; mean age, 71.769.36 years) in accordance with the pulmonary function classification, AECOPD patients were assigned to GOLD I, II, II, and IV groups. the body mass index (BMI) was equal to weight (kg)/height (m2). no bronchodilators were used for 24 hours before testing. no bronchodilators were used for 24 hours before testing. the relationship between the AGR and hospital stay (day) was analyzed using the chi-square test. the inclusion criteria of stable COPD patients were: diagnosed with COPD according to the GOLD criteria. 89 stable COPD patients were enrolled after screening. exclusion criteria included respiratory system diseases, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. serum was analyzed with a 7,600 automatic biochemical analyzer. the AGR was calculated as follows: AGR = albumin/(total protein\u2014albumin) the logarithmic transformation (LogCRP) was used to obtain a normal distribution. AGR, (B) LogCRP, (C) IgG, and (D) PA in AECOPD patients, stable COPD patients, and healthy controls. data are presented as box plots representing median values with interquartile ranges. P values of 0.05 indicate statistically significant difference. the P values were calculated by the Kruskal-Wallis test. AECOPD, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. use of AGR, PA, and logCRP to determine if AECOPD is associated with infection. optimal cutoff values of AGR, PA, and logCRP were 1.37, 145.00 mg/L, and area under the curve (AUC) was 0.718. AGR, albumin/globulin ratio; logCRP, logarithm of the serum C-reactive protein; PA, prealbumin. comparison of the AECOPD patients combined infection rate after grouping according to the optimal cutoff value. AGR, albumin/globulin ratio and logarithm of the serum C-reactive protein (LogCRP) were significantly lower in patients with stable COPD and AECOPD than in healthy controls (P0.001) logarithm of the serum C-reactive protein (LogCRP) was higher in patients with stable COPD and AECOPD than in healthy controls (P0.001) the AGR decreased as the pulmonary function classification increased (P0.001) the PA level (P0.001) and LogCRP (P=0.024) were significantly different but the IgG level (P=0.450) was not significantly different among patients with different GOLD stages. logCRP was higher in patients with than without infection (P=0.012) the IgG level (P=0.936) and BMI (P=0.090) were not significantly different between the two groups (Table 2). Comparison of each index between patients with AECOPD with and without infection. the optimal cutoff value of the PA level was 1.002 (10.046 mg/L) and the AUC was 0.618 (95% CI, 0.550\u20130.685; P=0.001) combined infection rate was different in elderly patients with AECOPD with an AGR of 1.37 versus 1.37 (P0.001) combined infection rate was higher in patients with a LogCRP of 1.002 than 1.002 (P0.001) logCRP 69.11 56.03 0.001 1.002 (n=145) 94 (64.83) 51 (35.17) 1.002 (n=107) 42 (39.25) 65 (60.75) Data are presented as n (%) or %. P values of 0.05 indicate a statistically significant difference. pulmonary function testing is not yet available in primary hospitals. the AGR is a simple indicator of biochemical liver function. it is mainly affected by serum albumin and globulin concentrations. a national cohort study revealed that a higher age is associated with greater declines in the albumin level and more complications. a low albumin concentration is a risk factor for acute respiratory failure in patients with COPD (15). infection is one of the main causes of AECOPD and increased mortality (17). the cutoff value of the AGR (1.37) had high sensitivity and specificity in determining the presence of infection in patients with AECOPD. the AGR is an effective marker for ruling out feline infectious peritonitis (21). medical records of elderly patients with COPD in Nanning of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of china were not strong. a study found that use of the AGR is beneficial in the assessment of the clinical condition, presence of infection, treatment options, clinical path, and prognosis in elderly patients."}
