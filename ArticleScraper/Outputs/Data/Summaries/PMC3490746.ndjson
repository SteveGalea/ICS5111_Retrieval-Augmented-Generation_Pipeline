{"summary": "hepatic steatosis is recognized as a major risk factor for liver disease progression and impaired response to interferon-based therapy. the mechanism of response to interferon-based therapy under the condition of hepatitis C is unexplored. the standard of care for chronic HCV genotype 1 infection includes a combination of interferon-alpha (IFN-), ribavirin and one of the protease inhibitors (either telaprevir or boceprevir) this triple combination therapy has greatly improved the sustained antiviral responses among chronic HCV patients. the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in chronic hepatitis C patients has been reported to vary between 50-80%. the increased lipogenesis and the free fatty acid overflow to hepatocytes have been proposed to be the major cause for hepatic steatosis. stable S3-GFP replicon cell line (HCV2a) was maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum albumin. antibody to p-PKR (pT446) was obtained from Epitomics, Burlingame, CA. a mouse monoclonal antibody to IFNAR1 (GB8) was provided by Biogen Idec Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA. the intracellular fat content was quantitated using a microfluorometer. the assay uses a tetrazolium compound (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) the effect of FFA treatment on the cell proliferation was measured by flow analysis. real-time RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated from the cells using the GITC method. pJFH-V3-Rluc plasmid was linearized with Xba I, extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. the effect of FFA treatment on Jak-Stat signaling and IFN- (pISRE-Firefly luciferase) promoter activity was examined using a published protocol (21) the activity was measured by co-transfecting 0.5 g of p5XATF6GL3 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) DNA along with pRL-TK plasmid (0.5 g) in S3-GFP cells 24 h prior to FFA treatment the cells were incubated with MACH4 HRP Polymer (Biocare Medical, MRH534) for 30 minutes. the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 seconds. the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 seconds and Tacha\u2019s bluing Solution for 30 seconds. t Protein lysates from S3-GFP replicon cells were prepared after treatment with FFAs. antibody to p-PKR (pT446) was obtained from cell signaling, Beverly, CA. hepatocyte monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 15 minutes with Nile red solution at 37\u00b0C. the intracellular fat content was quantitated using a microfluorometer (excitation 488 nm and emission 550 nm) pJFH-V3-Rluc plasmid was linearized with Xba I, extracted with phenol /chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. pJFH-V3-Rluc plasmid was linearized with Xba I, extracted with phenol /chloroform. infected Huh-7.5 cells were cultured long-term by splitting at a 1:10 ratio at five-day intervals. infected culture washed with PBS and then incubated with 10% FBS. cells were fixed in chilled acetone for 15 minutes and then permeabilized by treatment with Reveal Decloaker RTU (Biocare Medical, RV 100) for 25 minutes at boiling point. slides were then cooled down at room temperature for 25 minutes. fatty acids were mixed at a ratio of 2:1 and directly added to the cell culture medium supplemented with 1% BSA to induce steatosis in S3-GFP cells in culture. the concentration of saturated fatty acids to nonsaturated fatty acids used in our study is comparable to the pathological range of human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. hepatocellular steatosis in HCV cell culture was carried out using highly viable concentrations of FFA (10\u2013100 M) to determine its impact on virus replication and IFN- antiviral response. hepatocellular steatosis in replicon cells was characterized by a number of methods. the expression of HCV GFP fusion protein was monitored using fluorescence microscopy. the mean fluorescence of GFP-positive cells following FFA treatment for 5-days was increased from 69.1% to 76.8% as compared to cells treated with BSA. the effect of long-term co-culture of FFA on HCV replication was measured using a persistently infected HCV cell culture system. persistently infected cells were cultured with the FFA for 5, 10 and 15 days then HCV replication in the culture with or without FFA treatment was measured by Renilla luciferase activity. results show a statistically significant increase in the HCV replication with a concentration of 100 M of FFA. HCV-Renilla luciferase activity of infected Huh-7.5 cells cultured long-term in growth media by splitting at a 1:10 ratio at five days intervals. the values in the y-axis represent the normalized Renilla luciferase values per one g of total protein. titer of HCV RNA in the replicon culture was quantified using a real-time RT-PCR assay. the effect of FFA treatment on the IFN- antiviral response was confirmed using a persistently infected cell culture model. infected cells treated with FFA showed a dose dependent increase in Renila luciferase activity. the values in the y-axis represent the values normalized per g of protein lysates. the values in the x-axis represent the different concentrations of IFN- (IU/ml) expression level of IFNAR1 in S3-GFP replicon cells with or without FFA treatment was examined by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. results indicate that FFA treatment resulted in reduced expression of IFNAR1 but not of IFNAR2. values expressed as fold induction of control. -actin levels were used as loading controls. -actin levels were used as loading controls. steatosis in HCV cell culture Oleate (unsaturated) and palmitate (saturated) fatty acids were mixed at a ratio of 2:1. the concentration of saturated fatty acids to nonsaturated fatty acids used in our study is comparable to the pathological range of human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. hepatocellular steatosis was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after Nile red staining. hepatocellular steatosis in HCV cell culture was carried out using highly viable concentrations of FFA (10\u2013100 M) to determine its impact on virus replication and IFN- antiviral response. hepatocellular steatosis in HCV replicon cells was characterized by a number of methods. the expression of HCV GFP fusion protein was monitored using fluorescence microscopy. the mean fluorescence of GFP-positive cells following FFA treatment for 5-days was increased from 69.1% to 76.8% as compared to cells treated with BSA. the effect of long-term co-culture of FFA on HCV replication was measured using a persistently infected HCV cell culture system. persistently infected cells were cultured with the FFA for 5, 10 and 15 days then HCV replication in the culture with or without FFA treatment was measured by Renilla luciferase activity. results show a statistically significant increase in the HCV replication with a concentration of 100 M of FFA. infected cells were cultured long-term in growth media by splitting at a 1:10 ratio. values in the y-axis represent the normalized Renilla luciferase values per one g of total protein. effects of long-term culture FFA on HCV replication. the effect of FFA treatment on the IFN- antiviral response was confirmed using a persistently infected cell culture model. infected Huh-7.5 cells were co-cultured with different concentrations of FFA (0\u2013100 M) then for 5-days after that, the cultures were treated with IFN- for 72 h. the values in the y-axis represent the values normalized per g of protein lysates. the values in the x-axis represent the different concentrations of IFN- (IU/ml) expression level of IFNAR1 in S3-GFP replicon cells with or without FFA treatment was examined by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. results indicate that FFA treatment resulted in reduced expression of IFNAR1 but not of IFNAR2. Western blot analysis showed different concentration of FFA induces BIP, IRE1-, phospho PKR, phospho eIF2 and SOCS3 in S3-GFP replicons. -actin levels were used as loading controls. hepatic steatosis can develop secondary to obesity, DM, alcohol abuse, protein malnutrition, carbohydrate overload, and chronic HCV infection. the presence of hepatocellular steatosis in patients with chronic HCV infection affects liver disease progression, pathogenesis, and treatment response. tosis was induced in HCV replicon cells with a mixture of saturated and non-statured FFAs. our results support that FFA treatment can induce steatosis in HCV cells in a dose-dependent manner. chronic HCV patients with steatosis have increased lipid droplets in hepatocytes that block interferon-dependent Jak-Stat signaling. the role of IFNAR1 expression has been correlated with the response to IFN- therapy in chronic hepatitis C (48\u201352) increased expression of SOCS3 protein is associated with non-response to IFN- therapy. these investigators proposed that increased SOCS3 expression also blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in response to IFN- stimulation. also found that SOCS3 levels are increased but SOCS1 are not increased. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
