{"summary": "in 60% of hospitals, vacancy rates for RNs have increased since 1999. 14% of hospitals now report a severe nurse shortage. demand for RNs is projected to grow by 22% by 2008. 2% expressed poor working conditions as the reason. the cost of replacing one RN to be $30,000\u2013$64,000 (4). many healthcare facilities have increased nurses' patient loads or expanded the use of nonpermanent staff. many studies have found that the times of higher ratios of \"pool staff\" to \"regular staff\" were independently associated with healthcare-associated infections. increased RN skill mix decreases the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (20,29,30) 4,535 patients Float RNs >60% central venous catheter days increased risk for BSId Haley et al. (26) 85-bed neonatal ICU. 76 infants MRSA infections increased within 1 month of worsening workloadc Robert et al. (21) 20-bed surgical ICU. in 2001, hospitals reported 293,600 nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses among their personnel. in 2001, nursing aides and orderlies reported the highest number of occupational injuries that resulted in days away from work of any service industry. RNs had the second highest number (24,400) (33). poor organizational climate and high workloads were associated with 50% to 200% increases in the likelihood of needlestick injuries and near-misses among hospital nurses. emerging infectious diseases and outbreaks of recognized contagious illnesses have highlighted other concerns about the safety of healthcare workers. a survey of RNs found 88% of respondents reported health and safety concerns related to work. 75% felt the quality of nursing care had declined in their work setting in the past 2 years. nearly 55% of the nurses surveyed would not recommend the nursing profession as a career for their children or friends. costs of care increase when patients have adverse outcomes (40) and nurses' working conditions affect outcomes. cost-benefit ratio is not known and economic analyses need to be conducted. policy solutions for nurse staffing fall into two general categories: incentives and funding for various parties to increase the supply of nurses. nursing is a predominately female occupation in which the working conditions are often poor. such conditions contribute to recruitment and retention problems. the result is a shortage of qualified nurses."}
