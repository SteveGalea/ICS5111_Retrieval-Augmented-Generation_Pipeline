{"summary": "estimates show that within the first 6\u20139 months of a pandemic, vaccine companies will be only able to produce enough doses to vaccinate 700 million persons. this number is less than the combined populations of the 9 countries that produce almost all of the world\u2019s seasonal influenza vaccines. these countries will first use their vaccines to ensure that their own populations are protected. government officials in a few industrialized countries have placed their hopes on stockpiles of antiviral agents, primarily oseltamivir. oseltamivir has developed resistance to oseltamivir, and similar antiviral resistance could develop in a future pandemic virus. influenza virologists report that recent isolates of highly pathogenic influenza viruses (H5N1 and H7N1) have acquired molecular characteristics suggesting they might become more easily transmissible among humans (5,6). if a pandemic virus were to emerge with a level of virulence approaching that of influenza virus A (H5N1) in Indonesia, it could lead to a global population collapse. no deaths Case-fatality rate, % 24 h 2 0 0 0\u20134 d 11 5 45 0\u20136 d 37 24 65 >6 d 49 40 82 Any treatment 86 64 74 No treatment 33 33 100 All cases 119 97 82 *Adapted from (7). study was designed to determine whether selection and transmission of a new reassortant influenza A virus could occur under experimental conditions in vivo that mimic what might occur in nature. all contact birds soon died of fulminant infection caused by the reassortant virus. genetic reassortment gave rise to a new influenza virus that led to a total population collapse. the current approach to pandemic planning for all countries involves small groups of health officials, influenza scientists, and company executives. Oshitani et al. have called for better preparedness planning, improved systems for medical care and public health, expanded use of nonpharmaceutical interventions, and strengthened core capacities for seasonal influenza surveillance and vaccination. a pandemic is a global issue, and pandemic preparedness should be considered from a global perspective. a top-down approach will not ensure adequate and affordable supplies of vaccines against pandemic viruses and antiviral agents can be produced and distributed in time. a preliminary report has shown that in 67 pneumonia patients, treatment with statins reduced the hospital mortality rate by 51% (p = 0.026) in intensive care units, treatment with statins reduced the hospital mortality rate by 51% (p = 0.026) et al.
