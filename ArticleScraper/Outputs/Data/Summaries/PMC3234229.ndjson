{"summary": "the size of RNA virus genomes is thought to be limited by the error prone nature of the viral polymerase. many viruses have also evolved to use a mechanism that creates overlapping reading frames through the use of two or more transcription initiation sites or translation start codons within the same RNA sequence [4], [5]. murine norovirus has allowed an unprecedented analysis of the immune response to norovirus infection [17],[18]\u2013[21]. this broadening in understanding of norovirus replication has been facilitated greatly by the development of murine norovirus reverse genetics [22], [23] and its recent optimisation [24]. we have described the ORF4 gene product as virulence factor 1 (VF1) the study provides important insights into the mechanisms of norovirus avoidance of the innate immune response and norovirus pathobiology. the NS1-7 nomenclature of the mature peptides generated from ORF1 is also shown. s of ORF1, ORF3 and the predicted single coding region of ORF2 is markedly suppressed in the predicted ORF4 and double coding region of ORF2. dN/dS ratios, namely the substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites, ranging between 0.03\u20130.10 are indicative of strong negative selection. the existence of a second reading frame in ORF2 leads to altered codon usage by the ORF4/VF1 coding sequence. there was a significant overrepresentation of the UUG triplet coding for leu in ORF4. there were no differences in leu codon usage between ORFs 1, 2 (single coding region) and ORF3. a coupled transcription and translation reaction of the MNV-1 sgRNA produced three proteins and the identity of the major (VP1) and minor (VP2) capsid proteins were confirmed using immunoprecipitation. polyclonal antisera to a peptide from MNV-1 VF1 was generated in rabbits and used to confirm the identity of the VF1 protein product. VF1 was readily detected as early as 9 hours post infection. the viral RNA polymerase NS7 was detected as early as 6 hours post infection. VF1 and VP2 expression levels observed over the course of the infection were significantly different, with VF1 being expressed to a higher degree than VP2. all mutations were introduced at positions where it was possible to change the VF1 coding sequence without affecting the major capsid protein VP1. in vitro coupled transcription and translation of a PCR product encompassing the sgRNA of each mutant compared to wild-type MNV-1. VF1 was readily detected after in vitro translation of the sgRNA from either the M1 or M10 VF1 truncations as expected. the levels of VF1 produced by the VF1 knockout viruses were comparable to the wild-type MNV-1 derived from cDNA. it is possible that the truncation of VF1 in the mutant M20 results in some protein misfolding, decreasing the half-life of the resulting truncated protein. products containing the subgenomic RNA region under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter were generated from either wild-type (WT), M1, M10 or M20 VF1 mutants. radioactively labeled proteins were subsequent resolved by SDS-PAGE, prior to exposure to film. VP1* represents a potential shorter VP1 product generated by translation initiation from an AUG initiation codon in-frame yet downstream from the authentic VP1 AUG the positions of the introduced stop codons in the mutants M1, M10 and M20 are boxed as are the sequences after 5 repeated passages in cell culture. Western blot analysis of VF1 and VP2 expression in cells infected with either wild-type MNV or passage 5 VF1 mutant viruses. mutation is predicted to result in the introduction of a tryptophan at position 99. in contrast, sequence analysis of the M20 virus showed that the introduced mutation (G5655A) was in fact stable (Figure 3E), which may indicate that the major functional domain lay within the 195 amino acids. FP demonstrated a pattern of EGFP expression characteristic of mitochondrial localization. this was confirmed via co-staining of cells with mitochondrial vital stain Mitotracker (Invitrogen) similar co-localization of VF1-GFP and mitochondria was observed in BHK and 293 cells. expression levels observed in cells transfected with the VF1-GFP fusion proteins were substantially lower than those observed in infected cells. VF1 production affects mitochondrial-dependent innate immune signalling RNA viruses frequently encode proteins that antagonize the innate immune response to infection. VF1 production affects mitochondrial-dependent innate immune signalling RNA viruses frequently encode proteins that antagonize the innate immune response to infection. CXCL10, ISG54 and IFN-Beta mRNA levels were normalized to the amount of viral RNA present in each sample in order to calculate the rate of induction of the innate immune response over time. this method of data normalization was also used to overcome variations often observed in the rate of virus replication seen in a variety of clones. the amount of IFN-Beta protein in infected cells was significantly higher in M1 than WT infected cells at 24 hours post infection. protein production was normalized to a constant level of viral RNA. VF1 antagonizes the innate immune response to MNV infection. MEF cells transfected with an IFN-Beta promoter were co-transfected with plasmid DNA expressing VF1 or blank message. luciferase production was assayed 24 hours post transfection as described in the Materials and Methods. over-expression of VF1 in cells transfected with the IFN-Beta promoter driven reporter resulted in an expected increase in luciferase production. however, this induction was significantly reduced in all cases where VF1 was co-transfected in comparison to the empty vector. VF1 plays a role in controlling virus-induced apoptosis MNV-1 infection. western blot analysis of extracts from cells infected as detailed in (A) showed a notable alteration to the kinetics of viral protein production in the later stages of virus infection. VP1 and NS7 levels continued to increase from 15 hours onwards in cells infected with the M1 virus. samples were analyzed at 16 hours post infection with triplicate samples taken. the mean and standard error within a single experiment are plotted. VF1 contributes to virus replication in vivo. VF1 expression is required for virus efficient replication in vivo. age and sex matched mice were inoculated with 1107 TCID50 of low passage, sequence verified, wild-type (WT) or VF1 knockout (M1) viruses. virulence was not evident in this model even for the WT virus. mate 296 to lysine in the major capsid protein VP1 was sufficient to restore virulence to the tissue culture adapted strain of MNV-1. this sequence more faithfully represents the consensus sequence in viruses isolated from infected STAT1-/- mice. initial analysis of the levels of virus obtained after reverse genetics recovery of the VF1 mutant virus M1 in the virulent backbone (referred to herein as M1-v) showed identical levels to the wild-type inoculation was followed by a rapid and statistically significant weight loss (P0.001) weight loss compared to animals inoculated with mock RAW264.7 cell lysate (day 4 onwards) all mice inoculated with the VF1 mutant virus (M1-v) showed a delayed onset of clinical signs. lysate preparation was performed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests (WT-v versus M1-v) the hash and asterisk highlight animal number 776 and 751 used in the sequence analysis on days 5 and 7 respectively as described in the text. RT-PCR quantification of viral genome copies in various tissues isolated at 3 (A) or 5 (B) days post infections with either wild type (WT-v) or VF1 knockout (M1-v) the genome equivalent per g of RNA was then determined by comparison to a standard curve generated from in vitro transcribed RNA. each RNA sample was analyzed at least in duplicate and the mean taken. the spleen from animals infected with M1-v appeared activated with partial paracortical hyperplasia. the liver revealed a partial loss of cellularity; however, evidence of apoptosis was again absent. pathology is markedly reduced in the absence of VF1 expression. highest degree of clinical signs (and viral genomes determined by qRT-PCR) was undertaken. animal culled on day 5 displayed similar disease onset to that of WT-v inoculated animals. animal culled on day 7 for sequence analysis was removed from the study due to human end points being exceeded. dN/dS ratios, namely substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites, are indicative of strong negative selection. in the double coding region of ORF2 (i.e. the region which codes for both VP1 and VF1), the restricted variability occurs at synonymous sites in the ORF2 reading frame (dN/dS: 0.044) p0.001 in a 62 contingency table for the 6 synonymous leu codons. there were no differences in leu codon usage between ORFs 1, 2 and ORF3. the relative likelihood that a given sequence region is single-coding or double-coding was calculated. polyclonal antisera to a peptide from MNV-1 VF1 was generated in rabbits and used to confirm the identity of the VF1 protein product by immunoprecipitation. full length his-tagged VF1 purified from E.coli was poorly immunogenic. a modified immunization protocol that used a variety of forms of VF1 followed by affinity purification was required in order to obtain reactive antisera. VF1 was readily detected as early as 9 hours post infection. the viral RNA polymerase NS7 was detected as early as 6 hours post infection. this may be a reflection of the sensitivity of the antisera used in the assay. all mutations were introduced at positions where it was possible to change the VF1 coding sequence without affecting the major capsid protein VP1. in vitro coupled transcription and translation of a PCR product encompassing the sgRNA of each mutant compared to wild-type MNV-1. VF1 was readily detected after in vitro translation of the sgRNA from either the M1 or M10 VF1 truncations as expected. the levels of VP2 produced by the VF1 knockout viruses were comparable to the wild-type MNV-1 derived from cDNA. it is possible that the truncation of VF1 in the mutant M20 results in some protein misfolding, decreasing the half-life of the resulting truncated protein. VP1* represents a potential shorter VP1 product generated by translation initiation from an AUG initiation codon in-frame yet downstream from the authentic VP1 AUG. western blot analysis of RAW264.7 cells infected with either wild-type (WT), M1, M10 or M20 VF1 mutant viruses. mutants infected with either wild-type MNV or passage 5 VF1 mutant viruses M1, M10 and M20 were harvested, separated by SDS-PAGE prior to western blot analysis using antisera to either VF1 or VP2. lack of VF1 results in a \u2018fitness cost\u2019 in tissue culture. VF1 is not essential for virus replication in tissue culture. the mutation is predicted to result in the introduction of a tryptophan at position 99. however, sequence analysis of the M20 virus showed that the introduced mutation (G5655A) was in fact stable (Figure 3E), which may indicate that the major functional domain lay within the 195 amino acids. this reduced level may be due to the effect of the amino acid change on VF1 protein stability. similar co-localization of VF1-GFP and mitochondria was observed in BHK and 293 cells. expression levels observed in cells transfected with the VF1-GFP fusion proteins were substantially lower than those observed in infected cells. expression was not detectable by western blot analysis with either -VF1 or -GFP antisera. VF1 production affects mitochondrial-dependent innate immune signalling RNA viruses frequently encode proteins that antagonize the innate immune response to infection. mitochondria play a significant role in signaling innate immune responses through the well characterized mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), an integral membrane protein found in the outer mitochondrial membrane. this method of data normalization was also used to overcome variations often observed in the rate of virus replication seen in a variety of RAW264.7 cell clones. normalizing the mRNA fold change to a constant amount of MNV RNA established that in all cases examined the M1 infection causes a much more rapid induction of the innate immune response. for instance, CXCL10 in M1 infected cells is induced 15.5 fold more quickly in response to the same amount of viral RNA than VF1 antagonizes the innate immune response to MNV infection. time course of ISG54 and CXCL10 mRNA expression in AW264.7 cells infected at an MOI of 0.1 TCID50 per cell. mRNA levels were quantified using an endogenous control gene. plasmid DNA expressing VF1 or blank message was assayed 24 hours post transfection. transfections were carried out in triplicate. error bars denote standard deviation from mean. FN-Beta promoter driven reporter resulted in an expected increase in luciferase production in all cases. however, this induction was significantly reduced in all cases where VF1 was co-transfected. VF1 plays a role in controlling virus-induced apoptosis MNV-1 infection. VP1 and NS7 levels continue to increase from 15 hours onwards. levels of infectious virus produced during infection were identical. induction of caspase 3/7 activities was shown to be due to virus replication as prior virus inactivation by UV treatment prevented virus induced caspase activity. the mean and standard error within a single experiment are plotted. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired two tailed t-test (WT versus M1) P0.01 is illustrated as ** and P0.001 is shown as ***. Western blot analysis of GAPDH, NS7 and cleaved caspase 3 for the same samples is also shown. VF1 expression is required for virus efficient replication in vivo. age and sex matched C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 1107 TCID50 of low passage, sequence verified, wild-type (WT) or VF1 knockout (M1) viruses. the mean weight and the standard error are plotted as a line graph covering the duration of the experiment. the VF1 mutation M1 was generated in an MNV-1 cDNA clone bearing two mutations (G2151A and A5941G) this sequence more faithfully represents the consensus sequence in viruses isolated from infected STAT1-/- mice. initial analysis of the levels of virus obtained after reverse genetics recovery of the VF1 mutant virus M1 in the virulent backbone (referred to herein as M1-v) showed identical levels to the wild-type virulent virus all mice inoculated with the VF1 mutant virus (M1-v) showed a delayed onset of clinical signs. a statistically significant weight loss, compared to the mock-inoculated control group, was not observed until 6 days post infection. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests (WT-v versus M1-v) animal number 776 and 751 used in the sequence analysis on days 5 and 7 respectively. animal 751 was removed from the study on day 7 due to humane endpoints. post infections with either wild type (WT-v) or VF1 knockout (M1-v) were isolated and RNA extracted. the genome equivalent per g of RNA was then determined by comparison. each RNA sample was analyzed at least in duplicate and the mean taken. the spleen from animals infected with M1-v appeared activated with partial paracortical hyperplasia. the liver revealed a partial loss of cellularity; however, evidence of apoptosis was again absent. pathology is markedly reduced in the absence of VF1 expression. the animal culled on day 7 for sequence analysis was removed from the study due to human end points being exceeded and had lost 7.6% of its initial body weight. Consensus sequence analysis, which under the conditions used could reproducibly detect reversion when 25% of the population had restored VF1, failed to detect any reversion in any of the tissues. of the 30 clones sequenced, none contained a mutation in VF1 that would lead to restoration of VF1 expression. suppression of variability in this region and conservation of the alternate ORF was shown to be absolute in all available MNV sequences. the resultant full length protein, VF1, was recalcitrant to high level expression and poorly immunogenic, polyclonal antibody specific to this protein was generated and used to confirm expression during infection. sgRNA transcripts is similar to viral [47] and eukaryotic [48] dicistronic mRNAs. alternative weak context initiating codons around an initiating codon in a strong context can be accessed by random forwards and backwards movements of the ribosome from its initial binding site. this would require a backwards movement to the second AUG triplet of ORF2. a broader analysis of the available human norovirus sequences confirms that no such ORF exists. the presence of this alternative ORF indicates a potential conserved mechanism for maximizing coding potential. a common ancestor of all caliciviruses possessed an equivalent ORF, which has subsequently been lost in the case of the majority of caliciviruses. a series of VF1 truncations, generated by inserting stop codons into ORF4, confirmed this protein was a classical viral accessory protein not required for replication. however, repetitive multicycle, low multiplicity of infection passage in the permissive RAW264.7 cell line resulted in a phenotypic reversion for the more severe truncations. analysis of VP1 protein levels produced during infection is clearly reduced at the later stages of infection in the absence of VF1. this does not appear to affect the final yield of virus or levels of viral RNA produced during replication in RAW264.7 cells. the total pool of available VP1 protein in the infected cells later in infection does not limit virion production. the role of STAT1 mediated, interferon-based, innate immune signaling in combating MNV-1 infection has been well characterized to prevent the progression of MNV-1 infection. we also observed this effect in our studies with immunocompetent C56BL/6 mice as only low levels of viral RNA were detected in the MLN. inhibition or degradation of IRF-3 is a frequent target of viral evasion strategies among both RNA and DNA viruses. mitochondrial import protein Tom70 interacts with MAVS upon RNA virus infection and subsequently recruits the TBK1-IRF3 complex via Hsp90 [59] another possible mechanism of VF1 function may be via the modification of mitochondrial activation pathway or the formation of the MAVS-Tom70-Hsp90 complex. RNA in the mesenteric lymph node at 5 and 7 days post infection with a virus lacking VF1 was first engineered into the virulent MNV-1 backbone. this virus, which represents the closest available progenitor of the original isolate of MNV identified in 2003, causes a lethal infection in STAT1-/- mice. in immunocompetent mice a deletion of NS1 results in attenuation. the exact mechanism of this attenuation is unclear since all the inoculated animals (M1-v or WT-v) eventually developed disease and either succumbed to infection or had to be euthanized due to the established humane end points being surpassed. in STAT1-/- mice, the absence of an intact STAT1-dependent interferon response pathway prevents the generation of robust autocrine and paracrine interferon responses. infection with the virus lacking VF1 leads to the induction of subset of ISGs during virus replication at the primary site of infection, either directly via an unknown mechanism, or via STAT2. this limited response may slow virus replication, resulting in the delayed virus replication at the initial site of infection, reduced virus production and delayed onset of disease, all consistent with our observations. PB1-F2 is a recently discovered virulence factor, encoded by the PB1 gene segment. it interacts with mitochondria and stimulates apoptosis by facilitating cytochrome c release via interactions with ANT3 and VDAC1. despite the mitochondrial interactions of PB1-F2, it is unlikely that VF1 functions in an analogous manner since apoptosis was exacerbated in cells infected with a virus lacking VF VF1 expression and function confer some benefit to MNV growth in this cell line. this benefit is the likely combination of the observed increase in apoptosis and innate immune signalling observed in cells infected with a virus lacking the VF1 protein. other examples of viral proteins that interact with the mitochondria during infection include the HBV X gene protein which is thought to stimulate apoptosis. a mutant virus lacking the ability to express VF1 does not replicate as efficiently in immuncompetent or STAT1-/- mice. this manifests as a delayed onset in the development of disease. this does not protect the mice from developing serious disease. NV-1 was propagated in the murine leukaemia macrophage cell line RAW264.7 using Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml) and 10 mM HEPES (pH7.6) cells were cultured in DMEM (with FCS and pen/step as above) antisera to the MNV-1 VP2 protein was generated by immunization of rabbits with full-length recombinant his-tagged protein expressed and purified from E.coli. some batch-to-batch variation of the antisera was observed resulting in minor differences in the staining intensity of background non-specific bands. Synonymous and amino acid variability for each ORF coding sequence were calculated using the program Sequence distance in the Simmonic sequence editor. Variability at each position was averaged over 11 adjacent windows of 50 codons incrementing by 3 bases/window. VF1 and PCBP were detected using secondary HRPO conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. aIF was detected using a secondary HRPO conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody. mutations were generated in the previously described MNV-1 cDNA clone pT7:MNV 3\u2019Rz [22] using KOD hot start DNA polymerase (Novagen) 24 h post transfection cells were frozen and the clarified lysates were used to generate passage 1 and 2 stocks by infecting RAW264.7 cells at low MOI and freezing 48 hours post infection. the virulent virus underwent only a single pass in tissue culture to prevent the appearance of the tissue culture adapted mutations. the resulting \u2018pass 1\u2019 cultures were freeze-thawed and used to set up the subsequent low MOI (0.01 TCID50 per cell) infections. after 48 h the resulting \u2018pass 1\u2019 cultures were freeze-thawed and used to set up the subsequent low MOI (0.01 TCID50 per cell) infections. control mice (a group of 6) were inoculated with non-infected cell lysates prepared in an identical manner to the virus stocks. mice were sourced from Taconic (STAT1 -/-) or Harlan (C57BL/6) and verified as MNV free at the beginning of the study. at various times post infection tissue samples were taken post mortem. qPCR reactions were prepared using the MESA Blue qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR Assay (Eurogentech) cDNA was mixed with 2X buffer and primers IC464 and IC465 (TGGACAACGTGGTGAAGGAT) before activation by incubation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. cDNA was then subjected to 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C, 15 sec; 58\u00b0C, 30 sec; 72\u00b0C, 30 sec RT enzyme (Promega) was performed using an oligo dT primer. qPCR was performed using an ABI 7900 HT real time PCR machine. the MESA Blue (Eurogentec) SYBR master mix was combined with sample cDNAs. RAW264.7 cells were seeded at 5105 cells per well of a 24-well plate and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C. cells were infected with an MOI of 5 TCID50 per cell or treated with 5 M staurosporine (Sigma) cells were PBS washed and lysed in 1 ml of 1 x cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) the protocol was approved by the IACUC at UT Southwestern Medical Center (Permit number: 1151) animal use adhered to applicable requirements such as the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), the Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals (Guide), the Public Health Service Policy, and the U.S. Government Principles Regarding the Care and Use of Animals. a combination of peptide immunization followed by booster injections with various recombinant proteins was required. animals were immunized with the peptide (PGKLTKLTPGSSKIL) representing amino acids 42\u201356 of VF1 conjugated to KLH, then boosted with the same peptide. one booster injection with amino acids 42\u201370 fused to a cherry/his tag (Cherry-VF1-his) was also performed. homogeneous and amino acid variability for each ORF coding sequence were calculated using the program Sequence distance in the Simmonic sequence editor as previously described [13]. mitochondria and cytosol of infected cells were separated using mitochondria isolation kit. the isolated mitochondria were directly suspended into reducing SDS sample buffer. the cytosolic fraction was concentrated using the UPPA-protein concentration reagent (G-Biosciences) the VF1 expression plasmid pcDNA3.1+MNV-1 VF1 was generated by cloning the VF1 encoding sequence into the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1+. pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) reverse genetics recovery of ORF4 mutant viruses was recovered using reverse genetics as previously described. the assay was performed in triplicate for each virus. at given time points (0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours post-infection) the infections were frozen and upon thawing the viral titers were determined by TCID50. proteins over the given time course were also taken to analyze the kinetics of viral protein expression. pRLTK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid was added to each transfection. samples were lysed 24 hours post transfection in passive lysis buffer. activity measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system. q-RT-PCR quantification of viral load Tissue samples was stored in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) or RNa Later (Ambion) and after homogenization RNA was extracted according to manufacturer instructions. aliquot of total RNA from each tissue sample was used for reverse transcription using a primer specific for the genomic RNA of MNV-1. equivalent protocol was used to determine genome copy number in RNA samples. analysis of mRNA levels in infected RAW264.7 cells was performed at low MOI (0.1 TCID50 units/cell) cells were seeded at 2105 cells per well in a 24 well dish. RNA was harvested from infected cells at 16, 20 and 24 hours post infection. polyIC was added directly to the media at a final concentration of 25 g/ml. RNA was harvested at 24 hours post addition and analysed by qPCR. analysis of IFN-Beta protein levels was performed using a murine IFN-B specific ELISA. on ice for 20 minutes using a UV-crosslinker at 254 nm (Stratagene) mock treated stocks were used as controls and were simply kept on ice for the same period of time prior to dilution. levels of cleaved caspase 3 were compared by western blot analysis using antibodies from Cell Signalling Technology. gavage with 10,000 TCID50 of low passage, sequence verified, wild-type (WT-v) or VF1 knockout (M1-v) viruses generated using a virulent backbone cDNA construct. the error bars represent the mean and standard error for each group. the identity and weight loss of the animals is also illustrated in Figure 7. TCID-50 of MNV-1 (CW1.P1) at 3 days post infection. mRNAs were calculated for each tissue separately. this analysis was performed using the Ct qPCR method with the cellular gene HPRT used as an endogenous control."}
