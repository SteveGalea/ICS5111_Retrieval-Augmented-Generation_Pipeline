{"summary": "primary health care, and in particular, general practice, will be at the frontline in the response to pandemic influenza. there are no frameworks to guide systematic planning for this task or to appraise available plans for their relevance to general practice. we used the framework to analyse 89 publicly-available jurisdictional plans at similar managerial levels in the five countries. since September 2001, the US government has invested about $5 billion to upgrade preparedness plans for emergency management systems [5], [6] there are three challenges for pandemic planning by general practice. the way in which ambulatory health services will interact with each other and with the wider health system response to a pandemic is unclear. the matrix consists of a grid of columns of four factors (human, agent, and physical and organisational environment) impacting upon the event [15]. the framework can be readily shared with public health units and other parts of the health system. it identifies general practice contributions to primary health care services and to public health surveillance and control. eight general practice policy leaders were identified by representative organisations. we held two workshops, attended by representatives of state and territory health services, Commonwealth policymakers, non-government organisations and general practice organisations. we conducted four desktop exercises attended by 25 GPs, 11 practice nurses and 10 administrative staff. s 84 provincial regional health authorities (RHAS, 14 plans identified) and Ontario's 36 public health units (26 plans identified) and 14 Local Health Integration Networks (no pandemic plans identified) all plans were examined by two clinicians, and searched for terms: primary care, primary health, ambulatory, general practice, general practitioner, GP, family practice, family physician. a team with expertise in social science, public health and general practice reviewed objectives and strategies in WHO guidelines for preparing and responding to a pandemic. a search of the peer-reviewed literature through PubMed using the terms \u2018general practice\u2019, \u2018family physician\u2019, \u2018family medicine\u2019 and various combinations of the terms \u2018influenza\u2019, \u2018epidemic\u2019, \u2018preparedness\u2019 and \u2018pandemic\u2019 yielded 24 eligible papers. four desktop exercises attended by 25 GPs, 11 practice nurses and 10 administrative staff. plan was at the level of administrative decentralisation where decisions are made. in practice, this level was the state or provincial health departments in Federal systems. the roles of general practice/family practice in the plans were assessed across the four domains of general practice identified in the first part of this project. no attempt was made to quantify the extent of coverage of general practice in the plans as this rarely extended beyond a few sentences. practice Integrated planning across the health system, e.g. with other general practices and ambulatory care services, public health units and hospitals. the framework identifies four domains of practice: clinical services, public health responsibilities of general practice, internal (physical and organisational environment of the general practice unit, and the macro-environment of general practice. the domain covered most frequently was influenza-related clinical care (in all plans from England and Canada) less than half the plans mentioned non-influenza clinical care, with the exception being England, where 90% of PCT plans mentioned non-influenza clinical care. clinical care essential planning elements This domain includes two sets of clinical care needs. the first includes care for the surge in patients with acute respiratory illness and for people at high risk of exposure to, or complications from, influenza. the second need is for non-influenza-related care. most plans were sketchy on systems to maintain non-influenza-related clinical care. the main non-influenza clinical area was mental health care. the main non-influenza clinical area was mental health care. the main non-influenza clinical area was mental health care. the role of general practice in contact tracing, in monitoring people in home isolation, and in distributing antiviral drugs is unclear in most plans. only 22% of PCT plans and 40% of US plans mention a role for primary care in dispensing antiviral medications. plans should include leadership delegations, staffing contingencies, safe and flexible working hours and family care plans for staff. criteria for considering clinic closure, recruiting and training ancillary staff, early psycho-social support, support for making difficult clinical decisions, record keeping to ensure accountability for actions and 'inactions' a plan that adopts the \u2018all-hazards approach\u2019 integrates roles, responsibilities and actions for acute clinical care, public health, and emergency management systems. this calls for coordination across general practices and other ambulatory care services to ensure primary health care needs within the community are effectively monitored and addressed. the links between the PCT and the PHO are purely voluntary. the absence of plans for networking between general practice and public health is most marked in the USA. the absence of plans for networking between general practice and public health is most marked in the USA. no country's plan included an inventory of legislation that might need to be amended. one regional health authority plan provided an outline of specific issues likely to affect physicians. there appear to be no ancillary plans addressing principles of altered funding for private physicians in a pandemic. only 41% of plans from the USA addressed clinical care for influenza by primary care practitioners. every US plan included guidelines on influenza management by hospital physicians. some plans articulated a surge in demand for influenza care as a threat to general practice's survival. in the recovery phase, the clinical needs of patients are for psychological care and chronic illness management. if the pandemic occurs in waves, as in 1918\u201319, recovery activities may need to be tempered by preparations for the next wave. coverage of the needs of vulnerable populations was most detailed in plans from Canada and England. GPs and private specialists are currently central to surveillance activities. GPs and private specialists are currently central to surveillance activities. only 22% of PCT plans and 40% of US plans mention a role for primary care in dispensing antiviral medications. the only plan to set out contingencies when decisions about dispensing may change was one Canadian RHA plan. home care by GPs for people in quarantine is mentioned in two US Plans [50], [51], and one English plan [36], though the recently released guidelines for PCTs anticipate a role for general practices in home care [52]. only 22% of PCT plans and 40% of US plans mention a role for primary care in dispensing antiviral medications. plans should include leadership delegations, staffing contingencies, safe and flexible working hours and family care plans for staff. criteria for considering clinic closure, recruiting and training ancillary staff, early psycho-social support, early psycho-social support, and early psycho-social support. tools [54], [55] and desktop simulation exercises [19] are available to help GPs plan for continuity. practice needs to develop strategies to maintain reliable and efficient access to essential drugs and equipment and influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. it also needs to strengthen the capacity of its communication technologies with patients and the broader health system, including telephones, faxes, internet, work-from-home technologies for staff. the health system requires a plan that adopts the \u2018all-hazards approach\u2019 and integrates roles, responsibilities and actions for acute clinical care, public health, and emergency management systems. this calls for coordination across general practices and other ambulatory care services to ensure primary health care needs within the community are effectively monitored and addressed. GPs funded through a capitated system may have more freedom to alter their practice to provide different service mixes. in the post-event phase, patients and GPs may require support for psychological recovery. the UK has recently released an ethical framework for policy and planning, though this has not yet been incorporated into planning documents. the regulatory framework most mentioned was in relation to credentialing for retired GPs and other volunteers [33], [64], [65], and less frequently, indemnity [36]. only one plan [66] canvas the potential of recompense for financial loss to a general practice. england's PCTs and new Zealand's primary health organisations represent two ways of linking general practices under the governance of regional boards. the links between the PCT or the PHO and general practices are purely voluntary. in the united states, managed care systems function as another way of linking ambulatory and hospital services. the absence of plans for networking between general practice and public health is most marked in the USA. the absence of plans for networking between general practice and public health is most marked in the USA. the absence of plans for networking between general practice and public health is most marked in the USA. the framework provides clarity of purpose and a structure to guide planning through four functional domains. the domains have been structured as integral components of a complex system that can respond to uncertainty [68] and be adapted for a given local setting and health system context. two countries adjusted their plans after simulation exercises, exercise Cumpston in australia and winter Willow in the UK. the former identified specific weaknesses in the involvement of the primary health care sector and made recommendations to better integrate primary health care providers into planning at the national and jurisdictional levels. the challenges will be neither static over time, nor uniform across general practices. responses will have to be modified in the context of the general practice setting as the pandemic evolves. the conceptual framework we developed can be used by primary health care services in developing countries to deconstruct the multi-dimensional challenges posed by pandemic influenza. many poor countries already have a health crisis, and need massive international investments, including mobilization and strengthening of human resources. primary health care in developing countries will need resources to develop a suite of policies, including: clarification of what essential primary health care will continue through a pandemic. developing health workforce plans may entail diverting clinicians from other areas of the health workforce, establishing non-hierarchical links between primary health care, hospitals and public health. the willing general practitioner sector is an essential resource for extending the surge capacity of health departments. the role of general practice in contact tracing, monitoring and treating people in home isolation or quarantine, dispensing antiviral drugs and participating in mass vaccinations needs to be clarified. there is a dispute between utilitarian philosophical approaches used in public health and deontological or virtue ethical approaches used in clinical medicine. there is a need for some preparatory work with general practitioners clarifying ethics of clinical behaviour, restriction of liberty under quarantine orders, and resource allocation and distribution. in an established pandemic, it is likely that there will be shortfalls in the GP workforce. ambulatory care services often lack the appropriate organisational structure and mandate. health departments must emphasise the critical need for all levels of the health system to integrate the general practice sector in the planning process. good planning must focus on the planning process rather than the production of a written document [76] the guidelines for PCTs are an example of such an approach. they could act as a useful point of departure for planning integrated general practice plans by other health systems. a web presence comparing exemplary approaches from different health systems would be a useful resource for planners. health departments should modify or adopt legislation and financing mechanisms to enable general practice to function optimally during the pandemic. a coherent approach would enable multi-actor accountability and more efficient, contextual planning by jurisdictions. a web presence comparing exemplary approaches from different health systems would be a useful resource for planners. the plans in the five countries provide more detail on the public health dimension of the pandemic. there are intercountry differences in the emphases provided to different domains of the general practice response. there is an urgent need to incorporate general practice and the broader primary care sector into pandemic planning activities."}
