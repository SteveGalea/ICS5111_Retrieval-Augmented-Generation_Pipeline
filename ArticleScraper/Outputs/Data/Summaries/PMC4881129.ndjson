{"summary": "ASDs include classical autism, asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise Specified. a number of environmental factors are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of ASDs, including nutritional factors and hormones. inappropriate child rearing, such as child abuse and malnutrition by parents with psychiatric problems, can be associated with ASDs. mutations have been identified in chromatin-remodeling factors such as histone modifying enzymes and chromodomain helicases in congenital ASDs. these findings suggest that ASDs can be recognized as a \u201csynaptic and chromatin-remodeling disorders\u201d [25,28]. iPSC-derived neurons exhibit maturation and electro-physiological defects reminiscent of those seen in mouse models. astrocyte-specific genes are aberrantly expressed in neural cells generated from iPSC lines that lack MeCP2 expression, which leads to the de-suppression of astrocyte-specific genes. genomic imprinting error causes Prader-Willi syndrome. endocrine disrupting chemicals, hyponutrition, and mental stress are known to alter epigenetic status, resulting in aberrant gene expression. increased dosage of Mecp2 protein (i.e., due to mutations of MECP2) results in severe mental retardation in males. a recent study has shown an ICF-specific DNA hypomethylation pattern in mesenchymal stem cells differentiated from the iPSCs of ICF patients [60]. the precise molecular mechanism for the immune dysregulation is still largely unknown. mutations in a gene encoding another DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3A, cause intellectual disability with overgrowth. iparental disomy causes angelman syndrome because the causative gene, ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A), is maternally expressed. increased copy number (i.e., duplication or triplication) of the maternal 15q11-q13 region that leads to UBE3A overexpression causes an ASD. perinatal BPA exposure via maternal diet decreases global DNA methylation in bone marrow-derived mast cells of the offspring during adulthood. altered DNA methylation patterns in AHRR, MYO1G, CYP1A1 and CNTNAP2 caused by maternal tobacco smoking detected in cord blood were confirmed in their children at 17 years of age. ed maternal diet decreases DNA methylation and induces the over-expression of energy storage-associated genes (e.g., PPAR) in fetal liver to generate a \u201cthrifty phenotype\u201d once an individual is born with a thrifty phenotype in modern society with an abundance of food. nutritional mismatch between prenatal and postnatal conditions induces metabolic and mental disorders. environmental factors such as EDCs and nutrition do not promote genetic mutations but instead promote epigenetic changes. environmental stress results in epigenetic changes at some loci in the genome. environmental stress results in epigenetic changes at some loci in the genome. the effects must be observed in the F3 generation to be considered transgenerational. the in utero nature of the ancestral perturbation affects not only the somatic and germ cells of the developing F1 fetus, but also the germ cells of the F2 generation. inheritance is not \u201csolid\u201d inheritance but \u201csoft\u201d inheritance because epigenetics is a reversible mechanism based on the addition and removal of chemical residues on DNA and histone proteins. some psychotropic drugs, such as imipramine for depressive disorders, can restore altered histone modifications and gene expression."}
