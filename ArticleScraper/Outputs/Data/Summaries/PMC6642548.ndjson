{"summary": "different respiratory etiological agents may induce similar clinical signs that make differential diagnosis difficult. oligonucleotide microarray system was developed. three probes specific for AIV, NDV, and IBV were simultaneously detected. oligonucleotide microarray is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viral diseases. the microarray is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viral diseases."}
