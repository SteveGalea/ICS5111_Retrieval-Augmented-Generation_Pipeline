{"summary": "viruses have already been recognized as important etiologies of respiratory infections with influenza virus which is considered the main contributor. most of the world, including Indonesia, have developed influenza surveillance, influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance, and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) this network improves influenza disease control by providing support on influenza vaccine recommendation. there are limited studies on viral pathogens of respiratory tract infection in low-middle income countries including Indonesia. there are limited studies on viral pathogens of respiratory tract infection in low-middle income countries including Indonesia. cleic acid was extracted from 190 l of viral transport medium using RiboSpin v_RD GeneAll extraction Kit from Seegene (seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea) a 10 l internal control was added to each of the 190 l samples for internal amplification control. 40 l elution buffer was added according to manufacturer instructions. the melting curve temperature from 55\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C (5 s/0, 5\u00b0C) was used to read the amplification. any positive result was detected as a peak in electropherogram. PCR Total viral nucleic acid was extracted from 190 l of viral transport medium using RiboSpin v_RD GeneAll extraction kit. a 10 l internal control which is inserted in the package was added to each of the 190 l samples for internal amplification control. 40 l elution buffer was added according to manufacturer instructions. aling at 60\u00b0C for 60 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and a final extension step at 55\u00b0C for 30 s. any positive result was detected as a peak in electropherogram, compared to positive control. paired tests were used to compare between single and multiple infection. influenza virus is the most detected virus (36.1%), followed by human rhinovirus and human adenovirus. previous results in hospitalized suspected influenza patients in Indonesia demonstrated similar results as influenza is the most detected virus. the prevalence of viruses is assumed to be associated with the age of patients. influenza was the most prevalent viral infection under-one-year-old group and above-five-year-old group. the prevalence of adenovirus and RSV A infections increased with age. Indonesia has five major islands with Java Island as the main island. the total number of influenza-like illness cases in the first quarter of the year was greater than the rest of the year, as shown in Table 3. findings may be limited to patients at private clinics or those who do not seek healthcare. findings may be limited to patients at private clinics or those who do not seek healthcare."}
