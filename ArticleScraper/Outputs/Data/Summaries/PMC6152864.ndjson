{"summary": "the importation of one-day-old broiler chicks into the Galapagos increased by 115% from 143,000 chicks in 2005 to 308,500 chicks in 2016. the average duration of the production cycle is six weeks, when broilers reach a body weight of about 2.7 kg (6 lb) in 2001\u20132003, a study conducted on San Cristobal Island produced evidence of prior exposure to several pathogens in 72 broilers. the burden of previous exposure to these four pathogens varied from 3% to 73%. in both studies, indirect contact with infected backyard chickens or vaccination (although illegal) were suspected as potential risk factors. broilers were introduced on 13 farms on Santa Cruz Island and San Cristobal Island, Galapagos in 2017. the source of broilers was one-day-old chicks supplied by four commercial chicken egg hatcheries in Guayaquil, Ecuador. local authorities do not approve the use of poultry vaccines because poultry are not native island species. the average production cycle is six weeks, when broiler chicken body weight reaches about 2.7 kg. the average production cycle is six weeks, when broiler body weight reaches about 2.7 kg. study farms had two or more poultry pens with broilers of different age groups. poultry pens were not 100% rodent- or native bird-proof. samples were classified as seropositive or seronegative to each pathogen of interest using antibody concentration cut-off points (i.e., IBVD S/P ratio = 0.50; IBV S/P ratio = 0.20; MG S/P ratio = 0.20); relative specificity of the four tests = 100% in 10, 8, 11, and 30 experimentally vaccinated chickens. the proportions of broilers classified as positive to antibody titers to IBDV, IBD, NDV, or MG were calculated by dividing the number of tested broilers to each pathogen of interest. the source of broilers was one-day-old chicks supplied by four commercial chicken egg hatcheries in Guayaquil, Ecuador. local authorities do not approve the use of poultry vaccines because poultry are not native island species. broilers are fed using commercial diets and tap water. the average production cycle is six weeks, when broiler body weight reaches about 2.7 kg. study farms had two or more poultry pens with broilers of different age groups. poultry pens were not 100% rodent- or native bird-proof. backyard poultry were present within farm property limits. the relative sensitivity of the four tests = 100% in 10, 8, 11, and 30 experimentally vaccinated chickens. the relative specificity of the four tests = 100% in 45, 45, 31, and 30 specific pathogen free chickens. ninety-five percent confident intervals (95% CI) were calculated for each proportion. pens on each farm had broilers of different age groups. median mortality (%) per cycle on study farms was 1.5% on Santa Cruz. the frequency of broilers with positive antibody titers to IBDV was 26/60 or 43% on Santa Cruz and 48/70 = 69% (57, 78%) on San Cristobal. one of six farms on Santa Cruz had one broiler classified as seropositive to NDV. 0.01, 0.11) 0.009 (0.00, 0.27) D 10 Positive 8 7 1 0 S/P ratio 0.27 (0.05, 0.89) 0.25 (0.05, 2.17) 0.03 (0.00, 0.26) 0.01 (0.20, 0.83) 0.57 (0.14, 4.07) 0.07 (0.03, 0.13) 0.05 (0.02, 0.22) Positive 2 0 0 0 S/P ratio 0.13 (0.06, 0.24) 0.00 (0.00, 0.03) positive 10 0 0 0 S/P ratio 0.39 (0.22, 0.65) 0.05 (0.03, 0.59) 0.01 (0.00, 0.45) 0.02 (0.00, 0.07) Total 70 Positive 48 (56.9%) 5 (7.1%) 0 0 ALL 130 positive 74 (56.9%) 27 (20.7%) 1 (0.7%) 0 1Positive: number of broilers that tested positive to antibodies against IBDV, IBV, NDV, or MG spp Eimeria spp Eimeria spp I Eimeria spp Eimeria spp Eimeria spp Eimeria spp J NPO NPO NPO NPO K Eimeria spp Eimeria spp M Eimeria spp Eimeria spp Eimeria spp Eimeria spp Eimeria spp. three of six farms on Santa Cruz and one of seven farms on San Cristobal had 1 broilers with positive antibody titers against IBDV. a limitation in this study was that backyard chickens were not investigated. the same study investigated exposure to IBDV and other pathogens in 236 wild birds. all birds were classified as seronegative to pathogens tested including IBDV, NDV, and MG. one limitation was that serological testing in wild birds required pooling of samples. exposure to a field strain of NDV explained positive antibody titers detected in backyard chickens. vaccine titers or exposure to a field viral strain explained observed exposure to NDV in broilers. one explanation can be that study broilers were not exposed to this pathogen via (i) vertical transmission or (ii) indirect transmission between infected backyard chickens and susceptible broilers. eria spp. infection in poultry is not a health hazard to Galapagos wild birds due to the parasite high host specificity. one potential source is indirect transmission between infected backyard chickens (e.g., via farm personnel or use of equipment contaminated with Eimeria spp.) the effects of Eimeria spp. infection on poultry include decreased body weight gain, decreased feed efficiency, and increased maintenance energy costs [9,10]. pathogenic Eimeria spp. have the potential to move quickly through a poultry pen and kill a large number of birds [12]. this is the first study that has produced evidence of exposure to Eimeria spp. in broilers on the Galapagos. pagos\u2019 policymakers can consider implementing a certification program (e.g., Green List, Red List) that requires poultry products to come from broiler chicken farms that follow Best Management Practices. for example: use of health records to monitor morbidity and mortality events in broilers; (ii) use of written biosecurity protocols; (iii) use of peripheral fence to keep backyard chickens or other animals out; (iii) poultry pens protected against rodents or native birds; poultry farmers are expected to deliver chilled or frozen chicken meat once or twice every week. the local business environment justifies the implementation of enhanced surveillance and biosecurity measures identified above."}
