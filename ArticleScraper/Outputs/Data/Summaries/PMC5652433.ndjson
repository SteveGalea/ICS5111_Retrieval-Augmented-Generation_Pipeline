{"summary": "the NIS, a stratified 20% sample of discharges from nonfederal US hospitals, contains data from 47 states. we mapped the hospitals in these 26 states to the AHA-reported addresses using the AHA ID. we then converted the addresses to geographic coordinates by using the US Census Bureau Geocoder. the primary diagnosis in the NIS is the condition chiefly responsible for the hospital admission (20). the authors reported high sensitivity (83.5%) and specificity (99.9%), a positive predictive value of 88.0%, a negative predictive value of 99.8%, and agreement between the estimated cases observed in the NIS for 2012 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. average temperatures computed using only the nearest station were highly correlated with the average temperature using a 62-mile radius. we modeled whether a hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia had a diagnosis of LD on the basis of patient age, patient sex, payer, patient race, admission month, admission year, hospital latitude, total monthly rainfall, mean relative humidity, mean temperature, and an interaction between temperature and relative humidity. the squared hospital latitude was included to enable the effect of latitude to be nonlinear. we computed the fitted values from this model using location and weather information and set the demographic variables to their individual modal values for cases of bacterial pneumonia observed in the data. we identified LD cases as hospitalizations of persons with a primary diagnosis code of 482.84 (pneumonia due to Legionnaires\u2019 disease) the primary diagnosis in the NIS is the condition chiefly responsible for the hospital admission (20). the authors reported high sensitivity (83.5%) and specificity (99.9%), a negative predictive value of 99.8%. we excluded records for persons 18 years of age and records that omitted any variables of interest: age, sex, payer, race, admission month and year, and hospital location. we also required the hospital to have >1 weather station within 100 km (62 miles) values of absolute humidity were extremely correlated with temperature (r = 0.85), whereas the correlation was much lower with relative humidity (r = 0.23) the correlation of temperature with relative humidity is negative because relative humidity is often much higher at cold temperatures. the most common reasons for exclusion were lack of the AHA ID, admission month and year, and race. the most common reasons for exclusion were lack of the AHA ID, admission month and year, and race. the large sample size (retained sample n = 189,412) meant many non\u2013clinically relevant differences would be statistically significant. the analysis comprised data from 26 states: Arizona, Arkansas, California, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin. we found a large unadjusted difference in the mean monthly environmental temperatures between cases (58.5\u00b0F) and controls (52.6\u00b0F), and monthly environmental relative humidity was higher on average for cases (70.0%) than for controls (61.7 mm). also, there was nearly 20 mm more rain for cases (80.4 mm) than for controls (61.7 mm). variables of interest\u2014mean temperature, mean relative humidity, and their interaction\u2014were all significant (likelihood ratio test against model with only main effects, 2 test statistic = 350.42; p0.0001). effects of humidity and humidity on Legionnaires\u2019 disease risk were still significant. \u00b0F 60 1.00 Ref 60\u201380 0.55 0.44\u20130.68 >80 1.57 1.24\u20131.98 Mean RH, % 0\u201350.0 1.00 Ref 50.1\u201355.0 0.85 0.68\u20131.06 55.1\u201360.0 0.58 0.48\u20130.70 60.1\u201365.0 0.66 0.56\u20130.78 65.1\u201370.0 0.79 0.67\u20130.93 70.1\u201375.0 0.80 0.68\u20130.94 75.1\u201380.0 0.76 0.64\u20130.9 dash indicates 95% CIs not defined because there were no data for cases or controls in that particular strata. the combination of temperature and humidity main effects and interactions can make understanding the combined effect difficult. we separately reported the estimated composite odds ratios for each combination. estimated probability of Legionnaires\u2019 disease given bacterial pneumonia in a 61\u201370-year-old white man on Medicare located at 42\u00b0N, admitted to a hospital in April 2011*. the predicted values for other months (e.g., July or December) will differ. percentages were relatively high in the Northeast and somewhat lower in the Midwest and South. the frequencies in the west were the lowest of all 4 regions. the exact cause is unknown but is thought to be related to increased vigilance, testing, and reporting of atypical pneumonia after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (24). the predicted risk is for a 61\u201370-year-old white man on Medicare (the most common patient in the pooled case\u2013control sample) by location in the united states for each month in 2011. the predicted risk is for a 61\u201370-year-old white man on Medicare (the most common patient in the pooled case\u2013control sample) by location in the united states for each month in 2011. previous work has demonstrated seasonality and the effects of weather patterns on LD. however, much of this work was based on regional investigations where LD is common. regional investigations are limited in their ability to more fully describe the relationship between weather patterns and LD incidence. CAP guidelines recommend empiric therapy routinely covering atypical pneumonias. results of a recent noninferiority trial suggest monotherapy with a -lactam, aggressive diagnostic testing, and use of clinical judgment may safely avert the use of fluoroquinolones or dual therapy with a macrolide in patients with CAP (10). future work will need to determine under which conditions and in which patients initial monotherapy with a -lactam will not be inferior to combination therapy. future work needs to consider and incorporate diagnostic testing for LD and the patient\u2019s clinical status (e.g., intensive care unit admission). our analysis did not contain possibly important geographic differences (e.g., use of monochloramine in municipal water) the experience of warm and humid weather patterns common during summer may have driven the current view about the frequency of LD in the united states."}
