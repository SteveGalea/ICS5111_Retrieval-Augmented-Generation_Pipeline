{"summary": "eukaryotes encode endonucleases but are generally restricted to a highly specific set of targets. mRNAs containing premature stop codons are cleaved by the Smg6 endonuclease during the translation-linked quality control process of nonsense mediated decay (NMD) studies with the SOX homolog from murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) indicate that SOX activity helps fine tune viral mRNA levels in a manner important for the in vivo viral lifecycle. a recent degradome-based sequencing analysis together with studies on individual endogenous and reporter mRNAs revealed that SOX cleavage sites are defined by a degenerate RNA motif. dominant escape involves a specific RNA element whose presence in the 3\u2019 UTR protects against SOX cleavage. the IL-6 mRNA is directly refractory to SOX cleavage and thus remains robustly induced during host shutoff due to the presence of a specific \u2018SOX resistance element\u2019 (SRE) the IL-6 SRE is broadly protective against a diverse group of viral endonucleases. it is not indiscriminately protective, however, as host quality control endonucleases are not blocked by the IL-6 SRE. this suggests a diversity of nuclease escape elements exist, and that their characterization may lead to new insights into the control of mRNA fate. mRNA was readily degraded in 293T cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing each of the viral endonucleases. addition of the IL-6 derived SRE to the 3\u2019 UTR of GFP (GFP-IL-6-SRE) prevented each of the viral endonucleases from degrading this mRNA. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated MS2 reporters. 24h later, cells were fixed and processed for RNA FISH staining. the IL-6 derived SRE is unlikely to function through steric occlusion of a common cleavage site. the presence of the stem-loops did not prevent the escape of the SRE-containing reporter or degradation of the SRE reporter in SOX-expressing cells. the FISH signal was specific to transfected cells, as we observed no fluorescence in neighboring untransfected cells nor autofluorescence from transfected cells lacking the Cy3 probes. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated dsRed2 reporters. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure dsRed mRNA levels. the efficiency of SMG6 knockdown was measured by western blotting, with actin serving as a loading control. nsp1 is not itself a nuclease, but it binds the 40S ribosome. it causes it to stall on the mRNA, thus activating cleavage of the mRNA by an as yet unknown cellular endonuclease. this enabled evaluation of a distinct host endonuclease [48,48] a transcript that fit these criteria was growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (GADD45B) the mRNA was also previously shown to escape degradation in HSV-1 vhs-expressing cells, further suggesting it might contain an SRE [52\u201354] total RNA was extracted from unreactivated or reactivated KSHV-positive TREX-BCBL-1 (A) cells or iSLK.219 cells (B) and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure endogenous levels of the GADD45B or GAPDH transcript. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure GFP levels. co-transfection of the GFP-fused GADD45B 3\u2019 UTR construct with SOX into 293T cells did not lead to degradation of this mRNA. the GFP-GADD45B 5\u2019 UTR or CDS fusions were readily degraded in SOX-expressing cells. the last 200nt of the GADD45B 3\u2019UTR had the highest similarity (46%) to the IL-6 SRE. total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure GFP mRNA levels. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure GFP mRNA levels. the color scale represents the confidence score of the structure as calculated by RNAfold. results from the cleavage reaction largely confirmed the RNAfold predictions. we then tested whether this structure is required for either IL-6 SRE or G-SRE function by changing two conserved TT nucleotides to GG. both the SRE_GG and the SRE_CC mutations in the IL-6 or GADD45B fusions resulted in partial degradation of these mRNAs upon SOX expression in 293T cells. ChIRP-MS involves purifying an RNA of interest along with its associated proteins from crosslinked, sonicated cells using specific RNA probe-based capture. 195 proteins associated with the IL-6 3\u2019UTR and 245 proteins associated with the IL-6 3\u2019UTR were also recovered using ChIRP-MS for the IL-6 3\u2019 UTR. the fact that IGF2BP1 and NPM1 were recovered in the GADD45B and IL-6 ChIRP-MS experiments but not in the ChIRP-western blots likely reflects differences in sensitivity between MS and western blotting. the IL-6 and GADD45B SRE bind a partially overlapping set of cellular proteins. the interaction occurs on the GADD45B 3\u2019UTR by performing IPs from cells transfected with a GFP reporter fused to either the GADD45B 5\u2019 UTR or 3\u2019 UTR. the structurally compromised mutant GADD45B 3\u2019UTR_GG failed to interact with NCL and HuR, confirming that the stem-loop structure in the SRE is important for protein binding. depletion of HuR eliminated protective capacity of the G-SRE in SOX-expressing cells. depletion of NCL did not impair the protective effect of the G-SRE in SOX-expressing cells. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR. the IL-6 derived resistance element protects against cleavage by viral but not cellular endonucleases. the 3\u2019 UTR contains a transferrable 200 nt SRE that protects its associated mRNA from cleavage by viral but not cellular endonucleases. the IL-6 derived resistance element broadly protects against cleavage by viral but not cellular endonucleases. 293T cells were transfected with empty vector (mock) or a plasmid expressing the indicated endonucleases along with a GFP reporter. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected RT-qPCR to measure GFP mRNA levels. mRNA containing MS2 repeats upstream of the SRE or SRE fragment of the IL-6 3\u2019UTR. signals from the MS2 probes (red) and DAPI stained nuclei (blue) were detected by confocal microscopy. cleavage sites for IAV PA-X have yet to be determined. RNAs were present relatively diffusely throughout the cell. the FISH signal was specific to transfected cells. no fluorescence in neighboring untransfected cells nor autofluorescence from transfected cells lacking the Cy3 probes. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated dsRed2 reporters. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure dsRed mRNA levels. nsp1 is not itself a nuclease, but it binds the 40S ribosome and causes it to stall on the mRNA, thus activating cleavage of the mRNA by an as yet unknown cellular endonuclease. the IL-6 derived SRE confers broad protection against viral but not cellular endonucleases. TREX-BCBL1 and iSLK.219 cells harbor a dox-inducible version of the viral lytic transactivator RTA that promotes entry into the lytic cycle upon dox treatment. the endogenous GADD45B mRNA was not depleted upon transfection of KSHV SOX or HSV-1 vhs into 293T cells. 293T cells were transfected with an empty vector or a plasmid expressing SOX or vhs. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure GFP levels. recently, we showed that KSHV SOX cleaves its targets at a specific but degenerate RNA motif [21]. the GADD45B 3\u2019 UTR contains a protective sequence that prevents SOX cleavage of an established target mRNA. the last 200nt of the GADD45B 3\u2019UTR had the highest similarity (46%) to the IL-6 SRE. we fused this putative SRE segment of the GADD45B 3\u2019 UTR to GFP (GADD45B-SRE) 293T cells were transfected with the indicated GFP reporters mutated within IL-6 SRE at the residues marked by a * in (B) along with a control empty vector (mock) or a plasmid expressing SOX. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure GFP mRNA levels. mutated residues predicted to base pair with these nucleotides on the other side of the loop to CC (SRE_CC) both mutations resulted in partial degradation of these mRNAs upon SOX expression in 293T cells. this suggests that, at least for this region of each SRE, RNA structure rather than the specific sequence is important for protection against SOX cleavage. ChIRP-MS involves purifying an RNA of interest along with its associated proteins from crosslinked, sonicated cells using specific RNA probe-based capture. 195 proteins associated with the GADD45B 3\u2019UTR and 245 proteins associated with the IL-6 3\u2019UTR were also recovered using ChIRP-MS. 293T cells were transfected with either the GFP-GADD45B 5\u2019UTR, GFP-GADD45B 3\u2019UTR, or GFP-GADD45B 3\u2019UTR_GG reporter for 24 h. bars represent the fold enrichment over mock IP. the interaction occurs on the GADD45B 3\u2019UTR by performing the IPs from cells transfected with a GFP reporter fused to either the GADD45B 5\u2019 UTR or 3\u2019 UTR. the structurally compromised mutant GADD45B 3\u2019UTR_GG failed to interact with NCL and HuR, confirming that the stem-loop structure in the SRE is important for protein binding. 293T cells were treated with siRNAs targeting HuR (A, B) or control non targeting siRNAs. 48h later, cells were transfected with the GFP-GADD45B-3\u2019UTR reporter. total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure GFP mRNA levels. a 200 nt sequence present in the 3\u2019 UTR of the cellular IL-6 mRNA functions as a broad-acting, virus-specific endonuclease escape element. we hypothesize that these may therefore be representative members of a new type of RNA regulatory element engaged during viral endonuclease-triggered mRNA decay. the IL-6 and GADD45B derived nuclease escape elements exhibit a number of similarities. IL-6 is targeted by several cellular endonucleases including MCPIP1 [65\u201367], which has recently been reported to be inhibited during de novo KSHV infection [68]. this is in agreement with the fact that many of the SRE bound proteins have a breadth of roles in controlling RNA fate beyond conferring nuclease escape [60\u201364]. mRNA cleavage occurs at the site of the error or translation stall. we hypothesize that the SRE somehow occludes one or more factors required for recruitment of the viral endonucleases. this could occur via long-range interactions with mRNA cap-associated proteins. doxycycline-inducible version of the major lytic transactivator RTA [55] was maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 200 M L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 50 g/ml hygromycin B (Omega Scientific) 293T cells (ATCC) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. the KHSV-infected renal carcinoma cell line iSLK.219 bearing doxycycline-inducible RTA was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. the dsRed2 and dsRed2-PTC reporters were described elsewhere. the dsRed2 and dsRed2-PTC reporters were described previously. 293T cells were transfected with the GFP-GADD45B 3\u2019UTR plasmid. 24h later cells were crosslinked in 3% formaldehyde for 30 minutes. pellets were quenched in 125mM Glycine, washed with PBS and flash frozen. cDNAs were synthesized from 1 g of total RNA using a qPCR kit. signals obtained by qPCR were normalized to 18S. cDNAs were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes, quenched in 125mM glycine. beads containing fraction used for western blotting were resuspended in 30L lysis buffer. beads containing fraction used for RNA extraction were resuspended in proteinase K buffer (naCl 100mM, Tris pH 7.4 10mM, EDTA 1mM, SDS 0.5%) containing 1L of PK (Proteinase K) samples were incubated overnight at 65\u00b0C to reverse cross Statistical analysis All results are expressed as means S.E.M. of experiments independently repeated at least three times. unpaired Student's t test was used to evaluate statistical difference between samples. 293T cells were reverse transfected in 12-well plates by INTERFERin (Polyplus-Transfection) with 10 M of siRNAs. siRNAs were obtained from IDT as DsiRNA (siRNA SMG6: hs.Ri.SMG6.13.1; siRNA NCL: hs.Ri.NCL.13.1; siRNA HuR ELAVL1#1: hs.Ri.ELAVL1.13.3) 293T cells were transfected with an empty vector control or the MS2-SRE or MS2SRE constructs. 24h later, cells were washed, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 70% ethanol.
