{"summary": "levofloxacin (68.12%), ceftriaxone (37.7%), imipenem-cilastatin (32.5%), and azithromycin (20.6%) the most commonly used antibiotics were levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, imipenem-cilastatin, and imipenem-cilastatin. CAP is an important admission diagnosis with an annual rate of 664 patients in our hospital. guideline-based empiric antimicrobial therapy is recommended for the treatment of CAP by the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America. al Review Board calculated the CURB-65 score based on confusion, blood urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age > 65 years. the most frequently used antibiotics as single agents or combined with other antibiotics were levofloxacin (68.12%); ceftriaxone (37.7%), imipenem-cilastatin (37.7%), and azithromycin (20.6%) combination therapy of levofloxacin and imipenem-cilastatin was prescribed for 355 (68%) of non-ICU patients versus 20 (60.6%) of ICU patients (P = 0.0007) there was no relationship between antibiotic use and the CURB-65 score. there was no relationship between antibiotic use and the CURB-65 score. the overall guideline adherence rate for empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP was 31.2%\u201348% in one study from Europe in 2006[13] the compliance rate of empiric antibiotic use in CAP was very low in one study from Europe in 2006[13] and was 66% in a study from South Africa. levofloxacin was the most frequently used (65.7%), followed by ceftriaxone (16.1%) and moxifloxacin (13.1%). despite the existence of guidelines, the optimal use of antibiotics had not been achieved in CAP. a misclassified CAP diagnosis may explain some of the noncompliance to guidelines. there is a wide gap in guideline recommendations and actual usage pattern of antibiotics. there is a room for further antibiotic stewardship in the area of CAP."}
