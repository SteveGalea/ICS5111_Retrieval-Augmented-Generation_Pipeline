{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes acute lung injury (ALI) that progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the former mostnotably in the elderly. after viral clearance many SARS and H5N1 patients develop diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) that often progresses to pulmonary fibrosis, another devastating end stage lung disease. LP has deubiquitination, and interferon antagonist activities in vitro [15]. we have developed a yeast-based assay and screening method to identify small molecules that block SARS-CoV replication based on their inhibition of PLP. we screened a small molecule library for compounds that specifically reversed the PLP-induced slow growth phenotype. phenotype that could be used to screen for specific small molecule antagonists of NS1. we focused on the PLP protease domain of the viral nsp3 protein. the plasmid was transformed into a modified strain of S. cerevisiae. the plasmid was transformed into a modified strain of S. cerevisiae. blots were performed with protein extracted from HA tagged PLP expressing yeast grown in the presence of 2% galactose. protein was extracted and analyzed by anti-HA western blot. cell containing the PLP plasmid were induced with 2% galactose for 18 hours in the presence of 50 uM of each compound. expression of PLP was unaffected by four of the five compounds, however NSC158011 triggered a significant decrease in PLP expression. 104 cells were plated in 24 well plates and treated with 50 M of each compound for 2 hours prior to infection. at 2 hours after treatment, the medium was removed and the cells infected with a GFP expressing version of SARS-CoV(GFP) at an MOI of 1. Virus titer was assayed by plaque assay on veroE6 cells. hemagglutination assay showed a clear dose-dependent effect of NSC158362. the maximum effect on replication was greater than 500 fold. vero cells were infected at an MOI of 3 either 2 hours after NSC158362 was added or 6 hours before NSC158362 was added. RNA was extracted and viral replication was analysed by RT-PCR using primers specific for subgenomic transcripts. the addition of NSC158362 either prior to infection or 2 hours after infection can very efficiently inhibit virus RNA production. the basolateral surface is bathed in growth media similar to the architecture of lungs in vivo. HAE cells were treated with either DMSO or NSC158362. the apical surface of each culture was rinsed with P. BS at 24, 48 and 72 hr post infection and virus titered on veroE6 cells. a plasmid expressing a fusion protein of nsp2/3/GFP is cleaved into two polypeptides. western blotting for GFP reveals a size shift from the full length nsp2/3/GFP to the smaller nsp3/GFP fragment. in NSC158362 treated cells there was no effect on PLP-dependent protease function. this suggests that the inhibition of PLP protease function is not the mechanism of NSC158362's antiviral action. 293T cells were transfected with either nsp2/3/GFP alone or with HA tagged PLP. plasmids expressing PLP and Flag tagged ubiquitin were co-transfected into 293T cells. at 4 hours post transfection each compound was added at a concentration of 50 M. the cells were treated with each compound and transfected with only the Flag/Ub plasmid. a lack of ubiquitination signal was observed in each lane. there was no inhibition of PLP's DUB activity by any of the compounds identified including NSC158362. expression of PLP in cells blocks the IRF3 signaling pathway. cells were transfected with an IFN luciferase reporter plasmid for 18 hours. they were then treated with either DMSO or NSC158362 for 2 hours. this indicates that none of the compounds blocked PLP's IFN antagonism activity. sequences corresponding to the PLP domain were cloned into a plasmid containing the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter for controlled expression in S. cerevisiae. the plasmid was transformed into a modified strain of S. cerevisiae that carries disrupted alleles for two genes that control drug efflux, PDR1 and PDR3, thus allowing for the efficient retention of small molecules [16]. 2,000 compounds from the NIH Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) Diversity Set library (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/index.html) were screened manually. cell growth was monitored by optical density. cells were treated with each of the 5 compounds at 1, 50 and 100 M concentrations for 24 hours. no toxicity of any of the five compounds even at 100 M concentration in either of the cell lines. quots were analyzed by plaque assay on vero E6 cells. in control, DMSO treated cells, SARS-CoV grew to 5X107 by 12 hours post infection. of the five compounds tested, NSC158362 reduced the viral titer by 100 fold at 12 hours post infection and greater than 500 fold at 24 hours post infection. E. Vero cells were treated with either DMSO or NSC 158263. RNA was isolated at 12 hours post infection and analyzed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV specific transcripts and GAPDH. infected cells were treated with each of the five compounds at a concentration of 50 uM. they were then infected with influenza virus A/PR/8 at an MOI of 0.1 for 48 hours. no reduction in influenza virus replication with NSC159362 confirms their effect is specific. at 24, 48 and 72 hours post infection the apical surface washed with 200 l of PBS. the apical wash used to assay the growth of the virus by plaque assay on vero E6 cells. a previous study showed that SARS-CoV is only released from the apical surface of HAEs[20]. western blotting for GFP shows a size shift from the full length nsp2/3/GFP to the smaller nsp3/GFP fragment. 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing PLP and a plasmid expressing the nsp2/3/GFP fusion protein. at 18 hours each compound under study was added to the wells at a concentration of 100 M. 293T cells were transfected with either nsp2/3/GFP alone or with HA tagged PLP. cells were treated with 50 uM of each compound or 1% DMSO alone. protease activity was assayed by reduction in size of nsp2/3/GFP fusion protein by western blot with anti-GFP antibody. plasmids expressing PLP and Flag tagged ubiquitin (Flag/Ub) were co-transfected into 293T cells. at 4 hours post transfection each compound was added at a concentration of 50 M. at 4 hours post transfection each compound was added at a concentration of 50 M. compounds that inhibit PLP's IFN antagonism would be expected to restore induction of IFN. cells were transfected with an IFNpromoter/luciferase reporter plasmid. none of the compounds reversed the IFN antagonism activity of PLP/HA. vero cells were transfected with an IFN luciferase reporter plasmid for 18 hours. a control transfection was performed containing the plasmid and a plasmid expressing RIG-I, a potent inducer of IFN. cells were then treated with either DMSO or NSC158362 for 2 hours prior to an infection with SARS-CoV at an MOI of 3. compound NSC158362 is able to block SARS-CoV replication by more than 500 fold in culture. we also showed that NSC158362 has a strong anti-SARS-CoV effect using HAE cells. the precise effect of NSC158011 on protease activity could be due to several factors. these include direct inhibition of the protease activity. a cellular protein that modifies or bypasses the function of PLP in cells. a reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of IFN- promoter (IFN/luciferase) were identical to those used in [10]. the pdr1::KanMX4 was constructed in BY4741 (MATa his31 leu20 met150 ura30) and the pdr3::KanMX4 was constructed in BY4742 (MAT his31 leu20 met150 drug concentration was 50 M and the final DMSO concentration was 1%. OD600 readings were taken every 12 hours for 60 hours using a Thermomax microplate reader. luciferase reporter assay was used in 293T cells. a luciferase reporter assay was used in 293T cells. two different inducers of interferon were used for these experiments. a plasmid expressing Flag tagged ubiquitin was co-transfected with or without pCAGGS-PLP/HA. at 24 hours post transfection, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and visualized on SDS-PAGE gels with anti-Flag antibody. human airway epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing elective surgery. pRS416/PLP/HA was created by a reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of chicken -actin promoter (pCAGGS-PLP/HA) and a reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of IFN- promoter (IFN/luciferase) were identical to those used in [10]. 95 l of this culture was added to 5 l of pre-plated test compounds. the final drug concentration was 50 M and the final DMSO concentration was 1%. OD600 readings were taken every 12 hours for 60 hours using a Thermomax microplate reader. luciferase reporter assay was used in 293T cells. a luciferase reporter assay was used in 293T cells. two different inducers of interferon were used for these experiments. a plasmid expressing Flag tagged ubiquitin was co-transfected with or without pCAGGS-PLP/HA. at 24 hours post transfection, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and visualized on SDS-PAGE gels with anti-GFP antibody. at 4 hours post transfection drugs were added at the indicated concentrations. edward et al."}
