{"summary": "echinococcosis is caused by infections with Echinococcus granulosus. it is one of the main zoonoses related to dogs and is affecting most parts of the globe. a tight control of dog infections is the key element to arrest the life cycle of the parasite. the method has provided the high specificity of PCR, but due to the presence of inhibitors the DNA extraction procedure is cumbersome. the pre-patent period of the infection, when there is no egg production, is a critical time-window that challenges the sensitivity of the test. experimental and field animals Nineteen adult dogs, of mixed breeds and sex, were vaccinated against distemper encephalomyelitis, parvovirosis, rabies, leptospirosis, hepatitis and coronavirus (Merial, France) nineteen fecal samples (N1\u2013N19), corresponding to non-infected dogs, were collected two days after deworming. two additional dogs were infected orally with 5,000\u2013150,000 viable (>80%) protoscoleces from ovine fertile hydatid cysts. parasite material was obtained from sheep slaughter in local abattoirs in Paysand, Uruguay. fecal samples from each dog were collected daily during the experimental infection period. samples were vigorously shaken to obtain homogeneous slurries. after centrifugation for 10 min at 2,200 g the supernatants were aliquoted and kept frozen at 20\u00b0C until used. polyclonal antibodies were dissolved in 250 l of PBS and vigorously mixed with 250 l of Freund's Complete Adjuvant. emulsion was then injected subcutaneously into several points on the back of new Zealand white rabbits. fusion experiments were performed to produce a large panel of monoclonal antibodies. each supernatant was tested in a sandwich format in combination with the different polyclonal antibodies. this time instead of using fecal samples from heavily infected dogs, each supernatant was tested against the following. 0.05% of tween 20 (PBS-T), 3% non-fat milk, or directly with the culture supernatants of the MAbs antibodies. the membranes were then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1/2500) the wells were incubated (1 h) with a 15000 dilution (PBS-T) of a peroxidase conjugated rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse IgG. the enzymatic reaction was stopped after 15\u201320 min by the addition of 50 L of 2 M H2SO4 and the absorbance at 450\u2013600 nm was read in a microtiter plate reader. nineteen fecal samples (N1\u2013N19), corresponding to non-infected dogs, were collected two days after deworming. ten dogs (identified as P1\u2013P10) were infected orally with 5,000\u2013150,000 viable (>80%) protoscoleces from ovine fertile hydatid cysts. 85 unwanted dogs from the province of Chubut, Argentina, and 11 unwanted dogs from Junin, Peru, were euthanized following the procedure described above. the small intestines were removed post mortem and examined directly for the presence of parasites following the recommendations of the WHO/OIE [17] eptomycin (100 mg/L) and amphotericin B (250 g/L) were collected every 8 h for two days. the excretion/secretion antigens concentrated 100 using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit with an YM-10 membrane. antigens from T. hydatigena were similarly prepared. g of E. granulosus Sm or E/S antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant boosted after 3 and 6 weeks. splenocytes fused with SP2/0 cells using standard procedures. fusion experiments were performed to produce a large panel of monoclonal antibodies. the nitrocellulose was blocked with 3% non-fat milk powder in PBS 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the membranes were then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with a 1500 dilution of the rabbit anti-sera in PBS containing 0.05% of tween 20 (PBS-T), 3% non-fat milk, or directly with the culture supernatants of the MAbs antibodies. the enzymatic reaction was stopped after 15\u201320 min by the addition of 50 L of 2 M H2SO4 and the absorbance at 450\u2013600 nm was read in a microtiter plate reader. the cut-off for the assay was established by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. the number of worms recovered from each dog varied widely, from 74 to 8,500, and showed no correlation with the initial number of protoescoleces used for infection. a protoescoleces extract was also included as a reference antigen. clone MAbCPR39, secreting an IgG2b, was selected. the assay performed with negligible reactivity with samples from non-infected dogs. the readouts of the samples corresponding to dogs with small parasite burdens were significantly higher. dogs with less than 200 worms at necropsy, presented low readouts. along the time course of the examined period, the dogs harboring T. hydatigena worms presented very low values (below the cut-off), showing positive values only in very few days after 40 dpi. dotted line represents the cut-off established by analyzing field samples. the best combination resulted when PAb C4 was used as capture antibody in combination with MAb Eg9. the antibody reacted with a large number of the EgSm bands, mostly in the middle to high molecular weight range. cross-reactivity with T. hydatigena coproantigens did not seem to be a major problem when the time course of coproantigen excretion was study with the Eg9 copro-ELISA. animals with 200 or more parasites became positive between 12\u201315 dpi and by dpi 20 all infected dogs were positive. the number of worms recovered from each dog is indicated on the columns (u = unknown) the black horizontal line represents the cut-off = average of N-samples (MAbEg9)+3 standard deviations. if samples fall between 10% of the cut-off are considered undetermined, none of the samples analyzed with the Eg9 test would fall in this category. the average absorbance readings of the fecal samples obtained from these animals were 1.16 and 2.99 AU. one of the non-infected dogs (0.694 AU) from the province of Chubut were classified as positive with the Eg9 ELISA, figure 6. the relatively high readings of these two samples are unexpected. a misdiagnosis at necropsy can not be discarded. spp plus other helminths; Negative, dogs with no helminths. all values were determined in triplicates. development of the ELISA test in a kit format. all of them rapidly lost the enzymatic activity at 37\u00b0C. but using PBS, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Kathon, 0.1 mM TMB, the conjugate remained stable for up to 150 days at room temperature. overall, we can conclude that even at room temperature the kit has a safe shelf life of 3 months, which can surely be extended upon refrigeration. in case of high demand of the kit, it will be necessary to prepare new PAb. aliquots were distributed to two labs (INS and DIGESA) in Lima, Peru. the samples were independently analyzed by the three laboratories. twenty four samples were positive, indicating a prevalence of 46.1% in the studied areas. the recovered parasites were kept in culture to prepare excretion/secretion antigens or were sonicated as described to obtain somatic antigens. the SDS-PAGE profile did not reveal any obvious similarities among the individual components of the different preparation. clone MAbCPR39, secreting an IgG2b, was selected. the assay performed with negligible reactivity with samples from non-infected dogs. but the readouts of the samples corresponding to dogs with small parasite burdens were significantly higher. the dogs harboring T. hydatigena worms presented very low readouts throughout the experiment, showing positive values only in very few days after 40 dpi. y, along the time course of the examined period, presented very low values (below the cut-off), showing positive values only in very few days after 40 dpi. of PAbC4 with different parasite antigens in western blot was similar to that of PAbCGB10. the antibody reacted with a large number of the EgSm bands. two components of 100 and 160 kDa are the most prominent immunoreactive bands. the cross-reactivity with Th E/S antigens was negligible. eg9 copro-ELISA allowed an earlier detection of infected dogs. animals with 200 or more parasites became positive between 12\u201315 dpi. animals with 200 or more parasites became positive between 12\u201315 dpi and by dpi 20 all infected dogs were positives. the cut-off and cross-reactivity of the assays were evaluated with field samples collected from 96 unwanted dogs in the provinces of Chubut, Argentina and Junin, Peru. the sensitivity of the tests was superior 86.4% versus 82.7% for the CPR39 ELISA. only 9 E. granulosus and 2 Ascaris lumbricoides, and 47 E. granulosus and very few Dipylidium caninum worms were found in the first and second dogs. the average absorbance readings of the fecal samples obtained from these animals were 1.16 and 2.99 AU, which represent strong positive results. analysis of field samples by necropsy and copro ELISA. most false positive results will be related to dogs eating offal. most false positive results will be related to dogs eating offal. different formulations of the calibrator solution were stable over a 6 month period, even at 37\u00b0C. only the results for the Sm antigen diluted in PBS, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Kathon (Dow Chemicals, Midland, Michigan) are shown. the reactivity of MAb Eg9 started to diminish after a few days at 37\u00b0C, but was highly stable over the 6 month period at 4\u00b0C. the kit has a safe shelf life of 3 months, which can surely be extended upon refrigeration, which is a convenient advantage for the shipment and use of the kit in remote places. in case of high demand of the kit, it will be necessary to prepare new PAb. aliquots were distributed to two laboratories (INS and DIGESA) in Lima, Peru. the samples were independently analyzed and classified as positive, negative or uncertain if their readout felt within the calibrator absorbance reading 10% range. twenty four samples were positive, indicating a prevalence of 46.1% in the studied areas. the Eg9 copro antigen test is being shared with other control programs in the region. the test is being shared with other control programs in the region."}
