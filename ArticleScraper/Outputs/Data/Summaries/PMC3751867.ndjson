{"summary": "hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes may have distinct virological characteristics that correlate with clinical outcomes during antiviral therapy and the natural course of infection. only HBV genotype A has been used for studies with HI. the HI mouse model with a HBV genotype B genome showed different characteristics in vivo compared with the genotype A genome. the effectiveness of gene silencing against HBx gene determines whether HBV replication may be sustainably inhibited by siRNA in vivo. the HBV HI mouse model is a highly interesting model for testing vaccination strategies and mechanisms of viral persistence. previously, the established HBV HI mouse models were based on HBV genotype A replication-competent clones [14,13]. the plasmids were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion with PstI and SacI. the plasmids were cloned into the pBluesript II KS (+) vector separately. the plasmids were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion. pBS-HBV1.3B shows high replication competence both in vitro and in vivo. pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3B transfected hepatoma cells. at 48 h post-transfection, the culture supernatants of the transfected cells were harvested. pBS-HBV1.1B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3B were subjected to HI with plasmids. each group contained 10 mice. at 7 dpi, mouse serum samples were collected for HBV DNA quantification. pAAV-HBV1.3B was cloned into pAAV vector to generate pAAV-HBV1.3B. pAAV-HBV1.3B group included 14 mice and pAAV-HBV1.2 group included 9 mice. pAAV-HBV1.3B group included 14 mice and pAAV-HBV1.2 group included 9 mice. the liver tissue was collected from C57BL/6 mice injected with pAAV-HBV1.3B at 70, 168 and 252 dpi or pAAV-HBV1.2 at 70, 168 and 252 dpi. both cytoplasmic and nucleic HBcAg were detected in the liver of HBsAg-positive mice. no HBcAg positive cell was present in the liver of the control mice and HBsAg-negative mice. all results obtained in this experiment indicate that HBV genotype B construct was replication competent in the mouse liver. 10 g of pBS-HBV1.3B or pAAV-HBV1.3B were injected into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice. each group included 5 mice and 10 g pAAV-HBV1.3B or pAAV-HBV1.2 were injected into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice. level in pAAV-HBV1.3B injected mice was higher than that in pAAV-HBV1.2 injected mice. 20% of the mice are HBsAg positive at week 24 after HI with pAAV-HBV1.3B. none of the C57BL/6 mice injected with pAAV-HBV1.2 produced HBsAb after 28 dpi. all the mice with HBsAb are HBsAg negative. impaired HBcAg specific cellular immunity in pAAV-HBV1.2 and pAAV-HBV1.3B injected C57BL/6 mice. pSuper.retro (pSR) and pSuper.basic (pSB) were tested. the antiviral effect of pSR-HBxi314 and pSR-HBxi285 was investigated. different concentrations of HBx iRNA and pAAV-HBV1.3B were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells. the concentrations of the plasmids were indicated in the Tables. pSB-HBxi285 and pSB-HBxi285 were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells. xi285 and pSR-HBxi285 inhibited HBsAg and HBeAg in a dose-dependent manner. however, there was no significant difference in their antiviral effect. each group contained 10 mice. the positive rate of HBsAg in pSB-HBxi285 treated mice increased gradually. the positive rate of HBsAg in pSB-HBxi285 treated mice remained at a lower level (18.2-27.3%) than other groups until the 4th week post injection (wpi) but showed similar levels to those in the 5th wpi. value 0 of HBV DNA means the copy number of HBV DNA is lower than detection limit. the data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. ids The 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 fold over-length HBV genome DNA including nt 1658-3215-1986, nt 1360-3215-1986 and nt 1040-3215-1986 were cloned into the pBluesript II KS (+) vector separately. the plasmids were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion with PstI and SacI. pBS-HBV1.3B, pBS-HBV1.2B and pBS-HBV1.3B transfected hepatoma cells at 48 h post-transfection. the culture supernatants of the transfected cells were harvested and subjected to HBsAg and HBeAg detection. the data were statistically significant (* and mean p 0.01). pBS-HBV1.1B- (1), pBS-HBV1.2B- (2), pBS-HBV1.3B- (3) and pBS

and pAAV-HBV1.2 group included 9 mice. serum HBV DNA levels in pAAV-HBV1.3B mice were determined at the indicated time points up to week 48. hepatocytes of HBsAg-positive or HBsAg-negative mice were collected at day 252 after HI with pAAV-HBV1.3B (1, HBsAg positive mice and 3, HBsAg negative mice) the liver tissue was collected from C57BL/6 mice injected with pAAV-HBV1.3B at 70, 168 and 252 dpi or pAAV-HBV1.2 at 70, 168 and 252 all results obtained in this experiment indicate that HBV genotype B construct was replication competent in the mouse liver. 10 g of the pBS-HBV1.3B or pAAV-HBV1.3B plasmids were injected hydrodynamically into the tail veins of male mice. each group included 5 mice. 10 g of pAAV-HBV1.3B or pAAV-HBV1.3B were injected into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice. each group

HBsAg detection in HBxi285 treated and control mice. different hepatitis B virus genotypes may have distinct virologic characteristics. the majority of HBV infections are distributed in the Asia-Pacific region. in china and Taiwan, approximately 90% of patients under thirty-five years old who are infected with HBV would develop HCC. 1.3 fold over length HBV genome was sub-cloned into the pAAV-MCS vector. this vector also has the ITR (inverted terminal repeats) structure. the vector backbone has no direct effect on the immune system. the tolerance toward HBV surface antigen in this model was due to an insufficient cellular immunity against hepatitis B core antigen, as documented in humans. we repeated some experiments and obtained the same results. the difference in plasmid backbones between both clones needs to be investigated further. non-viral (pSuper.Basic) and retroviral vectors (pSuper.Retro) were used to construct shRNA expression plasmids targeting the HBx gene of HBV. the pSuper.Retro vector contains the H1 promoter which is a RNA polymerase III like promoter and can transcript shRNA steadily. siRNA targeting the HBx region has a stronger antiviral effect than that targeting the region nt 314\u2013332. it is known that siRNA-specific features such as low G/C content, a bias towards low internal stability at the sense strand 3\u2032-terminus, lack of inverted repeats, and so on are likely to contribute to efficient RNAi process. pAAV-HBV1.3B and pSB-HBxi285 or pSR- gene expression and replication may resume in some mice despite an initial delay. it is well established that only a small fraction of HBsAg is required for virion production. in the patients with chronic HBV infection, HBV DNA loads do not correlated with HBsAg. fragments of the genotype B HBV DNA nt 1658-3215-247, nt 1360-3215-247 and nt 1040-3215-247 were amplified by PCR with primers hbv1.1LF and hbvLR. the fragments were inserted into the pBluescript II KS (+) vector digested with XbaI and SacI. the correctness of the sequences of cloned DNA fragments was confirmed by sequencing. the 1.3 fold over length genome DNA was amplified from pGEM-HBV1.3B with primers hbv1.3 F (tagged with NotI) the resulting plasmid was designated as pAAV-HBV1.3B. gta ttg tga-3\u2032 AY220698.1 hbvSR HBV 1986-1969 5\u2032-acc gag ctctcg aaa gaa-3\u2032 AY220698.1 hbv1.3 F pGEM-T 4-39 5\u2032-ata aga atg cgg ccg ccg aat tgg gcc cgt cg-3\u2032 X653 0.5 g of pAAV-HBV1.3B and 0.5 g of pSR-HBxi314 or pSR-HBxi285 were co-transfected into Huh-7 cells in parallel. all cell transfection experiments were performed three times. pAAV-HBV1.3B group included 14 mice and pAAV-HBV1.2 group included 9 mice.
