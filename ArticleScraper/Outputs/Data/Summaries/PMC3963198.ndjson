{"summary": "guidelines have been developed for health care personnel involved in patient care in wards and critical care areas. the principles of the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system is used to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (C) each recommendation is categorized on the basis of existing scientific data, theoretical rationale, applicability and economic impact. Isolation rooms should have tight-fitting doors, glass partitions for observation and both negative-pressure (for source isolation) ventilations. observe hand hygiene Hands are the most common vehicle for transmission of organisms. a combination of chlorhexidine and alcohol is ideal as they cover Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, viruses, mycobacteria and fungi. a combination of chlorhexidine and alcohol is ideal as they cover Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, viruses, mycobacteria and fungi. a sterile gown is required only for aseptic procedures. a clean, non-sterile gown is sufficient (2A) Remove the soiled gown as soon as possible, with care to avoid contamination. disposable N-95 respirator mask fits tightly around the nose and mouth to protect against both large and small droplets. if unavoidable, clean and disinfect them adequately before using to another patient. use specific strategies focused on prevention of specific nosocomial infections. of these, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) and urinary tract infection (UTI) are the most important. if the catheter is inserted in a lower extremity site, replace to an upper extremity site as soon as possible (2A) use maximum sterile barrier precautions (cap, mask, sterile gown and sterile gloves) and a sterile full-body drape while inserting CVCs, peripherally inserted central catheters, or guidewire exchange (IA) Clean skin with more than 0.5% chlorhexidine preparation with alcohol (usually 2% chlorhexidine with 70% w/v Routine replacement of CVCs is not required (2A) replace administration sets, including secondary sets and add-on devices, every day in patients receiving blood, blood products, or fat emulsions (2A) replace disposable or reusable transducers at 96-h intervals (2A) central air-conditioning systems are designed in such a way that recirculated air must pass through appropriate filters (1B)[11] It is recommended that all air should be filtered to 99% efficiency down to 5 m (1A)[11] Suitable and safe air quality must be maintained at all times.

environment as well as in their propensity to disperse organisms into the surrounding environment. ial infections (1A) protocols for prevention of nosocomial infections (1A) audit and surveillance of infections and infection control practices (ICU protocols for prevention of nosocomial infections (1A) the patient has three principal defenses against infection. physical defenses, nonspecific immune responses and specific immune responses determine the patient's susceptibility to infection. invasive devices bypass the body's normal defense mechanisms. several studies have demonstrated the role of topical antimicrobials in decreasing morbidity and mortality in burn patients. topical antibiotic agents should first be applied directly to the patient's dressing before applying to the burn wound to prevent contamination of the agent's container by burn wound flora. early enteral feeding is likely effective because it increases circulation to the bowel, thereby decreasing ischemia post-injury and the translocation of bowel flora. active immunization with tetanus toxoid is also given to burn patients who have not received a complete primary immunizing series. burn patients are unique in their susceptibility to colonization from organisms in the environment as well as in their propensity to disperse organisms into the surrounding environment. the larger the burn injury, the greater the volume of organisms that will be dispersed into the environment from the patient. the effectiveness of simple protective barrier precautions reduces nosocomial colonization and infection (1A) it is recommended that patients with larger burn injuries be isolated in private rooms or other enclosed bed spaces to ensure physical separation from other patients on the unit. topical antimicrobials should first be applied directly to the patient's dressings before applying to the burn wound to prevent contamination of the agent's container by burn wound flora. studies have shown the role of topical antimicrobials in decreasing morbidity and mortality in burn patients. human tetanus immunoglobulin (250-500 IU) provides immediate passive immunization regardless of the patient's active immunization status. active immunization with tetanus toxoid is also given (0.5 ml intramuscularly) to burn patients who have not received a complete primary immunizing series or who have not received a tetanus toxoid booster within the past 10 years. burn patients are unique in their susceptibility to colonization from organisms in the environment as well as in their propensity to disperse organisms into the surrounding environment. the larger the burn injury, the greater the volume of organisms that will be dispersed into the environment from the patient. the effectiveness of simple protective barrier precautions reduces nosocomial colonization and infection (1A) it is recommended that patients with larger burn injuries be isolated in private rooms or other enclosed bed spaces. such isolation has been associated with a decrease in cross transmission of organisms (IB) reduced occurrence of burn wound infections have not demonstrated improved outcome compared to topical therapy and surgical excision. prophylactic systemic antibiotic therapy may be given immediately before, during and for one or two doses after the procedure. early excision occurs within the first few days after burn injury. bloodstream and intravascular catheter infection Whenever possible, catheters should be placed through unburned skin. this is not always feasible in patients with large burn injuries requiring long-term vascular access. patients with severe inhalation injury are also at risk for developing VAP. more than two-thirds of transplant patients have had a good result from transplantation and are primarily at risk from community-acquired respiratory viruses. on average 10-15% of transplant patients suffer from chronic viral infection, such as infection with hepatitis B or C virus, which progresses inexorably to end-stage organ dysfunction and/or cancer unless effective antiviral therapy can be administered. 5-10% are who have relatively poor allograft function and who have received excessive amounts of immuno if hands are visibly dirty, contaminated with proteinaceous material, wash hands with either a non-antimicrobial soap and water or an antimicrobial soap and water. the preferred method of hand decontamination is with an alcohol-based hand rub[32,33,34,35] (1B) isolation is recommended for control of airborne spread of pathogens. cleaning rooms should be cleaned >1 times/day with special attention to dust control (1A) Exhaust vents, window sills and all horizontal surfaces should be cleaned with cloths and mop heads that have been premoistened with disinfectant (2B) medical devices and other equipment should be decontaminated according to existing guidance (2B) immunocompromised individuals are advised to avoid foods made with raw egg. all drinking water for immunocompromised patients should be chemically sterilized or boiled (1B) visitors who might have communicable infectious diseases (e.g. upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), flu-like illnesses, recent exposure to communicable diseases, an active shingles rash, a VZV-like rash within 6 weeks of receiving a live-attenuated VZV vaccine. isolation is recommended for control of airborne spread of pathogens. cross-colonization with organisms predominantly spread by contact (such as MRSA), infection may only be reduced by changing behavior of staff. room ventilation should be placed in rooms with >12 air exchanges/h. hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination has been shown to be superior to conventional cleaning but can only be used in enclosed rooms as it is toxic to humans. guidelines exist for floor space in ICUs (ESICM and SCCM references) if hands are visibly dirty, contaminated with proteinaceous material, or visibly soiled with blood or body fluids, wash hands with either a non-antimicrobial soap and water or an antimicrobial soap and water. the preferred method of hand decontamination is with an alcohol-based hand rub[32,33,34,35] (1B). isolation of potentially contagious patients within the ICU should be attempted if practical to reduce the chances of cross infection. cleaning rooms should be cleaned >1 times/day with special attention to dust control (1A) Exhaust vents, window sills and all horizontal surfaces should be cleaned with cloths and mop heads that have been premoistened with disinfectant (2B) medical devices and other equipment should be decontaminated according to existing guidance. immunocompromised individuals are advised to avoid foods made with raw egg. all drinking water for immunocompromised patients should be chemically sterilized or boiled (1B) Vaccination in immunocompromised patients should be done in accordance with the published guidelines. adherence to hand hygiene protocol ranges from 5% to 89% (38.7%) among the HCWs. CDC guidelines[48] and the WHO guidelines[4] recommend that HCWs wash their hands with soap and water when visibly soiled and exposure to potential spore-forming pathogens is strongly suspected or proven. each patient and when performing separate procedures on the same patient if cross-contamination is possible. remove gloves after caring for a patient before answering telephones or recording patient notes Remove gloves after caring for the patient. education of HCW and periodic assessment of adherence to insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters protocol had been given higher level of recommendation. new employee orientation to infection control program and making the employees responsible for infection prevention had been recommended by Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. Observation Direct observation is the gold standard to monitor compliance with optimal hand hygiene practice. monthly monitoring of hand hygiene product consumption had also been advocated as an indirect measure of hand hygiene. first aim of surveillance is to determine endemic rate of infection. infection rate can be reduced by 31-44% with the implementation of effective surveillance system. CDC guidelines[48] and the WHO guidelines[4] recommend that HCWs wash their hands with soap and water when visibly soiled. exposure to potential spore-forming pathogens is strongly suspected or proven, including outbreaks of C. difficile (1B) the glucometers should be cleaned and disinfected as per CDC recommendation. it has been observed that HBV and HCV in dry blood remain infectious even when exposed to external environment. non-compliance to a single measure should be interpreted as failure to comply with the whole bundle. therefore, a higher target of > 95% compliance had been advocated[47] 7. training: Effectiveness of staff education on HAI prevention is controversial but it's value had been appreciated. Observation Direct observation is the gold standard to monitor compliance with optimal hand hygiene practice. Monthly monitoring of hand hygiene product consumption (Soap, alcohol rub) had also been advocated as an indirect measure of hand hygiene. the first aim of surveillance is to determine endemic rate of infection. it has been claimed that infection rate can be reduced by 31-44%. sensitivity pattern and antimicrobial use should be part of epidemiology program. community acquired and HAI should be separated while analysing the data. gloves were advocated when it can be reasonably anticipated contact of blood or other potentially infectious materials with, mucous membranes, or non-intact skin will occur. if cross-contamination is possible, remove gloves after caring for a patient. compliance monitoring of care bundles should be done in a very stringent manner. non-compliance to a single measure should be interpreted as failure to comply with the whole bundle. a higher target of > 95% compliance had been advocated[47] 7. the primary investigating team should include the hospital epidemiologist, the director of employee health, the infection-control team and microbiologist. the primary investigating team should include the hospital epidemiologist, the director of employee health, the infection-control team and microbiologist. computerized surveillance helps in better implementation of preventive strategies. but lower infection rates had not been proven conclusively. first aim of surveillance is to determine endemic rate of infection. hospital comparison of HAI demands standardization of definitions, data collection and analysis. sensitivity pattern and antimicrobial use should be part of epidemiology program. community acquired and HAI should be separated while analyzing the data. formulary restriction and preauthorization requirements can lead to significant reductions in antimicrobial use (1B) Continuing education of all stakeholders should be done to provide a foundation of knowledge that will enhance and increase the acceptance of stewardship strategies (1C) an early switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics is highly desirable specially in resource limited setting to decrease cost of therapy. effective use of information technologies such as electronic medical record, hospital information system, computerized physician order entry and clinical decision support facilitate delivery of the stewardship program more effectively (1B)"}
