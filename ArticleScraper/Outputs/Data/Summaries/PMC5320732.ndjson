{"summary": "hepadnaviruses, hepeviruses, hepatoviruses, and hepaciviruses have been discovered in various species of bat around the world. 78 bat liver samples were examined using nested or heminested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) results Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus exhibited high levels of divergence at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. the discovery of BtHBVRs3364 further supports the significance of host switches evolution while opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with hepadnaviruses."}
