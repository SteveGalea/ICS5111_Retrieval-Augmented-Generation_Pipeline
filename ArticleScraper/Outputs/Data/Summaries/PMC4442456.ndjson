{"summary": "cell cycle is a series of events that describe the growth and division of a cell. in the first gap phase (G1) there is a high rate of translation as components required for DNA synthesis are created. cells enter gap 0 (G0) during G1 phase, if mitogenic stimulants are not present where the cell metabolic rate is low. papillomavirus, adenovirus, and simian virus 40 encode proteins. RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm can also affect the cell cycle. noroviruses are members of the family Caliciviridae. MNV-1 infection of RAW264.7 and RAW-Blue cells altered expression of key cell cycle regulatory molecules. conditions created by infection aid MNV-1 replication over cells in other phases of the cell cycle. the pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS) and filter sterilized through a 0.45-m filter to create a purified MNV-1 stock. cells were infected in medium free of antibiotics with MNV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for viral effects on the cell cycle and an MOI of 1 for cell cycle effects on MNV-1 replication. Ratios were not calculated when the mock-infected values were low (50). the normalized data and ratios were visualized in PathVisio using WikiPathways (e.g., WP190 cell cycle) (21). 3.5 106 cells were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks then synchronized to M phase with nocodazole treatment. the monolayer was washed 3 times, and complete medium was added. the now-G1 phase cells were plated at 1 106 cells per well in a 6-well plate. cells were harvested and fixed in 3 ml ice-cold 70% ethanol. after >12 h, the cells were washed in dPBS and resuspended in staining buffer. fluorescence of infrared secondary antibodies was detected and quantified with an Odyssey Fc imaging system (LI-COR). secondary antibodies were 680RD donkey anti-goat IgG (926-68074; LI-COR), 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG (926-32213; LI-COR), and 800CW donkey anti-mouse IgG (926-32212; LI-COR). omycin (0.1 mg/ml) (Life Technologies), and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) cells were passaged every 48 h and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cell debris was removed through centrifugation, and the supernatant was collected. asynchronously growing RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 8 105 cells/well. at 18 h p.i., RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy minikit. RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy minikit. cell cycle and nucleotide metabolism regulators synchronized to the G0 phase by serum deprivation. Approximately 1.5 106 cells were seeded into 25-cm2 flasks. cells were seeded at 8 105 cells/well in 6-well plates or 2.0 106 cells in 25-cm2 flasks. for G2 phase arrest, cells were seeded at 1.5 106 in 25-cm2 flasks. for M phase arrest, cells were seeded at 8 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. at least 10,000 cells were counted for each sample. plasma staining was used to quantify viral titers. plasma staining was used to quantify viral titers. anti-rabbit IgG (926-32213; LI-COR), and 800CW donkey anti-mouse IgG (926-32212; LI-COR) were shown for one of three independent experiments. each protein quantification was first normalized against actin loading, before comparisons for changes (recorded as n-fold) were made. the transcripts most significantly reduced included the BP terms \u201cCell cycle\u201d (97 genes; corrected P value, 3.1 1053) and similar protein terms (Swiss-Prot) or GO terms (data not shown). additional clusters of reduced expression included terms related to the cellular component \u201cChromosome\u201d (68 genes; P, 3.3 1042) and \u201cSpindle\u201d and the molecular function \u201cATP binding\u201d. cyclin levels in asynchronously growing mock-infected cells are likely to change expression levels of proteins. an effect on cells at an RNA transcript level is likely to change expression levels of proteins. the results show a significant decrease in both cyclin A and B2 expression. we postulated that the decrease in A and B cyclins could indicate that cells were accumulating in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. at 9 h postinfection, there was a 24% increase in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. synchronized cells were monitored for cell cycle progression through the G1/S restriction point. MNV-1 infection caused a reduction in S phase entry, compared to mock-infected cells. the results are indicative of an arrest at the G1/S restriction point. 0/G1 population decreases and the S phase population increases after serum addition, as cells reenter cell replication. MNV-1-infected cells remained mostly in G0/G1 phase after serum addition, indicating that the viral infection induces a G0/G1 phase accumulation through either a decrease in progression through G1/S or a prolonging of G0 or G1 phase. a 40% drop in the G2/M population and a 40% increase in the G0/G1 population in both mock-infected and MNV-1-infected populations. results show that MNV-1 infection had no influence on progression of the cell cycle through the M phase to the G0/G1 phase. cyclin D1 levels decreased slightly in infected populations compared to mock-infected cells. at 15 h postinfection, there was a 0.28-fold decrease in cyclin A expression between mock-infected and MNV-1-infected cells. data from panel B were quantified by Image Studio Lite (LI-COR) and normalized against actin loading control. Statistical significance was determined for comparison to the corresponding value at 0 h p.i. for each cyclin. MNV-1 virus levels were highest in cell populations progressing through G1>. synchronized populations in G1, G2 and M phases had no difference in MNV-1 replication compared to an unsynchronized population. G0 phase-arrested cells had the lowest levels of MNV-1 replication. at 9 h postinfection, cells were harvested and analyzed. the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle is shown. asynchronous RAW264.7 cells were infected with virus. fewer than 10% were 2-fold downregulated and 20% were upregulated. transcripts encoding proteins in the cell cycle were reduced. those with 5-fold or greater changes in both directions were analyzed. gene expression was analyzed by affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 microarrays. only the genes in the \u201cCell cycle (Mus musculus)\u201d pathway are shown. those with higher mRNA expression are shown in orange to red (2-fold). cyclin expression decreased 0.56-fold at 9 h postinfection. cyclin D1, E, and B1 showed no differences between asynchronously growing mock-infected and infected cells. changes to cyclin levels are supported by microarray results. cyclin, *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001. asynchronous RAW-Blue cells were mock infected or infected with MNV at an MOI of 5. at 9 h postinfection, there was a 24% increase in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. cells were synchronized to G1 with N-butyrate treatment. then stimulated to reenter division through replacement of N-butyrate medium. in mock-infected cells, the G0/G1 population decreases and the S phase population increases after serum addition. MNV-1 infection does not influence late-phase cell progression from M phase into G1 phase. a possible explanation for the G0/G1 phase accumulation seen during MNV-1 infection is faster progression through the later phases of the cell cycle through to G0/G1 phase. the results are means and SD from three experiments. MNV-1 infection inhibits cyclin A expression. changes to cyclin expression suggest that MNV-1 impacts the G1/S restriction point. MNV-infected cells were either mock infected (Mock) or MNV infected at an MOI of 5. After 1 h of virus absorption the cells were washed 3 times and complete medium was added. the synchronized and unsynchronized populations were seeded at equal cell densities and infected with MNV-1 at an MOI of 1. at the time of infection, cells were harvested and cell cycle analysis was performed to show cell synchronization prior to infection. at 9 h postinfection, cells had remained synchronized in their target cell phase during the course of infection. unsynchronized and unsynchronized cells were resuspended in complete medium and G0 cells in medium with no FBS. cells were seeded at 1 106 cells per well into 6-well plates and infected with MNV at an MOI of 1 for 1 h. the results are means and SD from three experiments. DISCUSSION This study explored the relationship between the cell cycle and murine norovirus replication. the results show that MNV-1 affects key cell cycle regulatory proteins at the level of expression in RAW264.7 cells, as determined by RNA transcript analysis. the B family of cyclins are highly expressed during cell cycle progression during late S phase until late mitosis (27, 28) this is consistent with the effect of MNV-1 on the cell cycle. cyclin B2 expression would be low in a G1 phase-arrested population due to decreased S phase and G2/M phase cells. expression is one probable cause of the observed MNV-1 induction of the G1/S phase arrest. the arrest induced by MNV-1 is late in the G1 phase, where cyclin D1 would be expressed. a range of factors regulate cell replication in addition to cyclins. a cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase would provide increased amounts of ribonucleotides. expression of enzymes involved in the processing of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides is inhibited during MNV-1 infection. a cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase would provide increased amounts of ribonucleotide pools for MNV-1 genome synthesis. translation efficiency of hepatitis C virus is shown to be greatest during the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (36). the G1/S phase arrest induced by MNV may increase translation efficiency rates of MNV proteins and aid in MNV replication. the recruitment of membranes for norovirus replication has been shown to be vital to the synthesis of viral proteins (37). MNV-1 infection in RAW-Blue cells causes accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase due to a decrease in G1/S phase progression. this interaction with the cell cycle phase identified for MNV-1 may be applicable to other caliciviruses."}
