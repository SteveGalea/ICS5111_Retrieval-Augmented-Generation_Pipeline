{"summary": "the main route of transmission is through direct contact between infected and uninfected animals. pigs are raised in production units with high animal densities. pigs are considered \u201cmixing vessels\u201d for new human-avian influenza A virus reassortants. in vitro experiments also showed direct antiviral effects of E. faecium against enteric and non-enteric viruses. the potential mechanisms include pathogen exclusion by means of competition for attachment as well as the induction of cytokines. probiotic E. faecium was applied as a commercial probiotic feed additive. it was mixed to the diets of weaned piglets at a concentration of 1109 colony forming units (CFU)/kg feed. piglets (n = 72) were raised at the Institut f\u00fcr Tierern\u00e4hrung, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin. the diet was then reduced to medium levels (Znmed) half of the piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly (VAC) twice on day 35 and 56 with the commercial SIV vaccine. half of the piglets from each group were killed on 1 and 6 dpi, respectively, by i.v. injection of 0.1 ml/kg body mass T61\u00ae (Intervet Deutschland GmbH, Unterschlei\u00dfheim, Germany) animals were clinically monitored daily for the development of clinical signs including fever, fatigue, anorexia, dyspnea and cough. oxylin/eosin (H&E) standard staining protocol [23] examined microscopically. lesion severity was scored by the distribution of lesions within the sections examined as follows. Viral RNA Quantification from Swabs Nasal, buccal and fecal swabs was taken at 0, 2, 4, 6 dpi and from fecal swabs at 3 dpi using the MagAttract\u00ae DNA Mini M48 Kit. eluted in 1 mL serum-free cell-culture media of which 100 l were used for RNA extraction into 100 l AVE buffer. the left lungs were lavaged with 50 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) using a flexible tube. samples were centrifuged at 300g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. results from flow cytometry were analyzed using FlowJoTM software. probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 10415 was applied as a commercial probiotic feed additive. it was mixed to the diets of weaned piglets at a concentration of 1109 colony forming units (CFU)/kg feed. the Znlow diet represents the regular feed of the animals. Piglets were raised at the Institut f\u00fcr Tierern\u00e4hrung, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin. high Zn levels were fed only until the age of 56 days in order to avoid toxic effects. half of the piglets from each group were killed on 1 and 6 dpi, respectively, by i.v. injection of 0.1 ml/kg body mass T61\u00ae (Intervet Deutschland GmbH, Unterschlei\u00dfheim, Germany) animals were clinically monitored daily for the development of clinical signs including fever, fatigue, anorexia, dyspnea and cough. lesion severity was scored by the distribution of lesions within the sections examined as follows: 0 - no visible changes; 1 - mild changes, minimally different from the normal; 2 - moderate changes; 3 - severe and diffusely distributed changes. RNA was extracted from nasal and buccal swabs taken at 0, 2, 4, 6 dpi. fecal swabs were eluted in 1 mL serum-free cell-culture media. 100 l were used for RNA extraction into 100 l AVE buffer. real-time reverse transcriptase RT-qPCR was performed using a pan-Influenza A-M1.2 assay. the left lungs were lavaged with 50 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) using a flexible tube. the pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer and stained. results from flow cytometry were analyzed using FlowJoTM software (Treestar, Ashland, USA) results Clinical Symptoms and Weight Gains Clinically, SIV infection caused only mild symptoms (Figure 1) with fever (40\u00b0C) only sporadically observed. average body temperatures were lowest in the E. faecium+VAC group throughout the observation period after SIV infection, with mean temperatures spiking in the vaccinated Znlow group on 2 dpi. sections from affected pigs presented with mild (score 1) to severe (score 3) interstitial bronchopneumonia that was dominated by lymphocytic infiltration. bronchioles and alveoli contained cellular debris with lymphocytes, fewer histiocytes and scattered neutrophils accompanied by bronchiolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis. no virus genomes were detectable in samples before infection and in fecal swabs. Vaccinated animals had approximately 10- to 100-fold reduced viral loads compared to non-vaccinated animals in both nasal and buccal swabs. significantly higher antibodies were also detected in the Znhigh+VAC groups on the day of SIV infection (P0.05), 1 dpi (P0.01) and 4 dpi (P0.05) for the non-vaccinated piglets, antibodies could barely be detected at 6 dpi by either method. 43.9 6 94.9 84.9 102.3 70.1 86.1 91.6 6.9 40.3 15.5 19.1 19.4 26.6 Lymphocytes 0 87.8 103.2 97.0 89.3 85.8 94.7 (60\u2013340) 15.4 27.2 35.1 10.1 16.8 9.5 3 92.0 107.4 94.0 89.1 103.9 111.7 13.1 16.7 13.3 23.8 20.1 15.6 6 93.1 86.4 81.1 69.8 89.7 79 no significant differences were observed for any subpopulation before infection. higher CTL percentages (P0.05) were found in the Znhigh+VAC group compared to the control Znlow+VAC group at 5 dpi. nhigh and faecium fed groups increased after SIV infection from 1 dpi to 6 dpi. the weights declined in the Znlow groups at those time points. vaccinated animals that had received E. faecium in the diet showed the lowest lesion scores. H&E stained lung of a non-vaccinated piglet with normal bronchial epithelial lining and absence of infiltrates of inflammatory cells. no virus genomes were detectable in samples before infection and in fecal swabs from 3 dpi. competition ELISA targeting NP from 2 dpi to 6 dpi. dotted line indicates threshold above which values are considered positive. significantly higher antibodies could be detected in the E. faecium+VAC groups. all swabs taken at the day of infection (0 dpi) were negative (not shown) the numbers of monocytes and lymphocytes showed no differences between the groups. decreased numbers of neutrophils were observed in the Znhigh groups. virus infection led to a slight decrease in the frequency of Th cells until 6 dpi. increased percentages of CTLs, Th/memory cells, antibody-forming and/or memory B cells, and NK cells were observed until 6 dpi in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals. increased percentages of gamma delta T-cell, activated B-cell and activated T-cell at 6 dpi after infection compared to 1 dpi. but no influence of vaccination and dietary treatment. the increased antibody response to vaccination in the group receiving the higher Zn level diet might indicate that a suboptimal Zn supply in the Znlow group was restored. dietary supplementation with E. faecium was able to boost antibody levels. vaccinated animals showed more extensive macroscopical lesions than non-vaccinated animals. vaccination reduced the severity of microscopic lesions. however, a dietary influence on these observations was not apparent. inactivated vaccines are poor inducers of cellular immune responses. we found a slight decrease in Th cells and a concomitant increase of CTL and antibody-producing B cell percentages from 1 to 6 dpi in PBMCs. each bar represents the mean value standard deviation from 12 pigs. weights were measured after exsanguination. each bar represents the mean value standard deviation from 6 pigs."}
