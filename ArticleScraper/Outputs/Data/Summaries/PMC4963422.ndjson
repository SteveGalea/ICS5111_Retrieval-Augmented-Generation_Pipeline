{"summary": "Macrophages can imbibe low-density lipoprotein (LDL) through scavenger receptors to become foam cells. the anti-inflammatory nature of Chinese herbs have the capacity to halt the complex mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. no specific and effective anti-inflammatory therapy has been described in the literature. herbal medicines are a common form of alternative therapy because of their supposed low toxicity and natural origins. a pharmacologically active component of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen) reduces atherosclerosis by inhibiting macrophage cholesterol accumulation and proinflammatory cytokine expression. in this study, more than 30 types of anti-inflammatory Chinese herbs were screened. THP-1 cells at a density of 1 106/mL were incubated with 100 ng/mL PMA for 3 days. DiI-OxLDL uptake assays THP-1 macrophages were incubated with 1,19-dioctadecyl-3,3,39,39-tetramethylindocarbocyane perchlorate (DiI-OxLDL) escence Western blotting (Amersham) was performed as previously described. the treated cells were pelleted and re-suspended in a lysis buffer. the nitrocellulose filter was incubated with TBS-T containing 5% nonfat milk (milk buffer) for 1 hour. the filter was then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. THP-1 cells were cultured in a RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 g/mL) the extract was stored at 20 \u00b0C until use. western blotting Enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting (Amersham) was performed as previously described. treated cells were pelleted and re-suspended in a lysis buffer. equal amounts of whole cellular extracts were then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Gentiana scabra and some Chinese herbs inhibited Dii-OxLDL uptake significantly in THP-1 macrophages. only the concentrations of Gentiana scabra used in the experiments were not cytotoxic. Gentiana scabra inhibited expression of SR-A, but not CD36, in THP-1 macrophages. the majority of modified lipoproteins are ingested in macrophages through SR-A. treatment with an ERK inhibitor, PD98059, reduced ERK activation in a dose-dependent manner. ERK pathway is involved in Gentiana scabra regulating SR-A expression. Gentiana scabra and some Chinese herbs inhibited Dii-OxLDL uptake significantly in THP-1 macrophages. only the concentrations of Gentiana scabra used in the experiments were not cytotoxic. Gentiana scabra dose-dependently suppressed Dii-OxLDL uptake in THP-1 macrophages. the majority of modified lipoproteins are ingested in macrophages through SR-A and CD36. ERK pathway is involved in Gentiana scabra regulating SR-A expression. treatment with an ERK inhibitor, PD98059, reduced the expression of SR-A, but not CD36. the results of this study suggest that Gentiana scabra inhibits OxLDL uptake by regulating SR-A expression. a possible underlying mechanism may be through ERK signaling pathways. SRs (SR-A and CD36) are responsible for the internalization of OxLDL. the uptake of cholesterol-rich LDL by macrophages is believed to be critical in mediating the development of atherosclerotic plaques. current study revealed Gentiana scabra reduced OxLDL uptake significantly in THP-1 macrophages. but some limitations should be noted before the findings are interpreted. atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a complex interplay of various cell types, such as endothelial cells (ECs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages in vessel walls. the so-called \u201cJunn-Chenn-Zuou-SS\u201d theory illustrates a concept of coordinated effects from a combination of compounds or Chinese herbs. a combination of compounds or Chinese herbs might make Chinese herbs less toxic and more highly tolerated than Western drugs."}
