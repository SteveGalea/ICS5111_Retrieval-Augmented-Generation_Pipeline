{"summary": "the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has to date (20th September 2013) caused 58 human deaths. MERS-CoV uses the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor for cell entry. analysis of the long-term interaction between virus and receptor provides key information. cell-surface receptors such as DPP4 play a key role in facilitating viral invasion and tropism. the long-term co-evolutionary dynamics between hosts and viruses often leave evolutionary footprints in both receptor-encoding genes of hosts and the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of viruses in the form of positively selected amino acid residues. the complete DPP4 genes of bats and non-bat reference genomes from a range of mammalian species were aligned using MUSCLE [12] guided by translated amino acid sequences. we then compared a series of models within a maximum likelihood framework [13], incorporating the published mammalian species tree [14-16]. alecto Pteropodidae KB031068 Common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus Phyllostomidae GABZ01004546 Brandt\u2019s bat Myotis brandtii Vespertilionidae KE161360 David\u2019s myotis myotis davidii Vespertilionidae KB109552 Little brown bat Myotis lucifugus Vesperti 59 Galago Otolemur garnettii Galagidae XM_003795172 Marmoset Callithrix jacchus Cebidae XM_002749392 American pika Ochotona princeps Ochotonidae XM_004577330 Figure 1.
