{"summary": "the mapping of -secretase activity susceptible gene transcription is important for sharpening our view of specific affected genes, molecular functions and biological pathways. single genes with the most pronounced transcriptional susceptibility to -secretase activity were evaluated by real-time PCR. the mapping of interactions of proteins encoded by the validated genes exclusively relied on evidence-based data. -secretase is an unconventional aspartyl protease with an intramembranous catalytic site that is typical of the class of intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CliPs) via the processing of its substrates and freeing of their intracellular domains (ICDs) -secretase regulates a multitude of signaling pathways and biological processes by influencing gene transcription. -secretase is crucial for hepatoblast differentiation [4], epidermis and hair follicle differentiation [5], alveolar differentiation in mammary glands [6], maintenance of skin appendages [7], intestinal stem cell specification [8], induction of satellite cells after injury and maintenance [9] and neural specification of embryonic stem cells [10]. cDNA microarray was used to identify genes differentially transcribed in cells with enhanced -secretase activity. inhibition of -secretase leads to gene-dependent decrease (in the case of Hes/Hey genes) or increase (in the case of NC3C1) of mRNA copy numbers. APP processing is also involved in the regulation of brain ApoE and cholesterol metabolism through LRP1. -secretase is directly or indirectly implicated in the pathogenesis of both FAD and LOAD, making it an attractive therapeutic target for the prevention and/or treatment of AD. cDNA microarray analysis of genes differentially transcribed in cells with enhanced -secretase activity. the other cell line consisted of the original parental wild type CHO cells incubated with DAPT, a well-known -secretase inhibitor. we strategically chose those two conditions, overexpression of -secretase and inhibition of its activity, to amplify the activity-dependent effects on gene transcription levels. cross-species hybridization yielded 89.6% overlap in their arrays. but we have detected a significant amount, including clusters of functional relevance. for example, Neprilysin, an enzyme of functional relevance to AD, was not detected in the current study. functional clustering of genes of GO functions transcriptionally susceptible to -secretase activity levels resulted in a GO hierarchy-dependent tree that will provide further orientation for -secretase research. clusters of genes of a specific functional group were found to be overrepresented among the differentially expressed sequences (1981 genes) red boxes display GO terms that were over-represented. blue boxes indicate GO terms that were under-represented. clustering of 1981 differentially transcribed genes was performed with the FatiGo tool. several known substrates of the enzyme were detected on the microarray. this suggests a possible feedback mechanism by which the augmented processing of these substrates by -secretase might lead to altered transcription. GO function termed \"Binding\" overrepresented through six subclusters. binding subclusters of \"nucleic acid binding\" GO0003676 and \"nucleotide binding\" GO0000166 are overrepresented. a consistently overrepresented subcluster of the latter is \"cytoskeletal protein binding\" the highest increase in transcription levels was detected for UPP1. uridine is a strong sleep-promoter and is crucial for RNA, DNA and membrane biosynthesis. a lack of uridine (caused by increased UPase) would thus first damage cells with a large membrane to cytoplasm ratio. DVL3 was confirmed by real time PCR with a 7-fold increase in mRNA levels under enhanced -secretase activity. we found several key players of the three Wnt pathways to be transcriptionally altered in response to enhanced -secretase activity. protein interaction data suggest Wnt pathways as a major target of -secretase susceptible gene transcription. some of these genes have been confirmed by real time PCR as well as DIGE experiments. cyclin D1 [39] is strongly affected by the canonical Wnt pathway. Ptprzeta and beta interact with Psd95 [40], which directly interacts with Wnt3a. a known -secretase substrate tying -secretase to a major AD risk factor. -secretase activity, -catenin plays a central role, linking different proteins involved in different Wnt pathways. -catenin transcription was shown by the microarray to be 3-fold decreased. it interacts directly with cdh15 (which showed a 2.4-fold increase in transcript levels as confirmed by real time PCR, Fig. 3) top candidate UPP1 has only one interaction partner that was also reported to be differentially expressed by the microarray. the cytoskeleton protein vimentin (Vim) is not new to AD research, as altered Vim distribution patterns were observed in FAD fibroblasts. ated genes are represented in circles (blue circles for genes of decreased transcription, red circles for genes of increased transcription) proteins with blue background are known -secretase substrates. central grey box indicates -secretase subunits. real-time PCR results showed an average two-fold increased TERA transcript levels (P2 = 0.04) in human AD cortices compared to healthy controls. only the transcript levels of TERA, a gene of unknown function, is significantly altered with a two-fold increase in AD cortices. the cell line overexpresses the four components of -secretase (NCT, Aph1a, PS1 and Pen2) and was characterized by a marked increase in PS1 heterodimers. the other cell line consisted of the original parental wild type CHO cells incubated with DAPT, a well-known -secretase inhibitor. we used chemical inhibition of -secretase activity instead of gene silencing, which ultimately leads to changes in protein cross-species hybridization yielded 89.6% overlap in their arrays, non-contradicting results and led only to a decrease in sensitivity. a significant amount, including clusters of functional relevance, was not detected in the current study. gene protein Probe ID FC adj.P.Val.

GO0004872, \u201ctransmembrane receptor activity\u201d GO 0004888 and \u201cneurotransmitter receptor activity\u201d GO0030594 were underrepresented. this is significant since neurotransmitter activity and transmembrane receptors are well within focus of current AD research [24]. 56 other transcription-related genes were found to be differentially transcribed with enhanced -secretase activity. several known substrates of the enzyme were detected on the microarray. this suggests a possible feedback mechanism by which the augmented processing of these substrates by -secretase might lead to altered transcription. ase substrates and were found to have altered gene expression with enhanced -secretase activity. this cluster is overrepresented through six subclusters and several subclusters of these. a consistently overrepresented subcluster of the latter is GO0008092. mouse code based primers worked reproducibly and specifically for 35 genes. a total of 21 genes were validated to be differentially transcribed with enhanced -secretase activity. the highest increase in transcription levels was detected for UPP1. Error bars reflect standard deviations of biological triplicates. the notch-dependent transcriptional repressor Hes1 was also confirmed by real time PCR with a 7-fold increase in mRNA levels under enhanced -secretase activity. DVL3 was confirmed by qPCR to increase mRNA copy numbers by 3-fold. CYC D has also been reported to be downregulated by protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG). AMN1 (levels down 978-fold) has also been linked with cell cycle regulation in yeast. the same group reported functional evidence for a critical interaction of Ptprg with the extracellular matrix, which induces cell arrest, changes in cell cycle status and downregulation of cyclin D1 [39]. the latter is strongly affected by the canonical Wnt pathway. -catenin plays a central role, linking different proteins involved in different Wnt pathways. -catenin transcription was shown to be 3-fold decreased by the microarray. it interacts directly with cdh15 (which showed a 2.4-fold increase in transcript levels) our top candidate UPP1 has only one interaction partner that was reported to be differentially expressed by the microarray. the cytoskeleton protein vimentin (Vim) is not new to AD research, as altered Vim distribution patterns were observed in FAD fibroblasts. proteins encoded by PCR-validated genes are represented in circles. interaction partners encoded by genes identified in our microarray. proteins with blue background are known -secretase subunits. real-time PCR results showed an average two-fold increased TERA transcript levels in human AD cortices compared to healthy controls. only the transcript levels of TERA, a gene of unknown function, is significantly altered with a two-fold increase in AD cortices. enhanced human -secretase activity and pharmacologically inhibited -secretase activity in CHO cell lines were investigated using cDNA microarray analysis. the canonical, the planar cell polarity (PCP) and the ca2+/Wnt pathways are transcriptionally affected through more than a dozen of Wnt signaling players. -secretase activity influences transcript levels of genes of the canonical, the planar cell polarity and Ca2+ Wnt pathways. -catenin also finds itself in the center of interactions of proteins encoded by strongly differentially expressed genes. -secretase activity influences the transcript levels of genes of the canonical, the planar cell polarity and ca2+ Wnt pathways. a gene that we found to be decreased in transcription has been linked to brain development and Wnt antagonism. this gene is upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma (AC) and colon, ovary, rectum and stomach tumors. expression patterns in early stages of brain development suggest possible roles for Tera in regenerative processes. chromosome 12p11 has been discussed to contain an unknown LOAD locus for over a decade. in a recent study, AMN1 transcription is decreased by 978-fold with enhanced -secretase activity. a typical cilia gene is intraflagellar transport protein 81. flow shear stress as sensed through cilia may regulate the Wnt signaling pathway through -catenin [67], [68] both genes of unknown function TERA and AMN1 are decreased in transcription with enhanced -secretase activity. both genes of unknown function TERA and AMN1 can be connected to neural stem cells through several types of cancer, neural differentiation (in the case of AMN1) enhanced UPase activity cleaving uridine would have inhibitory effects on several pathways downstream of uridine, like RNA/DNA and membrane synthesis. decreased membrane synthesis, in turn, would also reduce synaptic activity and plasticity. -secretase is capable of influencing single gene transcription. all CHO cells were cultured in 10 cm dishes as biological triplicates. the parental cell line was treated with 10 M of N-[(3,5-Difluorophenyl)acetyl]-L-alanyl-2-phenyl]glycine -1,1-dimethylethyl ester (DAPT) for 24 hrs. a single round of amplification was performed with 3 g of total RNA using the MessageAmp RNA Amplification Kit. 5 g of amplified RNA was mixed with 9 g random primers (Cat.
