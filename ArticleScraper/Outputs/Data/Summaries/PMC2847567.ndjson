{"summary": "the nucleolus is a highly dynamic multifunctional subnuclear compartment. it is the site of ribosomal RNA synthesis and ribosomal subunits assembly. the nucleolus is increasingly recognized as a critical regulator of many other cellular functions. cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI = 3) with the human influenza A/Udorn/72(H3N2) strain (designated Udorn), the avian influenza A/Turkey/Italy/977/V99(H7N1) strain (designated 977) and the avian influenza A/Turkey/Italy/4426/00(H7N1) strain (designated 4426) cells were in NS1 proteins of the other viruses tested did not accumulate in the nucleolus of mammalian cells irrespective of the time post-infection (Figure 1). NS1 of all viruses used in this study accumulated in the nucleolus of primary duck embryonic fibroblasts (DEF) and primary chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) at 4 hpi. we infected two-week old pekin ducks orally with 107 pfu of the 977 virus. previous experiments performed with this virus had shown that the ileum and the colon were the major sites of virus replication. anti-NS1 antibodies detected with a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody revealed with diaminobenzidine stained the cytoplasm. nucleophosmin localizes nucleophosmin (NPM), a nucleolar protein that localizes to the granular centre of the nucleolus. in DEF, NS1 of both viruses colocalized with NPM. the intensity of nucleolar staining eventually became indistinguishable from the nucleoplasmic NS1 staining between 8 and 12 hpi. changes in the nucleolar morphology appeared between 8 and 12 hpi. changes in the nucleolar morphology appeared between 8 and 12 hpi. this was a stage in the virus life cycle where cytopathic effects, such as membrane blebbing became visible. Alternatively, displacement of NPM from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm could be due to an interaction of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex with NPM. the avian noLS relies on an amino acid sequence that is present in all the influenza virus strains tested in this study. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
