{"summary": "the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes are the leading causes of mosquito-borne viral infection and disease in humans (1, 2). clinical disease ranges from a self-limited illness, dengue fever, to severe and potentially life-threatening disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (1\u20133) there are approximately 3 billion people in more than 120 countries at risk of DENV infection (1, 2). RT-iiPCR assay showed comparable detection endpoints with four DENV serotypes (8, 9) in testing performed with 256 clinical samples, the RT-iiPCR assay showed complete agreement (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI95%], 98.81% to 100%; = 1) with the CDC quantitative RT-PCR assay. annealing, and extension Sample + primers/TaqMan probe + enzymes. RT followed by loop-mediated isothermal amplification. self-recurring strand displacement synthesis primed by 6 primers targeting distinct sequences. the iiPCR system is unique in its employment of a thermally baffled device and a single heating source to drive Rayleigh-Bernard convection to allow the three steps of PCR to occur in different temperature zones (22, 23) since the first report of the assay in 2012, the RT-iiPCR or iiPCR system has been widely applied for rapid detection of various parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens in animals and humans. multiple DENV serotypes have been cocirculating in regions of endemicity. several RT-PCR or RT-LAMP tests have been developed in multiplex format to detect and distinguish different DENV serotypes. future development of multiplex RT-iiPCR for dengue would greatly improve its clinical applications."}
