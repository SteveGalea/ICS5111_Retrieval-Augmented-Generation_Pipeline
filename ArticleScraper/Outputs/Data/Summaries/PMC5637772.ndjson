{"summary": "a cross-sectional study was conducted in which nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients diagnosed with ILI in Kampala and Entebbe. one or more respiratory viruses were detected in 172 (46.6%) cases and their prevalence were influenza A virus (19.2%), adenovirus (8.7%), human rhinovirus A (7.9%), coronavirus OC43 (4.3%), parainfluenza virus 1 (2.7%), parainfluen little is known about the aetiologic agents of ILI in some developing countries, making it a challenge to plan and implement effective patient management and disease prevention and control efforts. surveillance and monitoring programmes for ILI scale up in many countries, primarily triggered by the increased threat of zoonosis and emergence of pandemic-prone respiratory viruses. patients of all ages presenting with ILI at sentinel surveillance sites for influenza were enrolled in this cross-sectional study between august and December 2008. a maximum of five eligible cases were enrolled on each day at each of the study sites. patient demographic characteristics and clinical history were recorded on a standardised clinical form. PCR kit was used for the detection of adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3, rhinovirus A, and coronaviruses 229E and OC43. the kit has been used elsewhere to identify respiratory viruses in similar specimens. amplicon sizes for each type of virus relative to the molecular weight marker (Seeplex\u00ae) were scored as positive for that virus. an internal positive control (Seeplex\u00ae) was also included in every assay run. commercially-available multiplex PCR kit (Seeplex\u00ae RV Detection; Seegene Inc, Rockville, MD, USA) for the detection of adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3, rhinovirus A, and coronaviruses 229E and OC43. the amplified products were observed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Specimens that had matching bands corresponding to the expected amplicon sizes for each type of virus were scored as positive for that virus. an internal positive control (Seeplex\u00ae) was also included to evaluate the amplification efficiency of each tested specimen. the most common clinical symptoms were cough (98.4%), shortness of breath (3.1%) and headache (29.0%) only 3.8% (n = 14) of the study participants reported the presence of a chronic condition or illness such as active tuberculosis, chronic cough and chest pain. 63.0% of all viral detections, including all parainfluenza viruses and 78.1% of adenovirus and 75.0% of coronavirus OC43, were detected from study participants aged 10 years or less. only Rhinovirus A and all influenza viruses were detected across all ages. there were 24 (14.0%) cases with mixed infections of two or three viruses. no patient was infected with more than three viruses. adenovirus was present in 62.5% (n = 15) of mixed infections. parainfluenza virus 1, adenovirus and rhinovirus A 1 Source: Authors\u2019 own construction All patients were seen at the study centres. both genders represented in almost equal proportions. most common clinical symptoms were cough (98.4%), shortness of breath (43.1%) and headache (29.0%) only 3.8% (n = 14) reported the presence of a chronic condition or illness such as active tuberculosis, chronic cough and chest pain. no patient was infected with more than three viruses. there were 24 cases with mixed infections of two or three viruses. most frequent mixtures were adenovirus and rhinovirus A. the identified aetiologies include influenza A and B virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus A, coronavirus OC43 and 229E, parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus A and B and human metapneumovirus. most of the detected viruses, including parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3, influenza B virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses OC43 and the higher prevalence observed for this virus could be attributed to the timing of this study which was conducted when rainfall is highest in the same population. rhinovirus A was detected at 7.9% which is lower than the 10 % \u2013 25% prevalence levels found in other ILI surveillance studies within sub-Saharan tropics. only nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, possibly missing viruses in the lower respiratory tract. the study period was limited to four months and epidemiological aspects associated with these viruses could not be established."}
