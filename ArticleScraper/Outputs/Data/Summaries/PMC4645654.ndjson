{"summary": "a key event in the emergence of new diseases often involves evolution of the viral genome in a way that renders it compatible with the receptor ortholog encoded by a new host species. the new world arenavirus phylogeny has four major clades, A, B, A/B recombinant, and C. common species such as the house mouse (Mus musculus) or the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), they could become a global threat of immense proportions. the clade B arenaviruses enter host cells via the host-encoded transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) (14) the primary function of TfR1 is to mediate the uptake of iron-loaded transferrin, and to a lesser extent H-ferritin (15), the TfR1s of brown rats and house mice have been found to be nonfunctional entry receptors for all clade B arenaviruses tested (19, 21, 22, 24) carnivore parvoviruses and rodent mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-like retroviruses also use TfR1 to enter cells. positive selection analysis has proven extraordinarily accurate in identifying species-specific motifs in entry receptors that govern interactions with viruses. but it remains to be explored whether positive selection analysis could add value to our current understanding of the arenavirus-binding surface of TfR1 and the species specificity of this interaction. binding energies between modeled TfR1 variants and Machupo virus GP1 are calculated using the Rosetta interface scoring function (35, 36) our results suggest a combination of positive selection analysis, structural modeling, and experimental verification may provide an efficient approach for screening and assessing potential spillover risks of viruses circulating in animal populations. site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create the rat-long TfR1 mutant using primers 5\u2032-GGTGACCATAAATTCAGGTAATGGCGTATACCTAGTGTTATGGC and 3\u2032-CCTCAGGAGCCTCTCTGAGGGTTATGTGGC. mutagenesis was performed on human TfR1 to introduce the L212V mutation (28) cells were infected with 2 ml of medium containing 125 to 1,000 l of virus. cells were spinoculated at 1,200 g for 90 min at 30\u00b0C. twenty-four hours after infection, medium was removed. cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) two days postinfection, cells were triedpsinized, treated with 1% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. cells were labeled using a FLAG antibody conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC; Abcam; catalog no. ab72569) a template to amplify the TfR1 soluble portion was then joined by PCR to a gene block (IDT) containing the human preprolactin signal sequence (residues 1 to 34), pCR8 (Invitrogen) and then Gateway cloned (Invitrogen) into the mammalian expression vector pLPCX. a pCDM8 plasmid encoding Machupo virus GP1 fuse the bead-supernatant slurry was passed through 5-ml gravity flow columns. the column was washed with 10 ml of wash buffer (20 mM imidazole, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl) eluted from the column with elution buffer (250 mM imidazole, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl) the bead-supernatant mix was passed through a 5-ml gravity flow column (Thermo) the column was washed with 15 ml wash buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, plus 0.5 M NaCl) and subsequently washed with 15 ml PBS, pH 7.4. transferrin-HRP was incubated with 1 mM FeCl(III) for 1 h at room temperature. iron-loaded transferrin-HRP was added to the ELISA wells. wells were washed and 50 l of TMB substrate was added to the wells. we made 100 models using the basic MODELLER homology modeling protocol. then used the loop modeling protocol to remodel the loops for each modeled mutant structure. we then redocked each of these 100 modeled complexes using rigid-body moves. for each input structure obtained from MODELLER, we generated 100 = 10,000 docked complexes for each modeled TfR1. lower interface scores indicate tighter binding affinity. human embryonic kidney 293T cells (ATCC) and canine osteosarcoma D17 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create the rat-short TfR1 mutant using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) primers 5\u2032-GGTGACCATAAATGTAATGGTAATGGCGTATACCTAGTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG cells were spinoculated at 1,200 g for 90 min at 30\u00b0C. twenty-four hours after infection, medium was removed. fresh medium containing 1.0 g/ml puromycin was added to select for transduced cells. cells were culated with centrifugation at 1,200 g for 90 min at 30\u00b0C. after spinoculation, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. two days postinfection, cells were triedpsinized, treated with 1% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. a pCDM8 plasmid encoding Machupo virus GP1 fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin (IgG1) protein was received from Sheli Radoshitzky (14) this fusion protein was expressed in Expi293F cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. supernatant was collected following TfR1 production in Expi293F cells. bead-supernatant slurry was passed through 5-ml gravity flow columns. column was washed with 10 ml of wash buffer (20 mM imidazole, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl) eluted from column with elution buffer (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM KH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl) the bead-supernatant mix was passed through a 5-ml gravity flow column (Thermo) the column was washed with 15 ml wash buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, plus 0.5 M NaCl) and then washed with 15 ml PBS, pH 7.4. the sample was buffer exchanged into PBS (pH 7.4) to reduce the MgCl concentration to 10 mM and flash-frozen for storage. the reaction was quenched with 2 M H2SO4, and the plate was read at 450 nm. curves were fitted using 4-parameter nonlinear regression. we assessed binding affinity in the TfR1-Machupo virus GP1 interface. sequence alignment using the TfR1s of rat, mouse, human, and C. callosus using the software program MAFFT. we gave the aligned sequences of the target TfR1 and the human TfR1 to MODELLER as the input alignment for modeling. a step to refine the docked orientation of the Machupo virus GP1 relative to the new TfR1. for each input structure obtained from MODELLER, we generated 100 docked complexes, for a total of 100 100 = 10,000 docked complexes for each modeled TfR1. lower interface scores indicate tighter binding affinity. an extended region of TfR1 determines species specificity of Machupo virus entry. an alignment of one portion of the TfR1 apical domain is shown for host and nonhost species. the amino acid numbering corresponds to human TfR1. the residue positions mutated in the rat-long chimera are shown in brown. cells were monitored for GFP expression to determine the percentage of infected cells. a t test was performed to determine if differences between mean values were statistically significant (*, 1e8) house mouse TfR1 has a variant amino acid at position 348 that is not shared by most other rodent TfR1s, or by the human TfR1. we used the TfR1 from the Machupo virus rodent host, Calomys callosus, as our permissive control TfR1. in the first chimera, termed rat-long, we swapped five amino acid residues in rat TfR1 (SNIDP) all TfR1 receptors were fused to a C-terminal FLAG tag that is localized extracellularly when the receptor is embedded in the cellular membrane. the receptor expression at the cell surface was detected by flow cytometry using a FLAG antibody. the rat-long mutant, whose design was influenced by the evolutionary signatures found in TFR1, had an entry phenotype similar to that of the C. callosus TfR1. we purified a portion of the Machupo virus GP1 (residues 79 to 248) fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1. despite repeated attempts, we were unable to express and purify the C. callosus TfR1 as a positive control. the Machupo virus GP1 loop 10 and surrounding residues are shown in light pink where divergence in structure is seen in the Chapare virus GP1. similar results were seen with Sabia and Junin virus models. virus pseudotyped with Sabia (C) or Chapare (D) virus glycoprotein (GP) cells were monitored for GFP expression to determine the percentage of infected cells. errors indicate standard deviations from three technical replicates. rat TfR1s was not a result of this elongated GP1 motif, we tested entry of Chapare virus. this virus entered cells equally through the rat-short and rat-long TfR1s. rat-short and rat-long TfR1s permitted less viral entry than did the C. callosus TfR1. ELISA results underestimate binding due to a high off-rate that may not be as relevant to entry. compared the relative binding affinities of the purified human L212 and L212V TfR1s to Machupo virus GP1. ELISA compared the relative binding affinities of purified human L212 and L212V TfR1 to iron-loaded human transferrin. the experiment was performed 2 times with similar results seen in the two experiments. we used the Machupo virus GP1-human TfR1 cocrystal structure (PDB code 3KAS) and MODELLER (38, 39) to build homology models of Machupo virus GP1-TfR1 complexes. the substitutions in TfR1 that we modeled were the same species variants, alleles, and chimeric constructs functionally tested above. we then fine-tuned these models through redocking with RosettaD each box plot shows the distribution of the interface scores for each variant. the red, yellow, and green color coding refers to the ability of each TfR1 to act as a receptor for Machupo virus. the mouse-human TfR1 became fully functional for virus entry only when another mutation, K348N, was also included. the model predicted that rat-long TfR1 binds to Machupo virus with an affinity greater than that of rat TfR1 but was not predicted to bind differently than rat-short TfR1. we found that we could reasonably model Machupo virus binding to TfR1 in a way that is predictive of whether the virus would be able to enter cells through the TfR1s of different species. the cocrystal structure between Machupo virus GP1 and human TfR1 shows that these residues lie predominantly on a beta strand of TfR1 (brown residues in Fig. 2B) in a binding interface where multiple motifs contribute to intermolecular interactions. we hypothesize that the species specificity of TfR1 for virus entry might be influenced by TfR1 residues slightly outside the region previously defined. the interaction between Machupo virus GP1 and the human TfR1 apical domain (gray) is shown in green and brown. canine D17 cells were transduced to stably express the wild-type and chimeric TfR1s with C-terminal FLAG tags. GP1 was incubated at decreasing concentrations to determine binding affinities. curves were fitted using 4-parameter nonlinear regression. we used the TfR1 from the brown rat instead of the house mouse. chimera contains the entire stretch of C. callosus TfR1. the region is 11 amino acids long in human TfR1 and 10 amino acids long in rodent TfR1. the canine TfR1 is not a functional receptor for arenaviruses. the rat-short TfR1 chimera allowed a moderate amount of entry, greater than that with rat TfR1. the rat-long mutant had an entry phenotype similar to that of the C. callosus TfR1. however, in some contexts other amino acids may also play a role. both rat-long TfR1 and human TfR1 bound much more tightly to GP1 with EC50s of 2.37 0.18 nM and 2.81 0.12 nM respectively. affinities between arenavirus GP and TfR1 correlate with cellular entry, as shown here and previously (18, 19, 21, 22, 40) alignment was generated using MAFFT (47, 48) canine D17 cells were transduced to stably express the wild-type and chimeric TfR1s with C-terminal FLAG tags. cells were infected with increasing volumes of GFP-encoding retrovirus pseudotyped with Sabia virus glycoprotein (C) rat-short and rat-long TfR1s supported equal levels of entry of Sabia virus. a human SNP in the arenavirus-binding region of TfR1, L212V, was found to reduce entry by Machupo virus (28). a human SNP in the arenavirus-binding region of TfR1, L212V, was found to reduce entry by Machupo virus (28). the EC50s of L212 and L212V TfR1 binding to GP1 were 2.1 0.37 nM and >1 M respectively. this still appears to result in a modest amount of virus entry. ELISA results underestimate binding due to a high off-rate that may not be as relevant to entry. ELISA comparing relative binding affinities of purified human L212 and L212V TfR1 to Machupo virus GP1. GP1 was then incubated at decreasing concentrations to determine binding affinities. Error bars indicate standard deviations from three technical replicates. we used the Machupo virus GP1-human TfR1 cocrystal structure (PDB code 3KAS) and MODELLER (38, 39) to build homology models of Machupo virus GP1-TfR1 complexes. the substitutions were the same species variants, alleles, and chimeric constructs functionally tested above. we then fine-tuned these models through redocking with RosettaDock. the redocking procedure yields a characteristic \u201cbinding funnel\u201d of low-energy conformations at around an 8- root mean square deviation (RMSD) relative to the starting position before docking. each dot shows the Rosetta interface score and the RMSD from the undocked configuration for one of the 10,000 docked models that we generated. the model accurately predicted the better binding of Machupo virus GP1 to wild-type human TfR1 than to the TfR1 L212V variant. rat-long TfR1 was accurately predicted to bind Machupo virus with an affinity greater than that of rat TfR1 but was not predicted to bind differently than rat-short TfR1. this work has uncovered potential evolutionary trade-offs in the TfR1-arenavirus system. a human SNP in TfR1 offers resistance to one virus while making the receptor more vulnerable to other viruses. this mechanism, however, would create a population that is potentially more vulnerable to the zoonotic transmission of other viruses. the use of evolutionary analyses to finely map the viral interactions surfaces on entry receptors seems to be accurate in many contexts. similar phenomena have also been described for XPR1 gammaretrovirus receptors of rodents and birds (42, 43) the docking method described here is much less computationally expensive. a cocrystal structure of the interacting proteins in complex is required. this procedure was more accurate for the host protein, TfR1, than for the viral protein, GP1. mutations in viral surface glycoproteins could be tested in this model. the results with the L212V TfR1 SNP suggest that this model can be used to quickly predict the functional effects of human or rodent SNPs."}
