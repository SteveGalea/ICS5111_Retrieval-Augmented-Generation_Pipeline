{"summary": "corticosteroids have been used as an adjunct therapy for severe infection for roughly half a century. in the era of powerful antibiotics, the likelihood of uncontrolled infection and bacterial proliferation has become less significant. uncontrolled and overwhelming systemic inflammation is likely the main pathogenetic culprit for progression to organ failure and death in infected patients. corticosteroid treatment in community-acquired pneumonia dates back to the 1950s. in septic shock, 101 of 300 patients had community-acquired pneumonia. corticosteroid-treated patients had improved survival with a hazard ratio of 0.55. corticosteroids may favor the onset of gastroduodenal bleeding, superinfection, metabolic disorders, and muscle weakness. a recent systematic review on the use of corticosteroids for severe sepsis and septic shock failed to show any evidence for an increased risk of bleeding, superinfection, or neuromuscular weakness."}
