{"summary": "TEXT Enterovirus A71 (EV71) is a small virus (30 nm) with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 7.4 kb that belongs to the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae (1, 2). EV71 is the etiologic agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), a mild syndrome that most frequently affects children younger than 6 years. EV71 can also cause severe compounds were shown to inhibit an early step in the replication cycle of HIV by interacting with glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 of the HIV envelope. further exploration in virus-cell-based assays for broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other viruses did not reveal any inhibitory activity. strain of EV71 in RD cellsa Compound EC50 (M) CC50 (M) SI 1 10 1b >37 >3.7 2 3.5 0.3b 45 2b 13 3 3.9 0.2b 67 1b 17 4 >39 90 2b ND 5 0.9 0.1b >38 >42 6 0.8 0.1b 28 13b 35 7 1.9 0.1b 32 1b 17 8 14 1b 22 1b 1.5 9 >120 >120 ND 10 >98 >98 compound 12, which has a central pentaerythritol scaffold and 12 Trp residues on the periphery, was synthesized. the flexibility of the central scaffold does not appear to have a pronounced impact on antiviral activity. this compound was prepared using a strategy similar to that previously reported for HIV (13). a representative panel of enteroviruses Species Virus Host cell EC50 (M)a Enterovirus A Enterovirus A71 BrCr strain RD 0.29 0.07b Enterovirus B Coxsackievirus B3 Nancy strain Vero Ac >28 Echovirus 11 Gregory strain BGMd 1.3 0.2b Enterovirus C Poliovirus 1 Sabin strain BGM >28 Enterovirus D68 CU70 strain HeLa Rh 6.0 2.1b Rhino both compound 12 and pirodavir lost their moderate activity when added after the infection period. the viral 3C protease inhibitor rupintrivir lost its activity when added 6 or 7 h after infection. a new class of potent, selective, specific, and early-stage inhibitors of enterovirus replication has been discovered. a new dendrimer with a central pentaerythritol scaffold was synthesized. this compound proved to be exquisitely active against clinical isolates of EV71. supplementary material Supplemental material supp_60_8_5064__index.html (974B, html)."}
