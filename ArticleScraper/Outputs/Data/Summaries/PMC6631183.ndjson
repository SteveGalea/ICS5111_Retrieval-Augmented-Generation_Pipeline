{"summary": "researchers have characterized emerging infectious diseases from viruses such as human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) [1] and SARS coronavirus (CoV) [2,3], and bacteria such as Escherichia coli O104:H4 in Germany and France [4,5]. Approximately 75% of emerging pathogens have their origin in non-human reservoir hosts and are classic examples of zoonoses. conflict and an unsafe public health response environment have led to a significant increase of known cases to over 1000. advancing genomic sequencing capabilities are used to generate increasing amounts of data about bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms in different locations. advancing genomic sequencing capabilities are used to generate increasing amounts of data about bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms in different locations. the existence of research, biosurveillance platforms, and official reporting mechanisms for infectious disease events does not necessarily indicate that these activities intersect and inform each other. the results of this basic and applied research are published in scientific articles and discussed at scientific conferences, and genetic sequences and other similar information are deposited in databases. the disconnect between research investment in human and animal health decision-making may limit some early detection and response activities needed to prevent and control infectious disease outbreaks. this article describes the current state of scientific input in the public health decision-making process and highlights the different types of organizations involved in communicating scientific information before and during outbreaks. the GHSA and IHR provide a defined process for the generation and reporting of public health emergencies of potential international concern. no clear process exists for compiling and evaluating previously published scientific data to inform public health decision-making. this situation may result in policy-makers developing trusted relationships with individuals and organizations with biases. information inconsistent with beliefs, traditions, or political agendas may be disregarded and discredited to maintain cultural and social realities. more complete data sets, more objective communication of the data, and clearer descriptions of the uncertainty of the data may engender greater confidence in the information contributing to the decision-making process. uncertainty in known data also may lead decision-makers to question the utility of the scientific data. the GHSA and IHR provide a defined process for the generation and reporting of public health emergencies of potential international concern. no clear process exists for compiling and evaluating previously published scientific data to inform public health decision-making. limitations in effective translation of scientific information determine its use in decision-making. if information is perceived as partial or highly uncertain, decision-makers may question the utility of the data or disregard it completely. data inconsistent with beliefs, traditions, or political agendas may be disregarded and discredited to maintain cultural and social realities. the lack of cross-pollination of disciplines and sectors is difficult to achieve. under-resourced individuals and organizations may not have the capacity to conduct needed scientific assessments and communicate results to key audiences. if filled, uncertainty associated with modeling and data analysis decreases. science, and cultural anthropology are essential for understanding how humans interact with their environments and how these interactions facilitate the emergence of previously unknown, wildlife-derived pathogens in the human population [54,55,56,57,58]. similar trends can be observed with integration of social and biomedical sciences research, where research on behavioral change can inform compliance with medical interventions [59,60,61]. communication clearly and concisely to public health decision-makers is important for translating research investments to public health practice [62]. Applied research may identify measures that enhance current risk management efforts. a lack of cultural awareness about local end-of-life traditions led to ineffective or unintentionally dangerous public health interactions. a lack of cultural awareness about local end-of-life traditions led to ineffective or unintentionally dangerous public health interactions and undocumented infections. social science research can promote the development and implementation of clinical and public health research that takes into account the culture, society, and benefits to and needs of research participants. the lack of cross-pollination of disciplines and sectors is difficult to achieve because of a lack of cross-pollination of disciplines and sectors. investments in cross-disciplinary research on ecology, wildlife and domestic animals, human health, behavioral sciences, implementation science, and cultural anthropology are essential for understanding how humans interact with their environments. research on behavioral change can inform compliance with medical interventions [59,60,61] Applied research may identify measures that enhance current risk management efforts. a lack of cultural awareness about local end-of-life traditions led to ineffective or unintentionally dangerous public health interactions. a lack of cultural awareness about local end-of-life traditions led to ineffective or unintentionally dangerous public health interactions and undocumented infections. a focus on the bioethics of disaster research has prompted non-governmental and governmental organizations to evaluate challenges and identify solutions to promote ethical practices in research during public health emergencies. the proposed solutions could improve communication between researchers and decision-makers and enhance translation of research investments to inform public health practice before, during, and after emergencies. better articulation and dissemination of existing scientific knowledge and modeling approaches would enable researchers to communicate scientific information more effectively. understanding what is required of data and how data are best communicated in public health emergencies would provide researchers with the necessary operational context in which decision-makers must evaluate and base their decisions. funding is available for basic research for a majority of infectious diseases, particularly neglected tropical diseases and wildlife-associated, epizootic (animal only) diseases. limited funding opportunities exist for multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral research and education; limited support is provided for social science research that is relevant to prevention and mitigation of infectious disease outbreaks. funders should establish a process through which the results and assessments can be communicated to public health decision-makers. new data protection laws may counteract these open access policies of funders and journals. national policies restricting data access and sharing to foreign entities present new challenges to equitable and reciprocal data sharing. approaches for improving communication between researchers and policy-makers could help promote research that addresses key knowledge gaps in health security policy and practice. researchers can identify, integrate and distill data of greatest relevance to the specific emergency. effective communication can be achieved through active interaction or written documents. interactions through networks, such as the GHSA and associated groups, could promote open lines of communication between governmental health security officials and scientists. government agencies, intergovernmental organizations, private funders, and philanthropic organizations should develop forward-looking, longer-term initiatives that support basic and applied research in a variety of natural and social sciences. long-term studies have produced a great deal of information relevant to public health [82], including changing infection prevalence with species richness [83], the preponderance of infected males [84], and the role of climatic changes in causing fluctuations in rodent reservoir populations. funders should establish a process through which the results and assessments can be communicated to public health decision-makers. new data protection laws may counteract these open access policies of funders and journals. national policies restricting data access and sharing to foreign entities present new challenges to equitable and reciprocal data sharing. despite these efforts, national policies restricting data access and sharing to foreign entities present new challenges to equitable and reciprocal data sharing. overcoming these barriers is necessary to prevent and mitigate emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. the public health burden caused by influenza virus has led to the creation of collaborating centers through which data on naturally circulating strains and results from basic and applied research are shared."}
