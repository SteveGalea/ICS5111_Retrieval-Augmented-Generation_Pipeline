{"summary": "influenza virus is an enveloped virus with an eight-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. the virus causes a highly contagious disease of the human upper respiratory tract. the recognition of viruses plays a key role in limiting virus replication and inflammatory responses at early stages of infection. several distinct inflammasomes, including the NLRP3 inflammasome, the NLRP1 inflammasome, the absent-in-melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome, and the interferon gamma (IFN-)-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) inflammasome, are involved in viral recognition (7). each of these viruses has developed strategies to evade host innate immune recognition systems. the NS1 protein of influenza virus inhibits virus-induced IL-1 secretion following activation of caspase-1 (35), the precise mechanism by which it achieves this is unclear. the precise mechanism by which it achieves this is unclear. cDNAs encoding the influenza virus NS1 proteins of PR8 (H1N1) and A/Narita/1/2009 (H1N1) were obtained by reverse transcription and PCR. cDNAs encoding the influenza virus NS1 proteins of PR8 (H1N1) and A/Narita/1/2009 (H1N1) were obtained. lentiviruses expressing the influenza virus NS1 protein were cloned into the pLenti6.3/V5-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) 293FT cells cultured in a collagen-coated 10-cm dish were transfected with 3 g of NS1 protein-expressing pLenti6.3/V5-TOPO vector. lentivirus encoding an irrelevant protein (EGFP) served as a control. cell-free supernatants were collected at 18 to 24 h postinfection or at 6 h after stimulation with LPS plus ATP. cells were lysed by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing in PBS containing 2% FBS. the supernatant was incubated for 60 min at 4\u00b0C with protein G-Sepharose. complexes were obtained by centrifugation and washed three times with coimmunoprecipitation buffer. the polypeptides within the precipitated complexes were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) hek293T cells were transfected with pCA7-NLRP3 (30 ng), pCA7-ASC (5 ng), pCA7-procaspase-1 (5 ng) and pCA7-pro-IL-1 (150 ng) and 500 ng of either pCA7-EGFP, pCA7-hUCP-2 (where hUCP-2 is human UCP-2) or pCA7-NS1 using polyethy HEK293T cells were transfected with pCA7-NLRP3 (30 ng), pCA7-ASC (5 ng), pCA7-procaspase-1 (500 ng), and pCA7-pro-IL-1 (150 ng) and 500 ng of either pCA7-EGFP, pCA7-Flag-NS1, pCA7-Flag-R38A/K41A or pCA7-Flag- ouse IgG(H+L) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) antibodies (Life Technologies) were seeded on coverslips and transfected with 0.5 g each of pCA7-myc-NS1 or pCA7-PB1-F2 proteins. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed and permeabilized with PBS containing 4% formaldehyde and cDNAs encoding the influenza virus NS1 proteins of PR8 (H1N1) and A/Narita/1/2009 (H1N1) were obtained by reverse transcription and PCR of total RNA extracted from influenza virus-infected MDCK cells. cDNAs encoding the influenza virus NS1 proteins of PR8 (H1N1) and A/Narita/1/2009 (H1N1) were obtained. cDNA encoding NS1 protein was cloned into pLenti6.3/V5-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) 293FT cells cultured in a collagen-coated 10-cm dish were transfected with 3 g of NS1 protein expressing the influenza virus NS1 protein. ivirus encoding an irrelevant protein (EGFP) served as a control. the stock virus, containing Polybrene (10 g/ml), was then inoculated into J774A.1 or MDCK cells. cells were cultured for 2 to 3 weeks in complete DMEM for 18 to 24 h. in 24-well cluster plates were cotransfected with 0.5 g each of pCA7-EGFP, pCA7-Flag-NLRP3, pCA7-Flag-ASC, or pCA7-Flag-RIG-I. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 500 l of 1 TNT buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, phoresis (PAGE) (10 to 15% gels) electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore) membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IL-1 (Chemicon), mouse anti-influenza A virus M2 (14C2; Abcam), mouse anti-influenza A virus NS1 (NS1-23-1; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-tubulin ( HEK293T cells grown to 90% confluence in 24-well cluster plates were transfected with pCA7-NLRP3 (30 ng), pCA7-ASC (5 ng), pCA7-procaspase-1 (5 ng), and pCA7-pro-IL-1 (150 ng) and 500 ng of either pCA7-EGFP, pCA7-hUCP-2 or pCA7-NS1 using PEI Max. cells were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with 0.5 g each of pCA7-myc-NS1, pCA7-Flag-NS1, pCA7-PB1-F2 or control plasmid (empty vector) at 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed and permeabilized with PBS containing 4% formaldehyde and 1% Triton X-100. fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) stained nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole. stained cells were then observed under a confocal microscope. NS1 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 secretion. hek293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding either NLRP3, ASC, procaspase-1, pro-IL-1, and human UCP-2 (hUCP-2) or NS1. pCA7-EGFP was used as a control. NS1 protein secreted significantly less IL-1 in response to NS1 virus or LPS plus ATP (NLRP3 agonist) than control cells. NS1 protein inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 secretion. hek293T cells were infected with wild-type influenza virus lacking the NS1 gene (NS1) cells stably expressing EGFP or NS1 were stimulated with NS1 or ATP. data are expressed as means standard deviations. similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. cells were stained with anti-myc, anti-PB1-F2, and anti-Tom20 (mitochondrion marker) antibodies. HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding influenza virus PB1-F2 or NS1. similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. pCA7-EGFP was used as a control. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding NLRP3. pCA7-EGFP was used as a control. transfection of HeLa cells with EGFP-tagged NLRP3 and Flag-tagged ASC led to a single-speck formation. NLRP3 and ASC formed discrete specks when HeLa cells were cotransfected with EGFP-tagged NLRP3 and ASC. the NS1 protein of influenza virus inhibits a single-speck formation. NS1 protein from all five viral strains significantly inhibited NLRP3-mediated IL-1 secretion compared with the level in EGFP-transfected cells. NS1 protein from different strains suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 secretion. HEK293T cells were transfected as described for panel A. plasmids encoding NLRP3, ASC, procaspase-1, pro-IL-1, and EGFP. IL-1 was analyzed by ELISA. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding NLRP3, ASC, procaspase-1, and pro-IL-1 together with mutant NS1. hek293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding NLRP3, ASC, procaspase-1, and pro-IL-1 together with WT or mutant NS1. hek293T cells were transfected as described for panel B HEK293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding NLRP3 together with flag-tagged wild-type or mutant NS1. at 24 h posttransfection, proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody followed by immunoblotting of total lysate (Input) and immunoprecipitates with anti-Flag or anti-NLRP3 antibodies. transfection of HEK293T cells with human uncoupling protein-2 (hUCP-2) reduced (m) via proton leakage (44, 45), suppressed IL-1 secretion. NS1 protein significantly inhibited IL-1 secretion without affecting expression of pro-IL-1 in the cytosol. bone marrow-derived pDCs produced more IFN- in response to mutant NS1 virus than in response to wild-type influenza virus in vitro. IL-1 secretion by EGFP-expressing and NS1 protein-expressing J774A.1 macrophages stably expressing the NS1 protein. NS1 protein inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 secretion. cell-free supernatants were collected at 24 h poststimulation and analyzed for IL-1 by ELISA. similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. the mitochondrial membrane potential is not affected by the NS1 protein. NS1 protein inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 secretion. cells were transfected with an expression plasmid encoding influenza virus PB1-F2 or myc-tagged NS1. cells were stained with anti-myc, anti-PB1-F2, and anti-Tom20 antibodies. NS1 protein inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 secretion. hek293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids. pCA7-EGFP was used as a control. the lack of a single-speck formation correlates with a loss of IL-1 processing in response to NLRP3 agonists in RAW264.7 cell (47). to this end, we cotransfected HeLa cells with EGFP-tagged NLRP3 and Flag-tagged ASC to visualize speck formation. the NS1 protein of influenza virus inhibits a single-speck formation. the NS1 protein from all five viral strains inhibited NLRP3-mediated IL-1 secretion compared with the level in EGFP-transfected cells. this inhibity effect was due to suppression of NLRP3 expression in BM/1918 NS1-transfected cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding NLRP3, ASC, procaspase-1, pro-IL-1, and NS1 from different virus strains as indicated. pCA7-EGFP was used as a control. cells were collected at 24 h posttransfection, and IL-1 was analyzed by immunoblotting. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding NLRP3, ASC, procaspase-1, pro-IL-1, and either EGFP, Flag-tagged WT, R38A/K41A, or E96A/E97A NS1. NS1 mutants failed to associate with NLRP3 and NLRP3 (Fig. 7D) cell-free supernatants were collected at 24 h posttransfection. pCA7-EGFP was used as a control. cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding NLRP3. viroporins of RNA viruses, such as influenza virus M2 protein (15), EMCV 2B protein (19), rhinovirus 2B protein (20) induce IL-1 secretion. other studies suggest viral RNA is involved in NLRP3- or RIG-I-mediated inflammasome activation. NS1 protein suppressed expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 secretion. other NS1 proteins did not change expression levels of NLRP3 or (m) instead, RNA-binding domain and TRIM25-binding domain are required for suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1 secretion. a viral homolog of human NLRP1 inhibits inflammasome activation by interacting with NLRP1 or NLRP3. the pyrin domain-containing M13L protein of myxoma virus interacts with ASC and inhibits inflammasome activation. the interaction is not dependent on homologous conserved sequences."}
