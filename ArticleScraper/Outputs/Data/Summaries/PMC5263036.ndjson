{"summary": "141 (87%) patients were prescribed one antihistamine of any group. 141 (37%) patients were prescribed two or more antihistamines. URI is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in humans. most of the upper respiratory infections are viral in origin. there is currently no targeted antiviral for URI. commonly used medications include antipyretics, antihistamines and alpha-adrenergic agonist. common cold medication had some evidence for symptomatic relief for adults with URI, through the benefit may be outweighed by the adverse side effects and potential risks. the use of common cold medications such as codeine may be associated with adverse drug effects and even mortality. the eligible cases were searched from the hospital electronic record database by the Clinical Data Analysis & Reporting System (CDARS) the included ICD-9 codes were 462 (acute pharyngitis), 463 (acute tonsillitis), 381 and 382 (acute otitis media), 460 (acute rhinopharyngitis), 465, 465.9 and 212.9 (non-specific upper respiratory infection) all patients aged more than 6 years were excluded. all variables were first screened through univariate analysis by Chi square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test for binary variables. independent sample t-test for continuous variables were then included. Age and gender were also included as confounding variables. for the patient group that was prescribed multiple antihistamines, the mean age was 42.7 months compared to the mean age of control group was 29.1 months. the same covariate of 39.2% in the control group was 73.3%. URI is one of the most commonly encountered clinical problem in emergency department in Hong Kong. there was no local clinical audit nor quality assurance program about the use of common cold medications including antihistamines for URI in emergency department or primary care clinic. first generation antihistamines do not alleviate nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing. newer-generation non-sedating antihistamines do not have efficacy on relieving cough symptoms. diphenhydramine is a phenothiazine derivatives and phenothiazine had antidopaminergic activity. other hypothesis include rebound increases in nigral inhibition of the basal ganglia and involvement of the aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter system have been postulated. the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) considered that there was sufficient available data from paediatric studies to conclude that cough and cold medicines are ineffective in children. the first is inappropriate dosing of cough and cold medicines. the third is possible risk with drug interaction between new generation antihistamine and macrolide to cause prolonged QTc-related arrhythmia. the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) considered that it is inappropriate to extrapolate adult efficacy data to children. it supported the advice issued by the FDA to parents and caregivers in the Public Health Advisory. steam inhalation is not suitable for children because of the risk of scalding. the prevalence of prescription of single and multiple antihistamines for URI in children aged less than 6 was 87% and 37% respectively. the prevalence of prescription of single and multiple antihistamines for URI in children aged less than 6 was 87% and 37% respectively. years of graduation from medical school of the attending physician are predictors of multiple antihistamine prescription. further education of the public and recommendations to the emergency physician about cautious prescription of antihistamines and common cold medications for URI in children are necessary."}
