{"summary": "AuNPs are classified as three-dimensional nanomaterials (NMs) in which at least one of the dimensions in the structure is less than 100 nm [1]. they are widely used as conductors for flexible electronics [8], catalysts for polymerization of alkylosilanes [9], detectors for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [10], contrast agents in X-ray imaging [11], vehicles for drug delivery [12], agents in photo-induced hyperthermia [ aqueous leaf extracts from blackberries, blueberries, and pomegranates. aqueous extracts originated from blackberries, blueberries, and pomegranates. aqueous extracts originated from blackberries, blueberries, and pomegranates. honey is obtained by several from about 20,000 species of bees from nectar, pollen, and honeydew. the most popular are flower, e.g., multi-flower, rapeseed, buckwheat, lime, or heather, and honeydew honeys made from coniferous, leaf, and fir honeydew. Philip [42] used an Indian natural honey solution for the production of spherical (15 nm in size) AuNPs. sreelakshimi et al. also presented the application of an Indian honey for formation of 10 nm, spherical AuNPs with antibacterial activity. synthesis of Au nanostructures, total concentrations of reducing sugars and phenolic compounds were determined using the Bertrand\u2019s method and the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. AuNPs of defined optical and granulometric properties were tested in a microwave radiation field, simulating procedures of hyperthermia treatment of cancer. AuNPs synthesis took place at room temperature until the colour of mixed turned to ruby-red. obtained NFs were stored in the fridge at 4 \u00b0C for subsequently analyses. Optical properties of synthesized AuNPs were assessed using UV/Vis absorption spectrophotometry. resultsant NFs were diluted 10-fold, placed onto a Cu grid. the cu grid was placed in a TEM chamber. XRD was used to estimate the crystalline structure of AuNPs synthesized. honey solution was mixed with 20 mL of the Bertrand\u2019s I solution. the resultant mixture was then cooled down under cold tap water. the resultant mixture formed washed several times with warm re-distilled water by decanting over a Pyrex\u00ae Gooch crucible. to zero the instrument, re-distilled water was applied. results associated with the concentration of phenolic compounds in analyzed honey solutions were expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and given in mg of GAE per L. acid tetrahydrate (HAuCl44H2O) was from Avantor Performance Materials (Gliwice, Poland) the Bertrand\u2019s solutions, i.e., I (CuSO4), II (a mixture of NaOH and C4H4KNaO6), and III (a mixture of Fe2(SO4)3 and H2SO4) were prepared using proper reagents taken from Sigma-Aldrich. effects of the type of honey (lime, multiflower, honeydew), its concentration in prepared solutions (5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v)) and the concentration of Au(III) ions (25, 50, and 100 mgL1) were assessed using UV/Vis absorption spectrophotometry with a Specord 210 Plus spectrophotometer. symmetric /2 Bragg-Brentano geometry using a X-Pert Pro MPD diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK) equipped with a CuK radiation source. resultsant NFs were placed on a poly(methylmetacrylate) holder and left to dry in ambient air. titration was carried out until the titrated solution turned to bright pink. one mL of the titrating KMnO4 solution is associated with 6.537 g of reduced Cu(II) ions. the amount of reducing sugars in honeys solution was calculated as follows. the process of heating was experimentally developed so as to heat the AuNPs-containing NF to 45 \u00b0C within 6 min. then, temperature was maintained for another 4 min, applying a power of 15 W. results and Discussion 3.1. dew honey was observed after 5 min for mixed solution consisting of 100 mgL1 of Au(III) ions and 20% (w/v) of honeys. differences in time after which the ruby-red colour appeared in mixed solutions were directly related to differences in the concentration of chemical compounds that were responsible for the reduction of Au(III) ions. the LSPR absorption band max was 538.5 nm and was observed for conditions when the lime tree honey solution was used and its final concentration in the mixed solution was 20% (w/v) while the concentration of Au(III) ions was 25 mgL1. optimal conditions for the synthesis of AuNPs with honeydew honey solutions related to the concentration of honey and Au(III) in the mixed solution were 5% (w/v) and 50 mgL1 respectively.

XRD was used to determine the crystalline structure of AuNPs produced with the aid of solutions of multiflower and honeydew honeys. the efficiency of AuNPs synthesis appeared to be too low to collect sufficient amount of dry material. TEM gives distribution of average size by their number. volume size distribution recognizes the average size of the NPs. most intense bands (around 3270 cm1) were related to stretching vibrations of the \u2013OH group. FT-IR spectra of mixed solutions containing AuNPs were very similar to those recorded for aqueous honey solutions. the identified bands were slightly shifted towards longer wavelengths in case of mixed solutions containing synthesised AuNPs. carboxylic acids, free amino-acids, monosaccharaides (glucose, D-fructose) and proteins present in honey solutions could be responsible for the stabilization of resultant AuNPs. glucose (aldose) was found to be the main reducing agent in green synthesis of AuNPs. this was associated with the presence of the aldehyde group. reducing sugars were crucial for determining the size of resultant AuNPs. AuNPs obtained with the aid of multiflower and honeydew honeys were heated to 45 \u00b0C in about 5 min. NFs with AuNPs were heated to temperatures 14\u201315 \u00b0C greater than the temperature of water. microwave-induced heating curves recorded for water and the nanofluid containing AuNPs obtained with the aid of a multiflower honey solution. the first indication that AuNPs were fruitfully synthesized with the aid of honey solutions was the change of colour of the mixed solutions. mixed solution consisting 100 mgL1 of Au(III) ions and 20% (w/v) of honeys. differences in time after which the ruby-red colour appeared in mixed solutions were directly related to differences in the concentration of chemical compounds. localized surface resonance of plasmonic AuNPs was responsible for their optical properties in visible light. mixed solution was 20% (w/v) while the concentration of Au(III) ions was 25 mgL1. optimal conditions for synthesis of AuNPs with honeydew honey solutions were 5% (w/v) and 50 mgL1 respectively. 0.17 2 Lime tree 20 50 550.4 0.55 3 Lime tree 20 25 538.5 0.43 4 Lime tree 15 100 552.5 0.45 5 Lime tree 15 50 543.2 0.38 6 Lime tree 15 25 540.2 0.21 7 Lime tree 10 100 558.1 0.27 8 Lime tree 10 50 551.4 0.26 9 Lime tree 10 25 539.5 0.20 10 Lime tree 5 100 565.2 0.02 11 Lime tree 5 50 561.9 0.13 12 Lime tree 5 25 550.5 0.12 13 AuNPs produced using the honeydew honey solution were well dispersed, uniform in size, and non-aggregated. a variety of shapes, including spherical (77%), triangular (17%), polyhedral (2%), trapezoidal (3%), star-like (1%), and polyhedral (5%) were observed for these AuNPs.
