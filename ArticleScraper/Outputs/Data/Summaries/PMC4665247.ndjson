{"summary": "the known critical PRRs for RNA viruses are the RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) RIG-I and MDA5, non-RLR helicases such as DHX33 (1), and Toll-like receptors (TLRs, in particular TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8). the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a positive-sense RNA virus of Betacoronavirus lineage 2a. laboratory strains of MHV have a diverse range of cellular and organ tropisms, making them useful model organisms for studying host pathways involved in tropism barriers and virulence. MHV-A59 causes hepatitis when it infects the liver and acute encephalitis followed by chronic mice lacking MDA5 had levels of viral replication in the liver and spleen similar to those of wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) mice. the ISG response was intact, suggesting a more complicated role for MDA5-induced interferon. organs were harvested, placed in gel saline, weighed, and frozen at 80\u00b0C. total RNA was purified from the lysates of homogenized livers using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the resulting RNA was treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion) real-time PCR was performed using iQ SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad) mRNA was quantified as CT values relative to beta actin or 18S rRNA mRNA levels. wild-type and MDA5-deficient mice were infected i.p. with 500 PFU of MHV. eBioscience clone 53-6.7, CD44 (eBioscience clone IM7), CD11a (Biolegend clone M17/4), PD-1 (eBioscience clone RMP1-30), TCR (eBioscience clone H57-597), TCR (eBiolegend clone GL3), perforin (eBioscience clone HK1.4), CD11b (eBioscience clone staining for interferon gamma was performed after permeabilization with the Cytofix/cytoperm Plus fixation/permeabilization kit (BD) cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on an LSR II instrument (Becton Dickinson), and the results were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar). mice were genotyped and bred in the animal facilities of the university of Pennsylvania. for infections, virus was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed using iQ SYBR green Supermix. mRNA was quantified as CT values relative to beta actin or 18S rRNA mRNA levels. brefeldin A (20 g/ml; Sigma) and MHV peptides M133 (major histocompatibility complex class II [MHC-II]; 4 g/ml; Biosynthesis) and S598 (MHC-I; 9.3 g/ml; Biosynthesis) cells stained with antibodies: CD3 (eBioscience clone 17A2), CD4 (eBioscience clone GK1.5), CD8 (eBioscience NK1.1 (eBioscience clone PK136), CD45 (eBioscience 30-F11), CD86 (Biolegend clone GL-1), CD80 (Molecular Probes clone 16-10A1), MHC-II (eBioscience clone M5/114.15.2), B220 (Life Technologies clone RA3-6B2), and PDCA-1/CD317 (eBioscience 129c). MHV-A59 is a dualtropic strain infecting primarily the liver and the central nervous system of WT C57BL/6 mice. infection of Ifnar1/ mice results in spread to multiple organs not usually infected in immunocompetent mice. MHV replicates in the liver and several other organs of C57BL/6 (WT) mice. replication peaked at day 5 postinfection (2, 18, 19) inflammatory foci in four or five nonoverlapping fields of view, each 9 by 106 m2, were counted. in some samples, the foci had combined to form a continuous confluence covering the entirety of the section. these samples were scored as too numerous to count (TNTC) we hypothesized that mice lacking MDA5 would express less interferon, which should in turn limit the activation of transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) we isolated RNA from the livers of infected WT and MDA5/ mice collected 3, 5, and 7 days postinfection. innate inflammatory cell recruitment is intact in MDA5/ mice, but activation of dendritic cells is elevated. the loss of MDA5 signaling might cause dysregulation of the inflammatory infiltrate. innate inflammatory cell recruitment is largely intact in MDA5/ mice. activation of dendritic cells is elevated. mice were sacrificed, organs harvested, and single-cell suspensions derived from the liver (A or spleen) were immunophenotyped. lymphoid (CD3 CD19 NK1.1 CD45+ CD11c+ CD11c+ CD11b), myeloid (CD3 CD19 NK1.1 CD45+ CD11c+ CD11c+ CD11b) dendritic cells. the total number of CD80+ CD86+ DCs of each subtype is shown. the coexpression of CD80 and CD86 was higher in these populations in MDA5/ mice than in WT mice. this may suggest that T cell priming is more robust in MDA5/ animals. an MDA5-dependent defect in cytokine production could alter their efficacy without affecting the size of the populations. natural killer (CD3 NK1.1+) and natural killer T cells (CD3+ NK1.1+) were assessed. a functional T cell response is essential for clearance of MHV infection. the presence of the surface activation markers CD44 and CD11a was analyzed by flow cytometry. the percentage (A) and total number (B) of CD4 (CD3+ CD4+) and CD8 (CD3+ CD8+) T cells from MDA5/ mice showed a higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PD-1 staining. more-severe liver pathology despite comparable viral replication in MDA5/ mice suggests that PD-1 could be a marker of pathologically overactive T cells during MHV infection. a less functional T cell response that is incapable of controlling viral replication could also explain increased viral spread and decreased survival. cells were incubated with immunodominant MHV peptides S598 (class I) and M133 (class II) cells were immunophenotyped by staining with cell type-specific antibodies. cells were permeabilized and stained with antibody specific to interferon gamma and perforin. CD8 (CD3+ CD8+) T cells from the spleen and liver were assessed for expression of perforin (B) serum was collected from WT and MDA5/ mice with intact T cell compartments 3, 5 and 7 days after i.p. inoculation of 500 PFU MHV. results are nonsignificant by the Mantel-Cox test. MHV-A59 is a dualtropic strain infecting primarily the liver and central nervous system of WT C57BL/6 mice. mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar1/ mice) are acutely susceptible to MHV infection. infection of Ifnar1/ mice results in spread to multiple organs not usually infected in immunocompetent mice. MHV replicates in the liver and several other organs of C57BL/6 (WT) mice. replication peaked at day 5 postinfection (2, 18, 19) inflammatory foci in four or five nonoverlapping fields of view, each 9 by 106 m2, were counted. in some samples, the foci had combined to form a continuous confluence covering the entirety of the section. these samples were scored as too numerous to count (TNTC) we hypothesized that mice lacking MDA5 would express less interferon, which should in turn limit the activation of transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) we isolated RNA from the livers of infected WT and MDA5/ mice collected 3, 5, and 7 days postinfection. innate inflammatory cell recruitment is intact in MDA5/ mice, but activation of dendritic cells is elevated. the loss of MDA5 signaling might cause dysregulation of the inflammatory infiltrate. innate inflammatory cell recruitment is largely intact in MDA5/ mice. activation of dendritic cells is elevated. mice were sacrificed, organs harvested, and single-cell suspensions derived from the liver (A or spleen) were immunophenotyped. lymphoid (CD3 CD19 NK1.1 CD45+ CD11c+ CD11c+ CD11b), myeloid (CD3 CD19 NK1.1 CD45+ CD11c+ CD11c+ CD11b) dendritic cells. the total number of CD80+ CD86+ DCs of each subtype is shown. the coexpression of CD80 and CD86 was higher in these populations in MDA5/ mice than in WT mice. this may suggest that T cell priming is more robust in MDA5/ animals. an MDA5-dependent defect in cytokine production could alter their efficacy without affecting the size of the populations. natural killer (CD3 NK1.1+) and natural killer T cells (CD3+ NK1.1+) were assessed. a functional T cell response is essential for clearance of MHV infection. the presence of the surface activation markers CD44 and CD11a was analyzed by flow cytometry. the percentage (A) and total number (B) of CD4 (CD3+ CD4+) and CD8 (CD3+ CD8+) T cells from MDA5/ mice showed a higher mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PD-1 staining. more-severe liver pathology despite comparable viral replication in MDA5/ mice suggests that PD-1 could be a marker of pathologically overactive T cells during MHV infection. a less functional T cell response that is incapable of controlling viral replication could also explain increased viral spread and decreased survival. cells were incubated with immunodominant MHV peptides S598 (class I) and M133 (class II) cells were immunophenotyped by staining with cell type-specific antibodies. cells were permeabilized and stained with antibody specific to interferon gamma and perforin.

IFN- and IFN- activate the type I interferon receptor in an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce the expression of ISGs. this set of genes includes additional type I interferon subtypes, various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and many other effectors. despite similar levels of replication, inflammation and pathology in the liver were more severe in the absence of MDA5 signaling. we compared the host immune response to MHV between WT and MDA5/ mice. however, many aspects of the immune response are independent of type I interferon signaling. infection studies in mice genetically deficient in interferon signaling components are often confounded by the difficulty of distinguishing between tropism changes caused by disruption of barriers. MHV inoculated intracranially replicates in the central nervous system as well as in the liver, spleen, and lungs. but when inoculated i.p., it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and remains restricted to the liver, spleen, and lungs in most in several strains of MHV found an association between pathology and viral replication in the liver in WT mice (18, 19) a similar phenomenon has been reported during infection with many other pathogens, including hepatitis B and C viruses (40), dengue virus (41), and toxoplasma gondii (42). PD-1 expression correlated with a defective T cell response during acute infection with histoplasma capsulatum (43) and rabies virus (44), suggesting that PD-1 has similar roles in acute and chronic infections. however, PD-1/PD-L1 signaling was shown to improve T cell responses during acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes (45) and influenza virus (46) the low survival of MDA5/ mice is due to an immunopathological response. these findings suggest a context-dependent role for MDA5 as a negative regulator of the immune response that limits immunopathology."}
