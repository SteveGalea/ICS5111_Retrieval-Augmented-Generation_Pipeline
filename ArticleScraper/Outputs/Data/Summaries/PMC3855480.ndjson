{"summary": "cellular RNA decay machinery monitors transcripts from the time they are synthesized in the nucleus until the end of their lifespan in the cytoplasm. aberrant products of transcription initiation (e.g. PROMPTS), capping, and termination are quickly degraded by nuclear RNA quality control complexes. cytoplasmic viruses do more than simply mimic host mechanisms like polyadenylation, triple helix structures, and 5\u2032 capping to protect their transcripts from host exonucleases. viral RNA trickery is a fascinating aspect of host\u2013virus interaction that we are just beginning to understand. the repression of Xrn1 by the generation of sfRNA is very important in a flavivirus infection. disparate RNA viruses have evolved unique mechanisms by which they disarm host RNA decay pathways by inactivating or proteolytically degrading important nucleases. several cytoplasmic viruses even turn a host RNA decay factor into a stabilizing factor. e and the nuclear Orthomyxoviridae families steal the 5\u2032 capped ends of host mRNAs to incorporate this cis-acting stability element into their own transcripts. new evidence indicates that the 2\u2032-O-methylation of cap structures is read by innate immune interferon stimulated genes. cellular trans-acting factors that stabilize host transcripts are also purloined by thieving viral RNAs. encoded endonucleases are important for many aspects of viral replication. they may also create a new'sandbox' in the cytoplasm for viral RNAs. the internal cleavage of host mRNAs by disparate betacoronaviruses, influenza viruses, vaccinia viruses may force host exoribonucleases to divert their attention to degrading this large number of products of viral endonucleolytic decay. chemokines, cytokines, and cell cycle regulators can influence host gene expression. Xrn1 inhibition may lead to excessive inflammation, dysregulation of the immune response, and changes in cell growth. sfRNA-mediated inactivation of Xrn1 also required for coupling between transcription and mRNA decay. viral RNAs have evolved a wide variety of mechanisms to successfully interface with the host RNA decay machinery. some of the most important questions in this field have yet to be answered."}
