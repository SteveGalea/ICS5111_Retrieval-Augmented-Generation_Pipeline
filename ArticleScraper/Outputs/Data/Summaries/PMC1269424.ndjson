{"summary": "this review explores the Toronto critical care experience of coping in a disaster outbreak situation. the diagnosis of SARS relies on a high index of clinical suspicion because there is no early, reliable and readily available diagnostic test for the responsible virus (SARS-CoV) the development of a disaster management plan in the event of emerging diseases poses very unique challenges. the model we propose is one of a central critical care crisis team. the role of the central critical care crisis team is to coordinate the efforts of the various leaders, to avoid duplication of efforts. the importance of infection control measures, and of the development of clear protocols and training cannot be overemphasized. in some centres distrust occasionally emerged between front-line health care workers and leadership. a city-wide, consistent and regular communication strategy. there is a need to develop a team to track and follow potential epidemiological linkages quickly and engage in surveillance for de novo cases. the team will potentially have to collaborate across wide geographical regions, engage in open discussion of uncertainty, and develop a surveillance and quarantine strategy that is practical, as comprehensive as possible. internet-based technology proved invaluable during the SARS outbreak in Toronto. the establishment of such systems is one of the clear successes in the management of SARS. the establishment of such systems for communicating and sharing information, resources, data and research endeavours is one of the clear successes in the management of SARS. the education team would be responsible for the creation of educational packages that could be disseminated across many institutions. mobile educational teams can be deployed to individual institutions to meet specific needs. the team responsible for education must also be prepared to analyze its performance and devise ways to improve. staff morale was addressed in some institutions by encouraging and commending health care workers. some hospitals instituted regular group support meetings and debriefing with the help of psychiatric or emergency response crisis teams. some hospitals instituted regular group support meetings and debriefing with the help of psychiatric or emergency response crisis teams. issues of duty to care and of balancing personal risk and professional obligations remain unanswered. disaster planning must, however, consider whether such issues are likely to arise and include potential strategies to deal with them. consideration should be given to developing means to decrease anxiety regarding transmission of illness to family members. central critical care crisis team helps create more ICU resources, rapidly. the scope of future outbreaks or disasters will always be uncertain, but, potentially, critical care providers will need to be able to care for many, many more patients very quickly. a system-based disaster management plan requires unprecedented collaboration and open communication between all levels of government, health care organizations. the designation of outbreak hospitals does place a greater toll on front-line workers in these institutions. but those caring for greater numbers of SARS patients in Toronto actually experienced less anxiety in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology. designation of outbreak hospitals seems a simple solution, but it is not as easy as it appears. infection control and issues specific to ICU care and resource allocation meant that having a voice was vital. the importance of having all levels of government understand what critical care is, what our needs are, and the help we require to serve our patients now and in future is perhaps the most valuable lesson of all that we offer to our readers. there was no clear system-wide communication strategy, and rumours and speculation frequently went unchecked. a city-wide, consistent and regular communication strategy, we believe, would have minimized the distrust. a city-wide, consistent and regular communication strategy, we believe, would have minimized the distrust. in the era of global travel, it is increasingly unlikely that one centre or one country will be dealing with new emerging diseases in isolation. the establishment of such systems for communicating and sharing information, resources, data and research endeavours is one of the clear successes in the management of SARS. a disaster management plan must anticipate isolation and need for informational, psychological and emotional support for those immediately affected, including loved ones. in the era of global travel, it is increasingly unlikely that one centre or one country will be dealing with new emerging diseases in isolation. the establishment of such systems for communicating and sharing information, resources, data and research endeavours is one of the clear successes in the management of SARS. Efforts to establish such links should be made in all future outbreak situations [18]. team morale/manpower During the SARS outbreak health care providers felt isolated [22,23]. the team responsible for education must also be prepared to analyze its performance and devise ways to improve. some hospitals instituted regular group support meetings and debriefing with the help of psychiatric or emergency response crisis teams. the most effective way to provide support is not currently known. the presence of leaders who are prepared to risk their own health alongside front-line staff is another straightforward means to provide much needed support. balancing personal risk and professional obligations remain for a large part unanswered. disaster planning must consider whether such issues are likely to arise. consideration should be given to developing means to decrease anxiety regarding transmission of illness to family members. critical care providers should pre-develop engineering plans to isolate wards, rather than those developed by necessity on-the-fly in Toronto. system-based thinking may challenge even the most seasoned of critical care providers because the scope of current barriers, the number of people involved and the effort needed to get them to collaborate on such a broad scale is not something they will necessarily have experienced or tried to tackle in the past. the designation of outbreak hospitals does place a greater toll on front-line workers in these institutions. but those caring for greater numbers of SARS patients in Toronto actually experienced less anxiety in the form of post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology. such measures may also result in faster disease containment (by decreasing breaches in infection control) and better patient care as the teams become more familiar with the disease. the SARS outbreak has taught us that we can no longer accept the present need to cope and function, day in and day out. the importance of having all levels of government understand what critical care is, what our needs are, and the help we require to serve our patients now and in the future is perhaps the most valuable lesson of all that we offer to our readers."}
