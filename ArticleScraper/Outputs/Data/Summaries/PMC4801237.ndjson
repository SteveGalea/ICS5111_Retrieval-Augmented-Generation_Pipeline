{"summary": "the precise likelihood of emergence of zoonotic coronaviruses with epidemic potential similar to severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) remains unclear. both engineered viruses robustly infected human lung airway epithelial cultures, suggesting the WIV1-CoV spike protein can mediate human infection without further molecular adaptation. previous estimates of past changes in global sea level (GSL) over the Common Era have not been based on statistical syntheses of global proxy databases. authors found that over the Common Era prior to the 20th century, the amplitude of variation in GSL was very likely between 7 cm and 11 cm. 71 buried soil samples were excavated across a 25,000-square-meter area at a nearly 2-million-year-old olduvai Gorge archaeological site. the biomarker evidence indicated a varied landscape containing different types of vegetation. the thicketed area delineated by biomarkers also contained butchered animal bones and early human remains. climate warming shifted the seasonal peak of T. retortaeformis infection toward young hosts lacking a strong immune response. the study demonstrates how interactions between climate change and host immunity can affect parasite infections. dopamine in the brain decrease during the immediate withdrawal from alcohol and later increase to a hyperdopaminergic state during extended abstinence. the authors report that these results did not correlate with endocrine measures, such as melatonin, or neurophysiological measures."}
