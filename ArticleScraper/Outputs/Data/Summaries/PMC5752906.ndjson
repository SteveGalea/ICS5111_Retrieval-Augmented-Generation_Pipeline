{"summary": "traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to treat malignant tumours for a long time in china. more than two-thirds of novel anti-cancer drugs are natural. curcumin is also called diferuloylmethane and is obtained from Curcuma longa. curcumin and GA inhibited the development of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by blocking the PTEN/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. curcumin and GA were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and maintained as a stock solution at -20\u00b0C. RNA isolation and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) Total protein from cells and tissues was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) cDNA was synthesized by using Oligo-dT or specific microRNA stem loop RT primers with 1 g of total RNA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 10% SDS-PAGE (Beyotime Biotech, Shanghai, China) was used to separate equal amounts of total protein. after blocking with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h, membranes were incubated with anti-Bcl-2 (1:1,500), Bax (1:1,000), PTEN (1:500), PI3K (1:1,000), Akt (1:1,000), p-Akt (1:2,000) and GAPDH (1:1,000) positive bands were detected using an ECL kit cells were collected and stained with 5 l of FITC-Annexin V and 3 l of propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometry was used to evaluate the percentage of apoptotic cells after incubation for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the differences between groups were analysed by using Student\u2019s t-test or one-way ANOVA. P0.05 was considered statistically significant. all experiments were conducted at least three times. cDNA was synthesized by using Oligo-dT or specific microRNA stem loop RT primers with 1 g of total RNA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. qRT-PCR was performed by using the SYBR\u00ae Premix EX TaqTMIIPCR Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, a Roche LightCycler\u00ae 480 II Real-Time PCR system. the membranes were incubated with anti-Bcl-2 (1:1,500), Bax (1:1,000), PTEN (1:1,000), Akt (1:1,000), p-Akt (1:2,000) and GAPDH (1:1,000) antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. positive bands were detected using an ECL kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) flow cytometry (EPICS, Xl-4, Beckman, CA, USA) was used to evaluate the percentage of apoptotic cells after incubation for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. treated cells were stained with propidium iodide and examined with a fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometer. DNA histograms were analysed with modified software. curcumin combined with GA significantly inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells. the effects of curcumin and/or GA on HepG2 cells were assessed by MTT assays. curcumin combined with GA induced cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells. curcumin combined with GA markedly induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. curcumin combined with GA markedly induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. curcumin and/or GA markedly induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. curcumin combined with GA inhibited the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in vivo. curcumin combined with GA remarkably suppressed HCC development in vivo. curcumin combined with GA significantly inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells. curcumin combined with GA significantly inhibited cell growth in HepG2 cells. curcumin combined with GA induced cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells. curcumin- or GA-treated HepG2 cells had a significantly increased proportion of cells in the G1 phase compared with that in the NC group. curcumin combined with GA markedly induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. apoptosis rate markedly increased after treatment with curcumin or GA for 48 h. curcumin and/or GA inhibited the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in vivo. curcumin combined with GA inhibited the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in vivo. curcumin and GA suppressed PI3K, AKT and p-AKT protein expression in HCC tissues. curcumin combined with GA remarkably suppressed HCC development via the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. the effects of curcumin combined with GA on proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis in HCC cells were investigated. curcumin combined with GA significantly inhibited cell growth in HepG2 cells and induced cell cycle arrest. this study is the first to focus on the effects of GA combined with curcumin against HepG2 cells. the conclusions of the present study indicate that GA and curcumin are potential drugs for treating HCC."}
