{"summary": "experts have observed that large-scale threats from EVD are limited primarily to countries with weak public health systems. the current epidemic has supported, if not confirmed, this observation. the current epidemic has now killed more people than all previous EVD outbreaks combined. the international community should pay attention to the capacity of the local health system. a careful analysis of factors that contributed to variations in epidemic severity might lead to identification of additional characteristics to include in a ranking system. a careful analysis of factors that contributed to variations in epidemic severity might lead to identification of additional characteristics to include in a ranking system. the current epidemic began in December 2013, months before it crossed borders into both Sierra Leone and liberia. a more modern approach to global public health should de-emphasize the a priori criterion of international spread. the current epidemic began in December 2013, months before it crossed borders into both Sierra Leone and liberia. removing the requirement that an outbreak be an \u201cinternational threat\u201d will decrease delays between reporting and response and allow much needed support to at-risk countries before epidemics have reached a tipping point. there are reasons not to prematurely declare a PHEIC. the current epidemic has taught us that delaying an announcement imperils lives and health systems and, in the long run, may do more economic harm. the emergency response framework, also published by WHO, aims to grade and motivate responses to international emergencies, public health or otherwise. the 2014 west africa EVD epidemic was declared a Grade 3 international emergency on July 24, two weeks before the PHEIC was declared. similar discretion for declaring a PHEIC might help prevent the next large epidemic from gaining such momentum before the international community responds appropriately. putting money where our Mouths Are Declaring a PHEIC is a critical early step to marshal an effective response. putting money where our Mouths Are Declaring a PHEIC is a critical early step to marshal an effective response. putting money where our Mouths Are Declaring a PHEIC is a critical early step to marshal an effective response. there is no substitute for prevention Arguably the greatest lesson to emerge from the EVD epidemic is that both national ministries and the global public health community were caught off guard and unprepared. the deleterious impact on local economies is equally staggering. the world bank predicts that the three most affected countries will lose US$1.6 billion in economic growth in 2015. the EVD epidemic has brought broad realization that health systems strengthening will be crucial to realize the benefits of a global community protected against international infectious disease threats. the international public health community\u2014WHO, states, and stakeholders\u2014can learn from missteps during the early stages of the epidemic. the power of global health law and global health institutions will remain seriously unrealized and deeply compromised. the power of global health law and global health institutions will remain seriously unrealized and deeply compromised if the Ebola epidemic does not spur fundamental reform."}
