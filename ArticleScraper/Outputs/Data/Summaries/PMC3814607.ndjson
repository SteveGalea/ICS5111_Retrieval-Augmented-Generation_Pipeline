{"summary": "PEDV is a member of genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. it is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. the disease caused by PEDV was firstly observed in feeder pigs and fattening swine. PEDV Detection 79.66% (141 of 177) pig farms in 29 provinces. 72.27% (417 of 577) samples were positive for PEDV. 417 positive samples included 361 (71.63%; of 504) small intestine samples and 56 (76.71%; of 73) milk samples. 1381 JN601051(S1);JQ638914(S2) CH/GXWM/2011 GXNN-2 Nanning, Guangxi 4146 1381 JN601045(S1);JQ638911(S2) CH/BJSY/2011 BJSY Shunyi, Beijing 4149 1382 JQ638921.

SS2 is in the yellow region, SS6 is in the green region and the motif against 2C10 is in the pink region. all PEDV strains used in this study were divided into two groups. G1 was composed of three subgroups (G1-1, G1-2 and G1-3) the S genes of 13 recently Chinese field strains in G1-1 have 95.6%\u201399.9% homologies with each other, and share 96.0%\u201399.9%, 95.4%\u201396.7% and 93.6%\u201395.7% homologies with those of CV777-attenuated, CH/S and CHGD-1 respectively. the deduced amino acid sequences of these strains have 96.7%\u201399.7% homologies with each other. the deduced amino acid sequences of these strains share 92.3%\u201394.4%, 92.9%\u201393.7% and 96.6%\u201398.9% homologies with those of CV777-attenuated, CH/S and CHGD-1 respectively. the S genes of 8 field strains are 3 nt shorter and consist of 4,149 nt, the S genes of 2 field strains consist of 4152 nt, the S genes of 2 field strains consist of 4152 nt, the S genes of 17 field strains are 9 nt longer and consist of 4,161 nt. the S gene of 1 field strain are 18 nt longer consists of 4,170 nt. these consequences were due to the presence of the AHHF Hefei, anhui 4149 1382 JX018181 CH/YNKM/2012 YNKM Kunming, Yunnan 4149 1382 JX018181 CH/YNKM/2012 YNKM Kunming, Yunnan 4149 1382 JX018180 CH/JLGZL/2011 JLGZL Siping, Yunnan 4149 1382 JX018180 CH/JLGZL/2011 JLG 638507(S2) CH/JLCC/2011 JLCC Chengchun, Jilin 4161 1386 JQ638920 CH/SDLY/2011 SDLY Linyi, Shandong 4161 1386 JQ638917 CH/SDQD/2011 SDQD Qingdao, Shandong 4161 1386 JQ638919 CH/SDRZ/2011 SDRZ Rizhao, Shandong 4161 1386 JN671916 antigen epitope SS2 is conserved in all the Chinese field strains. compared to CV777-attenuated, 7 field strains have no amino acids change in the COE domain. 27 field strains have 1-8 different amino acids in the COE domain. all PEDV strains used in this study were divided into two groups. G1 was composed of three subgroups (G1-1, G1-2 and G1-3) 33 recently field strains were included in G1-1 and G2. 13 field strains were included in G1-1 and 20 were included in G2. phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences corresponding to the full-length S gene. field strains and reference strains Groups and reference strains Percentage identity (%) a G1-1 G2 CV777-attenuated CH/S CHGD-1 Percentage identity (%) b G1-1 95.6\u201399.9 c 94.9\u201399.8 93.5\u201397.1 96.0\u201399.9 95.4\u201396.7 93.6\u201395.7 G2 92.3\u201396.5 96.2\u201399.7 d 96.7\u201399.7 93.6\u201395.4 93.5 79.66% (141 of 177) pig farms in 29 provinces were confirmed as infected with PEDV. 72.27% (417 of 577) clinical samples were positive for PEDV. the S genes of 33 recently field strains in G2 are shorter than those of classical strains in length because of the nucleotides deletion. the unique characteristic of 20 field strains in G2 in the present study was the presence of the nucleotides insertion and deletion in the S genes. the insertion and deletion regions are mainly clustered in this region. 13 field strains and reference strains were determined to belong to G1. 20 field strains and 2 reference strains (CH/FJND-3/2011, CHGD-1) were clustered together within G2. most field strains are variant strains. the milk samples were sent to our lab with ice bags or dry ice. all the samples were initially detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using previously described methods. 12.5 L 2 EmeraldAmpTM PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 0.5 L each specific primer (10 M), and 10.5 L sterile deionized water. a 100-fold dilution in distilled water of the first PCR products were used as the template. PCR products were excised from 1.0% agarose gels, extracted using QIAquick\u00ae Gel Extraction Kit. phylogenetic tree was constructed from the aligned nucleotide sequences by the maximum likelihood method in the software program MegAlign [24]. phylogenetic tree was constructed from the aligned nucleotide sequences by the maximum likelihood method in the software program MegAlign. a total of 577 samples were collected from 177 farms in 29 provinces from February 2011 to November 2012. the sows\u2019 teats were washed three times with sterile physiological saline. the milk samples were sent to our lab with ice bags or dry ice bags. the complementary DNA (cDNA) of 33 representative field strains was synthesized using S2-2L as the reverse transcription primer according to the previously described methods. PCR was carried out in a two-step reaction, first with a pair of primers flanking the region to be amplified and then using a pair of primers within the amplified sequence in a total volume of 25 L. three to five recombinant DNA clones of each PEDV strains were sequenced. sequence alignments, nucleotide and amino acid sequences divergences were used in sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis. 2099 DR13 attenuated South Korea 4149 1382 DQ462404 SM98 South Korea 4143 1380 GU937797 SPK1 South Korea 4161 1386 AF500215 KNU-0801 South Korea 4161 1386 GU180143 KNU-0901 South Korea 4161 1386 GU180144 KNU-0902 South Korea 4161 1386 GU180145 KNU-0903 South Korea 4161 1386 GU180146 KNU-0904"}
