reptiles or scorpions (sting) (3), wild boar (1) and rabbit (1). rat trader group was the HRSC group with the highest proportion of members reporting having been bitten (60%), followed by animal

the highest incidence rate of reporting (2.2 per person-year), followed by animal health workers (0.63), rat traders (0.32) and farmers (0.25). compared with farmers at baseline, the IRR among animal health workers and slaughterers was significantly higher. each horizontal line represents the person-time experience of one HRSC member. a black dot represents a reported episode of disease in one HRSC member. a black dot represents a reported episode of disease in one HRSC member. a total of 3,320 animals belonging to 24 species were sampled from 189 farms. 849 animals were sampled as a result of responsive sampling on farms. the stated recruitment target of individuals with potentially high risk for exposure to zoonotic infections at high risk of animal contact has been reasonably met (852 vs. an initial target of 1,000) the prevalence of zoonotic disease transmission is highly variable between provinces and occupation. the zoonotic risks due to contact with and consumption of exotic animal species are unclear, but it is likely to include a wider range of known and unknown bacterial, parasitic (i.e. cysticercosis, trematodal infections) and viral diseases. pig blood pudding (\u2018tiet canh\u2019) is among other raw pig products, a known risk factor for Streptococcus suis infection, the most common cause of meningoencephalitis in the number of episodes of potential infectious disease reported to date fell considerably below the initial expectation of one episode per person per year. the data collected indicates that it is realistic to expect a total of 900 episodes of disease over the duration of the project (3 years) established effective disease notification systems for the VIZIONS HRSC studies requires effective engagement with local communities. non-farmer cohorts are more likely to report disease since they share work place and therefore it is more difficult to conceal episodes of disease. the observed cluster of disease in one commune suggests opportunities for formal outbreak investigations. we have initiated contact with public health field epidemiology experts. individuals across the whole study (i.e. 330 per province) to be followed for 3 years. this was expected to generate 3,000 clinical events (1 event per person per year) the composition of the remaining, non-farm cohort was decided in agreement with each province separately. questionnaires were designed to collect exposure and disease data from HRSC members. baseline questionnaires and annual update questionnaires were administered to all adult cohort members at recruitment and yearly thereafter, respectively. questionnaires are comparable to the baseline questionnaire except that they record data on medical conditions and exposures during the previous year. episodes of disease HRSC members were instructed to notify a contact person in the event of an episode of ill health. the contact person would make a decision as to whether the reported illness could potentially be a communicable disease. if the episode involved someone living on a farm, the PMC would immediately notify authorities who would co-ordinate animal sampling on the farm. rats purchased from markets (Dong Thap) will be collected over the three year period. pig sampling and poultry is based on the abattoirs and slaughter points. target is 15 poultry (chickens or ducks, depending on what is present on the date of the visit) in all types of HRSC only adults were recruited, except on farms where up to four family members were recruited. the target was to recruit 1,000 individuals across the whole study (i.e. 330 per province), to be followed for 3 years. this was expected to generate 3,000 clinical events (1 event per person per year) all sampling and testing procedures were carried out in accordance with guidelines previously reviewed and approved by the relevant institutional ethics committees for human and veterinary medicine. all methods were approved by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC) in the united kingdom. questionnaires were designed to collect relevant exposure and disease data from HRSC members. episodes of disease HRSC members were instructed to notify a contact person in the event of an episode of ill health. if the episode involved someone living on a farm, the PMC would immediately notify authorities from the sub-Department of Animal Health who would co-ordinate animal sampling on the farm. rats purchased from markets (Dong Thap) are to be collected over the three year period. the sampling requirements for pigs in each province include 15 randomly selected pigs every 6 months (target 90 pigs over the three year period) and interim analyses of the high-risk sentinel cohort of the Vietnam Initiative on Zoonotic Infections (VIZIONS)."}
