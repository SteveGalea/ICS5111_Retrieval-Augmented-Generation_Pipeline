{"summary": "the research agenda within the influenza field was discussed with a broad range of experts at meetings coordinated by agencies such as the world health organization (WHO), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the national Institute of allergy and infectious diseases (NIAID) in recent past. the need for more information on viral factors that affect transmission and contribute to the emergence of pandemic viruses was highlighted in the report of the blue ribbon panel on influenza research. 1% is the estimated probability of an escape from a single lab in a single year. this is in sharp contrast to the scenario discussed by Klotz and Sylvester [14] who concluded that 1% is the estimated probability of an escape from a single lab in a single year. human-to-human transmission of HPAI A/H5N1 virus has not yet been reported. the case-fatality rate of 60% does not take into account potential mild or asymptomatic infections in people who are not seen by physicians or at hospitals. virulence of 1918 H1N1 virus had an estimated case-fatality rate of 2.5% in humans. research aiming to unravel the genetic fingerprints associated with virus virulence, fitness, host range, and transmission needs to be done to enhance preparation for newly emerging infectious diseases. the more danger a pathogen poses, the more important it is to study it. it was advised that the competent authorities should re-review biosafety and biosecurity conditions required to perform this work. there should be focused communications to reduce anxiety among the public, increase awareness of the significance of this work, and explain why the details need to be published."}
