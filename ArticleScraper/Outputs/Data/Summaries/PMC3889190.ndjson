{"summary": "introduction RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful approach for suppressing expression of specific genes in mammalian cells. therapeutic strategies elicit RNAi involve targeting exogenous genes from pathogens or endogenous genes playing a role in the disease process. thousands of studies involving siRNA have been reported and >30 clinical trials involving siRNA- or shRNA-based drugs have been opened. the lac repressor (lacI) binds as a homotetramer to the lac operators (lacO) located within the promoter region, blocking transcription of the downstream gene. when the repressor is removed from the operator, transcription from the lac operon resumes. siRNA targeting the lac repressor mRNA will reduce levels of repressor protein allowing expression of a reporter gene, in our case luciferase, downstream of a lacO-containing promoter. we have created and tested the first transgenic mouse model in which every cell can potentially reveal every site of siRNA biological activity. pLacIR was created by Cronin et al.(33) and expresses a mammalianized version of the lac repressor driven from a 4.3 kb fragment of the human -actin promoter. transgenic lines were generated and then crossed to produce double transgenic (HDLacOLuc x LacIR) offspring. four of the five founder mice (424, 673, 676, and 677) produced pups that were genotype expression appeared to be especially high in the liver, fallopian tubes and ovaries of all three animals. HDLacOLuc-424 F1 pups were then mated with wild-type C57BL/6J mice and ubiquitous luciferase expression confirmed in the F2 generation. lac repressor expression was confirmed by western blot as a 38 kDa band. expression was high in muscle and spleen, and moderate in the brain and heart. no expression was detected in a wild-type control mouse. total luciferase expression in individuals from the HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-339 cross was not significantly lower than in HDLacOLuc-424 offspring. however, some HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-339 mice such as 1005 and 4001 had very low levels of expression. reduction in luciferase expression is likely to be attributable to the increased expression of the lac repressor in the 866 descendant mice. ns, not significant, *P = 0.0172, **P = 0.0012. eight of the mice showed a clear increase when administered IPTG. the greatest induction was observed in mouse 220 (HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-866) mouse 1010 lost some hair from the abdomen region leading to an increase in basal luciferase expression. siRNA targeting the bacterial lac repressor restores luciferase activity to levels observed in the absence of repressor. siRNA targeting the bacterial version of the lac repressor was used to allow long-term expression in the transgenic mice. luciferase mRNA was synthesized in preparation for in vivo delivery applications. siSTABLE-siLac#3 reduced repressor expression to levels comparable with the unmodified siLac sequence. 2 105 PC-3 cells were transfected with 1.6 g pLacIR. siLac#3 and siSTABLE-Lac#3 were then assessed for their ability to restore luciferase expression using a transient cotransfection assay. as a control GL4.74, a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid was also delivered in order that the transfection efficiency of firefly luciferase expression could be normalized. the transfection of NIH3T3 cells with HDLacOLuc, GL4.7 siSTABLE-Lac#3 are capable of downregulating lac repressor in cells bearing the dual expression system mediating a rise in reporter gene expression. as a result, a positive readout is generated from RNAi activity. in total, five HDLacOLuc founder mice were generated (Table 1). they were then crossed with wild-type C57BL/6J mice to produce F1 pups. four of the five founder mice (424, 673, 676, and 677) produced pups. 673-5, 676-5, and 677-3 are pups from the F1 generation of founders HDLacOLuc-673, HDLacOLuc-676 and HDLacOLuc-677 respectively. colors range from purple showing lowest expression through dark blue, light blue, green, yellow to red showing the highest expression. expression was high in muscle and spleen, moderate in the brain and heart. expression was low in the lungs, kidney, and liver. no expression was detected in a wild-type control mouse. HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-339 and HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-866 mice share the same genetic background for luciferase. the reduction in luciferase expression is likely to be attributable to the increased expression of the lac repressor in the 866 descendant mice. mice with high initial luciferase expression level failed to show any increase on IPTG treatment. some mice with low levels of expression also failed to be induced. greatest induction was observed in mouse 220 (HDLacOLuc-424 x LacIR-866) siRNA targeting the bacterial lac repressor restores luciferase activity to levels observed in the absence of repressor. a mammalianized version of the lac repressor was used to allow long-term expression in the transgenic mice. three new siRNA sequences were designed and tested following the transfection of PC-3 cells with pLacIR. 2 105 PC-3 cells were transfected with 1.6 g pLacIR. cells were lysed after (a) 48 hours or (c) 24 hours. samples run on a 12% acrylamide gel and then blotted for presence of lac repressor. the transfection of NIH3T3 cells with HDLacOLuc, GL4.74, and LacIR demonstrated reduced firefly luciferase activity in comparison with cells that received no repressor plasmid. however, the reduction in luciferase expression was only small since HDLacOLuc was delivered in tenfold excess compared with LacIR to limit transcriptional interference from the -actin promoter (driving LacIR) over the weaker HD promote luciferase expression was observed in peritoneal regions, most likely including the surface of the liver and possibly other organs. control siRNA (siNT) was administered at the same dose. no increase in luciferase expression was detected. luciferase expression was variable among the single transgenic offspring of the HDLacOLuc-424 founder mouse. only 2 of the 28 individuals examined (1005 and 255) showed levels of luciferase expression that were as low as wild-type or LacIR mice. luciferase expression levels within the individual double transgenic mice were stable for over 12 months in some cases. induction of luciferase in our current model was rapid when mice were given IPTG either via the oral or i.p. route. the degree of luciferase induction was variable between individuals but fell rapidly when IPTG was removed. this suggests re-expression of the repressor protein and silencing of the reporter. tet repressor protein binds to Tet operator sites located within the luciferase promoter. using specific siRNAs to target the tet repressor results in an increase in luciferase expression and thus a positive readout of siRNA activity. by encoding this system in cancer cell lines, they were able to implant tumor xenografts into nude mice and rats and compare a range of delivery vectors for tumor the use of a positive-readout reporter system would help address some of these issues of RNAi versus TLR3 activation. we believe a dynamic, rapidly responsive positive-readout reporter model for siRNA pharmacodynamics has great potential for improving siRNA vector design. p25 construct containing huntingtin promoter and exon 1 yields 800 bp product. lac repressor transgene resembles a typical mammalian gene. pGL4.74 expresses Renilla luciferase under the control of the human -actin promoter. luciferase (siLUC) (mRNA target sequence AACUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA), bacterial LacI (mRNA target sequence AAAUAUCUCACUCGCAAUCAA), and siRNAs targeting Hepatitis B surface antigen (siHBsAg#1, mRNA target sequence AACAUCACAUCAGGAUUCCUA, siHBsAg#2, mRNA target sequence AAUCACACCAACCUUUGU and 4 104 NIH/3T3 or PC-3 cells were plated out in 48-well plates. a 0.4 g of HDLacOLuc alone or with siLuc or siLac#3 (10 nmol/l final concentration) in complex with Lipofectamine was added to cells. the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked in 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 60 minutes. each blot was washed three times with TBST and incubated with goat antimouse IgG-HRP secondary antibody. lacIR transgenic mice were generated by isolating the transgenic construct from pLacIR via KpnI/SacI partial digestion to give a 7.5 kb fragment isolated and purified. three-week-old female B6CBAF1 mice were superovulated and mated. the fertilized oocytes were collected from the oviduct of plugged female mice and cultured until two clear pronuclei were visible. template DNA obtained from ear biopsies was amplified using thermal cycling conditions. 94 \u00b0C for 15 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 60 seconds, 55 \u00b0C for 60 seconds, and 72 \u00b0C for 40 seconds. the standard reaction contained QuantiTect Probe PCR mastermix. mice were culled, dissected and the organs arranged and reimaged outside the carcass. induction of luciferase with IPTG. Mice were then given 10 mmol/l IPTG."}
