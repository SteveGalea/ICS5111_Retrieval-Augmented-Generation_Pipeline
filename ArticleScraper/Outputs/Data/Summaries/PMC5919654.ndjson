{"summary": "M. pneumoniae is mainly epidemic in Denmark with the recurrence every 4-7th year. 134 of 746 children tested positive for M. pneumoniae by PCR or serology. in Denmark, M. pneumoniae is mainly epidemic with a recurrence rate every 4-7th year [5,6]. in a hospital setting, it is essential to establish if M. pneumoniae plays a significant differential role in lower respiratory tract infections and asthma-like exacerbations in young children. PCR was performed on oropharyngeal-swabs that were stored and transported cooled to the laboratory. RT-PCR was performed under conditions on a Stratagene Mx 3005P RT-PCR machine. children who presented with two or more positive PCR-tests within three months were considered as the same infective episode and only included once. the children were referred by general practitioners or the hospital's emergency department. the charts of 612 children with negative tests have not been audited. RT-PCR was performed on a Stratagene Mx 3005P RT-PCR machine. samples positive after more than 35 Ct-cycles were re-evaluated. a p-value of 0,05 was considered significant. the highest rate of positive and negative M. pneumoniae positive samples was in school-aged children (65%) but also pre-school children (30%) and even six children under the age of two (4%) had M. pneumoniae positive tests. the highest rate of positive and negative samples was in school-aged children. 5.8 [4.0:8.9] Rhinorrhoea (%) 40 19 11 15 Neutrophil count (median [IQR]) 9.6 [5.1:8.3] 5.8 [4.0:8.9] Sore throat (%) 0 18 26 22 Lymphocyte count (median [IQR]) 5.2 [1.1:1.8] 2.2 [1.7:2.9] 1.7 [1.3:2.5] Croup symptoms (%) 0 0 5 3 Extrapulmonary symptoms (%) 61% of the children were discharged from hospital on the day of admission. the most common respiratory manifestation was a cough (100%) and an age-depending degree of wheezing. at admission to the hospital, 92% of infants and children were diagnosed with troublesome lung symptoms lasting at least three days. only six children were treated with macrolide antibiotics twice due to suspicion of recurrence or treatment failure. most common extra-pulmonary manifestation was nausea, with or without vomiting, reported by a third of all children. we could not identify other differences between the two groups. Symptoms, extrapulmonary symptoms, objective signs and radiological findings in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae with or without a viral co-infection. epidemiological findings Out of 885 patients tested for M. pneumoniae in the study period, 139 were excluded due to age (older than 15 years of age), double sampling or repeated samples within three months. the epidemic peaked in October 2010 and again in October to December 2011. the highest rate of M. pneumoniae positive samples was in school-aged children (65%) but also pre-school children (30%). even six children under the age of two (4%) had M. pneumoniae positive tests. rhoea (%) 40 19 11 15 Neutrophil count (median [IQR]) 9.6 [5.1:8.3] 5.8 [4.0:8.9] Sore throat (%) 0 18 26 22 Lymphocyte count (median [IQR]) 5.2 [1.1:1.8] 2.2 [1.7:2.9] 1.7 [1.3:2.5] Croup symptoms (%) 0 0 5 3 Extrapulmonary symptoms (%) 83 94 90 91 Hilar aden the most common respiratory manifestation was a cough (100%) and an age-depending degree of wheezing (asthma-like symptoms) at admission to the hospital, 92% of infants and children were diagnosed with an episode of troublesome lung symptoms lasting at least three days. a total of 120 children received antibiotic treatment. only six children were treated with macrolide antibiotics twice. most common extra-pulmonary manifestation was nausea, with or without vomiting. 23% of all children had some type of rash, and 9% had hives. symptoms, extrapulmonary symptoms, objective signs and radiological findings in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae with or without a viral co-infection. children with a viral co-infection tendency of higher rates of wheezing (p = 0.07) children with a viral co-infection tendency had significantly higher rates of runny noses, p: 0.02 W- Tachypnea was defined as a respiratory rate over the 99.th percentile. the differential diagnosis of respiratory viral infections and exacerbation of asthma-like symptoms must be considered. the clinical presentation with a cough, wheezing, low-grade-fever, CRP below 50 mg/L and rhonchi on auscultation can also be considered as a childhood asthma-like exacerbation. 59% of the children had been treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic before examination for M. pneumoniae without improvement of the infection. no investigations for M. pneumoniae were done, and exclusion criteria would not exclude all children with a possible M. pneumoniae infection. the efficacy of antibiotic treatment should be discussed in light of a correct diagnostic test [15]. asymptomatic carriers of M. pneumoniae have to be differentiated from children suffering from symptomatic infections, LRTI, caused by M. pneumoniae [23], according to a cochrane review. x-rays were without pathognomonic features to CAP. infants and young children can cause respiratory virus infections."}
