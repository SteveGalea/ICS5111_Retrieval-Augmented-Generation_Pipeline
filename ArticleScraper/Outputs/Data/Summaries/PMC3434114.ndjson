{"summary": "the aim of this study was to identify the subtypes of PCV2 that are associated with reproductive failure in pigs from the State of So Paulo, Brazil. findings indicate that the frequency of PCV2 infections in aborted porcine foetuses from the State of So Paulo is rather low (10.7%) a predominance of type 2b in herds having PCV2 associated diseases (PCVAD) has been described in several countries in Europe and in North America. PCV2a has been recovered before PCVAD were recorded in Canada, in non-PCVAD affected farms in the u.s. and in healthy animals in Switzerland. PPV DNA amplification was achieved using a pair of primers directed to the VP2 sense/antisense template that amplifies a 197 bp fragment. PPV amplification was achieved using a pair of primers directed to the VP2 sense/antisense template that amplifies a 197 bp fragment. a rooted tree was constructed using Tree Explorer from the MEGA v2 package. PCV2 was detected in 10.7% (18/168) of the samples. of the 18 PCV2 positive cases, PPV, Brucella spp., and Leptospira spp. were identified in 2, 10 and 0 cases. the neighbour-joining tree that was assembled classified 10 sequences as genotype 2b and one sequence as 2a. no repeatable amino acid motifs in the PCV2 capsid protein or residues used for genotype classification were associated with clinical disease. the results are consistent with previous field and experimental reports, in which both genotypes have been detected. a number of studies have reported co-infections with PCV2 and PPV. PPV has been established as an important virus involved in PCV2 associated reproductive failure. despite a national control program for brucellosis in Brazil, the organism was detected in 10/18 positive samples. osis as a co-infection demonstrates that uncommon agents may be involved in PCVAD. no repeatable, characteristic amino acid motifs for regions of the PCV2 capsid protein for either genotypes a or b were associated with reproductive failure."}
