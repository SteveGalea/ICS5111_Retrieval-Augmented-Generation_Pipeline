{"summary": "the links between TM and biodiversity are exemplified by a long tradition of healing powers associated with the earth's natural systems. the pharmacopoeia of folk seties and professional medical systems contain thousands of medicines made from leaves, herbs, roots, bark, animal, mineral substances and other materials found in nature. the links between TM and biodiversity are exemplified by a long tradition of healing powers associated with the earth's natural systems. the biomedical approach to health is based on methods of diagnosing and treating specific pathologies: one pathogen = one disease, an approach that does not take into account the connections between disease and the environment in which sick people live. this paper addresses the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services to global and human health, the risks which human impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity present to human health and welfare. toxic effects of degradation of ecosystem services are being borne disproportionately by the poor. biodiversity loss diminishes the supplies of raw materials for drug discovery and biotechnology, causes a loss of medical models, affects the spread of human diseases, and threatens food production and water quality. peptide compounds in the venom of cone snails are the most promising new drugs available for the treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. the diversity of these compounds is so great that it may rival that of alkaloids in higher plants and secondary metabolites in microorganisms. one voltage-sensitive calcium-channel blocker, omega-conotoxin, binds with enormous specificity to neuronal calcium channels and has been found to have potent activity in animals. ecosystems maintain equilibria among predators and prey, and among hosts, vectors and parasites in plants, animals and humans. malaria and leishmaniasis can be affected by upsetting these equilibria through deforestation [24]; Lyme disease through changes in the number of acorns; argente hemorrhagic fever through the replacement of natural grasslands with corn monoculture [26] biodiversity and TM Wild populations of numerous species are overexploited around the globe. the demand created by the traditional medicine is one of the causes of the overexploitation. the practice of TM is not immuned to the current environmental crisis facing our planet. traditional medicinal knowledge is rapidly disappearing, owing to cultural change. many villages in the world are no longer surrounded by the natural habitat that served as a medicine cupboard, and bodies of folk knowledge are disappearing at an alarming rate. modern society will never know what effective medicinal treatments are being lost. knowledge of the use of plants is disappearing faster than the plants themselves. on-site communities with extensive knowledge of local environments may be used towards collaborative conservation and management. exclusion of local communities from the consultation/decision processes may lead to the construction of public policies devoid of historical information. a great number of these natural products have come to us from the scientific study of remedies traditionally employed by various cultures, most of them being plant-derived. folk or traditional medicinal uses represent 'leads' that could shortcut the discovery of modern medicines. of the 150 prescription drugs currently in use in the united states of America, 27 have animal origin. one excellent example of successful drug development from a component of snake venom is that of the inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) this enzyme is responsible for converting an inactive precursor into the locally active hormone angiotensin, which causes blood vessels to constrict. more demand and increased human populations are leading to unsustainable rates of exploitation of wild sourced ingredients. some wild species are already threatened with extinction, according to a CITES report. the worldwide market for animal parts and their medicinal derivatives is contributing to loss of some species. indigenous groups use more primary forest species than non-indigenous rural communities. weeds, for both biochemical and bioecological reasons, represent a significant part of traditional pharmacopoeias throughout the world. weeds, for both biochemical and bioecological reasons, represent a significant part of traditional pharmacopoeias throughout the world. substitutes may not always be feasible because recipes using different species may not have the same efficacy, nor may it be advisable without a thorough examination into the sustainability of utilizing substitute species. in Brazil, for example, state lists of endangered plants include 54 medicinal species, of which 33 are commercialized [82]. many source countries look upon native medicinal plants as possible additions to the WHO list of \"essential drugs\" several organs and tissues including bones and bile can be a source of Salmonella infection causing chronic diarrhoea and endotoxic shock. the possibility of transmission of infections or ailments from animal preparations to the patient should be seriously considered [89] public health researchers must lead the development of a research agenda to maximize the potential contribution of TM to healthcare systems globally. julian zelizer: a broad public health agenda should evolve with an integrative system of care. he says a broad public health agenda should evolve with an integrative system of care. zelizer: a broad public health agenda should evolve with an integrative system. the construction of regulatory measures will increasingly require the involvement of stakeholders, who must be made aware of the need for the conservation of the natural resource as a guarantee for its sustainable exploitation. such involvement could contribute to change the perception held by some that the demands for regulation to protect endangered species represent a form of cultural imperialism."}
