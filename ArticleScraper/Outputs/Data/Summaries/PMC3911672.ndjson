{"summary": "coronaviruses NL63, 229E, and OC43 are adapted to spread in humans. zoonotic transmission of animal coronaviruses to humans can result in novel, severe diseases. the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes a severe, SARS-related respiratory disease. ARS-S to ACE2 triggers subtle conformational rearrangements in SARS-S. cleavage of the S protein by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity. the responsible enzymes constitute potential targets for intervention. TMPRSS2 and HAT are expressed in ACE2-positive cells in the human lung. ACE2 is proteolytically processed by host cell proteases. it was shown that binding to ACE2 triggers processing of ACE2 by a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)/tumor necrosis factor -converting enzyme (TACE) it is conceivable that ACE2 cleavage increases SARS-S-mediated entry. TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 compete for ACE2 cleavage. only processing by TMPRSS2 promotes SARS-S-driven entry. cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. 293T cells were cotransfected with an expression plasmid encoding ACE2. the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM at 6 to 8 h posttransfection. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. trichloroacetic acid (TCA; Sigma) was added for 16 h to cultures of ACE2-transfected 293T cells. precipitated proteins were pelleted through centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. imageJ (46) was employed for signal quantification. ds encoding the receptor ACE2 or ACE2 mutants were cotransfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteases or empty plasmid. one day prior to infection, target cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 30,000 cells/well. subsequently, pseudotypes were added and the cells were incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding the ACE2 wt or the indicated ACE2 mutants. the cells cotransfected with empty plasmid were cultivated in either regular medium or medium supplemented with PMA. the presence of ACE2 in culture supernatants (Sup) was determined using an antibody against the ACE2 ectodomain (bottom panel) plasmids encoding the ACE2 wild type (wt) or the specified ACE2 mutants were transfected into 293T cells. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were detached and washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer. after binding of primary antibodies for 45 min at 4\u00b0C, cells were washed three times with FACS buffer and incubated for 45 min at 4\u00b0C with Cy5-coupled anti- 1 g of recombinant ACE2 (R&D Systems) was incubated with 0.2 g of recombinant HAT (R&D Systems) in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.05% [wt/vol], and Brij 35 [pH 9.5] for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in a total volume of 25 l. reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer. 0.5 l was spotted onto the matrix surface, let dry, and washed once with ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (10 mM in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid [TFA]) cells were seeded on coated coverslips, transfected with plasmids encoding ACE2 and TMPRSS2 or empty vector. cells were washed three times with PBS followed by 20 min of fixation with 4% PFA. 293T and Cos-7 cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. expression plasmids for SARS-S and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate (Cytogen) have been described previously (39\u201341) 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmid encoding ACE2. the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM at 6 to 8 h posttransfection. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. supernatants were harvested and cleared from cell debris by centrifugation. precipitated proteins were pelleted through centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to supernatants. one day prior to infection, target cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 30,000 cells/well. subsequently, pseudotypes were added and the cells were incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. thereafter, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding the ACE2 wt or the indicated ACE2 mutants. the cells cotransfected with empty plasmid were cultivated in either regular medium or medium supplemented with PMA. the cells were incubated with a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with SARS-S for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. plasmids encoding the ACE2 wild type (wt) or the specified ACE2 mutants were transfected into 293T cells. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were detached and washed with FACS buffer. cells were stained with a goat anti-ACE2 antiserum (R&D Systems) ACE2, 1 g of recombinant ACE2 (R&D Systems) was incubated with 0.2 g of recombinant HAT (R&D Systems) in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.05% [wt/vol], and Brij 35 [pH 9.5] for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in a total volume of 25 l. reaction products were stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer. 0.5 l was spotted onto the matrix surface, let dry, and washed once with ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (10 mM in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid [TFA]) cells were seeded on coated coverslips, transfected with plasmids encoding ACE2 and TMPRSS2 or empty vector. incubation was performed at 4\u00b0C to allow binding but not uptake. ACS-based analysis of SARS-S1-Fc binding to cells was conducted. ACE2 cleavage by TTSPs is detectable in transiently transfected 293T cells. coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 or HAT of human and animal origin resulted in ACE2 cleavage. a new TTSP, hepsin, was identified, which cleaves ACE2 in a manner similar to that observed for TMPRSS2 and HAT. transfected cells were lysed and the lysates analyzed by Western blotting using an ACE2 monoclonal antibody directed against the ACE2 ectodomain (top panel) recombinant ACE2 and HAT produced an 80-kDa fragment. incubation of ACE2 with HAT but not reaction buffer alone produced an 80-kDa fragment. cleavage site resides in this 15-amino-acid sequence. peptides 598-DQSIKVRISLKSALG-612 and 598-DQSIKVR-604 were sequenced. the 80-kDa fragment was generated upon HAT-dependent proteolysis of recombinant ACE2 at residue R604 corresponding to R621 of cellular ACE2. however, all ACE2 mutants were cleaved with an efficiency similar to that of the ACE2 wt in cells coexpressing bands 1 to 5 were excised and subjected to mass spectrometric peptide mapping with trypsin and endoproteinase Asp-N. mass spectrometric analysis of Asp-N digests of ACE2 (bands 3 and 4) and its cleavage product (band 5) revealed R604 as the HAT cleavage site. the transfected cells were lysed and the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using an ACE2 monoclonal antibody directed against the ACE2 ectodomain. arginine and lysine residues within amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for efficient ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2 and HAT. expression of all ACE2 mutants in cell lysates was readily detected by Western blotting. mutation of lysine and lysine residues in clusters 0 to 3 did not interfere with ACE2 processing by TMPRSS2 and HAT. arginine and lysine residues within cluster 4 are essential for ACE2 proteolysis by TMPRSS2 and HAT. ACE2 mutants C0, C1, C2, and C4 were cotransfected into 293T cells. transfected cells were lysed and the lysates analyzed by Western blotting. ACE2 cleavage is essential for TMPRSS2- and HAT-mediated augmentation of SARS-S-driven transduction. ine and lysine clusters invariably caused a modest decrease in ACE2 expression levels. a more notable reduction in ACE2 surface expression was measured upon mutation of cluster 2 (mutants C2 and C0 + C2) in keeping with the reduced expression of these mutants in cell lysates. results of a single experiment are shown and were confirmed in two separate experiments. the results represent the averages from two to six independent experiments. most ACE2 mutants supported transduction by SARS-S-bearing pseudotypes. ACE2 proteolysis by TMPRSS2 is not required for SARS-S-activation. the first phenotype, increased infection, is due to ACE2 cleavage. the second phenotype, cathepsin L independence, has so far been linked to ACE2 proteolysis. TMPRSS2 expression also facilitates cathepsin L-independent entry into target cells expressing the cleavage-resistant ACE2 mutant C4. TMPRSS2 increases cellular uptake of SARS-S. soluble S1 subunit of SARS-S fused to human Fc (SARS-S1-Fc) bound efficiently to ACE2-expressing cells, while binding to TMPRSS2-positive cells was within the background range. TMPRSS2 increases uptake of SARS-S1-Fc and potentially authentic SARS-CoV into ACE2-expressing cells. TMPRSS2 expression increases uptake of SARS-S1-Fc and potentially authentic SARS-CoV. this could account for increased SARS-S-driven entry into TMPRSS2-positive cells. TMPRSS2 expression inhibits SARS-S shedding by ADAM17. it has been proposed that TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 modulate SARS-CoV entry via similar mechanisms. TMPRSS2 suppresses ACE2 shedding by ADAM17. 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding ACE2. cells were pelleted, washed with buffer containing different concentrations of NaCl. TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 cleave ACE2 at different sites. analysis of cell lysates for expression and TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage. a short C-terminal cleavage product was readily detectable for all ACE2 variants tested except mutant C4. our previous work indicated that ADAM17 activity is not required for S-protein-mediated transduction or for spread of authentic SARS-CoV (36), findings that contrast with those of previous studies. however, the activation of ADAM17 by PMA and potentially also by SARS-S is a fast, transient process (52), which might have been missed in our previous study. ACE2 processing into a 13-kDa C-terminal fragment was also observed for hepsin. TMPRSS3, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS6 did not facilitate ACE2 proteolysis. titration experiments showed that the efficiency of ACE2 cleavage was dependent on the protease expression level. thus, low protease expression resulted in the generation of additional cleavage products of approximately 15 to 17 kD ACE2 monoclonal antibody directed against the ectodomain or a polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of ACE2 (middle panel) proteases from the indicated species were analyzed. different amounts of plasmid encoding TMPRSS2 and HAT wild types or catalytically inactive proteases were cotransfected. no peptides matching the C-terminal sequence of amino acids 603 to 733 were detected in the trypsin/Asp-N digests of the 80-kDa fragment. this finding, together with the observation that the Asp-N cleavage product 598-DQSIKVRISLKSALG-612 is present in the Asp-N digest of intact ACE2 but not in that of the 80-kDa fragment. recombinant ACE2 is cleaved into an 80-kDa fragment (band 5) upon incubation with HAT. the 80-kDa fragment does not appear as a double band, suggesting differences in electrophoretic mobility of intact ACE2 may be due to ragged C-terminal sequences. mass signals at m/z 1,614.96 represent the Asp-N cleavage product 598-DQSIKVRISLKSALG-612 ([M+H]+calc = 1,614.954) its presence in intact ACE2 (bands 3 and 4, upper and middle panels) together with its presence in the 80-kDa fragment (band 5, lower panel) revealed R604 as the HAT cleavage site. TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS2 used mutagenesis to identify ACE2 cleavage sites. arginine and lysine residues in clusters 0 to 3 were cleaved by TMPRSS2 and HAT. ACE2 cleavage was not allowed by TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS2. arginine and lysine residues within ACE2 amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for ACE2 proteolysis by TMPRSS2 and HAT. cluster 0 (amino acids 619 to 625) contributes to efficient cleavage of cluster 4. ACE2 cleavage is essential for TMPRSS2- and HAT-mediated augmentation of SARS-S-driven entry. ACE2 cleavage is essential for TMPRSS2- and HAT-mediated augmentation of entry mediated by the SARS-CoV spike protein. results of a single experiment are shown and were confirmed in two separate experiments. cells transfected with empty plasmid (pcDNA) served as a negative control. cells transfected with empty plasmid (pcDNA) served as a negative control. coexpression of ACE2 wt and HAT augmented SARS-S- but not VSV-G-driven entry. ACE2 proteolysis by TMPRSS2 is not required for SARS-S-activation. second phenotype, cathepsin L independence, has so far been linked to SARS-S cleavage. transduction facilitated by SARS-S was profoundly augmented upon expression of the ACE2 wt. transduction efficiency was rescued upon coexpression of TMPRSS2. same effects were observed for cells expressing ACE2 mutant C4 in conjunction with TMPRSS2. soluble S1 subunit of SARS-S fused to human Fc (SARS-S1-Fc) bound efficiently to ACE2-expressing cells. binding to TMPRSS2-positive cells was within the background range. comparable results were obtained upon analysis of SARS-S1-Fc binding by immunofluorescence. this suggests that increased SARS-S binding does not account for the ability of TMPRSS2 to augment SARS-S-driven entry. TMPRSS2 expression increases uptake of SARS-S1-Fc and potentially authentic SARS-CoV. this could account for increased SARS-S-driven entry into TMPRSS2-positive cells. the results are representative of those of three separate experiments. TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 induce ACE2 shedding by ADAM17. TMPRSS2 does not facilitate ACE2 shedding and even interferes with ACE2 shedding by ADAM17. TMPRSS2 suppresses ACE2 shedding by ADAM17. 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding ACE2 and either the TMPRSS2 wt or catalytically inactive TMPRSS2 (mut) or empty plasmid (pcDNA) the cells were pelleted, washed with buffer containing different concentrations of NaCl, and pelleted again, and proteins present in supernatants were precipitated. a prominent ACE2 signal was detected for supernatants of cells expressing the ACE2 wt and all mutants except C2. a prominent ACE2 signal was detected for supernatants of PMA-treated cells expressing the ACE2 wt and all mutants except C2. this indicates that PMA treatment had induced ACE2 shedding and that shedding was inhibited by the changes introduced into mutant C2. TMPRSS2 and HAT, members of the TTSP family, cleave and activate SARS-S for host cell entry (26\u201328, 43, 53) arginine and lysine residues within ACE2 amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2 and HAT. however, ADAM17 activity did not modulate SARS-S-driven entry. ACE2 is an integral component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which controls blood pressure as well as fluid and salt balance. ACE2 expression protects against acute respiratory distress syndrome (37, 38) ACE2 is intimately involved in several physiological and pathophysiological processes. human hepsin, a TTSP expressed in kidney, pancreas, lung, and other tissues, was found to process ACE2 and SARS-S. these observations demonstrate that all SARS-S-processing TTSPs identified so far also cleave ACE2. however, formal proof was lacking. mutagenic analysis of potential cleavage sites in the membrane-proximal region of ACE2 demonstrated that arginine and lysine residues within ACE2 amino acids 697 to 716 are essential for ACE2 cleavage. the cleavage-resistant mutant C4 was robustly expressed and facilitated entry into target cells with efficiency similar to that of the ACE2 wt. TMPRSS2 and HAT impact SARS-S-driven entry via two independent mechanisms. ACE2 cleavage by these proteases increases entry efficiency. TMPRSS2 activates the S protein for cathepsin L-independent host cell entry. virions are taken up into endosomes, where SARS-S is activated. shedding is believed to promote lung pathogenesis. the cellular uptake of SARS-CoV can also be augmented upon ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2. the arrows are shown in dashed lines. cleavage promotes uptake of authentic, infectious SARS-CoV into target cells. previous analysis failed to detect evidence for an important contribution of ADAM17 to SARS-S-mediated cellular entry. however, the comparison of ACE2 cleavage products revealed striking differences. residues 652 to 659 identified in our study might not constitute the cleavage site itself but might determine whether a downstream cleavage site is recognized by ADAM17. this scenario is supported by previous studies suggesting that the structure of the juxtamembrane region might be more important for shedding than the sequence of the actual cleavage site (49, 61, 62) the identification of the ACE2 site(s) controlling cleavage by TTSPs and ADAM17 reveals important insights into ACE2 biology. our results should stimulate efforts to determine whether receptor proteolysis impacts infection by hCoV-229E and MERS-CoV."}
