{"summary": "enveloped viruses use one or more viral encoded glycoproteins to mediate the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. this is a thermodynamically favored process but with one or more very high energy barriers. many of the viral fusion glycoproteins are trimers of heterodimers. se cleavage resulting in a fusion-active conformation that requires a trigger to begin the fusion process. multiple extended viral glycoprotein intermediates are thought to be necessary to form a fusion pore. the globular domains are not shown for clarity. class II fusion proteins (e.g., TBEV E) use beta-sheet secondary structures to form the extended fusion intermediate and final postfusion structures. however, the native structure of the fusion protein is a dimer that lies parallel to the membrane. a third class of viral fusion proteins has been identified. the fusion peptide binds to sialic acid causing the trafficking of the virion to the endosomal compartment. but only low pH exposure causes conformational changes in the fusion protein. in another triggering mechanism, the interaction of the viral fusion protein with a specific cellular receptor protein enables conformational changes to occur at neutral pH. ASLVs have been classified into noncytopathic (subgroups A, C, and E) and cytopathic (subgroups B and D) viruses depending on whether they induced cytotoxicity in cultures avian cells. cytotoxicity is not fusion of multiple cells to form syncytia, but rather a slowing of cell replication with the rounding and release of dead cells from the matrix. the ASLV(A) through ASLV(E) SU glycoproteins are highly conserved except for five variable domains, vr1, vr2, hr1, hr2 and vr3. the membrane spanning domain (MSD) anchors the TM glycoprotein into the membrane. sequence alignments were done using the ClustalW program in MacVector 14.5.3. identical residues are shaded; conserved residue differences are in boxes. a partial sequence of a subgroup E ASLV is the combination of two partial sequences. there are 19 Cys residues in ASLV(A) Env; one must be free. the second Cys residue was found to be free. the free cysteine is labeled C2. unglycosylated sites are marked as hr1 in green boxes; hr2 in an orange box; and vr3 in a pink box. a genetic evolution experimental system selected ASLV(A) variants with mutations in the envelope glycoproteins. TNFR-related proteins contain three cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) in the extracellular domain. the chicken TvbS1 is a receptor for subgroups B, D, and E. the quail TvbQ and the turkey TvbT are receptors for only subgroup E. this was the first demonstration of a possible role of CRD3 in Tvb function as an ASLV receptor [52]. Tvc proteins are related to mammalian butyrophilins and are members of the immunoglobulin protein family. the extracellular domain of Tvc contains two immunoglobulin-like domains, IgV and IgC. s9 technology to induce genetic resistance by inserting deletions into receptor genes that knock out expression, e.g., Tva and Tvc [59] new experimental models can be engineered using this type of technology to ask additional questions. tvcs line H6 Wild type Tvc receptor conferring susceptibility to ASLV(C) infection. tvcs line 15 line 15I5 Single nucleotide mutation in tvcs. avian cells in which the receptors, viral proteins, and secreted immunoadhesins are synthesized and post-translationally modified as the wild type proteins. the receptor\u2013mIgG immunoadhesins can trigger conformational changes in the mature ASLV Env trimers indistinguishable from a natural membrane-bound receptor. uninfected DF-1 cells (B) and DF-1 cells chronically infected with either ASLV(A) (C), ASLV(B) (D) or ASLV(C) (E) were incubated with different amounts of each secreted SU-rIgG (B) or each soluble receptor\u2013mIgG (C\u2013E) the receptor\u2013viral glycoprotein complexes were bound to either goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rab a Apparent Kd values were estimated by fitting the data via nonlinear least squares to a log logistic growth curve function. each result is the average and standard deviation from three experiments. b n.d.b.\u2014no detectable binding; gray fields indicate binding reactions not performed. the subgroup B SU hypervariable region from RAV-2 was used to create RCAS(B), while the same SU region of subgroup C Prague C RSV was used to create RCAS(C), but the remaining glycoprotein sequence is from the SR-A isolate. the sources of the actual regions of a specific RCAS envelope glycoprotein are critical for an accurate evaluation and understanding of any ASLV entry experiment. the receptor interference assay demonstrates the remarkable receptor specificity for using just one receptor attained by the wild type ASLV envelope glycoproteins with little or no cross-interference. the subgroup J ASLV was used as a control since ASLV(J) encodes very different SU glycoproteins with only 40% identity compared to subgroups A to E. DF-1 cells and DF-1 cells chronically infected with ASLV(A), ASLV(B), ASLV(C), or subgroup J ASLV, HPRS103. the same viral supernatants were assayed for their abilities to infect mammalian cells (C) that do not express ASLV receptors. the ASLV(A) through ASLV(E) SU glycoproteins are highly conserved except for five variable domains, vr1, vr2, hr1, hr2 and vr3. a variety of studies have identified hr1 and hr2 as the principle binding domains between the viral glycoprotein trimer and the host protein receptor. the sequence alignments were done using the ClustalW program in MacVector 14.5.3. identical residues are shaded, conserved residue differences are in boxes, and nonconserved residue differences are unmarked. there are 19 Cys residues in ASLV(A) Env; one must be free. the second Cys residue was found to be free. the free cysteine is labeled C2. group A to E receptors Members of three very different families of proteins have been identified to be receptors of these five ASLVs. LDLRs usually contain multiple cysteine-rich regions; Tva has one cysteine-rich LDLR region located between residues 11 and 50 in the extracellular domain with three required disulfide bonds between the six cysteine residues. TNFR-related proteins contain three cysteine-rich domains in the extracellular domain. the chicken TvbS1 is a receptor for subgroups B, D, and E. the chicken TvbS3 is a receptor for subgroups B and D (10); the quail TvbQ and the turkey TvbT are receptors for only subgroup E. Tvc proteins are related to mammalian butyrophilins and are members of the immunoglobulin protein family. the extracellular domain contains two immunoglobulin-like domains, IgV and IgC, which presumably each contain a disulfide bond important for native function of the protein. alleles including genetic defects and phenotypes of known ASLV receptor resistance alleles. allele chicken line Mutation Phenotype Ref. tvas Line H6 Line 0 Wild type Tva receptor conferring susceptibility to ASLV(A) infection. tvcs line H6 Wild type Tvc receptor conferring susceptibility to ASLV(C) infection. tvcs line 15 line 15I5 Single nucleotide mutation in tvcs resulting in a premature stop codon. the ASLV SU and receptor immunoadhesins have provided valuable tools for studying the mechanisms of retroviral entry. the receptor\u2013mIgG immunoadhesins can trigger conformational changes in the mature ASLV Env trimers indistinguishable from a natural membrane-bound receptor. uninfected DF-1 cells (B) and uninfected DF-1 cells (B) were fixed with paraformaldehyde and incubated with different amounts of each secreted SU-rIgG (B) or each soluble receptor\u2013mIgG (C\u2013E) the receptor\u2013viral glycoprotein complexes were bound to either goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG linked to phycoerythrin. avian viruses naturally included examples of replication-competent isolates that contained the gag, pol, and env genes required for replication. the ability to efficiently replicate and carry an additional transgene was unusual and Stephen Hughes\u2019s lab constructed the RCAS family of replication-competent viruses based on RSV. subgroups B and C RCASBP vectors replicate to lower titers, 105 ifu/mL, in DF-1 cells likely due to the cytotoxic effect of their glycoproteins on the cells. receptor interference assay demonstrates the remarkable receptor specificity for using just one receptor attained by the wild type ASLV envelope glycoproteins with little or no cross-interference. control since ASLV(J) encodes very different SU glycoproteins with only 40% identity compared to subgroups A to E. mammalian cells do not express receptors for efficient ASLV infection unless engineered to express Tva, Tvb, or Tvc receptors that then allows infection. but there are multiple blocks in ASLV replication that prevent the production on new infectious virus. the same viral supernatants were assayed for their ability to infect mammalian cells that do not express ASLV receptors. the same viral supernatants were also assayed for their abilities to infect mammalian cells (C) that do not express ASLV receptors. current model of ASLV(A) Env mediated membrane fusion highlighting some of the stable intermediate stages that can be achieved experimentally. not all of the SU glycoproteins in the trimer are shown in steps 1\u20133; the SU glycoproteins are not shown in steps 4 and 5 but published reports indicate the disulfide bonds between TM remain stable throughout the fusion process. physiological temperatures are required for receptor binding of SU to trigger conformational change. receptor-SU binding at 4 \u00b0C does not induce conformational change. thermolysin assay uses a soluble form of the ASLV(A) receptor sTva-mIgG to trigger conformational changes. the formation of the 6HB can be blocked by addition of the inhibitory peptide R99. the receptor triggered ASLV glycoproteins fold back to form the stable TM oligomer. TM oligomers in the 6HB form can be assayed using Western immunoblots. retroviruses have the ability to evolve the structure of their envelope glycoproteins to use a different cellular protein as a receptor, often a protein that has no obvious homology to the original receptor. despite the complexity of this interaction, retroviruses have the ability to evolve the structure of their envelope glycoproteins to use a different cellular protein as a receptor. a third genetic selection strategy has employed the wide variety of chicken lines that effectively do not have a functional ASLV subgroup receptor. nonavian cells can be engineered to express an ASLV receptor that allows infection, integration of the provirus, and some subsequent viral gene expression. a second type of acquired mutations occurred in the hr1 and vr3 hypervariable regions of the SU glycoproteins. the sequence alignments were done using the ClustalW program in MacVector 14.5.3: gaps are noted with black dashes. the identified mutations are shown in red text; deletions are shown with red dashes. a chicken DF-1 cell line was developed that expressed high levels of the quail sTva-mIgG immunoadhesin that could inhibit ASLV(A) infection by >15,000-fold. these cells were then challenged with different amounts of RCASBP(A) to select virus variants that could evade the antiviral effect of the quail sTva-mIgG inhibitor. three viral variants were selected with mutations in the hr1 80% of the escape population expressed the same hr1 mutation Y142N as the first experiment. the other 20% contained two variants, both with one mutation in hr1 and one mutation in vr3. a secondary phenotype of the new variants was an alteration in the receptor interference patterns compared to wild type ASLV(A) a variant virus was selected with expanded receptor usage with two mutations in the hr1 region of the SU glycoprotein, L154S and T155I, and to Tvb receptors that support B and D, and now E, subgroup viruses. as determined later, only the L154S mutation was necessary to extend the receptor usage, and this also extended the host range to nonavian cell types. Del155-160 virus could infect DF-1/RCAS(A) cells >100-fold more efficiently. DF-1/RCAS(B) and DF-1/RCAS(C) cells blocked infection by 5\u201310-fold compared to wild type RCASBP(A) this expansion of receptor usage by the Del155-160 virus came with a cost to replication. only the two double mutation variants were resistant to quail sTva-mIgG inhibition. all of the mutations in the SU glycoprotein significantly reduce the binding affinity for the Tva receptor. receptor interference patterns of all four selected variants were further altered compared to the original Del155\u2013160 virus. compared to wild type RCASBP(C) with significantly reduced ability to infect DF-1/A (10-fold) and DF-1/B (100-fold) infected cells. increased receptor usage results in replication to a 10-fold lower titer compared to wild type: 104 ifu/mL. d out the ability of the RCASBP(B)/Del136-142 glycoproteins to bind the sTvbS3-mIgG immunoadhesin. there are only 8-amino acid differences between the extracellular C-terminal SU and TM regions of RAV-2 and SR-A. the RCASBP(RAV2) envelope glycoprotein consisting of the entire RAV-2 Subgroup B envelope glycoprotein could not evade the anti -2/Del+VAS or all four mutations (RAV-2/Del+SVAS) altered the pattern of receptor interference of these variant viruses somewhat compared to wild type RAV-2 or RCASBP(B) these mutations significantly extended the host range of the variants for infection of several mammalian cells compared to wild type RAV-2. recombinant env genes were fused to the rest of the SR-A env gene. clone 6620-17 contained the recombination plus additional mutations in the SU glycoprotein. none of the representative variant viruses with env genes found in bird 6620, including 6620-17, were resistant to sTvbS3-mIgG inhibition. only eight amino acid differences between the RCASBP(B) and RCASBP(RAV2) viruses account for the inability of RCASBP(RAV2) to escape sTvbS3-mIgG inhibition. the mature RCASBP(B) glycoproteins appear to be more stable compared to the RCASBP(RAV2) glycoproteins upon conformation change triggered by heat. variants were selected for resistance to a peptide inhibitor (R99) that bound the HR2 region and prevented the formation of 6HB necessary for membrane fusion and virus entry. some of these mutations in the HR1 region of the TM glycoprotein escaped the R99 inhibition, but also expanded receptor tropism to nonavian cells. no mutations in SU glycoprotein hr1, hr2 or vr3 hypervariable regions critical for receptor specificity and host range. biochemical characterization determined that the L378S mutation altered the H20-RSV envelope glycoprotein trimers to no longer require a receptor to prime the initial triggering of the changes. BP(RAV2) envelope glycoprotein trimers demonstrate fundamental differences. the mature RCASBP(B) glycoproteins appear to be more stable compared to the RCASBP(RAV2) glycoproteins upon conformation change triggered by heat. mutations altering the two-step entry fusion mechanism of ASLV provide another evolutionary escape mechanism perhaps independent of hypervariable mutations in the SU glycoprotein. the entire Prague Subgroup C envelope glycoprotein in the RCAS, RCASBP(PrC-RSV) could evolve to infect receptor-negative mammalian cells. despite ASLVs only infecting avian species naturally, the group had shown that ASLVs could be used to infect hamsters and rats experimentally with RSVs. the ability to infect mammalian cells was transferred to a subgroup B ALV by constructing a RCASBP(B) vector but with the H20-RSV TM glycoprotein. thus, they concluded the H20-RSV virus was able to extend its host range to mammalian cells due to the pre-activation of the mutant glycoproteins and not to the use of a new mammalian cell surface protein as a receptor. mutations in the hr1/vr3 regions can alter receptor binding affinity and receptor usage. mutations that alter the biochemical properties of the fusion process often result in an \u201cactivated\u201d envelope glycoprotein trimer that can more easily, and with less specificity, facilitate membrane fusion and virus entry. recently, a new group of related ASLV viruses has emerged in chickens that have tentatively been grouped into a new envelope glycoprotein subgroup, K, based on sequence analysis. the envelope glycoproteins of a prototypic ASLV-K isolate, JS11C1, are 86% identical to the SR-A subgroup A glycoproteins with the majority of the amino acid variation occurring in the SU glycoprotein hypervariable regions."}
