{"summary": "air quality indices are temperature, relative humidity,1 and levels of carbon dioxide, particulate matter,2,3 toxic metals,3 volatile organic compounds,1 bacteria,2,4\u20136 fungi,5,7,8 and viruses. previous studies focused on intensive care units,4,7,10,11 operating rooms,12,13 negative-pressure patient isolation rooms,6,9. small bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a pathogenic agent of community-acquired pneumonia in children and young adults. RNA analysis of such samples at distance of 700 cm from the bedside may be useful for identifying small RSV-containing particles in hospital wards. ubiquitous objects in hospitals have been shown to harbor adenovirus,35,36 varicella-zoster virus,37,38Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomon patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, measles, or varicella are always placed in negative-pressure isolation rooms. patients with clinically suspected enteroviral infections, such as herpangina or hand, foot, and mouth disease, are segregated in a given set of rooms. caregivers of patients with documented influenza follow these guidelines as much as possible. air sampling was performed 1.2 to 1.5 m above the floor (i.e., in the breathing zone) indoor air was filtered through a plastic cassette with a 0.2 m polytetrafluoroethylene filter. filters were stored immediately at 80\u00b0C until analysis. 116 air samples were collected for quantitative analysis of the viruses and M pneumoniae. the PCR products were amplified and detected by using an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system. the PCR thermal profile was 30 min at 48\u00b0C, 10 min at 95\u00b0C, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 58\u00b0C. the PCR products were amplified and detected by using the CFX96 real-time detection system. the concentrations of adenovirus and M pneumoniae in the filter samples were quantitatively measured. patients with clinically suspected enteroviral infections, such as herpangina or hand, foot, and mouth disease, are segregated in a given set of rooms. caregivers of patients with documented influenza follow these guidelines as much as possible. air in the ward rooms was air-conditioned but not heated during the study period. 116 air samples were collected for quantitative analysis of the viruses and M pneumoniae. swabs were immersed in 2 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. 500 L of each sample was extracted, and nucleic acid was eluted at a final volume of 30 L. for negative controls, sterile distilled water was used in place of the sample. PCR reaction mixtures contained 5 L RNA, 20 L 2 TaqMan universal master mix. the detection limits in the real-time PCR assay were 1 and 100 copies/mL for RSV and enterovirus, respectively, and 10 copies/mL for the other viruses and M pneumoniae. the figures were constructed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. influenza A virus was found on the call buttons (15.38%) and the door knobs of the bathrooms and ward rooms (10.26%; Figure 1B). the detection rates for M pneumoniae were also high; the call buttons and television remote control buttons had the highest rates. the light switches had the lowest rate (16.67%; Figure 1D). plasma pneumoniae, RSV = respiratory syncytial virus. 7teen patients excluded from final analysis because viral or bacterial infection could not be confirmed in their clinical specimens. one door knob sample was positive for M pneumoniae. adenovirus and M pneumoniae were the most prevalent airborne pathogens in the pediatric outpatient department and emergency rooms. in this study, aerosol particles containing adenovirus and M pneumoniae were also found in the ward rooms at the 2 locations tested. previous studies indicated that adenovirus was frequently found on the surfaces of the furnishings in hospitals. istance samplings did not represent the potential \u201cairborne\u201d transmission mode. david frum: we could not evaluate the effects of disinfection. he says the number of patients enrolled and the number of pathogens examined were relatively small. frum: appropriate infection control measures should be strictly implemented."}
