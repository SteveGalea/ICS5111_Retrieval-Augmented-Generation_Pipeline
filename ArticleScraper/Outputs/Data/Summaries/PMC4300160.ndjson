{"summary": "bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BoCV) are endemic to cattle populations in most countries, causing respiratory and/or enteric disease. organically managed dairy herds have been shown to have lower seroprevalence of both viruses compared to conventionally managed (CM) herds. the incidence of herds becoming seropositive was balanced by herds becoming seronegative. it should be possible to lower the prevalence of these two infections."}
