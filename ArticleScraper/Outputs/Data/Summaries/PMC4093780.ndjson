{"summary": "polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) infiltrate the airways early after infection by respiratory viral pathogens including rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and coronaviruses. presence of PMN in the respiratory tract during viral infection is frequently correlated with clinical symptoms or severe disease pathology. PMN have direct antiviral activities and also function in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. the presence of PMN corresponds to increased disease severity in humans and animals infected with SARS-CoV or human CoV-229E. despite these findings, the functions of PMN during respiratory CoV infections are not well understood. rodent models of respiratory coronavirus infection are available for SARS-CoV, but not the more common and milder CoV that circulate in human populations worldwide. PMN recruitment to the lungs of rats was inhibited using antibody-mediated depletion to determine the role of PMN in viral clearance, lung pathology and disease severity. rats were injected with rabbit anti-rat PMN serum (PMN) 1 day prior to intranasal inoculation of virus. rats were injected with PMN or normal rabbit serum (NRS) intraperitoneally 1 day prior to intranasal inoculation with RCoV or medium (mock) blood was collected from 3\u20135 animals per group daily to monitor white blood cell populations. data are meansse from 6\u201318 rats per treatment per day. NRS-treated rats infected with RCoV showed no or only minor clinical signs during infection. RCoV infection resulted in multiple clinical signs, including hunched posture, ruffled fur, swollen face and neck, bloody ocular and nasal discharge and lethargy. these rats had significantly increased mean clinical scores between days 1 and 8 post-infection. PMN treatment reduces PMN recruitment and prolongs viral replication in the lungs. rats were injected with PMN or NRS intraperitoneally 1 day prior to intranasal inoculation with RCoV. NRS/RCoV rats initially lost weight, which they regained after day 3. clinical signs were apparent on days 2\u20138 post-infection and were identical to those seen in rats given PMN throughout infection. clinical signs were apparent on days 2\u20138 post-infection and were identical to those seen in rats given PMN. hypothesize that PMN have an indirect role in the effective response against RCoV infection. RCoV infection induces cellular infiltration into the alveolar spaces. histological analysis of lung tissues was performed on PMN-depleted rats. representative tissues from three animals per group are shown at 2 (top panels), 20 (middle panels) and 40 (bottom panels) magnification. examples of cell types at 40: neutrophil (#),macrophage (*) and lymphocyte (*) are indicated. reduced levels of CXCL-1 and CXCL-3 in the BALF correspond to lack of PMN recruitment to the lungs of depleted animals. both chemokines were induced by RCoV infection in NRS-treated rats. ELISAs were used to quantify the concentrations of chemokines in the airways during RCoV infection. type I alveolar epithelial cells are primary cell type infected by RCoV within the distal lung. RCoV-infected AT1-like cells direct PMN functions in vitro. mRNA levels of 84 cytokines and chemokines were measured from PMN. PMN were isolated from rat bone marrow and incubated for 4 h in conditioned medium. RNA was isolated from the PMN and analysed using quantitative RT-PCR arrays specific for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. ions in all animals that were analysed on day 4 corresponded to increased numbers of PMN in the airways. in rats that received PMN only early during infection, no lesions were visible on the lungs. in rats that had low numbers of PMN also had low total protein concentrations. 0/6 0.8 (0.1) NRS RCoV day 4 22.1 (1.3)*** 5/5 (P = 0.0011) 16.1 (3.3)** PMN mock 2.3 (2.0) 0/6 0.9 (0.3) PMN RCoV day 4 0.6 (0.6) 0/5 0.5 (0.2) PMN RCoV day 8 3.5 (1.1) 0/5 2.3 (0.9) Early NRS mock 6.8 (5.8) 0/6 0.3 (0.2) Early some alveoli of NRS/RCoV rats contained transudate fluid, dead cells and inflammatory cells. most of this inflammation was resolved by day 8 (Fig. S2). inflammatory cells were absent in PMN-treated rats on day 4 post-infection. transudate-filled alveoli indicating alveolar oedema (E) were diffusely distributed in the lesions and congested capillaries were found throughout the sections. PMN depletion enhances RCoV-mediated disease There is robust recruitment of PMN to the respiratory tract during RCoV infection. PMN treatment depletes circulating PMN and increases disease severity during RCoV infection of rats. rats were injected with PMN or normal rabbit serum (NRS) intraperitoneally 1 day prior to intranasal inoculation with RCoV or medium (mock), and every 48 h thereafter. NRS-treated rats infected with RCoV showed no or only minor clinical signs during infection. RCoV infection resulted in multiple clinical signs, including hunched posture, ruffled fur, swollen face and neck, bloody ocular and nasal discharge and lethargy. these rats had significantly increased mean clinical scores between days 1 and 8 post-infection. PMN-treated rats cleared the virus by day 8 post-infection. recruitment of PMN to the respiratory tract correlated with effective clearance of RCoV from the lungs. transient PMN depletion resulted in 50 % mortality by day 8. of the six animals that died during the study, one succumbed to infection. five were euthanized due to more than 20 % weight loss and severe disease. clinical signs were apparent on days 2\u20138 post-infection and were identical to those seen in rats given PMN throughout infection. RCoV infection induces cellular infiltration into the alveolar spaces. RCoV infection induces cellular infiltration into the alveolar spaces. PMN treatment significantly reduced the numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes in the lungs of RCoV-infected animals. NRS intraperitoneally 1 day prior to intranasal inoculation with RCoV. lungs were formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded, and haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were analysed for cellular inflammation. inflammatory cells were quantified in lung sections from three animals per group. PMN-treated rats had significantly reduced levels of CXCL-1 and CXCL-3 in the BALF. chemokines were induced by RCoV infection in NRS-treated rats. ELISAs were used to quantify the concentrations of chemokines in the airways. PMN recruited to the airways of RCoV-infected rats produce cytokines and chemokines, including CXCL-1, CXCL-3, IP-10 and CCL-2. RCoV-infected AT1-like cells direct PMN functions in vitro. mRNA levels of 84 cytokines and chemokines were measured from PMN. PMN were isolated from rat bone marrow and incubated for 4 h in conditioned medium from RCoV-infected or mock-inoculated AT1-like cells. RNA was isolated from the PMN and analysed using quantitative RT-PCR arrays specific for proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. RCoV infection of RCoV-treated rats resulted in gross pulmonary lesions in all animals that were analysed on day 4. the majority of NRS-treated animals did not have lesions on day 8. the presence of PMN on the lungs corresponded to increased numbers of PMN in the airways. % PMN in BALF* Rats with gross lung lesions positive/total BALF protein* (mg ml1) NRS mock 0.0 (0.0) 0/6 0.8 (0.1) NRS RCoV day 4 22.1 (1.3)*** 5/5 (P = 0.0011) 16.1 (3.3)** NRS RCoV day 8 1.3 (0.7) 1/5 1.8 (1.3) PMN mock 2.3 (2.0) 0/6 0.9 (0.3) PMN NRS/RCoV rats had severe bronchiolar and peribronchiolar inflammation, necrosis and epithelial sloughing. some alveoli contained transudate fluid, dead cells and inflammatory cells. most of this inflammation was resolved by day 8 (Fig. S2). Lungs of NRS/RCoV rats had peribronchiolar inflammation with sloughing of bronchiolar epithelium () and alveoli (A) filled with inflammatory cells and necrotic cell debris. transudate-filled alveoli indicating alveolar oedema (E) were diffusely distributed in the lesions. this antibody is widely used to deplete PMN in rats. but most studies do not report the effects on other cell populations. RCoV infection of PMN-treated rats resulted in clinical signs consistent with infection by this viral strain. PMN is a source of chemokines, including IP-10, CCL-2, CXCL-1 and CXCL-3, in the airways during RCoV infection. RCoV infects AT1 cells in the lungs and induces expression of chemokines that activate functional responses of PMN. analyses demonstrated robust cellular inflammation in the lungs and airways of RCoV-infected rats. the numbers of circulating lymphocytes were not altered directly by PMN treatment. we hypothesize that reduced numbers of lymphocytes in the respiratory tract of PMN-treated rats was due to the absence of PMN. experimental depletion of PMN in other coronavirus infection models has resulted in a range of outcomes. this may reflect their complex roles in both viral clearance and immunopathology. infected mice with a neurotropic murine coronavirus, JHMV, causes increased viral titres in the brain and a more rapid decline to death. studies to determine the role of PMN in pathogenesis of influenza virus infections have also generated disparate conclusions. depletion of PMN in mouse models of highly virulent influenza infections results in decreased disease severity, suggesting a role for PMN in pathogenesis. 8-week-old male Fisher 344 rats (Harlan Laboratories) were used for infections. rats were injected intraperitoneally with 300 l of PMN or NRS 1 day prior to infection. surviving animals were euthanized on day 8 or 12 for tissue analyses. amine ml1 and 12 mg xylazine ml1 were inoculated intranasally with 200 l of RCoV (4\u20135105 p.f.u.) or supernatant medium from mock-inoculated L2P-41a cells. rats were monitored daily for clinical signs, including: eye and nasal discharge, 2) lethargy, 3) sneezing or coughing, 4) ruffled fur, type 2 alveolar epithelial cells were isolated and trans-differentiated in vitro to AT1-like cells (Miura et al., 2007; Rzepka et al., 2012). RNA was isolated from PMN and mRNA levels were quantified using Rat Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors RT2 Profiler Arrays (SABiosciences/Qiagen) s from BALF were incubated with FITC-conjugated CD4, CD8 or isotype control antibodies (Biolegend) ten thousand events per sample were collected using FACS-Aria (Becton Dickinson) data were analysed using FlowJo version 7.6.5. rats were anaesthetized with 80 mg ketamine ml1 and 12 mg xylazine ml1 and inoculated intranasally with 200 l of RCoV (4\u20135105 p.f.u.) rats were monitored daily for clinical signs including: eye and nasal discharge, lethargy, sneezing or coughing, ruffled fur, hunched posture, porphyrin-stained eye secretions cell-free BALF was used for quantification of protein by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and chemokines by ELISAs (R&D Systems, Thermo Scientific, Lifespan Biosciences) cytokine gene expression by PMN in vitro. sections were deparaffinized, stained with haematoxylin and eosin (Sigma-Aldrich) pathology was analysed by a blinded pathologist. systematic random sampling was performed on representative lung sections from three animals per group to photograph. rats were injected intraperitoneally with 300 l of PMN or NRS 1 day prior to infection. surviving animals were euthanized on day 8 or 12 for tissue analyses. six animals for each of the mock groups were monitored for morbidity and mortality. rats with minor clinical signs received 1\u20133 points, those with more severe clinical signs received 4\u20137 points, and dead animals received a clinical score of 8. euthanized rats flushed the lungs with 10 ml of saline 2\u20133 times. Lungs were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. pathology was analysed by a blinded pathologist (O.B.B.)"}
