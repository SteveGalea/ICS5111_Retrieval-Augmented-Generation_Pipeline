{"summary": "arenaviruses are classified into Old World (OW) and New World (NW) arenaviruses (2). they encode four viral proteins: the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L protein, the small zinc finger Z protein, the viral nucleoprotein precursor (GPC) OW Lassa fever virus (LASV) is clinically the most important arenavirus. an early IFN response has been found to be protective in a lethal LASV nonhuman primate infection model (16) clinical studies have revealed elevated levels of serum IFN- (2,000 to 64,000 IU/ml) and proinflammatory cytokines in NW arenavirus JUNV-infected patients, which correlate with the severity and fatality of AHF diseases. arenavirus genomic RNAs form 5\u2032-triphosphate-containing, panhandle structures at the ends. viral genomic RNAs and viral mRNAs contain highly structured intergenic sequences. PKR contains two N-terminal dsRNA-binding motifs and a C-terminal kinase domain that is normally inactive. the replication of JUNV and MACV was less efficient in PKR-deficient cells, suggesting that PKR may facilitate JUNV and MACV infection. our data provide new insights into host and arenavirus interactions and highlight the diversity and complexity of host responses to various pathogenic arenaviruses. 549 cells increased substantially at 48 hpi and reached peak level at 72 hpi. total amount of PKR increased simultaneously with PKR phosphorylation. PKR activation was not detectable in HEK293 cells, HEK293 cells, or the primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the expression levels of MACV NP and LASV NP in HEK293 cells are shown (B) the immunoblotting data for JUNV, MACV, and LASV NP in HEK293 cells and MoDCs are not shown. eIF2 phosphorylates host translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and further causes translation arrest. phosphorylation of eIF2 in virus-infected human cells (MOI = 1) at different time points after infection. sodium arsenite treatment remarkably upregulated eIF2 phosphorylation in cells. human HEK293 cells were mock infected with pathogenic NW arenaviruses JUNV and MACV (A) or infected with OW arenavirus LASV and MACV (B) at an MOI of 1 for 48 h (C) the positive controls for eIF2 phosphorylation were prepared by incubating cells with medium containing 250 M sodium arsenite or prewarmed growth medium (mock treatment) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% nascent polypeptides are then immunodetected by a puromycin-specific monoclonal antibody. the puromycin-labeled polypeptides were readily detected with this assay. no signals could be detected in the absence of puromycin. puromycin (10 g/ml) was immunodetected by a monoclonal antibody. no newly synthesized protein was detected. treatment with cycloheximide (500 M) drastically diminished the signal of detected proteins. in wt and PKR-deficient A549 cells, the upregulation of eIF2 phosphorylation was ablated at 24 hpi and diminished at 48 hpi. only a low level of PKR activation was observed in wt A549 cells at the same time point. LASV infection did not upregulate eIF2 phosphorylation in either wild-type or PKR-deficient A549 cells. at 24 and 48 hpi, cellular protein lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting for p-PKR, PKR, p-eIF2, eIF2, viral NPs, and human -actin. data were normalized to the levels of the housekeeping gene for human -actin and are presented as the means SEM from three experiments. the arenavirus infection experiment was repeated at a lower MOI. increased NP expression was observed in wt A549 cells compared to that in PKR-deficient A549 cells at 48 and 72 h after infection. the LASV titer and NP expression were relatively higher in PKR-deficient cells than in wt A549 cells at 48 and 72 h after infection. wt and PKR-deficient A549 cells were mock infected or infected with pathogenic NW JUNV or MACV or OW LASV at an MOI of 0.3. at 24, 48, and 72 hpi, cellular protein lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting for viral NPs and human -actin. PKR activation and eIF2 phosphorylation in wt and PKR-deficient A549 cells after arenavirus infection (MOI = 3) profound levels of inhibition of protein translation were still observed in wt and PKR-deficient A549 cells (60 to 70% reduction) these data suggest that it is highly likely that another molecular mechanism(s) might also contribute to the translation suppression during JUNV and MACV infection. the IFN- mRNA level was increased approximately 7-fold in PKR-deficient cells over that in wt A549 cells at 24 h after JUNV and MACV infection. wt A549 cells and PKR-deficient A549 cells were mock infected or infected with pathogenic NW JUNV, MACV, or OW LASV. RIG-I is a host non-self RNA sensor that is activated by recognition of the PAMP often present in viral RNAs. it is highly likely that viral RNAs of NW pathogenic JUNV and MACV are detected by the host non-self RNA sensor RIG-I during infection. PKR activation was also identified in JUNV-infected A549 cells. PKR activation in human cells infected by pathogenic arenaviruses is not detectable in HEK293 cells or the primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. hek293 cells were mock infected or infected with JUNV, MACV, or LASV at an MOI of 1. cell lysates were prepared at the indicated times after infection. pIC induced PKR activation to similar degrees in LASV-infected and mock-infected cells. LASV did not inhibit pIC-mediated PKR activation. infection by human-pathogenic NW JUNV and MACV resulted in upregulation of eIF2 phosphorylation. level of phosphorylated eIF2 was elevated considerably in MACV-infected cells. level of phosphorylated eIF2 was similar to that in mock-infected cells. MACV infection (MOI = 1) also upregulated eIF2 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells at 48 hpi. protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting to detect phosphorylated eIF2 (Ser51) the same blots were stripped and reprobed to detect total eIF2. pIC transfection (2 g/ml) for 6 h led to shutdown of translation in A549 cells. pathogenic NW arenaviruses JUNV and MACV caused translation arrest. pathogenic OW arenavirus LASV only slightly affected protein synthesis. a nonradioisotope protein labeling technique was used to monitor nascent polypeptide synthesis in infected cells. PKR is known for its antiviral activity (30, 31) since infection with the pathogenic NW arenaviruses JUNV and MACV readily activated PKR, we further studied the potential impact of PKR activation on virus replication. LASV infection did not upregulate eIF2 phosphorylation in either wild-type or PKR-deficient A549 cells at 24 and 48 hpi. these results demonstrate the role of PKR in upregulation of eIF2 phosphorylation during JUNV and MACV infection. PKR-deficient A549 cells were constructed by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. the viral RNA levels for JUNV and MACV were relatively higher in wt A549 cells than in PKR-deficient cells at 24 and 48 hpi. the titers of JUNV and MACV were also marginally higher in wt A549 cells than in PKR-deficient cells. the replication of OW LASV was slightly augmented in PKR-deficient A549 cells. the LASV titer and NP expression were lower at 24 hpi in PKR-deficient cells than in wt cells at 48 and 72 h after infection. at 24 h after JUNV and MACV infection, no upregulation of p-PKR (p-PKR) or p-eIF2 was identified in wt A549 cells compared with mock-infected A549 cells. at 24, 48, and 72 hpi, cellular protein lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blotting for viral NPs and human -actin. titers were determined at the indicated time points and are presented as the means SEM from three experiments. wt A549 cells or PKR-deficient A549 cells were mock infected or infected with JUNV, MACV, or LASV. the relative translation level was quantitated by densitometry analysis. PKR did not interfere with JUNV and MACV replication. 49 cells and PKR-deficient A549 cells were mock infected or infected with pathogenic NW JUNV, MACV, or OW LASV at an MOI of 3. real-time RT-qPCR analysis was performed to quantitate IFN- mRNA at 24 hpi. pathogenic NW arenavirus JUNV and MACV infections readily elicit an IFN response in human cells (21) vRNAs of arenavirus contain a 5\u2032-triphosphate-containing panhandle structures compromising the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of genomic RNAs and the highly structured intergenic regions. vRNAs of arenavirus contain a 5\u2032-triphosphate-containing panhandle structures. PKR is another classical host non-self RNA sensor. it is activated directly after dsRNA binding and autophosphorylation. pathogenic NW arenaviruses JUNV and MACV readily activated PKR response in various cell types. PKR has been found to not be critical to the RIG-I-dependent IFN response (40) in PKR-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and PKR-deficient A549 cells, Flu-delNS1 infection stimulates stronger IFN- mRNA expression than that in wild-type MEFs and A549 cells (40). PKR phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2 and renders eIF2 as having a high affinity for the GTP exchange factor eIF2B. eIF2-GTP-MettRNAi formation and eIF4E activity regulation are two major rate-limiting steps in translation initiation (41). eIF2 phosphorylation may also contribute to moderate upregulation of eIF2 phosphorylation in LASV-infected HEK293 cells in the absence of PKR activation. Activation of the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase/RNase L pathway suppresses host protein synthesis. UNV has been proposed to replace eIF4E to initiate translation from viral mRNA (47) however, the translation efficiency of viral mRNA is independent of NP (48) eIF4E is involved in LCMV protein synthesis and that the LCMV NP less likely replaces eIF4E in the eIF4F complex (49). a better understanding of virus-host interactions and their pathogenesis will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics against infection by these highly pathogenic viruses. a better understanding of virus-host interactions and their pathogenesis will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics against these highly pathogenic viruses. monocytes were positively selected with CD14-specific microbeads. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 6 days. half of the medium was removed and replaced with fresh differentiation medium. the PKR HDR plasmid was cotransfected to replace the cleaved PKR gene on human chromosome DNA with a red fluorescent protein (RFP)-encoding gene and a drug selection gene. two days after transfection, cells were selected by 1 g/ml of puromycin-containing medium for 1 week. cell lysates were harvested by using 2 SDS-PAGE buffer (Bio-Rad) containing protease inhibitor cocktail for mammalian cells (P8340; Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (P5726 and P0044; Sigma) then incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. RNA extraction and real-time RT-qPCR was performed. the copy numbers of viral RNAs in each sample were determined by using plasmid DNA templates that contained 102 to 109 copies of corresponding viral NP genes as standards. qPCR primers for detection of human GAPDH and actin genes were purchased from Bio-Rad. primary antibodies used for WB analysis were monoclonal antipuromycin antibody (clone 12D10; Millipore); rabbit anti-PKR phosphor (T451) antibody (ab81303; Abcam); rabbit anti-PKR phosphor (T451) antibody (ab81303; Abcam); rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2 antibody Ser51 (number 9721S; Cell Signaling); rabbit anti-iSG15 antibody (number 2743; Cell Signaling); the immunoblotting data for JUNV, MACV, and LASV NP in moDCs are not shown here but have been reported in our previous study (22).
