{"summary": "palivizumab was implemented in nunavut primarily for premature infants or those with hemodynamically significant cardiac or chronic lung disease. but the effectiveness of the program is unknown. ut is divided into three geographical regions: Kitikmeot (Western), Kivalliq (Central) and Qikiqtani (or Baffin) (Eastern), with estimated populations of 5361, 8348 and 15,764, respectively, of whom nearly 85% are Inuit (24). the number of births in nunavut in 2009 and 2010 was 812 and 835, respectively. the final dose was given during the week of June 22, for a maximum of seven doses, due to prolonged RSV seasons. the GN provided a data set of all identified palivizumab candidates with the reasons for eligibility, timing and dosage of palivizumab received. residual nasopharyngeal aspirate collected from prospectively enrolled infants was frozen at 70\u00b0C, transferred in batches and processed at the regional Virology Laboratory, McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario) the study was administered through the Applied Health Research Centre, St Michael\u2019s Hospital (Toronto, Ontario) and was licensed through the Nunavut Research Institute. the effectiveness of palivizumab would be overestimated if there was a large number of infants eligible for palivizumab who were neither identified nor admitted with an LRTI. a sensitivity analysis was conducted for the most extreme situation in which the maximum number of eligible infants were missed. the effectiveness of palivizumab would be overestimated if there was a large number of eligible infants eligible for palivizumab who were neither identified nor admitted with an LRTI. sensitivity analysis was conducted for the most extreme situation in which the maximum number of eligible infants were missed assuming the upper limit of potentially eligible infants was 8%. ivizumab candidates were cross-referenced with all LRTI admissions that occurred in the respective RSV seasons. one infant who was admitted with an LRTI was excluded due to lack of viral testing. study identified 26 hospital admissions of the remaining 93 infants. adenovirus PCR 9 6 26 No Yes Yes RV/EV PCR 10 3 34 No Yes Yes Negative PCR 12 6 32 No Yes Yes Negative PCR 12 6 30 No Yes Yes Negative EIA 13* 6 31 Cardiac Yes Yes RSV, RV/EV, influenza A (H1N1) PCR 14 6 31 No Yes No RSV, parainfluenza PCR 15 3 33 No No No RSV PCR 16 6 31 No No No RSV PCR 17 3 ative EIA 26 12 29 No Yes Yes Negative EIA 27 6 35 No Yes Yes Negative EIA 28* 6 28 No Yes Yes RSV PCR 29 6 36 No Yes No RSV PCR 30 3 35 Cardiac No No No Adenovirus PCR 31 3 35 No No No Negative EIA 34 3 34 No No Negative EIA * Vaccine failure; Only given palivizumab after hospital admission for RSV, classified as unvaccinated. five of the 10 eligible infants who did not receive adequate prophylaxis were admitted with RSV (Figure 2). the rate of RSV hospitalization for the infants not or inadequately prophylaxed with palivizumab (50%) was significantly higher than the rate for the infants who had received RSV prophylaxis (2.2%) OR 22.3 (95% CI 3.8 to 130; P=0.0005) the effectiveness of palivizumab is higher than that in any other subgroup of at-risk infants in the RSV-IMpact study (4) or any Canadian subpopulation currently eligible for prophylaxis (21) the effectiveness of palivizumab is higher than that in any other subgroup of at-risk infants. a recent budget impact analysis of a cohort on Baffin Island projected the number needed to prevent one RSV hospitalization to be 3.9 for rural Inuit infants 6 months of age regardless of gestational age. the lack of effectiveness data from this cohort has been a barrier to expanding the program to term Inuit infants. a retrospective chart review was conducted in the Qikiqtani region where RSV testing had been performed at the discretion of the attending physician. because the present study was observational in nature, the number of and other variables for unprophylaxed infants could not be controlled. a study of future RSV seasons with enhanced and systematic identification of eligible infants would provide more information. palivizumab in at-risk infants should be considered for future expansion of prophylaxis to incorporate term infants in regions with high prevalence rates of RSV."}
