{"summary": "study is a cross-sectional study conducted at the prince Mohammed international airport in al-Madinah al-Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia between august and September 2014. non-random purposive sampling was conducted to target workers at higher risk of acquiring infection from travellers. male and female workers were targeted during recruitment. but staff not in direct contact with the pilgrims was excluded. purposive, non-random sampling was performed to recruit the targeted sample. study used open-ended questions as a tool for data collection. all completed questionnaires were transcribed and reviewed after data collection. similar responses to open-ended questions were grouped after data collection. questionnaire was constructed by a focus group including 4 consultants from the community and family medicine. questions measuring demographics, level of knowledge, practice and attitude were used. all questionnaires were filled out during personal interviews. females only represent a minority of the workers at prince Mohammed airport. most of the recruited subjects had secondary or above degrees. twenty-six percent of recruited subjects were health professionals. most non-health workers reported not receiving any training. only a minority of non-health workers were aware there is a rapid response team or infection control at the airport. most of the trained health workers received their training when they were present at the airport during the season. study conducted by al-Ghamdi and Kabbash11 investigated the knowledge of health workers regarding preventive measures against communicable disease. the proportion of health workers who were aware of specific preventive measures in our study varied between 32-97%. study was able to detect multiple systematic flaws indicating organizational difficulties rather than individual incompetence. there was a significant lack of a competent system to deliver health-related knowledge in a timely manner, especially in important events such as the Hajj season. a preparedness plan should be in place to address any public health concerns at the airport. this plan should include systematic and practical methods of updating the airport workers with any public health concerns at the airport. a specific channel of knowledge sharing should be initiated to enhance knowledge of the airport workers of the current public health concerns. the limitations of this study were related to the small sample size and the refusal of security personnel to participate. however, proper identification of the investigators, illustration of the study aims, and taking notes as an alternative for audio recording might have reduced this measurement bias."}
