{"summary": "the aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the KRG extract on the ILI incidence in healthy adults. a total of 100 subjects 30-70 years of age will be recruited from the general populations. a total of 100 subjects 30-70 years of age will be recruited from the general populations. primary outcome measure is to assess the frequency of ILI onset in participants. secondary variable measures will be included severity and duration of ILI symptoms. results will be scored by subjects using a 4-point scale. the putative active compounds derived from ginseng root processing are the ginsenosides (saponin glycosides), and the water-soluble poly and oligosaccharides [16]. ginseng polysaccharide preparations increased cytokine production and mRNA expression by murine macrophages and spleen cells in vitro. study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-armed parallel clinical trial, comparing the KRG extract to placebo. subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups, either the KRG group or placebo group. the allocation ratio will be 1:1 in blocks of 2. Randomization will be performed at. random numbers will be generated by a computerized random-number generator. each envelope contains a number that is concealed to the treatment allocation. randomization sequence and allocation will be concealed to all study subjects until completion of the study. Item need to be performed during the visit 1 Sex, date of birth, age, contact address and phone number 2 Include present illness, past history taking 3 Frequency of ILI symptom onset, severity of ILI symptoms, and duration of ILI symptoms 4 Blood test (WBC, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets count, AST, ALT, ALP, gamma-GTP, albumin, BUN, creatinine, glucose, total bili subjects will be recorded daily symptom severity in a journal using a 4-point severity score index (0 = no symptom, 1 = mild symptom, 2 = moderate symptom and 3 = severe symptom) questionnaire for Influenza-Like Illness Symptoms Score Duration (days) nonattendance (days) sore throat 0 1 2 3 Runny nose 0 1 2 3 Nasal congestion 0 1 2 3 Sneezing 0 1 2 3 Hoarseness 0 1 clinical laboratory tests, including AST/ALT, BUN/creatinine, red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, number of differentiated cells will be determined at weeks 0 (baseline) and 12 (end of the trial). each subject will be notified regarding the study protocol. Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject. study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. subject information and consent forms will be sent to interested individuals to read over prior to scheduling their first visit. randomization After enrollment, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups, either the KRG group or placebo group. randomization will be performed at a site remote from trial location. the individual's randomization code and group allocation can be identified. Outcome measures Subjects will be asked open-ended questions about frequency, severity, and duration of ILI symptoms during telephone follow-ups on days 1, 28, 57, and 85 of treatment and days 35 post-treatment. any unfavorable or unintended sign or symptom will be documented. primary outcome The primary outcome is the frequency of ILI onset. Item need to be performed during the visit 1 Sex, date of birth, age, contact address and phone number 2 Include present illness, past history taking 3 Frequency of ILI symptom onset, severity of ILI symptoms, and duration of ILI symptoms 4 Blood test (WBC, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets count, AST, ALT, ALP, gamma-GTP, albumin, BUN, creatinine, glucose, total bili 0 1 2 3 Hoarseness 0 1 2 3 Myalgia 0 1 2 3 Earaches 0 1 2 3 Fever 0 1 2 3 Headache 0 1 2 3 Cough 0 1 2 3 Total score 0: None symptoms 1: Mild symptoms 2: Moderate symptoms 3: Severe symptoms Primary outcome The primary outcome is the frequency of ILI onset during study period. Item need to be performed during the visit 1 Sex, date of birth, age, contact address and phone number 2 Include present illness, past history taking 3 Frequency of ILI symptom onset, severity of ILI symptoms, and duration of ILI symptoms 4 Blood test (WBC, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets count, AST, ALT, ALP, gamma-GTP, albumin, BUN, creatinine, glucose, total bili a value of p 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. the effects of KRG extract or placebo treatment on the frequency, severity, and duration of symptoms related to ILI and adverse events will be analyzed. blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, number of platelets, and number of differentiated cells will be determined at weeks 0 (baseline) and 12 (end of the trial) Vital signs of each subject will be checked with monitoring of adverse events (nausea/vomiting, fatigue, allergic reaction, and any adverse events related to KRG extract intake) after each visit. clinical laboratory tests, including AST/ALT, BUN/creatinine, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, number of differentiated cells will be determined at weeks 0 (baseline) and 12 (end of the trial) Vital signs of each subject will be checked with monitoring of adverse events (nausea/vomiting, fatigue, allergic reaction, and any adverse events related to KRG extract intake) after each visit. the ginseng extracts has been studied in 3 recent RCTs to prevent the common cold, the flu, or upper respiratory infections. two studies did not show differences between the ginseng extract and placebo in terms of decreasing duration, severity, and frequency of symptoms [25,26]. if this study will be successfully performed, the KRG extract may offer beneficial effects in reducing ILI incidence."}
