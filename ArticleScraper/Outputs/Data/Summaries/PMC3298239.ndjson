{"summary": "the study was conducted in a suburban area and its extended farming villages, Xiqing County of Tianjin, china, where a SARS outbreak occurred in late spring of 2003. animal samples, blood and fecal swab specimens, for antibody and RNA detection were collected from the sites. fecal samples, designated TJB and TJF, were negative. the animal later died giving birth. we also tested serum samples from the swineherd on the farm. anti-swine immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody. serum samples from a convalescent SARS patient and healthy persons were used as positive and negative controls. a viral isolate, TJF, performed cross-neutralization experiments. this sequence has been found in all coronavirus isolates of animal origin except from the pig identified in this study. therefore, direct viral transmission of SARS-CoV from a human host to the pig bearing TJF is most likely. the only person in close contact with the animals is the swineherd, whose serum samples were negative for SARS-CoV on all tests. a strong warning should be issued to prevent such a practice, or regulatory procedures should be instituted to block this route of disease propagation."}
