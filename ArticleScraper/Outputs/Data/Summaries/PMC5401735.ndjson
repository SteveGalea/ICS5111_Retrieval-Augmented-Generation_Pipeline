{"summary": "the utility of this method decreases when the mixture may be released inadvertently to the environment, or the drug is regulated, such as controlled substance. alternative approaches have focused on long-acting drug implants made by combining a drug with biodegradable envelops composed of lipids. a 0.65 mg/kg dose of a lipid-buprenorphine suspension provides blood concentrations of drug greater than 0.7 ng/mL for 2-3 days. a standard analgesiometric test confirmed the efficacy of the intended 0.65 mg/kg dose. Surgically treated rats were injected with multiple overdoses of the drug suspension. reovirus, sendai virus, choriomeningitis virus, rat coronavirus, sialodacryoadenitis virus, rat parvovirus, rat theilovirus, rat theilovirus, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycoplasma pulmonis, and pinworms were housed during the quarantine and acclimation period. the intended label dose of 0.65 mg/kg was established in bioequivalence trials and efficacy studies to be described using male and female rats. in both safety trials, the lowest dose of drug tested was twofold greater than the intended label dose of 0.65 mg/kg. anesthesia was performed to mimic the implantation of an implantable pump or a telemetry device. each rat was anesthetized by isoflurane gas at approximately 3%. the duration of the procedure was approximately 2 minutes. drug suspension consisted of buprenorphine, cholesterol, and glycerol tristearate. the drug suspension consisted of buprenorphine, cholesterol, and glycerol tristearate. each rat was injected with the designated dose of test article or buprenorphine-free control suspension following surgery. the plasma was stored at 20\u00b0C until it was thawed for analysis. the sensitivity of the assay was 0.5 ng/mL. the sensitivity of the assay was 0.5 ng/mL. tremors, ocular discharge, facial signs (squinting, eyes closed), posture, and overall appearance including condition of the hair coat and grooming. animals received detailed clinical observations once daily after 2 PM for abnormal clinical signs (ocular discharge, motor activity, and signs of pain or distress) 0.5 mL of the endpoint sample was transferred to a collection tube containing dipotassium EDTA. 1 mL was transferred to a collection tube containing sodium citrate for coagulation factor measurements. the samples were refrigerated before analyses. tissues were placed in an individually labeled container containing 10% neutral-buffered formalin. for short term studies, testes and eyes with optic nerves were transferred from modified Davidson's solution to 70% ethanol. the transfer was performed and documented by the histology lab. parathyroid glands were evaluated when present in the plane of section of the thyroid gland, thyroid (with parathyroid), testis (male), kidneys, and skeletal muscle (biceps femoris). mmary glands (females), stomach, eyes with optic nerve, ovaries (females), ventral skin, gall bladder, pancreas, heart, and parathyroid gland. Sentinel rats considered negative for pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus, sendai virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, rat coronavirus, sialodacryoadenitis virus, rat parvovirus, rat theilovirus,

during the procedure. drug suspension consisted of cholesterol and glycerol tristearate (96 : 4) suspended in medium-chain triglyceride oil (8 mg/100 uL), trade name Animalgesics for Mice. each rat was injected with the designated dose of test article or buprenorphine-free control suspension following surgery. the samples were stored on ice for approximately 1 hour and then centrifuged to collect plasma. the plasma was stored at 20\u00b0C until it was thawed for analysis. the rats were injected with vehicle, 0.65, and 1.3 mg/kg dose of drug. incision sites were examined at the 9 AM time for bleeding, swelling, and signs of infection. animals received detailed clinical observations once daily after 2 PM for abnormal clinical signs (ocular discharge, motor activity, and signs of pain or distress) the midpoint sample was transferred to a collection tube containing dipotassium EDTA. 0.5 ml of the endpoint sample was transferred to a collection tube containing dipotassium EDTA.

survived to the scheduled termination date in both trials. minor wounds on the front paw or wrists associated with excess grooming and self-gnawing were noted in the drug treated animals. three of the animals in the vehicle control group of the repeat-dose trial exhibited this behavior. no signs of pain or distress were noted in the animals. male rats treated with 6.5 mg/kg buprenorphine lost weight between days 0 and 4. all females treated with the same dosage gained weight. male rats in the 6.5 mg/kg dose group treated with 3 doses in 8 days gained the least amount of weight by day 12. no significant changes in organ weight measurements with increasing doses of drug in either male or female rats in the single-dose trial. the average weight of adrenal glands in male rats increased from 0.050 to 0.074 g in the highest dose group. average differences in values between control and drug groups were noted in 9 of 14 hematology values and 14 of 16 clinical chemistry parameters. differences between control values and values from animals seen at 1.3 mg/kg dose levels were not seen in the 3.9 and 6.5 mg/kg dose levels. kaline phosphatase (ALP) can be altered by physiologic or pathologic changes in various tissues including kidney, hepatobiliary, intestine, and bone. decreased levels of ALP have been associated with loss of appetite and fasting. 0.2 6 2 5.8 0.4 5.6 0.2 5.5

inflammatory changes (granulocytic infiltration and mixed cell infiltrates) and hemorrhage were commonly seen at increased severity at or near the dorsal skin injection sites in rats in the 6.5 mg/kg dose group. similar changes were seen in the vehicle control group. high thermal latency measurements at days 4 and 5 at 0.65 mg/kg dose level are surprising. results consistent with studies of an extended release buprenorphine depot in human volunteers showing blood level decreases of drug below 0.75 mg/ml at the end of the first week. both conjugates have biologic activity [39] and may be relatively undetected in standard LC/MS assays. studies of chronic buprenorphine therapy using transdermal skin patches. in all cases, reported hyperalgesic signs have been minimal in rats and humans. in all cases, reported hyperalgesic signs have been minimal in rats and humans. weight loss has been cited as a deterrent to the use of postsurgical buprenorphine analgesia. it has been linked to significant morbidity secondary to gastrointestinal blockage associated with hardwood bedding."}
