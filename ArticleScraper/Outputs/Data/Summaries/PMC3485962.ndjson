{"summary": "nonporous fomites can be important vehicles in the transmission of viral disease. exposure can occur through touching and transfer of pathogens present on the fomite to the hands and then to the mouth, nasopharynx, and eyes (5, 24) exposure can also be from the inhalation of reaerosolized organisms from contaminated fomites. only two survival studies and two SRE studies have been conducted at surface densities ranging from 0.02 to 50 PFU or at the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/cm2. these factors may have a significant effect on quantifying the risk to human health after decontamination. 106 TCID50/ml 1 10 3.4 104\u20136.3 104 TCID50/cm2 NR NR NR NR 1\u20136 days 38 Bacteriophage P22 1 109 PFU/ml 10 10 107 PFU/cm2 NR 50 25 36 days 20 Calicivirus 107 TCID50/ml 1 20 2.0 105 TCID50/cm2 NR NR NR 4\u201372 h 10 Coronavirus 104\u2013 enteric adenovirus NR 1 20, 50, 100 N/A PBS or FS 50 5, 85 5, 90 5 4, 20 5\u201360 days 1 Poliovirus NR 1 20, 50, 100 N/A PBS or FS 50 5, 85 5, 90 5 4, 20 5\u201360 days 1 Rotavirus 103\u2013105 PFU/ml 250 Misted N/A Distilled water, distilled water with 10% FS NR NR 0.75\u20131.5 h 18 Influenza A virus 2 ID50/cm2 NR 55\u201356 26.7\u201328.9 24\u201348 h 3 Parainfluenza 1.5 100, 1.5 103, 1.5 104 TCID50/ml 32 500 0.02\u20132.0 102 TCID50/cm2 Minimum essential medium with Earle's salts NR 22 6\u201310 h 7 Rhinovirus 107 PFU/ml 0.79 10 1.3 105 PFU/cm2 Tryptose phosphate broth ted N/A Distilled water, distilled water with 10% FS NR NR 42.3% 1.9% 18 Norovirus 2.0 107 RT-PCRU/ml 10 100 2.0 103, 2.0 104 RT-PCRU/cm2 10% PBS NR NR 10.3% 13.0%\u201351.9% 38.5% 28 Rotavirus 2.0 105 RT-PCRU/ml 10 100 2.0 101, 2.0 102 RT-PCRU/cm2 10% PBS bacteriophage P22 is a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) icosahedron-shaped virus with a short tail (52 to 60 nm in size) the virus belongs to the family Podoviridae (30) the fomites and testing area were disinfected with 70% ethanol. the average amount of bacteriophage P22 applied to the fomite was 433.1 194.5 PFU, approximately 8.66 PFU/droplet. the premoistened wipes are generally used to remove dirt, dust, and fingerprints from office equipment. the control experiments conducted with bacteriophage P22 suspensions indicated that 95% of bacteriophage P22 could be recovered with inoculation directly onto the wipe and dissolution with PBST. very high recovery rates were also seen at time zero on the fomites with no drying. 1-l droplets of bacteriophage P22 inoculated in 950 l of PBST were dispensed into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. the survival of bacteriophage P22 on fomites was evaluated. 50 5-l droplets containing an estimated 3.96 PFU/droplet were applied on a polystyrene petri dish surface (100 by 15 mm) in a grid formation. a positive-control experiment consisted of 50 5-l droplets of bacteriophage P22 inoculated in 750 l of PBST in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. rH and temperature in the laboratory were measured before each experiment with a digital rH and temperature meter (VWR Scientific Products) the average temperature of the laboratory during these experiments was 20.8 0.23\u00b0C (mean standard deviation) previous studies support the use of a wetting agent applied to the recovery material (wipe or swab) to enhance the SRE (9, 17, 18, 28) there were no statistical differences between the SREs when PBST or TSB as the wetting agent was applied on the fomite surface. the data (%SRE) had considerable differences in variance, especially between 0 min and 20 min. after analyzing the residuals, it was determined that the normality assumption of the residual did not fit the equation; therefore, the residuals were fitted under the assumption of a gamma distribution.

PBST and TSB performed similarly on acrylic, galvanized steel, and laminate. a premoistened wipe recovered bacteriophage P22 at the initial application time (0 min) and after drying (20 min) each bar represents the average result from nine plates. the average SREs for the experimental data at 0 min were 21% 6.9% for acrylic, 26% 3.1% for galvanized steel, and 42% 19.2% for laminate. bacteriophage P22 was directly applied onto a petri dish. decay rates for bacteriophage P22 were 7.97 102 h1 when applied in TSB. after 1 h, when the 5-l droplets were visibly dry, the majority of the applied bacteriophage P22 was still infective. SREs from the 100-cm2 fomite surface area are signified by triangles. each point of the SRE data represents the mean and standard deviation of results from nine plates. impact of wetting agent at varying relative humidity. higher average SREs were observed at rHs of 28 to 32% and 55 to 58%. the mean predicted SRE was predominantly lower for the rH range of 9 to 23% than for those at the other two ranges. the effects of rH on SREs with the other application media were less obvious than those with water. low surface densities will require sampling of larger surface areas. the application medium TSB produced higher SREs than PBST and water. it has been suggested that suspension in more complex media may affect resistance to desiccation. the studies used cotton swabs to recover rotavirus, poliovirus, and bacteriophage f2 immediately after applying the samples to the fomite. a negative sample result does not ensure the absence of infectious agents and the absence of the potential risk of exposure. the decay rates for bacteriophage P22 on the petri dish were estimated to be 7.97 102 h1 when applied in TSB and 6.81 102 h1 when applied in water. the difference between the decay rates from Masago et al. (20) and this study were most likely due to the sample concentrations. the TSB wetting step improved the SREs for all cases at 20 min. the results doubled in the majority of the cases, especially when the application medium was TSB. however, this TSB wetting step may have physically dislodged the viral particles, resulting in a higher SRE than without the TSB wetting step (36). efficient sample recovery and detection methods are essential. bacteriophage P22 from fomites at concentrations near the limit of detection were influenced most by the time of sampling, fomite surface area, the use of a wetting agent, and rH."}
