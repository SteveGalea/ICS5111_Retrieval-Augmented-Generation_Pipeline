{"summary": "phi29 polymerase based amplification methods provide amplified DNA with minimal changes in sequence and relative abundance for many biomedical applications. RNA virus detection using microarrays can present a challenge because ligation of cDNA fragments is necessary prior phi29 polymerase amplification. bacteriophage phi29 polymerase with random primers allows DNA synthesis in amounts compatible with downstream use of DNA microarrays. resequencing technology using microarrays is very promising for bacterial and viral pathogen detection and identification. about half a dozen approaches have been developed for random whole genome amplification upstream of SNP detection methods (e.g. Omniplex\u00ae technology [6], DOP-PCR [7,8], LA-PCR [9,10], PCR with universal linker [11] and linear amplification for genomic DNA [12]. this enzyme mix was composed of 2 l of 10 RT Buffer for SSIII. 4 l of 25 mM MgCl2, 2 l of 0.1 M DTT, 1 l of 40 U/l RNaseOUT. the final mix was submitted to the following steps: 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 45\u00b0C for 90 min and 95\u00b0C for 5 min. amplification of viral RNA and bacterial DNA was based on the WTA amplification process. after the ligation step, a nucleic acid denaturation was performed by adding 2 l of denaturating solution available in Repli-g MIDI kit (Qiagen) the final amplification step was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) oside triphosphate mixture; 10.6 l of pure water; 0.5 M each of forward (5' GACTATTATTGGTTGATACACCTG 3') primers. 5 l of diluted template DNA solution was added to each glass capillary. the fragment amplification step is followed by a melting curve analysis. RNA extraction Total RNA from brain biopsies (5\u201310 mg) were obtained using 1 ml of TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis for RA was performed in a 200 l tube. this enzyme mix was composed of 2 l of 10 RT Buffer for SSIII. 4 l of 25 mM MgCl2, 2 l of 0.1 M DTT, 1 l of 40 U/l RNaseOUT. final mix was submitted to the following steps: 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 45\u00b0C for 90 min and 95\u00b0C for 5 min. the cDNA synthesis step was replaced by the reverse transcription protocol. amplification of viral RNA and bacterial DNA was based on the WTA amplification process. after the ligation step, a nucleic acid denaturation was performed. l of pure water and 0.5 M each of forward (5' GACTATTATTGGTTGATACACCTG 3') primers were added to each glass capillary. 5 l of diluted template DNA solution was added to each glass capillary. the fragment amplification step is followed by a melting curve analysis. DNA yields and amplification factors for WTA and RA Phi29 polymerase require DNA templates larger than 2 kb, which exceeds the size of the smallest RNA strands of segmented RNA viruses (e.g. influenza viruses) DNA yields obtained using RA methods were compared for three different viral RNA genomes. WTA DNA yields were 1.21 0.06 g/l, 0.98 0.27 g/l and 1.42 0.08 g/l respectively. these yields greatly exceed those observed with RA (0.02 0.01 g/l, 0.06 0.02 g/l and 0.012 0.004 g/l, respectively) the high amplification ratio obtained with WTA allowed the detection of RVFV irrespective of the copy number of input viral RNA into the amplification process. the low amplification ratio observed with RA is irrelevant in clinical situations as it requires a very high viral load for detection. the viral amplification using WTA was performed with seven viruses representative of the size diversity of viral genomic RNAs. this included positive and negative strand genomes as well as non-segmented and segmented genomes. this data confirmed that the WTA method amplified viral cDNA from a cell culture supernatant and identified the virus after hybridization. amplification of viral RNA and bacterial DNA was performed using an optimized WTA protocol. cDNA from viral RNA was amplified, whatever the quantity of viral genome tested. similar results were obtained after the co-amplification of the RVFV cDNA and the DNA of a cowpox virus. 106 copies Final yield in copies Rift Valley Fever Virus 1.5 104 copies SA: 2.1 0.9 109 RVFV: 2.1 0.3 1010 RVFV: 1.4 0.1 1011 RVFV: 3.8 2.7 107 1.5 106 copies SA: 8.2 1.7 108 RVFV: 1.37 0.03 1011 SA: 1.4 0.2 1011 RVFV: 2.5 0.7 109 All the quantifications, both before and after amplification, were determined by water controls amplified by WTA yield as much as 0.9 g/l of non-specific DNA. in the absence of a DNA template, water controls amplified by WTA yield as much as 0.9 g/l of non-specific DNA. the low amplification ratio observed with RA is irrelevant in clinical situations as it requires a very high viral load for detection by microarrays. human (n = 2), mouse (n = 10) and dog (n = 2) rabies-infected brain extracts were tested. all samples were found positive for the presence of rabies virus with a minimum call rate of 40%. the WTA method amplified viral cDNA from a cell culture supernatant. virus identification was accomplished using BLAST analysis of DNA sequence determined using the resequencing chip. similar results were obtained after the co-amplification of the RVFV cDNA and the DNA of a cowpox virus. cDNA from viral RNA was amplified, whatever the quantity of viral genome tested. two viruses belonging to phylogenetically distinct genera (Vesiculovirus and Lyssavirus) were identified with a call rate of 96.8% and 73.6% respectively. the lower call rate obtained for dengue 2 virus might be due to secondary structures in the target sequence. the simultaneous amplification of cDNA from bacterial and viral RNA would be useful for the characterization of many different types of pathogens that cause similar symptoms, such as respiratory syndromes. samples containing 15 genome copies of viral RNA per target per reaction could be amplified with WTA, to a yield compatible with most of the detection methods used in diagnosis.
