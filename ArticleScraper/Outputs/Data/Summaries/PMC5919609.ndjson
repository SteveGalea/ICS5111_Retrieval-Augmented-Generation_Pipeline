{"summary": "healthcare workers from western countries were hesitant to volunteer. 1.4\u20138.7% died of Ebola, compared to 0.02\u20130.11% of the general population. there is still very little insight into the experiences of volunteers. online questionnaire was sent to 646 volunteers who were deployed by six of the eight organizations. the questionnaire was completed by 251 respondents. the median time between deployment and the time of completing the questionnaire was 373 days, range 82\u2013772) respondents consented to participate in the study and were aware that their responses would be used for research purposes. we asked the respondents to assess their fear of stigmatization after they returned from the mission. we asked them to assess their fear of stigmatization after they returned from the mission. my family were worried about being infected with the Ebola virus 46.8 20.4 8.0 14 8.0 1.2 1.6 My family were worried about being infected with the virus themselves 24.6 18.1 12.5 24.6 12.9 3.6 3.6 Stigma I was afraid of being stigmatized after my return 43.8 14.5 8.8 18.1 10.4 1.6 1.6 1.6 One to four items of data were missing from each statement in this table. questionnaire was opened by 302 recipients and completed by 251 respondents. median time between deployment (the first day of the initial month of deployment) and time of completing the questionnaire was 373 days, range 82\u2013772) any volunteer who had been on multiple missions was asked to report on only one mission. I have a greater sense of closeness with others 4.8 3.2 4.4 36.1 26.9 13.7 10.8 I can do better things with my life 3.6 4.0 2.8 38.0 23.6 15.6 12.4 I have established a new path for my life 9.2 7.2 6.0 39.4 19.7 8.8 9.6 I know better that I can handle difficulties better than before this deployment 3.2 2.4 4.0 22.4 20.4 25.6 22 I have discovered that I am stronger than I thought I was 4.0 respondents agreed with the statements included in the questionnaires on a 7-point Likert scale. we calculated the sum scores by adding up the scores within each domain. most volunteers (45%) were 26 to 35 years old and 27% were 36 to 45 years old. volunteers aged 26\u201335 years were better at establishing a new path for their lives than volunteers aged 36\u201355 years. we found no differences between the age groups for the other items in this domain. 10 percent of the respondents said they were worried about being infected with the Ebola virus. 11% were worried about infecting their family members with the virus. a study population of 251 volunteers found no differences between the five age groups. volunteers aged 26\u201335 years were better at establishing a new path for their lives than volunteers aged 36\u201355 years. we found no differences between the age groups for the other items in this domain. over 26% of the respondents reported their temperature to the authorities in charge. 10% said they were worried about being infected with the Ebola virus. 15% were afraid of being stigmatized after their return. a study of the experiences of healthcare workers caring for a suspected Ebola patient found that over 30% reported that their partners were disturbed by the restrictive control measures. the study found that healthcare workers are better informed about the risks and protective measures than their family members are, which reduces worry and anxiety. however, family members\u2019 anxieties can influence the volunteer\u2019s decision to participate in such a mission. volunteers who experienced the mission as positive might have been more prone to complete the questionnaire, causing selection bias. the questionnaire did not provide data from people who wanted to volunteer but did not because their families did not want them to. the response rate for this study was 38%. the results of our study could be used as a starting point to aid the workforce in preparing healthcare workers for their tasks. it must be kept in mind that healthcare workers might have experiences similar or less positive than our volunteers."}
