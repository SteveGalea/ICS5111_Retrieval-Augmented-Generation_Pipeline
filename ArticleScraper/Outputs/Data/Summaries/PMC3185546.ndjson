{"summary": "IBV is a pathogen of domestic chickens that causes acute, highly contagious respiratory disease. it contains a single, positive-strand RNA molecule, which is about 27.6 kb long and has a cap at the 5\u2032end and poly (A) tail at the 3\u2032end. the first 20 kb genome is made up of ORF1, which is a replicase gene. out of 106 isolates made, three were not neutralized by any kind of serum. the Md27 antiserum has an unusually broad spectrum of minor cross-reactions with the other viruses. the spike protein gene of Md27 is 3507 nucleotides long (1168aa) the spike protein is cleaved into S1 and S2, of which S1 produces serotype specific antibodies. the protein is closely related to the SE17 strain (96% identity) and exhibits 86% identity with other IBV strains. there is a notable deletion of 3 nucleotides in the S1 gene between nucleotides 69 and 70. 96(95) 97 98 95(91) 97(96) NA NA 96(95) 96 NA Beaudette 83(80) 94(93) 86 84 88(82) 91(93) 86 93 89(91)88 85 Cal99 82(79) 94(93) 97 98 93(88) 96(95) 99 99 99 96(96) 91 89 Connecticut 83(80) 95(96 NA HK 83(80) 95(95) 91 98 98(95) 99(98) 99 98 96(95) 44 NA Holte 83(78) 94(94) NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ind/TN/92/03 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 94(94) NA NA IS/1366 77(74) NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA gene 3 codes for two non-structural proteins (3a and 3b) and one structural protein (E), which is a small membrane protein of coronavirus. gene 3a overlaps 3c by 20 nucleotides and 3a has a signal sequence at the very 5\u2032 end (nucleotides 1\u201322) RNA 5 of Md27 encodes for two nonstructural proteins, 5a and 5b. there is a 350 nucleotides long non-coding region between gene M and 5. the N protein is the only phosphorylated structural protein in coronaviruses. the 3\u2032UTR of Md27 is closely related (97\u201398% identity) to Ark DPI, DE072, Beaudette, Gray, M41, Jilin and CU-T2. it is a highly variable region of the coronavirus genome. it has been observed that the 3\u2032 UTR is involved in genome replication of coronaviruses. the tree is constructed from aligned nucleotide sequences of structural genes (S1, S2, spike gene; E, envelope gene; M, matrix gene; N, nucleocapsid gene) the scale at the bottom indicates the number of substitution events. the complete structural genome analysis of Md27 suggests that it is a chimera of virus genomes represented by the SE17, Conn, JMK and Ark 99 IBV strains. most of the nucleotide differences between Md27 and SE17 are in the S1 gene, especially in the hypervariable regions. the entire 7 kb genome of Md27 reveals that Ark DPI and Jilin share high levels of sequence identity with Md27. this study suggests that Md27 and Ark DPI are derived from the same ancestor, but diverged independently by recombination with different strains. all gene fragments were amplified using RT-PCR kit (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. reverse transcription was carried out with a reverse poly (T) primer (5\u2032-GCGGCCGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TT-3\u2032) and an internal gene specific forward primer.
