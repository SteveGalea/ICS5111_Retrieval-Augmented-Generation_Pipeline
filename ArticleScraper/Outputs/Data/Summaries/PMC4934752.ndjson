{"summary": "human defensins are effector peptides produced by the innate immune system with broad antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activities. they are produced by skin and mucosal epithelial cells, while enteric -defensins are produced by paneth cells in the small intestine. -defensin binding to the viral capsid allows entry but dramatically changes the intracellular trafficking of the incoming virus. changes in intracellular trafficking are the result of virus-specific differences in proximal events (e.g., blocking uncoating or preventing a host-mediated cleavage event) more than 90% of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasias are thought to be due to HPV infection of a population of cells at the squamocolumnar junction. the squamocolumnar junction is also thought to be more permissive to HPV infection due to a surface-exposed population of stem cells. a direct antiviral effect of -defensins during the initial infection should delay or reduce viral dissemination from the gut to the brain. only on day 11 were the viral loads in the brains and spleens of Mmp7/ mice significantly higher than in wild-type mice. this coincident with divergence of rates of survival and clinical presentations of Mmp7/ and wild-type mice. this study raises a number of interesting questions. Is immune stimulation dependent upon -defensin binding directly to the virus? will this response be dependent upon the effects of -defensins on viral infectivity in vivo? heparin sulfate proteoglycans bind to heparin sulfate proteoglycans on the surfaces of adult tonsil cells in vitro and cointernalize with HIV-1. virions that passed through fetal cells or through cells where HBD expression had been knocked down were infectious (22). despite the capacity to neutralize HIV-1 in vitro, higher HNP1\u20133 levels were unexpectedly correlated with an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition. a prospective study found that -defensin levels were 10-fold higher prior to HIV-1 acquisition in patients who eventually acquired HIV-1 (23). only HIV-neutralizing IgA was associated with protection. al activity in vivo highlights need for more studies in these areas."}
