{"summary": "acute respiratory infection (ARI) of viral aetiology is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide [1-4]. besides classical respiratory viruses (RV), i.e. influenza viruses (Flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-4, adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV) and human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 serology is not useful for the diagnosis of viral infections, such as ARI, that cause frequent recurrences. in these cases, direct detection of the virus in the site of infection has to be a priority. advances in diagnostic virology for detecting RV have been focused on nucleic acids amplification techniques. this article describes the molecular methods used to detect respiratory viruses and the contribution that increasing automation has made to improve laboratory diagnosis. the possibilities of integration of these new assays on each laboratory portfolio are also discussed. the combination of shell-vial assay with the inclusion of different cell lines in the same vial has facilitated the recovery of RV isolates from cell cultures. PCR assays can be carried out on the cell culture supernatant to detect the isolates. viral culture is not useful for detection of new RV, since they do not grow or grow poorly in cell culture. the mariPOC\u00ae system uses polystyrene microparticles as solid phase reaction carriers for the immunocomplex formation. Detection of the fluorescence signal is carried out by separation-free two-photon excitation fluorescence detection assay, the arcDiaTM TPX (TPX) most RV are RNA viruses except ADV. one-step RT-PCR protocols have been reported elsewhere for most RNA viruses. commercial kits have been developed for detecting the most prevalent RV. monoplex PCR is not useful in a clinical laboratory equipped enough to conduct an extended aetiological diagnosis. but the advent of the 2009 pandemic allowed many laboratories for equipping with the infrastructure necessary to carry out PCR assays for detection of pandemic flu. multiplex PCR assays have been the most widely used molecular methods for RV detection in laboratories of clinical virology capable of developing in-house and/or robust published protocols. sensitivity depends on the commercial assay, type of patient and/or sample, viral target. lower sensitivity for detection of RV in adults Immunofluorescence (1-2 h) Immunochromatography (15-30 min) NAAT Greater sensitivity than viral culture and antigen detection methods Method of choice. the availability of automated procedures for detecting RV is increasing day by day. commercial diagnostic kits are less versatile and often, more expensive than well-optimized in-house PCR. commercial diagnostic kits are less versatile and often, more expensive than well-optimized in-house PCR. commercial assays for the simultaneous processing of a maximum of 8 up to 96 samples are available. a good recovery of viral RNA and DNA, without significant differences among automated extractors, has been found. no evidence of the presence of inhibitors is observed as well. commercial assays (Prodesse\u00ae, Gen-probe), based on real-time PCR for detection of several RV, have received the FDA clearance. commercial assays (Prodesse\u00ae, Gen-probe), based on real-time PCR for detection of several RV, have received the clearance. pre-prepared, frozen real-time PCR reagents reduce turnaround times. other emerging amplification procedures have been described for RV detection. the combination of PCR and hybridisation using DNA arrays is the principle of recently developed commercial assays. the xTAG RVP Fast panel (RVP v2) is CE marked and identifies 19 viral types and subtypes, which now includes Flu A(H1N1)pdm09. no competition was observed in samples spiked with combinations of 2 RV. other automated detection formats have been used for RV NAAT. the latter is based on a multiplex RT-PCR followed a MLPA reaction. only two primers are used in the final PCR. available commercial fully-automated assays that detect Flu A, flu B and/or RSV are: Xpert Flu (Cepheid) that detects Flu A and Flu B and differentiates A(H1N1)pdm09 [48] and Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV kit (Focus Diagnostics) for detection and differentiation of Flu A, flu B and RSV. the filmArray\u00ae Respiratory Panel (Idaho Technology Inc.) is commercialised in the u.s. to fully automate the detection and identification of 21 respiratory pathogens from a single sample in about one hour. an unprocessed clinical sample is subjected to nucleic acid purification, RT, a high-order nested multiplex PCR and amplicon melting curve analysis in a closed disposable pouch. several commercial assays offer automated solutions for nucleic acids extraction, isolation and purification that range from low to high throughput. the high quality of nucleic acids obtained with these systems are suitable for a broad range of applications in nucleic acid research. commercial assays for simultaneous processing of a maximum of 8 up to 96 samples are available. commercial assays for the simultaneous processing of a maximum of 8 up to 96 samples are available. a good recovery of viral RNA and DNA has been found without significant differences among automated extractors. the monitoring of accumulating amplicons in real time is achieved by labelling primers, oligonucleotide probes or amplicons with fluorophores. the signal is related to the amount of amplicon present during each cycle and will increase as the amount of specific amplicon increases. commercial assays (Prodesse\u00ae, Gen-probe) have received the FDA clearance. a published protocol is able to detect 12 RV by a multiplex real-time PCR. it includes 4 tubes per sample and 3 viral targets per tube. pre-prepared, frozen real-time PCR reagents reduce turnaround times and increase reproducibility. Detection is performed using a streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin conjugate. each bead population detects a unique viral target by hybridisation to a specific anti-tag. a signal (median fluorescence intensity) is generated for each bead population. two pairs of gene-specific nested primers at extremely low concentration are used only for the initial enrichment. amplification is mediated with universal primers that bind to the inner nested primer pair. commercial assays offer automated solutions for nucleic acid extraction, isolation and purification that range from low to high throughput. commercial assays for simultaneous processing of a maximum of 8 up to 96 samples are available. a good recovery of viral RNA and DNA, without significant differences among automated extractors, has been found. real-time PCR assays are widely used in clinical laboratories. the principle of real-time PCR is that amplification of nucleic acid target is combined with simultaneous detection of amplicons in a single step. there is no need for manipulation of amplified products, which minimises contaminations due to amplicon carry-over. common PCR parameters of 45 cycles of denaturation at 95oC for 30 s and annealing and extension at 60oC for 60 s can be applied to any real-time assay. the technical disadvantage of real-time PCR is the limited number of fluorophores that can be included in a single assay. Luminex xTAG\u00ae RVP was the first panel that received the FDA approval. the version RVP Fast incorporates multiplex RT-PCR using primers with universal tags. each bead population detects a unique viral target by hybridisation to a specific anti-tag. RVP v2 detected RSV and H3N2 down to a 10-2 dilution. positive \u201cin-house\u201d PCR reached the 10-2 dilution. the detection is carried out in a similar instrument based on liquid hybridisation as the former. VERSANT kPCR Sample Prep System (Siemens), QIAsymphony (Qiagen), m2000sp (Abbott) and MagnaPure 96 (Roche Diagnostics) are examples of these platforms. this improvement reduces even more the hands-on-time by abolishing the manual step associated with preparation of PCR mixes. nanosphere Verigene\u00ae Respiratory Virus Nucleic Acids Test (Nanosphere) is a recently commercialised fully-automated assay similar to previous ones. it detects and differentiates flu A, seasonal H1N1, A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 subtypes, flu B and RSV A and B viruses.
