{"summary": "several ssRNA+ (positive sense single-stranded RNA) helicases have been isolated from all kingdoms of life, from virus to man. a recent article on anti-Flaviviridae chemotherapy has been published by Ghosh and Basu [13]. no specific antiviral therapy is available for the treatment of Picornaviridae infections. no retroviruses or ssRNA viruses have been reported to encode the synthesis of a helicase. in ssRNA+ viruses, the RNA helicases are implicated in several functions. all helicases bind NTP using two structurally common amino acidic sequences. motif I is a phosphate-binding P-loop that also interact with the ribose. motif II is a Mg2+ co-factor binding loop. helicase encoded by papillomavirus helicase is an SF2, nonring, 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 RNA helicase. the functional importance of helicases means that inhibitors or modulators for these enzymes are potentially important as therapeutic agents. over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the development of highly selective inhibitors as antiviral and anticancer drugs. some characteristics of helicase families of pathogen viruses belong to same ssRNA+ Viruses. helicase family helicase name In vitro activity Flaviviridae SF2 NS3 RNA stimulated NTPase West Nile virus SF2 NS3 RTPase 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 helicase Dengue fever virus SF2 NS3 3\u2032\u20135\u2032RNA helicase. the Flaviviridae is a large family of related positive-strand RNA viruses. the family includes two groups of viruses, GBV-A and GBV-C. they are currently unassigned to a specific genus. the world health organization estimates that over 170 million people worldwide are presently infected with this virus. most infections become persistent and about 60% progress towards chronic liver disease, that can lead to development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. this drug has limited efficacy and the sustained virological response rate is of 40\u201350% in genotype HCV-1 infected patients. helicase is part of the bi-functional NS3 protein, carrying three different enzymatic activities. the known HCV helicase inhibitors can be classified into the first four groups of those above cited. the same behavior has been put in evidence for paclitaxel, compound structurally nonrelated to NTP. the derivative is able to block the NTP-binding site (IC50 = 22 M) and to inhibit the ATPase activity (IC50 = 17 M) in a competitive way. TBBT resulted effective in HCV subgenomic replicon system in a comparable way to the inhibition reported in the enzymatic essays. the starting compounds 1H-benzotriazole (6) and 1H-benzimidazole (17), screened for their effect against the HCV-helicase, showed very low activity. 2-alkyl derivatives (10\u201312) were significantly more potent inhibitors of the enzyme (2- to 7- times) than the respective 1-alkylated analogues (7\u20139). in both 1-alkylated benzotriazoles (7\u20139) and 1-alkylated benzimidazoles (19\u201321), the inhibitory activity was very low and ranged between 250 and 500 M. this behaviour suggests that these inhibitors do not act by blocking the NTP binding sites of the enzymes a small hydrophobic moiety (methyl or ethyl) at position 2- of the tetrabromobenzotriazole could play a crucial role in the inhibition of the HCV NTPase/helicase. a ribofuranosyl ring in both benzotriazole and tetrabromobenzotriazole improves the water solubility but leads to a decrease of the inhibitory activity against HCV and all the enzyme the fat nucleosides 31, 32, and TBBT (4) and nogalamycin (see compound 76) have been used to construct a pharmacophore model for designing new Japanese encephalitis virus NS3 helicase/NTPase inhibitors. the REN 5\u2032-triphosphates, such as compounds 33 and 34 of Figure 9, did not influence the unwinding reaction while exerting their inhibitory effect. general method for the synthesis of the designed nucleosides (41\u201359) was involved. the modulation effect exerted by RENs can result in an inhibition or activation. the mechanism may involve the interaction of RENs with a DNA or an RNA substrate through binding to the major or minor groove of the double-helix. a new tab Chemical structure of 1-(2\u2032-O-Methyl--D-ribofuranosyl)imidazo[4,5-d]pyridazine-4, 7(5H, 6H)-dione (HMC-HO4) was identified as a good inhibitor that suppresses HCV RNA replication in the replicon cells through both the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and the RNA substrate binding. the most active compound, 3,5,7-tri[(40-methylpiperazin-10-yl)methyl]tropolone (63), inhibited RNA replication by 50% at 46.9 M (EC50), showing an IC50 = 3.4 M and a CC50> 1000 M (SI > 21), whereas the most efficient was 3,5,7-tri[(30-methylpiperazin-10-yl)methyl]tropolone (64), with an EC50 of 3 some new dimers containing benzimidazole, benzoxazole, pyridinoxazole, and benzothiazole rings were synthesized by ViroPharma. a significant decrease in potency was observed when the benzimidazole moiety was replaced by the benzoxazole or benzothiazole rings (compounds 67) a prototype of the symmetrical benzimidazolephenyl series, the N1,N4-bis[4-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)phenyl]benzene-1,4-dicarboxamide (BIP)2B, binds directly the HCV NS3 helicase in the same binding site for RNA. a peptide expressed in bacteria, composed of 14 amino acids, demonstrated to be the best enzyme inhibitor. a new selective inhibitor of the HCV helicase, QU663 (compound 73 of Figure 19) showed a potent and selective inhibition with Ki of 0.75 M [75] the study of the inhibition mechanism has revealed that QU663 is a specific inhibitor of the strand-displacement activity. QU663 could function as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the nucleic acid substrate. two anthracycline derivatives, doxorubicin and nogalamycin (76) have been shown to be effective inhibitors of the unwinding reaction catalyzed by HCV helicase. the limits in their application for the treatment of chronic viral infections are their high cytotoxicity and weak penetration into the cell. a large group of acridones were tested from Stankiewicz-Drogon et al. using the direct fluorometric helicase activity assay to determine their inhibitory properties towards the NS3 helicase of HCV. even the thiazolpiperazinyl acridone derivative 80 demonstrated to act as a potent agent against HCV replicons. oxy-6-(4-(thiazol-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)acridin-9(10H)-one 80. compound 81 came out as an efficient inhibitor of the NS3 helicase in the in vitro assay. also as a potent inhibitor of HCV replication endowed with low cytotoxicity for human hepatoma cells. ase/helicase by competitive mechanism in regard to ATP [46] and ribavirin 5\u2032-diphosphate (RDP), both reported in Figure 3, demonstrates to determine only a weakly enzymatic inhibition. the same behavior has been put in evidence for paclitaxel, compound structurally nonrelated to NTP. TBBT (more less DRBT) resulted effective in HCV subgenomic replicon system in a comparable way to the inhibition reported in the enzymatic essays. the starting compounds 1H-benzotriazole (6) and 1H-benzimidazole (17), screened for their effect against the HCV-helicase, showed very low activity. 2-alkylated derivatives (10\u201312) were significantly more potent inhibitors of the enzyme (2- to 7- times) than the respective 1-alkylated analogues (7\u20139) and 1-alkylated benzimidazoles (19\u201321) however, the inhibitory activity was very low and ranged between 250 and 500 M. this behaviour suggests that these inhibitors do not act by blocking the NTP binding sites of the enzymes. a small hydrophobic moiety (methyl or ethyl) at position 2- of the tetrabromobenzotriazole could play a crucial role in the inhibition of the HCV NTPase/helicase. a ribofuranosyl ring in both benzotriazole and tetrabromobenzotriazole improves the water solubility but leads to a decrease of the inhibitory activity against HCV and all the enzyme the REN 5\u2032-triphosphates, such as compounds 33 and 34 of Figure 9, did not influence the unwinding reaction while exerting their inhibitory effect. the nucleosides 36 and 37, in turn, were synthesized by Vorbr\u00fcggen ribosylation [57\u201360] of the respective heterocycles 35 and 38 [61, 62]. the general method for the synthesis of the designed nucleosides (41\u201359) was involved. the vorbr\u00fcggen ribosylation [53, 54] of dimethyl imidazole-4,5-dicarboxylate (39) [64, 65], followed by condensation of the resulting imidazole nucleoside (40) with the appropriately substituted guanidine derivatives. the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine is known to interact with domain 1 of HCV helicase. it is uncertain if inhibition results from conformational changes or from blockage of the ATP-binding site. the most active compound, 3,5,7-tri[(40-methylpiperazin-10-yl)methyl]tropolone (63), inhibited RNA replication by 50% at 46.9 M (EC50), showing an IC50 = 3.4 M and a CC50> 1000 M (SI > 21), whereas the most efficient was 3,5,7-tri[(30-methylpiperazin-10-yl)methyl]tropolone (64), with an EC50 of 3 benzimidazole, benzoxazole, pyridinoxazole, and benzothiazole rings could interact by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bound, respectively. a significant decrease in potency when the benzimidazole moiety was replaced by the benzoxazole or benzothiazole rings (compounds 67) a prototype of the symmetrical benzimidazolephenyl series, the N1,N4-bis[4-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)phenyl]benzene-1,4-dicarboxamide (BIP)2B, binds directly the HCV NS3 helicase in the same binding site for RNA in a competitive manner. also small peptides specifically inhibit HCV helicases, even in cells bearing H a new selective inhibitor of the HCV helicase, QU663 (compound 73 of Figure 19), showed a potent and selective inhibition with Ki of 0.75 M [75] QU663 is a specific inhibitor of the strand-displacement activity, without affecting the ability of NS3 helicase to hydrolyse ATP. a new rational approach for the design of selective inhibitors of the HCV helicase brought the discovery of a novel HCV heli two anthracycline derivatives, doxorubicin and nogalamycin (76) have been shown to be effective inhibitors of the unwinding reaction catalyzed by HCV helicase. the limits in their application for the treatment of chronic viral infections are their high cytotoxicity and weak penetration into the cell. a large group of acridones were tested using the direct fluorometric helicase activity assay to determine their inhibitory properties towards the viral NS3 helicase of HCV. even the thiazolpiperazinyl acridone derivative 80 demonstrated to act as a potent agent against HCV replicons (EC50 = 3 M) amino-1,3,10-trimethoxy-6-(4-(thiazol-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)acridin-9(10H)-one 80 came out as an efficient inhibitor of the NS3 helicase in the in vitro assay. compound 81 came out as a potent inhibitor of HCV replication endowed with low cytotoxicity for human hepatoma cells. hesus kidney-4cells infected with SARS-Cov, Bananin inhibited the viral replication (IC50 = 10 M) with low host cellular toxicity (CC50 = 390 M) in the last years various molecules have been detected showing an interesting and promising anti-Coronaviridae activity. stranded positive-sense RNA (ssRNA+) genome causes a dramatic variety of illnesses, including meningitis, colds, heart infection, conjunctivitis, and hepatitis. only CVB-2 and Sb-1 were inhibited by N-[4-(1H(2H)-benzotriazol-1(2)-yl)phenyl]alkylcarboxamide derivatives. 87e was the most active against CVB-2 (EC50 = 10 M and CC50 > 100 M) and 86h, which was the most active against Sb-1 (EC50 = 30 M and CC50 = 90 M) and 86h, which was the most active against Sb-1 (EC50 = 30 M and CC50 = 90 M), Figure 27 [95]. the bis-5,6-dichloro-benzotriazol-2-yl derivatives (80i\u2013k) showed very selective activity against CVB-2. the bis-5,6-dichloro-benzotriazol-2-yl derivatives (80i\u2013k) showed very selective activity against CVB-2 (EC50 = 4\u201311 M) class of inhibitors has almost doubled compared to that of the previous molecular series. it is impossible for the protein pocket to host N,N\u2032-bis[4-(1H(2H)-benzotriazol-1(2)-yl) phenyldicarboxamides with the same binding mode. however, in correspondence of the most favored binding mode, the formation of a new, small network of H-bonds between 89f and enzyme was observed. the binding site for 89i\u2013k is composed by 30 residues. according to their 2D alignment, the binding site for CVB-2 differs for 7 residues only. the positively charged side chain of Arg237 is placed at an average distance of 3.5 from the Cl atoms."}
