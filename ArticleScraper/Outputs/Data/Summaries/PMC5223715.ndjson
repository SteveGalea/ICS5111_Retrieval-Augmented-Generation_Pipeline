{"summary": "participants 245 index cases with ILI were randomly allocated to medical mask (n=123) and control arms (n=122) intervention index cases with ILI were randomly allocated to medical mask (n=123) most clinical trials have been focused on the protection of the well wearer, rather than on source control. masks were originally developed as source control to prevent contamination of sterile sites by the wearer in operating theatres. however, their effectiveness in preventing surgical site infections is yet to be proven. the aim of this study was to determine whether medical mask use by people in a community setting with influenza-like illness protects well contacts from infection. the fever clinics are outpatient departments for the assessment and treatment of febrile patients. index cases were asked to wear a mask when they were in the same room as a household member or a visitor to the household. index cases were given 3 masks per day for 7 days (21 masks in total) index cases were provided with 3 masks per day for 7 days. symptomatic household members were asked to complete \u2018sick follow-up\u2019 questionnaires and anyone who met the CRI definition was tested for laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections. each index case was asked to keep a diary to record activities, symptoms and daily temperatures for 7 days. swabs were taken at the home by trained investigators. double rayon-tipped, plastic-shafted swabs were used to swab both tonsillar areas and the posterior pharyngeal wall of symptomatic participants. swabs were then transported immediately after collection to the CDC. 385 participants were required in each arm, which was composed of 118 households. an estimated 250 patients with ILI were recruited into the study to allow for possible index case dropout. all statistical analyses were conducted using Stata V.13 (StataCorp. Stata 12 base reference manual) fever clinics in six major hospitals in two districts of china are outpatient departments for the assessment and treatment of febrile patients. index cases and 302 household contacts were included in the mask (source control) arm and 122 index cases and 295 household contacts were included in the control arm. intervention The mask or no-mask intervention was applied to the index cases and respiratory illness was measured in household contacts. symptomatic household members were asked to complete \u2018sick follow-up\u2019 questionnaires and anyone who met the CRI definition was tested for laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections. each index case was asked to keep a diary to record activities, symptoms and daily temperatures for 7 days. sample collection and laboratory testing Samples were collected from index patients at the time of recruitment and from symptomatic household members during follow-up. only those household members who provided consent were swabbed. sample size In this cluster-randomised design, the household was the unit of randomisation and the average household size was three people. an estimated 250 patients with ILI were recruited into the study to allow for possible index case dropout during the study. a total of 43 index cases in the control arm also used a mask during the study period. 7 index cases in the masks arm did not use a mask at all. a post hoc sensitivity analysis was carried out to compare outcomes among household members of index cases who used a mask (hereafter \u2018mask group\u2019) with those of index cases who did not use a mask (hereafter \u2018no-mask group\u2019). 40.2 (37.6 to 42.8) 39.7 (37.3 to 42.0) Education (undergraduate/postgraduate) 78/123 63.4% (54.6% to 71.4%) 74/122 60.7% (51.8% to 68.9%) Smoker (current/ex) 29/123 23.6% (16.9% to 31.8%) 26/122 21.3% (15.0% to 29.4%) Pre-existing illness* 21/123 17.1% (16.2% to 31.0%) 16 only one case (0.48/1000 person-days) of ILI was reported in the mask arm, compared with three cases (1.47/1000 person-days) in the control arm. one household member had the same infection (influenza H1N1) as the respective index case. the scale used in Kaplan Meier curves represents only a fraction of the 0\u20131 range. the duration of contact of index cases with household members was 10.4 and 11.1 hours in the mask and control arms. 159 index cases (65%) used a mask (mask group) compared with those of index cases who did not use a mask (no-mask group) three hundred and eighty-seven household members were included in the mask group and 210 were included in the no-mask group. model for mask versus no-mask groups (no randomization; n=597)* CRI HR (95% CI) ILI HR (95% CI) Masks group (index case) 0.22 (0.06 to 0.86) 0.18 (0.02 to 1.73) 0.11 (0.01 to 4.40) no-mask group (index case) Ref Ref Age (household) 1.03 (1.00 to 1.06) Bold values are statistically significant results. the study was underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference. the additional analysis by actual mask use showed significantly lower rates of CRI in the mask group compared with the no-mask group. masks are not designed for respiratory protection and are commonly used in the healthcare setting to prevent spread of infections from the wearer. the exhaled pathogen load would be much higher in a sick patient compared with a well surgeon. health organisations and countries recommend use of masks by sick patients as source control. despite lack of evidence, most health organisations and countries recommend the use of masks by sick patients as source control."}
