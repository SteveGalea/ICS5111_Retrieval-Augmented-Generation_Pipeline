PCR product was digested by HindIII and KpnI. plasmid was ligated to human ENaC pcDNA3.1-D1 for 2 ENaC. plasmid was designated as human ENaC pcDNA3.1-D2. oocytes were perfused with solutions containing different external Na+ concentrations. the osmolarity of all solutions was balanced with an equal molarity of N-methyl-d-glucamine. currents were determined before (0) and 2, 4, and 6 h after incubation with brefeldin A (10 g/ml) on-cell configurations were used to record single-channel currents. on-cell configurations were used to record single-channel currents using an Axopatch 200B amplifier. permeability ratios between Na+ and other cations (PNa/PX) were calculated using the differences in reversal potentials obtained when the same cell was continuously perfused with Na+-, Li+-, or tested cations (X) in the bath solution. z is the valence of the tested cations; R, T, and F have their usual meanings. analysis of single-channel data was performed using Clampfit 10.1. single-channel conductances of Na+ (Na) and Li+ (Li) ions were calculated as the slopes of the I-V curves. mean open time (MOT) and mean closed time (MCT) were calculated as previously described. two adjacent Gly 51 and Gly52 residues in the 2 tract were potential N-myristoylation sites. expression and distribution of 1 and 2 epithelial sodium channel subunits in human alveolar cells. the transcriptional level of 2 ENaC relative to GAPDH was quantitatively analyzed in 16HBEo, A549, and human lung tissues. ISH using single DIG-labeled probes showed the presence of 1 and 2 ENaC in human lungs. the lack of a specific antibody against 2 ENaC prevented us detecting 2 ENaC at the protein level in human lungs. oocytes expressing either 1 or 2 channels were perfused with bath solutions containing a variety of Na+ concentrations. cells were subsequentially perfused with bath solutions containing increasing Na+ concentrations ([Na+]out) from 0 to 120 mM. currents at various concentrations of external Na+ ions were normalized to the maximum level at 120 mM Na+ ions. whole cell Na+ currents for 1 and 2 were 5,043.3 748.9 nA and 8,935.7 977.8 nA. similar reversal potentials for Na+, Li+, and K+ were found between 1- and 2-containing channels. 0.27 0.07 1.10 0.68* MCT (Na+) 0.96 0.1 0.22 0.03 MCT (Li+) 0.38 0.15 1.42 0.49* Pharmacological features Amiloride (Kiamil, M 100 mV) 2.5 0.5 0.7 0.1* Capsazepine (EC50, M 100 mV) 11.9 0.2 6.3 0.3* External protons Activation time a, s 12.0 3.0 2.4 0.1 Des the gating pattern of 1 and 2 channels was significantly lower than that of 1 (P 0.01). the MCT value of 2 was significantly lower than that of 1 (P 0.01). the estimated Po value for 2 was greater than that of 1 (0.87 0.09 vs. 0.56 0.09) for Na+ ions. similar difference in Po values was observed for Li+ ions. the estimated Kiamil at 0 mV for 2 was significantly smaller (13.2 1.0 M vs. 41.2 1.3 M for 1, P 0.05) the plot was fitted with the woodhull equation to evaluate the voltage dependence. capsazepine activated inward currents at 100 mV in both 1- and 2-injected oocytes in a dose-dependent manner. the EC50 value of capsazepine for 2 channels was approximately half of that for 1 channels (6.3 0.3 M vs. 11.9 0.2 M for 1, P 0.05) 2 channels recovered much faster than 1 ENaC (12.0 3.0 s, vs. 10.1 0.4 s for 1 ENaC, P 0.01). gating of 2 channels by external hydrogen ions is approximately sixfold to tenfold faster than 1 channels. the increasing rate of benzamil-sensitive currents (IBS) is then a one-time measurement of the rate of ENaC delivered to the plasma membrane (11) the benzamil-sensitive currents (IBS) were normalized to the level (Ibasal) prior to MTSET incubation (IBS/IBS-basal) were plotted as a function of recording time. the channel activities of both 1 and 2 gradually increased within 25 min. feldin A was used to interrupt the delivery of newly synthesized 2 proteins to the plasma membrane via Golgi apparatus. the channel activity of 2 decreased progressively in 6 h. the calculated decay constants to reduce half of the initial current levels were 1.66 0.04 h, relatively slower than that for 1 (1.39 0.19 h, P 0.05). this suggests that the extension of the NH2-terminal tail may elongate the lifespan of 2 ENaC at cell surface. 1 ENaC (blue) in alveolar type I (ATI) and II (ATII) cells as labeled by specific anti-aquaporin 5 (AQP5) (brown) and anti-prosurfactant protein C (Pro-SPC) antibodies (red) each image was photographed with an magnitude of 20. probes showed the presence of 1 and 2 ENaC in human lungs. both ATI and ATII cells express 2 ENaC to a lesser extent compared with the 1 counterpart. in some cases, 1 and 2 were presented in the same alveolar cells. oocytes expressing either 1 or 2 channels were perfused with bath solutions containing increasing Na+ concentrations ([Na+]out) from 0 to 120 mM Na+ ions. currents at various concentrations of external Na+ ions were normalized to the maximum level at 120 mM Na+ ions. amiloride-sensitive whole-cell currents (IAS, nA) were plotted as current-voltage (I-V) curves in Fig. 2, C and D. the whole cell Na+ currents for 1 and 2 were 5,043.3 748.9 nA. cations were similar to other cations, as computed with the Nernst equation (Eq. 1). Table 1 shows characterized biophysical and pharmacological properties as well as protein lifespan. 0.4 1.0 0.1 Trafficking Delivery rate 29.2 17.9 26.6 4.2 Endocytosis rate 50, h 1.66 0.04 1.39 0.19* Values are expressed as means SE. one-way ANOVA test was used for comparisons. the closed (dashed line) and open levels were labeled. the scale bar for the x-axis is 5 s and 1 pA for the y-axis. the single-channel conductances of Na+ () and Li+ ions () were the slope values. 1 ENaC was less sensitive to amiloride with an IC50 value of 2.86 M (28-fold higher than ENaC) to examine the amiloride sensitivity of 2 ENaC, oocytes were perfused with solutions containing a variety of amiloride concentrations. amiloride sensitivity of 1 (A) and 2 (B) ENaC channels was computed by fitting the plots with the Hill equation; n = 7. the plot was fitted with the Woodhull equation to evaluate the voltage dependence within the electrical field. capsazepine is a specific activator of both types of ENaC channels. the 2 variant exhibits more sensitivity than extracellular proton activation. 1 ENaC has been proposed to be a candidate molecule for pH sensing in human gastrointestinal, neuronal, and skin tissues. the cytosolic amino-terminal tails of ENaC are well-known to possess key domains for protein exocytosis. 2 ENaC has a longer NH2-terminal tail with 66 more amino acids compared with its 1 counterpart. benzamil-sensitive currents (IBS) were determined by adding drug (100 M) all open channels were inactivated with [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (1 mM) the subsequent increment in currents was associated with new ENaC channel activity. 2 ENaC was predominately expressed in alveolar and airway epithelial cells. expression profile of 2 was similar to subunit in human lung epithelial cells. 2 ENaC does not coexpress with 1 counterpart in all alveolar cells. highly selective Na+ channels (9 pS) and moderately selective Na+ channels (18 pS) have been described in murine and human lung epithelial cells. the pharmacological profile of ENaC-comprising channels has been poorly investigated. however, neither 1 nor 2 channels were regulated by Evans blue in a dose-dependent manner. lack of specific inhibitors for ENaC prevents us from distinguishing native and ENaC-containing channels. ENaC is widely distributed throughout the brain and activated by protons. sensitivity of ENaC may be important mechanism for integrating external ischemic signals in inflamed and hypoxic tissues. the slower rate of endocytosis of 2 ENaC may result from the involvement of the extended N-terminal tails in the tyrosine-based endocytosis motifs in the NH2-terminal tails of and subunits. on the other hand, the rate of exocytosis for 2 channels is greater than that of 1 ENaC.
