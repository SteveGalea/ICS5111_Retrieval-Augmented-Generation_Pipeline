{"summary": "accurate mathematical modelling of infectious disease outbreaks is important as a tool to understand and predict epidemic dynamics and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies. traditional epidemiological modelling accounts for contact behaviour through both implicit and explicit mechanisms and at different levels of abstraction. contact networks explicitly define potential disease-transmitting connections between individuals as network edges. an alternative to these data-hungry strategies is a statistical approach, where a contact network model is inferred using available host and epidemic data within a likelihood framework. a key benefit to this approach is that, in addition to providing information on which contact network model likely produced the observed data, the likelihood of alternative models can be evaluated to see how justifiable that choice is in relation to those alternatives. ferential framework comparing model selection results for each individual epidemiological measure with ground truth (i.e. the network class that generated it) we also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from historical and recent outbreaks. we determine that only certain epidemiological statistics are informative and consistent in recovering the level of contact heterogeneity. the prior on the network models is taken to be uniform and independent of T, and N. we specify X, the data, in equation (2.1) to individually be four common epidemiological metrics. these metrics capture the impact of an epidemic on public health systems. the alternative approach would be to use an analytical epidemic model to generate a likelihood function for each epidemiological measure. a posterior probability is calculated for each model Mi using equation (2.1) the selected network model is the one with the highest posterior probability. networks of size N=10 000 for each degree distribution specified in equations (2.2)\u2013(2.4), where is chosen so that the mean degree is approximately 6 (0.1) transmission probabilities are chosen to represent a range of pathogens, from low-transmissibility pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome to more highly transmissible pathogens. high-resolution radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag-based network of face-to-face interactions lasting at least 10 min among students and staff at a California high school. we simulate 1000 epidemics on these empirical contact networks to produce replicate data on epidemiological measures, R0. data from empirical epidemic outbreaks come from studies that do not necessarily provide an estimate of the underlying contact network. in every case, an estimate of N and either an estimate of the mean degree or R0 were provided. in the summer of 2004, there was a norovirus outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands. in the summer of 2004, there was a norovirus outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands, which was divided into seven camps [37]. for the inference, we make the simplifying assumption that each camp did not mix with others and thus treat them as isolated epidemics. random graph models select three (m = 3) random graph models (Mi) of specified degree distributions. we select three (m = 3) random graph models (Mi) of specified degree distributions with: \u2014Poisson, with degree distribution 2.2 \u2014\u2018exponential\u20191, with degree distribution 2.3 \u2014scale-free. we use the configuration model [25] to generate instances of simply connected random graphs of size N and degree distribution as specified in equations (2.2)\u2013(2.4). subsequently, we perform Monte Carlo simulations for a susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) epidemic model with a single initial infected case and per-contact transmissibility, T, on these networks, generating frequency distributions for each epidemic measure to use as likelihood functions. in the first two testing stages, we have knowledge of the underlying contact network structure. we will use it to judge the classification of contact heterogeneity as inferred by our method. we generate 10 random networks of size N=10 000 for each degree distribution specified in equations (2.2)\u2013(2.4) the number of nodes, N, is provided in each study, and the transmission probability, T, is chosen so that an epidemic resulted in an expected final size of approximately 0.25N. we simulate 1000 epidemics on these empirical contact networks to produce replicate data on epidemiological measures, R0,,. for each dataset, we evaluate three one-parameter candidate distributions. we then use the Kullback\u2013Liebler divergence (K\u2013L divergence) to select the most appropriate degree distribution. the best-fit distribution for each dataset is presented in 3. a mean number of contacts per individual (mean degree) of 2.1 was measured in the study. a mean number of contacts per individual (mean degree) of 2.1 was measured in the study. a mean number of contacts per individual (mean degree) of 2.1 was measured in the study. we generate epidemic data on each of these networks with 10 000 SIR epidemic simulations, with transmissibilities, T, ranging from 0.1 to 0.5. transmission probabilities are chosen to represent a range of pathogens, from low-transmissibility pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome to more highly transmissible pathogens such as measles. high-resolution radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag-based network of face-to-face interactions lasting at least 10 min among students and staff at a California high school. we simulate 1000 epidemics on these empirical contact networks to produce replicate data on epidemiological measures, R0,,. data from empirical epidemic outbreaks come from studies that do not necessarily provide an estimate of the underlying contact network, but provide an estimate of at least one epidemiological measure: epidemic final size, peak size or duration. in every case, an estimate of the mean degree was provided, and either an estimate of the mean degree or R0 were provided. in the summer of 2004, there was a norovirus outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands. we use data provided on two camps that became infected: camp \u20181\u2019: N = 721, epidemic final size = 77, peak size = 19 and camp \u20182\u2019: N = 825, epidemic final size = 41, peak size = 16. eity is supported by the data, and which individual epidemiological metrics provide the most confidence towards this support. the four epidemiological measures (R0, and ) gathered from the synthetic epidemic data display different utilities as classifiers among themselves and, notably, among different transmission probability values. plot shows reliability of each epidemic metric-based classifier as measured by sensitivity, the true positive rate, and specificity, the true negative rate. each point on the plot represents a network class and a transmission probability, and the relative size of each point indicates the transmission probability. all four classifiers have the same number of points plotted. posterior probability values, P(Mi|X, T,,, N) are shown on the y-axis for all synthetic data classified. boxes are coloured in each cell to highlight the posterior values of the network type that actually generated the data. boxes represent the 95% equal-tail credible intervals and are only shown when the number of samples used to determine them was greater than 1000. the degree distribution of the adolescent sexual network (figure 3a) has a best fit of exponential (using the K\u2013L divergence values, given the MLE estimates) it is inferred by our model selection as Poisson based on the final size () and peak size () classifiers, but as exponential by the duration () classifier. the true degree distribution of this empirical network looks to be more complex than any of the three network classes. but its dominant feature, a dispersed peak with a moderate average degree, is most consistent with a Poisson distribution. the network is strongly modular and moderately assortative (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S7) but still acts like a random network with respect to epidemic outcomes. results are broken down by network class (colour) and epidemiological measure (shape) x-axis shows a range of either transmission probabilities (T) or mean degree () values depending on which was unknown for each study. for a measles outbreak from the small town of Haggelloch, Germany, the final size and peak size posterior likelihoods for each network class and various mean degrees suggest that the Poisson contact network is the most likely model. gonorrhea has a transmission probability lower than 0.55 due to characteristics of the bacterium itself. the scale-free model is a reasonable prediction in this case. degree distributions of human sexual contact networks have been shown to exhibit high levels of contact heterogeneity. synthetic epidemiological measures (R0, and ) gathered from synthetic epidemic data show different utilities as classifiers among themselves and among different transmission probability values. sensitivity indicates the proportion of positives for which the true network class is inferred as most likely. plot shows reliability of each epidemic metric-based classifier as measured by sensitivity, the true positive rate, and specificity, the true negative rate. each point on the plot represents a network class and a transmission probability, and the relative size of each point indicates the transmission probability. all four classifiers have the same number of points plotted. boxes are coloured in each cell to highlight the posterior values of the network type that actually generated the data. boxes represent the 95% equal-tail credible intervals. boxes represent the 95% equal-tail credible

measure (shape) results show a range of either transmission probabilities (T) or mean degree () values. final size and peak size posterior likelihoods for each network class suggest that the Poisson contact network is the most likely model. a has a transmission probability lower than 0.55 due to characteristics of the bacterium itself. the scale-free model is a reasonable prediction in this case. a norovirus outbreak from two camps in a children's summer jamboree strongly indicates that a scale-free network underlies the population in both cases. network epidemiology has come a long way in demonstrating the impact that the structure of these interactions (which make up the contact network) has on the progression of an infectious disease [5,11,24,49\u201352]. in this study, we have developed a predictive framework to show that common epidemiological measures can give important insights into the contact structure of a host population. ly transmissible pathogen is better classified by final size and in many cases by duration. the exception to the effectiveness of final size as the most reliable metric is that of an extremely sparsely connected (mean degree 2) and small host population sizes (N 500) our predictions on the Hagelloch outbreak provide evidence in this direction. we have a poor understanding of whether or not certain contact structures characterize certain classes of diseases. the strong support towards high contact heterogeneity points to transmission of gastrointestinal pathogens. study is a first step towards a larger goal. a statistical approach powered by existing data could greatly contribute to the characterization of host contact structure."}
