{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Betacoro navirus. a total of 2,260 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported. a total of 2,260 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported, including 803 deaths. the question of which form is preferable for a vaccine remains open. we constructed five recombinant vectors based on human adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) expressing different forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein. the full-length S glycoprotein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. the HEK293 and A549 cell lines were obtained from the Russian collection of vertebrate cell lines (Russia) all cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the titer of the pseudotyped virus was determined in terms of focus-forming units (FFUs) western blotting HEK293 cells were seeded in 35 mm Petri dishes and incubated overnight to 70% confluence. rAd5-null was used as a control virus. serum samples were titrated with serial dilutions in PBST containing 5% fat-free milk. anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies used for detection. the pseudovirion neutralization titer of serum samples from an immunized animal was determined as the maximum dilution where 50% reduction of EGFP fluorescent cell focuses compared with the serum samples of intact (non-immunized) animals. spleens were homogenized by passage through a 100 m sieve in sterile PBS. cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 105 cells/well) in a complete RPMI1640 medium re-stimulated with the recombinant MERS-CoV S protein (40071-V08B1; Sino Biological) at 1 g/well. after 3 days, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, stained with antibodies specific to CD3, CD4 and CD8: allophycocyanin (APC)-labelled anti-CD concentration of IFN- in the supernatants was measured by ELISA using a commercial kit (mouse IFN- ELISA kit; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, the increase in IFN- concentration was determined using the formula X = Cst /Cint. X is the fold increase in IFN- concentration, Cst is the IFN- concentration in the medium from the stimulated cells. the molecular weights of the bands were higher than those calculated according to the nucleotide sequences. a single polypeptide specifically recognized by the antibody was detected in the RBD (RBD, RBD-G and RBD-Fc) samples. rAd5 expressing different MERS-CoV S glycoprotein variants induce a humoral immune response Mice were intramuscularly immunized with single doses of rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G, rAd5-RBD, rAd5-RBD-G, and rAd5-RBD-Fc. no glycoprotein-specific IgG was detected in the serum samples from mice in the control groups rAd5-RBD and rAd5-RBD-Fc were the constructs with the highest immunogenicity. rAd5-RBD-Fc had the lowest immunogenicity. no significant differences in IgG titers were detected between rAd5-RBD and rAd5- RBD-G. rAd5-S, rAd5-S, rAd5-S, and IgG2b isotypes in immunized animals, titers were as follows for each group. titers were significantly lower than those in the other groups. rAd5 expressing membrane forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein elicit the production of neutralizing antibodies in mice. rAd5-S, rAd5- S-G, and rAd5-RBD-G generated neutralizing antibodies. rAd5 expressing the MERS-CoV S protein variants elicit the T-cell response. the full-length MERS-CoV S protein was used for re-stimulation. it contains the largest number of epitopes and is present in MERS-CoV particles. groups of animals immunized with rAd5-S and rAd5-S-G increased IFN- secretion. figures show levels of proliferating cells re-stimulated by the MERS-CoV S protein on day 8 post-vaccination. the key in vaccine development is antigen selection. most of the developed vaccines against MERS are based on the application of different forms of the MERS-CoV glycoprotein (the full-length S, the S1 subunit, and RBD) some authors have expressed concern about the use of full-length MERS-CoV S in the vaccine. the lack of 100% protection seems to be related to the need to develop a cellular immune response, as well as the need to block fusion of the viral and cell membranes. application of subunit-based vaccines, as well as inactivated ones, prevents the emergence of a balanced Th1/Th2 response. the full-length MERS-CoV glycoprotein (rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G, and rAd5-RBD-G) stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies. the most powerful humoral immune response was observed in animals immunized with the membrane-bound form of the RBD (rAd5-RBD-G);."}
