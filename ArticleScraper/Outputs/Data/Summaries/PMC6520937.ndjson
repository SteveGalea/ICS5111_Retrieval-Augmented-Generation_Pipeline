{"summary": "thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne virus in the genus Banyangvirus. it causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, an acute febrile illness characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic complications in infected humans. patients with SFTS may also develop other clinical manifestations such as systemic upset, coma, slurred speech, gastrointestinal upset, hepat favipiravir (T-705), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, demonstrated higher in vitro and in vivo antiviral effects against SFTSV. however, favipiravir is not clinically approved or readily available in many countries affected by SFTSV. all experiments involving live SFTSV followed the approved standard operating procedures of the biosafety level 3 facility. the FDA-approved drug library (Cat# HY-L022) and all the tested drug compounds were purchased from MedChem Express unless otherwise specified. ELISA ELISA was performed to determine the amount of viral nucleoprotein (NP) expression in the culture supernatant as previously described with modifications. each well was determined on day 1, 3, and 5 dpi by the cellTiterGlo luminescent assay. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with previously established primers (forward 5\u2032-GGGTCCCTGAAGGAGTTGTAAA-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032- TGCCTTCACCAAGACTATCAATGT -3\u2032) and probe targeting the S segment of the SFTSV genome was then performed using the Roche LightCycler Real-time PCR system. syncytium formation of vero cells was determined under low-pH exposure. at 24 hpi, the cells were rinsed once with PBS and then incubated with citrate-phosphate buffer. the citrate-phosphate buffer was replaced with 10% FBS\u2013DMEM. s, and drug Compounds SFTSV HB29 strain propagated in vero cells and kept at 80\u00b0C in aliquots. all experiments involving live SFTSV followed the approved standard operating procedures of the biosafety level 3 facility. ELISA ELISA was performed to determine the amount of viral nucleoprotein (NP) expression in the culture supernatant as previously described with modifications. the cytopathic effect inhibition assay was also performed as previously described with slight modifications. the 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Invitrogen), and the stop solution (0.1M HCl) the optical density of each well was read at 450 nm (OD450) using VICTOR 3 multi-label plate reader (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) cell monolayers stained with 0.7% crystal violet (BDH, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) the percentage of plaque inhibition relative to the control wells was determined for each drug concentration. syncytium formation of virus-infected cells was determined under low-pH exposure as previously described. favipiravir was used as a positive control in all three assays. the culture supernatants were subjected to ELISA and qRT-PCR analyses. favipiravir was used as a positive control. in the viral load reduction assay, there was approximately 4-log10 difference in SFTSV RNA load between the two groups at the 3 dpi and 5 dpi. both the ELISA and the viral load reduction assay were sensitive drug screening assays for SFTSV. drug compound library screening was then performed using ELISA. ELISA was used for primary screening, followed by viral reduction assay. top 80 primary hits with >50% reduction of absorbance signal in ELISA were subjected to viral load reduction assay. five drug compounds, namely hexachlorophene, triclosan, regorafenib, eltrombopag, and broxyquinoline, were identified as anti-SFTSV drug compounds. hexachlorophene reduced the viral RNA load by 2-log10 at 10 hpi. at 10 hpi, hexachlorophene achieved 100% plaque reduction at 10 hpi. hexachlorophene was co-mixed with hexachlorophene (5 MOI) and incubated with vero cells for 2 h. hexachlorophene is around 2.6 0.14 M as determined by plaque reduction assay. inhibitory activity was observed when hexachlorophene was added to vero cells pretreated with the drug compound (4 to 0 hpi) hexachlorophene interferes with SFTSV entry without inhibiting viral attachment to host cells or inactivating virions. fusion of a virus-infected cell leads to the formation of multi-nucleate enlarged cells and syncytia [19,26] only viruses that are fusogenic directly at the host cell membrane can induce syncytium formation. hexachlorophene interfered with SFTSV entry without inhibiting viral attachment to host cells. hexachlorophene is predicted to Occupy the SFTSV Gc Hydrophobic Pocket Viral envelope proteins are known to fuse with plasma or endosomal membranes to allow the release of the viral genome. hexachlorophene was predicted to bind with the deep hydrophobic pocket between domain I and domain III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein. top-ranked docking pose predicting binding between hexachlorophene and the deep hydrophobic pocket of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein. 2D and 3D intermolecular interaction showing hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions between hexachlorophene and Gc protein. in the viral load reduction assay, there was approximately 4-log10 difference in SFTSV RNA load between the two groups at the 3 dpi and 5 dpi. both the ELISA and the viral load reduction assay were sensitive drug screening assays for SFTSV. drug compound library screening was then performed using ELISA. ELISA was used for primary screening, followed by viral reduction assay. top 80 primary hits with >50% reduction of absorbance signal in ELISA were subjected to viral load reduction assay. five drug compounds, namely hexachlorophene, triclosan, regorafenib, eltrombopag, and broxyquinoline, were identified as anti-SFTSV drug compounds. hexachlorophene reduced the viral RNA load by 2-log10 at 10 hpi. at 10 hpi, hexachlorophene achieved 100% plaque reduction at 10 hpi. hexachlorophene was co-mixed with hexachlorophene (5 MOI) and incubated with vero cells for 2 h. hexachlorophene is around 2.6 0.14 M as determined by plaque reduction assay. inhibitory activity was observed when hexachlorophene was added to vero cells pretreated with the drug compound (4 to 0 hpi) hexachlorophene interferes with SFTSV entry without inhibiting viral attachment to host cells or inactivating virions. fusion of a virus-infected cell leads to the formation of multi-nucleate enlarged cells and syncytia [19,26] only viruses that are fusogenic directly at the host cell membrane can induce syncytium formation. hexachlorophene interfered with SFTSV entry without inhibiting viral attachment to host cells. hexachlorophene is predicted to Occupy the SFTSV Gc Hydrophobic Pocket Viral envelope proteins are known to fuse with plasma or endosomal membranes to allow the release of the viral genome. hexachlorophene was predicted to bind with the deep hydrophobic pocket between domain I and domain III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein. top-ranked docking pose predicting the binding between hexachlorophene and the deep hydrophobic pocket of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein. the sFTSV Gc glycoprotein domains I, II, and III are highlighted in red, yellow, and blue, respectively. advanced solid organ tumors (regorafenib), small molecule agonist of the c-mpl receptor for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and aplastic anemia (eltrombopag), and antiprotozoal agent (broxyquinoline) among these five drugs, hexachlorophene demonstrated the highest antiviral potency in vitro. hexachlorophene is an organochlorine compound that the IC50 of hexachlorophene against SFTSV (1.3\u20132.6 M) was lower than the other anti-SFTSV drug compounds reported thus far. hexachlorophene interfered with virus entry and virus-induced cell fusion without affecting virus attachment to host cells or inactivating the virions. the use of hexachlorophene as a disinfectant should be considered to reduce the risk of nosocomial outbreaks of contaminated environmental surfaces."}
