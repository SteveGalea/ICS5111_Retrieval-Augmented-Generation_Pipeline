{"summary": "inTRODUCTION GRACE is a network of excellence focusing on the complex and controversial field of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. the promiscuous use of antibiotics for the treatment of CA-LRTI accounts for a major part of the community burden of antibiotic use. the aim of GRACE is to combat antimicrobial resistance by integrating centers of research excellence and exploiting genomics in the investigation of CA-LRTI. the EQA panel consisted of 48 samples that had been included in previous quality control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) panels. the 21 samples in respiratory virus subpanel 1 contained a virus transport medium spiked with the following viruses in various concentrations. three samples were negative for all viruses. following EQA subpanel 3 samples were prepared in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid: GRACE-37, GRACE-38, GRACE-39, GRACE-40, GRACE-44, GRACE-45, and GRACE-47. sample contenta Concn/dilution CT Resultb by: Reference lab (real-time PCR) HCOV, EV INF A Negative GRACE-06 INF B 1.0 106 38.9 36.43 39.3 Negative Negative Negative INF B INF B INF B GRACE-21 RSV A 1.0 103 24 24.24 27.75 29.5 29.8 RSV, HADV RSV A, HADV RSV A, HADV GRACE-19 RSV A 1.0 105 30 32.26 30.07 40.7 35.3 HRV HC new tab a hMPV, human metapneumovirus; INF, influenza virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; PIV, parainfluenza virus; NTM, negative transport medium. sample contenta Concn/dilution CT Resultb by: Reference lab (real-time PCR) HADV, 44.6 31.3 HRV HRV HRV HRV 90 1.0 106 37\u201338 Negative Negative Negative Negative Negative Negative GRACE-27 HADV 3 5.0 102 34.06 31.34 35.4 33.5 Negative HADV HADV GRACE-29 HADV 4 2.5 102 31.04 31.75 37.1 35.8 HADV HADV HADV GRACE-24 HADV 31 1.0 102 38.89 41.2 pneumoniae M. pneumoniae GRACE-37 L. pneumophila 1,800 CFU 33.25; M. pneumoniae, 32.7 41.2; M. pneumoniae, 34.5 33.61; M. pneumoniae, 32.85 Negative Negative L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, 35.18 Negative L. pneumophila Negative GRACE-47 L. pneumophila. all BAL fluid pools spiked with a respiratory virus or with M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, or L. pneumophila were tested in triplicate by mono-PCRs for the presence of that specific organism. only samples from EQA subpanel 3 were analyzed. results were reported back to QCMD. 100 l of a clinical specimen was mixed with lysis buffer and proteinase K. the nucleic acid was then eluted in 200 l of elution buffer. the freeze-dried samples were resuspended in 1 ml of NA-free water. primers and probes were chosen for INF A and B, as well as for PIV-1 to -3. the forward and reverse primers and probes were given in Tables 1 through 3.

GRACE-19 was spiked with RSV-A but was found to be positive for HRV by the ResPlex 1 assay. GRACE-12 contained INF A but was reported to be positive for HCOV and enterovirus by the same assay. no difference in sensitivity was observed between the RespiFinder plus and the RespiFinder Smart 21 assay in examination of subpanel 2 for HADV, HCOV, and HRV. both assays failed to detect HADV 31, HRV 16, and HRV 90 in samples GRACE-24, GRACE-25, and GRACE-33. results of in-house PCRs for the detection of respiratory viruses were comparable. laboratory 1 obtained one false-positive result (sample GRACE-02; PIV-2/4) and three false-negative results. results of in-house PCRs for the detection of atypical pathogens. none of the negative-control samples were found positive by the three GRACE laboratories. laboratory 1 and 3 also detected M. pneumoniae in two samples. correct results were reported for 9/21, 11/21, 17/21, and 15/21 samples.
