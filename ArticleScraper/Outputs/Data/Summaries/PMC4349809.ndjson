{"summary": "influenza is a highly contagious, respiratory disease that causes high morbidity and mortality worldwide. the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused a moderate death toll compared to previous pandemic events. the threat of an emerging pandemic virus remains high with human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza continuing to occur. this type of activity scoring method is generally known as the \u2018manual\u2019 scoring method. it has been more commonly used in ferret studies involving HPAI viruses such as H5N1 [8, 17\u201319], characterised by severe disease pathogenesis and extreme changes in ferret activity. there are many limitations to this method of manually scoring ferret activity including potential bias when comparing the effect of a treatment. ferrets Adult male and female ferrets weighing 700\u20131300 g were used. serum samples from ferrets were tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay against the reference strains A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1)pdm09, A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2), B/Wisconsin/1/2010. of 10 mg/mL in a sterile 0.5% (v/v) sugar/phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) solution and 5 mg/kg was delivered orally to conscious ferrets twice daily. all oseltamivir treatment was carried out for a total of 5 days. infected cells were incubated for 4 days at 35\u00b0C, 5% CO2 followed by detection of virus by addition of 25 L of 1% Turkey red blood cells (RBCs) to 25 L of infected cell supernatant. influenza-specific antibodies in sera were assessed by HI assay. manual activity scoring of individually housed ferrets was carried out at least 3 hours after filming to minimise unnecessary disturbance to the ferrets. manual activity scoring was carried out at least 3 hours after filming to minimise unnecessary disturbance to the ferrets. the interior of the 400 litre box was painted grey matt (colour code 3102; PlastiKote, USA) to enable a good contrast between the white and dark-coloured ferrets used in the experiments. between the filming of each ferret, the box was decontaminated with 80% (v/v) ethanol to remove residual smell and/or viral contamination from the previous ferret. activity level of ferrets was determined by the software as a function of pixel changes, where ferret movement results in pixel changes as represented by the purple colour pixels in S1 Video. the maximum sampling rate was found to be the most sensitive. size between 159 and 14436 for optimal animal detection (Table 1; S2 Video). settings for measuring activity, distance and velocity in software. ferrets were administered oseltamivir twice daily starting with the first dose 2 hours prior to infection. all oseltamivir treatment was carried out for a total of 5 days. infected ferrets were housed individually in high efficiency particulate air filtered cages with free access to food, water and enrichment equipment. a single room was used exclusively to house the ferret cages (n = 12) for this study to maintain minimal disturbance from the main animal holding facility. infected cells were incubated for 4 days at 35\u00b0C, 5% CO2 followed by detection of virus by addition of 25 L of 1% Turkey red blood cells (RBCs) to 25 L of infected cell supernatant (wells containing fully hemagglutinated RBCs were scored as positive for influenza virus) ferrets were \u2018encouraged\u2019 to play by tapping the cage window gently to gain their attention, followed by wiggling the technician\u2019s fingers as an encouragement to play. manual activity scoring of the ferrets was carried out at least 3 hours after filming to minimise unnecessary disturbance to the ferrets. the filming sequence of individual ferrets in all groups was randomly assigned. video files (AVI. format, filmed at 30 frames/second, 640 480 resolution) were uploaded into the program and analysed for activity, distance and velocity using program settings as described in Table 1. rate of 30 samples/second (as the maximum rate for video filmed at 30 frames/second) the gray scale of each pixel of the film image was compared from one sample to the next, and the proportion of pixel changes was calculated. the maximum sampling rate was found to be the most sensitive.

Mean versus baseline average: *P0.05, **P0.01, ***P0.001, ****P0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test. in comparison, the administration of oseltamivir 2 hours prior to infection and twice daily for 5 days, ameliorated the impact of influenza infection on activity level. ferrets that were not treated with oseltamivir showed a significant drop in activity. activity level remained relatively similar to the pre-infection baseline average. untreated and OST-treated ferrets were both intranasally-infected. oseltamivir-treated ferrets showed a similar levels of activity to baseline average for most days except on day 6 where there was a significant decrease in activity compared to baseline average. video-tracking methodology appeared to be more sensitive in detecting changes in ferret activity than the manual scoring method. seltamivir-treated ferrets lost weight from day 1 pi before starting to regain weight after day 6 pi. oseltamivir-treated ferrets had a steady increase in body weight from day 1 pi. oseltamivir-treated ferrets showed significant increases in body temperature from baseline temperature at day 2 pi. video-tracking analysis was sufficiently sensitive and reproducible to detect changes in ferret activity following A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. oseltamivir treatment was associated with improved clinical symptoms including reduction in inflammatory responses in the upper respiratory tract. manual scoring is also subjective as it depends on the discretion and experience of the observer to assign a score that best describes the ferret activity. the requirement to score the ferret while it is still in the cage may bias the results. oseltamivir-treated ferrets showed improved activity (mean score of 0) compared to untreated ferrets (mean score of 1). ferrets treated with oseltamivir still shed considerable amounts of virus at the same time as showing an improvement in activity level. the use of ferrets as an in vivo model of infection is not limited to influenza virus alone and includes other viruses of public health concern such as Hendra virus [27], Nipah virus [28] and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus [29]. this improved method for monitoring ferret activity has the potential to assist in measuring both the pathogenesis and the impact of therapeutic interventions such as vaccines and antiviral drugs. ally-infected with 105 TCID50 (500 L; 250 L per nostril) A(H1N1)pdm09. only OST-treated ferrets were given sugar solution. data shown are meanSEM of the same experiment in Fig. 2. video-tracking analysis of distance and velocity of non-infected ferret. red dot represent the centre point of the animal located automatically by the program."}
