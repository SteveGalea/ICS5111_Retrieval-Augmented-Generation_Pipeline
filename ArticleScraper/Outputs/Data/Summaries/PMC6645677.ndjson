{"summary": "MERS-CoV is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus (-CoV) in the family Coronaviridae. the virus causes respiratory diseases such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. this may lead to pneumonia and acute renal failure in immunocompromised patients and the elderly [1\u20137] recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine candidates have been developed and investigated. these candidates induced humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibody responses. a vaccination strategy focused on RBD alone has several issues that may not be optimal for generating neutralizing antibody responses. changes were performed once weekly until the end of the experiment. all mice were sacrificed by CO2 euthanasia. all animal studies were approved by IACUC. the culture medium was changed daily after the initiation of the ALI. we add antibiotics such as 1% penicillin and streptomycin into the all media. all experiments described here used cultured nasal epithelial cells at 14 days after the creation of the ALI. pShuttle-CMV plasmid was designed to include the start codon and the signal sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) upstream of the transgene sequence. recombinant adenoviruses (serotype 5) were generated by inserting foreign sequences via homologous recombination. mouse immunizations Female BALB/c mice aged 6\u20138 weeks were immunized with rAd vaccine or control virus via intranasal (IN), intramuscular (IM) and sublingual (SL) routes. for IN immunization, mice were lightly anesthetized via isoflurane (Ifran; Hana Pharm., Kyonggi-Do, Korea) inhalation. for SL immunization, mice were lightly anesthe olar lavage fluid was collected by washing the lung airways with 1 ml PBS. the supernatant was used to measure secretory IgA and neutralizing antibody titers. rNTD protein was prepared using a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) 96-well plates were coated with 200 ng/well of S1 (aa 1\u2013725; 40069-V08B1), S2 (aa 726\u20131296; 40070-V08B1) and RBD (aa 367\u2013606; 40071-V08B1) each antigen-coated well was blocked with PBS containing 1% non-fat milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. the full-length MERS-CoV spike protein-expressing envelope plasmid was constructed using pLenti6 Gateway Vector kits (Invitrogen) 293TN cells were co-transfected with packaging plasmids pLP1 and pLP2, the lentiviral transfer plasmid, and the envelope plasmid pCAGG/MERS-CoV Spike. cDNA was synthesized from 3 g of RNA with random hexamer primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. amplification reactions had a total volume of 12 l and contained 2 l of cDNA (reverse transcription mixture), oligonucleotide primers (final concentration of 800 nM), and TaqMan hybridization probe (200 nM) all reactions were performed in triplicate. all real-time PCR data were normalized to the level of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 1106 copies) the lungs were perfused with 5 ml PBS containing 10 U/ml heparin. the cells were stained with anti-CD8a [53\u20136.7], anti-CD4 [RM4-5] and anti-CD44 [IM7] (BioLegend) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the fixed cells were permeabilized with BD Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) for 15 min at RT and stained with anti-IFN- [XMG1.2] (BioLegend) for 40 min at RT. female BALB/c mice aged 6 weeks were purchased from Orient Bio Inc. (Seoul, Korea) all mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the experimental facility at Ewha Woman\u2019s University. NHNE cells (1105 cells/culture) were seeded in 0.25 ml of culture medium on transwell clear culture inserts (24.5-mm, with a 0.45-mm pore size; Costar Co., Cambridge, MA, USA) cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of basal epithelial growth medium and DMEM containing previously described supplements. the culture medium was changed daily after the initiation of the ALI. sequence for RBD (residues 367\u2013606) was amplified by PCR using the forward (5-GA GCTAGCTAGCGAGGCCAAGCCCTCTCTGGC-3) the coding sequence for NTD (residues 18\u2013353) was amplified by PCR using the reverse primers (5-GACTCGAGTTATCACTTGTCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATGCCCAG-3) which contain two stop codons and rAd/mock was generated by the same method using the empty pShuttle-CMV vector. the recombinant viruses were amplified on HEK293 cells and purified by double-cesium chloride (CsCl2) gradient ultracentrifugation. expression and secretion of NTD protein by rAd-infected HEK293 cells were verified via Western blot analysis. injection of 100 mg/kg body weight ketamine (Yuhan Co., Seoul, Korea) and 10 mg/kg body weight Rompun (Bayer, Seoul, Korea) mixture in PBS. 15 l vaccine was inoculated under their tongue. mice were sacrificed at 1, 2, and 19 weeks after undergoing last immunization. eluted target protein fractions pooled, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged with PBS. each antigen-coated well was blocked with PBS containing 1% non-fat milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. goat anti-mouse IgA was added as a secondary antibody and incubated for 1 h at RT. reaction was developed with 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) peroxidase substrate. gradually, reaction was stopped with 1 M H3PO4 and analyzed at 450 nm wavelength. cDNA was synthesized from 3 g of RNA with random hexamer primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. cDNA was synthesized from 3 g of RNA with random hexamer primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. the mRNA level was monitored using a quantitative PCR for the N2 gene of MERS-CoV. real-time PCR was performed using the PE Biosystems ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. all reactions were performed in triplicate. cytokine-producing cells were resuspended in Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Medium. cells were permeabilized with BD Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences) for 15 min at RT and stained with anti-IFN- [XMG1.2] (BioLegend) cells were stained with DAPI (BioLegend) for 15 min at RT before analysis on a flow cytometer. data on all the stained cells were acquired using BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) Western blot performed using MERS-CoV S1-specific antibody. ike, rAd/RBD, or rAd/NTD revealed two prominent bands at 200 kDa and 120 kDa for culture supernatant and lysate of rAd/Spike-infected cells. a shuttle vector carrying the full-length MERS-CoV Spike gene, RBD gene, and NTD gene was constructed. recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus rAd/Spike, rAd/RBD, and rAd/NTD were generated by homologous recombination with adenoviral genomic DNA. the expressions of Spike and RBD were confirmed via immunoblotting assay using MERS-CoV spike protein S1 (aa 1\u2013725) rabbit polyclonal antibody. female BALB/c mice (4 mice/group) were immunized twice at week 0 and 2 with 1107 PFUs of rAd/NTD, rAd/RBD, or rAd/Spike. control animals received 1107 PFUs of rAd/mock. the rAd/Spike group elicited the highest levels of S1-specific IgA response. the rAd/NTD group showed a higher titer than that shown by the rAd/RBD group. mice were sacrificed at 7 days after boost injection, which is the peak of CD8 T-cell responses. rAd/Spike-immune mice exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibody in both sera and BALFs. rAd/Spike-immune mice exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibody in both sera and BALFs, followed by mice in the rAd/NTD group. serially diluted sera and BALFs were evaluated for their neutralizing activity against MERS Spike pseudotyped virus in Huh 7.5 cells. the transduction percentage was calculated by measuring GFP expression in comparison with the expression in the control pseudovirus-infected cells. serum IgG responses were analyzed by ELISA using NTD, RBD, or S2 protein as coating antigens. both rAd/NTD and rAd/Spike groups exhibited significantly higher levels of NTD-specific serum IgG than the control group. ns, not significant; ***p0.001; **p0.01; *p0.05. sera were pre-incubated with 10 g of NTD, RBD, or S2 protein. neutralization activity of immune sera was significantly reduced by pre-incubation. significant Spike-specific IgG levels were detected regardless of the immunization route. notably, IN immunization induced the highest IgG antibody responses among the groups. mucosal immunization of rAd/Spike vaccine can induce systemic and mucosal neutralizing antibodies. IM immunization could only elicit systemic responses. groups of mice were immunized as indicated in Fig 5. mice were intravenously injected with anti-CD45-APC antibody. cells stained with anti-CD45 Ab were identified as circulating T cells in blood. cells protected from in vivo labeling were confined to lung parenchyma. at this time point, mice immunized via IN route had significantly higher frequencies. a majority of Kd/S291 tetramer-positive CD8 T cells in the airway and lung parenchyma in IN-immunized mice were CD69+ or CD69+CD103+. their frequencies were significantly higher than IM-immunized mice. rAd/Spike immunization elicits long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses. serum IgG and mucosal IgA titers gradually increased with each immunization and maintained until 30 weeks with no obvious decline. female Balb/c mice were immunized three times at 0, 3, and 11 weeks with 1107 PFU of rAd/spike via IN route. generation of recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines expressing the Spike gene of MERS-CoV We designed and generated three recombinant adenoviruses. the coding sequences of full-length Spike (1\u20131353), RBD (367\u2013606), and NTD (18\u2013353) were cloned into the shuttle vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. the RBD domain was detected as a single band with a molecular weight of 35\u201340 kDa in the lysate and culture supernatant of rAd/RBD-infected cells. the molecular weight of RBD increased slightly in the culture supernatant, which might be due to different patterns of glycosylation between the culture supernatant and the lysate. the expressions of Spike and RBD were confirmed via immunoblotting assay. rAd/NTD, rAd/RBD, or rAd/Spike elicits humoral and CD8 T cell immune responses. serum IgG antibody titers in BALFs were measured by ELISA. lung cells were harvested from mice and stained with Kd/S291 tetramer, anti-CD8 and anti-CD44 antibody. the frequency of Kd/S291 tetramer-positive and CD44-positive cells is indicated in the upper right quadrant. the frequency of IFN--producing CD8 T cells responding to other peptides seems to be undetectable or very low. rAd/NTD- or rAd/spike-immune mice exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibody in both sera and BALFs. rAd/RBD group exhibited no significant difference in neutralizing activity compared with the rAd/spike-induced antibody in an authentic MERS-CoV infection of human primary respiratory cells. pre-treatment of rAd/Spike-immune sera significantly inhibited MERS-CoV replication while rAd/Mock sera did not. targeted antibody of MERS-CoV spike protein was diluted to 1:10, 1:50, 1:250. the diluted antibodies were mixed with the virus solution at a ratio of 1:1. the same experiments were carried out using mock antibody and the result was compared with that of targeted antibody for MERS-CoV spike protein. rAd/Spike groups showed significantly higher levels of RBD-specific serum IgG than the negative control group. rAd/Spike groups showed significantly higher S2-specific serum IgG responses than the negative control group. competition with the S1 protein inhibited neutralizing activity by 60%. soluble S2 protein competitor did not have any effect on neutralization activity. rAd/Spike possesses the strongest immunogenicity for inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. control mice were immunized intranasally with 1108 PFU of rAd/mock. sera were collected 2 weeks after each vaccination for measuring antibody responses. systemic RBD-specific IgG titers in sera were measured using ELISA. neutralizing antibody titers in serially diluted sera were measured via MERS-CoV pseudovirus neutralization assay in Huh 7.5 cells. the data are presented as mean SEM values of four mice per group. ns, not significant; ***p0.001. the number of Kd/S291 tetramer-positive CD8 T cells in the airway, lung parenchyma, lung vasculature, and spleen between IN and IM immunization groups. the numbers of Kd/S291 tetramer-specific CD8 T cells in the airway, lung parenchyma, lung vasculature, and spleen 30 days after IN or IM immunization. rAd/Spike immunization is more efficient in establishing antigen-specific CD8 TRM cells in the airway and lung parenchyma than IM immunization. rAd/Spike immunization elicits long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses. mucosal RBD-specific IgG antibody titers in BALFs were measured 19 weeks after each immunization by ELISA. Neutralization antibodies in sera were measured via MERS-CoV pseudovirus neutralization assay at 15 and 30 weeks. the rAd/Spike vaccine expressing full-length Spike protein is the best candidate in terms of immunogenicity and neutralizing efficacy. it is not yet clear whether the S2 subunit also contributes for inducing neutralizing antibodies by rAd/Spike vaccination. toxic CD8 T cell responses are necessary for complete protection against MERS-CoV infection. rAd/Spike vaccine expressing the full-length Spike protein may be most potent among our vaccine candidates. rAd/Spike vaccine expressing the full-length Spike protein rather than the RBD or NTD alone might be most potent among our candidates. BALB/c mice (n = 4 per group) were vaccinated twice at week 0 and 2 with 1107 PFUs of rAd/NTD, rAd/RBD, or rAd/Spike via the IN route. control animals received 1107 PFUs of rAd/mock on day 7 after last vaccination. mice were immunized with 1108 PFUs of rAd/Spike via the IN or IM route. mice were injected intravascularly with anti-CD45 antibody. cells were gated for singlets (FSC-A/FSC-H), lymphocytes (FSC-A/SSC-A), and live cells (FSC-A/DAPI)."}
