{"summary": "HCV is a positive-stranded RNA virus that establishes a chronic infection in 85 % of infected individuals, leading to long-term liver disease such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. the 9.6 kb genome is translated into a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into 10 structural and non-structural proteins. autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, allowing degradation of contents. PI3K activity can be chemically inhibited by wortmannin or 3-methyladenine (3-MA), both of which will block autophagy. HCV has been shown to require either the induction of autophagy, or an involvement of proteins comprising the autophagy machinery, for the establishment of productive replication. however, the mechanisms by which HCV induces autophagy and interacts with the autophagy machinery remain poorly defined. se fusion protein (SGR-Feo-JFH-1) were treated with wortmannin. wortmannin-treated cells showed a progressive loss of LC3-II. the PI3K activity is required for HCV replication. in cells treated with DCV, LC3B-II and NS5A levels decreased concurrently. both DCV and wortmannin treatment resulted in a time-dependent decrease in luciferase activity that corresponded to the Western blot data. the decrease in SGR replication was not due to a cytotoxic effect of prolonged wortmannin treatment. the cells were mock transfected or transfected with control-, Vps34- or DFCP1-targeted siRNA. expression of both Vps34 (lane 3) and to a lesser extent DFCP1 (lane 4) could be effectively silenced. this silencing led to an inhibition of both luciferase activity and NS5A expression. parental Huh7 cells were transfected with control siRNA (lane 2) or siRNAs against Vps34 or DFCP1 (lanes 3 and 4) using RNAiMAX. at 72 h post-transfection, cells were lysed for luciferase assay or Western blot analysis with the antibodies indicated. luciferase activity measured at 4 h post-infection (p.i.) would give a measure of entry and initial translation of the incoming viral genome (prior to genome replication), whereas later measurements would assess effects on genome replication. chimeric virus expressed Renilla luciferase (J6/JFH-1-Rluc) values at 4 h p.i. (lanes 5 and 6) suggest that these compounds had effects on either entry or initial viral translation, in addition to direct inhibition of viral genome replication. this could be explained in case of CsA when the unfolded protein response could result in a global attenuation of protein translation. mCherry\u2013DFCP1 expression construct is recruited to localized concentrations of PI3P. it is involved in formation of omegasomes which provide a platform for formation of isolation membranes, the progenitors of autophagosomes. the observation that DFCP1 was required for HCV genome replication suggested replication complexes might associate with omegasomes at some stage during the virus life cycle. plasmids for EGFP\u2013DFCP1 and mCherry\u2013DFCP1 were transfected. cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO), thapsigargin (3 M) or wortmannin (1 M) for 3 h before being fixed and stained with an antibody to LC3 (green) and DAPI. NS5A puncta do not colocalize with DFCP1 during infection with HCV. NS5A puncta do not colocalize with DFCP1 in HCV-infected cells. cells were then transfected with mCherry\u2013DFCP1 expression construct. a transient colocalization of NS5A and DFCP1 can be observed by live cell imaging. the lack of NS5A\u2013DFCP1 colocalization was consistent with the hypothesis that the establishment of replication complexes might require DFCP1. but once replication complexes had formed there was no further requirement for DFCP1. a cluster of juxtaposed NS5A/DFCP1 puncta dissociate into distinct structures towards the end of the image series. these data are consistent with a rapid and transient association of replication complexes (here represented by NS5A) with DFCP1. at 24 h p.i. live cell imaging was performed and movies of infected cells captured. NS4B and NS5A were the most likely candidates. both have been shown to generate DMV or single-membrane vesicles. recent evidence has pointed to a role for NS4B in induction of autophagy. similar observations were made in Huh7 cells transfected with plasmids expressing either NS5A or NS4B\u2013GFP with mCherry\u2013DFCP1. NS4B and NS5A transiently associate with the autophagic machinery. once active HCV replication complexes are formed these associations are disrupted. the class III PI3K Vps34 is essential for the nucleation machinery of autophagy, producing PI3P which subsequently recruits DFCP1. PI3K activity is required for HCV replication. mannin-treated cells showed a progressive loss of LC3-II over time. this is in agreement with inhibition of Vps34 class III PI3K activity. both DCV and wortmannin treatment resulted in a time-dependent decrease in luciferase activity. expression of both Vps34 and DFCP1 could be effectively silenced. silencing led to inhibition of both luciferase activity and NS5A expression. both inhibitors effectively blocked HCV RNA replication as judged by reductions in luciferase. DFCP1 siRNA-mediated knockdown resulted in a decrease in LC3-II abundance (lane 4), confirming its role in autophagosome biogenesis. silencing of Vps34 or DFCP1 inhibits HCV SGR replication. siRNA-mediated silencing of either Vps34 or DFCP1 resulted in a similar decrease of LC3-II abundance in the SGR-Feo-Con1-harbouring cells. replication of genotype 1b is possibly more dependent on these proteins than is replication of JFH-1. DFCP1 expression might be regulated in response to induction of autophagy by HCV. at 4 h p.i., there was no significant decrease in luciferase values. treatment of cells with inhibitors of HCV genome replication, either CsA or DCV, resulted in significant reductions in Renilla luciferase values at 4 h p.i. virus replication was only robustly established in cells transfected with a control siRNA. at 48 h p.i., virus replication was only robustly established in cells transfected with a control siRNA. both Vps34 and DFCP1 are required for the establishment of HCV genome replication. mCherry\u2013DFCP1 and EGFP\u2013DFCP1 expression constructs were imaged by fluorescence microscopy. mCherry\u2013DFCP1 retained the subcellular localization of previously characterized EGFP\u2013DFCP1. mCherry\u2013DFCP1 was validated as a marker of early autophagosome formation. mCherry\u2013DFCP1 colocalized with mCherry\u2013DFCP1 in untreated cells. mCherry\u2013DFCP1 colocalized with LC3 following induction of autophagy. NS5A puncta do not stably colocalize with DFCP1 during infection with HCV. a transient colocalization of NS5A and DFCP1 can be observed by live cell imaging. a transient colocalization of NS5A and DFCP1 can be observed by live cell imaging. Fig. 6(a) shows an example of the progressive accumulation of both NS5A (green) and DFCP1 (red) into a distinct punctate structure (yellow), seen first at 120 s. this observation was reminiscent of the situation with LC3 and DFCP1 previously reported to be involved in the formation of omegasomes and autophagosomes. at 48 h post-transfection cells were infected with mCherry\u2013DFCP1 expression plasmid. at 24 h p.i., live cell imaging was performed and movies of infected cells captured. NS4B and NS5A were the most likely candidates. mCherry\u2013DFCP1 exhibited intense punctate staining over a background of a less bright reticular distribution. NS5A-NS3 colocalization in SGR-Feo-JFH1 cells showed a low but significant level of colocalization of NS5A and DFCP1. similar observations were made in Huh7 cells transfected with plasmids expressing either NS5A or NS4B\u2013GFP with mean manders\u2019 overlap coefficients were derived from >10 cells for each condition. data represent the mean sd. *P 0.05. **P 0.005. Discussion In this study we demonstrated that early events in the generation of autophagosomes play a key role in the biogenesis. the nsp6 protein of various coronaviruses (including the SARS coronavirus), or the nsp5-7 protein of the arterivirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSV), located to the ER where they recruited Vps34 and DFCP1. a number of other viruses have previously been reported to usurp the autophagic machinery in distinct ways to facilitate genome replication. the differences between HCV and DENV are intriguing, given their close phylogenetic relationship. further to this the membrane architecture of DENV replication complexes is distinct from that of HCV. we have previously shown that the five non-structural proteins encoded by the SGR are necessary. et al. (2011) showed that 3-MA treatment or siRNA silencing of Vps34 reduced levels of HCV-mediated LC3 lipidation. indirect support for a role of Vps34 comes from a report that HCV infection upregulated Beclin1 expression, which could favour the formation of a Vps34-Vps15-Beclin1-Atg14L complex. the timescale of this process as observed in this study is consistent with the timescale observed previously for the transient association of GFP\u2013DFCP1 and RFP\u2013LC3 during autophagosome formation. the difference in size between autophagosomes ( 1.5 m) and DMVs (100\u2013150 nm) is also consistent with the hypothesis that replication complexes derive from autophagosomes. mCherry\u2013DFCP1 construct was generated by excising the DFCP1 coding sequence from a GFP\u2013DFCP1 construct. mCherry\u2013DFCP1 construct was generated by excising the DFCP1 sequence from a GFP\u2013DFCP1 construct. 7.5 104 cells had previously been seeded 24 h before transfection. transfection medium was replaced by fresh DMEM as previously described. cells were incubated on ice for 30 min prior to centrifugation. s were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. equal amounts of protein (10 g) were resolved by 12 % or 15 % SDS-PAGE. proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) unbound antibody was removed with three 1 PBS washes. coverslips were drained of excess fluid and mounted on slides. cells were seeded onto 35 mm glass-bottom dishes 24 h before transfection. Huh7 cells stably harbouring subgenomic replicons were maintained in a humidified incubator at 500 g ml 1. medium removed from Huh7.5 cells previously transfected with appropriate in vitro transcribed virus RNA was clarified by centrifugation at 1200 g for 5 min. siRNA transfections For siRNA experiments, 7.5 104 cells had previously been seeded 24 h before transfection. cells were transfected with siRNA (75 pmol) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in Optimem for 24 h. proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked for 1 h in 1 TBS containing 5 % BSA or 10 % skimmed milk powder. proteins were probed with appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C followed by horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Western blots visualized using an in-house enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent. live cell microscopy Huh7 cells (5 104) were seeded onto 35 mm glass-bottom dishes 24 h prior to transfection with mCherry\u2013DFCP1 plasmid using PEI. eight hours post-transfection, medium was replaced by fresh DMEM. at 48 h post-transfection, transfected cells were infected with GFP virus."}
