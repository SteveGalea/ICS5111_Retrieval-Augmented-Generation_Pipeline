{"summary": "the process of membrane fusion is initiated by binding of a virus to an appropriate receptor on the surface of the host cell. it is catalyzed by a virus-encoded membrane fusion protein, or fusogen. fusion requires three conserved proteins at minimum. mechanism of viral fusion Viral fusogens mediate the merger of the viral lipid envelope and the cell membrane. these proteins are displayed on the viral surface and anchored into the envelope. a thermodynamically favorable conformational rearrangement, fusogens reside in a metastable prefusion state on the viral membrane. class II fusogens are found in flaviviruses, e.g., west Nile virus. they have three-domain, beta-sheet-rich structures containing internal fusion loops. the structures of both the prefusion and postfusion forms are known only for VSV G [14,15] fusion in all three groups is initiated almost exclusively by two common triggers. Binding to a cellular receptor triggers some members of class I, e.g., SARS spike protein [16,17], while exposure to low pH activates Influenza HA [18], all class II fusogens [10], and the class III fusogens gp64 and VSV G [14,19]. gB requires the assistance of the conserved heterodimeric gH/gL complex to effect fusion of a virion to its target membrane. this merger can occur at the endosomal or plasma membrane. in all eight herpesviruses, gB requires the assistance of the conserved gH/gL complex to effect fusion of a virion to its target membrane. gammaherpesvirus activates gB [36,37,38] in beta- and gammaherpesviruses. gB binds v5, v6 and v8 integrins on epithelial cells directly. gB does not orchestrate fusion on its own. gB mediated fusion is not triggered by low pH. limited pH-induced structural changes do occur in gB, but they do not trigger its global rearrangement. gB is a protein that by comparison to other class III fusogens. class I fusogens are found in flaviviruses, e.g., west Nile virus, and have three-domain, beta-sheet-rich structures containing internal fusion loops. they can be arranged as homodimers or heterodimers in prefusion form. class III fusogens possess elements from both class I and II. class III includes glycoprotein G from rhabdoviruses, gB from herpesviruses, and gp64 from baculoviruses of insects. postfusion structures of representative viral fusogens from each of the known classes are known only for VSV G. the triggering mechanisms of some viruses are more complex. binding to a receptor CD4 and a co-receptor CXCR4 or CCR5 in the case of HIV [23], binding to a receptor followed by low pH exposure for Avian Leukosis Virus [24], or cathepsin cleavage after cellular uptake followed by binding of NPC1. crystal structures of apo gD (PDB ID 2C36), gD/HVEM complex (PDB ID 1JMA), gH/gL (PDB ID 3M1C) and postfusion form of gB (PDB ID 2GUM) are shown. the order of subsequent steps has been proposed but not yet confirmed. entry of cytomegalovirus (CMV) into fibroblasts depends on the presence of the trimeric gH/gL/gO complex. entry into epithelial and endothelial cells requires a pentameric complex formed by gH/gL, UL128, UL130, and UL131. gB does not orchestrate fusion on its own and requires the conserved gH/gL plus additional non-conserved the gB ectodomain is composed of a large extraviral or ectodomain. gB is composed of a large extraviral or ectodomain, a single-span helical transmembrane anchor, and an intraviral or cytoplasmic domain. the gB ectodomain in its postfusion form revealed a trimeric spike in which each protomer is composed of 5 distinct domains. a similar overall architecture was observed in the subsequently determined crystal structures of gB ectodomain from EBV [51] and CMV [52,53]. the hairpin architecture of the gB ectodomain is common to the postfusion structures of viral fusogens from all classes. individual domains within gB, VSV G, and baculovirus gp64 share a strong resemblance and their spatial arrangements are similar. however, the sequences of these proteins lack any similarity and differ in length by nearly 400 amino acids. in marked contrast to HSV gB, conformational changes in VSV G and gp64 are pH-driven and reversible. similar antibody reactivity has been observed with the fusogen F of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) similar behavior has been observed with recombinant ectodomains of several other viral fusogens. gB has so far eluded capture through this approach. each protomer is composed of 5 distinct domains arranged into a hairpin shape. the structure is further reinforced by domain V, which extends from one end of the molecule to the other. a similar overall architecture was observed in the subsequently determined crystal structures of gB ectodomain from EBV [51] and CMV [52,53] the hairpin architecture of the gB ectodomain is common to the postfusion structures of viral fusogens from all classes. gB, VSV G, and baculovirus gp64 share a strong resemblance and their spatial arrangements are similar. however, the sequences of these proteins lack any similarity and differ in length by nearly 400 amino acids. experimental characterization of the prefusion form of gB has been hindered in part by a lack of antibodies specific to this conformation. all known neutralizing antibodies to HSV gB should theoretically bind only the prefusion form and prevent its refolding. similar antibody reactivity has been observed with the fusogen F of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) membrane proximal region (MPR), transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytoplasmic domain (CTD) are thought to play key roles in its regulation. these membrane interacting regions make up 20% of the protein, a noteworthy fraction in comparison to other fusogens. as few as nine N-terminal MPR residues (731 to 739) are sufficient to prevent liposome binding. two phenylalanines (F732 and F738) are essential for this blocking activity. a trio of leucines in the MPR assists with the formation of the fusion pore. insertions and deletions in this area are poorly expressed on the cell surface. but the fusogenicity of those that reach the membrane is very low. the gB TMD is more than a mere membrane anchor and plays an essential role in the later stages of fusion. the length of the gB TMD is similar to several other fusogens [87,88,89] and slightly exceeds the minimal 20 residues theoretically needed to span an average 30- lipid bilayer hydrophobic core [80,90] it is tempting to speculate that gB must traverse the membrane via nearly the shortest path, parallel to the membrane normal. glycine-induced helix kinks could accommodate large transmembrane domain rearrangements. the activity of many fusogens depends on the overall structural and biochemical properties of their TMDs. the impact of GxxxG-like motifs on the structure of helical domains is likely similar to, if less extreme than, the extensively studied canonical GxxxG motif [98] HIV-1 gp41 shows its three TMD helices forming a left-handed coiled-coil. misfolding observed upon the addition of a heterologous trimerization domain to the CTD N-terminus suggests that the TMD helices are separated as they exit the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. but in the absence of direct structural information on the TMD, it is impossible to assess whether GxxxG-like motifs cause these helices to cross or fusion, clinical isolates of gB CTD with truncations, point mutations, or insertions within the gB CTD form multinucleated cells termed syncytia. a 14-residue C-terminal truncation in EBV gB produced a hyperfusogenic protein that could mediate fusion at lower temperatures, more rapidly, and in response to weaker signals from gH/gL the role of the CTD as a clamp may be unique to herpesviruses. a HCMV \u201cgB-G\u201d construct in which the CTD, transmembrane and a portion of the membrane proximal region of gB were replaced with the VSV G transmembrane spans could drive membrane fusion. prefusion gB is a function that the CTD achieves by interacting with the viral envelope and, probably, with the TMD. this restraint is only effective if the integrity of the CTD is preserved and aberrant fusion occurs in response to slight perturbations of its structure or disruption of CTD-membrane contacts. common approaches to the study of membrane proteins inherently perturb these critical interactions. the fusion loops of class III fusogens are expected to be near the viral membrane in both pre- and postfusion structures [14,15] ectodomain-MPR constructs do not [70,71] as few as nine N-terminal MPR residues (731 to 739) are sufficient to prevent liposome binding, and two phenylalanines are essential for this blocking activity. mutants with insertions and deletions in this area are poorly expressed on the cell surface. however, the fusogenicity of those that reach the membrane is very low. the gB TMD is more than a mere membrane anchor and plays an essential role in the later stages of fusion. the length of the gB TMD is similar to several other fusogens [87,88,89] and slightly exceeds the minimal 20 residues theoretically needed to span an average 30- lipid bilayer hydrophobic core [80,90] it is tempting to speculate that gB must traverse the membrane via nearly the shortest path, parallel to the membrane normal. glycines destabilize helices by reducing side chain interactions. helix kinks could accommodate large transmembrane domain rearrangements. glycine-induced helix kinks could accommodate large transmembrane domain rearrangements. the cryoEM structure of HIV-1 gp41 shows its three TMD helices forming a left-handed coiled-coil with a 35\u00b0 crossing angle. in gB, misfolding observed upon the addition of a heterologous trimerization domain to the CTD N-terminus suggests that the TMD helices are separated as they exit the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. however, it is impossible to assess whether GxxxG-like motifs cause the gB CTD appears to negatively regulate fusion. truncations in gB gB act by disrupting membrane binding by the CTD. a 14-residue truncation in EBV gB produced a hyperfusogenic protein. fusion inhibition by the CTD may be unique to herpesviruses. a HCMV \u201cgB-G\u201d construct in which the CTD, transmembrane and a portion of the membrane proximal region of gB were replaced with the VSV G transmembrane spans could drive membrane fusion. fusion in herpesviruses requires a signal passed from the gH/gL heterodimer to gB. the most N-terminal gH domain is stabilized by folding around gL. the C-terminal domain extends into a single transmembrane pass and 14-amino-acid cytotail. gH/gL Ectodomain gH exhibits a spectrum of conservation along its sequence that appears integral to its communication with gB. the highly conserved central H2 and membrane adjacent H3 domains then translate these diverse inputs into a common message for transmission to gB. gH/gL has been proposed as an adaptor needed for it to function in many different systems. the ability of the gH cytotail to regulate fusion has been examined in several mutational studies. the effect has been attributed to the destruction of the serine-valine-proline (SVP) motif of residues 830\u2013832 [122] and fusion events mediated by both WT gB and A855V hyperfusogenic gB are further reduced. gH cytotail truncations do not alter the ectodomain conformation. this domain promotes fusion through a transient, steric mechanism. it may act as a wedge to split tightly associated protomers of the gB clamp. highly conserved central H2 and membrane adjacent H3 domains then translate these diverse inputs into a common message for transmission to gB. preliminary information on how and where their ectodomains might interact has been obtained through investigation of two strongly neutralizing gH/gL antibodies. the gH cytotail to regulate fusion has been examined in several mutational studies. the effect has been attributed to the destruction of the serine-valine-proline (SVP) motif of residues 830\u2013832 [122] and fusion events mediated by both WT gB and A855V hyperfusogenic gB are further reduced in the presence of gH SAP mutants. shortening of the gH cytotail increases fusion, indicating that gH restrains fusion instead of promoting it. syncytia are not seen in WT HSV-1 fusion, which is already tightly controlled by the built in safety-latch of gBcyto. gB activation in HSV-1 and HSV-2 requires the participation of the gH/gL heterodimer and the gD receptor binding protein. gB mediated fusion is restrained by its substantial CTD, which lacks an equivalent among the short cytotails of other class III fusogens."}
