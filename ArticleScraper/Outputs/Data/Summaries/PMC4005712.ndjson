{"summary": "in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in Southeast Asia and rapidly spread worldwide. recently, a novel beta-coronavirus, termed Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV, was discovered in the Arabian Peninsula. the fusion peptide unfolds and inserts into the target cell membrane forming the pre-hairpin intermediate. a final conformational step results in refolding of both HR1 and HR2 into a low energy postfusion state and allows the fusion pore to form. the fusion of SARS-CoV is complex but is thought to require both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage. the proteolytic cleavage event that separates the receptor binding and fusion domains into non-covalently associated fragments depends on the species of CoV. mutagenesis to investigate the role of electrostatic, polar, and hydrophobic residues on the SARS-CoV S2 extracellular fusion core. the fusion core is stable over a wide pH range and that specific hydrophobic residues at the HR1\u2013HR2 interface play a major role in stabilizing the postfusion conformation. each repeat consists of a seven-residue abcdefg motif. hydrophobic residues (leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and valine) are displayed in the a and d positions. the C-terminal segment of each protomer extends alongside the inner core in an antiparallel manner. the SARS-CoV S2 L2H is soluble and migrates as a stable trimer on size exclusion chromatography. the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the protein was characterized by double minima at 208 and 222 nm. the CD wavelength scans for all SARS-CoV S2 L2H mutants were similar.

MHV and hCoV-229E use carcinoembryonic antigen adhesion molecule 1 (CAECAM1) and aminopeptidase N (APN) as receptors. a 286-amino acid fragment within the S1 domain of MERS-CoV interact with the DPP4 receptor. hydrophobic residues at the C-terminal end of the HR2 region are more critical to the stability of the postfusion state than those at the tether region. the importance of these residues correlate well with the SARS-CoV HR2 peptide inhibition studies35,43,61,64\u201368. structural comparison between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV fusion cores revealed a high degree of structural similarity with an root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of approximately 0.9 for 204 C atoms. superimposition of a 42-residue HR1 region surrounding the HR2 binding site reveals an average RMSD of 0.4 between the SARS-CoV, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-NL63, MHV, and hCoV-NL63 fusion subunits. the surface of the substructure has a long groove (16- long 9- wide 7- deep) and a pocket (7- long 9- wide 7- deep) at the MHV (colored in purple), hCoV (colored in magenta) and hCoV-NL63 (colored in orange) HR1 substructures are shown for each virus. a hydrophobic pocket was identified, as shown by the green small molecules. the conserved core maintains the structural integrity of the viral glycoprotein. inhibitors designed against this site have the potential to block formation of the fusion core complex of many coronaviruses. gene sequence of SARS-CoV S2 strain BJ302 clone 1 was codon-optimized and gene synthesized for expression in E. coli. DNA corresponding to linked two-helix (L2H) SARS-CoV fusion core was cloned into pET-46 Ek/LIC (EMD Millipore) a single colony was inoculated into LB media supplemented with 100 g/mL ampicillin. about 20 mL of the overnight culture was then used to inoculate 1 L of LB media supplemented with 100 g/mL ampicillin. the temperature was lowered to 18\u00b0C and harvested 18 hours post-induction by centrifugation. the eluted SARS-CoV S2 L2H protein was then concentrated and further purified by size exclusion chromatography. protein concentration was quantified by absorbance at 280 nm, and protein purity was analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. 190 to 250 nm for wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV S2 L2H in 10 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS buffer at 20\u00b0C. five spectra were acquired and averaged, with the results reported as molar ellipticity []. pH 4.0\u20136.5, sodium acetate buffer (10 mM NaOAc, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS); pH 7.0\u20138.5, Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS) CD wavelength scans and thermal melts as a function of pH were performed. a single colony was inoculated into LB media supplemented with 100 g/mL ampicillin and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C. about 20 mL of the overnight culture was then used to inoculate 1 L of LB media supplemented with 100 g/mL ampicillin. the temperature was lowered to 18\u00b0C and harvested 18 hours post-induction by centrifugation at 3000g. the bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in 25 mL 1 Ni-NTA binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS. the experiments were carried out at 4\u00b0C using purified SARS-CoV S2 L2H fusion core in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.5. about 20 M protein sample was centrifuged at three different speeds (18,000, 20,000, and 22,000 rpm) heat alone was insufficient to denature the predominantly helical SARS-CoV S2 L2H fusion core. guanidine hydrochloride was added to all samples to facilitate unfolding within a temperature range of 20\u00b0C\u201399\u00b0C. values of midpoint unfolding transitions (Tm) were calculated from thermal melt curves. 5 spectra were acquired and averaged, with the results reported as molar ellipticity. the -helical content of wild-type SARS-CoV S2 L2H was calculated from the experimental CD wavelength scans using the SELCON3 algorithm in the program DichroWeb. pH 7.0\u20138.5, Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS) the pH may exhibit fluctuations within the buffering range during the CD thermal melt experiments."}
