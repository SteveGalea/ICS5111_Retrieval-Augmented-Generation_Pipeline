{"summary": "a critical group of host-cell proteases exploited by a variety of viruses is the family of proprotein convertases (PCs), which includes furin, PC4, PC5, PACE4, and PC7 [1,2]. a critical group of host-cell proteases exploited by a variety of viruses is the family of proprotein convertases (PCs) proteolytic processing by PCs promotes binding and fusion of viral particles to target cells. PCs are eukaryotic serine proteases classified in the MEROPS Peptidase Database within the S8B family. Kexin-like PCs are large-size multidomain proteins composed of conserved catalytic and regulatory P domains. furin, PC5, and PC7 are type I membrane-bound proteins. furin and PC5 can be shed extracellularly; in contrast, PACE4 is a secreted protein. serpins are slow-binding type inhibitors that form covalently-linked inhibitory complexes with their target proteases. serpin B8, currently the only PC inhibitory serpin identified in vertebrates, has higher specificity for furin than for PC4/PC5/PACE4/PC7 [9,15,16]. papillomavirus (HPV) infects the basal cells of stratified epithelium. virion replication depends on the infected basal cells progressing into differentiated squamous cells. cleavage of native HPV16 virions occurs during virion morphogenesis. the L2-Arg305 site is located in a region of L2 involved in regulation of retrograde trafficking of the L2-viral genome complex from the trans-Golgi network. low-risk HPV types have Lys at the L1-74 position instead of the Arg of high-risk types. cleavage sites may be hidden inside the folded protein and protected from being accessed by the PCs. the envelope glycoprotein B (gB) is the most conserved protein among all herpes viruses. gB is synthesized as a precursor protein, and PCs cleave it at a loop. the cleavage site loop is highly variable in length and amino acid sequence among herpes viruses. flaviviruses Two proteins predominate in the envelope of flaviviruses, prM, and glycoprotein E. a peculiar case is the maturation of the dengue virus (DENV) the four DENV types have Asp or Glu residues at the P3 position of the cleavage site. it is expected that DENV reacts with a dramatically lower reactivity toward the PCs compared to other flaviviruses. a vigorous reactivity of ZIKV with PC4 would explain why the testes suffer the highest loads of ZIKV compared to other organs and the sexual transmission of the virus. coronaviruses The family of coronaviruses includes viruses of relevance to human and veterinary health. the proteolytic regulation of coronaviruses is probably one of the best-studied systems, and a complete picture of the regulatory system mechanism has been developed. the cleavage at S1\u2013S2 primes S for the second cleavage at the S2\u2032 site. the cleavage at S2\u2032 has been suggested to serve as a virulence marker. but the dependency of furin/PC reactivity on the conformation of the substrate and exosites lends uncertainty to those predictions. coronaviruses are adapted to the different proteolytic environments of the many cell types they infect. each virus may be activated by a specific set of proteases. it is crucial to define the protease cleavage specificity of viruses that impact human or animal health. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Env glycoprotein gp160 precursor is cleaved by furin during biosynthesis into gp120 and gp41 in the trans-Golgi network. furin cleavage-independent forms stabilized in the native form have been produced for vaccine development purposes. single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses of the Filoviridae and Arenaviridae families and the new-order Bunyavirales are the causative agents of lethal hemorrhagic fever diseases. the information about the proteolytic regulation of their entry mechanism is scarce. the cleavage by furin seems to be dispensable because the elimination of the PC site in the EBOV protein does not affect the virus replication in cultured cells or the disease progression in paramyxoviridae is a diverse family of viruses, and a variety of proteases activate their fusion proteins. one proteolytic processing of the fusion protein occurs for most of these viruses. avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) are highly pathogenic. the virus envelope contains two glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) both proteins contribute to the virus pathogenicity and the cleavage of HA0 precursor into HA1 and HA2 by the host cell PCs is a significant contributor of virulence for avian influenza. two proteases highly expressed in the respiratory tract, especially in the lungs, were shown to cleave the 1918 influenza HA [107] each HA monomer is divided into HA1 (red, blue, and gray) and HA2 (oarange, cyan, and white, respectively) subunits. the long and multibasic loops in some H5 and H7 strains are highly reactive with furin. this reactivity leads to high pathogenicity that causes systemic infections. cleavage is carried out by the ubiquitous protease MSPL and its splice variant MTPRSS13. larger proteins are poised to become the most effective PC inhibitors. they offer better opportunities to build specificity and selectivity compared to small molecules. they can also be made bioavailable through a variety of routes. the main drawback is the ubiquitous distribution of PCs. it is essential to know the virus PC selectivity and to have PC inhibitors that are selective for one of the two PC specificity groups."}
