{"summary": "a highly conserved feature of (+)RNA viruses is that they modify the host endomembrane system to assemble viral replication complexes. different viruses assemble their VRCs in different organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, peroxisomes, chloroplasts, and tonoplasts (4\u20136) cytopathological alterations arising from viral infection have been ascribed to the expression of virus-encoded proteins. BBSV is a member of the genus Necrovirus in the family Tombusviridae. p23 is an auxiliary replication protein, while p82 is the translational readthrough product of p23. p7a, p7b, and p5\u2032 are essential for cell-to-cell movement of BBSV in infected plants. the spherules are invaginations of the ER membranes, with an 6-nm-wide neck connecting the interior of the viral spherule to the cytoplasm. bbcL was cloned from the cDNA of Nicotiana benthamiana and constructed into the BiFC vectors as described above. wild-type N. benthamiana or line 16C was mechanically inoculated with BBSV. the plants were then incubated at 18\u00b0C under 16 h light. approximately 0.5 g leaf tissue was chopped, transferred to 15 ml enzyme solution (1.25% cellulase Onozuka R-10 [Yakult Honsha, Tokyo, Japan], 0.3% macerozyme R-10 [Yakult Honsha], 8.2% d-mannitol, 20 mM morpholineethanesulfonic acid [MES], 20 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 0.1% BSA, 0.3% dextran, 13% [wt/vol] sucrose, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma] was centrifuged at 3,700 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min to obtain the soluble (S30 leaf tissue fragments (about 1 to 2 mm2) from N. benthamiana were excised in a drop of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and vacuum infiltrated in the same fixative for about 15 min. samples were then fixed at 4\u00b0C for at least 1 day before postfixation in 2% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. sections were placed on drops of 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 0.02 M glycine for 10 min to quench residual aldehyde groups. sections were placed on a drop of blocking solution consisting of 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.2), 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% Tween 20 and 1% BSA for 10 min. bioTwin LaB6 transmission electron microscope (FEI) operated at 120 kV. images were acquired as a single-axis tilt series across a range of 70\u00b0 to +70\u00b0 in 2\u00b0 angular increments. electron microscope magnification was 30,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.74 nm. assays, p23 and p82 were amplified from the pUBF52 and pUBF52G647C plasmids, respectively; digested; and then ligated into similarly digested pSPYNE-35S and pSPYCE-35S vectors. bbcL was cloned from the cDNA of Nicotiana benthamiana and constructed into the BiFC vectors as described above. mCherry, mCherry, and chlorophyll autofluorescence were excited using 488-, 543-, 543-, and 633-nm laser lines. image acquisition was conducted at a resolution of 1,024 by 1,024 pixels and a scan rate of 12.5 s/pixel. images were taken with excitation at 514 nm (yellow fluorescent protein [YFP]) and 543 nm (mCherry) via CLSM. 1 g N. benthamiana leaf tissue showing characteristic symptoms of BBSV infection or agroinfiltrated with binary vectors was gently ground in 1.5 ml of homogenization buffer. mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma] were then overlaid with 7 ml of 65% and 3.1 ml of 10% sucrose in NTE buffer. the samples were then fixed at 4\u00b0C for at least 1 day before postfixation in 2% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) for 2 h at 4\u00b0 ultrathin sections prepared from these blocks were placed on Formvar-coated 150-mesh nickel grids. grids were rinsed three times on successive drops of double-distilled H2O (pH 7.2) and placed on drops of 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) for 10 min to quench residual aldehyde groups. sections were stained for 20 min with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate. electron microscope magnification was 30,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 0.74 nm at the specimen level. reshapes ER structure and generates membrane-associated spherules. agroinfiltrated mCherry-fused -TIP into N. benthamiana leaves. no apparent morphological abnormalities were observed in tonoplasts by CLSM. in contrast, in BBSV-infected plant epidermal cells of line 16C plants expressing an ER-localized GFP (37), the ER was rearranged, with formation of punctate structures. cells were inoculated with BBSV virions (BBSV/Ino) at 3 dpi, leaf epidermis was peeled from these leaves. the remainder was treated with enzymes to liberate protoplasts from the mesophyll. systemically infected leaves (BBSV/Sys) were harvested at about 8 dpi. the membrane-associated spherules were bound by a single lipid bilayer. the spherule membrane appeared to be continuous with the outer ER membrane, forming an invagination connected by a neck. BBSV infection induced vesiculation of the ER membrane, resulting in the formation of ER-derived spherules. different numbers of spherules were enclosed in the VPs. some spherules appear to be suspended in the cytoplasm (arrowheads) the enlarged image shows the region pointed to by the arrowhead. gold particles representing position of p23 could specifically colocalize with the ER. gold particles were present around the outside of vesicle-like structures. membranes were not well preserved due to the omission of OsO4 fixation. p23 is localized to the aggregated ER or in close proximity to the spherules. p23 is localized to the aggregated ER or in close proximity to the spherules. arrowheads point to spherule-associated 10-nm gold particles. the results showed that p23-p82 complexes colocalize well with the ER aggregates. for the control, no fluorescence was detected, despite efficient expression of corresponding proteins in the agroinfiltrated leaves. previous studies showed that certain viral proteins were responsible for the formation of corresponding cytopathological structures. p23 was fused to the C terminus of GFP to generate GFP-p23. p23 failed to induce ER aggregation and punctate structures. punctate structures colocalizing with the ER and the perinuclear membrane were readily detected. p23 cofractionates with the ER marker BiP. a membrane flotation assay was performed to separate membrane fractions from soluble fractions. a membrane flotation assay was performed to separate membrane fractions from soluble fractions. p23-RFP was fused with GFP or from BBSV-infected leaves. expression of p23 alone leads to ER aggregation in epidermal cells. expression of p23 alone in the N. benthamiana cells leads to ER aggregation. cytoplasm, and the peripheries of these areas were linked with the ER. expression of p23 alone alters the membrane structure of the ER in ways that resemble that in BBSV infection. no changes in the ER structure were observed throughout the experiment. 270 spherules from five independent electron tomographic experiments were examined. 87% of them were continuous with the outer ER membrane in successive slices of the tomograms. spherules were also connected to each other through a tubule-like structure. arrowheads indicate two spherules that appear to be free vesicles in one slice but connect to the outer membrane in the other slice. arrowheads indicate two spherules that appear to be free vesicles in one slice but connect to the outer membrane in the other slice. panel G shows the electron density map from which the 3D surface-rendered models in panels G1 to G3 were derived. BBSV infection reshapes the ER structure and generates membrane-associated spherules. previous studies indicated that viruses from the genus Necrovirus in the family Tombusviridae often cause cytopathic effects on the tonoplast (33) or ER (34, 35) BBSV infection induced severe morphological changes in the endoplasmic reticulum. both leaf epidermis (A) and mesophyll (B) cells were analyzed by CLSM. both leaf epidermis (A) and mesophyll (B) cells were inoculated. vesicles, along with the dilated ER, were frequently present. these cytopathological features induced by BBSV infection were absent in healthy cells. however, some vesicles appeared to be free in the cytoplasm. ion and viral particles intermingled within the convoluted ER membrane. BBSV-induced vesiculation of the ER and VPs were often present in branched ER cisternae. a virus crystal (Vi) was in proximity to the VPs. dsRNA is commonly considered a replication intermediate whose localization is usually thought to be the place where viral replication occurs (39). leaf tissues were prefixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and a low concentration of glutaraldehyde (GA) followed by postfixation without OsO4 to preserve the antigenicity of target molecules. gold particles representing position of p23 could specifically colocalize with the ER. more than 80% of p23-targeted gold particles were associated with the ER. dsRNA detection showed more than 75% of them were associated with the VPs. arrowheads indicate areas of spherules labeled with 10-nm gold particles. distance between the gold particles and the target epitopes may span up to 20 nm. p23-p82 complexes colocalize well with the aggregated ER. pathological structures (8, 9) investigated which BBSV protein might play a key role in remodeling the ER structure. previous studies showed that there were no obvious changes in the ER membrane when viral movement proteins or coat protein was transiently expressed. p23 was fused with fluorescent proteins to generate GFP-p23. p23 protein is enriched in intracellular membranes and membrane-associated proteins. arrowheads point to fluorescent halo of perinuclear ER-mCherry. p30 precipitates derived from leaves agroinfiltrated with p23-GFP. a membrane flotation assay was performed to separate membrane fractions (P30) from soluble fractions. p23, either fused with GFP or from BBSV-infected leaves, could be detected only in the membrane fractions. expression of p23 (p23-RFP) alone gives rise to ER aggregation in the epidermal cells. leaf tissues transiently expressing p23 were subjected to TEM analysis. results showed that the ER was proliferated and convoluted. expression of p23 alone cannot form evident membrane-associated spherules. 270 spherules from five independent electron tomographic experiments were examined. 87% of the spherules were continuous with the outer ER membrane in successive slices of the tomograms. 3D surface rendering showed that all the spherules lined a rounded ER outer ER membrane. the spherules were connected to the ER outer membrane through neck-like structures. these connections likely allow the import of cytoplasmic constituents into the spherules and the export of newly synthesized viral RNAs to the cytoplasm. the mean diameter of the necked channel is 5.7 0.6 nm (n = 36) 3D models of the fibrillar contents within the spherules were reconstructed using electron tomography. the 3D architecture of BBSV-induced membranous compartments was reconstructed using electron tomography. the ER aggregates randomly disperse in the cytoplasm of the virus-infected cells (48, 49) BBSV induced a cytopathological structure distinct from those of other viruses in the same genus Necrovirus. BBSV elicits ER membrane dilations and invaginations. auxiliary replication protein p23 was detected in both regular and convoluted ER membrane or showed an association with the spherules similar to that of dsRNA. the expression of the auxiliary replication protein p23 contributes prominently to ER reorganization. bMV replication protein 1a is necessary and sufficient to induce perinuclear ER-bound spherules in yeast cells. expression of p23 alone induces ER proliferation and aggregation resembling that caused by BBSV infection. these structures could be, at least, an important intermediate step for subsequent bona fide spherule formation. the shared morphology of replication structures again suggested an evolutionarily conserved mechanism underlying the formation of VRCs across kingdoms (45, 46). unlike peroxisome- or mitochondrion-derived membrane vesicles, the number of BBSV-induced membranous spherules in the vesicle packets varied greatly, with quantities ranging from one to several hundreds. nous vesicles systemically investigated the biogenesis of the BBSV replication complex. we present the first 3D model of an ER-derived membranous replication factory in virus-infected leaf cells. BBSV remodels the ER membrane to form virus replication complexes. invaginations formed round outer membranes encompassing different numbers of vesicles in the cytoplasm. small vesicles were occasionally observed in the perinuclear region. auxiliary replication protein p23 was detected in both regular and convoluted ER membranes. membranous replication compartments of BBSV originate from the ER. expression of auxiliary replication protein p23 contributes prominently to ER reorganization during BBSV infection. many animal virus-encoded proteins have been identified (45) 3D structures of BBSV-induced membrane spherules have been characterized for multiple animal positive-strand RNA viruses within the Picornaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, and Coronaviridae. however, 3D structural information on plant (+)RNA virus-infected cells is limited, although the replication mechanisms and virus-host interactions have been extensively studied for some plant viruses. vesicle packets varied greatly, with quantities ranging from one to several hundreds. the ER could be used as a platform for different viruses to synthesize their RNA. however, the morphologies of the replication sites differ very much between the virus groups."}
