{"summary": "the frequency of memory B cells producing antibodies that stained HCMV-infected cells ranged from 1.56\u20133.89% of total IgG+ B cells. but only a minor fraction of HCMV-specific IgG antibodies bound to gB, gHgL dimer or the gHgLpUL128L pentamer. antibodies specific for gB, gHgL, and gHgLpUL128L were identified by ELISA using recombinant glycoproteins. a significant higher proportion of the antibodies to gHgL (59.0 18.6%; range, 40\u201383%) had HCMV-neutralizing activity. we immunized mice with soluble gB, gHgL dimer, or gHgLpUL128L pentamer. mice were immunized by s.c. injections of 5 g of proteins in 0.5% carbopol polymer. soluble gB induced serum antibodies that bound to gB. soluble gB, gHgL dimer, or gHgLpUL128L pentamer were immunized with 5 g of HEK293F-produced soluble gB, gHgL dimer, or gHgLpUL128L pentamer. serum antibody titers binding (1/ED50) to gB (A), dimer (B) and pentamer (C) measured by a large fraction (67%) of mAbs induced by immunization with the pentamer recognized epitopes present on the gHgL dimer and neutralized infection of both epithelial cells and fibroblasts. the remaining mAbs neutralized infection of epithelial cells but not fibroblasts, but were much more potent. a subset of the latter antibodies was mapped by staining cells transfected with various combinations of the pen m E 12.1 pUL128pUL130pUL131 \u2014 P40, m E 11.4 pUL128pUL130pUL131 \u2014 P38, m E 11.2 pUL128pUL130pUL131 \u2014 P53, m E 10.9 pUL128pUL130pUL131 \u2014 P42, m E 10.9 pUL128pUL130pUL131 \u2014 P42, m E 10.6 pUL mouse (m) and human (h) mAbs are grouped according to their ability to neutralize HCMV infection of epithelial cells only (E) or epithelial cells and fibroblasts (E+F) shown are the log IC80 values, corresponding to the concentration that inhibits 80% infection. a high-producer clone was selected after two rounds of subcloning. this clone produced, under laboratory scale, batch conditions in protein-free chemically defined medium up to 50 mg/L of pentamer. the pentamer was monodisperse with no signs of aggregation. antibody titers to gHgLpUL128L pentamer measured by ELISA. box and whiskers plot, box containing 50% with median and whiskers minimum to maximum values. antibody response elicited by immunization of mice with pentamer to that of humans infected with HCMV. mice immunized with 2.5 g of pentamer formulated with either of the three adjuvants were bled 5 mo after the last immunization. high binding and neutralizing antibody titers were still present after 5 mo without booster injection. sera from pentamer-immunized mice showed a high potency in both assays. the CHO-derived pentamer is able to elicit antibodies that block in vitro activities that well recapitulate the routes of HCMV dissemination in vivo. sera from pentamer-immunized mice block HCMV cell-to-cell spreading in epithelial cells. mouse sera (white circles) were collected on day 40 following immunization with 5 g of soluble gB, dimer, or pentamer. shown are also sera from five donors collected 1\u20132 y after onset of HCMV infection (white triangles) antibodies specific for gB, gHgL, and gHgLpUL128L were identified by staining of HCMV-infected cells. a significant higher proportion of the antibodies to gHgL (59.0 18.6%; range, 40\u201383%) had HCMV-neutralizing activity. soluble gB, gHgL dimer, or gHgLpUL128L pentamer immunized mice. soluble gB induced serum antibodies that bound to gB. soluble gB induced serum antibodies that bound to gB. neutralized HCMV infection of epithelial cells versus fibroblasts. gHgLpUL128L pentamer induced antibodies that bound to the dimer and the pentamer (ED50 of 103.1 and 103.9) and showed much higher neutralizing activity. mice were immunized with 5 g of HEK293F-produced soluble gB, gHgL dimer, or gHgLpUL128L pentamer. only a minor fraction of gB-specific mAbs showed neutralizing activity. a large fraction (67%) of mAbs induced by immunization with the pentamer recognized epitopes present on the gHgL dimer. mAbs neutralized infection of epithelial cells but not fibroblasts. the gHgLpUL128L pentamer shows the highest capacity to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection of different cell types. in both cases, the mAb shows the highest capacity to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection of different cell types. h E 11.6 pUL130pUL131 \u2014 7I13, h E 11.0 pUL128pUL130pUL131 10P3/15D8 15D8, h E 11.0 pUL128 7I13 10P3, h E 10.5 pUL130pUL131 7I13 5A2, h E 10.0 pUL130pUL131 8I21 8I21. a single polycistronic vector was designed to achieve a stoichiometric production of the five subunits for an efficient assembly of the pentameric complex. a high-producer clone, named CHO-K1SV-5mer, was selected after two rounds of subcloning. this clone produced, under laboratory scale, batch conditions in protein-free chemically defined medium up to 50 mg/L of pentamer. neutralizing titers were 16,000- and 40,000-fold higher than those found in the sera of donors 1 mo and 1,000- and 300-fold higher than those found 1\u20132 y after HCMV infection. titers were measured on epithelial cells (black circle) and fibroblasts (white circles) mice immunized with 2.5 g of pentamer formulated with either of the three adjuvants were bled 5 mo after the last immunization. high binding and neutralizing antibody titers were still present after 5 mo without booster injection. neutralizing antibody titers measured on epithelial cells (black circles) and fibroblasts (white circles) in the sera of mice collected on day 40 (A) or 150 (B) after immunization with 2.5 g of pentamer formulated with Ribi, Alum, or MF59. sera from pentamer-immunized mice showed a high potency in both assays. sera from pentamer-immunized mice block HCMV cell-to-cell spreading in epithelial cells and virus transfer from infected endothelial cells to leukocytes. serum titers inhibit plaque formation (i.e., cell-to-cell virus spreading) in ARPE-19 cells (A) and HCMV transfer to leukocytes from infected endothelial cells (B) a modified vaccinia Ankara vector expressing rhesus gHgLpUL128L could reduce viral titers following intradermal challenge with rhesus CMV. the Novartis group tested in mice the immunogenicity of gHgL dimers and gHgLpUL128L pentamers administered as viral replicon particles or as proteins with MF59. pentamer vaccine produced in CHO cells can induce a HCMV-neutralizing antibody response of unprecedented potency and breadth. in vivo protection requires neutralizing titers that exceed by at least 100-fold the ID90 values (34) in vivo protection requires neutralizing antibodies that block the interaction of the virus with its receptors on target cells. a clonal analysis of the antibody response in HCMV-infected individuals indicates that only a small fraction of HCMV-specific B cells produces neutralizing antibodies. this low specific activity is not surprising, in view of the fact that the antiviral response is known to be directed to a large extent against internal proteins. it is of interest that the response to surface glycoproteins has different profiles. intronless full-length UL128, UL130, UL131, gH (deprived of the transmembrane portion and the cytoplasmic domains), gL, and gO of VR1814 were cloned into pcDNA3 vectors. gB protein was assessed by ELISA using neutralizing mAbs previously described. CHO cells were seeded at 1 106/mL in ProCho5 (Lonza) for protein expression, CHO cells were seeded at 1 106/mL. after 10 d, supernatants were harvested and loaded on affinity column StrepTactin II (Qiagen) protein purity and identity was verified by SDS/PAGE. plates with captured recombinant proteins were incubated with serial dilutions of human or mouse serum followed by biotinylated mAbs of known specificity. the amount of probe bound was quantified using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. supernatants were screened using both binding and neutralization assays. alum Hydroxide (Sigma), MF59 (Addavax, Invivogen) and RIBI base were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. soluble gB was generated as a truncated ectodomain (amino acids 1\u2013690, accession no. ACZ79977) protein purity was verified by SDS/PAGE followed by SimplyBlue staining (Invitrogen) expression of the gHgLpUL128 pentamer in CHO cells was analyzed. d at 1 106/mL in ProCho5 (Lonza); after 10 d, supernatants were harvested. protease and uncleaved proteins were removed by treatment with the TEV protease. proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography. a plaque inhibition assay on ARPE-19 that had adsorbed HCMV was used to measure cell-to-cell spread as previously described. monolayers of VR1814-infected HUVEC (24-well microplates 96 h p.i.) were incubated with serial dilutions of immune sera for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C followed by addition of leukocytes. female BALB/c mice 6\u20139 wk of age were obtained from Harlan Laboratories. all procedures were performed in accordance with guidelines of the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office."}
