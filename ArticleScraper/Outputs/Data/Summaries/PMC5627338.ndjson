{"summary": "a questionnaire was administered to residents in and around the nature conservation area. participants were chosen from within a limited distance range from the conservation. participants were chosen from within a limited distance range from the conservation. rabies-related diseases include classical rabies, i.e., lyssavirus diseases themselves, natural reservoirs of lyssaviruses, their modes of transmission and prevention and treatment of lyssavirus diseases derived from flying foxes. questionnaires were administered to residents in and around the nature conservation area. respondents to the interviews were aged 15 years and older. they included leaders in the community, at children\u2019s health centers, and of farmer and/or fishermen groups. questionnaires were carried out one-on-one for about 30\u201360 min per person. we used a scoring system to assess people\u2019s knowledge and attitude. incorrect answers were given 0 points, uncertain answers, 1 point and correct answers, 2 points. the maximum score for 15 questions was 30 and the minimum score was 0.
