{"summary": "influenza pandemics occur when an animal influenza virus acquires the ability to cause sustained human-to-human transmission leading to community-wide outbreaks. the 1918 pandemic, known as the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d pandemic, was unique in that the highest number of deaths was among young, healthy persons. the pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968. initial fears that the virus would cause a pandemic did not materialize. sustained transmission did not occur outside of Fort Dix. an influential policy review of the \"swine flu affair\" identified critical needs for future planning. sources We conducted searches of the medical literature and key websites for peer-reviewed manuscripts and published governmental plans relevant to pandemic planning during 1978\u20132008. we also consulted authors\u2019 personal files and the Internet for records of speeches, national and international conference proceedings, and other unpublished original source documents. in 1977, a federal interagency working group on influenza was formed at the request of the deputy assistant secretary for health in the department of health. 1999 CDC emerging infectious disease strategic plan update Pandemic influenza was noted as an emerging infection. 2003 Severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks worldwide The outbreak led to a globally coordinated response to emerging respiratory pathogens. plan was revised in 1983 to include a new recommendation to develop means to distribute and use influenza antiviral drugs (R.A. Strikas, pers. comm.) participants of a 1977 conference on influenza recommended continued federal support for influenza vaccination. CDC implemented a federally funded seasonal influenza immunization program. global events helped accelerate interest in pandemic planning. in 1997, Hong Kong recorded the first outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in humans. in late 1997, >1.5 million chickens culled throughout Hong Kong. results from pilot testing were discussed on April 7\u20138, 1998, at a meeting in Atlanta. a fifth pillar area, guidance for use of antiviral drugs, should be added to the guide. a national steering committee was a logical extension as the planning process moved from a federal to a national effort. CDC presented satellite videoconferences on influenza pandemic preparedness. state and local public health staff engaged in development of pandemic plans participated in the broadcasts. the 2003 reemergence of avian influenza infections in humans fundamentally altered the scale of pandemic preparedness. departments eventually received $550 million to prepare for an influenza pandemic. the national strategy for pandemic influenza was announced in 2005. the white house\u2019s national implementation plan addressed federal planning and response strategies. the world health organization globally promoted pandemic planning among member states, with continued planning efforts thereafter (27). the international partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza was formed to coordinate support for developing countries\u2019 efforts to control the spread of A(H5N1) virus and to prepare for an influenza pandemic. the federal government recognized that the foundation for domestic pandemic response rests with state and local governments. the 4 pandemic planning pillars are a solid foundation for pandemic preparation. reliance on these pillars has remained more or less constant across jurisdictions and over time. the need to maintain ongoing surveillance for novel influenza viruses in humans and animals exemplifies the One Health concept. pandemic planning has been a feature of public health since the late 1970s. pandemic preparedness has been a feature of public health since the late 1970s. pandemic preparedness has been a feature of public health since the late 1970s. there will be a need for continued commitments to support state, local, and national planning for the next infectious disease emergency. a comprehensive, coordinated, and effective response cannot be built at the time of a crisis. a comprehensive, coordinated, and effective response cannot be built at the time of a crisis."}
