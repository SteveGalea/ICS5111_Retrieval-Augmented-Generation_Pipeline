{"summary": "study was undertaken during the height of the Australian pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak. it measured self-reported willingness to comply with physician recommendations to stay home for seven days. responses for the current strain of pandemic influenza, avian influenza, seasonal influenza, and the common cold were incorporated into QSS 2009. only 71% can be expected to comply in the setting of seasonal influenza. sub-populations that might be worthwhile targets include males, younger people, and healthcare workers. the first cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in Australia were reported in may 2009. QSS enables researchers and policy-makers to incorporate questions into the survey. Queensland is the second largest Australian state by land area, and third most populous state. QSS uses a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system. responses were recorded using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from \"very unlikely\" to \"very likely\" responses were dichotomized as \"yes\" and \"no\" and cross-tabulated in a 2 2 table. results QSS 2009 contacted or attempted to contact 3,112 households. 1,536 subjects declined participation, 142 households could not be contacted, and 129 were otherwise ineligible. the final sample for QSS 2009 included 1,292 respondents. anticipated compliance did not differ for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and avian influenza (McNemar's test, p = 0.815 for both versus seasonal influenza) 27.1% of health and community service workers would be unlikely to comply with advice to stay home for seasonal influenza. females were more likely than males to report anticipated compliance for both the common cold (AOR = 1.650; CI: 1.143-2.381) and seasonal influenza (AOR = 1.911; CI: 1.300-2.811) a more recent survey identified 236 respondents who reported flu-like symptoms. 75% of those with symptoms had stayed home. other studies have found support for explicit government action to contain pandemic influenza. males were less likely to report anticipated compliance with stay home advice for a common cold and seasonal influenza. this is consistent with other studies from australia. males have also been reported to feel less susceptible than females to pandemic influenza. more than one-quarter of health and community service workers reported they would not comply with a physician's advice to stay home if they had seasonal influenza. despite evidence of efficacy of vaccinating HCWs, isolating one's self when one has symptoms or a diagnosis of disease is a different proposition than simply refusing to work. public health officials and health facility supervisors must impress upon health workers the clinical and ethical importance of protecting both patients and other staff from exposure to employee-borne influenza. the response rate for this survey was 41.5%; the overall survey was not specific to influenza. there is no reason to suspect that any potential respondent's decision about whether to participate in the survey would be related to their anticipated compliance with a physician's advice to stay home. more than one-quarter of health and community service workers report that they are unlikely to comply with stay home advice for seasonal influenza. more than one-quarter of health and community service workers report that they are unlikely to comply with stay home advice for seasonal influenza. the authors are particularly grateful for the assistance of the project manager, Ms. Christine Hanley."}
