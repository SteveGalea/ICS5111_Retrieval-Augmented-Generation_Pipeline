{"summary": "a total of 186 MERS-CoV cases occurred from May 20 to Nov. 2, 2015. 37 (19.9%) patients died of MERS-CoV infection-related complications. a MERS-CoV outbreak was reported in a hemodialysis unit in Saudi Arabia. patients were hospitalized in negative pressure isolation wards and received medical care under standard, contact, and air-borne precautions. blood pressure, temperature, respiration rate, and pulse rate were monitored regularly after admission. patients also underwent serial chest X-ray tests and chest computed tomography. proteinuria on quantitative evaluation from randomly collected urine was also defined as 2 consecutive microalbumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein to creatinine ratio (PCR) values more than 100 mg/g creatinine (Cr) subjects were hospitalized in negative pressure isolation wards and received medical care under standard, contact, and air-borne precautions. patients also underwent serial chest X-ray tests and chest computed tomography. serial monitoring of laboratory tests was performed for each patient according to the patient's clinical progress. we used a mixed model to test the within- and between-individual differences of repeatedly measured IDMS traceable SCr and eGFR change. we used the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to determine the cumulative survival probability, and the log-rank test to test the survival difference. the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) was 13.3%, 13.3%, and 10%, respectively. fourteen (46.7%) patients received anti-viral treatment. 15 (50.0%) patients showed a random urine ACR or PCR more than 100 mg/g Cr during the observation period. two consecutive results of ACR or PCR values more than 100 mg/g Cr occurred in 11 (36.7%) and 13 (43.3%) patients. patients in the AKI group were older than patients in the no AKI group (P0.001) initial IDMS traceable SCr and eGFR was not different between the two groups. prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and CKD was not different between the two groups. n = 8) no AKI (n = 22) P value Age (yr) 73 10.9 47 19.2 0.001 Male (%) 5 (62.5) 12 (54.5) 1.0 MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction Negative conversion duration (day) 29 14.3 21 7.2 0.13 Initial IDMS traceable SCr (mg/dL) 1.60 2.087 1.47 3.074 0.92 Initial eGFR (IDMS-MDRD) (mL/min/1.73 old age was associated with a higher occurrence of AKI in the univariate analysis. other factors including sex, diabetes, CKD, and the application of a mechanical ventilator were not significant risk factors of AKI. five patients received only mechanical ventilator therapy, 2 received mechanical ventilator and CRRT therapies, and 4 received mechanical ventilator and ECMO therapies. the progression of IDMS traceable SCr and eGFR according to the application of CRRT did not show a statistically significant time interaction during the observation period. baseline characteristics A total of 30 patients were analyzed. the mean and median follow up durations from symptom onset were 31 and 27 (11-81) days. the mean age was 54 yr, and 17 (56.7%) patients were men. the progression of random urine albumin to creatinine ratio, protein to creatinine ratio, is presented in Fig. 1. each point stands for the mean (least square) and standard error (error bar) the mean and median durations to the occurrence of AKI from symptom onset were 18 and 16 days, respectively. in the AKI group and 21 days in the no AKI group (P=0.12) random urine ACR more than 100 or 300 mg/g Cr was more frequently observed in the AKI group than in the no AKI group (P=0.028). the characteristics between the two groups are presented in Table 2. The comparison of IDMS traceable serum creatinine and estimated GFR according to the occurrence of AKI and mortality. any morbidity (%) 5 (62.5) 5 (22.7) 0.06 Anti-viral treatment 4 (50.0) 10 (45.5) 1.0 Random urine protein quantitation ACR or PCR 100 mg/g Cr 6 (75.0) 9 (70.9) 0.22 ACR 100 mg/g Cr 6 (75.0) 5 (22.7) 0.028 PCR 100 mg/g Cr 5 (62.5) 8 (36.4) 0.24 PCR 300 mg/g Cr 5 (62.5) 6 (27.3) 0.10 ACR, album a mechanical ventilator was applied to 12 (40.0%) patients, and 3 (10.0%) patients underwent CRRT. the progression of IDMS traceable SCr and eGFR according to the application of CRRT did not show a statistically significant time interaction. ality 5 patients died of septic shock progression and multiple organ failure. median duration to death from symptom onset was 15 (11,12,13,14,15,16) one patient refused all life extension therapies. two (40.0%) patients received anti-viral treatment, whereas 12 (48.0%) received anti-viral treatment. mechanical ventilator, CRRT, and ECMO therapies were applied to 12 (40%), 3 (10%), and 5 (16.7%) patients died of septic shock progression and multiple organ failure. the first case of MERS-CoV infection had progressive impairment of renal function. patients between the second and third week of the viral infection implied a possibility of kidney tropism of the coronavirus. renal pathological changes associated with human coronavirus may be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by virus replication, as well as indirectly by a systemic toxic reaction. more than 25% of the patients in the present study showed AKI, which is higher than the AKI incidence of SARS-CoV infection (13). the older age of MERS-CoV patients might explain the higher incidence of AKI in the present study. previous cohort was ICU admitted patients. prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and renal disease was 67%, 50%, and 42%. a blood sample 6 weeks after symptom onset was negative for viremia. this study has several limitations. first, there was some loss of data and evaluations of renal complications were not consistent between our institute and hospitals where patients were previously admitted. second, we received only a positive status for MERS-CoV polymerase chain reaction tests."}
