{"summary": "the emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus Nipah virus (NiV) causes severe respiratory and neurological disease in humans, with high fatality rates. but a broadly applicable approach for human NiV outbreaks in field settings is lacking. Viruses Nipah virus (UMMC1, GenBank AY029767, passage 7) isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient was prepared by infecting Vero-E6 cells as described [21], in INSERM Jean M\u00e9rieux biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory. interferon type I (IFN-I) bioassay based on protection from vesicular stomatitis virus infection. groups of 6\u201312 animals were treated daily with peptide i.n. (10 mg/kg) at day 1, 0, and +1 postinfection (p.i.) animals were observed for food consumption, clinical signs, and mortality twice daily. blood was collected by femoral venipuncture in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vacutainer tubes (3 mL/tube), centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm. twenty-four hours after peptide administration, organs were conserved at 80\u00b0C. all animals received daily intratracheal (i.t.) administration of VIKI-dPEG4-Toco peptide or vehicle from day 1 to day 5 postinfection. the additional 3 animals were treated subcutaneously (s.c.) until day 10 (i.t. +s.c.) animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the national charter on the ethics of animal experimentation. experiments were performed in the INSERM Jean M\u00e9rieux BSL-4 laboratory. -Galactosidase Complementation-Based Fusion Assay Receptor-bearing cells expressing omega peptide of -Gal are mixed with cells coexpressing envelope glycoproteins and alpha peptide of -Gal. cell fusion leads to complementation [22, 23] groups of 6\u201312 animals were treated daily with peptide i.n. (10 mg/kg) at day 1, 0, and +1 postinfection (p.i.) animals were infected at day 0 with 106 pfu of NiV (100 lethal dose [LD]50) in 100 L medium. cutainer tubes (3 mL/tube), centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm, and conserved at 20\u00b0C. infection was performed at day 0 with 2 107 pfu of NiV i.t. in 2 mL DMEM. animals were observed daily for 28 days and kept under video-camera observation. peptide administration in both groups led to 33% survival (2 of 6 animals) at indicated days, the peptide concentration in plasma was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. a peptide sequence corresponding to the C-terminal heptad-repeat region (HRC) of another paramyxoviridae family member (HPIV3) inhibits NiV fusion and entry more effectively than peptides derived from NiV F. we recently studied biophysical correlates of peptide antiviral properties using HPIV3 HRC-derived inhibitors [11, 30] joined to the lipid by a flexible PEG linker. the peptides consist of the HPIV3 HRC (amino acids VALDPIDISIVLNKIKSDLEESKEWIRRSNKILDSI-GSGSG-C of HPIV3 F with a GSGSG spacer and C for thioether reaction) the peptides consist of the HPIV3 HRC (amino acids VALDPIDISIVLNKIKSDLEESKEWIRRSNKILDSI-GSGSG-C of peptides VIKI-dPEG4-Chol and VIKI-dPEG4-Toco were superior to bis-lipid conjugated peptides. the peptides were incubated with proteinase K (10 g/mL) at 37\u00b0C. a single exponential decay curve was fitted by nonlinear regression to the experimental data sets to determine the respective peptide half-life. the data points are the average of 2 independent replicates, and error bars correspond to the s.d. Protease Sensitivity of human parainfluenza Virus Type 3-Derived Peptides. hamsters were treated i.n. with the same volume of vehicle or peptide (10 mg/kg) on days 1, 0, and 1 of infection. both peptides, given only 3 times, were effective in the face of a high inoculum of NiV. i.t. administration (vs i.n. in hamsters) was used to deliver peptide to the respiratory tract, limiting passage into the gut. the treatment was well tolerated, with no significant adverse effects related to administration. a sensitive IFN-I bioassay performed with sera taken at 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours posttreatment showed no increase in IFN-I in any of 4 tested animals. the animals were administered 10 mg/kg of peptide either i.t. (animals A and B) or 10 mg/kg i.t. plus 2 mg/kg s.c. (animals C and D) Peptide was given on days 1, 0, and daily until day 5 p.i. either i.t. or both i.t. or s.c. treatment continued until day 10 using 10 mg/kg peptide i.t. and 2 mg/kg s.c. the other group of 3 animals received i.t. treatment alone on the same schedule. s.c. 9 Partial expectoration of the treatment on day 0 and 4, hyperthermia, loss of appetite, epistaxis; animal succumbed on day 8 7 i.t. + s.c. 28 Hyperthermia, loss of appetite; animal recovered without any obvious clinical signs at the end of protocol 8 i.t. 7 Partial expectoration of the treatment on day 1, loss of appetite, increased temperature, dehydration; animal succumbed at day 7 9 two untreated animals survived until day 13. the treatment slowed the course of infection and allowed the surviving animals to develop a protective antiviral humoral response. all infected animals showed traces of the infection in the lungs. a peptide sequence corresponding to the C-terminal heptad-repeat region (HRC) of another paramyxoviridae family member (HPIV3) inhibits NiV fusion and entry more effectively than peptides derived from NiV F. a flexible PEG linker is soluble in both aqueous and organic media and therefore in both plasma/extracellular fluids and membranes, nontoxic and nonimmunogenic. peptides consist of the HPIV3 HRC (amino acids VALDPIDISIVLNKIKSDLEESKEWIRRSNKILDSI-GSGSG-C of HPIV3 F with a GSGSG spacer and C for thioether reaction) d VIKI-dPEG4-Chol and VIKI-dPEG4-bisToco were superior to bis-lipid conjugated peptides. the peptides were incubated with proteinase K (10 g/mL) at 37\u00b0C. peptide content was calculated from densitometry measurements of silver-stained peptide. a single exponential decay curve was fitted to the experimental data sets to determine the respective peptide half-life. the data points are the average of 2 independent replicates, and error bars correspond to the s.d. protease Sensitivity of human parainfluenza Virus Type 3-Derived Peptides. hamsters were treated i.n. with the same volume of vehicle or peptide (10 mg/kg) on days 1, 0, and 1 of infection. both peptides, given only 3 times, were effective in the face of a high inoculum of NiV. VIKI-dPEG4-Toco was chosen over VIKI-dPEG4-Chol. both peptides significantly improved survival. i.t. administration was used to deliver peptide to the respiratory tract. i.t. administration was used to deliver peptide to the respiratory tract. a sensitive IFN-I bioassay performed with sera taken at 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours posttreatment showed no increase in IFN-I in any of 4 tested animals. Figure 3. Biodistribution of VIKI-dPEG4-Chol and VIKI-dPEG4-Toco peptides after intratracheal (i.t.) or i.t. plus subcutaneous (s.c.) administration in African green monkeys. Peptide was given on days 1, 0, and daily until day 5 p.i. either i.t. or both i.t. or s.c. treatment continued until day 10 using 10 mg/kg peptide i.t. and 2 mg/kg s.c. the other group of 3 animals received i.t. treatment alone on the same schedule. animal euthanized on day 13 5 i.t. + s.c. 9 Partial expectoration of the treatment on days 1, 1, and 5, hyperthermia, loss of appetite, prostration; animal succumbed on day 8 7 i.t. + s.c. 28 Loss of appetite, but animal recovered without any visible clinical signs at the end of protocol 10 i.t. 8 Partial expectoration of the treatment on day 1, loss of appetite, increased temperature, dehydr i.t. plus s.c. administration, free peptide was present in the serum at high levels at day 2 onwards, with levels from 100 to 150 nM until treatment ended on day 7. two untreated animals, which survived until day 13, exhibited detectable neutralizing antibody responses. the treatment slowed the course of infection and allowed the surviving animals to develop a protective antiviral humoral response. circulating lymphocytes (A\u2013C) and monocytes (D\u2013F) over 30 days in AGMs infected with NiV. circulating lymphocytes (A\u2013C) and monocytes (D\u2013F) over 30 days in AGMs infected with NiV. lipopeptide fusion inhibitors can be broadly applied. peptide sequence derived from the HRC domain of human parainfluenza virus (HPIV3) inhibits both HPIV3 and NiV. cell-based experiments showed this peptide to be an effective NiV fusion inhibitor (Figure 1A) and stable to protease degradation (Figure 1B). both VIKI-dPEG4-Chol and VIKI-dPEG4-Toco (data not shown) reached high levels in the lung. the sequence of peptide regions that participate in the fusion intermediate is sufficient information to generate fusion inhibitors. this knowledge is already available for most viruses, or it can be inferred from the genetic information of the pathogen. if tocopherol conjugation be proven to provide adequate human safety and pharmacokinetics, this strategy would likely extend to other tocopherol-conjugated peptides.
