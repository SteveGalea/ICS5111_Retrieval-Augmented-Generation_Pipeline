{"summary": "metagenomics is an approach that allows for the identification of both cultivable and uncultivable microbes in a mixed community. it is an approach that allows for the identification of both cultivable and uncultivable microbes in a mixed community, based on a genomic technique [2,3,4]. genomes are assembled together to form a contigs using various assembly tools. the assembling of the raw reads is either through a reference-guide genome assembly or through a de novo genome assembly. the taxonomic designations and phylogenetic tree analysis of the organisms are done using sequences already deposited on the public sequence database. tools and software packages such as newbler, MIRA, AMOS, Botiwe, BLAT, Bfast, BWA, NovoAlign and MetaAMOS are commonly used in metagenomics for performing referenced-based assemblies. a virion is made up of a protein coat and genomic information, encoded in DNA/RNA. a protein coat is capable of replication through adsorption, penetration, uncoating, viral genome replication, maturation and release. a virion is made up of a protein coat and genomic information, encoded in DNA/RNA. some serotypes have a strong resistance to chlorine disinfection. after treatment, the effluents are released into the aquatic ecosystems. the outbreak of HEV disease in both developed and undeveloped nations has been documented by the world health organization (WHO) hepatitis A, adenoviruses, astroviruses, noroviruses, enteroviruses, rotaviruses and bacteriophages have been detected in surface water. the identification and quantification of HEV in south africa was mostly done using conventional and traditional methods in both clinical and environmental samples. metagenomics is still an emerging technique for the identification and diversification of HEV in both environmental and clinical samples in south africa. there is little knowledge pertaining to the viral content and diversity in wastewater systems in south africa. new methodologies such as metagenomics are vital for the identification of unique or unlooked-for viruses in the aquatic ecosystems. Table 2 provides a short summary of the conventional and improved concentration procedures used for the recovery of HEV in environmental samples. Virus Technique Advantages Disadvantages References Enterovirus Membrane adsorption technique Simple, speed, sensitive Low efficiency of virus adsorption Easy clogging of membrane filter [89] Enterovirus Aqueous polymer two phase separation Simple and cost effective Requires small sample volumes Limited serotypes identified Inhibitory action of salts [82,89,90 cell culture is the most pronounced traditional standards used to identify and detect the occurrence of HEV in environmental samples [82,98,99]. cell culture is a technique whereby a microorganism\u2019s cells are grown at a carefully controlled condition outside of the living animal [100]. Flow cytometry and vortex flow filtration have also been used for the quantification and counting of virus-like particles and prokaryotes in aquatic environments [98,111,112]. Figure 3 shows the numerous molecular approaches that have been used in the diagnostics and identification of HEV from different environmental samples. PCR techniques are incapable of distinguishing between active and inactive targets. they are prone to inhibition due to the interaction with DNA. different primer sequences make it inappropriate for use, especially with the discovery of unique viruses. 5\u2032-FAM-ACAACTGCAGCTTCAAAAGAAGWGT-MGBNFQ-3\u2032 NSP3 gene [69,73,126] GI GI GII JV13I (F) 5\u2032-TCA TCA CTA TGA TGA TGA TGA TGA YTA-3\u2032 JV13I (F) 5\u2032-TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA T GCCCTCCATYTCAAACACTAWTTT Sapo.probeA (FAM) CTGTACCACCTATGAACCA Sapo.probeB (FAM) TGCACCACCTATGAAC RdRp-VP1 region [130,131] Salivirus F: 5\u2032-TCTGCTTGGTGCCAACCTC-3\u2032 R: 5\u2032-CCARGCACACACATGAGRGGATAC-3\u2032 VP1 region or 3CD region. the RT-PCR are able to amplify and detect HEV viruses that possess only the RNA genomic information [27,49,69,89,109,110,111,111,112] these techniques offer better rates of detection, and great sensitivity and accuracy. they also offer better rates of detection, and great sensitivity and accuracy. amplification is achieved by converting DNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) in a reverse transcription procedure Speed sensitivity Contamination Specificity Repeatability Sequence knowledge is a perquisite, expensive, Possible reaction inhibition, and there is a need for experts for the interpretation as well as the accuracy of results. biosensor-based method Formation of antigen\u2014antibody through recognition and binding High sensitivity Specificity speed Easy automation and equipment QC assurance dependent Risk of interferences Expensive [162,163] Biosensor-based methods analytical device that identifies non-polar molecules High specificity Reaction time is short Relies on specific antibodies or DNA Probes Necessary chemical inactivation for the recognition sites. tagenomics has provided the detection of viral species presumed to be a potential threat to human health [130,178], means for virus discovery [179], and the characterization of the viral population [171,180]. more metagenomic datasets of viruses have been established, with approximately 50 articles available to date. 454 platform was able to detect and study the dominant DNA and RNA viral species in reclaimed water. the study showed that both the reclaimed and portable water was dominated by phages. it has also been explored for the sequencing and microbial profiling of multiple viral groups from animal samples and sediments from the Athabasca River. the emerging third-generation sequencing technologies are the Pacific Biosciences single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing, nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore, and the Helicos TM Genetic Analysis System [23,169,186,195,196] the technology has the potential of generating high read lengths of up to 100,000 bp within hours. cell culture is a technique whereby a microorganism\u2019s cells are grown at a carefully controlled condition outside of the living animal [100] it is a very time consuming, laborious and expensive approach that usually demands prior knowledge of the targeted species. the merit of this technique is that it gives room for several modifications of the protocols. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a sensitive conventional assay technique that is used on targeted amplification of the viral DNA or RNA over a range of magnitude to produce thousands or millions of copies. PCR methods are designed to amplify a single specific nucleic acid sequence a million times. for denaturation to take place, the target DNA is subjected to a high temperature in other for the DNA strands to be separated. Various modifications of the PCR assay have been used for detection of HEV. they include the nested [118], multiplex [119,120,121], real time [106], and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [118] all displaying their own merits and demerits. 5\u2032-TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TCA TGA TGA TGA TGA YTA-3\u2032 JV13I (F) 5\u2032-TCN GAA ATG GAT GTT GG-3\u2032 JV12Y (F) 5\u2032-ATA CTA TGA TGA TGA TTC-3\u2032 Polymerase region ssRNA [73,127] Adenoviruses JTVX(F) 5\u2032-GGACGCCTCGGAGTACC the presence of norovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus have been established via multiplex and nested PCR. the RT-PCR are able to amplify and detect HEV viruses that possess only the RNA genomic information. molecular methods for the identification of different groups of the HEV in various environments offer better rates of detection, and great sensitivity and accuracy. these techniques also offer better rates of detection, and great sensitivity and accuracy. they also reduce experiment time and the possible source of contamination is reduced [51,78]. amplification of sequences of several pathogenic microorganisms in a reaction mixture Sequence dependent, Cost and time effective, High sensitivity and specific Cannot detect new viral species Challenges with optimisation and sensitivity for all targeted species Contamination Non-specific amplification in environmental samples The amplified PCR product is now used as a template for the next round of amplification Increased sensitivity Potential risk of contamination and carry-over. methods analytical device that identifies analytes via electrical signal Detects non-polar molecules High specificity Reaction time is short Relies on specific antibodies or DNA Probes Necessary chemical inactivation for the recognition sites. sequencing of the genomic DNA information using metagenomics can be achieved either through the PCR amplicon sequencing or via shotgun metagenomics. research articles on metagenomic studies on human virome in diverse parts of the world have risen from around 200 articles in 2002, to more than 12,000 articles in 2017. more metagenomic datasets of viruses have been established due to this, more metagenomic datasets of viruses have been established. the Ion Torrent platform has been explored for the sequencing and microbial profiling of multiple viral groups from animal samples and sediments from the Athabasca River [190,191]. the rudimentary workflow for second-generation sequencing is shown in Figure 4. Table 5 shows the strength and weakness of the different second-generation platforms. Pacific Bioscience (SMRT) Single molecule real time (SMRT) Fluorescently labelled nucleotides 4000\u20135000 nts 200 Mb\u20131 Gb generated under few hours Data generation is monitored in real-time, Accurate Expensive, high error rates. the technology has the potential of generating high read lengths of up to 100,000 bp within hours, and is very expensive to acquire [186,195,196]. metagenomics is emerging as an alternative technique for viral identification, diversity and abundance in a range of environmental samples. it is emerging as an alternative technique for viral identification, diversity and abundance, in a range of environmental samples which includes the ocean environment. intercontinental virome diversity studies on culex mosquitoes were done using samples from Kenya and China and analysed using NGS. the study also indicated the presence of some specific vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and protozoa as well as uncategorized assembly of viruses. metagenomics has not been explored to the fullest, except in few environments. a study of viral diversity using metagenomics has not been explored to the fullest, except in few environments. the metaviromes indicated the predominant presence of HAdV-17 in mussel samples. this is an indication that it is not only the environmental samples that should be the most important priority; both food products and clinical samples should be screened thoroughly. the manifestation of HAdV-D17 in the seafood samples raises an alarm round the ecological health state of the river. the field has gained momentum, giving room and opportunity for the characterization of all possible microbes in a sample. this is due to the fact that these viruses have a mysterious way of contaminating and polluting the entire aquatic ecosystem. this is due to the fact that these viruses have a mysterious way of contaminating and polluting the world\u2019s entire aquatic ecosystem. a wide range of challenges are defying researchers in Africa, such as limited scientific resources, limited human skills, insufficient training and lack of access to genome sequencing facilities. we recommend that more energy should be directed towards instituting more water and safety programmes in emerging nations."}
