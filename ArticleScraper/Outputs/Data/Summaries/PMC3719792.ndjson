{"summary": "nearly all vertebrate cells produce type I interferons (IFNs) this class of cytokines can induce expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) this class of cytokines can induce expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) thereby establishing an antiviral state in neighboring cells. accumulating evidence suggests that IFITM-3 alters the membranes of the vesicular compartments. the mechanism behind the differential sensitivity of viruses to these proteins is not understood. IFITM-3 was most potent in resisting FLUAV, VSIV, WNV and DENV infections. RVFV, a phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, forms spherical enveloped virions that contain three single-stranded genomic RNAs. the endocytosed virions further undergo a low-pH-dependent membrane fusion (32) that leads to the release of the RNP into the cytoplasm. a large fraction of IFITM-1 resides in a vesicular compartment different from that occupied by IFITM-2 or -3. we hypothesize that bunyaviruses may be restricted by IFITMs, similar to RVFV. unlike RVFV infection, IFITM-1, -2, and -3 were all able to prevent LACV, HTNV, and ANDV infection with similar efficiencies. the RVFV MP-12 strain, derived from virulent strain ZH548 of RVFV, is highly attenuated by several mutations (35, 36), retains its sensitivity to IFN- (37, 38), and serves as an alternate model to the virulent RVFV strain. the virus from the supernatant was precipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 5% polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, 8,000; Sigma) and 2.3% NaCl (Sigma CCHFV IbAr10200 was passaged twice in SW13 cells, twice in HepG2 cells, and twice in CER cells. the virus-containing cell culture supernatant from the final passage was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min. iagen were used to transfect HeLa cells in 96-well plates (8,000 cells per well) with a 15 nM solution of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting human IFITM-1 (catalog no.

RESULTS RVFV infection is restricted by overexpression of IFITM-2 and IFITM-3. IFITM-2- or -3-mediated restriction was relatively profound in cells infected at a lower MOI. at higher MOIs, less restriction was observed, most likely because some infectious virions might have escaped IFITM restriction. Vero E6 cells stably expressing IFITM-1, -2, or -3 were infected with RVFV MP-12 (B and C), RVFV ZH501 (D and E), or JUNV (F) at a specific MOI and for a specific duration of time. the percentage of infected cells was determined by evaluating the number of cells that expressed the viral protein GP for RVFV MP-12 infections (B and C), NP for RVFV ZH IFITM regulation of RVFV infection in multiple cell lines. cells that stably overexpressed IFITM-1, IFITM-2, or -3 or vector alone subjected them to RVFV infection. incubation of RVFV at MOIs as low as 0.5 and 0.01 for periods of 24 h and 48 h achieved 80 to 100% infection rate in HeLa cells. concentrations as low as 5 U/ml of IFN- inhibited RVFV infection by 50%. all data were normalized to those for the corresponding gene transcript levels under the IFN--untreated condition. data are representative of at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the means standard deviation. IFITM-1 mRNA expression showed a higher degree of induction (4-fold) than IFITM-2 (2-fold) or IFITM-3 (3-fold) mRNA expression. but the high degree of induction could have been due to the relatively very low levels of IFITM-1 mRNA expression under basal conditions. this observation was further supported by immunostaining data that showed very low to undetectable levels of IFITM-1 under basal conditions. the percentage of RVFV-infected HeLa cells increased upon depletion of IFITM-2 or IFITM-3. this increase became more pronounced (by about 2-fold) when both IFITMs were depleted together and was similar to that when all IFITMs (IFITM-1, -2, and -3) were depleted together. the antiviral effects of IFITM-2 and -3 were profound at a specific window of time. the level of IFITM gene knockdown upon siRNA treatment was determined in HeLa cells that were transfected with siRNAs targeting the IFITM-1, -2, or -3 gene individually. the level of IFITM gene knockdown upon siRNA treatment was determined by normalizing the data to those for control nontargeting siRNA-treated cells. tion of IFITM-2 or IFITM-3 proteins alone or together increased infection of cells compared to that for cells with IFITM-1 depletion or cells treated with nontargeting siRNA. the antiviral effect of IFN- at a lower dose of 5 U/ml could be mitigated by almost 50%. we first characterized the kinetics and localization of viral GP and NP expression during the course of RVFV infection. cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with RVFV NP- or GP-specific antibodies to detect the expression of the corresponding viral proteins. the percentage of cells that expressed NP, GP, or S-GP was determined by high-content quantitative image-based analysis. HeLa cells were infected with MP-12 virus at an MOI of 5 (A to C) or the MOI indicated in panel D for 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 h. infected cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with RVFV GP- or NP-specific antibodies to detect the expression of the corresponding viral proteins. images were acquired by confocal microscopy and subject to high-content quantitative image-based analysis. equal numbers of cells of each stable Vero E6 cell line expressing IFITM-1, -2, or -3 or control cells were plated at 100% confluence and incubated with RVFV for 5 min or 1 h on ice. viral RNA associated with the cells was analyzed by qRT-PCR analysis. cells were incubated with virus at an MOI of 0.1 for 1 h on ice and then rapidly moved to 37\u00b0C. at the indicated time points, cells were triedpsinized to remove surface-bound virus and then washed twice with PBS, followed by RNA extraction. this time course was used to assess if IFITMs regulate virion endocytosis. cells were treated with trypsin and washed extensively to remove cell surface-bound virions. there was a minimal increase in the amount of viral RNA within the cells. however, at later time points, 6, 8, or 10 h postinfection, a gradual and significant increase in viral RNA copy number was observed. amplification of viral RNA and NP expression occurred at 6 to 8 h postinfection. control or IFITM-1 cells infected at an MOI of 0.5 yielded the same percentage of NP-expressing cells as IFITM-2 or IFITM-3-overexpressing cells infected at an MOI of 1. cell line stably expressing IFITM-1, -2, or -3 or empty vector were seeded overnight. cells were incubated with virus at an MOI of 0.5 (solid lines) for 1 h and washed to remove unbound virus. percentage of cells that stained positive for NP expression was determined. cells depleted of IFITM-2 and IFITM-3 had enhanced RVFV infection compared to control cells or cells depleted of IFITM-1. this inhibition was mitigated to a large extent by depleting IFITM-2 and IFITM-3. this inhibition was mitigated to a large extent by depleting IFITM-2 and IFITM-3. cells were fixed and immunostained to determine the percentage of cells expressing GP. a majority of the IFITM-1 protein localizes to distinct compartments. a majority of the IFITM-1 protein localizes to distinct compartments. a large fraction of IFITM-1 did not colocalize with IFITM-2. antibody against IFITM-2 cross-reacts with IFITM-3. it is possible that RVFV is not restricted by IFITM-1. IFITM-1-overexpressing cells had large vesicles, with some reaching the size of the nucleus. the same pattern was observed in HeLa, A549, and 293T cell lines overexpressing IFITMs. the large vesicles exhibited a lower fluorescence intensity with LysoTracker dyes (below the background threshold) IFITMs exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several members of the Bunyaviridae family. we further tested if IFITMs can restrict infection by other members of the Bunyaviridae family. cell lines stably overexpressing IFITM-1, -2, or -3 or vector alone were generated in vero E6 cells. expression of myc-tagged IFITM proteins in these cell lines was analyzed by Western blotting. IFITM-2 and IFITM-3 proteins restrict RVFV infection. the percentage of infected cells was determined by assessing the number of cells that expressed the viral protein GP for RVFV MP-12 infections (B and C), NP for RVFV ZH501 (D and E) IFITM-2, or IFITM-3 or the vector alone were infected with RVFV MP-12 at an MOI of 0.01 for 36 h and stained to detect the expression of GP (red) and nuclei (blue) previous studies have shown that VSIV, WNV, and DENV-1/2, similar to RVFV, were restricted by IFITM-2 and -3 but not by IFITM-1 (10, 12) however, this pattern of restriction was cell type dependent. percentage of cells stained positive for NP expression was determined by high-content quantitative image-based analysis. IFN- inhibits RVFV infection and induces IFITM gene expression in HeLa cells. IFN- inhibits RVFV infection and induces IFITM expression. cells were immunostained to detect the expression of GP. data are presented as the percentage of infected cells. the data in panel E were normalized to the intensities of the corresponding genes under the IFN--untreated condition. the level of induction of IFITM expression by IFN- at its lowest dose (5 U/ml) that was sufficient to inhibit RVFV infection by greater than 50% was determined. cells were immunostained to detect IFITM expression at 24 h. depletion of IFITM-2 and IFITM-3, but not IFITM-1, enhances RVFV MP-12 infection. the optimized conditions depicted in Fig. 3A and B were applied to test how depletion of IFITM proteins under basal conditions influences RVFV infection of HeLa cells. forty-eight hours later, cells were infected with RVFV at an MOI of 0.05 for a period of 28 h, 36 h, or 42 h FITM-2 and IFITM-3 proteins enhance RVFV infection under basal and IFN--induced conditions. cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting IFITM-1, IFITM-2, IFITM-3, IFITM-2 and -3, IFITM-1, -2, and -3. at 48 h after siRNA transfection, cells were infected with RVFV at an MOI of 0.05 for a duration of 28 h, 36 h, or IFITM-2 and IFITM-3 mediate a large amount of the antiviral activity of IFN- at lower levels. we tested whether a more profound effect on RVFV MP-12 infection could be observed upon depletion of IFITMs in IFN--treated cells. IFN- was used at 5 U/ml in HeLa cells to evaluate IFITM-mediated restriction of RVFV infection. target gene knockdown efficiency was determined by qRT-PCR analysis. at the time of infection, the expression of the corresponding gene was inhibited by greater than 90% at the level of mRNA in cells transfected with siRNAs targeting IFITM-1, -2, or -3 simultaneously. viral NP expression reached a detectable level within 6 to 8 h postinfection, followed by GP expression at 8 to 10 h. this was further confirmed by plaque assay of the virus collected from cell culture supernatants. one round of RVFV replication takes 10 to 12 h. IFITM-2 and IFITM-3 proteins do not interfere with viral attachment or virion entry into cells. the role(s) of IFITMs in RVFV cell attachment was analyzed. equal number of cells (5 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate) of the vero E6 cell line stably expressing IFITM-1, -2, or -3 or control vector were incubated without or with cold MP-12 virus at an MOI of 0.1 for 5 min or 1 h on ice. unbound virus was washed off twice with cold PBS, and cells were moved to 37\u00b0C. RVFV uncoating requires a low endosomal pH (32). ammonium chloride at a concentration of 20 mM raises the endosomal pH. this inhibits virus membrane fusion without causing overall cytotoxicity. after 12 h, cells were fixed and stained for viral GP expression. RVFV NP expression was observed starting at 6 h postinfection. the differences in viral RNA levels are most likely due to reduced viral replication or inhibition of the release of viral RNA from the endocytosed vesicles into the cytoplasm. control or IFITM-1 cells infected at an MOI of 0.5 yielded the same percentage of NP-expressing cells as IFITM-2- or IFITM-3-overexpressing cells infected at an MOI of 1. as time progressed, the percentage of NP-positive cells remained similar among these populations of cells. IFITM concentrations increased progressively for the duration of the experiment. most of the RVFV virions (>50%) entered cells during the first 30 min following virus attachment. we treated HeLa cells with IFN--untreated cells at 24 h or 7 h prior to infection. otype in IFITM-2- or -3-depleted cells was calculated by subtracting the infection rate for cells treated with the respective siRNAs from the infection rate for control nontargeted siRNA-treated cells. results suggest that IFITM-2 and -3 target early events of the viral life cycle following viral internalization but prior to viral replication. a majority of the IFITM-1 protein localizes to distinct compartments and does not localize with the IFITM-2 or -3 protein. different members of the IFITM family restricted viruses with different efficiencies, and the efficiency of restriction was also dependent on the cell line model used for infection. DIC images were overlaid with myc (red)-stained images to show that the large vesicles formed in these cells were coated by the corresponding IFITM protein. difference in the patterns of expansion in acidified compartments by different members of the IFITM family. cells stably expressing Myc IFITM-1, IFITM-2, or IFITM-3 or empty vector were stained with LysoTracker red DND-99 (LTRed; top) or LysoTracker green DND-26 (LTGreen; bottom) to visualize the acidified compartments in the cells. the images were exported to the Columbus database and analyzed with acapella spot detection algorithm. IFITM-1 was able to suppress LACV, HTNV, and ANDV infection to the same extent as IFITM-2 or -3. further studies are warranted to more broadly examine the role of IFITMs in restriction of other viruses within the family Bunyaviridae. RVFV was sensitive to IFN- treatment at concentrations as low as 5 U/ml. under these conditions, RVFV MP-12 infection was inhibited by greater than 70%. the level of inhibition was dependent on both the MOI of the virus and the duration of infection. RVFV MP-12 is widely used for molecular characterization of RVFV infection. the parameters determined should be useful to explore how infection modulators influence specific stages of the RVFV life cycle. our data indicate that RVFV attachment to the cell surface occurs rapidly and about 80% of the viral entry and uncoating happens during the first hour postinfection. FITM-3-overexpressing cells inhibit release of virion cores from the endosome into the cytoplasm. david frum: FITMs restrict cathepsin-dependent entry of SARS-CoV into the lysosome. but they do not restrict trypsin-induced fusion at or near the plasma membrane. frum: the exact mechanism of this inhibition should be the focus of future studies. IFITMs modulate the biology of the vesicular compartments that they occupy and probably influence virus trafficking. IFITM-2 and -3 but not IFITM-1 inhibited RVFV infection in all cell types tested. previous reports have shown a similar pattern of IFITM repression in VSIV, WNV, and DENV infection in some cell types. our attempts to visualize virions trapped inside IFITM-coated compartments were not successful due to the large background of noninfectious virions. the work presented here advances our understanding of RVFV infection."}
