{"summary": "syncytial virus (RSV) is a major viral cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children worldwide. no vaccine is currently available for this age group. Detailed data on shedding in individuals in relation to age, infecting subtype, infection severity, and gender would help in identifying the source of infant infection. a prospective cohort study was undertaken in rural coastal Kenya. a household was defined as a group of individuals living in the same compound and with common cooking arrangements. a household was defined as a group of individuals living in the same compound and with common cooking arrangements. the period within which an individual provided specimens which were PCR positive for the same infecting RSV group was considered left- or right-censored. episodes where the first sample was positive for both groups were counted as one infection episode. episodes where no samples were collected for >7 days before or after the infection episode were considered left- or right-censored. the authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation. the infection data were interval-censored and three possible durations of viral shedding were estimated, i.e. minimum, midpoint and maximum. episodes where the first sample was positive for both RSV groups A and B counted as one infection episode. episodes where no samples were collected for >7 days before or after the infection episode were considered left- or right-censored 179 (363%) had at least one RSV infection from 40 (851%) different households followed. the median age (IQR) at the start of the first observed infection was 65 (IQR 24\u2013145) years. females numbered 96 (536%) (Table 1). household outbreak No \u2014 42 205 Yes \u2014 \u2014 163 795 Outcome Durationd 7 days \u2014 \u2014 74 361 7\u201314 days \u2014 \u2014 75 366 15\u201321 days \u2014 \u2014 32 156 21 days \u2014 \u2014 24 117 RSV, Respiratory syncytial virus; ARI, acute respiratory illness. the episodes in this individual occurred 54 days apart. for the purposes of estimation of the shedding duration, all the episodes were considered distinct. twenty-four individuals shed RSV for 21 days. of these 10 (417%) were aged 1 year, six (250%) were aged 1\u20134 years, and eight (292%) aged 5\u201317 years. the prolonged shedders contributed 6475 days of RSV shedding. 106 96\u2013117 109 97\u2013121 74 45\u2013102 89 67\u2013110 148. in most (12/14) episodes, one or more samples were identified to contain both RSV groups A and B. the proportionality assumption in the Cox regression model was not violated based on the test of the Schoenfeld residuals (Supplementary Table S3). the adjusted HR (aHR) were 198 (95% 130\u2013302), 182 (95% CI 116\u2013287), 210 (95% CI 120\u2013366) and 131 (95% CI 036\u2013481) in the 1\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201339 and 40 years age groups. the rate of recovery was lower by 44% in symptomatic infections relative to asymptomatic infections. the rate of recovery did not differ significantly by gender and infecting RSV group. 179 (363%) had at least one RSV infection from 40 (851%) different households. the median age (interquartile range; IQR) at the start of the first observed infection was 65 (IQR 24\u2013145) years. 0 17 83 Gender Female 272 552 116 566 Male 221 448 89 434 RSV subtype Group A \u2014 81 395 Group B \u2014 \u2014 110 537 Groups A and B \u2014 \u2014 14 68 Order of infection First \u2014 179 873 Second \u2014 26 127 Symptomatic, i.e. with ARI No \u2014 87 424 Yes \u2014 118 576 Presence of co-infection No \u2014 \u2014 the duration between the episodes ranged from 17 to 54 days. the failure to sequence was mainly in samples with a PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of > 280. only one of the successfully sequenced paired samples showed nucleotide differences. the mean duration of shedding based on minimum, midpoint and maximum estimates was 86 [95% confidence interval (CI) 75\u201397], 112 (95% CI 101\u2013123) and 140 (95% CI 128\u2013152) days. twenty-four individuals shed RSV for 21 days, and of these 10 (417%) were aged 1 year, six (250%) were aged 1\u20134 years, and eight (292%) aged 5\u201317 years. after 42 38\u201345 37 36\u201339 96 86\u2013105 34 28\u201340 1850 \u2014 After 52 42\u201363 37 35\u201338 34 24\u201343 241 133\u2013349 110 \u2014 Age, yearsg 111 93\u2013130 104 86\u2013123 151 50\u2013251 156 65\u2013246 169. the solid red circle () and blue marker () represents RSV groups A and B. the red line links PCR-positive samples denoting the RSV episode. the results were similar without and with inclusion of the left-censored RSV episodes. the rate of recovery from RSV infection was age-dependent. the adjusted HR (aHR) were 198 (95% 130\u2013302), 182 (95% CI 116\u2013287), 210 (95% CI 120\u2013366) and 131 (95% CI 036\u2013481) in the 1\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201339 and 40 years age groups. the rate of recovery of RSV episodes associated with spread in the household was 42% lower than the single household episodes (aHR 058, 95% CI 032\u2013073). the rate of recovery of RSV episodes associated with spread in the household was 42% lower than the single household episodes (aHR 058, 95% CI 043\u2013078) the present study was informed by critical review of the previous studies. it incorporated frequent sampling regardless of symptoms and screening by highly sensitive PCR methods. the specimen collection procedure was acceptable, recording a good compliance across all ages. in the present study, 24 (134%) episodes in 179 infected individuals involved shedding RSV for >3 weeks. most (22, 917%) of these episodes were symptomatic, and occurred in young children (median age 147 months) the lack of variability in the virus identified in the two phases of infections suggests virus mutation might not be the primary mechanism for virus persistence or re-infection. the age of the individual, infection severity, detection of other viruses before and during the RSV infection, and presence of concurrent RSV infections in the same household were all associated with virus shedding. study involving 23 hospitalized children (aged 2 years) with sampling extended beyond discharge reported an association of duration of shedding and symptom severity. shedding may be related to severity of disease but evidence is controversial on the link between disease severity and viral load. click here to view supplementary material."}
