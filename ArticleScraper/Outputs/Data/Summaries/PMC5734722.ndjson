{"summary": "new point of care diagnostics are urgently needed to reduce the over-prescription of antimicrobials for bacterial respiratory tract infection (RTI) 71 patients were prospectively recruited from the Acute Medical Unit of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital between March and May 2016. no study has attempted to identify VOC signatures associated with bacterial infection in an unselected population presenting with RTI. the gold standard for VOC detection is gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS), which allows identification of individual VOCs. however, these instruments are large, expensive, cumbersome, usually laboratory based and require specialized staff to operate them. the gas-capillary column ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS) can be made smaller, cheaper than GCMS, use air as the carrier gas and require minimal training to use. a prospective cross sectional proof-of-concept study was carried out in hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of RTI. patients delivered a breath sample directly into the machine by exhaling into a disposable mouthpiece. the patient was asked to inhale and then exhale a single deep breath. the results of VOC analyses were stored in the device\u2019s internal memory for later downloading and review. all patients were asked to eat nothing and drink only water for 30 minutes prior to providing samples. an ambient air sample was collected for each breath sample for comparison immediately after collection of the patient breath sample. the total analysis time for each sample was 10 minutes. a p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the GC-IMS data are very high dimensional, so it is convenient to reduce this via a dimensionality reduction (i.e. compression) sparse principal component analysis is known from prior work to give good performance on GC-IMS type data [15] we used an elbow plot to determine that for these data, 10 sparse principal components (PCs) should be learned from the input data. the 10-dimensional PCs were then used as input to a 5-fold cross-validation which used sparse logistic regression to predict outcomes. patients delivered a breath sample directly into the machine by exhaling into a disposable mouthpiece. only the last three seconds of exhaled breath was collected for analysis. the results of VOC analyses were stored in the device\u2019s internal memory for later downloading and review. an ambient air sample was collected for each breath sample. this allows the background air contamination to be subtracted from the sample. the total analysis time for each sample was 10 minutes. an ambient air sample was collected for each breath sample. this allows the background air contamination to be subtracted from the patient\u2019s sample. the total analysis time for each sample was 10 minutes. a p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the GC-IMS data are very high dimensional, so it is convenient to reduce this via a dimensionality reduction (i.e. compression step) we used an elbow plot to determine that for these data, 10 sparse principal components (PCs) should be learned from the input data. the 10-dimensional PCs were then used as input to a 5-fold cross-validation which used sparse logistic regression to predict outcomes. normal Aggregate bacterial Other p value Range Total n 28 43 Male n (%) 21 (75%) 17 (40%) 0.004 Age median (IQR) 64.5 (16.5) 67.5 (23.9) 0.609 Current smoker n (%) 12 (43%) 12 (28%) 0.210 Haematologic diagnosis n (%) 0 (0%) 4 (9%) 0.148 COPD n (%) 14 (50%) 23 (53%) 0.812 Chronic lung disease (inc.
