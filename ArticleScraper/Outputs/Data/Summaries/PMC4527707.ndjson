{"summary": "the chlamydiaceae are a genus of Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause a spectrum of diseases in humans and agriculturally important animals. chlamydial infections can cause medically important conditions, such as trachoma, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. pathogen infection and sterile trauma can promote release of damage/danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from mammalian cells/tissues. DAMPs bind signaling receptors on mammalian cells and initiate specific responses that promote local inflammation and wound healing. extracellular ATP (ATPe) and adenosine (ADO) are two well studied DAMPs. ATPe may play a significant anti-chlamydial role in vivo, as well as in vitro. extracellular ADO-exposure also reduces infectious EB production by both C. trachomatis L2 and serovar D in HeLa cells. extracellular ATP is released from human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected macrophages [18] and facilitates HIV entry into new host cells [19]. therefore, we hypothesized that release of DAMPs from PEDV-infected cells may influence the C. pecorum development cycle. growth medium consisted of minimal Essential Medium (MEM) with Earle\u2019s salts, 25 mM HEPES, without L-Glutamine (GIBCO), 4 mM GlutaMAX-I (200 mM, GIBCO), 1% MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (100x, GIBCO) and 0.2 mg/ml gentamycin (50 mg/ml, GIBCO). cells were seeded sterile distilled H2O, stored at -20\u00b0C, and thawed immediately before use. erythro-9-(2-Hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine hydrochloride (EHNA, Sigma-Aldrich), adenosine-5-triphosphate disodium salt (ATP, Sigma-Aldrich), apyrase (Sigma-Aldrich), adenosine-3 crude stocks used resulted in approximate infection rates of 40% for C. pecorum and 20% for C. trachomatis. effect on Chlamydia inclusion formation of various danger associated molecular patterns, DAMPs [cAMP, ATP, ADO] and analogues. chomatis inclusions and host cells were incubated until mature inclusions could be evaluated. incubation medium was changed and cells were incubated for a further 24 hours. cells were infected with Chlamydia (C.) pecorum or C. trachomatis serovar E. for IF microscopy, cells were fixed with absolute methanol (-20\u00b0C) for 10 minutes. for TEM cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, USA) for 1 h. for titration by sub-passage infected monolayers were scraped into 1 ml of fresh infection medium and stored at -80\u00b0C. chlamydial inclusions in each of 8 randomly selected microscopic fields were counted per condition (at least 200 HeLa nuclei per condition) chlamydial inclusions were grown on glass coverslips as described above. using a leica fluorescence microscope at 200x magnification with a 206 objective (PL FLUOTAR 20x/0.50 PH 2, \u2018/0.17/B) and a 106 ocular objective (Leica L-Plan 10x/25 M, Leica Microsystems) sections were mounted on gold grids (Merck), contrasted with uranyl acetate dehydrate (Fluka; Sigma-Aldrich) and lead citrate (Merck cells and media HeLa cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in growth medium for cell propagation and maintenance. growth medium consisted of minimal Essential Medium (MEM) with Earle\u2019s salts, 25 mM HEPES, without L-Glutamine (GIBCO), 4 mM GlutaMAX-I (200 mM, GIBCO), 1% MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (100x, GIBCO reagents were solubilized in sterile distilled H2O, stored at -20\u00b0C. thawed immediately before use: adenosine (ADO, Abcam Biochemicals, Cambridge, UK), erythro-9-(2-Hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine hydrochloride (EHNA, Sigma-Aldrich), adenosine-5-triphosphate disodium salt (ATP, study design, infection and exposure of host cells to DAMPs HeLa cells were infected with either C. pecorum or C. trachomatis at 1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) after centrifugation, infection medium was replaced by incubation medium and cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the crude stocks used resulted in approximate infection rates of 40% for C. pecorum and 20% for C. trachomatis. in preliminary experiments for this study, in HeLa cells, C. pecorum inclusions and host cells begin to burst earlier than C. trachomatis inclusions and host cells. bursting of inclusions and cells was not evident: 39 h post infection (hpi) for C. trachomatis-infected cells. cells were incubated for 35 hours, fixed and labeled with anti-LPS and DAPI. inclusion size was determined (mean SD; ** p 0.0001, *p 0.01, t test; n = 50 inclusions per coverslip from a single experiment) for IF microscopy, cells were fixed with absolute methanol (-20\u00b0C) for 10 minutes. chlamydial DNA were labeled using 1 g/ml 4\u2019, 6-diamidino-2\u2019-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Molecular Probes) coverslips were mounted with a leica DMLB fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, wetzlar, Germany) under oil immersion at 1000x magnification with a 1006 objective (PL FLUOTAR 100x/1.30, OIL, \u2018/ fugation, medium replacement with incubation medium, and incubation was carried out as described for IF microscopy. the number of inclusions in 30 random microscopic fields for duplicate coverslips per condition was determined using a leica fluorescence microscope at 200x magnification with a 206 objective. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO inhibit Chlamydia inclusion development. cAMP levels quickly increase in HeLa cells after ADO stimulation. cAMP levels quickly increase in HeLa cells after ADO stimulation. exposure to cAMP reduced inclusion size in a dose dependent manner. cAMP was used at 1 mM in our subsequent experiments. this was the lowest concentration resulting in maximum inclusion size reduction to approximately 30% of control size. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO reduce mean Chlamydia inclusion size and number of bacteria per inclusion, but do not induce aberrant body formation. the addition of cAMP or ATP caused only a small, albeit statistically significant, decrease in percent of host cells infected by C. pecorum. HeLa cells were exposed to cAMP (1 mM), 8BrcAMP (1 mM), ATP (1 mM), apyrase (2.5 U), apyrase (2.5 U) followed by ATP (1 mM), ADO (50 M), EHNA (25 M), or ADO (50 M) plus EHNA (25 M) in incubation medium immediately after infection. the average C. trachomatis inclusion size was reduced to 13.8% of control with the addition of cAMP, 14.0% of control with the addition of ATP, and 20.0% of control with the addition of EHNA/ADO. exposure to DAMPs reduced the mean number of bacteria per inclusion in C. pecorum and C. trachomatis-infected HeLa cells. cells were labeled with anti-LPS (green) and DAPI (blue) for immunofluorescence microscopic analysis. cAMP, ATP, and EHNA/ADO inhibit inclusion development without inducing aberrant body formation. cells were exposed to the DAMPs cAMP (1 mM), ATP (1 mM), or ADO (50 M, plus 25 M EHNA) in incubation medium immediately after infection. total number of bacteria (EB, IB, RB, and AB) in ten inclusions per condition was determined. 1Q Fig, C. pecorum, 90 m2; S1I and S1S Fig, C. trachomatis; 375 m2) cultured in the presence of cycloheximide develop larger inclusions than do chlamydiae cultured in the absence of cycloheximide (S1E and S1R Fig, C. pecorum, 37 m2; S1M and S1T Fig, C. TEM analyses of mean relative proportions of EB, RB, IB and AB indicate that cAMP and ATP exposure significantly altered the relative proportion of bacterial developmental forms. cAMP and ATP exposure, but not EHNA/ADO exposure, significantly altered the relative proportion of bacterial developmental forms for either species of Chlamydia evaluated. ense granular material was observed in multiple inclusions of all treatment groups. a single incident of a similar material in an inclusion of C. pecorum-infected cells was observed. the effect of ATP and ADO on Chlamydia inclusion size can be modulated by apyrase and EHNA. apyrase abrogated the ATP-dependent reduction of inclusion size in both Chlamydia species. cAMP levels were found to be increased in C. trachomatis L2-infected HeLa cells. exposure to a cell-permeant analogue of cAMP, 8-Bromo-cAMP, was shown to have an inhibitory effect on inclusion formation in HeLa cells. cAMP, ATP, and EHNA/ADO reversibly reduce inclusion size and infectivity in a species-specific manner. cAMP, ATP, and EHNA/ADO reversibly reduce chlamydial inclusion size and infectivity in a species-specific manner. EHNA/ADO exposure reduced IFU/ml to less than 1% of the control in all DAMP-exposed C. trachomatis-infected cells. reduction in inclusion size ranged from only approximately 61% to 86% of control values for both species tested. C. pecorum (C) and C. trachomatis (D) were reduced to less than 1% of control IFU/ml. cAMP and ATP exposure increased C. pecorum in the absence of cycloheximide. C. trachomatis IFU/ml was reduced to less than 1% of control IFU/ml. in the presence of cycloheximide, however, C. trachomatis IFU/ml was reduced to 12.4% of control by EHNA/ADO. previous reports indicate that cAMP, ATP, or EHNA/ADO cause reversible inhibition of C. trachomatis (serotypes L2 and/or inclusions increased in size from 35 hpi to 24 hours later (59 hpi) cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO reversibly reduce inclusion size. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO reversibly reduce inclusion size. the size and visible bacterial density of inclusions increased substantially compared to similar infected cells subjected to continued DAMP exposure. however, C. pecorum-infected cells exposed to EHNA/ADO for 35 hours then allowed to recover in the absence of DAMPs for 24 hours. the density of bacteria within the inclusions increased substantially compared to similar infected cells subjected to continued DAMP exposure. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO reversibly reduce inclusion size. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO reversibly reduce inclusion size. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO were exposed to cAMP for 39 hours. at 39 hours post infection cells were fixed and labeled with anti-LPS. cells and culture supernatants were collected after 35- or 39-hour exposure to DAMPs followed by 24 hours of continued exposure or recovery. based on the microscopically observed increases in inclusion size and bacterial density upon recovery from cAMP and ATP exposure. a concomitant increase in IFU/ml was seen only in the EHNA/ADO-exposed group. this suggests that inclusions in cAMP- and ATP- exposed groups may not produce infectious EB after 24 hours of recovery. cAMP, ATP, and EHNA/ADO similarly reduce inclusion size when Chlamydia-infected cells are exposed. cells were exposed to 1 mM cAMP, 1 mM ATP, or 50 M ADO plus 25 M EHNA at 14 hpi. inclusion size was reduced by 14 hpi exposure of C. pecorum-infected cells. C. pecorum mean inclusion size was reduced to 49.8% of control with the addition of cAMP, 61.5% of control with the addition of ATP, and 70.9% of control with EHNA/ADO at 14 hpi. appearance, by IF microscopy, of C. pecorum (Fig 10C\u201310F) and C. trachomatis (Fig 10I\u201310L) in cells treated with DAMPs at 14 hpi was similar to cell-permeant and non-cell-permeant cAMP have been shown to inhibit chlamydial development. exposure to cAMP reduced inclusion size in a dose dependent manner. exposure to cAMP reduced inclusion size in a dose dependent manner. exposure to 25 M EHNA reduced inclusion size in a dose dependent manner. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO reduce mean Chlamydia inclusion size. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO reduce mean inclusion size. the addition of cAMP or ATP caused only a small, albeit statistically significant, decrease in percent of host cells infected by C. pecorum. the percent of C. pecorum-infected cells was reduced to 34.4% by cAMP (p = 0.0016) and to 35.2% by ATP (p = 0.0362) compared to the control infection of 39.6%. inclusion size was determined for C. pecorum (A) and C. trachomatis (B) (mean SD; *p 0.05, t test; n = 3) exposure to 1 mM cAMP or ATP reduced mean inclusion size. mean bacteria per C. pecorum inclusion was reduced to 19.1% of control with the addition of cAMP, 16.9% of control with the addition of ATP, and 64% of control with the addition of EHNA/ADO. the reduction caused by EHNA/ADO failed to reach statistical significance. cells were infected with C. trachomatis serovar E and exposed to the DAMPs cAMP (1 mM), ATP (1 mM), or ADO (50 M, plus 25 M EHNA) in incubation medium immediately after infection. cells were labeled with anti-LPS (green) and DAPI (blue) for immunofluorescence microscopic analysis. C. trachomatis-infected cells (C) shows EB (dark, 0.25\u20130.5 m), IB (dark center and pale periphery), RB (pale, 0.5\u20131 m) and AB (pale, 2 m) Cycloheximide was included in the incubation medium for experiments presented in Figs 2\u20136, limiting host cell de novo protein synthesis. mean C. pecorum inclusion size was reduced, by all DAMPs evaluated, to less than 25% of control inclusion size in the presence of cycloheximide (S1A\u2013S1D and S1Q Fig) but to less than 65% of control inclusion size in the absence of cycloheximide (S1E\u2013S1H and S1R Fig) effect was seen for C. pecorum IB, which showed a reduced proportion of 2% and 1% upon cAMP and ATP exposure. this was accompanied by a cAMP- and ATP-dependent increase in the proportion of C. pecorum RB to 92% and 97% respectively, compared to the control proportion of 84%. apyrase abrogated the ATP-dependent reduction of inclusion size in both Chlamydia species. exposure to apyrase reduced inclusion size compared to mock treated controls. apyrase abrogated the ATP-dependent reduction of inclusion size. cAMP levels were found to be increased in C. trachomatis L2-infected HeLa cells. exposure to a cell-permeant analogue of cAMP, 8-Bromo-cAMP (8BrcAMP), was shown to have an inhibitory effect on C. trachomatis L2 inclusion formation in HeLa cells. this was in contrast to a previous report that indicated exposure to cAMP, but not 8BrcAMP, reduced inclusion size in cAMP, ATP, and EHNA/ADO reversibly reduce inclusion size and infectivity in a species-specific manner. infected and exposed cells were collected and subjected to freeze/thaw and sonication to lyse cells and release EB. inclusion forming units (IFU) per ml were determined based on reduction in inclusion size. chlamydial cells were exposed to cAMP (1 mM), ATP (1 mM), or ADO (50 M, plus 25 M EHNA) infected monolayers were then collected and processed for titration by sub-passage. number of inclusions was determined and inclusion forming units (IFU) per ml was calculated for C. pecorum (A) and C. trachomatis (B) heximide supplementation of the incubation medium, processed to determine infectious EB production, presented as IFU/ml (S4 Fig) reduction, and even reversal, of the DAMP-dependent reductive effect on inclusions size noted in the absence of cycloheximide versus the presence of cycloheximide. NA/ADO cause reversible inhibition of C. trachomatis inclusion development in HeLa cells. ATP-induced inhibition of Chlamydia (C.) muridarum or C. psittaci inclusion development in macrophages has not been described as reversible. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO reversibly reduce inclusion size. cells were infected with C. pecorum (A-L) and exposed to cAMP (1 mM; D-F), ATP (1 mM; G-I) or ADO (50 M, plus 25 M EHNA; J-L) at 35 hours post infection cells were fixed and labeled with anti-LPS and DAPI. in mock-exposed cells, less marked cell loss from the monolayer was observed upon 24 hours of additional culture after 39 hpi. however, burst cells and cell fragments adherent to the host cell monolayer surface were visible on all areas of the coverslip. inclusions increased in size between 39 hpi and 24 hours later. cells were infected with C. trachomatis serovar E (A-L) and exposed to cAMP (1 mM; D-F), ATP (1 mM; G-I); or ADO (50 M, plus 25 M EHNA; J-L) at 39 hours post infection cells were fixed and labeled with anti-LPS and DAPI. images represent one experiment of two independently repeated experiments with similar results. the collected cell culture supernatant was combined with collected cells for each sample. a concomitant increase in IFU/ml was seen only in the EHNA/ADO-exposed group. the inclusions in cAMP- and ATP- exposed groups may not produce infectious EB after 24 hours of recovery. cAMP, ATP, and EHNA/ADO reduce inclusion size when exposed at 14 hpi versus 0 hpi. PEDV-dependent induction of these effects occurred upon exposure of Chlamydia-infected host cells. inclusion size was determined for C. pecorum (B) and C. trachomatis (H) (mean SD; *p 0.05, t test; n = 3) representative images are shown for C. pecorum-infected mock- (C), cAMP- (D), ATP- (E), and EHNA/ADO-exposed (F) cells. exposure of C. pecorum-infected (Fig 10A) and C. tracho exposure at 14 hpi did not result in host cell loss from the monolayer. cyclic AMP, which posses extracellular signaling capabilities, inhibit inclusion development in vitro in absence of de novo host cell protein synthesis. host cell species determine a difference in AB formation, with AB formation associated with human host cell lines. notably, C. trachomatis serotype E failed to recover infectious EB production within 24 hours after discontinuation of cAMP or ATP exposure. further evaluation of possible recovery over extended periods may reveal whether C. trachomatis serotype E is incapable of recovery from cAMP or ATP exposure. pecorum showed cAMP- and ATP-dependent increases in infectious EB production. the effect was reversed for C. trachomatis upon ATP exposure. cycloheximide was also observed in the presence of cycloheximide. persistence/chlamydial stress may influence AB production. however, chlamydial inclusions added at 14 hpi, compared to 0 hpi. this indicates that the inducer of aberrant inclusions is responsible for the disparate appearance of aberrant inclusions. the mechanisms for virus co-infection-induced persistence/chlamydial stress were demonstrated to be imbalanced oxidative stress in the case of human herpes virus 6 [5] the involvement of these modes of action has not yet been investigated in the context of DAMP-induced persistence/chlamydial stress. the involvement of these modes of action has not yet been investigated in the context of DAMP-induced persistence/chlamydial stress. extracellular adenosine-dependent induction of chlamydial persistence/stress was shown to act via phospholipase D activation. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-independent, the authors noted that both cell-permeant and non-permeant cAMP exerted a similar effect as adenosine. cycloheximide was included in the incubation medium and remained on the cells C. pecorum exhibited an increase in the proportion of RB, and a concomitant decrease in the proportion of EB, upon exposure to cAMP or ATP. in contrast, C. trachomatis exhibited the opposite effect: a decrease in the proportion of RB, and a concomitant decrease in the proportion of EB, upon cAMP or ATP exposure. cycloheximide abrogates the morphological effects of ATP-induced apoptosis. previous studies have indicated cycloheximide abrogates the morphological effects of ATP-induced apoptosis. chlamydia-infected cells are protected against induced apoptosis. cAMP and 8BrCAMP are acting via a shared or distinct mechanism. exposure of C. pecorum-infected cells to apyrase alone increased inclusion size. this suggests that apyrase reduces levels of endogenous ATP. chlamydiae does not correlate well with inclusion size or mean bacteria per inclusion. cAMP- and ATP-dependent reduction of infectious EB release appears to depend on inhibited host cell protein synthesis. recovery appears to depend upon the re-entry of chlamydiae into the normal developmental cycle. the two groups that did not recover within 24 hours of discontinuation of DAMP-exposure showed a reduction in mean bacteria per inclusion of at least 94%. cAMP and ATP modulate the proportion of chlamydial developmental forms within inclusions. cells were infected with C. pecorum or C. trachomatis serovar E. they were exposed to the DAMPs cAMP (1 mM), ATP (1 mM), or ADO (50 M, plus 25 M EHNA) in incubation medium. number of bacteria (EB, RB, IB, and AB) in ten inclusions per condition was counted. mean proportion of developmental forms for the 10 inclusions per experimental group was calculated. cAMP, ATP and EHNA/ADO do not cause host cell loss. cells were exposed to the DAMPs cAMP (1 mM), ATP (1 mM), or ADO (50 M, plus 25 M EHNA) in incubation medium. cells were incubated for 35 hours (C. pecorum) or 39 hours (C. trachomatis serovar E)"}
