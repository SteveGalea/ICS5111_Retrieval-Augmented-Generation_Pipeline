{"summary": "the respiratory viruses detected using a multiplex real-time-polymerase chain reaction kit were influenza virus (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1, and B), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (type 1, 2, 3), respiratory syncytial virus (type A, B), human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and enterovirus. a nationwide survey was carried out to identify the incidence of KD in south Korea concerning acute KD patients who were hospitalized between January 2009 and December 2011. the incidence of KD per month was tallied from January 2009 to December 2011. the viruses detected were influenza virus (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1, and B), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (type 1, 2, and 3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV type A, B), human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, human bocavirus, and enterovirus. way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-sample t-test was used to examine the significant differences in mean KD incidence or viral infection between seasons or months. seasons were considered by four groups based on the month: spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, August), autumn (September, October, November), and winter (December, January, February, February, 2011). in most other months, fewer than 30 cases of influenza virus were detected. the most common virus detected was human rhinovirus (4648 cases, 32.6%), followed by influenza virus (3827 cases, 26.8%). the parainfluenza virus was detected the least during this period (382 cases, 2.7%). monthly occurrence of Kawasaki disease and total viral detection rates show strong positive correlation (r=0.382, p=0.022) bocavirus and enterovirus show significant correlation with monthly patterns of Kawasaki disease occurrence. virus was epidemic in the spring of 2010 (March: 275 cases, April: 990 cases, May: 193 cases), December 2010 (936 cases), and January 2011 (752 cases), the viral detection rate was the highest in December, April, and January (Fig. 2). there are 2 definite peaks of viral detection in April and December 2010 due to influenza virus epidemics. the scatterplot between monthly occurrence of Kawasaki disease and total viral detection rates shows a strong positive correlation (r=0.382, p=0.022) several studies have shown that human bocavirus may play a pathogenic role in the development of KD. the association with enterovirus such as coxsackie virus and KD occurrence also has been suggested from several case series. there is no explanation for the discrepancy between the high incidence of KD and the low viral detection during the summer season. a subsequent is underway that will attempt to find a causative airborne pathogen for KD by filtering the air over Japan at various altitudes."}
