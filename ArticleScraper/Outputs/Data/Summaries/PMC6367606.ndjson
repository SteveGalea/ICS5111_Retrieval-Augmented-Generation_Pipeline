{"summary": "malaria, arbovirus infection, and travelers\u2019 diarrhea are among the most common etiologies of fever after a stay in the tropics. the initial clinical presentation for all these diseases is frequently unspecific and might include fever, arthralgia, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. travelers\u2019 diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms after a stay in a tropical or subtropical area can be caused by bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. laboratory indicators vary depending on the microbiological agent and its virulence. the study was conducted at the hospital clinic i Provincial de Barcelona. the diagnosis of malaria was defined by the presence of Plasmodium trophozoites in the thick and thin blood smears. a rapid diagnostic test was performed in some cases depending on the last visited country. a commercial nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers for Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale was performed. isolated bacteria were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. an in-house multiplex PCR15,17 was used for detection of virulence genes of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli targeted to CVD432 probe of enteroaggregative E. coli. the detection of rotavirus and adenovirus was performed with a rapid immunochromatographic test. the different diagnostic techniques were performed based on diagnostic suspicion and clinical criteria. there was no clinical request for Norovirus detection in the group of patients included in the study. date of analysis, last visited country, identified Plasmodium species, and parasite density were collected for each episode and patient. platelet and leukocyte counts at the beginning of each malaria-suspected episode (3 days difference from the date of performance of the first thick and thin blood smear) were collected retrospectively. the molecular diagnosis of chikungunya and Zika was established with the detection of viral, bacterial, or parasitic pathogens in a stool sample collected during the same episode as the thick blood smear. the isolated bacteria were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. PCR products were visualized in a 2% agarose gel. parasitic pathogens were detected by direct microscopic observation. the detection of rotavirus and adenovirus was performed. the most commonly visited area was sub-Saharan Africa (47.5%), followed by Southern Asia/Pacific (31.3%), Latin America (19.5%), and North Africa/Middle East (1.6%). the single country with most malaria cases was Equatorial Guinea. travelers presenting with acute febrile illness with suspected diagnosis of malaria Aetiology Number (%) N % Unknown 979 (80.4)* Arbovirus 68 (5.6)* Dengue 50 73.5 Chikungunya 12 17.7 Zika 6 8.8 Malaria 102 (8.4)* Plasmodium falciparum 86 84.3 Plasmodium vivax 9 8.8 Plasmodium ovale 4 3.9 Plasmodium malariae 2 2.0 Plasmod the most common species was P. falciparum, followed by P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. the median parasitemia was 0.6% (IQR: 0.05\u20133.6) platelet and leukocyte counts were significantly lower (P 0.001) in patients with and without malaria compared with patients without malaria. there was a higher tendency toward thrombocytopenia in episodes caused by P. falciparum than for the other Plasmodium species. three patients were travelers of sub-Saharan africa origin living in a nonendemic area. five patients had undergone previous episodes of malaria in previous travels to endemic areas. one patient was already under treatment when the platelet count was performed, and one patient was splenectomized. median platelet counts for patients with dengue, chikungunya, and Zika were 2.68, 3.24, and 3.55 (109/L), respectively. leukocyte levels were significantly lower in episodes caused by dengue (P = 0.002 and P = 0.004) compared with episodes caused by chikungunya. sub-saharan africa was the origin of 93% of patients diagnosed with P. falciparum malaria and all patients diagnosed with P. ovale malaria. patients with arbovirus infection were mostly diagnosed after a stay in southern Asia/Pacific (55.6%) and Latin America (44.4%).
