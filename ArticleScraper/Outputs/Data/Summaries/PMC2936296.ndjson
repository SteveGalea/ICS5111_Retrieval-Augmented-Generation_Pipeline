{"summary": "innate immune response is the first line of defence against invading pathogens. innate immune response is regulated by complex signalling and transcriptional networks. innate immune system is traditionally divided into two different branches. innate immunity is fast-acting by comparison to adaptive response. despite lack of antigen specificity present in adaptive immunity, components of the innate immune system can still distinguish between a broad range of pathogens and mount an appropriate response. over the last three years, we have developed innateDB, a database of the molecular interactions and pathways involved in innate immunity. innate immunity does not involve simple linear pathways, but rather complex networks of molecular interactions and transcriptional responses [14]. a key component of the InnateDB project is the contextual manual curation of innate immunity interactions, pathways and their component molecules. several large-scale efforts to identify possible molecular interactions are well under way in several species [16-19], including human [20]. many of these projects are focused on protein-protein interactions and rely heavily on yeast two-hybrid approaches. such approaches do not provide detailed contextual insight into which interactions occur under particular conditions or in which cell-types. intAct, DIP, MINT and BioGRID have active literature curation efforts. IMEx aims to synchronise curation efforts to avoid redundancy. innateDB is now an observer member of this consortium. the innateDB project has had a full-time curation team employed for more than three years. as of february 15th 2010, there were 11,786 InnateDB-curated molecular interactions in InnateDB. 117,066 (mostly non-overlapping) interactions integrated from other databases. several large-scale efforts to identify possible molecular interactions are well under way in several species [16-19], including human [20]. many of these projects, for example, are focused on protein-protein interactions and rely heavily on yeast two-hybrid approaches, which can be associated with high false positive and false negative rates. intAct, DIP, MINT and BioGRID have active literature curation efforts. IMEx aims to synchronise curation efforts to avoid redundancy. the innateDB project has had a full-time curation team employed for more than three years. as of february 15, there were 11,786 InnateDB-curated molecular interactions in InnateDB. 117,066 (mostly non-overlapping) interactions integrated from other databases. this integration provides broad coverage of the entire human and mouse interactions. the KEGG pathway database [29] depicts RIG-I signalling in a clear linear fashion that would be recognisable to most biologists. if we use InnateDB to construct a network of all possible interactions between components of this pathway, one can clearly see the potential for huge complexity in the signalling response. the top 50 hubs in the innateDB-curated human innate immunity interactome were identified by using the \"Degree\" algorithm (Table 1). the hub nodes were highly enriched for proteins involved in the TLR and NFB signalling pathways. 000142208 207 81 * NFKB1 IDBG-31974 ENSG00000109320 4790 75 * IKBKB IDBG-19987 ENSG00000104365 3551 71 * EP300 IDBG-8992 ENSG00000100393 2033 70 * CHUK IDBG-243385 ENSG00000213341 1147 65 * IRAK1 IDBG-90782 ENSG00000184216 3654 55 * MAPK1 IDBG-90782 MAPK8 IDBG-73479 ENSG00000107643 5599 40 * MTOR IDBG-89258 ENSG00000198793 2475 40 * IL8 IDBG-23954 ENSG00000000064012 841 38 * IRF7 IDBG-17225 ENSG00000185507 3665 38 JUN IDBG-99221 ENSG00000177606 3725 38 * MAPK14 IDBG-84613 ENSG00000112062 1432 bottlenecks are network nodes that are key connector proteins in a network. the majority of hub proteins were identified amongst the top 50 bottlenecks. innate immunity pathways are statistically over-represented in this dataset. links between innate immunity and innate immunity are also becoming apparent. ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and endocytosis in innate immunity are well known. neurotrophins are a family of proteins involved in neural cell differentiation and survival and may be involved in Alzheimer's disease. interferon regulatory factor, IRF8, is also over-represented. other transcription factors over-represented include CREB1, CEBPB, AP1 and STAT1. a key link between the UPR and innate immunity in C. elegans has recently been demonstrated. curation is primarily carried out in a pathway-centric way, whereby curators systematically review all of the available literature describing interactions that involve members of a particular innate immunity pathway. interactions are curated between molecules in the pathway and all other interactors regardless of whether the interacting molecule is a member of the pathway or has any known role in innate immunity. new publications on innate immunity are also assessed daily to identify novel interactions of interest. the curation team develops considerable expertise in assessing the relevant publications and in-depth knowledge of the field. Submitted interactions are stored in a MySQL database and are migrated to the public database tables on a weekly basis. the system has been designed to minimise the amount of free-text information that needs to be entered by the curator. only 4 free-text fields of the 20+ fields are used to curate an interaction. ebral launched from InnateDB, complexes are displayed as separate nodes. such edges are labelled 'X is part of complex Y' each interaction participant is linked to InnateDB via a unique, stable, InnateDB molecule ID. more than 3,000 journal articles have been curated by InnateDB curators. more than 70% of curated articles have come from 20 journals. most of curated articles have been published in the last decade. curated interactions in InnateDB are annotated in a wide range of cell and tissue types. the majority of these interactions stem from studies involving cell lines (87%) rather than primary cells. macrophages represent the most prevalent cell-type, although less than 200 interactions have been recorded. more than 500 genes have been annotated for use in innateDB. this is not intended for InnateDB to comprehensively annotate all of the roles of a given gene. the limited overlap between databases is intentional. innateDB aims to accurately represent data on interactions presented in literature. the curation team avoids subjective calls on the quality of the evidence supporting an interaction unless that evidence is clearly insufficient to support the claims in the publication. network of all InnateDB annotated molecular interactions between components of the RIG-I pathway reveals the potential for cross-talk. the top 50 hubs (i.e. highly connected nodes) in this network were identified by using the \"Degree\" algorithm. a number of IRF and STAT transcription factors were identified as hubs. there were also a number of hub proteins that do not have known roles in innate immunity. these provide potentially new regulators of innate immunity that warrant further investigation.

Molecular interactions for each pathway member are systematically curated, although priority is given to publications and experiments that are not already described in InnateDB (or the other integrated databases) innatedb.com/dashboard is a novel web-based platform that has been designed as part of the curation project to allow the submission of detailed contextual annotation on each interaction to the database. the system is implemented using the open-source framework CakePHP (http://cakephp.org) -text field is the full name for the interaction for which we have established a standard format. the abstract for this PMID is automatically retrieved from NCBI and displayed. the curator must then confirm that this is the correct abstract before the PMID will be entered. innateDB provides extensive cross-references to other major databases. the most common interaction type among curated interactions is \"physical association\" the most common interaction type among curated interactions is \"physical association\" more than 3,000 journal articles have been curated by InnateDB curators. at least one article has been curated from >200 different journals. more than 70% of curated articles have come from 20 journals. interaction evidence - interaction Detection Methods Curated interactions in InnateDB are supported by a broad range of interactions detection methods. the most abundant detection method, however, is coimmunoprecipitation which accounts for nearly half of all evidence. the innateDB curation team has begun to annotate which genes have a role in the innate immune response. the IMEx consortium has pointed out that the low overlap between databases is intentional. the limited overlap between databases is intentional, avoids redundancy and reflects the database's focus on innate immunity. the curation team avoids subjective calls on the quality of the evidence supporting an interaction unless that evidence is clearly insufficient to support the claims in the publication. many publications describing molecular interactions do not clarify whether they are referring to a human or to a mouse gene/protein. databases such as innateDB must distinguish between human and mouse molecules. in many cases, direct correspondence with the authors is the only option available to the curators to verify such information. innateDB curation of innate immunity relevant interactions, pathways and genes provides the most comprehensive picture yet of the innate immune interactome. the process of experimentally verifying molecular interactions can offer many challenges in completing full MIMIx-compliant molecular interactions. the absence of key information from publications often impedes the curation process, reducing the annotation available to accurately portray a molecular interaction. the incorrect identification of the source organism of a participant molecule was recently reported as a common error in many external interaction databases. the curation system displays all synonyms, full-names and other details for a curator to view when annotating a participant molecule. this approach highlights cases where there are two or more genes with similar/same names, allowing curators to review carefully which gene they are referring to. other challenges to curation include evolving standards. the innate immune interactome is regulated by pathogens.
