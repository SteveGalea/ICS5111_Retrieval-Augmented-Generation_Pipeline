{"summary": "type I interferons (IFN-I) are an extensive family of pleiotropic cytokines that all signal through the ubiquitously expressed IFN-I receptor. the activity of these cytokines was discovered in the 1950s because of their ability to \u2018interfere\u2019 with viral infection (2). many of the IFN-I-specific genes have defined antiviral functions. the role of many remains unresolved. this review will focus on the role of IFN-I during murine infection with viral and bacterial pathogens. the absence of systemic IFNAR signaling by the mouse led to an increase in viral titer, lethality, or both compared with controls. the two exceptions to the strict requirement for IFNAR are influenza and dengue virus infections. in dengue, IFN-mediated protection is dominant over IFN-I, although the combined IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 IFNGR\u2013/\u2013 mice are more susceptible than the IFNGR\u2013/\u2013 mice (12). the effects of IFN-I that limit viral infection are extensive. several aspects are important to consider. the importance of host IFN-I signaling is further reinforced by viral evolution. a long-standing finding in the LCMV field is that small genetic changes can convert an acutely infective strain of LCMV into a chronically infective strain. some factors have been implicated in the suppression of T-cell-mediated clearance of chronic LCMV. the absence of IFN-I signaling allows for an increased viral titer. wild-type mice control the primary infection well but become chronic carriers. the Cl13 strain induces higher levels of IFN- and IFN- than the acutely infective Armstrong strain (37). IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 mice are more resistant to L. monocytogenes given systemically. a recent report has shown that during oral infection with Listeria, IFNAR signaling may be protective. Streptococcus pneumoniae i.c + + (49) + or \u2013 indicates increased or decreased bacterial titer or lethality. type I IFN signaling provides increased protection during Streptoccocus infection by promoting upregulation of TNF-, IFN- and nitric oxide. fected IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 mice have higher titers, but the mechanism of IFN-I action in this infection remains unresolved. further work needs to be done on the extracellular bacterial infections. first example of the detrimental effect of IFN-I during bacterial infection was discovered following L. monocytogenes infection. it remains the best examined system, yielding information on mechanisms of IFN-I induction, cellular sources and targets of IFN-I. dinucleotides has been identified as the helicase DDX41. it recruits STING, TBK1 and IRF3 to drive upregulation of IFN-I genes. spleen macrophages produce IFN-I following L. monocytogenes infection in vivo (61, 62) the most profound IFNAR-dependent effect seen in mice infected with L. monocytogenes is the extensive depletion of white-pulp lymphocytes via apoptotic cell death. treatment of T cells with IFN- sensitizes them to LLO-induced apoptosis suggesting secreted LLO may be a killer molecule in vivo. the reduction in lymphocyte death seen following L. monocytogenes infection is the major reason that IFNAR\u2013/\u2013 mice are more resistant to infection (67). aaron miller: mice deficient in lymphocytes (SCID/RAG mice) are highly resistant to L. monocytogenes infection (68, 69). miller: induction of IFN-I using poly(I:C) increases the susceptibility to infection of wild-type but not SCID mice (69, 44 LLO is important for the bacterial egress from the nascent phagosome to the cytosol (57), suggesting that the presence of cytosolic bacteria is the driver of IFN-I production. cyclic dinucleotide c-di-AMP is actively exported from the bacteria and the induced expression of a c-di-AMP synthesizing enzyme increases Ifnb1 gene expression by infected macrophages. there is no clear demonstration that a splenic macrophage population is producing IFN-I in vivo. the work that identified IFN-I production by splenic macrophages did not evaluate the infected status of the cells. apoptotic cell death of macrophages is enhanced by IFNAR signaling. in wild-type mice, apoptosis begins in the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (T-cell area) removal of IFNAR significantly limits the number of apoptotic profiles and the extent of apoptotic death in any given white pulp. treatment of T cells with IFN- sensitize them to LLO-induced apoptosis suggesting secreted LLO may be a killer molecule in vivo (42). the work on IFNAR effects on L. monocytogenes infection was conducted on three different genetic backgrounds with different susceptibilities to infection. the work on IFNAR effects on L. monocytogenes infection was conducted on three different genetic backgrounds with different susceptibilities to infection. infection with herpesvirus induces prolonged IFN- production. this leads to protection against infection with L. monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis. this reinforces the need to understand the molecular effects of these cytokines during bacterial infection."}
