{"summary": "the expression of eIF3f in gastric cancer (GC) is not well understood to date. eIF3f levels were significantly higher in ANCT tissues than in GC. eIF3f levels were correlated with more advanced tumor stages. the eukaryotic initiation factor 3f (eIF3f) is the p47 subunit of the multi-subunit eIF3 complex and plays an important role in translation initiation. the role of eIF3f in the complex has not been defined [12-14], shut-off experiments in Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that in a long-term period, eIF3f was essential for viability. 195 cases of GC patients had undergone curative surgery. the mean age of the patients was 62 years (range, 31\u201390 years) the median follow-up period was 38 months (range: 3\u201354 months) sections were washed 3 3 min with PBS, followed by the addition of diaminobenzidine as a chromogen for 3 to 5 min. antibodies were optimized using a positive control tissue according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. each slide was scored in a blinded fashion by two pathologists. 0 or 1+ were designated as low expression and 2+ or 3+ were designated as high expression. statistical analysis Differences were analyzed using a Student\u2019s t-test for continuous variables and a 2 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test for proportions. the sections were washed 3 3 min with PBS, followed by the addition of diaminobenzidine as a chromogen for 3 to 5 min, which was strictly controlled under a microscope. each slide was scored in a blinded fashion by two pathologists according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended criteria. intensity scores of 0 or 1+ were designated as low expression. eIF3f expression in gastric cancer and ANCT Immunohistochemical staining showed a cytoplasm staining pattern in both GC and ANCT tissues. eIF3f was localized in the cytoplasm at different levels and percentages. eIF3f was localized in the cytoplasm at different levels and percentages. correlation between eIF3f expression and clinicopathological features in GC was also assessed. eIF3f expression was an independent predictor for the overall survival of GC patients. eIF3f expression was a significant prognostic factor for better survival of GC patients. eIF3f expression was an independent predictor for the overall survival of patients with GC. median progression-free survival was 42.5 months in patients with high eIF3f expression, compared to 33 months in patients with low eIF3f expression. eIF3f expression in gastric cancer and ANCT Immunohistochemical staining for eIF3f showed a cytoplasm staining pattern in both GC and ANCT. the rate of high eIF3f expression in GC and ANCT tissues was 33.8% (66/195) and 59.5% (116/195) respectively. eIF3f was localized in the cytoplasm at different levels and percentages. correlation between eIF3f expression and clinicopathological features. eIF3f-high (n = 66) eIF3f-low (n = 129) P Gender Male 142 49 93 0.87 Female 53 17 36 Age (y) 60 84 33 51 0.17 60 111 33 78 Tumor differentiation Well 12 8 4 0.46 Moderate 27 4 23 Poor 156 54 102 Tumor size (cm) 4.5 114 34 80 0.16 4.5 81 32 49 TNM stage I\u2013II 136 53 83 0.02 III GC patients with tumor size 4.5 cm had significantly shorter overall survival (P = 0.03) than those 4.5 cm. median progression-free survival was 42.5 months in patients with high eIF3f expression, compared to 33 months in patients with low eIF3f expression. eIF3f is another eIF3 subunit whose function is not well-known. previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of eIF3f inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells. there is no large sample report about the expression and clinical significance of eIF3f in human GC progression and prognosis. eIF3f may play an important role in the progression and recurrence of GC. however, specific regulatory mechanisms remain to be further studied. authors declare that they have no competing interest."}
