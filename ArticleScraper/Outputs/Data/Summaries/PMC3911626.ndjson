{"summary": "upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are present in 40% of eukaryotic mRNAs (1, 2) and are found in the mRNAs of many viruses that infect eukaryotes (3\u20136) the function of the uORF is not known in a majority of cases, but in many mRNAs, it has been shown to cause repression of translation of the downstream (main) ORF. arteriviruses and coronaviruses are presumed to use 5\u2032-cap-dependent, 5\u2032-terminal 40S ribosomal entry with subsequent ribosomal scanning for translation of the genome. strand molecules that are 5\u2032 capped and 3\u2032 polyadenylated undergo replication via a full-length minus-strand (antigenome) intermediate in the cytoplasm. in arteriviruses, the uORF maps within the leader, whereas in coronaviruses, the uORF maps just downstream of the genomic leader. the uORF is found on the genome and on each sgmRNA in arteriviruses, whereas in coronaviruses, the uORF is found only on the genome. tides 140 through 170 form a long-range RNA-RNA interaction with downstream nt 332 through 363. the underlined heptameric sequence UCUAAAC in stem-loop 3 at the 3\u2032 terminus of the leader is the core RdRp template-switching signal that directs leader acquisition on MHV sgmRNAs. boxes identify the uORF start codon (nt 99), the genomic ORF1 start codon TA98TGCTACGCATGCACAATT116AGA119TGTGTATTT128GA...TGCACAA297TGT...

M6 made WT-like plaques and had WT-like growth kinetics. uORF has the effect of repressing translation from ORF1 in vitro in RRL. mutants with deletions of 20 nt (M96\u2013115) and 30 nt (M91\u2013120) had a reselected uORF after 10 passages. only mutants with deletions of 20 nt (M96\u2013115) and 30 nt (M91\u2013120) had a reselected uORF after 10 passages. two largest deletions, 30 nt (M91\u2013120) and 51 nt (M80\u2013130), showed dramatically reduced RNA production. a precise deletion of stem-loop 4 is not lethal or restrictive of sgmRNA synthesis. a similar insertion was found between nt 57 and 58 at virus passage 10. in mutant virus M96\u2013115, the C80U transition causing a new uAUG in virus passage 10 is identified with a. a 4-nt insertion, AUCU, occurs between nt 57 and 58 by virus passage 10. this insertion creates a new UCUAA element, a spontaneous phenomenon previously described for the MHV genome near this site. an analysis of sequenced coronavirus genomes available in GenBank showed that a uORF is present usually in a suboptimal Kozak context in >75% of species. in the betacoronavirus subgroup, these include bovine coronavirus (BCoV), the highly studied MHV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (41).

this study) a uORF was reselected within 10 virus passages for each of three methods used to disrupt the uORF. a genomic AUG-initiated uORF is not found in some coronaviruses. this includes bat coronavirus HKU9, a group D betacoronavirus; beluga whale coronavirus SW1, a gammacoronavirus. s were sought by inspection of coronavirus genomes. one or more potential uORFs can be found in almost all coronaviruses. only in the deltacoronaviruses are the CUG codons in a good enough Kozak context for likely use. in vitro translation analysis showed that the presence of the novel uORF correlated with repression of sgmRNA7 translation (58). in a second example, an A77G mutation in MHV was found only in the genomic 5\u2032 UTR arising during persistent infection in cultured cells that led to a 24-nt 5\u2032-ward extension of the natural uORF (59). translation of the viral mRNAs is favored over cellular mRNAs in part by an endonucleoproteolytic property of viral nsp1. uORF translation enhances shunting in cellular mRNA cIAP2 (9), in prototype foamy virus genomic RNA (11) and in rice tungro virus (4), in a way that allows the mRNA or viral RNA to escape translation inhibition."}
