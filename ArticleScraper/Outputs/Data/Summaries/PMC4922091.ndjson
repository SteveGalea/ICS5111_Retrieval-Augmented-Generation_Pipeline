{"summary": "mixed infections with two or more respiratory pathogens are common in children. rapid and accurate laboratory diagnostic tests are necessary to identify the causative agents. commercial multiplex real-time PCR assays have been launched for rapid diagnosis of multiple respiratory pathogens. the xTAG-RPP assay includes a single-tube reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and DNA hybridization assay. the previous RVPv2 assay has a two-tube step for RT-PCR and DNA hybridization. the new Luminex system included all the viral respiratory targets in the RVPv2 and 3 atypical respiratory bacterial targets. bioFire FA-RP assay version 1.7 detects nucleic acids of 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacteria, including adenovirus, HCoV (OC43, NL63, 229E, HKU1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hMPV, influenza A virus (H1/2009, H1 and H3), influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV type 1 [PIV1] to PIV4), Bordetella pert thirty-five microliters of extracted nucleic acid were added to the preplated bead reagents to resuspend the reaction reagents. RT-PCR was then performed according to the NxTAG-RPP IVD assay product insert instructions. at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 50 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 55\u00b0C for 30 s in the Roche LightCycler 96 real-time PCR system. each batch of run included one synthetic template control and one no-template control for each target. the results were compared with the in-house real-time PCR results. agreement between the FA-RP and NxTAG-RPP systems was determined by Kappa statistics with SPSS Statistics software version 22.0. NP swabs were suspended in viral transport medium and tested using both the BioFire FA-RP and Luminex NxTAG-RPP. the extraction, amplification, and detection steps take place in separate chambers of a self-contained, single-use pouch. the procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. the Luminex NxTAG-RPP assay is a CE-IVD high-throughput multiplex system. 15 first amplification cycles at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 65\u00b0C for 60 s, and 72\u00b0C for 10 s. 24 nested amplification cycles at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 58\u00b0C for 60 s, and 72\u00b0C for 10 s. hybridization step at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. the FA-RP and in-house real-time PCR were considered the reference standard method in this study. for adenovirus, HCoV, RSV, hMPV, influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses, PIV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae, direct comparisons were made. all pathogen targets except influenza virus A/H1, B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila were detected among the specimens. all pathogen targets except influenza virus A/H1, B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, and HBoV were detected among the clinical specimens. 6 98.0\u2013100 88.9 51.8\u201399.7 100 98.7\u2013100 Enterovirus/rhinovirus 71 6 1 206 98.6 92.5\u2013100 97.2 94.0\u201399.0 92.2 83.8\u201397.1 99.5 97.3\u2013100 Influenza A virus 49 0 0 235 100 92.8\u2013100 100 98.4\u2013100 100 92.8\u2013100 100 98.4\u2013100 A/H1pdm09 virus 14 0 1 98.5\u2013100 M. pneumoniae 5 0 0 279 100 47.8\u2013100 100 98.8\u2013100 98.8 96.6\u201399.8 91.2 76.3\u201398.1 100 98.5\u2013100 Total 354 50 4 4704 98.9 97.2\u201399.7 99.0 98.6\u201399.2 87.6 84.0\u201390.7 99.9 99.8\u2013100 a RM, reference standard method. agreement between the two assays was observed in 98.8% of positive targets (318/322; kappa = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.94). the other 7 targets (HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, hMPV, PIV2, and PIV4) were demonstrated to have substantial agreement (kappa = 0.61 to 0.80) 212 0.94 (0.89\u20130.98) Influenza A virus 49 235 49 235 1.00 (1.00\u20131.00) A/H1pdm09 14 270 15 269 0.96 (0.90\u20131.00) A/H3 35 249 34 250 0.98 (0.95\u20131.00) influenza B virus 20 264 20 264 1.00 (1.00\u20131.00) hMPV 21 263 10 264 0.63 (0.43\u20130.83) PIV1 7 277 7 277 3 + enterovirus/rhinovirus + adenovirus PIV3 + enterovirus/rhinovirus 1 PIV3 + HBoVa Negative 1 PIV3 + RSV + enterovirus/rhinovirus 1 PIV3 + HBoVa RSV 1 PIV4 + enterovirus/rhinovirus + RSV PIV4 1 PIV4 + enterovirus/rhinovirus Enterovirus/rhinovirus 2 RSV + enter the system demonstrated 100% sensitivity for adenovirus, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, influenza A virus, A/H1pdm09 virus, A/H3 virus, influenza B virus, metapneumovirus, PIV1 to PIV4, RSV, HBoV, and M. pneumoniae.
