{"summary": "mucosal vaccination is believed to be more effective than parenteral vaccination at inducing mucosal immunity. majority of vaccines are parentally delivered due to lack of robust mucosal vaccine platforms. lactobacilli are regarded as safe by the fda and thus have a significant advantage over pathogen-based platforms. lactobacilli have also been shown to activate the caspase-1 dependent inflammasome, resulting in the production of active IL-1 [7, 17]. to optimize a vaccine platform, we investigated the immunomodulatory capabilities of L. gasseri, L. acidophilus, and NCFM mutant strains. nod2-/- mice on the BALB/c background were generously gifted by Dr. Holly Rosenzweig (Oregon Health & Science University), bred at CSU. animals were age matched (8\u201312 weeks), maintained in specific pathogen free conditions, individually tracked and monitored daily for clinical signs of stress or illness. labeled bacteria were washed twice with PBS containing 10% FBS and suspended in macrophage medium. bacterial strains were engineered to express HIV-1 Gag or MPER (NEQELLELDKWASLWN) on the cell surface. lysozyme digestion 2.8 108 CFU/mL of live or UV-killed lactobacilli were suspended with or without 100g/mL lysozyme from chicken egg white. samples were frozen at\u201480 \u00b0C for subsequent hNOD2 stimulation assays or used immediately for OD600 evaluation. lactobacilli digest samples were centrifuged, separated into soluble and insoluble fractions. insoluble product suspended in 80 L of sterile water (Gibco) hNOD2 cells were seeded at 7.5 104 cells per well. conditioned medium was DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin. BMDM purity was confirmed to be > 95% by HBSS cell dissociation Buffer (Life Technologies) labeling. mouse F4/80, APC-anti-mouse CD11b, and PE/Cy7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (BioLegend) followed by 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) staining and fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde containing 5 g/mL actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) mice were immunized with buffered solution only or 2 109 CFU of recombinant Lactobacillus (NCK1895 or NCK2166) at three consecutive days at week 0, 2, and 4; at week 6, mice were sacrificed. the donor mouse cages from opposing strains were exchanged after 3 days. fecal pellets were suspended at 100 mg/mL in PBS with 10% goat serum, 2X proteaseArrest and 0.1% Kathon. fecal contents were processed by the same method as fecal pellets, but without proteaseArrest. blood was periodically collected from tail vein or terminally via cardiac puncture. gentamicin, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin. tissue was mechanically disrupted prior to and after enzymatic digestion. lymphocytes were isolated using a Percoll gradient and suspended in CTL media. the lower and upper limits of detection for the assay (pg/mL) were 3.19\u201310012.78 (IL-6), 3.1\u20131896.06 (TNF-), 3.14\u201310094.09 (IFN-), 3.11\u20139999.54 (IL-10), 2.77\u201310020.87 (IL-12 (p70)), 3.23\u20138964.25 (IL-17), 3.18\u20137982.37 (IL-4), 9.65\u20139546.41 (GM-CSF), 2. controls and samples diluted in 1% BSA/PBST were added and incubated for 2 h at RT, washed five times in PBST, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Pierce Thermo Fisher Scientific for HIV-Gag and Cell Signaling Technology for MPER and SlpA) multiScreen assay plates were aseptically treated with 50 L of 70% ethanol. plates were washed five times with 200 L distilled water (Gibco) plates were coated with 100 L of 10 g/mL -mouse IgA. plates were washed as before, wells blocked with 200 L of CTL medium for a minimum of 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. more than 2.5 105 lymphocytes were added into wells with or without 10 ng/mL of AT-2 inactivated HIV-1 IIIB viral lysate. time points and response variables were modeled with the PROC MIXED statement in SAS software version 4.3 (Cary, NC) the difference between treatments was assessed using the \u201cslice\u201d statement with a Tukey-Kramer adjustment, whereas means compared to controls used the Dunnett\u2019s adjustment. ELISA seroconversion data and histological grouping data were compared using a Chi-square test with a two-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test. a two-tailed Spearman r correlation test was performed on antibody and histology scores. all animals were age matched (8\u201312 weeks), maintained in specific pathogen free conditions, individually tracked and monitored daily for clinical signs of stress or illness. animals were housed socially (2\u20135) in commercially available, individually ventilated caging systems with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. all bedding and enrichment materials was autoclaved prior to use. combinant strains were engineered to express HIV-1 Gag or MPER (NEQELLELDKWASLWN) on the cell surface as previously described. for intragastric dosing, bacteria were washed twice in sterile PBS and suspended in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate with 20 mg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor. replicate bacterial digests were heated at 94 \u00b0C for 5 minutes to inactivate lysozyme, suspended in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, final concentration, Pierce Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and vortexed vigorously to eliminate protoplasts, then OD600 was measured. hNOD2 cells were seeded at 7.5 104 cells per well and transfected with lactobacilli digest products in triplicate. positive control L18-MDP (200 ng/mL, InvivoGen) and negative controls of sterile water and Pam2CSK4 (100 ng/mL, InvivoGen) were treated similarly. BMDM purity was confirmed to be > 95% by HBSS cell dissociation. cells were washed in HBSS through diminishing concentrations of EDTA to dislodge extracellular lactobacilli. analysis was conducted on an LSR II flow cytometer with FlowJo software (Ashland, OR) freshly isolated B lymphocyte populations were analyzed via flow cytometry after undergoing Fc receptor blocking (BD Biosciences), staining with anti-mouse CD45-FITC, CD38-PECy7, CD19-Pacific Blue, and subsequent 7-AAD. mice were immunized with buffered solution only or 2 109 CFU of recombinant Lactobacillus (NCK1895 or NCK2166) on three consecutive days at week 0, 2, and 4; at week 6, mice were sacrificed. spleen, intestine, female reproductive tract (FRT), mesenteric lymph node (MLN), peyer\u2019s patches (PP) were also harvested. blood was periodically collected from tail vein or terminally via cardiac puncture. single cell suspensions of lymphocytes were isolated from the MLN, PP, spleen, colon, and FRT. PP and spleen were dissociated in 5 mL cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) medium. small intestine ex vivo culture performed as previously described to assess tissue cytokine production. supernatants from 24 h BMDM-lactobacilli co-culture were evaluated for IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, IFN-, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-17, IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-1, IL the 24 h small intestine ex vivo culture supernatants were evaluated using a customized 14-plex MAP mouse TH17 cytokine magnetic bead assay. only IL-1 data are reported; lower and upper limits of detection for the assay were 15.08\u201313893.06 pg/mL. plates were washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) for HIV ELISAs. samples diluted in 1% BSA/PBST were added and incubated for 2 h at RT, washed five times in PBST, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. the reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 1N sulfuric acid and absorbance measured on a plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) plates were coated with 100 L of 10 g/mL -mouse IgA (AN18, Mabtech) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. plates were washed as prior, wells blocked with 200 L of CTL media for a minimum of 2 h at 37 \u00b0C, and 1 104 cells per well added. additional wells included 50 ng/mL phorbol-myristate-acetate and 300 ng/mL ionomycin as a positive control. lymphocytes were incubated over two nights at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2, then washed 6 times with PBST. 100 L filtered biotinylated IFN- detection antibody was added at 1 g/mL. flow cytometric data expressed as a percentage were transformed using arcsine of the square root. a log10 transformation was used for flow cytometric MFI data along with cytokine data. if more than half of the cytokine responses were below the LLOD, the treatment or mouse-type was excluded from the analysis. lactobacilli activation by lactobacilli influences phagocytosis and phenotypic activation of macrophages NOD2 and TLR2. despite strain-dependent variability in susceptibility of bacteria to lysozyme digestion, the soluble fractions of each lactobacilli species strongly activated NOD2. positive control, L18-MDP, and negative control, Pam2CSK4, were treated similarly. Means with the same letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05) from each other. BMDM derived from wild type C57BL/6 or Tlr2-/-, Nod2-/-, or Casp1-/- mice co-cultured with lactobacilli bacteria. BMDM phenotype after 24 h co-cultured with either negative control (no bacteria), TLR2/6 agonist (Pam2CSK4) or Cell Trace Violet stained lactobacilli bacteria. asterisk denotes a significant difference (P 0.05) between treatments within a BMDM genotype. the innate immune signaling involved in BMDM activation was assessed by flow cytometry after 24 h co-culture with lactobacilli. BMDM from wild type C57BL/6, (b) Tlr2-/-, (c) Nod2-/-, and (d) Casp1-/- mice were co-cultured with CFSE-labeled lactobacilli (10 CFU per 1 cell; green) after 24 h, media was removed, cells were stained with actin-specific phalloidin (red and DNA-specific DAPI (blue) co-culture of BMDM with NCK2031 resulted in significantly lower concentrations of IL-6, MIP-1, and IL-12 (p40) compared to NCFM. lack of SlpB/X or LTA expression by NCFM did not alter IL-1, TNF-, or KC production by BMDM. Tlr2-/-, Nod2-/- and Casp1-/- BMDM were treated similarly to the WT BMDM described above. in the absence of nod2 or Casp1, all cytokines and chemokines measured (IL-6, IL-1, TNF-, MIP-1, IL-10, IL-12 (p40) were significantly lower than observed with WT BMDM. gastric immunization of C57BL/6 mice NOD2 signaling plays a role in regulating the gastrointestinal microbiome and shaping the mucosal immune response. we sought to determine whether our NCFM-derived oral immunization strategy expressing an HIV-1 model antigen (Gag) was dependent on NOD2 signaling in vivo. no mice were positive for antigen-specific IgA in vaginal washes. antigen-specific serum IgG levels in sera were statistically significant. seroconversion of immunized animals was defined as 2-fold absorbance. only IL-1 cytokine data (mean with SEM) is shown with assay lower limit of detection indicated by horizontal dashed line. supernatants from cultured small intestine were evaluated in a customized 14-plex cytokine assay. IL-1 was significantly elevated in mice immunized with NCK2166 compared to animals immunized with either buffer only or NCK1895 controls. nod2+/+ and Nod2-/- BALB/c mice were immunized with buffer only, NCK1895, or GAD31. a significant increase in total fecal IgA was identified from 0 to 12 weeks in GAD31-immunized Nod2+/+ mice only. at sacrifice, lymphocytes were isolated from Peyer\u2019s patches (PP), large intestine (LI), female reproductive tract (FRT) and spleen; applied to total IgA ELISpot assay for 20 h of incubation without stimulation. data represented as spot forming units (SFU) per 1 106 live B cells. N = 4\u20136 animals per group. the same criterion was used for endpoint titer data, with values under detection limit assigned 0; N = 12 animals per group (d and e) the same criterion was used for endpoint titer data, with values under detection limit assigned 0; N = 12 animals per group (d and e) mucosal MPER-specific humoral responses corresponded with SlpA-specific endpoint titers. nod+/+ mice had significantly higher endpoint titers for serum SlpA-specific fecal IgA. soluble and insoluble fractions of each lactobacilli species, strain, and mutant strongly activated NOD2. soluble and insoluble fractions of each lactobacilli species, strain, and mutant were digested with lysozyme for 2 h and OD600 assessed at t = 0 and 2h. positive control, L18-MDP, and negative control, Pam2CSK4, were treated similarly. the percentage of WT BMDM containing NCK1785 or NCFM was similar at 2 h. NCFM mutants lacking LTA (NCK2025) or SlpB/X (NCK2031) were found in a significantly higher percentage of WT BMDM than was NCFM at 2 h and 24 h. 7-AAD- BMDM cells were gated on 7-AAD-F4/80+cells to assess purity. then 7-AAD- BMDM subdivided into Bacteria+ (Bacteria +) or Bacteria- (Exposed) populations. asterisk (*) indicates statistically significant difference (P 0.05) between respective treatments and no bacteria control. the pattern of CD11b and MHCII expression and upregulation was similar in Tlr2-/- BMDM (P 0.0003 and P = 0.0004) the pattern of CD11b and MHCII expression and upregulation was similar in nod2-/- BMDM as compared to WT BMDM (P 0.001 and P = 0.0006) inflammatory cytokine induction by Lactobacillus spp. is dependent on NOD2 and caspase-1 activation. no treatment induced significant production of GM-CSF, IL-12 (p70), IFN-, IL-17, or IL-4. BMDM from wild type C57BL/6, Tlr2-/-, Nod2-/-, or Casp1-/- mice were co-cultured with NCK1785, NCFM, or NCFM mutants (NCK2025 or NCK2031) for 24 h and culture supernatants harvested for cytokine and chemokine quantification using a 12-plex milliplex MAP mouse assay. Tlr2-/- BMDM expressed significantly lower concentrations of MIP-1 and IL-10 after co-culture with NCK1785. IL-10 expression was diminished in the absence of TLR2 signaling (P = 0.0004) NOD2 signaling is required for antigen-specific systemic humoral responses after intragastric immunization of C57BL/6 mice. cecal contents and vaginal anti-Gag IgA samples were collected from mice at sacrifice. no mice were positive for antigen-specific IgA in vaginal washes. no correlation between anti-SlpA or IgG seroconversion. data represented as mean percentage (and SEM) of 7-AAD-CD45+CD19+CD38- B cells across tissue type from NCK1895 and NCK2166 immunized mice. serum and cecal contents were harvested, serially diluted and applied to antigen-specific colorimetric ELISA. Spots were counted after 2 nights of incubation and data represented as difference of spot forming units (SFU) from HIV IIIB stimulated and unstimulated cells per 1 106 live, CD45+ cells. cytokine milieu present within intestinal mucosa of immunized mice correlated with humoral responses. MLN and ileal contents were collected and cultured to quantify lactobacilli vaccine strains. the numbers of abnormal tissue samples were not significantly different amongst groups. there was no positive correlation detected between colonic inflammatory scoring and humoral responses. a significant increase in total fecal IgA was identified from 0 to 12 weeks in GAD31-immunized Nod2+/+ mice only. wild type Nod2+/+ or Nod2-/- BALB/c mice were immunized with buffer only, NCK1895, or GAD31. data are represented as absorbance (mean with SEM) across time at 1:100 dilution for MPER-specific and 1:1000 for SlpA-specific serum and 1:10 for vaginal wash and feces. average control values at the same dilution are represented as open circle or square. the endpoint titer of MPER-specific vaginal IgA, but not serum IgG, at the terminal time point was significantly higher in Nod2+/+ than Nod2-/- mice. however, while the relative amount of MPER-specific fecal IgA in Nod2-/- was significantly greater than WT mice at week 12, only 2 of 12 Nod2-/- mice versus 6 of 12 Nod2+/+ mice were positive for MPER-specific i NCK1785, L. acidophilus NCFM, and the NCFM mutant strains NCK2025 and NCK2031 lead to the generation of a type II M2 (M2b)-like macrophage in vitro. we found nod2-/- macrophages were fundamentally impaired in their response to lactobacilli [16, 35]. the cytokine profile associated with NCFM was biased toward higher IL-10 and IL-12 (p40), and lower KC than NCK1785. the cytokine profile associated with NCFM has an inflammatory effect since NCK2025, which lacks LTA, is associated with increased IL-10, decreased IL-12 (p40), and decreased CD11b and MHCII expression by macrophages in vitro [23, 24, 48] the critical role of NOD2 for lactobacilli-induced innate immune signaling was linked to adaptive immune responses using an in vivo mucosal vaccination model. a growing body of evidence suggests a crucial role for NOD2 and the microbiota in mucosal vaccine responses. ing in CD11c+ phagocytes implicated NOD2 in follicular helper T cells and plasma cell development. other studies have shown NOD2 expression by hematopoietic cells is required for optimal antibody responses. additional studies will be required to determine specific cell types responsible for the NOD2-dependent humoral responses identified here. vertical slice representation of large intestine/colon and small intestine data shown as the proportion of animals per group in each classification. exhibiting mild colitis or enteritis (mild inflammation), or containing increased granulocytes in the lamina propria (proprial granulocytes) bacilli enumeration is a bacilli enumeration enumeration."}
