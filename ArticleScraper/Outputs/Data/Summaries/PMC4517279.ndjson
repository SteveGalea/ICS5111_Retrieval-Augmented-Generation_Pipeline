{"summary": "two general types of recombination have been described for RNA and DNA viruses. the most extensively documented mode of genetic exchange in viruses is replicative homologous recombination that consists of template switches during genome replication to yield mosaic genomes. some viruses use strand transfers as a part of their replicative mechanisms. recombination mechanisms are available to most if not all viruses characterized to date. a few thousand progeny genomes can be produced per cell depending on information encoded by the virus and the resources provided by the cell. otide means nearly 1 million-fold higher values than for normal cellular genomes (27\u201329) the result of high mutation rates is that these error-prone replicating viruses form complex and highly dynamic distributions of related but nonidentical genomes. in several viral systems, the complexity of viral quasispecies and the total amount of viral particles (viral load) in an infected organism are parameters that have been correlated with pathogenic potential and disease progression (27). v-mos gene of the retrovirus was 106-fold higher than the rate of its homolog c-mos. this is the case of human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) the virus differ in the number of carrying clones in the blood of infected individuals with HTLV-2 characterized by a small number of highly expanded clones. some viruses may undergo continuous recombination because such events are inherent to the replicative mechanism. recombination goes unnoticed because of the lack of appropriate markers to distinguish parental from progeny recombinant genomes. the distinction does not modify the two main biological objectives postulated for recombination. many of the circulating virulent polioviruses have been generated by recombination between vaccine poliovirus strains and other circulating enterovirus genomes. the current epidemiological picture for the ongoing AIDS epidemics is that, in addition to the standard subtypes, there are 53 circulating recombinant forms. this figure should be considered transient and it is probably growing as this report is being processed. multiple, low-level recombinants (internal deletions) at the capsid-coding region were identified. the monopartite FMDV genome evolved by recombination-mediated events toward two genomes that infected and killed cells by complementation. a total of 30 mutations (12 synonymous and 18 nonsynonymous) were incorporated into the population. mutations accumulated during virus passage were critical to confer a selective advantage to the bipartite genome over its parental unsegmented counterpart. this process requires coinfection of the same cell by at least two divergent viruses. recombination may be a relatively rare event, thereby permitting viral lineages (or near-clades) to maintain their identity for extended time periods in defined geographical areas. coevolution appears to have produced sets of genes to function coordinately, therefore favoring linkage disequilibrium and maintenance of identifiable near-clades. this interconnected influences support the predominantly clonal mode of viral evolution. Fig. 2 can represent either intrahost or interhost events at widely different time scales. the model of predominant clonal evolution of viruses does not imply that recombination cannot play an important evolutionary role. it does at the discontinuity points but it is not part of the \u201cnorm\u201d or \u201cway of life\u201d of the majority of viruses."}
