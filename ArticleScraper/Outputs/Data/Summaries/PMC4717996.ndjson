{"summary": "the genus beta-CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA novel species of the genus. it was first reported after genome sequencing of a virus isolated from sputum samples from a patient who died from a critically ill pneumonia in jeddah, Saudi Arabia. since then, the virus has limitedly spread predominantly in Saudi Arabia until this outbreak in south Korea. MERS-CoV infection associated with considerable mortality (35.6%, as of June 26 according to data of WHO), especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities, such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease. the basic reproduction number of MERS-CoV, Ro is 1 in early studies. a total of 1706 (up to 20%) health care workers (HCWs) were infected in the outbreak of SARS between 2002 and 2003 in china and worldwide. a total of 1706 (up to 20%) health care workers (HCWs) were infected in the outbreak of SARS between 2002 and 2003. the early symptoms of MERS are nonspecific and therefore HCWs are at high risk of acquiring this contagious infection while caring for patients or handling with human biologic material. the relative contribution of hospital-based transmission is over 4 times higher than that of community transmission. a better understanding of how HCWs are infected in health care settings is urgently needed. CDC and hospitals initiated a deliberate infection control procedure for the index case's isolation and the 75 close contacts\u2019 quarantine. the success we have achieved by controlling this crucial public health event reveals a thorough quarantine protocol and a mature public health surveillance system in China today. this effective management of the potential public health threat by all walks of groups, especially health care and disease prevention and control system, brought out the dramatic progress on national efforts."}
