{"summary": "ARI is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the disease burden for ARI is estimated at 94,037,000 disability-adjusted life years. ARI is most often associated with mild upper respiratory infection (URI) etiology of most cases of asthma, namely virus-induced asthma, is linked to such respiratory virus infections. RSV and HRV are the most frequently detected pathogens. the main causative viral agent of asthma depends on previous illness and age. around one-third of infants who have an acute wheezing illness go on to develop recurrent wheezing. viral infections induction and/or exacerbation asthma in children. a history of wheezing and host immunological conditions heightens the risk for asthma. a history of wheezing and host immunological conditions heightens the risk for asthma. the attachment glycoprotein (G) is a major structural protein that may be associated with both infectivity and antigenicity. the strains of subgroup A can be subclassified into eight genotypes. the strains of subgroup A can be subclassified into eight genotypes. NA1 is a novel genotype known to be genetically close to GA2 genotype. GA2 genotype and BA genotype are the most common genotypes of RSV subgroups A and B around the world. this genotype contains a tandem repeat (72nt sequence duplication) in the C-terminal 3rd hypervariable region of the G gene. botosso et al. (2009) found 29 and 23 amino acid sites under positive selection in RSV-A and RSV-B respectively. these amino acid variations at these sites might play a key role in severe respiratory infection, such as bronchiolitis. human rhinovirus are a group of positive-sense ssRNA viruses belonging to genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. recent reports strongly suggest that HRVs may induce and/or exacerbate asthma. HRV has been concomitantly isolated with bacterial pathogens in 24\u201354% of children and 10\u201318% of adults with pneumonia. it is not clear whether HRV is ever the causative agent for the disease. a genetically heterogeneous third species, HRV species C (HRV-C), was discovered recently. Kiyota et al. (2013) estimated that the rate of molecular evolution of the VP4/VP2 coding region was rapid (3.07 10-3 substitutions/site/year) in HRV-C. this suggests that HRV-A and -C detected in ARI cases are the predominant strains and have varied genetic properties. variants at the 17q21 locus were associated with HRV induced asthma in children who had a history of HRV wheezing illnesses. association of 17q21 variants with asthma restricted to children who had a history of HRV induced asthma. subgroup A2 has been subdivided into two lineages, subgroup A2a and A2b (Huck et al., 2006). it has been suggested that these genotypes circulate in variable proportions in some areas. it remains unclear whether different HMPV subgroups are associated with differences in the clinical course of disease. the association between HMPV subgroup and disease severity is controversial. it may be that there is a correlation between some positively selected epitopes and disease severity. HPIV1 and 3 show high prevalence and are associated with up to 12% of acute lower respiratory tract infections in adults. it is suggested that HPIV is a major causative agent of virus-induced asthma. only a few reports on the molecular epidemiology of HPIV1 are available. larger and more detailed studies on the association of HPIV with asthma are needed. infV vaccine was available before the influenza season since InfV causes more severe illness than other respiratory viruses. the level of detection of HCoV, HBoV, or AdV is relatively low. dual infections of HMPV and RSV or HRV and RSV confer a 5- to 10-fold increase of severe disease in children admitted to pediatric intensive care units. co-infection with both HMPV and RSV increased the rate of intensive care unit admissions. viral therapy is not yet available for patients infected with respiratory viruses. the detection and identification of these viruses could help explain serious respiratory illness, provide guidance for medical care and prevent unnecessary treatment with antibiotics."}
