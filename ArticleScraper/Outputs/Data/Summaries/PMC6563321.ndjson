{"summary": "the European Virus Bioinformatics Center (EVBC) was conceived of in 2017 to bring together experts in virology and virus bioinformatics in Europe [1,2]. EVBC\u2019s member numbers have increased steadily since then with currently 151 members from 78 research institutions distributed over 26 countries across Europe and internationally. this spring, the Annual Meeting of the EVBC was held for the third time. virology, like all of biology, is now a data science, exploiting methods from dimensionality reduction of large datasets to data visualisation. the scale and complexity of datasets is ever increasing. plicase complexes by Volker Thiel Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses that infect a variety of mammalian and avian species. in humans, there are four coronaviruses known to cause rather mild respiratory symptoms. however, the appearance of zoonotic viruses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), exemplified that coronaviruses coronavirus RC-proximal host proteins and pathways have documented roles in the life cycle of other positive-stranded RNA viruses. many of the coronavirus RC-proximal host proteins have also documented roles in the life cycle of other positive-stranded RNA viruses. influenza accompanied by bacterial co-infection is the most striking problem of influenza accompanied by bacterial co-infection. in a single-centre study, we detected 1197 influenza-virus-positive samples and 89 S. aureus-positive respiratory specimens. but the diagnosis of a co-infection was significantly lower with 17 samples. new methods enable investigations with cost-saving and efficient cell culture models. organ-on-a-chip technology allows species-specific investigations for different cell types and also immune cells. single cell analysis of iNfluenza Virus Infection in its natural target cell. in both NS1R38A-infected cultures, there was a significant decrease in viral burden compared to mock hAECs. we also identified a number of cell-type-specific innate immune responses, including the expression of type I and III IFNs. phages in all environments including the human microbiome are increasingly acknowledged to be the puppeteers of their bacterial hosts. phages have multiple, often complex interactions with their bacterial hosts, forcing them to interact differently with other bacterial and human cells. phages can change bacterial surfaces to prevent recognition by the human immune system. Clostridium difficile phages target clinically-relevant and prevalent strains. most effective phage set being isolated from one geographical location. but they are strikingly variable with very few identifiable genes in common. metagenomics unveiled the extent of genetic diversity of viruses in marine water and human faeces. ubiquitous viruses are increasingly being discovered by metagenomic analysis of globally-distributed, ecologically-stable ecosystems. viruses have vast global population sizes that result in highly-efficient evolutionary selection pressures and optimized genomes. viral metagenomics has been proposed as an alternative method to qPCR-based approaches for the detection of pathogenic viruses linked to food- and water-borne illness in the aquatic environment. viral metagenomics has been proposed as an alternative method to qPCR-based approaches for the detection of pathogenic viruses linked to food- and water-borne illness in the aquatic environment. Evelien Adriaenssens was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) she showed that reconstruction of uncultivated Virus Genomes (UViGs) [37] and classification into families reduced the fraction of completely unknown sequences. she showed that they can identify pathogenic virus genomes present in the Conwy River catchment area, mainly found in wastewater. new capabilities to recover and assemble genome sequences have unearthed vast numbers of previously-undescribed viruses from environmental, human clinical, veterinary and plant samples. how such viruses can be incorporated into the current virus taxonomy is a major challenge, especially at the family and species levels. there are no published guidelines in the ICTV code on how similar or how divergent viruses must be. over one half (460/921) of (near)-complete genome sequences from recently-generated eukaryotic virus datasets could be assigned to 127 novel family-level groupings. the method is based on extraction of protein sequences from reference virus genomes and their clustering using pairwise BLASTp bit scores. genome relationships can be extracted by computation of various genetic distance metrics, including composite generalised Jaccard similarity. the taxonomy of the 20 currently-classified prokaryotic virus families differs substantially. the highly-fragmented and degraded nature of ancient genetic material and the high risk of modern contamination are causing further problems in the analysis. a wide variety of software utilizing different approaches like HMMs, dedicated marker genes and complete genome references are available to screen these ancient samples for the presence of pathogens. spanning over longer time frames opens the door for reliable diachronic analysis and maybe even epidemiological analysis. a team composed of Ben Krause-Kyora, Julian Susat, Felix M. Key, Denise K\u00fchnert, Alexander Immel, Alexander Herbig, Almut Nebel and Johannes Krause. virosphere is not yet widely accepted in most disciplines, a good exception being marine biology/ecology. we analysed how virosphere protein domain occurrence is related to the occurrence of protein domains in all (sequenced) organisms. this is based on the distribution of protein domains in viruses and in organisms. genesis of novel domains in viruses is double coding or overprinted genes. web-tool cRegions helps to find potential double coding regions. virus-to-host gene transfer is one process leading to shared domains. based on sequence-to-sequence comparison. long-Range Interactions (LRI) are described in a few RNA virus families [49] but are computationally intensive to predict. a single nucleotide changing can disrupt the replication of a coronavirus completely [50]. a deep understanding of conserved RNA structures is necessary to develop anti-viral therapies. alignment calculated by VeGETA has structure annotations for the complete genomes, including 5\u2019 UTR, coding regions and 3\u2019 UTR. the sequence embedded in the SLB structure is known to play a role in the genome circularization of flaviviruses [56], whereas the cHP facilitates the translation of the coding region by pausing the translation machinery. the use of viral sequence data and phylodynamic methodologies for understanding the transmission patterns in animal populations was discussed. using avian influenza as an example of a widespread multi-species disease system, it was shown that wild birds (wild Anseriformes) were responsible for long-range transmissions of highly-pathogenic H5N8. phylodynamic methods using viral sequence data with time, space and species metadata reveal complex transmission patterns. parallel evolution and the emergingence of highly-pathogenic Avian Influenza A Viruses circulate among wild and domestic bird populations worldwide. some strains only cause mild to asymptomatic infections, known as low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LP), high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HP) can have an extremely high mortality rate in both domestic and wild bird populations. the mutational panel provided here may function as an early detection system for transitional virulence stages. Circulating AIVs that do not have a polybasic cleavage site should remain under surveillance. year of circulation, virus subtype and consensus sequence for the polybasic Cleavage Site (pCS) within the Hemagglutinin protein are indicated for the selected outbreaks used in this work (C1-C9) human-infective and human-transmissible viruses evolve independently. at least 73% of human-transmissible RNA virus lineages emerged directly from non-human virus lineages in diverse mammal or bird taxa. coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses that infect a variety of mammalian and avian species. in humans, there are four coronaviruses known to cause rather mild respiratory symptoms; however, the appearance of zoonotic viruses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses replicate their RNA genome at host-derived membranes in the host cell coronaviral RC biotinylates, affinity-purifies and identify specific viral components constituting the coronavirus RC and host cell proteins that are in close proximity. many of the coronavirus RC-proximal host proteins and pathways have also documented roles in the life cycle of other positive-stranded RNA viruses. influenza accompanied by bacterial co-infection is the most striking problem of influenza accompanied by bacterial co-infection. a single-centre study found 1197 influenza-virus-positive samples and 89 S. aureus-positive respiratory specimens. infection was significantly lower with 17 samples. the use of murine models is adversely regarded because of obvious discrepancies between men and mice. new methods enable investigations with cost-saving and efficient cell culture models as an excellent supplement to animal experiments. we then annotated host and viral transcriptomes of more than 19,000 single cells across the five major hAEC cell types for mock, WT, and NS1R38A conditions. in both ciliated and goblet cultures, there was a significant decrease in the fraction of ciliated and goblet cells compared to mock hAECs. the RC synthesizing viral RNA is encoded on the genomic RNA. it comprises a set of 15\u201316 non-structural proteins (nsps) a wealth of additional enzymatic activities, such as endoribonuclease, ADP-ribosylation and de-ubiquitination, are included in the coronaviral RC. virus-host interactions at the RCs of a wide range of RNA viruses. our data may thus serve as a paradigm for other RNA viruses. a comprehensive analysis of critical virus-host interactions represents targets for therapeutic intervention. we detected 1197 influenza-virus-positive samples and 89 S. aureus-positive respiratory specimens. mortality rate increased dramatically from single infection (approximately 20%) to co-infection. thelium constitutes the first line of defence against invading respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses. it remains unclear how key innate immune components are distributed among the different cell populations found in the respiratory epithelium and how the latter may influence the host response to infection. the cause of this extreme heterogeneity remains unclear. hAEC, human airway Epithelial Cells and the Virome This session was chaired by David Robertson (MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research), the local organizer of the meeting. two speakers have been invited on this topic. phages can change bacterial surfaces to prevent recognition by the human immune system. in cystic fibrosis, they can allow their hosts to cope with anaerobic conditions found in mucus-laden lungs. in many bacteria, they encode potent toxins. phages are likely to be critical to solving antimicrobial resistance crisis. the group is currently in the process of creating and examining genetic mutants to identify phenotypes and conducting structural work on novel proteins, for example to identify tail fibres. deciding which genes to focus on is key, as downstream work is key to unravelling critical phenotypes. large-scale comparisons of gene order in genome sequences of dsDNA bacteriophages revealed a surprisingly conserved genomic structure [26,27] a possible mechanism at play is the genomic encoding of different transcriptional regions with promoters that govern the expression of early, middle and late specific genes. a possible mechanism at play is the genomic encoding of different transcriptional regions with promoters that govern the expression of early, middle and late specific genes. near-complete genome sequences of crAss-like viruses were detected in faecal samples of a range of wild non-human primates. these genomes revealed a strong collinearity with human-associated crAss-like viruses, suggesting that the association of crAss-like viruses with the primate gut biome may be millions of years old. phages in all environments including the human microbiome are increasingly acknowledged to be the puppeteers of their bacterial hosts. phages in all environments including the human microbiome are increasingly acknowledged to be the puppeteers of their bacterial hosts, shaping their structure and evolution and physiology. there are around 25% unknown genes, or genes that have no known ascribed function, but in phage genomes, only around 25% of the genes are generally known. despite the most effective phage set being isolated from one geographical location, they are strikingly variable with very few identifiable genes in common. metagenomics unveiled the extent of genetic diversity of viruses, initially in marine water and human faeces [20], and in many different biomes since. ubiquitous viruses are increasingly being discovered by metagenomic analysis of globally-distributed, ecologically-stable ecosystems, including once again the global oceans [21,22] and the human gut [23,24,25]. viruses have vast global population sizes that result in highly-efficient evolutionary selection pressures and optimized genomes. a constant recombination rate of five events per year has been observed for siphoviridae bacteriophages [31], but when longer timespans are assessed, mutation rate estimates may drop dramatically by orders of magnitude [32]. d Metaviromics for the Detection of Pathogenic Viruses in the Environment has been proposed as an alternative method to qPCR-based approaches for the detection of pathogenic viruses linked to food- and water-borne illness in the aquatic environment. the main advantage is that viral communities can be investigated without prior knowledge of the genome sequences or genotypes of the viruses present in the sample. the classification of viruses in metagenomic datasets has unearthed vast numbers of previously-undescribed viruses from environmental, human clinical, veterinary and plant samples. how such viruses can be incorporated into the current virus taxonomy is a major challenge, especially at the family and species levels. if \u201csequence-only\u201d viruses are to be placed into the classification maintained by the International Committee on the taxonomy of Viruses, then their assignments will have to be largely or there are no published guidelines in the ICTV code on how similar or how divergent viruses must be in order to be considered as new species or new families. there are no published guidelines on how similar or how divergent viruses must be in order to be considered as new species or new families. the method is based on extraction of protein sequences from reference virus genomes and their clustering using pairwise BLASTp bit scores. genome relationships can be extracted by computation of various genetic distance metrics, including composite generalised Jaccard similarity. the taxonomy of the 20 currently-classified prokaryotic virus families differ substantially. despite the recent advantages in ancient DNA techniques, the identification of authentic viral sequences from ancient material is still challenging. the fast evolution of viral pathogens and the comparability to modern variability in viruses make it even more difficult to identify their ancestors reliably. the new HBV genomes we reconstructed support our earlier findings. a bigger number of HBV cases spanning over longer time frames opens the door for reliable diachronic analysis and maybe even epidemiological analysis. virosphere and biosphere are not always pathogens, and they are also an important and inseparable part of the biosphere. the wider functional and evolutionary role of viruses in the biosphere is not yet widely accepted in most disciplines, a good exception being marine biology/ecology, where viruses are already accepted as important players. a possible route for the genesis of novel domains in viruses is double coding or overprinted genes. we have developed a web-tool cRegions (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/cRegions/) RNA secondary structures are known to play important roles in viruses. they can initiate and facilitate transcription, translation and replication. a single nucleotide changing can disrupt the replication of a coronavirus completely [50] the alignment calculated by VeGETA has structure annotations for the complete genomes, including 5\u2019 UTR, coding regions and 3\u2019 UTR. the sequence embedded in the SLB structure is known to play a role in the genome circularization of flaviviruses [56], while the cHP facilitates the translation of the coding region by pausing the translation machinery and finding the correct starting triplet [57]. there are no published guidelines on how similar or how divergent viruses must be in order to be considered as new species or new families. there are no published guidelines in the ICTV code on how similar or how divergent viruses must be in order to be considered new species or new families. a simplified diagram of the steps used to construct profile tables from viruses with assigned taxonomic status. the method is based on extraction of protein sequences from reference virus genomes and their clustering using pairwise BLASTp bit scores. eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses support ongoing efforts by the ICTV to revise thoroughly the phage taxonomy. a consistent classification of viruses is essential for future, evidence-based classification of metagenomic viruses. despite the recent advantages in ancient DNA techniques, the identification of authentic viral sequences from ancient material is still challenging. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the medieval strain was genotype D and surprisingly conserved. the ancient Neolithic strains were closer together than any other modern and closest to strains from Old-World monkeys. this might suggest reciprocal cross-species transmission between human and ape. virosphere and biosphere are not always pathogens. the wider functional and evolutionary role of viruses in the biosphere can be examined in several different ways. virosphere protein domain occurrence is related to the occurrence of protein domains in viruses and organisms. eity of viruses is clearly expressed by where in the phylogenomic space the domains found in different viral taxons are located. the virosphere is a source of functional and structural novelties also for this superkingdom. a possible route for the genesis of novel domains in viruses is double coding or overprinted genes. RNA secondary structures are known to play important roles in viruses. a single nucleotide changing can disrupt the replication of a coronavirus completely [50]. a deep understanding of conserved RNA structures is necessary to develop anti-viral therapies. we were able to predict structures in the genus Flavivirus [53] that are consistent with described structures in the literature. resulting alignment calculated by VeGETA has structure annotations for the complete genomes, including 5\u2019 UTR, coding regions and 3\u2019 UTR. the first two elements were recognized by the viral replication mechanism (NS5) [55]. phylodynamics for tracking epidemiological, endmic and evolving viral Strains can have important economic and health consequences globally. the ability to predict where, in which host species and under what conditions outbreaks could occur is key to developing prevention and control strategies. wild Anseriformes were responsible for long-range transmissions of highly-pathogenic H5N8. they reassort frequently, picking up different neuraminidase subtypes. phylodynamic methods using viral sequence data with time, space and species metadata reveal complex transmission patterns. mutations occur anywhere in the viral genome, preceding or following the appearance of a polybasic proteolytic cleavage site. we used a comparative phylogenetic and structural approach to detect shared mutations evolving under positive selection across the whole genome of HP AIVs of the H7NX and H5NX subtypes. this model statistically assesses genotype-phenotype associations. mutation is a non-conservative amino acid change located within an antigenic pocket site. Branches within the trees are coloured according to the corresponding amino acid states in nodes. the probabilities of a given amino acid state occurring within ancestral/descending nodes are indicated. the HP clusters of interest are highlighted with blue circles. mutations strongly associated with an HP phenotype may function as an early detection system for transitional virulence stages. the ability to predict where, in which host species and under what conditions outbreaks could occur is key to developing prevention and control strategies. there are growing collections of animal virus sequences from around the globe. the use of viral sequence data and phylodynamic methodologies for understanding the transmission patterns in animal populations was discussed. phylodynamic methods using viral sequence data with time, space and species metadata reveal complex transmission patterns and can be used to understand, track, model and ultimately inform disease control measures. parallel evolution of HP lineages from LP ancestors may have been facilitated by permissive or compensatory secondary mutations. the mutational panel provided here may function as an early detection system for transitional virulence stages. circulating AIVs that do not have a polybasic cleavage site should remain under surveillance. countries of emergence are highlighted in red. at least 90 nodes across 39 genus-level phylogenies have been identified. human-infective and human-transmissible viruses evolve independently. at least 73% of human-transmissible RNA virus lineages emerged directly from non-human virus lineages in diverse mammal or bird taxa. we enjoyed lively discussions after the speakers\u2019 presentations, in the breaks, during the poster session and at the social events. speakers summaries provided in this report will give an interesting insight into the field of virus bioinformatics."}
