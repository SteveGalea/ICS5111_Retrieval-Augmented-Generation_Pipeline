LGALS1 had allelic association P value of 2.07 106 and 2.75 106. a software implementation, SnipSnip, has been designed to increase the association signal of poorly-tagged or non-genotyped causal variant by combinational analysis of two genotyped SNPs. the software uses a sophisticated algorithm to select an optimal nearby partner SNP for each anchor SNP based on the correlation between the two SNPs. the software successfully identified causal variants which would otherwise be missed by the conventional single-SNP analysis17. three out of the top four association variants from SnipSnip analysis were mapped to LGALS1. the artificial imputation implemented in SnipSnip increased the association signal compared with single-SNP analysis. rs4820294 and rs62236673 were in high LD in our study participants (r2 = 0.98) and other populations (r2 = 1.0, Figure 1), indicating the anchor/partner pair rs4820294/rs2899292 and rs62236673/rs2899292 captured the identical causal variant. the causal variant captured by SnipSnip analysis was represented as an anchor/partner pair. the odds ratio of 0.26 for haplotype GG with the liability to infection can be translated into a more comprehensible interpretation that carriers of this haplotype were conferred 3.84 fold of protection from A(H7N9) infection compared with non-carriers (P = 5.92 107). the approximation of the P value of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG to the AI P value of rs4820294/rs2899 rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG exhibited higher LGALS1 mRNA expression in these 74 LCLs. rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG showed higher LGALS1 mRNA expression in these 74 LCLs. rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG may represent the molecular underpinning for its genetic association with the resistance to A(H7N9) infection. the upper panel denotes the chromosomal region that accommodates the LGALS1 gene. boxplot denotes non-carriers (N = 49), heterozygotes (N = 21) and homozygotes (N = 4) of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG respectively. rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG correlated to the LGALS1 protein expression in these LCLs. rs4820294 was a strong cis-eQTL for LGALS1 in lung tissues of 1111 individuals. rs13057866, a SNP 2 kb upstream of LGALS1, emerged as one of the top hits. the region harboring rs2071769 and rs34195652 has been defined as a strong regulatory region according to the experimental evidence of ENCODE Consortium. rs13057866 displayed a strong association signal with an allelic association P value of 2.75 106. the protective allele A was over-represented in control group (29.3%) than in patient group (10.8%) with an odds ratio of 0.29. functionally haplotypes tagged by rs13057866, rs4820294 and their high LD variants are the real causal variants which generated the strong association signals in SnipSnip implementation. rs4820294, rs13057866 and their high LD variants are the real causal variants which generated the strong association signals. the top two hits were the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. 8 polymorphic genes fell in this category while the expected number is 1.03 by chance.

workers were intentionally recruited. there was no significant difference in the proportion of female between the A(H7N9) cases and poultry worker controls (34% (35/102) vs 35% (37/106), P = 1.000) the patients were significantly older than the poultry worker controls. the LD patterns of the three anchor SNPs and their high LD variants are plotted for 208 study participants. the boxes are colored according to D\u2032 measure on a white and red scale where red indicates complete LD (D' = 1). the red box without number indicates the highest r2 of 1.0. artificial imputation (AI) P value (6.72 108) of the top association signal, a variant of C8B, marginally met the genome-wide significance threshold. AI P values of the next three variants, which were mapped to LGALS1, fell at 107 level. imputation P rs646606|rs706481 57416633|57415200 C8B;chromosome 1 (intronic/intronic) 6.72 108 rs13057866|rs9622682 38069622|38074434 LGALS1; chromosome 22 (upstream/intergenic) 3.13 107 rs62236673|rs2899292 38076063|38077718 LGALS1; 4. haplotype AA was rarely present in our study subjects with an overall frequency of less than 2%. strongest association signal was haplotype GG, which was significantly overrepresented in controls (35.58%) than in A(H7N9) patients (14.33%). rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG exhibited higher LGALS1 mRNA expression in these 74 LCLs. rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG showed higher LGALS1 mRNA expression in these 74 LCLs. correlated to the carriage status of haplotype GG, i.e., homozygous-, heterozygous- and non-carriage, by linear regression analysis. we chose 21 LCLs with three distinct carriage statuses of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG. the higher LGALS1 expression level of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG may represent the molecular underpinning for the green line indicates the highest scoring site of an identified canonical motif for the corresponding factor. the association variants of LGALS1 are correlated to differential expression levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines. gene expression levels of LGALS1 in human lung correlated to genotype groups of rs4820294. levels of LGALS1 transcript are normalized with those of GAPDH. rs4820294 was a strong cis-eQTL for LGALS1 in human monocytes. rs13057866 was in high LD with rs2071769 (r2 = 1) and rs34195652 (r2 0.98) in Han Chinese (CHB), Asian (ASN) and American (AMR, Figure 1). rs34195652 is a T/TG indel 154 bp upstream LGALS1. rs13057866, rs4820294 and their high LD variants form a high LD block in the regulatory region of LGALS1. the functionally haplotype(s) tagged by rs13057866, rs4820294 and their high LD variants are the real causal variants which generated the strong association signals in SnipSnip implementation. rs4820294, rs13057866 and their high LD variants functionally related genes in the same molecular network or pathway are often involved in the disease susceptibility22. all variants with P 0.001 were mapped to 536 unique genes with ANNOVAR23. the top two hits were the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. the adjusted P is the P value after correction for multiple tests. we identified two polymorphic genes LGALS1 and C8B as well as two biological pathways. expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been mapped by paralleled genome-wide analysis of gene expression. local eQTLs (cis-eQTLs) refer to those within 1 Mb to the regulated gene. cis-eQTLs tend to have larger effect on gene expression than distant eQTLs (trans-eQTLs)29. the highly expressed LGALS1 in bronchial epithelial cells displayed considerable variations among 215 humans. genetic variants of LGALS1, including rs4820294 and rs13057866 and the related variants, encode the higher expression of LGALS1 in humans. this may confer the carriers of these variants more protection from A(H7N9) infection. the influenza A virus infection starts with the attachment of virion to the receptor, followed by the efficient viral propagation in the host cells37. the essential role of MAPK signaling pathway for the replication of influenza A viruses has been explicitly demonstrated38. a genetic association at the early stage of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza encountered the same dilemma. some variants identified in this study have been substantiated with functional validation. most A(H7N9) patients manifested as lower respiratory tract infection. allelic association values for SNPs were generated using PLINK v10745. SNPs with more than 10% missing rate or minor allele frequency less than 5% were removed from the association analysis. the intracellular expression of LGALS1 was determined with a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer. peripheral blood mononuclear cells preparation, monocyte separation and RT-qPCR assay were performed as described previously. all patients who donated their lung tissue samples for generation of this dataset have provided written informed consent. the allelic association values for SNPs were generated using PLINK v10745. a total of 705,459 SNPs remained after quality control. imputation analysis, pathway-based analysis and LD analysis. the intracellular expression of ALS1 was determined with a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer. data were analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar) eQTL analysis and lung eQTL dataset."}
