{"summary": "the sample, handling and transport of specimens from patients with HIDs present specific bio-safety concerns. findings The European Network for HID project aimed to record the infection control capabilities of referral centers across Europe. 48 isolation facilities in 16 european countries were evaluated. the european network for Highly Infectious Diseases (EuroNHID) performed a cross-sectional study analysis of european isolation facilities. the specific mission of EuroNHID is to prepare and support isolation facilities to provide appropriate infection control measures and strategies for health care worker safety during care to patients with suspected and confirmed HIDs. the appropriate management of HID cases requires high-level diagnostic capabilities. 48 isolation facilities identified for referral and management of HIDs in 16 countries Table 1. Diagnostic capabilities, appropriate location and procedures for microbiological and routine tests in 48 referral center for HID in 16 European countries Diagnostic capabilities Evaluation score* A Fully/mostly B Partially C Not Achieved achieved Achieved N (%) N (%) Topic 1: The isolation facility has access to BSL-4 labs or capabilities/protocols for the safe and appropriate handling of group 4 agent specimens for diagnosis 11/48 (23) the unit is located in the same hospital/city as a BSL-4 lab. the unit is not located in the same hospital/city as a BSL-4 lab. the unit is not located in the same hospital/city as a BSL-3 lab. isolation facilities are located in the same hospital or city as the isolation facility. 48 (100%) and 47 (98%) have a BSL-3 lab [8] for virological and bacteriological diagnosis in their country. 19 (40%) of the isolation facilities perform routine analysis in the central hospital lab without inactivation. 31% and 11% performed their routine and microbiological diagnostic tests in the central laboratory without using closed-type auto-analyzers in 5 (11%) and 15 (31%) of the surveyed facilities. the delay between data collection and publication can be considered as one of the limit of this paper. in 2009, the EUNID has reached a consensus on recommended biosafety procedures for the entire diagnostic process. the aim of this paper is to report the current inventory of the diagnostic capabilities and infection control procedures for the appropriate and safe handling of specimens in 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries. national health authorities in all of the european countries were asked to suggest a physician with expertise in HID management as a project partner. to survey only isolation facilities identified by national health authorities for the referral and management of HIDs, we requested official documents in which these hospitals are clearly indicated. the checklists were drafted by the steering committee members and then discussed with and approved by all of the partners. isolation facility has access to BSL-3 labs or capabilities/protocols for safe and appropriate handling of group 4 agent specimens for diagnosis 11/48 (23) 30/48 (62) 7/48 (15) Topic 3: isolation facility has capabilities/procedures for the safe and appropriate management of other tests/routine analysis in HID patients. the unit is located in the same hospital/city as a BSL-3 lab. the unit is not located in the same hospital/city as a BSL-3 lab. the unit is not located in the same hospital/city as a BSL-3 lab. isolation facilities have an adequate protocol for safe and appropriate handling of group 3 agents. 19 (40%) of the isolation facilities perform routine analysis in the central hospital lab without inactivation. the remaining 13 (27%) facilities perform other diagnostic tests in the central laboratory without any special measures of biosecurity and biosafety. the less prepared centers can improve by just updating their practice and policies. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. this work was supported by the European Community grant EuroNHID number 2006205. this manuscript has been edited for US English by American Journal Experts number QTYDPDF8."}
