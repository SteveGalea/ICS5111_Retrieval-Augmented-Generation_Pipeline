{"summary": "we propose a new alignment-free algorithm, mBKM, for clustering gene sequences. this method transforms DNA sequences into feature vectors which contain the occurrence, location and order relation of k-tuples in DNA sequence. this method is also compared with BlastClust, CD-HIT-EST and others. the word-based measure is one of the most widely used methods. it chooses a short word length k, maps each sequence onto an n-dimensional vector according to its k-length tuple properties. this method then assesses the similarity of any two vectors by measures such as Euclidean distance [15], Mahalanobis distance [16], Kullback\u2013Leibler discrepancy [17], cosine distance [18] or Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient [19 CL tends to find compact clusters of approximately equal diameters. SL can be seen as an intermediate between single and complete linkage clustering. SL can be seen as an intermediate between single and complete linkage clustering. variation of KM was proposed to build a tree of clusters in a top-down fashion by splitting the least homogeneous cluster into two more homogeneous ones. recent study concluded that BKM outperforms KM and performs equally well or better than hierarchical methods when it partitions the dataset based on a homogeneity criteria. traditional clustering methods based on sequence alignment encounter computational difficulties in dealing with large biological databases. the approach involves a new alignment-free distance measure based on k-tuples, DMk (Distance Measure based on k-tuples) and a modified bisecting K-means clustering algorithm, mBKM (modified Bisecting K-Means algorithm) alignment score for (S1S2) is given by Sim Score ( S 1, S 2 ) = p = 1 l E ( S 1 p, S 2 p ) (1) where E is the cost of an alignment operation: deletion, substitution, or insertion. alignment-free similarity measure helps avoid the computational complexity of multiple sequence alignment for similarity computation. Spr is the location of the rth occurrence of k-tuple w, where p0 = 0. And r is given as, r = 1 p r p r 1, 1 r m (2) in which m stands for the number of occurrences of w. r reflects the density of w and is closely related to the location where w occurs in the sequence. the Shannon entropy reflects the degree of importance of position in a sequence. we construct a discrete probability distribution Q = ( q 1, q 2,..., q m ). for each k-tuple w in the sequence, the information of tuple positions is involved in the definition of H. DMk can be calculated from following algorithm: Algorithm Name: DMk for similarity measure Input: sequences S1, S2,..., SN. For each sequence, search and locate each k-tuple; use Equation (1) to calculate r ( 1 r m ) for each k-tuple, use Equation (3) to calculate H. the bisecting approach is very attractive in many applications for clustering and genomic data analysis. there are two key steps in a typical BKM. the first is the selection of initial centroids. the second key step is the rule, for selection of a cluster to be split in each bisecting step. mBKM chooses the initial centroids by the maximum and minimum principle. selects the cluster to split based on the compactness of clusters. a cluster with large number is not always the loose one. n j, 1 i, j N (8) where j is the centroid of sequences in Cj, d (si, j) is the distance between si and j. nj is the number of sequences in the cluster. the smaller the variance is, the more compact the cluster is. the number of occurrences of a k-tuple w, Nw, is counted by moving a sliding window of length k over the sequence with k - 1 bp overlapping step size. for a DNA sequence Spr is the location of the rth occurrence of k-tuple w, where p0 = 0. And r is given as, r = 1 p r p r 1, 1 r m (2) in 1, 2,..., m and 1, 2,..., m determine each other uniquely. j is only dependent on the number and positions of w and independent on other k-tuples. k-tuples in a fixed 4k-dimension feature vector are denoted by ( H 1, H 2,..., H 4 k ), where Hi means the feature representation of the ith k-tuple. this feature vector based on H can be regarded as an index for its corresponding sequence. cluster analysis algorithms partition objects into groups based on the distance between objects. mBKM KM can be used to obtain a hierarchical clustering solution using a repeated bisecting approach [50,51]. mBKM is such an algorithm and it can produce either a partitional or a hierarchical clustering. the way of splitting the largest remaining cluster is recommended [50]. the algorithm for choosing one existing cluster to split usually selects the cluster with the largest size. the algorithm for choosing one existing cluster to split usually selects the cluster with the largest size. variable is a measure of how far a set of numbers are spread out from each other. the variance of cluster Cj is defined as following: j = s i C j d 2 ( s i, j ) n j, 1 i, j N (8) where j is the centroid of sequences in Cj. each leaf represents a sequence and each node represents a sequence collection. results and discussion The proposed method is evaluated by clustering functionally related gene sequences and by phylogenetic analysis. the larger the F-measure, the better the clustering result is. we test DMk on gene sequence data sets and compare it with the k-tuple distance. in 55 478 Cytoglobin Myoglobin RWD 93 825 RWD domain-containing protein VCL 92 2746 Histone DS2 HBG106679 22 446 Copper uptake protein 2 HBG108349 49 718 Prolactin HBG079775 26 3152 Transcription elongation factor SPT5 HBG058842 34 1351 TNFR superfamily member 1A HBG002834 92 951 Calumenin/Reticulocal KM, single-linkage clustering (SL), complete-linkage clustering (CL) and average-linkage clustering (AL) have been chosen in the experiments. KM algorithm would yield different results during multiple executions due to its stochastic feature for initialization. DMk outperforms the k-tuple distance in the experiments. this is because DMk considers the occurrence, location and order relation of tuples in sequence and can capture more information in the sequence. the k-tuple distance considers frequency alone and ignores the position of tuples in a sequence.

Figure 2 illustrates the results of the six clustering algorithms with the k-tuple distance. DMk achieves better cluster quantity than the k-tuple distance. DMk also obtains higher F-measures at corresponding number of clusters. the results of many runs are lower than those of mBKM. BlastClust is an alignment-dependent clustering algorithm. we compare mBKM with DMk to two other clustering programs. CD-HIT-EST is a popular DNA clustering program. mBKM with DMk produces good results relative to each original cluster set in terms of F-measure. each F-measure of mBKM with DMk is higher than 0.8 and the highest is 0.9645. we run mBKM with DMk with the range of 3\u201320 numbers. the average values of F-measure are 0.7065, 0.8533, 0.8205 and 0.8429 for DS1, DS2, DS3 and DS4 respectively. the clustering result of 10 species We apply mBKM with DMk to the 10 DNA sequences of -globin gene in Table 4. phylogenetic trees for 60 H1N1 viruses are distinctly divided into four main groups using our method. the four groups include European swine older than 2009 (G1), the avian older than 2009 (G2), American swine older than 2009 (G3) and the new 2009 viruses from human, swine older than 2009 (G3) new 2009 human H1N1 viruses have closer relationship with old american swine than old avian and European swine. result is generally consistent with the topology given by CLUSTALW with UPGMA, which is shown in Figure 5(b) and the one presented by MUSCLE with UPGMA, as well as the result suggested by zhao et al. the number of sequences in each dataset is 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 respectively; the lengths of all the sequences are around 3000 respectively. ML method is slower than UPGMA, but we use ML to build the phylogenetic tree of the results from CLUSTALW and MUSCLE. scalability was tested on five datasets with five different sequence lengths. each set contains 10 clusters and all the sequences have the same length, 100. the curve in Figure 7(a) is consistent with time complexity of mBKM with O. DS2 is taken from HOGENOM, a database of homologous gene families from microbial organisms. DS4 is randomly selected from HOMOLENS, a database of homologous genes from Ensembl organisms and Ensembl families. KM, single-linkage clustering (SL), complete-linkage clustering and average-linkage clustering (AL) have been chosen in the experiments. for larger k values, there are more tuples with zero frequencies. the results indicate that DMk performs better than k-tuple distance. the results indicate that DMk performs better than k-tuple distance. this is because DMk considers the occurrence, location and order relation of tuples in sequence.
