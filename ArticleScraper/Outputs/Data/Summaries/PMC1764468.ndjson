{"summary": "genome sequencing initiatives of human and model organisms are targeted efforts towards understanding principles of evolution with an application envisaged to improve human health. VirGen is a comprehensive viral genome resource that serves as an annotation and analysis. the genome sequencing projects of 932 prokaryotic and 608 eukaryotic species have been launched. SV-40 was the first virus for which the complete genome (5,224 bp) sequence was obtained in late 70s. genome sequence data of viruses offer unlimited opportunities for data mining and knowledge discovery. genome sequence data of two large viral genomes viz., Mimivirus [7] and Polydnavirus [10] substantiate this fact. v2.0, dated august 15, 2006, contains genomic data of 25 viral families that include 2895 genomes and 23121 annotated proteins. genomic data for both, DNA and RNA viruses infecting animals, plants and microbial species are included in VirGen database. vertebrates Rhabdoviridae ssRNA Plant, Vertebrates Hypoviridae dsRNA Protozoa Circoviridae ssDNA Bacteria Salient features Curation of genomic entries of viruses Organization of genomic data in a structured fashion to facilitate navigation from family to strain/isolate Compilation of representative genomic entries for every viral species Annotation of genomic entries Compilation of synonyms for viral proteins Reconstruction of phylogeny the entries were curated with respect to taxonomic hierarchy. the names of viral strains/isolates were not explicitly present in the field 'organism source' but were available as part of feature table annotations. a majority of the genomic records in public domain repositories lacked the information on genotype. an approach based on whole genome phylogeny was used to assign the genotypes. more than 130 records of HCV were annotated and added to VirGen. a dictionary of synonyms for viral proteins is used in the back-end. this dictionary of controlled vocabulary of protein names is used in the back-end for enhancing the utility of keyword-based searches in VirGen. mumps virus is one of the smallest replicating species in the vector. a total of 64 amino acid residues spread across the alignment spanning 652 positions are conserved. a total of 64 amino acid residues spread across the alignment spanning 652 positions are conserved. the alignment position accounting for the highest variability is 349. 11 distinct amino acids viz., His, Asn, Ala, Glu, Gln, Ile, Val, Met, Thr, Ser, Cys are found to occur at that position. a block of multiple sequence alignment of envelope glycoprotein (Egp) of 47 strains of japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is shown in Figure 6. a block of multiple sequence alignment of envelope glycoprotein (Egp) of 47 strains of japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is shown. MSA of 47 strains of JEV Egp show mutations in this region, leading to occurrence of seven unique tripeptides (RGE, RGH, RGG, RED, RGN, MGD, MGD) all tripeptides except MGD and RGN are naturally occurring. whole genome phylogenetic analysis facilitates identification of unclassified viruses. tree was evaluated using bootstrap data of 1000 replicates. tree also shows grouping of flaviviruses into the mosquito-borne, tick-borne and no known vector clades. the tree shows that the unassigned members of Flaviviridae family form a polyphyletic clade with the mosquito-borne Flaviviruses. the tree also shows that the pestiviruses form a polyphyletic clade with the mosquito-borne Flaviviruses. VirGen stores predicted B-cell epitopes using sequence-based and structure-based algorithms developed in-house [50-52] Kolaskar & Tongaonkar's method is a sequence-based approach for prediction of B-cell epitopes. residues having average antigenic propensity 1.0 are termed as potential antigenic determinants. predicted conformational epitope contains two sequential epitopes and an individual accessible residue. antigenicity of predicted conformational epitope 382\u2013394 has been experimentally validated. the structures of envelope glycoprotein of two strains of japan encephalitis virus have been predicted. the structure module facilitates identification of templates for knowledge-based homology modeling and identification of targets for structural genomics initiatives. the structures of envelope glycoprotein of two strains of japan encephalitis virus have been predicted. a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of cleavage by NS3 requires determination or simulation of the ternary complex comprising of NS3-NS2B-substrate. the structure of its cofactor was predicted using molecular dynamics and its interactions were studied using docking simulations. the sequence identity between NS3 of JEV and that of DEN and HCV is 47.16% and 13.3% respectively. the active site residues His51, Asp75 and Ser135 are found to be conserved. the predicted structures were critically evaluated for stereochemical and geometrical correctness. cofactor A hydrophobic stretch of the non-structural protein 2B (NS2B), an integral membrane protein, serves as a cofactor for NS3 [61,72], but this sequence was not identified explicitly in JEV. it is known that the binding of the NS2B to NS3 is a co-translational event [65], where NS2B may only be partially folded. the structure of only hydrophobic stretch mentioned above was predicted using multiple MD simulations of 1n the strand of NS3 forms one of the blades of the propeller domain of NS3. the atoms of N' Trp and C' Arg of the cofactor, NS2B are shown. active site residues His51 and Ser135 were found to interact with leucine of the substrate via the formation of hydrogen bonds. the two Arginine residues of the substrate also interact with Thr52 and Thr54 of NS3 of the binding site. VirGen has grown since its initial release wherein data pertaining to eight viral families was archived. VirGen provides a sitemap, which can also be used as a starting point for navigation. current status The release (v2.0, dated August 15, 2006) contains genomic data of 25 viral families that include 2895 genomes and 23121 annotated proteins. genomic data for both, DNA and RNA viruses infecting animals, plants and microbial species are included in VirGen database. sRNA Fungi Totiviridae dsRNA Protozoa Circoviridae ssDNA Vertebrates Microviridae ssDNA Bacteria Salient features Curation of genomic entries of viruses Organization of genomic data in a structured fashion to facilitate navigation from family to strain/isolate Compilation of representative genomic entries for every viral species Annotation of genomic entries Compilation of synonyms for viral proteins Reconstruction of phylogeny using genome/ family genetic material type Host Arteriviridae ssRNA(+) Vertebrates Barnaviridae ssRNA(+) Vertebrates Coronaviridae ssRNA(+) Vertebrates Dicistroviridae ssRNA(+) Invertebrates Flaviviridae ssRNA(+) Vertebrates Leviviridae ssRNA(+) VirGen: a genome annotation and comparative genomics platform for viruses. a snapshot of navigation via taxonomic hierarchy illustrated using complete and putative genomes of Flavivirus members. a majority of the genomic records in public domain repositories lacked the information on genotype. an approach based on whole genome phylogeny was used to assign the genotypes. a majority of the genomic records in the public domain repositories lacked the information on genotype. a well-annotated and characterized entry has been identified as the'representative genomic entry' for a given species. the representative entries provide a non-redundant set of viral genome sequences. the annotations are further refined to accommodate genus and species-specific organisation. a well-annotated and characterized entry has been identified as the'representative genomic entry' for a given species. a well-annotated and characterized entry has been identified as the'representative genomic entry' for a given species. a stretch of 996 nucleotides (891\u20131787 bp) do not have any annotation. a search of this sequence using BLAST against the viral division of GenBank did not provide any hit indicating a non-viral origin for the sequence. MSA data and predicted epitopes for HN protein along with predicted 3D structures were used to study strain specificity of mumps virus [30]. multiple sequence alignment of viral genome and proteome at different levels of taxonomic hierarchy helps to detect species and strain-specific signature sequences. the genus specific pattern 'T- [DN]-I- [AS]-E- [VM]-G-A-N of NS3 has been derived using this MSA. this data was used to derive genus-specific signature 'T- [DN]-I- [AS]-E- [VM]-G-A-N' of NS3. Egp contains 500 residues and folds into three structural domains. of the 500 residues, 318 (63.6%) are conserved, which amounts to 36.4% of variation. singletons account for 100 positions, leaving only 82 sites with information content. the RED tripeptide is present in a highly neurovirulent and neuroinvasive strain P3. phylogenetic trees are usually reconstructed using a single gene/protein. phylogenetic noise is minimal when whole genome sequence data was used. tree obtained for 56 species belonging to the genera Flavivirus, Pestivirus and Hepacivirus clearly depicts the clustering of viruses as per their assigned genus. the tree also shows grouping of Flaviviruses into the mosquito-borne, tick-borne and no known vector clades. bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 (BVDV-1) branched out prior to branching of other Pestiviruses. branching of all six genotypes of Hepatitis C virus is clearly seen. phylogenetic tree reconstructed using maximum parsimony. Kolaskar & Tongaonkar's method is a sequence-based approach for prediction of B-cell epitopes. the algorithm is based on antigenic propensity, which is assigned to each of the twenty amino acids depending on their frequency of occurrence in experimentally determined B cell epitopes. the predicted conformational epitope contains two sequential epitopes and an individual accessible residue. the antigenicity of the predicted epitope 382\u2013394 has been experimentally validated previously. a stretch of 996 nucleotides (891\u20131787 bp) do not have any annotation. a search of this sequence using BLAST against the viral division of GenBank did not provide any hit indicating a non-viral origin for the sequence. MSA data and predicted epitopes for HN protein and predicted 3D structures were used to study strain specificity of mumps virus [30]. multiple sequence alignment of viral genome and proteome at different levels of taxonomic hierarchy helps to detect species and strain-specific signature sequences. the genus specific pattern 'T- [DN]-I- [AS]-E- [VM]-G-A-N of NS3 has been derived using this MSA. this data was used to derive genus-specific signature 'T- [DN]-I- [AS]-E- [VM]-G-A-N' of NS3. sensitivity and specificity values were calculated. Egp contains 500 residues and folds into three structural domains. of the 500 residues, 318 (63.6%) are conserved, which amounts to 36.4% of variation. singletons account for 100 positions, leaving only 82 sites with information content for phylogenetic analyses. the RED tripeptide is present in a highly neurovirulent and neuroinvasive strain P3. phylogenetic trees are usually reconstructed using a single gene/protein or a region encompassing them. phylogenetic trees are usually reconstructed using a single gene/protein. tree obtained for 56 species belonging to the genera Flavivirus, Pestivirus and Hepacivirus clearly depicts the clustering of viruses as per their assigned genus. the tree also shows grouping of Flaviviruses into the mosquito-borne, tick-borne and no known vector clades. bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 (BVDV-1) branched out prior to branching of other Pestiviruses. branching of all six genotypes of Hepatitis C virus is also clearly seen. phylogenetic tree reconstructed using maximum parsimony. Kolaskar & Tongaonkar's method is a sequence-based approach for prediction of B-cell epitopes. the algorithm is based on antigenic propensity, which is assigned to each of the twenty amino acids depending on their frequency of occurrence in experimentally determined B cell epitopes. virGen contains the predicted epitopes of known antigenic proteins. antigenicity of predicted conformational epitope 382\u2013394 has been experimentally validated. epitope predictions using the CEP algorithm are limited by the availability of three-dimensional structures of viral proteins. models were used to design candidates for peptide vaccine for japanese encephalitis. they helped to gain an insight into strain-specific variations. molecular mechanism of polyprotein cleavage at NS3-NS2B in JEV was modeled. a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of cleavage by NS3 requires determination or simulation of the ternary complex comprising of NS3-NS2B-substrate. the structure of its cofactor, NS2B was predicted using molecular dynamics and its interactions were studied using docking simulations. overall G factor score for both the models calculated using Procheck [76] was found to be in the range of -0.02. the plot of combined energy drawn using ProsaII [77] indicated that the structure is energetically favourable (Figure 10a). the binding of the NS2B to NS3 is a co-translational event. the structure of only hydrophobic stretch mentioned above was predicted using multiple MD simulations of 1ns duration. the peptide was found to adopt helical conformation predominantly. the substrate is oriented by binding of the amino acid side chain of the P1 residue in the S1 pocket. it is known that the substrate binding cleft of the Dengue virus II protease is not very extensive and does not appear capable of providing specific interactions in the absence of NS2B activating peptide. active site residues of NS3 are shown in ball & stick rendering. backbone of substrate is shown in stick rendering. dotted lines indicate hydrogen bonds between substrate and NS3. the surface of NS3 is coloured according to charge spectrum. the surface of cofactor is shown in pink. the surface of substrate is shown in cyan with reduced transparency. s were used to retrieve, parse, populate and update the database. the models were refined using steepest descents and conjugate gradient methods. 100 docked conformations were collected during this phase in which the ligand is subjected to random combinations of translational and rotational movements. the conformations lying within the energy range of 100 kcal and 1 RMS deviation were selected. twenty conformations satisfying above criteria were further refined in the second stage using Group_based method. the models were built using Homology module of Insight II molecular modeling package. the initial conformation of the peptide WEMDAAITGSSR was assigned randomly from the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. 100 docked conformations were collected during this phase in which the ligand is subjected to random combinations of translational and rotational movements. the conformations lying within the energy range of 100 kcal and 1 RMS deviation were selected. twenty conformations satisfying above criteria were further refined in the second stage using Group_based method. students who worked on various aspects of development of VirGen as part of their masters' projects are acknowledged. authors would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their useful suggestions to improve presentation of this manuscript."}
