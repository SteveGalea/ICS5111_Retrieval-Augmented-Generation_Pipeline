{"summary": "avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus in the order Nidovirales (1). IBV replicates primarily in the respiratory tract (6, 7), causing a highly contagious respiratory disease characterized by nasal discharge, snicking, rales, and tracheal ciliostasis in chickens (8). the ectodomain region of the S2 subunit contains a fusion peptide. the transmembrane region is responsible for anchoring the S protein into the lipid bilayer of the virus particle. the ectodomain region is responsible for anchoring the S protein into the lipid bilayer of the virus particle. coronavirus RBD is an independently folded region of the S glycoprotein responsible for interacting with the virus receptor on susceptible host cells. the location of the RBD of IBV has been mapped to be within the N-terminal 253 amino acids of the S1 subunit (49) host cell receptors for several coronaviruses have been identified. lectins dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and L-SIGN as alternative receptors independently of ACE2 (57) the receptor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been identified to be dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (58) the protein receptor for IBV has not yet been elucidated. some strains of IBV, following adaptation, are able to replicate in primary chicken cells, such as chick kidney (CK) cells. the Beaudette strain, after several hundred passages in embryonated eggs, was also discovered to have an extended host range. s in BeauR-M41(S1) passaged three times (P3) on CK cells. one nucleotide substitution, C23378T, was identified in BeauR-M41(S2) P3-CK, resulting in 1 amino acid substitution, F625T, within the Beaudette S2 subunit.

BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N826S-L857F-I1000V P7-Vero had several other substitutions; G21709A resulted in V448I, and C22342A resulted in P659T. the rIBV appears to be losing the L857F modification, resulting in a mixed population at C22936T. a faint band corresponding to the S2\u2032 cleavage product was also observed in the BeauR-M41-S-BSM sample. this indicates that proteolytic processing is not as efficient in the recombinant spike glycoprotein. this could be due to subtle differences in the tertiary or quaternary structures of the BeauR-M41-S-BSM spike glycoprotein. two replicates of BeauR-S-MM P3-CK and BeauR-M41-S-BSM P3-CK were used. bands corresponding to uncleaved spike, the S2 subunit, and the S2\u2032 cleavage product were labeled. rIBVs expressing S genes with chimeric subunits were produced. the substitutions could have arisen during rescue or passage of the virus on CK cells. the substitutions could have arisen during rescue or passage of the virus on CK cells as they were not present in the parental recombinant vaccinia viruses.

BV BeauR-S-MM P3-CK lost its ability to grow in vero cells. production of progeny BeauR-M41-S-BSM P3-CK virus from vero cells was undetectable. growth was considerably lower than that observed for Beau-R. the rIBV BeauR-M41-S-BSM isolates were successfully passaged on vero cells. the virus had a growth pattern very similar, within 1 log10, to the growth pattern of Beau-R on Vero cells. no additional mutations were identified in the BeauR-M41-S-BSM P7-Vero S gene, other than the nucleotide substitution identified at P3-CK, A22226C. pGPT-M41-S-BSM-L578F-N617S and pGPT-M41-S2-L578F-N617S were introduced. a series of cDNAs containing a variety of the Beaudette-specific amino acids in the M41 S2 sequence were generated by random homologous recombination using the two pGPT plasmids. rIBVs produced less progeny virus than Beau-R in first 24 h postinfection. titers that reached or exceeded the titer of Beau-R over 48 h postinfection. all the rIBVs had a similar growth pattern in CK cells by immunofluorescence analysis. the supernatant was harvested at 1, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection. three replicates were performed, and the averages were taken. infected cells were fixed at 24 h postinfection. immunolabeled with mouse anti-dsRNA and secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (green; Invitrogen) nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue) the rIBVs with the additional Beaudette-derived amino acids in the M41 S2 subunit were passaged on Vero cells. the P7-Vero isolates were reexamined for growth on Vero cells. all the rIBVs replicated with patterns similar to and peak titers. 857F-I1000V P7-Vero, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N826S-L857F-I1000V P7-Vero, and BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L578F-N617S-L857F-I1000V P7-Vero at an MOI of 0.005. the supernatant was harvested at 1, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection and titrated the rIBV appears to be losing the L857F modification. the rIBVs containing the Beaudette-specific motif are proteolytically cleaved at the S2\u2032 cleavage site. a faint band corresponding to the S2\u2032 cleavage product was also observed. olytic processing is not as efficient in the recombinant spike glycoprotein. this could be due to subtle differences in the tertiary or quaternary structures of the BeauR-M41-S-BSM spike glycoprotein. the size of the S2\u2032 cleavage product may appear to be smaller than expected due to distortion of protein coils in the gel. the cleavage product was detected in lanes 2, 7 and 8 only. DISCUSSION Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the poultry industry. production of IBV vaccines in embryonated hen's eggs is expensive and cumbersome. the advent of a reverse genetics system for IBV (75\u201377) creates the opportunity for generating rationally designed and more effective vaccines. the advent of a reverse genetics system for IBV (75\u201377) creates the opportunity for generating rationally designed and more effective vaccines. we have identified the specific region in the Beaudette genome, within the spike glycoprotein, responsible for its ability to grow in vero cells. the Beaudette-specific motif does not appear to confer the ability to grow on BHK-21 cells in the same way. this indicates that there may be other regions of the S glycoprotein responsible for the extended host range of Beau-R in mammalian cells other than Vero cells. rIBVs containing the Beaudette-specific motif are susceptible to cleavage at the S2\u2032 site. the rIBVs containing the equivalent sequence from M41 are not cleaved at the S2\u2032 site. the efficiency of this cleavage appears to be lower in the rIBVs containing the BSM than in Beau-R. the IBV strains used were (i) M41-CK, derived from the pathogenic M41 strain (84) after multiple passages in CK cells (8, 85, 86) the isolate is able to produce infectious virus in CK cells but not Vero cells. the rIBV strains were propagated and titrated in CK cells as described previously (89\u201391) IBV Beaudette was isolated in the 1930s (87) and M41 as IBV-41 (72, 93, 94) the molecular clone of Beaudette CK does not produce syncytia when grown on vero cells (75) overlapping PCR was used to combine the subunits, forming the chimeric S genes. pGPT-BeauR-S1-M41-S2 and pGPT-M41-S1-BeauR-S2 were synthesized and cloned into pGPT-NEB193 (76) by GeneArt. pGPT-M41-S2-L578F-N617S and N826S, L857F, and I1000V in pGPT-M41-S2-N826S-L857F-I1000V were introduced into the Beau-R cDNA within the genome of four different recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVVs) by homologous recombination using the transient dominant selection system (TDS) all recombinant IBVs were rescued from plaque-purified clones of rVVs containing the IBV cDNA genome. the rVVs were sequenced to verify that the correct S gene was present prior to the rescue of rIBVs. confluent monolayers of CK and Vero cells were infected with rIBV. IBV-infected cells were identified by incubation with a 1:400 dilution of mouse anti-double-stranded RNA (anti-dsRNA) J2 IgG2a monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:200. nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) western blot analysis of rIBV spike glycoprotein proteolytic cleavage. CK cells were mock infected or infected with indicated viruses. cells were scraped into the culture medium and pelleted. the ectodomain of the Beau-R S gene was replaced with the corresponding sequence of the M41-CK S glycoprotein (74) this rIBV has the same tropism as M41-CK and is therefore able to produce infectious virus on CK cells but not Vero cells. pGPT-M41S and pGPT-IBV-StuI-BamHI were amplified by PCR from two plasmids, pGPT-M41S and pGPT-IBV-StuI-BamHI. pGPT-BeauR-S1-M41-S2 and pGPT-M41-S1-BeauR-S2 sequences, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to the IBV replicase pGPT-NEB193 (76) was synthesized and cloned into pGPT-NEB193. pGPT-BeauR-S-MM contained a cDNA based on the Beau-R S glycoprotein. pGPT-M41-S2-L578F-N617S and pGPT-M41-S2-N826S-L857F-I1000V. pGPT-BeauR-S1-M41-S1-BeauR-S2, pGPT-M41-S-BSM, pGPT-M41-S-BSM, pGPT-BeauR-S-MM, pGPT-BeauR-S-MM, pGPT-M41-S2-L578F-N617S, and pGPT-M41-S2-N826S-L all recombinant IBVs were rescued from plaque-purified clones of rVVs containing the cDNA genome. the rVVs were sequenced to verify that the correct S gene was present prior to the rescue of rIBVs. the rVVs were passaged three times in CK cells prior to experimental use. confluent monolayers of vero and CK cells in 6-well plates were infected with rIBV in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection. cell supernatants were harvested at 1, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection and assayed for progeny virus. membrane was labeled with anti-S2 (catalog number 26.1; Thermo Fisher) and anti-beta-actin (Abcam), followed by IRDye 680- and 800-labeled secondary antibodies (Li-Cor)."}
