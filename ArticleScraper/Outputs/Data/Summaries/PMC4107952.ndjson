{"summary": "the most common viruses were adenoviruses (17.5%), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1\u20134 (16.8%), enteroviruses (EV) (14.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (13.5%), and influenza virus (11.9%). the prevalence of some viruses was subject to geographic and seasonal variations. an exception is made for adenoviruses which have a high prevalence in our study. but adenoviruses can be detected in asymptomatic persons. this finding gave a better understanding of the circulation and seasonality of the viruses involved in ILI in Gabon. a meta-analysis included 51 studies of children hospitalized between 0 and 4 years of age with severe ALRI from 1995 to 2011. the main viral etiologies were adenovirus (8.8%), influenza virus (7%), and PIV (5.8%) in the western Pacific region, the proportions of cases of ILI attributed to influenza virus between 2006 and 2010 were 57% in China, 19% in Japan, 7% in the Republic of Korea, 4% in the Philippines and Singapore, and between 2006 and 2010 influenza viruses were responsible for 21.7% of cases of ILI, ranging from 6.7% in Angola to 40.4% in Madagascar. a study conducted in Cameroon (central Africa) detected viral infections in 65.1% of ILI patients [23]. in Gabon, the circulation of influenza viruses had been little studied. the year begins with a short dry season between January and February, followed by a long rainy season between March and May. patients were enrolled in this study if they visited a participating health center for influenza-like illness. the patient\u2019s name, age, sex and travel history during the month before onset were recorded. virus A(H1N1)pdm09, seasonal influenza virus A (H1N1, H3N2) (SIA) [31], seasonal influenza virus B (SIB) [32], human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-HKU1) [33], rhinovirus (HRV) [34], human parechovirus (HPeV) [ the study took place in three healthcare centers in Libreville and in the regional hospitals of the other towns. the year begins with a short dry season between January and February, followed by a long rainy season between March and May. patients were enrolled in this study if they visited a participating health center for influenza-like illness. mM magnesium chloride, 400 ng deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 40 ng of bovine serum albumin per l, 0.4 M primers and 0.2 M probes, and 1 l of One Step RT-PCR enzyme mix. the 7500 real time PCR system from Applied Biosystems was used with following cycling conditions. the patients were 515 males (49.5%) and 526 (50.5%) females. median age was 2 years (range, 10 days to 82 years) and mean age was 6.1 11.6 years. 810 patients (77.8%) were 0\u20134 years old, 111 patients (10.7%) 5\u201315 years old, and 120 patients (16\u201382 years old) the rates of viral positivity were 68.4% in Libreville, 65.5% in Franceville, 42.3% in Koulamoutou and 60.5% in Oyem. the rate of viral positivity was similar in males (61.9%) and females (60.8%). HCoV-OC43 was the most common HCoV, with 35 cases (57% of all influenza viruses). HCoV-OC43 was the most prevalent HCoV, with 35 cases (51.5% of all influenza viruses). most cases of ILI involved children less than 5 years old (77.8%), and as the viral prevalence was also highest in this age group. most cases of ILI involved children less than 5 years old. PIVs (16.8%), EV (14.7%), RSV (13.5%), and influenza virus (11.9%). PIV3 accounted for 43% of PIVs (Table 3). HCoV-OC43 was more prevalent in Libreville and Franceville than in Koulamoutou and Oyem. HCoV-OC43 was more prevalent in Libreville and Franceville than in Koulamoutou and Oyem. EV (p = 0.01) and HRV (p = 0.00) predominated in the capital and north of Gabon. RSV (p 0.0001) and SIB (p 0.0001) were mainly detected in the south (Franceville and Koulamoutou) EV and HRV were seasonally distributed (X 2 = 27.4, p 0.0001 and X 2 = 80.1, p 0.0001) prevalence was low in the short rainy season in 2010 and increased during the short dry season in 2011. prevalence of PIVs (44.4%) was highest in April 2010, declining until the next dry season. the patient with quadruple infection (Adv, HCoV-NL63, PIV2 and PIV3) was a 3-year-old child diagnosed in Franceville. the patient with quadruple infection was a 3-year-old child. the most common viruses involved in co-infections were PIVs (47.1%), AdV (41.4%), and EV (43.1%) the main viruses involved in monoinfections were EV/HRV 28/174 (16.1%) and AdV/EV 25/174 (14.4%) 424 cases (40.8%) in Libreville, 223 (21.4%) in Franceville, 194 (18.6%) in Koulamoutou, and 200 (19.2%) in Oyem. age distribution was as follows: 810 patients (77.8%) were 0\u20134 years old, 111 patients (5.7%) 5\u201315 years old, and 120 patients (11.5%) 16\u201382 years old. prevalence of viral infections in ILI patients Characteristic Infected Total ILI n (%) 95% CI N 95% CI Sex Male 319 (61.9) 57.7-66.1 515 (49.5) 46.5-52.5 Female 320 (60.8) 56.6-65.0 526 (50.5) 47.5-53.5 Age group (years) [0\u20134] 552 (68.1) 64.9-71.3 810 (77.8) 75.3-80.3 [5-15] 46 (41.4) 32.2-50.6 the study began during the long rainy season in march 2010. we observed a significant increase in the rate of virus-positive ILI during the rainy seasons followed by a decrease in the dry seasons (X 2 = 7.8, p = 0.0052) the only other seasonal difference was that viral infections among children less than 5 years old were more frequent during the rainy season.

HCoV-OC43 was more prevalent in Libreville and Franceville than in Koulamoutou and Oyem (p = 0.02). EV (p = 0.01) and HRV (p = 0.00) predominated in the capital and north of Gabon. HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 appeared in the short rainy season between October and December. in 2011, we only detected HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. the prevalence of RSV increased during the rainy seasons and declined in the dry seasons. fifty-three per cent of hMPV infections were diagnosed during the long rainy season in 2011 (X 2 = 54.7, p 0.0001) and PIV1 during the long rainy season in 2011 (X 2 = 54.7, p 0.0001) we observed only sporadic cases of HPeV infection. 77(13.9) 11.0-16.8 A(H1N1)pdm09 37(9.8) 18(10.3) 0.96 55(10.0) 7.5-12.5 PIV3 27(7.1) 31(17.8) 0.00 58(10.5) 7.9-13.1 SIB 25(6.6) 16(9.2) 0.36 41(7.4) 5.2-9.6 HCoV-OC43 18(4.8) 15(8.6) 0.11 33(6.0) 4.0-8.0 PIV the most common dual co-infections were EV/HRV 28/174 (16.1%) and AdV/EV 25/174 (14.4%) the most common dual co-infections were EV/HRV 28/174 (16.1%) and Adv (18.6%) 61.4% of nasal swabs contained at least one virus. most previous studies have shown a viral prevalence below 50%. 1.2 million children under five years old die each year from pneumonia. influenza virus in 8.8%, PIV1/3 in 3.3% and RSV 2.7%. influenza virus was found in 15% of ILI patients in DRC from 2009 to 2011. the main viruses responsible for ILI were the same. the prevalence of RSV was lower in our study than in many previous reports. the children in these latter studies were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infections. the prevalence of influenza virus (11.9%) was similar to that observed in other countries. in the rural study site, compared to the urban study site, compared to the urban study site [61,62] in the semi rural area, Franceville has a lower density of population than Libreville. the fact that there is only one regional hospital where patients go explain why viruses associated with infections in very young children are more important in this region where the spread would be faster. we detected the highest prevalence of HCoVs (50%) during April 2010 (rainy season) HCoV-OC43 co-circulated with HCoV-NL63 during the long rainy season in 2010, with HCoV-229E during the short rainy season in 2010, and with HCoV-HKU1 during the long rainy season in 2011. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions Conceived and designed the surveillance programmed: DN."}
