{"summary": "the cellular actin cytoskeleton is constitutionally active throughout cellular life. it is involved in key processes such as intracellular organisation, motility, and intracellular transport within and out of cells. it is unsurprising that many viruses have evolved unique methods of not only subverting the barrier cellular actin presents, but even hijacking its chief regulators. Cdc42 signalling can affect changes in actin dynamics through its downstream effectors. actin-polymerising protein Arp2/3, Cofilin, and myosin light chain (MLC) can also be activated by Rac1 via WASP-family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) proteins. TPases are in an active state and are able to bind and activate downstream signalling molecules, realising their effects on the cellular actin-network. each Rho GTPase is associated with a characteristic effect on the cellular cytoskeleton, but there is a great degree of overlap, crosstalk and dynamic action within Rho GTPase signalling pathways. this can be demonstrated by considering the LIM domain kinase (LIMK)s-co despite these advancements, adoption of novel inhibitory agents has been extremely limited in this field. investigation has been unwarrantedly skewed towards targeting RhoA and Rac1. this review aims to present the growing evidence base for a primary role for Cdc42 signalling in HIV-1 cell entry arrived upon using novel specific inhibitory agents. ZCL278 acts by selectively blocking interactions between Cdc42 and the Cdc42-specific GEF Intersectin, likely predominantly preventing (N-) WASP-Arp2/3 signalling. IPA-3 is a small molecule inhibitor of downstream Cdc42 signalling. infection of resting T-cells constitutes the principle barrier to cure. entry into resting T-cells is considered a fusogenic process. however, the static cortical actin found in this subset should constitute a barrier to successful infection. the intracellular migration of HIV-1 was thought to take place via the process of actin-treadmilling driven by the de-phosphorylated cofilin. later work would further characterise this as being an Arp2/3-dependent process. subsequent attempts to specifically inhibit Rac1 activity have provided results discredit a leading role for this particular GTPase. work from Spear et al. features an updated model that simply allows for viral induction of any of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 signalling upon gp120 binding. the current Cofilin/Arp2/3 signalling model proposes a shared importance for all major Rho GTPases in HIV-1 cell entry. this is unlikely to be a sufficiently detailed picture, and is reflective of the overlapping activities of the Rho GTPases. at the highest doses used of 50 M, the infectivity of X4 and R5 tropic pseudo-type viruses was reduced to 29.64% (X4) and 30.43% (R5) in TZM-bl and to 22.96% for X4-tropic viruses in PM1 cells. the broader-acting ML141 showed almost no inhibitory effect on pseudo-type virus infectivity. the current Cofilin/Arp2/3 signalling model proposes a shared importance for all major Rho GTPases in HIV-1 cell entry. this is reflective of the overlapping activities of the Rho GTPases and ongoing difficulties in targeting each specifically. the infectivity of X4 and R5 tropic pseudo-type viruses was reduced to 29.64% (X4) and 30.43% (R5) in TZM-bl and PM1 cells. the broader-acting ML141 showed almost no inhibitory effect on pseudo-type virus infectivity. ML141 has blanket inhibitory effect on all Cdc42 activity. the use of Cdc42 in the cell entry of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Ebola virus (EBOV) and various Rotavirus (RV) and Coronavirus (CoV) strains are discussed in this review. a theory of macropinocytotic entry has been proposed by Krzyzaniak et al. [53] that clearly demonstrates a primary role for Cdc42 in RSV cell-entry. the group investigated the effect of various actin-disrupting agents on RSV infection. RRV entry as a dynamin-dependent and clathrin-, caveolae-independent process. other strains of RRV (TFR-41, UK, and Wa) were characterised and utilised clathrin-dependent processes. despite differences substantially, all RV entry processes share a common Cdc42-dependence. ebola Virus EBOV cell entry is known to be mediated by the fusion glycoprotein. evidence suggesting Rho family GTPase involvement was first identified by Quinn et al. [66]. rSV was originally believed to enter target cells in a fusogenic manner via the RSV fusion (RSV-F) glycoprotein found in the viral envelope. this theory was evidenced by initial dequenching assays, in which fluorescent lipid probes in target cell plasma membranes dequenched when incubated in RSV virions. however, recent studies suggest that the entry process may involve endocytotic processes too. rhesus rotavirus (RRV) is one of the more extensively studied RV strains. early attempts to determine its entry process using lysosomotropic agents and endosomal trafficking blockers demonstrated that the entry process did not follow the classical endocytotic pathway. negative variants of Cdc42 in target cells inhibit infection with the clathrin-dependent RV UK strain too. clathrin- and caveolae-independent entry pathways for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [62], lipid-raft and caveolae-mediated entry in human CoV strains [63] and classical clathrin endocytosis in the commonly studied mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) c42 signalling in MHV cell entry is known to be mediated by the fusion glycoprotein. current opinion holds that entry can be either via clathrin-endocytosis or macropinocytosis. study of various Cdc42-inhibitors in HIV-1 seems to have demonstrated that inhibition of all Cdc42 function may result in dysregulation of other Rho family GTPases. this suggests Cdc42 use in many more viral species is deserving of reinvestigation. this review identified two specific scenarios of Cdc42-signalling induction in cell entry processes. a particular Cdc42 pathway can be identified as uniting multiple RNA viruses in the studies mentioned here. inhibition of constituents, and presumed specific targeting of the entire pathway via ZCL278, has been shown to inhibit infectivity in HIV-1, CoV and RSV."}
