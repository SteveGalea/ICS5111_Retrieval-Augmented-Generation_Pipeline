{"summary": "human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) was discovered in 2005 by large scale sequencing in nasopharyngeal aspirates from young children. it is a respiratory virus associated with acute respiratory tract infections in young children. it is one of the leading causes of hospitalization of young children in developed countries. a recent longitudinal study in children documented a clear association between acute primary HBoV1 infection and respiratory symptoms. the virus was tentatively classified as a member of genus Bocavirus in the subfamily Parvovirinae of the Parvoviridae family. the genus Bocavirus includes bovine parvovirus type 1 (BPV1). za virus (Villenave et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2011), respiratory syncytial virus (Villenave et al., 2012), human coronaviruses (Pyrc et al., 2010, Sims et al., 2005), and human rhinovirus type C (Hao et al., 2012). in 2008, Dijkman et al. demonstrated that HBoV1 in mucilAir HAE was cultured in a millicell insert of 0.6 cm2. both cultures were derived from healthy human primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells cultured in an air-liquid interphase (ALI) both cultures were derived from healthy human primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells. aliquots of 100 l of apical sample and 50 l of basolateral sample were collected. all the harvested aliquots were stored at 4 \u00b0C for quantification of viral DNA as gc. a rat anti-HBoV1 NS1 polyclonal antibody was developed previously in-house. anti-ZO-1 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and anti-tubulin IV (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) antibodies were used for detecting tight junction and cilia. HBoV1 virions were collected from apical washes of HBoV1-infected primary B-HAE. for apical infection of MucilAir HAE, HBoV1 was diluted in 200 l of mucilAir medium to achieve an MOI of 100 gc/cell. after incubation for 2 h, the apical chamber of the infected HAE ALI was washed three times with 400 the basolateral inoculums were removed and washed three times with PBS (1 ml and 0.5 ml for EpiAirway and MucilAir, respectively), followed by supplementation of fresh media. progeny virion release was monitored daily by quantification of viral gc in samples collected from the basolateral chamber at a volume of 100 l. anti-tubulin IV antibodies were used for detecting tight junction and cilia. TEER of both mock- and HBoV1-infected HAE cultures was measured using an epithelial volt-ohm meter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 11 days p.i., the apical chambers of three infected EpiAirway HAE cultures were washed with 200 l of PBS to collect the apically washed cells. a total of 600 l of the sample was concentrated to 200 l. images were taken with an Eclipse C1 Plus confocal microscope. TEER decreased 3.5-fold by the end of infection. a few epithelial cells were washed off in the apical chamber of HBoV1-infected HAE. by the end of the infection, -tubulin IV (a marker of cilia) was detected. lateral infection also caused significant epithelial damage. lateral infection also caused cilia loss and destruction of tight junction. apically at a level of 2 104 gc/l at 3 days p.i., reached a peak of 7 106 gc/l at 9 days p.i., gradually decreased to 2 105 gc/l at 26 days p.i. virions were released much more slowly in early infection. the TEER was detected to monitor the epithelial barrier function of the mucilAir HAE affected by HBoV1 infection. after HBoV1 infection, it decreased further by 2- to 3-fold. at 26 days p.i., al least one third of the cells in the infected HAE expressed HBoV1 NS1. HBoV1 infects EpiAirway HAE persistently at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 gc/l. progeny virions released from the apical surface at 1 106 gc/l. Virus was not detected in mock-infected EpiAirway HAE. a total of 600 l of the sample was concentrated to 200 l. it was then cytospun onto a slide followed by immunofluorescence analysis. images were taken with an Eclipse C1 Plus confocal microscope. a gradual virus release from both the apical and basolateral surface was observed from 1 to 11 days p.i. a gradual virus release from both the apical and basolateral surface was observed from 1 to 11 days p.i. the TEER of HBoV1-infected HAE was monitored at the indicated days p.i. the cells were visualized by confocal microscopy at a magnification of 40. the cells were visualized by confocal microscopy at a magnification of 40. mucilAir HAE was infected with HBoV1 from either the apical (A) or basolateral (B) surface at an MOI of 100 gc/l. at the indicated days p.i., progeny virions were collected from both the apical and basolateral chambers. apically- or basolaterally infected MucilAir HAE lost cilia and the tight junction, as shown by staining with anti-tubulin IV and anti-ZO1 antibodies. the stained cells were visualized by confocal microscopy at magnifications of 40 and 100, as indicated. virions released from both infected MucilAir and EpiAirway HAE cultures. HBoV1 infection can be persistent in primary HAE for at least 50 days p.i. previous studies have identified the presence of episomal covalently closed circular (ccc) viral DNA. in the HAE cultures we tested, there was a higher expression level of cilia in MucilAir HAE than in EpiAirway HAE. by the end of infection, all the cilia in the infected HAE of both types were lost, although only one third of the cells showed NS1 expression. further histology analyses of the airway epithelia were not successful in either frozen section or paraffin-embedded section. mucilAir HAE was cultured in a Transwell insert of 0.33 cm2 (Costar), while EpiAirway HAE was cultured in a Millicell insert of 0.6 cm2 (Millipore) both HAE cultures are suitable model systems to study HBoV1 for many laboratories."}
