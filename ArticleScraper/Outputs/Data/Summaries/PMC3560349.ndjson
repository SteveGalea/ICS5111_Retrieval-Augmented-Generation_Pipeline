{"summary": "plant viruses predominantly have positive sense, single-stranded RNA genomes. many viral inclusion bodies have been revealed to be viruses factories. these viral structures are now mostly referred to as viral replication complexes. the functions of VRCs are more complex than simply functioning to anchor replicase proteins to membranes. in animal viruses, viral packaging may be closely linked to viral egress via the secretory pathway and budding from the plasma membrane. electron microscopy is limited in its ability to localize specific macromolecules within VRCs. this is more easily done using fluorescence microscopy coupled to fluorescently labeled antibodies. confocal microscopy has approximately 50- to 100-fold lower resolution than electron microscopy. three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) is a widefield imaging approach that is amenable to most specimens suitable for confocal microscopy. in 3D-SIM, a diffraction grating is superimposed upon the sample, and rotated during image acquisition. this is an approximate two-fold increase in resolution over confocal microscopy, but in practical terms provides a significant increase in biological detail. virus X-body potato virus X is a (+)ssRNA virus important for agriculture. it serves as a model virus for analysis of RNA silencing and virus movement. it is a vector for protein overexpression and knockdown and as a virus-induced gene silencing model. TGB1 is an RNA helicase that functions as a translational activator. TGB1 also recruits the two other viral MPs, TGB2 and TGB3 to the X-body. the X-body can be larger than the nucleus, 10\u201315 m across. it contains so-called \"laminate inclusions\" that are characteristic of PVX infection. inclusions consist of beaded or smooth sheets roughly 3 nm thick. the X-body is formed by gradual accumulation of the ER-derived, TGB2/3-containing granules around the TGB1 beaded sheets. encapsidated vRNA localizes to whorls that tightly encircle the inclusions. in the absence of TGB1, no X-body is formed. in uninfected cells, ectopically expressed TGB1 can recruit TGB2 and TGB3 into a \u201cpseudo-VRC\u201d which has a similar structure to the X-body. we used 3D-SIM microscopy to analyze the reorganized membrane structures of the PVX X-body at higher resolution. viral RNA (vRNA)-dependent RNA polymerases are usually active as oligomeric arrays. the host membranes they occupy serve as scaffolds to assemble these complexes. but the functions of VRCs are more complex than simply functioning to anchor replicase proteins to membranes. electron microscopy is limited in its ability to localize specific macromolecules within VRCs. this is more easily done using fluorescence microscopy coupled to fluorescently labeled antibodies or fluorescent protein fusions. confocal laser scanning microscopy provided the highest resolution possible in fluorescence microscopy. three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) is a widefield imaging approach that is amenable to most specimens suitable for confocal microscopy. in 3D-SIM, a diffraction grating is superimposed upon the sample, and rotated during image acquisition. this constitutes an approximate two-fold increase in resolution over confocal microscopy. the potato virus X is a (+)ssRNA virus important for agriculture. it serves as a model virus for analysis of RNA silencing and virus movement. the PVX genome contains five open reading frames (ORFs) encoding five viral proteins. all three TGBs and CP are needed for virus movement. CP is found in plasmodesmata and translocated between cells. it is a part of a movement-competent ribonucleoprotein complex. PVX X-bodies appear from about 1\u20132 days post-infection. the X-body can be larger than the nucleus, 10\u201315 m across. older infections typically contain only one. beaded sheets resemble ribosome-studded ER membranes, but no lipids were found. treatment with potassium permanganate destroyed them, indicating they are proteinaceous. encapsidated PVX virions surround the X-body. in uninfected cells, ectopically expressed TGB1 can recruit TGB2 and TGB3 into a \u201cpseudo-VRC\u201d. in uninfected cells, ectopically expressed TGB1 can recruit TGB2 and TGB3 into a \u201cpseudo-VRC\u201d which has a similar structure to the X-body. a transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana line expressing ER-GFP (Haseloff et al., 1997) and a transgenic Nicotiana tabacum line expressing Golgi (ST)-GFP (Boevink et al., 1998) were described previously. expression in plants Infectious PVX RNA was obtained by T7 in vitro transcription from plasmid constructs. the peels were mounted in Citifluor AF1 antifade medium (Agar Scientific) the samples were sealed with nail varnish, and viewed through a cover slip for 3D-SIM imaging with an OMX version 2 microscope. a transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana line expressing ER-GFP and a transgenic Nicotiana tabacum line expressing Golgi (ST)-GFP were described previously. expression in plants Infectious PVX RNA was obtained by T7 in vitro transcription from plasmid constructs containing PVX.GFP-CP and PVX.mCherry-CP modified cDNA copies. the samples were sealed with nail varnish, and viewed through a cover slip for 3D-SIM imaging with an OMX version 2 microscope. the samples were sealed with nail varnish, and viewed through a cover slip for 3D-SIM imaging with an OMX version 2 microscope. the diameter of individual PVX particles is 13 nm (Movie S1 in Supplementary Materials) the viral cages formed a complex interconnected network of virions that surrounded host and viral structures at its center. many of the TGB1 inclusions appeared to be arranged as flattened, undulating \u201cribbons\u201d within the X-body (Figures 3B\u2013D; Movie S2 in Supplementary Materials). some of the TGB1 inclusions appeared to be arranged as flattened, undulating \u201cribbons\u201d within the X-body. TGB2- and TGB3-labeled membrane compartments in the X-body. live-cell confocal image of co-bombarded TGB1-mCherry and GFP-TGB2. the granules produced by TGB2 and TGB3 are in fact fine membrane hoops of remodeled tubular ER. these structures had the characteristic granular appearance (Figures 4A,F) but under 3D-SIM they appeared as donut-shaped loops. 3D-SIM data indicate that these different modified ER compartments are comprised of dense arrays of membrane hoops containing either only TGB2 or both TGB2 and TGB3. these hoops probably correspond to previously reported TGB2-induced, ER-derived granules. ER is labeled with lumenally targeted HDEL-GFP. super-resolution images of remodeled ER in the X-body of cells infected with PVX. n: nucleus. (B,C), super-resolution images of remodeled ER in the X-body. a sialyl transferase (ST)-GFP membrane marker (Boevink et al., 1998) revealed a ring-shaped structure. such details are not visible in conventional confocal microscopy. the ring structure corresponds to the outer rim of trans-Golgi compartments. the fluorescent virions are found in fibrillar \u201ccages\u201d surrounding the X-body. we observed large bundles of virus filaments but were unable to resolve the fine structure of the virion cages. the diameter of individual PVX particles is 13 nm. these correspond well to the circularly arranged TGB1 beaded sheets reported earlier from EM studies. many of the TGB1 inclusions appeared to be arranged as flattened, undulating \u201cribbons\u201d within the X-body (Figures 3C,D). the isolated patches of TGB3 correspond to the aggregated TGB2/3 granules of earlier infection stages. similar compartments were observed with ER-GFP and Golgi-GFP markers. live-cell confocal images of TGB1-mCherry and TGB3-GFP show the occurrence of TGB3 granules or aggregates within the X-body. the structures are resolved as hoops similar in size to those labeled by TGB2 and concentrated in clusters or patches outside of the TGB1 inclusion. lateral resolution of less than 100 nm was achieved by 3D-SIM in these images. TGB2 hoops formed dense arrays resembling \u201cchain mail\u201d in the center of X-bodies, wrapped around the TGB1 inclusions. the individual tubules of the ER network are barely discernible in the X-body even though they are unaltered in the surrounding cytoplasm. however, at high magnification, the diffuse membrane aggregations within the X-body consist of the same membrane hoops observed for TGB2 and TGB3. 3D-SIM resolved individual Golgi bodies labeled with a sialyl transferase (ST)-GFP membrane marker (Boevink et al., 1998) and revealed a ring-shaped structure (Figures 6E,F) however the Golgi rings were clearly different from the ER-derived membrane hoops observed with TGB2 and TGB3. new data show that TGB2-labeled ER membranes consist of small hoops, which cluster within the X-body to form an extremely dense network. a lumenal ER marker labeled small hoops in the X-body. the previously observed ER-derived TGB2/3 granules may also be individual or small clusters of hoops branching out from the cortical ER. the ability of the transmembrane TGB2/3 proteins of potexviruses to influence the structure of the ER requires further study. the ability of the transmembrane TGB2/3 proteins of potexviruses to influence the structure of the ER requires further study. a potential role of recruited host elements is to protect the virus from the plant defense mechanisms by wrapping it in plant membranes. it is possible that the recruited host membranes enlarge the surface area for the replicating virus, making replication more efficient because of the production of increased concentrations of important viral components. reorganization of encapsidated virions within the X-body probably reflects movement-related activities of these proteins at earlier infection stages. CP synthesis and packaging of vRNA take place at the periphery of the X-body, whereas the location of the TGB proteins, in particular TGB1, may be influenced by both their targeting properties and their site of synthesis within the X-body. ER membranes consist of small hoops, which cluster within the X-body to form an extremely dense network. a lumenal ER marker also labeled small hoops in the X-body. previously observed ER-derived TGB2/3 granules. observations suggest that TGB2 may remodel the ER by inducing a localized increase of network branching. the ability of the transmembrane TGB2/3 proteins of potexviruses to influence the structure of the ER requires further study. it will be interesting to see if this class of proteins is recruited to the X-body during PVX accumulation. it is possible that the recruited host membranes enlarge the surface area for the replicating virus. a super-resolution localization of the PVX replicase will be required. the reorganization of ER membranes may play a role in this. CP synthesis and packaging of vRNA take place at the periphery of the X-body. the location of the TGB proteins, in particular TGB1, may be influenced by both their targeting properties and their site of synthesis within the X-body. this is beyond the technical limits of current localization techniques. the rapid development of new FPs is likely to overcome such limitations in the near future. the increased resolution gained, for example on Golgi bodies, demonstrates the utility of this approach outside virology. 0.2213 0.03074 0.00769 0.2049 0.2376 0.17 0.28 Total 45 0.1629 0.05229 0.00780 0.1472 0.1786 0.10 0.28 Test of homogeneity of variances Levene statistic df1 df2 Sig.
