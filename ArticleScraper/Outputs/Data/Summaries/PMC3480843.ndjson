{"summary": "toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite infecting almost all warm-blooded animals, including birds. little is known of T. gondii infection in peafowls worldwide. toxoplasmosis is one of the most common parasitic zoonoses, caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. the protozoan parasite can infect almost all warm-blooded animals, including birds. a third of the world population and 7.88% of population in china have been infected. peafowls include two Asiatic species of flying birds in the genus Pavo of the pheasant family Phasianidae. blue peafowl (Pavo cristatus) is widely distributed naturally in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia, but the green peafowl (P. muticus) is only naturally distributed in Yunnan Province and Tibetan areas in China. the survey was conducted in two administrative divisions in the province, Kunming City and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture (Banna for short) it has a mean annual rainfall of 1,010 mm, an annual sunshine period of 2,250 h, and an annual frost-free period of 230 d. a chicken serum sample obtained through experimental infection by T. gondii with a MAT antibody titer of 1:640 [28] was used as positive control. serological examination sera were examined by the modified agglutination test (MAT) to detect antibodies against T. gondii. 0.05 was considered statistically significant between levels within factors and interactions. the investigated regions Yunnan Province is the most southwestern province of china. the average temperature is around 15\u00b0C during winter and 24\u00b0C during summer. production systems were kept in small herds of 20\u2013100 animals in wired chambers. 74 peafowls (69 blue peafowls and 5 green peafowls) were all free-range fed on peafowl gardens. ages of peafowls were classified into two categories according to their growth cycle. serological examination sera was examined by the modified agglutination test (MAT) to detect antibodies against T. gondi a probability (P) value 0.05 was considered statistically significant between levels within factors and interactions. peafowl serum samples were positive for T. gondii antibodies by MAT at the cut-off titer of 1:5, with titers of 1:5 in 17 samples (48.57%), 1:10 in 5 samples (14.29%), 1:20 in 4 samples (11.43%), 1:40 in 5 samples (14.29%) and 1:80 in 4 samples (11.43%). in the present study, most of the infected birds had low titers. MAT is considered a sensitive and specific method for detecting T. gondii antibodies in avian species. but the cut-off titer of MAT for positive infection in birds is not determined. the association between risk factors and T. gondii seropositivity was analyzed. no significant difference was observed between the adolescent peafowls (6.74%) and the adult peafowls (6.67%) the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in stray cats in Yunnan was 26.79% (unpublished data), indicating a high risk as a source of T. gondii infection for animals and humans. millions of tourists visit the Kunming zoo every year and visitors can feed the free-range birds. peafowls of both genders in a longer observation period and the isolation of T. gondii from infected peafowls will be considered in the future. the prevalene is highly associated with geographical regions, which raise significant public health concerns. authors thank Dr J.
