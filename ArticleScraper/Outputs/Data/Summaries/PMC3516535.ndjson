{"summary": "antimicrobial peptides are expressed in leukocytes and/or epithelia of most mammals studied. -defensins share similar peptide folds and are widely expressed in mammals including humans. -defensins have been isolated from Old World monkeys. specific neutralization of RTDs in lysates of macaque neutrophil granules markedly reduced antimicrobial activities of this preparation against E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans. the protective effect in vivo correlated with the reduction of pulmonary inflammation and the suppression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung homogenates. chimpanzees were housed in social groups in indoor/outdoor housing. they were fed standard monkey chow supplemented with fruits and vegetables twice daily. no primates were sacrificed in this study. cell culture THP-1 monocytic cells were grown and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. peripheral blood leukocytes were harvested from 10\u201315 ml whole blood after centrifugation at 200 g. TNF assay Peptides (RTDs 1\u20135, human neutrophil -defensins) were aliquoted into wells of 12- or 24-well plates. wells were inoculated with 1105 CFU/ml S. aureus or 100 CFU/ml E. coli. LPS Neutralization Assay E. coli 0111:B4 LPS (Lonza), dissolved in endotoxin-free water (2 effective units/ml) was incubated with 0\u201310 g/ml of RTD-1 or 0\u201310 g/ml polymyxin B (Sigma) dissolved in 0.01% HOAc in a 50 l reaction mixture for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. a basic metabolic panel was performed on serum samples obtained by cardiac puncture at the time of euthanasia. animals were infused with escalating doses of RTD-1 (0.02, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 respectively) samples from each animal were also obtained on days 21, 28, and 60 and similarly analyzed. groups of four mice from each treatment group were euthanized at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 hours following intraperitoneal challenge. blood was collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA-tubes and plasma was prepared by a two-step centrifugation. cytokines/chemokines were quantified using a mouse-specific Milliplex cytokine/chemokine kit as described above. human subjects Blood was obtained from healthy adult volunteers who provided written consent to participate. the study and consent form were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. d anesthetics were used for surgeries, recommended analgesics were used for post-operative care. animals were fed standard monkey chow supplemented with fruits and vegetables twice daily. no primates were sacrificed in this study. sulfonic acid (PIPES), pH 7.4 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) correlated with colony forming units on tryptic soy agar plates. toll-like receptor agonists were obtained from Invivogen (San Diego, CA) chemokines were quantified using a milliplex MAP kit on a bioRad bioplex HTF Luminex reader. wells were inoculated with 1105 CFU/ml S. aureus or 100 CFU/ml E. coli. samples containing peptide or bacteria/LPS were placed on opposite sides of plate well. LPS Neutralization Assay E. coli 0111:B4 LPS (Lonza) was incubated with 0\u201310 g/ml of RTD-1 or 0\u201310 g/ml polymyxin B (Sigma) dissolved in 0.01% HOAc in a 50 l reaction mixture for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. to each sample 25 l of Limulus amoebocyte lysate was added and incubated for 10 illiam R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital was performed on serum samples obtained by cardiac puncture at the time of euthanasia. animals were infused with escalating doses of RTD-1 (0.02, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 respectively) samples from each animal were also obtained on days 21, 28, and 60. mice were euthanized at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 12 hours following intraperitoneal challenge. blood was collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA-tubes. plasma was prepared by a two-step centrifugation (200 g for 10 min) ssRNA stimulation of human leukocytes induced cytokines/chemokines similar to those observed in mouse SARS-CoV pneumonitis. the simultaneous addition of 10 g/ml of RTD-1 reduced supernatant levels of each of the above listed cytokine/chemokines with suppression from 68% (IL-8) to 95% (IL-1). coagulated blood were stimulated for 4 h with a panel of TLR agonists. levels of ten soluble cytokines/chemokines were measured using a milliplex MAP kit. IL-6 levels were 40% increase in IL-10 and no suppression of induced levels of chemokines CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1), or CCL4 (MIP-1). RTD-1 alone had little effect on cytokine/chemokine release by leukocytes with the exception of VEGF. EDTA-anti-coagulated blood was stimulated for 4 h with live E. coli cells (\u2022), S. aureus 502a () or E. coli K12 LPS. blood incubated for 4 h with RTD-1 alone shown as (). RTD-1 modulation of leukocyte responses was analyzed following simultaneous mixing of peptide, inflammatory stimulus, and whole blood. mixing experiments were performed wherein blood, peptide, and E. coli cells were pre-incubated for up to 2 h. this is consistent with the effect of RTD-1 on TNF release when RTD-1, E. coli, and blood were mixed simultaneously. the absence of viable bacteria in samples containing RTD-1 revealed that E. coli was efficiently killed by the peptide by within 30 min. the potent inhibition of E. coli-stimulated TNF release by blood leukocytes at T = 0 further demonstrates the rapid blockade of bacteria-stimulated release by RTD-1. data are average of N = 2\u20133 experiments. anti-TNF activities of -defensin Isoforms RTD-1 is the most abundant of six -defensin isoforms expressed in neutrophils and monocytes of rhesus monkeys. the reduction of cytokine expression was not the result of cytotoxic effects on the target cells. trypan blue staining confirmed that cell viability was >99% at the end of each incubation interval. VEGF-A expression increased following RTD-1 treatment. the only detected tissue effect associated with RTD-1 administration was focal, non-erythematous swelling that appeared at the injection site in 4/4 mice (by day 3) in the 160 mg/kg group and 2/4 animals (at day 4) in the 40 mg/kg group. no anti-RTD-1 antibody was detected in samples from either animal. repetitive (8\u201315 injections) subcutaneous challenge of DA rats with RTD-1 produced no anti-RTD-1 antibody after 8 weeks. the peptide is completely stable to heating (100\u00b0C, 30 min) untreated bacteremic animals had marked elevations in IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, CXCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL5, TNF, and VEGF. treatment with RTD-1 resulted in reductions of all cytokines, but only the decreases of IL-1, IL-1, and VEGF were statistically significant. a single i.v. dose of RTD-1 (5 mg/ml) after CLP surgery resulted in long term survival of 10 of 11 mice. 4 of 5 mice that were not treated until 24 h post CLP also recovered and were clinically normal through the end of the trial. ssRNA stimulation of human leukocytes induced cytokines/chemokines. the simultaneous addition of 10 g/ml of RTD-1 reduced supernatant levels of each of the above listed cytokine/chemokines with suppression ranging from 68% (IL-8) to 95% (IL-1) HKLM (TLR2), flagellin (TLR5), LPS (TLR4) and live E. coli cells. RTD-1 markedly reduced IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, TNF, CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL3 (MIP1) and CCL4 (MIP1) levels. a physiologic mixture of human -defensins (HNP 1\u20133) had no TNF-suppressive effects on E. coli-stimulated PBLs. no cytotoxicity was detected in these incubations as evidenced by a lack of trypan blue staining of leukocytes. mixing of RTD-1 with polymyxin B showed no additive or antagonistic effects. this is consistent with the finding that RTD-1 inhibits endotoxin-stimulated release of TNF via mechanisms other than LPS neutralization. pre-mixing of blood and E. coli cells for up to 2 h, followed by addition of RTD-1, showed a time-dependent increase of TNF release in both control and peptide containing mixtures. however, at each time point the presence of RTD-1 reduced TNF levels (46\u201393%; Fig. 4B) blood diluted 110 in RPMI was pre-stimulated with 100 CFU/ml E. coli cells for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. whole blood was pre-stimulated with 10 g/ml of RTD-1 (\u2022) or solvent () and incubated for another 4 h. RTDs 2 and 5 were substantially more effective than RTD-1, whereas RTDs 3 and 4 were less active. the hierarchy of anti-TNF potencies was the same as that obtained in blood experiments. a physiologic mixture of HNP 1\u20133 also lacked TNF inhibitory activity. ated blood diluted 110 in RPMI was stimulated for 4 h with live E. coli (100 CFU/ml) and RTD-1 (\u2022), RTD-2(), RTD-3 (), RTD-4 (), RTD-5 (), or HNP-2 () at the indicated concentrations. no acute toxicity was observed in animals receiving subcutaneous doses of RTD-1 (up to 160 mg/kg, the highest dose tested) multiple injections with 40 mg/kg RTD-1 (B) or 160 mg/kg RTD-1 (C) produce a lobular panniculitis with fat necrosis. no clinical or injection site effects were observed at any dosing level during the period of the study. time zero concentrations of RTD-1 were identical within the limits of method precision. after 72 h of incubation, RTD-1 levels were 112% (serum), 93% (plasma) and 81% (albumin) Consistent with these data, RTD-1 is also highly stable in whole blood from humans, rats, and mice for at least 24 h. mice were challenged with 8108 CFU E. coli K12 and treated simultaneously with s.c. injection of saline (\u2022; n = 13) or 5 mg/kg RTD-1 (; n = 13) plasma cytokines/chemokines were quantified as described in Methods. 90% of the saline treated animals died within 5 days of CLP surgery. -defensins possess potent anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in vivo. in a previous study, RTD-1 suppressed pulmonary bronchiolitis and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by SARS-CoV. peptide-leukocyte interactions may disrupt the mobilization of TNF from the surface of stimulated cells. -defensin blockade may suppress subsequent inflammatory responses. suppression of RTD-mediated TNF release was a common feature of antigen-stimulated leukocyte responses in vitro. -defensins inhibit VEGF-dependent neovascularization. it is of interest to note the human neutrophil -defensin inhibits VEGF-A. most effective (RTD-5) and least effective (RTD-3) peptides have a net charge of +4. -defensins have pro-inflammatory properties that include up regulation of TNF and IL-1 expression by monocytes [34], stimulation of TNF, IL-6, and IL-12 expression in myeloid dendritic cells. bacterial challenge and therapeutic effects in each case were attributed to anti-endotoxic activities of the respective peptides. in either E. coli peritonitis or CLP sepsis, multiple doses of PG-1 had little endotoxin-neutralizing effect."}
