{"summary": "the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine was made available to adults and children aged 10 years and over. participants who were vaccinated against the seasonal influenza were more likely to receive the vaccine. participants who were vaccinated were more likely to receive the vaccine. the world health organisation raised the pandemic alert level to phase 5 on April 29th. the first wave lasted 18 weeks in Australia from mid-May to late September 2009. the rate of hospitalisations was 23 per 100,000 population, with indigenous Australians overrepresented. a cross-sectional intercept survey was conducted in Sydney, australia. participants and sampling Members of the public were approached in public shopping and pedestrian malls. participants were excluded if the researcher experienced communication difficulties with them or they were not residents of Sydney. participants were asked eight items about recent influenza-related behaviours. three items measured recent behaviour and were phrased \"Over the past month, I have... because of swine flu\" a further five items assessed attitudes of participants towards the vaccine on a five point Likert-type scale. survey pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was referred to by its vernacular alternative \"swine flu\" in the survey. four items assessed participants perceived personal risk level and the risk level they perceived for the general community, perceived seriousness of the disease if it was contracted, and knowledge of cases of H1N1 amongst family and friends. the questions on perception of risk had been pilot tested prior to inclusion in our first community H1N1 study. participants were asked eight items about recent influenza-related behaviours. three items related to recommended pathogen avoidance activities and increased cleaning or disinfecting of surfaces. personal risk for H1N1 influenza perceived as high to very high, perceived affect on health as very to extremely affected, undertaking more than one behavioural change due to H1N1. analysis was performed on all written responses to reasons for supporting/opposing pandemic. 61.4% of participants rated pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza as \"somewhat affecting\" their own health. a quarter thought their health would be \"extremely\" to \"very seriously\" affected. the average Sydney resident's risk of acquiring H1N1 followed similar pattern. do you think the average Sydney resident has of catching influenza A H1N1 or \"swine flu\" during this pandemic? not at all 7.3% (46) Somewhat affect 61.4% (385) Extremely-Very seriously affect 24.5% (154) Unsure/Not specified 6.7% (42) I do not understand what is happening with this \"swine flu\" pandemic Agree 43.7% (275) Disagree 13.4% (84) Unsure/Not specified 17.1% (107) two or more changes to behaviour were reported in response to the swine flu situation by just under half (45.8%, 272/594) of the participants. most common changes included hand cleansing through increased hand washing (48.3%, 303/627) and the use of alcoholic hand gel (37.6%, 236/627) people who reported their risk level of acquiring \"swine flu\" was \"high\" to \"very high\" participants who believed they were personally at risk were 1.9 times more likely (COR 1.9, CI95 1.2-3.0, p = 0.005) to intend to be vaccinated. there was no significant difference in vaccine acceptance between participants who reported cases of H1N1 amongst friends or family members. behavioural change due to H1N1 situation 60.6% (208) 41.2% (117) 2.0 (1.4-2.8) [0.001] 1.8 (1.2-2.5) [0.003]* Perceives H1N1 situation as serious 55.7% (191) 27.5% (78) 3.1 (2.2-4.4) [0.001] 2.5 (1.7-3.6) [0.003]* * Adjusted for other variables in the model (gender, age, ethnicity, received vaccination for 2008/2009 seasons, the \"swine flu\" vaccine may cause the \"flu\" in some people Agree 40.2% (252) Disagree 17.9% (112) Unsure 39.6% (248) Not specified 2.2% (15) the \"swine flu\" vaccine will stop. 491/627 participants classified themselves at high risk of influenza. some believed the novel vaccine was the same as the \"normal influenza vaccine\" many people believed that the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza situation was not serious enough. australia's independent medicines' regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), announced it was to register the CSL Biotherapies pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine (N = 246). less than 20% of our sample perceived that they were at significantly high risk of acquiring H1N1. pre-pandemic surveys and post-SARS studies have illustrated a dose-response relationship between severity of pandemic and public response. over half of our participants changed at least one, and commonly two, behaviours in response to the situation. this is in stark contrast with the findings of Rubin et al [13], who reported that only forty nine people (4.9%) engaged in one or more of the avoidance behaviours. in australia, the annual influenza vaccine is only provided free to Indigenous people aged over 50. the vaccine is only provided free to those aged 15 to 49 who are at high risk. in comparison, receipt of the vaccine was three times higher in those aged 65 and over. participants have a lack of understanding about the process of developing seasonal influenza vaccine based on the probability of strains. educational materials distributed about the vaccine should focus on its safety record, manufacturing and the similarities between seasonal influenza vaccination and pandemic vaccine. this study has several limitations. HS participated in the design of the study and survey, undertook the distribution and collection, performed the analysis and drafted the manuscript. KW/CL/DV helped perform the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript."}
