{"summary": "IAV is a segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. the surface glycoproteins, hemaggluttinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are used to type IAV. there are a large number of IAV H1 and H3 genetic and antigenic variants co-circulating. bronchiseptica can colonize the respiratory tract of mammals, including mice, rabbits, dogs and pigs. kennel cough in dogs and atrophic rhinitis in pigs can lead to whooping cough. colonization without clinical presentation has been documented. LAIV administration alters colonization dynamics of important bacterial pathogens (23). a heterologous -cluster H1N2 swine IAV isolate (A/swine/Minnesota/03012/2010; MN10) was used as challenge virus for attenuation. the LAIV inoculum titered at 5.5 (log10) TCID50/ml and the MN10 challenge virus titered at 5.8 (log10) TCID50/ml. pigs received 2 ml of LAIV or challenge virus at each indicated inoculation dates. blood was collected on days 7, 21 (immediately prior to LAIV boost) and 28 (1 week post-boost) pigs in groups 2, 3, 5 and 6 were challenged with heterologous IAV by the IN route. pigs in groups 2, 3, 5 and 6 were challenged with heterologous IAV. BALF was collected by lavaging all lobes with 50 ml of MEM. sections of lung were collected for microscopic evaluation. trachea wash was performed in 3 ml MEM. samples were serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and plated on blood agar. aliquot of BALF was also plated on brain-heart infusion agar supplemented with 0.01 % NAD (w/v) data analysis A two-factor repeated measures mixed effects model analysis of log differences between the treatment groups Bb/LAIV and Bb/NV. a dpi repeated measures factor using pigs as subjects was used to evaluate statistical differences in Bb nasal colonization (SAS, v9.2) the LAIV used surface genes HA and NA from pandemic influenza (H1N1, A/NY/18/2009) and internal genes from A/Turkey/Ohio/313053/2004. a heterologous -cluster H1N2 swine IAV isolate (A/swine/Minnesota/03012/2010; MN10) was used as challenge virus. piglets in groups 3 and 6 were inoculated with LAIV by the intranasal (IN) route. a second dose of LAIV was administered on study day 21 (3 weeks post-LAIV priming) pigs in groups 2, 3, 5 and 6 were challenged with heterologous IAV by the IN route. bronchiseptica, NCh, Non-Challenged. b N, number of pigs in indicated group. bronchiseptica, NCh, non-Challenged. b N, number of pigs in indicated group. log (agonist) vs. response-variable slope logistic model was modeled as a nonlinear function of the log10 dilution using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad software Inc, La Jolla, CA) log (agonist) vs. response-variable slope four-parameter logistic model. cell-free supernatant was collected at necropsy (dpi 5) and centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min. the amount of CCL2 (MCP-1), IL-8, IL-1, IL-10, and IFN- in the cell-free lung lavage was determined by single-plex (KingFisher Biotech) or multiplex cytokine ELISA (Aushon Biosystems), respectively. the effect of LAIV administration on B. bronchiseptica nasal colonization was assessed at various time points following LAIV administration. at the time the initial dose of LAIV was administered, which was 1 week after B. bronchiseptica inoculation, there was no significant difference in B. bronchiseptica colonization between treatment groups. only on day 42 relative to LAIV administration was there a significant difference (p 0.05) in B. bronchiseptica CFUs included in the Bb/NV group (n = 13) and group 6 pigs were used for Bb/LAIV group (n = 8) significant differences (p 0.05) in Bb CFU are noted with an asterisk (*) pigs colonized with B. bronchiseptica. groups of pigs were inoculated with B. bronchiseptica (Bb) on day7, LAIV on days 0 and 21, and subsequently challenged (Ch) with heterologous IAV as described in materials and methods. at 5 days post-infection, the percentage of lung affected with macroscopic lesions was determined and reported as percent pneumonia. the suppurative bronchitis or bronchiolitis with epithelial necrosis was reduced. however, there was peribronchiolar lymphocyte infiltration and bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) hyperplasia in the majority of LAIV/Ch pigs. pig challenged with IAV (LAIV/Ch); suppurative bronchiolitis with epithelial necrosis. submucosal lymphohistiocytic inflammation, peribronchiolar lymphocytic infiltration. alveoli filled with neutrophils and mononuclear cells, alveoli with areas of epithelial necrosis and hemorrhage. sections from some Bb/NV/Ch pigs were ably filled with neutrophils and macrophages with areas of alveolar epithelial necrosis, hemorrhage, and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. vaccinated pigs that had been infected with Bordetella and challenged with IAV had diminished bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial necrosis. however, these pigs had lesions consistent with both acute swabs collected on 5 dpi from pigs inoculated with B. bronchiseptica. there was no significant difference in colonization levels between groups. B. bronchiseptica colonization in the trachea and lung were also similar. pigs were collected on the day of IAV challenge and daily through 5 dpi. one day after intranasal IAV challenge, 100% of the NV/Ch pigs were shedding virus with an average IAV titer (log10 TCID50/ml) of 3.06 0.84. significant difference in IAV titers in nasal swabs between NV/Ch and LAIV/Ch groups at every time point as well. 83% (10/12) 42% (5/12) Bb/NV/Ch 100% (7/7) 100% (7/7) 100% (7/7) 100% (7/7) Bb/LAIV/Ch 75% (6/8) 100% (8/8) 100% (8/8) 25% (2/8) a NV, Non-Vaccinated; Ch, Challenged; LAIV, Live-Attenuated Influenza Virus; Bb, B. bronchiseptica. shedding was greater in the Bb/LAIV/Ch group compared to LAIV/Ch on days 1\u20133, no different on day 4 and by dpi 5 titers were greater in the LAIV/Ch pigs. however, on dpi 5 the average amount of virus shed from the LAIV vaccinated group was less than 0.5 log10 TCID50/ml indicative of LAIV vaccine efficacy. the average titer of IAV in the trachea and lung lavage from pigs in the LAIV/Ch group was significantly reduced compared to the NV/Ch group. protection against heterologous virus replication was also noted in the Bb/LAIV/Ch group. IgA in nasal wash specific to (A) vaccine virus and (B) challenge virus were determined using a whole virus ELISA to evaluate the impact of Bb on LAIV immunogenicity. data was analyzed using an unpaired students t-test (GraphPad Prism 6) groups of pigs were inoculated with B. bronchiseptica (Bb) on day7, LAIV on days 0 and 21, and subsequently challenged (Ch) with heterologous IAV. cytokine levels were increased primarily in pigs that had been challenged with IAV. only on day 42 relative to LAIV administration was there a significant difference (p 0.05) in B. bronchiseptica CFUs in nasal wash between Bb/LAIV and Bb/NV treatment groups. pigs were intranasally inoculated with Bb on day7 and LAIV on days 0 and 21. macroscopic lesions were detected in only 2 of the 6 pigs inoculated with only B. bronchiseptica (Bb/NV/NCh) there was not a significant increase in the percentage of gross pneumonia in the NV/Ch group when compared to the control group. pigs inoculated with IAV alone had mild lesions consistent with IAV infection characterized by suppurative bronchitis and bronchiolitis with epithelial necrosis. there was peribronchiolar lymphocyte infiltration and bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) hyperplasia in most pigs. a non-vaccinated (NV) group and a NV/non-challenged (NV/NCh) control group were included as controls. at 5 days post-infection lung sections were collected at necropsy and processed as described in materials and methods. mononuclear cells (open arrow), alveoli with areas of epithelial necrosis and hemorrhage (closed arrow head) and interstitial pneumonia (closed arrow head) showed lesions of acute Bordetellosis in a pig that had been infected with Bb and subsequently challenged with IAV. pigs that were infected with Bb and subsequently challenged with IAV had microscopic lesions consistent with both IAV and acute sections from some of the pigs in Bb/LAIV/Ch group also contained chronic lesions of interstitial pneumonia consisting of alveolar septal thickening with mononuclear cells. B. bronchiseptica respiratory tract colonization was not affected by IAV challenge, regardless of LAIV vaccine status. groups of pigs were inoculated with B. bronchiseptica (Bb) on day7, LAIV on days 0 and 21. at 5 days post-infection, nasal swab, trachea wash and lung lavage were collected from each pig at necropsy. each dot represents a single animal in that respective treatment group, with the average SEM indicated. significant difference in IAV titers in nasal swabs between NV/Ch and LAIV/Ch group was noted for days 2-5 as well. there was a significant difference in IAV titers in nasal swabs between NV/Ch and NV/Ch groups at every time point as well. groups of pigs were inoculated with B. bronchiseptica (Bb) on day7, LAIV on days 0 and 21, and challenged (Ch) with heterologous IAV as described in materials and methods. each dot represents a single animal in that respective treatment group with mean SEM shown. by dpi 4 and 5 there was not a significant difference in the percentage of pigs in the Bb/LAIV/Ch and LAIV/Ch groups shedding virus. this indicates that B. bronchiseptica infection, regardless of LAIV vaccination status, affected IAV replication in the nasal cavity. titers of IgA to both vaccine virus and challenge virus were determined using a whole virus ELISA. there was no significant difference in nasal wash IgA titers to either virus between the two vaccinated group. pigs were inoculated with B. bronchiseptica (Bb) on day7, LAIV on days 0 and 21 and nasal wash collected on day 42. levels of several cytokines were measured in the lung lavage collected at necropsy. cytokine levels were increased in non-vaccinated pigs challenged with IAV. this was also observed for IL-6 and IL-10. pigs have been procured from high health status herds that are free of many of the bacteria that can be pathogenic under some conditions (i.e., pathobiont) the majority, if not all, of experimental challenge studies in swine with LAIV use pigs that are free of many of the bacteria that can be pathogenic under some conditions. LAIV vaccination provides protection against IAV infection, which results in a reduction of secondary bacterial pneumonia (40, 41) and may limit antibiotic usage. however, intranasal administration of LAIV vaccine can alter commensal replication and colonization. however, these changes are limited to the upper respiratory tract (23, 42, 43) it is possible that LAIV administration altered the overall bacterial community structure in the upper respiratory tract of pigs. a significant increase in cytokine levels in the lungs of LAIV/Ch pigs compared to control pigs. levels of IFN-, IL-1, and IL-6 in LAIV/Ch pigs were reduced compared to NV/Ch pigs. LAIV vaccination did not prevent negative impact of IAV/B. bronchiseptica co-infection. chiseptica inoculation was minimal. however, environmental changes in the respiratory tract associated with IAV infection may have altered B. bronchiseptica gene expression. adenylate cyclase toxin disrupts bronchial epithelial integrity (54) induction of cell-mediated immunity in the lungs of pigs in the LAIV/Ch and Bb/LAIV/Ch group, but not NV/Ch group. changes in the respiratory tract associated with IAV/B. bronchiseptica co-infection, regardless of vaccine status, may hinder immune-protection. conflict of interest statement HH was funded through an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc."}
