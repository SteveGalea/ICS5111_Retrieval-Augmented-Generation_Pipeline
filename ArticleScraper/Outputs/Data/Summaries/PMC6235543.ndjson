{"summary": "the ZIKV has been suspected to be the cause of the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in around 1 per 4,000 infected adults4. a correlation between the ZIKV and testes infection/damage has been demonstrated, suggesting that the ZIKV infection, under certain circumstances, can bypass the blood-testis barrier and eventually lead to male infertility5. tetramer technology is a unique tool to elucidate the roles that antigen-specific T cells play in regulating the immune responses15. tetramer technology is a unique tool to elucidate the roles that antigen-specific T cells play in regulating the immune responses. protocol Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC. all experiments were performed following the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved animal protocols. anesthetize the immunized and ZIKV-infected mice 7 d post-inoculation, using a 5% isoflurane concentrationin 100% oxygen (with a flow rate of 1 L/min) then dip the entire mouse into 75% ethanol. Resuspend the cells with 5 mL of a red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer. stop the lysis with 10 mL of ice-cold RPMI/FBS medium. transfer 10 L of the cell suspension to a small tube. tip of sharp Iris scissors into the foramen magnum and cut laterally into the skull. try to keep the end of the scissors as superficial as possible to avoid injuring the brain. remove the brain with forceps and place it in a 15 mL tube containing 5 mL of ice-cold RPMI/10% FBS medium. switch off the brake and centrifuge the tubes at 4 \u00b0C at 800 x g for 30 min. transfer the interphase to a fresh 15-mL tube, add 10 mL of cold RPMI/10% FBS medium, and centrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. inject 500 L of 2m dissolved in a guanidine solution (30 mg/mL stock) using a syringe and inject the 2m into the refolding solution drop by drop. slowly stir the solution at 150 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. purify the protein with a S200 10/300 GL gel filtration chromatography. add the regents in the following order: 100 L of solution A [0.5M bicine (pH 8.3)], 100 L of solution B (100 mM ATP, 100 mM MgOAc, 200 biotin), 100 L of extra d-biotin (500 biotin), 20 L of BirA enzyme (60 g), 0.5 L of pepstatin (2 mg/ phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin at a mole ratio of 1:5. determine moles of the MHC/peptide complexes accounting for the protein concentration and the molar weight. divide streptavidin-phycoerythrin into 10 samples. Flow Cytometry Incubate cell suspensions at 4 \u00b0C with 0.1 L of anti-murine CD16/CD32 Fc-Receptor blocking reagent per 20 L for at least 15 min. add 20 L of the cell suspension to a 96-well plate containing 1 x 106 cells each well. gating strategy for flow cytometric analysis. create gate on diagonally clustered singlets by plotting a forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) area. then, gate on CD3+ cells by side scatter (SSC) versus CD3. then, gate on CD3+ cells by side scatter (SSC) versus CD3; then, gate on CD3+ cells by side scatter (SSC). immunofluorescence assay Air-dry the frozen testis sections (6 mm) for 10 min at room temperature. Fix them with ice-cold acetone for 10 min. incubate the tissue sections with primary antibody (20 g/mL) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. immunoize the Ifnar1-/- mice between 6 and 8 weeks of age. keep the mice in standard SPF conditions of 18\u201329 \u00b0C and a 12 h light/dark cycle with access to food and water. remove the spleen, rinse it 3x in PBS to remove any blood. place the organ(s) on a sterile 40 m-mesh cell strainer on top of a 50 mL tube. mash the organ(s) and add medium until the organ has been fully ground. all experimental procedures must be performed aseptically in a biosafety cabinet. the isolation of monocytes from the brain and testes is described. to generate a single-cell suspension from the brain, place the organ on a sterile cell strainer with a 100 m mesh on top of a 50 mL tube and add 2 mL of ice-cold RPMI/10% FBS medium. mash the organ and add medium until the organ has been fully ground through the mesh. inject 500 L of 2m dissolved in a guanidine solution (30 mg/mL stock) using a syringe. inject 1.5 mL of H-2Db dissolved in a guanidine solution. the solution was placed in a closed box in a cold room. transfer the refolding solution to a centrifuge tube and spin it at 2,500 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and spin it at 12,000 x g for 15 min. sample A consists of 8 L of biotinylated MHC molecules and 2 L of streptavidin. sample B of 8 L of biotinylated MHC molecules and 2 L of streptavidin (20 mg/mL) and sample C of 2 L of streptavidin (20 mg/mL) and 8 L exchange buffer. after loading the last sample, incubate the reaction tube at 4 \u00b0C overnight in dark. incubate the reaction tube at 4 \u00b0C overnight in dark. add 20 L of the tetramer mix to the 96-well plate. by the end of this step, the final volume should be 40 L. incubate the plate in the dark at room temp for 30 min. treat the tissue sections with 3% H2O2 in PBS (pH 7.6) for 10 min and block them with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min. incubate the tissue sections with rat anti-mouse CD3 antibody (dilution: 1/1,000) for 8 h at room temperature and incubate them at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Ifnar1-/- mice at 6\u20138 weeks of age were infected with 1 x 104 focus-forming units (FFU) of the ZIKV by retroorbital injection. pathological symptoms and signs were observed in the Ifnar1-/- mice after an infection with the ZIKV. labeled tetramer had a higher efficacy to detect the specific CD8+ T cell compared to the APC- and BV421-labeled tetramers. a high ratio of the E294-302 tetramer-specific T cells could be detected in the brain and testicular lymphocytes. ar1-/- mice presented with myeloparalysis and motor paraparesis after infection. n = 10 mice per group per experiment compared with negative controls. three streptavidin fluorescence-tagged pMHC-I tetramers were used to detect ZIKV-specific T cells. Ifnar1-/- mice at 6-8 weeks of age either infected with 104 focus-forming units (FFU) of ZIKV or received a single-dose of 4 x 1010 viral particles of AdC7-M/E or PBS as a negative control. the detection of ZIKV-specific T cells in immunoprivileged organs is a critical methodology to understand T-cell responses against the natural ZIKV infection. a previous study showed that a live ZIKV or its RNA can be detected in the semen of male patients, which indicates that the ZIKV can bypass the blood-testis barrier. mers to detect antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in immunoprivileged organs would greatly enhance our understanding of ZIKV infections and their host immune responses. using the tetramer, virus-specific T cells in brain and testis can be isolated by flow cytometry, to investigate the cellular mechanisms of the protection and immunopathogenesis. retro-orbital infection is effective for a ZIKV infection but might be not a convenient operation for some investigators. a critical step is the isolation of monocytes from brain and testis. it is important to acquire high-quality lymphocytes."}
