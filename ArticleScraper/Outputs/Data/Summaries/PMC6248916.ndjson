{"summary": "study aimed at identifying etiologies and describing clinical features of SARI-associated hospitalization in Madagascar. study aimed at identifying etiologies and describing clinical features of SARI-associated hospitalization in Madagascar. 4.2 million deaths are attributed to SARI annually in developing countries. bacterial infections play a critical role in causing life-threatening pneumonia [1, 7\u20139]. the sentinel syndromic surveillance has been collecting SARI data since 2010. but hospitals only collect few data that are not exploitable for analysis. so far, only few sub-saharan africa countries are collecting data on hospitalization associated to acute respiratory illness. nasopharyngeal swabs were screened for 14 respiratory viruses using multiplex real-time PCR. data analysis Single infection was defined as an infection caused by one pathogen (virus or bacteria) and multiple infection as an infection caused by at least 2 pathogens (virus/virus, virus/bacteria or bacteria/bacteria) in a single sample. the age group less than 5 years has been considered as reference group. Statistical differences were considered significant for two-sided p-values = 0.05. nasopharyngeal swabs were screened for 14 respiratory viruses using multiplex real-time PCR. data analysis Single infection was defined as an infection caused by one pathogen (virus or bacteria) and multiple infection as an infection caused by at least 2 pathogens (virus/virus, virus/bacteria or bacteria/bacteria) in a single sample. logistic regressions were performed to adjust Odds-Ratio (OR). the age group less than 5 years has been considered as reference group. the age group less than 5 years has been considered as reference group. in CHD II Moramanga being younger than those hospitalized in CENHOSOA (Table 1).
