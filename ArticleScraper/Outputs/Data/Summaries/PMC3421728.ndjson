{"summary": "GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are nonveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses with icosahedral capsids. they have a genome of around 7,000 to 8,000 nucleotides (nt) encoding one polyprotein. the open reading frame (ORF) is flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) that are involved in RNA translation and replication (8). the complete genome comprises 7,298 nt, excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. the ORF begins at nt 654, ends at nt 7211 (6,558 nt in length) the phylogenetic tree obtained for the complete genome indicated that CH-ZJ1 is intervenient between HpeV4 and HpeV5. the virus genome sequence was deposited in GenBank with the strain name CH-ZJ1 under GenBank accession no. JX050181."}
