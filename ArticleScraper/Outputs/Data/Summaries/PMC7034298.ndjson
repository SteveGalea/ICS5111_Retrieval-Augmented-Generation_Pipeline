{"summary": "nuclear factor-kappa B is a transcription factor that plays a major role in various biological processes including the immune system development, activation, and regulation. the classical activation pathway of NF-kB is triggered by a large number of extracellular stimuli through different receptors. different primary immunodeficiency disorders result from genetic defects that involve components linked to the NF-kB activation pathway. the study was approved by the Research Advisory Council at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (RAC# 2121053). the study was approved by the research Advisory Council at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (RAC# 2121053). nonsense mutation resulting in termination of translation (truncated protein) Table 1. The clinical and immunological characterization. IgG (1.76\u20135.81 g/L), IgM (0.24\u20130.89 g/L), IgA (0.35\u20131.02 g/L), IgE (0.18\u20133.76 IU/ml) patient V:5 underwent HSCT from a fully matched sibling (10/10) at 19 months of age. six months later, he developed chronic gut GVHD that was controlled by the same medications. his lymphocyte subsets showed good recovery, clinically, he did not show good immune reconstitution. he continued to suffer from disseminated BCGitis with bony involvement requiring frequent surgical interventions for faciozygomatic osteomyelitis. all patients with IKK2 deficiency in the literature did not exhibit delayed cord separation except one from Saudi Arabia, but with a different mutation (3\u20137) this feature may be a clue to IKK2 deficiency in patients with combined immunodeficiency.
