{"summary": "guinea pig and macaque studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations described in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. all animal work was approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of Intramural Research IACUC at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. a gene expressing secreted EBOVGP was generated by deleting the sequence encoding the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail. the gene was inserted into position 1 of N4CT1 (GP1TM; Figure 1A) the mucin-like domain of EBOVGP spans aa 305\u2013485, and part of this domain (aa 374\u2013465) was deleted. an EBOVGP with part of the mucin-like domain deleted at positions 374\u2013465 (GP1muc) was inserted in position 1. Virus leader (Le), trailer (Tr) and intergenic regions are shown in black. shaded areas in EBOVGP represent deleted amino acid regions. rVSV/EBOV vectors were administered at 1 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) mice were anesthetized and inoculated intracranially with 0.02 mL of serial 10-fold dilutions of each vector. guinea pig immunization allowed the 50% lethal dose to be calculated. macaques challenged with 10 focus-forming units (FFU) of guinea pig-adapted EBOV (GPA-EBOV) [34] by intraperitoneal injection. all animals were weighed daily and monitored for signs of illness. ses A murine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) previously described [35] was modified by using ELISA plates coated with 100 ng/well of purified recombinant EBOVGP (IBT Bioservices) antigen-specific antibody titers were defined as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution giving an OD450 of >0.1. the N4CT1-HIVgag1 vector was used as template for generating all rVSV/EBOV vectors expressing EBOVGP. a gene expressing secreted EBOVGP was generated by deleting the sequence encoding the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail. part of this domain was deleted upon multiple serial passage of N4CT1-EBOVGP1 on vero cell monolayers. rVSV genomes containing the N gene translocation (N4) and truncated G protein cytoplasmic tail (CT1) were used in all vector designs. an EBOVGP with part of the mucin-like domain deleted at positions 374\u2013465 (GP1muc) was inserted in position 1. bands were detected by an anti-mouse\u2013AP conjugate immunoglobulin G (H + L; Promega) bands were seen at approximately 160, 140, and 110 kDa with varied expression levels. GP1muc showed a lower-molecular-weight EBOVGP band as a result of lost glycosylation sites due to deletion of amino acid positions 374\u2013465. mice were anesthetized and inoculated intracranially with 0.02 mL of serial 10-fold dilutions of each vector. mice were weighed daily and assessed for signs of disease over 3 weeks. mice showed severe signs of disease or were moribund were promptly euthanized. macaques were monitored for signs of illness (ie, abnormal temperature, weight loss, clinical examination findings, hematology findings, and blood chemistry findings) macaques were inactivated by -irradiation (5 Mrad) according to standard operating protocol approved by the institutional biosafety committee. groups of BALB/c mice (n = 10) were immunized intramuscularly at study week 0. splenocytes were collected from 5 mice/group and tested for EBOVGP-specific IFN- secretion by ELISpot assay. the remaining 5 mice/group were boosted intramuscularly at study week 3. GP1, processed by furin proteolysis into mature EBOVGP; SFC, spot-forming cell. highest mean EBOVGP-specific IFN- ELISpot responses detected in mice immunized with N4CT1-EBOVGP1TM. a 10-fold lower EBOVGP-specific IgG titer was detected in mice immunized with N4CT1-EBOVGP1TM (mean SEM, 4.05 0.25) relative to mice immunized with vectors expressing EBOVGP from genome positions 1 or 3. guinea pigs were immunized intraperitoneally with 2 105 PFU of N4CT1-EBOVGP1. all guinea pigs were challenged intraperitoneally with 10 FFU of GPA-EBOV. guinea pigs were monitored for changes in body weight, signs of disease, and survival. three rhesus macaques were immunized intramuscularly in the caudal thigh muscle as follows: 2 were immunized with 1 107 PFU N4CT1-EBOVGP1 in a total volume of 1 mL (EBOV1 and EBOV2) and 1 macaque was mock immunized. at day 14 after immunization, both N4CT1-EBOVGP1\u2013immunized macaques demonstrated the single control animal failed to mount an EBOVGP-specific response on day 6 after challenge and quickly died from EBOV infection. a rapid increase in the EBOVGP-specific serum IgG titer was observed on days 6, 10 and 14 after challenge in both vaccinated macaques, and they survived without showing signs of disease. mice were assessed for morbidity and mortality for 2 weeks following inoculation. mice inoculated intracranially with PBS survived and half of the mice inoculated with rVSV-HIVgag5 died 3\u20135 days after inoculation. all mice inoculated with N4CT1-EBOVGP1 survived and were disease free. data represent the average log10 EBOVGP-specific IFN- ELISpot responses. after 1 immunization, the highest mean EBOVGP-specific IFN- ELISpot responses were detected. responses (SEM) were again detected in mice immunized with N4CT1-EBOVGP1TM (211 18 SFCs/106 splenocytes) and N4CT1-EBOVGP1 (mean SEM, 300 57 SFCs/106 splenocytes) mice immunized with N4CT1-EBOVGP1muc showed an improved response (mean SEM, 172 41 SFCs/106 splenocytes rVSVN4CT1-EBOVGP1 was selected for guinea pig and NHP challenge studies. guinea pigs were immunized intraperitoneally with 2 105 PFU of N4CT1-EBOVGP1. guinea pigs were monitored for changes in body weight, signs of disease, and survival. guinea pigs immunized with medium alone or wtVSV began to lose weight on day 4 after challenge. rvSVN4CT1-EBOVGP1 immunized guinea pigs gained weight and were completely protected from disease during the course of the study. b macaques EBOV1 and EBOV2 were vaccinated on day 21 by intramuscular injection. the control macaque was euthanized on day 6 after challenge. a rapid increase in the EBOVGP-specific serum IgG titer was observed on days 6, 10 and 14 after challenge. two control groups were inoculated with 102 PFU of a less attenuated rVSV (rVSV-HIVgag5) or with PBS alone. mice were assessed for morbidity and mortality over 2 weeks. rVSV-specific cell-mediated immune responses were more robust when the EBOVGP gene was in the first position in the genome. the cell-mediated immune response was similar for secreted and anchored forms of EBOVGP, indicating that both forms of EBOVGP underwent a similar degree of processing and presentation of T-cell epitopes in antigen-presenting cells. the secreted EBOVGP described here is different from the naturally occurring secreted form of EBOVGP that is translated from unedited EBOVGP mRNA. anchored trimeric EBOVGP spikes on the surface of infected cells and virus particles present a dense array of structural epitopes that may interact more efficiently with B cells than soluble secreted EBOVGP. EBOVGP-specific IgG responses were highest for N4CT1-EBOV mouse intracranial NV model showed EBOVGP was present on the surface of virus particles when expressed by an rVSV vector that retained the VSV G gene. a mouse NV study was performed to assess any changes in virulence arising from the possible alteration of vector tropism mediated by EBOVGP. the presence of EBOVGP on the virion surface did not enhance virus spread in the brain. er was detected in both immunized macaques prior to challenge. a preexisting EBOVGP-specific antibody response is important for protection. cell-mediated immune responses in NHPs were not measured. the vector is similar to the highly attenuated N4CT1-gag1 vector."}
