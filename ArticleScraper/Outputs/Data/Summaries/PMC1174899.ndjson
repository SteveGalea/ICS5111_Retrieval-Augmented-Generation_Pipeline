{"summary": "RNA recombination has been observed in all types of viruses using RNA as a carrier of genetic information. in positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (1\u20134), in negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (5,6), in double-stranded RNA viruses (7,8) and in retroviruses (9\u201311). RNA recombination enables the exchange of genetic material between the same or similar viruses. the involvement of viral replicase proteins in recombination has been demonstrated (26,27) a wide spectrum of RNA motifs supporting recombination have been identified (4,23,28\u201330) in general, there exist two major types of RNA structural elements that induce recombination events. up until now there has been no in vivo recombination system that could be used to test the recombination activity of any given RNA sequence. the recombination vector is stable and replicates when used together with wtRNA1 and wtRNA2 to infect plants. it starts to recombine if a recombinationally active sequence (RAS) is introduced just between the CP coding sequence and the modified 3\u2032 region (into the RAS-cloning site) the PN0-RNA3 vector is a wtRNA3 derivative with a modified 3\u2032-noncoding end. the latter includes (i) the RAS cloning site, (ii) a 197 nt sequence derived from the 3\u2032-noncoding region of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus RNA3. the presence of the RAS1as sequence in RNA3 derivative (called Mag1-RNA3) allows local RNA1-RNA3 hybridization the heteromolecular system could not be applied for testing the recombination capacity of various RNA motifs. the system was not further developed, since any changes in RNA2 which encodes BMV polymerase could strongly affect the studied process. we have called this homomolecular system homomolecular. restriction enzymes (EcoRI, SpeI and XbaI) T7 RNA polymerase, RNasine, RQ DNase RNase free, MMLV-reverse transcriptase, Taq polymerase and pUC19 cloning vector were from Promega. the following primers were used for the construction of pMatNH- pMatH-, pMatNH-HVR-, pMatH- primer A\u2014first strand primer complementary to the 3\u2032 end of all BMV genomic RNAs. primer B\u2014second strand primer specific for RNA3, representing RNA3 sequence between positions 1726 and 1751. pB1TP3, pB2TP5 and pPN0-RNA3 containing full-length cDNA of BMV RNA1, RNA2 and modified RNA3 (recombination vector) primer A\u2014first strand primer complementary to the 3\u2032 end of all BMV genomic RNAs. pPN0-RNA3 was linearized with SpeI endonuclease and ligated with SpeI cut RAS1 cDNA. pPN0-RNA3 was linearized with SpeI endonuclease. pMag1-RNA3 and pMagH-RNA3 were digested with KpnI and EcoRI endonucleases. the deleted fragment was replaced with a KpnI\u2013EcoRI cut 379 nt cDNA fragment corresponding to the BMV RNA1 3\u2032 end (containing the entire 3\u2032-UTR and RAS1) the latter were obtained by PCR using primers 1, 2 and pB1TP3 as a template. cDNA of the corresponding fragments of the virus' genome was obtained by RT\u2013PCR method. both tested sequences were amplified by PCR with primers introducing an SpeI restriction site. pMat0-RNA3 derivatives bearing HVR and X in sense and antisense orientation were identified. in vivo recombination assay was applied (30,33) to test the recombination activity of the BMV mutants. five-leaf C.quinoa plants were mechanically inoculated. pPN0-RNA3 was linearized with SpeI endonuclease and ligated with SpeI cut RAS1 cDNA. pPN0-RNA3 and pMag1-RNA3 plasmids were digested with KpnI and EcoRI endonucleases. the deleted fragment was replaced with a cDNA fragment corresponding to the BMV RNA1 3\u2032 end. plasmid was cut with KpnI and EcoRI to remove RNA1 3\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032RAS1s. instead, a 295 nt fragment of RNA1 3\u2032 end was ligated into pMatNH-RNA3. the inserted sequence was obtained by PCR using primers 2, 3 and pB1TP3 as a template and digested with KpnI and EcoRI. four plasmids were obtained: pMatH-HVR-RNA3\u2014containing cDNA of MatH-HVR-RNA3. pMatH-X-RNA3\u2014containing cDNA of MatH-X-RNA3 carrying two Xes, 5\u2032X in sense and 3\u2032X in antisense orientation. structure was confirmed by sequencing. individual local lesions were excised and total RNA was extracted separately from every lesion. the isolated RNA was subjected to RT\u2013PCR involving primer A (the first strand primer) and primer B (the second strand primer) specific for RNA3 3\u2032 fragment amplification. recombinants should be able to out compete the vector with inserted RASes. changes in RNA1 and RNA2, which encode BMV replicase proteins, would strongly affect the studied process. to address both issues, we decided to construct a mixed system, homo- and heteromolecular at the same time. oI restriction site was disrupted by a 4 nt insertion between C-2991 and G-2992. resulting RNA3 derivatives, called MatNH- and MatH-RNA3, have unchanged 5\u2032-UTR, intergenic and coding regions and a highly modified 3\u2032-UTR. the latter includes 3\u2032-UTR coming from wtRNA1 and two RAS1 sequences (3\u2032RAS1 and 5\u2032RAS1) separated by a 338 a marker mutation Xho (marked as a white dot) was introduced into the 3\u2032 end of MatNH- and MatH-RNA3 to make it distinguishable from an analogous region present in wtRNA1. we were able to construct two variants of the mixed system: one for homologous (MatH-BMV mutant) and the other for non-homologous (MatNH-BMV mutant) recombination studies.

RNA3 recombinants were only formed during matH-HVR-BMV infection. one recombinationally active sequence HVRs and a spacer were deleted. recombinant junction sites were located within the local double-stranded region. after 2 weeks, the number of lesions developed on inoculated leaves was counted and then standard analysis of progeny RNA was carried out. the total RNA was isolated and used for the selective RT\u2013PCR amplification of the 3\u2032-portion of progeny RNA3. the length of RT\u2013PCR products was established by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. mat0-RNA3 was applied to examine the recombination activity of two specific sequences derived from the HCV genome. the first, 101 nt sequence is placed within the 5\u2032-portion of the HCV genome (within the fragment encoding E2 protein) the second, called the sequence X (X) constitutes a 98 nt 3\u2032 end of HCV genomic RNA. the examined sequences were present only in the recombination vector. they were absent in the two other genomic RNAs so that recombination crossovers could involve only RNA3 molecules. after 2 weeks, the standard procedure of BMV RNA3 progeny analysis was applied. an RNA3 recombinant was generated in 100 and 90% of lesions developed during infection with MatH-HVR- and MatNH-X-BMV. homologous recombinants were generated only during infection involving MatH-X-BMV. new tab Northern blot analysis of the accumulation of BMV recombinants generated in the newly constructed homomolecular system. the total RNA was isolated from individual lesions, separated in a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane and probed with a 32P-labeled RNA (200 nt probe complementary to the 3\u2032-UTR shared by all BMV genomic RNAs) a new vector should have two separate RAS cloning sites, be replicable and stable during infection. recombinants should be able to out compete the vector with inserted RASes. recombinants should be capable of generating viable recombinants. a marker mutation (called Xho) was introduced within the RNA1-derived fragment to make it distinguishable from an analogous region present in wtRNA1. resulting RNA3 derivatives, called MatNH- and MatH-RNA3, have unchanged 5\u2032-UTR, intergenic and coding regions and a highly modified 3\u2032-UTR. the latter includes 3\u2032-UTR coming from wtRNA1 and two RAS1 sequences (3\u2032RAS1 and 5 a 379 nt portion of the wtRNA1 3\u2032 end was replaced with a 379 nt portion of the wtRNA1 3\u2032 end (fragment containing the entire 3\u2032-UTR and RAS1) both constructs contain two copies of RAS1 sequence. a marker mutation Xho (marked as a white dot), removing the XhoI restriction site, was introduced into the 3\u2032 end of MatNH- and MatH-RNA3 ainfectivity was defined as the ratio between the number of lesions that developed recombinants and the total number of analyzed lesions. ainfectivity was defined as the ratio between the number of lesions that developed recombinants and the total number of analyzed lesions. the number of lesions formed on every inoculated leaf was counted to determine the infectivity of the MatH-BMV mutant. individual local lesions were excised and total RNA was extracted separately from each of them. the 3\u2032-portion of RNA3 progeny accumulating in examined lesions was selectively amplified. the presence of two RAS1s sequences in the MH-BMV mutant creates an opportunity for homologous recombination events between two different segments of the viral genome. however, during MH-BMV infection recombinants were not identified (RF = 0%) crossovers between 3\u2032RAS1s and 5\u2032RAS1s of two MatH-RNA3 molecules (intermolecular) and between two RAS1s sequences of the same MatH-RNA3 molecule (intramolecular) can also occur. the average number of lesions appearing on the leaves inoculated with MH- and MatH-BMV were similar: 18 and 17, respectively. recombination can be mediated by RAS1 present in wtRNA1 and 5\u2032- or 3\u2032RAS1 located in MatH-RNA3. mutation Xho introduced into MatH-RNA3 (just behind 3\u2032RAS1) was present in 20% of recombinants. a full-length cDNA clone of RNA3 recombinant containing Xho (RNA3-XhoR) was obtained. it was inserted into the pUC19 vector under the T7 polymerase promoter. RNA3-XhoR was used together with wtRNA1 and wtRNA2 to inoculate C.quinoa plants. 1, wtRNA2 and Mag1-RNA3 (M1-BMV mutant) crossovers occurred within the local double-stranded region. in order to test RAS1 activity in the mixed non-homologous recombination system, C.quinoa plants were inoculated with the MatNH-BMV mutant. AS1as sequence is green and the fragment synthesized on RNA3 is blue. the black dot symbolizes the Xho mutation present in MatNH-RNA3. a detailed description of the M1-BMV genome is presented in Figure 1. RNA1 RAS1s and MatNH-RNA3 5\u2032RAS1as (intermolecular) recombinants are generated if BMV replicase initiates nascent strand synthesis at the 3\u2032 end of wtRNA1 or MatNH-RNA3. boxed fragments of recombining wtRNA1/Mag1-RNA3, wtRNA1/MatNH-RNA3 and MatNH-RNA3/MatNH-RNA3 molecules in the heteromolecular system, only one type of heteroduplex supporting non-homologous crossovers could possibly form: between wtRNA1 and Mag1-RNA3. in the mixed system, recombining molecules were capable of forming three types of heteroduplexes: intermolecular, between 5\u2032RAS1as and 3\u2032RAS1s located in two MatHN-RNA3 molecules and intramolecular, between 5\u2032RAS1as and 3\u2032RA Mat0-RNA3 is composed of the 295 nt very 3\u2032 end of RNA1 followed by the 3\u2032 RAS cloning site, a 338 nt spacer and the 5\u2032 RAS cloning site. white, black and gray boxes represent coding, noncoding and recombinationally active sequences, respectively. RNA3 recombinants were only formed during matH-HVR-BMV infection. one recombinationally active sequence HVRs and a spacer were deleted. recombinant junction sites were located within the left portion of the local double-stranded region. C.quinoa plants were inoculated with a mixture containing wtRNA1, wtRNA2 and Mat0-RNA3 (Mat0-BMV mutant) after 2 weeks, the number of lesions developed on inoculated leaves was counted and then standard analysis of progeny RNA was carried out. bRecombination frequency was defined as the ratio between the number of lesions that developed recombinants and the total number of analyzed lesions. the first, 101 nt sequence is placed within the 5\u2032-portion of the HCV genome. the second, called the sequence X (X) constitutes a 98 nt 3\u2032 end of HCV genomic RNA. the former two were applied to test HVR's and X's ability to support homologous crossovers while the latter to examine Xs/Xas' and HVRas' capacity to induce non-homologous, heteroduplex-mediated recombination. the examined sequences were present only in the recombination vector, so that recombination crossovers could involve only RNA3 molecules. RNA3 recombinant was generated in 100 and 90% of lesions developed during infection with MatH-HVR- and MatNH-X-BMV. homologous recombinants were generated only during infection involving MatH-X-BMV. the total RNA was isolated from individual lesions, separated in a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane and probed with a 32P-labeled RNA. a mixture of the BMV RNA transcripts used for plant inoculation was applied as a molecular mass marker (lane S) to overcome this problem, we attempted to create a new universal recombination in vivo system. the collected data suggested that a BMV RNA3-based homomolecular system would best fulfill our expectations. the mixed systems were prepared in such a way that two identical or two complementary sequences were capable of supporting homologous or non-homologous crossovers. the same conclusion was reached by us earlier while studying the influence of specific mutations in the 2a protein. we identified among other the mutation in the 2a protein, which inhibits non-homologous crossovers without affecting the frequency of homologous ones. at present, it is difficult to judge at which stage of recombination the observed differences occur. 98 nt sequence X and an HVR both from the genome of an RNA virus not related to BMV. recombination in the universal homomolecular system Based on results obtained using heteromolecular and mixed systems. homologous recombination occurs effectively in AU-rich regions (47) and is not observed within highly structured 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-UTR (48) this may reflect the capacity of RNA viruses to remove inverted repeats from their genomes. the newly created homomolecular recombination system can be used to examine in vivo recombination activity of various RNA sequences derived from the genomes of related or unrelated viruses. however, there are other factors which, in addition to RNA structure, can affect the course of the studied process. identical or two complementary sequences were capable of supporting homologous or non-homologous crossovers, respectively, either between molecules representing the same segment of the BMV genome (modified RNA3) or between molecules representing two different segments of the BMV genome (wtRNA1 and modified RNA3) recombination can occur both in homo- and heteromolecular systems. replication complex is complementarity between the donor and the nascent strand. replicase can leave the donor template alone or together with a nascent strand. it can find a complementary sequence in the acceptor RNA, hybridize and serve as a primer allowing viral replicase to reinitiate RNA synthesis. sequence X is the least variable and HVR the most variable fragment of the HCV genome (42,43,45), (iii) unlike to HVR, sequence X possesses a very stable and well-defined secondary and tertiary structure (42,45) the frequency of homologous recombination amounted to 55% and of non-homologous to 100%. homologous RNA recombination plays a very complex role in a virus' life cycle. it is thought that the stability of RNA structure makes the hybridization of the nascent strand and/or replicase to the acceptor difficult. however, it is thought that the stability of RNA structure makes the hybridization of the nascent strand to the acceptor difficult. new RNA viruses or retroviruses are generated."}
