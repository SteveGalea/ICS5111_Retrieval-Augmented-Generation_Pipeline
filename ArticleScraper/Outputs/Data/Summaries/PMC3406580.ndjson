{"summary": "caspase activity assays were performed at a range of times after infection. caspase activity was not detected in infected vero cells. caspase activity was found in the specific positive control. caspase 12 was undetectable in mock-infected cells or at 6 hpi. at 16 hpi it was induced and increased threefold until 48 hpi. caspase 12 was localized in the nucleus in infected cells. the inhibition of membrane blebbing reduced the release of virus particles from the cell and this effect was enhanced when the inhibitor was added 6 hpi. the inhibitor did not cause a decrease in virus production nor in the exit of virus particles. cells and media were harvested at 48 hpi and titrated by plaque assay. intracellular (I) or extracellular (E) virus titers in pfu/ml are shown. asterisks indicate S.D. from three independent experiments. ER chaperones in vero cells infected with aSFV or treated with tunicamycin. western blot analysis of the ER chaperones was performed. p30 viral protein expression was followed by p30. p20 remained intact during the infection, indicating absence of pro-apoptotic signals between the ER and mitochondria. western blot analysis of CHOP, GADD34, ATF4, p30 and p72 viral proteins in vero cells. XBP1 mRNA levels quantified with real-time RT-PCR. total RNA was isolated from ASFV-infected Vero cells at a range of times post-infection times. x-fold changes were calculated as described in Materials and Methods. the level of endogenous XBP1 mRNA was measured in infected cells using qRT-PCR analysis of RNAs from ASFV-infected samples. we found an increase in the level of XBP1 transcript in cells treated with tunicamycin or dithiothreitol (DTT) compared with the level of mRNA obtained in mock-infected cells. cells transfected with this construct and infected with ASFV showed GFP-ATF6 localization either in discrete perinuclear cytoplasmic areas corresponding to viral factories. this finding indicates that ASFV activates the ATF6 pathway of the UPR. a serine protease inhibitor inhibits ER stress-induced proteolysis of ATF6, AEBSF33 on ASFV infection. infected cells were gated in M1 and expressed as a percentage of total cell analyzed. data normalized to infection rates in untreated cells. caspase activity assays at a range of times after infection. e 8 activity was not detected in infected Vero cells. caspase activity was measured in virus-infected cell lysates. spase 12 was localized in the nucleus in infected vero cells treated with an inhibitor of caspase 3 activation (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and with a specific inhibitor of myosin II ATPase activity (Blebbistatin) the effect of Y-27632, a ROCK-I inhibitor that blocks membrane blebbing. 3 nor caspase 9 were inhibited by Z-ATD-FMK. only caspase 12 activation was specifically inhibited. drugs were added 2 h before infection or 6 h after. calreticulin and calnexin were induced upon ASFV infection at 16 hpi. only a modest increase in PDI levels was found at 48 hpi. western blot analysis of the ER chaperones in vero cells infected with ASFV. confocal micrographs of vero cells grown on glass slides were treated with tunicamycin or infected with B54GFP-2 for 16 hpi. calnexin acts as a scaffold for caspase 8-dependent cleavage of the ER transmembrane protein Bap31. p20 fragment directs pro-apoptotic crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria. ation of eIF2.5 Tunicamycin treatment caused an increase in CHOP expression in vero cells. however, no induction of CHOP was observed in infected cells by western blot. ASFV inhibits CHOP expression and leads to increased eIF2 dephosphorylation. the XBP1 protein encoded by the spliced mRNA is more stable than the unspliced form. it is a potent transcription factor of the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) family and caspase 12 inhibition flow cytometry (FACS ERAD) PDI eIF2 basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) one of the key regulators of ER-folding capacity. pCMV short-EGFP-ATF6 fusion protein localizes exclusively to the ER and translocates to the nucleus. this characteristic pattern was modified in infected cells. a serine protease inhibitor inhibits ER stress-induced proteolysis of ATF6, AEBSF33. we analyzed caspase activation under AEBSF to find that this agent abrogated caspase 3, 9 and 12 activation in infected cells. inhibition of caspases was dependent of AEBSF effect on infection. infected cells were gated in M. apoptosis is a genetically controlled cell death mechanism involved in the regulation of tissue homeostasis. caspases 3 and 9 are activated with similar kinetics as of 16 hpi. caspase 12 is a characteristic ER stress response caspase. a large amount of viral proteins are synthesized and accumulated in infected cells. this overload can lead to the activation of another pro-apoptotic protein, Bap31. two folding systems have been proposed to contribute to this quality control. one of these is composed of grp78 (BiP), grp94 and PDI. the second system, known as the \u2018calnexin\u2013calreticulin cycle', includes calnexin, calreticulin and ERp57. IRE1-XBP1 activates its phosphatase activity40 and promotes the expression of cellular GADD34. no splicing of XBP1 was detected during ASFV infection. the absence of splicing may favor viral infection. apoptosis induction, caspase activation and later modulation of the UPR might be advantageous for ASFV as these processes block the effects that are detrimental to the infection. apoptosis induction, caspase activation and later modulation of the UPR might be advantageous for ASFV. the plasmid pCMVshort-EGFP-ATF6 was transfected into vero cells using Fugene 6 (Roche Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) western blotting Cells seeded in 24-well plates were harvested in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. the following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-rabbit IgG HPR conjugate (Bio-Rad) and sheep anti-mouse IgG HPR conjugate (GE Healthcare) the activity of caspases 3, 8 and 9 respectively, were measured at a range of times post-infection in Vero cells and in WSL-R cells infected with ASFV at a multiplicity of 1 pfu/cell. vero cells were infected with ASFV at a multiplicity of infection of 1 pfu/ml. titers in cell lysates and culture medium were titrated by plaque assay. 10 000 cells/time point were scored and analysed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. untreated control infected cultures yielded 25\u201330% of infected cells from the total cells examined. infected cell percentages obtained after drug treatments were normalized to values found in control plates. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel and stained with SYBR Green. cDNA levels were quantified using quantitative PCR (qPCR) cDNA was synthesized using the QuantiTect Reverse Trancription kit. ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine. plasmid pCMVshort-EGFP-ATF6 was transfected into vero cells using Fugene 6 (Roche Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) specific antibody binding sites were blocked with skimmed milk in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with the specific primary and the HRP (Horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies. anti-p72 monoclonal antibody clone 18BG3 (Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain) 1 : 5000. IgG HPR conjugate (Bio-Rad) and sheep anti-mouse IgG HPR conjugate (GE Healthcare), observing the manufacturer's instructions. the activity of caspases 3, 8 and 9 respectively, was determined using a fluorimetric caspase 12 assay kit (Biovision, Mountain View, CA, USA) titers in cell lysates (intracellular virus) and culture medium (extracelullar virus) were titrated by plaque assay in triplicate samples on cells. titers were pretreated with inhibitors at the indicated concentrations in growth medium for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C followed by infection with ASFV B54GFP-2 recombinant virus at a moi of 1 pfu/ml. anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488 and anti-mouse IgG Alexa 594-conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted to 1 : 200 were used as secondary antibodies respectively.
