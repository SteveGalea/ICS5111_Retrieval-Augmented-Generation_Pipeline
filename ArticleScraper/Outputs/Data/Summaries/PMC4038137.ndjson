{"summary": "INFLUENCE65 was a phase III randomized controlled study. the study was conducted in 3 continents in the northern hemisphere. participants were community-based or living in retirement homes. an ILI was defined as the simultaneous occurrence of at least 1 respiratory symptom (nasal congestion, sore throat, new/worsening cough, dyspnea, sputum production, or wheezing) and one systemic symptom (headache, fatigue, myalgia, feverishness [feeling hot or cold, having chills or rigors], fever [oral temperature of 37.5\u00b0C]). ISS questionnaire assesses the severity of 10 symptoms including 3 respiratory (cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion) and seven systemic (headache, feeling feverish, body aches, fatigue, neck pain, interrupted sleep, and loss of appetite) symptoms. questionnaire was completed for 15 days. influenza A and subtypes H1, H3, and H5, influenza B, RSV subtypes A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus. primary objective was to estimate prevalence of other respiratory viruses in this population, and in subgroups defined by pneumonia occurrence, hospitalization status, and ISS score >2. the study was conducted in 3 continents in the northern hemisphere. participants were community-based or living in retirement homes, which allowed mixing in the community. a Includes 10 subjects who had an ISS score >2 and were hospitalized or had pneumonia. b n, no. of subjects in a given category. informed consent was given to participate in INFLUENCE65. ISS questionnaire assesses the severity of 10 symptoms including 3 respiratory (cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion) and seven systemic (headache, feeling feverish, body aches, fatigue, neck pain, interrupted sleep, and loss of appetite) symptoms using a 3-point grading system. the 10 individual scores (systemic and respiratory) were averaged daily with a final score ranging from 0 to 3. sensitivity ranged from 0.1 to 1 TCID50, corresponding to approximately 50 to 250 genome equivalents [14, 15]. Statistical Methods The primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of other respiratory viruses in this population. of 490 (94.0%) episodes with a maximum ISS score >2, 480 (86.3%) were nonhospitalized, nonpneumonia cases, including 9 with unknown hospitalization status. no deaths occurred in association with 556 moderate-to-severe ILI episodes included in the analysis. 58 (11.8) women/Men 1.8 1.4 1.5 1.8 Life independence status, n (%)c Independent 507 (91.7) 52 (83.9) 27 (96.4) 453 (92.4) Low-level care 18 (3.3) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 18 (3.7) High level care 28 (5.1) 10 (16.1) 1 (3.6) 19 (3.9) Abbreviations: ISS, influenza symptom severity score; SD, standard deviation. subjects with and without RSV were of similar age and gender distribution. hospitalization occurred in 19.5% (8/41) of RSV positive episodes and 10.9% (56/515) of RSV negative episodes. there was no significant association between hospitalization status and RSV detection. 0 0.0 (.0\u201316.8) 14 70.0 (45.7\u201388.1) Canada 38 6.8 2 5.3 (.6\u201317.7) 0 0.0 (.0\u20139.3) 2 5.3 (.6\u201317.7) 18 47.4 (31.0\u201364.2) Czech Rep. 70 12.6 12 17.1 (9.2\u201328.0) 2 2.9 (.3\u20139.9) 10 14.3 (7.1\u201324.7) 53 75.7 (64.0\u201385.2) Estonia 17 3.1 0 98 17.6 0 0.0 (.0\u20133.7) 0 0.0 (.0\u20133.7) 36 36.7 (27.2\u201347.1) Taiwan 4 0.7 0 0.0 (.0\u201360.2) 0 0.0 (.0\u201360.2) 1 25.0 (.6\u201380.6) UK \u2013 CMD 13 2.3 0 0.0 (.0\u201324.7) 0 0.0 (.0\u201324.7) 0 0.0 (.0\u201324.7) 6 46.2 samples [32.5%]), rhinovirus/enterovirus (82/320 positive samples [25.6%]), RSV (41/320 positive samples [12.8%] and coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (each with 32/320 positive samples [10.0%]; Table 4.
