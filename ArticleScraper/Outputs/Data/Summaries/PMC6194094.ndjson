{"summary": "the world does not know what pathogen can cause the next epidemic. early warning of disease occurrence and assessing the impact on the public are paramount. new information systems have played a key role in improving public health\u2019s early warning. the health community engaged consumers to help them fight disease outbreaks. consumers become frontline activists to report occurrences and outcomes, and become \"intelligent connections\" to extend the right information in social networks. method One could envision a public-health-engagement-approach to empower consumers. a mission that allows them to contribute to the social good with the added benefit of making them more attentive to their own healthcare. the challenge is how to engage individuals directly, empower them to be advocates for their own health and in an outbreak become sources of trusted public health messages. the baseline looked at number of users that were logging into MyIR more than once a month. the target was non-engaged users. in this category there were nearly 8,000 accounts. the second experiment aimed to engage the consumer for the flu shot. if they selected Yes, they saw a funny meme and received positive affirmation. the message was an encouragement to get their flu shot before Thanksgiving 2017. the national immunization ecosystem is based on what public health has spent the past quarter century developing. this is based on key data assets and technical infrastructure for reporting, accessing and assessing immunization activity. this is based on what public health has spent the past quarter century developing. pandemic preparedness planning is potentially a new approach to accelerating individual health accountability while offering public health the ability to communicate valuable outbreak or pandemic information. the outcome should influence day-to-day consumer behavior to mitigate the outbreak\u2019s impact on the population. public health has an expectation and relies on their disease specific health education reaches at risk individuals. in washington and Louisiana, over 35,000 consumers access their immunization records through real-time connections to the state IIS through MyIR. the \"players\" in these states encourage individuals to enroll for access. the \"players\" in these states encourage individuals to enroll for access. a number of immunization campaigns have been undertaken by STC to explore the power of direct links to individuals who have enrolled and have access to their immunization records. in a 90-day period from mid-August 2016 to mid-November, the STC consumer tool MyIR had 15,000 total user visits to the state immunization registry. in that same period 3,200 users visited MyIR more than once a month. 78% of flu respondents said they received the flu shot this year. of those 61.5% responded they did receive the flu shot this year. CDC determined the interim estimates for the effectiveness of the influenza were 36% [16]. Efficacy of flu respondents were asked: \"did you get a flu shot this year\" 78% of those who opened the email followed through and completed the process. a subset of these individuals will provide information requested from public health authorities. the next step is to engage individuals to establish those that would be willing to provide ongoing information to public health specific to immunizations and disease occurrences. this would include developing experiments that test a social campaign to engage these individuals over the course of a year to ensure they remain activists in this network. the impact would be monitored in order to begin to establish a model with key parameters that would allow scaling across states and different demographics of users. pandemic preparedness planning is primed to step beyond just response actions and traditional communication plans to reach directly into areas where outbreaks are occurring. if you are active in supporting a higher cause and technology is the facilitator, the belief is this would reduce the risk of outbreaks and help mitigate the economic impact and costs."}
