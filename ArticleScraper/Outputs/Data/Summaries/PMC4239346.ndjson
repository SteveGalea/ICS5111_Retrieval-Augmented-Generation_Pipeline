{"summary": "large-scale outbreaks of PEDV have recurred and swept rapidly across the country. pigs on a farm in Kyungpook province suffered from PED-like symptoms. fecal samples from pigs with diarrhea were submitted to our laboratory. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome of DV KNU-1406 were determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) the complete genome of KNU-1406 has a nucleotide identity of 96.6 to 99.7%. this is the first time that the complete genome sequence of the new variant Korean strain of PEDV was determined. edward et al."}
