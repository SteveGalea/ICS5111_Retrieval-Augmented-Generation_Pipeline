{"summary": "proteins with significant changes in expression have particular interest as markers for various diseases and cellular phenotypes [2]. identifying the molecular mechanism of cellular processes from the long list of candidate proteins is challenging. a protein functional network describes the functional and physical associations between proteins and provides a framework for understanding how individual protein work together to perform critical cellular functions. genome-wide predictions of protein subcellular localizations have revealed the localization of the mt protein inventory. the mt protein inventory is dynamically changed depending on the cellular state, tissue type, and species [11], [20]. in humans, dynamic changes in the mt proteome affect the functional organizations of mt proteins and disease susceptibilities [24] mtDNA-depleted (0) osteosarcoma cell has been used as an important tool to investigate dysfunctional mitochondria. mtDNA-depleted (0) osteosarcoma cell has been used as an important tool to investigate dysfunctional mitochondria. 569 out of 1,121 proteins (50.76%) were annotated as mitochondrial proteins. functional link represents protein-protein interaction. number of down-regulated, up-regulated, and not significantly changed proteins was 288, 122, and 360 respectively. the network is divided into two prominent subnetworks of up-regulated (green) and down-regulated proteins (red) based on abundance ratios. more links were made within up-regulated or down-regulated proteins (intraregulatory links) than between up-regulated or down-regulated proteins (interregulatory links) mt proteins are color coded according to the 0/+ ratio. green and red nodes represent up-regulated mt proteins and down-regulated mt proteins under the dysfunctional 0 state. the five up-regulated groups contain 59 out of 89 (66.29%) up-regulated proteins. they are linked to the function of cytosolic ribosome, ribonucleoprotein complex, protein folding on mt surface, DNA repair, and proteolysis. the eight down-regulated groups include 138 out of 175 (78.86%) down-regulated proteins. 43% of mt proteins (296 = 78+218) exhibited a negative correlation between protein and mRNA abundances. up-regulated and down-regulated functional modules exhibited distinctive patterns in expression profiles. mt protein abundances increased in the five up-regulated functional modules. western blot analysis performed western blot analysis by using isolated + and 0 mitochondria. we selected eight up-regulated and nine down-regulated proteins from each functional module. the levels of seven out of the eight up-regulated proteins were increased in 0 mitochondria. mt proteins were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot. -actin served as a loading control. -actin served as a loading control. mtDNA-depleted (0) osteosarcoma cell has been used as an important tool to investigate dysfunctional mitochondria. the 0 cell was established by long-term treatment of ethidium bromide (EtBr) which intercalated into mtDNA without any detectable effect on nuclear DNA division. so, we examined a set of nuclear-encoded mt proteins as mt proteome. 569 out of 1,121 proteins (50.76%) were annotated as mitochondrial proteins. 201 proteins were physically (82 proteins, 7.31%) or functionally (119 proteins, 10.62%) linked to the 569 reference mt proteins. functional link represents a relationship between two proteins if they shared a substrate in a metabolic pathway. the network is divided into two prominent subnetworks of up-regulated (green) and down-regulated proteins (red) based on abundance ratios. more links were made within up-regulated or down-regulated proteins (intraregulatory links) than between up-regulated or down-regulated proteins (interregulatory links) an intraregulatory link is a link between proteins with the same regulatory pattern: up- and up-regulated or down-regulated proteins. an interregulatory link is a link between up- and down-regulated proteins. an interregulatory link is a link between proteins with the same regulatory pattern: up- and up-regulated or down-regulated proteins. the five up-regulated groups contain 59 out of 89 (66.29%) up-regulated proteins. they are linked to the function of cytosolic ribosome, ribonucleoprotein complex, protein folding on mt surface, DNA repair, and proteolysis. the eight down-regulated groups include 138 out of 175 (78.86%) down-regulated proteins. expression profiles were divided into five groups depending on the abundance ratios of mt protein-mRNA. up-up (127), down-down (147), up-down (78), down-up (218) and unchanged (118) groups. expression profiles were divided into five groups depending on the abundance ratios of mt protein-mRNA. the levels of seven out of the eight up-regulated proteins were increased in 0 mitochondria. the up-regulated proteins were eIF4A1, PLG, HNRPM, XRCC6 (Ku70), XRCC5 (Ku80), APEX1 and STUB1. 264 proteins involved in functional modules ed their cDNAs to express GFP-hybrid proteins. we found 20 proteins that have not been annotated their localization in GO database. we chose five proteins that have available antibodies. up-regulated and down-regulated proteins of dysfunctional mt states were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. it has been suggested that proteins cooperate with other proteins as a part of functional module which tend to physically associated or share similar expression to deliver a certain biological function. ribonucleoprotein K (HNRPK) is a member of the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with mtDNA transcription. up-regulated functional modules act as cross-talk components connecting mitochondria with other organelles to sense and propagate the retrograde signal upon mtDNA depletion stress. on average, levels of 5.5% of the proteins in down-regulated functional modules were increased. the expression of up- and down-regulated proteins was controlled in several different levels. this indicated that up-regulated proteins were successfully recruited into 0 mitochondria. it has been proposed that there is a compensatory mt protein import pathway independent from the dissipated membrane potential. mitochondrial proteins were organized into functional modules to identify significantly altered biological processes under different cellular states. analysis of mt protein functional networks elucidated biological implications of mt regulatory mechanisms under dysfunctional mt states. d with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotics (100 g/ml penicillin/streptomycin mix) and uridine (50 g/ml) in humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 as described.
