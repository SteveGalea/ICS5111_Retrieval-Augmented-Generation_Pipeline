{"summary": "the olfactory epithelium is located adjacent to the respiratory epithelium. the virus damage the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb, leading to altered olfaction (7\u201311) the process of scent discrimination begins within the olfactory epithelium. granule cells express calretinin but not calbindin or tyrosine hydroxylase. little is known about the functions of these cells or how they are molecularly distinct from each other. tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons may be limited to certain regions of the brain. tdTomato mice contain a transgenic tdTomato cassette in a locus that is universally expressed. cells surviving the infection permanently express tdTomato even after virus is eliminated. a population of OB interneurons survived the infection. mice using red recombination with an arabinose-inducible Flp recombinase were infected with 4 104 rJ-Cre viruses. rJ-Cre was propagated and analyzed for its ability to replicate in tissue culture cells and to cause lethal encephalitis in mice. insertion of Cre gene had little to no effect on virus replication in 17Cl-1 cells compared to wild-type rJ. the brain via primary, secondary, and tertiary connections of the OB reached sites in the brainstem, amygdala, and midbrain by 7 days postinfection (dpi) by 11 dpi, robust tdTomato levels could be detected by confocal microscopy in neurons of the olfactory system. rJ-Cre expressed Cre recombinase in vivo. tdTomato-expressing cells remain after virus clearance. we harvested brains at 4, 7 and 11 dpi and assessed tdTomato and viral nucleocapsid protein expression using confocal microscopy. tdTomato expression lagged behind that of viral antigen. RNA was isolated from the olfactory bulbs of infected mice at the indicated time points. expression of subgenomic viral RNA was normalized to HPRT. levels of subgenomic RNA within the olfactory bulb were detected at 3 dpi. neurons surviving rJ-Cre infection were largely interneurons. interneurons comprised a large fraction of the cells that survived rJ infection. rJ-Cre-infected tdTomato mice were euthanized at 11 dpi. periglomerular interneurons of the glomerular cell layer can be calretinin, tyrosine hydroxylase, or calbindin positive. tdTomato-positive cells did not coexpress tdTomato. tdTomato+ parvalbumin+ cells also were not detected. some cells exhibited colocalization of IBA-1 and tdTomato after infection. but the pattern of colocalization appeared punctate and phenotypically different from the diffuse tdTomato expression detected in neurons. this pattern may represent microglia/macrophage phagocytosis of tdTomato+ cells as opposed to de novo tdTomato expression. brains from rJ-Cre-infected tdTomato mice were harvested at 11 dpi, cryosectioned, and visualized after topro-3 nuclear staining. yellow arrows indicate punctate tdTomato, CX3CR1-GFP double labeling. white arrows indicate surviving double-labeled cells. insertion of Cre gene had little to no effect on virus replication in 17Cl-1 cells compared to wild-type rJ. infection of mice with 4 104 rJ-Cre viruses resulted in mortality indistinguishable from those seen in mice infected with rJ. oculation of the animal before tdTomato expression was sufficiently elevated to be detected by confocal microscopy. by 11 dpi, robust tdTomato levels could be detected in neurons of the olfactory system, including neurons in the brainstem at sites known to be tertiary connections of the OB. the results indicated that rJ-Cre expressed Cre recombinase in vivo. tdTomato expression lagged behind that of viral antigen, likely reflecting the requirement for Cre expression, transport to the nucleus, DNA excision, and mRNA translation before protein can be expressed. we focused our studies on the OB because it is the first site of virus replication. arrow indicates a tdTomato+ N cell, while the white arrow indicates a tdTomato+ N+ cell; the remainder of the cells are positive for both tdTomato and N protein. a quantitative-PCR assay was used to determine levels of subgenomic viral RNA. expression of subgenomic RNA was normalized to HPRT. interneurons comprise a large fraction of the cells that survived rJ infection. rJ-Cre-infected tdTomato mice were euthanized at 11 dpi. high-power images of olfactory bulb interneurons stained with NeuroTrace. tdTomato-positive cells did not express any of these markers. tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing cells did not coexpress tdTomato. tdTomato+ parvalbumin+ and tdTomato+ calretinin+ cells were not detected. microglia/macrophages with a punctate pattern of tdTomato were near tdTomato+ neurons. however, uncommon cells with the typical morphology of microglia showed a more diffuse pattern of tdTomato expression in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. microglia/macrophages play a role in clearing virus-infected cells. dTomato mice were harvested at 11 dpi, cryosectioned, and visualized after topro-3 nuclear staining. yellow arrows indicate punctate tdTomato, CX3CR1-GFP double labeling. main challenge in studying neurons affected by virus infection is to identify and isolate those cells after virus has been cleared. our results provide proof of principle for using a Cre reporter model for studying cells surviving MHV infection in the central nervous system. GFAP and IBA1 staining confirmed that neurons preferentially survive rJ infection, since few astrocytes or microglia expressed tdTomato after infection. this results are consistent with previous work demonstrating tropism for neuronal cells, but also possible that glial cells survive infection less frequently. invade the CNS via the OB suggests that the olfactory epithelium, nerve, or bulb may limit viral spread to and within the CNS. some cells in the OB, especially interneurons, survive the initial virus infection. these cells are primarily inhibitory and modulate neuronal function. 17Cl-1 cells were infected with rJ at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. virus from the supernatant was combined prior to determining viral titers. levels of Cre expression were unchanged through 7 passages but were diminished by passage 8. RNA was transcribed into cDNA using the manufacturer's instructions. subgenomic RNA levels were measured on a QuantStudio qPCR 3 system. the results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as 2CT. sections were rinsed in PBS 3 times for 5 min each time. primary antibodies to GFAP (Sigma) at 1:10,000, IBA1 (Wako) at 1:2,000, parvalbumin (Sigma) at 1:1,000, tyrosine hydroxylase (Millipore) at 1:1,000, calretinin (Millipore) at 1:1,000. Cre recombinase was cloned into pBAC-JHMV as previously described. rJ-Cre virus was grown on 17Cl-1 cells, and virus titers were determined on HeLa-MHVR cells. five- to 6-week-old mice were intranasally inoculated with 40,000 PFU rJHM-Cre after isoflurane anesthesia. mice were sacrificed and perfused with phosphate-buffered saline. guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) is guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) by the following threshold cycle (CT) equation. all results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as 2CT. brains were cryoprotected by immersion in 10% sucrose for 30 min, followed by immersion in 20% sucrose for several hours. the sections were rinsed before incubation with a 1:200 dilution of an appropriate goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody. in some experiments, Vectashield containing DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was used."}
