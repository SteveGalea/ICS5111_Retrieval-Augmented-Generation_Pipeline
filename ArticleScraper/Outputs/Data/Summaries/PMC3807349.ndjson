{"summary": "innate immunity is the first line of host defense against pathogen invasion. the type I interferon (IFN-I) system plays a crucial role for vertebrates in controlling viral infections. the activated NF-B and interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 collaborate to trigger the expression of IFN-I. herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is the archetypal member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. HSV-1 ICP0 targets IRF3 and blocks IFN production. UL36USP is highly specific for ubiquitin and cleaves K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains but not ubiquitin-like proteins. UL36USP is detectable as early as 12 h postinfection and only after cleavage of UL36USP from full-length. posi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), 49, and mouse herpesvirus strain 68 (MHV68) suggest an important role during viral infection. ubiquitination has a crucial role in regulating the innate immune response. the WT HSV-1 F strain and its derivative UL36USP mutant HSV-1 strain were propagated in Vero cells. the protease inhibitor cocktail mixture was purchased from CST (Boston, MA) mice anti-Myc, anti-Flag, and antihemagglutinin (anti-HA) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were purchased from eBioscience, Inc. (San Diego, CA) RNA isolation, semiquantitative RT-PCR, and quantification of gel image. total RNA was extracted from HEK293T cells with TRIzol. the details of the protocols have been described previously. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with SeV (100 hemagglutination units [HAU]/ml) for 16 h. then luciferase assays were performed as previously described (23) with a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) the membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG. protein bands specific to the antibody were developed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (BCIP)-nitroblue tetrazolium. the gel was prerun with 25 mM Tris and 192 mM glycine. the recombinant viruses were validated by PCR and sequencing using primers upstream or downstream of the UL36 mutant sites. then viruses were harvested, and the growth kinetics of the recombinant viruses were characterized by both traditional plaque assay and luciferase activity assay in vero cells at a multiplicity of infection. four-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 106 PFU of the indicated virus. after 24 h, the mice were sacrificed and a Legend Max mouse IFN- ELISA kit was used to detect the IFN- in serum. rabbit anti-Ub pAb, and mouse anti-actin MAb were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) all enzymes used for cloning procedures, except for T4 DNA ligase, were purchased from TaKaRa (Dalian, China) to construct UL36USP-Flag, the N-terminal 500-amino-acid (aa) region of UL36 was amplified from plasmid UL36 cDNA was used as a template for semiquantitative PCR to investigate expression patterns of human IFN-, ISG54, and ISG56. HEK293T cells were plated on 24-well dishes (Corning, NY) in DMEM (Gibco-BRL, MD) with 10% FBS at a density of 1 105 cells per well overnight before transfection. cells were then cotransfected with 1 g expression plasmid, 500 the lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies and 30 l of a 1:1 slurry of protein A/G PLUS-agarose overnight at 4\u00b0C. the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl. western blot analysis was performed to detect the interaction of proteins. two-step Red-mediated recombination was applied to construct UL36(C40A) HSV-1 (67). the Kanr cassette was amplified by PCR with a pair of primers containing 40-bp-homology flanking sequence of mutant sites. then the PCR product was transformed into E. coli GS1783 competent cells carrying the pHSV-1 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) via electroporation. HEK293T cells were infected with the indicated viruses. growth curves were generated by luciferase activity assays. expression of ICP0, UL42, and UL46 was detected by Western blotting. UL36USP was coexpressed in HEK293T cells in the presence of IFN- reporter. ectopic expression of UL36USP significantly suppressed SeV-mediated activation of the IFN- promoter activity. the NS1 served as a positive control. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with IFN--Luc reporter plasmid, the pRL-TK control plasmid along with empty vector, and plasmids encoding UL36USP or influenza virus NS1 protein. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with 100 HAU/ml SeV or mock infected. semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to detect the mRNA levels of ISG54 and ISG56. the presence of UL36USP inhibited the seV-mediated IRF3 dimerization of IRF3. the presence of UL36USP inhibited the seV-mediated IRF3 dimer formation. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with either pRDIII-I-Luc (A) or NF-B reporter plasmid (B) and empty vector or plasmids encoding indicated viral proteins. all expression constructs resulted in a 110- to 800-fold induction of the IFN--Luc reporter activity (Fig. 3A to E). promoter activation driven by TBK1, IKK, or IRF3/5D was inhibited about 90% by UL36USP. UL36USP inhibits the IFN- promoter activity between the level of MAVS and TBK1/IKK. UL36USP deubiquitinates both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF3. HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-Ub, HA-K63-Ub or HA-K48-Ub. UL36USP deubiquitinates both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF3. co-IP experiments indicated that UL36USP inhibited the seV-mediated recruitment of TBK1 by TRAF3. more TBK1 was coimmunoprecipitated by TRAF3 after SeV stimulation. UL36 C40A mutant virus induced a larger amount of IFN- than WT virus. luciferase activity assay showed that replication of C40A HSV-1 was remarkably impaired compared with that of WT HSV-1. a remarkably higher level of transcription of ISG54 and ISG56 was observed in C40A HSV-1-infected HEK293T cells at 12 and 24 h postinfection. cells and C57BL/6 mice infected with C40A HSV-1 produce more IFN- than those infected with WT HSV-1. co-IP experiments were performed to detect the ubiquitination of TRAF3. HEK293T cells were infected as in panel A. seV induced a high level of IFN- mRNA as a positive control. the C40A mutant viruses induced a significantly higher level of IFN- mRNA than WT HSV-1 did in all three cells. ELISAs were performed to measure the secretion of IFN-. DLR assays showed that ectopic expression of UL36USP significantly suppressed SeV-mediated activation of the IFN--Luc reporter activity. the NS1 served as a positive control, and UL36USP also inhibited the poly(I C)-induced IFN- promoter activity. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with 100 HAU/ml SeV. luciferase activity was measured 16 h postinfection. plasmids encoding UL36USP or influenza virus NS1 protein. UL36USP inhibited seV-induced transcription of ISG54 and ISG56. expression of wild-type UL36USP significantly inhibited seV-induced transcription of ISG54 and ISG56 mRNA expression. the presence of the C40A mutant did not affect expression of ISG56. UL36USP inhibits seV-mediated IRF3 and NF-B promoter activation. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with either pRDIII-I-Luc (A) or NF-B reporter plasmid (B) twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with 100 HAU/ml SeV. UL36USP inhibits the IFN- promoter activity between the level of MAVS and TBK1. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with IFN--Luc reporter, PRL-TK and RIG-IN (A), IPS-1 (B), TBK1 (C), IKK (D), or IRF3/5D (E) expression plasmids. UL36USP deubiquitinates both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF3. HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-Ub, HA-K63-Ub or HA-K48-Ub expression plasmid. co-IP experiments indicated UL36USP inhibited the seV-mediated recruitment of TBK1 by TRAF3. more TBK1 was coimmunoprecipitated by UL36USP after seV stimulation. UL36 C40A mutant virus induced a larger amount of IFN- than WT virus. luciferase activity assays were used to determine replication kinetics of UL36USP. ICP0, UL42, and UL46 expression in C40A HSV-1-infected HEK293T cells was also reduced. a remarkably higher level of transcription of ISG54 and ISG56 was observed in HEK293T cells at 12 and 24 h postinfection. HEK293T cells in a 24-cell plate were infected with WT HSV-1 or C40A HSV-1 at an MOI of 5 for 16 h. co-IP experiments were performed to detect the ubiquitination of TRAF3. C40A HSV-1 induced a significantly higher level of IFN- mRNA than WT HSV-1 did in all three cell lines. ELISAs were performed to measure the secretion of IFN-. a number of viruses encode DUBs to manipulate cellular processes. several viral DUBs could cleave both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. PLpro is a papain-like protease of foot-and-mouth disease virus. arterivirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) can also remove ubiquitin from cellular proteins. ectopic expression of UL36USP was sufficient to downregulate IFN- promoter activity. UL36USP inhibited the activities of RIG-IN and MAVS. a single-step growth curve assays of VP1/2 C65A mutant HSV-1 in rabbit skin cells indicated that the C65A mutation of HSV-1 did not affect viral replication. the replication of C40A HSV-1 was also examined in HEK293T cells. most of these viral proteins, including UL36, are components of the tegument. they are released into the cytoplasm immediately after viral entry. the role of ICP0 in immune evasion might be exaggerated in the context of HSV-1 infection. UL36USP was identified to deubiquitinate TRAF3 and suppress IFN- production. these findings reveal a novel mechanism for HSV-1 to evade host antiviral immunity."}
