{"summary": "search strategy was limited to studies published after April 1, 2009, following the start of the 2009 pandemic. authors reported 1 or more population-based estimates of the HFR or sufficient data to calculate an HFR. the HFR for a cohort of individuals is estimated as the number of H1N1pdm09-associated deaths divided by the number of H1N1pdm09 hospitalizations in the same cohort. it is also possible to estimate the HFR in a population, as the number of H1N1pdm09 deaths divided by the number of H1N1pdm09 hospitalizations in the same population. data were extracted independently and entered onto a standardized form by 2 of the authors (C.M.S. and E.Y.S.) the primary data extracted were the estimates of the HFR, the estimates or counts of the number of H1N1pdm09-associated hospitalized deaths (numerator) and the estimates or counts of the number of H1N1pdm09 hospitalized cases (denominator) meta-regression analyses were conducted using a mixed-effects model (6). we defined the first year of the pandemic as the period from 2009 to mid-2010. all analyses were conducted with R, version 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) studies that reported estimates of the HFR only in population subgroups, such as pregnant women or persons at higher risk of severe illness if infected (e.g., those with chronic health conditions), were excluded. study quality was not formally assessed, although we did analyze the association of study design factors with heterogeneity in the HFR. hospitalized cases were those occurring in persons confirmed to have influenza virus infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, rapid antigen test, or viral culture from an inpatient test. the primary data extracted were the estimates of the HFR, the estimates or counts of the number of H1N1pdm09-associated hospitalized deaths (numerator), and the estimates or counts of the number of hospitalized cases (denominator) we examined HFR estimates according to study design (cohort studies vs. discordant-source studies), age group, year of virus circulation, a country's per capita gross domestic product (10) and geographical location. RESULTS Of the 3,886 titles initially identified, 411 full-length articles were selected, of which 232 were subsequently excluded (Web Table 1) and 179 were included. c PCR and/or viral culture; PCR or viral culture or RAT; PCR or RAT; PCR or RAT or direct/indirect fluorescent antibody assay; PCR or viral culture or a 4-fold rise in antibodies against H1N1pdm09 virus; and PCR and/or positive epidemiologic evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome. 1 publication estimated the HFR for 9 european countries (12) and 2 other publications reported on 2 and 4 specified countries (13, 14) 40.2% (72/179) of the HFR studies were conducted in tertiary-care referral hospitals. males comprise 30% to 75% of cases, and 2%\u201396% of cases had at least 1 underlying comorbid condition. the highest HFRs for children, adults, and the elderly were 16%, 68%, and 33% respectively, all in India (15\u201317). the highest HFRs for children, adults, and the elderly were 16%, 68%, and 33% respectively, all in India (15\u201317). m09 as compared with seasonal influenza was 0.92 (95% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.18) an I2 value of 0 was found when the data were fitted to a random-effects model. we did not find sufficient estimates of the HFR for seasonal influenza in adults or the elderly. 0.0055, 0.0209 0.0108 0.0550, 0.0766 0.0183 0.0808, 0.1174 Central/South America 0.0408d 0.0157, 0.0660 NA NA Asia 0.0012 0.0107, 0.0131 0.0008 0.0789, 0.0774 0.1847 0.0251, 0.3946 Australia/New Zealand NA 0.0350 0.1255, 0.0554 NA Othere 0.0716d 0.1325, 0.0108 NA NA Abbreviations: CI compared with children, adults and the elderly tended to have a higher risk of death if hospitalized with H1N1pdm09. however, the absolute mortality burden was lower in the elderly because of the lower primary risk of infection. countries with lower GDPs would likely have had higher thresholds for hospital admission and ICU treatment. our analysis showed a higher HFR for central and south America than for other geographical regions. antiviral treatment was also found to be delayed in the region due to the rapid spread of the virus and the lack of familiarity with oseltamivir among physicians. the use of oseltamivir varied in different countries. the pooled risk ratio, comparing seasonal influenza with pandemic influenza, suggested similar levels of severity among children. but relative severity estimates may be easier to compare than absolute estimates, since relative estimates control to some extent for study design, GDP, location, year of virus circulation, and hospital type. a few countries reported 2 or more waves within the first year of the pandemic. a few countries reported 2 or more waves within the first year of the pandemic. a few countries reported 2 or more waves within the first year of the pandemic. if interpreted in the context of population wealth, geographical setting, hospital type, and study design, the HFR could provide an early measure of the severity of infection with a future pandemic virus. however, since the HFR measures the fatality risk among only the more severe cases, it does not reflect the clinical profile of the vast majority of symptomatic cases."}
