{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks third in the cause of cancer death. it has several malignant biological properties including aggressive growth, frequent metastases, and poor survival rates. therapy of HCC includes surgery, radiation, transarterial chemoembolization, transplantation, and systemic chemotherapy. the lentiviral vector of short harpin RNA (shRNA) against IGF-1R gene is able to be applied to gene function studies and gene therapy for cancers and other diseases [13\u201315]. RESULTS IGF-1R mRNA is up-regulated in HCC cells and human HCC tissues. there were no differences between the high and low IGF-1R mRNA expression groups regarding age, sex, tumor size, and AFP level. the above results suggest that IGF-1R overexpression is involved in HCC development and is closely correlated to poor tumour differentiation and TEPV. lentivirus-mediated RNAi effectively suppresses the expression of IGF-1R mRNA and protein in HCC cells. western blot showed that the amount of IGF-1R protein in the cells of IGF-1R siRNA group was also decreased greatly compared with the negative control or blank control. Knockdown of IGF-1R significantly inhibits proliferation of HCC cells. treatment of both Huh7 and Hep3B cells with lentivirus-mediated IGF-1R RNAi was associated with a time-dependent inhibition of the cell proliferation. knockdown of IGF-1R expression remarkably decreased the migrated (Figure 5A\u20135C) and invaded (Figure 5D 5F) number of both Huh7and Hep3B cells compared with the cells treated with negative control, or the untreated cells (blank control). this outcome indicates that IGF-1R inhibition promotes the apoptosis of the HCC cells. the level of AFP secretion was measured in the cell culture supernatants using an chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) the results indicated that silencing of IGF-1R significantly decreased the AFP level of both Huh7 and Hep3B cells compared with the cells treated with negative control. one mouse in the negative control group and two mice in the blank control group showed tumor metastasis in the lung. the level of the serum AFP in the IGF-1R siRNA group mice was significantly lower than that in the negative control group mice or in the blank control group mice. a total of 79 differentially expressed cytokine proteins exhibited a more than or equal to 2-fold change. of these, 35 were down-regulated and 44 were up-regulated. the top 5 cytokines that were down-regulated or up-regulated were shown in Figure 8A\u20138C. we then explored the role of midkine in inhibition of HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion mediated by IGF-1R knockdown. the top 10 cytokines that were down-regulated (A) or up-regulated (B) were presented compared with negative control. tumor tissues of nude mice with IGF-1R knockdown were transfected with 1 g midkine expression vector pcDNA3.1(+)-midkine (IGF-1R siRNA+ Midkine) or empty vector pcDNA3.1(+) only (IGF-1R siRNA+Empty) the mean of the relative IGF-1R mRNA level was 17.38 for all the HCC tissues studied. we arbitrarily considered samples with the relative IGF-1R expression equal to or above 17.38 as high IGF-1R expressers. no differences between the high and low IGF-1R mRNA expression groups regarding age, sex, tumor size, and AFP level. 0.05 versus NALT, **P 0.01 versus MANT or NALT. HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma, matched adjacent nontumorous tissues. NALT, normal adult liver tissues. western blot showed that the amount of IGF-1R protein in the cells of IGF-1R siRNA group was also decreased greatly compared with the negative control or blank control group. this finding suggests that the lentivirus-mediated IGF-1R silencing can efficiently down-regulate IGF-1R expression in Huh7 and Hep3B cells. cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT. the results of cell growth were expressed by absorbance at 490 nm. Knockdown of IGF-1R induces the apoptosis of HCC cells. knockdown of IGF-1R knockdown decreased AFP secretion of HCC cells. both the migrated and invaded number of Huh7 and Hep3B cells with IGF-1R knockdown was significantly decreased compared with negative control or blank control. the serum AFP level in the IGF-1R siRNA group mice was significantly lower compared with negative control or blank control. knockdown of IGF-1R suppresses Huh7 xenograft tumorigenesis and metastasis in nude mice. significant differences between IGF-1R siRNA and negative control or blank control group (n = 8/group) (P 0.05) for every four days from day 12 to day 5. lentivirus-IGF-1R siRNA knockdown induces a forceful antineoplastic activity in HCC in vivo. 79 differentially expressed cytokines exhibited a more than or equal to 2-fold change. of these, 35 were down-regulated and 44 were up-regulated. the top 5 cytokines that were down-regulated (A) or up-regulated (B) were shown in Figure 8A\u20138C. cells with IGF-1R knockdown were presented compared with negative control. the scanning signal was weaker in Huh7 cells with IGF-1R knockdown compared with negative control. RNAi is a relatively new technology and shows promise for the development of therapeutic gene knockdown. lentivirus can efficiently infect both dividing and non-dividing cells. lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting human IGF-1R gene was highly capable of stable knockdown of IGF-1R mRNA and protein expression in Huh7 and Hep3B cells. lentivirus-mediated RNAi targeting IGF-1R could lead to the remarkable proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and reduction of invasion activity in osteosarcoma cells. in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that IGF-1R inhibition may play a significant role in the development, progression, and metastasis of HCC. this is the first study that demonstrates the therapeutic value of IGF-1R inhibition by lentivirus-mediated RNAi in vivo. we demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of midkine remarkably remedied inhibition of Huh7 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion caused by IGF-1R suppression. the reduced midkine expression may contribute, at least in part, to significantly reduced HCC proliferation, migration, and invasion capability. sequences of shRNA targeting human IGF-1R gene were synthesized and cloned into a lentiviral vector pLVX-shRNA2 (Clontech, CA, USA) the sequences were synthesized and cloned into a lentiviral vector pLVX-shRNA2 (Clontech, CA, USA) cells were divided into 3 groups: the IGF-1R siRNA group (Huh7 and Hep3B cells infected with lentivirus-IGF-1R siRNA), the negative control group (Huh7 and Hep3B cells infected without the lentiviral particles) the positive transductants were sorted by flow cytometry with standard FITC filter sets (ZsGreen1 in pLVX-shRNA2 vector has an excitation maximum of 493 nm cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates at a density of 1 104 cells per well. cells were lysed in dimethyl sulfoxide, and optical density at 490 nm was determined. each point was determined in triplicate. matrigel was added into each Transwell upper chamber and placed in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 2 h to solidify. the cells were seeded in the transwell upper chamber and stained with crystal violet. each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated three times. mice were monitored every other day for tumor size. the largest (a) and smallest (b) superficial diameters of tumors were measured with vernier calipers. the tumor volume (mm3) (= a b2 0.5) was calculated. cell culture Huh7, Hep3B, HL-7702, and 293T cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD, USA) all cell lines were maintained in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. lentiviral particles (lentivirus-IGF-1R siRNA and lentivirus-negative control) were produced by co-transfection of pLVX-shRNA2 vectors with Lenti-XTM HTX Packaging System (Clontech) into 293T cells according to manufacturer's instructions. about 48 h after transfection, the lentiviruses were harvested. each experiment was repeated thrice and all reactions were carried out in triplicate. Western blot Protein extraction from the cell lines or tumor tissues isolated from the nude mice was performed as described previously. apoptosis was detected by a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) the experiment was independently repeated three times. the transwells were left uncoated or coated with Matrigel. mice were injected subcutaneously into the right flank with 5 106 Huh7 cells expressing IGF-1R siRNA. mice were randomized into the IGF-1R siRNA, negative control, and blank control groups. they were injected intracutaneously with about 6 107 copies of lentivirus-IGF-1R siRNA. the signals (wavelength of 532 nm) were scanned using innoScan 300 microarray scanner. Statistical analysis Categorical data were evaluated by 2 or Fisher's exact tests. results were considered statistically significant at P 0.05."}
