{"summary": "the submerged Iceberg of Celiac Disease and the Dilemma of Seronegativity Celiac disease (CD) are the most common autoimmune enteropathy. a prevalence of 1:133 was calculated, meaning that about 1% of the global population is affected. despite these evidences, patients with diagnosed CD are much fewer than the estimated prevalence. latent CD is a vague and largely used term indicating various conditions. it may denote a normal villous architecture with abnormalities such as increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and/or increased mucosal permeability even in the absence of serological markers. the term (potential) is also used in the case of suspected SNCD. SNCD prevalence ranges from 1.03% among all CD patients [21] to 28% in latent CD [22]. anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and endomysium antibodies (EMA) in cases of non-atrophic celiac disease (CD) a strong antigen-antibody connection could explain negative serological tests. in SNCD, auto-antibodies cross the mucosa and enter blood vessels. in SNCD, antibodies may be confined in the lamina propria rather than in the bloodstream. selective IgA deficiency (sIgAD), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) are analyzed. sIgAD is the most common primary ID, with a prevalence of 1:300\u2013700 individuals. 45% of sIgAD patients have at least one copy of this haplotype. sIgAD is more common in celiac patients, with a prevalence of 1:39 [44]. IgG-tTG, IgG-DGP, IgG-EMA Lenhardt, A. et al., 2004 [42] 8.7% (11/126) IgG-tTG, IgG-EMA Total 8% (261/3259) tTG, tissue transglutaminase, DGP, deamidated gliadin peptide; EMA, endomysium antibodies. sIgAD patients are at high risk of Giard sIgAD-CD patients had higher IEL infiltrates than those with sIgAD alone. sIgAD-CD had more CD25+ cells (T regulatory lymphocytes) in the lamina propria than isolated sIgAD. sIgAD-CD expressed elevated levels of BLyS, a molecule involved in several autoimmune diseases. a cytokine profile of sIgAD-CD was characterized by an enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines (namely interleukin-2, interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha) the findings suggest that sIgAD and CD are characterized by signs of an impaired immune activation. the diagnosis relies on reduced levels of IgG and IgA, as well as an absent or reduced antibody production in response to vaccines. several common polymorphisms in HLA loci have been detected. the corresponding histopathological pattern has been described as a sprue-like picture, resembling CD: villous atrophy. in 30% of CVID patients, the true prevalence of CD in CVID is much lower. the histologic response to a GFD is the only reliable tool to establish the diagnosis of CD in CVID. other authors have suggested that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) determination may be helpful. sIgMD is a very rare disorder, defined by low levels of IgM. sIgMD causes a severe alteration in maturation and function of B lymphocytes. patients with sIgMD have low levels of non-switched memory B cells. a sIgMD patient with SNCD showed villous atrophy with diffuse immature lymphocytes at duodenal biopsy. the 18-year-old patient complained about abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss and showed villous atrophy with diffuse immature lymphocytes. the villous architecture was restored and mucosal tissue transglutaminase mRNA was comparable to that of healthy subjects. 45% of sIgAD patients have at least one copy of this haplotype. sIgAD is more common in celiac patients, with a prevalence of 1:39 [44]. IgG-tTG, IgG-DGP, IgG-EMA Lenhardt, A. et al., 2004 [42] 8.7% (11/126) IgG-tTG, IgG-EMA Total 8% (261/3259) tTG, tissue transglutaminase, DGP, deamidated gliadin peptide; EMA, endomysium antibodies. sIgAD patients are at high risk of Giard sIgAD-CD patients had higher IEL infiltrates than those with sIgAD alone. sIgAD-CD had more CD25+ cells (T regulatory lymphocytes) in the lamina propria than isolated sIgAD. sIgAD-CD expressed elevated levels of B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) a cytokine profile of sIgAD-CD was characterized by an enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines (namely interleukin-2, interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha) the findings suggest that sIgAD and CD are characterized by signs of an impaired immune activation. the diagnosis relies on reduced levels of IgG and IgA, as well as an absent or reduced antibody production in response to vaccines. several common polymorphisms in HLA loci have been detected. a corresponding histopathological pattern has been described as a sprue-like picture. CVID should be suspected when plasma cells are reduced or absent in the lamina propria. CD serology has shown to be ineffective in CVID due to the high rate of false negatives, caused by the fact that CVID patients cannot mount an appropriate antibody response. the true prevalence of CD in CVID is much lower, as reported in Table 3. sIgMD causes a severe alteration in maturation and function of B lymphocytes. a reduced number of IgM-secreting B cells with a failure of secreted Ig chain mRNA synthesis and decreased antigen proliferation IgM responses have been observed. a sIgMD patient with SNCD showed villous atrophy with diffuse immature lymphocytes at duodenal biopsy. the 18-year-old patient complained about abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. however, tissue transglutaminase mRNA mucosal levels had a six-fold increase. a condition of villous atrophy or duodenal lymphocytosis may be linked to other disorders such as alimentary atopy, inflammatory bowel disease, parasitic or viral infections and drugs such as olmesartan [22,88,89,90], all conditions demanding differential diagnosis. in table 4, we summarize the main causes of duodenal lymphocytosis and villous atrophy, classified according to etiological criteria. odenal mucosa showed a specificity of 100%, much better than the 87% achieved with anti-tTG2 IgA subepithelial deposit analysis. anti-tTG and EMA detection in enterocyte culture improved the sensitivity and specificity by about 10% compared to traditional serology. rare alleles, such as DQ A1*05, have been proven to be linked to some cases of CD (even with seronegativity) despite many attempts, a reliable tool for CD detection in ID has not been found."}
