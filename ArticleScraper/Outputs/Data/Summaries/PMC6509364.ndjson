{"summary": "study aimed to compare the indicators of management of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in contacts and to identify the impact of active tuberculosis (TB) index case characteristics on the exposed population in congregated settings. about 10% of people infected with latent TB progress to active TB. the focus of the policy has been directed to the need for the reduction of TB cases through active detection and management of LTBI patients. study aimed to identify factors influencing the occurrence of latent TB in the exposed population in congregated settings. no studies have determined the indicators of the management of latent TB, based on the type of facility and the year. the number of clusters and contacts analyzed by process are shown in Fig. 1. Flow chart of clusters and contacts by process. LTBI = latent tuberculosis infection. deemed necessary to treat (individuals aged 35 years or younger, susceptible to isoniazid and rifampin, not immunosuppressed, no history of TB infection or treatment, and non-diabetic) the rate of treatment initiation was defined as the percentage of people who needed and were started on treatment. o f p e r s o n s w i t h L T B I 100 R a t e o f i n i t i a t i o n o f i t i a t i o n o f p e r s o n s w h o w e r the general characteristics of the first index case in the TB outbreak groups were described using univariate analysis according to the types of facilities. Mean values and 95% confidence intervals were also evaluated to determine the rates of diagnosis, need for treatment, treatment initiation, and treatment completion of LTBI in each TB outbreak group. the median value of the odds ratios (ORs) in one group with a higher tendency and another with a lower tendency is always 1 or more. an MOR value of 1 implies no variation between levels; the MOR value increases when there are considerable variations between levels. 8,648 TB clusters were available for the present study. the number of clusters and contacts analyzed by process were shown in Fig. 1. Flow chart of clusters and contacts. LTBI = latent tuberculosis infection. the rate of treatment initiation was defined as the percentage of people who needed and were started on treatment (n = 25,002) the rate of completion of treatment was defined as the percentage of people who completed the treatment schedule (n = 19,562) o f p e r s o n s w h o w h o w e r e j u d g e d t o n e e e d t r e a t m e n t f o r r e a t m e n t f o r r the general characteristics of the first index case in the TB outbreak groups were described using univariate analysis according to the types of facilities. Mean values and 95% confidence intervals were also evaluated to determine the rates of diagnosis, need for treatment, treatment initiation, and treatment completion of LTBI in each TB outbreak group. MOR is a value that evaluates the degree of variation in outcome variables at the higher-level cluster (year in the present study) compared to the individual level. an MOR value of 1 implies no variation between levels; the MOR value increases when there are considerable variations between levels. the proportion of cases with cavity-negative TB was the highest at 61.5% (5,320 clusters), followed by cavity-positive cases, at 26.7% (2,306 clusters). the highest duration of symptoms for the index case was 1\u20133 weeks (3,371 clusters, 39.0%), followed by those with no symptoms (2,551 clusters, 29.5%), and those with symptoms for 4\u20135 weeks (1,275 clusters, 14.7%). for epidemiological investigation by year, the rate for the the total LTBI diagnosis rate for contacts who completed the latent TB test was 15.2% (95% CI, 14.8%\u201315.6%) the highest LTBI diagnosis rates by type of facility, were noted in correctional institutions. by year, the need for treatment of

had 1.11-fold higher rate of need for treatment of contacts with latent TB compared to women cases. other facilities except the workplace had significantly higher ORs of treatment initiation rate in contacts (P 0.01) by year cluster, the treatment initiation rate in latent TB became significantly lower in the most recent year. the number of epidemiological investigations for TB among congregated facilities in Korea was started in schools from 2013. the number of epidemiological investigations rapidly increased with age, beginning from when the first index case was aged > 13 years. in congregated settings with many children, the risk of developing active TB is higher. inmates stay, living together in small rooms with short periods of outdoor activities, seemed to enhance TB transmission. in 2015, 87 doctors working in correctional institutions were in charge of 54,581 prisoners. one doctor treated about 200 prisoners every day. this could be delayed identification of prisoners infected with active TB. patients with LTBI aged 35 years have been included as treatment targets since 2015. workplaces had lower treatment completion rates of latent TB. this could be attributed to the large numbers of individuals aged 35 years. schools may be classified into kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school, and college; other facilities also have sub-types. in previous studies, the highest number of contact cases in Korean schools was found in high schools. a strategy is needed to increase the completion rate among contacts in other facilities. a cohort of contact and latent TB cases should be established to monitor the status of management and the occurrence of active TB in the long-term. accessibility to medical institutions should be improved to facilitate timely access to medical services in case of suspected TB symptoms. a system that transfers information about latent TB patients to the corresponding community health centers after discharge from the congregated settings. this will serve to raise treatment completion rates in patients with latent TB."}
