{"summary": "cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingestion of toxigenic serogroups O1 and O139 of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. the global burden of cholera is estimated to be 2.9 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually. most cases are reported to WHO from sub-saharan Africa (4). a single dose of Shanchol showed an efficacy of 63% against severely dehydrating cholera in the short term (6 months) CDC has conducted several evaluations of OCV use in emergency settings. a postcampaign and postcampaign KAP survey showed an increase in availability of soap and handwashing stations. 1 million doses of Euvichol were released for use in hurricane-affected departments in Haiti. most recently, 1 million doses of Euvichol were released for use in hurricane-affected departments. CDC was part of the Haiti OCV taskforce that led monitoring and evaluation of the campaign. two typhoid vaccines have been available for use in several countries since the 1990s. the first is a single-dose injectable polysaccharide vaccine based on the purified Typhi Vi antigen. the second is a multidose, live attenuated, oral Ty21a vaccine available as a capsule formulation for persons 5 years of age. CDC has been working with partners to plan, monitor, and evaluate emergency use of typhoid vaccine. a small proportion of vaccine was also used in an area not affected by the cyclone but that had experienced a typhoid outbreak during the same period. a global vaccine shortage caused by a recall on certain lots of the Sanofi ViPS vaccine precluded vaccine use. yellow fever caused 51,000\u2013380,000 severe cases and 19,000\u2013180,000 deaths in Africa in 2013 (34). current yellow fever vaccines are live attenuated vaccines manufactured from 2 substrains of the 17D strain. 97.5% of recipients showed development of protective levels of antibodies. a fractional (1/5; 0.1 mL) dose of yellow fever vaccine was administered to all nonpregnant adults and children >2 years of age. pregnant women and children 9 months2 years of age received the full dose. if the fractional dose is found to induce a sufficient immune response, this result would provide supporting evidence for fractional-dose yellow fever vaccination. sporadic outbreaks have been reported since 1976 (41) within the genus Ebolavirus (family Filoviridae) 4 species are known to cause human disease: Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Sudan ebolavirus, TaiForest ebolavirus, and Bundibugyo ebolavirus. the outbreak in west africa during 2014\u20132016 was the largest filovirus disease outbreak recorded. STRIVE evaluated the largest safety sample in which no vaccine-associated adverse events were observed for nearly 8,000 participants. rapid access to vaccine for at-risk groups is regarded as a major adjunctive measure for consideration in future outbreak response. CDC is engaged in assisting countries to incorporate vaccination delivery into emergency response plans. rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is not expected until 2019, and additional candidate vaccines continue to be studied in clinical trials (47\u201351). plans for emergency ring vaccination with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine should take into account new evidence and guidance to support use of alternate vaccine candidates or strategies. the Ebola epidemic accelerated vaccine clinical trials and could set a precedent for rapid clinical development of countermeasures for future infectious disease outbreaks. the integration of vaccination with emergency response to VPD outbreaks will continue to augment global health security."}
