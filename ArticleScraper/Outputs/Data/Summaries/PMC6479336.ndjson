{"summary": "infection-induced inflammation within the brain dramatically increases infiltration and migration of T-lymphocytes which play a critical role in antiviral defense. suppression of inflammation is equally important in limiting tissue damage and preserving neurological function. activation of the PD-1 receptor by its ligand PD-L1 results in functional suppression of brain-infiltrating T-cells. this results in controlled neuroinflammation, suppression of disease severity, and limited bystander tissue damage. blocking the PD-1: PD-L1 negative checkpoint results in the attack of infected glia by effector T-cells resulting in rapid viral clearance. microglial cells, originating from yolk sac progenitors, represent 5\u201320% of the total glial cells in mice [22,23,24,25] microglia modulate both innate (cytokine and chemokine production) and adaptive (T-cell activation) immune functions required for recruitment of infiltrating effector immune cells. microglia present antigen to T-cells (that express PD-1), expression of inhibitory co-stimulatory molecules like PD astrocytes up-regulate PD-L1 expression after treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines which decreases activation of human CD8+ T-cells. microglia also upregulate PD-1 upon infection induced inflammation. the upregulation of PD-L1 limits CNS pathology through suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines production from brain infiltrating T-cells. a preponderance of IFN-- vs. IL-17-producing T-cells in the CNS of PD-L1/ mice indicates this pathway mainly inhibits function of TH-1 cells. bTRMs are a distinct class of memory CD8+ T-cells that are self-renewing, highly protective against subsequent infections, and permanently reside at sites of infection, disconnected from circulation. high PD-1 expression on bTRM is an inherent property, ingrained and independent of both antigen and inflammation. blocking PD-L1 on either microglia or astrocytes results in reduced expression of CD103, along with reduced CD127 on CD69+CD8+ T-cells. authors also demonstrated the critical role of PD-L1 in the maintenance of bTRM in the CNS. a number of studies have examined the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway in CNS infections. in a human post-mortem study, expression of PD-L1 was observed on microglia and astrocytes in the demyelinating disease MS brain lesions. PD-L1 expression on microglia, as well as on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes has also been reported to negatively regulate T-cell activation. microglia from EAE mice upregulated PD-L1 along with MHC II and CD86. microglia inhibited antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferation. PD-L1 suppresses EAE severity and disease progression. PD-L1 mice showed a quicker onset of clinical symptoms. PD-L1 does not protect oligodendrocytes directly from immune attack. but PD-L1 dampens ongoing immune activation. PD-L1 deficiency converted the 129S4/SvJae strain from resistant to EAE-susceptible. PD-L1 expression on 70% of the infected neurons prevents viral control resulting in neuroinvasion, enhanced CNS viral load, and mortality. many human carcinomas and some T-cell tumors express PD-L1 on their cell surface. PD-L1 expression has been shown to be upregulated on tumor-associated macrophages/microglia in primary central nervous system lymphoma. the most widely used and successful immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently monoclonal antibodies which target PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) these PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory antibodies have been used as frontline treatment for various types of cancers, such as metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCCs), and bladder or urothelial cancer. some patients receiving PD-1 pathway blockade therapy reported seizure, cognitive changes, neurologic dysfunction, and perilesional edema as some of the toxicities. the precise mechanisms behind irAEs are not clear, but appear to be mainly attributed to events mediated by antibodies, T-cells, and cytokine storms. a PD-1 blockade antibody was not able to enter the CNS during acute viral infection. this makes therapeutic targeting of PD-1: PD-L1 pathway challenging. a recent review highlighted T-cell mediated antibody access thereby blocking the replication of neurotropic viruses. PD-1: PD-L1 checkpoint blockade may provide therapeutic approaches for enhancing antiviral activity and clearance of viral brain reservoirs."}
