{"summary": "feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) have worldwide distribution. the virus is a virus that belongs to the Vesivirus genus and the Caliciviridae family. it has a small, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. more than 90% of the cats are seropositive to FHV. 45% remain latently infected with 45% shedding the virus by all life long. vaccine does not appear to be protective (4). prevalence of FCV has varied from 15% to 31% (2, 12, 16) whereas values ranging from less than 1% to 63% have been estimated for the prevalence of FHV-1 (2, 13, 15) these viruses are still prevalent in the feline population despite the fact that vaccination against FCV and FHV-1 has been practiced since the 1970s. the samples were collected from 302 cats from veterinary clinics and hospitals, residences, breeding catteries and experimental populations. the samples were collected from animals in the following counties of the Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. cultures exhibiting CPE were investigated for presence of feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) or both viruses using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. three blind passages were performed for cultures not exhibiting CPE. the cDNA was used as a template for the PCR for FCV identification. the primer sequences were 8F (forward) 5' - CACSTTATGTCYGACACTGA - 3' (position 6142 B region) and 8R (reverse) 5' - CTRGADGTRTGCARRATTT - 3' (position 7097 F region), based on the FCV-F9 strain. 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s and a final extension of 7 min at 72\u00b0C. a commercial live attenuated vaccine to both viruses plus Chlamydophila felis, Felocell CVR-C (Pfizer Animal Health, USA) was used as a control in standardizing the PCR reactions and as a positive control in all of the tests. the swabs were kept in microtubes with MEM medium (0.5 ml) and stored at - 70\u00b0C until use in experiments. the swabs were briefly agitated in a vortex and the content was then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 10.000 x g for 5 min. the supernatants were inoculated onto CRFK cell monolayers grown in 24-well plates. the cDNA was synthesized in 20 l of total solution containing 2 l of RNA. the solution was incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min, 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 50 min and 85\u00b0C for 5 min. the cDNA was used as a template for the PCR for FCV identification. thymidine kinase enzyme gene was the region of the viral DNA amplified by PCR. the primer set used in the reaction was previously developed (28), and the product size is 287 bp. PCR conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s. in two cases and one case were the swabs collected from the oral and oropharyngeal cavities, respectively. the feline population consisted of household cats living alone, household cats living with other cats, breeding cattery cats, hospital cats, cats in veterinary clinics and cats kept isolated for experimental research. the data were organized according to animal age, gender, vaccination status, habitat, presence or absence of clinical signs. 50.5) 32 (11.1) 257 (88.9) nasal 280 (49) 38 (13.6) 242 (86.4) oral 2 (0.3) 2 (100) 0 (0) oropharyngeal 1 (0.2) 1 (100) 0 (0) FCV alone was isolated in 52.7% (29/55) of the cats that tested positively, FHV-1 alone in 38.2% (21/55) and double infection was detected in 9.1% (5/55). ocular discharge in 16/25 (64%); nasal discharge in 7/25 (28%); conjunctivitis, sneezing, coughing, dyspnea, fever and anorexia in 6/25 (24%); oral lesions (ulcer) in 3/25 (12%). only 1 of the 25 cats only showed oral ulcers without other signs of respiratory disease. the 55 cats that tested positive for viral isolation came from 28 different locations. FCV alone was isolated from 17 (60.7%), FHV-1 alone from 7 (25%), and both viruses in four out of the 28 places (14.3%). the cats from the breeding catteries were found to be only positive for FHV-1. FCV alone was isolated in 52.7% (29/55) of the cats that tested positively, FHV-1 alone in 38.2% (21/55) and double infection was detected in 9.1% (5/55). Virus isolation was confirmed in all cases by PCR and RT-PCR. ocular discharge in 16/25 (64%); nasal discharge in 7/25 (28%); conjunctivitis, sneezing, coughing, dyspnea, fever and anorexia in 6/25 (24%); and oral lesions (ulcer) in 3/25 (12%). only 1 of the 25 cats only showed oral ulcers without other signs of respiratory disease. the cats from the breeding catteries were found to be only positive for FHV-1. there were six positive cats in each of two catteries and two cats from another breeding cattery. both viruses were detected in the samples coming from cats obtained from these two locations. in this study, FCV, FHV-1 or both were isolated from 55 cats with or without clinical signs from a total of 302 animals sampled in some cities of the Rio Grande do Sul State in the southern part of Brazil. in the present article, FCV was isolated more often, in terms of the overall results, but its frequency was different when the groups were analysed separately. a greater prevalence of FCV in comparison to FHV-1 has been reported in cats with clinical manifestations of disease. in this article, the number of vaccinated cats excreting FHV-1 was higher than that excreting FCV (Table 2). however, there was a unique situation in this study that could cause such results. most of the isolated FHV-1 came from breeding catteries where an outbreak of respiratory disease was occurring. cases of disease in cats from which neither virus was isolated could have other etiologic causes. an average age of 38 months for cats was demonstrated positive for FCV. an average age of 38 months for cats was demonstrated positive for FCV. cats are more exposed to infectious diseases that are transmitted by contact than the general population analyzed in the USA and European countries. one point of particular concern is the detection of cats without clinical signs that excrete the viruses. this occurred even among animals that were vaccinated."}
