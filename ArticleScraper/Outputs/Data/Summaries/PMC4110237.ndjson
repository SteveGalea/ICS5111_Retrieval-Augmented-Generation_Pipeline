{"summary": "a total of 941 new born piglets in 86 litters were evaluated for five consecutive days. NNPDS is a newly emerged syndrome, characterized by diarrhoea within the first week of life. the aetiology behind the syndrome is unknown, and specific risk factors predisposing piglets to develop NNPDS remain to be determined. neonatal diarrhoea is a well-known disease complex in modern swine production influenced by individual, maternal and environmental factors. the aetiology in specific herd-cases may differ and is often incompletely diagnosed. 80% of swine practitioners report to experience these problems. insufficient prenatal nutrition or inadequate colostrum supplies are well-known risk factors for neonatal diarrhoea. veterinary practitioners do not seem to associate the mastitis-metritis-agalactiae syndrome (MMA) with NNPDS. all herds had experienced problems with neonatal diarrhoea for at least one year. none of the herd-owners were able to point out changes in management. the herd is declared free from all SPF diseases except A. pleuropneumoniae type 12. a total of 941 piglets (227, 245, 216 and 253 from Herds 1, 2, 3 and 4) were included in the analyses. despite the general rule of no antibiotic treatment prior to day 3, in Herd 4, a total of 13 piglets were treated with streptocillin on the second day of life due to arthritis. clinical findings in piglets on the first day of life Hollow flanks, rough hair coats, perineal staining and liquid consistency of faeces were relatively prevalent findings. mature sows in Herds 2 and 3 had smaller litter sizes than mature sows in Herds 2 and 4 (mean size approximately 18 piglets vs. 20 piglets) the majority of the sows did not have any obvious health problems. first parity sows in Herd 4 were very often treated compared to the remaining sows in the study. staff-persons indication to treat was mastitis. in total, 198 (60%) first parity piglets and 221 (36%) of piglets born by mature sows were diarrhoeic at some point between day 2 and five. in total, 198 (60%) first parity piglets and

included in the analyses. piglets in herd 2 were lighter than first parity piglets in other herds. piglets in this herd had the highest prevalence of hollow flanks, rough hair coats, perineal staining and liquid consistency of faeces. mature sows in Herds 2 and 3 had smaller litter sizes than mature sows in Herd 1 and 4 (mean size approximately 18 piglets vs. 20 piglets) the majority of the sows

life were not included in these data. herd of origin was the most important factor associated with the development of NNPDS, with an ORPA of 12.8 in piglets from Herd 1 compared to piglets from Herd 4. parity also an important risk factor with an ORPA of 4.1 in first parity piglets compared to mature parity piglets. random litter effects differed a lot between herds (ICC between 1% (Herd 3) and 39% (Herd1)) birth weight and faecal consistency day one had similar effects in all herds. however, the effects were only statistically significant within Herd 4 and Herd 2, respectively. the inclusion of herds for this study was based upon a high prevalence of unexplained neonatal diarrhoea prior to investigation. the low prevalence of diarrhoea during the study-period in Herd 4 suggested that this herd was in fact in remission at the point of the study. the study intended to describe the epidemiological pattern of NNPDS in terms of prevalence, timing, duration and tendency to cluster within litters. but important limitations of the study that are relevant in the interpretation of its results need to be mentioned. the definition on NNPDS used in the study was made on practical grounds. the lack of association between sow disease and NNPDS is interesting. sows were only examined on the day of parturition and may have developed clinical symptoms later that were not taken into account. clinical signs of failure to thrive in piglets at day one were very infrequent. piglets (20-50% of piglets within herds) experienced the first symptoms of NNPDS on day one. the study did (weakly) associate liquid faeces day one with the development of NNPDS. but future studies should not rule out that NNPDS sometimes starts on the day of birth. the study did not evaluate factors associated with the high prolificacy of Danish genetics (such as longer duration of farrowing) or herd-factors associated with NNPDS. further studies are needed to look into these aspects. piglets were characterized by flaccidity of intestines with no mucosal lesions and milk-filled stomachs. piglets were characterized by flaccidity of intestines with no mucosal lesions and milk-filled stomachs. approximately 20 sows (6\u20138 per day) from one farrowing batch were selected on the day of parturition. litters were standardized to 11 (Herd 1 and Herd 3) or 12 piglets (Herd 2 and Herd 4). smaller piglets were excluded, since they were not expected to survive among large litter-mates. all sows were clinically examined between 5 and 20 hours postpartum. the clinical examination included assessment of udder, legs and vulva. the presence of hollow flanks, protruding ribs, rough hair coats, dehydration. >18 piglets Small Gilts: 16 piglets, 19 piglets Stillborn Many 0-1 piglets

conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Danish Ministry of Justice. this type of study does not require ethical approval. selection of herds Four well-managed conventional herds were selected based on these criteria: 1) Persistent problems with diarrhoea during the first week of life. coli, Clostridium perfringens type C, rotavirus A, coronavirus and Cystoisospora suis could explain the aetiology of diarrhoea. previous studies suggested neither Clostridium perfringens type A, Clostridium difficile, Strongyloides ransomi, Giardia spp nor Cryptosporidium spp were involved in the diarrhoeal outbreaks litters were standardized to 11 (Herd 1 and Herd 3) or 12 piglets (Herd 2 and Herd 4). smaller piglets were excluded, since they were not expected to survive among large litter-mates. piglets were kept in their original litters during the whole study period. the presence of hollow flanks, protruding ribs, rough hair coats, dehydration, skin-abrasions on fore-knees and faecal staining of perineum was dichotomously recorded. the presence of hollow flanks, protruding ribs, rough hair coats, dehydration (lack of skin-elasticity and sunken eye-balls) was also recorded.
