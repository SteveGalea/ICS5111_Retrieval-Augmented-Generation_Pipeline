{"summary": "allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) is a potentially curative therapy for a variety of hematologic diseases. but benefits include graft-versus-tumor (GVHD) activity are limited by graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) Ceacam1 regulates T cell activation, GVHD target organ damage, and numbers of donor T cells in lymphoid organs and GVHD target tissues. targeting Ceacam1 may represent a potent strategy for regulation of GVHD and GVT after allogeneic transplantation. oforms on T cells attenuates experimental colitis [7], [8], [8], and may represent an attempt by the immune system to negatively regulate these inflammatory processes. ceacam1 regulates the tumorigenesis of colon cancers, and is a prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinoma. this report assesses the impact of Ceacam1 on donor T cells and recipient tissues. we used ceacam1 regulation of GHVD on donor T cells or recipients. recipients received split-dose lethal irradiation (BALB/c: 8.5 Gy, B10.BR: 11 Gy) and a graft of 5106 allogeneic T cell depleted bone marrow (TCD-BM) Ceacam1 regulates GVHD mortality. LEFT: 5106 TCD-BM 1106 TBALB/c. N = 10/group. Representative data from one of three experiments. square: BM only. Triangle: WT recipients, BM+T. Circle: Ceacam1/ recipients, BM+T. mice succumb within the first week of GVHD target organ damage. ceacam1 regulates GVHD target organ damage. recipients of ceacam1-Tg T cells showed significantly less GVHD of the liver, intestines, and thymus compared to recipients of WT T cells. this appears to suggest that ceacam1-Tg T cells caused less GVHD overall, with relatively little organ specificity. ceacam1 regulates donor T cell numbers in GVHD target tissues. 5106 TCD-BM 1106 TBALB/c. day 14. Donor T cells were enumerated. N = 7 group. Combined data from two to four experiments. accelerated early mortality of Ceacam1/ allo-BMT recipients. increased accumulation of donor T cells in GI tract and mesenteric lymph nodes. but decreased numbers peripheral lymph nodes. WT and Ceacam1/ B6 mice were irradiated as a single-dose. N = 3/group, 9 sections per terminal ileum taken. c) 5106 TCD-BM 1106 WT or Ceacam1-Tg TBALB/c. Day 14. N = 6 to 10/group. one of two independent experiments. c) 5106 TCD-BM 1106 TWT or Ceacam1/ BALB/c. Day 14. N = 5 to 8/group. only CFSElo alloactivated T cells expressed low but consistently detectable levels of Ceacam1 during alloactivation. the kinetics are consistent with a role for Ceacam1 in regulating early events in T cell alloactivation. f) 107 CFSE+ B6 or CEACAM1-Tg TBALB/c. percentage of donor CD25 positive CD4 CFSElo cells are shown. N = 10/group. Combined data from four experiments. this is consistent with an inhibitory role for Ceacam1 in the proliferation of alloreactive T cells. however, we did not observe significant differences in alloactivation between Ceacam1-Tg vs. WT donor T cells. we transferred CFSE-labeled B6 T cells into irradiated WT vs. Ceacam1/ BALB/c mice, and analyzed donor T cells in spleens on day 3. deficient donor T: Transgenic donor T: Survival Complete blood count = = = Engraftment/chimerism = = = Serum TNF, IFN, IL-2, IL-12 = = = = Donor T cells Activation/Proliferation T-bet, FoxP3, IFN = = = Trafficking molecules = Cytotoxicity = n/a n/a Numbers in Spleen = = MLN/intestine PLN Splenic donor DCs percentage, a recipients of ceacam1/ donor T cells had improved survival in the A20 lymphoma model. but both T cell replete groups showed comparable survival in the RENCA solid tumor model. recipients received split-dose lethal irradiation (BALB/c: 8.5 Gy, B10.BR: 11 Gy) and a graft of 5106 allogeneic T cell depleted bone marrow (TCD-BM) of wildtype (WT) origin. we confirmed this in second MHC-disparate allo-BMT model, BALB/cB10.BR. Combined N = 55 in groups receiving T cells from six experiments. diamond: ceacam1/ recipients, BM only. square: WT recipients, BM+T. Triangle: WT recipients, BM+T. cells suggest that Ceacam1 regulates GVHD target organ damage. cells showed significantly less GVHD of the liver, intestines, and thymus compared to recipients of WT T cells. Ceacam1 regulates donor T cell numbers in lymphoid tissues and target organs during GVHD. in correspondence with increased early GVHD mortality, ceacam1/ allo-BMT recipients showed increased large bowel damage and thymic GVHD. donors of allografts containing WT vs. Ceacam1-Tg T cells were enumerated. N = 7\u201318 group. Combined data from two to four experiments. we then enumerated regenerating and surviving crypts in the small intestine (terminal ileum) at 84 hours after irradiation to assess intestinal radiation damage. we observed that ceacam1/ mice had fewer regenerating and surviving crypts as compared with WT counterparts. this indicates greater damage to the small intestine across a wide range of radiation doses. we analyzed donor donor WT and Ceacam1/ alloactivated splenic T cells on day 14 after allo-BMT for trafficking molecules. found that ceacam1/ CD8+ CD44+CD62L effector T cells expressed higher levels of integrin 7 subunit and the gut homing integrin 47. however, WT vs. Ceacam1/ CD4 effector T cells had similar integrin 7 subunit expression, yet also accumulated in greater numbers vs. Ceacam1-Tg T cell allografts, we found no significant differences in levels of 7 subunit, integrin 47, or any other molecules. this is consistent with the systemic reduction in GVHD in recipients of identical donor allografts. we also assessed trafficking molecules in irradiated WT vs. Ceacam1/ recipients of identical donor allografts. spleens analyzed day 2. Donor CD4 and CD8 T cells were analyzed by number of divisions viaCFSE dilution. p0.05 for MFI difference vs. non-dividing cells. eactive T cells or radio-resistant cells in allo-BMT recipients could regulate this process. we transferred CFSE-labeled purified B6 WT or Ceacam1/ splenic T cells into irradiated BALB/c mice and analyzed donor T cells in spleens on day 3. this is consistent with an inhibitory role for Ceacam1 in the proliferation of alloreactive T cells. ceacam1 does not significantly influence T cell polarization, cytolysis or dendritic cell function in GVHD. we measured serum cytokines in recipients of WT, Ceacam1-Tg and Ceacam1/ T cells on days 7 and 14 post-transplant. levels of IFN, TNF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12p70 were similar. we assessed the cytolytic function of WT vs. Ceacam1/ alloactivated CD8 T cells from the spleens of allo-BMT recipients on day 14. we found no differences in DC numbers, activation state (CD80, CD86, MHC class II) from the infusion of Ceacam1/ or Ceacam1-Tg T cells. 106 B6 BM0.1106 RENCA0.8106 B6 WT or Ceacam1/ T cellsBALB/c (8.5 Gy) N = 9 for groups receiving T cells. a20 lymphoma cells and RENCA tumor cells in culture were stained for Ceacam1 expression. in both lymphoid tissues and GVHD target tissues, we also assessed the role of Ceacam1 in allo-BMT recipients. both showed increased activation, selective damage to the large intestines, and preferential accumulation in the MLN and intestinal parenchyma of mice with GVHD. this suggests that Ceacam1 \u201cfraternal\u201d interactions between cells of the donor graft were not sufficient to restrain GVHD in recipients with GVHD. loss of Ceacam1 regulates cell-cell adhesion [17], [18], [44], [45] under normal and pathological conditions. loss of Ceacam1 regulates radiation-induced sloughing of intestinal epithelium. splenic donor CD8 alloactivated T cells express higher levels of 47. despite similar integrin 47 expression, ceacam1 regulates the accumulation of donor T cells in target tissues via multiple mechanisms. we noted differences on donor lymphocyte infiltrates into GVHD target tissues and secondary lymphoid tissues. differences may explain why activation and trafficking phenotypes are not directly opposed. a number of hematologic tumors, including EL4 leukemia, P815 mastocytoma, and C1498 myeloid leukemia all express substantial levels of Ceacam1. some solid tumors, such as mouse 4T1 breast epithelial cancer and CT51 colon tumor normally express only lower or even minimal levels of Ceacam1. RENCA in our GVT model systems is found primarily in the liver, and to a lesser extent, the lungs mice used were between 8 and 12 weeks old. splenic T cells were resuspended in DMEM and injected into lethally irradiated recipients on day 0. histopathologic analysis Small and large bowel, liver, and skin were assessed by experts in a blinded fashion. skin was evaluated for number of apoptotic cells/mm2 of epidermis via terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) splenic T cells were resuspended in DMEM and injected into lethally irradiated recipients on day 0 after total body irradiation. cells were incubated with CFSE (5107 cells/mL) at 37\u00b0C for 20 minutes, washed twice with PBS and infused intravenously into lethally irradiated recipients. mm2 of epidermis via terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis Histopathologic scores, median fluorescence intensities and cell counts were compared between groups using the nonparametric unpaired Mann-Whitney U test. mice showed increased thymic and splenic cellularity compared with wildtype animals. ceacam1-Tg transgenic mice exhibit similar numbers of splenocytes, thymocytes and bone marrow cells compared with WT animals."}
