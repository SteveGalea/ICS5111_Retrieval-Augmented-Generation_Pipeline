{"summary": "cleft lip and/or palate require palatal expansion to develop normal speech and fully functional occlusion. the expanded palate has a strong tendency to rebound to its original shape due to the patient\u2019s congenital lack of bone and diminished capability of bone regeneration in the cleft site. pyruvate carboxylase (LlPC) has a distinct binding mode in LlPC compared with that in Listeria monocytogenes PC. c-di-AMP inhibition can abolish c-di-AMP inhibition. the aspartate pool in L. lactis is negatively regulated by c-di-AMP. 3D-carbene chip-based surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) technology will have wide appeal in profiling and discovering biological recognitions in and beyond epigenetics. we envision that the 3D-carbene SPRi technology described here will have wide appeal in profiling and discovering biological recognitions. we propose a motif for PTM crosstalk between two of the most common PTMs: phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation. we highlight specific residues that, when phosphorylated, hamper O-GlcNAcylation at nearby sites. we show that reciprocal PTM crosstalk does not occur with Pro-directed kinases. genematical model reveals role of nucleotide signaling in airway surface liquid homeostasis. in healthy lungs, a well-hydrated mucus layer is cleared by cilia from airway surfaces. in cystic fibrosis, airway surfaces are dehydrated, leading to a failure of cilia-mediated mucus clearance and accumulation of pathogen-infected mucus. based on the optimal methodology, we present a hypothesis of mammalian divergence timing that is more consistent with the fossil record than previous molecular clock reconstructions. feedback amplification loop drives malignant growth in epithelial tissues Mariana Muzzopappa, Lada Murcia, and Marco Mil\u00e1n. the poor prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has not improved for several decades because of drug resistance to current anticancer drugs. many molecularly targeted agents are effective for EOC, likely because EOC has high tumor heterogeneity. we focus on V9V2 T cells, a major subset of human gamma delta T cells in blood and investigate the phosphoantigen-induced, MHC-independent molecular mechanisms governing their activation. in this paper, we focus on the phosphoantigen-induced, MHC-independent molecular mechanisms governing their activation. we hypothesized that type-I IFN-inducible transcription factors might play a role in tumor immunity. this study shows that Batf2 has an antitumor effect through the up-regulation of IL-12 p40 in tumor-associated macrophages. 5% of cases have de novo damaging mutations in negative regulators of the Wnt, BMP, and Ras/ERK signaling pathways. cascades converge on common nuclear targets to promote bone formation. another 5% have transmitted mutations in these pathways. the results provide insight into pathophysiology and have immediate implications. KCNE1 and KCNE3 modulate KCNQ1 channels by affecting different gating transitions. KCNE1 and KCNE3 -subunits turn voltage-dependent KCNQ1 channels into delayed activating KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels and apparent voltage-independent KCNQ1/KCNE3 channels. KCNE1 and KCNE3 are potential drug targets. the chromatin regulators ASI1 and EDM2 function in regulating alternative polyadenylation at genes with intronic heterochromatin. we found that ASI1 and EDM2 are associated in planta through interactions with a putative RNA-binding protein, AIPP1. pathogen recognition first occurs at the plasma membrane, where receptor-like kinases perceive pathogen-derived molecules and initiate immune responses. plants evolved intracellular receptors, known as NOD-like receptors (NLRs), to detect effectors, thereby ensuring activation of effector-triggered immunity. this could provide strategies for crop improvement, contributing to effective, environmentally friendly solutions for future agriculture."}
