{"summary": "despite the advent of drugs, protocols, and vaccines available to treat the flu, we remain dangerously vulnerable. despite the advent of drugs, protocols, and vaccines available to treat the flu, we remain dangerously vulnerable. this flu season has been among the worst in recent history. quarantine and isolation are two of the oldest methods of disease containment in the world. the success of NPIs depends not just on implementation, but on the biology and natural history of the pathogen in question. quarantine is often implemented as an overly broad, reactionary measure of limited effect, untethered to evidence-based, scientific approach to the biological and epidemiological profile of a disease. in 2014, when the Ebola virus spread rapidly throughout West Africa and ultimately to the united states, many states responded by quickly instituting quarantine policies seemingly without regard to the scientific evidence of how Ebola spread. despite inconsistent temperature readings, Hickox was involuntarily quarantined outside of the building for approximately 80 hours in the now infamous isolation tent with a portable toilet. she was immediately subject to a Maine public health order that directed her to engage in direct active monitoring and substantially restricted her movements until the 21-day incubation period for Ebola had passed. ox settled her lawsuit, dismissing her complaint. the settlement also requires new jersey to provide notice of all hearings. the CDC in 2017 revised its Rule for the Control of Communicable Diseases: Interstate and foreign. the CDC criticized new jersey\u2019s strict quarantine policy in 2014. the proposed rule has now set the bar so low for apprehending or quarantining individuals that Hickox\u2019s situation could easily occur again under the CDC\u2019s own guidance. the CDC reiterated in its final rule that it references diseases \u2018likely to cause a public health emergency\u2019. public health emergency community\u2019s approach to pandemics still follows a cycle of panic\u2013neglect\u2013panic\u2013neglect. if we were to once again have a severe, nationwide pandemic such as the Spanish flu, our public health system would be ill prepared."}
