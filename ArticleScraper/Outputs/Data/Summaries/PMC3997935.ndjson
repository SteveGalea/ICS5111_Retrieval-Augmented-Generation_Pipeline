{"summary": "methods to quantify the reproductive number by age group are limited. we introduce a simple method to estimate the reproductive number by modifying the method originally proposed by Wallinga and Teunis. we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the potential impact of differential healthcare seeking patterns by age. matrices have been used in modeling exercises to better understand the dynamics of disease spread by age. one strategy is to target those who potentially carry the greatest burden of disease. this can also be seen as a surrogate measure for the age group that is driving an outbreak. a later study, Glass et al. [3] used serosurvey data and estimate R0 from the final size of the epidemic to be 1.6 for kids and less than 1 for adults. in the present study, we present a new approach to estimating the reproductive number by age group by modifying a method initially proposed by Wallinga and Tuenis [20] Gauteng province is the most populous, yet smallest geographically, of the nine provinces in south africa. n = 5579, 44% of cases) to avoid confounding the results with potential spatial variation in transmission. a j is a measure of the likelihood of transmission between individuals in age group ai and aj. the matrix W = w a i a j does not necessarily have to be symmetric. this method requires information on the likelihood of infectious contact between different age groups. the reproductive numbers for each age group represent the expected number of infections generated across the population by an individual in that particular age group. first we test the sensitivity of the results to potential errors in the reporting dates by selecting a single imputed dataset and randomly jittering the onset dates of 10% of the individuals within 30 days of their observed (or imputed) onset date. second sensitivity analysis tests the impact of differential healthcare seeking behaviors by age. we only use data from Gauteng province (n = 5579, 44% of cases) to avoid confounding the results with potential spatial variation in transmission. Gauteng province is the most populous, yet smallest geographically, of the nine provinces in south Africa. ages by modifying the probability of transmission to be: P t j' t i = p t i t j'w a i'a j. matrix W = w a i a j does not necessarily have to be symmetric. this method requires information on the likelihood of infectious contact between different age groups. we report results from the polyMod matrices as a sensitivity analysis. we estimate Rt and R0 using the 18 matrices described above. reproductive numbers represent the expected number of infections generated across the population by an individual in that particular age group. the R t estimates are similar regardless of the type of contact matrix assumed. those over 45 initially have fairly high estimates of R t but these taper off quickly. estimates of R t are not obtainable for those between 5 and 9 and those less than 5 until the outbreak is well under way. estimates of R 0 obtained by using the transmission matrices based on South African contact patterns Age group N (%) R 0, close contacts R 0, all physical contacts 0-4 484 (8.73) 0.94 (0.91-0.97) 0.74 (0.72-0.76) 5-9 927 (16.72) 1.20 (1.17-1.24) 1.29 (1.25-1.33) 10-14 1150 (20.75) 1.53 (1.49-1.58) 1.47 (1.44-1.51) 15-19 1026 (18 each of the eight countries in the study provide the overall estimate of R0 collapsed over all age groups. for comparison purposes, we first estimate R0 by using a traditional analysis that assumes homogenous mixing among the age groups ( R 0 =1.28, range: 1.26-1.31) mputation variability reported, provide insight on the overall variability of the estimates reported. we assume a greater underreporting of cases among those who are middle aged, we estimate the bulk of transmission being attributable to those who are older and less transmission being attributed to the very young, a finding contrary to the original results we present. polymod study appears to corroborate previous results for influenza pandemics. we estimate that R 0 is highest for 10\u201314 year olds when using contact trace matrices. this is similar to those obtained using the european based contact matrices. we implicitly assume that contact patterns are directly related to transmission probabilities, an assumption that has yet to be rigorously tested. our work relies on the contact patterns of healthy individuals. this is important to note the caveats and limitations of this study. further investigation into potential reporting inconsistencies is important to better understand infectious disease dynamics by age similar to what was previously done but not incorporating age. additional reporting inconsistencies are possible spatially or across other socio-economic factors. it is possible that reporting would not be as dramatically variable as it would be if we made use of data from the entire country. studies show children are much more likely to become ill and transmit disease than adults during a pandemic. these methods can be used to estimate heterogeneity in transmission parameters in real time by using the modification proposed by Cauchemez et al. q t i, t j ', q t i, t j'= P t j' t i s = 1 min k, ti 1 l = 1 n s P s l t i = P t j' t i s = 1 min k, ti 1 l = 1 n s P s l t i = P t j' serial interval of length i and maximum serial interval length is k. ti denotes the ith individual with symptom onset on day t. the probability of transmission occurring between two individuals in the network is determined by the serial interval. the effective reproductive number for individual tj\u2032is R t j'= s = t'+ 1 min T, t'+ k i = 1 n s q s i, t j'= s = t'+ 1 min T, t'+ k n s q s, t j ', where ns denotes the number with symptom onset on day s. d datasets and augment each dataset using the distribution f (x) where f (x) is a function of the original age distribution observed in the data, g (x), and the reporting distribution shown in Additional file 3: Figure S1, h (x), as follows: f x = g x + 1 h x. results for all 25 datasets are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2. authors\u2019 contributions LFW and MP conceived the project and developed the methods.
