{"summary": "pyogranulomatous dermatitis with intralesional macrophages laden with feline coronavirus (FCoV) antigen. real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of a cutaneous sample revealed a single nucleotide substitution in the spike protein gene of FCoV. the cat was lost to follow-up 5 months after discharge. a feline case in which a nucleotide mutation in the FCoV spike gene was identified by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in a coronavirus-associated cutaneous nodule. the mutation was consistent with previous FCoV mutations commonly associated with FIP. the cat had a history of sneezing and nasal discharge from 3 months of age. the cat had received vaccinations against feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline parvovirus three times each. the cat also had a history of serous nasal discharge from both nostrils. abdominal palpation did not reveal hepatomegaly or enlarged intraperitoneal lymph nodes. no apparent abnormality on auscultation was observed. the cat did not appear to experience pain upon palpation. the punctate and aggregate reticulocyte frequencies were 1.8% (RI 1.4\u201310.8%) and 0.5% (RI 0.1\u20130.4%), respectively, suggesting non-regenerative anaemia. blood chemistry revealed hyperproteinaemia (11.0 g/dl [RI 5.4\u20137.8 g/dl]), hyperglobulinaemia (8.5 g/dl [RI 2.6\u20135.1 g/dl]); a low albumin/globulin ratio (0.29 a complete ophthalmic examination revealed no abnormalities in the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, uvea or lens. the serum antibody titre against FCoV was 1:6400 (RI 1:800; IDEXX Laboratories) serological analyses to detect feline leukaemia virus p27 or anti-feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies were negative. culture results were negative for any bacteria, including acid-fast bacilli. no liver biopsy was performed because the owner declined. the cat left the hospital at the request of the owner. a telephone interview with the owner 5 months after discharge revealed that the cat was still alive. the cat was lost to follow-up afterwards. hepatic nodules suggest that the cat in this case had FIP with abdominal involvement. however, we did not perform molecular analysis to identify FCoV in the hepatic lesions. these mutations are thought to allow FCoVs to acquire macrophage tropism. this is the first case report of cutaneous FIP in which the FCoV was genotyped and a gene mutation commonly associated with FIP was identified."}
