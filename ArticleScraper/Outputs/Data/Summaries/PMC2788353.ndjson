{"summary": "signal peptides (SPs) are short regions that guide the targeting of secretory proteins to the correct subcellular compartments in the cell. they are cleaved off upon the passenger protein reaching its destination. signal peptides are cleaved off from their passenger protein by the endoprotease SPase I. an important annotation task involves the identification of these SPs and the correct identification of their cleavage sites. the staggering rate at which unprocessed sequences are being deposited into the sequence databases easily outpaces the results from experimental methods. this has catalyzed the development of faster and more accurate computational methods to automate the task of SP prediction. methodology and three datasets covered: eukaryotes (Euk), Gram-positive (Gpos) and Gram-negative (Gneg) Earlier reviews have focused on comparisons of the machine learning techniques used, rather than evaluating the results of these methods. results To benchmark the 13 SP prediction tools, we employ our previously developed pipeline [33] to generate 2 datasets that are further curated. each dataset is maintained in equal number between the positive and negative instances to ensure that there is no bias in the assessment of the tools. Experiment #1: Zhang and Henzel [20] (Experimentally verified SPs) Dataset for Experiment #3: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Release 57.0 (excludes datasets used in Experiment #1 and #2) Positive 270 human secreted recombinant proteins 2,349 secretory proteins consisting of: 228 secretory proteins consisting of: - Euk: 1874 - Euk: 199 - Gpos: the datasets are derived from SPdb 5.1 [33] and subjected to manual curation. the datasets are divided into Euk (top chart), Gpos (bottom chart) and Gneg (middle chart) bacteria. 74 0.862 0.742 RPSP 0.730 0.989 0.859 0.744 0.805 0.996 0.901 0.816 0.794 1.000 0.897 0.811 SigCleave 0.541 0.878 0.709 0.445 0.613 0.823 0.718 0.446 0.618 0.860 0.738 0.493 SigHMM1 0.707 0.937 0.822 0.662 0.562 0.561 0.9 signal-BLAST predicts the highest number of correct positive instances (i.e. best sensitivity) (0.978) this is dramatically reversed when it scores 0.815 in specificity upon tested. the results are lower than those reported in the authors' publications using the same dataset. the authors reported the cleavage site as 28aa instead of the correct 29aa. signal-CF and Signal-3L identified the cleavage site at 63aa and 28aa respectively. a markedly different length of SP is reported. OPUS was developed as a combined predictor for SPs and membrane protein topology. other methods namely Philius, Phobius, PrediSi, SigHMM, RPSP and Signal-3L return accuracies that are above 0.800 or 80%. but closer examination reveals that although their specificities are impressive, their sensitivities are modest, mostly in the range of 0.630 to 0.790. results from experiment 3 New sequences (details available from Table 1) have been extracted from the Swiss-Prot database release 57.0 (totaling 412,525 entries) resulting in a dataset of 228 positive and 228 negative instances. this dataset represents a fresh challenge for majority of the tools except for Signal-BLAST which has been updated recently with Swiss-Prot Release 56.6. results from experiment 1 The first experiment uses 270 eukaryotic (human) sequences with experimentally verified SPs. Signal-BLAST predicts the highest number of correct positive instances (i.e. best sensitivity) (0.978) this is dramatically reversed when it scores 0.815 in specificity upon tested. signal-CF and Signal-3L identified the cleavage site at 63aa and 28aa respectively. based on the input sequence of length 70aa. signal-CF, on the other hand, is extremely sensitive to the different lengths. results from experiment 2 The second experiment recruits a much larger dataset consisting of 4,704 sequences that are spilt into positive and negative datasets of equal size. the negative set consists of a mix of Euk cytoplasmic and nuclear sequences. results from experiment 3 have been extracted from the Swiss-Prot database release 57.0 (totaling 412,525 entries) resulting in a dataset of 228 positive and 228 negative instances. this dataset represents a fresh challenge for majority of the tools except for Signal-BLAST. the results are presented in Table 2 and Figure 4. most tools achieve better results for the eukaryotic datasets compared to the bacterial datasets. most tools encounter little difficulty distinguishing between secretory and non-secretory proteins. this is evident from the high specificity achieved even with the new dataset. thirteen of the most commonly used prediction tools are available for testing using identical test datasets, covering eukaryotic sequences and combinations of eukaryotic and bacterial sequences. most of these tools are able to distinguish secretory and non-secretory proteins with little difficulty, although identifying the correct SP cleavage site remains a challenge. the negative dataset is a mix of cytoplasmic and nuclear (applicable to Euk only) proteins. this is matched by an equal number of negative instances for each organism group. the negative dataset is a mix of cytoplasmic and nuclear (applicable to Euk only) proteins. ences with SPs that are shorter/longer than the average in the positive set are not excluded. sequences (both positive and negative) which are present in (ii) are deliberately omitted from this dataset. manual inspection of the preliminary filtered set reveals that many of the entries are putative despite the lack of indication in their annotations. the popular datasets [9,38] are not adopted in this evaluation since they are derived from earlier Swiss-Prot releases. the popular datasets are inclusive of these entries and erroneous entries which were described previously have been manually removed in our datasets. SPEPlip [58] does not support large-scale testing while SIG-Pred [59] was unavailable for this study. we use the web server instead of the standalone version due to the discrepancy in their results. for SigCleave [25], a returned score below -5 is deemed to indicate a non-secretory sequence, otherwise the cleavage site is reported. the detection mode is set to \"SP4 - Only Detect Cleavage Site\" for all other tools not specifically mentioned. Acc computes the fraction of positive and negatives instances predicted correctly. acc returns a value between 1 (perfect prediction) and -1 (inverse prediction) where 0 denotes a random prediction. sequences with cleavable SPs that are predicted with the wrong cleavage sites are designated as true positives (TP) the negative dataset is a mix of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. the negative dataset is a mix of cytoplasmic and nuclear (applicable to Euk only) proteins. single-pass type II membrane proteins that contain signal anchors are skipped. sequences (both positive and negative) which are present in (ii) are deliberately omitted. this would minimize any advantage enjoyed by the tools in predicting SPs from sequences similar to those'seen' before. manual inspection of the preliminary filtered set reveals that many entries are putative despite the lack of indication in their annotations. the popular datasets [9,38] are not adopted in this evaluation since they are derived from earlier Swiss-Prot releases. the popular datasets are inclusive of these entries and erroneous entries which were described previously have been manually removed. we have omitted specialized tools such as SecretomeP which predict non-classical SPs. SPEPlip [58] does not support large-scale testing while SIG-Pred [59] was unavailable for this study. a returned score below -5 is deemed to indicate a non-secretory sequence. for signal-Blast [21], the detection mode is set to \"SP4 - Only Detect Cleavage Site\" all parameters for each tool are maintained the same in all three experiments. sequences which possess cleavable SPs that are predicted with the correct cleavage sites are designated as true positives (TP) whereas predictions specifying an absence of SP are considered as true negatives (TN). Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests. in the negative sets, each entry is formatted as Swiss-Prot IDspace>Cleavage sitespace>First 70 amino acid residues. each worksheet of the 14 worksheets is labelled in the format: X_Y_Z where X is the experiment number (1, 2 or 3); Y ss the organism group (Euk, Gneg or Gpos); Z is the type of dataset [P (positive) or N (negative)]."}
