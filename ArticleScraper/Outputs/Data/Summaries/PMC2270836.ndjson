{"summary": "FIVPle subtype B (9891 bp) from lions in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and FIVPle subtype E (9899 bp) isolated from lions in the Okavango Delta in Botswana resembles FIV genome sequence from puma, pallas cat and domestic cat across 5' LTR, gag, pol, vif, orfA, env, rev and 3'LTR regions. full-length lion lentiviruses are integral to the advancement of comparative genomics of human pathogens. these lentiviruses are related to other lentiviruses known to infect primates, sheep and goats and cattle. humans causing early flu-like symptoms followed by severe weight loss, chronic wasting disease, and increased susceptibility to rare cancers and opportunistic disease. infected lions show a dramatic decline in CD4+ subsets, a reduction of the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and expansion of the CD8+low subset relative to uninfected lions. full-length provirus sequenced from FIVPle subtype B isolated from lions in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. FIVPle subtype E from lions dwelling in the Okavango Delta in botswana exhibit a range in sequence divergence throughout the genome. FIVPle gag encodes three putative structural proteins of matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid. FIVPle rev appears to be encoded by splicing two exons. the first in the leader region of env, the second located near the 3' region adjacent to env. the second located near the 3' region adjacent to env. 362\u2013633 634\u20131983 1875\u20135248 5239\u20135994 5995\u20136231 6269\u20138830 9092\u20139110 9102\u20139462 Gene length (bp) 361 272 1350 3374 756 237 2562 17 361 Translated Protein Size (#aa) 451 1124 252 79 854 FIVFca Subtype C Gene Position 1\u2013354 355\u2013632 633\u20131985 1874\u20135248 lion LTRs are not identical between subtypes B and E, differing by 15% in nucleotide substitutions, comparable to that observed between FIVFca subtypes A, B and C. lion LTRs are not identical between subtypes B and E, differing by 15% in nucleotide substitutions. phylogenetic tree of concatenated combined data of coding genes gag, pol vif, and orfA. all nodes supported by 100% bootstrap proportions in ME, MP and ML analyses. pol (3657 bp) is the most conserved gene across FIV.

FIVOma is found in wild populations of the Eurasian Pallas cat [4], a species that arose during the late Pleistocene. a closer examination of the env gene shows only two shared regions of homology between FIVPle subtypes. the first spans the sites 1\u2013519 of env, containing exon 1 of rev (Table 1). the second region occurs at the terminal 3' region of env (sites 2506\u20132958) with 87% and 71% genetic identity for nucleotides and amino acid, respectively. env of FIVPle subtype B shares more homology with FIVOma. lack of monophyly between FIVPle subtype B and FIVOma is a consequence of recombinant env of FIVPle subtype E. lion FIVPle subtypes B and E had similar numbers of predicted env protein. env protein from both FIVPle strains was compared to other published FIV strains. o acids sites 931\u2013978 (grey) likely contain the RRE element shared by lion. recombination in lentiviruses is not uncommon in the ongoing global HIV pandemic. at least 34 circulating recombinant forms from HIV-1 subtypes have been described in patients world-wide. recombination in the V3-V5 region of env is not yet known. if recombination has occurred recently, it is likely to have been with strain that has not yet been sequenced for the env gene. further investigation into complete genome analyses of FIVPle subtypes A, C, D and F as well as FIV from other seropositive felids will likely provide new insights into the role of recombination in env. VPle env encodes the putative leader, surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) regions of the envelope glycoprotein, essential components for viral binding to and entry into the host cell. FIVPle rev is similar to HIV/FIV rev, and is thought to be critical in viral replication. 355 272 1353 3375 756 237 2571 19 Translated Protein Size (#aa) 451 1125 252 79 857 FIVFca USIL (Subtype B) Gene position 1\u2013361 362\u2013633 634\u20131983 1875\u20135248 5239\u20135994 5995\u20136231 6269\u20138830 9092\u20139110 9102\u20139462 Gene length (bp) 361 272 1350 3374 756 237 25 FIVPco PLV-1695 Subtype B (British Columbia) Gene Position 1\u2013306 307\u2013638 639\u20132024 1886\u20135323 5298\u20136008 5972\u20136310 6283\u20138715 8772\u20138784 8787\u20139092 Gene length (bp) 306 332 1386 3438 711 339 2433 13 305 Translated protein size (# aa) orfA phylogeny does not include FIVPco subtype A due to lack of homology. pol (3657 bp) is the most conserved gene across FIV, albeit exhibiting substantial average pair-wise genetic distances of 60% and 54% for nucleotides.

FIVPle proviral DNA was amplified using long PCR to generate overlapping proviral genome regions of approximately 5 kb (Roche's Expand PCR kit) PCR reactions used 0.2\u20132.0 ug DNA with the following thermocycling conditions. the resultant colonies were grown on LB agar plates with kanamycin and chloramphenicol. a restriction digest with EcoRI was performed to confirm successful cloning. final full-length sequence for each over-lapping long PCR product was obtained using transposon bombing. the genome of lion FIVPle was compared with existing full-length FIV by multiple sequence alignments of each viral gene. alignment for coding regions of FIV used the program REVTRANS ver 1.4 [29] which takes a multiple sequence file, translates that file into amino acid residues, aligns the amino acids. phylogenetic trees based on nucleotide data were obtained using a heuristic search. conditions for the ML analysis included starting trees obtained by neighbor. conditions for the ML analysis included starting trees obtained by neighbor. domestic cat Mya-1 nave feeder cells were prepared for co-culture by cultivation in LBT + IL-2. reconstituted lion PBMCs were then added to mya-1 cells at a volume of 400 ul (4\u20136 105 cells) media was collected biweekly and subjected to microtiter reverse transcriptase assay as follows. Aliquots of 2.5 l of each reaction mixture were spotted onto a nylon filter. unincorporated label washed away with five 10 to 60 minute washes with 0.03 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0, in 0.3 M sodium chloride (SSC) buffer. membrane was then fixed in 100% ethanol. FIVPle Subtype B was isolated from PBMCs from a wild, sero-positive lion (Ple-458, Serengeti National Park) cells were mixed with 10% DMSO with 90% fetal calf serum and viably frozen in nitrogen vapor in aliquots of 106 cells per ml. cells were maintained in equal parts of leibovitz's L-15 media and RPMI 1640 with 20% fetal calf serum with glutamine (2x) and penicillin/streptomycin (1x) fresh media and naive 3201 cells had to be added every 3\u20134 days. after 21 days post infection, fresh media continued to be added to the culture every 3\u20134 days. three over-lapping regions were amplified using the followoing primer pairs. PCR reactions used 0.2\u20132.0 ug DNA with the following thermocycling conditions. biometra T1 thermocyclers were used for all PCR reactions. transposons were randomly inserted into one of the successfully transformed plasmids for each primer combination for each sample. results were used to transform oneShot Chemically Competent E. coli cells and grown on LB agar plates with kanamycin and chloramphenicol. FIVFca subtype C in domestic cat strain C36 accession number AY600517[24]; for FIVFca subtype B, strain usil2489, accession number U11820; for FIVFca [57]; subtype A, strain PPR accession number M36968 and strain Petaluma accession number M25381[15,25,58]. the genome of lion FIVPle was compared with existing full-length FIV by multiple sequence alignment conditions for the ML analysis included starting trees obtained by neighbor. the MP analyses coded gaps as \"missing\" with step-wise addition of taxa and TBR branch swapping. support for nodes within the phylogeny used bootstrap analysis with identical settings. these motifs were identified by the setting a threshold similarity score of 85% for screening against the TRANSFAC database. the primers span the entire proviral genome of subtype E (Ple1027) and subtype B (Ple458)."}
