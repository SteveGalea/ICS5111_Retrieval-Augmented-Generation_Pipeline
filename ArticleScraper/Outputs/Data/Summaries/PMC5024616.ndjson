{"summary": "a better understanding of their ground- and electronic excited states will benefit further molecular design and future applications. a better understanding of their ground- and electronic excited states will benefit further molecular design and future applications. the instability and multireference character have impeded experimental and theoretical studies. crystal structure provides details as to the intermolecular interactions that allow dimerization and the binding to ATP and histones. this work reveals key molecular activities of MORC3 that might apply to other MORC family members in eukaryotic organisms. we propose models for the interaction of medaka and human t/PK with telomerase reverse transcriptase. the transition zone proteome reveals compartmentalization and differential dynamics of ciliopathy complexes. the importance of the TZ is reflected in the many human diseases that are caused by mutations in TZ complexes. heme can be derived exogenously or from de novo synthesis. but it is unclear if there is differential trafficking of heme from these two sources. heme is trafficked to virtually all intracellular compartments via distinct cellular routes. indica rice accounts for >70% of total rice production worldwide. it is genetically highly diverse and can be divided into two major varietal groups independently bred and widely cultivated in china and Southeast Asia. the genomes will serve as a foundation for future genome-based exploration in rice toward basic and applied goals. monocytes patrol the microvascular lumen in numerous organs in behavior thought to represent a form of immune surveillance. however, the mechanisms whereby they promote inflammatory responses are unclear. the mechanisms whereby they promote inflammatory responses are unclear. p53 down-regulates SARS coronavirus replication and is targeted by the SARS-unique domain and PLpro via E3 ubiquitin ligase RCHY1 Yue Ma-Lauer, Javier Carbajo-Lozoya, Marco Y. Hein, wen Deng, Jian Lei, Benjamin Meyer, Yuri Kusov, Brigitte von Brunn, Dev Raj Bairad, Sabine H\u00fcnten, Christian es physically interact with and stabilize E3 ubiquitin ligase ring-finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1), thereby augmenting RCHY1-mediated degradation of p53. p53 is counteracted via the stabilization of RCHY1 by viral SUD and papain-like protease (PLpro) proteins. secreted Hsp70 masks amyloid-42 neurotoxicity in drosophila Pedro Fernandez-Funez, Jonatan Sanchez-Garcia, Lorena de Mena, Yan Zhang, Yona Levites, Swati Khare, Todd E. Golde, and Diego E. Rincon-Limas. esion molecules connect presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes by binding to each other via the synaptic cleft. such code could explain the versatility of synapses and the logic of connectivity between cell types. we used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the expression of cell adhesion molecules and other signaling proteins in defined cell types. rapid osmotic stress-induced intracellular calcium transients provide the opportunity to dissect quantitatively the sensory mechanisms that transmit osmotic stress. mutations in plastidial K+ exchange antiporter (KEA)1/2 and KEA3 transporters were unexpectedly found to reduce the rapid osmotic stress-induced calcium elevation."}
