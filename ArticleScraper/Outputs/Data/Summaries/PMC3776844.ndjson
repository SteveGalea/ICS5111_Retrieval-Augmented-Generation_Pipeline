{"summary": "the membranous web was initially described in U-2 OS cells inducibly expressing the HCV polyprotein [1], indicating that its formation depends on HCV protein expression, even without RNA replication. similar membrane alterations were later observed in Huh-7 cells harboring a subgenomic replicon of genotype 1b [2] and in JFH1-infected Huh-7 cells. two viral proteins, NS4B and NS5A, appear to play a major role in induction of membrane rearrangements [1], [4]\u2013[6]. the membranous web was proposed to be derived from the ER membrane. several endosomal markers were also observed colocalizing with HCV replicases and/or functionally involved in RNA replication. protein Arf1 recruits different effectors, including coat protein complex COP-I. this pathway mediates retrograde transport from the cis-Golgi and the ERGIC to the ER. inhibition by brefeldin A induces the collapse of the Golgi complex. phenotypes can be classified into two phenotypes, one of which results from a mutation in the coding sequence of GBF1. antibodies Mouse anti-E1 MAb A4 [30] was produced in vitro by using a miniPerm apparatus (Heraeus) as recommended by the manufacturer. cyanine 3-conjugated goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-sheep IgG were from invitrogen. cell culture Huh-7-derived cells were grown in the presence of BFA (40 to 100 ng/ml) in the same culture medium. infected cells were cultured in the presence of BFA up to 6 hpi. cells were lysed with 50 ul of 1 Renilla lysis buffer at 24 hpi. the infection was scored by the measure of luciferase activity using a Renilla Luciferase Assay kit. siRNA-treated cells were infected 24 h after trypsinization. extra wells of cells treated with each siRNA were counted to ensure that equal numbers of cells were infected. HCVcc infection was quantified by measuring NS5A expression levels. unsaturated signals were recorded with a LAS3000 imager (Fujifilm) unsaturated signals were quantified with the gel macro of the ImageJ software. an MTS-based viability assay was conducted as recommended by the manufacturer. transfection Huh-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), YFP-tagged inactive mutant (E794K), or BFA-resistant mutant (M832L) GBF1 [38] using the transfection reagent TransIT-LT1 as recommended by the manufacturer (Mirus). antibodies Mouse anti-E1 MAb A4 [30] was produced in vitro by using a MiniPerm apparatus (Heraeus) as recommended by goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-sheep IgG, and cyanine 3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from invitrogen. cell culture Huh-7 cells were grown in the presence of BFA (40 to 100 ng/ml) in the same culture medium. infected cells were lysed with 50 ul of 1 Renilla lysis buffer (Promega) at 24 hpi. the infection was scored by the measure of luciferase activity using a Renilla Luciferase Assay kit. cells were electroporated with HCVcc-Rluc/core or HCVcRluc/GND RNA. siRNA-treated cells were infected 24 h after trypsinization. extra wells of cells treated with each siRNA were counted to ensure that equal numbers of cells were infected. unsaturated signals were quantified with the gel macro of the ImageJ software. an MTS-based viability assay was conducted as recommended by the manufacturer. an MTS-based viability assay was conducted as recommended by the manufacturer. transfection Huh-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), YFP-tagged inactive mutant (E794K), or BFA-resistant mutant (M832L) GBF1 [38] using the transfection reagent TransIT-LT1. most of the cells died in less than a week. the concentration was 0.1 g/ml, even for the R4 cell line. the lowest inhibitory concentration of BFA was 0.1 g/ml. the lowest inhibitory concentration of BFA was 0.1 g/ml. HCV infection was slightly higher in resistant cells of this group than in control Huh-7 cells with the doses of 0.1 and 1 g/ml BFA. only R7 cells appeared slightly more resistant to HCV infection with an EC50 of 0.3 g/ml. in contrast, HCVcc infection was much less susceptible to BFA in R1 and R2 cells. scribed genomic RNA of an HCVcc construct expressing the Renilla luciferase was deleted from a major part of the core coding sequence. a reduction of about 70\u201380% of GBF1 expression induced an inhibition of HCV infection of about 50% in Huh-7 cells. the depletion of BIG1 induced an inhibition of HCV infection of about 50%. the levels of inhibition imposed by GBF1, BIG1 or PI4KIII depletions were very similar in Huh-7, R1 and R2 cells. these results indicate that, despite its resistance to BFA inhibition, HCV infection in R1 and R2 cells still depends on GBF1. for each cell line, NS5A expression is expressed as a percentage of the values obtained for the control siRNA. we therefore tested whether HCV replication in R1 and R2 cells was still dependent on Arf1 function [20], [21]. arf1-depletion resulted in about 50\u201360% inhibition of HCV infection in Huh-7 cells. the actual efficiency of Arf1 depletion is probably underestimated. serum albumin and apolipoprotein E secretion in BFA-resistant cells. cells were seeded in 12-well plates and cultured in the presence of BFA for 24 h. apolipoprotein E secretion was expressed as percentages of HSA secretion. apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a component of VLDL particles that are secreted by Huh-7 cells. apoE was absent from the medium of cells treated by BFA at 0.1 g/ml or higher concentrations. apoE remained secreted from R1 and R2 cells in the presence of up to 1 g/ml of BFA. we only detected the expression of GBF1 isoform 3 in Huh-7 and Huh-7-derived cells. four point mutations were found, as compared to the reference sequence. mutations led to amino-acid substitutions at positions 547, 1396, 1725, and 1833 of the coding sequence of GBF1 isoform 3 (table 2). mutation was absent from GBF1 of Huh-7 and cells of group 2. mutation is a substitution of a thymine by an adenine at position 2788 of the sequence of reference. mutation affects a residue of the sec7 domain, which is the domain interacting with Arf and with BFA. or bars represent the SEM of 3 independent experiments performed in duplicates. we also sequenced the sec7 domains of the two other BFA-sensitive Arf-GEFs (BIG1 and BIG2) and the coding sequences of the 4 human Arfs known to be sensitive to BFA inhibition. a YFP-tagged GBF1 construct containing this mutation was expressed in Huh-7 cells, and the cells were submitted to a BFA challenge. cis-Golgi labeling was scattered in the presence of BFA. the TGN structure was condensed into a perinuclear dot-like structure. the recycling endosomes merged into a large network of tubules. as expected, EEA1, another endosomal marker, was unaffected by the BFA treatment. morphology of the cis-Golgi appeared approximately 40\u201350 times more sensitive to BFA than the secretion of HSA in R1 and R2 cells. the morphology of the cis-Golgi of Huh-7, R1, R2 and MDCK cells appeared approximately 40\u201350 times more sensitive to BFA than the secretion of HSA in R1 and R2 cells. sensitivity of the Golgi morphology of R1 and R2 cells to BFA does not result from increased or reduced expression levels of GBF1 or Arf1. sensitivity of the Golgi morphology of R1 and R2 cells to BFA does not result from increased or reduced expression levels of GBF1 or Arf1. the cis-Golgi complex was transfected with siRNA targeting GBF1, BIG1, BIG2 or both BIG1 and BIG2. the nuclei were stained with DAPI. representative confocal images are presented. cells showed only a partial decrease (25%) of viability at the concentration of 10 g/ml of BFA, with no impact of the lower doses. resistance to BFA was intermediate between those of parental Huh-7 and resistant R1 and R2 cells. illa luciferase in the presence of increasing doses of BFA, and luciferase activity was quantified at 24 hpi. at this time there are no re-infection events. this allows assessing the activity of the drug on the replication step of the HCV life cycle only. luciferase activity was quantified as a measure of HCV infection. results were expressed as percentages of the values obtained with no BFA. luciferase activity was quantified as a measure of HCV infection. a reduction of about 70\u201380% of GBF1 expression induced an inhibition of HCV infection of about 50% in Huh-7 cells. the depletion of BIG1, another BFA-sensitive Arf-GEF not involved in HCV replication, inhibited NS5A expression by about 80% in the same experimental setting. the expression of NS5A, Arf1 and -tubulin is expressed as a percentage of the values obtained for the control siRNA. for each cell line, NS5A expression is expressed as a percentage of the values obtained for the control siRNA. HSA secretion was almost completely blocked by BFA in Huh-7 cells at 0.1 g/ml and higher concentrations. the amounts of human serum albumin (HSA) in the conditioned culture media and in cell lysates were quantified with an ELISA assay. the EC50 was shifted from 0.06 g/ml in Huh-7 cells to 0.09\u20130.11 g/ml in cells of the R3\u2013R7 lines. the main difference with Huh-7 cells was the higher rate of secretion in the presence of 1 and 10 g/ml of BFA. the results confirm the reduction of BFA-induced inhibition of secretion in R1 and R2 cells. the lack of BFA inhibition of secretion in R1 and R2 cells could result from a mutation that reduces the interaction of BFA with its target, the GBF1-Arf\u2022GDP complex. three isoforms of GBF1 have been reported. the same set of mutations was found in Huh-7 cells and in cells from group 2 cells. none of these mutations could account for the moderate resistance to BFA of these cells. results were expressed as percentages of the values obtained with no BFA. Error bars represent the SEM of 3 independent experiments performed in duplicates. we also sequenced the sec7 domains of the two other BFA-sensitive Arf-GEFs (BIG1 and BIG2) and the coding sequences of the 4 human Arfs known to be sensitive to BFA inhibition. the morphology of the Golgi and endosomes BFA treatment is known to alter the morphology of the Golgi and endosomes. we investigated the sensitivity of these organelles to BFA in R1 and R2 cells. this sensitivity was expected, since it does not depend on GBF1 but rather on BIG. the pattern of GM130 labeling was scattered in R1 and R2 cells. sensitivity of the cis-Golgi to Golgicide A (25 M), a specific inhibitor of GBF1 function, was unexpected. a similar sensitivity of the cis-Golgi morphology to Golgicide A was also observed with R1 and R2 cells. the percentages of cells with intact cis-Golgi morphology were plotted against BFA concentrations. for each condition, approximately 100 cells were scored for their cis-Golgi morphology, as either intact or scattered. the depletion of GBF1 induced a dramatic scattering of the GM130 labeling. in contrast, the depletion of BIG1, BIG2 or both BIG1 and BIG2 had no apparent effect on the pattern of GM130 labeling. this indicates that these two BFA-sensitive Arf-GEFs do not regulate the cis-Golgi morphology. the resistance phenotype of the first group of cells (R1 and R2) was correlated with the presence of a point mutation in the sec7 domain of GBF1, which replaces the methionine residue 832 with a leucine. the M832 residue is part of the BFA binding site at the Sec7-Arf interface. the unusual pattern of inhibition of albumin secretion in the presence of increasing doses of BFA again suggests the existence of compensatory mechanisms. this allows the secretory pathway of these cells to be partially functional at concentrations of BFA that are fully inhibitory for Huh-7 cells. the nature of these putative compensatory mechanisms must await further studies. the morphology of the cis-Golgi of MDCK cells is also sensitive to BFA. this suggests that the M832L mutation reduces but does not abolish the binding of BFA to GBF1. the difference of sensitivity of R1/R2 cells and of MDCK cells remains unexplained. the role of GBF1 in HCV replication does not reflect its role as a regulator of the protein secretory pathway. this suggests that compensatory mechanisms exist in these cells that allow HSA to be transported out of the ER in the presence of BFA. but these compensatory mechanisms do not support the replication of HCV. this indicates the existence of a GBF1 function unrelated to Arf1 activation during poliovirus replication. this does not preclude the existence of an additional GBF1 function unrelated to Arf1 activation during HCV replication. rab1b is a GBF1-binding partner, which modulates its function in the secretory pathway of non-infected cells. it is striking that rab1b is a GBF1-binding partner, which modulates its function in the secretory pathway of non-infected cells. MDCK cells were treated for 30 minutes with the indicated concentrations of BFA. the nuclei were stained with DAPI (shown in blue) Representative confocal images are presented."}
