{"summary": "finding novel anti-tumor drugs with high selectivity and few side effects is still the main problem of anti-tumor drug research. many traditional chemotherapeutic drugs exhibit significant efforts on both normal cells and cancer cells. finding anti-tumor agents that target the G-quadruplex structure in nucleic acids is a significant consideration in research. helicases are a class of molecular motor proteins that unwind DNAs or RNAs using the energy produced by the hydrolysis of nucleotide triphosphates (NTP) helicases play essential roles in nucleic acid metabolism by facilitating cellular processes including replication, recombination, DNA repair, and transcription. plex-specific single-chain antibodies (scFv antibody) have been developed using different display processes. scFv antibodies have been used in DNA or RNA G-quadruplex mapping in cells. genome mapping and thorough functional elucidation have been reported. G-quadruplexes structures may form intramolecular G-quadruplex or intermolecular G-quadruplex structures. the structures divide into different conformations, including parallel (PDB: 5I2V [49]), antiparallel (PDB: 2MBJ [50]), hybrid (PDB: 6H1K [51], 5ZEV [52] and 5MBR [53]) conformations. telomeres protect chromosomes from degradation and recombination due to faulty DNA repair signals. telomeres recruit telomerase to compensate for cellular damage. telomeres are located at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. chromosome elongation forms an antiparallel RNA G-quadruplex with rGs. there is more than one quadruplex in the telomeric single-stranded overhand. hnRNPA1 can bind to and dissociate RNA telomere G-quadruplexes. the first reported G-quadruplex in the promoter region is formed in the nuclease hypersensitivity element III1 (NHE III1) of the proto-oncogene c-myc. the first reported G-quadruplex in the promoter region is formed in the nuclease hypersensitivity element III1 (NHE III1) of the proto-oncogene c-myc, and is responsible for most of the transcription regulation of the gene. G-quadruplexes located downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) can inhibit transcription when the formation interferes with the binding of the RNA polymerase II or transcription factors. however, G-quadruplexes locating in the coding chain under this situation can interrupt the transcriptional product at the position, and thus inhibit the transcriptional process. the presence of G-quadruplex structures is associated with CpG island hypomethylation in the human genome. the effect of the G-quadruplex on DNA damage repair is to elicit a DNA damage response by causing the formation of DNA double strand breaks. a single unresolved G-quadruplex structure can persist through multiple mitotic divisions, which might increase the risk of DNA double-strand breaks. a translational protein, eIF4A, can recognize the repeat sequence of CGG in the UTR. quadruplexes in alternative splicing sites might act as cis-elements to regulate post-transcription process. a G-quadruplex ligand, CX-5461, seems to be able to regulate AS in hTERT. chromosomes become shorter and shorter during replication with cell division. telomere DNA exists as a single-stranded overhang and serves as substrate for reverse transcription catalyzed by the telomerase. telomeres recruit telomerase to compensate for cellular damage, which eventually leads to cell senescence and apoptosis. the first reported telomere\u2013G-quadruplex ligand was found in 1997 [90] which can inhibit the elongation of the telomere by the telomerase. the researchers then successfully developed a large number of compounds with potential anti-tumor activities targeting telomere\u2013G-quadruplexes. most of these sequences exist in the gene promoter regions. the formation of G-quadruplexes in these promoter regions hinders the interactions between DNA and its transcription factors, which in turn regulate the transcription. the formation of G-quadruplexes can inhibit the transcription process, but also promote the transcription in some genes [118,119,120]. quadruplexes locating in the coding chain under this situation can interrupt the transcriptional product at the position. these different functions are achieved by different kinds of nucleic acid binding proteins. binding sites of helicase, XPB and XPD overlap the site of G-quadruplex formation in the promoter regions. RNA G-quadruplexes are thought to play a key role in many biological processes, such as transcription and post-transcriptional events. a translational protein, eIF4A, can recognize the repeat sequence of CGG in the UTR, and accelerate the progress of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by unwinding the G-quadruplexes. G-quadruplex formation in the third intron of the TP53 gene promotes the splicing of intron 2 [139,140] the reason why G-quadruplex structure can regulate AS may be that purine splicing regulation sequence influences splicing enhancement by interacting with specific splicing proteins to enhance efficiency. ligands are small molecules that can bind to G-quadruplexes with high affinity. the binding constant (KD) between ligands and G-quadruplexes is lower than 106 molL1. the patterns by which small molecule can bind to G-quadruplexes are stacking with outer G-quartets, groove binding, loop binding, and combined binding. TMPyP4 Telomerase inhibition and shortening the telomere length [157], promoting the formation of both G-quadruplex and i-motif [158], inhibiting oncogene transcription. anti-tumor activity on PC-3 human prostate carcinomas [159], K562 leukemic cells [160], retinoblastoma Y79 and WERI-Rb1 cells [161], and B78-H1 melanoma cells BRACO-19 can bind to the telomeric G-quadruplex via three binding modes. BRACO-19 can uncap 3\u2019 telomere ends [152], inhibit the helicase activity of BLM and WRN proteins on G4 and B-form DNA substrates. BRACO-19 has been further developed as anti-HIV agents. but the very poor permeability of BRACO19 limits its further development. acridine conjugates showed quadruplex affinities in the 1\u20135 nM range. cationic porphyrins were designed and identified as strong G-quadruplex ligands. the most typical example is TMPyP4 [157]. this compound shows high affinity with G-quadruplexes. se2SAP converts the parallel c-myc G-quadruplex into a mixed parallel/antiparallel G-quadruplex with one external lateral loop and two internal propeller loops. introducing positive charges to the aromatic core seems to be an attractive strategy for ligand optimization. strong telomerase inhibition makes it a research hotspot. it inhibits tumor cell proliferation by changing telomere conformation and length. telomestatin showed good cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis in different types of tumor cells. fluoroquinolone antibiotics CX-3543 and CX-5461 CX-3543 (also known as quarfloxin) are the first G-quadruplex interactive agent to enter human clinical trials. it binds to rDNA G-quadruplex DNA and has been shown to selectively disrupt interaction of rDNA G-quadruplexes with the nucleolin protein, thereby inhibiting Pol I transcription. BRACO-19 is in advanced phase I clinical trial for patients with BRCA1/2 deficient tumors. further mechanism study revealed that CX-5461 blocks replication forks and induces ssDNA gaps or breaks. BRACO-19 can bind to the telomeric G-quadruplex via three binding modes. acridine-peptide conjugates and triazole\u2013acridine conjugates were also designed to increase the ability to recognize and discriminate between various DNA quadruplexes. similar acridine derivatives, including bis(quinacridine) macrocycle [174], dibenzophenan-throlines [180,181], mono- and bis-pyrimidinoacridines [182], 4,5-bis(dialkylaminoalkyl)-sub TMPyP4 shows anti-tumor activity in several tumor cells. the binding modes of TMPyP4 with different G-quadruplexes are also well studied. a core-modified expanded porphyrin analogue, Se2SAP, was designed and synthesized. introducing positive charges to the aromatic core is a common strategy for G-quadruplex ligand optimization. introducing N-methylated modification to mimic interactions between cations and the anion central channel is a common strategy for G-quadruplex ligand optimization. both TMPyP4 and Se2SAP possess N-methylated groups. recent in vivo data revealed that telomestatin potently eradicates glioma stem cells (GSC) through telomere disruption and c-Myb inhibition. some analogues of telomestatin, such as HXDV and 6OTD, were synthesized and showed strong inhibition on tumor cells with no effect on either duplex or triplex DNA. fluoroquinolone antibiotics CX-3543 and CX-5461 (also known as quarfloxin) are the first G-quadruplex interactive agent to enter human clinical trials. a cross-linking agent that combines nitrogen mustard chlorambucil with PDS can alkylate G-quadruplex structures and selectively impair growth in cells genetically deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins interacting with G-quadruplexes can be divided into three types according to their effects on G-quadruplexes. nucleolin (NCL) is the most commonly reported protein promoting G-quadruplex formation. a quadruplex-forming oligonucleotide aptamer, AS1411, is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for various cancers. a quadruplex-forming oligonucleotide aptamer, AS1411, is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for various cancers by affecting the activities of certain NCL-containing complexes. the effect of the cellular nucleic-acid-binding protein (CNBP) on ces cerevisiae Mre11 protein (ScMre11p) possesses high binding affinity for G-quadruplex DNA. helicases are motor proteins able to unwind nucleic acids. 95 helicases in human cells have been found since 1976. all SF1 enzymes seem to be type, while SF2 superfamily include both and type. all helicases require a single-stranded tail on either the 3\u2019 or 5\u2019 end, which ensures they can be loaded onto the DNA substrate. all Pif1 helicases contain a conserved Pif1 domain of 300 to 500 amino acids. hPif1 unwinds telomeric DNA:RNA hybrid double strands in the telomere. hPif1 inhibits telomere function in tumor cells via binding to the G-quadruplex structure. the Werner-syndrome-associated helicase (WRN) is a type of ATP-dependent 5 \u2018to 3\u2019 DNA helicase. it facilitates the formation of double-stranded DNA into a single strand. this facilitates the formation of G-quadruplexes and hinders the synthesis of DNA by DNA polymerase. a co-crystal structure of bovine RHAU bound to DNA with a G-quadruplex and a 3\u2019 single-stranded DNA segment shows that the N-terminal RHAU-specific motif folds into a DNA-binding-induced alpha-helix that selectively binds parallel G-quadruplexes. many G-quadruplex structures have high thermal stability compared to double-stranded or single-stranded DNA, thus helicase telomestatin competes with proteins for binding to G-quadruplex DNA. telomestatin-treated cells showed impaired proliferation, apoptosis, and increased DNA damage levels. TMPyP4 shows inhibitory activity on telomerase, and can cause cell arrest in S and G2/M phases [267,268] PIPER, isaindigotone derivative 37, isaindigotone derivative 37, NSC 19630, ML216, and bismuth porphyrin complex. a polyxylene derivative, PIPER, is able to specifically inhibit S.cerevisiae Sgs1p helicase\u2019s unwinding of G-quadruplex structure. Tel11 is an effective G-quadruplex helicase inhibitor of SV40 T-antigen. isaindigotone derivative SYSU-ID-01 was verified as a blocker for NM23-H2\u2013G-quadruplex interaction from screening. compound 37 is well-fitted into the narrow, slightly curved pocket that the dinucleotide possesses, and undergoes hydrogen bonding with residues in the channel of the protein active site. other isaindigotone derivatives developed by the same group were found to bind to both NM23-H2 and the G- a high-throughput screening was performed using 350,000 compounds from the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository library in 2013. the compound MLS000559245 was selected and further modified to ML216 (Figure 5) as a lead compound. a bismuth porphyrin complex exhibits activities against both helicase and duplex-unwinding activities through Bi\u2013S bonds. a quadruplex-forming oligonucleotide aptamer, AS1411, is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for various cancers. a quadruplex-forming oligonucleotide aptamer, AS1411, is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for various cancers. a quadruplex-forming oligonucleotide aptamer, AS1411, is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for various a human nuclease, GQN1 (G quartet nuclease 1) cuts within the single-stranded region formed by stacked G-quartets. the saccharomyces cerevisiae Mre11 protein (ScMre11p) possesses high binding affinity for G-quadruplex DNA over single- or double-stranded DNA. SF1, SF2, and SF6 superfamilies contain both type A and B helicases. Depending on the direction of movement on the DNA, the helicase can also be divided into \u2018 type\u2019 and \u2018 type\u2019. SF1 enzymes seem to be type, while SF2 superfamily include both and type. the Pif1 subfamily is a class of ATP-dependent 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 helicases. all Pif1 helicases contain a conserved Pif1 domain of 300 to 500 amino acids. hPif1 unwinds DNA double strands, DNA:RNA hybrid double strands, and secondary structures to promote gene transcription in the presence of Mg2+. study on the network of mRNAs and miRNAs in BLM-deficient cells has indicated that G-quadruplex motifs are enriched at transcription start sites. more functions and mechanisms are revealed, including in DNA double-strand breaks repair [240], excessive sister chromatid exchange [241], and chromosomal rearrangements [242]. RHAU is a multi-functional helicase that has been implicated in G-quadruplex-mediated transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation. it is essential for heart development, hematopoiesis, and embryogenesis in mice [31,252,253,262]. telomestatin can reduce the expression of telomere-binding protein in HeLa cells. this leads to dissociation of the TRF2 from the telomere and eventually to disorder in telomere functions. it has been proposed that telomestatin compete with proteins for binding to G-quadruplex DNA. helicase (such as BLM and Sgs1p) is trapped by the NMM\u2013G-quadruplex complex without unwinding. a polyxylene derivative, PIPER, is able to specifically inhibit S.cerevisiae Sgs1p helicase\u2019s unwinding of G-quadruplex structure, with no effect for double-stranded DNA. isaindigotone derivative SYSU-ID-01 binds to NM23-H2 protein with little binding affinity to G-quadruplex DNA. compound 37 is well-fitted into the narrow, slightly curved pocket that the dinucleotide possesses, and undergoes hydrogen bonding with residues in the channel of the protein active site. other isaindigotone derivatives developed by the same group were found to bind to both NM23-H2 and the G-qua a small molecule from the National Cancer Institute Diversity Set, designated NSC 19630 (Figure 5), was identified, which inhibited WRN helicase activity but did not affect other DNA helicases. exposure of human cells to NSC 19630 dramatically impaired growth and proliferation, induced apoptosis in a WRN-dependent manner, resulted in elevated -H2AX and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) foci. telomestatin or telomestatin can reduce the expression of telomere-binding protein in HeLa cells. this leads to dissociation of the TRF2 from the telomere and eventually to disorder in telomere functions. it has been proposed that telomestatin competes with proteins for binding to G-quadruplex DNA. structure to TMPyP4, N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM), PIPER, isaindigotone derivative 37, NSC 19630, ML216, and bismuth porphyrin complex. a polyxylene derivative, PIPER, is able to specifically inhibit S.cerevisiae Sgs1p helicase\u2019s unwinding of G-quadruplex structure. isaindigotone derivative SYSU-ID-01 binds to the NM23-H2 protein with little binding affinity to G-quadruplex DNA. compound 37 is well-fitted into the narrow, slightly curved pocket that the dinucleotide possesses, and undergoes hydrogen bonding with residues in the channel of the protein active site. other isaindigotone derivatives developed by the same group were found to bind to both NM23-H2 and the G- a small molecule from the National Cancer Institute Diversity Set was identified. it inhibited WRN helicase activity but did not affect other DNA helicases. exposure of human cells to NSC 19630 dramatically impaired growth and proliferation, induced apoptosis. a series of reported biological functions make this structure a promising drug target in anti-tumor drug discovery. in this review, we discuss the structures, existence, and functions of G-quadruplexes."}
