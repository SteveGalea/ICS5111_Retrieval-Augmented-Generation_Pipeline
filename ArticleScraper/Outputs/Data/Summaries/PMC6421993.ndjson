{"summary": "immunoization in the dermal tissue elicits both T and B cell host immune responses in a dose-sparing fashion. DNA vaccines have been successfully delivered to the skin to protect against a variety of infectious diseases, such as Ebola, Lassa, and influenza. the principal mechanism by which EP aides the augmentation of the immune response elicited by DNA vaccines is by significantly increasing the number of cells transfected by the plasmid in the target tissue of choice. however, the increase in transfection rates are not the only in vivo mechanism mediated by EP. others include inflammatory cell infiltration at the treatment site, cell death after antigen expression, and/or upregulation of inflammatory signals. previous studies focused on the delivery of reporter genes into the guinea pig skin with CELLECTRA\u00ae-3P. in these historical studies, we identified transfected cells in the epidermis, dermis, and subdermal regions following CELLECTRA\u00ae-3P EP. we investigated localized tissue changes and inflammation resulting from the use of skin EP. pigs were group housed (3 per cage) with ad libidum access to water and food. all animals were housed and handled according to the standards and protocols of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at BTS, Inc. images were generated using the ANSYS Maxwell Finite Element Analysis software. biopsies were immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 12 h at 4\u00b0C. biopsies were immersed in 30% (w/v) Sucrose in D.I. water. PI was diluted out by hydrostatic and osmotic pressure in the interstitial fluid. the harvested skin was put on ice for transport. the PI signal on the skin surface was imaged with an Olympus BX51 microscope. treatment site skin biopsies were harvested at the indicated time points, processed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. calreticulin fixed-frozen skin sections were incubated with 50 L blocking buffer per section for 30 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber. polyclonal rabbit anti-human calreticulin antibody was diluted 1:100 in diluent buffer. animals and treatment Female Hartley guinea pigs were 13 months of age when they entered this study. animals were group housed (3 per cage) with ad libidum access to water and food. electrical-field generated by the CELLECTRA\u00ae-3P during first pulse (face view) (C) and second pulse (face view) (D) and between electrodes 1 and 3 during first pulse (lateral view) (E) strength of E-field is color coded, with red for highest and blue for lowest field strength (F) skin biopsies were excised postmortem at different time points (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 24 h) after the EP treatment 50 L of 10 g/ml PI (Sigma) in PBS was injected at the EP treatment site. the guinea pig was sacrificed 20 minutes later according to standard institutional protocol. high resolution images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM780 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Carl Zeiss LLC, Jena, Germany) high resolution scanned images were collected from whole segments of dermis and autostitched with Zeiss tiling software into one large mega image. cellular infiltration at the dermal electroporation site was immediately applied at the site of administration. Optimal dilution of the calreticulin antibody was determined on sections of guinea pig thyroid gland. Fifty microliters of the staining solution was added to each section. sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. needles are 3 mm in length and 26 Gauge. they form an isosceles triangle with a 5 mm distance from needle 1 to 2 and needle 2 to 3 and a 3 mm distance from needle 1 to 3. electrode needles penetrate through epidermis and dermis. cellular infiltration at 24 hours was comparable to the level observed 6 h after treatment suggesting a plateau effect. the level of infiltration was not as high as had previously been observed after the delivery of pDNA with CELLECTRA\u00ae-3P. this suggested that the addition of pDNA in addition to the EP treatment further potentiated the influx of motile cells at the treatment site. one hundred microliters of plasmid-encoded Red Fluorescent Protein (pRFP) (50 g) was administered to guinea pig skin. skin sections were stained with DAPI (blue) and TUNEL (green) at 6 h after treatment the PI signal was decreased, and it has returned to background levels by 24 h after treatment. intradermal electroporation of the skin results in a rapid but brief occurrence of cell death. epidermal cells in close proximity to insertion point of electrode needle were strongly impacted by electroporation treatment. morphology of cell nuclei in this region closest to electrodes was altered. majority of cells in upper layers of epidermis were TUNEL-positive 1 hour after treatment. skin sections were stained using the TUNEL-assay (green) and DAPI counterstained. images shown are single representations for sections obtained from five treatment sites. all panel inslets are 8 magnification. morphological change of PI-positive nuclei in the dermis was not as striking as the change observed in the epidermis after EP. low numbers of PI-positive nuclei could be observed as early as 1 h after treatment, with their number peaking between 2 and 4 h and decreasing between 6 and 24 h after treatment. the timing corresponded to early apoptotic events occurring one hour after EP. at four to six hours after EP, calreticulin was highly increased in the epidermis and the follicular epithelium. calreticulin expression was not closely localized to the electrode. the electroporation array of the CELLECTRA\u00ae-3P consists of three solid stainless steel electrode needles. the needles are 3 mm in length and 26 Gauge. the electrode needles penetrate through epidermis and dermis. cellular infiltration to the treatment site was observed as early as two hours after treatment. cellular infiltration at 24 hours was comparable to the level observed 6 h after treatment suggesting a plateau effect. the level of infiltration was not as high as had previously been observed after the delivery of pDNA with CELLECTRA\u00ae-3P. the epidermis was significantly increased along with pronounced disruption of the epidermal cellular structure in the region adjacent to the electrode insertion. the nuclei of cells in the EP-treated skin stained positive in a TUNEL assay to detect DNA strand breaks. injection of the PI in untreated skin resulted in a negligible increase of the PI signal detected on the skin surface. the PI signal was significantly increased 1hr after treatment, and peaking around two hours after the treatment. at 6 h after treatment the PI signal was decreased and it has returned to background levels by 24 h after treatment. apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by apoptosis indicated by PBS (100 L) was administered to guinea pig skin and the site was immediately electroporated. skin sections were stained using the TUNEL-assay (green) and DAPI counterstained. apoptosis was a rare event within 1 to 6 h of treatment. morphological change of TUNEL-positive nuclei in the dermis was not as striking. low numbers of PI-positive nuclei could be observed as early as 1 h after treatment. electric pulses stimulate the exposure of calreticulin in vitro. in nave skin, low calreticulin expression can be observed in the epidermis and the epithelial cells lining the hair follicles. calreticulin expression was significantly up-regulated in the dermis at this time. inflammatory mechanisms initiated after EP using an intradermal electroporation device, the CELLECTRA\u00ae-3P, in the guinea pig skin. we also detected infiltration of innate immune cells within hours of treatment. this fits with the established physiological response following a cell death event. infiltration of inflammatory cells into the area surrounding the treatment site peaked at 6 h. infiltration of inflammatory cells into the area surrounding the treatment site peaked at 6 h. calreticulin expression was also observed at these early time points. cells expressing calreticulin on their surface may signal via CD91. this would lead to cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens. previous studies have revealed reporter gene expression after EP-enhanced. gene expression has been detected in both the epidermis and the dermis following intradermal EP. the lower gene expression levels observed in the epidermis may be due to the increase in cell death events (both apoptotic and necrosis) induced by EP. dermal EP delivery of gene-based therapeutics will enhance our ability to further tailor EP-based delivery protocols to drive the gene expression levels and immune responses desired."}
