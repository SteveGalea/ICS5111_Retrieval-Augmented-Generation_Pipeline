{"summary": "nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-B) is an inducible transcription factor that plays a key role in inflammation and immune responses. previous studies have demonstrated that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection could activate NF-B in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. the causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA virus containing a genome of approximately 15 kb. the 5\u2019 two-thirds of the viral genome is occupied by overlapping open reading frames 1a (ORF1a) and 1b. these polyproteins encode nonstructural polyproteins (Nsp), pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. classical NF-B exists as heterodimers consisting of a 50-kDa subunit (p50) and a 65-kDa subunit (p65) under normal physiological conditions, NF-B is sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes by its interaction with a member of the inhibitory kappa B (IB) family. previous studies of PRRSV have demonstrated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein was a NF-B activator [30-32]. however, it remains unclear whether the PRRSV Nsps contribute to NF-B activation. cells were stimulated by 20 ng/ml TNF- at 30 h post-transfection. whole-cell extracts were prepared for the dual-luciferase activity at 6 h. p65 protein degraded in a dose-dependent manner in cytoplasmic extracts. phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 protein increased in a dose-dependent manner. p65 protein accumulated in the nucleus when co-expressed with Nsp2. anti-actin was included as a control for sample loading. cells were co-transfected with pDsRed-Nsp2 and p65 expression plasmid. PRRSV infection can induce several cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, RANTES, and TNF-, in porcine macrophages involved in the pulmonary inflammatory response. a promoter luciferase reporter assay was used to determine if Nsp2 enhanced NF-B-regulated target gene expression, including IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. luciferase reporter assays were performed at 36 h post-transfection. the results are expressed as fold induction of IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES promoter luciferase activity relative to the basal level. cells were co-transfected with the NF-B-Luc reporter plasmid (0.2 g), 0.05 g of pRL-TK, and the designated Nsp2 expression plasmids (0.6 g). cells were analysed at 36 h post-transfection and subjected to a dual-luciferase assay. the 30 amino acids discontinuous deletion in the Nsp2 coding region is not related to NF-B activation. however, the underlying mechanism may be due to the different capacities of replication or the alternative strategies in NF-B activation by different PRRSV strains. the deletion region was substituted with corresponding regions of low virulence strains. several mutants, including the HV (hypervariable region), PL2 (the putative enzyme domain truncated mutant), TM (the transmembrane region truncated mutant), showed a significant increase in NF-B luciferase activity. this suggests that the functional domain responsible for NF-B activation might be located in the middle HV of Nsp2 (P 0.01) the PL2 domain of PRRSV Nsp2 failed to activate NF-B when expressed independently. however, the HV region of Nsp2 could activate NF-B to similar levels as the full-length of Nsp2. this suggests that PRRSV Nsp2 is a multi-functional replicase subunit with different domains involved in different functions. expression plasmid and NF-B luciferase activity was monitored at 36 h post-transfection. a dose-dependent increase in luciferase reporter activity was observed. this data clearly indicated that Nsp2 was responsible for the induction of NF-B activation among PRRSV nonstructural proteins. nsp2 induced degradation of IB and nuclear translocation of NF-B. phosphorylation of NF-B subunit p65 (RelA) and nuclear translocation of NF-B. p65 protein increased in a dose-dependent manner in Nsp2-transfected cells. HeLa cells were co-transfected with RFP-tagged Nsp2 expression plasmid (pDsRed-Nsp2) and the EGFP-tagged p65 expression plasmid (pEGFP-p65) cells were fixed and permeabilized at 36 h post-transfection. PRRSV infection can induce several cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, RANTES, and TNF-, in porcine macrophages involved in the pulmonary inflammatory response. a promoter luciferase reporter assay was used to determine if Nsp2 enhanced the promoter activities of IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. -B inhibitor, BAY-117082, exhibited reduced ability to upregulate IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES expression in a dose-dependent manner. these observations suggest that Nsp2 stimulated cytokine expression via the NF-B signalling pathway. we assessed the ability of Nsp2 from different PRRSV strains to activate NF-B using a luciferase reporter assay. luciferase reporter assay showed a higher level of NF-B compared with that of the classical PRRSV strain. insertion mutants were denoted as Nsp2(+1), Nsp2(+29) and Nsp2(+1/+29) these mutants were then analysed for their capacities of stimulating NF-B in HeLa cells. these assays showed that NF-B activation by these Nsp2 insertion mutants was equivalent to that of the wild-type Nsp2 (Figure 4B) functional domain of Nsp2 for NF-B activation requires further investigation. six truncated mutants of Nsp2 were constructed. a NF-B reporter assay was performed to determine the functional region responsible for activation. a group of cells with empty vector transfected was stimulated with 20 ng/mL of TNF-. previous studies showed that the PRRSV Nsp2 OTU domain failed to activate NF-B when expressed independently. however, the HV region of Nsp2 could activate NF-B to similar levels as the full-length of Nsp2. PRRSV Nsp2 alone, in the absence of other PRRSV proteins, could significantly activate the NF-B pathway. the 30-aa deletion in the Nsp2 of HP-PPRSV was not associated with NF-B activation. monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-HA was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) polyclonal antibodies (pAb), anti-actin, p65, p-p65, IB, were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (Jiangsu, China) Plas luciferase reporter plasmid pNF-B-Luc contains four repeats of B binding motifs. other plasmids, such as IL-6-Luc, IL-8-Luc, RANTES-Luc, and COX-2-Luc, were constructed as previously described. cells treated with 20 ng/mL of TNF- (Sigma) for 6 h prior to harvest were used as a positive control. the empty vector was also used to adjust the total amount of transfected DNA to 1.05 g in dose-dependent experiments. the separated proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) membranes were blocked with 5% dried skim milk in tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) western blotting was performed using a standard technique. RANTES cells were transfected with 1 g of plasmid encoding Nsp2. total RNA was extracted from the transfected cells 36 h post-transfection. HP-PRRSV strain WUH3 was isolated from the brain of a pig with the \u201chigh fever\u201d syndrome in china at the end of 2006. monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-HA was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) p65 gene was derived from human RelA cDNA and cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector. all PCR amplification reactions were performed by PrimerSTARTM HS. the details of the specific primers used in PCR steps are available on request. transfection and luciferase reporter assay was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) cells were seeded on 24-well plates at a density of 2\u20134 105 cells/well. for each transfection, 0.2 g of the reporter plasmid (NF-B, IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, RANTES-Luc) and 0.6 g of various expression plasmids or empty control plasmid (pCAGG 1% NP40, 15 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Cocktail. boiled in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) protein sample buffer. separated proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. the pEGFP-p65 was co-transfected with pDsRed1-Nsp2, as well as the empty vector pDsRed-C1. at 36 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. quantitative real-time PCR Primer names Sequences(5\u2032-3\u2032) RANTES F: AGCCCTGTCATCCTG R: GGGCAATGTAGGCAAAGCAG IL-6 F: ACTCCACAACCCTCTCTCTGCAC COX-2 F: TTCTCTCTCTCTGCAC COX-2 F: TTCTCTCTCTCTGCAC COX-2 F: TTCTCTCTCTCTCTGCAC COX-2 F: TTCTCTCTCT"}
