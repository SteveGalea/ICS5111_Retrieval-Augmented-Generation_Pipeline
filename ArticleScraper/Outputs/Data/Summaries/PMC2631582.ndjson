{"summary": "mutations in genes coding for sodium channel proteins have been linked with several genetic disorders. inherited febrile epilepsy, ventricular fibrillation, long QT syndrome, or channelopathy associated insensitivity to pain. there is no publicly available resource focused on sodium channels that would support exploration. inherited erythromelalgia and inherited paroxysmal extreme pain disorder have been linked to these mutations in human. nearly 20 disorders affecting skeletal muscle contraction, cardiac rhythm, or neuronal function have been linked to these mutations in human. both sodium channel mutations and cell background contribute to neuronal function. a database for exploring human sodium channels provides useful information for drug development. the database is accessible via the worldwide web http://apps.sanbi.ac.za/ddesc. DES uses dictionary based text-mining approach for extracting potentially relevant information from text documents. the dictionary of genes and proteins contains over 300,000 variants of entities. the information in DDESC was based on 5,243 abstracts retrieved from PubMed repository. DES maps all entities from the dictionaries to the documents submitted for the analysis. DDESC is the first text- and data-mining based integrated knowledgebase. it allows researchers to get an overview and explore efficiently the biology of sodium channels. the user can select any combination of the used dictionaries. hypotheses generated by using \u2018FLUROTHYL\u2019 under the dictionary \u2018Chemicals with pharmacological effects\u2019 and \u2018SCN1A\u2019 gene under the dictionary \u2018Human Genes and proteins\u2019 retrieved eight PubMed documents. if no such PubMed document is found, this could suggest a possible genuine new hypothesis for further exploration. 81.1% of the entities related to genes and proteins are correctly identified. 14 entities (SCN, SCN1, SCN1, VOLTAGE-GATED K+ CHANNEL, GTP, Parvalbumin, P17, P21, PL-3, AED, GEF and SMEI) were wrongly identified as genes or proteins. a synonym for ARHGEF2 gene (rho/rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 2), but also an acronym for generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. DDESC identified 31 more entities as compared to polySearch. a total of 14 entities were identified in the dictionaries. this could be partly due to the content of the dictionaries. we also looked if the entities identified actually relate to sodium channels. DDESC will be updated every six months and the information from all new studies published in that period will be integrated. Competing interests VBB and AR are partners in the OrionCell company whose product, Dragon Exploration System, has been used in creation of DDESC."}
