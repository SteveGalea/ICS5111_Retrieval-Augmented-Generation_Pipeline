{"summary": "both the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) proteins are encoded by two exons arranged in alternative reading frames on fully spliced viral mRNA. both have RNA binding domains composed of arginine and, in case of Tat, lysine residues which bind to different HIV-1 RNA stem loop structures. hRIP/Rab, eIF5A, DDX3, DDX1, RNA helicase A, and PIMT can contribute to Rev nuclear export. the Rev:mRNA complex disassembles in the nucleolus (Fig. 1, step 3) allowing Rev to recycle back to the nucleus using the transportin 1 or importin nuclear import pathways. inhibition by Nullbasic was attributed, in part, to a subcellular redistribution of Rev from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. the inhibition by Nullbasic was attributed, in part, to a subcellular redistribution of Rev from the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. the two-exon Tat (101 amino acids) expression plasmid with FLAG epitope was a gift from monsef Benkirane, Institute de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Humaine, France. the GFP2 expression plasmid was obtained from Addgene, plasmid #20738. the pGCH infectious molecular clone is a HIV proviral plasmid which expresses authentic HIV-1 RNA using the CMV immediate early promoter expression vector encoding Nullbasic-mCherry was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mCherry from pmCherry-LacRep. cells were transfected with 4 g of Myc-Rev plasmid along with 2 g of either Tat-FLAG or Nullbasic-FLAG plasmids. cellular endogenous proteins were detected with rabbit anti-CRM1 polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-fibrillarin monoclonal (Cell Signalling Technology), mouse anti-nucleophosmin monoclonal (Invitrogen) and mouse anti-nucleophosmin monoclonal (Invitrogen) mouse anti-HIV-1 Rev monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibodies were detected with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen) and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen) the two-exon Tat (101 amino acids) expression plasmid with FLAG epitope was a gift from monsef Benkirane, Institute de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Humaine, France. the GFP2 expression plasmid was obtained from Addgene, plasmid #20738. the pGCH infectious molecular clone is a HIV proviral plasmid which expresses authentic HIV-1 RNA using the CMV immediate early promoter expression vector encoding Nullbasic-mCherry was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of mCherry from pmCherry-LacRep. was then inserted into the nullbasic-FLAG plasmid via BsrGI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites. cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. cellular endogenous proteins were detected with rabbit anti-CRM1 polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-fibrillarin monoclonal (Cell Signalling Technology), mouse anti-nucleophosmin monoclonal (Invitrogen) and mouse anti-nucleolin monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. myc-Rev was detected with a rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Cell primary antibodies were detected with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen), Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Invitrogen) and Cy3-congugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen) fluorescence images were captured using a leica TCS SP2 confo HIV-eGFP was transfected into cells with or without FLAG-tagged Nullbasic fused to the mCherry fluorescent reporter protein (Nullbasic-mCherry) the plasmid also has the eGFP gene inserted into the nef reading frame (here called HIV-eGFP) RNA transport leading to limited expression of viral proteins from unspliced or singly spliced viral mRNA [18] shows that nullbasic induces Rev redistribution without protein interaction. nuclei were stained with DAPI. cell lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to western blot analysis using anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies. the endogenous protein CDK9, detected using anti-CDK9 antibody, was used as a positive control for Tat interaction. others have shown that wild type Tat does not interact with Rev within cells [26], [27], [28]. nullbasic-induced redistribution of Rev is CRM1 dependent. heLa cells were transfected to express Myc-Rev alone. expression of nullbasic alone had no apparent effect on CRM1 distribution. nuclei were stained with DAPI. cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-Myc and anti-CRM1 antibodies. NB-mCherry with the CRM1 panel (row 4) the subcellular localizations of Myc-RevM10 (green), NB-mCherry (red) and endogenous CRM1 (magenta) were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Figures are representative of five fields each from four independent experiments. HeLa cells were transfected to express Myc-Rev alone (row 1), Nullbasic (NB)-mCherry alone (row 2) or Myc-Rev with NB-mCherry (row 3). fixed cells were immunostained with anti-Myc (green) and anti-B23 (magenta) antibodies before subcellular localizations of Myc-Rev, endogenous B23 and NB-mCherry (red) were analyzed by fluor nuclei were transfected to express Myc-Rev alone (rows 1 and 4), Nullbasic (NB)-mCherry alone (rows 2 and 5) or cotransfected Myc-Rev with NB-mCherry (rows 3 and 6) fixed cells were immunostained with anti-Myc (green) antibodies before subcellular localizations of Myc-Rev, endogenous C23 or endogenous fibrillarin. transportin 1 is the dominant Rev nuclear import pathway [22], [40], while the importin pathway is favored in HEK293T cells [40]. nullbasic-mediated blockade of a nuclear import pathway leads to the observed cytoplasmic accumulation of Rev in the presence of two NLS-containing reporters. nuclei were stained with DAPI. Plasmid expressing GFP2 was transfected into cells either alone or with NB-mCherry as a vector control. ization in HeLa cells showed that Nullbasic fused to FLAG or mCherry had very similar patterns of distribution in the nucleus and cytoplasm. localization of Rev was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-Rev antibody 24 h post-transfection. HEK293T cells were transfected with either empty vector (pcDNA3.1) or plasmids expressing Nullbasic (NB)-FLAG alone, Tat-FLAG alone or Myc-Rev with either NB-FLAG or Tat-FLAG. expression of HIV-eGFP was confirmed in the FITC channel (green) plasmids encoding FLAG epitope-tagged Nullbasic (Nullbasic-FLAG) and Myc-Rev did not co-immunoprecipitate Myc-Rev. the latter interaction is most likely similar to the interaction between wild type Tat and CDK9, through the activation domain preserved in Nullbasic-FLAG. myc-Rev expression induced relocalization of Rev and CRM1 in nucleoli. expression of nullbasic alone had no apparent effect on CRM1 distribution. colocalization could be reversed by treating cells with leptomycin B. the figure is representative of five fields each from four independent experiments. the white bar in last panel is equal to 10 m. nucleolar chaperone and shuttling protein observed in both nucleolus and nucleoplasm. mutant Tat proteins lacking a basic domain have been reported not to interact with B23 in vitro. expression of Nullbasic-mCherry alone had no apparent effect on B23 nuclear distribution. coexpression of Myc-Rev and Rev alters the subcellular localization of B23. panels show the merge of the Myc- Rev panel with the B23 panel (rows 1 and 3) and the NB-mCherry panel with the CRM1 panel (row 2). Figures are representative of five fields each from four independent experiments. the white bar in last panel is equal to 10 m. fixed cells were immunostained with anti-Myc (green), either anti-C23 (magenta, upper panels) or anti-fibrillarin (magenta, lower panels) antibodies before subcellular localizations of Myc-Rev, endogenous C23 or endogenous fibrillarin. NB-mCherry (red) stained with DAPI. nullbasic-mCherry did not affect localization of GFP2 lacking a nuclear import signal. similar experiments indicated that coexpression of Myc-Rev with Nullbasic likewise had no effect on the nuclear localizations of the respective reporters. nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Rev is critical for HIV-1 infectivity. nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Rev requires coordinated transport of incompletely spliced viral mRNAs from the nucleus. nullbasic\u2019s action in downregulating Rev\u2019s mRNA transport function is therefore of great importance. our evidence strongly indicates that CRM1 is a mediator through which Nullbasic induces Rev redistribution. this was evident through the use of LMB (Fig. 3), a specific inhibitor of CRM1 and the RevM10 mutant, whose altered NES is no longer recognized or bound by CRM1. in both cases, Rev retained a nucleolar localization despite high levels of nullbasic expression. nullbasic did not affect the localizations of CRM1, B23 and C23 in the absence of Rev. it indicates that nullbasic is not inducing a generalized deformation or reconfiguration of cellular nucleoli. it is evident, therefore, that Nullbasic induces the redistribution of CRM1, B23 and C23 only in the presence of Rev. replication of certain DNA and RNA viruses requires the trafficking of viral proteins through the nucleolus [42]. in some instances, for example during herpes simplex virus and adenovirus infections, this results in the dramatic mislocalization of C23 and B23 [42], [49]. basic appears to interact with and disrupt specific components of a Rev trafficking complex required for Rev nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. cells were transfected to express Myc-Rev alone (row 1), Tat-FLAG alone (row 2), Nullbasic (NB)-FLAG alone (row 3), Myc-Rev with Tat-FLAG (row 4) or NB-FLAG (rows 5)."}
