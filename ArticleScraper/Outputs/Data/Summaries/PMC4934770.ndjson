{"summary": "incidence of sepsis rising rapidly by 75% between 1993 and 2003 in france. average total costs associated with individual cases in Germany and the united states have been estimated at \u20ac23,297 and $22,100 respectively, with annual national burdens of \u20ac3.6\u20137.9 billion and $16.7 billion. based methods are hampered by treatment with inhibitory antibiotics prior to sampling [7, 15] and insensitive to non-cultivable or fastidious organisms such as Coxiella burnetii, Tropheryma whipplei, and species of genera such as Bartonella, Rickettsia, Mycobacterium, and nocardia [16, 17]. despite the low apparent sensitivity of existing broad-spectrum molecular methods with respect to culture, such universal lysis and DNA extraction method paired with conserved-site PCR primers capable of generating amplicons from >95% of the eubacteria and Candida species associated with human infection. method uses an automated desalting and DNA debulking platform to prepare amplicons for mass spectrometry [24, 34] and an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry platform capable of discriminating amplicon sequence variants from one or more different species present in a sample clinical sample collection and testing Two hundred and eighty-five 5 ml whole blood samples were prospectively collected from consenting patients who presented to the Johns Hopkins Hospital Emergency Department. samples were collected by phlebotomists in EDTA blood tubes following blood draws taken for standard-of-care culture analysis, using same venipunctures. samples were then blinded by replacement of identifying information with numerical identifiers by study coordinators. a minimum of two sets of blood cultures consisting of an aerobic bottle (either standard or aerobic plus) and an anaerobic lytic bottle, each inoculated with 10 mL of blood. gram-positive rods were identified using either the Phoenix System, MALDI-ToF MS or cell wall fatty acid analysis. automated electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (IRIDICA MS), and a control and analysis computer (IRIDICA AC) each sample requires approximately 30 minutes of hands-on time for a single technician when run in batch mode. each sample requires approximately 30 minutes of hands-on time for a single technician. core test organisms The IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay detects and identifies all target bacteria using a common set of primers and analysis algorithms. the same is true for all target Candida. a tiered approach to validation was followed [27, 31]. clinical sample performance was evaluated by comparing IRIDICA BAC BSI assay results to culture results using 285 prospectively collected EDTA whole blood specimens. negative controls consisting of sterile buffer were run as part of every set of 1\u20136 samples run concurrently on the platform. negative results paired with valid secondary detections of unspiked organisms (contaminants) were excluded on the basis of potential competitive interference. culture results from a single blood culture bottle set were compared to IRIDICA BAC BSI assay results from a single test sample. in cases where the specific link between test sample and clinical sample could not be confirmed, the associated culture result was used as the comparator. IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay-positive, culture-negative discrepancies are known to be low. IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay resistance marker results were compared to phenotypic and/or genotypic resistance data reported by the clinical laboratory as part of post-culture standard-of-care isolate characterization. no resistance comparisons could be made because both methods report resistance markers or phenotypes only in association with specific bacterial detections. Ibis Biosciences performed the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay testing in the absence of chart and culture data. the clinical microbiology laboratory used the Bactec FX continuous monitoring blood culture instrument. the bottles routinely used for clinical care included the Bactec Lytic/10 anaerobic bottle. Candida species were identified using recovery on Chromagar, morphology, and the Phoenix System yeast panels. gram-negative (NMIC/ID-132) and gram-positive (PMIC/ID-105) panels. Molecular testing for mecA, vanA and vanB was performed using the Verigene BC-ID microarray system. Ibis Biosciences performed the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay testing in the absence of chart and culture data. the clinical microbiology laboratory used the Bactec FX continuous monitoring blood culture instrument. the bottles routinely used for clinical care included the Bactec Lytic/10 anaerobic bottle. Candida species were identified using recovery on Chromagar, morphology, and the Phoenix System yeast panels. phenotypic resistance-typing methods were performed on isolates using the Phoenix System and associated gram-negative (NMIC/ID-132) and gram-positive (PMIC/ID-105) panels. the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay Kit includes a pre-filled PCR reaction strip. the primers target broadly conserved bacterial and Candida genes. the primers target 4 specific antibiotic resistance markers, mecA, vanA, vanB and blaKPC, and an extraction control target. the limit of detection of the assay was characterized for the 4 core organisms in 5 ml aliquots of both EDTA whole blood and sterile buffer. the LODs of 19 additional bacteria and Candida species were determined and confirmed in the sterile buffer. the final (reported) LOD was defined as the lowest concentration at which all 5 replicates were detected and correctly identified. PCR calibrants are synthetic competitive DNA constructs that contain assay primer binding sites for one of the assay primer pairs contained in the well. the constructs are designed to produce unique base composition signatures which can be readily discriminated from the expected amplicons produced from target analytes. negative controls consisting of sterile buffer were run as a part of every set of 1\u20136 samples run concurrently on the platform. the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay Kit includes a pre-filled PCR reaction strip. the primers target broadly conserved bacterial and Candida genes. the primers target 4 specific antibiotic resistance markers, mecA, vanA, vanB and blaKPC. the core organisms included mecA+ Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vanA+/vanB+ Enterococcus faecium (VRE), blaKPC+ Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) and Candida albicans. all LODs were measured by initial testing of 5 replicates at each of several 2-fold dilution steps. negative controls consisting of sterile buffer were run as a part of every set of 1\u20136 samples run concurrently on the platform. negative results paired with valid secondary detections of unspiked organisms were excluded on the basis of potential competitive interference. culture results from a single blood culture bottle set were compared to IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay results from a single test sample. only one sample was collected from each subject for testing on the IRIDICA system. culture results from a single blood culture bottle set were compared to IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay results from a single test sample. IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay or culture were negative for these bacteria. no resistance comparisons could be made because both methods report resistance markers or phenotypes only in association with specific bacterial detections. the only species for which the assay LODs were 4 CFU/ml were streptococci, which occur in chains and therefore have a high and variable genome:CFU ratio. the assay successfully detected 47 additional diverse bacteria and Candida species in 2/2 replicates. the exception was bilirubin, for which all tested preparations were heavily contaminated with bacterial and fungal DNA. the assay still detected 11 of 12 spiked test organisms. the same contaminants were detected at both concentrations. the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay uses shared primers to detect targets. the assay successfully detected and accurately identified at least one of the two spiked analytes in 18/18 instances. only one of the two spiked analytes was detected, and in one case only VRE was detected. all organisms were spiked into EDTA whole blood (BAC BSI Assay), saline bronchoalveolar lavage collection fluid (BAC LRT Assay) or the sterile buffer used to dilute normally sterile body fluid and tissue specimens. the average time from sample preparation to first result during the reproducibility study was approximately seven hours. say produced 85 organism detections, while culture produced 45. all organism detections are shown in Tables 3, 4 and 5, while antibiotic resistance marker/phenotype results are shown in Table 6.

IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay-positive, culture-negative detections were supported by chart data showing positive detections of the same organisms. 61 negative controls were tested and yielded no detections, supporting the assumption that detections in the clinical samples represented organismal DNA present in the sample. results from the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay are shown in Table 6. all four core organisms\u2019 LODs were within 2-fold of each other. further analytical studies were performed in sterile buffer except as noted. the only species for which the assay LODs were 4 CFU/ml were streptococci, which occur in chains. the assay successfully detected 47 additional diverse bacteria and Candida species in 2/2 replicates when tested at single concentrations. these organisms include the species isolated by culture in >95% of BSI cases [30], organisms representing the full phylogenetic breadth of the assay. all 12 spiked analytes were detected at 171 mol/L bilirubin. the same contaminants were detected at both concentrations. the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay uses shared primers to detect related targets. the assay successfully detected and accurately identified at least one of the two spiked analytes in 18/18 instances. only one of the two spiked analytes was detected, and only VRE was detected. all organisms were spiked into EDTA whole blood (BAC BSI Assay), saline bronchoalveolar lavage collection fluid (BAC LRT Assay) or the sterile buffer used to dilute normally sterile body fluid and tissue specimens (BAC SFT Assay) comparison of positive IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay and standard-of-care culture results in clinical blood specimens from patients with suspected bloodstream infections, by organism. excluding potential contaminants Matched Positive BAC BSI Assay + / Culture \u2013 BAC BSI Assay\u2013/ Culture + Matched NegativeB Gram-positive (including Mycoplasma) Culture + Azospirillum lipoferum 0 1 0 Bacteria detected. no ID can be provided 0 1 0 Bacteroides fragilis 1 0 0 Candida glabrata 1 0 0 Candida tropicalis 1 1 0 Citrobacter freundii. 11 culture-negative, IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay-positive detections were supported by later organism-specific ID data which identified the same species as agents of infection. two hundred and seven samples were negative for all analytes by both culture and IRIDICA (matched true negatives) IRIDICA uses conserved-site primer pairs to amplify partially conserved regions from multiple species. targets with better matches to specific primer pairs may outcompete other species for amplification. negative results from both culture and the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay were considered negative only if the sample yielded negative results for all analytes. positive detections which thereby had indeterminate comparators were assigned to the \u201cadditional detection\u201d category in the final comparison. two hundred and seven samples yielded matched negative results for all analytes by both the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay and culture methods. eight Propionibacterium acnes detections were made by the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay and one by culture, none of which were matched. the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay may be more sensitive to P. acnes contamination than culture methods. the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay is capable of providing such identifications within eight hours of sample collection. the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay cannot determine antibiotic resistance phenotypes. the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay is sensitive to both infecting pathogens and environmental microorganisms introduced during sample collection and preparation. 11 of 46 unmatched IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay detections were specifically supported by subsequent identifications and/or diagnostic data from independent specimens. many of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay-positive, culture-negative detections represent clinically relevant bloodstream infections which were missed by culture in the original paired specimen.
