{"summary": "DENVs are members of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. each serotype can be divided into five to six genotypes. there is no standard genotyping classification [DENV-1, (Goncalvez et al., 2002); DENV-2, (Anez et al., 2011; Khan et al., 2008); DENV-4, (Abubakar et al., 2002) an autochthonous case of DENV infection was reported in 2014 for the first time in 70 years. a comprehensive DENV database based on the genotypes would be essential for tracing the outbreak source. to date, only two DENV databases provide genotype information. the DENV genotype database was constructed as follows: (1) all accessible DENV nucleotide sequences were collected; (2) the complete sequences of each protein region were extracted from the sequences. a blastn homology search was performed against the genotype database and the genotype of the most homologous sequence was assigned. the genotype of each gene was assigned manually according to the previous genotype database (Yamashita et al., 2013). a blastn homology search was performed against the genotype database and the genotype data was stored in a database using SQLite. the deNV nucleotide sequences were downloaded from the NCBI database using key words. a blastx homology search was performed to detect nucleotide regions that corresponded to each mature DENV protein. nucleotide regions that exhibited more than 85% sequence coverage were used for the subsequent analysis. a homology search program searches for the most homologous DENV sequence in the DGV database. the other interface shows the sources of imported dengue cases on the map. some genotypes have been abundantly sequenced and deposited in the public database, while others have rarely been sequenced. ant 35 Unknown 2 3414 DENV-3 I 326 II 742 III 1192 IV 5 V 34 Recombinant 9 Unknown 1 2309 DENV-4 I 295 IIA 223 IIB 385 III 7 Sylvatic 6 Recombinant 3 919. some biases in DENV serotype compositions were observed in several countries. for example, the dominant serotypes were DENV-1 and -2 in Mexico, DENV-1 and -4 in polynesian genome distribution for each DENV serotype in Asia in 2000\u20132014. possible borderline of genotype distribution in each serotype is shown as dash line. timeline change in the predominant genotypes. quently, the query sequence is divided into mature protein regions and displayed with a serotype/genotype assignment. the homology search results and the divided nucleotide sequences in fasta format can be downloaded. some genotypes have been abundantly sequenced and deposited in the public database. other genotypes have rarely been sequenced. some genotypes have been abundantly sequenced and deposited in the public database. distribution for all DENV (A) and genotype distribution for each serotype (B) in 2000\u20132014. the first border is between the american continents and other regions. the second is located between Bangladesh and Myanmar for the genotype distributions of DENV-1 and -2 and India and Myanmar for DENV-3. Asian American genotype was replaced by Asian I in Cambodia and Vietnam between 1998 and 2011. this suggests the idea of genotype transition, which probably reflects the mosquito vector habitat and human activities in the Indochinese Peninsula. the number of annual imported cases was also mapped on Google Maps. the serotype (but not genotype), year, and visiting country/area are also indicated based on the Infectious Agents Surveillance Report (IASR) the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
