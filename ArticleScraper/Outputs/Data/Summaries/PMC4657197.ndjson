{"summary": "japanese encephalitis (JE) is the major cause of viral encephalitis worldwide. there has been no report describing the regulation of JE progression using immunomodulatory tools. blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway would regulate JE progression. BB signaling pathway in myeloid cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells played a dominant role in ameliorating JE. blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway ameliorates JE via divergent enhancement of IFN-II-producing NK and CD4+ Th1 cells."}
