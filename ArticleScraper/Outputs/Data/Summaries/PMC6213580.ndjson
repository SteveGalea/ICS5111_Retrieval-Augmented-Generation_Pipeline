{"summary": "HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2002 and 2003, there have been no SARS-CoV transmitting within the human population after July 2003 [9,10]. a total of 2220 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including 790 associated deaths, were reported globally. a major MERS-CoV outbreak was reported in the Republic of Korea, with 186 infected individuals, resulting in 38 deaths. samples were tested for the presence of influenza viruses (A, B, and H1N1pdm) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), by qRT-PCR, as previously described [21,22]. to determine the presence of MERS-CoV we tested by qRT-PCR assays for targeting regions upstream of the E gene (upE) samples were obtained from over 26 outpatient clinics in different geographical regions in different geographical regions in Israel. 195 HCoV-positive samples from hospitalized patients were detected at Soroka University Medical Center between July 2015 to June 2016. SS\u00ae Statistics software (SAS 9.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Excel software (Excel 2013 v15.0, Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) analyzed samples of influenza-like illness (ILI) patients in Israel for the presence of various viruses using qRT-PCR. the chi-square statistic is 35.9447 and the p-value is 0.00001; (C,D) Distribution of respiratory virus infection in the 2015\u20132016 winter season, starting from the 40th week of 2015 until the 15th week of 2016. HCoVs and RSV showed similar patterns of infection, between October 2015 (week 42) and March 2016 (week 9). the highest number of infections for HCoV-OC43 were in weeks 51\u201352, for HCoV- the percent of all HCoV-positive cases (Line, Right Y-axis) and of each HCoV type (Bars, Left Y-axis) per patient age groups showed no significant differences in rates of diarrhea, vomiting, red throat and rhinitis cases between all viruses. more influenza-positive patients suffered from fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain and trembling as compared to HCoV. in hospitalized patients HCoV-OC43 (49.7%) and HCoV-NL63 (23.1%) constituted the majority while HCoV-229E (4.6%) was the minority. HCoV-HKU1 was absent from our previous survey probably due to summer seasonality. several samples showed multiple infections with HCoV and influenza or RSV. there were no cases of co-infection with multiple HCoV types. the highest number of infections for HCoV-OC43 were in weeks. more than fifty percent of HCoV-positive cases were in the 0\u201310 age group (Figure 2) while the remaining groups were around ten percent and below (Figure 2). HCoV-229E prevalence was low at all ages and absent in the 31\u201340 and 70+ age groups. fatigue, headache, muscle pain, trembling and sore throat symptoms were more common among HCoV-infected patients. other viruses responsible for upper respiratory tract infections were not analyzed (e.g., hPIV, hMPV, Rhinovirus, Adenoviruses, Bocaviruses) human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 infect people all over the world. no SARS-CoV infections have been reported since 2004. however, several outbreaks of MERS-CoV were noted in recent years. a study in rural Thailand found HCoV-OC43 was dominant over HCoV-229E. a retrospective study in australia tested for four HCoV types in the winter season of 2004. a total of 74 coronavirus infections were detected, with HCoV-HKU1 the most dominant. this is the first time HCoV-HKU1 is reported to circulate in summer season. the average temperature and humidity in Israel was 19 \u00b0C, 57% and 25 \u00b0C, 66% respectively. despite its circulation in the Middle East and recent eruption in South-Korea, no MERS-CoV has been reported in Israel since its first detection in Saudi-Arabia in 2012. it is difficult to predict the combination and dominancy of each HCoV type for the next season."}
