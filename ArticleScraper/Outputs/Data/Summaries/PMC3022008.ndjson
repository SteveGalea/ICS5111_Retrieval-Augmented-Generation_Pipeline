{"summary": "in 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus was largely spread by air travelers. at least 18 countries on 5 continents were affected, resulting in over 8,000 cases and 774 fatalities. one conservative estimate of the economic damage to Asian countries was calculated as $11 billion [2] to establish a Type II error rate, we surveyed literature and compiled microbial information from studies onboard aircraft. however, the granularity of the available data is insufficient to derive an acceptable Type II error rate. the initial focus is to evaluate the feasibility of installing a biosensor system on overseas international flights (e.g., from China) measurements of airflow were conducted using mock airliner cabins with [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] and without [18] simulated passengers. chemical contaminants such as SF6 tracer gas and bio-simulant particles such as mono-dispersed (0.7 micron) di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacat [DEHS] have been modeled using the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations based the results are summarized in Table S1 for asthma [20], [21], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [22], [23], [24], chronic cough [25], [26], [27], [28], cystic fybrosis [25], primary ciliary dyskinesia [31], pulmonary tuberculosis [23], and pneumonia [23]. based on these results, we assume that a typical infectious passenger can sneeze from 4 to 50 times in our simulations, we specified some number of infected passengers whom we considered to be contaminant producers. the locations of the mouths of these passengers are the initial positions of simulated exhaled particles. each of the infected passengers released the same amount of contaminant within each case simulated. steady-state masses in case A were computed to be 3.43109 kg, 5.12109 kg, and 3.07109 kg for scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively. these masses correspond to approximately 6106 bacterial and 6106 viral particles in scenario 1, over 1.0107 bacterial and over 8103 viral particles in scenario 2, and over 1.0105 bacterial and over 1.7105 viral particles in scenario 3. we applied two factors to obtain the biological particles per cubic meter of cabin space. first, the total number of biological particles per cubic meter of cabin space. bacterial particles were multiplied by a viable fraction of 4.7104. viral particles were multiplied by an estimated viable fraction of 5.9105 to obtain biological particle counts per cubic meter. the total cumulative numbers of collectable viable biological particles in a 90-minute continuous sampling interval were calculated based on a typical collector flow rate. based polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) amplification are known to have limits of detection of less than 10 copies. the typical LoD for a COTS antibody-based biosensor system ranges from 103\u2013104 organisms per test. based on these analyses, COTS collectors and biosensors would be sufficiently sensitive to detect bacterial targets in a 90-minute sampling interval. in both cases C and D, we found that over 600 bacterial particles would be detected in a 90-minute sampling interval (Table 1, Case C and D, row e), while no more than one viral particle would be detected. this suggests that onboard detection would not be feasible for bacterial- or viral- particles in cases C and D. a time history study is required to understand the movements of contaminant particles released during expiratory events. each passenger sneezes once and the fluid expelled at each seat location was tracked. the resultant history of the contaminant in the cabin is computed in terms of contaminant mass. the contaminant concentration shown in Figure 5A represents the contaminant mass divided by the cabin volume. the numbers represent average concentrations across each four-row cabin section. contaminants emitted from window seats enter the outlet vent much faster than those emitted from other seats. particles emitted from aisle seat passengers near the windows tend to linger longer. they enter the recirculation zone at a location where the air is pushing the particles away from the vents. the simulations were based on a representative Boeing 767 aircraft cabin. the average person breathes 20 times a minute and each breath may contain 0.5 liters of air. exhaling passengers are not covering their mouths during coughing and sneezing. the rate of exhalation for breathing is significantly higher for breathing. the viable fraction of infectious bacteria per sneeze is 8.110-6. this is less than the viable fractions used to compute the total number of collectable viable particles in Table 1, row e. all sneeze data was based on a single 1946 study by Duguid. fewer breaths per minute in the breathing-and-sneezing scenario compared to breathing-only scenarios. newer data from sneeze experiments used sick persons as subjects. ANSYS CFX commercial software was used for the CFD simulations. the software computes the contaminant transport via advection and diffusion. this method of modeling is valid when the particle diameter is relatively small. a renormalized group kinetic energy-dissipation (RNG -) turbulence model was used because of the model's reasonable accuracy and low computational cost. at the inlet, a mass flow rate of 0.313 kg/s was applied. the model was tested using each of the 8\u201d, 4\u201d, and 2\u201d meshes according to the settings described in Table 3. for Scenario 1 \u2013 Breathing and Coughing 35 1.86104 m3/s Exhaled Air per Passenger for Scenario 3 \u2013 Breathing Only 35 1.67104 m3/s Scenario Descriptions Three types of scenarios were simulated: (1) breathing and coughing, (2) breathing and sneezing, and (3) simply inhaling through the nose and exhaling from the mouth. in scenario 3, the simulated infected passenger simply breathed 20 times per minute six different scenarios were tested, including breathing through the nose (b-n-n), breathing through the nose and exhaling from the mouth (b-n-m), whispered counting, voiced counting, and coughing. the average amount of fluid (from saliva) and air expelled per person during scenarios 1 through 3 are also summarized in Table 3 in columns 4 and 5 respectively. 2 m and 237.9 particles had diameters between 2 and 20 m. we then compared the concatenated particle size distribution with the more recent cough distribution. we then elected to use Morawska's data for particles under 10 microns and Loudon and Roberts' data for particles between 11.6 and 20 m. in this work, we calculated the mean volume of particles in each corresponding diameter range, based on the minimal (dmin) and maximal (dmax) diameters within each range, consistent with prior work. the study did not assume 50% evaporative loss for diameter ranges for cases where inputs came from the Morawska dataset. we considered Duguid (1946), who used food dye, oiled slides, micrometry and three different test chambers to measure the average number of droplets and droplet-nuclei generated when subjects sneezed (106 particles), coughed (5103 particles), and spoke loudly (250 particles) duguid reported per-sneeze mean particle counts to be 26103, 160103, 350103, 280103, and 97103 for diameter ranges (m) 1\u20132, 2\u2013 to estimate the mean particle count under 20 microns diameter in a sneeze, we assumed that one sneeze corresponded to approximately 8.645105 particles. the particle size distribution followed those reported by Duguid [35], also shown in Figure 6. eezing 4 times per hour would emit on average 0.8 sneezes in 12 minutes. the same passenger breathing 20 times per minute would emit just under 98 breaths in 12 minutes. ANSYS CFX commercial software was used for the CFD simulations. the software computes the contaminant transport via advection and diffusion. it assumes that particles follow airflow streamlines. the turbulence model was tested using each of the 8\u201d, 4\u201d, and 2\u201d meshes according to the settings described in Table 3. the model was tested using each of the 8\u201d, 4\u201d, and 2\u201d meshes according to the settings described in Table 3. ger for Scenario 3 \u2013 Breathing Only 35 1.67104 m3/s Scenario Descriptions Three types of scenarios were simulated: (1) breathing and coughing, (2) breathing and sneezing, and (3) simply inhaling through the nose and exhaling from the mouth. in scenario 3, the simulated infected passenger simply breathed at a rate of 20 breaths per minute. six different scenarios were tested, including breathing through the nose (b-n-n), breathing through the nose and exhaling from the mouth (b-n-m), whispered counting, voiced counting, and coughing. Loudon and Roberts [51] used an air-tight box and millipore filter air sampler. the cough analyses are based on data presented by Morawska [33] and Loudon and Roberts as corrected by Nicas for evaporative losses [32], [51]. we estimated the total volume per exhalation by applying equations described by Nicas [32] using particle size distribution from two of Morawska's experimentation scenarios: (i) breathing normally through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. the aerodynamic particle sizer employed by the Morawska study had counting efficiencies that deviated from 100%. the sizer's counting efficiency was (%) 30, 100, and 60, respectively, for particle sizes (m) 0.5, 0.9, and 5 [54]. subjects sneezed (106 particles), coughed (5103 particles) and spoke loudly (250 particles) duguid reported per-sneeze mean particle counts to be 26103, 160103, 350103, 280103, and 97103 for diameter ranges (m) 1\u20132, 2\u20134, 4\u20138, 8\u201316, and 16\u201324, respectively. particles were expelled during a single expiratory event based on V 20. for breathing, coughing, or sneezing, the steady-state mass was divided by the weighted sum of one cough and one breath. the same passenger breathing 20 times per minute would emit 96 breaths in the same 12 minutes. the V 20 for one breath was converted to mass and multiplied by 99.2%. the V 20 for one sneeze was converted to mass and multiplied by 0.8%. to estimate the number of collectable biological particles, we surveyed the literature. italics represent cases where median values are reported by primary literature. study reports cough frequency in cough seconds per hour."}
