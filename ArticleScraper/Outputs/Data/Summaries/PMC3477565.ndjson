{"summary": "protein intrinsic disorder and viral behavior Previously, we provided evidence that the behavior of viruses can be predicted from the analysis of their predicted intrinsic disorder in their protein shells. the predicted disorder in the matrix of retroviruses was shown to vary with the mode of the viral transmission. the HIV and EIAV viruses, that are related but have distinct different modes of transmission, were used to illustrate this point since. coronaviruses have been known to cause respiratory diseases and gastroenteritis. greater attention was given to this family of viruses when the SARS-CoV moved into human hosts beginning in 2002 and inflicted 1091 deaths. HCoV tends to spread more efficiently by a respiratory route, whereas the animal CoVs tend to spread most efficiently by direct contact. contact and oral-fecal routes are generally the most efficient mode of coV spread in animals. coronaviruses are generally classified into three groups based on their genetic and antigenic makeup. the virus included are porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and human coronaviruses (HCoV) protein intrinsic disorder predictors of protein intrinsic disorder. similarity in protein intrinsic disorder prediction does not necessarily reflect the genetic proximity of proteins studied, but rather could be related to evolution, the modes of transmission, and the environment. development of such predictors provided a direct support for the hypothesis that intrinsic disorder is encoded in protein amino acid sequences. the predictor used in this paper is PONDR VLXT (Predictors of Naturally Disordered Regions), which is a set of neural network predictors of disordered regions. a model that could predict how a virus will behave in terms of transmission would be extremely useful for both clinical and fundamental research. a model that could predict how a virus will behave in terms of transmission would be extremely useful for both clinical and fundamental research. this paper extends the line of research on protein intrinsic disorder in viral proteins to coronaviruses. there is no satisfactory explanation for the observation that many of those infected with SARS-CoV did not have any contact with the infected individuals [14]. HCoV-229E is the most studied HCoV. a quick overview of virus structure needs to be put forth. the hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE, 65 kD), membrane/matrix glycoprotein (M, 25 kDa) and small envelope glycoprotein (E, 9\u201312 kD) are all likely to play a greater role in protecting the virion from damage. the N-protein is an RNA binding protein. categorization of coronaviruses based on intrinsic disorder propensities of their proteins might provide useful clues for useful hypotheses. the main tools used here are the predictors of protein intrinsic disorder. intrainsic disordered proteins have also been described by various other names. disordered proteins/regions were shown to be significantly depleted in bulky hydrophobic (Ile, Leu, and Val) and aromatic amino acid residues (Trp, Tyr, and Phe), which would normally form the hydrophobic core of a folded globular protein. the depletion of disordered protein in Cys is crucial as this amino acid residue is known to have a significant contribution to protein conformation stability via the disulfide bond formation. XT (Predictors of Naturally Disordered Regions) is a set of neural network predictors of disordered regions on the basis of local amino acid composition, flexibility, hydropathy, and other factors. these predictors classify each residue within a sequence as either ordered or disordered. the avian coronavirus, IBV, is characterized by the highest PID level. the high PID variance (standard deviation) of the HCoV M- and N-proteins should be noted. both features likely hint to a higher respiratory spread component. the mean PIDs of the M- and N-proteins for all these animal coronaviruses are below 50%, unlike human or avian coronaviruses. differences are seen between the strains of porcine and canine coronaviruses. a breakdown of the HCoV PIDs by strains shows the unusually high and low PIDs for the M- and N-proteins of the HCoVs 229E and HKU1. the noticeable differences in the PID values of HCoV 229E and SARS-CoV should also be noted. the new grouping of coronaviruses is based on the disorder analysis of the viral shells, and in particular their N-proteins. a correlation between common transmission behavior and the disorder characteristics of the viruses in each group can be observed. a correlation between common transmission behavior and the disorder characteristics of the viruses in each group can be observed. data shown in Table 3 can be used for the prediction of the levels of respiratory and oral-fecal transmission modes for each virus in a group based on the PIDs of their M- and N-proteins. for example, we can conclude that viruses in Group A will have greater respiratory component than those in Group B or C. a new tab 3D representation with predicted disorder annotation of parts of the nucleocapsid proteins of IBV and SARS-CoV. the red color denotes residues predicted to be disordered by PONDR VLXT. cyan and green represent regions that are predicted to be ordered. the mean PID of the IBV N-protein is 56%, while the corresponding PID of SARS-CoV N-protein is only 50%. a comparison of the mean PID of membrane (matrix glycoprotein, M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of coronavisruses with those of the influenza A virus and RNA viruses in general. similarities and dissimilarities can be observed. the mean PIDs of the M- and N-proteins of various animal coronaviruses are below 50%, unlike human or avian coronaviruses. the differences are seen between the strains of porcine and canine coronaviruses. coronavirus Strain PID (%) in M-proteins PID (%) in N-proteins UniProt Accession (N) TGEV FS772/70 14 43 P09175 P05991 PEDV CV777 8 51 P59771 Q07499 PEDV Br1/87 13 NA P59770 NA SARS NA 8 50 P59596 P59595 2.3. the new grouping of coronaviruses is based on the disorder analysis of the viral shells, and in particular their N-proteins. a correlation between common transmission behavior and the disorder characteristics of the viruses in each group can be observed. a new categorization of coronaviruses by predicted disorder. TGEV has a low nucleocapsid PID but unusually high matrix PID. but because of the unusually low nucleocapsid disorder, TGEV is placed in group C. higher levels of fecal-oral and contact transmission. Lesser levels of the respiratory transmission component. a rough disorder analysis revealed that the PID of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid is 50%, whereas in the case of IBV nucleocapsid, the mean PID is of 56%. this difference may be reflected on their structural differences. influenza viruses and coronaviruses have high predicted disorder in their nucleocapsid proteins. this suggests that higher nucleocapsid disorder may be necessary for viruses with ability to spread via respiratory means. a correlation between the PID levels in the viral shell proteins and the virus transmission modes. ocapsid and matrix proteins are often associated with increased levels of fecal-oral transmission mode. these correlations can be due to the need of a given virus to adjust to changes in the environmental conditions associated with the process of transmission between the hosts. shell proteins of these viruses are assembled into a flexible shield, the pliability of which helps viruses to rapidly adjust to the environmental changes. the porcine and canine coronaviruses have greater fecal-oral components. the bovine coronaviruses are more efficiently transmitted via the respiratory routes. this suggests that intrinsic disorder can produce useful information for better understanding of the viral behavior. the level of predicted disorder in the TGEV N-protein is noticeably lower than that of the PEDV analogue. we hypothesize that some strains of PEDV are likely to be more persistent outside the physiological environments when compared to TGEV. this hypothesis is consistent with the observed PEDV ability to survive in the harsh nonphysiological environment. porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is a mild variant of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) that has been observed to transmit predominantly by respiratory means. a potential evolutionary misfit may also explain why the symptoms resulting from the PRCV infection are generally mild and why PRCV is a vaccine strain. this potential evolutionary misfit may also explain why the symptoms resulting from the PRCV infection are generally mild. avian coronavirus (IBV) and human HCoV-229E are characterized by the high predicted disorder levels. the only virus that possesses the comparable level of disorder is the human coronavirus 229E. despite the comparable disorder levels at the nucleocapsid, the M-protein of IBV-CiV is predicted to be relatively more ordered than the corresponding protein of the influenza virus. this is an indication of the greater likelihood of the presence of the virus in stools, despite its predominant respiratory transmission. this may point to the greater possibility of fecal-respiratory transmission in IBV. HCoV-229E has the highest PID rates among HCoVs. HCoV-HKU1 is quite different from other HCoVs. this suggests that it is difficult to expect that all the HCoVs would have the same transmission characteristics as HCoV-229E. genetic proximity does not necessarily translate into the disorder pattern similarity. this suggests that HCoV-HKU1 and MHV may also possess similar transmission behavior. these hypotheses are consistent with previously described direct observations of the mostly respiratory transmission mode of HCoV-229E. SARS-CoV: Understanding the Transmission Behavior of Coronaviruses via Predicted Disorder 3.5.1. the exact modes of SARS-CoV spread remain unclear as of yet. there are no appropriate animal models for the SARS-CoV transmission modes. V has a higher oral-fecal component than the former but lower oral-fecal component than the latter. this suggests a greater likelihood of being spread via the fecal-respiratory mode, which affirms what has been long suspected clinically. the role of fecal-respiratory transmission also explains many of features observed for PEDV, and not for its counterpart, TGEV. the differences between PEDV and TGEV in terms of shell disorder and observed spread characteristics offer some clues to this conundrum. the same reasoning used to predict the environmental persistence and the greater fecal-respiratory transmission component in PEDV can be extended to explain the behavior of SARS-CoV. a correlation between the PID levels and the localization of surface proteins is seen for all viral nucleocapsid, capsid, and matrix proteins analyzed so far. the stepwise decrease in the PIDs is seen for all viral nucleocapsid, capsid, and matrix proteins. higher levels of disorder in the viral shell proteins are likely to be associated with greater probability of respiratory transmission. lower PID levels in the nucleocapsid and matrix proteins are conversely associated with increased levels of fecal-oral transmission mode. these correlations can be due to the need of a given virus to adjust to changes in the environmental conditions associated with the process of transmission between the hosts. influenza viruses and coronaviruses have high predicted disorder in their nucleocapsid proteins. this suggests that higher nucleocapsid disorder may be necessary for viruses with ability to spread via respiratory means. a correlation between the PID levels in the viral shell proteins and the virus transmission modes. lower PID levels in the nucleocapsid and matrix proteins are often associated with increased levels of fecal-oral transmission mode. these correlations can be due to the need of a given virus to adjust to the changes in the environmental conditions associated with the process of transmission between the hosts. however, the viruses that are spread via the respiratory mode may experience greater environmental pressure during transmission. the porcine and canine coronaviruses have greater fecal-oral components. bovine coronaviruses are more efficiently transmitted via the respiratory routes. all these factors are apparently more definitive determinants of the intrinsic disorder levels in the viral shell proteins than the genetic proximities. a puzzling aspect of the PEDV is that this virus has the ability to reemerge to infect hosts months after the breeding areas have been cleaned. this suggests that PEDV is perhaps more persistent in the environment outside the host organism. our analysis suggests that intrinsic disorder can produce useful information for better understanding of the viral behavior. the comparison of the PID levels in the M- and N-proteins suggests that various coronaviruses can be grouped as shown in Table 3. the structural disorder similarity suggests that the behaviors of these two viruses might also be similar. a puzzling aspect of the PEDV is that this virus has the ability to reemerge to infect hosts months after the breeding areas have been cleaned. the level of predicted disorder in the TGEV N-protein is noticeably lower than that of the PEDV analogue. TGEV spreads more easily since contact and oral-fecal modes are the more advantageous forms of transmission among swine [17, 18]. the comparison of the PID levels in the M- and N-proteins suggests that various coronaviruses can be grouped. the structural disorder similarity suggests that the behaviors of these two viruses might also be similar. a potential evolutionary misfit may explain why the symptoms resulting from the PRCV infection are generally mild and why PRCV is a vaccine strain. the observation may also suggest a new vaccine search strategy based on the recognition of viruses or strains that are evolutionary misfits. in HCoV-229E, both M- and N-proteins are disordered, whereas in IBV-CoV, the nucleocapsid is more disordered. the PID of the M is only slightly above average. this implies that the IBV virus could also be present in the gastrointestinal region. HCoV-229E is easily transmissible by respiratory modes, whereas SARS-CoV is more easily transmitted via contact. HCoV-229E is generally characterized by high PID levels of their M-proteins. this suggests that many human coronaviruses may have a higher \u201crespiratory\u201d component in their transmission mode. HCoV-HKU1 may be quite different from the other HCoVs. a case was described where HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a patient suffering from hepatitis. this suggests HCoV-HKU1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis. more moderate PID levels in HCoV and many animal CoVs imply that these viruses are likely to have reasonably high levels of both oral-fecal and respiratory components. a larger fecal-oral component will allow them to persist in the environment for a longer time, or via the fecal-respiratory mode. this difference is likely due to the greater complexity of the human immune system. avian coronavirus nucleocapsid is characterized by the high predicted disorder levels. the only virus that possesses the comparable level of disorder is the human coronavirus 229E (Figures 3\u20135) IBV-CoV has been reported to be present in feces of infected birds. respiratory mode is believed to be the main transmission means. similar interpolations can also be made using the analysis of the various porcine coronaviruses in terms of their shell disorder and their respective transmission behavior. HCoV-HKU1 is quite different from other HCoVs, even though several of them are found in the same group. a case was described where HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a patient suffering from hepatitis [40] moderate disorder in SARS-CoV and PEDV-CoV When compared to HCoV-229E Based on the results of the disorder analysis, we can hypothesize that there is a great likelihood that HCoV-229E is most easily spread via the respiratory mode. a larger fecal-oral component will allow them to persist in the environment for a longer time, or via droplets or aerosols. the exact modes of SARS-CoV spread remain unclear as of yet. there are no appropriate animal models for the SARS-CoV transmission modes. the virus is likely to have intermediate levels of respiratory and fecal-oral components. a sign of persistence of SARS-CoV and some specific strains of PEDV can be found in the relatively low PID levels of their M-proteins (8%), especially when compared to viruses such as TGEV (14%) and HCoV-229E (23%). a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in this ability remains elusive. the intrinsic disorder in the SARS-CoV N-protein is relatively moderate. the intrinsic disorder in the SARS-CoV is higher than the corresponding levels in many animal coronaviruses, especially TGEV. the exact modes of SARS-CoV spread remain unclear as of yet. there are no appropriate animal models for the SARS-CoV transmission modes. the disorder analysis suggests that SARS-CoV falls in Category B. differences in transmission behavior and levels of shell disorder suggest special attention should be paid to the PID peculiarities of the M-protein. a sign of persistence of SARS-CoV and some specific strains of PEDV can be found in the relatively low PID levels of their M-proteins. the intrinsic disorder in the SARS-CoV N-protein is relatively moderate. Conversely, when the N-protein of SARS-CoV is compared to TGEV, the opposite is held true. a number of coronaviruses were sampled, and further support of the link was found. many coVs that are known to spread predominantly by the respiratory mode are highly disordered. this is especially the case for the HCoV-229E, for which both the M- and N-proteins are highly disordered. based on the lower nucleocapsid PID found in TGEV, we could expect to see a larger oral-fecal component in the transmission of this virus. this suggests that TGEV has much larger oral-fecal and contact components in transmission. this suggests that the levels of predicted disorder provide a definite way to evaluate the fitness of the virus. this analysis gives new clues for better understanding the spread behavior of viruses that have been known for years. 4.1. Predicting Viral Behaviors Using a Model Based on the Analysis of the Rigidity of the Shell Proteins. this model is based on the observation that viruses that are exposed to a less harsh environment require a more rigid encasement. an especially large respiratory component has been observed for HCoV-229E compared with animal coronaviruses including the avian IBV. a close similarity between the PID levels in the matrix and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV and PEDV. our analysis suggests that this ability to reemerge arises from the existence of both oral-fecal and respiratory components. therefore, the ability to have two transmission components can be determined by the peculiarities of the predicted intrinsic disorder distribution in the viral shell proteins. this model also suggests that reemerging behavior cannot be expected for TEGV. the relational database was modified to allow import and storage of the data from UNIPROT. a graphical user interface program was implemented using JAVA to allow easy entry of protein details and accession codes."}
