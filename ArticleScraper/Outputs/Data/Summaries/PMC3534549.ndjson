{"summary": "heat stress cognate 70 (Hsc70) is an ATP-binding protein of the heat stress protein 70 family. combined siRNAs targeting viral gene and siHsc70 are highly effective in suppressing ongoing HBV expression. combinational RNAi was sequence-specific, effective against wild-type and mutant drug-resistant HBV strains, without triggering interferon response or producing side effects. a 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA is reverse-transcribed into new HBV genomes and is reverse-transcribed into new HBV genomes. RNAs (2.4 and 2.1 kb) serve as mRNA for viral envelope proteins L, M, and S. from 0.7 kb RNA the HBV X protein is translated. RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene-silencing molecular mechanism. some siRNAs have been found to be potent sequence-dependent inductions of the mammalian innate immune response. they are also reported to be possessed of bifunctional antiviral molecules that induce production of type I IFNs in the liver and target HBV to inhibit viral replication. a number of host proteins have been found to be crucial for HBV/HCV replication [35-39] japan encephalitis virus infection in Huh7 cells presupposes the association of Hsp70 with lipid rafts. there has so far been no report on using the siHBV and endogenous Hsc70 targeting (siHsc70) combination to treat HBV. the expression of EGFP decreased markedly in the siEGFP group. this indicates that in addition to impacting post-transcriptional translation, siEGFP exercised its specific, gene-silencing effect on the EGFP. the expression of EGFP was determined by flow cytometry. the same conclusion was reached by making a comparison of the different groups. the correct transcription of EGFP and S was confirmed by sequencing of RT-PCR products. the results suggested that the siRNAs generated by intracellular transcription could effectively and specifically inhibit the expression of HBV in transfected cells. the amount of HBsAg and HBeAg in the cell culture supernatant was determined using ELISA at different time points after transfection. the HBsAg was reduced 60.7% by S1 and 72.7% by S2, while the HBeAg decreased 56.9% with S1 and 69.8% with S2. expression of Hsc70 in pU6, S1, S2, siHsc70, and also the heterologous S3 was identified by Western blotting with anti-Hsc70. the reduction of HBsAg expression was used as an internal control. the inhibition of HBVS mRNA by siRNAs at different time points. HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with pU6, S1, S2, siHsc70, and also the heterologous S3. siRNA-mediated silencing of Hsc70 does not affect cell viability. siRNA-mediated silencing of host protein had no significant effect on cellular proliferation. hek293 and hepG2.2.15 cells were respectively transfected with pU6, S1, S2, S3, siHsc70, EGFP-siRNA and the positive-control poly (I:C) the effects of siRNAs on the mRNA concentrations of IFN-, IFN-, and TNF- in transfected cells were negligible or no immunostimulation. HEK293 cells were transfected with pU6, S1, S2, S3, siHsc70, EGFP-siRNA and the positive-control poly (I:C) siRNAs effectively suppressed the expression of fusion EGFP in HEK293 and T98G cells. siEGFP exercised its specific, gene-silencing effect on the EGFP. the expression of EGFP was determined by flow cytometry. this was further confirmed with Western blotting by assessing siEGFP inhibition of the expression of EGFP fusion protein. RT-PCR products confirmed by Melt-curve analysis. the correct transcription of EGFP and S was also demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis. the results suggested that the siRNAs generated by intracellular transcription could effectively and specifically inhibit the expression of HBV. HBsAg and HBeAg can independently and significantly inhibit HBsAg and HBeAg 48 h after transfection. HBsAg was reduced 60.7% by S1 and 72.7% by S2, while the HBeAg decreased 56.9% with S1 and 69.8% with S2, as compared with control. the expression of Hsc70 in hepG2.2.15 cells transfected with siHsc70 or siCtrl after 72 hrs was identified by Western blotting with anti-Hsc70. the reduction of HBsAg expression. HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with pU6, S1, S2, siHsc70, and also the heterologous S3. inhibition of HBVS mRNA by siRNAs at different time points. siRNA-mediated silencing of Hsc70 does not affect cell viability. the siRNAs induced intense IFN- secretion in HEK293 and HepG2.2.15 cells. the impact of siRNAs on IFN-, IFN- and TNF- expression in transfected cells was negligible or no immunostimulation. we found that the siRNAs tested did not induce the innate IFN response whereas the poly (I:C) control was a good stimulator. HEK293 cells were transfected with pU6, S1, S2, S3, siHsc70, EGFP-siRNA and the positive-control poly. mRNA concentrations of IFN-, IFN- and TNF- were examined by RT-PCR amplification with the SYBR RT-PCR Kit. targeting and endogenous Hsc70 genes targeting combination, while Ely et al. [60] reported that they constructed miR expression plasmids and generated cassettes using primiR-31-, pri-miR-30a- and pri-miR-122-derived modules. Molecular chaperones were initially discovered as mediators of the cellular heat shock response [61]. inhibitor for Hsc70 mRNA/protein expression could inhibit HBV/HCV replication efficiently [69,70]. Medications that inhibit Hsc70 expression are effective in suppressing infection by wild-type viral strains and effective against viral strains resistant to lamivudine and suchlike medications. siRNAs directly targeting HBV genes are liable to forfeit their inhibitory efficacy on account of HBV genes mutating under selective pressure. the target site of siHsc70 is on Hsc70, a host protein of remarkable stability, not subject to mutation under normal circumstances. RNAi acts as a natural antiviral defense mechanism in plants. mammalian cells were originally presumed to be unlikely to inherently possess an active RNA-silencing machinery. but primarily to induce a nonspecific interferon-mediated antiviral response mediated by dsRNA, especially by viral long dsRNA. a combinational RNAi approach to treating chronic HBV is worth pursuing in developing new approaches to treat and cure the 400 million people worldwide living with chronic HBV infection. the innovative combinational RNAi approach to treating HBV is fundamentally distinct in that it inhibits viral expression as well as preventing the antiviral compound drug resistance. reducing viral antigen levels attained after combinational RNAi-mediated degradation of viral RNA transcripts may relieve the negative effect of chronic antigen stimulation on T cell response. reduction of viral protein synthesis could be an additional benefit of RNAi-mediated therapy. the antiviral synergy of siHBV in combination with siHsc70 produced no cytotoxicity and induced no production of IFN-, IFN- and TNF- in transfected cells. this approach should prove effective therapy against HBV but clinical application remains to be further tested and examined. the sequence homologous with S1 exhibited two mutant points. the sequence homologous with S2 had only one mutant point, 438nt. the siHsc70 is identical in construction to two shRNA-expressing plasmids. plasmid S2 contains an inverted repeat corresponding to nt 265 to nt 285 of the DNA of HBVS. pS-EGFP-N1 was generated by cloning the DNA of HBV S into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) the correct open reading frames confirmed by sequencing retained the fluorescent properties of the fusion protein. all cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, CA) cells were observed for expression of EGFP on an Olympus BH-2 microscope. they were photographed using a Nikon E950 video camera at a magnification of 10 with an exposure time of 4 s. cells were further subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting. specific silencing of target genes was confirmed by RT-PCR. total RNA was extracted from HepG2.2.15 cells by Qiagen Rneasy Mini Kit.
