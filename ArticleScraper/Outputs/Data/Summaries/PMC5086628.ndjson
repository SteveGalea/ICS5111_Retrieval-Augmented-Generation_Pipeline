{"summary": "a number of life-threatening human diseases are caused by viruses as diverse as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, yellow fever, Zika, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona viruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively) they are taxonomically and genetically distinct but they are all enveloped viruses and therefore possess a lipid bilayer that protects the viral capsid and genetic material that is inside the viral particle. development of vaccines against diseases that appear as outbreaks, such as Ebola and SARS-CoV, is challenging because of lack of infected patient populations necessary for testing efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics. antiretroviral therapy (HAART) consisting of small molecule antiretroviral drugs has improved the lives of patients in some parts of the world. some of the most promising antiviral lectins include griffithsin (GRFT), cyanovirin (CV-N) and banana lectin (BanLec) their use has been mostly suggested as antiviral microbicides, acting as a barrier to prevent transmission of HIV through incorporation into vaginal and rectal gels. GRFT has been expressed recombinantly in different organisms. it is capable of inhibiting cell fusion between chronically infected and uninfected cells. its efficacy as an antiviral agent against other enveloped viruses has also been shown. a large-scale expression system is essential for the development of GRFT. mensional Structure Griffithsin exists as a stable homodimer. each subunit contains 121 amino acids. GRFT folds into a domain-swapped dimer. residues to griffithsin do not affect the folding of the protein but weaken the binding to a mannose column [18]. X represents an unknown amino acid of mass 151.05 present in the natural alga-derived material. each monomer of the domain swapped dimer is colored yellow or blue. nonamannoside (Man9) contains nine mannose residues present in full-length mannonanose-di-(N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) (Man9GlcNAc2) but lacks the core. in that structure, two of the three arms of nonamannoside were bound to two of the three mannose-binding sites. single mutations of any one of the Asp residues weaken affinity of binding to HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. however, the single mutations significantly decrease the potency in inhibition in single round HIV infection and cytopathicity assays. Xue et al. designed a series of mutants where two monomers connected by an amino acid linker were expressed to form an obligate dimer. nonamannoside binding was largely enthalpically driven and entropically unfavorable, indicating the formation of more favorable contacts between the sugar and the protein. a peptide, grifonin-1 (GRFN-1), contained three covalently linked beta sheets and displayed three-fold symmetry [22]. GRFT is an unusually stable protein withstanding extraction procedures used in natural products\u2019 isolation and purification. it was resistant to digestion by eight out of nine different proteases and was degraded only by the metalloprotease elastase [25]. GRFT was not affected under bacterial degradation conditions. GRFT-C37 is a 37-amino acid peptide containing sequences from the C-terminal region of the HIV transmembrane protein gp41. the fusion constructs demonstrated 5\u20138-fold improvements in potency compared to GRFT alone in chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)-tropic or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5)-tropic cell-cell fusion assays. a study examining the stability of antimicrobial peptides showed that GRFT was resistant to digestion by eight out of nine different proteases and was degraded only by the metalloprotease elastase. it has been shown that monomeric GRFT binds with comparable affinity to gp120, yet the IC50 for neutralization is several orders of magnitude weaker than wild-type GRFT [19]. ly-Thr-Gly amino acid linkers showed that two monomeric units were needed to recover the potency of wild-type GRFT. however, no further improvements were observed for tandemers containing a greater number of mGRFT domains. monomeric GRFT and the mGRFT tandemers did not cause virus aggregation. sample a target cell b EC50 (nM) Ref.

GRFT is capable of inhibiting in vitro infection of clade A, B and C viruses, with clade. single-cycle pseudotypes (TZM-bl cell neutralization assays) are generally more sensitive than neutralization in PMBC assays. GRFT is also capable of preventing infection on cervical explants and cell-to-cell transmission on migratory cells. gp120 GRFT has been shown to bind the HIV envelope glycoproteins. binding of the lectin cyanovirin-N (CV-N) to gp120 inhibits subsequent binding of GRFT. this could suggest that GRFT has a smaller recognition epitope compared to CV-N. mAb b12 is a broadly neutralizing antibody whereas mAb b6 is non-neutralizing. deletion of the glycan in position 386 decreases the GRFT-mediated increase in b12 binding. the deletion of the glycan at asparagine (Asn) 386 prevents the synergistic effect. inhibition of DC-SIGN Binding Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells responsible for capture and degradation of pathogens that enter the mucosal environment. DCs migrate to the lymph nodes where the DC-SIGN receptor mediates the transmission to nave uninfected CD4+ T cells. strains lacking the glycan in position 295 showed lower sensitivity to GRFT. strains missing glycans 234 and 295 significantly reduced sensitivity. glycans found to be deleted in resistance studies are colored red. the Morris and Moore laboratories examined the mechanisms of resistance of an HIV-1 subtype C strain to lectins including GRFT. they found that viruses cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of GRFT evolved deletions of several glycans including those in positions 339, 230, 234, 241, 298, 392 and 448. the level of resistance is only 3\u201310 fold compared to the wild type. s 332, 339 and 392, sites that are suggested to be targets of GRFT on the basis of resistance profiles. combinations of GRFT and 2G12 were shown to be synergistic against the soluble version of the CD4 receptor, sCD4 [39]. synergy is more pronounced for some lectin resistant HIV-1 strains [29]. GRFT synergizes with known HIV-1 drugs, including the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir, the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvitride and the specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. these drugs individually, or combined with other anti-HIV drugs, have been shown to have great potential in the development of microbicides. GRFT binds glycans on the surface of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein S. a total of three molecules of GRFT are capable of binding the S in a dose dependent manner with very high affinity. studies on mouse-adapted MA15 SARS-CoV showed that mice that received daily doses of intranasally administered GRFT had 100% survival rate, with no loss in weight. japanese encephalitis virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, similar to dengue, yellow fever and Zika. GRFT can inhibit infection of baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cells with IC50 in the nanomolar range [33], and that such inhibition is due to the interaction between GRFT and the glycosylated viral proteins. GRFT does not block the initial attachment of the virus to the cell. it acts in a late step in the HPV entry process. GRFT decreased HPV 16 pseudovirus (PsV) vaginal infection in a murine model. single-cycle pseudotypes (TZM-bl cell neutralization assays) are generally more sensitive than neutralization in PMBC assays. GRFT is also capable of preventing infection on cervical explants and cell-to-cell transmission on migratory cells from such explants. binding of the lectin cyanovirin-N (CV-N) to gp120 was shown to inhibit subsequent binding of GRFT. a total of 10 GRFT units are capable of binding to a single gp120 glycoprotein. this could suggest that GRFT has a smaller recognition epitope, or lower stoichiometry of binding compared to CV-N. deletion of the glycan in position 386 decreases the GRFT-mediated increase in b12 binding. GRFT inhibits binding to the co-receptor binding site-specific mAb 17b without directly occluding the binding site. DCs migrate to lymph nodes where the DC-SIGN receptor mediates the transmission to nave uninfected CD4+ T cells. GRFT inhibits the binding of DC-SIGN to gp120. glycans at both asn 234 and 295 sites were 20\u2013100 less sensitive to GRFT. however, the absence of one of these glycosylation sites did not affect the sensitivity. the location of glycosylation sites had a clear effect on efficacy. glycans in positions 339, 230, 234, 241, 298, 392 and 448 evolved deletions of several glycans including those in positions 339, 230, 234, 241, 298, 392 and 448. multiple glycosylation site mutations are required for a virus to become resistant to GRFT, and the level of resistance is only 3\u201310 fold compared to the wild type. GRFT synergizes with mAbs b12 and VRC01 in PBMC cultures. GRFT synergizes with the CD4 binding site mAbs b12 and VRC01. GRFT synergizes with the soluble version of the CD4 receptor. p41 fusion inhibitor enfuvitride and the specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 have been shown to have great potential in the development of microbicides. GRFT has been shown to bind the HIV envelope glycoproteins thereby blocking CD4 binding as well as binding of other anti-HIV antibodies. GRFT competes with the glycan-specific antibody 2G12 [36], a mAb that binds the high mannose patch on gp120, but enhances binding of antibodies specific for the CD4 binding site. mAb b12 is a broadly neutralizing antibody whereas mAb b6 is non-neutralizing. Xue et al. showed that all six mannose-binding sites were needed to expose the CD4bs. binding of GRFT to gp120 induces shedding. binding of GRFT to gp120 induces shedding. GRFT is not cytotoxic to DCs and does not trigger DC apoptosis or maturation. binding of gp120 to gp120 inhibits subsequent binding of GRFT. GRFT is not cytotoxic to DCs and does not trigger DC apoptosis. mAb b12 is a broadly neutralizing antibody whereas mAb b6 is non-neutralizing. deletion of the glycan in position 386 decreases the GRFT-mediated increase in b12 binding. mutants lacking mannose-binding sites did not show CD4bs exposure. binding of GRFT to gp120 induces shedding, and this effect is more marked for clade B strains than clade C. glycans missing glycosylation sites at asn 234 and 295 sites were 20\u2013100 less sensitive to GRFT. glycans found to be deleted in resistance studies are colored red. glycans 230, 241 and 298 shown to be deleted in GRFT-resistant strains. other glycans shown to be deleted include glycans 230, 241 and 298. study examined mechanisms of resistance of an HIV-1 subtype C strain to lectins. antibodies The monoclonal antibody 2G12 has been used in several studies because it recognizes a cluster of high mannose glycans. these include glycans at Asn residues 332, 339 and 392, sites that are suggested to be targets of GRFT on the basis of resistance profiles. combinations of GRFT and 2G12 were shown to be synergistic against R5 HIV-1 strain BaL in PBMC cultures. GRFT synergizes with known HIV-1 drugs, including the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir, the CCR5 HIV co-receptor antagonist maraviroc, the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvitride and the specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. these drugs individually, or combined with other anti-HIV drugs, have been shown as promising candidates for microbicide development. GRFT was also found to be synergistic with the soluble version of the CD4 receptor, sCD4 [39]. mannan-binding lectin (MVN), banana lectin (BanLec), hippeastrum hybrid (amaryllis) lectin (HHA) and galanthus nivalis lectin (GNA) also shown to have additive effects with GRFT in cell-to-cell transmission assays. hepatitis C Virus (HCV) GRFT has been shown to inhibit infection of HCV to hepatocytes in vitro as well as cell-to-cell transmission. this has important clinical relevance because following liver transplantation in HCV-infected patients, reinfection of the new liver graft commonly occurs [31,32]. GRFT interacted with the envelope glycoprotein E1E2 and prevented subsequent interaction with one HCV receptor, CD81 [32]. GRFT inhibited different strains of SARS-CoV infection in vero 76 cells with an EC50 in the low nanomolar range. a total of three molecules of GRFT are capable of binding the S in a dose dependent manner with very high affinity. studies on mouse-adapted MA15 SARS-CoV showed that mice that received daily doses of intranasally administered GRFT had 100% survival rate, with no loss in weight, improved lung histopathology scores, mice challenged with lethal doses of JEV showed reduced virus titers in the mouse brain and 100% survival rate compared with a 0% survival rate in the control group [33]. GRFT showed weak-to-moderate activity in blocking HSV-2 entry, yet it was capable of inhibiting cell-to-cell spread with IC50s in the nanomolar range. hepatitis C Virus (GRFT) has been shown to inhibit infection of HCV to hepatocytes in vitro as well as cell-to-cell transmission. GRFT interacted with the envelope glycoprotein E1E2 and prevented subsequent interaction with one HCV receptor, CD81 [31]. ELISA experiments showed that GRFT did not inhibit the binding of E2 to CD81 [32]. GRFT binds glycans on the surface of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein S (S) a total of three molecules of GRFT are capable of binding the S in a dose dependent manner with very high affinity. studies on mouse-adapted MA15 SARS-CoV showed that mice that received daily doses of intranasally administered GRFT had 100% survival rate, with no loss in weight, improved lung histopathology scores, and reduction of lung tissue virus t mice challenged with lethal doses of JEV showed reduced virus titers in the mouse brain and 100% survival rate compared with 0% survival rate in the control group [33]. GRFT showed weak-to-moderate activity in blocking HSV-2 entry, yet it was capable of inhibiting cell-to-cell spread with IC50s in the nanomolar range. GRFT binds to the surface of Trichomonas and Tritrichomonas and causes flagellated trichomonads to undergo self-aggregation and precipitation. this interaction is likely due to the binding of GRFT to unprocessed glycans on the surface of the parasite. in the case of HIV, its most promising application is as a topical microbicide. no loss in cell viability of endocervical and ectocervical cell lines was observed even at doses of 1 mg/mL GRFT. GRFT does not induce cell proliferation in cervicovaginal cell lines in contrast with other lectins that show high cytotoxicity and significant mitogenic activity. preliminary studies where GRFT was administered intranasally showed that the levels of cytokines decreased compared those infected with SARS-CoV alone [30]. subcutaneous injection of GRFT in immunodeficient transgenic mice indicated that the lectin remained bioavailable even after 18 days, with only mild transient alterations in health parameters such as body weight and morbidity scores. fetivity assays demonstrated that the GRFT in sera retains antiviral activity during this time. all animals survived the high dose GRFT treatment, and some accumulation in spleen, kidney and liver was observed. authors were unable to detect anti-GRFT antibodies even in the high dose animals. a growing body of literature has established the potency, broad-spectrum anti-viral activity and safety profile of GRFT supporting its development as a microbicide. a growing body of literature has established the remarkable potency, broad-spectrum anti-viral activity and safety profile of GRFT supporting its development as a microbicide."}
