{"summary": "76 subjects (30\u201370 years of age) were recruited from the general population. subjects were instructed to take one capsule per day of either EAP or a placebo for a period of 8 weeks. results showed that EAP is a useful pharmaceutical and functional food material for preventing and treating colds and flu. influenza A strains have emerged and begun to spread rapidly. there is a growing interest in foods that promote immune functions. food materials may be derived from vegetables [6], seafood [7], mushrooms [8], microbes such as lactic acid bacteria [9], chitosan [10], and peptides [11]. idium pullulans has been studied for -1,3/1,6-glucan [12]. the test food material used in this study contains 13% -1,3/1,6-glucan. a clinical study is now being performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of -glucan from aureobasidium pullulans. the test food was manufactured as maroon-colored hard capsules. each capsule contained 150 mg of EAP and 100.0 mg of microcrystalline cellulose. the placebo food contained 220.0 mg of microcrystalline cellulose. individuals with a body mass index (BMI) under 18 or over 35 were excluded from the experiment. individuals who exceeded the normal maximum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels by 2-fold. females who were pregnant or were breast-feeding; females of childbearing age who did not agree to use contraceptives via medically proven methods. individuals who require continuous treatment for psychiatric disorders. a temporary interruption for the occurrence of an adverse reaction or for the treatment of an adverse reaction was temporarily suspended. however, in the case of a temporary interruption for the occurrence of an adverse reaction, if there was no problem in its compliance, the study was continued. subjects stopped taking test foods and were processed as dropouts. the results of all subjects who dropped out of the study were excluded from assessment of the per protocol (PP) group. subjects maintained regular levels of drinking, diet, and exercise which were similar to levels prior to participation in the experiment. subjects maintained regular levels of drinking, diet, and exercise. randomization and blinding subjects were assigned to the EAP group (the group taking EAP) and the placebo group (the group taking the placebo) based on a random sampling table generated using a random sampling table generated using Microsoft Excel 2010 on Microsoft Windows. subjects selected for the experiment were issued a subject number in order of visits made during visit 2 and were provided with the test foods. contents during the last 3 years were recorded in the medicinal intake history. the types of exercise and the exercise times were examined for 1 week prior to the time of the visitation day. blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse were measured as vital signs. tests were performed using a kit detecting human chorionic gonadotropin. serum concentration of cytokines was analyzed using a semiautomated analyzer. the data were reported as median fluorescent intensities. symptom levels reported by the patients No symptom 0 I did not perceive relevant symptoms Mild 1 I perceived some symptoms, but they did not interfere with my daily life Moderate 2 I perceived symptoms and felt discomfort in my daily life. Statistical analysis for assessing the effectiveness of test foods was based on the Statistical Guidelines for Clinical Trials [28], and the statistical package used was the SAS (version 9.4) on Microsoft Windows. the statistical significance level was set at 5%. independent t-test was performed if over 25% of the cells had an expected frequency of less than 5. fewer subjects will contract viral diseases such as cold and flu if immune functions are enhanced. the duration and levels of symptoms will decrease if one of the diseases is contracted. the test groups in visit 1 evaluated the effectiveness by comparing the results between test groups in visit 3. 2.13.5. the LOCF method is commonly used because it provides conservative results. however, there are no commonly recommended methodologies for processing missing values. subjects took 1 EAP hard capsule once daily for 8 weeks on empty stomach. subjects were healthy adults who did not have any disease that required proactive treatment. the number of subjects assigned to each group was 38 (76 overall) individuals who require continuous treatment for psychiatric disorders such as anorexia, depression, and manic depression. individuals with systemic diseases such as immunity-related diseases, serious hepatic and renal insufficiencies, malignant tumors, pulmonary disease, collagenosis, multiple sclerosis, allergic skin conditions. individuals who participated in a different human study or clinical test and took experimental products within 3 months of participation in the experiment. subjects stopped taking test foods and were processed as dropouts for the following reasons, in which it was not possible to continue the human study. cases in which a serious adverse event occurred with the subject, cases in which an adverse event made participation impossible, or cases in which clinical tests were not possible due to the death of a subject or emergence of a disease. subjects who dropped out of the study were excluded from assessment of the per protocol (PP) group. subjects kept a daily record of whether they consumed the test foods and recorded 3 contiguous days of their diets. subjects had to meet the following criteria: adults between 30 and 70 years of age; individuals with a white blood cell count of 4\u20137 103/L; individuals who could be monitored throughout the test period. individuals with a body mass index (BMI) under 18 or over 35 were excluded from the experiment. individuals with a body mass index (BMI) under 18 or over 35 were excluded from the experiment. individuals with a body mass index (BMI) under 18 or over 35 were excluded from the experiment. temporary suspension for the treatment of adverse events that may have occurred. subjects stopped taking test foods and were processed as dropouts for the following reasons. subjects stopped taking test foods and were processed as dropouts. a serious adverse event occurred with the subject, cases in which an adverse event made participation in the experiment impossible, cases in which the researcher determined that the usage and observation of the test foods would be impertinent. subjects who took the test foods and later dropped out were excluded from assessment of the per protocol (PP) group. subjects kept a daily record of whether they consumed the test foods and recorded 3 contiguous days of their diets, including Saturday or Sunday. exercise, alcoholic drinks, and test food consumption were recorded in a chart provided by the testing agency. the contents during the last 3 years were recorded in the medical histories. the types of exercise and the exercise times were examined for 1 week prior to the time of the visitation day. diet and exercise were compared during the base evaluation period and experimental period. blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse were measured as vital signs. blood pressure, body temperature, waist-hip ratio, and visceral fat area were recorded. blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, trig a form was provided in which subjects made a daily record of their health conditions, with a daily record of their test food dosages. nine symptoms were monitored to inspect the health conditions of the subjects in the survey. subjects marked for \u201csymptoms exist\u201d and for \u201cno symptoms\u201d. compliance with ingesting test foods was evaluated based on the food-usage logs. in cases where there were differences between the recorded and actual amounts of food taken, compliance was verified when the differences were small. Statistical analysis based on the Statistical Guidelines for Clinical Trials. the statistical package used was the SAS (version 9.4) on Microsoft Windows. the statistical significance level was set at 5%. square method was conducted for category variables or fisher's exact test was performed if over 25% of the cells had an expected frequency of less than 5. independent t-test was used to investigate whether weight, obesity, alcoholic drink ingestion, or exercise could have affected the test results. the LOCF method is commonly used because it provides conservative results. the missing values during the final assessment were not replaced by the base assessment values but were substituted by the average of each group. fewer subjects will contract viral diseases such as cold and flu if immune functions are enhanced. the duration and levels of symptoms will decrease if one of the diseases is contracted. a statistical comparison was made between the average variation before and after food ingestions. the LOCF method is commonly used because it provides conservative results. but there are no commonly recommended methodologies for processing missing values. results 3.1. subjects participating in this study screened 117 individuals who voluntarily agreed to participate in this human study. compliance was calculated using the following formula: compliance (%) = (number of food materials ingested/number of food materials that should have been ingested) 100, where the number of food materials ingested = number of food materials provided number of food materials returned. subjects whose compliance was below 80% were set as dropouts. the results of a preliminary investigation on the age, gender, medical history, treatment history, medication history, concomitant medication, exercise, smoking, and drinking among subjects are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. No significant differences were found between the test groups. results of a t-test performed to evaluate significant differences between 2 groups before and after ingesting the test food materials verified that the duration of cold symptoms (p value = 0.5748) and cold symptom levels (p value = 0.2462) at visit 1 were not significant at a significance level of 5%. no difference occurred between test groups prior to the ingestion of food materials.

Abnormal Changes in clinical test results To study abnormal changes in clinical test results, we examined items in which blood biochemical results exceeded the normal range by 2-fold after the ingestion of test food materials. the results demonstrated changes in -GTP values in 1 individual from the placebo group, as well as changes in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), trigly the -GTP value was found to be abnormally high during visit 3 for subject E57. but the results were due to excessive drinking, where the subject consumed alcoholic drinks frequently (5 days/week) and a high quantity of ethanol (average = g/week) no items were found to correlate with the use of test food materials or were suspected to have a correlation. thus, the test foods were found to be safe in the context of this study. the 76 subjects (administrated with the test foods for a period of 8 weeks) were randomly assigned to either EAP or a placebo group. blood tests and surveys of cold or flu symptoms were conducted before and after ingesting test foods. changes in cytokine levels, WBC counts, T cell counts, and NK cell activity in the peripheral blood should be measured when determining immunity reinforcement in humans. no statistically significant differences were found before and after ingestion of test food materials at a significance level of 5%. in this study, the total number of subjects was 72: 36 in the test group and 36 in the control group, respectively. however, the individual deviation range was not statistically significant due to the small number of subjects. further research is needed on extensive clinical studies with clear statistical numberings to confirm the effects of EAP on plasma cytokines. 117 adults aged 30\u201370 years with a white blood cell count of 4\u20137 x 103/l were screened. 76 individuals were enrolled as subjects who satisfied the selection criteria and did not fall under any exclusion criteria. the 76 subjects were randomly assigned to either EAP or a placebo group. clinical data have shown that immunity-promoting functions can prevent acute respiratory infections from cold or influenza viruses. there were no differences in assessment values between the EAP and placebo groups before ingesting test food materials. however, the duration of cold and flu symptoms was significantly lower in the EAP group than in the placebo group at a 5% significance level. results consistent with those of Choi et al. (2009) [14] where the daily intake level of EAP (PolycanTM) or placebo food materials was set at 400 mg. changes in serum cytokines were studied (with the intention of observing effectiveness in immunity improvements of EAP) but no statistically significant changes were found. no significant adverse events occurred during the period of test food material intake. adverse events (excluding colds) were observed in 3 individuals from the placebo group (nausea, pruritus, asthenopia, rash, and sore throat) in 1 individual from the experiment group (headache)"}
