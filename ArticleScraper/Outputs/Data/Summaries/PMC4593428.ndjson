R. felis DNA was detected in 23 (39.7%) of 58 febrile children at this rural location. prevalence during the rainy season was higher than that during the dry season. R. felis DNA was detected in 3 (2.1%) of 141 febrile children in this semiurban location. prevalence during the rainy season was higher than that during the dry season. no afebrile children were enrolled from Koulamoutou. lastourville, Ogoou\u00e9 Lolo Province R. felis DNA was detected in 15 (11.2%) of 134 febrile children in this rural location. the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.05) prevalence among boys (7.6% [6/79]) and girls (16.4% [9/55] did not differ significantly (p = 0.17) the lack of molecular tools in many health centers in sub-saharan africa limits the management of all febrile illnesses in these areas. the lack of molecular tools in many health centers in countries in sub-saharan Africa limits the management of all febrile illnesses in these areas. a sample was not considered R. felis\u2013positive unless confirmed by at least 2 sequences of targeted DNA. the prevalence of R. felis is low in northern africa countries (France, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia) eptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., and S. pneumoniae were previously assessed in Gabon by using standard culture methods (8). but the prevalence of fastidious bacteria, which are detected by using molecular techniques, was not studied. R. felis has been reported to be absent from C. felis fleas in rural areas of Senegal, where R. felis is common. prevalence varies by country: 15.0% in Senegal (14), 3.0% in Mali (14) and 7.2% in Kenya (5). ium falciparum, the primary agent of malaria, is commonly detected in blood specimens from apparently healthy, afebrile persons in sub-Saharan Africa. prevalence can reach 20% in Ethiopia and 32% in Senegal (32,33). more recently in Tanzania, the prevalence of S. pneumoniae DNA was less frequently detected in febrile than afebrile (6.3%) persons. the prevalence of R. felis was significantly higher in febrile (15.0%) than afebrile (4.0%) persons in Senegal (14). in Senegal, an 8-month-old febrile girl was cured of R. felis infection after treatment with doxycycline (36)."}
