{"summary": "swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) is a negative-strand segmented RNA virus. it is responsible for proton conductance vitally important to viral replication. HA is responsible for binding to the surface of the infected cell as a trimer. zanamivir and oseltamivir were designed by modifying the sialic acid structure. the two clinical drugs were once successfully used to inhibit the spread of influenza viral progeny [15] by binding to viral surface glycoprotein of neuraminidase (NA) many years scientific research efforts, so far there is no clinical available inhibitor against HA1. many studies have indicated computational approaches, such as structural bioinformatics [24], [25], molecular docking [26], [27], pharmacophore modeling [28], identification of proteases and their types [29], can timely provide very useful information. the segments of loop1, loop2, loop3, and loop4 play an important role in the interactions with the ligand. the binding pocket is defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom with a distance 5 from the NAG ligand. the motions of such four residues were monitored during the molecular dynamics simulations. ionization at target pH 7.02.0, desalting, retaining chiralities from 3D structure and geometry minimization with the OPLS2005 force field [40] all investigated compounds were docked into the receptor pocket through the rigid docking model with the stand-precision scoring function [41], [42] to estimate the binding affinities. the novel drug design algorithm called \u201cCore Hopping\u201d [33] has the function to perform both the fragment-based replacing and molecular docking the molecular dynamic simulation was performed with GROMACS 96-53a6 force fields [55] with the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) [56] before starting the simulations, all the models were solvated with the explicit simple point charge (SPC) water in a cubic box. the system was neutralized with six chlorine ions to replace the six SPC water molecules. the bind-site encompassed the ligand N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine (NAG) shown in Fig. 1 is a close-up view for the binding site of protein HA1 rendered by the molecular surface. the segments of loop1, loop2, loop3, and loop4 play an important role in the interactions with the ligand. the binding pocket is defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom with a distance 5 from the NAG ligand [37]. the docked poses for ZINC01602230, Neo and Neo6 are shown with the stick model colored in purple, yellow and dark green, respectively. novel drug design algorithm called \u201cCore Hopping\u201d was used in this study. it has the function to perform both the fragment-based replacing and molecular docking. the novel drug design algorithm has the function to perform both the fragment-based replacing and molecular docking. the molecular dynamic simulation was performed with GROMACS 96-53a6 force fields [55] with the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) by using the GROMACS 4.0 package for Linux. the topology files and charges for the ligand atoms were generated by the Dundee PRODRG2.5 Server. the core hopping method was used to search the fragment database for replacing the adenine part. the new structure Neo was discovered that has more strong affinity than ZINC01602230. a series of compound candidates modified from the Neo structure were generated. structures and docking scores list for the top ten compound candidates modified from Neo and ZINC01602230. the results obtained from the docking simulation have proved that the compound binding interactions with residues ARG227 and ASP92 were fully consistent with the previous report. plexed system HA1-Neo6 and the inhibitor-uncomplexed system HA1 respectively. the root mean square deviation (RMSD) from initial conformation is a central criterion. the stability of a simulation system was evaluated based on its RMSD. the drug-like database from ZINC [38] was screened by using Glide5 for its near-optimal performance aimed on targeting the HA1 receptor. the top hit (ZINC01602230) or (2-amino-N-(7H-purin-6-yl) acetamide) was considered as the most potential lead compound for further modification. the new scaffold as a building block was further optimized through the second core hopping process by replacing core3 with various fragments. the best substitute core4 also contains the same glycine as the terminal fragment on the other side of Neo or ZINC01602230. a series of compound candidates modified from the Neo structure were generated. molecular dynamics simulations were performed for the inhibitor-complexed system HA1-Neo6 and the inhibitor-uncomplexed system HA1 respectively. the root mean square deviation (RMSD) from initial conformation is a central criterion used to evaluate the difference of the protein system. the RMSF for side-chain atoms of the Neo6-HA1 system (green) and the HA1 system (red) the curves associated with Loop1, Loop2, Loop3, and Loop4 are colored orange, light blue, dark blue, and maroon. among the series of Neo compound candidates, Neo6 is anticipated to be a promising drug candidate for further experimental investigation."}
