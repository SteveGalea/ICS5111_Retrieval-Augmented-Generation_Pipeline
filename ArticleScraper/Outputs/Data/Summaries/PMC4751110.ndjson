{"summary": "201 rectal swab samples were collected in diarrhoetic dogs from animal hospitals in three districts. of the 201 samples, 141 were collected from 2 animal hospitals in Harbin, 20 from one animal hospital in Daqing and 40 from 1 animal hospital in Mudanjiang. all rectal swab samples were stored at 80\u00b0C. PCR amplifications were conducted in a 50-l reaction volume containing 0.1 M of the forward primer, 0.1 M of the reverse primer, 4 l of cDNA, 25 l of EmeraldAmp PCR Master Mix (2 Premix) the mixtures were amplified by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 sec, 54\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 50 sec. each sample was sequenced three times. all fecal samples that tested positive for CaKV were also screened for canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine norovirus (CNoV), canine bocavirus (CBoV) and group A-Rotavirus (RV-A) by either PCR or RT-PCR, followed by sequencing.

DISCUSSION Kobuvirus is a relatively new and emerging genus of the Picornaviridae, with members infecting both humans and other animal species. in our study, 36 of 201 (17.91%) fecal samples from diarrhoetic dogs were positive for CaKV. a low prevalence of CaKV was reported by RT-PCR in the U.S. and Italy. Di Martino et al. reported that 4.37% (6/137) of diarrhoetic dogs tested positive for CaKV. in contrast, a high prevalence of CaKV was reported in recent studies. CCoV was the only enteric virus identified in eight specimens, accounting for 22.22% (8/36) of all CaKV-positive samples. the high co-infection rate of CaKV with other enteric viruses should be considered to be a composite factor for the occurrence of viral diarrhea. our data suggest that the lineages of CaKV strains may exhibit geographically differences. this conclusion needs to be validated by extensive epidemiological surveying in future studies."}
