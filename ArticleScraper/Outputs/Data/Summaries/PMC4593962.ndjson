{"summary": "soluble proteins were purified by IMAC and size exclusion chromatography. the protein was eluted by increasing concentration of imidazole. a single band was observed on SDS-PAGE for both the purified proteins. inactive and (B) active CVCP shows the protein purified to homogeneity. lane 1, molecular-weight markers (kDa); lane 2, pellet containing insoluble protein fraction; lane 3, supernatant containing soluble protein fraction; lane 4\u20136, purified CVCP. the substrate was added to start the reaction and the fluorescence enhancement was recorded with time. the relative fluorescence units were calculated for all the readings. a control reaction was also performed using the same reaction without enzyme, which did not show change in fluorescence intensity. the fluorescence extinction coefficient (FEC) was calculated to be 35,215 RFU/M. the kinetic parameters Km and kcat/Km were calculated as 1.26 0.34 M and 1.11 103 M1 sec1 respectively. the inactive CVCP was used as a negative control in proteolytic activity assay. Z\u2019 factor and the CV reveal the reliability of the present FRET based assay in HTS of inhibitors against CVCP. 24 samples were used for computing the means and standard deviation. negative control with TPCK showed expected inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin with the inhibition constant, Ki = 16.5 M. effect of pH and NaCl on the enzymatic activity of CVCP was observed. all the readings are the average of the triplicate data obtained from the reaction containing no enzyme. the effect of anti-chaotropic agent glycerol on the enzyme activity is also observed. at 10% glycerol, negligible increase in the activity is found. however further increase in the glycerol concentrations result in the decrease of enzymatic activity and at 50% glycerol concentration, almost no activity is detected. glycerol (blue) in the CVCP structure binds incisively at the position where conserved P1 residue Trp (red) binds in AVCP. the active site is shown in blue color. gel filtration chromatography confirms both active and inactive CVCP exist as monomer in solution. both (A) inactive and (B) active CVCP shows the protein purified to homogeneity. the proteolytic reaction was carried out in 20 mM HEPES buffer. the substrate was added to start the reaction and the fluorescence enhancement was recorded with time. a control reaction was also performed using the same reaction without enzyme, which did not show change in the fluorescence intensity. the lineweaver-burk plot was formed and the intercept and slope were calculated according to the equation y = mx + c. from these, the values of Vmax and Km were determined and the kcat was also calculated by dividing Vmax with the enzyme concentration. the fluorescence extinction coefficient (FEC) was calculated to be 35,215 RFU/M for the FRET substrate. the value of Z\u2019 factor suggests high quality of the assay with high signal to noise ratio. the degree of variability is 8.68% in the positive control group. the proteolytic inhibitory assay was tested using TPCK and chymotrypsin. the positive control with TPCK showed expected inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin with the inhibition constant, Ki = 16.5 M. the relative activity was calculated by taking the activity at pH 7.0 as 100%. the activity at NaCl concentration of 100 mM was taken as 100%. the relative activity for other NaCl concentrations was calculated. active site is present at the interface of these two subdomains. the S1 specificity pocket is present in the vicinity of the active site. glycerol (blue) in the CVCP structure binds at the position where conserved P1 residue Trp (red) binds in AVCP. the active site is shown in blue color. Discussion Chikungunya cases have increased drastically in last few years. CHIKV encourages the development of new promising antivirals and therapeutics against CHIKV. our experiments show the presence of CVCP as a monomer for both active and inactive CVCP in solution. the Z\u2019 factor and the coefficient of variation were determined in a 96 well plate and found to be 0.64 and 8.68% respectively. the assay can be easily performed in a 96- and 384- well plate format for high throughput inhibitor screening against the CVCP. the optimum enzyme activity was found at pH 7.0 and 100 mM NaCl concentration. the effect of pH on the enzyme activity might be due to the stabilization of the enzyme with increasing ionic strength. however, the decrease in activity above 100 mM NaCl might be the result of alteration in molecular interaction at the active site. glycerol acts as the stabilizing agent for the protein and is not expected to reduce the enzymatic activity. at 50% concentration of the glycerol in the reaction buffer, there is complete loss of the CVCP enzymatic activity. it might be due to the binding of glycerol molecule in the S1 specificity pocket of CVCP that could block entry of the substrate inside the pocket. glycerol was used as a cryoprotectant during data collection. it was assumed to stabilize the protein by binding to the S1 pocket39. at high concentrations glycerol might be competing with the substrate peptide for binding to the S1 specificity pocket of CVCP. gentamicin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1.1 g/L sodium bicarbonate were grown at 90% confluency. the virus was allowed to adsorb to the cells for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in serum-free medium. after adsorption, the inoculum was removed by washing once with Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) the oligonucleotides F1 and R1 were used for the amplification of structural polyprotein. the amplified product was purified using the synthesized cDNA as a template. the pET28c vector was digested using the same NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes. amplification of CVCP was carried out using oligonucleotides: F3 and R3 for inactive CVCP, and F3 and R4 for active CVCP having NdeI and XhoI sites. positive clones were identified by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion of isolated plasmids. cultures were grown in 2 L conical flasks at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. for inactive CVCP, secondary culture was grown till the OD at 600 nm (OD600) reaches 0.8. after induction, culture was grown at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. pure protein fractions eluted from affinity chromatography column were pooled. his-tag was cleaved by overnight incubation of purified proteins with TEV protease during dialysis against the dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 20 mM NaCl) fluorogenic peptide substrate was designed for in vitro trans-proteolytic activity of the CVCP. the custom synthesized peptide DABCYL-GAEEWSLAIE-EDANS was used as a substrate (Biolinkk, New Delhi, India) fluorescence readings due to cleavage of peptide substrate led to dissociation of FRET pair and decrease in energy transfer was observed with time. a reaction volume of 100 L was used for conducting 96-well microplate assays. the slope of the curve was calculated which is assigned as the FEC for the substrate peptide. the initial reaction rate was determined by monitoring the change in the RFU over time. the reaction was carried out using the same protocol but no enzyme. peptides (EW and EWS) were tested against CVCP protease. the stock solutions of 10 mM were made in 100% DMSO. the required final concentrations of inhibitors were made by dilution in assay buffer. the influence of varying concentrations of NaCl and glycerol on the proteolytic activity of CVCP was analyzed by performing the reaction in varying concentrations of NaCl and glycerol. the initial velocity for the enzyme was calculated in all different conditions. all the experiments to determine the optimal assay conditions for CVCP activity were performed in triplicate. the cells were cultured in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 80 U gentamicin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1.1 g/L sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) the virus was allowed to adsorb to the cells for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. first strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)30 primer with M-MulV reverse transcriptase at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. oligonucleotides F1 and R1 were used for the amplification of structural polyprotein.
