{"summary": "influenza and other acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the most common human diseases. up to 90% of the population suffer from one of these infections at least once a year. ARIs are caused by viral or bacterial pathogens and can result in hospitalization and death. emergence of drug-resistant influenza variants has led to a decline in efficacy. oligoribonucleotides-D-mannitol complexes (total yeast RNA modified with D-mannitol) possess an antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effect. oligoribonucleotides-D-mannitol complexes (total yeast RNA modified with D-mannitol) possess an antiviral, anti an antiviral efficiency of ORNs-D-M drug against different strains of the influenza viruses and PIV3 and the clinical efficiency of ORNs-D-M in patients with ARI of various etiologies. the HEp2 cells were cultured in 96-well plates to a monolayer state. ORNs-D-M capsule and injectable forms had the same concentration of ORNs-D-M. the HEp2 cells were infected with the PIV3 (3 lgID50) each removed medium was diluted from 10\u00b0 to 107 and 100 L/well of the diluted medium was added in 96-well plate with a monolayer of the HEp2 cells. after infectivity of the PIV3 was determined by a hemadsorption assay. each concentration of the compounds was tested in triplicate. study of anti-neuraminidase activity of compounds was conducted by measurement of activity of neuraminidase in the reaction with fluorogenic substrate [36]. the 25 L of both forms of ORNs-D-M at concentrations of 10.0, 3.2, 1.0, and 0.1 M and the 25 L of virus (5) that were diluted in assay buffer were mixed in 96-well plate. all the patients were divided into the two groups. the first group (main group) consisted of 54 individuals who took ORNs-D-M complex therapy. the second group (control group) of 54 patients received standard treatment (Arbidol as etiotropical drug) the treatment effectiveness was determined due to clinical data and results of PCR. a two-way analysis of Student\u2019s t-test, Spearman rank correlation analyses, Mann\u2013Whitney\u2013Wilcoxon and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used. influenza virus A/California/07/2009(H1N1)pdm09 (CA709), avian influenza virus A/mallard/Pennsylvania/10218/84 (H5N2), and PIV3 were obtained from National Virus Collection of the D.I. Ivanovsky Institute of Virology of the Russian Academy of Medical Science (RAMS) one-hundred and eight patients of young and middle age with influenza and others hemadsorption HEp2 cells were infected with the PIV3 (3 lgID50) hemadsorption HEp2 cells were infected with the virus. hemadsorption HEp2 cells were infected with the virus. the infectious titer was expressed as the number of the highest dilution factor that produced HEp2 cells hemadsorption activity reading. the compounds in appropriate concentrations were dissolved in MEM with 1 g/mL trypsin and incubated with appropriate viruses for 1 h. each concentration of the compounds was tested in triplicate. the 25 L of both forms of ORNs-D-M at concentrations of 10.0, 3.2, 1.0, and 0.1 M and the 25 L of virus (5) that were diluted in assay buffer were mixed in 96-well plate. after, the plate with ORNs-D-M and virus was incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. after, the plate was incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. the criteria of patients\u2019 inclusion in the study were patients with influenza and other ARIs, from 18 to 70 years old and both sexes. the exclusion criteria were children under 18 and adults under 70 years old, presence of severe concomitant diseases, that could affect the course of the disease. I. Ya. Horbachevsky Ternopil State Medical University, Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine (MH of Ukraine) it was approved by the expert problematic commission of MH and National Academy Medical Sciences (NAMS) of Ukraine. the bioethics Commission did not detect the moral and ethical norms violations during the study. the control was infected cells without any drug. all forms of the experiment were performed three times. the medium was removed from the experimental wells. ORNs-D-M Antiviral Activity against pandemic Influenza CA709 and AIV in Vitro The compounds in appropriate concentrations were dissolved in MEM with 1 g/mL trypsin and incubated with appropriate viruses for 1 h. each concentration of the compounds was tested in triplicate. virus (5) were diluted in assay buffer (32.5 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0), 4 mM CaCl2) were mixed in 96-well plate. the plate was incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. 0.2 mM substrate solution (4-methylumbelliferyl--D-N-acetylneuraminic acid) was added to the wells. the exclusion criteria were children under 18 and adults under 70 years old, presence of severe concomitant diseases, that could affect the course of the disease. a sharp increase in body temperature to 39\u201341 \u00b0, clinically evident intoxication, severe myalgia, significant general weakness, and pneumonia pointed at a severe disease. the bioethics Commission of the I. Ya. Horbachevsky Ternopil State Medical University did not detect the moral and ethical norms violations during the study. ORNs-D-M medicine was registered in Ukraine and introduced into clinical practice (single-blind study), decree of MH of Ukraine no 752/30.04.2010. the percentage of hemadsorbtion cells ranged from 18.5% to 25% respectively. hemadsorption activity of cells was reduced by 56.2% and 60.0% respectively. both 1.7 and 0.5 mg/mL of ORNs-D-M injection form reduced infectious titer of PIV3 by 3 IgID50 compared with the control. effects of ORNs-D-M at different concentrations on infectivity of pandemic influenza CA709 and AIV proved that the drug inhibited infectivity of these viruses on the E\u04402 cells. the effective dose of the drug against the pandemic influenza CA709 was 0.5 mg/mL at selectivity index >10, and the acceptable concentration was 5.0 mg/mL. at concentration of 1.5 mg/mL, the effect remained within one logarithm. the drug had a positive effect at a concentration of 10 M. the rate of NA action was 83%. it lasted in average 1.8 0.2 days in the main group and 2.6. increased body temperature was observed only during the first two days in 85.1 4.8% patients of the main group, it was longer only in 14.9 4.8% persons. short-term hyperthermia was recorded only in 51.8 6.8% of patients. in 48.2 6.9% of them it lasted for three days or longer (p 0.001) the influence of different treatment on duration of the disease main manifestations was studied in dependence of pneumonia presence in the patients. the influence of different treatment on duration of the disease main manifestations was studied in dependence of pneumonia presence in the patients. in early convalescence, pathogens were found again only in 3 (7.5%) of these patients of the main group. in 22 (57.9%) of 38 patients of the control group (8 detected) the results of PCR in early convalescence were negative. the virus was found more rarely in patients with ARI (influenza A virus, PIV, AdV, RSV) before and after treatment according to PCR. the percentage of hemadsorption cells was from 6.2% to 20% after 72 h incubation with the PIV3 and the injection form of ORNs-D-M at concentrations from 5.0 to 0.5 mg/mL. hemadsorption activity of cells was reduced by 56.2% and 60.0% respectively. both 1.7 and 0.5 mg/mL of ORNs-D-M injection form reduced the infectious titer of PIV3 by 3 IgID50 compared with the control. the effective dose of the drug against the pandemic virus CA709 was 0.5 mg/mL at selectivity index >10. at 1.5 mg/mL, the inhibition of the virus strain was less effective by one-and-a-half logarithms. the drug concentration of less than 0.17 mg/mL had no anti-influenza effect. a new tab Level of the NA activity of influenza virus A/PuertoRico/08/1934(H1N1 under influence of the injection and capsule forms of oligoribonucleotides-D-mannitol complexes. a complex treatment with ORNs-D-M of the main group of patients had a positive effect on the course of the disease, it accelerated patients\u2019 recovery. increased body temperature was observed only during the first two days in 85.1 4.8% patients in the control group, short-term hyperthermia was recorded only in 51.8 6.8% of patients. in 48.2 6.9% of them it lasted for three days or longer. etiological factor influence on duration of febrile period within the adapted treatment was not established. n = 26 Severe, n = 28 Moderate, n = 33 Severe, n = 21 Fever 1.9 0.1 2.9 0.2 *** 2.4 0.2 * 3.4 0.2 **,*** Intoxication 1.8 0.2 2.6 0.2 *** 2.6 0.2 * 3.9 0.5 **,*** Catarrhal 2.9 0.3 4.4 0.5 *** 4.4 0.3 * 8.6 0.9 **,*** Duration of hospitalization 7.8 0.3 9.4 57.9% of 38 patients of the control group (p 0.001) were treated with ARI (influenza A virus, PIV, AdV, RSV) due to pneumonia presence. the virus was found more rarely in patients with ARI (influenza A virus, PIV, AdV, RSV) before and after treatment according to PCR. oligoribonucleotides-D-mannitol (ORNs-D-M) complexes have a wide range of biological activities and can be used in antiviral treatment. ORNs-D-M at concentration of 5.0 mg/mL have antiviral activity against the AIV, selectivity index >3. previously, we proved that ORNs-D-M has specific antiviral effect due to its ability to inhibit the NA action of the influenza virus (FM147) in vitro. treatment with ORNs-D-M caused eradication of the influenza A virus, AdVviruses in patients with the influenza and other ARIs. results show that ORNs-D-M has antiviral activity against a wide range spectrum of respiratory viruses."}
