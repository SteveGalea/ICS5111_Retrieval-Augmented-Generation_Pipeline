{"summary": "results Enrichment analysis of reference viruses with two hybridization probe sets improve overall rate of virus detection and the percent targeted viral reads (PTRs) per sample by NGS. virus-specific probe pool improved detection of target virus for all of the reference virus NAs tested when compared to their unenriched matches. a total of 48 of 52 target viruses were detected in the enriched samples. the majority of viruses were difficult to confirm in the unenriched match. HBoV1 was less efficient (10% PTRs) four viruses\u2014BK polyomavirus (BKV), mammalian orthoreovirus type 1 (Reo T1), epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and Great Island virus (GIV)\u2014were not enriched. improvement on sensitivity and viral genome coverage An important consideration for the viral genome. we compared the highest sample Ct value with positive targeted viral reads and linear genome coverage before and after enrichment by the virus-specific probe set on viruses at various viral loads. the resulting viral Ct ranged from 22.1 to >38. samples with a low number of viral reads labeled as negative. the endpoint of detection was the highest sample Ct with positive targeted viral reads. improvement in endpoint detection was described as the log difference between the two. linear genome coverage decreased relative to reduced viral loads. enriched samples increased 184-fold over unenriched samples. compared to unenriched samples, we measured fold change in coverage. many viruses were nearly undetectable in the unenriched specimens. all samples had 1% PTRs and 10 samples had 100 targeted viral reads. frequency of reads identified by Kraken for each sample with and without enrichment is shown in bar graphs. virus-specific probe enrichment leads to a median 2308-fold increase in PTRs above unenriched (range of 0- to 136,310-fold) of the 22 sample libraries tested for enrichment with virus-specific probes. we identified 11 samples with >80% PTRs, eight samples with 50%\u201380% PTRs, one sample with 50% PTRs, and two samples with rhinoviruses. genome coverage was not affected in the mixed samples, and 95%\u2013100% genome coverage was obtained for both viruses in both samples. a median increase in PTRs of 15,252-fold above unenriched samples. for unenriched samples, 29 of 33 contain 1% PTRs. viral Ct values ranged from about 21 to 33, depending on the available reference virus NA stock. most Ct values ranged from about 21 to 33, depending on the available reference virus NA stock. the virus-specific probe pool improved detection of target virus for all of the reference virus NAs tested when compared to their unenriched matches. each sample with and without enrichment is shown in bar graphs for each viral family/subfamily tested: (A) Coronavirinae; (B) Adenoviridae; (C) Parvovirinae; (D) Picornaviridae; (E) Paramyxoviridae; (F) Pneumoviridae; (G) Orthomyxoviridae. the same set of 25 out of 26 reference virus sequencing libraries described above was also used to is virus (IBV), canine parainfluenza virus 2 (CPIV2), simian virus 41 (SV41), canine distemper virus (CDV), Bunyip Creek virus (BCV) and several avian influenza viruses were not enriched. the frequency of sequence reads for reference samples enriched with conserved viral group probes is shown in bar graphs. e, and Orthomyxoviridae families/subfamilies are OC43, AdV E4, RSV A2, and influenza A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2). the resulting viral Ct ranged from 22.1 to >38. OC43 was detected from pre-enrichment samples at Ct 24.1. from post-enrichment samples, we detected the virus at Ct 36. with conserved viral group probe enrichment, at least 3-log improvement was achieved for AdV E4 (Ct 33), RSV A2 (Ct 39), and influenza A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2) (Ct 39) we obtained near full genome coverage for OC43, RSV A2, and AdV E4 viruses at their top two viral loads tested (around Ct 30) and for influenza A Sydney/05/97 (H3N2) at its top three viral loads tested (around Ct 36) this genome sequence information allowed us to confirm the individual virus identity. virus-specific probe enrichment leads to a median 2308-fold increase in PTRs above unenriched. abbreviations of virus names are listed in Supplemental Table S1. of the 22 sample libraries tested for enrichment with virus-specific probes, we identified 11 samples with >80% PTRs, eight samples with 50%\u201380% PTRs, and two samples with rhinoviruses A62 and C6 that failed to enrich efficiently. we also observed an overall improvement on average depth of coverage for all of the clinical samples after enrichment as well as on linear genome coverage (>50%) for all clinical samples except the HRV B14 sample that was less efficiently enriched. 29 of 33 samples contain 1% PTRs. 23 of 33 contain fewer than 100 total viral reads. dramatic improvements in detection for coronaviruses OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and camel CoV. virus-specific probe enrichment significantly improves linear genome coverage and sequencing depth in viruses with Ct values in the high 20s into the 30s. the increased depth of coverage over a full or nearly full genome makes virus classification more accurate. conserved viral group probes are capable of detecting divergent and potentially unknown viruses. their design focuses on conserved regions of the viral genome within a viral family, subfamily, or genus. they will allow for enrichment of a more diverse collection of viruses. the complementary pair of respiratory probe panels are able to enrich full genomes of commonly known respiratory viruses and enrich key signatures of divergent or novel viruses simultaneously. the use of commercially available reagents and an easy-to-follow protocol makes this method easily adaptable in a variety of laboratory settings, and it may be easily automated for a high-throughput setting. reference viruses that match the viruses used for virus-specific probe design were selected. for influenza A virus, we included both B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lines. NAs were extracted using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit. reference viral NAs and human RNA were added to a549 cellular RNA. the final concentration of the mixed RNA was 10 ng/L, with RNase P Ct of around 28. the only available reference virus had a viral Ct higher than 25. conserved oligonucleotides were synthesized and pooled together in a cocktail. a total of 346 conserved probes for this respiratory viral panel were generated. a final cocktail of 5361 80-mer oligonucleotides was generated. libraries were prepared in parallel with individual indices for hybridization enrichment. cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase. coding exome capture oligonucleotides were replaced with conserved probes. trimmed reads were mapped to chosen references using Bowtie 2 2.2.9 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) and BWA-MEM (Li and Durbin 2009) targeted viral reads and total nontarget reads are depicted in results. for influenza A virus, we included both B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages. RNA was extracted from the human lung carcinoma cell line A549 (ATCC CCL-185) using TRIzol LS. real-time PCR RT-PCRs were performed using either AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in some cases, we obtained the Ct of the sample from another lab when available. conserved enrichment probe cocktail includes probes for members of Adenoviridae (38), Coronavirinae (45), Orthomyxoviridae (31), Paramyxoviridae (47), Paramyxoviridae (47), Parvovirinae (38), Picornaviridae (54), Pneumoviridae (36), Polyomaviridae (36), and Reoviridae (48). conserved probes, 1.2 pmol probe/200 ng library were used. multiplexing varied from four to eight libraries per hybridization. hybridization with both conserved and virus-specific probes increased from 10 cycles to 17\u201322 cycles. the samples with targeted viral reads 0.01% of the highest number of reads obtained for any sample of the same virus in the same MiSeq run were called negative. data access The sequence data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI BioProject database."}
