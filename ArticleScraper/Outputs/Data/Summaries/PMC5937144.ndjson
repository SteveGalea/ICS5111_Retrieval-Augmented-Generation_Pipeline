{"summary": "many envelope viruses are structurally comprised of similar components (3). the interior of the virus contains RNA/DNA, nucleoproteins, and polymerases required for replication inside the host cell. class I viral fusion proteins are transmembrane homotrimers that are formed as a single chain and later cleaved into three sets of two domains. one of these trimeric domains is typically responsible for host cell recognition and specificity. the other is responsible for mechanically fusing the viral and host lipid membranes (12) molecular dynamics simulations elucidate broad features of how several class I fusion proteins transition from their prefusion to postfusion configurations. obtaining thermodynamic sampling of the full viral-mediated membrane fusion is currently not computationally feasible with detailed fully atomistic simulations. kinases (29), molecular motors (30, 31), and the ribosome (32, 33) we construct a potential that contains both the prefusion and postfusion structures as explicit energy minima. the postfusion structures are naturally lower in energy than the prefusion because they are better packed and have a larger number of native contacts. prefusion and postfusion crystal structures were taken from protein data bank IDs 2HMG/1QU1 (17, 36), 3BT6/4NKJ (37, 38), 4GIP/1ZTM (39, 40), and 4JHW/3RRR (41, 42) for influenza A hemagglutinin (HA), influenza B HA, PIV F, and RSV F. S2 (blue) marks a loop-to-helix region that inverts to become a turn in the postfusion structure. S5 (orange) is the C-terminal domain that is attached to the viral transmembrane peptides. in a dual-basin SBM, every interaction stabilizes one of the native folded states. Native contacts are defined using the Shadow Algorithm (47) with a 1.2 nm cutoff. the contact maps are symmetrized so that each monomer in a given protein trimer has the same set of native contacts. a planar harmonic restraint is placed on the C-terminal atoms in each monomer. fusion between the virus and host should not contain significant unfolded content under physiological transition conditions. 80% of the melting temperature of the postfusion state is a reasonable choice that satisfies these biological constraints. we performed 100 kinetic simulations for each of HA A/B, PIV F, and RSV F. fusion peptides are refolded into the postfusion structure. fusion peptides are refolded into the postfusion structure. fusion peptides are refolded into the postfusion structure. fusion peptides are refolded into the postfusion structure. the fraction of native contacts Q has been shown to be a powerful reaction coordinate that can clearly distinguish between transition state ensembles and reaction endpoints (50) in traditional protein-folding studies, the fraction of native contacts Q has been shown to be a powerful reaction coordinate that can clearly distinguish between transition state ensembles. n s i t i o n = 1, respectively, and n s i t i o n = 1, respectively. n-terminal domains S1 and S2 lose their prefusion interface contacts with the rest of the protein. loss of these contacts pulls S1 and S2 away from the center. Q t r a n s i t i o n = a Q p o s t f u s i o n = a Q p o s t f u s i o n = a Q p o s t f u s i o n = a Q p o s t f u s i the transition pathway for class I fusion proteins proceeds through a set of structured intermediates in which the full postfusion central coiled-coil ( S 1 - S 3 p o s t f u s i o n ) is formed first and the C-terminal loops ( S 5 p o s t f u s i o n ) later fill in the grooves of this coiled-coil to bring the some backtracking may be required if too much of the coiled-coil forms early relative to S5 refolding. the influenza proteins show a broader spread in S2 native contact formation than paramyxovirus. the two influenza proteins have a broader range of helical content transiently forming and unforming than the paramyxovirus proteins. the RSV distribution peaks around a noticeably higher Q ( S 2 C o i l e d C o i l ) value than the other proteins studied. S3 is chosen as the region to calculate this rotation angle with respect to the viral membrane. it is the only domain which stays fully folded throughout the entire transition. it is the only region for which the prefusion and postfusion structures are identical. separation grows rapidly before S3 significantly changes orientation. this is followed by a gradual rotation in the conserved domain S3. the remaining domains remain unstructured and contain little native content from either the prefusion or postfusion crystal structure. transition mechanism between prefusion and postfusion structures conserved across proteins. fusion peptides, hydrophobic regions that attach to the host membrane, are connected to the N-termini of S1. fusion peptides, hydrophobic regions that attach to the host membrane, are connected to the N-termini of S1. we define the fraction of native contacts Q of each subdomain S1\u2013S5 for both configurations of each protein, Q S 1 Q S 5 ( p r e f u s i o n ) and Q S 1 Q S 5 ( p o s t f u s i o n. 1, S2, S4 and S5 are relatively disordered and contain no significant structure compared to either endpoint state. only the conserved domain S3 remains folded, allowing the rest of the protein to begin refolding around it. on average, S1, S2, and S5 still have a low fraction of native contacts formed. the overall order of events is qualitatively preserved. S1\u2013S2 lose their prefusion contacts, many of which are interface contacts with S3. this corresponds with the release of the fusion peptides attached to the N-terminal of S1. coiled-coil fluctuates around an ensemble of structures with a low fraction of helical contacts until there are sufficient C-terminal interactions to lock the helical bundle in place. the probability distributions show that all four proteins have similar features under these coordinates. influenza proteins show a broader spread in S2 native contact formation than either paramyxovirus. the loop-helix region S2 has no long-lived three-helical bundle structure. this suggests that a more fluid unfolding/refolding is occurring for their S2 domains. we restrain the C-termini of each protein to a plane by a harmonic potential. each molecule must undergo some rotation about its center of mass as it proceeds through the conformational transition. the black contour shows the highest probability value of R N C for each S 3. the N- and C-terminal separation becomes maximal before S3 rotates significantly, corresponding to the fusion peptides projecting away from the viral membrane. the value of S 3 before N- and C-terminal apposition can occur is always roughly S 3 90 \u00b0, with the exception of influenza B, in which it is 60 \u00b0. this is likely to be an artifact of these missing residues. the conserved core of the protein begins a gradual rotation toward the viral membrane. this diffusive rotational search provides a crucial separation in timescales between fusion peptide release and eventual nucleation of the central postfusion coiled-coil. the protein reaches an activated state in which the C-terminal domains quickly nucleate formation of the coiled-coil. this nucleation zips the N- and C-termini and their attached membranes together, completing the conformational transition. the loop-helix transition occurs very early in the fusion process and remains stable indefinitely as the C-terminal domains slowly refold around a rigid rod. interactions between the C-terminal domain (S5) and loop-to-helix region (S2) have already been shown to successfully inhibit HA-mediated fusion (54). a caveat to the ensembles resulting from these simulations is that they result from transitions in which we have neglected the presence of any host cell. if the rotation activation criterion gets satisfied but no fusion peptide has come in contact with the host, the C-terminal domains should still nucleate the coiled-coil and conclude the transition. this implies a final configuration in which the protein has adopted its postfusion structure but is inverted with respect to its initial orientation on the viral surface. this appears to be the dominant configuration that our model predicts in the absence of a host bilayer. author contributions N.R.E. and J.N.O. designed research.
