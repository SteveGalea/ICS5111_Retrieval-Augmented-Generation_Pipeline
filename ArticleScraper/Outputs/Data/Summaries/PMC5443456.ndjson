{"summary": "the porcine DPP4 is identical to the dromedary camel DPP4 at the 14 aa positions that have been shown to determine species tropism. we investigated whether DPP4 is expressed in the pig respiratory tract by performing immunohistochemical staining on the nasal mucosa and lung tissue obtained from healthy pigs. l peptidase 4 expression was absent in the nasal mucosa (A) but present in lung tissue (B) of healthy domestic pigs. animal experiments approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. we collected nose and throat swabs during clinical exams and analyzed them for the presence of viral RNA by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) as described (10). shedding of viral RNA from the nose and the throat increased from 1 day postinoculation (dpi) to 3 dpi in all MERS-CoV\u2013inoculated animals. titers are plotted as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution positive by ELISA. euthanized 4 MERS-CoV\u2013inoculated pigs and collected their tissues for virologic and histologic analysis. histologic analysis did not reveal any lesions consistent with MERS-CoV infection in any of the collected tissues, including those of the respiratory tract. serum samples collected on the day of euthanasia were tested for the presence of antibodies against MERS-CoV spike protein 1 (S1) by ELISA. by 11 dpi, antibodies directed against MERS-CoV S1 could be detected in all 4 pigs. viral shedding from mucosal membranes of upper respiratory tract was limited. pig is not a suitable animal disease model for MERS-CoV infection."}
