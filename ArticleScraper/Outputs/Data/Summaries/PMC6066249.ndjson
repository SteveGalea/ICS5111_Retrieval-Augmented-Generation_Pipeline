{"summary": "the country conducts sentinel surveillance to monitor SARI activity and changes in its infectious etiology. the study characterizes the epidemiology of SARI in Georgia over the 2015/16 and 2016/17 influenza seasons. more cases occurred in February (28.7%; 466/1624) than other months. the haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine have led to declines in fatal outcomes due to lower respiratory infections. however, SARI is associated with a large number of different viral and bacterial agents, including influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), adenoviruses, and rhinoviruses. the study aims to characterize the seasonality and epidemiology of influenza in the country of Georgia over two influenza seasons. it aims to describe the etiological and clinical patterns observed, and to assess seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness using a case-test negative design. single pharyngeal and nasal swabs were inserted into the same 2 ml cryovial containing viral transport medium. the swabs were expressed on the side of the cryovials and broken off into the cryovials. the specimens were stored in an indexed cryovial box inside a cooler of wet ice. the CFX96TM Real-time PCR System was used for multi-pathogen detection in one clinical sample. to identify A/H3 virus, we used a real-time RT-PCR Influenza A subtyping kit donated by the CDC. sentinel-based SARI surveillance network collects epidemiologic, clinical and virologic data on patients present with SARI at five clinical inpatient sites. one site is located in Tbilisi, the country\u2019s capital which is in the eastern region of the country. the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used for viral RNA and DNA extraction. samples were lysed under highly denaturing conditions to inactivate RNases. alcohol was added and lysates loaded onto the QIAamp spin column. used a real-time RT-PCR Influenza A subtyping kit donated by the. CDC. more SARI cases were 1 year (22%; 356/1624) or 1\u20134 years of age (28%; 449/1624) than in other age groups. more cases were male (54%; 877/1624) than female. 3% (52/1624) were pregnant women. most common is cardiovascular disease (10%; 158/1624), diabetes (4%; 68/1624), respiratory disease (4%; 66/1624), and neurological disease (4%; 61/1624). 2% 0% 6% 13% 3% 5% 19% 65 years 150 (9%) 10% 16% 5% 11% 4% 5% 5% 5% 0% 2% 3% 2% 3% 14% Sex Male 877 (54%) 58% 47% 45% 54% 59% 60% 59% 54% 33% 61% 45% 56% 55% 53% Female 743 (46%) 42% 53% 56% 56% 37% 40% 41% 45% 67% 38% 55% 44% 44% 4 0% 2% Liver disease 31 (2%) 3% 1% 4% 3% 1% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% the most common pathogens characterized by co-infection were: RSV (39%, 87/222), rhinovirus (38%; 84/222), and influenza (20%; 44/222) among the co-infected children 4 years 31% (69/222) were hospitalized in the ICU, compared to 37% (606/1624) and 28% (449/1624), respectively, for all SARI cases. influenza A/H3 was the most commonly identified pathogen, present in 30% (75/250) of patients. the most commonly identified pathogen was RSV in march (31%, 37/86) through May (24%, 6/25) and rhinovirus in June (28%, 13/46) through November (30%, 26/88). 28% 20% 19% 41% 38% 30% 13% Enterovirus 0% 1% 1% 0% 11% 5% 13% 14% 0% 1% 0% Adenovirus 5% 3% 4% 4% 1% 1% Respiratory syncytial virus 13% 15% 31% 43% 24% 4% 10% 0% 0% 2% 8% 10% Any co-infection 9% 7% 19% 24% 24% 11% 35% 13% 21% 20% 24% 18% Negative hospitalization in an ICU was highest among those with human metapneumovirus (50%, 20/40) and influenza A/H3 (80%, 107/133) infections. artificial ventilation was more common in those with influenza A/H1pdm09 (18%, 58/328), human metapneumovirus (15%, 6/40), influenza A/H3 (13%, 18/133), and parainfluenzavirus (12%, 9/72) Y: known to have received vaccine, U: unknown whether received vaccine, N: known to have not received vaccine. influenza B was more common (present in 9% [15/171] of patients, versus 6% [11/171] of those with A/H1pdm09 and 2% [3/171] of those with A/H3) by March, influenza A/H3 was the most common pathogen, present in 30% (75/250) of patients. 0% 3% 30% Influenza B 1% 9% 9% 8% 12% 4% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% clinical presentation Fever, cough, and breathing difficulty were the most common symptoms in SARI cases. overall, 75% (1,213/1,624) of SARI cases had breathing difficulty. hospitalization in an ICU was highest among those with human metapneumovirus (50%, 20/40) and influenza A/H1pdm09 (46%, 22/82) the odds of being an influenza case compared to being a SARI case that did not have influenza varied by influenza strain and by how those with unknown vaccination status were categorized. a protective association between vaccination and disease status was observed when cases with unknown vaccination status were combined with those who were known to be unvaccinated. the most serious clinical symptoms were found in those infected with influenza A and human metapneumovirus. a cross-country risk assessment of SARI activity among European countries during the 2015\u20132016 found a predominance of influenza A circulation in the region. only a few of the SARI cases reported during the 2015\u20132017 period had received the influenza vaccine. a study of pediatric influenza cases from the 2010\u201311 influenza season in Georgia also found low vaccination coverage\u2013there being no case with a prior vaccination. a longitudinal study in England estimated that only 5% of symptomatic influenza cases are medically attended and reported into the surveillance system. it is not clear how representative these findings are of SARI for the whole of Georgia. a longitudinal study in England estimated that only 5% of symptomatic influenza cases are medically attended and reported into the surveillance system. allows for in-depth understanding of SARI by specific etiology, seasonality of pathogens and case distribution by age. the findings from this sentinel surveillance system can assist in improving preparedness for severe respiratory illness epidemics."}
