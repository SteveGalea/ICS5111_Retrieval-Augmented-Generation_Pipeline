{"summary": "viral infections are believed to cause approximately 15\u201320% of human cancers. viruses belong to highly divergent virus genera and include human papillomaviruses (HPVs), hepatitis B and C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, human T cell-lymphotropic virus type-1 and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus. unbiased HTS investigation should increase the probability of identifying novel viruses in various diseases, such as cancers and in infections, when conventional tests fail. unbiased HTS investigation should increase the probability of identifying novel viruses in various diseases, such as cancers and in infections. studies identifying novel viruses are most often not established [17, 19, 26], and may well vary depending on the target virus, sample type and enrichment technique. sensitivity and enrichment efficiency of different HTS techniques have not been thoroughly examined. each sample was split in four fractions of which two were used for shotgun sequencing of total DNA or RNA. samples were prepared by spiking PBMCs from anonymous blood donors with known concentrations of different viral material. the material used was HeLa cells harbouring 10\u201350 copies of integrated human papilloma virus type 18 (HPV-18), 8E5 cells carrying one copy of proviral human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) genome. aRNA 1 4,000 0 0 0 700 5 2 400 0.4 2.5 12.5 700 5 3 40 0.4 2.5 12.5 700 5 4 4 25 125 70 5 5 0.4 40 25 125 7 5 6 0.4 400 250 1,250 7 5 7 0 4,000 2,500 12,500 0 5 HIV-1. cell cultures human HeLa cells containing 10\u201350 proviral copies/cell of HPV-18 were grown in RPMI-1640 with Glutamax-I (Invitrogen target product size Sequence (5\u2019-3\u2019) incl. dyes and quenchers HIV-1 # 128 bp AAGCCTCAATAAAGCTTGCCTTGA GTTCGGGCGCCACTGCTAG FAM-TCTGGTAACTAGAGATCCCTCAGACC-BHQ1 HPV-18, EV and aRNA, MeV plasmid, and HAdV-C assays. the qPCR standards consisted of counted 8E5 cells or HeLa cells, an adenovirus control of 100,000 copies/ml (AcroMetrix) and aRNA with a concentration of 50,000 copies of EV/ml (Asuragen) the molar concentrations were calculated from the plasmid size. all viruses could be detected by qPCR down to the lowest concentration used in the prepared samples. libraries were prepared with varying input volumes according to manufacturers instructions. read pairs or merged reads with identical start and end mapping positions were considered to be of clonal origin. reads mapping to each virus was recorded, with reads mapping to the human genome being discarded. human PBMCs were obtained from an anonymous blood donor from the blood bank at Copenhagen University Hospital (Rigshospitalet) the study was performed within a larger frame program, which was submitted for ethical evaluation to the regional committee on health research ethics and the national committee on health research ethics. copy number of cells or virus per l sample Sample HIV-1, provirus HPV-18, integrated HAdV EV MeV plasmid aRNA 1 4,000 0 0 0 700 5 2 400 0.4 2.5 12.5 700 5 3 40 0.4 2.5 12.5 70 5 4 4 4 25 125 70 5 0.4 40 25 125 7 5 6 0.4 400 250 1,250 7 5 7 0 4,000 2,500 12,500 0 5 HIV-1. the concentrations of the different viruses in the samples were determined by qPCR using the Lightcycler 480 Probes Master mix reagents. qPCRs were performed by denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 amplification cycles with denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. for the HIV-1 assay the qPCR run was performed according to Drosten et al. [33]. the qPCR standards consisted of counted 8E5 cells or HeLa cells, an adenovirus control of 100,000 copies/ml (AcroMetrix), aRNA with a concentration of 50,000 copies of EV/ml (Asuragen) and for the MeV plasmid the molar concentrations were calculated from the plasmi libraries were prepared with varying input volumes according to manufacturers instructions. libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. reads were mapped onto the human genome (hg19) and a reference collection of viral genomes. rarefaction analysis shows the diversity in a given dataset. it was performed by iteratively including sets of 1105 read sequences. the concentration of each virus was determined by qPCR. the two samples with the highest concentrations of HAdV (2,500 and 250 copies/l, respectively), yielded sufficient reads to completely cover the HAdV reference genome. for the lower concentrations, the genome was only partially covered. HPV-18 genomes were present in the form of HeLa cells containing 10\u201350 HPV-18 copies/cell of integrated HPV-18 genome [29, 30] only in the three samples with the highest concentration of HIV-1 proviral DNA (4,000, 400 and 40 copies/l) the coverage of the HIV-1 genome was saturated only for the most concentrated sample. RNA shotgun libraries were sequenced with three or four samples per lane, producing between 32 and 70 million reads per sample. as the host RNA was not quantifiable, the proportion of expected viral reads could not be predicted. a small fraction of reads mapping to HIV-1 or HPV-18, in our virus-negative controls, indicating misinterpretation of reads during parallel sequencing of multiple samples. the sample with the highest concentration of EV (12,500 copies/l) yielded sufficient reads to completely cover the EV reference genome. we compared the sensitivity of shotgun sequencing to that of specific qPCR assays. in general, a higher input amount was required for detection by shotgun sequencing than by qPCR detection. but in some cases a few viral reads were detected for concentrations below the detection limit. plasmid HIV-1 HPV-18 EV aRNA 1 0 / 5.2 0 / 0 4.0 / 0.44 0.31 / 30 71,539 / 1,756 0.96 / 0 0.48 / 1.1 0 / 0 2 0.09 / 947 0.02 / 0 0.22 / 3.6 0.77 / 2.4 5,788 / 221 0 / 0 1.6 / 19 0 / fold increase in proportion of HAdV (A) or EV (B) sequences in virion-enriched libraries as compared to non-enriched shotgun sequenced libraries. proportions are calculated as the number of viral reads relative to the total number of assigned reads. libraries prepared from the virion-enriched RNA yielded between 14.5 and 44.6 million reads (26.3 million on average) EV was the only virus for which enrichment could be expected after this treatment. virion enrichment may provide approximately one or three orders of magnitude for varying dilutions of viral target RNA or DNA, respectively. the enrichment procedure offers a more cost-effective sequencing, which also requires more handling of the individual sample. the sensitivity or effectiveness of these methods is rarely assessed. extensive shotgun sequencing of samples not sharing lanes showed no indications of contamination. this argues that the reads appear as an artefact of misreading of clusters or indexes during sequencing of several samples per lane. the observed level of artefact sequences range between 0.48\u201348 ppm. HAdV DNA required more than 143106 reads using 100 viral copies/reaction. previous studies have reported high sensitivity by HTS. we speculate that this resistance is caused by super-coiling. other methods targeting circular DNA have proven highly efficient in selective amplification of circular DNA virus genomes. the fragment lengths within the RNA libraries were approximately the same fluctuating between 150 and 500 bp with an average length of 350 bp. the same applied to the virion-enriched libraries; however, they peak at around 200 bp. this could indicate a small difference in the performance of the kits. we compared detection of virus in virion-enriched DNA and RNA libraries with shotgun sequenced libraries. results showed that enrichment of virion-associated DNA was successful. viral target reads increased up to 13 fold for the virion-associated RNA. virion enrichment is more labour-intensive and has additional reagent costs. RNA enrichment was no more than 2\u201313 fold for EV."}
