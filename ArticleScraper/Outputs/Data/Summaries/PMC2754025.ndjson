{"summary": "2.2 cases of acute viral bronchiolitis occur per 100 infants annually. 1% of these are hospitalized (2). malnutrition and infection are among the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in infancy. infants aged 0\u20136 month(s) were admitted to a tertiary public hospital. they were diagnosed with acute viral bronchiolitis and first episode of wheezing. the paediatricians were not blind to any data, and the researchers did not influence the management of patients. data on type of breastfeeding, duration of exclusive breastfeeding, exposure to smoking mother, and socioeconomic situation of the infant's family were collected through a structured interview at admission with parents. weight of the infant was measured without clothes on, using a Urano electronic scale that stands a maximum weight of 15 kg and 5 g precision. the use of the 10th percentile was also adopted for weight-for-age in the classification of the nutritional risk (16) the infants who presented a z-score on the limit between 1.27 and +1.27 for weight-for-length were considered well-nourished. a preliminary analysis was used considering an =0.05 and a =0.20. the paediatric ward, in this context, was considered intermediate complexity between the other two. a difference of two days of length of hospital stay with standard deviation (SD) of 3.2 days, the need of 145 infants was estimated. for the variables with more than two categories, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used. for the variables with more than two categories, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used. 51.4% of hospitalized infants evaluated were aged three months or less. only 1.7% of the infants attended daycare centres. 4.4% of mothers and 43.5% of fathers had not completed elementary school. Table 2. Classification of nutritional status and breastfeeding Characteristics Infants (n=175) Confidence interveral 95% No. % Z-score of L/A, no.
