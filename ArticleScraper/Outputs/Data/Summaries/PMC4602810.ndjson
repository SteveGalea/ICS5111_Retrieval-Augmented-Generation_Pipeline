{"summary": "asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract. predisposed individuals suffer recurrent episodes of symptoms such as wheezing, cough, and dyspnea due to bronchial obstruction. the airway obstruction is reversible, either spontaneously or through medical treatment. the variety of tested organisms consisted of bacteria, viruses, and fungi in the airways of different types of asthmatics. the aim of this study is to clarify which of those methods better detects pathogens in the sputum of bronchial asthma patients. the study population was mixed in terms of age in all 4 study groups. it included unselected asthmatics during asthma attack periods and attack-free intervals. the indication for the microbiological examination was either explicitly because of a suspected respiratory infection or otherwise routinely. sputum, tracheal, and bronchial secretions collected in sterile sputum collection tube. macroscopic evaluation was performed to determine whether it was slimy, purulent, or bloody. bronchial secretions and pus constituents of saliva were separated with a needle and an eye. the tested Enterobacteriaceae were E coli, Shigella, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Salmonella, and Yersinia. the chocolate agar (Oxoid Blood Agar Base No. 2, Wesel, Germany) was used as a variant of blood agar. the mechanical properties of the lungs and the lung volume were measured using body plethysmography (JAEGER, MasterScreen Body, Germany) the inclusion criteria for this study were all patients with asthma whose tracheal secretions were examined microbiologically for pathogenic germs. the total immunoglobulin E (IgE) in human serum and plasma was determined as an aid in the diagnosis of allergic diseases. the blood samples were collected using the SARSTEDT serum Monovette 4.7 mL blood collection system with a multifly blood collection needle. the normal reference range for IgE was defined as 0 to 158 IU/mL. the length of hospital stay was compared between patients with different forms of asthma with and without the detection of infection. the medical association of Saarland's Institutional Review Board waived the need for informed consent. asthma was classified as paroxysmal dyspnea under the clinical presentation of expiratory stridor, cough-variant asthma, and wheezing. the diagnosis was made based on patients\u2019 medical history, clinical examinations, and lung function with bronchospasmolysis. the throat swab was collected with a commercial cotton swab transport system. the sputum was recovered by expectoration into a 30 mL sterile sputum collection tube. macroscopic evaluation was performed to determine whether it was slimy, purulent, or bloody. Columbia Agar with 5% sheep blood (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) agar (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) was used and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 to 48 hours. gassner agar (water-blue metachrome\u2013yellow lactose agar) operated to detect Enterobacteriaceae. macConkey agar (Oxoid) was used as a selective medium to detect gram-negative bacteria. PCR was used to detect adenovirus; coronavirus; coxsackie ECHO virus; cytomegalovirus; Epstein\u2013Barr virus; Herpes simplex; Influenza viruses A, B, and H1/N1; parainfluenzas 1 to 3; respiratory synctial virus; rhinovirus; enterovirus; and vari oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH scale were measured with the blood gas analyzer ABL90 FLEX. the reference range after blood gas analysis was 7.37 to 7.42 for the pH scale, 75 to 90 mm Hg for oxygen, and 37 to 43 mm Hg for carbon dioxide. the prick test was carried out as part of the allergic asthma diagnosis. the leukocyte count (normal range 4000\u201310,000/L) in the blood was determined generally as a routine part of small or large blood counts after collection in EDTA Monovette 2.7 mL by flow cytometry. we examined long-term oxygen therapy (oxygen 75 mm Hg, carbon dioxide >50 mm Hg) as a predisposing factor for bacterial colonization in asthma. one-way analysis of variance was performed to compare age differences, blood tests, lung function tests, and the duration of hospital stay among all asthma groups. a total of 296 patients with asthma met the inclusion criteria for this trial. a total of 352 patients with different types of asthma met the inclusion criteria for this trial. a comparison of the different species showed an increased incidence of individual microbes, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Respiratory synctial virus, and Candida albicans, but without statistical significance. the comparison of the blood test, lung function test, FeNO, and blood gas analysis results revealed no significant difference between the 4 asthma groups. SSION Based on the present findings, we were unable to identify microbiological colonization in the airways of most asthmatics in this study population. the detection of pathogenic agents occurred in about 10% of asthmatics in this study. however, there appeared to be no direct correlation between asthma and the microbiome. we were able to detect C pneumoniae by bronchoalveolar lavage in a patient with allergic asthma in an infection-free period. however, our results show no association between C pneumoniae and the exacerbation of asthma. this may be due to the difficulty in microbiologically identifying these organisms. previously published data contribute to stimulating a lively discussion on the relationship between several types of bacteria to the risk and prognosis of asthma. the association between S aureus and asthma cannot be confirmed by our results due to the small number of patients with S aureus infections. in cases of acute asthma, only 4 infectious agents were shown. infections caused by P aeruginosa belong to the class of opportunistic pathogens. non-invasive techniques such as induced sputum provide results that are as reliable as those of traditional gold-standard methods such as bronchoalveolar lavage. induced sputum is a useful biological medium for the diagnosis of asthma and the determination of harmful dust."}
