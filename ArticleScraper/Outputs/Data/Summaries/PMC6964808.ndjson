{"summary": "the 2005 international health regulations (IHR) of the WHO and US biosurveillance-related legislation were examined. the IDCPA and IHR were independently analyzed as to how they encompass the components of the surveillance system. biosurveillance focuses on uncategorized risk factors rather than known diseases. the ultimate goal of biosurveillance is to enable a timely response by integrating data from multiple agencies and disciplines. the 1969 IHR had limitations, including a scope limited to quarantinable diseases. the revised IHR is not limited to specific diseases and can be applied to newly discovered diseases. the IDCPA includes planning (annual strategy reports), reporting and notification, and epidemiologic investigation of suspected cases. it includes conducting surveys, handling of high-risk pathogens, vaccination, disinfection, and other preventive measures. the process of surveillance derived from the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act. IRCA allows screening for undefined risk factors, enabling faster detection than tracking of disease. IRCA establishes the responsibilities of the national biosurveillance integration center (NBIC), which coordinates and integrates biosurveillance data from member agencies. the law mandates that the NBIC reduce duplicative surveillance efforts among agencies and monitor the technical tools used by each agency to confirm its effectiveness. the fda's FSMA does not outline the concept of biosurveillance. the ultimate goal of biosurveillance is to enable early detection of a threat and mounting of an integrated response. biosurveillance systems monitor incidents, threats, or activities related to human, animal, or plant health. the 1969 IHR had limitations, including a scope limited to quarantinable diseases. the revised IHR is not limited to specific diseases and can be applied to newly discovered diseases. the process of surveillance derived from the international health regulations (2005) focuses on threats of international importance. IDCPA process of infectious disease surveillance involves routine activities of planning and prevention by the KCDC. once an infectious disease is identified by a physician during a medical examination or is self-reported by a patient, the appropriate health authorities must be notified. the response to infectious disease focuses on controlling further spread and managing infected patients. the NBIC coordinates and integrates biosurveillance data from member agencies. the first step of the process is surveillance by individual agencies regardless of the biosurveillance system. the NBIC also searches for relevant data from private sources. the pandemic and all Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 is the most recent act relating to biosurveillance. the act emphasizes the coordination and integration of information as fundamental elements of biosurveillance. the IHR does not propose guidelines on the means by which potential risks should be detected. the IDCPA of the ROK has more similarities to the IHR than to biosurveillance-related legislation. the scope of the IDCPA is narrower than that of biosurveillance-related legislation in terms of targets of monitoring, integration of information and systems. the act does not address the need for data integration. without constant exchange and integration of data, detection of novel threats is difficult. it does not include guidelines on detection of disease other than by voluntary reporting. government efforts could focus on revising the law to reflect the need for situational awareness."}
