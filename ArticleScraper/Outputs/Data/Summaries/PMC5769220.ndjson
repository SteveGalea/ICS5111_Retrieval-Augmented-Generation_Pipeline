{"summary": "PRRS is characterized by reproductive disorders in pregnant sows and respiratory diseases in growing pigs. it is a viral disease caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV) (1,2) since its first outbreak in 1987 in USA (3), PRRS has spread to the major pig-producing countries and regions (4). PRRSV-encoded nsp 1, nsp 2, and nsp 11 and N protein play key roles in antagonizing the activation of IFN- promoter (21) these focused mainly on the stage of IFN- mRNA transcription, primarily in PRRSV permissive MARC-145 cells or non-permissive human cell culture systems. cellular miRNAs could be modulated during PRRSV infection (26\u201328) some miRNAs could promote or inhibit PRRSV replication (29\u201332) no literature on how PRRSV-modulating cellular miRNAs manipulate the protein expression of type I IFN has been documented. inactivated PRRSV cannot suppress type I IFN production induced by TGEV infection or poly I:C stimulation in PAMs. pathogenicity between HP-PRRSV and low pathogenic PRRSV strains is significantly different in vivo and in vitro. predicted miRNA-targeted binding sequences in porcine IFN- 3\u2032UTR. sequences were from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank), by miRanda (40), RNA hybrid (41) and PITA (42). miRNA mimics and miRNA inhibitors Based on the sequences of porcine cellular miRNAs.

transcription levels increased from 12 to 36 hpi compared with mock group. mRNA levels of porcine IFN- in PRRSV-infected PAMs and protein expression levels in culture supernatants of PRRSV-infected PAMs were detected by real-time PCR and ELISA. primary PAMs were infected with JXwn06 or HB-1/3.9 at MOI of 0.01 or 1. mRNA transcription levels in porcine IFN- mRNA were significantly different at 36 hpi between JXwn06- and HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs. transcription levels of porcine IFN- mRNA were significantly different at 36 hpi between the two strains of PRRSV. levels of PRRSV-infected PAMs, the

let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 were upregulated significantly in early stages of IFN- protein expression. the four cellular miRNAs could modulate the protein induction of IFN- in PAMs. the native IFN- induced in PAMs could also regulate the expression of four endogenous miRNAs. the HP-PRRSV JXwn06 exhibits a higher ability of inducing let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 levels than low pathogenic PRRSV HB-1/3.9 during early infection. qRT-PCR analysis of cellular endogenous miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 in primary PAMs infected with JXwn06 or HB- the protein expression of IFN- was upregulated in the miRNA inhibitor-transfected primary PAMs during PRRSV infection at 24 hpi. compared with PRRSV-infected PAMs transfected with all miRNA inhibitors, but miRNA-145 inhibitor, the protein expression of IFN- in HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs was higher than that in JXwn06-infected PAMs. IFN- mRNA transcription levels increased from 12 to 36 hpi in primary PAMs early infected with PRRSV. mRNA levels of porcine IFN- in PRRSV-infected PAMs were detected by real-time PCR and ELISA. ine IFN- at MOI of 1 were higher than that at MOI of 0.01 in both JXwn06- and HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs. the regulation effect of PRRSV on porcine IFN- mRNA transcription is dose-dependent in primary PAMs infected with PRRSV. relative concentration of IFN- protein normalized to negative control decreased. relative expression levels of porcine IFN- at MOI of 1 were lower than that at MOI of 0.01 in both JXwn06- and HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs. cellular miRNAs let-7b, miR-26a,

co-transfected with pmirGLO-MRE-wt or pmirGLO-MRE-mut. miRNA mimics inhibited the expression of firefly luciferase of pmirGLO-MRE-wt. inhibition of firefly luciferase expression by miRNA was weakened for pmirGLO-MRE-mut. miRNA mimics including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 were capable of inhibiting the protein production of porcine IFN- in primary PAMs at 10 nM. at 40 nM the inhibition effect of four miRNAs were significantly stronger. compared with the negative control group, three of the four miRNA inhibitors weakened the suppression effect of porcine cellular endogenous miRNAs in primary PAMs. the native IFN- protein induction stimulated by poly I:C could upregulate the expression of endogenous miRNAs in primary PAMs. the results were normalized to U6 expression and mock-treated controls. FN- protein could lead to upregulation of endogenous miRNA levels. miR-26a and miR-34a were upregulated significantly in early stages of IFN- protein expression at a low level. native IFN- induced in PAMs could also regulate expression of four endogenous miRNAs. let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 in HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs were significantly higher than those in HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs at 24 hpi. qRT-PCR analysis of cellular endogenous miRNAs including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 in primary PAMs infected with JXwn06 or HB- primary PAMs were transfected with miRNA inhibitors including the antagonists of let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145. the protein expression of IFN- was upregulated in the miRNA inhibitor-transfected primary PAMs during PRRSV infection at 24 hpi. the protein expression of IFN- was upregulated in the miRNA inhibitor-transfected primary PAMs during PRRSV infection at 24 hpi. supernatant samples were subjected to detection of the protein concentration of IFN-. compared with mock group, IFN- mRNA transcription levels increased from 12 to 36 hpi both in JXwn06- and HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs. transcription levels of porcine IFN- mRNA at MOI of 1 were higher than that at MOI of 0.01 in both JXwn06- and HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs. the regulation effect of PRRSV on porcine IFN- mRNA transcription is dose-dependent in primary PAMs infected with PRRSV. control PAM cells increased higher than that in the culture supernatants of PRRSV-infected PAM cells at each time point. relative concentration of IFN- protein normalized to negative control decreased. mRNA transcription levels of IFN- in primary PAMs were upregulated, whereas its protein relative expression levels were downregulated. cellular miRNAs let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 could target porcine IFN- 3\u2032UTR. the binding sequences were located at 160\u2013181, 9\u201331, 27\u201347 and 12\u201332 bp in porcine IFN- 3\u2032UTR. pmirGLO-IFN- 3\u2032UTR gene was cloned into the downstream of firefly luciferase in pmirGLO dual firefly/Renilla luciferase miRNA target expression vector. miRNA mimics could inhibit the expression of firefly luciferase in pmirGLO-IFN- 3\u2032UTR. miRNA mimics inhibited the expression of firefly luciferase of pmirGLO-MRE-wt. at 40 nM the inhibition of four miRNAs was stronger. miRNA mimics inhibited the expression of firefly luciferase of pmirGLO-MRE-mut. a final concentration of 50 g/ml poly I:C was used to stimulate the PAMs for 24 h. miRNA mimics including let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 were capable of inhibiting the protein production of porcine IFN- in primary PAMs at 10 nM. at 40 nM the relieving effect of four miRNA inhibitors were significantly stronger. the native IFN- protein induction stimulated by poly I:C could upregulate the expression of endogenous miRNAs in primary PAMs. the results were normalized to U6 expression and mock-treated controls. cellular endogenous miRNAs were increased only at or after the first augmentation of native IFN- protein induction in primary PAMs. the miR-26a and miR-34a had a significant increase, and let-7b was initially increased, and then decreased. the miR-145 showed an increase at a low level, demonstrating that it was exquisite for native IFN- protein to modulate the expression of cellular endogenous miRNAs. PRRSV infection is capable of inducing the generation of cellular let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 during the early infection. the levels of let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145 in JXwn06-infected PAMs were significantly higher than those in HB-1/3.9-infected PAMs at 24 hpi. the data represent means standard error of the mean of three independent experiments (*P0.05; **P0.01) the roles of miRNAs in PRRSV-mediated inhibition of porcine IFN- protein expression were further analyzed. primary PAMs were transfected transiently with miRNA inhibitors including the antagonists of let-7b, miR-26a, miR-34a and miR-145. cellular miRNA-mediated regulation of IFN- protein expression was investigated in primary PAMs infected with PRRSV in vitro. previous studies have demonstrated that PRRSV is a poor inducer of type I IFN in vitro and in vivo (1,50) HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and low pathogenic PRRSV HB-1/3.9 induced differential levels of IFN- protein expression in PAMs in vitro during early infection. the differential IFN- response of PAMs to different pathogenic PRRSV strains may be due to the viral distinct characteristics. compared with wild-type viruses, UV- and heat-inactivated PRRSV fail to suppress type I IFN production in vitro. previous studies showed that type I IFN induction correlated with the virulence of some viruses. a similar phenomenon has been described by an early study using primary primate macrophages (47) it is possible that porcine IFN- response is modulated at different levels in primary PAMs. further studies are required to discover additional mechanisms or miRNAs in primary PAMs. PRRSV infection can suppress host miR-125b and poly I:C-induced miR-23. many viruses could induce miRNAs to escape from immune responses. this could be strategies for PRRSV to evade type I IFN response."}
