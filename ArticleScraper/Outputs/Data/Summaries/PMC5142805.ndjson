{"summary": "MCMV exploits myeloid cells to spread [4, 5], and live imaging shows peripheral to systemic spread via lymph nodes (LN) [6], so LN myeloid cells are likely to be a key target for limiting systemic infection. pathogen absorption by SSM can protect down-stream targets such as the blood, but it is unlikely to prevent FRC infection. the anti-viral functions of SSM have been explored by injecting mice with xenogenic pathogens such as Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) the anti-viral functions of SSM have been explored by injecting mice with xenogenic pathogens. the failure of hepatocytes to spread infection in vivo makes unclear the relevance of liver infection to normal pathogenesis. the failure of hepatocytes to spread infection in vivo makes unclear the relevance of liver infection to normal pathogenesis. both IFNAR and pDC significantly increased luciferase signals in the feet (footpad + PLN) and in the neck (salivary gland) from day 3. after day 4, pDC only affected neck signals. IFNAR blockade increased signals in multiple organs at day 6 and in popliteal LN (PLN) and spleens at day 3. depleting pDC also increased luciferase signals, predominantly at day 3. pDC depletion had less effect, increasing titers in PLN. infectious virus was plaque assayed 3 days (a, b) or 1 day later (c, d) bars show means, other symbols show individual mice. after 3 days IFNAR blockade increased viral titers in both mouse strains. mice were given IFNAR blocking antibody (IFNAR) or not (control), then MCMV-GR i.f. (106 p.f.u.) PLN taken 1 day later were stained for viral GFP (GFP) and lytic antigens (MCMV), plus the SSM marker CD169 (a), the SSM/DC marker CD11c (b) or the FRC marker ER-TR7 (c). higher CD169+GFP+ cell counts indicated that IFNAR blockade increased SSM infection. higher CD11c+GFP+ cell counts indicated that IFNAR blockade also increased FRC infection. lytic antigen, IE1 and viral GFP expression all showed IFNAR blockade increasing MCMV infection of the LN subcapsular sinus. NK cells constitute a second, IFN-I-independent line of anti-MCMV defence. FNAR treated-mice (B220+, DAPI+) and significant NK cell recruitment (NKp46+) after IFNAR and effective NK cell depletion by mAb PK136. day 1 PLN sections of NK-depleted mice showed more infected ER-TR7+ cells. NK cells eliminate ER-TR7+ infected cells and cause tissue damage. NK cells eliminate ER-TR7+ infected cells and cause tissue damage. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were given IFN, depleted of asialoGM1+ cells (NK), or left untreated. NK cell depletion increased PLN virus titers as much as IFNAR blockade. NK cells also helped to control early infection. NK cells were depleted of NK1.1+ cells (NK) or not (control), then given i.f. MCMV-GR (106 p.f.u.). 1 day later PLN sections were stained for viral GFP, the FRC marker ER-TR7 and the apoptotic cell marker caspase 3. C57BL/6 mice were depleted of SSM with liposomal clodronate (clod), given IFNAR blocking antibody (IFN), then infected i.f. with MCMV-GR (106 p.f.u.) 3 days later, organs were plaque-assayed for infectious virus. tion and IFNAR blockade both increased day 3 PLN and spleen infections without increasing footpad infections. in PLN they gave similar increases and when combined gave an additive increase. therefore IFN-I did not come just from SSM\u2014notably pDC depletion also increased virus titers. splenic infection, SSM depletion plus IFNAR blockade gave no increase beyond IFNAR blockade alone. MCMV production can be tracked by floxed virus recombination. non-myeloid cells produce most of the infectious virus in IFNAR-blocked mice. rates IFNAR and control mice were compared by Fisher's Exact Test. we also determined below the % virus switching (infectious) recovered from each mouse. lysM-cre mice were given IFNAR blocking antibody, without or without additional NK cell depleting antibody (NK) three days later we recovered virus from footpads, PLN and spleens and quantified fluorochrome switching. mice were depleted of NK cells then infected i.f. with MCMV-GR. titers and comparisons were determined as in (a) the viruses recovered in (c) were assayed for green to red switching. lysM+/creIFNARflox/flox mice inactivated IFNAR specifically in lysM+ cells. mice were depleted of NK cells then given MCMV-GR i.f.. lysM-cre controls with IFNAR intact were depleted of NK cells. ade increases direct infection of ER-TR7+ cells I.f. MCMV directly infects SSM [6]. if it reached FRC via SSM, IFN-I could protect FRC by limiting SSM infection. if it reached FRC directly, they must be protected directly. gL coding sequence disrupted by a -galactosidase (gal) expression cassette. both control and IFNAR-blocked mice had gal+ cells around the subcapsular sinus. a significantly higher proportion of gal+ cells were ER-TR7+ after IFNAR blockade. both IFNAR and pDC significantly increased luciferase signals in the feet (footpad + PLN) and in the neck (salivary gland) from day 3. after day 4, pDC only affected neck signals. pDC depletion had only a modest effect on MCMV spread after i.p. inoculation. we dissected mice 3 and 6 days after i.f. MCMV-LUC. depleting pDC increased luciferase signals, predominantly at day 6. m157- MCMV is probably more representative of the viruses that colonize Ly49H+ mice. we used MCMV in which a GFP cassette interrupts m157 (MCMV-GR; Fig 2). IFNAR blockade increases early LN infections of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. mice were given IFNAR blocking antibody (IFNAR) or not (control), then MCMV-GR i.f. (106 p.f.u.) PLN taken 1 day later stained for viral GFP and lytic antigens. most viral GFP+ cells (approximately 75%) were viral lytic antigen+ and most lytic antigen+ cells were GFP+. higher CD169+GFP+ cell counts indicated that IFNAR blockade increased SSM infection. lytic antigen, IE1 and viral GFP expression all showed IFNAR blockade increasing MCMV infection of the LN subcapsular sinus. NK cells constitute a second, IFN-I-independent line of anti-MCMV defence. ining shows significant loss of LN cellularity in IFNAR treated-mice (B220+, DAPI+) and significant NK cell recruitment (NKp46+) after IFNAR and effective NK cell depletion by mAb PK136. NK cell depletion increased virus titers in NK-depleted mice. NK cells eliminate ER-TR7+ infected cells and cause tissue damage. NK cells eliminate ER-TR7+ infected cells and cause tissue damage. NK depletion alone had a small effect (*p0.05, ***p0.001; Student\u2019s two tailed unpaired t-test). NK cell depletion increased PLN virus titers as much as IFNAR blockade. apoptotic cell marker caspase 3 was negligible in uninfected PLN. most viral GFP+ FRC were caspase 3+; most were caspase 3-. NK cell recruitment into the PLN led to apoptosis in infected PLN. C57BL/6 mice were depleted of SSM with liposomal clodronate (clod), given IFNAR blocking antibody (IFN), then infected i.f. with MCMV-GR (106 p.f.u.). 3 days later, organs were plaque-assayed for infectious virus. in situ analysis of day 3 PLN showed markedly increased FRC infection after SSM depletion by clodronate loaded liposomes. however this increased FRC infection recruited relatively few NK cells. NK cell recruitment was maximal after SSM depletion plus IFNAR blockade. recruitment was associated with a reduction in ER-TR7+ cell infection. but IFNAR blockade gave no increase beyond IFNAR blockade alone. MCMV production can be tracked by floxed virus recombination. the switching rates IFNAR and control mice were compared for each site by Fisher's Exact Test. the numbers give mean SEM for each group. floxed muHV-4 and Herpes simplex virus type 1 show substantial switching in lysM-cre and CD11c-cre mice after IFNAR blockade. unswitched MCMV from cre- cells such as FRC seemed to dilute out switched SSM virus regardless of IFNAR blockade. three days later we recovered virus from footpads, PLN and spleens and quantified fluorochrome switching. squares and circles show the cre-driven green to red switching rates of individual mice. tailed unpaired t-test with Welch\u2019s correction. titers and comparisons were determined as in (a) lysM+/creIFNARflox/flox mice inactivate IFNAR specifically in lysM+ cells. these mice, and lysM-cre controls with IFNAR intact, were depleted of NK cells then given MCMV-GR i.f. the specificity of the block is probably limited by a lack of positive feedback through IFNAR reducing IFN-I production in lysM+ mice. IFNAR blockade increases direct infection of ER-TR7+ cells I.f. MCMV directly infects SSM [6] if it reached FRC via SSM, IFN-I could protect FRC. if it reached FRC directly, they must be protected directly. the pseudotyped gL+ virions are infectious but without complementation do not produce infectious progeny. in vivo, gL- MCMV infects just once. both control and IFNAR-blocked mice had gal+ cells around the subcapsular sinus. innate immunity is inherently polylithic, and IFN-I was not the sole IFN-I producer at the subcapsular sinus: pDC also contributed. but boosting their engagement provides a potential route to better infection control. MCMV replicated preferentially in FRC. pDC may also contribute, as may resident stromal cells and recruited inflammatory cells. the early inhibition of MCMV infection by IFN-I was consistent with a key role for resident SSM. immigrant cells function more as a back-up should SSM prove insufficient. most virions in the afferent lymph are captured by SSM, but some infect FRC. virions are released into the LN to infect new FRC and myeloid cells. pDC also produce IFN-I; they may receive infected cell debris and cytokines via the FRC conduits. mice were kept at university of Queensland animal units and used when 6\u201312 weeks old. for myeloid cell-specific IFNAR disruption, LysM-cre mice were back-crossed onto IFNARflox/flox. each was given 1 and 3 days before infection. pDC were depleted with anti-Bst2 mAb BX444 (250g i.p., Bio-X-cell), 1 and 3 days before infection. cell depletion was 85\u201390% effective, as measured by flow cytometry for Bst-2 and SiglecH. experimental groups were compared statistically by two-tailed unpaired student\u2019s t test unless stated otherwise. expression cassette into M115 [6] was propagated on gL-expressing NIH-3T3 cells. infected cells were cleared of cell debris by low speed centrifugation (500 x g, 10min), then virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation (35,000 x g, 2h). cells were grown in modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 2mM glutamine, 100IU/ml penicillin, 100g/ml streptomycin and 10% feta rabbit pAb was raised in house by subcutaneous inoculation with MCMV K181 propagated in NIH 3T3 cells. sections were washed x3 in PBS, incubated (1h, 23\u00b0C) with combinations of Alexa 568- or Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 pAb, and Alexa 488- goat anti-chicken pAb. fluorescence was visualised with NK cells were depleted from mice with anti-NK1.1 mAb PK136. each was given 1 and 3 days before infection and every 2 days thereafter. cell depletion was >90% effective, as measured by immunostaining of tissue sections with anti-NKp46 antibody. MCMV-GR encodes a floxed gene upstream of a nuclear-targeted tdTomato gene. the cassette encodes a floxed GFP gene upstream of a nuclear-targeted tdTomato gene. cre irreversibly switches MCMV-GR from green to nuclear red fluorescence. normal goat serum (1h, 23\u00b0C), then incubated (18h, 4\u00b0C) with antibodies to B220 (rat mAb RA3-6B2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD68 (rat mAb FA-11), ER-TR7 (rat mAb 440c), -galactosidase (chicken pAb), caspase 3, Lyve-1 (both rabbit pAb, AbCam), CD206 (rat mAb MR5D3)"}
