{"summary": "resistance to movement of macromolecules and pathogens across epithelia and endothelia is mediated in large part by tight junctions. resistance to movement of macromolecules and pathogens across epithelia and endothelia is mediated in large part by tight junctions. claudins, occludins and junctional adhesion molecules (JAM) form intracellular interactions with cytoplasmic components. for the first time, we employed a coordinated study to understand the effects of viral infection on tight junction proteins in both epithelial and endothelial cells. we observed that capsid protein expression alone did not result in degradation of tight junction membrane proteins. lysates were subjected to immunoblot analyses with antibodies to WNV capsid or NS3. claudin-1, JAM-1, occludin and -actin were infected for 48 hours. a large pool of the WNV capsid protein is targeted to nuclei of infected cells. the levels of tight junction protein encoding mRNAs were determined using a comparative cT method. in mock and WNV-infected CACO-2 cells, values were normalized to 1.0 but are not shown on the graph. blocking dynamin function should inhibit the turnover of claudin-1 and JAM-1 in infected cells. treatment of cells with the dynamin-specific inhibitor Dynasore [15] completely protected these proteins from degradation during viral infection. infected cells with nocodazole completely blocked degradation of claudin-1 and JAM-1. nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus downregulates cell surface expression of MHC 1 complexes by stimulating their endocytosis. nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus downregulates cell surface expression of MHC 1 complexes by stimulating their endocytosis. claudin-1 is blocked by disrupting microtubules or inhibiting dynamin function. MDCK cells were infected with WNV and 24 hours later were treated with 10 M nocodazole, 10 M Dynasore or DMSO. primary antibodies were detected using donkey anti-mouse Alexa546 and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa488 secondary antibodies. nuclei were counter stained with DAPI. images were captured using a leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. CACO2 cells were infected with DENV-2 and after 48 hours, relative levels of claudin-1, JAM-1, and occudin were determined by immunoblotting. bars indicate standard error of the mean. expression of capsid protein does not cause degradation of tight junction membrane proteins. CACO-2 (A) and MDCK (B) cells were transduced with WNV or transduced with lentiviruses encoding GFP alone (Vector) or GFP and WNV capsid (Capsid) lysates were subjected to immunoblot analyses. WNV infection results in degradation of a subset of tight junction membrane proteins. some of the discrepancies may be due to the fact that one study employed epithelial cells [5] whereas others used endothelial cells [6], [7] claudin-1- or JAM-1-specific mRNAs were significantly increased. claudin-1 mRNA levels were >1.8 fold higher than in mock-treated cells. at 72 h post-infection, they were 3.9 times higher (p = 0.039) a number of ways in which integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane can be targeted for degradation. the most common of which involves clathrin- or caveolae-dependent endocytosis followed by lysosomal degradation. if WNV-induced degradation of claudin-1 and JAM-1 requires dynamin and microtubules. data from three independent experiments were used to determine normalized levels of claudin-1 and JAM-1 (relative to -actin) drugs such as nocodazole that inhibit formation of microtubules should protect claudin-1 and JAM-1 from degradation if the pathway involves transport from endosomes to lysosomes. le requires dynamin for vesicle scission from the trans-Golgi network [20]. if WNV infection causes re-routing of nascent claudin-1 from the plasma membrane, then treatment should result in their accumulation in the trans-Golgi network and/or associated vesicles in the juxtanuclear region. primary antibodies were detected using donkey anti-claudin-1 and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa488 secondary antibodies. nuclei were counter stained with DAPI. images were captured using a leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning microscope. DENV infection did not significantly alter the localization tight junction membrane proteins such as claudin-1 or JAM-1. this decrease was very small compared to the loss of claudin-1 in WNV-infected cells. claudin-1 and occludin protein levels were not significantly affected by DENV infection. protein in the absence of other WNV proteins results in degradation of claudin-1. we used lentiviral pseudoparticles to transduce CACO-2 and MDCK cells. we did not observe significant degradation of claudin-1 or JAM-1 in capsid-expressing cells. laudin-1 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to claudin-1, JAM-1 or capsid. primary antibodies were detected using donkey anti-claudin-1, mouse anti-occludin, rabbit anti-JAM-1 and rabbit or guinea pig anti-WNV capsid. to cross the epithelium, loss of tight junction barrier function is a major factor in pulmonary edema. in contrast, the lethal circulation shock caused by Ebola virus may occur in the absence of virus replication or interaction of virus proteins with host cells. to cause systemic infections, WNV must cross epithelial and endothelial cell layers after arthropod-mediated transmission. ines released from deNV-infected cells can directly or indirectly influence the permeability of endothelial tight junction complexes. there is controversy as to whether or not they directly affect the expression and/or degradation of tight junction proteins. ation experiments failed to detect interaction between capsid and tight junction membrane proteins nor did we observe significant localization between these proteins and capsid in infected cells. claudin protein degradation occurred when epithelial cells were infected with subviral particles that lack the capsid gene. a redundant, capsid-independent claudin turnover mechanism is also involved. NV infection of MDCK and CACO-2 cells does not significantly affect production of cytokines such as TNF and interleukins. exposure to IL-1 increases levels of claudin-1 and claudin-1. a clearer understanding how WNV causes these events may lead to therapeutic treatments that block viral spread or design of attenuated vaccine strains. claudin-1 specific mouse monoclonal antibodies used respectively for immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence. rabbit and guinea pig polyclonal antibodies to WNV capsid protein were generated in this laboratory. polyclonal antibodies to DENV-2 capsid protein obtained by immunization of guinea pigs. peptide corresponding to 20 amino terminal amino acid residues of capsid protein coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. cell culture and virus infection CACO-2, MDCK and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM.
