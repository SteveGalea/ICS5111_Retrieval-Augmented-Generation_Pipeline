{"summary": "PDCoV can cause severe diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration in piglets. avian is considered to be the host for Gammacoronavirus and DCoV. PDCoV has caused serious economic losses for the pig industries. the novel swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) was also verified to be a bat-related CoV that was 98.48% identical in genome sequence to the bat HKU2-CoV. the novel swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) was also verified to be a bat-related CoV that was 98.48% identical in genome sequence to the bat HKU recent reports showed that PDCoV could infect human and chicken cells in vitro. if PDCoV really has the ability to infect chickens in vivo, the exact mechanisms of the interspecies transmission and the pathogenicity of this novel virus is largely unknown. the propagated PDCoV culture was harvested when the cytopathic effect (CPE) was >85%, and confirmed negative for PEDV, TGEV, porcine rotaviruses (groups A, B, and C), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 11-day-old chicken embryos were inoculated with 8.62 log10 genomic equivalents (GE) of PDCoV. embryos were chilled for at least 6 h at 4 \u00b0C after three days of incubation. the egg surface was cleaned with 75% ethanol. fecal samples were collected each day from challenged and control chickens for PDCoV detection until 17 dpi. for each group, three chickens were selected for necropsy at 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 17 dpi. the chickens\u2019 intestinal contents and serum were collected for virus detection. qRT-PCR was conducted using the premix ex TaqTM kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) on a real-time thermocycler (CFX96TM Optics Module, BIO-RAD) the results were analysed using the system software. the complete S gene of PDCoV was amplified using primers PDCoV-S-F4 and PDCoV-S-R4. the primers were designed based on the sequence of the PDCoV strain. the expected size of the amplicon was 3692 bp. cells and Virus The LLC-porcine kidney (LLC-PK) cells were used to serially propagate PDCoV in the current study. the virulent PDCoV HNZK-02 strain was isolated from the intestinal contents of a piglet with diarrhea in henan province in 2018. chicken Embryos\u2019 Inoculation with PDCoV Strain HNZK-02 Ninety four-day-old SPF chickens were randomly divided into two groups and housed in two separated isolators. 15 embryos of each line were used for PDCoV inoculation. each chicken was intragastrically inoculated with 300 L of PDCoV (10.5 log10 GE per chicken) or MEM. the chickens were observed and evaluated daily for temperature changes and clinical signs until 17 day post-inoculation (dpi) qRT-PCR was conducted using the Vazyme Reverse Transcription Kit. the primers targeting the PDCoV S gene were designed based on the sequence of the USA/Iowa136/2015 strain. the amplified fragment was 609 bp. chicken intestinal tissues and other major organs (lung, liver, heart, kidney, and spleen) were examined grossly and histologically, and routinely fixed in 10% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered formalin for 48 h at room temperature. slides were examined for light microscopy examination by conventional light microscopy. the amplified fragment was sequenced and assembled using DNAStar 7.0 green (DNAstar, Madison, WI, USA) the sequence data were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. the complete S gene sequence of PDCoV CC-HNZK-02 strain was deposited in GenBank under accession number MK248485.

RT-PCR detection of the virus distribution in PDCoV-inoculated chickens at 5 dpi. viral RNA could be detected at 3 dpi (5.7 log10 GE/mL) in lungs. high levels of PDCoV-specific viral RNA were detected until 17 dpi. three independent experiments were performed and there were five biological replicates in each group. the data are shown as mean values of the quintuplicate from a representative experiment with standard deviation error bars. the control group were collected at 5 dpi and stained via the hematoxylin and eosin method (H&E) the arrows indicate the typical histological lesions in the detected tissues. scale bars are shown in each picture. reference S protein sequences obtained from GenBank are indicated by strain names and GenBank accession numbers. the two mutation amino acids from S protein in the chickens are indicated with red arrows. the PDCoV strain CC-HNZK-02 from chickens was closely related with the PDCoV strain HNZK-04 strain identified by our laboratory. PDCoV is a novel swine intestine CoV and may have a broad host range. but it is still unclear whether PDCoV can infect avian species, including chickens and other poultry. a study showed that PDCoV can infect chicken embryos, and could be passaged on them. PDCoV-infected chickens shed PDCoV RNAs in intestinal contents and tissues until 17 dpi. previous reports showed that PDCoV can infect gnotobiotic and conventional piglets. a comparable low viral RNA titer was detected from fecal samples challenged with PDCoV [25], suggesting a lower replication rate of PDCoV in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs. PDCoV viral RNA was mainly detected in chicken lungs, kidneys, and multiple intestinal tissues, including cecum, jejunum, and rectum. PDCoV could infect the lung tissue in pigs and chickens, suggesting that outside of the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory tract may also be a target route for PDCoV infection. the aminopeptidase N (APN) is a protein receptor, and is targeted by a number of alphacoronaviruses. recent reports also showed that PDCoV can efficiently infect human origin cells via interacting with the human APN receptor. further molecular surveillance study and experiments on artificial infection of different animals with PDCoV are needed to investigate the inter-species transmission of PDCoV."}
