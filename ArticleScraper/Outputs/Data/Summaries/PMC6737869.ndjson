{"summary": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) are immunosuppressive viruses in cats that increase their susceptibility to zoonotic pathogens. this study aimed to determine the occurrence of one or both viruses, the risk factors associated with infection, and develop further recommendations. cats are reservoirs of zoonotic and opportunistic microorganisms such as Toxoplasma gondii, Microsporum canis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans and Mycoplasma haemofelis. infection with FIV and FeLV increases their risk of infection with those pathogens,3,5\u20138 which can be transmitted to humans. no studies have been published regarding the prevalence of FIV or FeLV in mozambique. there are 36.9 million people living globally with HIV. of those, 19.6 million (53.1%) live in Southeast Africa. a clinical examination assessed the presence of fever, lymphadenopathy, a loss of body mass and pale mucous membranes. a clinical examination assessed the presence of fever, lymphadenopathy, a loss of body mass and pale mucous membranes. each tube was properly identified after sample collection and taken immediately to the microbiology laboratory. mozambique is among the top 10 countries with the highest prevalence of HIV infection. the prevalence of HIV is 16.9% and 22.9%, respectively. data analysis Demographic and clinical data were entered into a spreadsheet and analysed using STATA software version 15.0. for data analysis, we stratified the cats according to their age as young (>6 weeks to 1 year), adult (>1\u201310 years) or geriatric (>10 years) those with clinical signs of disease were classified as clinically ill.
