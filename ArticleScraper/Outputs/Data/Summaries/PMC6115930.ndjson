{"summary": "the nuclear factor-B family is composed of five related transcription factors: p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and p52/relB. in the classical NF-B signaling pathway, signaling molecules include NF-B (IKKs), IB, p50/p65, and IKK upstream receptors and adaptor proteins. the major receptors are toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-induc NF-B inhibitors include NS3/4, 3C and 3C-like proteases, viral deubiquitinating enzymes, phosphodegron-like (PDL) motifs, viral protein phosphatase (PPase)-binding proteins, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins. NF-B activity promotes HIV-1 immune escape in different viral life cycles: productive infection and latent infection. RAF6 and RIP1 both activate the transforming growth factor (TAK1)--activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex. the activated TAK1 complex then activates IKKs. p50/p65 enters the nucleus, binds specific DNA sequences, and activates NF-B transcriptional activity. membrane-bound TNFR1 complex forms within seconds following the engagement of TNFR1 by TNF and independently recruits TNFR-associated death protein (TRADD), TRAFs and RIP1 [5] IL-1R1 shares some homology with TLRs at regions known as TIR domains. adaptor proteins are critical for activating downstream signals via specific protein\u2013protein interactions. RIP1 contains an intermediate proline-rich region (residues 103\u2013173) and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain (residues 514\u2013535) related to its mitochondrial localization. the activated IRAKs promote the oligomerization of TRAF6 to activate its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. IKKs, IB and p50/p65 The IKKs are composed of three major components. they exist in complex at a ratio of 1:1:2, that is, one IKK heterodimer binds to a NEMO dimer. NEMO is a ubiquitin-binding protein containing the conserved UBAN. degradation of IB releases p50/p65. the free p50/p65 rapidly translocates to the nucleus. phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and coactivators are essential. the activated RIG-1 translocates to the mitochondria and mitochondrial-associated membranes, where it interacts with its essential adaptor protein, namely, MAVS. the membrane-bound TNFR1 complex forms within seconds following the engagement of TNFR1 by TNF and independently recruits TNFR-associated death protein (TRADD), TRAFs and RIP1 [5] adaptor proteins are critical for activating downstream signals via specific protein\u2013protein interactions. MAVS localizes in the mitochondria, peroxisomes, and mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes. RIP1 contains an N-terminal CARD-like domain (residues 10\u201377), an intermediate proline-rich region (residues 103\u2013173) and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain (residues 514\u2013535) related to its mitochondrial localization. RIP1 is ubiquitinated by IKK and TAK1 kinase complexes. the ubiquitination of RIP1 is recognized by IKK and TAK1 kinase complexes. NEMO is a ubiquitin-binding protein containing the conserved UBAN. nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of p65 retains p50/p65 in the cytoplasm. activated IKKs phosphorylate IB, and phosphorylated IB is recognized by the -transducing repeat-containing protein (-TrCP) the degradation of IB releases p50/p65. the three mutants of NSP11 with impaired EndoU activity lost the capacity to reduce MAVS RNA expression. another NF-B inhibitor, the replication transcription activator protein (RTA) encoded by Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is an RNA-binding protein that is ubiquitous in -herpesviruses and binds to MyD88 RNA. ing pathway is employed by KSHV RTA [24,25], the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) nuclear protein ICP0 [26], the classical swine fever virus (HBV) X protein [28], and the coronavirus (CoV) helper protein open reading frame-9b [29]. KSHV RTA is not only an RNA-binding protein but also is identified to be an E3 ligase. cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major tegument protein pUL83 interacts with the interferon-inducible protein IFI16. pUL83 blocks IFI16 aggregation and subsequent NF-B signaling. MCMV protein M45 interacts with DAI and RIP1 via RHIM. hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), a nucleocapsid protein of HBV, specifically interacts with the TIR proteins Mal and TRAM, disrupting the homotypic TIR\u2013TIR interaction critical for NF-B transcriptional activity. the inhibitory effects of HBeAg are dependent on its precore-specific sequence (PSS), which is identified as being similar to the TIR motif. the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) MC005 protein binds to NEMO in a specific region where NEMO binds IKK/. MC159, another MCV protein, the vaccinia virus (VACV) protein C4 and the ORFV-encoded protein ORFV073 all interact with NEMO to inhibit NF-B activity. MC160, another MCV vFLIP, is associated with a reduction in IKK protein levels and the phosphorylation of IKK and IKK. but its DEDs are not required for this function, which is different from MC159-mediated NF-B activity. NSP1 inhibits the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IB and blocks p65 nuclear translocation. the interaction between -TrCP and the SCF-TrCP complex is diminished. multiple viral proteins bind p50 and p65 to prevent NF-B from entering the nucleus. other proteins encoded by UL24, UL42, and ICP0 all bind to p50/p65. MC132 interacts with p65 and recruits it to the host ubiquitin ligase complex. p65 ubiquitination and degradation occurs through recruiting p65 to the host Elongin-B/Elongin-C/Cullin-5 ubiquitin ligase complex. these processes occur in the nucleus, blocking binding to B sequences. NS1 and NS1-70 proteins both interact with nuclear p65 RHD. CREB-binding protein VP16 binds to p65, likely sequesters CBP. a viral immune evasion strategy of NF-B inhibition is to target receptors and adaptor proteins. replication transcription activator protein (RTA) encoded by Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an RNA-binding protein that is ubiquitous in -herpesviruses and binds to MyD88 RNA, inhibiting the RNA synthesis of MyD88 [21]. however, the nature of the RNA-binding activity and the detailed mechanism for the regulation of myD88 RNA synthesis require further investigation. KSHV RTA targets MyD88 and TRIF, HSV ICP0 targets MyD88 and TIRAP, CSFV NS3 targets TRAF6 and HBX and CoV ORF-9b both target MAVS. RTA directly interacts with MyD88 to promote polyubiquitination of MyD88, degrading MyD88 via the proteasome pathway. small amounts of ICP0 present in the cytoplasm are still sufficient to effect the inhibition of TLR2 signaling. viruses also interfere with the functions of receptors and adaptor proteins by interacting with them. pUL83 blocks IFI16 aggregation and subsequent NF-B signaling. the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) virulence factor M2-2 binds to MAVS to block MAVS-mediated NF-B activation. NEMO acts as a scaffold protein for the IKK complex and mediates interactions with upstream signaling molecules. MC159 belongs to a group of proteins collectively known as viral FLICE-like inhibiting proteins (vFLIPs) another MCV protein, the vaccinia virus (VACV) protein C4 [43] and the ORFV-encoded protein ORFV073 [44] all interact with NEMO to inhibit NF-B activity. the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) NSP1 inhibits the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IB and blocks p65 nuclear translocation. however, NSP1 neither interferes with the phosphorylation of IKK/IKK nor interacts with IB or IKK/IKK. multiple viral proteins bind p50/p65 to prevent NF-B from entering the nucleus. p50/p65 dimer must enter the nucleus, thus retaining p50/p65 in the cytoplasm as an effective means of inhibiting NF-B transcriptional activity. murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) ORF73 protein [66] and its homologous protein, KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA-1) [67] both cause p65 ubiquitination and degradation through recruiting p65 to the host Elongin-B/Elongin-C/Cullin-5 ubiquitin ligase complex. these processes occur in the nucleus, blocking p65 binding to B sequences NS3/4A is a complex composed of NS3 and cofactor NS4A. the consensus cleavage sequence of NS3/4A is D/E-X-X-X-X-X-C/T|S/A-X-X-X. the cleavage sequence (E-R-E-V-P-C|H-R-P-S) is not a classical cleavage sequence of NS3/4A. NS3/4A has membrane-targeting domains within NS4A and at the amphipathic helix 0 of NS3, is located in intracellular membranes. the 3C protease has a clear preference for substrate cleavage sites at Q and E. the coxsackievirus (CV) B3 3C protease cleaves MAVS at Q148 and TRIF at Q190, Q653, and Q671 [80] the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 3C protease cleaves NEMO at Q383 [84] and the hepatitis A virus (HAV) the K48-linked polyubiquitination of IB occurs in a degradation-independent manner to release NF-B from IB. other types of ubiquitination, including the K48-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1, and M1- and K63-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO, occur in a degradation-independent manner. HCMV UL48, HSV-1 UL36, KSHV ORF64, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus BPLF1 are all tegument proteins. UL45 enhances UL48 activity to cleave RIP1 polyubiquitin chains. phosphodegron motif DpSGLDpS is recognized by -TrCP. both serine residues of the PDL motif are phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) in a pattern mimicking phosphorylation of IB. the RING domain interacts with Cullin RING ligase (CRL) complexes. the simian varicella virus (SVV) ORF61 and HSV-1 ICP0 represent a PDL motif. PP1-interacting proteins recruit both IKK/ and PP1, forming a complex to dephosphorylate IKK [109,110]. PP4R1/PP4C/PP2A A phosphatase complex, which interacts with NEMO. proteases Encoded by Viruses Virus-encoded proteases can cleave specific amino acid sites and cut a polypeptide into multiple small peptides. they play key roles in viral replication, such as in the separation of structural and nonstructural proteins. NS3/4A is a complex composed of NS3 and cofactor NS4A. pathic helix 0 of NS3 targets membrane-anchored proteins. NS3/4A cleaves MAVS at Cys508 adjacent to the TM domain. NS3/4A dislocates MAVS from the membrane via membrane-targeting domains. electrostatic networks correlate with affinity of MAVS for binding to NS3/4A. the coxsackievirus (CV) B3 3C protease cleaves MAVS at Q148 and TRIF at Q190, Q653, and Q671 [80]. the EV68 3C protease cleaves TRIF at Q312 [87], TAK1 at Q360, TAB2 at Q113, TAB1 at both 414 and Q451, and TAB3 at Q304 [85]. the cleavage sequence of TRIF (P-S-S-T-P-C|S-A-H-L) by NS3/4A is similar to the classical cleavage sequence specifically found in NS4B/5A, a viral substrate of NS3/4A. however, the MAVS cleavage sequence (E-R-E-E-V-P-C|H-R-P-S) is not a classical cleavage sequence of picornavirus 3C protease has a typical G-X-C-G motif and a C-H-D/E catalytic center. the 3C protease can cleave important signaling molecules of the NF-B signaling pathway to complete viral replication. the 3C protease has a clear preference for substrate cleavage sites at Q and E. PRRSV and NSP5 of PEDV both cleave NEMO, NSP4 at E349 [88] and NSP5 at Q231 [89]. 4.2. DUBs Encoded by Viruses Ubiquitination plays an important role in regulating the activation of NF-B in both a degradation-dependent and a degradation-independent manner. HCMV UL48, HSV-1 UL36, KSHV ORF64, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) BPLF1 are all tegument proteins. the HCMV UL48 interacts with RIP1, cleaves its K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, and inhibits NF-B activity. PRRSV NSP2 of equine arterivirus (EAV) adopts a compact OTU domain DUB fold with a unique integral zinc finger. the zinc-dependent OTU may offer a structure-guided approach for the inhibition of NF-B by the arterivirus PLP2 but its exact mechanism needs to be further illuminated. motif DpSGXpS is recognized by -TrCP upon phosphorylation of the two serines. the rotavirus (RV) NSP1 contains a C-terminal PDL motif (DSGXS) and an N-terminal RING domain. both serine residues of the PDL motif are phosphorylated by casein kinase II. amino acids 7 to 12 of the VACV protein A49 (SGNLES) and amino acids 52 to 56 of the HIV-1 protein Vpu (SGNES) are both identified as PDL motifs. phosphorylation of IKKs, especially IKK, is mediated by autophosphorylation and TAK1 but also by PPase. ncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) and hMPV [118] have been reported to inhibit NF-B activation. the muV SH protein coimmunoprecipitates with TNFR1, RIP1 and IRAK1. therefore, the muV SH protein inhibits the activation of NF-B by interacting with the TNFR1, IL-1R1 and TLR3 complexes in the membranes of in the mutation of two serines in HIV-1 NL4.3 Vpu abolishes its capacity to inhibit NF-B activity and NF-B-dependent antiviral gene expression. however, the mutation of these serine residues to alanine in primary HIV-1 (CH106) Vpu reduces, but does not fully disrupt, the capacity of the virus to suppress NF-B activity. virus is stably integrated into the host cell genome, but cannot produce new virus. the integrated provirus is maintained in the latent state by several means. positive transcription factors contain NF-B because the long terminal repeats (LTRs), which act as promoters and enhancers of HIV-1, include B-binding sequences. in CYLD knockdown cells, NF-B p65 nuclear translocation significantly increases. increased HIV-1 transcription in CYLD knockdown cells is NF-B dependent. cellular miR-155 interacts with the 3\u2019-UTR of TRIM32 to suppress its expression. NF-B plays a vital role in the antiviral immune response. to survive, it is essential for viruses to suppress NF-B activity. to do so, viruses encode several specific NF-B inhibitors. ubiquitination IB [55] SVV ORF61 Binds to -TrCP and interferes with IB ubiquitination IB [55] HCMV pUL83 Blocks IFI16 pyrin aggregation IFI16 [31] UL26 Decreases phosphorylation of IKK and IKK IKK, IKK [49] UL48 Cleaves K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of RIP1 TRIF [80] EV71 2C Interacts with the IPI domain of p65; recruits both IKK/ and PP1 to dephosphorylate IKK p65, IKK [63,110] 3C Cleaves TRIF, TAK1, TAB1, TAB2, and TAB3 TRIF, TAK1, TAB1, TAB2, TAB3 [82,87] EV68 3C Cleaves TRIF TRIF [81] FM RV NSP1 Binds to -TrCP and interferes with degradation of IB IB [100,101,102,103] PEDV NSP1 Inhibits the phosphorylation and degradation of IB IB [54] NSP5 Cleaves NEMO NEMO [89] PRRSV NSP11 Reduces the mRNA levels of both MAVS and RIG-I MAVS, RIG-I [20] NSP4 Cleaves NEMO phosphorylation of IKK and IKK IKK, IKK [51,52] MC132 Causes p65 ubiquitination and degradation p65 [65] VACV C4 Interacts with NEMO and IKK NEMO, IKK [43] B14 Prevents IKK phosphorylation and activation IKK [45,46,47,48] A49 Binds to -TrCP and diminishes degradation of IB IB [104] virus encodes multiple proteins to inhibit NF-B in different ways. ICP0, UL24, UL36, UL42, VP16 and 134.5 all interact with p50 and p65, blocking p50/p65. tegument protein VP16 binds to p65 in the nucleus, likely sequesters CBP, and then blocks the induction of the NF-B promoter. late protein 134.5 recruits both IKK/ and PP1 to dephosphorylate IKK, thus inhibiting the activation of NF-B. viral immunopathogenesis involves a balance between the activation and inhibition of NF-B activity in multiple ways. viral immunopathogenesis is a dynamic balance between activation and inhibition NF-B. in this review, we focused on viral immune evasion via suppression of NF-B activity."}
