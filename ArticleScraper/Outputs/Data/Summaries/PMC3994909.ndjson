{"summary": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the genus Henipavirus (family of Paramyxoviridae) that causes severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans. the first human cases of NiV were identified during an outbreak of severe febrile encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998\u20131999.1. 2.9 Southern Research Institute and the University of Texas Medical Branch collaborated to establish a BSL-4 HTS platform. the platform provides HTS expertise, compound libraries, and bioinformatics support. the platform was validated by the pilot screening of 10,000 compounds from the Enamine Diversity Library against NiV. cells were expanded to passage 16 and then frozen in 95% FBS/5% DMSO for direct use in the screen. confluent monolayers of vero cells were infected with serial 10-fold dilutions of culture supernatant. cells were incubated for 3 days at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the final compound concentration used in primary screening was 12.5 g/mL. cell and virus stocks were thawed, and cells were diluted to 150,000 cells/mL. the plates were incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the primary screen was read by luminescence detection using an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA) with an integration time of 0.1 s. the primary screen was performed in two sets: the first contained 12 plates and the second set contained 24 plates. a 10-point concentration response assay was done to determine the 50% effective concentration (EC50) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values for each active compound. final screening concentration ranged from 25 to 0.05 g/mL. a final DMSO concentration of 0.25% was performed. EC50 values were calculated for compounds inhibiting viral-induced CPE by at least 30% using IDBS\u2019 XLfit function 205, y=A+(BA)/[1+(C/x)D], with minimum (A) and maximum (B) parameters set at 0 and 100. encephalitis (strain TC-83) were performed as previously described. 13,14,23 Cell Culture Vero cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. for production of virus, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin were added to the media. plaques were counted and virus titers were expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. all work with infectious virus was carried out in a class II biosafety cabinet. all dispensing was done using a Matrix WellMateTM noncontact liquid handler. final assay conditions were 4500 cells per well, 75 nL of compound or DMSO (12.5 g/mL compound and 0.25% DMSO) and virus at an MOI of 0.006 in 30 L. plates were read by luminescence detection using an Envision plate reader. control wells in rows A-B (1\u201324) for uninfected cell controls (48 wells) peristaltic noncontact dispenser. columns 1, 2, 23, 24 (c\u2013p) for infected cell controls (56 wells) 100 L of the viral supernatants was serially 10-fold diluted and inoculated onto a vero cell monolayer in 96-well tissue culture plates. plates were further incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 72 h. the reduction in TCID50 values was compared to that obtained from parallel cultures with virus and DMSO vehicle only. c is the mean cell control signal, v is the mean virus control signal. v is the standard deviation of the virus control signal; v is the standard deviation of the virus control signal; v is the mean virus control signal; v is the standard deviation of the virus control signal; v is the standard deviation of the virus control signal. we used a virus MOI that reproducibly caused >90% CPE in the Vero cells at endpoint (72 h) the MOI allowed for multiple cycles of viral replication. the criteria for successful adaptation were a mean CV of positive cell controls less than 10%, a S/B >3 and minimal plate patterns and bias. the NiV antiviral primary assay has a broad signal window with low plate-to-plate standard deviations and excellent reproducibility. assays that produce Z values above 0.5 are considered suitable for HTS. the d virus-induced CPE by each compound is shown. the 36 plate pilot primary screen was run to validate assay performance. each of the 36 assay plates contained 280 compounds, 48 cell control wells, and 56 virus controls. a total of 10,080 compounds were screened. the 120 hits, nine compounds were repurchased as dry powders. the three most potent hit compounds were further evaluated manually. they were also tested in virus titer reduction assays and for broad spectrum antiviral activity against a panel of other viruses. EC50 values were calculated using IDBS\u2019 XLfit equation 205: y=A+[(BA]/1+[(C/x)D], with minimum (A) and maximum (B) parameters set at 0 and 100, respectively. standard deviation values were derived from three independent experiments. si, selectivity index. Fig. 3. Reduction of virus titer by 10- to 300-fold. no antiviral activity was observed against any of these viruses. no antiviral activity was observed against any of these viruses. this suggests that the hit compounds showed specific activities against NiV and perhaps other closely related henipaviruses. assay development was done manually in 96-well format. the assay was adapted to a 384-well microplate format. the criteria for successful adaptation were a mean CV of positive cells less than 10%, a S/B >3 and minimal plate patterns and bias. data from the Z plates were used to further evaluate coefficient of variation (CV), Z-factor, S/B, and plate well bias. values above 0.5 are considered suitable for a large HTS. the Z-factor provides a quantitative means to measure the suitability of a particular assay for use in a large HTS. for our primary assay, the low standard deviations of the controls and the large signal window contributed to a mean Z-factor of 0.74. assays that produce Z values above 0.5 are considered suitable for HTS. the primary screen was performed in two sets: the first set contained 12 plates and the second set contained 24 plates. the data from the different sets for the primary screen are indicated by shading and labels. cytotoxicity assays with NiV confirmed that these compounds have promising anti-Nipah activity with EC50 values of 3.9 M (SI >40), 11.7 M (SI >12) and 7.8 M (SI >18). titers of progeny viruses were compared in a titrated CPE assay. cells were treated with 5 times EC50 of each compound and immediately infected with 100 PFU/100 L (MOI=0.02) of NiV. after 72 h, the cellular supernatants were assayed for virus titer. to identify the stage in the NiV replication cycle, we performed parallel time of addition experiments (in triplicate) for each of the three hit compounds. time-of-addition experiments showed that all three compounds inhibit NiV infection when added up to 6 h postinfection. this suggests that each compound targets a later stage of virus replication rather than the earlier entry stages. a major drawback in the use of these artificial systems is that they may not accurately represent the response of fully virulent BSL-4 pathogens to the compounds. the assay was adapted and validated in a high biocontainment facility, making it possible to screen large compound libraries directly against wild-type viruses. this capability of utilizing wild-type viruses instead of surrogates reduces the time required for effective drug development. a simple one-step protocol using flexible and stable luminescent signal is considered an adequate detection window. a S/B value greater than 5 is considered as an adequate detection window. a lower confirmation rate of this assay (45%) is due to the concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of the other hit compounds. southern research institute has successfully implemented an HTS platform in BSL-4 containment using NiV virus as a prototype BSL-4 virus. the platform allows us to screen wild-type virus strains instead of pseudotype, surrogate, or recombinantly attenuated viruses that have been downgraded for use at lower biocontainment levels. the dual threat of emerging pathogens that exhibit high mobidity and mortality makes the development of antiviral therapy an increasingly critical need."}
