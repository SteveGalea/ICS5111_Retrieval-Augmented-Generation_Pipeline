{"summary": "lung biopsy specimens from five patients with ARDS with confirmed H1N1 underwent microbiologic analysis. pathological features observed were necrotizing bronchiolitis, diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage and abnormal immune response. acute respiratory failure (ARF) requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) in 15\u201330% of previously healthy young to middleaged people.3,4,7,8 Death may occur when coinfections or lung injury prevail over the immune response, resulting in a progressive worsening of lung function. METHODS Patients and Collection of Specimens We studied pathologically and ultrastructurally five patients suspected of having a pandemic SOIV virus who developed ARF requiring ventilatory support. these patients had a severe evolution of the virus and more information about the physiopathology of the disease was required. 0 = normal lung parenchyma, 1 = changes in 1\u201325%, 2 = changes in 26\u201350%, 3 = changes in 51\u201375%, and 4 = changes in 76\u2013100% of examined tissue. this semiquantitative analysis is currently routinely used in most studies of the university of so Paulo Medical School. immunohistochemical reactions were carried out in accordance with manufacturer's instruction. cell immunophenotypes and immune expression of cells were graded according to a fivepoint semiquantitative intensitybased scoring system. a five-point semiquantitative severity-based scoring system was used. the results were graded according to a fivepoint semiquantitative severity-based scoring system. the patients had a severe evolution of the virus and more information about the physiopathology of the disease was required. semiquantitative analysis is routinely used in most studies of the department of pathology of the university of so Paulo Medical School. the avidin\u2013biotin\u2013peroxidase complex and streptavidin\u2013biotin enzyme complex immunostaining methods were used with antibodies against lymphocytes CD4 (clone: MO834, dilution 1:1000), CD8 (clone: M7103, dilution 120), CD68 (clone: M814, d immunohistochemical reactions were carried out in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. cell immunophenotypes and immune expression of cells were graded according to a fivepoint semiquantitative intensitybased scoring system. all five patients received 75 mg twice a day by nasal enteral tube of olsetamivir (range 4\u201314 days; median 10) and intravenous steroids (range 9\u201320 days; median 12) the presence of the virus was confirmed in all five patients. patients 1, 2 and 4 are alive, but patients 3 and 5 died of respiratory failure. the main pathological features were necrotizing bronchiolitis, clastogenic diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and alveolar hemorrhage. there was interstitial thickening, with mild to moderate fibroplasia (Figure 1I), but a disproportionately sparse infiltrate of inflammatory cells, mainly histiocytes. pulmonary parenchyma modified by extensive alveolar lesion characterized by extensive alveolar hemorrhage (A), disproportionately sparse infiltrate of inflammatory cells (B) and collapse alveolar areas with dilatation of the airspaces ( airspaces 3 (2\u20134) 2.5 (2\u20133) 2 (1\u20133) 2 (1\u20133) Hyaline membrane 1.5 (1\u20132) 2 (2\u20132) 1.5 (1\u20132) 2 (1\u20132) 2 (1\u20133) Alveolar hemorrhage 3 (2\u20134) 3 (3\u20133) 3.5 (3\u20134) 2 (1\u20133) 4 (4\u20134) Fibroplasia 2 (1\u20133) 2 (1\u20133) 2 (1\u20133) 1 (1\u20131) 0 (0\u20130) Multinucleated forms 2 (1\u20133) 1 (0\u20132) patients 3 and 5 presented more prominent changes at submicroscopic level. Cytoplasmic swelling, necrosis, and degenerative changes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles were present in bronchial and AECs. a large number of bronchiolar and AECs were detached from the basement membrane and were showing apoptosis. multinucleated AECII 2 (1\u20133) 1.5 (1\u20132) 2 (2\u20132) 1 (0\u20132) 1 (1\u20133) The lung tissue score was obtained independently by two different investigators. the pathologic findings were graded according to a fivepoint semiquantitative severitybased scoring system. the regenerating bronchiolar epithelium extended along the adjacent alveolar septa showing features of cells with prominent surface microvilli with decreased or absent lamellar bodies. increased myofibroblasts and collagen fibers were also present. 68 (A), CD4+ (B), CD8+ (C), CD20+ (D), NK+ (E) and S100+ (F) present around vessels and bronchioles. note strong expression of IL4 (G), IL10 (H) and iNOS (I) in macrophages. four (4\u20134) 3 (2\u20134) 3.5 (3\u20134) The lung tissue score was graded according to a fivepoint semiquantitative severitybased scoring system. the pathologic findings were graded according to a fivepoint semiquantitative severitybased scoring system. the presence of the H1N1 virus was confirmed in all five patients (Table 1) by nasal swab or lung tissue positivity of RTPCR. other microbiological investigations, including isolation of other viruses, were negative. the main pathological features were necrotizing bronchiolitis, clastogenic diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and alveolar hemorrhage. the membranous and respiratory bronchioles were extensively compromised by epithelial necrosis, squamous metaplasia, and obliteration by fibroplasia. atypical forms included multinucleated giant cells with granular amphophilic cytoplasm, irregular, large and atypical nuclei and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli (arrows) (K to M), (Hematoxilyn Eosin) the pathologic findings were graded according to a fivepoint semiquantitative severitybased scoring system. atypical bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) were seen in all five patients. bronchial and alveolar epithelium necrosis were seen in all five patients. patients 3 and 5 presented more prominent changes at submicroscopic level.
