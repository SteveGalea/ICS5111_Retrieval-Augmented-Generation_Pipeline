{"summary": "RT-PCR with consensus primers amplifying a 155-bp fragment in the L gene of morbilliviruses was positive in samples from 56 (12.3%) of 457 stray cats captured from various locations in Hong Kong over a 2-y period (March 2009 to February 2011) one (6.25%) was RT-PCR\u2013positive in both its oral and rectal swabs. avian paramyxoviruses 3 (681\u2013707 nt) and 5 (552 nt) and Tupaia paramyxovirus (590 nt; Fig. S2). such long trailer sequences of larger than 400 nt have been observed only in avian paramyxoviruses. the conserved N-terminal motif MA(T/S)L in morbilliviruses was absent in the nucleoprotein (N) of FmoPV, which contained the sequence MSSL as a result of A-to-S (G-to-U at first codon position) substitution at the second amino acid. a leucine-rich motif at amino acid positions 4 to 11 is also identified in the N protein of FmoPV. a small cDNA fragment including the UC-rich region was amplified, cloned, and sequenced by using mRNA extracted from FmoPV infected CRFK cells. 13 contained the sequence TTAAAAGGGG (without G insertion, encoding P protein) 10 contained the sequence TTAAAAGGGGG (one G inserted, encoding V protein) ed with morbilliviruses, with high bootstrap supports, forming a distinct subgroup. trees were constructed by maximum likelihood method with bootstrap values calculated from 1,000 trees. three strains from FmoPV were named as 761U, 776U, and M252A. EM showed an enveloped virus with the typical \u201cherringbone\u201d appearance of helical N in paramyxoviruses. no CPE and no viruses were detected by RT-PCR. necropsies were performed on two euthanized stray cats positive for FmoPV. immunohistochemical staining of organs revealed interstitial inflammatory infiltrate and renal tubular degeneration or necrosis in their kidneys. also marked decrease in cauxin expression in the degenerated tubular epithelial cells compatible with TIN. a total of 27 stray cats were subjected to RT-PCR, histopathologic examination, and antibody detection by Western blot and immunofluorescence. TIN was observed in seven of 12 cats with evidence of FmoPV infection, but in only two of 15 cats without evidence of FmoPV infection. RT-PCR with consensus primers amplifying a 155-bp fragment in the L gene of morbilliviruses was positive in samples from genome size of FmoPV is 16,050 bases, and G+C contents are 35.1% to 35.3%. genome of FmoPV conforms to rule of six, as in other paramyxoviruses. the conserved N-terminal motif MA(T/S)L in morbilliviruses was absent in the nucleoprotein (N) of FmoPV. a leucine/isoleucine-rich motif at amino acid positions 70 to 77 is also identified in the N protein of FmoPV. in all three strains of FmoPV, this common N-terminal region consists of 226 aa. a small cDNA fragment including the UC-rich region was amplified, cloned, and sequenced by using mRNA extracted from infected CRFK cells. the sequence TTAnGn is conserved as in other paramyxovirus editing sites except for rubulaviruses. Phylogenetic trees constructed using predicted amino acid sequences of N, P, M, F, A, and L genes of FmoPV. the three viruses were clustered with morbilliviruses, with high bootstrap supports, forming a distinct subgroup. at the 16th passage, CPEs were evident at day 14. RT-PCR for FmoPV using culture supernatants showed positive results. virions are highly variable in size, ranging approximately from 130 to 380 nm in diameter. necropsies were performed on two euthanized stray cats positive for FmoPV. histological examination revealed interstitial inflammatory infiltrate and renal tubular degeneration or necrosis. immunohistochemical staining of lymph node sections of stray cat positive for FmoPV using guinea pig serum positive for anti-FmoPV N protein antibody and preimmune guinea pig serum. TIN was observed in seven of 12 cats with evidence of FmoPV infection, but in only two of 15 cats without evidence of FmoPV infection. three strains of FmoPV exhibited high sequence similarity and identical genome organization, suggesting a single species of FmoPV and a high degree of species-specificity in FmoPV. other viruses from cats, such as feline coronaviruses and feline papillomavirus, have been shown to be closely related to or recombine with their canine counterpart in dogs. cats vaccinated with CRFK cell lysates developed antibodies to both CRFK and kidney cell lysates. half of these cats sensitized to CRFK lysates on multiple occasions developed TIN at 2 wk postsensitization. the number of pet shops selling cats and dogs has increased from 77 in 2000 to 155 in 2009. the number of locally licensed pet shops selling cats and dogs has increased from 77 in 2000 to 155 in 2009. the number of local pet shops selling cats and dogs has increased from 77 in 2000 to 155 in 2009. the agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong provided samples collected from the 457 stray cats as part of a surveillance program. oral and rectal swabs from 16 diseased cats from mainland China were also collected. real-time quantitative RT-PCR to detect L gene of FmoPV was performed on the 56 positive samples. cDNA was amplified by LightCyler. FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Mix reagent kit (Roche), with primers. LPW12491, 5\u2032-CCACCCATCGGGTACTT-3\u2032. Primers (5\u2032-TTCATCTCTCTTAGTTCCCAGGAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTTCAGACTCACCCTCGATATCT-3\u2032) were used to amplify a 442-bp product of FmoPV covering the putative editing site. PCR, cloning and sequencing were performed as described in previous publications. Western blot analysis was performed by using 1,000 ng purified (His)6-tagged recombinant N protein, 1:1,000 dilutions of cat plasma samples, 1:4,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-cat IgG antibody, and 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-cat IgM antibody (Bethyl) fixed cells were incubated with 1:200 dilution of guinea pig antiserum against the N protein of FmoPV, followed by 1:50 diluted FITC-rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG (Invitrogen) cells were then examined under a fluorescence microscope. uninfected cells were used as negative control. the sections were incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight with 1:250 dilution of guinea pig anti-N protein antiserum, followed by incubation of 30 min at room temperature with 1:500 dilution of biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG, H and L chain (Abcam). color development was performed by using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine and images were captured with a Nikon 80i imaging RT-PCR of L Gene of Morbilliviruses was performed by amplifying a 155-bp fragment of L gene of morbilliviruses by using conserved primers. cDNA was amplified by LightCyler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Mix reagent kit (Roche) 2 L of cDNA, 4 mmol/L MgCl2 and 0.5 mmol/L primers at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 5 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 8 s. plasmid containing target sequence was used for generation of standard curves. mRNA from original specimens was extracted by using the Oligotex mRNA Mini kit (Qia antiserum against the N protein of FmoPV was produced by injecting 100 g purified N protein of FmoPV. incomplete Freund adjuvant (Sigma) was used in subsequent immunizations. three inoculations at once every 2 wk per guinea pig were administered. four hundred microliters of the mixture was added to 24-well tissue culture plates. the mixture was replaced by 1 mL of serum-free MEM. culture lysates were collected for RT-PCR for FmoPV. dilutions of plasma from 1:10 to 1:10,240 from 27 cats with necropsies followed by 1:20 diluted FITC-goat anti-cat IgG (Sigma) cells were then examined under a fluorescence microscope. cells were then used as negative control. expression of FmoPV N protein was examined by immunohistochemical staining. MAC387 (DakoCyomation) was labeled with Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (47). Cauxin protein expression was detected according to a published protocol (48)."}
