{"summary": "NS1 antigen (Ag) tests have limited sensitivity to DENV-4 serotype compared to the other three serotypes. an NS1 capture enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) specific to DENV-4 may improve the detection of DENV-4 cases worldwide. NS1 capture ELISA: MAb 8A6F2 as the capture antibody and 6D4B10 as a detection antibody. ELISA was sensitive and specific to DENV-4 with no cross-reactivity to other three DENV (1\u20133) serotypes and other heterologous flaviviruses."}
