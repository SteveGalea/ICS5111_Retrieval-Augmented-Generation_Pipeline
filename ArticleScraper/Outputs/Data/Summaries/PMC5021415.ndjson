{"summary": "ART enzymes covalently attach the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ to either amino acid side chain of a target protein or a growing poly(ADP-ribose) chain. at least four families of protein modules bind ADP-ribose and its metabolites. they participate in a variety of cellular processes, such as DNA damage response, protein stability, assembly of stress granules, chromatin structure, and cell death. predicted macro domain (amino acids [aa] 789 to 902) and Hel domain (amino acids 974 to 1185) inside ORF1 of the HEV genome (MeT, methyltransferase; Y, Y domain; PCP, papain-like cysteine protease; V, hypervariable proline-rich hinge; macro: macro domain; Hel, helicase; RdRP, RNA-dependent RNA polyme a set of positive-strand RNA viruses encode a macro domain. the crystal structures of macro domains from several coronaviruses have been determined with and without bound ADP-ribose (8, 12) these studies suggest a close phylogenetic and most probably functional relationship between viral and cellular macro domains. the genome contains three open reading frames (ORFs) of which ORF1 encodes the nonstructural protein, ORF2 encodes the capsid protein, and ORF3 encodes a small multifunctional protein (21). the HEV macro domain is endowed with A1\u2032\u2032Pase activity. it binds to poly(A) and poly(A) in vitro (8, 9) and is a putative IFN antagonist that modulates the host immune response. radiolabeled PAR was synthesized by auto-ADP-ribosylation of the catalytic fragment of PARP5a (29). a 500-l reaction mixture containing 2 M PARP5, 200 M NAD+, 50 Ci of [32P]NAD+ (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer), 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT synthetic PAR concentration was determined using the following equation: [PAR] = (A258) cm1/(13,500 cm1 M1) Binding to a macro domain-Hel fusion (macro-Hel) used fluorescein-labeled RNA (Cy3-5\u2032-CCAGGCGACAUCAGCG-3\u2032) in fluorescence polarization (FP) assays and standard procedures with a microplate reader. de-MARylation and de-PARylation reactions were performed at 30\u00b0C for 30 min or 1 h. unless stated otherwise, de-MARylation and de-PARylation reactions were performed at 30\u00b0C for 30 min. d to SDS-PAGE (10%) to analyze remaining radioactive signal of either PARP15 or PARP5. the second half was loaded on a 7 M urea-PAGE (20%) gel to resolve the released products, mono- and/or poly(ADP-ribose), which were autoradiographed. a 500-l reaction mixture containing 2 M PARP5, 200 M NAD+, 50 Ci of [32P]NAD+ (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer), 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. the membrane was blocked for 1 h in TBS-T (10 mM Tris [ the membrane was incubated for 1 h with the poly(ADP-ribose) preparation (500 l) diluted in 30 ml of TBS-T, subjected to three 10-min washes in TBS-T, dried, and autoradiographed. competitive binding assays between poly(ADP-ribose) and RNA to macro-Hel. 0.1 M PARP1 was used in a 20-l final volume with either a 0.5 M or 5 M NAD+ concentration, including [32P]NAD+. the reaction was terminated with PARP1 inhibitor PJ34 (2.5 M) to avoid additional PARylation activity that could compete with the de-PARylation reaction. de-MARylation and de-PARylation reactions were performed at 30\u00b0C for 30 min or 1 h for 30 min or 1 h. results were normalized to the value of the negative control (wild type) 431A Helicase domain 99.2 11.5 a compared to that of the wild-type macro-Hel, set at 100%. replicon-encoding plasmid was a kind gift from Suzanne U. Emerson. poly(ADP-ribose) competitively inhibits the binding of Cy3-labeled RNA to macro-Hel. mutations within the helicase domain significantly decreased the binding of macro-Hel to PAR. domain in cis removes PAR from poly(ADP)-ribosylated ART substrates. macro domain and macro-Hel proteins remove PAR chains from poly(ADP)-ribosylated PARP5a. substitution of the three conserved glycines decrease this activity. domain, Hel (Hel-His-Trx), macro-Hel wild type and mutants G50A, G48S-G49S-G50A, and G48S-G49S (A); de-MARylation of the PARP15 catalytic domain by the human PARG, the macro domain, Hel, macro-Hel as well as by the VEEV and SARS macro domains on mono-ADP-ribosylated. macro domains of VEEV, SARS-CoV, and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) were assayed using ADP-ribosylated PARP1 and PARP10 catalytic domains. the macro domain from the mildly pathogenic HCoV-229E does not show significant activity on PARP1 specifically. the Y125A mutation yielded an inactive enzyme (data not shown) but the purified protein behaved anomalously in solution, an indication that it was probably misfolded. the catalytic activity of Y125F is comparable to that of the wild-type protein. the double G48S-G49S substitution dramatically decreased the de-MARylation activity. the presence of the Hel domain stimulates de-PARylation through PAR binding, whereas it has no effect on de-MARylation. we propose that the presence of the Hel domain stimulates de-PARylation through PAR binding. amino acids involved in de-MARylation and de-PARylation are essential for HEV replication. a single amino acid K215A or R321A substitution within the nucleoside triphosphate-binding/hydrolysis site completely abrogated HEV replication in Huh7 cells. the first group comprises poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases like PARG and ARH3 which act on the glycosidic ribose-ribose bond to leave MARylated proteins. the second group comprises ADP-ribose protein hydrolases like ARH1 (35), MacroD2 (11), and TARG1/c6orf130 (5), which cleave an ADP-ribose-ribo a close-up of the VEEV macro domain active site and a proposal for a catalytic mechanism are presented in Fig. 6B and C. the VEEV macro domain binds ADP-ribose in a deep cleft; the ADP-ribose is tightly coordinated by N24, G31, G32, G112, and F114. poly(ADP-ribose) competitively inhibits the binding of macro-Hel to free PAR. poly(ADP-ribose) competitively inhibits the binding of macro-Hel to free PAR. macro-Hel and macro-Hel proteins remove PAR chains from poly(ADP)-ribosylated PARP5a. helicases bind RNA and DNA to macro-Hel, with a potency similar to that of RNA. we measured the de-MARylation activity of the macro domain and macro-Hel. we measured the effects of the macro domain and macro-Hel on PARylated PARP5 and PARP 1 and on MARylated PARP15 and PARP10. Hel domains remove mono-ADP-ribose from a radiolabeled PARP15 catalytic domain. macro domains of VEEV and SARS-CoV have slightly higher ability to excise mono-ADP-ribose from PARP15 than the HEV macro domain. reversal of ADP-ribosylation from proteins is a common function carried by viral macro domains. amino acid substitutions were introduced into the macro-Hel domain to determine critical amino acids for macro-Hel-mediated de-MARylation of PARP15. the N42A, G50A, G123A, and I124A substitutions moderately decreased the catalytic activity of macro-Hel toward mono-ADP-ribosylated PARP15. these results suggest that N42, G50, and G123 are critical for substrate binding, thereby moderating cata mono-ADP-ribosylated PARP15 (A) and poly(ADP)-ribosylated PARP5a (B) catalytic domains were incubated with 100 nM macro domain or macro-Hel at 30\u00b0C for 1 h or 2 h. the auto-ADP-ribosylated PARP5a or -15 catalytic domain was incubated with 100 nM macro domain or macro-Hel at 30 TP binding Motif Va 39.0 4.2 120.7 2.7 R401A ssRNA binding Motif VI 72.6 8.6 90.7 2.6 D431A NDc 79.0 2.5 59 3.6 a The function and location of mutated residues were predicted based on the sequence alignment with the SF1 helicase from tomato mosaic virus (50). fected with HEV genotype 1 Sar55/S17/luc wild-type (WT) or capped mutant replicon RNA. the putative catalytic mechanism de-MARylation is consistent with the known A1\u2032\u2032Pase activity. all of these proteins can be classified into two main groups. a close-up of the VEEV macro domain active site and proposed catalytic mechanism for the hydrolase activity are presented in Fig. 6B and C. a close-up of the VEEV macro domain active site and a proposal for a catalytic mechanism for the hydrolase activity. DISCUSSION The macro domain is an example of a very conserved protein domain through evolution in all kingdoms of life. all macro domains contain a typical protein fold with a deep ADP-ribose binding crevice. the last activity is generally found in the nucleus for intron processing where rapid turnover of ADP-ribose metabolites may fine-tune cellular ADP-ribose pools. the de-MARylation activity is a common feature of at least one macro domain. the macro-Hel construct binds PAR and RNA at the micromolar range. most viral macro domains so far are homologous to the human MacroD2 type. the absence of de-MARylation activity of Ymx7 from S. cerevisiae (36) confirms that an aromatic ring at position 125 (HEV numbering) is essential for the removal of mono- or poly(ADP-ribose) by MacroD2-like macro domains. some of these ARTs exert antiviral effects through a wide range of responses. PARP1, -3, -6, -10, -11, -12, and -16 have been shown to be ADP-ribosylated on carboxylic residues. ART-mediated ADP-ribosylation may reveal ADP-ribosylated proteins involved in yet unknown, specific, innate antiviral response pathways."}
