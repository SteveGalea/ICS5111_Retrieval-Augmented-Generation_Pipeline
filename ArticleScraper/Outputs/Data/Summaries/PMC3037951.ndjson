{"summary": "outbreaks of HFMD peaks in the warmer season of the year. but the reasons to the recent upsurge trend have not yet been established. enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackie A16 (CA16) inflicts mainly children with mild clinical symptoms include fever, blisters and sores in mouth, palms and soles. HFMD can be asymptomatic and it is possible for a recovered person to be infected again by different serotypes of enteroviruses. HFMD is endemic in the western Pacific region with EV71 and CA16 as two main dominant circulating strains. about 90% of the reported cases were children below 10 years old. HFMD is endemic in the tropical and subtropical countries with tendency of higher number of cases in wet season depending on geographical locations. weekly average temperature and cumulative rainfall were computed or aggregated from daily weather data. weekly temperature difference (Tp) was computed as the difference between weekly average maximum and minimum temperature. time trends, driven by other factors, could confound the relationship between temperature (e.g. seasonality) and HFMD. model A was included to demonstrate risk function without potential co-linearity bias due to correlation between minimum and maximum temperature. in a second stage, we estimated the risk ratio of the relationship between weather parameters and HFMD incidence. results During the study period, Singapore experienced nationwide HFMD outbreaks in March-May in year 2002 and 2005\u20132008. minimum and maximum temperature during the study period ranged from 22.8\u201327.6\u00b0C and 27.7\u201334.6\u00b0C. inverse relationship is observed between minimum temperature and HFMD incidence. a unit (mm) increases in weekly cumulative rainfall between 0\u201375 mm elevates risk of HFMD incidence by 0.3%. CI Maximum temperature if the max temp = 32\u00b0C 1.004 0.536 0.991 1.017 max temp >32\u00b0C 1.365 0.000 1.341 1.389 Minimum temperature if the min temp 25\u00b0C 0.972 0.017 0.949 0.995 min temp > = 25\u00b0C 0.833 0.000 0.816 0.851 Difference between minimum & maximum temperature if the temp difference = 7\u00b0C 0.899 0.000 0.883 0.914 temp difference >7\u00b0 temperatures below 75 mm were more prevalent during the annual outbreak transmission season of HFMD. lower ambient temperature and heavy downpour could help interrupt the disease transmission partly through serving as a barrier for social gathering activity or contact with other children in public. temperature difference was likely more influential on HFMD incidence in year 2008 as maximum temperature was below 32\u00b0C almost throughout the year. since 1998, Singapore set up surveillance system and formed multi-sector HFMD Task Force to plan, monitor, and manage outbreaks in Singapore [15] bimodal outbreaks in years 2005\u20132008 coincided mostly with weekly maximum temperature greater than 32\u00b0C and temperature difference above 7\u00b0C. the second peak which occurred between 2\u20136 months after the first outbreak could also be influenced by the extension of disease transmission from the first outbreak due to continual presence of viruses in the environment. high population density in Singapore could also compound the disease transmission rate and sustainability of outbreak. a maximum daily temperature above 32\u00b0C and rainfall up to 75 mm is expected to increase the HFMD incidence in the subsequent 1\u20132 weeks. these findings suggest that weather parameters can be used as early risk indicators for potential HFMD outbreaks."}
