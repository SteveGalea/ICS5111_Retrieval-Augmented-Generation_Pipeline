{"summary": "selective IgM deficiency (sIGMD) is a very rare disease. it is defined by low levels of IgM ( 0.40 g/L according to current guidelines) it is characterized by recurrent infections and treatment consists of immunoglobulin administration. the prevalence of this condition is estimated to be about 0.26% in the general population. mucosal lymphocytes characterization during follow-up for 1 year. an 18-year male patient was admitted for abdominal pain and diarrhea. his body mass index was 21.1 at the time of admission. no positive autoantibody was found. immunohistochemical lymphocyte characterization showed a predominance of immature B forms (CD 79a) there was a reduction of MUM1 (marker of B-cell differentiation and T-cell activation) positive cells (Figure 3A) and CD3 and CD8. this doubtful picture led us to perform mucosal tissue transglutaminase mRNA detection by a widely validated method based on reverse transcriptase chain reaction. duodenal biopsy specimens before (A) and 12 mo after (B) gluten-free diet showed scarse MUM1 plasma cells before the diet. positive cells are stained brown and counterstained blue (200). an association of CD has been described in 20% of IgA deficiency cases. the main novelty in our case is the sIGMD-seronegative CD association. the immunoglobulin selective deficiency might not have been only a primary condition, as suggested by mucosal immature lymphocytes."}
