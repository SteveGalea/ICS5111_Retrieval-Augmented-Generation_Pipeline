{"summary": "chemo, radiotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been used to treat hematological malignancies. therapeutic vaccines against leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs) are among the approaches to trigger tumor-specific immune responses. identification of LAA and its cytotoxic T lymphocytes epitopes has been shown to be effective in clinical trials.

HSCT is the only potential method to cure hematological malignancies. relapse rates remain high, particularly in patients transplanted during relapse. EPS8 was reported to be expressed at elevated levels in numerous human malignancies. EPS8 is a TAA and may be used as a target in immunotherapy of cancer as well as in hematological malignancies. a reverse immunology method was used to identify dominant T-cell epitopes from EPS8. the aim of the present study was to identify dominant T-cell epitopes. BIMAS and SYFPEITHY are based on the principle of binding motifs/quantitative matrices. the main reason for this may be the large dataset they comprise. a weakness of the motifs or quantitative matrices is the ignorance of the overall peptide structure to binding. peptide 455 and 360 had the highest affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule. peptide 276 and 92 had relatively low binding affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule. stability of peptide interaction with MHC-I correlated better with immunogenicity than affinity. target cells were first screened by RT-qPCR and western blot to detect the EPS8 expression. three tumor cell lines and T2 were selected as target cells. most of epitope identification methods have been used to date require the induction of peptide-specific CTLs. peptide 92 stimulated PBMCs more strongly to secret the highest amount of IFN- than the strong binder peptide 455, which stimulated the least amount of IFN- secretion by the PBMCs. a plateau of T-cell functional activity above a defined affinity threshold has been reported, suggesting that all clustered TCRs will be occupied above the defined affinity threshold. affinity do not contribute to T-cell functions; therefore, TCRs with higher avidity may not be at an advantage over lower-avidity TCRs. negative feedback mechanisms, including programmed death 1 and lymphocyte activation gene-3, would further curtail the potency of high avidity TCRs. duction and maintenance of peptide-specific CTL were not explored. the reason for this may be ascribed to the use of bulk CTL instead of CD8+ T-cell from the colon as effectors. this may have resulted in inadequate antigen processing and presentation. peptide 92 was most promising as an antigenic epitope to target tumor cells due to its higher immunogenicity. future studies will be required to investigate the clinical utility of the identified epitopes."}
