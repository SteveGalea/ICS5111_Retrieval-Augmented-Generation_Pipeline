{"summary": "the virus is a self-replicating agent that provides a supply of macromolecular antigens (immunogens) and, in most if not all instances, elicits in its hosts innate and adaptive immune responses. with acute viral infections, an imbalance between the immune response and viral replication causes termination of either the infection or the host. negative immune regulators (e.g., IL-6, IL-12, IL-27) that drive a fruitful and robust immune response and negative regulators (e.g., IL-6, IL-12, IL-27) that drive a fruitful and robust immune response. negative regulators (e.g., IL-10, TGF-, LAC-2, TIM-3) that reduce the host\u2019s ability to produce severe immunopathologic injury or autoimmune disease. dendritic cells (DCs) are among the most professional (effective) presenters of viral antigens. these cells express MHC/viral peptides, which function to arm, generate, and expand antiviral T cells. this position has been championed by experimental observations with LCMV (15, 18\u201322) LCMV congenitally infected mice to a viral dose lethal for adults infected in utero or during the neonatal period. the infecting microbial agent generates antiviral antibody that combines with the infecting virus to form immune complexes (V-Ab) that deposit in and injure arteries, glomeruli, and the choroid plexus of the brain (8). the strength of the LCMV model rests on three unique foundations. the first is a clear separation of effects caused by viruses from those caused by the host immune system. the persistent infection in vivo or in vitro of highly differentiated cells as those of the nervous, endocrine, or immune system. virulence specific to particular influenza virus strains depends on receptor use, replication potential, and direct cytopathic effects on pulmonary epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract and endothelial cells of the alveolar sacs where oxygen is exchanged. a genetically reconstructed H1N1 1918/1919 influenza virus was responsible for an estimated 50,000,000 deaths (35, 39, 40) a cytokine storm as the direct effect of acute influenza viral infection causes severe pulmonary injury resulting in a poor clinical outcome. cytokine storms comprise factors from both innate and adaptive immune responses but are most severe during the early innate immune response, usually days 1\u20133 postinfection. the human H1N1 swine influenza viral infection was amenable to specific drug therapy with several spingosphine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonists. these agonists blocked cytokine storms without acting on the infecting influenza virus, i.e., did not reduce viral titers. LCMV/neuraminidase chimera epitopes into the neuraminidase stalk of the influenza gene and then used reverse genetics to incorporate the LCMV/neuraminidase chimera into an infectious influenza virus particle. we used LCMV-specific CD8 T cells selected to recognize the LCMV CD8 T-cell epitope GP33-41. a permissive nonselective S1P probe, AAL-R, signaled via S1P receptors 1, 3, 4, and 5, but not 2 (49, 50, 52) as a control, we used the conformational isomer AAL-S that did not signal any S1P receptors. the permissive AAL-R significantly inhibited cytokine/chemokine production and leukocyte/macrophage infiltration into the lung. the results of extensive investigations indicated that S1P1 receptor signaling alone was responsible for the injurious early cytokine storm (50, 51) the suppression of S1P1 receptor signaling signified that cytokine/chemokine expression was dependent on type 1 IFN, but type 1 IFN was not involved in the recruitment of innate inflammatory cells into the lung (51). 1P agonist represents a potentially new therapy for influenza virus infection. gene profiling of pulmonary endothelial cell/epithelial cell/pDC cross-talk may provide factors to predict who will succumb to and who will live through a severe influenza virus infection."}
