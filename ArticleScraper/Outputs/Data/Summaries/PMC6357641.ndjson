{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an economically significant pathogen of the poultry industry worldwide. it causes low egg and meat production and the highly contagious respiratory disease avian infectious bronchitis (1\u20133) in poultry. IBV has a high mutation and recombination rate. the 47,399,834 reads were analyzed, quality checked, and de novo assembled using VirusTap (12) and NextGENe (13), producing a genome with a 38% GC content and a coverage of 967.07. a phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis X (15) phylogenetic analysis of the near-complete genome showed that VFAR-047 is grouped in the same branch with UY/09/CA/01, UY/11/CA/18 (MF421320), gammaCoV/Ck/Italy/I2022/13, and CK/CH/LDL/97I. the phylogenetic network (Fig. 1) and the phi test showed statistically significant evidence of recombination (P = 0.0) SRA under BioSample number SAMN10521748 and SRA run number SRR8281084. part of SRA study number SRP172861."}
