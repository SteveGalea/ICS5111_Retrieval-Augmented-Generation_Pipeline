{"summary": "the estimated \u201cat risk\u201d population in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria may be as high as 59 million. the number of symptomatic cases per year is around 300,000 with between 5,000 and 10,000 deaths. LF belongs to the Arenaviridae, a fast-growing family of rodent-borne viruses. high viremia and elevated levels of AST in plasma are two major risk factors predicting fatal outcome. hepatocellular necrosis is usually insufficient to implicate hepatic failure as the cause of death. LF pathogenesis is complicated by the absence of reliable and validated animal models. human PBMC exposed to virus is a model for the viremic stage of infection in vivo. PBMC were used here and in other studies [32] [33] [34] rather than cell lines [35] [36] to more closely simulate the situation in vivo in which circulating blood cells are exposed to virus-infected sites. supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hours post infection. PBMC washed with PBS and then covered in DMEM 2% FBS. monocytes were isolated from purified PBMC by plastic adherence. supernatants and cells were harvested at 24, 8, and 24 hours post-exposure. cells were re-suspended in Trizol and kept at 70\u00b0C for RNA isolation. only genes with at least one present call across all compared hybridizations were selected for further statistical analysis. GO terms with adjusted p value (false discovery rate or FDR) less than 0.05 were selected. this platform tested 84 interferon-related genes and 5 housekeeping genes for data normalization. 1 g of RNA from PBMC was reverse-transcribed in a 20-L reaction volume into first-strand cDNA using SuperArray's ReactionReady First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Cat. No PA-012, SABiosciences) in heparin tubes, mixed with 20 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS Cat No-tlrl-ekpls, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) as down-regulation control for thrombomodulin [45], MEM as non-stimulated control and ML29 virus. each time-point cells were stained with phycoerytrhin-conjugated mouse anti-human thrombomodulin monoclonal vero cell monolayers were infected with LASV and ML29 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 24 hours. supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hours post infection, titrated in vero cells and stored at 70\u00b0C at 107 PFU/ml. s were fed with 2.5 ml RPMI containing 20 ng/ml GM-CSF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill NJ), 20 ng/ml IL-4 (Peprotech), and processed for incubation with virus. on average, 22% of the cells were differentiated, monocyte-derived DC (DR+, CD11c+) high quality RNA was labeled and hybridized according to Affymetrix protocols using the GeneChip human genome U133 Plus 2.0 array. this chip covers the whole human genome using 54,000 probe sets representing approximately 22,000 genes. GO terms with adjusted p value (false discovery rate or FDR) less than 0.05 were selected. the Kegg's pathway with adjusted p value (false discovery rate or FDR) less than 0.05 for each list of genes was used. p value was calculated using a 2-tailed Student's t test. cells were stained with phycoerytrhin-conjugated mouse anti-human thrombomodulin monoclonal antibody (PE-CD141, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) monocyte population was gated and percentages of double positive cells were determined. soluble thrombomodulin was quantified by ELISA kit. PBMC from three healthy donors was exposed to LASV or ML29 viruses at 1 MOI in duplicate. gene expression changes in ML29 and ML29-exposed PBMC were detected at 4 and 8 hpe respectively. at 24 hpe LASV-treated PBMC showed the maximum changes (122 genes) in comparison with ML29-exposed PBMC. gene ontology analysis of global changes in LASV versus ML29-exposed PBMC. the most differentially expressed genes between LASV and ML29 are shown in Table 2A. the most differentially expressed genes between LASV and ML29 are shown in Table 2A. 003641 IFITM1 6.48/4.84a 2.48/1.91a 4.6 1.50 NM_001572 IRF7 7.51 2.92 5.81 1.75 NM_002462 MX1 34.45 17.98 16.80 2.73 NM_002534 OAS1 28.90/39.28a 8.13/9.63a 12.39 1.56 NM_004509 SP110 6.33 2.48 2.99 1.43 NM_000575 IL1A 23 1.33 3.80 1.45 NM_002346 LY6E 1.26 2.13 23.77 1.33 3.80 1.45 NM_000575 IL1A 1.27 2.55 23.57 1.03 4.16 1.28 NM_002192 INHBA 1.18 2.48 20.37 1.55 3.68 1.07 NM_006417 IFI44 2.58 2.74 18.52 1.07 1.12 9.24 NM_000361 THBD 1.71 1.26 14.56 1.28 1. the most striking differences involved gene expression in three different functional categories: IFN-stimulated, apoptosis, and NF-kB pathways. the most affected probesets, the ISG, were selected for further validation. exposure of human PBMC to LASV resulted in over-expression of all 17 IFN-stimulated genes by 2- to 100-fold over background. the most affected gene, IFI6, is the first IFN-stimulated gene known to inhibit apoptosis [46] among other most affected genes were IFI35, IFITM1, IRF-7, and SP110. apoptosis-related genes have been described that mediate the interaction of SP110 and viral proteins during viral infections. the most striking difference was observed in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase), up-regulated >65-fold in LASV-exposed cells versus ML-29-exposed cells. human PBMC to LASV was associated with strong up-regulation (22-25-fold) of CXCL6 and IL1A genes in comparison to ML29 exposure. Thrombomodulin (THBD), heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF) and integrin alpha M (ITGAM) were up-regulated after LASV exposure at all time-points.

HB-EGF is involved in several blood vessel physiologies [58], in kidney pathology [59], [60], inhibition of NF-kappa B activation [61], in cardiac hypertrophy, and together with PD-ECGF promotes vascular maturation [62], [63]. PBMC from three healthy donors was exposed to LASV or ML29 viruses at 1 MOI in duplicate. cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix chips covering the whole human genome. a total of 122 genes were identified as being differentially expressed at tested time-points. gene ontology analysis of global changes in LASV versus ML29-exposed PBMC. the most affected genes were involved in type I IFN-stimulated pathways (21%\u201317 genes from 122), apoptosis (12.29%\u201315/122), and NF-kappa B pathways (10.65%\u201313/122) IFI44 29.96/18.52a 20.31/9.24a 11.64 2.19 NM_006820 IFI44L 172.96 81.41 35.64 2.72 NM_022168 IFIH1 4.66/4.68a 4.69/2.92a 3.45 1.60 NM_001548 IFIT1 146.9 140.1 45.58 3.24 NM_001547 IFIT2 25.60/27.30a 35.30/25. 29 8.20 136.84 1.52 1.45 94.02 NM_003020 SCG5 1.13 17.82 33.95 1.87 2.72 1.14 NM_080657 CXCL6 1.31 30.69 26.29 1.56 7.04 1.34 NM_006273 CCL7 1.50 1.69 30.43 1.94 1.26 1.60 NM_002438 MRC1 1.09 29.33 15.35 2.06 1.20 1.34 AK001903 CDNA FL the most striking differences involved gene expression in three different functional categories: IFN-stimulated, apoptosis, and genes involved in apoptosis. the most affected probesets, the ISG, were selected for further validation. RNA samples from the 24-hr LASV- and ML29-exposed cells were assayed in duplicate using a human IFN and Receptors qRT-PCR Superarray kit (see Methods) levels of expression of 17 gene-targets were expressed in fold changes (Table 1 and figure 2B) exposure of PBMC to ML29 had relatively little effect on the 17 tested genes. IRF-7 and IRF-3 are transcription factors which induce production of IFN-I. it primes the expression of most IFN- genes by IFN-induced IRF-7 through the STAT-1 pathway. cellular proteins have been described that mediate the interaction of SP110 and viral proteins during viral infections. Inhibin-beta A (INHBA) joins Inhibin-alpha to form a pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone secretion inhibitor. INHBA is also up-regulated by vaccinia and inhibits a diverse array of cytokines. exposure of human PBMC to LASV was associated with strong up-regulation of CXCL6 and IL1A genes in comparison to ML29 exposure. gene symbol Fold changes in gene expression DNA microarray LASV ML29 4 h 8 h 24 h 4 h 8 h 24 h NM_000361 Thrombomodulin THBD 1.71 1.26 14.56 1.28 1.71 1.07 NM_001945 Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor HBEGF 1.10 4.13 3.80 2.45 1.82 1.11 NM_000632 Integrin, alpha M (complement component 3 receptor 3 there were no significant changes in thrombomodulin expression in CD14+ cells from PBMC treated with LPS or ML29 when compared with non-treated cells at 4 hpe. however, as shown in figure 4A, there was a significant reduction in THBD expression on the surface of CD14+ cells after LPS or ML29 stimulus. microarray results showed lower THBD RNA in ML29-exposed PBMC. control DC secreted 0.502 pg/ml THBD, while Lassa-exposed DC expressed 0.724 pg/ml THBD. treatment with LASV and LPS together diminished the THBD expression from 0.724 pg/ml after LASV exposure to 0.481 pg/ml. other coagulation-related genes could contribute to LF disease. transcriptome profiles PBMC from cynomolgous macaques infected with LASV. the set of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) is the most affected after exposure to LASV or ML29. ML29 has muted expression of INHBA (a negative regulator of IFN-), IFI44, TNFSF10 (TRAIL), SPP1 and LY6E (RIG-E) genes in the interferon pathway. ML29 down-regulation of IFI44 probably allows the virus to replicate early during the infection so that a strong immune response can control viral replication and spreading. other anti-viral genes such as RSAD2 (Viperin), TRIM5 [78], [79], [80] were more expressed in LASV than in ML29-exposed PBMC. plasma from LF patients has inhibitory activity on platelets from healthy individuals. this suggests the presence of soluble factors causing platelets malfunction. apoptosis due to LASV up-regulation of thrombomodulin (THBD) may contribute to LF pathogenesis. the absence of THBD up-regulation in the LCMV-WE infected model for LF may be a key failing of the model. the absence of THBD up-regulation in the LCMV-WE infected model for LF may be a key failing of the model. activating protein C (aPC), inhibiting the coagulation pathway and activating PAR1 membrane protein. LASV-induced perturbation of the cross-talk between integrins and the extracellular matrix may contribute to the functional alterations of epithelial and vascular endothelial cells that precede shock and death. both viruses, LASV and ML29, have identical surface-exposed GP1 responsible for interaction with -DG. ML29 and ML29 differ by the lysine to glutamic acid substitution located between the fusion domain and the RRLL motif. exposure of human PBMC to viruses modeled the viremic stage of disease.
