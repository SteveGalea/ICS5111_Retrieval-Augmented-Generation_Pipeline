{"summary": "a virulent PEDV strain, LC, was recently isolated from suckling piglets with severe diarrhea on an immunized-swine breeding farm in Guangdong province. the complete genome sequence of LC is 28,035 nucleotides (nt) in length [excluding the poly(A) tail] LC has 897 different nucleotides, of which 10 are in the 5\u2032 UTR, 522 in ORF1, 262 in the S gene, 23 in ORF3, 5 in the E gene, 12 in the M gene, 55 in the N gene, and 8 in 3\u2032 UTR. the complete genome sequence of LC shares 96.9 to 98.9% nucleotide sequence identities with those of other PEDV strains deposited in GenBank (1\u20135) logenetic analysis based on the complete genome shows that LC together with BJ-2011-1, CH/FJND-3/2011, and GD-B forms a new cluster. the genome sequence of PEDV strain LC has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number JX489155."}
