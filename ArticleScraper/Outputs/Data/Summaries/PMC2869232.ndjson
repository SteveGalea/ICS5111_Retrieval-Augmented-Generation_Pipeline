{"summary": "a number of methods without sequence alignment for deriving species phylogeny have been developed. these include fractal analysis [2\u20134], dynamical language model [5], information-based analysis [6\u20138], log-correlation distance and Fourier transformation with Kullback-Leibler divergence distance [9], Markov model [10\u201315], principal component analysis [16] and singular value decomposition [17\u201319]. model approach is to replace a pseudo-distance by a proper distance metric. it requires that the results are not worsened from the biological point of view. in the first way there is no widely accepted mathematical definition for the concept of dissimilarity or similarity. j = 1 m n j ( 1 2... K ) means the number of times that 12...K appears in the jth protein-coding DNA sequence or protein sequence. here nj means the number of times that 12...K appears in the jth protein-coding DNA sequence or protein sequence, and Lj the length of the jth sequence in this complete genome. in this way we construct a composition vector p = (p1, p2,..., pN) for p(s1) and p(sK) are frequencies of nucleotides or amino acids s1 and sK appearing in this genome. then q(s1s2...sK) of all 4K or 20K kinds of K-strings is viewed as the noise background. we then subtract the noise background before performing a cross-correlation analysis through defining: X (s1s2...sK) the distance Dr (X, Y) between the two genomes is then defined by Dr (X, Y) = (1 \u2013 C(X, Y)) / 2. A distance matrix for all the genomes under study is then generated for the construction of phylogenetic trees. this distance method is referred to as the dynamical language model method [5]. each genome can be considered as a point in N = 4K (for DNA sequences) or 20K (for protein sequences) dimensional space represented by its composition vector X = (X1, X2,..., XN). a function D(X, Y) between two vectors X and Y is said to be a distance metric if it satisfies the following properties. Xu = (Xu1, Xu2,...,XuN) and Yu = (Yu1, Yu2,..., YuN) be two unit vectors; then the chord distance Dchord (Xu, Yu) is defined as: D chord ( X u, Y u ) = i = 1 N ( X u i Y u i ) 2 = i = 1 N X u i 2 + i = 1 N X this distance performed well in simulations of tree-building algorithms by Takezaki and Nei [29] this distance performed well in simulations of tree-building algorithms by Takezaki and Nei [29] this distance performed well in simulations of tree-building algorithms by Takezaki and Nei [29]. the chord distance is defined on the set of unit vectors in a vector space as the length of the chord constructed from two unit vectors. it is seen that Dchord (Xu, Yu) = 0 if and only if C(Xu, Yu) = 1, which implies that (Xu, Yu) = 0 because the angle between the two vectors Xu and Yu is in [0, ]. chord distance Dchord (Xu, Yu) can be normalized by D chord norm ( X u, Y u ) = D chord ( X u, Y u ) / 2. This distance performed well in simulations of tree-building algorithms by Takezaki and Nei. the piecewise distance is a proper distance metric in the strict mathematical sense. we propose to replace the pseudo-distance in the dynamical language approach [5] by the chord distance. dataset 1 was used in [5] using the right genome data. we obtained two trees with the same topology to those using the dynamical language approach in [5] and the Markov model approach in [12]. this tree is better than the one in [19] and the one obtained by the Markov model approach in [12] phylogeny of 109 organisms (prokaryotes and eukaryotes) using the dynamical language approach with chord distance in the case K = 6 based on all protein sequences. the tree using the piecewise distance has the same topology as the tree using the old \u201cdistance\u201d for the same value of K. and the trees of K = 6 are the best. the phylogeny of Figure 3 shows that the chloroplast genomes are separated to two major clades corresponding to chlorophytes s.l. and rhodophytes s.l. the interrelationships between the chloroplasts are largely in agreement with the current understanding on chloroplast evolution. the mitochondrial genomes are separated into three major clusters. one group corresponds to mammals; one group corresponds to the fish. the third one represents archosauria (including birds and reptiles) phylogeny of 62 alpha-proteobacteria using the dynamical language approach with pseudo-distance in [5] and the two proper distances in this paper on the amino acid sequences of all protein-coding genes from genomes for K = 3, 4, 5 and 6. we compared the trees before and after normalization and found that the topology of the trees is the same. we set = 4, 6, 8, 10 and found that we could get the trees with the same topology."}
