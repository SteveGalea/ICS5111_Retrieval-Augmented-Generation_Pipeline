GO analysis and KEGG Pathway analysis showed pathway in cancer is significant. hsa-miR-195-5p: 5A was biological process, 5B was cellular component and 5C was molecular function. hsa-miR-4441, hsa-miR-4709-3p, ebv-miR-BHRF1-2-3p, hsa-miR-585-3p, and hsa-miR-5572 showed the most significant down-regulation. compared with the normal region, has-miR-195-5p showed the most significant down-regulation. ebv-miR-BHRF1-2-3p 5.163120567 130 395 171 62.5 350 77 0.192307692 0.992907801 0.248788368 hsa-miR-585-3p 6.490057016 120.5 406 98.5 51 359 3.5 0.156923077 1.018439716 0.011308562 hsa-miR-5572 4.292524125 100 186.5 148.5 30.5 hsa-miR-4441 7.760619418 68.5 312 158.5 22 187.5 116.5 0.060857538 0.472292191 0.316146540 hsa-miR-4709-3p 7.548223518 84 440 211.5 38 315 170 0.105117566 0.793450882 0.461329715 ebv-miR-BHRF1-2-3p 5.321105359 196.5 1028.5 hsa-miR-4747-5p 2.097163586 1797 3320 366 1754 3279 287 4.4292929292929 29 9.288951841 0.871016692 hsa-miR-4441 3.5898017 82.5 174 123.5 40 128 49.5 0.101010101 0.362606232 0.150227618 hsa-miR-4709-3p 5.375354108 77.5 21 the primer sequences of hsa-miR-195-5p were: GSP: 5\u2032GGGGTAGCAGCACAGAAAT3\u2032, R: 5\u2032CAGTGTGTCGTGGAGT3\u2032. the RT-PCR expression level of hsa-miR-195-5p was significantly lower in the collapse area (T1 T2 T3)than in the non-collapse area (W1 W2 W3) and normal area (Z1 Z2 Z3) GO analysis and KEGG Pathway analysis showed pathway in cancer is significant. hsa-miR-195-5p was perdicted as target gene of hsa-miR-195-5p. previous studies have suggested that collapse occurs because of an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation after femoral head osteonecrosis. osteonecrotic femoral head collapse occurs because of continuous spreading of trabecular fracture. subchondral fracture in the osteonecrotic femoral head was defined as the collapse area. non-collapse and collapse are different pathological stages of osteonecrotic femoral head. steroid-induced femoral head osteonecrosis (a clear history of hormone use); femoral head osteonecrosis (a clear history of hormone use); femoral head osteonecrosis (a clear history of hormone use); femoral head osteonecrosis (a clear history of hormone use); femoral head osteonecrosis (a clear history of hormone use); femoral head osteonecrosis (a the powder was transferred to an microcentrifuge tube, mixed with 1 mL Trizol, and stored at 70\u00b0C until use. total RNA extraction, RNA labeling, hybridization and microarray chip scanning total RNA was extracted from tissue cells using TRI reagent BD. the sample was hybridized with miRCURYTM LNA Array (v.18.0) (Exiqon) after hybridization. the microarray chip was rinsed with Wash buffer kit (Exiqon) after hybridization. the median was taken and combined for the same probes. SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA) was employed for statistical analysis. predication of target gene of miR-195-5p TargetScan, mirBase and miRanda bioinformatics software were used to predict target genes. p-value denotes the significance of GO terms enrichment in the DE genes. femoral heads were removed and cleaned with saline. three bone tissues were taken from femoral heads. total RNA extraction, RNA labeling, hybridization and microarray chip scanning. total RNA was extracted from whole blood using TRIzol LS. RNAsey mini kit (QIAGEN) was used for RNA purification. nanoDrop ND-1000 was employed for measurement of RNA concentration after purification. median was taken and combined for the same probes. miRNAs showing differential expressions of more than 1.5-fold were selected. median was standardized in all microarray chips. GO project covers three domains: Biological Process, Cellular Component and Molecular Function. Fisher's exact test is used to find if there is more overlap between the de list and the GO annotation list than would be expected by chance."}
