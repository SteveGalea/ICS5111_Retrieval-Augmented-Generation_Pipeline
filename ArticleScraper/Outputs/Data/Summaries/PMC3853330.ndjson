{"summary": "Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of central nervous system. the disease causes the removal of fatty myelin sheath from axons of the brain and spinal cord resulting reduced communication among nerve cells. vitamin D and turmeric play a protective role in MS and neurodegeneration. symptoms include weakness of limbs, vision problems, slurred speech, fatigue, dizziness, difficulty in muscle coordination and losing strength and uncontrolled bodily functions. the disease occurs mostly in the age of 20-40 and women are affected twice compared to men. the occurrences of the relapse vary from mild to severe based on the course and history of the disease. around 80% of cases followed by chronic progression within 20 years. clinical relapses are also considered a mean to see whether patient is improving after given a certain drug. agent Based Modeling (ABM) look to be one of the most appropriate to describe complex systems in a flexible way. to our best knowledge only read et al. presented in [22] an ABM for modeling experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse proxy for MS. the population of prey is represented by activated Teff cells that use available food resources to grow. the population of prey is represented by activated Teff cells that use available food resources to grow. on the other hand the population of predators try to catch and suppress them. many studies have confirmed the presence of some genetic predisposition by individuating multiple specific genes that entitle higher risk of developing MS. the presence of some breakdown in the peripheral immune tolerance mechanisms that allows the activation of Teff represents another condition that has been taken into consideration. ABMs naturally handle entity heterogeneity and physical space, and suffer less from the issue of directly designed dynamics. they lack a solid mathematical basis that could be used to easily study asymptotic behaviors. high effective parallel algorithms or platforms to support such approaches represent one of the next major challenges. netLogo models take advantage of the graphical interface that easily allows the plot of various entities dynamics. the implementation of a more detailed model would require the flexibility and the speed given by the use of a pure programming language. we chose such a time-step because it allowed to keep a good degree of granularity that enabled to simulate singular relapses. the model supposes the presence of three kinds of agents (called turtles in Netlogo): auto reactive effector T cells (Teff), regulatory T cells (Treg), and EBV (Viruses). in the present model activated Teff and Treg are the sole agents that actively interact in and with the brain tissues. the other agents (resting Teff, resting Treg, and viruses) do not interact with the underlying patches (which contain the myelin) activated Treg and Teff cells have two internal states: (a) resting and (b) activated. all cells are introduced into the simulation in resting state. reversible damage can be recovered. the probability pe is calculated for every duplication process according to the following law. the term m y e l i n 2 gives higher probabilities to duplicate if patch has higher quantities of myelin. there is a high number of Tregs in a given radius then the possibility of having such cytokine inhibitors will be higher. if duplication occurs the duplicating Teff will have its life counter reduced by half. the newborn Teff will be already active and will be positioned in a patch. this interaction is used to mimic the activation of auto reactive regulatory T cells by antigen presenting cells (APC) that present EBV epitopes. the virus will disappear from the simulation. this cross regulation between the two populations reminds to the famous predator-prey equations. the population of prey is represented by activated Teff cells that use available food resources to grow. on the other hand the population of predators try to catch and suppress them. the observation of two or more lesions in different parts of the CNS using magnetic resonance imaging techniques represents nowadays one of the necessary conditions associated with the diagnosis of MS. many studies have confirmed the presence of some genetic predisposition by individuating multiple specific genes that entitle higher risk of developing MS. this scenario has been observed both in mice [33,34] and in humans [35,36] interaction (i.e. cooperation or competition) with nearby agents modifies the dynamics of interacting agents. emerging complex behavior is obtained by taking into account all the microscopic stochastic interactions of all agents. netLogo models take advantage of the graphical interface that easily allows the plot of various entities dynamics. the implementation of a more detailed model would require the flexibility and the speed given by the use of a pure programming language. we used a time-step of (t) = 2.4 hours because it allowed to keep a good degree of granularity. the model supposes the presence of three kinds of agents (called turtles in Netlogo): auto reactive effector T cells (Teff), regulatory T cells (Treg), and EBV (Viruses). Logic implemented in the prototype Due to a genetic predisposition, self-reactive resting Teff and Treg cells are introduced randomly using stochastic pulse trains. the presence of an external factor such as the presence of EBV latent infection can cause activation of both Teff and Treg cells. both Teff and Treg cells have two internal states: (a) resting and (b) activated. all cells are introduced into the simulation in resting state. reversible damage can be recovered. duplication is modeled as a stochastic bernoulli process. the Teff will have a probability to duplicate pe and to do not duplicate equal to 1 - pe. if an active Treg finds an active Teff in a neighborhood of radius treg_radius the Treg will move towards Teff and will suppress it. if duplication occurs the duplicating Teff will have its life counter reduced by half. a virus in a neighborhood of radius virus_radius switches its internal state to active. the virus will disappear from the simulation. this interaction is used to mimic the activation of auto reactive effector T cells by antigen presenting cells (APC) that present EBV epitopes. if the patch still contains a quantity of myelin that is greater than zero, the damage can be recovered at every time-step with a given rate rec_mye up to the initial quantity init_mye. otherwise the remaining quantity of myelin is zero the patch is colored in black and the damage cannot be recovered anymore. the introduction of resting Teff and Treg is done using trains of 100 randomly distributed impulses per year. this reflected the fact that the generation of a given self-reacting T-cells can be seen as a consequence of unrelated stochastic events [55] also viruses are introduced with the same technique. in Figure 1 we show the conceptual model that implements this logic. Figure shows the genetic predisposition in developing the pathology. Figure shows the presence of an external trigger (eBV), the supposed malfunction of the Treg-Teff mechanism. bernoulli events (for Teff, Treg, and viruses) are simulated in order to decide whether introduce new turtles or not. if success occurs the new turtles are introduced into the simulation. the term m y e l i n 2 i n i t _ m y e 2 gives higher probability to duplicate if the patch has higher quantities of myelin. the term m e a n _ T r e g s is used to model the down-regulation of Teff duplication rates by Treg actions. pt is a duplication constant representing the maximum duplication rate of Treg. if duplication occurs the duplicating Treg will have its life counter reduced by half. if duplication occurs the newborn Treg will be already active. we reproduced both the absence and presence of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms at a local level. for simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both Teff and Treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates. we took, as outcome of the experiments, the total damage at the end of the simulations for both the scenarios. median values of the final total damage were 77268 for the hill sample and 5357 for the healty sample. non parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov two samples goodness-of-fit test gave as result a maximum difference between the cumulative distributions D = 0.7500 with a corresponding p-value of: 0.000. the plots confirm the observations that came from Figure 2. both Treg and Teff have similar duplication rates. simulation time is 5 years (18250 time-steps) all plots show some spikes in the Teff behaviors (red lines) however in this case the spikes are more numerous and reach higher values. this suggests that due the malfunction in the regulatory mechanisms, Teff can be easily activated and cause brain damage. simulation time is 5 years (18250 time-steps) red lines represent activated unrecoverable damage, blue lines represent recoverable damage and black lines total damage (recoverable + unrecoverable) in this case it is possible to observe more frequent spikes in the reversible damage curves. however, unrecoverable damage is also present. we presented the first simple model of MS using agent based modeling approach. it shows the main behavior of this neural disease i.e., the relapse-remitting one. it takes into account the main entities involved at cellular level in the pathogenesis of MS.
