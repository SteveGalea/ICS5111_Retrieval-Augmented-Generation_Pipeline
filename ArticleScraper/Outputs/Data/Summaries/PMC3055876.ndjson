{"summary": "a modified TPB tested if a modified TPB had explanatory utility for vaccine uptake among adults. 7% (67/896) reported being \u201clikely/very likely/certain\u201d to be vaccinated. but two months later only 0.8% (7/896) reported having received pH1N1 vaccination. the 2009 influenza pandemic (pH1N1) was caused by a triple reassortment of human, swine and avian influenza viruses. Vaccination planning is a more significant proximal determinant of uptake of pH1N1 vaccine than is intention. pH1N1 vaccination was free for priority group members on 26 January 2010. it cost HK$100\u2013150 (US$13\u201320, 1\u20131.5% of Hong Kong's median monthly income of HK$10,000/US$1,286/\u20ac991) per dose for the general population. from November 2009 onwards, television, radio, newspaper and official websites strongly encouraged priority groups to have pH1N1 vaccination. the adverse media reports had impeded vaccination uptake among general population. we collected baseline data between 12\u201325 January 2010, immediately before pH1N1 vaccine was made available to the general population. we recorded their reported vaccination status (Figure 2) with the intention of modelling how general population decision-making regarding pH1N1 vaccination might predict subsequent vaccine uptake. in 2009, 65.5% and 94.6% of Dutch respondents reported intending to take pH1N1 vaccine prior to or at the onset of the (potential) pandemic phase. however, by the time vaccination became available intention appeared much lower with only 10\u201315% of study respondents in France and in Turkey intending to take the pH1N1 vaccine [20], [24]. a recent review including 47 experimental studies found that a medium-to-large change in intention induced by manipulated interventions caused only a small-to-medium change in behavior [43] about 47% of those intending to take action fail to act [42], consistent with Harris et al's findings [33]. factors that are prime contenders to moderate/mediate the relationship between intention and behaviour include behavioural control/efficacy, action planning and anticipation of consequences [41]\u2013[43]. anticipated regret is expectation of feeling regret or upset if one does or does not conduct certain behaviours. anticipated regret has been found to be a strong predictor of vaccine uptake against seasonal influenza [31], [32], playing the lottery [48] and exercise [49]. the study found that controlling for the original TPB variables, moral norm and anticipated regret were significant determinants of actual receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine [51]. extending the TPB could provide theoretical utility for understanding public decision-making for pH1N1 vaccination. Hong Kong's pH1N1 epidemic started on 11 June 2009, peaking in September. by the end of December 2009, the government had recorded 37,174 human pH1N1 cases [8] in a population of 7 million. from November 2009 onwards, tv, radio, newspaper and official websites strongly encouraged priority groups to have pH1N1 vaccination. local media prominently attributed several adverse events to pH1N1 vaccination, including a case of GBS diagnosed a week after pH1N1 vaccination. all except one [24] relied on vaccination intention to predict actual vaccination uptake. only about half of \u201cintending\u201d recipients actually take it. almost all those who do not intend to take it remained unvaccinated. in france and in turkey intending to take the pH1N1 vaccine [20], [24]. most of the studies are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal; none assessed subsequent actual vaccination status. however, there is no way to infer causality. perceived behavioural control/self-efficacy The TPB is incorporating the concept of perceived behavioural control as an intervening variable predicting both intention and actual behavioural change directly [38], [39] a systemic review on the efficacy of TBP found that PBC and self-efficacy had comparable effects on intention and behaviour [41]. the higher anticipated regret for inaction, the better the prediction of intention on behaviour [48], [49] perceived behavioural control/self-efficacy The TPB is an extension of the TRA incorporating the concept of perceived behavioural control (PBC) as an intervening variable predicting both intention and also actual behavioural change directly [38], [39]. the direct effect of PBC on actual behavioural change partly explains why not all intention translates into behaviour. influenza [31], [32], playing the lottery [48] and exercise [49]. the higher anticipated regret for inaction, the better the prediction of intention on behaviour [48], [49] the TPB explains 34% of variance in health behavioural change related to addictive behaviour, automobile-related behaviours. intention and PBC predict the actual behavioural change [38], [39] extending the TPB could provide theoretical utility for understanding public decision-making for pH1N1 vaccination. the model proposed attitudes towards vaccination (perceived benefits of pH1N1 vaccination and concerns regarding possible adverse effects of pH1N1 vaccination), perceived self-efficacy in taking vaccination. we conducted 13 telephone surveys of psychological and behavioural responses to the first wave of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong from April through November 2009. the present study re-contacted subjects from some of these surveys and sought to understand public decision-making regarding pH1N1 vaccine uptake. respondents in the 7th, 9\u201312th surveys were invited to complete the baseline assessment for the present study. participants in these surveys had not had follow-up contact either in the parent study or otherwise. this minimizes interview fatigue thereby improving response rates. baseline assessment consisted of 44 questions, which took less than 15 minutes to complete. subjects were reminded of their prior participation and agreed to participate in a further study. subjects who reported that they had already received pH1N1 vaccination were excluded. agreement 0.53 My family and friends think that it is important for me to take vaccination against HSI 1\u20135 agreement Anticipated regret If you decide not to take the HSI vaccination this winter, then how likely will you regret your decision\" 1\u20137 likelihood Perceived self-efficacy I am confident that I can go independently to get HSI vaccination. social norms were assessed by agreement, using five-point scales, with two statements. the internal consistency for these two items was weaker, with = 0.53, which suggests each item appropriately measures different social influences. seasonal influenza vaccination history Respondents were asked whether they had received any seasonal influenza vaccination in the past three years. Vaccination intention Respondents were asked how likely it was that they would get vaccinated against pH1N1 during the winter flu season using a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 \u201cdefinitely not\u201d to 7 \u201ccertain\u201d). the model comprised dichotomous (vaccination status) and ordinal (vaccination intention) outcome variables. to test the full structural model, all variables were entered into the model simultaneously. chi-square test is very sensitive to sample size and non-normally distributed data. the present study re-contacted subjects from some of these surveys. a baseline assessment for the present study was performed between 12\u201325 January, 2010. a sample of at least 500 was required to achieve 80% power at an = 0.05 to reject a model of the specified complexity. 1,648 calls were randomly selected and successfully made by a university telephone polling organization. a total of 1,511 respondents agreed to participate in the baseline survey. of those 78 (5%, 78/1,511) reported already having received pH1N1 vaccination. the five selected surveys were conducted between 21 July and October 23, 2009. participants in these surveys had not had follow-up contact either in the parent study or otherwise. this minimizes interview fatigue thereby improving response rates. baseline assessment consisted of 44 questions, which took less than 15 minutes to complete. subjects were reminded of their prior participation and that they had agreed to participate in a further study. the study was introduced as a survey of attitudes towards swine flu vaccination. 1\u20137 likelihood - Vaccination planning I have planned when and where to get my HSI vaccination this winter. 1\u20135 agreement 0.59 When vaccines are available I intend to discuss with my doctor if s/he thinks it is good for me to have the vaccination 1\u20135 agreement. social norms were assessed by agreement on a 5-point scale with two statements. internal consistency for these two items was weaker, with = 0.53, which suggests each item appropriately measures different social influences. Vaccination planning We measured vaccination planning by assessing respondents' agreement on a 5-point scale with three statement items. the internal consistency for these three items was 0.59, though less than the most common acceptable level of above 0.7. these items were also treated as indicators of a latent variable for modeling purposes. social norms were assessed by agreement on a 5-point scale with two statements. internal consistency for these two items was weaker, with = 0.53, which suggests each item appropriately measures different social influences. vaccination planning We measured vaccination planning by assessing respondents' agreement on a 5-point scale with three statement items. the internal consistency for these three items was 0.59, though less than the most common acceptable level of above 0.7. respondents were asked to confirm if they had received pH1N1 vaccine within the past three months. chi-square test is very sensitive to sample size and non-normally distributed data. several other model fit indices were evaluated including the Comparative Fit index (CFI), the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) and RMSEA.
