{"summary": "REPLY Terajima and Ennis pointed out that there was an overlapping sequence between the nuclear export signal (59 to 68 amino acids [aa]) and the CD8+ T cell epitope (58 to 66 aa) of M1 protein in influenza A virus. they also noticed that similar sequences in the NESs of RIP3 and the matrix protein of Nipah virus overlap candidate epitopes. the peptide\u2013HLA-A*0201 complex could be eluted as peak 2 at a volume of the molecular mass of 45 kDa. the predicted epitopes in RIP3 and the matrix protein of Nipah virus could refold with HLA-A*0201 heavy chain and 2m.
