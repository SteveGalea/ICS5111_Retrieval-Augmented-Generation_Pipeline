{"summary": "the world health organization has identified a list of top emerging diseases likely to cause major epidemics. the list includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused a pandemic in 2002\u20132003. most SARS-like viruses from bats do not bind the human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). no clinical signs were observed, but viral RNA was detected in both fecal samples and intestinal tissue. shedding of viral RNA was detected in oral and rectal swabs. a variety of different tissues tested positive for viral RNA. the virus was titrated by inoculating veroE6 cells with tenfold serial dilutions of virus in 2% DMEM. five days after inoculation, cytopathic effect (CPE) was scored and TCID50 was calculated. ACE2-Dependent Replication Kinetics of WIV1 BHK cells were transfected in 6-well plates with 4 g pcDNA3.1(+) containing ACE2 from Rousettus aegyptiacus (XM016118926) or homo sapiens (AB193259) one hour after inoculation, cells were washed twice with PBS, and fresh media was placed on the cells. binates, larynx, pharynx, trachea, lung, brain, eye, conjunctiva, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, bladder, reproductive organs, stomach, proximal and distal intestinal tract, cervical lymph nodes, adrenal glands, skin, and skeletal muscle were collected for virological and histopathological analyses. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy method on the Qiagen. all qRT-PCR cycles were as follows: 15 min at 50 \u00b0C, 5 min at 95 \u00b0C, then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 15 s (WIV1) or 30 s (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) at 60 \u00b0C. total white blood cell, lymph antibodies were detected using ImmPress VR Polymer HRP anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody and developing solution. ELISA was performed by coating SARS-CoV spike S1 or nucleoprotein (N) antigen (NR686 and NR48761, BEI resources, 0.5 g/mL in 50 mM bicarbonate binding buffer) on to MaxiSorb plates. t-test on Graphpad Prism 7 for Windows was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. p-values 0.05 were considered as significant. Particle pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1 ThermoFisher NuPage LDS), boiled for 10 min at 100 \u00b0C and analyzed for FLAG expression on a 10% Bis-Tris PAGE gel. ACE2-transfected BHK cells were then infected with equal volumes of VSV reporter particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, or WIV1-CoV spike. supernatants were inoculated with 105 TCID50 of WIV1-CoV. all bats were inoculated with 105 TCID50 of WIV1-CoV. tests included measuring body weight and temperature, obtaining oropharyngeal, rectal and urogenital swabs. standard dilutions of a virus stock with known titer were run in parallel in each run, to calculate TCID50 equivalents in the samples. primers and probes specific for Rousettus aegyptiacus GAPDH and HPRT were designed as extraction controls. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of seven days. skulls were decalcified in 20% EDTA in sucrose. samples were sectioned at 5 m, and slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. serum samples were diluted in 5MPT and incubated on plates for 1 h. sera was termed seropositive if optical density was higher than 0.2. heat-inactivated sera (30 min at 56 \u00b0C) was diluted in 2% DMEM, then incubated 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with 100 TCID50 of WIV1-CoV. virus replication as measured in supernatant at 48 h post infection. no virus replication could be found in BHK cells not transfected with ACE2. ACE2 is a suitable receptor for WIV1-CoV. ACE2 immunohistochemistry of (A) nasal turbinate\u2014400, multifocal apical immunoreactivity in ciliated epithelial cells (arrows); (B) trachea\u2014400, negative immunostaining; (C) lung\u2014400, multifocal cytoplasmic endothelial cell immunoreactivity (arrowheads); (C) lung\u2014400, multifocal cytoplasmic endothelial cell immunoreactivity ( four bats each were necropsied on 3, 7, and 28 dpi. no postmortem gross pathological lesions were identified during necropsy. complete blood cell counts of four bats on each day of necropsy were compared to values obtained pre-challenge. no abnormal values were detected in the levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils or basophils. ELISA assays were performed using SARS-CoV proteins N and S. bats with an increase in serology titer are shown in bold. a specific host factor may be required for virus transcription and replication. this could be lacking in the Egyptian fruit bats [14]. some bats were negative for SARS-specific antibodies. the ability to infect and replicate efficiently is bat species-specific. the results suggest that the ability to infect and replicate efficiently is species-specific. this has been observed with filoviruses as well."}
