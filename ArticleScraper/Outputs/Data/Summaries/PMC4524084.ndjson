{"summary": "influenza A viruses are enveloped RNA viruses in the family Orthomyxoviridae. they possess eight negative-sense genomic segments and are classified into subtypes based on the two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) each HA monomer contains a receptor binding site (RBS) in its globular head. neutralizing antibodies could prevent influenza A virus infection, especially in sporadic human infections (7). the only neutralizing antibody reported to react with H7 was less effective against this recent virus (8). both HNIgGD5 and HNIgGH8 showed equally strong HI activity. the HI titer was as low as 0.8 g/ml. the HI titer was 0.8 g/ml.
