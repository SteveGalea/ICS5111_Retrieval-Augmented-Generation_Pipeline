{"summary": "vhs-induced mRNA decay initiates at or near regions of translation initiation both in mammalian cell extracts and in infected cells (18\u201321), and mutations that affect the initiation codon of the target mRNA alter the cleavage pattern (21). vhs plays important and diverse roles during infection. vhs also dampens certain host antiviral responses, including induction and activity of the type I interferon (IFN) system. vhs also directly or indirectly enhances translation of viral mRNAs, likely through at least two distinct mechanisms. the viral ICP34.5 protein binds protein phosphatase 1, redirecting it to dephosphorylate eIF2 (35), the US11 protein binds dsRNA and PKR and blocks PKR activation. vhs also activates translation of viral mRNAs in an apparently eIF2 phosphorylation-independent fashion in certain cell types. vhs prevents mRNA overload by reducing levels of cellular and early viral mRNAs. one or more translation initiation factors are limiting in HeLa cells compared to Vero cells. SGs form when translation initiation is stalled through any of several distinct mechanisms, including eIF2 phosphorylation. vhs mutants induce robust SG accumulation during infection of many cell lines (39, 56, 57), and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) vhs is able to block SG formation downstream of stress kinase activation. PKR is essential for SG induction during vhs-null virus infection but plays only a secondary role in attenuating viral true late gene expression. the wild-type vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen was provided by G. McFadden. the titers of the virus were determined on Vero cells. both plasmids were derived from pEQ1508 (60) the PKR-targeting sequences in the guide RNAs are GTCTCTCTTCCATTGTAGGATA (pEQ1509) and GTTCAGGACCTCCACATGAT (pEQ1510). knockout clones were identified by screening for loss of PKR KO1 clone. wild-type and modified HeLa cells were scored for their capacity to form stress granules following exposure to 0.5 mM sodium arsenite (Sigma) for 45 min or 6 h after transfection with poly(IC) for 45 min or 6 h. PKR KO1 (C) and PKR KO2 (D) cells were infected with 10 PFU/cell of HSV-1 KOS or Sma. viral yields were determined at the indicated times postinfection (hours postinfection [h.p.i] by plaque assay on Vero cells. suitable secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen) or IRDye800 (Rockland) using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR) cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 20 min. vero cells were grown in the same medium containing 5% FBS. wild-type vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen was provided by G. McFadden. titers of the virus were determined on Vero cells. plasmids target the first coding exon of the human PKR gene. both plasmids were derived from pEQ1508 and pEQ1510. lentivirus-containing supernatant was then used to infect 60-mm dishes. wild-type and modified HeLa cells in 12-well plates were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 PFU/cell with the indicated vaccinia virus or HSV-1 isolate. DMEM containing 10% FBS was added. inactivating PKR does not appreciably promote the growth of Sma in HeLa cells. PKR KO1 (C) and PKR KO2 (D) cells were infected with 10 PFU/cell of HSV-1 KOS or Sma. phospho-eIF2 (serine 51; rabbit; catalog no. 9721; Cell Signaling), eIF2 (rabbit; catalog no. 9722; Cell Signaling) primary antibodies were detected using suitable secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen) or IRDye800 (Rockland) using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR) vhs-deficient HSV-1 activates PKR in HeLa cells without inducing enhanced levels of eIF2 phosphorylation. we compared the ability of wild-type HSV-1 strain KOS and the vhs-deficient Sma derivative to activate PKR in primate cells. HSV-1 activates PKR in HeLa cells but not in Vero cells. cells were infected with 10 PFU/cell of wild-type HSV-1 KOS (KOS), the vhs mutant HSV-1 KOS Sma (Sma), wild-type vaccinia virus (VV), or E3L mutant vaccinia virus (E3L) cells were infected with phosphorylated PKR (P-PKR), total PKR 34.5 protein to reverse eIF2 phosphorylation. SGs fail to form during vhs-null virus infection of HeLa cells. vhs-deficient HSV-1 induces higher levels of PKR activation than wild-type virus does. candidate clones were screened for PKR expression by Western blotting. two independent PKR-deficient clones were identified. one of these alleles lacks all of the sequences between the two targeted sites. the other allele bears two separate deletions, one at each of the two targeted sites. the indicated cell lines were infected with 10 PFU/cell of wild-type or E3L-null vaccinia virus (VV and E3L) the indicated cell lines were infected with 10 PFU/cell of wild-type or wild-type or E3L-null vaccinia virus. the PKR KD and KO cell lines fail to form SGs in response to poly(IC) the indicated cells were left untreated, transfected with poly(IC) for 6 h, or exposed to 0.5 mM sodium arsenite for 45 min. the cells were scored for stress granules by immunofluorescence using an antibody directed to TIA-1. PKR KO cell lines fail to form SGs following infection with vhs mutant HSV-1. indicated cell lines were infected with 10 PFU/cell of HSV-1 KOS or Sma. inactivating PKR does not fully rescue viral true late protein expression or viral replication in the absence of vhs. PKR (and likely eIF2 phosphorylation) are not the primary drivers of the block to translation of viral true late mRNAs in the absence of vhs. this conclusion is in accord with the finding that eIF2 is phosphorylated to similar extent in the presence and absence of vhs in HeLa cells. the levels of gC, US11, and UL47 protein observed during infection with HSV-1 Sma are expressed relative to those in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1 KOS. the results of three independent experiments are presented in Fig. 5. in HeLa cells, HSV-1 KOS and Sma both induced phosphorylation of PKR on residue T446, a hallmark of PKR activation. neither virus detectably activated PKR in Vero cells. PKR is susceptible to activation by virus infection in this cell line. OS or Sma in the presence (+) or absence of 300 g/ml phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) and cell extracts prepared 12 h postinfection were analyzed for phosphorylated PKR. vhs-deficient HSV-1 induces higher levels of PKR activation than wild-type virus does. we tested this possibility by determining the effects of knocking down and knocking out PKR on SG formation and the expression of selected viral true late proteins. we transduced HeLa cells with a lentivirus vector expressing an shRNA targeting PKR mRNA to generate a polyclonal knockdown cell population (PKR KD) in which PKR levels were reduced by ca. 80% relative to control HeLa cells. extracts of wild-type HeLa cells and HeLa PKR knockdown (PKR KD), knockout 1 (KO1) and knockout 2 (KO2) cells were analyzed by Western blotting for PKR. the locations of the sequences targeted by the pEQ1509 and pEQ1510 Cas9 plasmids are indicated relative to the first coding exon of the human PKR gene. tes eIF2 phosphorylation and SG formation in response to dsRNA. other eIF2 kinases mediate the response to other stresses. untreated cells showed diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of TIA-1. wild-type, PKR KD, PKR KO1 and PKR KO2 HeLa cells were infected with wild-type KOS and Sma. we examined 12 h postinfection for the presence of SGs by staining for TIA-1. PKR is essential for SG formation during vhs-null virus infection. cell lines were infected with 10 PFU/cell of KOS or Sma and harvested 12 h postinfection. inactivating PKR does not fully restore translation of true late mRNAs during vhs-null virus infection of HeLa cells. eIF2 is phosphorylated to similar extent in the presence and absence of vhs. gC, US11, UL47, gB, VP16, TK, ICP4, ICP27, ICP34.5, cellular -actin, and phosphorylated PKR are expressed relative to those in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1 KOS. vhs mutants induce higher levels of PKR activation than wild-type virus does. vhs inhibits PKR activation by reducing levels of complementary viral RNAs capable of annealing to form dsRNA at late times postinfection. the strong PKR activation that occurs in the absence of vhs does not lead to increased eIF2 phosphorylation relative to wild-type virus in HeLa cells. this finding contrasts with previous results from the leib and Morrison groups, who demonstrated enhanced levels of eIF2 in mouse embryo fibroblasts. vhs mutants are infected with an HSV-1 vhs mutant. vhs can also attenuate SG formation by globally lowering mRNA levels. vhs can also attenuate SG formation by globally lowering mRNA levels. the absence of vhs is consistent with our previous proposal that the translational blockade stems from mRNA overload (39, 40) we currently seek to further test the mRNA overload hypothesis and identify the limiting translation factor(s)"}
