{"summary": "contaminated salmon caused a large salmonella Thompson outbreak in the Netherlands. the 2012 outbreak was severe (m = 4.21; five-point scale with 5 as severe) a typical salmonella infection can lead to fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. food-borne Salmonella infections should be prevented by educating the general public about adequate cooking of food, and by instructing them about the risks of cross-contamination. educating the public about food safety is crucial in preventing food-borne infections. educating the public about food safety is crucial in preventing food-borne infections. the rise of social media has provided new avenues for reaching the general public during infectious disease outbreaks. research on the information behavior of the general public during an infectious disease outbreak is scarce. but this knowledge is crucial in serving the general public in their information needs. survey was developed on the basis of the Health Belief Model [17], and research on citizen channel choice for medical information [18,19]. survey contained 35 questions, and was divided into five domains: perceptions, knowledge, preventive behavior, and health. respondents were recruited by a commercial panel that hosted the survey in their online environment. the panel supplied standard demographics for each respondent. the minimum age for participation was 18 years. education was recoded into a new variable with three options: low, middle or high. sex was included in the regression analyses as a dummy variable. the procedure was repeated for determining factors that influence the consumption of information about the 2012 salmonella outbreak for different media. 1,149 laboratory-confirmed patients and four deaths were reported. the actual number of patients is thought to be higher, as individual cases of Salmonella gastro-enteritis are not mandatory notifiable in the Netherlands. responses were assessed by multiple-choice questions about what respondents did after hearing about the outbreak. we asked respondents if they had wanted more information about the outbreak or an answer to a specific question about the outbreak. if they had so through the internet, we asked them if they had found it through a google search, whether they had found what they were looking for and how satisfied they were with the website. of the 2012 outbreak,.77 for carefulness with salmon preparation during the outbreak,.89 for carefulness with general food preparation during the outbreak,.80 for interest in health information, and.76 for perceived health. to establish the influence of factors determining respondents\u2019 application of preventive measures during the outbreak, we performed stepwise backward regression analyses. 1,057 respondents completed the survey. figures show that the sample is fairly representative for the Dutch population. most respondents watched television more than two hours a day. respondents perceived Salmonella Thompson to be quite a severe infection (m = 4.21; SD =.76). this finding is corroborated by the comparison respondents made between a Salmonella infection and other illnesses. True 96.2% Most of the time, people get Salmonella from others already infected. True 81.2% Salmonella can predominantly be found on chicken, raw vegetables, and fruit. False 52.5% Salmonella is almost always treated with antibiotics. eight respondents (.8%) indicated to have gotten a Salmonella infection from eating contaminated salmon. a larger group (26 respondents; 2.5%) knew someone in their close vicinity who ate contaminated salmon. nu.nl is a popular news website in the Netherlands. time spent on the medium was the most influential predictor. time spent on the medium was the most influential predictor. ninety-one respondents (8.6%) had a specific question about salmonella infections in general or the outbreak in particular, or searched for more information. they turned to television (17 respondents), radio (8 respondents), a newspaper (20 respondents), the Internet (77 respondents), or a combination of several media. the number of respondents who answered these questions was relatively low. most online sources were either found through a Google search or directly by entering the URL. the NVWA website and Wikipedia were predominantly found through a Google search. children 5.8% 6.8% Living together or married; with children 34.8% 27.3% Other 1.5% 0.6% Education Low 40.8% 31.7% Intermediate 36.0% 40.5% High 23.2% 27.9% Ethnicity Dutch 84.9% 79.1% Other 15.1% 20.9% Daily occupation School 9.3% Entrepreneur 2.7% Paid commercial job 31.0% Paid non-profit job 19.0% Houseman/-wife 9.4% Incapacitated 6.4% Unemployed 4.4% Other 1.5% Income Minimum 9.4% Below 39% were unaware of common sources of a Salmonella infection. 47,5% unaware of its incubation period. 71,3% unaware of how Salmonella is treated in general. influenced by increased general kitchen hygiene during the outbreak ( =.61; p.001), by perceived severity of the outbreak ( =.19; p.001) and by demographics income ( =.07; p.01) and sex (higher for women; =.05; p.05). a low beta stands for a small influence, a high beta for a large influence. passive information behavior consists of situations in which a person receives information without actively searching for it. active information is caused by a question or explicit need for information. a person is exposed to information without a direct and specific need for information. ninety-one respondents (8.6%) had a specific question about Salmonella infections in general or the outbreak in particular, or searched for more information. they turned to television (17 respondents), radio (8 respondents), a newspaper (20 respondents), the Internet (77 respondents), or a combination of several media. the website of the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) (22 respondents); the website of their municipal health service (21 respondents); the website of a newspaper (16 respondents); the website of the Food Center (21 respondents); the website of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM); the website of the national institute for public health and the environment (RIVM); the website of the company that was the source of the outbreak. knowledge of salmonella was appropriate except for common food sources of a salmonella infection, the duration of the incubation period, and the fact that treatment with antibiotics is usually not needed. despite warnings through mass media, the majority of the respondents neither checked whether they had contaminated batches of smoked salmon products at home. increased general kitchen hygiene during the outbreak appeared to be the most important antecedent. consuming outbreak-related information is for a large part coincidental. a higher interest in health information also resulted in more outbreak-related information consumption. this could also be due to a recall bias, as those interested in such information might more easily remember receiving it. if we are to find a set of predictors for this context, we will have to step off the beaten path and gather a set of new predictors. limits We conducted the survey at the end of the salmonella outbreak. different phases induce different information needs, related to uncertainties of the situation. knowledge Respondents\u2019 knowledge of Salmonella was appropriate, except for common food sources of a Salmonella infection, the duration of the incubation period, and the fact that treatment with antibiotics is usually not needed. despite warnings through mass media, the majority of the respondents neither checked whether they had contaminated batches of smoked salmon products at home or did their kitchen hygiene increase during the outbreak. a higher interest in health information also resulted in more outbreak-related information consumption. this could also be due to a recall bias, as those interested in such information might more easily remember receiving it. if we are to find a set of predictors for this context, we will have to step off the beaten path and gather a set of new predictors. limits We conducted the survey at the end of the salmonella outbreak. health organizations should use traditional media, news and newspaper websites to inform the public, and persuade them to take preventive actions. future research should focus on the role Wikipedia can play during infectious disease outbreaks, not only those caused by salmonella. publication history for this paper can be accessed here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/100/prepub Supplementary Material Additional file 1 Survey."}
