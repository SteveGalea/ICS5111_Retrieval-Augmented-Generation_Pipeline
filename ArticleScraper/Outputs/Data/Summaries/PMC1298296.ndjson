{"summary": "participants were 3 critical care physicians, 4 clinical fellows in critical care, 4 resource nurses, 4 \"end-users\" and 3 members of the administrative staff. communication between key decision-makers was indirect. a fair process supplements moral deliberation based on substantive criteria and moral principles. priority setting in health care institutions is considered fair if it satisfies four conditions. the role of communication in the process of limit setting and its relationship with the publicity condition was highlighted. the interview period was 18/18 with a median of 3 admissions and discharges per day. we examined documents if interviewees made use of them to support decision-making. if an interviewee told us that resource nurses had a role in bed allocation, we interviewed resource nurses. the interview was audio taped and then transcribed verbatim. three policy documents that pertained to admissions and discharges from the ICU were identified and analysed. setting Our study was conducted at Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Science Centre in its busy critical care unit. from the unit census, 1100 medical, trauma and surgical patients were admitted in 2001\u20132002. the median number of occupied beds at daily census in the critical care unit during the interview period was 18/18. the critical care physician in charge is empowered by policy \"VI-A-10 Admission of Acute Care Patients: Section 6 \u2013 Admission to a Critical Care Unit\" the interviewer asked further specific questions to clarify answers and focus the subject on the question that was asked. three policy documents that pertained to admissions and discharges from the ICU were identified and analysed. critical care physicians communicated their decisions to the medical director on call. some physicians communicated reasons for denying a bed directly to end-users. some physicians communicated reasons for denying a bed directly to end-users. direct communication between the critical care physician and end-users resulted in unofficial \"parallel tracks\" of allocation decision-making. the lack of direct communication between the critical care physician and end-users resulted in unofficial 'parallel tracks' of bed allocation decision-making. end-users perceived the critical care fellow as good sources of information. but the availability of a bed could be better ascertained from a discussion with the resource nurse. some end-users bypassed the clinical fellows completely and based their possibilities for access to available beds. sally kohn: some end-users felt this was not inappropriate. kohn: it may be more appropriate for the primary care doc to go back to the family. she says the resource nurse and critical care physician approve proposed admissions. kohn: it's a good idea to have a bed, but it's a good idea to have a bed. the resource nurse's bed allocation decisions were verbal, informal and typically occurred over the telephone. communication of bed requests was verbal, informal and typically occurred over the telephone. for priority hospital programs with special entitlement to ICU resources, communication of bed requests might be made with very little direct communication between the critical care physician and end-user physicians. clinical fellows communicated ICU bed allocation decisions with team-members, including critical care physician, resource nurse, on-call resident and bedside nurses. they discussed decisions with stakeholders external to the ICU; referring services, patients and their families. not all clinical fellows we interviewed described doing this, and some respondents were uncomfortable with the practice. fellows were left out of decisions not to admit a patient to the ICU. but fellows found that they needed to take the initiative to remain informed. if the charge nurse decides to bring somebody into the unit, they usually talk to the staff. the patient flow specialist is obligated by policy to communicate with the medical director on call. the role of the medical director was to direct physicians to decline transfers and cancel or reprioritize surgery. if there's a problem with someone doing something like... pulling someone into critical care or doing something extraneous to get people out of there. medical oncology would have precedence over surgical services not identified as high priority. some physicians communicated reasons for denying a bed directly to end-users. others communicated indirectly via house staff or by leaving a message with the receptionist. end-user physicians designate participants from any hospital program. they discussed ICU bed allocation decisions with critical care physicians, clinical fellows and house staff. some end-users bypassed the clinical fellows completely and based their possibilities for access. bob greene: end-users perceived communication with critical care physician was less than ideal. he says in practice it communicated with either the resident or the staff and may or may not discuss it with the family. he says the ICU may say to us, \"you know what, you're allowed 2 beds\" but we don't have 2 beds, we have one bed or we have zero beds. greene: the ICU tries to keep itself out of that discussion. the central role of the resource nurse in ICU bed allocation is seen in the diversity of stakeholders. the resource nurse is seen in the diversity of stakeholders with whom she must communicate. if there isn't a bed we usually say \"can they go to recovery room, and then we'll assess them later\" communication of bed requests might be made with very little direct communication between the ICU participants and the progam's end-user physicians. traumas usually make their way through the resource nurse and the resource nurse. if it's a trauma patient it could be the ward clerk down in emerg who'll just call and tell us there's a trauma coming. david frum: clinical fellows deemed patients inappropriate for intensive care. he says referring service superiors had disagreement about decision not to admit a patient to the ICU. he says referring service superiors had to take initiative to remain informed. frum: if referring service superiors decide to bring someone into the unit, they always tell the charge nurse. patient flow specialist is obligated by policy to communicate with the medical director on call. when disagreements arise about interpretation of prioritization rules outlined by policy, the patient flow specialist is obligated to communicate with the medical director on call. we can say \"no\" and we can pull a physician in to talk to them immediately. communication breaks often impacted those most directly affected by a decision not to allocate a bed, such as the end-user surgical oncologist or the families of patients requiring intensive care treatment. findings suggest ways to improve publicity of limit setting decisions in critical care units. \"parallel track\" decision makers could allocate beds without this participant's knowledge. \"parallel track\" decision makers may view the critical care unit physician as responsible for making decisions about appropriateness of discharges. this exclusion may cause the official gatekeeper to be unable to explain why beds are not available in the critical care unit at a given time. communication of bed allocation decisions in critical care unit was sometimes conducted through intermediaries, such as fellows, residents or receptionists. the effectiveness of communication conducted in this way, especially in regard to families is limited because family members often feel they have not been given enough time. our choice of physician, nurse and administrative participants was guided by theoretical sampling. this sampling method identified initial participants comparable to those chosen in previous investigations. but their absence from our investigation limits our description because of the important mediation role some of them played. direct communication between the critical care physician and end-users would begin to satisfy the publicity condition of accountability for reasonableness. earlier draft of this paper was awarded the 2003 K.J.R. Wightman Award for research in biomedical ethics, second prize."}
