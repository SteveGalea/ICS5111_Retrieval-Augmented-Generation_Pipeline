{"summary": "new swine deltacoronavirus was present in 10% of porcine samples from china. two Chinese swine deltacoronavirus complete genome sequences were generated. the viral pathogenesis and clinical symptoms associated with swine deltacoronavirus infection are still unknown. the complete swine deltacoronavirus genome was not released. the first three contigs matched the bacterium Lactobacillus and Enterococcus. the fourth contig matched the swine Deltacoronavirus PorCoV HKU15-44. a reference-based assembly was conducted with the porCoV HKU15-44 strain. the release of strain SDCV/USA/Illinois121/2014 should expedite swine deltacoronavirus research on the genetic diversity, epidemiology, and evolution of swine deltacoronaviruses in the united states."}
