{"summary": "analysis of oligonucleotide microarray data in pathogen surveillance and discovery is a challenging task. chi-square test showed low false positive rates and a high degree of predictive accuracy. oligonucleotide tiling arrays used in viral resequencing have been applied. low-density microarrays can be analyzed by visual inspection [14], high-density arrays require computational solutions. correlation of fluorescence to a predicted hybridization signal has been used to infer the presence of a virus. t-test based method has also been validated with the same datasets. positive predictive value and false positive rates were used to assess the ability of the three different statistical methods to identify viruses. negative controls were generated from 1,500 randomly-chosen shuffled viral probe sequences. hybridization experiments were conducted in which known concentrations of WNV viral extract were spiked into reactions containing either 10 or 200 nanograms (ng) of human lung tissue RNA. the data pool included three single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses: west Nile virus (WNV, strain New York 1999, AF202541, ca 11 kb), SARS coronavirus (HCoV-SARS, strain Tor2, AY274119, ca 30 kb), and human echovirus virus 1 (HSV-1, viral culture, NC_001806, ca 152 kb) Genome Type Approximate genome size (kb) Family Virus/strain Abbreviation + sense ssRNA 11 Flaviviridae West Nile virus New York 1999 WNV + sense ssRNA 30 Coronaviridae SARS Human Coronavirus Tor2 HCoV-SARS + sense ssRNA 7.4 Picornaviridae Human Echovirus 18 Metcal 44 sequences were generated with CD-Hit [26] using a similarity cutoff of 98% to define sequences as identical. the number and position of any mismatches was stored for each probe-virus target pair. a lowess fit of probe-reverse complement G was also calculated. influenza A virus (8 samples derived from nasal lavage), hepatitis B (1 sample derived from serum), respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus (22 samples derived from viral culture in cell lines) one clinical isolate of influenza A virus also contained a respiratory syncytial virus (GSM40845) negative control probes were pooled with viral probes to ensure a wide range of signals would be examined. an equal number of negative control probes were pooled with viral probes to ensure that a wide range of signals would be examined. the null hypothesis was that a fluorescent signal would not be predicted by G. binomial tests were conducted using the 90th percentile in categorizing probes as \"positive\" or \"negative\" the threshold value for the test, whatever it might be, should be considered a parameter for optimization. a q value of 5% for there to be \"significance\" would indicate that up to 5% of all truly absent viruses may be identified as present. a prediction was considered a \"true positive\" if either the specific virus introduced in the experiment or any other virus in the same genus was predicted. PPV is a useful measure of algorithm performance because it is not sensitive to heterogeneity or misclassification in viral taxonomy; it is not necessary to predict that all members of a genus are present in order to achieve a favorable score. viruses that varied in genome type and length to assess the sensitivity and specificity of three methods for statistically analyzing viral microarray data. the data pool included three single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses: west Nile virus (WNV, strain New York 1999, AF202541, ca 11 kb), SARS coronavirus (HCoV-SARS, strain Tor2, AY274119, ca 30 kb), and human echovirus 18 (EV18, strain Metcalf sense ssRNA 30 Coronaviridae SARS Human Coronavirus Tor2 HCoV-SARS + sense ssRNA 7.4 Arenaviridae Lassa virus strain Josiah LASV - sense ssRNA 19 Filoviridae Zaire ebolavirus ZEBOV - sense ssRNA 0.89 to 2.3 Orthomyxoviridae Influenza A H1N1 Texas 1991 FLUA H1N1 dsDNA 36 A hybridization temperature was calculated as a measure of probe-target binding strength [7], a table of values is available in GEO Series GSE21319. a lowess fit of probe-reverse complement G was also calculated; probes with higher GC content had a greater G. Statistical tests and implementation Three well-known statistical tests were used to evaluate the presence or absence of viruses in our hybridization experiments. a set of negative control probes was used to evaluate the presence or absence of viruses in our hybridization experiments. variables is Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient. the variance assumption has been shown to be a confounder in microarray analysis. in this application, we used the change in the Gibbs free energy values of predicted probe-virus target hybrids. the null hypothesis was that above the threshold, there was no difference between the proportion of virus specific probes and negative control probes. the threshold choice for the binomial test clearly has a strong influence on the results. the threshold choice for the binomial test should be considered a parameter for optimization. the variance assumption has been shown to be a confounder in microarray analysis. in this application, we used the change in the Gibbs free energy values of the predicted probe-virus target hybrids as the independent variable. the dependent variable was the observed probe signal. a single virus were tested against the X2 distribution in such a way that the expected probability was equal to the probability rate of the negative control probes. the threshold choice for the binomial test clearly has a strong influence on the results; the 90th percentile generated the best performance for our needs. a table of correct predictions for each hybridized virus was created by using the NCBI Taxonomy database. a prediction was considered a \"true positive\" if either the specific virus introduced in the experiment or any other virus in the same genus was, thereby, predicted. the top 250 predictions for each method were evaluated. we characterized the effect of a varying input of human RNA on the fluorescence distribution of the log-transformed probe signals. we tested the normality of these distributions and found strong deviations for all three experiments. the observed signal distributions included Gaussian, highly kurtotic and bimodal. b, c) were hybridized to a pathogen microarray comprised of 38,000 probes. the fluorescent signal from the pathogen-specific probes was log-transformed. tests for normality indicated significant deviation, with the following Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z values. replicate probe pairs were better correlated than reverse complement pairs for both WNV cognate probes and non-flavivirus probes. when no WNV was present, reverse complement probes had a higher correlation than when no WNV was present. a substantial decrease in the FPR occurred in the case of both the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman correlation methods as a result. we applied a probe-level correction and found that a substantial decrease in the FPR occurred in the case of both the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman correlation methods. a strong prediction for a chicken endogenous retrovirus was identified from the influenza virus hybridization by all three methods. the virus was cultured in eggs that are likely to express the viral transcripts. a binomial test correctly predicts the viral genus in a majority of cases. 0% 0% 0% 100% ZEBOV 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% HAdV-4 48% 74% 32% 0% 100% 0% 85% 89% 73% FLUA H1N1 99% 96% 95% 100% 100% 100% 100% 97% HSV-1 83% 100% 71% 0% 0% 0% 63% 100% 54% Average 75% 77% 71% 21% 33% 22% 77% 88% 91% Correct top ranked predictions 8/9 8/9 8/9 2/9 the ViroChip dataset was comprised of 56 hybridizations of samples derived from tissue culture, nasal lavage or serum. samples contained papillomavirus, influenza A virus, hepatitis B virus, respiratory syncytial virus or human rhinovirus. the ViroChip platform does include the use of reverse complement probes and employs a random-PCR based nucleic acid amplification strategy that is similar to ours. the first prediction of the binomial test was correct in 75% of the cases. the average correct prediction rank for the binomial test was 1.6. HHV7 has a seroprevelance of 85% in humans. binomial test's performance without optimization was comparable to that of E-Predict (95% correct for first predictions, 100% correct for the first ten) but a binomial test does not require probe-level weighting or assumption of normality. we characterized the effect of a varying input of human RNA on the fluorescence distribution of the log-transformed probe signals. three quantities, 200, 10 and 0 ng of human lung RNA (panels a, b, c) were hybridized to a pathogen microarray comprised of 38,000 probes. the fluorescent signal from the pathogen-specific probes was log-transformed and used to generate histograms. probes that are mismatched to their targets will be strongly affected by the specific mismatch position. amplification products were hybridized on an array containing both replicate and reverse complement probes. human lung RNA was used as a control. top 250 predictions for each statistical test were evaluated. a q-value threshold of 10% was applied; this corresponds to a condition in which 1 in 10 predictions may prove false. the binomial test performed well, achieving a 2% false positive rate. 0% Negative Control (200 ng HuDNA) 100% 0% 100% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Mann-Whitney U Spearman Correlation Binomial test sense anti-sense both sense anti-sense both sense anti-sense both sense anti-sense both sense anti-sense both WNV 100% 100% 100% 0% 0% 0% 100% 100% HCoV-SARS 50% 33% 50% 0% 0% 50% 100% EV18 92% 95% 100% 96% 100% 96% LASV 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 100% 100% VSV 100% 100% 0% 0% the ViroChip platform differs from ours in terms of oligonucleotide probe length. the ViroChip platform does include the use of reverse complement probes. the ViroChip platform does include the use of reverse complement probes. the average correct prediction rank for the Mann-Whitney U test was 3.7. the largest number of incorrect predictions were for human herpesvirus 7 (HHV7), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6A/B) and human herpesvirus 5 (HHV5). the binominal test outperformed the Mann-Whitney test on the ViroChip data. the binomial test's performance without optimization was comparable to that of E-Predict (95% correct for first predictions, 100% correct for the first ten) however, a binomial test does not require probe-level weighting or assumption of normality. a hybridization requirement for both sense and antisense probes was more helpful in reducing the FPR than the use of hybridization to replicate probes. an additional important negative control was the inclusion of shuffled viral probes that enabled examination of the effects of array-wide GC content. the Spearman correlation performed poorly, correctly predicting only three disease agents. PPV on uncorrected signal data was only 48%. the method performs an in silico hybridization between fully sequenced viral genomes and a viral array. supplementary material Additional File 1 Hybridization summary. summary of viral and control hybridizations, corresponding GEO accession numbers and location of data presented in manuscript. we thank Saul Silverstein, Christos Kyratsous, Vincent Racaniello, Angela Rasmussen, Adolfo Garcia-Sastre and Stuart Nichol for providing the samples used in the experiments reported here."}
