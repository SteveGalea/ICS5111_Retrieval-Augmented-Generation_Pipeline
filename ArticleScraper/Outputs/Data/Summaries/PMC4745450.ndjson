{"summary": "mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum are small, fastidious bacteria belonging to the Mollicutes class. they lack a cell wall (preventing staining with Gram stain) and are not sensitively detected on routine bacterial cultures. Optimal recovery requires specialized media and growth conditions. there has been more work on real-time PCR assays for Ureaplasma species. some have described assays but have not evaluated clinical specimens or clinical isolates. a real-time PCR assay that detects and distinguishes U. urealyticum from parvum was described but used to assess 87 vaginal swabs. color change (indicating an alkaline pH shift) in the arginine broth prompted subculture of 50 L to an A7 agar plate. plates were incubated anaerobically at 35\u00b0C for up to 48 hours. a color change (indicating an alkaline pH shift) prompted subculture of 50 L to an A7 agar plate. sources for the inserted target sequences were M. hominis ATCC 23114, U. urealyticum ATCC 27618, and U. parvum ATCC 27815D. sizes of the cloned inserts were confirmed by EcoR1 digestion.

DNA extraction was performed on the MagNA Pure LC 2.0 using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science) with a final elution volume of 100 L. a tuf target corresponds to 527786\u2013527943 of GenBank accession number CP001184. the two assays were independently optimized on the LightCycler 480 II platform. 1 mM MgCl2), 1 mM (additional) MgCl2 and 1X of each of the LightCycler primer-probe sets were added to a 96-well LightCycler 480 plate. extracted nucleic acid (5 L) was then added to each well. positive and negative controls were included in each run. only mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were detected (by the appropriate assays) the limit of detection was the lowest dilution where all six replicates were detected.

PCR positive/culture negative were PCR positive, and all five specimens that tested positive for Ureaplasma species were PCR negative. u. urealyticum alone was detected in 28, U. parvum alone in 109, and both in 2. a previously reported PCR method differentiated between the two species. 4% of tested specimens were PCR positive for M. hominis and 52% for Ureaplasma species. a multiplex PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect cervical swabs from 175 australian women with and without cervicitis. 16% tested positive for M. hominis and 68% for Ureaplasma species. 44% of lower genital tract specimens obtained from healthy women at their first prenatal visit in Belgium were positive for U. parvum and 10% for U. urealyticum [11] despite different geographic locales and clinical status, these numbers are strikingly similar. the described assays overcome the challenges of detection of these organisms by culture."}
