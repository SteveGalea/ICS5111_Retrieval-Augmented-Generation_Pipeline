{"summary": "5853 calves, housed in 15 production cohorts, were followed during one production cycle. main causes of mortality were pneumonia, ruminal disorders, idiopathic peritonitis and enteritis. mortality and morbidity is hardly documented in veal calves. previous studies addressed mortality in veal calves housed in individual stalls. this housing system has been completely abandoned in Europe. the study population consisted of all veal herds in Flanders certified by the Belgian Controlled Veal (BCV) label. of the 295 herds in Belgium, 285 herds (97%) are situated in Flanders and 271 herds (95%) complied with the BCV label. unwanted early slaughter was defined as calves being individually slaughtered before the rest of the group, mostly for reasons of trauma or sudden respiratory symptoms. a gross postmortem examination of the animals which died during production was performed either on farm or at the animal health service-Flanders. inal disorders included frothy bloat and acute ruminal acidosis/rumenitis. cases were classified as enteritis when a macroscopic enteritis and obvious smearing of the hind legs were present at necropsy. calves were classified as idiopathic peritonitis if at least a peritonitis was present. a commercial antigen ELISA for Cryptosporidium parvum, bovine coronavirus, bovine rotavirus and Escherichia coli (F5) was performed on intestinal content (Digestive ELISA kit, Bio-X, Jemelle, Belgium) the presence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was examined by PCR on spleen tissue. a calf was considered a case of a given disease, when treated individually for that indication on at least one day by the producer or veterinarian. a relapse case was defined as a calf receiving a new treatment for the same indication more than 5 and less than 15 days after the last treatment for that indication. Mortality/morbidity rates were calculated as the number of mortalities/diseased calves (initial and relapse) over the number of calf-days-at-risk. for morbidity a calf was considered at risk when present alive in the cohort and not individually treated in the past 14 days. the end of the observation period was the date of slaughter, if death hadn't occurred. separate multivariable models were fit with total morbidity, BRD, enteritis, otitis and arthritis as binary outcome variables. a production cohort was defined as one all in all out production cycle. the study group consisted of 15 production cohorts, in 15 herds. the sample was stratified on production system: dairy (n = 5), crossbred (n = 5) and beef (n = 5) cohorts. pneumonia cases with concurrent pleuritis or pericarditis were classified as pneumonia cases. ruminal disorders included enteritis, enterotoxaemia, mesenteric torsion, intussusception, liver disease, abomasal hemorrhage and peritonitis due to perforating abomasal ulceration. omphalitis as such, omphalo-urachitis, omphaloarteritis and umbilical abscesses were classified according to the major lesion. the group of neurological disorders included hydranencephalia, hydrocephalus and meningitis. calves with congenital heart defects were classified as such. Isolation of respiratory bacteria (Pasteurellaceae and Mycoplasma spp.) from pneumonia lesions was performed according to standard protocols, described elsewhere [22-24] for selected cases of acute pneumonia PCR analysis for bovine herpesvirus 1 (26] and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV) together with virus isolation for bovine adenovirus 3 (BAV-3) and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI-3) was performed at the Veterinary alitis, laryngeal necrobacillosis, nervous symptoms and miscellaneous. all calves were individually identified by ear tag, according to Belgian law. unwanted early slaughter was defined as calves being individually slaughtered before the rest of the group. ruminal disorders included enteritis, enterotoxaemia, mesenteric torsion, intussusception, liver disease, abomasal hemorrhage and peritonitis due to perforating abomasal ulceration. cases in which the liver was involved in an omphaloflebitis were classified as pneumonia cases. hydranencephalia, hydrocephalus and meningitis among neurological disorders. euthanasia due to severe arthritis, limb or vertebral column fractures. calves with congenital heart defects classified as sudden death of unknown origin. a calf was considered a case of a given disease, when treated individually for that indication on at least one day by the producer or veterinarian. an initial case was defined as the first treatment of a calf for a given indication. a relapse case was defined as a calf receiving a new treatment for the same indication more than 5 and less than 15 days after the last treatment for that indication. Mortality data were consistent for 5853 calves. treatment records were judged as unreliable on 5 cohorts. mortality/morbidity rates were calculated as the number of mortalities/diseased calves over the number of calves at risk. separate multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were built. total mortality, pneumonia, enteritis, ruminal disorders, enterotoxaemia, idiopathic peritonitis, death at arrival, perforating abomasal ulceration and arthritis as binary outcome variables. in crossbred cohorts, predominantly HFxBB crossbreds were housed. the average number of calves in the followed cohorts was 390 (SD = 167) the 15 herds were under supervision of 5 different veterinary practices. of the calves that died, on average 82.3% (253/308) was necropsied, ranging from 47.1 to 100.0% at the cohort level. the digestive system accounted for 41.9% of mortality, the respiratory system for 27.7%, the musculoskeletal system for 3.6%, the nervous system for 2.0% and idiopathic peritonitis as such for 14.6%. calves by production system (15 cohorts, 5853 calves, 2007-2009, Belgium) Cause of mortality Total (n = 5853) Dairy (n = 2744) Crossbreds (n = 1624) Beef (n = 1485) Percentage of cohorts affected Mortality risk mean SD (min-max) Mortality risk mean SD (min-max) Mortality risk mean SD (min-max) Mortality risk mean SD (min-max) Mortality risk mean SD (min- enterotoxaemia 66.7 0.5 0.7 (0-2.2) 0.03 0.03 (0-0.11) 0.2 0.2 (0-0.5) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.03) 0.3 0.7 (0-1.0) 0.02 0.04 (0-1.10) 0.01 0.02 (0-1.10) 0.01 0.02 (0-1.10) 0.01 0.02 (0-1.10) 0.01 0.02 (0-1.10) 0.01 0.02 (0-1.10) 0.01 0.02 (0-1.10) 0.01 0.02 (0-1. hemorrhage 26.7 0.1 0.1 (0-0.3) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.02) 0.1 0.1 (0-0.3) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.02) 0.1 0.1 (0-0.3) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.02) 0.1 0.1 (0-0.3) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.02) 0.1 0.1 (0-0.3) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.02) 0.1 0.1 (0-0.3) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.03) 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 (0-0.6) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.03) perforating abomasal ulceration 26.7 0.1 0.2 (0-0.6) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.03) 0.3 0.3 (0-0.03) 0.01 0.02 (0-0.03) Unknown sudden death 6.7 0.1 0.5 (0-1.8) 0.01 0.03 (0-0.10) - - - - - 0.4 0.8 (0-1.8) 0.02 0.04 (0-0.10) Iron shock lais 13.3 0.1 0.1 (0-0.3) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.02) 0.0 0.1 (0-0.2) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.01) orchitis 6.7 0.1 0.1 (0-0.2) 0.01 0.00 (0-0.01) - - 0.1 0.1 (0-0.2) 0.01 0.01 (0-0.01) - = no cases. 5853 white veal calves housed in 15 cohorts in Belgium (2007-2009) three major peaks in total mortality could be identified. first and highest one occurred at week two and most important causes of mortality were pneumonia. crossbred calves were more likely to die from arthritis compared to dairy calves. there was no significant effect of the production system on other causes of mortality. concurrent enteritis and pneumonia occurred in 22 (24.2%) cases. 50%, 18.1%, 13.6% and 4.6% were Cryptosporidium parvum, bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus and Escherichia coli positive respectively. a positive BVDV test was associated with chronic pneumonia (OR = 21.6;

BVDV was associated with chronic pneumonia and pleuritis at necropsy. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
