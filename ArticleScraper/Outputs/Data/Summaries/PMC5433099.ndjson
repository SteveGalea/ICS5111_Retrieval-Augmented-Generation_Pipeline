{"summary": "herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) entry into cells and virus-induced cell-cell fusion require the coordinated action of viral entry glycoprotein D (gD), gH, gL, and gB. gB is trimeric and consists of five domains. gB is trimeric and consists of five domains. the host cell membrane reside at the same end of the molecule as the C terminus of the ectodomain. a central coiled-coil core consisting of three -helices in domain III contributes to the stability of the trimer. the antiparallel packing of this arm against the coiled coil is reminiscent of the six-helix bundle present in the postfusion conformation of class I fusion proteins. the coil-arm region is shown, with the three residues that are mutated in gB 3A shown as red spheres. a region of the genome is expanded to show the UL27 open reading frame (gB opening reading frame) and the neighboring UL26 and UL28 open reading frames (arrowheads indicate gene orientation) lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed for gB. samples were run on a single gel, but the lanes were rearranged for clarity. previous mutagenesis study showed that fusion was impaired by mutations in the domain V arm that were predicted to disrupt the coil-arm interaction (20) gB 3A mutations favor prefusion conformation. mutations did not impact virus binding to cells. increased expression of gH/gL did not compensate for gB 3A fusion defect. pGS3217 and pQF297 BACs were transfected into vero-Cre cells. vero cells were infected with the gB 3A viruses and the GS3217 (WT) virus at 0.01 PFU/cell. western blot assays of virus released into the medium demonstrated that mutant gB was incorporated into the virions. 30 to 50% of the cells infected with GS3217 (WT) virus were red. at 48 hpi, all of the cells infected with the gB 3A viruses were red. at 48 hpi, all of the cells infected with the gB 3A viruses were red. mutations in the gB-encoding gene of gB 3A are responsible for the small-plaque phenotype. mutations in the gB-encoding gene of gB 3A are responsible for the small-plaque phenotype. a defect in gB 3A mutant virus replication was detected at 12, 18, and 24 hpi. by 24 hpi, the mutant virus titers were 3 log units lower than those of the GS3217 (WT) virus. at 12 hpi, the gB 3A virus titers lagged behind the GS3217 (WT) virus titer. viral titers were determined by a plaque assay on vero cells. gB 3A viruses show slow penetration of cells. penetration of the virus was detectable after only 20 min at 37\u00b0C. gB 3A viruses were allowed to adsorb to Vero cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. when the gB 3A viruses were allowed to enter the cells for 2 h at 37\u00b0C before citrate buffer inactivation, plaques formed as expected. gB 3A-1 viruses (C) or gB 3A-2 viruses (D) were added to vero cell monolayers. the cells and viruses were shifted to 37\u00b0C for 0 to 12 h. methylcellulose overlay was added to the cells, and infection was quantified by a plaque assay. at 4\u00b0C, viruses can bind to but not fuse with the cells. at distinct time points, the cells were rinsed with PBS to remove unbound virus and a methylcellulose medium was added. the plaque counts of all viruses increased as the incubation time prior to the PBS washes increased. gB 876T-expressing cells were transfected overnight with plasmid encoding gB 876T or gB 3A-2 virus. plaques were imaged after 3 days. expression of gB 876T partially rescues the gB 3A virus small-plaque phenotype. gB 3A viruses failed to penetrate cells after a 6-h incubation at 37\u00b0C. a small number of plaques were apparent when the gB 3A viruses were incubated with cells for 4 h at 40\u00b0C prior to citrate buffer treatment. methylcellulose overlay was added to the cells, and infection was quantified by a plaque assay. gB 3A mutant protein exhibited reduced fusion in a cell-cell fusion assay using the HSV receptors nectin-1 and HVEM (20) a quantitative cell-cell fusion assay was used to confirm this reduced fusion capacity. if the gB 3A mutations favor the prefusion conformation of gB as we hypothesize, reduced fusion with all HSV receptors is expected. effector CHO cells were transfected with plasmids encoding luciferase. luciferase activity was measured as an indication of cell-cell fusion. luciferase activity was measured as an indication of cell-cell fusion. increased amounts of gH/gL DNA transfected did not enhance cell-cell fusion mediated by gB 3A. greater levels of gH/gL DNA impaired the fusion mediated by gB 3A. results do not exclude possibility that gB 3A mutant has a defect in gH/gL interaction. pGS3217 and pQF297 BACs were transfected into vero-Cre cells. vero cells were infected with the gB 3A viruses and the GS3217 (WT) virus at 0.01 PFU/cell. western blot assays of virus released into the medium showed that mutant gB was incorporated into virions. vero cells were infected with gB 3A-1, gB 3A-2, or WT (G3217) HSV-1 at 0.01. by microscopic examination at 24 h postinfection, 30 to 50% of the cells infected with GS3217 (WT) virus were red. at 48 hpi, all of the cells infected with gB 3A viruses were red. gB 3A viruses formed larger plaques than gB 3A virus. mutations in gB-encoding gene of gB 3A are responsible for small-plaque phenotype. gB 3A viruses have slow growth kinetics. vero cells were infected with gB 3A-1, gB 3A-2, or GS3217 (WT) virus at 5 PFU/cell. by 24 hpi, the mutant virus titers were 3 log units lower than those of the GS3217 (WT) virus. at 12 hpi, the gB 3A virus titers lagged behind the GS3217 (WT) virus titer by more than 5 vero cells in six-well plates were infected with gB 3A-2 virus at 0.01 PFU/cell. at the time points indicated, virus was harvested from total cell lysates. penetration of the G3217 virus was detectable after only 20 min at 37\u00b0C. gB 3A viruses were allowed to adsorb to Vero cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. after 2 h, cells were rinsed with either citric acid buffer or PBS. methylcellulose overlay was added to the cells, and infection was quantified by a plaque assay. gB 3A viruses did not show appreciable penetration until 12 hpi. gB 3A viruses do not exhibit a cell binding defect. 3217 (WT) viruses (200 PFU) were added to vero cell monolayers. at 4\u00b0C, viruses can bind to but not fuse with the cells. at distinct time points, the cells were rinsed with PBS to remove unbound virus. transfected cells were transfected with gB 876T or gB 3A-2 virus. plaques were imaged after 3 days. expression of gB 876T partially rescues gB 3A virus small-plaque phenotype. penetration assay performed at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 8A to C) and 40\u00b0C (Fig. 8D to F) gB 3A viruses failed to penetrate the cells after a 6-h incubation at 37\u00b0C. however, a small number of plaques were apparent when the gB 3A viruses were incubated with cells for 4 h at 40\u00b0C. the gB 3A mutant protein exhibited reduced fusion in a cell-cell fusion assay using the HSV receptors nectin-1 and HVEM (20) a quantitative cell-cell fusion assay was used to confirm this reduced fusion capacity and to test gB 3A fusion by using the PILR receptor, an entry receptor that binds to gB. effector CHO cells were transfected with plasmids encoding luciferase. luciferase activity was measured as an indication of cell-cell fusion. gH/gL heterodimer conveys signal to gB to trigger fusion. gD, gH, gL, and gB 3A were transfected with gB 3A. increased levels of gH/gL DNA impaired fusion mediated by gB 3A. gB 3A mutant has a defect in gH/gL interaction. gB 3A viruses took longer than the WT virus to spread through a culture of Vero cells. growth defects may be due to impaired and/or delayed spread of gB 3A virus. defects in gB 3A egress also may contribute to its small-plaque phenotype and delayed growth. mutant virus mapped to lysine-rich region of gB (residues 68 to 76) mutations are distant from the HS binding site, so these mutations were not expected to affect HS binding. gB 3A mutations are distant from the HS binding site. heat has been used previously as a surrogate trigger for several class I and III fusion proteins to transition from a prefusion to a postfusion conformation. at 37\u00b0C, penetration by the gB 3A viruses required more than 10 h of incubation with cells. however, penetration was detectable after only 4 h at 40\u00b0C. the hypothetical impact of the gB 3A mutations on these states is shown in red. the gB 3A mutations may stabilize the gB prefusion conformation, thereby increasing the EA required to trigger gB and reducing gB fusion capacity. mutations that destabilize the postfusion form could decrease fusion capacity by shifting the equilibrium toward the prefusion state. future experiments will select for second-site revertant mutations to identify potential interactions sites within gB and to investigate how other viral proteins regulate gB fusion activity. pGS1439, a plasmid containing the Kanr-encoding gene, was kindly provided by Gregory Smith, Northwestern University. pGS3217 is an HSV-1 F strain that carries the red fluorescent protein (RFP) tdTomato reporter gene with a nuclear localization signal under the control of a CMV promoter. pGS1439 was digested with AgeI and ligated into AgeI-digested pSG5-HSVgB-I671A/H681A/F683A (20) to generate pQF270. pSG5-HSVgB-I671A/H681A/F683A is a plasmid that carries the gB 3A mutant gene. gB 3A-encoding gene containing a Kanr-encoding gene insert was amplified from pQF270 by PCR with primers ACAAACCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA lysed in 200 l of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO3, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors. proteins were boiled for 5 min under reducing conditions, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 to 20% gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. fluorescence microscopy of RFP expression in infected Vero cells was performed with an EVOS Cell Imaging System (AMG, Fisher Scientific) Plaques of both WT and gB 3A viruses were visualized by Giemsa staining after 3 days of incubation. a cell penetration experiment was performed to assay the cell entry of the HSV-1 gB 3A viruses. GS3217 (WT) virus or GS3217 (WT) virus was diluted to 200 PFU/ml in PBS with 1% heat-inactivated calf serum and 1% glucose, and 1 ml was added to Vero cell monolayers. the cells were rinsed twice with PBS, overlaid with methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) medium, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 days. plaques were visualized by Giemsa staining and imaged by transmitted-light microscopy with an EVOS Cell Imaging System. the cells were detached with Versene and resuspended in 1.5 ml of F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. effector and target cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and replated in 96-well plates for 18 h. the antibodies used included rabbit anti-gB polyclonal antibody (PAb) serum R74 (kindly provided by Patricia Spear, Northwestern University) plasmids expressing human nectin-1 (pBG38; kindly provided by Patricia Spear, Northwestern University) were previously described (49), as were plasmids expressing human nectin-1 (pBG38; kindly provided by Patricia Spear, Northwestern University) pGS1439, a plasmid containing the Kanr-encoding gene, was kindly provided by Gregory Smith, Northwestern University. pSG5-HSVgB-I671A/ pGS3217 was digested with AgeI and ligated into AgeI-digested pSG5-HSVgB-I671A/H681A/F683A (20) to generate pQF270. pSG5-HSVgB-I671A/H681A/F683A is a plasmid that carries the gB 3A mutant gene.
