{"summary": "METHODS AHSG serum levels were determined in treatment-nave newly-diagnosed patients. 96 with ulcerative colitis (UC), 84 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 62 with diarrhea-predominant or mixed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, D- and M- types) all patients were followed for a minimum period of 3 years. IBD individuals who were seropositive had AHSG levels falling within the two lower quartiles. those with at least one marker showed AHSG concentrations within the lowest quartile. AHSG can be used to distinguish between IBD and IBS patients or HC. fetuin A or 2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG) is a substance synthesized in the liver, bone marrow and fetal organs, exhibiting properties similar to those possessed by negative acute-phase proteins. AHSG is also an inhibitor of ectopic tissue calcification such as that taking place in coronary arteries and heart valves. a total of 242 patients were recruited: 96 diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC), 84 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 62 with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) all patients were followed for a minimum period of 3 years at the department of gastroenterology at the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. onset 40 yr - 15 - - 40 yr - 69 - - Sex Male 60 45 36 114 Female 36 39 26 66 Current smoking Yes 24 57 39 93 No 72 27 23 87 Disease extent (UC) Proctitis 16 - - - Left-sided colitis 28 - - Pancolitis 52 - - - Disease location (CD) NS/NP - 49 - - Stricturing - 20 a CDAI score greater than 150 and a CAI score exceeding 4 were considered active CD and active UC respectively. no animals were used for the present study. blood samples were collected upon presentation of patients in our hospital. a calibration curve was generated by plotting the absorbance vs the human AHSG concentration for each calibrator. the control and standard sera were provided by the same company. cut-off levels for positivity were set at 50, 100, 60, and 90 U/mL for gASCA IgG, AMCA IgG, ALCA IgG, and ACCA IgA. AHSG was tested for its ability to predict IBD, UC and CD. a total of 242 patients were recruited: 96 diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC), 84 with Crohn's disease and 62 with. all patients were followed for a minimum period of 3 years at the department of gastroenterology at the University Hospital of larissa, Greece. another group consisting of 180 healthy individuals was also formed (HC) study groups were age and sex matched (P > 0.05) with one exception. the diagnosis of IBD and IBS was established upon the co-evaluation of findings originating from clinical and endoscopic procedures, imaging studies, histopathology and laboratory analyses. patients were also diagnosed and classified as D-IBS or M-IBS (40 and 22 individuals, respectively) according to the Rome III criteria[24] a two-site \"sandwich\" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed using a commercially available human ELISA kit. assay calibrators, controls and prediluted serum samples were added to microplate wells. a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-human AHSG antibody was added to each well. gASCA IgG, anti-mannobioside carbohydrate antibodies (AMCA) IgG, anti-laminariobioside carbohydrate antibodies (ACCA) IgA were also determined in 108 IBD patients. cut-off levels for positivity were set at 50, 100, 60, and 90 U/mL for gASCA IgG, AMCA IgG, ALCA IgG, and ACCA IgA. if a categorical parameter was treated as dependent variable, logistic regression analyses were applied. odds ratios, 95%CIs, unadjusted for confounding, were also calculated. adjusted means were also calculated using analysis of covariance. the optimal cut-off of AHSG for the prediction of IBD was 0.44 g/L (90% sensitivity and specificity) the AUC was 0.94 (95%CI: 0.91-0.97), 0.94 (95%CI: 0.91-0.97) and 0.95 (95%CI: 0.92-0.98) for the prediction of IBD, UC and CD, respectively. AHSG levels with regard to disease characteristics All IBD patients exhibited active disease when blood was drawn for later analysis. in patients with active disease the AHSG levels were marginally associated with CDAI and CAI scores (r = -0.24, P = 0.08) AHSG levels, in the lowest quartile, were associated with both penetrating as well as stricturing disease, before (OR = 4.25, 95%CI: 1.54-11.8 and OR = 1.23, 95%CI: 1.1-8.31, respectively) for age, sex and smoking status (P 0.01, in all cases) Ileum - - 0.32 0.08 Colon - - 0.31 0.09 Ileocolon - - 0.29 0.07 Behavior (CD) NS/NP (a) - - 0.33 0.07 a vs b: 0.01 Stricturing (b) - - 0.26 0.07 a vs c: 0.001 Penetrating (c) - - 0.26 0.06 b vs c: > serum AHSG concentrations were examined with regard to treatment modalities adequate for inducing and maintaining remission during the 3-year follow up period: 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-TNF agents or surgery. the inverse association between AHSG and need for anti-TNF treatment or surgery remained statistically significant. AHSG and its association with IBD markers IBD patients had higher CRP levels (median: 3.2 mg/dL, range: 0.9-29.3 mg/dL) compared to IBS (median: 1.05 mg/dL, range: 0-4.3 mg/dL) and HC groups (median: -0.28, P = 0.07) two serological markers positive exhibited AHSG concentrations within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.12, 95%CI: 2.17-12.08, P 0.001) for single and OR = 5.03 (95%CI: 1.5-5.44) for multiple seropositivity (P 0.001) AHSG levels in serum were 0.33 0.01 g/L, significantly lower than those of IBS patients and HC. UC patients also showed lower AHSG levels (0.34 0.01 g/L) compared to IBS patients and HC (P 0.001). these differences remained significant between UC and CD patients or between IBS patients and HC (P 0.001). AHSG levels with regard to disease characteristics All IBD patients exhibited active disease when blood was drawn for later analysis. in patients with active disease the AHSG levels were marginally associated with CDAI and CAI scores (r = -0.24, P = 0.08) logistic regression was applied to test link between lower AHSG levels and complicated disease behavior. AHSG levels, in the lowest quartile, were associated with both penetrating and stricturing disease, before and after adjustment. AHSG levels were also examined with respect to the presence of one or more IBD-related extraintestinal manifestations. both male and female IBD patients showed comparable AHSG levels (0.32 0.01 g/L and 0.33 0.01 g/L, respectively) both male and female IBD patients showed comparable AHSG levels (P = 0.53). IBD patients showed lower AHSG concentrations (0.26 0.07 g/L and 0.3 0.05 g/L), compared to those adequately treated with 5-ASA or corticosteroids (P 0.05, in both cases) the inverse association between AHSG and need for anti-TNF treatment (r = -0.31, P 0.05) and surgery (r = -0.36, P 0.05). AHSG concentrations in the lowest quartile were classified into quartiles. a model adjusted for other treatment modalities, age, sex, smoking status and disease duration. a correlation study of AHSG with the levels of the inflammatory marker CRP was performed. IBD individuals who were seropositive, for at least one marker, had AHSG levels falling within the two lower quartiles. those with at least two serological markers positive exhibited AHSG concentrations within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.12, 95%CI: 2.17-12.08, P 0.001) a more profound downregulation of AHSG was very well associated with complicated disease behavior and the need for biological anti-TNF treatment or surgery. the finding of an IBD-induced downregulation of AHSG is nothing but surprising since, AHSG levels decrease in the presence of robust inflammation. a further downregulation of AHSG was observed in CD patients with stricturing or penetrating disease compared to those with the ns/np subtype. this is not surprising as a more diffuse transmural inflammation would exert a stronger proinflammatory effect. a study focusing on the characteristics of IBD patients and AHSG levels was performed. none of these characteristics could be linked with significant AHSG variations. a robust downregulation of AHSG levels correlated with the need for anti-TNF therapy. a careful examination of AHSG's potential implication in the pathogenesis and complications of IBD should be performed. a decrease in circulating AHSG is present in IBD, but it would be logical to hypothesize that an accompanying reduced inhibition of vascular and valvular calcification would also be present. a defective coordination in mineral use, predominantly that of calcium, may lead to urolithiasis. 80% of urinary stones consist of calcium salts. it is within reason to test for additional candidates involved in calcium homeostasis and urinary manifestations. AHSG seems to emerge as a molecule of potential diagnostic value in IBD. additional links with acute phase protein C-reactive protein and serological markers linked to IBD course, the anti-glycan antibodies, have been found. applications AHSG could serve as an additional marker for IBD diagnosis and prediction of a more challenging course requiring treatment with biological agents or surgery. AHSG may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of IBD."}
