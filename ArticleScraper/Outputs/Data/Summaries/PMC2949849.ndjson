{"summary": "RNAi is a versatile tool with a wide range of applications, from reverse genetics to high throughput screening of drug targets. the key therapeutic advantage of using RNAi lies in its ability to specifically and potently knock-down the expression of disease-causing genes of known sequence. RNAi is a basic pathway in eukaryotic cells. RNAi is mediated by short RNA duplexes hitchhiking a cellular pathway that silences genes in a sequence-specific manner at the mRNA level. dsRNA (short hairpin RNA, shRNA) is chopped up by Dicer, a ribonuclease III family member, into small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes 21-23 nt in length with symmetric 2-3 nucleotide (n microRNAs (miRNAs) are generated from the dsRNA region of the hairpin-shaped precursors. siRNAs are derived from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) the pre-miRNA enters the same pathway as the above mentioned siRNA. dsRNA generating duplex siRNAs with 2 nt 3' overhangs activate the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) which unwinds the RNA and recruits only the guiding strand to target mRNA which is subsequently cleaved and degraded. potential therapeutic targets for RNA interference RNAi-based therapy for human cancer is one of the most rapidly progressing applications for virally delivered shRNA. expression of a single miRNA in vivo can reverse disease progression in a liver cancer model [31,30] this opened up a whole new replacement therapy field for cancer treatment using RNAi. human pathogenic viruses are also excellent targets for RNAi because, as exogenous sequences, they are unique in the host. current clinical trials for siRNA therapeutics disease Mode of administration Status Company Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Topical Phase II Allergan Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Local/direct Phase II Alnylam Liver cancer (HCC and others) Systemic Phase I Nucleonics Solid tumors Systemic/local Phase I Calando Silence Therapeutics AG Acute renal failure Systemic Phase I Quark Pharmaceuticals/Pfizer Diabetic macular edem clinical trials were performed with unmodified siRNAs. failure of this first clinical phase III study highlights the need for second generation siRNA therapeutics. most of the proposed clinical applications incorporate chemically synthesized 21 nt siRNA duplexes with 2 nt 3' overhangs. adenoviruses are medium-sized, non-enveloped viruses with a nucleocapsid and a linear dsDNA genome. adenoviruses are medium-sized, non-enveloped viruses with a nucleocapsid and a linear dsDNA genome. they are able to replicate in the nucleus of mammalian cells but do not efficiently integrate into the host's genome. there are 53 described serotypes in humans, and AdVs are responsible for 5-10% of upper respiratory infections in children and many infections in adults. entry of adenoviruses and their vectors into cells involves two sets of interactions between the virus and the host cell. adenoviral vectors exhibit no clear tissue tropism, however the relevant surface receptors are often absent in the tissue of interest. new methods for producing recombinant AAV using single adenoviral genes have made adenoviral co-infection dispensable. new methods for producing recombinant AAV using single adenoviral genes have made adenoviral co-infection of cells dispensable. recombinant vectors stably expressing shRNA against the AR gene eliminated prostate xenografts in nude mice. both adenoviral (AdV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are non-integrating and therefore pose only minimal risks of insertional mutagenesis. retroviruses encode accessory proteins involved in regulating viral replication or the host cell response to the virus. at each end of the genome, long terminal repeats contain promoter/enhancer regions and sequences involved in integration. retroviral entry and genome integration do not require viral protein synthesis. retroviruses were among the first vectors used as transfer vehicles for hairpin-RNA expressing plasmids. most prominent were the works of Paddison et al. [80] and Berns et al. [81] both published in 2004. lentiviral vectors can accommodate large (up to 7.5 kb) amounts of DNA. they can accommodate large (up to 7.5 kb) amounts of DNA. the most advanced and safest forms are the engineered \"self-inactivating\" vectors. lentiviral vectors can transport large amounts of genetic data leaving copious space for creative combination of gene therapy and silencing vectors. lentiviral vectors have been used successfully to regulate target genes in the brain after local injection. lentiviral vectors have been used successfully to regulate target genes in the brain after local injection [42,90,91]. baculovirus-based shRNA expression is currently used to target different viral infections, for example HCV replication [100,101] and Influenza virus A and B [102] but the effects are transient, since a major limitation of baculoviral transduction vectors is the short duration of transgene expression. there is still a long way to go before promising results find their way into human therapy trials. LV and MLV have no oncolytic activity, and shRNA-expression cassettes are used to fulfill effector functions. in already infected HIV-1-positive patients gene transfer is under consideration. a strategy based on exploiting an HIV-based lentiviral vector has entered clinical trials. retroviruses have been studied extensively for almost 100 years. the work until now has culminated in the first clinical trials [121] using replicating MLVs in vivo. the size of the viral genome is limited to roughly 11 kb. adenoviruses are medium-sized, non-enveloped viruses with a nucleocapsid and a linear dsDNA genome. they are able to replicate in the nucleus of mammalian cells but do not efficiently integrate into the host's genome. many reports describe replicating MLVs for gene therapy using inserted suicide genes. adenoviral vectors are responsible for 5-10% of upper respiratory infections in children and many infections in adults. adenoviral vectors are a common delivery method to introduce shRNA-expression cassettes into target cells in vivo. adenoviral vectors are a common delivery method to introduce shRNA-expression cassettes into target cells in vitro. different reviews have summarized adenoviral shRNA delivery in great detail. adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have also been tested in clinical studies in multiple tissues. one study exploited AAV expressing shRNAs against Hec1. repeated intratumoral administration caused anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in tumor cells. systemic delivery of recombinant AAV vectors stably expressing shRNA against the AR gene eliminated prostate xenografts in nude mice. both adenoviral (AdV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are non-integrating. retroviral entry and genome integration do not require viral protein synthesis. all viral genes in the vector genome can be replaced with foreign sequences. retroviral entry and genome integration do not require viral protein synthesis. retroviruses were among the first vectors used as transfer vehicles for shRNA expression cassettes. the most prominent were the works of Paddison et al.
