{"summary": "the international civil aviation organization has forecast that passenger traffic around the world will more than double, from 2.7 billion in 2011 to 6 billion annually by 2030. this will increase the frequency of transmission of communicable diseases [2] such as influenza [3], measles [4], SARS [5] and particularly tuberculosis (TB) during air travel. a systematic review on contact investigations associated with air travel in 2010 argued that the evidence for TB transmission in commercial aircraft is limited and that there is reason in japan, the TB notification rate has declined in the past six decades. 8,000 smear-positive TB cases are still reported every year. 8,000 smear-positive TB cases are still reported every year. a questionnaire survey on air travel-associated TB contact investigations was conducted in the local health offices of Japan from 2012 to 2015. the aim of the study was to estimate the risk of TB transmission associated with air travel, particularly using the IGRA positivity among children and young adult contacts as the outcome indicator. the initiator health office usually obtains information from the airline company on seating positions of the index case. it then sends letters to the health offices where the contacts live to request health screening. data collection was conducted from late November 2015 through March 2016. data analysis The investigated contacts were pooled and classified by age groups. the positivity was calculated as a whole, by age under 35 years and by age groups. events with an index case with smear-negative TB or unknown smear status were excluded. the initiator health office usually obtains information from the airline company on seating positions of the index case as well as the contacts who were seated in the two rows in front of and behind the index case. it then sends letters to the health offices where the contacts live to request health screening. results Of the 486 local health offices of Japan, 451 (93%) responded. a total of 17 health offices reported that they took the lead in one or more of the contact investigations on 19 index TB patients who boarded airplanes between February 2012 and September 2015. number of eligible contacts reached is a sum of the number of eligible contacts screened and the number of eligible contacts who declined being tested. of the total 651 contacts, 25 (3.8%; 95% CI: 2.5\u20135.6) were positive for IGRA. a cochran-armitage test revealed there was a statistically significant increasing trend between age group and positivity of IGRA test results. for eight contacts with negative IGRA test results reported by the implementer health offices, the information on flight date, flight route or flight number was not available. no contact developed TB disease after contact with a TB case on an airplane. most commercial aircrafts used for long-distance flights have installed good ventilation systems with air exchange rates of more than 10 times per hour. we have collected the IGRA test results of more than 600 passenger contacts, enabling us to stratify them into age groups and analyse the data of the age group of 0\u201334 years-olds. study was a questionnaire survey administered to the health offices of japan. but the main conclusion would not change. some health offices may not have conducted air travel-associated contact investigations. countries with a high burden of TB should prioritise other, more important, activities [8]."}
