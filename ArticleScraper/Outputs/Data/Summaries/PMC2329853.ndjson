{"summary": "many have wrestled with the challenge of codifying the process of proving causation. based on the germ theory of disease of Pasteur, Koch and Loeffler proposed criteria that define a causative relationship between agent and disease. implication is more difficult when classical hallmarks of infection are absent or mechanisms of pathogenesis are indirect or subtle. pathogenesis may be immune-mediated as in hepatocellular carcinoma due to persistent hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections [14],[15]. infection can also impair immune function, opening the door to opportunistic pathogens. pathogen discovery poses challenges for pathogen discovery. clinicians and epidemiologists are the prime movers in pathogen discovery. clinical acumen, pathology, serology, and classical culture techniques are key. singleplex PCR assays have revolutionized blood banking, drug management of HIV, and containment of outbreaks of infectious disease. however, multiplex assays simultaneously entertain many hypotheses. syndromic multiplex PCR assays allow rapid examination of up to 30 candidates. the most advanced technology will fail if samples are degraded, and data will be uninterpretable without accurate information on clinical course and sample provenance. in chronic diseases, early exposure and/or genetic susceptibility may influence pathogenesis."}
