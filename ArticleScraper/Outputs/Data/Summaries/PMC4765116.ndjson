{"summary": "cellular stressors and apoptosis-inducing agents have been shown to induce ribosomal RNA (rRNA) degradation in eukaryotic cells. it is not clear how widespread chemotherapy induced \u201cRNA disruption\u201d is, the extent to which it is associated with drug response or what the mechanisms are. apoptosis and RNA disruption, while inhibition of caspase-3 activity significantly reduced RNA disruption. RNA disruption is induced by multiple chemotherapy agents in cell lines from different tissues."}
