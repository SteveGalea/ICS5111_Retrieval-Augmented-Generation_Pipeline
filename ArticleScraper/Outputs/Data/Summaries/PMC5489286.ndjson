{"summary": "vaccines traditionally made from inactivated virus grown in embryonated eggs. however, this approach has several limitations including manufacturing delays while vaccine seed viruses are egg-adapted. insecurity of egg supply with potential of supply disruption if pandemic virus also infects chicken flock. Advax adjuvant has been shown to enhance immunogenicity of vaccines against a wide range of diseases including influenza,11-13 hepatitis B,14 hepatitis B,14 sARS coronavirus,15 Japanese encephalitis,16 west Nile virus,17 RSV,18 anthrax,19 Listeria,20 HIV21 and Peste de petit ruminants. the vaccine with Advax adjuvant provided over 3-fold antigen dose-s vaccines relying on cultivation of adapted influenza virus in eggs took 3\u20134 months to establish. vaccine seed strain initially distributed by CDC was A/H1N1/California/04/2009. several clones had a Proline at position 200 (Pro200) in the HA1 domain. no perfect match was found, a situation that is not uncommon in initial cloning of seasonal influenza strains. both pro200 and ser200 rHA protein variants were then manufactured so their behavior could be studied. HI assays were performed with fresh chicken and swine red blood cells (RBCs) the undiluted Ser200 rHA monovalent bulk only had a hemagglutination titer of 3, equivalent to 0.07 Units/g HA protein, indicating a exceptionally low agglutination activity. structural modeling approaches to rapidly build 3-D models of HA from novel influenza strains. this permits rapid analysis of virus behavior in advance of wet-laboratory characterization. a homology model of a/California/04/2009 HA was generated using modeler. the receptor is now capable of entering deep into the binding pocket. hydration of H-bonding sites is avoided and this may result in a more stable binding of the Pro200 HA with its receptor. SF3 was isolated from a patient admitted to Flinders Medical Center in south Australia with acute influenza infection. the isolate was propagated in MDCK cells and the HA gene sequenced and confirmed to match the published H1N1/2009pdm sequence. the immune sera from Ser200 rHA immunized mice was also able to neutralise the HA activity of a commercial inactivated. pro200 rHA gave the correct HA titer (1:5000), indicating it contained an equivalent agglutination epitope to wild type H1N1/2009pdm virus. when a monovalent inactivated A/California/07/2009 vaccine became available this was also used to conduct HI assays in parallel with the SF3 and Pro200 rHA antigens. HI titres were measured by HI assay using guin HI and MNT results were compared at baseline and post the second immunisation in the groups that received 45g Panblok-H1 with or without Advax adjuvant. at baseline, most samples had low or undetectable HI titres, although many were positive by the MNT assay, indicating the HI assay had a lower sensitivity than the MNT assay. the vaccine induced similar proportions of both HI and MNT antibodies. the mean fold increase in HI and MNT was 2\u20133-fold higher when compared with Panblok-H1 alone. the vaccine induced similar proportions of both HI and MNT antibodies. say detects neutralising antibodies targeting the HA stem that neutralise both homologous and heterologous strains. HI assays only detect neutralising antibodies directed against the HA head. this suggests the MNT assay was detecting other types of neutralising antibodies such as those that target the HA stem region. age had an effect on baseline antibody responses. subjects older than 40 y had higher baseline titres against A/PR8 and A/X31 virus. no correlation between age at the time of immunization and fold-change in MNT to H1N1/2009pdm. baculovirus clones were cloned into a baculovirus transfer vector. was then used to transfect SF+ insect cells using calcium phosphate precipitation with linearized Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus. no perfect match was found, a situation that is not uncommon in initial cloning of seasonal influenza strains. female BALB/c mice (n = 5 mice/group) were immunized twice intramuscularly (i.m.) with 1ug Cal04 Ser200 rHA alone or with Advax delta inulin adjuvant. bled 2 weeks after second immunization for measurement of anti-influenza IgG1 and IgG2a levels by ELISA. characterization and structural determination of key viral receptor proteins takes considerable time. this allows rapid analysis of virus behavior in advance of wet-laboratory characterization. ser200 is located above the H192 that forms the base of the pocket. this prevents the receptor contacting the base of the binding pocket. this may cause the HA to bind its receptor with a reduced affinity. receptor is now capable of entering deep into the pocket. rHA antigen had no agglutination activity in vitro. it retained agglutination activity and agglutination activity of a local pandemic virus isolate named SF3. the isolate was propagated in MDCK cells and the HA gene sequenced. the 2 variant rHA sequences produced during the initial baculovirus cloning that contained Pro200 in the receptor-binding site did have potent RBC agglutination activity. we tested the Pro200 rHA for recognition by a reference ferret hyperimmune sera to A/California/07/2009. the SF3 antigen, then inactivated A/California/07/2009 grown in eggs, and with the highest estimate obtained using the Pro200 rHA. the fold-change in pre- to post-immunisation HI titers in study subjects was highly correlated between the 3 different HA antigens. three weeks after a single rHA immunization, the highest responders were younger subjects who received the highest rHA dose together with Adv most samples had low or undetectable HI titres, indicating the HI assay had a lower sensitivity than the MNT assay. however, there was only a very weak correlation between baseline HI and MNT results in each individual. this suggests that MNT can identify subjects who despite being negative by HI nevertheless have seroprotective levels of neutralising non-HI antibodies. H1/Advax to induce broadly neutralising antibodies against other influenza strains, HI and MNT assays were also performed against the historic H1N1 strain, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/PR8) and the H3N1 strain, A/Hong Kong/1/68 x A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/X31) the MNT assay detects neutralising antibodies targeting the HA stem that neutralise both homologous and heterologous strains subjects 40 y vs. > 40 y *p 0.05 (C) showed baseline MNT assay results. subjects older than 40 y had higher baseline titres against SF3. no correlation between age at the time of immunization and fold-change. development of Panblok-H1/Advax was performed in just 3 months from initial virus identification to first human trial dose administered. baculovirus expression technology was extremely fast as it avoided the need for creation of egg- or cell culture adapted influenza viruses. rHA was expressed from the initial CDC recommended A/California/04/2009 reference sequence. the HA sequence was mutated back to the CDC A/California/04/2009 Ser200 reference sequence which had the agglutination problem. in future, it should be possible to use the 14-day PCR mycoplasma assay thereby removing 2 weeks from the time needed for vaccine release. panblok/Advax was the first H1N1/2009 vaccine in the world to become available for clinical testing. Advax adjuvant induced a 3-fold increase in MNT tters vs. 2-fold higher titers by HI assay. HI assay did not detect any vaccine effects on heterologous antibodies against the A/PR8 or A/X31 virus strains. studies of H5N1 vaccines have demonstrated the vital importance of adjuvants for high levels of seroprotection. the reason why seasonal vaccines generally do not require adjuvants is that most people have already been primed by past seasonal influenza infections. wet-laboratory methods for study of new viruses require that the virus first be successfully cultured. even then there is a risk that the virus will mutate in culture and not be fully representative of the wild-type viruses causing the pandemic. this was highlighted by the problems of the reference sequence, with the rHA from this sequence having no agglutination activity. no pandemic vaccine based on inactivated virus was yet available. recombinant baculovirus stock was added to a bioreactor containing SF+ cells and incubated for 48\u201372 hours. infected cells were then removed from the bioreactor. the SRID assay for HA antigen content were not available at the time of Panblok-H1 formulation. initial lots were formulated based on the protein content determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. the extractible antigen of the filled vials was 3, 11 and 45 g respectively. serum was pre-treated with 3 volumes of receptor destroying enzyme (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) the enzyme was inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and samples were mixed with 6 parts of 1% guinea pig red blood cells (gRBCs) 50l of the serially diluted samples and 50l of virus were mixed in 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37oC with 5% CO2. standard antibodies with a mid-range titer were included as a positive control. incubation was done overnight at 37oC with 5% CO2. microneutralisation gives results as end point titer which is expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum with infected cells number less than X. a negative MNT titer was assigned a value of 5, which was half of the minimum detectable; and titres greater than the final dilution were assigned a value of 1280, which was twice the maximum detectable. preparation of ligand and receptor for docking calculation was conducted using the program Autodock Tools (ADT) polar hydrogen was added to the receptor and it was followed by the assignment of Kollman united atom partial charges. all the torsion angles in the ligand were set free to allow flexible docking. initial lots were formulated based on the protein content determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay. extractible antigen of the filled vials was 3, 11 and 45 g respectively. the clinical trial commenced on 18 July 2009, making this the first pandemic vaccine to enter clinical testing worldwide. 281 subjects were enrolled, randomized, had baseline serology and received the first vaccine dose, with subjects predominantly Caucasian (96.4%), with a median age of 52 y. many trial subjects belonged to high-risk groups recommended for seasonal influenza vaccination and 71.2% had already received the 2009 season trivalent influenza vaccine. the geometric mean, 95% confidence intervals and p-values were determined for pre- and post- patient serum HAI data sets using Graphpad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) the MNT assay was performed in 2 steps: a virus-antibody reaction step, where the virus is mixed with the antibodies present in the samples, and an inoculation step, where the madin-darby canine Kidney cells were added in 96-well 100l per well of detection biotin-anti-mouse IgG1 1:5,000 in 1% BSA/PBS antibody plus Streptavidin-HRP 1:2,000 were added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. after washing, 50l per well of DAB substrate was added and incubated for about 10 minutes to allow color development. Molecular docking of sialic acid receptors were performed using the program Autodock vina version 1.1.2.48. polar hydrogen was added to the receptor and it was followed by the assignment of Kollman united atom partial charges. all the torsion angles in the ligand were set free to allow flexible docking. vant was supported by National Institutes of Health [Contracts AI061142 and HHSN272200800039C] development of AdvaxTM adjuvant was supported by national institutes of health. the publication's contents are solely the responsibility of the authors."}
