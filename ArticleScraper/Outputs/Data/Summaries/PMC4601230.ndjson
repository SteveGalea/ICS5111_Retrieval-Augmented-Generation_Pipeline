{"summary": "multiplex SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction was developed for simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory RNA viruses. each set of multiplex methods detected four viruses, the first set: respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 - 4. a, sore throat, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, headache, fever, and in some cases malaise and myalgia; in lower respiratory infections (LRI), the symptoms are pneumonia, bronchitis and bronchiolitis. it has become a challenge for physicians to differentiate viral causes from bacterial ones, which may decrease the excessive use of antibiotics. 172 respiratory specimens of hospitalized patients with influenza-like illnesses were collected from 23 September 2012 until 22 September 2013. RNA was extracted from 200 L of each sample using high pure viral nucleic acid kit (Roche, Germany) three multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR assays were developed for simultaneous detection of 12 respiratory RNA viruses.

RNA was extracted from 200 L of each sample using high pure viral nucleic acid kit. RT-PCR buffer, dNTPs, random hexamer, reverse transcriptase enzyme and RNase inhibitor was mixed with 24 L of extracted RNA. reverse transcription was performed at 37\u00b0C for one hour. 229E-F CATACTATCAACCCATTCAACAAG M 137 94.47 229E-R CACGGCAACTGTCATGTATT PIV1-F ACCTACAACAACATC HN 129 87.75 PIV1-R CTTCCTGCTGGTGTGTTAAT PIV2-F CCATTTACCTAAGTGATGGAA HN 116 89.04 PIV2-R CGTGGCATAATCTT PIV3-F ACCAGGA each reaction had a total volume of 25 L, including 12.5 L SYBR Green master mix, 200 nmol of each forward and reverse primers, 5 L cDNA plus 7.1 L ddH2O. RNA samples and PCR master mixes were prepared under biosafety hoods in different rooms. aviruses NL63, 229E, SARS, OC43, the only detected virus was 1 (0.58%) NL63. male:female proportion was 20:9, indicating males were more affected than females. the mean age was 33.27 years and the median was 32 years. some studies have reported difficulties in detection of RSV with swabs. HMPV is the closest human virus to RSV (19) parainfluenza viruses cause a range of respiratory illness from 30 - 50% of URIs including otitis media to 0.3% of hospitalized children. there were 39 (22.6%) children less than six years old, in which 1 (2.56%) coronavirus NL63 was detected. a french study found an incidence of 9.3% out of 300 specimens during five months."}
