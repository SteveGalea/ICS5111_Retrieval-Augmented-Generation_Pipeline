{"summary": "the HCV genome encodes a single polyprotein, which is processed by cellular and viral proteases into 10 mature proteins (3). the envelope glycoproteins are two highly glycosylated type I transmembrane (TM) proteins, each with an N-terminal ectodomain of about 160 or 330 amino acids, respectively. dimers are slow, interdependent, complex processes that involve the ER chaperone machinery and disulfide bond formation as well as glycosylation. this glycoprotein is considered the major target of neutralizing antibodies, and it is also the receptor-binding protein, which has been shown to interact with CD81 tetraspanin and scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1), two HCV coreceptors. a rearrangement of E1E2 complexes occurs during the assembly of HCV particles to yield a trimeric form of the E1E2 heterodimer. the fusion protein is most likely kept in an inactive prefusion state so as to avoid premature fusion with internal membranes during virion release. this revealed the presence of SDS-resistant trimers of E1 on cell culture-derived HCV. the human anti-E1 monoclonal antibody 1C4 was obtained from Innogenetics, Belgium. Mutations were introduced in a modified version of the plasmid encoding the full-length JFH1 genome. this virus contains mutations at the C terminus leading to amino acid changes F172C and P173S. the plasmids were verified by sequencing. the HCV core protein was quantified by a fully automated chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. large extracellular loops of recombinant human CD81 in fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST) were produced. the beads were coated with the recombinant CD81 for 2 h at 4\u00b0C and washed twice in PBS\u20131% Triton X-100. they were then incubated for 2 to 4 h with E1E2-containing lysates. Huh-7 cells transfected with HCV RNA were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips. cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. both primary- and secondary-antibody incubations were carried out for 30 min at room temperature with 10% goat serum. Oligonucleotides for PCRs were designed to fuse the TM domains of E1 and E2 in the C-terminal position to the carrier proteins GST and thioredoxin (Trx) as described previously (35). a linker sequence coding for the Asp-Pro dipeptide was inserted between GST or Trx and each TM domain. ino acids observed only once at a given position among the 27 sequences are indicated by lowercase letters. hydrophilic and hydrophobic positions are color-coded according to their hydrophobicity. hydrophobic residues are shown in yellow and gray, respectively.

Huh-7 cells transfected with HCV RNA were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips. cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. both primary- and secondary-antibody incubations were carried out for 30 min. a linker sequence coding for the Asp-Pro dipeptide was inserted between GST or Trx and each TM domain. amino acids of the transmembrane domains of E1 (TME1) and E2 (TME2) are numbered with respect to the H77 infectious clone. amino acids observed only once at a given position are indicated by lowercase letters. conserved hydrophilic and hydrophobic positions are highlighted in yellow and gray. polar residues in orange (Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln) and positively charged groups of basic (His, Lys, Arg) and acidic (Glu, Asp) residues in blue and red. baclink CAGAATTCCTAAGCGTCAACACCAGC EcoTME1 CAGAATTCCTAAGCGTCAACACCAGC EcoTME2 CAGAATTCCTAAGCGTCAACACCAGC EcoTME2 CAGAATTCCTAAGCTTCAGCCAGC bacG354L_1 ATCGCTGGTGCTCACTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGG TME1 was fused to the C terminus of Trx encoded by the pET32a(+) plasmid (Novagen) an oligonucleotide hybridizing to the linker sequence (baclink) and an oligonucleotide adding an EcoRI site downstream of the 3\u2032 end of TME1 were used to amplify the linker-TME1 sequence. pGEXKT-TME2 or pGEXKT-TME2-C731/734A were introduced into the unique EcoRI site of pGEXKT-TME2 or pGEXKT-TME2-C731/734A. fusion proteins were expressed in BL21-Gold(DE3)[pLysS] (Stratagene) as described in reference 35. the blots were washed three times, for 10 min each time, in 20 ml of PBST buffer. the blots were then washed three times, for 10 min each time, in 20 ml of PBST buffer. the blots were then revealed by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit. a 3-dimensional (3D) model of TME2 was built by setting the / angle at canonical values for -helical secondary-structure elements (8) followed by an energy minimization. we then modeled a TME1\u2013TME2 heterodimer assembly using structural restraints based on a Lys370 (TME1)\u2013Asp728 (TME2) salt bridge and an asn367 (TME1)\u2013Asp728 (TME2) inter the presence of intermolecular disulfide bonds leading to the formation of very large complexes does not allow identification of the basic oligomeric state of HCV envelope glycoproteins present on the surface of the virion. a control gradient with known globular protein standards was spun in parallel to serve as a calibration. HCV envelope glycoproteins from a semipurified viral preparation were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 and were separated by sedimentation through a 5-to-20% sucrose gradient. samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for the presence of E1 and E2 glycoproteins. a similar treatment has been shown previously to preserve the quaternary structure of the influenza virus spike protein and the trimeric form of the Semliki Forest virus fusion protein (38, 39). to select functional envelope glycoproteins associated with the viral particle, we pulled down E1E2 complexes by the use of a GST-CD81 fusion protein. amino acids are strictly conserved in only 24% of sequence positions (marked with asterisks) this indicates that the overall structure of the transmembrane domain of E1 (designated TME1) is conserved among the various HCV genotypes. the GxxxG motif, including residues 354 and 358 (7) belonging to the helical region (7, 9), appears to be almost fully conserved among HCV genotypes. oligomers present in infected-cell lysates could be pulled down with GST-CD81. replacement of one or both glycine residues within the GxxxG motif abolished the formation and/or stabilization of E1 trimers. however, E1 dimers seemed to be only marginally affected by glycine mutations, indicating that the GxxxG motif is not essential for the formation and/or stabilization of E1 dimers. glycine residues of the GxxxG motif in the TM domain of E1 were replaced individually (G354L or G358L) or together (G354L/G358L) by leucine in the context of the HCVcc system. cells were electroporated with HCV RNA transcribed in vitro. the lack of infectivity could be due to a blockade in particle secretion. however, no infectivity was associated with cells transfected with the mutant RNA molecules. to distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured the expression and release of core protein. an important issue that we were interested in investigating concerns the potential role of E2 in the process of E1 trimer formation. we also wanted to check whether this motif could play some role in the entry function of HCV envelope glycoproteins. we then produced HCVpp containing only E1 in order to determine the potential role of E2 in E1 trimerization. the formation of E1 trimers is dependent on the presence of E2 in HCVpp. the absence of E1 on HCVpp strongly reduces expression of E2. we then tested the effects of glycine mutations in the GxxxG motif in the context of the HCVpp system. the infectivity of HCV pseudoparticles was measured by titrating the unconcentrated viral supernatants onto Huh-7 cells. virions contained a viral GFP marker gene that leads to the expression of GFP in successfully infected target cells. the amount of viral capsid in each viral supernatant was quantified by immunoblotting with an anti-capsid antibody. the TM domain of E1 (TME1) expressed in E. coli forms GxxxG-dependent trimers and TME1\u2013TME2 oligomers. Bacteria expressing thioredoxin (Trx) fused to wild-type TME1 (Trx-TME1) or to TME1 displaying either the G354L, G358L, or G354L and G358L (G354/358L) mutations were we coexpressed the Trx-TME1 construct with the GST-TME2 fusion protein. this protein contains the TM domain of E2 (TME2) at the C terminus of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein, in E. coli. hetero-oligomeric complexes could also be clearly observed. 2 heterodimer assembly based on a Lys370 (TME1)\u2013Asp728 (TME2) salt bridge and an Asn367 (TME1)\u2013Asp728 (TME2) interhelical hydrogen bond. several orientations of TME2 relative to TME1 are possible, including the interaction of TME2 either with a single TME1 monomer or with two adjacent TME1 monomers. schematically represented as orange circles at four representative positions for a single TME1\u2013TME2 heterodimer. E1 and E2 ectodomains are represented as blue and yellow ovals. TME1 and TME2 are represented as helix projections. Fractions were harvested and were analyzed for the presence of HCV envelope glycoproteins. before SDS-PAGE analysis, we first performed a pulldown experiment with Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNA) coupled to agarose. this allows enrichment in E1E2 glycoproteins. HCVcc particles were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and HCV envelope glycoproteins were pulled down with a GST-CD81 fusion protein. the proteins were treated with Laemmli sample buffer and were heated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C (no thermal denaturation) before separation by SDS-PAGE. no homo-oligomeric species of E2 (or undetectable levels) were observed. the binding of CD81 to E2 depends on the proper folding of this viral glycoprotein. together, the pulldown of E1 trimers with CD81 indicates the formation of E1E2 complexes. mutated the GxxxG motif by replacing glycine with leucine. this is a bulky hydrophobic residue able to disrupt potential homo-oligomerization. we then analyzed these mutants under the same SDS-PAGE reducing conditions described above. mutations on E1E2 interaction measured proportion of E1 protein coprecipitated with E2 in a CD81 pulldown assay. however, the double mutant led to a 40% decrease in E1E2 heterodimerization. together, these data indicate that the GxxxG motif is essential for E1 trimerization. the asterisk on the right shows an additional band revealed with the anti-E2 antibody. in a parallel experiment, HCV envelope glycoproteins were pulled down with the GST-CD81 fusion protein, treated with Laemmli sample buffer, and heated for 5 min at 70\u00b0C. the ratio of coprecipitated E1 glycoprotein to E2 was measured by quantifying the bands by densitometry. in vitro-transcribed RNAs of the GxxxG mutants were electroporated into Huh-7 cells. at 72 h postelectroporation, intracellular and extracellular infectivities (A) per milliliter were determined by titration. the amount of intracellular core protein is expressed as the fold increase in core expression over the level measured at 4 h postelectroporation. no trimer of E1 was observed in the absence of E2. the large amount of E1 monomer observed in the presence of E2 could be attributed to some unassembled E1E2 hetero-oligomers in HCVpp. the glycine mutations had drastic effects on the entry functions of HCV envelope proteins. we could therefore analyze the role of the TM domain of E1 in the homo-oligomerization of this protein. the TM domain of E1 can form trimers. several oligomeric forms of Trx-TME1 resistant to SDS could be observed. oligomeric forms of TME1 were found to be associated with E. coli membrane fractions. inclusion bodies yielded essentially monomeric forms, suggesting that TME1 oligomers are formed exclusively in the membrane context (35) homo-oligomeric forms of Trx-TME1 and GST-TME2 are indicated. hetero-oligomers are formed when the TM domains of E1 and E2 are coexpressed. heterodimerization could occur in the context of the TM domains devoid of their ectodomains. Molecular modeling of the TME1 trimer and TME1\u2013TME2 assembly. the obvious implication of the GxxxG motif in the trimerization of E1 enabled us to construct computational molecular models to evaluate whether a trimeric TME1 structure involving a GxxxG motif is possible. in this model, glycine residues 354 and 358 point toward each other. symmetric model was constructed by assuming the implication of glycine 354 and glycine 358 of each monomer at the trimer interfaces. dashed red lines indicate interhelical amide proton distances used in the modeling protocol. theoretical model of TME1\u2013TME2 interaction assuming a Lys370 (TME1)\u2013Asp728 (TME2) salt bridge and an asn367 (TME1)\u2013Asp728 (TM the oligomeric state of HCV virion-associated envelope glycoproteins often takes part. a main determinant for this trimerization is present in a specific GxxxG motif located within the E1 transmembrane domain. the fact that E1 trimers in HCVcc particles have not been detected before the present study is most likely due to the classical 95\u00b0C thermal treatment of SDS-PAGE protein samples. the GxxxG motif is a well-known dimerization motif for transmembrane helix-helix association (44\u201346) the three x amino acids between the glycine residues in a helical structure align the two glycines on the same face of the helix. the small glycine side chain exposes polar backbone atoms, leading to favorable interactions (47), especially in the hydrophobic membrane environment. a recombinant ectodomain of HCV E1 protein is oligomeric in solution. structural determinants for its trimerization are present in its ectodomain, in addition to that identified in its TM domain and in addition to the presence of E2. however, only limited structural investigations have been reported. oligomers including two TME1 molecules and one TME2 molecule were even observed in this study. oligomers including two TME1 molecules and one TME2 molecule were even observed in the absence of TME2. oligomers including two TME1 molecules and one TME2 molecule were even observed in this study. a tentative model of E1E2 heterodimers at the membrane surface of the viral particle has been proposed. this model is compatible with all available structural data, but remains a working model. it will be useful for the design of new structural and functional studies to clarify the structural organization of E1E2 at the virion surface and its role in virus entry. peptides spanning this region have been shown to induce the fusion and disruption of liposomes (63). trimerization is a characteristic feature of viral envelope glycoproteins involved in membrane fusion. postfusion structures of class I, II, and III proteins also form trimers. a major difference from other viral envelope glycoproteins is the central role played by a TM domain in the homo-oligomerization of the putative fusion protein. a major difference from other viral envelope glycoproteins is the central role played by a TM domain in the homo-oligomerization of the putative fusion protein. this work demonstrates that the E1 protein is trimeric on HCVcc particles. it indicates that the E1 and E2 glycoproteins most likely assemble as stable trimers of E1E2 heterodimers at the surface of the HCV virion."}
