{"summary": "the risk analysis is an important tool in epidemiology. it is essential to assess the risk of introduction and possible spread of diseases in areas with little impact. the development of a conceptual model is necessary to analyze the risk. some vector-borne diseases are introduced to distant regions by the dispersion of vectors in the wind flow. a wind speed of between 10 and 40 km/h, with a temperature of between 12 and 35\u00b0C, the vector can be transported up to about 700 km (9) there are other diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, which can also be transmitted by the wind flow. animals transporting animals that have not been properly disinfected could be an important source of pathogens. the animals that are loaded after have a high probability of infection during transport (4, 5). the animals that are loaded after have a high probability of infection during transport. the identification of the routes of entry has been conceptually based on the possibility of occurrence, regardless of its likelihood and frequency. the identification of the routes of entry is conceptually based on the possibility of occurrence. humans.

MERS is a vector-borne disease transmitted by ticks (Amblyoma genus in most cases) the most likely entrance of the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the European Union is through infected people movement (travelers of immigrants) from countries of the Arabian Peninsula. the origin was a person coming from Saudi Arabia (14) the peste des petits ruminants represents a risk for Europe only by the movement of vehicles contaminated by previous trips. the situation of the disease in the countries of the study, which so far are not affected, should be checked periodically. the majority of information managed in this study is coming from official databases (PubMed, OIE 18, GDAS 25, EUROSTAT 22, FAOSTAT 21) the probability of entry of infectious diseases through animal and animal products trade is relatively low due to the shortage of commercial movements between these countries and the European Union. in the movement of live animals, Tunisia represents a greater risk of entry of bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease for the European Union, Bahrain of glanders and United Arab Emirates of foot and mouth disease. outbreaks of bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease have been notified in the last 2 years. there is a high risk of introduction of bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease in the. European Union through dispersion of particles in wind currents from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia,. and a moderate risk of introduction of foot and mouth disease through this pathway. in the movement of live animals, Tunisia represents a greater risk of entry of highly pathogenic avian influenza. there is a lower risk of entry of highly pathogenic avian influenza through the movement of live birds from Egypt and Saudi Arabia. there is a lower risk of entry of highly pathogenic avian influenza. outbreaks of bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease have been notified in the last 2 years (2017 and 2018) in the last 2 years (2017 and 2018) outbreaks of bluetongue have been notified in Greece, Italy, and Switzerland. there is no risk of entry of the disease through this pathway. there is not enough information for certain emerging diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome. this study can be updated as the research on the different diseases transmission routes progresses. there are countries without information available, for lack of declaration on current health situation or underreporting of diseases outbreaks. way of entry of the Middle East respiratory syndrome is through infected people movement, from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. the contagious bovine pleuropneumonia is the only disease with no risk of introduction in the European Union. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
