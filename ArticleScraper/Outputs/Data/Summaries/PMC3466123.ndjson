{"summary": "Background Gastrointestinal symptoms are not an uncommon manifestation of an influenza virus infection. a simultaneous investigation of enteric and influenza viruses in patients complaining of gastrointestinal symptoms could be useful for future studies. GI symptoms developed during the clinical course of influenza have been recognised for more than 30 years. fecal excretion of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses has rarely been studied. fecal excretion of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses has rarely been studied. there are no studies reporting the detection of influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting in general practice for acute diarrhea. the study aimed to investigate the presence of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients presenting exclusively GI symptoms. the proportion of concurrent infections by enteric and influenza viruses by using a case control design. underlying medical conditions Gastrointestinal symptoms Consistency of stool specimen Duration of fever episode(days) Supplementary medical examen Influenza virus Enteric virus M/24 2 January 2.8x104 None reported Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting Watery 3 3 6 None reported A/H3N2 Negative F/56 1 February 3.5x106 Hypertension, osteoporosis, polymyalgia rheumatica Abdominal pain, nausea Watery 1 None reported No fever None the enrolment diarrhea episode, proportion of patients presenting fever, and the median duration of fever after enrolment for 5 groups of patients. the ones who tested positive for both enteric and influenza viruses (n = 5), the ones who were positive only for influenza (n = 87) and finally the ones who were negative for both enteric and influenza viruses (n = 41) patients with the detection of at least one enteric viruses (n = 87) seem to have a duration of fever after enrolment which is lower than those who were positive for influenza, with or without co-detection of an enteric virus (n = 10) this significant difference holds true when we compare the same first group (n = 87) and the group of patients who tested positive for both enteric and influenza viruses (n = 5) none of the 10 influenza-positive patients reported any respiratory symptoms. the proportion of women in the cases group was 45.9% versus 47.3% in the control group (p = 0.85). 92 (66.7%) were positive for at least one of the four enteric viruses analysed. five influenza-positive patients (3.6%) showed a co-detection of one enteric virus. fibrescope B Astrovirus F/79 0 December 2.5x104 Hypertension, osteoporosis Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting Watery 1 1 1 None reported B Negative M/22 7 January 3.2x104 None reported Abdominal pain, nausea Watery N/A None reported NA None reported B Norovirus GI F/19 3 February 4.0x104 None reported Abdominal pain, nausea Watery 1 None reported 0 None reported B Negative F/30 1 January 2.2x105 Migraine females (%) 2 (50.0%) 4 (80.0%) 6 (60.0%) 43 (49.4%) 18 (43.9%) Median duration of fever after enrolment. patients with the detection of at least one enteric viruses (n = 87) seem to have a fever after enrolment which is lower than those who were positive for influenza. two influenza-positive patients declared the duration of enrolment fever episode of six days. the first one was a 24 year old man without underlying conditions and with the duration of enrolment diarrhea episode of 3 days. the second one was a 54 year old woman without underlying conditions. influenza B virus (GI = 23%) has been reported in 81% (17/21) of influenza positive stools of pediatric patients (6 years of age) with concurrent respiratory and GI symptoms. in this study we have also reported the detection of A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 2009 viral RNA in the stools of two patients with AD between the ages of 5 weeks and 9 months. co-infections between rotavirus and influenza viruses have been reported in 2.2% of hospitalised young children with gastroenteritis. one case of co-infection with influenza A/H3N2 virus and norovirus has been reported in an elderly patient who developed diarrhea since day 3. a recent study on adult hospitalised patients showed that a direct intestinal infection by seasonal influenza A viruses seems an unlikely explanation for the fecal detection of viral RNA in the patients reported [11] alternative explanations of influenza virus detection could be the swallowing of virus-containing nasopharyngeal secretion or extrapulmonary virus dissemination via hematogeneous circulation. a simultaneous investigation of enteric and influenza viruses of patients complaining of GI symptoms could be useful for future studies. a case\u2013control study was conducted from December 2010 to April 2011. GPs from the french Sentinel Network collected stools from adult patients (18 year old) consulting for AD. enrolment to indicate the duration of symptoms (for cases) and to ascertain whether an AD had occurred or not (for controls) the hospital Ethic's Committee approved the study. oral consent was obtained from the patients at the time of inclusion. the efficacy of nucleic acid extraction was measured by real-time PCR amplification of the human GAPDH gene. influenza viruses A and B were detected by using two real-time RT-PCRs [31,33] the copy number of influenza A and B viral RNA was determined against serial dilution of external plasmid standards. sixty-three GPs from the French Sentinel Network collected stools from adult patients (18 year old) consulting for AD. the study was approved by the Hospital Ethic's Committee (CHU Saint-Antoine, France) stool specimens were tested for influenza virus A (A/H1N1 2009 and A/H3N2) and Influenza B and for four enteric viral pathogens (astrovirus, group A rotavirus, human enteric adenovirus, and norovirus of genogroup I - NoVGI - and genogroup II - NoVGII) a recent study showed that the Seeplex\u00ae Diarrhea-V assay is sensitive, specific, convenient and reliable for the simultaneous detection of several viral pathogens. Statistical analysis Continuous variables were described by median [interquartile range] and dichotomous data were described by proportions. AF, LV and KB designed microbiology experiments. AF performed, analyzed and interpreted microbiology data."}
