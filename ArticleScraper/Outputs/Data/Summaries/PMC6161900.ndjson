{"summary": "chronic HCV infection is a major biomedical problem as it causes liver inflammation and fibrosis, which can lead to severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. there is no vaccine against HCV and a number of newly acquired infections still occur associated with risk behavior or with unknown origin. chronic HCV patients display high rates of liver steatosis. host immune response remains a major component in HCV pathogenesis. direct interference of HCV infection with hepatocyte lipid metabolism may contribute to overall disease progression. lipins are key players in glycerophospholipid metabolism, as they catalyze phosphate removal from phosphatidic acid (PA) to produce diacylglycerol (DAG), but also a precursor for PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis in mammalian cells. lipin1 deletion in the liver of fld mice results in accumulation of lipin2 protein, a second member of the family predominantly expressed in the liver. lipin1 is emerging as a key player in ethanol-induced steatosis. a single nucleotide polymorphism in LPIN1 is associated with the severity of liver damage and fibrosis progression in pediatric human patients with histological non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) LPIN1 mRNA induction was prevented when infected cells were treated with 1M sofosbuvir (Fig 1C), an HCV RNA polymerase inhibitor [43] that reduced viral RNA accumulation by more than two orders of magnitude. LPIN1 mRNA induction was compared with mock-infected cells. LPIN1 mRNA has been shown to be upregulated by mechanisms that involve induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) treatment of the cells with ROS-scavenger molecule N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is capable of preventing LPIN1 mRNA induction under glucose deprivation [44] or during H2O2 treatment [45] lipin1 signal did not overlap with that of viral proteins NS3 and NS5A (S1C Fig). lipin1-deficient cells were generated by transducing human hepatoma (Huh-7) cells with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs targeting LPIN1 mRNA or a control vector expressing an irrelevant shRNA. Western-blot analysis using antibodies against lipin1 and lipin2 and actin as loading control. cellular lipin1 and lipin2 protein expression levels and a loading control (actin) were subjected to an MTT assay. 2C shows limited propagation of this virus in lipin1-deficient cells. results indicate that lipin1 is required for efficient HCV propagation. homeostatic lipin2 accumulation (Fig 2B) is not sufficient to support efficient HCV infection. identical lipin1-deficient and control Huh-7 cultures were inoculated at MOI 0.01 with a human alpha-coronavirus CoV-229E bearing a GFP reporter gene (hCoV-229E-GFP) these results suggest that lipin1 is not rate limiting for CoV-229E-GFP infection and that lipin1 expression is particularly limiting for HCV. lipin1 silencing interferes with early steps of HCV infection. panels A, B- Huh-7 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing control or LPIN1-specific shRNAs. at day 7 post-transduction, cells were infected at MOI 10 with HCV D183. persistently infected cultures were transduced with lentiviral vectors. infectivity titers in lipin1-deficient and control cells were comparable. lipin1 expression is not rate limiting for HCV RNA replication once infection has been established. lipin1-deficient cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing control or LPIN1-specific shRNAs. shLPIN1-1 and shLPIN1-2 target both isoforms, while shLPIN1-3 is specific for lipin1 isoform alpha and shLPIN-4 for isoform beta. lipin1 silencing resulted in a strong (85%) reduction in HCV infection. lipin1 silencing resulted in a milder (55%) but significant reduction in HCV infection efficiency. results indicate that both isoforms alpha and beta are limiting for HCV infection. lipin1-deficient cells (shLPIN1-1 and shLPIN1-2) were fully susceptible to HCVpp and VSVpp infection. comparable luciferase activity levels were found in all cell lines 48 hours post-inoculation. hypothesized lipin1 is not rate limiting for receptor binding, particle internalization or E1E2-mediated endosomal fusion. HCV RNA replication was evaluated by measuring accumulation of a reporter luciferase gene at 5 and 48 hours post-transfection of a replication competent HCV subgenomic replicon. luciferase accumulation at 5 hours also represents HCV IRES-driven primary translation of the input RNA. luciferase activity at 48 hours depends on effective HCV RNA replication. control and silenced cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing control or LPIN1-specific shRNAs. cells treated with hydroxyzine (5M) were used as positive inhibition control. cells were transfected with a replication-deficient mutant (B) or replication competent subgenomic HCV replicon bearing a luciferase gene. relative infection efficiency was calculated by determining extracellular infectivity titers 48 hours post-infection. wt lipin1 overexpression in lipin1-deficient cells consistently increased infectivity titers as compared to mock-transfected cells. overexpression in lipin1-deficient cells increased infectivity titers. lipin1 phosphatase (DXDXT) and transcriptional coactivation (LXXIL) mutants do not. this suggests lipin1 transcriptional co-activation capacity is not sufficient to support HCV infection while lipin1 phosphatase activity is essential. but we cannot determine if transcriptional co-activation by lipin1 is also required. ase activity in a step of HCV replication cycle between translation of the viral genome and formation of functional replicase complexes. we used a replication-independent surrogate model of polyprotein expression. this system is based on a vector encoding the portion of the viral polyprotein corresponding to the replicase (NS3-NS5B) under the transcriptional control of the T7 polymerase. Huh-7 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing control or LPIN1-specific shRNAs. samples were collected 16 hours post-infection for Western Blot, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and TEM. the same samples were analyzed by TEM to determine the presence/absence of vesicular structures (HCV vesicle-positive) in individual to determine the relative incidence of these structures in the different cell lines. the same samples were analyzed by TEM to determine the presence/absence of these structures in individual. lipin1-deficient cells were significantly less abundant 16 hours post-transfection. this reduced abundance is illustrated by a significant reduction in the fraction of cells displaying vesicular structures in lipin1-deficient cells. to validate the TEM results independently, we set out to establish a biochemical assay to evaluate replication-independent replicase complex formation. NS3 can be detected in DRM fractions (fractions 3\u20135), as determined by presence of SIGMAR1 in those fractions. most NS3 co-sediments together with solubilized proteins, as shown for actin. NS3 is reduced in DCTV-treated and lipin1-deficient cells. cells were lysed in vaccinia T7 and pTM-NS3/5B plasmid transfection at day 7 post-transfection. cells were lysed in TNE-0.1% Triton X114 and clear cell lysates were subjected to isopycnic ultracentrifugation in 10\u201340% sucrose gradients at 120, 000g during 16 hours at 4\u00b0C. fected cells were treated with 1M sofosbuvir, an HCV RNA polymerase inhibitor [43] that reduced viral RNA accumulation by more than two orders of magnitude. fected cells were infected at MOI 10 with HCV D183 virus and samples of control cells were collected 24 and 72 hours post-infection. LPIN1 mRNA induction was prevented by addition of antioxidants. despite comparable HCV RNA accumulation in mock-treated and NAC-treated HCV-infected cells. the observed transcriptional change leads to a correlative protein accumulation. lipin1-deficient cells were generated by transducing human hepatoma (Huh-7) cells with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs targeting LPIN1 mRNA or a control vector expressing an irrelevant shRNA. lipin1 expression silencing was verified by Western-Blot, typically 7 days post-transduction. data are shown as average and SD of six independent transduction experiments (n = 6). at day 3 post-transduction, cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing control or LPIN1-specific shRNAs. we performed low multiplicity infections (MOI 0.05) with genotype 1a TNcc virus strain in lipin1-deficient Huh-7.5 cell lines, which are susceptible to infection by this recombinant virus. in order to determine TNcc infection efficiency, intracellular RNA accumulation was determined 72 hours post-inoculation in control and lipin1-deficient Huh-7.5 cells. lipin1 is not rate limiting for CoV-229E-GFP infection. lipin1 expression is particularly limiting for HCV. lipin1 silencing interferes with early steps of HCV infection. infected cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing control, HCV RNA-targeting or LPIN1-specific shRNAs. at day 7 post-transduction, cells were split and samples of the cells and supernatants were collected 24 hours later. lipin1-deficient and control cells were comparable, with the exception of a marginal reduction in shLPIN1-2 expressing cells. lipin1 expression is not rate limiting for HCV RNA replication once infection has been established. lipin1 is only limiting at early steps of HCV infection leading to viral RNA accumulation. lipin1 isoform alpha and shLPIN-4 for isoform beta were verified at day 7 post-transduction and control cells were inoculated with HCVtcp. lipin1 silencing resulted in a strong (85%) reduction in HCV infection. lipin1 expression levels strongly correlate with HCVtcp infection efficiency. lipin1 silencing interferes with initial steps of HCV RNA replication Reduced HCV RNA accumulation in a single cycle infection as well as reduced HCVtcp infection. lipin1 silencing causes strong reduction in initial HCV RNA accumulation. we bypassed this step by transfecting a subgenomic replicon bearing a reporter luciferase gene into control and lipin1-deficient cells. luciferase activity measured at 5 hours post-transfection was not reduced in any of the cell lines. lipin1-deficient cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing control or LPIN1-specific shRNAs. lipin1-silencing interferes with early HCV RNA replication downstream of viral entry and primary translation. lipin1-silencing interferes with early HCV RNA replication. cells were transfected with a replication-deficient mutant (B) or replication competent subgenomic HCV replicon bearing a luciferase gene (C) Luciferase activity was determined in the different cell lines at 5 hours post-inoculation. cells were subsequently inoculated with HCV D183 at MOI 10. overexpression of wt lipin1 did not significantly alter susceptibility to HCV infection in control cells. wt lipin1 overexpression in lipin1-deficient cells consistently increased infectivity titers as compared to mock-transfected cells. in contrast to control cells, wt lipin1 overexpression in lipin1-deficient cells consistently increased infectivity titers. lipin1-deficient cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing control or LPIN1-specific shRNAs. at day 3 post-transduction, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wt, DXDXT or LXXIL lipin1beta cDNA. at day 3 post-transduction, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wt, DXDXT or L replication-independent surrogate model of polyprotein expression. system is based on a vector encoding the portion of the viral polyprotein corresponding to the replicase (NS3-NS5B) under the transcriptional control of the T7 polymerase and the translational control of EMCV IRES (pTM-NS3/5B) polyprotein expression efficiency was determined by Western-Blot. TEM showed comparable transfection efficiency and expression of NS3 and NS5A replicase subunits in control and lipin1-deficient cells. a mixture of characteristic double-membrane vesicles (DMV) and multiple membrane vesicles (MMV) were not found in mock-transfected cells. this size distribution is compatible with that observed similar replication-deficient systems. treatment of these cells with 100 nM daclatasvir resulted in a strong reduction in the number of vesicles per section area. replication-independent replicase complexes are located in detergent-resistant membranes. NS proteins are associated with replicase complexes that co-sediment with DRM markers such as caveolin-2 or sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1) in low-density fractions. lipin1-deficient cells display a consistent and statistically significant reduction in the DRM-associated, but not total NS3 abundance. lipin1-deficient cells display a consistent and statistically significant reduction in the DRM-associated, but not total NS3 abundance. lipin1-deficient cells display similar distribution pattern as the control cells. gradient fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western Blot to determine the distribution of NS3 in control and lipin1-deficient cells. data are expressed as the relative value as compared with control shRNA. RNA accumulation with NAC did not significantly interfere with HCV RNA replication. we favor the hypothesis that ROS induced by HCV protein accumulation actively participates in LPIN1 induction. treatment with the antioxidant NAC prevented LPIN1 mRNA accumulation. four different shRNAs targeting LPIN1 mRNA decrease susceptibility to HCV infection proportionally to their ability to reduce total lipin1 protein accumulation. these results, together with the cDNA rescue experiments, strongly reduce the possibility of observing RNAi-associated off-target phenomena. lipin1 and lipin2 play non-redundant functions in the liver. lipin2 is considered more as a constitutive phosphatidic acid phosphatase with lower specific activity than lipin1 [76]. in vitro PAP activity of purified lipin1 and lipin2 is differentially influenced by the composition of the substrates (liposomes and lipid-detergent micelles) this differential lipid substrate recognition may be reminiscent of the different preferential association with membranes of different subcellular compartments. lipin1 lacking phosphatase activity (DXDXT) or a mutant inactive as transcriptional coactivator (LXXIL) were not capable of enhancing HCV infection in lipin1-deficient cells compared with the wt lipin1. this function is not sufficient to support HCV replication. lipins are important enzymes in the main pathway for de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. membranous alterations and elevation of total phospholipid content observed in pah1-deficient yeast have been ascribed to transcriptional activation of pah1-independent alternative phospholipid biosynthetic programs due to PA accumulation. this may derive from the fact that yeast use mainly PA (lipin1 PAP substrate) as a precursor for PC biosynthesis, while mammals mainly use DAG (lipin1 PAP product) as precursor for PC biosynthesis through the Kennedy pathway. lipin1 deficiency may alter local levels of PA and DAG. both metabolites are potent chemical messengers that regulate different aspects of cellular homeostasis. lipin1 phosphatase activity is critical for transforming local pools of PA into DAG at the ER membrane. lipin1 regulates HCV replicase formation. some of the known lipin1 cellular functions may be compensated by other lipins, particularly lipin2 in the liver. some of the known lipin1 cellular functions may be compensated by other lipins. s Modified Eagle s Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (Gibco), 100U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco), 100M non-essential amino acids (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich) TNcc plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Jens Bukh (Huidovre Hospital; Copenhagen, Denmark) a lentiviral vector plasmid encoding lipin1-alpha cDNA was purchased from Genecopeia (Cat Nbr: EX-T7124-Lv153) silent mutations were also introduced in lipin1beta cDNA using NEB-Q5 mutagenesis kit. cells were inoculated with 2.5g/ml of puromycin to assess the lowest lentivirus dose capable of conferring puromycin resistance to 100% of the cell population. cell populations were subsequently cultured in the presence of puromycin until LPIN1 silencing was ascertained by Western-Blot. primary antibodies against lipin1 (clone B-12; Santa Cruz), lipin2 (H-160; Santa Cruz), NS3 (clone 2E3; Biofront), beta-actin (ab8226; Abcam) and tubulin (clone AA2; Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted in PBS-0.25% Tween20.
