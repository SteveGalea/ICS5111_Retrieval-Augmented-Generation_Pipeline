{"summary": "research proposes to build robust machine learning model to classify and screen compounds active against parasitic nematodes. results A set of compounds active against parasitic nematodes were collated from various literature sources including PubChem while the inactive set was derived from DrugBank database. the results were obtained using the radial basis function kernel. 2.9 billion people are infected with nematodes, according to a report by the world health organization (WHO) it is estimated that 2.9 billion people are infected with nematodes [1] therefore, to search for nematode specific targets is an active area under research. in table 1, we present the list of successful biochemical targets and corresponding drug classes known to be active against those targets. fenbendazole was 250 times and mebendazole was 400 times more potent inhibitors of colchicine binding to A. suum embryonic tubulin than to mammalian tubulin. but direct binding studies failed to find a significant change in benzimidazole affinity using mebendazole and intestinal A. suum tubulin. new class of synthetic anthelmintics, amino\u2013acetonitrile derivatives (AADs) are active against a variety of livestock pathogenic nematode species. authors have demonstrated that the mechanism of action of a novel anthelminthic drug, tribendimidine, approved recently in P.R. China. the developed model correctly classified 88.18% of the compounds in external test set. several compounds from Merck Index and Negwer\u2019s handbook were identified by the model as anthelmintic. ligand-based virtual screening (VS) has inherent advantage over traditional and even experimental high throughput screening (HTS) due to its massive parallel processing ability. ligand-based methods are popular because they are computationally inexpensive and easy to use. the assumption that structurally similar molecules exhibit similar biological activity is generally valid. ligand-based methods are increasingly playing an important role at the beginning of the drug discovery projects. silico classification model using SVM to predict potential anthelmintic leads targeted towards parasitic nematodes. we have applied this model to a large public database to predict novel anthelmintic compounds and identified a set of 45 compounds. the authors surmised that a unique group of nematode specific nAChR protein from acr-23 gene is responsible for AAD efficacy. the developed model correctly classified 88.18% of the compounds in external test set. the model was then used for virtual screening and several compounds from Merck Index and Negwer\u2019s handbook were identified by the model as anthelmintic. ligand-based methods are popular because they are computationally inexpensive and easy to use. the assumption that structurally similar molecules exhibit similar biological activity is generally valid. ligand-based methods are increasingly playing an important role at the beginning of the drug discovery projects especially where little 3D information is available for the receptor. our model has an estimated accuracy of 82.0% for the test dataset. we have applied this model to a large public database to predict novel anthelmintic compounds. we have identified a set of 45 compounds, of which six are promising as potential therapeutic agents. the database contains over 650,000 compounds with calculated physicochemical properties (log P, molecular weight, Lipinski properties) the database holds over 650,000 compounds with calculated physicochemical properties (log P, molecular weight, Lipinski properties) and abstracted bioactivities. the scaffold is obtained by iteratively removing side chains and converting all the bonds to single bonds. Feature selection is the effective way to remove noisy or irrelevant descriptors and reduce the dimensionality of the feature space to avoid overfitting. the removal of correlated descriptors resulted in a set of 113 descriptors. we then performed the normality test and those descriptors that passed the normality test were retained while the others were rejected. the forward approach performs better than the backward elimination strategy. 333 MOE descriptors only 14 are used in this analysis. ASA+ Water accessible surface area of all atoms with positive partial charge. ASA_P Water accessible surface area of all polar 6. E_ele Electrostatic component of the potential energy. xi (i=1,2...N) of M real numbers (descriptors) is represented by a feature vector xi (i=1,2...N) of M real numbers (descriptors) with the label yi +1,-1. yi = -1 means inactive and yi = +1 means active. the optimal hyperplane is defined in such a way that margin of separation between positive x Rm: w.x +b 0 and two parameters viz., which determine the capacity of the RBF kernel and the regularization parameter, C are required for optimization of SVM classifiers. the optimized parameters were C = 1.4 and = 0.43. model validation The prediction accuracy of the models developed was tested using ten-fold cross-validation technique. our primary dataset contains 295 unique compounds (148 actives and 147 inactives) the library of active molecules (compounds active against parasitic nematodes) was carefully collated from PubChem [29] and other literature sources [30-33] for inactive compounds. the database holds over 650,000 compounds with calculated physicochemical properties (log P, molecular weight, Lipinski properties) and abstracted bioactivities (binding constant, pharmacology and ADMET data) the database holds over 650,000 compounds with calculated physicochemical properties (log P, molecular weight, Lipinski properties) the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software was used for descriptor calculation. it calculates 333 descriptors, which are classified as one-dimensional (physicochemical properties), two-dimensional (topological) and three-dimensional (volume and surface area) descriptors. this resulted in the removal of 81 descriptors. we used the stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) [43] using a free data mining tool. this reduced our previous set of 113 descriptors to 34 descriptors. the forward approach performs better than the backward elimination strategy. ASA+ Water accessible surface area of all atoms with negative partial charge. ASA_P Water accessible surface area of all polar 6. E_ele Electrostatic component of the potential energy. the optimal hyperplane is defined in such a way that margin of separation between positive x Rm: w.x +b 0 and negative x Rm: w.x +b 0 examples is maximized with minimal error. the optimal hyperplane passes through the \u201cmidpoint\u201d between these sets. model validation The prediction accuracy of the models developed was tested using ten-fold cross-validation technique. the dataset was split into ten subsets of equal proportions. one subset was used as the test set while the rest were used for training the classifier. study was to classify and predict novel compounds active against parasitic nematodes. the various molecular descriptors (333 in total) were calculated initially, using MOE [42]. after removing insignificant attributes (standard deviation 0.3) we were able to reduce the total number of attributes to 113. the SVM model obtained an accuracy of 81.79% for the test set. structural similarity of many false positives to the compounds in the active set is quite high. we also note that a few false negatives are at the borderline. in Figure 4, we report the top ten molecular scaffolds in both the datasets. over 70.0% of the active compounds are represented by the top 10 scaffolds. only 51.1% of the inactive compounds are represented by the same number of scaffolds. pound 3 with antiviral activity, compound 10 with antimicrobial activity against Ancylostoma ceylanicum (a nematode), compound 12 with antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, compound 26 with activity to inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL protease enzyme. nematodes nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and tubulin -1 chain receptor are successful targets in rats or humans.
