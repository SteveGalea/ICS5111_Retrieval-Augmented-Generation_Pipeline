{"summary": "this study was approved by the IACUC of the US Army Center for Environmental Health Research. the 2 contact beddings used in this study were corncob and -cellulose beddings. rats were screened by using the institution's health monitoring program. animal holding rooms were maintained at 69.8 0.1 \u00b0F (21.0 0.1 \u00b0C), 49.5% 4.4% humidity, and a 12:12-h light:dark cycle. for the duration of the study, enrichment was added only during cage changes, to minimize cage opening. the ammonia tubes have a range of 0 to 70 ppm or 5 to 600 ppm, depending on the scale used. the lower range was used until intracage ammonia exceeded 70 ppm. the tip of the tube was inserted approximately 3 inches into the cage. weighing the water bottle from each experimental cage on a digital scale (Solenhe) daily, for Tuesday through Friday (4 data points total) no water consumption data were taken for control cages. water bottles were handled carefully to avoid spillage. each cage housed 2 randomly distributed rats. rats were conscious and freely moving for the duration of the experiment. each cage contained 2 rats. 6 control cages, 3 with corncob bedding and 3 with -cellulose bedding were placed on each level of the rack. the cage types were put into the rack in alternating order so no 2 adjacent levels were the same. a small hole was drilled into the upper right hand corner of each cage. 100 ppm ammonia is highly irritating to humans and can cause adverse respiratory and pulmonary health effects. 130 ppm ammonia is highly irritating to humans and can cause adverse health effects. all 3 experimental -cellulose cages exceeded 100 ppm ammonia by day 11. the final corncob cage had its first measurable ammonia level (5 ppm) on day 17. no adverse signs were observed in any of the rats. water consumption in each experimental cage was measured over 1 wk (5 business days) by weighing the water bottles daily. daily water consumption was calculated and averaged for each bedding group. intracage ammonia levels were measured daily for each experimental and control cage in both the corncob and -cellulose groups. by day 8, all 3 experimental -cellulose cages had significantly higher levels of intracage ammonia than did the experimental corncob cages. intracage ammonia levels were measured once daily for 21 d. each cage contained 3 control cages (without animals) and 3 experimental cages. each cage contained 2 adult rats each. average -Cellulose 1 64 64 78 37 61 -Cellulose 4 59 72 85 65 70 -Cellulose 6 61 56 63 63 61 Corncob 2 59 61 67 66 63 Corncob 3 52 48 63 65 57 Corncob 5 54 50 58 53 54 Water consumption did not differ between the bedding groups. intracage ammonia was seen in an experimental -cellulose cage on days 8 and 9. the bedding type, amount, and cage airflow were the same as those for all other cages in the -cellulose group. this cage was housed in the same rack in the same room as the other cages. water consumption was measured in each experimental cage as an indirect way to assess amounts of urination in each group. urease-positive bacteria metabolize urea from the urine and feces of the animals. ammonia levels are proportional to the amounts of wet urine and urease-positive bacteria. studies have compared different bedding materials in both static and IVC cages. but we are unaware of any study that has compared the effect of -cellulose and corncob beddings on intracage ammonia levels in an IVC system for an extended time period."}
