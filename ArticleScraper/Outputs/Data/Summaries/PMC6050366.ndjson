{"summary": "the recent zika outbreak caused socio-economic costs of approximately US$7-18 billion in Latin America and the Caribbean from 2015 to 2017 (United Nations, 2017). a recent study estimated the socio-economic costs for symptomatic dengue cases (58.40 million) with US$8.9 billion in 141 countries in 2013. first intracellular models have been developed for bacteriophages. early models for human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) provided insights into pathogenesis, treatment strategies and drug resistance. the target cell-limited model includes three species: uninfected susceptible target cells (T), infected virus-producing cells (I), and the virus load (V) the target cell-limited model includes three species: uninfected susceptible target cells (T), infected virus-producing cells (I), and the virus load (V) infected cells (I) die at rate d, corresponding to a target cell half-life of t T 1 / 2 = ln ( 2 ) d. by the interaction of virus (V) with uninfected target cells (T), the target cells become infected cells (I) which in turn produce infectious virus (V) with production rate p. k, p = 0 describes no drug effect while k, p = 1 refers to the case of a 100% effective treatment\u2014a perfect drug. a successful drug therapy would clear the virus with tot > c while the infection becomes chronic when tot c. the relationship between a certain drug dose and the resulting response can be integrated into the target cell-limited model by the simple time-dependent pharmacodynamic equation ( t ) = m a x C ( t ) n E C 50 n + C ( t ) n, (3) where max describes the maximum of the drug effect, EC50 the drug concentration with 50% efficacy, and C(t) the drug concentration or dose applied. intracellular viral genome (R) is produced at constant rate and degraded at constant rate. the progeny virions are assembled and secreted at constant rate. the drug effects regard intracellular processes or the viral genome replication. infected but not yet virus producing cells (I1) become productively virus producing cells (I2) with average transition time 1 / 1 + F. effect of IFN (F) is secreted by I2 at constant rate s. cell-limited model by simple assumptions: d T d t = r D k T V, d I 1 d t = k T V I 1, d I 2 d t = I 1 I 2, d D d t = I 2 r D, d V d t = p 1 + p R I I R I 2 c V k T V h V R A I R, d R A I R, d R A I the target cell-limited model includes three species: uninfected susceptible target cells (T), infected virus-producing cells (I) and the virus load (V) the model is formulated by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) total number of virus particles N produced by one infected cell during its lifetime is calculated by p/. without a viral infection (I = 0 and V = 0), target cells are in equilibrium with /d. infection grows due to an increase in virus-producing infected cells. the overall drug efficacy tot may be calculated as tot = 1(1 k)(1 p), while the critical drug efficacy c is given by c = 1 - d c k p. a successful drug therapy would clear the virus with tot > c while the infection becomes chronic when tot c. the target cell-limited model can be further extended by more detailed intracellular processes of the viral life cycle. multi-scale models that take the age of infected cells into account allow a biologically more realistic representation of intracellular processes with age-dependent reaction rates. the drug effects regard intracellular processes or the viral genome replication: blocking viral RNA production and virion assembly/secretion s, as well as increasing viral RNA degradation for > 1. infected but not yet virus producing cells (I1) become productively virus producing cells (I2) with average transition time 1 / 1 + F. effect of IFN has been modeled by decreasing the transition rate and/or the virus production rate p and effectiveness and p. the RIIR expands at constant rate and dies at constant rate b. by clonal expansion, the RIIR is activated and neutralizes the virus with constant rate h. in this coupled model the dead cells D are replaced by new target cells at constant rate r. symptomatic phase is characterized by a gradual depletion in CD4+ T cells. it is correlated with a strong increase in the viral plasma concentration leading to AIDS. the third and final phase is characterized by a gradual depletion in CD4+ T cells. the viral load peaked at 106 HIV RNA copies per mL after 14 days. the subsequent viral decline was characterized by a virion half-life of 1.2 days (c = 0.6 day1) the patients responded well to the Ritonavir treatment with a continuous decline in plasma viral load. the model predicted lifetimes of 2.2 days for virus-producing infected cells and 0.3 days for virions. highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) does not stop viral production completely, but can achieve a suppression of the viral load in plasma below levels of detection (50 RNA copies per mL) the transmission of drug-resistant virus strains is increasing, resulting in increasing treatment failure rates. 0.8 days (in agreement with 0.7 days in Markowitz et al., 2003) has been identified as the main contributor to the slower decay in the second sub-phase (phase 1a) the half-life of unintegrated infected cells depended strongly on the provirus integration rate. a second biphasic decline within the second phase referring to two sources of viremia with persisting virus for more than 7 years. a model extended by the proliferation of latently infected CD4+ T cells without being activated (bystander proliferation) and explained the persistence of a latent reservoir. an early antiretroviral intervention is necessary to limit the size of the latent reservoir. infected patients have been identified who were able to control HIV infection (50 RNA copies per mL) after ART cessation, so-called post-treatment controllers. elite controllers are able to control and suppress plasma viral load (50 RNA copies per mL) naturally without ART. the authors suggested therapeutic vaccination to increase the strength of the CTL killing rate and latent reversing agents to decrease the size of the latent reservoir. the authors suggested therapeutic vaccination to increase the strength of the CTL killing rate and latent reversing agents to decrease the size of the latent reservoir. of people receiving ART increased from 770,000 to 18.2 million, with a projection of 30 million people on ART in 2020. the first weeks post infection, the acute phase, are characterized by an exponential increase in viral load accompanied by a rapid depletion of CD4+ T cells. within this second asymptomatic phase, the virus persists for years while CD4+ T cells continuously and slowly decline. it has been estimated that HIV is a rapidly replicating virus that produces 1010 virions per day. a rapid virus replication also requires strong viral clearance to maintain the equilibrium. antiretroviral therapy For more than 20 years, HIV-positive patients are treated with a combination of antiretroviral drugs. the target cell-limited model can be modified to include the effects of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (k) that block viral infectivity (k) and protease inhibitors (p) which reduce viral production. the effect of a protease inhibitor has been investigated within the first 7 days after the oral administration of Ritonavir. long-lived infected CD4+ T cells and latently infected lymphocytes become virus-producing cells upon activation as second sources of virus. authors identified long-lived infected cells with a half-life of 14.1 days. the continuous release of trapped virus as the main contributors for the second phase. altegravir inhibits integrase and hence prevents the strand transfer of proviral DNA into the host-cell genome. a loss in infected cells with integrated viral DNA and a half-life of 0.8 days has been identified as the main contributor to the slower decay in the second sub-phase. the decline of the short-lived cell population within the first phase can be separated by a loss of productively virus-producing cells with a half-life of 0.8 days in sub-phase 1a. long-lived cells showed a shorter viral integration rate (0.05 day1) compared to short-lived cells with a viral integration rate of 2.6 day1. a 10-fold inhibition of Rev increased the viral production. a 100-fold inhibition decreased the production of virions. however, incomplete inhibition might be compensated that might lead to unwanted effects. elite controllers control plasma viral load (50 RNA copies per mL) naturally without ART. infected patients are able to control and suppress plasma viral load (50 RNA copies per mL) without ART. Ke et al. (2015) have developed mathematical models of latency under Vorinostat therapy. they could show that Vorinostat transiently activates HIV transcription but does not reduce the reservoir itself. in 2015, HIV/AIDS disappeared from the list of the top 10 causes of deaths. the outcome of an acute infection and its correlation with HCV control is associated with a sustained CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response. the biphasic increase in plasma viral load has been characterized by a rapid viral rise followed by a slower increase, with viral doubling times in the two phases of 0.5 and 7.5 days. the virion half-life is 2.7 h (c = 6.2 day1) and the infected cell half-life is 1.7\u201370 days ( = 0.14 day1) before the initiation of therapy, the estimated virion production and clearance rates were 1012 virions per day. authors suggested that the third phase decline could be the result of an infected cell loss enhanced by immune-mediated clearance of Ribavirin. a combination of peg-IFN plus Ribavirin with the DAA Telaprevir increased the SVR to around 70%. the authors suggested a higher infected cell death as well as intracellular degradation of viral RNA as modes of action for Telaprevir. the viral clearance rate has been estimated as c = 22.3 day1, corresponding to an HCV half-life of 45 min. intracellular viral RNA had a half-life of on average 11 h. the strong antiviral effect of Daclatasvir has been observed only when efficiently blocking both, intracellular viral replication and assembly/secretion. patients treated with the nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor Mericitabine showed a slower initial viral decline (phase 1) compared to non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors. however, in 40% of the patients, a slow but monophasic viral decline has been observed within the 14 days of Mericitabine treatment. after 6 weeks of treatment, 100% of patients have shown viral loads 15 IU per mL and no detectable virions in 91% of patients. the model predicted therapy could be shortened in more than 80% of the patients, resulting in a reduced medication costs by 16\u201320%. dahari et al. developed a mathematical model investigating the single steps of intracellular RNA replication. the model has shown that HCV regulates the plus-strand to the minus-strand relation by a strand-specific affinity of HCV NS5B polymerase. authors have shown that the virus benefits from encapsulating its genome replication inside membranous replication sites. the authors estimated replicase complex half-lives of 3.5 h and 9.9 h for the slow replicating strain. the antiviral efficacy has been integrated by the effect of the NS5A inhibitor Elbasvir, the NS5B inhibitor Sofosbuvir, and Compound 23. in a mouse model, Mailly et al. (2015) have shown that the inhibition of Claudin1-mediated viral entry by monoclonal antibodies has shown highly effective in preventing HCV infection without the emergence of resistance. the model predicted the clearance of infected cells and the prevention of new infection. antiviral treatment Neumann (1998) integrated the effect of IFN- into the target cell-limited model by inhibiting the virus production rate (p) or the de novo infection rate (k). after initiation of IFN- therapy, plasma viral load declined in a similar biphasic manner as has been observed in HIV patients. dahari et al. (2007b) could reproduce this triphasic pattern only if the majority of hepatocytes were assumed infected. an uninfected hepatocyte proliferation rate higher than the rate of infected cell loss resulted in that almost balanced shoulder phase. authors suggested a higher infected cell death and intracellular degradation of viral RNA as modes of action for Telaprevir. a promising HCV NS5A inhibitor has been associated with a 3-log(10) reduction in viremia within the first 24 h. the model predicted a 99.0% effective blocking of viral RNA replication (a) and 99.8% effective inhibition of assembly/secretion (s) Rong et al. (2013) investigated the antiviral effect of the HCV protease inhibitor Danoprevir. they found that Danoprevir was more efficient in inhibiting viral RNA replication (97%) and enhancing viral RNA degradation than inhibiting assembly/secretion (57%). however, for the Danoprevir monotherapy the viral clearance rate has been estimated with c = 10.4 day1 corresponding to a virion half-live of 1.6 h. both drugs alone were highly effective and only minor more effective in combination, suggesting an antiviral combination therapy with DAAs of different families. clinical trials investigating the combination of Sofosbuvir with Ledipasvir (an HCV NS5A inhibitor) have proven highly effective and safe with a SVR >90%. a cellular factor modulating the RNA binding activity to HCV NS5B polymerase and thus regulating the HCV replication. this and other findings on host factors have proven how important a detailed understanding of the HCV life cycle is. benzine et al. have estimated the half-lives of the replicase complex in slowly and rapidly replicating HCV strains. the authors estimated replicase complex half-lives of 3.5 h for the fast replicating strain and 9.9 h for the slow replicating strain. the antiviral efficacy has been integrated by the effect of the NS5A inhibitor Elbasvir. pound 23 inhibits the formation of replicase complexes. the model predicted that by blocking viral assembly, the RNA is increasingly used for translation while that redirection was very low in fast replicating viral strains. the exact mode of action is still unknown for daclatasvir. neuraminidase inhibitors and M2 proton channel blockers are available against influenza. the most effective strategy against a seasonal influenza infection is the prevention by a vaccination, which has been proven to be safe and effective for more than 60 years. 1 cell infects 22 other epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. a second peak in viral load may be explained by a decreasing antiviral effect of IFN. IFN plays a major role in the inhibition of viral infection. peak decline could be explained by enhanced infected cell killing mediated by cytokines, natural killer cells, or other cells activated by IFN. authors assume this second peak is due to a loss of the antiviral effect leading to a recovery of target cells (Pawelek et al., 2012). the half-lives for infected cells have been estimated with 1.2 days and for free virions 4 h. the model predicted the contribution of CTLs in killing infected cells while mainly IgM cleared the viral load. the model of Cao et al. (2016) confirmed the relationship of a faster recovery with an increased level of effector CD8+ T cells. thus, the induction of CD8+ T cells might be a promising vaccination strategy instead of boosting the antibody response that might lead to antigenic mutations and constantly evolving new influenza strains. Kamal et al. (2015) studied the time course of influenza infection with and without Oseltamivir that had an effect on virion production rate by inhibiting the release of newly produced virions. they found that a sooner initiation of Oseltamivir treatment correlates with a decreased viral secretion duration. authors found the most promising antiviral strategy by interfering with viral transcription, replication, protein synthesis, nuclear export, and assembly/secretion. the target cell-limited model neglects the regeneration and death of target cells. the authors introduced two different infected cells: not yet virus producing infected cells. the eclipse phase model estimated biologically more reasonable parameters. IFN is detectable 24 h post infection reaching a maximum after 72\u201396 h. in turn, the IAV protein NS1 has been identified as an IFN antagonist that circumvent the IFN-mediated antiviral response and correlate with pathogenicity. predictions explained the rebound by persistent inflammation that correlated with disease severity. the AIR is mainly mediated by CTLs and antibodies which appear at day 5 after primary infection and at day 3 after reinfection, resulting in a faster memory cell-mediated secondary response. the vaccine efficacy is only 17\u201353% compared with 70\u201390% in young adults. Hernandez-Vargas et al. (2014) studied the impact of age on the immune response to the course of IAV infection. however, these experimental results and modeling predictions are valid for immune nave aged mice. the maximum drug efficacy for Amantadine is only 74%. this can be explained by a rapid development of drug resistance. canini et al. (2014) investigated the effect of Oseltamivir (a neuraminidase inhibitor) model combining viral life cycle with cell-to-cell transmission. authors found most promising antiviral strategy by interfering with viral transcription, replication, protein synthesis, nuclear export, and assembly/secretion. they also showed that some drugs could in fact increase the virus production. the viral replication rate has been estimated as 63 ffu/mL day1 cell1. EBOV is hence highly efficient with a virion half-live of 23 h (c = 1.05 day1). the target cell-limited model confirmed the viral growth seen in experimental data. cytokines recruited macrophages, hepatocytes, splenocytes, and endotheliocytes. a 2 log(10) higher plasma viral load is correlated with an extensive recruitment of potential target cells. a massive infection/hypersecretion of cytokines by active virus-producing replication cells is associated with the potential severity of the Ebola disease. there are four serotypes of DENV, causing flu-like illness occasionally associated with severe complications like hemorrhagic fever. a cleared dengue infection provides a serotype-specific lifelong immunization, while secondary infections with another serotype can result in severe dengue disease. a short life-span of infected cells with 0.3 days referring to additional immune-mediated clearance mechanisms. they developed a series of within-host dengue models integrating key players of the IIR and AIR. they were able to reproduce the viral dynamics in primary infection. best et al. (2017) developed a series of models with and without incorporation of the immune response and fitted those to plasma viral load data of nonhuman primates. the simple eclipse phase model estimated an eclipse phase of 4 h (already observed via modeling in Osuna et al., 2016) EBOV of the type Zaire has caused the largest outbreak to date in west africa. an untreated acute Ebola infection causes severe illness with a fatality rate of on average 50%. EBOV infection time is significantly slower than IAV infection time. the target cell-limited model confirmed the viral growth seen in experimental data, starting at day 3 post infection with a complete target cell depletion at day 6. the authors furthermore studied the antiviral effect in mice treated with Favipiravir, an antiviral drug that blocks the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in a broad spectrum of RNA viruses. antiviral intervention of i) an antibody-based therapy that affects the de novo infection (k), ii) a siRNA-based treatment that blocks viral production (p) and a nucleoside analog-based therapy (e.g., Favipiravir) have been evaluated in mono- and combination therapy. the authors then demonstrated that a critical inhibition rate of 80.5% in fatal cases and 58.5% in nonfatal cases is needed to prevent fatal outcomes of the Ebol Clapham et al. (2014) extended the target cell-limited model by a simple AIR. differences between primary and secondary infection could be explained by the variations in the immune response. a secondary infection, the immune response-related parameters have shown higher values. higher rate constants for infectivity (k; evidence for antibody-dependent enhancement) and infected cell death (; evidence for T cell response with increasing severity) were necessary to mimic viral dynamics of a secondary infection. Best et al. (2017) developed a series of models with and without incorporation of the immune response and fitted those to plasma viral load data of nonhuman primates. the target cell-limited model only extended by an eclipse phase that distinguishes between non-actively and actively virus-producing infected cells was the best-suited model to reproduce the data. interdisciplinary research combining experimental measurements and mathematical modeling helped to quantify key parameters of the viral life cycle. simple extensions of the model led to insights into the different patterns of viral decline during drug treatment and the evaluation of different treatment regimens. ize viral spread in tissue, within organs or in the whole human body. complex interplay between virus and immune system may be studied by agent-based models with relatively simple rules. author contributions All authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work."}
