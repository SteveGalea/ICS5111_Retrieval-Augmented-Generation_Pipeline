{"summary": "BCC is associated with exposure to radiation in various populations. exposure to UV rays is the most common cause of BCC onset in the general population. several regulatory factors involved in the chronological progression of BCC lesions also require further investigation. inhibition of serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) suppressed prostate cancer progression. phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway participates in the signal transduction in tumor cells (25,26). g/ml streptomycin, sodium pyruvate and L-glutamine were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded ethanol. tumor sections were incubated with antibodies for anti-SOX2 (1:1,000; ab92494; abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) tumor tissues were then incubated with a monoclonal horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody ( all the primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), and were as follows: SOX-2 forward, 5\u2032-CAGGAGTTGTCAAGGCAGAGA-3\u2032; -actin forward, 5\u2032-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTC-3\u2032. the results were expressed as a fold change relative to the normal controls. small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection BCC cells (4105 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Opti-MEM (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was added for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were transfected with psPAX2 and pMD2.G into BCC cells or siRNA-SOX2-transfected BCC cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) the treated cells were used to investigate the effect of gene depletion using western blot assays. h, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. they were stained with 0.1% crystal violet dye (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. immunofluorescence assay Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (32). clinical tissues A total of 12 (male/female, 6/6) BCC tissues and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected at the second hospital of Tianjin Medical University (Tianjin, China) the pathological diagnosis of the BCC patients (mean age, 48.6 years; range, 42.2\u201354.5) was performed according to the world health organisation criteria (27). tumor sections were incubated with specific primary antibodies for anti-SOX2. tumor sections were then incubated with a monoclonal horseradish peroxidase antibody. staining results were semi-quantitatively evaluated based on percentage of positive cells. PCR thermocycling conditions included 45 amplification cycles, of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, primer annealing at 66\u00b0C for 20 sec and primer extension at 72\u00b0C for 15 sec. the results were expressed as a fold change relative to the normal controls. small interfering RNA transfection BCC cells (4105 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Opti-MEM (invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was added for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. pSOX2, pSRPK1, siRNA-vector or siRNA-SOX2 vector were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured at 37\u00b0C for 14 days. cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) immunofluorescence assay was performed as previously described (32). Briefly, the siRNA-SOX2-transfected BCC cells were cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min. clinical tissues A total of 12 (male/female, 6/6) BCC tissues and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected at the second hospital of Tianjin Medical University (Tianjin, China) the pathological diagnosis of the BCC patients was performed according to the world health organisation criteria (27) none of the patients received chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other treatments prior to tumor resection. staining results were semi-quantitatively evaluated based on the percentage of positive staining cells (magnification, 400) total cellular RNA was extracted from the BCC and normal cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Sciences, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) conditions included 45 amplification cycles, of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, primer annealing at 66\u00b0C for 20 sec and primer extension at 72\u00b0C for 15 sec. results were expressed as a fold change relative to normal controls by comparing levels of target mRNA expression to that of the -actin control group. the siRNA sequences corresponding to each gene were designed and synthesized by GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) a total of 100 pmol siRNA was transfected into cultured BCC cells, respectively, using 5 l Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent. cell colonies were counted using Image-Pro Plus version 5.0 software. cells were transfected with pSOX2, pSRPK1, siRNA-SOX2 or siRNA-SRPK1. DMEM in the lower chamber was supplemented with 10% FBS. the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. the cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. expression levels of SOX2 were upregulated in BCC tissue compared with normal tissue. expression was higher in BCC tissue samples when compared with normal basal cells. expression levels of SOX2 were upregulated in BCC cell lines. targeting SOX2 resulted in downregulated SOX2 expression in BCC cells. siRNA-SOX2 transfection promoted the (E) migration and (F) invasion of BCC cells. SOX2 knockdown upregulated expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin. increased levels of mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Fibronectin in BCC cells. effect of siRNA-SOX2 and (F) pSOX2 transfection on expression levels. SRPK1 knockdown inhibited SRPK1 expression, while SRPK1 overexpression promoted SRPK1 expression in BCC cells. SRPK1 knockdown canceled the SOX2 knockdown-inhibited (E) migration and (F) invasion of BCC cells. expression levels of PI3K and AKT in BCC cells, whereas SRPK1 overexpression increased these levels. however, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by MK2206 abrogated the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on BCC cell invasion through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. expression of SOX2 was upregulated in BCC tissue compared with normal tissue. expression levels were also upregulated in BCC cell lines as compared with normal basal cells. expression was higher in BCC tissue samples when compared with normal cells. siRNA-SOX2 transfection promoted the (E) migration and (F) invasion of BCC cells. p-SOX2 transfection promoted the (E) migration and (F) invasion of BCC cells. SOX2 knockdown upregulated expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin. increased levels of mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Fibronectin in BCC cells. effect of (E) siRNA-SOX2 and (F) pSOX2 transfection on expression levels. SRPK1 overexpression canceled the SOX2 knockdown-inhibited EMT processes of BCC cells. these data suggest that SRPK1 is a direct target of SOX2-induced EMT processes in BCC cells. SRPK1 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells. SRPK1 knockdown markedly decreased expression levels of PI3K and AKT in BCC cells, whereas SRPK1 overexpression increased these levels. however, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway abrogated the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on BCC cell invasion through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. expression levels of SOX2 were upregulated in BCC tissue compared with normal tissue. expression levels were also upregulated in BCC cell lines as compared with normal basal cells. expression was higher in BCC tissue samples when compared with normal cells. siRNA-SOX2 transfection promoted the (E) migration and (F) invasion of BCC cells. p-SOX2 transfection promoted the (E) migration and (F) invasion of BCC cells.

SRPK1 overexpression canceled the SOX2 knockdown-inhibited EMT processes of BCC cells. SRPK1 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells. SRPK1 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells. SRPK1 knockdown markedly decreased expression levels of PI3K and AKT in BCC cells, whereas SRPK1 overexpression increased these levels. however, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by MK2206 abrogated the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on BCC cell migration and invasion. in the present study, SOX2 expression in BCC tissues and cell lines was determined. more recently, SOX2 expression was reported to be associated with lymph node metastases and distant invasion in right-sided colon cancer. findings suggest that SOX2 also regulates tumorigenesis. SRPK1 knockdown further regulated the EMT process in BCC cells. reduced expression of SOX2 may lead to suppression of BCC metastasis.
