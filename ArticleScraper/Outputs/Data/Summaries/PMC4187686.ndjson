{"summary": "the Picornaviridae represent a large family of small plus-strand RNA viruses that cause a bewildering array of human and animal diseases. morphogenesis is the least-understood step in the life cycle of these viruses, and this process is difficult to study because encapsidation is tightly coupled to genome translation and RNA replication. picornaviruses are nonenveloped particles (27 to 30 nm in diameter) that consist of a capsid with icosahedral symmetry containing a tightly packaged, nonsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA. the X-ray structures of human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) (2) and poliovirus type 1 (3) were already published in 1985. diagram of structure of poliovirus with icosahedral symmetry (3, 219). the 5-fold, 3-fold, and 2-fold axes of symmetry are indicated. the capsid proteins VP1 (blue), VP2 (yellow) and VP3 (magenta) make up the outer surface of the particle, whereas VP4 is located internally. N-AgIII consists of amino acids 58 to 60 and 71 to 73 of VP3. N-AgIIIB contains amino acids 72 of VP2 and 76 to 79 of VP3. binding of antibodies to N-AgI leads to the neutralization of the virus. the genome has been organized by consensus into 1ABCD-2ABC-3ABCD units. the numbers indicate three functional domains and the letters identify proteins mapping to one of the three domains. members of some genera (e.g., Cardiovirus and Aphthovirus) also contain a \u201cleader protein\u201d (L) that is fused to the N terminus of the polyprotein. the single open reading frame is organized as 1ABCD-2ABC-3ABCD, with the numbers indicating the three different domains and each letter representing a protein. the P2 and P3 regions encode the nonstructural proteins associated with replication. the polyproteins of member viruses of a large number of picornavirus genera (Aphthovirus, Erbovirus, Kobuvirus, Cardiovirus, Teschovirus, Teschovirus, Sapelovirus, and Senecavirus newly made viral RNA can be used as either mRNA for translation, a template for replication, or a substrate of encapsidation into a protective coat. the mature virus exits the host cell either after cell lysis or by a not yet fully understood mechanism, possibly involving autophagosomes. morphogenesis is derived from studies with PV, a member of the C-cluster enteroviruses. the recent report that the encapsidation specificity of poliovirus is based on protein-protein interactions (2CATPase-capsid proteins) was a breakthrough in research on enterovirus morphogenesis (20, 21) we hope that the topics that we have selected for this review will provide the reader with an overview of the achievements and unsolved problems of picornavirus morphogenesis research. we hope that the topics that we have selected for this review will provide the reader with an overview of the achievements and unsolved problems. nonmyristoylated HAV P1-pX (green) is cleaved and processed by 3Cpro (VP0, VP3 and VP1-pX) the events following the formation of the preprovirion are extraordinarily different from those of other picornaviruses. 3CDpro cleavages capsid proteins into VP0, VP3 and VP1-pX. the proteins dissociate from Hsp90 after proteolytic cleavage. the capsid proteins dissociate from the chaperone, an observation. pX is finally cleaved off from VP1 by an unidentified proteinase. it occurs by autocatalytic cleavage that does not involve a proteinase. for cardioviruses, it is linked to a 2A polypeptide lacking enzymatic activity. both appendices are later removed from the P1 precursors by the corresponding viral 3Cpro proteinases (11). the temperature-sensitive (ts) growth phenotype of the PV type 3 Sabin vaccine strain is related to a defect at the nonpermissive temperature in the early assembly process. in the case of HAV, 5S particles are not observed in infected cells. the exact role of pentamers in the assembly of the mature virus particle is still controversial. studies with l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, also suggest that 14S pentamers are critical for the formation of mature virus particles. the 75S empty capsids, also known as procapsids, contain 12 pentamers but no viral RNA and sediment at 75S in sucrose gradients. early studies suggested the existence of two functional states of procapsids in PV-infected cells, the addition of 1 to 3 mM guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl) at midinfection caused the accumulation of procapsids, which could be chased into virus particles (57, 58). the provirion contains viral RNA in an \u201cimmature shell\u201d composed of VP0, VP1, and VP3 (58, 59) and sediments at 150S in sucrose gradients. the final step of morphogenesis is accomplished by the cleavage of VP0 into VP2 and VP4. this triggers a rearrangement of the capsid proteins and confers stability to the resulting icosahedral particle (3). mature poliovirus particles are resistant to SDS or EDTA treatment. an H195T or H195R mutation in PV VP2 resulted in the assembly of highly unstable 150S particles that contain uncleaved VP0 (70). a deletion of residues 8 and 9 in VP1 (mutant 101) affects RNA release, while a deletion of residues 1 to 4 in VP1 (mutant 102) leads to defects in both encapsidation and uncoating (71). virus maturation is enhanced by the viral protein 3CD in an in vitro translation/RNA replication system. poliovirus RNA can translatereplicateencapsidate in the cell-free environment of a cytoplasmic extract of HeLa cells. VP1 pockets found in a large number of picornavirions are occupied by a \u201cpocket factor\u201d of cellular origin. some enteroviruses (HRV14 and HRV3) and some cardioviruses (EMCV and mengovirus) do not appear to carry pocket factors altogether. poliovirions express major (N-AgIA, N-AgIIA, N-AgIIIA, and N-AgIIIB) and minor (N-AgIB and N-AgIIB) neutralization antigenic sites. poliovirus exists as three serotypes. no new serotypes have been discovered since the three serotypes were originally identified in 1951 (88) pX is retained as a component of eHAV until the eHAVs shed the membranes prior to fecal egress from a patient. pX is cleaved off from all VP1 proteins of the particle by an unknown cellular proteinase (19) p1 capsid precursor domain (P1) of poliovirus is separated by the proteinase 2Apro from the rest. 3CDpro cleavages capsid proteins into VP0, VP3 and VP1-pX. the proteins dissociate from Hsp90 after proteolytic cleavage. the capsid proteins dissociate from the chaperone, an observation. pX is finally cleaved off from VP1 by an unidentified proteinase. it occurs by autocatalytic cleavage that does not involve a proteinase. it occurs by autocatalytic cleavage that does not involve a proteinase. it occurs by autocatalytic cleavage that does not involve a proteinase. 3CDpro cleaves capsid proteins into VP0, VP3 and VP1. the proteins dissociate from Hsp90 after proteolytic cleavage. pX is finally cleaved by 3Cpro into VP0, VP3 and VP1-pX. aphthoviruses evolved a very unusual processing mechanism leading to the severance of P1 from the polyprotein (11) it occurs by autocatalytic cleavage that does not involve a proteinase. it occurs by autocatalytic cleavage that does not involve a proteinase. for cardioviruses, the resulting P1 capsid precursor is linked to a 2A polypeptide lacking enzymatic activity. the PV type 3 Sabin vaccine strain is related to a defect at the nonpermissive temperature in the early assembly process. in the case of HAV, 5S particles are not observed in infected cells. the exact role of pentamers in the assembly of the mature virus particle is still controversial. 75S empty capsids contain 12 pentamers but no viral RNA and sediment at 75S in sucrose gradients. they have been known for decades to be formed during poliovirus infection (52, 53) but are not present in cells infected with mengovirus, a species of Cardiovirus (49) early studies suggested existence of two functional states of procapsids in PV-infected cells, one active and one inactive (48, 54, 55) the provirion contains viral RNA in an \u201cimmature shell\u201d composed of VP0, VP1 and VP3 (58, 59) and sediments at 150S in sucrose gradients. the encapsidation of the viral RNA requires compact condensation of the RNA molecule and neutralization of the negatively charged phosphate groups by cations (61). cleavage of VP0 into VP2 and VP4 triggers rearrangement of capsid proteins. mature poliovirus particles are resistant to SDS or EDTA treatment. mature virus particles of aichi virus (65) and echovirus 22 (66) contain VP0 but no VP4. 195R mutation in PV VP2 resulted in the assembly of highly unstable 150S particles that contain uncleaved VP0 (70) there are several amino acids in the capsid proteins that appear to directly affect morphogenesis, uncoating, or both. a deletion of residues 8 and 9 in VP1 (mutant 101) affects both encapsidation and uncoating. poliovirus RNA inhibits cleavage of VP0 to VP2 and VP4. a mesa formed at the top of the 5-fold axis of the poliovirion is surrounded by a cleft. a large number of enteroviruses use structures other than this cleft to attach to the cell. VP1 pockets found in a large number of picornavirions are occupied by a \u201cpocket factor\u201d of cellular origin. some enteroviruses (HRV14 and HRV3) and some cardioviruses (EMCV and mengovirus) do not appear to carry pocket factors altogether. poliovirions express major (N-AgIA, N-AgIIA, N-AgIIIA, and N-AgIIB) and minor (N-AgIB and N-AgIIB) neutralization antigenic sites. poliovirus exists as three serotypes. no new serotypes have been discovered since the three serotypes were originally identified in 1951 (88) provirions envelop themselves into membranes and egress cells as enveloped particles called eHAV. pX is retained as a component of eHAV until the eHAVs shed the membranes prior to fecal egress from a patient. pX is cleaved off from all VP1 proteins of the particle by an unknown cellular proteinase (19) all Searches for RNA Packaging Signals in enteroviral genomes have failed. many studies aimed at identifying RNA-based encapsidation signals in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NTRs of enteroviral genomes have been unsuccessful. these searches generally included the construction of chimeric genomes in which segments were exchanged between genomes of different enteroviruses, followed by assaying for the nature of the progeny virus. a portion (of various lengths) of the P1 domain encoding the capsid proteins has been deleted (97, 98) the deletions in the P1 domain of DI particles must be in frame with the rest of the polyprotein. they concluded correctly that translation of the ORF of the polyprotein is required in cis for genome replication. enteroviruses other than PV could not be packaged in trans into capsids of bovine enterovirus, C-cluster coxsackievirus A21, B-cluster coxsackieviruses B3 and B4, rhinovirus 14 or enterovirus 70 (102, 103). a computational analysis of conserved RNA structural elements in genomes of PV and related C-CAVs identified an RNA element mapping to the coding region of PV 2CATPase, 34 mutations were introduced into the 2,642-nt P1 coding domain (112) the virus was revived when cre(2C) was rebuilt into the otherwise scrambled sequence. genetic analyses provided no evidence for cre as a packaging signal. encapsidation of enterovirus negative-strand RNAs has been observed in noncytopathogenic CVB3 that was isolated from persistently infected murine hearts. the RNA genomes of these viruses contain 5\u2032-terminal deletions in the cloverleaf, and when replicated, the amount of progeny minus strand present is much increased relative to the amount of plus strand. all Searches for RNA Packaging Signals in enteroviral genomes have failed. many studies aimed at identifying RNA-based encapsidation signals in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NTRs of enteroviral genomes have been unsuccessful. this includes the construction of chimeric genomes in which various segments were exchanged between genomes of different enteroviruses. a portion (of various lengths) of the P1 domain encoding the capsid proteins has been deleted (97, 98) the deletions in the P1 domain of DI particles must be in frame with the rest of the polyprotein, or else there is no PV genome replication and encapsidation. enteroviruses other than PV could not be packaged in trans into capsids of bovine enterovirus, C-cluster coxsackievirus A21, B-cluster coxsackieviruses B3 and B4, rhinovirus 14 or enterovirus 70 (102, 103). a computational analysis of conserved RNA structural elements in genomes of PV and related C-CAVs identified an RNA element mapping to the coding region of PV 2CATPase, mutations were introduced into the 2,642-nt P1 coding domain (112) the virus was revived when cre(2C) was rebuilt into the otherwise scrambled sequence (110). genetic analyses provided no evidence for cre as a packaging signal (113). encapsidation of minus-strand RNAs has been observed in noncytopathogenic CVB3 that was isolated from persistently infected murine hearts. the RNA genomes of these viruses contain 5\u2032-terminal deletions in the cloverleaf, and when replicated, the amount of progeny minus strand present is much increased relative to the amount of plus strand. this chimera expressed an adequate proliferation phenotype (96). the PV genome does not contain a packaging signal in the 5\u2032 NTR. a portion of the P1 domain encoding the capsid proteins has been deleted. replicons carrying foreign genes could be encapsidated in trans by coinfection with either a vaccinia virus expressing the poliovirus capsid proteins (104) or PV (105). the PV replicons could not be packaged in trans into capsids of bovine enterovirus, C-cluster coxsackievirus A21, B-cluster coxsackieviruses B3 and B4, rhinovirus 14, or enterovirus 70 (102, scrambled algorithm shuffled synonymous codons in different domains of the PV polyprotein. it introduced hundreds of silent mutations into the ORF without altering the amino acid sequence or codon usage. the virus was revived when cre(2C) in P2 was rebuilt into the otherwise scrambled sequence. the deletions in the P1 domain of DI particles must be in frame with the rest of the polyprotein, or else there is no PV genome replication and encapsidation. a number of investigators replaced part or all of the capsid coding sequence in P1 with foreign genes, thereby generating replicons suitable for studies of PV replication and encapsidation. RNA element mapping to the coding region of PV 2CATPase. cre(2C) plays an essential role in genome replication. equivalent cre elements have been found in the genomes of all picornaviruses. the 3\u2032 NTR is not required for PV replication and morphogenesis. the entire 3\u2032 NTR can be replaced with structurally very different 3\u2032 NTRs from HRV14 or B-cluster CBV4 without significant impairment of PV replication and encapsidation. encapsidation of minus-strand RNAs has also been observed in noncytopathogenic CVB3 that was isolated from persistently infected murine hearts. the RNA genomes of these viruses contain 5\u2032-terminal deletions in the cloverleaf. when replicated, the amount of progeny minus strand present is much increased relative to the amount of plus strand present. a positive identification of an encapsidation signal is possible only if modifying that signal has no detrimental effect on RNA translation or RNA replication. this observation and the lack of apparent RNA packaging signals in enterovirus genomes raised the possibility that the specificity of encapsidation of poliovirus is provided solely by an interaction between capsid and nonstructural proteins. 2CATPase has binding affinity for 3AB (133, 134) or 3Cpro (135) for enterovirus 71 infections, it has been reported that 2CATPase binds the host protein reticulon-3 (136), but this was not found in a yeast two-hybrid scan with poliovirus 2CATPase. luciferase activity produced in the absence of the drug is a measure of both translation and RNA replication of genomes. lysates of cells transfected in the absence of the drug are used to infect fresh HeLa cells. luciferase activity is produced during both transfection and infection after passage in new cells. the genome of the renilla luciferase (RLuc) reporter virus contains an RLuc gene fused to the N terminus of the PV polyprotein coding sequence. the virus can distinguish a defect in RNA replication (mutant R) from that in encapsidation (mutant E) in a two-step experiment. the recombinants evolved rapidly into viruses that were neurovirulent as the wt polioviruses targeted for eradication. all neurovirulent recombinants were found to have capsid domain P1 of PV and various parts of downstream domains P2 and P3 of C-CAV. we abbreviate the recombinants \u201cP-C-C,\u201d indicating the three-domain polyproteins. phenotype of C*-P-P or C-P*-P changed to a variant growing with wt kinetics and a large-plaque phenotype when both mutations were engineered into the chimeric genome. these results suggest a direct interaction between 2CATPase and the capsid protein VP3 which was subsequently proven by coimmunoprecipitation assays. the proteinase 3CDpro is the precursor of the RNA polymerase 3Dpol. it interacts with the 5\u2032 cloverleaf structure of the viral RNA. the best-known function of 3CDpro in encapsidation is the proteolytic processing of P1. 2A of hepatitis A virus expresses only one proteinase (3Cpro) for proteolytic cleavage. the 2A protein of HAV, also called pX, is a C-terminal extension of the structural protein VP1 and it lacks proteinase activity. pX is removed from VP1-pX by an unknown host proteinase. polypeptide encodes a 170-amino-acid-long L protein upstream of the capsid-encoding region. it exhibits no sequence similarity to the L proteins of other picornaviruses. a deletion of the C-terminal 50 amino acids of the L protein resulted in efficient RNA replication, but the virus yield was strongly reduced compared to that of the wt virus. 2CATPase has binding affinity for 3AB (133, 134) or 3Cpro (135) for enterovirus 71 infections, it has been reported that 2CATPase binds the host protein reticulon-3 (136), but this was not found in a yeast two-hybrid scan with poliovirus 2CATPase (C. Wang and E. Wimmer, unpublished data). luciferase activity produced in the absence of the drug is a measure of translation and RNA replication of genomes. lysates of cells transfected in the absence of the drug are used to infect fresh HeLa cells. this is because no intact infectious virus capable of infecting fresh cells upon passage is produced after transfection. the genome of the RLuc reporter virus contains an RLuc gene fused to the N terminus of the PV polyprotein coding sequence. in the first step, the reporter transcripts are transfected into HeLa cells in the absence of guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl), a potent inhibitor of RNA replication. luciferase activity produced in the absence of the drug is a measure of RNA replication. all neurovirulent recombinants were found to have capsid domain P1 of PV. we abbreviate the recombinants \u201cP-C-C,\u201d indicating the three-domain polyproteins from two different viruses. the recombinants were found to have capsid domain P1 of PV and various parts of downstream domains P2 and P3 of C-CAV. alanine scanning mutagenesis of 2CATPase yielded second-site suppressor mutations leading to new variants that could be grown and plaque titrated. 2CATPase and capsid proteins must communicate for morphogenesis to occur, most likely by direct binding. the proteinase 3Cpro is an important RNA-binding protein during RNA replication. it interacts with the 5\u2032 cloverleaf structure of the viral RNA. the best-known function of 3CDpro in encapsidation is proteolytic processing of P1. 3CD has affinity for the VPg-linked 5\u2032 end of the poliovirus genome. hepatitis A virus expresses only one proteinase (3Cpro) for proteolytic cleavage of its polyprotein. pX (2A) functions in both particle assembly, by promoting the formation of pentamers. the ichi virus genome encodes a 170-amino-acid-long L protein upstream of the capsid-encoding region. this polypeptide exhibits no sequence similarity to the L proteins of other picornaviruses. a deletion of the C-terminal 50 amino acids of the L protein resulted in efficient RNA replication, but the virus yield was strongly reduced compared to that of the wt virus. 3CDpro is for as-yet-unknown reasons exclusively responsible for the cleavage of the PV capsid precursor P1 into VP0, VP1 and VP3. another role for the 3CD polypeptide in encapsidation was discovered with studies of an in vitro translation/RNA replication system that produces viable poliovirus. pX is a C-terminal extension of the structural protein VP1. it lacks proteinase activity in both particle assembly and particle maturation. the pX protein is removed from VP1-pX by an unknown host proteinase. a basic residue at the C terminus of VP1 is required for efficient particle assembly. Hsp70 and Hsp90 Heat shock proteins are functionally related proteins. their expression levels are increased when cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or other stresses. the role of Hsp90 in FMDV morphogenesis is to stimulate the formation of pentamers from protomers rather than to promote P1 processing. l-Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) is a potent inhibitor of glutamylcysteine synthase. l-Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) is a potent inhibitor of glutamylcysteine synthase and of GSH biosynthesis. fected cells and that GSH directly interacts in vitro with capsid precursors and mature virus particles. in separate experiments, we have found that GSH protects mature virus from heat inactivation in vitro. a recent study suggested that blocking autophagosome formation reduced PV RNA replication, while vesicle acidification was required only for the final maturation cleavage of the virus particles. a recent study suggested that blocking of autophagosome formation reduced PV RNA replication, while vesicle acidification was required only for the final maturation cleavage of the virus particles (163, 164) tetradecanoic acid is a saturated fatty acid cotranslationally linked to the N terminus of the PV P1 precursor. VP0 myristoylation also appears to be important in late stages of PV assembly during virus maturation. l-Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) is a potent inhibitor of glutamylcysteine synthase. it inhibits the growth of enteroviruses at the stage of virus morphogenesis. but it has no effect on translation or genome replication. membrane-associated PV replication complexes synthesizing viral RNA contain 5S protomers and 14S pentamers (162) these subviral particles and each of the capsid proteins (VP0, VP1 and VP3) can be UV cross-linked to progeny viral RNA. methylhydantoin strongly inhibits enterovirus morphogenesis in tissue culture by aborting maturation at an 110S intermediate (132) the effect of hydantoin is reversible since the 110S particles can be chased into mature virions after removal of the drug. drug-resistant mutants evolved during passaging, suggesting that the role of GSH during enterovirus morphogenesis is to stabilize the pentamers and mature virus particles both during and after the viral assembly. Py-11 The nucleoside analogue Py-11 is a potent inhibitor of PV morphogenesis at the stage of cleavage of the capsid precursor P1. hydantoin strongly inhibits enterovirus morphogenesis in tissue culture. mutants resistant to geldanamycin inhibition were readily isolated. the effect of hydantoin is reversible since 110S particles can be chased into mature virions. GSH depletion by BSO treatment has no effect on protein translation or RNA replication of enteroviruses. the role of GSH during enterovirus morphogenesis is to stabilize pentamers and mature virus particles both during and after the viral assembly. the effect of geldanamycin is due to an inhibition of Hsp90-aided folding of its client, the viral capsid precursor P1. this folding, in turn, is essential for the processing of P1 by the proteinase 3CDpro. morphogenesis has been studied only with member viruses of three other families of enveloped human and animal plus-strand RNA viruses. Picornaviridae and Flaviviridae are similar in that there are interactions between capsid and nonstructural proteins that are important for morphogenesis (20, 168). we suggest that protein-protein interactions are sufficient to provide specificity to the encapsidation process (20) in Fig. 5, we propose a model of enterovirus morphogenesis based on our studies of enteroviruses. only newly replicated RNAs are encapsidated, which indicates a tight linkage between RNA replication and encapsidation. in fig. 5, we propose a model of morphogenesis based on our studies of enteroviruses. 2CATPase or between VP1 and 2CATPase is recruited to the replication complex. 12 pentamers condense around the RNA to produce a noninfectious provirion. the last step is the maturation cleavage of VP0, which is autocatalytic and RNA dependent. 12 pentamers are likely to condense around the RNA to produce a noninfectious provirion (PV stage VI) the last step is the maturation cleavage of VP0, which is autocatalytic and RNA dependent (67, 70, 170) and yields a stable particle containing VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4 (PV stage VII) the role of the procapsids (PV stage V) in morph the last full review on picornavirus morphogenesis was published in 1981. we have attempted to summarize older data collected decades ago. we have detailed new discoveries made during last few years (20\u201323, 26, 28, 141)"}
