{"summary": "two serotypes of BRAV have been identified, BRAV1 and BRBV, while BRBV consists of a single serotype. BRAV1 strain SD-1 was isolated in 1962 from nasal secretions from a calf with rhinitis. additional BRAV1 strains were subsequently isolated from both healthy and diseased bovines. both BRAV and BRBV are established but rarely studied etiologic agents of BRDC. experimental inoculation of calves with BRAV1 via intranasal (IN) or intratracheal routes resulted in variable clinical signs of respiratory disease and histologic lesions consistent with pneumonia. a BRDC PCR panel detected BVDV, BHV-1, BRSV and bovine coronavirus (BCV). a total of 204 samples were screened. samples were collected from twelve states. real time reverse transcription PCR was performed using Qiagen Quantitect RT-PCR with BRV primers and probe as follows: 50\u00b0C, 30 minutes; 95\u00b0C, 15 minutes; followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 60 seconds. primers identical to the known 20bp region of the random hexamer containing primer were purified using a Qiagen Minelute PCR spin column. samples were diluted to 0.2 ng/l and quantified using a Qubit fluorimeter (Life Technologies) primary embryonic bovine kidney (EBK) cells were cultured by treatment of finely minced kidneys with 0.25% trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours. BRBV (ATCCVR-1806) was first passage on EBKs before being expanded on MDBK cells. antiserum from a gnotobiotic calf hyperimmunized with BCV was used as a negative control (National Veterinary Services Laboratories catalog #320-BDV) plates were washed with PBS and fixed in 80% aqueous acetone. plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, then washed three times with PBS. 100 L of 50% glycerol in PBS was added to each well. a 5\u2019-nuclease reverse transcription PCR assay was designed to detect bovine rhinitis viruses targeting the 3D polymerase gene. probe, 5\u2019-FAM-CGG CAG TCC AGG TCC AGT GT-Iowa black-3. RNA was extracted using the MagMAX-96 viral RNA isolation kit. cDNA was purified using a Qiagen Minelute PCR spin column. amplified using primers identical to the known 20bp region of the random hexamer containing primer. reads from each sequencing library were parsed into individual folders based on barcoded sequences. the genomes for BRAV1 Sd-1, BRAV2 140032\u20131 and BRBV 140032\u20132 were submitted to GenBank under accessions KP236128, KP236129 and KP236130. the genomes for BRAV1 Sd-1, BRAV2 140032\u20131 and BRBV 140032\u20132 were submitted to GenBank under accessions KP236128, KP236129 and KP236130 antiserum from a gnotobiotic calf hyperimmunized with BCV was used as a negative control. non-infected cells were stained to determine level of background fluorescence. plates were washed with PBS and fixed in 80% acetone. a near complete BCV genome was assembled from 15,500 reads to yield a consensus sequence of 31,017 nucleotides (nt) with 99% identity to strain E-AH65. a near complete BCV genome was assembled from 15,500 reads to yield a consensus sequence of 31,017 nucleotides (nt) assembly using the BRBV reference genome identified 2,505 reads spanning the entire reference sequence with the exception of 48 and 13 nt at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019-termini. the consensus sequence was 87% identical to BRBV strain EC11 [1]. the 5\u2019 NTR contained three insertions (G334, C350, C527) and one deletion (A345) as compared to BRAV2 H-1. a polypyrimidine tract is present in BRAV1 from nt 514\u2013522 (UUUUCCUUU) followed by an AUG initiation codon at nt 538\u2013540. ERAV favors translation from the second initiation codon. VP1, VP2 and VP3 are the only surface-exposed viral proteins. the sequence divergence observed between VP1 and VP3 represents serotypic differences. region protein length and sequence identity (%) between BRAV1 strain Sd-1 and other bovine rhinitis viruses. a large ORF was identified from nt 488\u20137,219 encoding a predicted 2,243 amino acid polypeptide with 97% identity to BRAV2 H-1. the L protein initiated at nt 488 is predicted to encode 204 amino acids and has only 82.4 and 82.8% identity to BRAV1 and BRAV2 strain H-1. region protein length (aa) % Identity BRAV1 Sd-1 % Identity BRAV2 H-1 % Identity BRBV EC-11 % identity BRBV 140032\u20132 L 204 82.4 82.8 41.4 40.9 VP4 93 95.7 97.9 64.9 66.0 VP2 224 87.5 98.2 43.7 43.2 VP3 221 86.0 97.7 51.8 50.5 VP1 232 85.3 97 VP1 showed only 86.8% amino acid identity to EC-11. VP1 is exposed on the virion surface and at least three antigenic regions are targeted by neutralizing antibodies. BRAV2 140032\u20131 and BRBV 140032\u20132 formed well-defined clades with BRAV2 as an outlier closely related to BRAV2. phylogenetic analysis of 3D polymerase also found well-defined clades for BRBV and BRAV2 with BRAV1 as an outlier. thirty of 204 samples (6.4%) were positive for BRV with Ct values 18.0\u201329.4. nine samples were positive for BRV in addition to at least one other virus tested. four samples were only positive for BRV. reanalysis of raw data obtained for reference BRAV1 Sd-1 found contigs with BLASTN hits solely to BRAV1. similar analysis of metagenomic sequences from a BRV PCR-negative nasal swab failed to identify any contigs with E values >10\u20135 to BRV. bViruses identified by RT-PCR include BVDV, BCV, BRSV, BRV, BHV1 and IDV. cycle threshold values are in parentheses. bViruses detected by RT-PCR include BVDV, BCV, BRSV, BRV, BHV1 and IDV. BLASTN analysis of 21\u201322 identified bovine adenovirus 4 (BAdV4, E = 0.0) and BRSV (E = 8.5x10\u201355) Viruses identified by metagenomic sequencing were in good agreement for those included in the BRDC RT-PCR panel where Ct values were less than 30. inability for metagenomic sequencing to detect viruses with Ct values greater than 30 is likely due to insufficient sensitivity. 87.5% of herds and individuals had hemagglutination inhibition assay titers greater than 40. BRV are established etiological agents for BRDC, but little work has been published on these viruses. swabs were submitted to the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. a bovine respiratory disease PCR panel was also performed. the sample was filtered through a 0.2 micron syringe filter. reference genome mapped 5,924 reads spanning the entire reference sequence with the exception of a 16 nt gap approximately 150 nt from the 3\u2019-end of the polyprotein. the determined BRAV2 sequence was 89% identical to the BRAV2 strain H-1. the consensus sequence was 87% identical to BRBV strain EC11 [1]. the region of the 5\u2019 NTR sequenced encompasses 537 nt and is 89% identical to BRAV2 H-1. the 5\u2019 NTR contained three insertions (G334, C350, C527) and one deletion (A345) as compared to BRAV2 H-1. the non-structural proteins of BRAV1 were very similar to those of BRAV2 with over 90% identity. most divergent proteins were the capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 with 84.9\u201387.5% identity. VP1, VP2 and VP3 are the only surface-exposed viral proteins. 2 strain 140032\u20131 sequenced (487 nt) was 90% identical to BRAV2 strain H-1. a large ORF was identified from nt 488\u20137,219 encoding a predicted 2,243 amino acid polypeptide with 97% identity to BRAV2 H-1. the L protein initiated at nt 488 is predicted to encode 204 amino acids. the structural and non-structural proteins of 140032\u20131 all had >95% identity to BRAV2 H-1. region protein length and sequence identity (%) between BRAV2 strain 140032\u20132 and other bovine rhinitis viruses. initiation codons in frame with the polypeptide were identified near the 5\u2019-terminus (nt\u2019s 567\u2013569 and 639\u2013641) translation from the latter codon beginning at nt 639 is predicted to be more favorable as it is in context of a Kozak sequence. 4 58.9 95.7 Total 2280 50.1 49.9 50.0 94.6 Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the P1 protein encoding capsid proteins VP1\u20134, as well as the highly conserved 3D polymerase protein. analysis of P1 found well-defined clades for BRBV and BRAV2 with BRAV1 as an outlier closely related to BRAV2. a total of 204 samples (6.4%) were positive for BRV with Ct values 18.0\u201329.4. positive samples originated from Kansas (n = 12) and Nebraska (n = 1). Nine samples were positive for BRV. samples, 5\u201352, 6\u201319, 20\u201376 and 21\u201322, showed evidence of co-infection with two different BRV. reanalysis of raw data obtained for reference BRAV1 Sd-1 found contigs with BLASTN hits solely to BRAV1. similar analysis of metagenomic sequences from a BRV PCR-negative nasal swab failed to identify any contigs with E values >10\u20135 to BRV.

BRV are established etiological agents for BRDC, but little work has been published on these viruses. this first report of BRAV2 and BRBV in cattle and the occurrence of concurrent mixed BRV co-infections further expands our knowledge on the epidemiology of these viruses."}
