{"summary": "Croup affects about 3% of children per year, usually between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, and 75% of infections are caused by parainfluenza virus. symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours, but severe upper airway obstruction can, rarely, lead to respiratory failure and arrest. most important diagnoses to distinguish from croup include bacterial tracheitis, epiglottitis, and inhalation of a foreign body. children with acute laryngotracheitis have an antecedent upper respiratory tract infection, are usually febrile, have recurrent croup, and are thought to have more transient symptoms. about 85% of children attending general emergency departments with croup symptoms have mild croup, and less than 1% have severe croup. a westley Croup Score of 6\u201311 corresponds to a westley Croup Score of 6\u201311. five component items make up the score: colour (0 = normal, 1 = dusky, 2 = cyanotic in air, 3 = cyanotic in 30\u201340% oxygen) air entry (0 = normal, 1 = mildly diminished, 2 = moderately diminished, 3 = substantially diminished) westley Croup Score Total score ranging from 0\u201317 points. parainfluenza accounts for 75% of all cases, with the most common type being parainfluenza type 1. croup is caused by a variety of viral agents and, occasionally, by mycoplasma pneumoniae. study design criteria for inclusion included: published RCTs and systematic reviews of RCTs in the English language. study design criteria for inclusion in this review were: published RCTs and systematic reviews of RCTs in the English language. we use a regular surveillance protocol to capture harms alerts from organisations such as the FDA and the MHRA. to aid readability of the numerical data in our reviews, we round many percentages to the nearest whole number. readers should be aware of this when relating percentages to summary statistics such as relative risks (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for inclusion of children with mild croup 4 (228) Need for additional medical attention/admission to hospital Nebulised budesonide versus placebo 4 0 0 \u20132 +1 Moderate Directness points deducted for inclusion of children with mild croup and composite outcome (visits and admissions); effect size point added for RR 0.5 5 (215) Symptom severity Intramuscular or oral dexamethasone versus placebo 4 0 0 0 0 Moderate isolone 4 \u20131 \u20131 \u20131 0 Very low Quality point deducted for incomplete reporting of results; consistency point deducted for conflicting results; directness point deducted for inclusion of children with mild croup 1 (277) Need for additional medical attention/admission to hospital Higher-dose dexamethasone versus lower-dose dexamethasone 4 \u20131 0 0 0 Moderate Quality point deducted for sparse data 1 (129) Need for additional versus oral dexamethasone alone 4 0 \u20131 0 0 Moderate Consistency point deducted for significant heterogeneity between trials 3 (252) Need for additional medical attention/admission to hospital Oral dexamethasone plus nebulised budesonide versus oral dexamethasone alone 4 \u20131 0 0 Low Quality point deducted for incomplete reporting of results. directness point deducted for composite outcome (4 events in total in Symptom severity Heliox (helium-oxygen mixture) versus oxygen alone 4 \u20132 0 0 0 0 Moderate Quality point deducted for incomplete reporting of results. to achieve the final GRADE score for a given comparison, points are deducted or added from this initial score based on preset criteria relating to the categories of quality, directness, consistency, and effect size. systematic review included three RCTs comparing oral dexamethasone with placebo.
