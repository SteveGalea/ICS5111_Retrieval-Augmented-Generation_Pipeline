{"summary": "chronic rejection is the leading cause of death beyond the first year post lung transplantation. the hallmark histological findings of chronic rejection are obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), which is an inflammatory process affecting small noncartilagenous airways. early lesions of BOS demonstrate submucosal lymphocytic inflammation and disruption of the epithelium of small airways. early lesions of BOS demonstrate submucosal lymphocytic inflammation and disruption of the epithelium of small airways. early lesions of BOS demonstrate submucosal lymphocytic inflammation and disruption of the epithelium of small airways. the clinical diagnosis of BOS requires a sustained pulmonary decline with a reduced FEV1 for more than 3 weeks. acute allograft rejection is defined as perivascular or peribronchial mononuclear inflammation that may be associated with an acute reduction in pulmonary function. the current classification of BOS is based on changes in FEV1 with the maximum post-transplant FEV1 assigned a 100% predicted value. chronic rejection is classified pathologically as either chronic vascular rejection or chronic airway rejection. chronic airway rejection, the less common manifestation of rejection, involves the development of atherosclerosis in the pulmonary vasculature. a/Airway colonization Pneumonia and/or airway colonization with gram positive and gram negative pathogens as well as fungi are independent determinants of chronic allograft dysfunction. serology to Chlamydia pneumoniae in donors and recipients was associated with the development of BOS in lung transplant recipients. primary graft dysfunction Ischemia-reperfusion injury after lung transplantation or primary graft dysfunction was associated with the later development of BOS [41-43]. a multivariable model demonstrated that the increased risk for BOS with primary graft dysfunction was independent of acute rejection, lymphocytic bronchitis, and community-acquired respiratory viral infections. 16 patients had improved BOS scores after fundoplication. 13 of these patients no longer meeting criteria for BOS. acute rejection is well defined as a primary risk factor in the development of BOS. serology to Chlamydia pneumoniae in donors and recipients was associated with the development of BOS in lung transplant recipients. colonization of the lower airways with Aspergillus was also determined to be a potential causative role for the development of BOS. primary graft dysfunction Ischemia-reperfusion injury after lung transplantation or primary graft dysfunction was associated with the later development of BOS [41-43] a multivariable model demonstrated that the increased risk for BOS with primary graft dysfunction was independent of acute rejection, lymphocytic bronchitis, and community-acquired respiratory viral infections. 16 patients had improved BOS scores after fundoplication. 13 of these patients no longer meeting criteria for BOS. a small study showed early aggressive surgical treatment of GE reflux with fundoplication improved rates of BOS. novel or emerging therapies The use of other immunosuppressant therapies in novel ways may improve outcomes for BOS. a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aerosolized cyclosporine was performed with initiation of the drug within six weeks after lung transplant. 22 of the 24 responders improved after only 3 months of therapy. statin therapy Statins (3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are widely used lipid lowering agents. the effect of extracorporeal photopheresis on absolute FEV1 on the group of 12 patients was not significant and the therapy was tolerated. more recently, 60 lung transplant recipients experienced a reduction in the rate of decline associated with progressive BOS with extracorporeal photopheresis therapy. a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aerosolized cyclosporine was performed with initiation of the drug within six weeks after lung transplant. aerosolized cyclosporine did not improve the rate of acute rejection but improved survival and extended periods of chronic rejection-free survival [59] there are other therapies under investigation, including alemtuzumab, an anti-CD 52 antibody. statin therapy Statins (3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are widely used lipid lowering agents that have demonstrated immunomodulatory effects. the 6-year survival of lung transplant recipients was much greater than patients not on statin therapy. the effect of extracorporeal photopheresis on absolute FEV1 on the group of 12 patients was not significant and the therapy was tolerated. more recently, 60 lung transplant recipients experienced a reduction in the rate of decline associated with progressive BOS with extracorporeal photopheresis therapy. radiographic imaging remains supportive in the diagnostic evaluation and management of BOS. a 55 year-old patient underwent right single lung transplantation in 1992 for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency but suddenly developed a 25% reduction in FEV1 3 years after undergoing single left lung transplantation for BOS. the right allograft clearly had significant bronchiectasis due to long-standing BOS. in 1995, Novick et al reviewed the records of 72 patients who underwent retransplantation for BOS at 26 North American and European centers. in this cohort, the actuarial survival rates were 71% at 1 month, 43% at 1 year, and 35% at 2 years. for the 90-day postoperative survivors, 63% were alive 2 years after retransplantation. 45% (5-year) 73 Martinu et al 40 12 75% (1-year) 74 Strueber et al 42 37 78% (1-year) 62% (5-year) 75 Aigner et al 36 19
