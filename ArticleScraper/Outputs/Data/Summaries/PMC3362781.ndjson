{"summary": "we monitored patients admitted with respiratory infections (RI) in 9 Berlin hospitals from 7.12.2009 to 12.12.2010 according to different case definitions. we determined the proportion of cases with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1). 45% of hospitalized PCR-positive pH1N1-patients did not fulfil the SARI case-definition that included shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. broader, alternative case definitions should be considered to assess influenza-related disease burden in hospitals. a number of countries within the WHO European region have recently established SARI surveillance of different scope and profile. in germany, systems to estimate the burden of severe disease due to influenza were not well established during the 2009 influenza pandemic. in the winter of 2009/10 a hospital-based pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness study was launched. study period 1 was time with significant influenza circulation which lasted from December 7, 2009 to January 10, 2010, followed by study period 2 with low or absent circulation during the spring, summer, and autumn months of 2010. data collection The hospital information-system (ORBIS) of 9 community hospitals of the Vivantes Network for Health was screened daily for newly admitted patients. a study team comprised of 9 study nurses and additional 12 study assistants was assigned to these locations. CD4 was the narrowest case definition and was identical to the SARI case definition as suggested by ECDC and WHO in 2009. CD2 included only those CD1 patients who fulfilled the specified clinical criteria and excluded those CD1 patients based only on a suspected diagnosis of RI. patients received a nasal and throat swab (Mastaswab; MAST Diagnostica, Reinfeld, Germany) to obtain material for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at the Reference Centre for Influenza. the limit of detection (95% detection probability) was determined at 6 genome equivalents per reaction indicating a high sensitivity. study period We collected data for the period from December 7, 2009 to December 12, 2010. of all notified influenza cases in Berlin, 95% were reported before week 2 in 2010, which coincided with a decline of the german-wide consultation index of respiratory infections to background levels. the Vivantes hospital administration contributed weekly data on the aggregated numbers of all patients admitted to the hospital network. the study population was confined to patients aged 18 to 65 years. patients had to fulfil criteria of the broadest case definition (CD1) to be included as a case in the hospital-based surveillance of acute respiratory infections in 2009/10. all CD1 who did not meet the CD4 criteria were classified as CD1b. the smallest subsample of CD1 were cases fulfilling CD4 criteria (SARI as defined by ECDC/WHO) we calculated proportions of patients fulfilling the respective case definitions. we used the Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square test, respectively. the Breslow-Day test was used to assess homogeneity between strata. case fatality CD1 (n = 1,025) 61%* 49 y 51 y 12% 6% 6% 6 days 4% CD1b (n = 742) 62%* 50 y 51 y 11% 5% 4% 6 days 4% CD4 (n = 283) 57%* 45 y 50 y* 14% 7% 7% 7 days 2% pH1N1-positive (n = 20) there was no significant difference in age (p = 0.3) or gender distribution ( total and relative number of patients tested positive for pH1N1 by case definition and study period, hospital-based surveillance of acute respiratory infections, Berlin, 2009/10 No. tested for influenza (%) No. testing positive for influenza* (%) CD1 Period 1 60/110 (55%) 16 (29%) Period 2 294/915 (32%) 4 (1%) Total 354/1,025 (35%) 20 (6%) CD1b Period 1 32/71 (45%) 7 (25%) Period 2 174/671 (26%) the risk of ICU-admission (RR = 1.3, 95%CI: 0.95-1.93) and of requiring mechanical ventilation (RR = 1.3, 95%CI: 0.69-2.41) was similar for CD1b and CD4 cases. median duration of hospital stay was longer for CD4 than CD1b cases. median age of included RI-patients ranged from 45 to 56 years by study location. median age of included RI-patients ranged from 45 to 56 years by study location. all pH1N1 cases notified in Berlin through the national routine surveillance system, 2009-2010 are shown for comparison. all pH1N1 cases notified in Berlin through the national routine surveillance system, 2009-2010 are shown for comparison. the area under the ROC curve was largest for CD2 in study period 1 and for CD3 during the entire study period. ROC areas increased only minimally if a maximum swabbing interval of 4 instead of 7 days was applied to ascertain pH1N1 negatives. data based on cases of respiratory infections hospitalized in participating hospitals and tested for influenza, Berlin, December 2009 to December 2010. pH1N1 negative cases included only if period between symptom onset and nasopharyngeal swab 7 days. the remaining 742 cases were classified as CD1b. from calendar week 50/2009 to 14/2010, 291 ARI patients were identified in the 9 participating hospitals. 196 (54%) agreed to provide a nasopharyngeal swab. no significant difference in age (p = 0.3) or gender distribution (p = 0.2) between those tested or not. a higher proportion of both CD1 cases and pH1N1-positive patients was male. there was no statistically significant difference between age of men and women fulfilling the CD1 or the CD1b criteria (p = 0.7) the median age of CD4 patients was lower than that of CD1b patients (p = 0.05) the proportion of cases with missing patient outcome data did not differ by pH1N1-status, admission to ICU or CD4 versus CD1 (all p-values > 0.1) the likelihood of hospitalized RI-patients fulfilling criteria for the narrowest case definition was 1.3 times higher in study period 1 than period 2. median age of included RI-patients ranged from 45 to 56 years by study location (p 0.01) median age of included RI-patients ranged from 45 to 56 years by study location (p 0.01) median age of included RI-patients ranged from 45 to 56 years by study location (p 0.01). all pH1N1 cases notified in 2009-2010 are shown for comparison. maximum and minimum weekly incidence of respiratory infections as a proportion of internal medicine admissions and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions respectively. 57% 0.56 (0.45-0.68) 56% 59% 0.57 (0.42-0.73) CD2 95% 22% 0.59 (0.53-0.64) 100% 38% 0.69 (0.60-0.78) CD3 90% 35% 0.63 (0.55-0.70) 94% 41% 0.68 (0.57-0.79) Sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operator curve (ROC) a large proportion of pH1N1 positives was not captured by the SARI case definition as recommended by WHO and ECDC (CD4) the incidence of both CD1b and CD4-cases was subject to the influence of seasonality. the proportion of cases fulfilling the narrowest CD4 definition was highest during study period 1 (winter), a period with substantial influenza virus circulation, and significantly lower thereafter. the definition of CD4 captured only 55% of all hospitalized pH1N1-positive cases, and 75% of the pH1N1-cases requiring ICU management. however, this difference was not statistically significant in either study period. we compared sensitivity and specificity of different case definitions. a history of fever as an additional qualifying symptom added [16]. we were not able to assess the latter case definition as information on the presence of sore throat was not documented separately from cough in our study. however, our findings suggest that the broader case definitions offer advantages for surveillance of hospitalized influenza cases over the current SARI case definition. we cannot rule out misclassification from inability to obtain or document symptoms in the hospital information-system. clinical information on underlying disease was only available for patients included in the vaccine effectiveness study. but was not available for all patients in the SARI-surveillance. the pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/245/prepub Acknowledgements We thank following colleagues for providing valuable assistance."}
