CAM is believed to be safer and better than standard medical practice because they are \u201cnatural\u201d or are based on a strongly felt concept of \u201cwellness\u201d and health. CAM is believed to be safer and better than standard medical practice because they are based on a religious, philosophical or a strongly felt concept of CAM is often associated with the concomitant consumption of hepatotoxic ingredients such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or with hepatotoxicity of herbal ingredients themselves. botanical medicines have been used traditionally by herbalists worldwide for the prevention and treatment of liver disease. the use of CAM could be predicted by social, cultural, and geographic factors. the aim of this study is to describe the potential role, benefits, and limits of some of known widespread herbal products in chronic liver disease. metabolites formed in the small intestine and liver are the result of phase II metabolism by biotransformation enzymes. bacterial ring fission of the aglycon occurs in both small intestine and colon, resulting in the breakdown of the backbone structure of quercetin. quercetin downregulates ethanol-induced expression of glutathionine peroxidase 4 (GPX4). also downregulates the expression of Gadd45b at the presence of ethanol. also downregulates the expression of Gadd45b at the presence of ethanol. antioxidants significantly reduced the oxidative stress induced by ethanol intoxication, increased membrane integrity, and also increased organ regeneration [26]. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the united states. hepatic response to chronic noxious stimuli may lead to liver fibrosis and to preneoplastic cirrhotic liver. the involvement of members of the epidermal growth factor family in this process has been suggested. only five quercetin derivatives showed selective antiviral activity in HCV replicon cell-based assay. quercetin inhibits both NS3 and heat shock proteins (that are essential for HCV replication) luteolin-7-O-(6\u2032\u2032-O-coumaroyl)--D-glucopyranoside showed anti-HBV activity in vitro. luteolin-7-O-(6\u2032\u2032-O-coumaroyl)--D-glucopyranoside showed anti-HBV activity in vitro. quercetin glycosides become hydrolysed by intracellular -glucosidases. metabolites formed in the small intestine and liver are the result of phase II metabolism by biotransformation enzymes. bacterial ring fission occurs in both small intestine and colon. quercetin-ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction manifests by decreased membrane potential. enzymatic inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, ROS overgeneration, and lipid peroxidation in mitochondria. quercetin downregulates ethanol-induced expression of glutathionine peroxidase. antioxidants significantly reduced the oxidative stress induced by ethanol intoxication, increased membrane integrity, and also increased organ regeneration [26] nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the united states. onion peel extract (OPE), containing a high content of quercetin, may improve glucose response and insulin resistance associated with type-2 diabetes. hepatocytes from normal rats showed a decrease in de novo fatty acid and TAG synthesis induced by quercetin. phytochemicals exert antiviral activity in patients of derivates of 7-O-arylmethylquercetins. only five quercetin derivatives showed selective antiviral activity in HCV replicon cell-based assay. quercetin inhibits NS3 activity in a specific dose-dependent manner. apigenin-7-O--D-glucopyranoside (2), apigenin-7-O-(6\u2032\u2032-O-galloyl)--D-glucopyranoside (3), luteolin-7-O--D-glucopyranoside (7), luteolin-7-O-(6\u2032\u2032-O-trans-feruloyl)--D-glucopyranoside (8), and luteolin-7-O-(6\u2032\u2032-O clinical trials have shown that curcumin is safe even at high doses (12 g/day) in humans. low plasma and tissue levels of curcumin due to its poor oral bioavailability and absorption may be responsible for the unfavorable pharmacokinetic of curcumin. BDMC-A influences MMPs, TIMPs expression and acts as an efficient anti-fibrotic agent. curcumin exerts hepatoprotective properties against ethanol involving HO-1 induction. curcumin-attenuated inflammation and liver pathology in early stage of alcoholic liver disease. curcumin improved liver histopathology in early stage of ethanol-induced liver injury by reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. results showed a remarkable reduction in serum ALT (U/L), AST (U/L) in rats treated with curcumin derivatives. curcumin represses expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. curcumin inhibits extracellular matrix formation, downregulates expression of LDL receptors, induces SREBP-1c and increases fat-storing capacity of HSC. curcumin administration effectively limits the development and progression of fibrosis in mice with experimental steatohepatitis. curcumin is known to exert anti-viral activity against influenza virus, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, and the human immunodeficiency virus. curcumin and HCV exert profound inhibitory effects on HCV replication. curcumin and HBV Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects the liver and uses its cell host for gene expression and propagation. curcumin is a low-molecular-weight polyphenol derived from the rhizomes of turmeric (curcuma longa) it is safe even at high doses (12 g/day) in humans. low plasma and tissue levels of curcumin due to its poor oral bioavailability may be responsible for the unfavorable pharmacokinetic of curcumin. chronic alcohol abuse is one of the main causes of liver fibrosis. ingestion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) together with alcohol can aggravate the toxicity of alcohol. the degree of abnormal ECM degradation depends on the ratio of active matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups and treated with ethanol or curcumin via an intragastric tube for 4 weeks. treatment groups were fed with ethanol supplemented with curcumin (400 or 1 200 mg/kg bw) the liver histopathology in ethanol group revealed mild-to-moderate steatosis. curcumin induces apoptosis and blocks proliferation of hepatic stellate cells. curcumin inhibits extracellular matrix formation, downregulates the expression of LDL receptors, induces SREBP-1c, and increases the fat-storing capacity of HSC. curcumin administration effectively limits the development and progression of fibrosis in mice with experimental steatohepatitis. curcumin reduced serum insulin and leptin levels in fructose-fed rats. it protects against fructose-induced hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis. curcumin and HBV Hepatitis B virus exert profound inhibitory effects on HCV replication in vitro. curcumin treatment could complement the antiviral activity of the nucleotide/nucleoside analogues. curcumin inhibits HBV gene expression and replication by downregulating PGC-1alpha. silymarin possesses various pharmacological activities, including hepatoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardioprotective effects. silymarin is commonly prescribed in cases of cirrhosis or viral hepatitis. group A as control, group B as rats taking ethanol at a dose of 0.6 mL (0.5 gm)/100 gm/day. group C taking ethanol and silymarin at a dose of 0.5 gm/100 gm/day. hepatic microvesicular steatosis with mild necrosis and elevation of serum ALT activity. the treatment consisted of silybin/vitamin E/phospholipids. group A showed a significant reduction in ultrasonographic scores for liver steatosis. silymarin inhibits both HCV RNA (in a dose-dependent manner) and HCV core expression thanks to its direct effect against HCV 3a core or activation of JAK/STAT pathways. silymarin had inefficient activity on the genotype 1b. oxidative stress may play a pathogenetic role in chronic hepatitis C. a double-blind study was performed in HCV1 patients treated with pegylated interferon + ribavirin. in the silymarin group, a more rapid decrease in the malondialdehyde level and an increase in superoxide dismutase were found. silymarin possesses various pharmacological activities, including hepatoprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardioprotective effects. silymarin is commonly prescribed in cases of cirrhosis or viral hepatitis. ethanol administration caused prominent hepatic microvesicular steatosis with mild necrosis and an elevation of serum ALT activity. supplementation with a standardized silymarin with its antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties decreases TNF production and attenuated these adverse changes induced by acute ethanol administration. group A showed significant reduction in ultrasonographic scores for liver steatosis. silybin conjugated with vitamin E and phospholipids could be used as complementary approach in the treatment of patients with chronic liver damage. silymarin inhibits both HCV RNA (in a dose-dependent manner) and HCV core expression thanks to its direct effect against HCV 3a core. silymarin inhibited genotype 2a NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity at concentrations 5-10 times higher than required for anti-HCVcc effects. a double-blind study was performed in HCV1 patients treated with pegylated interferon + ribavirin in order to assess the efficacy of supplementation with the antioxidant flavonoid silymarin. in the silymarin group, a more rapid decrease in the malondialdehyde level as well as a marked decrease in superoxide dismutase and an increase in myeloperoxidase activity. betaine can transfer its methyl group to homocysteine in order to form methionine. this can result in decreased concentrations of homocysteine and increased concentrations of methionine in the liver. increased hepatic concentrations of SAM can trigger a cascade of events leading to formation of proper VLDL. increased hepatic concentrations of SAM can activate cystathionine-synthase. betaine feeding can decrease levels of serum ALT, AST, endotoxin, TNF-, IFN-, and IL-18, reduce the expression of TLR4 and improve the degree of hepatic steatosis. the role of betaine in the treatment of NASH has been evaluated in human studies. betaine reduces fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and hepatic fat in mice. betaine treatment reversed the inhibition of hepatic insulin signaling in mHF and in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. betaine supplementation alleviated hepatic pathological changes. hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and attenuated lipogenic capability in the liver. the cause of failure of antiviral treatment with standard therapy is unknown. the treatment of cells with S-adenosyl-L-methionine and betaine could restore STAT1 methylation. hyperhomocysteinemia is frequent in the Caucasian and its role in vascular pathology has been clearly established. in chronic hepatitis C, preliminary data have shown that hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for steatosis or even fibrosis. in vivo, betaine acts as a methyl donor for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. in the liver, betaine can transfer its methyl group to homocysteine in order to form methionine. this can result in decreased concentrations of homocysteine and increased concentrations of methionine in the liver. increased hepatic concentrations of SAM can activate cystathionine-synthase and lead to the function of the electron transport chain, to maintain the integrity of the liver, and to protect against the development of alcoholic liver injury. chronic alcohol administration increases gut-derived endotoxin in the portal circulation, activating Kupffer cells to produce several proinflammatory cytokines. ethanol administration can lead to the synthesis of TLR4 protein and its gene expression in Kupffer cells. betaine glucuronate reduced hepatic steatosis by 25% and hepatomegaly by 8%. a marked improvement in the degree of steatosis, necroinflammatory grade, and stage of fibrosis was obtained after treatment with betaine. betaine treatment would prevent or treat NAFLD in mice. betaine supplementation alleviated high-fat diet-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress response in adipose tissue. betaine significantly attenuated hepatic steatosis induced by high-sucrose diet. expression of HCV proteins leads to an impairment of Jak-STAT signaling. betaine and betaine potentiate IFN signaling in cultured cells expressing hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins and enhance the inhibitory effect of IFN on HCV replicons. addition of these drugs to antiviral standard therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C could overcome the problem of drug resistance. osyl Methionine restores the antiviral activity of interferon. treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia could have favorable consequences in steatohepatites and HCV infection. biliary-excreted GL and 3MGA hydrolyzed by intestinal bacteria into GA. orally administered GL is enzymatically hydrolyzed to GA by intestinal bacterial flora. the circulated GA is further metabolized to 3MGA in the liver. GL inhibits CD4+ T-cell and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) mediated cytotoxicity [93], activated NK cells and extrathymic T lymphocyte differentiation [94, 95], and promoted maturation of dendritic cells. GL inhibited serum AST and ALT levels and histologically inhibited the spread of degenerative areas of hepatocytes. a recent in vitro study found that GL inhibits HCV full-length viral particles and HCV core gene expression or function in a dose-dependent manner. a european randomized trial showed biochemical effects of 26-week treatment with SNMC in patients with chronic hepatitis C [102] glycyrrhizin-modified glycosylation and blocked sialylation of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) SNMC prevented hepatic steatosis in transgenic mice expressing the HCV polyprotein fed an excess iron diet. this product attenuated ultrastructural alterations of mitochondria of the liver. this product activated mitochondrial -oxidation with increased expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I. glycyrrhiza glabra is a perennial herb cultivated in temperate and subtropical regions of the world. it contains 0.2% glycyrrhizin, 0.1% cysteine, and 2% glycine in physiological solution. glycyrrhizin is available in a multiplicity of nonstandardized oral formulations found over the country. the biliary-excreted GL and 3MGA are hydrolyzed into GA by intestinal bacterial flora before absorption into the bloodstream. the circulated GA is further metabolized to 3MGA in the liver by UDP-glucuronyl transferase and then excreted with bile into the intestine. GL inhibits CD4+ T-cell and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) mediated cytotoxicity [93], activated NK cells and extrathymic T lymphocyte differentiation [94, 95], and promoted maturation of dendritic cells [92]. GL inhibited serum AST and ALT levels and histologically inhibited the spread of degenerative areas of hepatocytes. a recent in vitro study found that GL inhibited HCV full-length viral particles and HCV core gene expression or function in a dose-dependent manner. a european randomized trial showed biochemical effects of 26-week treatment with SNMC in patients with chronic hepatitis C. SNMC polyprotein attenuated ultrastructural alterations of mitochondria of the liver, activated mitochondrial -oxidation with increased expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I. 18-GL, the biologically active metabolite of GL, prevented FFA-induced lipid accumulation and cell apoptosis. phyllantus consist of about 6500 species in 300 genera, of which 200 are american, 100 africa, 70 from Madagascar, and the remaining are Asian and Australian. many species are used in traditional medicine mainly in India and China to treat several diseases. the administration of P. amarus extract significantly decreased the levels of collagen and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in rats with alcohol and thermally oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acid- (PUFA-) induced hepatic fibrosis [120]. in mice with aflatoxin B1-induced liver damage, P. amarus extract lowered down the content of TBARSs and enhanced the reduced glutathione level. Emblica officinalis (P. emblica) protect against ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity. animal studies showed that the fruit extract improved plasma enzymes level, reduced lipid peroxidation, and restored the antioxidants level in alcohol-induced liver disease. treatment with 1246TGG (6.25 g/mL, 3.13 g/mL), reduced both HBsAg and HBeAg levels in culture supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells. authors included a total of 16 randomized trials but only one compared Phyllanthus with placebo and found no significant difference in HBeAg seroconversion. water extract of P. urinaria induces apoptosis by DNA fragmentation and increased caspase-3 activity. reduces the viability of numerous cancer cells lines probably by telomerase suppression activity. morphological analysis of samples of Phyllanthus used in raw drug trade in southern India showed that 76% of the market samples contained P. amarus as the predominant species (>95%) and other five different species, including P. debilis, P. fraternus, P. urinaria, P. maderaspatensis and P. kozhikodianus, were found in the remaining 24% of the shops. a recent animal study found a synergistic effect between silymarin and P. amarus due to its higher concentration of phyllanthin in comparison to aqueous extract against CCl-induced nepatotoxicity. the antioxidant activity was found especially in P. simplex extracts because of its high phenolic content. the first had higher cytotoxicity, higher free radical scavenging activity, and more inhibition of peroxidation capacity. phyllanthin restored the antioxidant capability of rat hepatocytes. the extract was used in 1988 in a preliminary study involving 37 patients with chronic hepatitis B. 22 of 37 treated patients had cleared the virus 2-3 weeks after the end of the treatment period. trials compared Phyllanthus plus an antiviral drug with the same antiviral drug alone. the combined treatment affect serum HBV DNA, serum HBeAg, and HBeAg seroconversion. the authors conclude that Phyllanthus in combination with an antiviral drug may be better than the same antiviral drug alone. geraniin, elaeocarpusin, and prodelphinidins B1 and B2 possess antineoplastic effects. it also possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and immunomodulatory activities. in liver, P. emblica and P. urinaria inhibited HepG2 cell growth and five other cancer cell lines. pretreatment with low (2.6 mL/kg/day) and higher doses (5.2 mL/kg/day) reversed paracetamol-induced liver toxicity in mice [153, 154]. a double-blind, placebo-controlled study reported that cirrhotic patients treated for 6 months with Liv.52 had significantly better Child-Pugh score, decreased ascites, and decreased serum ALT and AST levels compared with placebo group [156]. the anticancer herbal drugs can be divided into three categories based on their target. the cellular and animal studies have provided strong molecular evidence for the anticancer activities. a clinical study of TCM treatment is more difficult and complicated than the study of single compound drugs. the effects, as well as the toxicity, of individual herbs or single compounds derived from the herb cannot completely reflect the benefits and toxicity of the herbal combination. more well-designed intensive clinical evaluations and translational laboratory studies are absolutely needed. quercetin inhibits the growth of hepatoma cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. a recent study showed quercetin treatment of hepatoma cells resulted in changes of cell cycle, reducing HCC progression. roscovitine in combination with quercetin can be considered a potential therapeutic target for treatment of HCC. phyllanthus Phyllantus Emblica exhibits anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antioxidant and anti-mutagenic effects. the active principles of extracts of P. emblica have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects in several cancer cell lines both in vivo and in vivo. curcumin induces cell cycle arrest by downregulating the protein expression on cdc2 and inhibits the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma J5 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. glycyrrhizin has been shown to successfully prevent primary HCC in patients with chronic liver disease by unknown mechanisms. silymarin can exert a beneficial effect on cell survival and apoptosis by interfering cytokines. anti-inflammatory activity and inhibitory effect of silymarin on the development of metastases have also been detected. phyllanthus Phyllantus Emblica exhibits a variety of pharmacological effects. herbal products have multiple pharmacological actions on human physiological systems that would support the treatment of chronic disease like cancer. the use of herbal medicines is safe compared with synthetic drugs. the limitations of clinical trials are the same as those for establishing efficacy. CAM seems to exert an antioxidant and antifibrotic effect on liver. for most herbal products, proof of efficacy by randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials is often lacking. CAM are usually distributed as \u201cfood supplements\u201d and not evaluated for safety and efficacy. the biologically active substances have been structurally defined and standardized for only a few of the herb. herbal products can protect the liver from oxidative injury, promote virus elimination, block fibrogenesis, or inhibit tumor growth."}
