{"summary": "self-reported health declaration forms were returned by 355,887 arrivals. of these, 608 symptomatic arrivals (0.2%) including 6 febrile arrivals were analyzed. the difference between thermal camera temperature (36.83\u00b0C) and tympanic temperature (38.14\u00b0C) was not statistically significant. thirteen quarantine stations nationwide adopted infrared thermal camera scanning to identify febrile arrivals. first, arrivals passing through airports, ports, or border lines are inspected by infrared thermal cameras. passengers are required to complete and submit health declaration forms, called self-reported health questionnaires. 887 arrivals (61% of total arrivals) came from quarantinable countries designated by the Korean minister of health and welfare. final study sample includes 608 subjects aged 1 to 86 who self-reported at least one symptom of runny nose, stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. temperatures reported in this research for febrile arrivals represent the first and second measurements of ear temperatures and the second measurement of thermal camera temperature. two quarantine officers retrieved information from the returned health declaration forms, including arrival date, nationality, age, gender, countries of stay during the past 10 days before arrival. 7 arrivals (61% of total arrivals) came from quarantinable countries designated by the Korean minister of health and welfare. the final study sample includes 608 subjects aged 1 to 86 who self-reported at least one symptom of runny nose, stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. temperatures reported in this research for febrile arrivals represent the first and second measurements of ear temperatures and the second measurement of thermal camera temperature. two quarantine officers retrieved information from the returned health declaration forms, including arrival date, nationality, age, gender, countries of stay during the past 10 days before arrival. second tympanic temperatures and re-measured thermal camera temperatures were retrieved from records for the six febrile arrivals. more than half of the sample was the elderly over 60 years of age. more than half of the sample was Chinese (55.9%), 37% Korean, 4.3% other Asian, and 1.6% European. most of the subjects (96.4%) stayed only in China. the fever screening at the international airport identified six febrile arrivals\u2013i.e., those with tympanic temperature above 37.8\u00b0C. this implies a fever prevalence of 0.002% (6 cases) among the total 355,887 arrivals from quarantinable countries. the most frequent symptom among symptomatic arrivals was runny or stuffy nose (48.8%). 79.1% of the symptomatic arrivals had tympanic temperature under 36.7\u00b0C. of the six febrile arrivals, three subjects reported cough, two had sore throats, two had fevers and one had an abdominal pain. average temperature from thermal camera scanning and average tympanic temperature were 36.83\u00b0C and 38.14\u00b0C respectively. paired t-test did not reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no significant difference between thermal camera scanning and tympanic temperatures. 4 (66.7) Age 25.1 12.7 40.315.5 9 23 (3.8) 0 (0.0) 10-19 229 (37.7) 0 (0.0) 20-29 152 (25.5) 2 (33.3) 40-49 43 (7.1) 0 (0.0) 50-59 28 (4.6) 2 (33.4) 60 7(1.2) 0 (0.0) Countries in Europe 10 (1.6) 0 (0.0) Others 8 (1.3) 0 (0.0) Stayed countries during past 10 days before arrival six cases comprised approximately 1% of the 608 symptomatic arrivals. two males and four females were in 20s of age, another two in 30s and two in 50s. all six febrile arrivals stayed in china during the past 10 days. rechecked tympanic temperature (38.14\u00b0C) was similar to the first one (38.20\u00b0C), with the thermal temperature (36.83\u00b0C) slightly lower than the ear temperature. paired t-test did not reject the null hypothesis, indicating there is no significant difference between thermal camera scanning and tympanic temperatures. a fever over 37.8\u00b0C is the most accurate predictor for cases confirmed of pandemic H1N1/09 compared with the cases of influenza-like illness. a fever over 37.8\u00b0C is the most accurate predictor for cases confirmed of pandemic H1N1/09 compared with the cases of influenza-like illness. the fever prevalence is lower than 0.004% during the influenza pandemic of 2009 in Japan [2] and the 0.08-0.10% of Taiwan for the years 2007-2010 [1], though they may not be directly comparable to one another because fever prevalence varies by influenza season, region and country of origin among arrivals. d serve as useful complements to one another in detecting febrile arrivals as accurately as possible. this research, for the first time in Korea, analyzed the fever prevalence and the effectiveness of mass thermal camera scanning to detect fever at an international airport in Korea."}
