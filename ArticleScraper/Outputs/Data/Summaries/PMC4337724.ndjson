{"summary": "introduction international air travel drove the spread of SARS in 2003 and influenza A/H1N1p in 2009 (Brockmann and Helbing, 2013), and has led to imported cases of influenza A/H7N9 (William et al., 2015), MERS-CoV (Cauchemez et al., 2014) and Ebola virus infection (McCarthy, 2014) traveller screening policies, including fever screening and/or questionnaires at point of departure and the probability a symptomatic patient will have a fever varies by pathogen. fever is notoriously non-specific as a symptom, leading to high opportunity costs from detaining travellers with non-target illnesses. self-reporting of symptoms or potential recent exposure to infection via mandatory questionnaires is also a common component of traveller screening programs. epidemiological knowledge on factors linked to risk of infection is limited for some pathogens\u2014particularly for pathogens with well-characterized routes of transmission. screening initiatives have also been implemented both at points of departure and arrival. departure screening is more efficient than entry screening because it needs to be implemented in only a few airports rather than globally. there is often local political pressure for arrival screening as well. knowledge of exposure would go undetected. each case represents a different detectability class. values for f and g are given in Table 2. the small size of this sample means there is greater uncertainty surrounding the estimate for proportion of cases that exhibit fever at onset. the small size of this sample means there is greater uncertainty surrounding the estimate for proportion of cases that exhibit fever at onset. the incubation period distribution for MERS-CoV is determined using data from only 23 confirmed cases. the variance might also expand with the addition of more data. a long incubation period presents challenges for symptom screening. fever screening is 50% and proportion of cases with known exposure history who report correctly is 0.25. expected proportions detected by screening when efficacy of fever screening is 70% and proportion of cases with known exposure history who report correctly is 0.25. the distribution of time since exposure will be influenced by the epidemic phase in the source population. the distribution of time since exposure will be influenced by the epidemic phase in the source population (Figure 4, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1). exposure risk detection does not vary with epidemic phase because exposure risk awareness does not depend on the infection age distribution. arrival screening will still miss half to three-quarters of infected travellers that manage to complete their flights. our model suggests half or more of case detection for filoviruses will be driven by exposure risk screening. when the epidemic has stabilized, the shift in the age structure of infections means fever is likely to become the dominant mechanism of case detection. despite a short, influenza-like median incubation time, screening outcomes for SARS-CoV are filovirus-like and less favorable. patients with known risks for Ebola exposure should be monitored by local health authorities near their travel destination until the maximum plausible incubation period has elapsed. fever screening becomes a potent tool within just a few days of exposure and eclipses the potential contribution of risk factor-driven detection. we assumed that fever and risk factor screening are implemented with 70% and 25% efficacy, respectively, which we consider upper bounds. the estimated efficacy of fever screening reflects the sensitivity of non-contact infrared thermal scanner equipment, but human factors may further reduce the efficacy of screening techniques. more valuable would be effective ways to motivate travellers to honestly report their risky exposures. arrival screening in australia detected 3 of an estimated 48 infected travellers. this initiative used a combination of risk factor and fever detection in a growing epidemic. we have treated fever screening as the primary means of detection. the overall effectiveness of traveller screening, and the total proportion of cases detected before and after a flight, are independent of screening order. cost and low effectiveness of screening have been noted. no formal cost analysis of traveller screening policies has ever been conducted. screening at departure rather than arrival has been suggested as a more cost-effective policy. screening policies have been implemented during several recent epidemics. some aspects of screening, particularly fever screening at arrival, have been criticized as having little scientific justification. political leaders and health policy makers are likely to consider implementing screening programs when public pressure becomes intense. to estimate the proportion of individuals with known source of exposure for a particular pathogen, we identified the fraction of confirmed cases. we assumed that exposure risk would not typically be known for MERS-CoV cases. this is consistent with recent publications highlighting the crucial knowledge gap in risk factors for MERS-CoV infection. time from exposure to onset (i.e., incubation period) and onset to hospitalization for different pathogens DOI:

from exposure to departure during growing epidemic and stable scenarios. first, we consider a stable scenario, when the epidemic in the source population is neither growing nor shrinking. so the infection age distribution of travellers will mirror that of the non-hospitalized case population. the probability density functions derived above are used to describe the distribution of times since exposure of individuals attempting travel. travellers are assigned to one of four detectability classes: fever present with symptom onset, aware of risk factors, neither or both. passengers pass through arrival screening using the same framework described above, using the appropriate efficacy parameters. to determine the probability that an individual with a known time since exposure is detected at arrival or departure by fever screening or risk detection, we ran the model using single, fixed times since exposure. f is the proportion of cases with fever, g is the proportion of cases

assumed that the probability that febrile travellers would be detected by fever screening was 70%. this is an optimistic estimate, ignoring possible challenges in implementation in outbreak-affected regions and oversight made by device operators. ported exposure screening identified 3/45 and 4/69 infected passengers respectively. a proportion 3/(0.25 45) = 0.27 and 4/(0.25 69) = 0.23 of infected travellers who knew their exposure history reported so on the questionnaire. assumption of independent decisions on each questionnaire is optimistic. to model time to hospitalization we assume a simple case, in which all individuals progress to hospitalization after a fixed period of time. the probability density function for exposure-to-hospitalization is represented by a delta function centered at the average time from exposure to hospitalization in days derived from empirical studies. the probability density functions derived above are used to describe the distribution of times since exposure of individuals attempting travel. travellers are assigned to one of four detectability classes: fever present with symptom onset, aware of risk factors, neither. the proportion of individuals assigned to any detectability class is assumed independent of time since exposure. to determine the probability that an individual with a known time since exposure is detected at arrival or departure by fever screening or risk detection, we ran the model using single, fixed times since exposure. we then used the infection age distributions described in Equations 1 and 4 to estimate overall detection effectiveness. we assume the basic reproduction number, defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by each infectious case in the early period of the outbreak, is R0. the rate at which the number of infected individuals in the population changes is therefore given by: d I d t = R 0 I D. the fraction of travellers in each respective category is f (1 g); (1 f )g; (1 f )(1 g); fg. the efficacy parameters have two subscripts: the first subscript is f, denoting fever screening, or g, denoting exposure risk screening, and the second subscript is d, denoting departure screening. between august and November 2014, only two Ebola importations occurred in the united states. we chose to simulate detection for a population of 50 infected individuals. we then recorded the number of individuals identified by screening. all the provided code to perform analyses and generate figures presented in this manuscript."}
