{"summary": "nasopharyngeal (MT) swabs are an alternative due to ease of collection and self-collection by patients. the swabs were tested for viral respiratory infections using Seeplex\u00ae RV12 multiplex PCR detection kit. sensitivity of NP swabs is suboptimal and newly discovered viruses cannot be detected by rapid antigen tests. flocked mid-turbinate swabs are an alternative to NP swabs that are more comfortable for patients and may permit self-collection by adult patients. 60 working adults from Toronto, Ontario were recruited into a pilot study of influenza infection and followed for symptoms of acute respiratory illness until may 2009. subjects were asked to report all episodes with either fever or two or more respiratory symptoms (stuffy/runny nose, cough, scratchy/sore throat, sneezing, hoarseness) they were then to submit a self-collected flocked mid-turbinate swab (Copan FLOQSw PCR products were visualized using ethidium bromide on 2% agarose electrophoresis gels as previously described. results Thirty eight subjects reported 76 episodes with acute respiratory symptoms. median age of the 60 participants was 41.1 years (range 23\u201359 years), 43 (72%) were female, 9 (15%) were smokers, and 12 (20%) had an underlying medical conditions. of the 76 matched sets of swabs submitted, 33 (43%) were submitted on the first day of illness, 28 (37%) on the second, 9 (12%) on the third day, and the remaining 6 (8%) on days 4\u20139. Viruses were somewhat more likely to be detected from persons reporting febrile illness (7/14 (50%) episodes with fever yielded viruses versus 22/62 (35%) afebrile episodes.
