{"summary": "793 women participated with 27.9% receiving trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine concomitantly. 79% of participants reported mild or moderate pain and 2.6% severe pain. most of these occurred within 24 h. acellular pertussis-containing vaccine (Tdap) be given to any person, including pregnant women, likely to be in contact with infants under the age of 12 months. acellular pertussis-containing vaccine (Tdap) be given to any person, including pregnant women, between 28 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. recruitment for this arm began earlier, from late September 2012 to late June 2014. participants aged 18\u201340 years and administered Tdap between 30 and 36 weeks gestation were identified via claims submitted by general practices. in both study arms, consent to be contacted by members of the research team was sought at the time of vaccination. an AE is any untoward medical occurrence temporally associated with administration of the vaccine and does not include common injection site reactions. an AE is any untoward medical occurrence temporally associated with administration of the vaccine. the diary card (Northern arm) allowed recording of injection site reactions, fever and unsolicited events over 3 days (days 0, 1 and 2). Response categories were consistent with Brighton Collaboration definitions and guidelines for events following immunisation. the northern arm of the study was conducted primarily in Auckland. women being administered Tdap between 28 and 38 weeks gestation were identified by staff from 21 out of 24 participating general practices. the other arm was conducted in Canterbury, a more ethnically homogeneous south island region of just over half a million. data collection and main outcomes Northern participants left the practice/clinic after their vaccination were given a study envelope containing an information sheet, consent form and clear plastic measuring tool. participants were given a study envelope containing an information sheet, consent form, clear plastic measuring tool and a 3-day diary card to record any symptoms or events. an SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalisation or causes prolongation of existing hospitalisation; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. all SAEs were followed up by a study clinician. results are summarised as counts and percentages for each outcome. other outcomes, such as fever, nausea and myalgia, summarised as presence or absence. Approximately one-half of northern participants were co-administered influenza vaccine and 13% of Canterbury participants. Pain was the most commonly reported reaction to the Tdap injection with 79.0% reporting mild or moderate pain in total. pain resolved by (h) 0\u201324 30 (11.1) 131 (34.7) 161 (25.1) 25\u201348 86 (31.9) 141 (37.4) 227 (35.4) >49 154 (57.0) 99 (26.3) 253 (39.5) Missing \u2013 6 (1.6) 6 (0.9) All cases of swelling had an onset within 48 h with half unresolved after 48 h. erythema was reported by 5.8% of participants with 0.4% reporting erythema of greater than 5 cm. onset was generally within 48 h and resolution over 48 h for half of these. all were uncommon and reported by fewer than 4% of participants. around one-third of those who reported a systemic event also received the influenza vaccine at the same time. 25 reports were for diagnosed non-injection site infections (eg, chest, urine and throat) there were 23 hospitalisations following immunisation that occurred during pregnancy. obstetric bleeding (4), hypertension (2), infection (4), tachycardia (1), preterm labour (9), exacerbation of pre-existing condition (2) and pre-eclampsia (1). labour required hospitalisation 19 36 20 Vaginal bleeding Required hospitalisation 21 34 21 Preterm labour Required hospitalisation 15* 36 23 Infection (coronavirus) Required hospitalisation 1 34 *No delivery date was recorded for this participant. there were eight SAEs that occurred during labour and delivery. there were six reported in the Northern arm and two in the Canterbury arm. 79.0% of participants reported mild or moderate pain in total. onset of pain occurred within 24 h in 83.9% of participants. differences in intensity, onset and resolution. the time to resolution was the same in both groups with 49% resolving within 48 h. erythema was reported by 5.8% of participants with 0.4% reporting erythema of greater than 5 cm. any induration was reported by 12% of participants, of whom half took more than 48 h to resolve. systemic events Fever was reported by 17 (2.1%) participants, 14 of whom reported this occurring within 24 h. there were 10 reports of fever in the Northern participants and 7 reports in the Southern participants. there were 115 AEs and SAEs in 113 participants (two events each for two participants) reported to CARM, in accordance with local guidelines. of the 31 events deemed to be serious (3.9%), there were 23 hospitalisations following immunisation. eight SAEs occurred during labour in and among infants of 793 pregnant women vaccinated with Tdap Participant Event SAE definition Onset post-Tdap (days) Gestation at time of event (weeks) 24 Cyanotic episodes in infant Prolongation of existing hospital. non-reassuring fetal status Hospitalisation 23 39 28 Non-reassuring fetal status Intervention to prevent permanent damage or death 37 41 29 Non-reassuring fetal status Admission to the NICU and continuous positive airway pressure 28 37 31 Perinatal death (stillbirth) Resulted in death 53 40 Clinician review and assessment of each of these cases found none were likely to be vaccine related. women in our group were older (32 vs 29.2 years) and more likely to be of NZ European ethnicity than the general NZ maternal population. this is most likely a reflection of the health-seeking behaviour associated with these demographics. 26 28 Rates of swelling with a diameter of more than 50 mm ranged from 1% to 18% in clinical studies. in our study population, just 0.4% recorded a swelling of more than 50 mm and fewer than 8% reported any. both events were infrequent and mild. most of the reported fevers in our northern participants also occurred after co-administration with influenza vaccine. some influenza vaccines are known to be more pyrogenic than others, so it is possible that influenza vaccine was the cause. there were 132 reports identified, 20 following Boostrix with no non-pregnancy SAEs. the events occurred at variable time periods following immunisation. the events occurred at variable time periods following immunisation."}
