ACE2 KO body weight was no longer different from WT. FBG levels (231.4 13.8 mg/dl, P 0.001; Fig. 1B) and glucose intolerance (P 0.001; Fig. 1, C and D) were further increased. islet area was measured within each treatment group. both RD-fed and HFD-fed ACE2 KO mice showed higher islet area. ACE2 KO showed signs of acinar atrophy throughout the exogenous pancreas. to better understand the relationship between ACE2 and insulin secretion, we performed immunohistochemistry on the islets of WT mice under RD and HFD conditions. we surprisingly observed abundant ACE2 immunofluorescence in glucagon-producing -cells, but not in insulin-secreting -cells in both RD- and HFD-fed mice. ACE2 (green) and glucagon (red) superimposed image and zoomed in superimposed image of ACE2+Glucagon+DAPI (indicated by yellow arrows) in WT RD (B1) and WT HFD (B2) pancreatic sections. glucagon gene expression was not different between WT and ACE2 KO mice on a HFD. ACE2 KO mice are already known to be hypoinsulinemic (45) and hyperglycemic (4). the compensatory upregulation in plasma insulin levels did not take place in these animals while on HFD. glycemia is tightly regulated by insulin and glucagon. ex vivo treatment with normal (5 mM) and high (25 mM) glucose concentrations in the presence and absence of 100 nM ANG II and ANG-(1\u20137) for 3 h showed no effect on glucagon mRNA levels in isolated islets of WT mice. mice on RD were also injected with the control virus. effects of Lenti-mACE2 gene therapy on fasting blood glucose. three weeks after the pancreatic injection of Lenti-mACE2. Lenti-mACE2-treated mice showed a reduction in fasting plasma insulin levels compared with Lenti-GFP-treated HFD-fed mice. this normalization of plasma insulin levels appears to result from improved -cell function. this normalization of plasma insulin levels appears to result from improved -cell function, presumably by correction of pancreatic RAS overactivity as ACE2 therapy did not change insulin sensitivity. RD and HFD-fed mice treated with Lenti-GFP showed increased plasma ANG II (C), pancreatic ANG II (D), reduced pancreatic mACE2 activity (E), and restored ACE2 activity (E) in the pancreas of the HFD-fed mice. ACE2 gene therapy normalizes RAS activity in the exogenous pancreas. consumption of HFD was associated with a 50% reduction in pancreatic ACE2 activity compared with RD-fed mice. ACE2 gene therapy reversed the effects of HFD feeding in the pancreas. but it failed to normalize the elevated ANG II levels in the plasma. HFD + Lenti-GFP showed a significant increase in mCol1 gene expression compared with RD + Lenti-GFP group. HFD + Lenti-ACE2-treated group significantly decreased mCol1 mRNA levels in the pancreas. ACE2 KO mice on RD were smaller than WT (27.6 0.9 g, P 0.05; Fig. 1A) and already displayed increased FBG (149.9 7.9 mg/dl, P 0.001; Fig. 1A) from WT. after 16 wk of HFD, ACE2 KO body weight was no longer different from WT. n = 39\u201349 mice for WT RD and HFD groups; n = 14\u201319 mice for ACE2 KO RD and HFD groups. HFD increases RAS activity in the islets of Langerhans independently of ACE2 levels. ACE2 KO RD, 2.8 mM: 6.6 2.2 vs. 25 mM: 4.3 1.3 and ACE2 KO HFD, 2.8 mM: 3.1 0.8 vs. 25 mM: 3.3 0.6 ng insulinh1g protein1) to better understand the relationship between ACE2 and insulin secretion, we performed immunohistochemistry on the islets of WT mice. RD-fed mice showed no difference in islet mACE2 gene expression levels (n = 5/group) (B) or activity (n = 7 or 8/group) (C) compared with RD-fed control mice. ACE2 KO mice showed significantly increased mAT1aR gene expression levels. glucagon gene expression was not different between ACE2 and ACE2 KO mice on RD. glucagon gene expression was reduced by 70% compared with ACE2 KO mice on RD. plasma insulin levels were significantly upregulated in ACE2 KO mice fed a HFD. ANG II and ANG-(1\u20137) had no effect on glucagon gene expression in isolated islets of WT and ACE2 KO mice. ACE2 gene therapy improves glycemia in HFD-fed mice. -fed mice, Lenti-mACE2 or Lenti-GFP (106 TU/ml, 100 l) were injected in the pancreas at the 13th week of HFD feeding. by that time, mice on a HFD have already developed a significant increase in body weight (RD: 26.3 0.6 vs. HFD: 35.5 0.5 g, P 0.001), FBG levels compared with RD-fed mice. serum C-peptide levels were measured as an index of fasting insulin levels. HFD-fed mice treated with Lenti-mACE2 showed a normalization of serum C-peptide levels (2.5 0.2 vs. 4.4 0.2 ng/ml) compared with Lenti-GFP-treated HFD-fed mice. this normalization of plasma insulin levels appears to result from improved -cell function. effects of Lenti-mACE2 gene therapy on renin angiotensin system (RAS) overactivity and ADAM17 activity in the pancreas of the HFD-fed mice. three weeks after the pancreatic injection of Lenti-mACE2 (n = 8) or the control lentivirus Lenti-GFP (n = 8) were determined in RD and HFD-fed mice. ACE2 gene therapy reversed the effects of HFD feeding in the pancreas. fibrosis and collagen expression were significantly increased in the exogenous pancreas of HFD-fed mice. RD + Lenti-GFP (A), HFD + Lenti-GFP (B) and HFD+Lenti-ACE2 (C)-treated groups showed a significant increase in mCol1 gene expression compared with RD + Lenti-GFP (D), and HFD + Lenti-ACE2 (C)-treated groups. ACE2 KO mice fed HFD for 16 wk showed a significant increase in body weight. ACE2 KO mice on RD were smaller than WT (27.6 0.9 g, P 0.05; Fig. 1A) HFD induced a significant increase in fasting blood glucose levels (B) and impaired glucose tolerance (C and D) that was exacerbated in ACE2 KO mice. changes in isolated islets of 16-wk HFD-fed mice showed a significant increase in AT1aR mRNA in islets. ACE2 KO on RD showed a paradoxical normalization of islet AT1aR mRNA expression. ANG II is known to impair insulin secretion. islet ACE2 expression and activity unchanged in RD-fed mice. glycemic dysregulation is independent of islet ACE2 levels. RD-fed ACE2 KO mice showed significantly increased mAT1aR gene expression levels. ACE2+Glucagon+DAPI (indicated by yellow arrows) in WT RD (B1) and WT HFD (B2) pancreatic sections. rectangular insets in each superimposed panel point to the region used to obtain zoomed-in superimposed image. glucagon gene expression was not different between ACE2 and ACE2 KO mice on a HFD. isolated islets were treated with ANG II and ANG-(1\u20137). exposure to a standard concentration (100 nM) of ANG II and ANG-(1\u20137) had no effect on glucagon gene expression in isolated islets under either normal or high glucose conditions. ACE2 gene therapy improves glycemia in HFD-fed mice. the exaggerated disruption of glycemic control in ACE2 KO mice supports a rationale for ACE2 therapy in type 2 diabetes. HFD-fed mice treated with Lenti-mACE2 showed a normalization of serum C-peptide levels (2.5 0.2 vs. 4.4 0.2 ng/ml) compared with Lenti-GFP-treated mice. this normalization of plasma insulin levels appears to result from improved -cell function. i-mACE2-treated mice showed increased GSIS compared with the Lenti-GFP group. this suggests that ACE2 expression attenuates the deteriorating effects of a HFD on insulin secretion in the islets. ACE2 gene therapy normalizes RAS activity in the exogenous pancreas. HFD-fed mice showed significantly higher plasma (3.2 0.6 vs. 1.4 0.4 ng/ml, P 0.05; Fig. 6C) and pancreatic (3.4 0.2 vs. 1.43 0.3 ng/g, P 0.05; Fig. 6E) fibrosis (Fig. 7, A and B) and collagen expression (Fig. 7D) were significantly increased in the exogenous pancreas of HFD-fed mice. the contribution of elevated ANG II levels to this process was further confirmed by the reversal observed following ACE2 gene therapy. we have not considered the contribution of the exogenous pancreas. we recently showed that ADAM17 does not appear to reduce ACE2 activity in islets. ACE2 gene therapy reduces local ADAM17, fibrosis, and ANG II levels. elevated RAS activity has been associated with glucose dysregulation in HFD-fed mice (15) and downregulation of ACE2 levels in the pancreas. the pivotal role of ACE2 is further evidenced by the rise in mAT1aR gene expression in the islets of ACE2 KO mice. b/db mice could be reversed by ACE2 gene therapy only in the early development of the disease (3). this suggests that the observed RAS overactivation in islets of ACE2 KO mice at baseline could be one possible (but not the only) mechanism that is making them prone to age-dependent impaired glucose homeostasis (37). study the role of islet ACE2 in -cell dysfunction. the remaining 20\u201340% of cell types in these islets can contribute significantly toward glucose homeostasis. previous studies demonstrated that ACE2 can be a key component in the maintenance of euglycemia because of its potential effects on insulin. ACE2 KO mice showed significant atrophy of the pancreas with smaller and loose acini compared with WT mice. this reiterates that ACE2 may be important not only in glycemic regulation but also in maintaining pancreas morphology and probably pancreas mass. effects of ACE2 on glycemia are mediated through both ANG-(1\u20137)/MasR signaling (3) and decreased ANG II/AT1R signaling (10) in the pancreas. identification of ANG II in the exocrine pancreas coupled with reduction in pancreatic ANG II levels upon Lenti-mACE2 injection suggests the likelihood of ACE2 present in the exocrine portion of the pancreas degrades exo ACE2 present in the pancreas is downregulated in db/db and ANG II-infused mice. ACE2 gene therapy to the pancreas restored loss of ACE2 and improve glycemia. ACE2 present in the islets is not altered in the HFD-induced diabetic state. pancreas may exert a beneficial role in HFD-induced hyperglycemic state, mostly by combatting ANG II-induced detrimental effects. more work is also needed to better tease out the potential paracrine effects of -cells or nonendocrine ACE2 on insulin secretion in normal and diabetic conditions.
