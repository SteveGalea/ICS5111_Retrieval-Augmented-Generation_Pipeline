{"summary": "protein fibrillation is one of the important physiological processes that have been linked to development of many pathological conditions. globular proteins undergo structural perturbation followed by a series of structural transitions leading to the formation of insoluble fibrils. excessive deposition/accumulation of stable, ordered and amorphous protein aggregates are collectively called amyloid fibrils. the idea behind such anti-amyloid agent is to inhibit the creation of amyloidogenic aggregate. the solution state of insulin contains a mixture of different oligomeric species including hexamer, tetramer, dimer and monomer. NK9 delays the fibrillation process of insulin even in sub-stoichiometric ratio. the polypeptide fragments that have property of self-recognition are important for design of peptide based anti-amyloidogenic agents. the fibrillation proceeds via dissociation of insulin oligomers into monomers. this was the rationale behind the use of metal ions like Zn2+ or Ca2+ to stabilize the hexameric structure. a method to stabilize insulin was to promote native hydrophobic interactions. fluorescence Thioflavin T (ThT) is a dye that preferentially binds to amyloid-like fibrils thereby causing substantial enhancement in its fluorescence emission intensity. NK9 delayed the fibrillation process of insulin in a concentration dependant manner. inset showed a plot of lag time of insulin fibrillation in presence of 100 M NK9 against incubation time. maximum lag time (200 min) was observed when NK9 was added after 15 min of incubation. NK9 became 125 min when the peptide was added after 30 min. TEM data shows that insulin fibrils in absence of NK9 are branched and those in presence of NK9 are less associated. this indicates that NK9 only delayed the association process in the pre-fibrillar nucleation phase. NK9 does not kinetically affect the post nucleation process leading to fibril growth. helix content of insulin in presence of NK9 decreased only to 42%. NK9 helps insulin to retain its secondary structure for a prolonged period of time. NK9 does not have a well-defined structure even in the presence of insulin. cal protein insulin has a characteristic peak at 1654 cm1 in its amide I contour. on conversion into amyloid like fibrils, the peak shifts to 1628 cm1. FT-IR spectra of insulin measured at various intervals of incubation. each spectrum is an average of 32 scans and subtracted from solvent spectrum. panel C shows ratio of absorbance of -sheet peak at 1628 cm1 to helical peak at 1654 cm1. panel D shows percentage of -helix and -sheet present in native and fibrillar insulin in presence and absence of NK9. prior incubation of insulin in citrate phosphate buffer showed a retention time of 16.9 ml (Figure 5A) this retention time corresponds to the trimeric structure of insulin that corroborates well with earlier findings by Banga and co-workers. NK9 is a short peptide, binding with insulin does not have any influence on molecular mass and on the retention time of insulin. as incubation time proceeds, the absorbance value at both retention time points decreased. ation of insulin bound with NK9 is reflected due to the increase in scatting intensity as the incubation time increases. however, after 240 min of incubation, insulin started to form visible precipitates. each spectrum is an average of 36 scans. anisotropy experiment at 37\u00b0C showed plateau beyond 2 M concentration of insulin implying almost 41 binding of NK9 to insulin. Binding curves were obtained with apparent Kd values of 2.2 M and 1.2 M for binding to insulin at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, respectively. selective saturation to the receptor is transferred to the bound ligand via spin diffusion, without affecting the ligand signal alone. excess of ligand compared to its receptor is used in the STD experiments to achieve effective magnetization transfer from the receptor to the ligand at its bound state. strong STD effect was observed for the methyl groups of NK9 in presence of insulin. the docking model is in very good agreement with the STD NMR result. key residues of NK9 found to be involved in contact with NK9 are PheB1, ValB2, GlnB3, LeuB6, HisB10 and LeuB17. only the few residues of chain A showed proximity to the residues of NK9. the RMSD plot for chain A is found to be unaffected in the simulation course. there is no observation regarding the loss of secondary structure in any chain of insulin that corresponds to the stability of whole structure. the minute increase in Rg is genuine and can be attributed to the absence of crystal packing in the micro-canonical ensemble of simulation. all the conformations sampled for simulation were analyzed in terms of linear relationships between atomic motions using the first three prime eigenvectors. the correlation scatter plots link the motions of \u2018related\u2019 fluctuations with those of \u2018total\u2019 fluctuations in the system. the study of hemolytic activity of NK9 peptide showed less than 0.5% hemolysis for the various concentrations of peptide assayed up to a final concentration of 250 M. the positive control for this experiment was 1% Triton X 100. HT1080 cells were treated with varying concentrations (5, 10, 25 and 50 M) of NK9 peptide. the positive control for this experiment was 0.5% Triton X 100. strategies for prevention of insulin fibrillation included promotion of self-association. NK9 is a dye that preferentially binds to amyloid-like fibrils. the lag time for insulin fibrillation was 120 min. NK9 delayed the fibrillation process in a concentration dependant manner. NK9 (100 M) was added to the buffer solutions (pH 2.6) of insulin (350 M) at 62\u00b0C at 0, 15, 20 and 30 min of incubation. inset showed a plot of lag time of insulin fibrillation in presence of 100 M NK9 against incubation time. maximum lag time was observed when NK9 was added after 15 min of incubation. initial stage of nucleation in the absence of NK9 seems to be over in 30 min incubation. addition of NK9 after 30 min thus did not affect the fibrillation kinetics. difference in binding behavior of insulin with NK9 is attributed to the change in fibril morphology of insulin in the absence as well as in the presence of NK9. far UV-CD spectra of insulin at different time points of incubation. negative ellipticity values at 222 nm and 208 nm also decrease. helix content of insulin decreased to 39% with little increase in -sheet structure. FT-IR study FT-IR has been used to study secondary structure of proteins for decades. being an helical protein insulin has a characteristic peak at 1654 cm1 in its amide I contour. peak shifts to 1628 cm1, which is the hallmark of cross -sheet structure formation. curve fitting analysis showed that insulin in the presence and absence of NK9 has similar percentages of -helix and -sheet content irrespective of NK9 presence. mature fibrils of insulin have 60% -sheet content irrespective of NK9 presence. it was confirmed by using BSA and lysozyme that both proteins retained their globular shape as retention time at this acidic pH did not significantly change from those at pH 7.0. prior incubation of insulin in citrate phosphate buffer showed a retention time of 16.9 ml (Figure 5A) this retention time corresponds to the trimeric structure of insulin that corroborates well with earlier findings by Banga and co-workers. the first peak could be due to Insulin-NK9 complex and the latter for NK9 alone. the peak appeared at 18.1 min when absorbance values were taken at wavelength 280 nm. as incubation time proceeds, the absorbance value at both retention time points decreased. Insulin in presence of NK9 shows hydrodynamic radii of 2.1 nm. this 0.1 nm increase is within experimental error. but subtle change in conformation of insulin bound with NK9 is reflected. after 240 min of incubation, insulin started to form visible precipitates. anisotropy experiment at 37\u00b0C showed plateau beyond 2 M concentration of insulin implying almost 41 binding of NK9 to insulin. NK9-insulin complex formation increases at elevated temperatures. the peptide is highly flexible in solution state and does not adopt any folded conformation in presence of insulin. we used one dimensional proton STD NMR to identify the epitope of a ligand is in close proximity with the receptor [37]. the experiments were performed at 298 K with 2 sec of saturation time. NK9 is found to be in close proximity within the molecular patch between N-ter and helical portion of chain B. the docking model is in very good agreement with the STD NMR result. the RMSD plot for chain A is found to be unaffected in the simulation course. there is no observation regarding the loss of secondary structure in any chain of insulin. the RMSD plot for chain A is found to be unaffected in the simulation course. 100 ns MD simulation results for insulin-NK9 complex. RMSD plot for chain A and B of insulin and NK9. color codes used to distinguish each chain in the plot. the replica exchange study confirms that the conformational switch does not cross the energy barrier to reach the form defined as amyloid plaque. this is the reason the replicas do not show disordered deviation plots. NK9 peptide showed less than 0.5% hemolysis for different concentrations. the positive control for this experiment was 1% Triton X 100. the molar extinction co-efficient of 36,000 M1 cm1 was determined from its absorbance at 412 nm using the molar extinction co-efficient of 36,000 M1 cm1 [57]. the kinetic profile was analyzed by curve fitting into Boltzmann equation (a sigmoidal function) solution was taken in microcon filter device fitted with a 3-kDa cut-off membrane. the sample was centrifuged at 4000g for 8 to 10 min to bring volume down to 50 l. the deuterium exchange process was repeated for 3\u20134 times. two drops containing 10 l of 2% uranyl acetate (Agar Scientific) were placed on the grid. the excess water was removed carefully with filter paper. the grid was left to dry in air. 1525 HPLC system at a flow rate of 0.35 ml.min1 with dual mode detection at 280 and 220 nm. the column was equilibrated with 25 mM citrate phosphate buffer to obtain a stable base line. after that 20 l of 2.0 mg/ml insulin solutions at different incubation times was centrifuged and then supernatant of the solution was loaded on the column to see the association state of insulin in presence and absence of two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY spectra of NK9 were acquired in buffer solutions containing 10% D2O at pH 2.6 with a peptide concentration of 1 mM. the mixing times for TOCSY and NOESY experiments were set to 80 ms and 400 ms. insulin and NK9 were dissolved in a buffer containing 99.9% D2O and lyophilized for at least three times. the pH was adjusted to 2.6. the STD-NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer equipped at a temperature of 298 K. ps:100 K\u2013100 ps:300 ps:300 K\u2013200 ps:400 K\u2013300 ps:400 K\u2013500 ps:300 K\u20131000 ps. the frames are saved at an interval of 4.8 ps. the system was solvated with 10 boundaries from edge in orthorhombic boundary conditions, using TIP3P water models and neutralized with appropriate counter ions. the system was first subjected to energy minimization with 4000 steps of steepest descent and then to the default relaxation protocol, as present in Desmond MD system. a total of sixteen replicas were run under umbrella sampling as to simulate the insulin-NK9 complex over temperature landscape, viz. 310, 315, 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350, 355, 360, 365, 370, 375, 385 and 395 K. cell line used in experiment was HT1080, a human fibro sarcoma cell line obtained from ATCC. cells were incubated for 24 hr at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 100% relative humidity. blood was drawn by experienced clinical technician after obtaining written consent from the volunteers. blood was drawn by experienced clinical technician after obtaining written consent from the volunteers. Insulin solution (2 mg.ml1) at pH 2.6 was incubated in a water bath at 62\u00b0C. aliquots were taken out at different time instants of incubation. NK9 also was separately incubated and aliquots were taken out at different time instants of incubation. curve fitting of amide I contours was performed using origin 6.0 software. the percentage of each secondary structure was computed to be the fractional area of the corresponding peaks, divided by the sum of the areas of all the peaks. the value of D is obtained from the fitting of the experimental values of the time correlation function g2() according to the Equation 1. where, is the time, A is the baseline of the correlation function, B is the intercept of the correlation function, q = (4\u043bn/) sin (/2) is the scattering vector, n is the refractive index of the solution, and is the scattering angle. excitation of FITC labeled NK9 was done at 453 nm. FITC tagged NK9 concentration was 10 M, whereas insulin concentration was varied between 0.5 to 8 M. two-dimensional transferred NOESY experiments were carried out at a Peptides/insulin molar ratio of 121 at 298 K. the spectral width was normally 12 ppm in both dimensions. after 16 dummy scans, 120 scans were recorded per t1 increment. D NMR spectrum (on resonance either 0.5 or 7.3 ppm and off resonance 40 ppm) showed very successful saturation transfer across the protein. on the other hand, the free peptide, NK9 do not show any STD effects saturating at the same frequency as the complex. data processing was performed using TOPSPIN program suite. the protein was energy minimized before it was processed for docking. the docking protocol was used to search possible binding orientation of peptide over insulin. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a valuable tool to extract and large-scale correlated atomic motions of a system from simulation trajectory. all the data points for PCA analysis were extracted from simulation trajectory using GROMACS program. fresh human blood was centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min and the cell pellet was washed thrice and re-suspended in 10 mM PBS at pH 7.4 to obtain a final concentration of 1109 erythrocytes/ml. samples were then subjected to centrifugation at 3500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. samples of cell suspension (500 l) were plated on to 24 well plates at an initial confluency of 30%. Varying concentration of peptide was added going up to a maximum concentration of 50 M and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 44 hr. plates were rinsed with millipore water twice and air dried. NK9 was found to be in close proximity to leuA13, TyrA14 and GluA17. aggregation site was found to be leuA13 and LeuA16. bioLuminate software may provide clue to develop next generation peptides. s for insulin-NK9 complex shows the exchange of replicas over the temperature platform in the simulation time course.
