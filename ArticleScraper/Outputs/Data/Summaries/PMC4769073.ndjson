{"summary": "the family Coronaviridae is divided into the subfamilies Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. MHV has a monopartite, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. the 5\u2032 two thirds of the genome contains two long open reading frames. polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are proteolytically cleaved by virus-encoded proteases, PLP1 and PLP2 (in nsp3) and 3CL (nsp5) to produce the non-structural proteins nsp1 to nsp16. each subgenomic mRNA is identical to a 3\u2032-coterminal region of the virus genome. polyproteins pp1a and pp1b are translated from the genomic RNA. the 3\u2032 ORFs are expressed from a series of subgenomic RNAs. each subgenomic RNA contains a 5\u2032 leader sequence that is identical to the 5\u2032 leader of the genome. ribosome profiling is an emerging methodology that facilitates global mapping of the positions of translating ribosomes on the transcriptome. the technique exploits the knowledge that translating ribosomes can protect from RNase digestion a defined fragment of mRNA of around 28\u201330 nt in length. ribosome profiling has been applied to a variety of cellular organisms to address a range of questions in translational control and global gene expression. the first analysis of RNA virus replication and gene expression by ribosome profiling (and parallel RNASeq), using MHV as a model system. the data allowed us to determine the time course of virus positive and negative-sense RNA production, as well as the translation of each of the virus genes. cycloheximide (CHX) alone, or harringtonine (HAR) then CHX (as detailed in Materials and Methods) were prepared for each time point, deep sequenced and reads mapped to host and virus sequences. the composition of each library is summarised in S1A Table and S1 Fig. negative-sense virus RNA is present at much lower amounts than positive-sense RNA, but follows roughly the same expression patterns. low levels of negative-sense RiboSeq reads were also observed but these had length distributions that did not match typical RPF length distributions. however, they may derive from low amounts of RNA non-specifically co-sedimenting with ribosomes. Fig 2 shows enlarged views of the virus transcript 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 ORFs. the depth of RNASeq reads in the 5\u2032 UTR is similar to that of the N ORF, reflecting that the major contribution to 5\u2032 leader sequence comes from mRNA7. nt offset to map approximate P-site positions for RPFs derived from non-organellar ribosomes of eukaryotic organisms. mapping of the 5\u2032 end positions to coding sequences characteristically reflects the triplet periodicity of translational decoding. the extent of phasing can vary between protocols and libraries. a discrete peak in RPF abundance was observed just upstream of the initiation site. the peak corresponds to the 5\u2032 ends of RPFs derived from initiating ribosomes with the AUG codon in the ribosomal P-site. for many samples, a discrete peak was also observed 15 nt upstream of the stop codon. peak 12 nt upstream of the AUG and a very low level of phasing within the CDS likely represents a low level of contamination of RNASeq samples by RiboSeq samples. the latter may largely derive from translation of uORFs in various locations and phases with respect to the main ORF of each mRNA. a comparison of read length distributions of host-derived RNA and virus-derived RNA revealed contamination of this type in some of our libraries. in the first biological repeat, the virus and host length distributions in the 5 h p.i. RiboSeq CHX sample were almost identical. however, the virus length distribution resembled the RiboSeq CHX 5 h p.i. length distribution. this suggests that this sample is contaminated with RNASeq material from a sample containing little or no virus RNA, thus affecting the host mRNA length distribution but not the virus RNA length distribution. this suggests that this sample is contaminated with RNASeq material from a sample containing little or no virus RNA, thus affecting the host mRNA length distribution. a low level of 3\u2032 UTR occupancy derives from genuine coding exons in one splice form. low levels of post-termination unrecycled 80S ribosomes may enter the 3\u2032 UTR [30\u201332] for mock infections, the 3\u2032 UTR read length distributions largely matched those of the CDSs. a mechanism for the latter could be overloading of the host cell ribosome recycling factors (ABCE1 and any cofactors), allowing an increase in post-termination unrecycled 80S ribosomes entering the 3\u2032 UTR [31] if a proportion of late time-point contamination results from virus proteins interacting with mRNA to form RNPs, it may be significantly higher for virus RNA than for host mRNA. virus translation as a fraction of total cellular translation increased 700 to 20,000-fold from 1 to 5 h p.i. virus positive-sense RNA increased 80 to 200-fold over the same time period. infection progressed a little slower in repeat 1. similar data represented on a linear scale; hatched bars\u2014repeat 1, solid bars\u2014repeat 2. cells were infected with MHV-A59 (MOI 10) and harvested at 1, 2.5, 5 and 8 h p.i. cell lysates were separated by 10% (for N and S westerns) or 17% (for nsp9 westerns) the same analysis was applied to the negative-sense virus RNAs. we also omitted the 1 h p.i. time point due to the low levels of virus reads. values for 1 h p.i. and 2.5 h p.i. RiboSeq, and 1 h p.i. repeat 1 RiboSeq should be considered as upper bounds and the 1 h p.i. repeat 1 RiboSeq values have been omitted. the 3\u2032 ORFs 2, S, 5, E, M and N are all translated at comparable efficiencies. gRNA translation efficiency calculated in this way was low even at 2.5 h p.i. (repeat 2, ORF1a translational efficiency 0.11) this suggests that incoming and early synthesis gRNA is largely involved in RNA synthesis, or is, indeed, inherently poorly translated. relative abundances of different mRNA species (positive-sense) at 5 h p.i. were estimated either from mean RNASeq density (decumulated as described in the caption to Fig 4) or from the abundance of leader/body \u201cchimeric\u201d RNASeq reads spanning the corresponding TRS junction site. a variable number of tandem copies of UCUAA are present at the leader junction site. pentanucleotide is a perfect pentanucleotide at the canonical junction site. other mRNAs have a better pentanucleotide match at the site 5 nt upstream. for mRNA7, the upstream pentanucleotide is CCUAA instead of UCUAA. +2 in the genome sequence differed from UC, the RNASeq read generally contained nucleotides templated by the genome sequence rather than the UC in the leader sequence (e.g. CC instead of UC for the nt 22483 junction) this latter site aligns with a TRS previously identified for an HE mRNA in the MHV-JHM strain of MHV. the translation efficiencies of virus mRNAs were calculated as described in the caption to Fig 4. Host mRNA translation efficiencies are based on the ratio of all RiboSeq or RNASeq reads mapping to any annotated coding region. a clear trough in RPF density is visible after the ORF1a initiation peak, followed by higher density further downstream in ORF1a. the trough reflects run-off of elongating ribosomes in the three minutes between addition of HAR (which inhibits new initiation events) and CHX (which freezes the ribosomes) compared length distribution of reads in the N region with length distribution of reads mapping to host mRNAs for the same sample. length distributions of virus-derived reads from the 5 and 8 h p.i. RNASeq time points were different in shape (Fig 7B, right panel; grey lines, respectively) coronavirus DI RNAs are expected to include parts of the 5\u2032 end of the genome and a packaging signal. the excess 3\u2032 density may be a result of selective degradation (either natural or artifactual) of 96% of the input gRNA. studies of frameshifting using reporter constructs expressed in transfected cells or through in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs have indicated that the efficiency of the process in coronaviruses is generally in the region of 20\u201345%. the actual efficiency in the context of virus infection has not been previously determined. we measured the frameshifting efficiency at 5 h p.i., calculating values of 48% for repeat 1 and 70% for repeat 2 (Fig 8B). as the infection appeared to be more advanced in repeat 2, it is possible that the higher level measured (70%) is a consequence of depletion of the host cell protein synthesis resources. a well-studied coronavirus frameshifting signal from IBV served as a positive control. the MHV frameshifting efficiency was found to be 38% in 17Cl-1 and 45% in BHK-21 cells. the difference in the more advanced infection of repeat 2 likely due to non-specific effects. we prepared new libraries from the 5 h p.i. repeat 2 RiboSeq CHX samples using a larger gel slice (nominally 28\u201380 nt) however, even in these samples we failed to see noticeable pausing at the frameshift site. q counts in ORF1a were smoothed with a 3-nt running mean filter. blue triangles indicate selected sites of RPF accumulation in ORF1a. histograms show positions of the 5\u2032 ends of reads with a +12 nt offset. mRNAs have 5\u2032 ends mapping to codon position 1, with only 7% and 8% mapping to codon position 2. the reason for the deviation at the pause site is unknown but may be a result of \u201ctension\u201d within the mRNA or perturbation of the ribosome conformation. the nascent peptides at both pause sites lack the E- or P-site prolines or A-site GAA codons that are commonly associated with pausing. the nascent peptides at both pause sites lack the E- or P-site prolines or A-site GAA codons that are commonly associated with pausing. the reticulovesicular network is contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is the site of virus RNA synthesis. Nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 are integral membrane proteins whose topology has been determined in vitro for SARS-CoV and MHV. related domains (green), a hypervariable acidic domain (red), two papain-like cysteine proteinase domains (PLP1 and PLP2; blue), a poly (ADP-ribose) binding activity (ADRP) domain (orange), the recently described domain preceding Ubl2 and PLP2 (DPUP; fuchsia) [76], the nucleic-acid binding domain (NAB; salmon) the betacorona bosomal pausing assays of pPS0-nsp3 mutant mRNAs in RRL (20 min at 26\u00b0C) in each case, positively charged or aromatic amino acids were changed to alanine. mutant 5 contains six substitutions, thus mutant 5 contains six substitutions. ative pausing peptide was cloned into the influenza PB1 reporter gene. the nsp3 sequence within pPS0 includes five upstream positively charged amino acids (four Lys and one Arg) and one aromatic residue (Phe) that could potentially contribute to pausing. a complete time-course of pPS0-nsp3 Mut3 confirmed pausing. the 5\u2032 portion of the leader contains potential near-cognate non-AUG initiation codons. the most abundant RPF position corresponds to a GCG codon (genome coordinates 16\u201318); initiation at this point would generate a 12 amino acid peptide. reads whose 5\u2032 ends map to the first, second or third positions of codons relative to the reading frames of the two uORFs and ORF1a (which are all in phase) are indicated in purple, blue or orange, respectively. comparison of read length distributions of 5\u2032-end-of-leader RPFs (5\u2032 end of RPF maps at or 5\u2032 of genome coordinate 32) (orange), all virus RPFs (red) and host mRNA RPFs (green translation upstream of ORF1a is a single, short AUG-initiated uORF. it is present in 40% of mammalian mRNAs and has been shown to cause repression of translation of the downstream (main) ORF. at 5 h p.i. it appeared to be translated as efficiently as ORF1a. we compared mean ribosome profiles for host mRNAs with CDSs beginning with AUG-CCN with mean ribosome profiles for generic host mRNAs. the ratio of ribosome occupancy between the AUG and CCN averaged over host mRNAs. ribosomes paused during initiation have 5\u2032 ends that map predominantly to 12 or 13. translation 5\u2032 of other annotated ORFs Fig 13 shows histograms of RiboSeq (CHX and HAR) and RNASeq reads that map near to the 5\u2032 ends of HE, 4 and 5 ORFs. eq reads crossing the HE leader/body transcriptional discontinuity. leaky scanning on mRNA2 is unlikely to allow access to HE. reads whose 5\u2032 ends map to the first, second or third positions of codons. in MHV-A59 the natural ORF4 coding sequence is split by a frameshift mutation into a short 5\u2032 ORF4a and a longer 3\u2032 ORF4b. ribosomes initiating here would translate a 15-codon ORF resulting in the peptide MYSILIATWPRKRQS (assuming the initiating codon AUU is decoded as Met) mRNA5 TRS appears to be used only on this mRNA. the level of initiation at the CUG was comparable to that at the ORF5 AUG codon. translation of this short ORF might be used to shunt a proportion of ribosomes past the ORF5 AUG codon. a long internal ORF (I) is present within the N ORF of MHV and many other coronaviruses, encoding a largely hydrophobic polypeptide that is thought to confer a minor growth advantage to the virus. HAR profiling did not reveal an initiation spike for the I protein of MHV-A59, suggesting that it might not be expressed. both N protein (50 kDa) and I protein (23 kDa) were expressed from the synthetic N mRNA, with I produced at a level of about 2% of N. translation was at 26\u00b0C and samples were collected at the indicated times prior to separation on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. pcDNA.3 mRNA was translated in RRL and immunoprecipitated with specific anti-N, anti-I or anti-S sera. immunoprecipitated products were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and detected as above. in MHV-A59, an upstream AUG (bold) is present in the I frame followed by a stop codon (asterisk) prior to the \u201cdesignated\u201d I AUG codon. in some related virus sequences, the stop codon is replaced with a sense codon such that I is probably initiated from the upstream AUG. RiboSeq (HAR) and RNASeq (CHX only) libraries were prepared for each time point, deep sequenced and reads mapped to host and virus sequences. the composition of each library is summarised in S1A Table and S1 Fig. RiboSeq/RNASeq ratio was substantially lower in ORF1a and ORF1b than in the 3\u2032 coding ORFs. this ratio was substantially lower in ORF1a and ORF1b than in the 3\u2032 coding ORFs (except the defective genes HE and 4), which may indicate that a substantial proportion of genomic RNA is not being translated (e.g. sequestered in replication-transcription complexes or destined for packaging) the depth of RNASeq reads in the 5\u2032 UTR is similar to that of the N ORF. the major contribution to 5\u2032 leader sequence comes from mRNA7. elongating ribosomes have not yet cleared the S ORF. the extent of phasing can vary between protocols and libraries due, presumably, to variation in the efficiency of RNase I (or other nuclease) trimming. the RiboSeq libraries show excellent phasing with the majority of RPF 5\u2032 ends mapping to the first codon position. 'ends of RPFs derived from initiating ribosomes with the AUG codon in the ribosomal P-site are normally 12 nt. for many samples, a discrete peak was also observed 15 nt upstream of the stop codon. the presence of this peak appears to be subject to minor variation in sample preparation as it was not consistent between repeats. nt upstream of the AUG, along with a very low level of phasing within the CDS, likely represents a low level of contamination of RNASeq samples by RiboSeq samples. the latter could potentially be a result of codon usage bias, e.g. a preference for RNY codons [25], compounded with ligation biases. virus and host length distributions in the 5 h p.i. RiboSeq CHX sample were almost identical. however, the virus length distribution resembled the RiboSeq CHX 5 h p.i. length distribution. this suggests contamination of virus RPFs from the later time-point sample into the earlier time points. non-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes may co-sediment with ribosomes. such contamination may be revealed by unusually high read density in host mRNA 3\u2032 UTRs. a low level of 3\u2032 UTR occupancy derives from genuine RPFs. the 3\u2032 UTR RiboSeq read length distributions largely matched those of the CDSs (S9 Fig and S10 Fig, 1 and 8 h mock CHX) the host mRNA 3\u2032 UTR density for CHX samples was similar in magnitude (0.5\u20131.2%) to that of the mocks (0.7\u20130.9%), except for the 8 h p.i. time points where the 3\u2032 UTR density was 2.9\u20136.3% of the CDS density. virus positive-sense RiboSeq reads showed a similar or even tighter length distribution at late time points than the host RiboSeq reads. such reads comprised 4% of virus reads for all RiboSeq samples. virus translation as a fraction of total cellular translation increased 700 to 20,000-fold from 1 to 5 h p.i., while virus positive-sense RNA increased 80 to 200-fold over the same time period. positive-sense RNA fraction remained roughly constant (presumably reflecting the input RNA) negative-sense RNA fraction grew from negligible amounts to 0.1% of total virus RNA and host mRNA. at late time points, virus negative-sense RNA ceased to increase. positive-sense virus RNA had reached 80\u201390% of total virus RNA plus host mRNA. nsp9 westerns or 17% (for nsp9 westerns) SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using monoclonal anti-N, anti-S and anti-nsp9 sera. all viral proteins were detected with a green fluorescent secondary antibody, and GAPDH with a red fluorescent secondary antibody. initiation and termination peaks were excluded from the RiboSeq density calculations. Raw RNASeq densities represent the cumulative sum of densities for all mRNAs that cover a given genome region. values for 1 h p.i. and 2.5 h p.i. RiboSeq, and 1 h p.i. repeat 1 RiboSeq should be considered as upper bounds and the 1 h p.i. repeat 1 RiboSeq values have been omitted. gRNA translation efficiency was low even at 2.5 h p.i. (repeat 2, ORF1a translational efficiency 0.11). analysis of RNASeq sequences can be calculated from the decumulated RNASeq densities (as above) or independently, from the relative abundances of RNASeq reads spanning each leader/body junction site. Fig 5 compares mRNA abundances estimated using these methods. a variable number of tandem copies (two in MHV-A59) of UCUAA are present at the leader junction site. an imperfect copy of UCUAA precedes the canonical UCUAAAC at several body junction sites. the greater usage for mRNA6 is likely due to an imperfect pentanucleotide UCCAA at the canonical site but a perfect pentanucleotide UCUAA 5 nt upstream. the first nucleotide could be templated either by the body sequence (i.e. 'C'; 40%) or by the leader sequence (i.e. 'U'; 60%) the most frequent were present at 20% the level of leader/body chimeric reads for mRNA2. an HE mRNA has not been observed for MHV-JHM. this is likely due to the greater deviation from the consensus TRS, UCUAAAC, in this strain. the levels are extremely low\u2014just 3.6\u20134.6% those of mRNA2 (the least abundant canonical mRNA) a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 decreasing gradient in RPF density is visible within ORF1a in the RiboSeq CHX density profile. a clear trough in RPF density is visible after the ORF1a initiation peak, followed by higher density further downstream in ORF1a. the trough reflects run-off of elongating ribosomes in the three minutes between addition of HAR and CHX. MHV RNA synthesis and translation at an early time point. despite the very high MOI, virus RNA levels were low. despite the very high MOI, virus RNA levels were low. negative-sense RNA is present at >0.1% of positive-sense RNA at 2.5, 5 and 8 h p.i. negative-sense reads mapping to the N region also argues against this phenomenon being a result of early synthesis. the absence of equivalent RNASeq density in the leader region argues against this phenomenon being a result of early synthesis. the N ORF translation efficiency (normalized to total virus RNA and host mRNA) was calculated to be only 0.0005 compared to values in the range 1.1 to 1.7 at the 2.5, 5 and 8 h p.i. timepoints. the early timepoint N ORF RNA revealed by RNASeq is not translated. frameshifting efficiencies estimated from the ratio of RiboSeq density in ORF1b to that in ORF1a (red) same calculation was done for RNASeq (green) for comparison, same calculation was done for RNASeq (red) the MHV frameshifting efficiency was found to be 38% in 17 years. the MHV frameshifting efficiency was found to be 38% in 17 years. elongation factors could decrease the density of ribosomes in ORF1a. l-1 and 45% in BHK-21 cells, and similar in both instances to that of IBV. data suggest that frameshifting in coronaviruses is not specifically modulated by virus infection, with the difference seen in the more advanced infection of repeat 2 likely due to the non-specific effects mentioned above. we compared the distribution of variability in RiboSeq and RNASeq densities within ORF1a. the extra variability presumed to be a result of fluctuations in ribosome progressivity. we compared the distribution of variability in RiboSeq and RNASeq densities. the 3\u2032 pause corresponds to reads with 5\u2032 ends mapping to genomic coordinate 11366. the positions of the 5\u2032 ends of reads at the 5\u2032 pause site differ by 5 nt between the two repeats. read lengths of 28\u201329 and 29\u201330 nt are within the typical range for the respective samples. the lengths of the most abundant reads are more consistent with reads being 1 nt shorter than normal at the 5\u2032 end, rather than 2 nt longer. the nascent peptide sequence (i.e. peptide sequence within the ribosome exit tunnel that could potentially affect pausing) extra 5 nt at the 5\u2032 end are partially protected, resisting trimming in repeat 2 but not in the more stringently trimmed repeat 1. nascent peptides at both pause sites lack the E- or P-site prolines or A-site GAA codons that are commonly associated with pausing. nsp3 is the largest protein encoded in MHV replicase gene. contains two small ubiquitin-like domains (Ubl1 and Ubl2), two papain-like cysteine proteinase domains (PLP1 and PLP2), a poly-ADP-ribose-binding activity (ADRP) domain (orange) and the recently described domain preceding Ubl2 and PLP2 (DPUP; fuchs the site of ribosomal pausing, DVKFVTNAC (P-site at pause underlined) is indicated. time course of translation of pcDNA.3 mRNA, containing sequence coding for nsp3* (first 1,125 residues excluding NAB, G2M, TM and Y domains) in RRL. nsp3 pause in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) translations using edeine assays. cDNA fragment comprising first 1,125 residues of nsp3 (nsp3*; excluding the NAB, G2M, TM and Y domains) was cloned into pcDNA3.1. a control mRNA in which a UAA stop codon had been introduced at the pa pausing was obviated in Mut 3, Mut 4 and Mut 5 mutants. pPS0-nsp3 mutants were mutated to alanine sequentially and incrementally. a complete time-course of pPS0-nsp3 Mut3 confirmed the lack of pausing. the 5\u2032 portion of the leader contains a number of potential non-AUG initiation codons. the most abundant RPF position corresponds to a GCG codon (genome coordinates 16\u201318); initiation at this point would generate a 12 amino acid peptide. reads were mapped to mRNA7 instead of the MHV genome. the 5\u2032 region of mRNA7 are shown. a similar pattern of reads in the 5\u2032 part of the leader but also a larger peak on a UUG codon close to the 3\u2032 end of the leader sequence. translation upstream of ORF1a Downstream of the leader TRS but upstream of ORF1a is a single, short AUG-initiated uORF that is present in many coronaviruses. upstream ORFs are present in 40% of mammalian mRNAs and have been shown generally to cause repression of translation of the downstream (main) ORF. ribosomes tend to pause more at the second codon in the former. the ratio of ribosome occupancy between the AUG and CCN averaged over host mRNAs was less extreme than is the case for the virus uORF. the HE ORF is disrupted by a premature termination codon. the TRS upstream of HE in MHV-A59 is defective. ribosomes were observed to initiate at the authentic HE AUG codon. reads whose 5\u2032 ends map to the first, second or third positions of codons relative to the reading frame of the main annotated ORF. reads whose 5\u2032 ends map to the first, second or third positions of codons relative to the reading frame of the main annotated ORF are indicated in purple, blue or orange, respectively. upstream of ORF4a, but downstream of the mRNA TRS junction, a low level of initiation appeared to occur on an AUU codon. initiation here would result in translation of the last 13 codons of ORF4 with peptide sequence MVVHILLRHCPGI (assuming the initiating codon is decoded as Met) the presence of an upstream CUG-initiated short ORF is preserved in other strains of MHV. the presence of an upstream CUG-initiated short ORF is preserved in other strains of MHV. the presence of an upstream CUG-initiated short ORF is preserved in other strains of MHV. expression of E (but not protein 5) can occur from artificial reporters. presence of the CUG-initiated uORF could simply be to downregulate production of protein 5. reads whose 5\u2032 ends map to the first, second or third positions of codons relative to the N ORF are indicated in purple, blue or orange. the I ORF is in the +1 reading frame relative to the N ORF. a comparison of the phasing of RPFs revealed in the former a slight excess of RPFs with 5\u2032 ends mapping to the second position of N-frame codons. the excess is consistent with 6\u201312% of ribosomes translating the +1 (i.e. I) reading frame in this region. ribosome profiling is used to investigate virus gene expression kinetics, relative translational efficiencies, ribosome pausing, and uORF translation in cells infected with MHV. these studies provide the highest resolution data on coronavirus translation to date. ribosome profiling may have been derived from two sources. an increased 3\u2032 UTR RiboSeq (CHX) density was not apparent until 8 h p.i. an increased 3\u2032 UTR occupancy was as much due to bona fide RPFs as contaminating RNPs. the former could be due to depletion of ribosome recycling factors. negative-sense RNA levels rose from undetectable to 0.1% of total virus RNA and host mRNA. despite differences in abundance, the patterns of expression of positive and negative-sense RNAs were similar, including high densities in the leader region. the pp1a and pp1b ORFs on the gRNA are inherently poorly translatable, e.g. due to translation of the uORF inhibiting ribosomal access to ORF1a. the gRNA pool may be sequestered in replication-transcription complexes. the absence of similar amounts of RNASeq reads suggests that the N ORF RNA does not correspond to bona fide mRNA7. the N ORF RNA observed in our study may represent a part of a defective viral genome with some structural similarity to DI-like RNAs. translation of this uORF occurred at a level similar to that of ORF1a. other translated uORFs included a UUG-initiated 1-codon ORF in the leader sequence, an AUU-initiated 15-codon ORF upstream of ORF4a, and a CUG-initiated 13-codon ORF upstream of ORF5. the function, if any, of the first two is unknown. the mechanism of I expression is uncertain, but leaky scanning of ribosomes that fail to initiate at the N AUG is a possibility. failure to detect I ORF initiation (and weak detection of E ORF initiation) may indicate a shortcoming of the ribosomal profiling technique in the detection of initiation codons accessed by non-standard mechanisms. ribosomal profiling is insufficiently sensitive to register pseudoknot-induced ribosomal pauses of short duration. only relatively few studies have addressed whether RiboSeq pauses can be generally correlated with intra-mRNA structure. nsp3 pausing site is located in linker region between two modular domains of the protein. q, the datasets provide a high-resolution examination of MHV replication and gene expression. they provide a basis for the subsequent analyses of virus-host responses. the information will also be valuable to researchers with an interest in translation and virology. 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, the dishes were submerged in a reservoir of liquid nitrogen for 10 s. then transferred to dry ice and 400 l of lysis buffer. the cells were scraped extensively to ensure lysis. reads shorter than 25 nt were discarded using the FASTX-Toolkit. reads were mapped first to Mus musculus rRNA, followed by the MHV genome and subsequently Mus musculus mRNA, ncRNA and genomic DNA databases. reads that could be mapped to multiple transcripts were assigned at random to one transcript. mRNA RiboSeq and RNASeq phasing distributions were excluded from the analyses. read length distributions are based on total mapped reads. the presence of transcript isoforms with 3\u2032 UTRs shorter than the annotated (300 nt) 3\u2032 UTRs leads to a modest underestimation of the actual 3\u2032 UTR density. mRNAs with annotated CDS 300 nucleotides in length and annotated 5\u2032 UTRs 30 nt in length were used. plots showing reads summed over large numbers of host mRNAs show histograms of the positions to which the 5\u2032 ends of reads map. a +12 nt offset means that RPFs whose 5\u2032 end aligns to the first position of a codon are mapped to the first nucleotide of the codon preceding the P-site codon. reads whose 5\u2032 end offset by +12 nt (i.e. estimated P-site positions for RPFs) mapped within regions 361 to 13452 (for ORF1a) and 13774 to 21596 (for ORF1b) read counts were divided by region lengths to obtain read densities. s of the N and I ORFs are 29670 to 31034 (N) and 29734 to 30357 (I) reads whose 5\u2032 end mapped between nt 211 and nt 13572 (the start of ORF1a) were excluded. reads with discontiguous mappings to the MHV genome were excluded. libraries with longer reads will have proportionally more reads found to span leader/body discontinuities due to the requirement of at least 17 nt 3\u2032 of the 11-nt query sequence for selection. for this reason, inter-library comparisons are avoided. reads were mapped to the mouse genome (UCSC, assembly mm10) using topHat. pDluc-IBV and pDluc-HXB2 were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (+) in pPS0 plasmids. pPS0-nsp3 mutants were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. a stop codon was introduced to generate a protein whose size corresponded to that produced by the predicted ribosomal pause. all sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing in tissue culture 17 Cl-1 and BHK-21 cells. polyclonal rabbit anti-I (1:1,000, a kind gift of Prof. P. S. Masters), incubated in the dark with an IRDye-conjugated secondary antibody in PBST. RNAs were recovered by a single extraction with phenol-chloroform (1:1 vol/vol) followed by ethanol precipitation. a typical reaction mixture had a volume of 10 l. reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 26\u00b0C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 10 mM EDTA, 100 g/ml RNase A followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. edeine was added 3 min after the start of the reaction to obtain synchronous initiation (final concentration, 5 M) cells were infected with MHV-A59 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 PFU/cell (or 200 PFU/cell in the \u201cHigh MOI\u201d experiment) after 45 min at 37\u00b0C, the inoculum was removed and the cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C until harvest. the methodologies employed were based on the original protocols of Ingolia and colleagues [7, 114], except ribosomal RNA contamination was removed by treatment with duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) the methods used were as described [16], with minor modifications for the analysis of ribosomal pausing at the MHV 1 PRF signal. non-coding RNA and genomic DNA databases comprised the Ensembl Mus_musculus.NCBIM37.64.ncrna.fa and release-64 DNA chromosome files. reads that map to the gDNA are expected to derive from unannotated transcripts as the sequencing protocol is RNA-specific. reads mapping to mRNAs with annotated CDSs 450 nt in length and annotated 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs 60 nt in length. all figures are based on total numbers of mapped reads, rather than weighted sums for highly expressed mRNAs. read length distributions are based on total mapped reads without restriction to annotated coding regions. transcripts with 20 RPFs with 5\u2032 ends mapping between 30 and +15 relative to annotated initiation codon were used. histograms of 5\u2032 end positions for individual transcripts were down-weighted by the number of RPFs mapping to this region before summing over different transcripts. plots showing reads summed over large numbers of host mRNAs. the host mRNA plots are used for calibration. the virus plots are used to illustrate specific features of virus gene expression. the same library normalization factors were also used for Fig 3, S4 Fig and S6 Fig. +12 nt mapped within regions 361 to 13452 (for ORF1a) and 13774 to 21596 (for ORF1b) these coordinates leave a 150 nt buffer after the ORF1a initiation codon (nt 211), before the frameshift site (nt 13602), before the ORF1a termination codon (nt 13623) and before the ORF1b termination codon (nt 21746) read counts were divided by region reads were selected that had at least 17 nt 3\u2032 of the query sequence. libraries with longer reads will have proportionally more reads found to span leader/body discontinuities due to the requirement of at least 17 nt 3\u2032 of the 11-nt query sequence. read counts were normalized for library size as above, and for CDS length according to the sum of all coding exon lengths for a given gene ID in the genes.gtf file. this will tend to result in an overestimate of CDS lengths since many transcripts will lack some coding exons. lII restriction sites were derived by PCR amplification. pDluc-IBV and pDluc-HXB2 were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (+) pPS0 mutants were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. immunoblotting Proteins were separated by 10%, 12% or 15% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the protein of interest and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were incubated in the dark with an IRDye-conjugated secondary antibody in PBST [IRDye 800CW Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L), IRDye 800CW Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) and a RNAs were recovered by a single extraction with phenol-chloroform (1:1 vol/vol) followed by ethanol precipitation. the eluate was concentrated by ethanol precipitation, the mRNA resuspended in water. a typical reaction mixture had a volume of 10 l and was composed of 90% (vol/vol) RRL, 20 M amino acids (lacking methionine), and 0.2 MBq [35S]-methionine samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE by addition of 10 volumes of 2X Laemmli\u2019s sample buffer and boiling for 4 min. proteins resolved on 10% or 15% SDS-PAGE gels. 14C-labelled molecular weight standards (MW) were from Amersham International (United Kingdom) the number of junction/body chimeric reads containing each sequence are given in column 6 (repeat 1) and column 7 (repeat 2). only sequences with three or more occurrences in repeat 1 and ten or more occurrences in repeat 2 are shown. reads were mapped to virus RNA, and host rRNA, mRNA, ncRNA and gDNA databases. reads whose 5\u2032 ends map to the first, second or third positions of codons are indicated in purple, blue or orange, respectively. reads whose 5\u2032 ends map to the first, second or third positions of codons are indicated in purple, blue or orange, respectively. termination occurs with the stop codon (UNN at position 2 to 0; right) in the A-site so that the 5\u2032 ends of RPFs paused during termination normally map to position 17 (15 nt upstream) histograms are normalized by the sum of total virus RNA (positive and negative-sense) plus total host mRNA for the library. reads were counted in windows from 10 to 100 codons upstream (CDS; green) or downstream (3\u2032 UTR; orange) of annotated termination codons, and summed over all host mRNAs. the left panel in each pair shows the absolute read counts, allowing comparison of the CDS and 3\u2032 UTR read densities. for all RiboSeq samples, 3\u2032 UTR occupancy is very low compared to CDS occupancy. unfractionated RNA prepared for repeat 2 was re-run on a 15% denaturing acrylamide-urea gel and a larger gel slice taken to sample RPFs within the range 28 to 80 nt. the vast majority of RPFs fall in the size range 25\u201335 nt."}
