{"summary": "background expression of the minor virion structural protein VP2 of the calicivirus murine norovirus (MNV) is believed to occur by the unusual mechanism of termination codon-dependent reinitiation of translation. a proportion of 40S subunits remain associated with the mRNA and reinitiate at the AUG of a downstream ORF. a 5\u2032-end-dependent process begins with recognition of the cap structure by the cap-binding complex eIF4F [1] and recognition of the AUG codon of the first open reading frame (ORF) on the mRNA by the scanning ribosome complex [2]. a number of unconventional translation strategies have been described [3]. the stop codon of the major capsid stop-start protein VP1 overlaps the start codon of the minor capsid protein VP2 ( AUG A ). a stretch of 70\u201380 nucleotides (nt) of mRNA upstream of the stop-start window is needed. a short sequence of the TURBS (termed Motif 1) that is complementary to part of helix 26 of 18S rRNA likely acts to tether the 40S in this paper, we describe an analysis of termination-reinitiation in the expression of the VP2 protein of murine norovirus (MNV), a calicivirus of the genus norovirus. the VP2 start codon (AUG) of MNV overlaps the stop codon of the upstream VP1 ORF in the pentanucleotide UAA UG. a stretch of bases complementary to 18S rRNA helix 26 is present upstream the cloned fragment contained 203 bp of sequence information upstream of the UAA UG stop-start window. the cDNA fragment was cloned in such a way that the Renilla and Firefly luciferase ORFs were in frame with the stop and start codons respectively of the termination-reinitiation motif. this vector, named p2luc-MNVwt, contains a T7 RNA polymerase promoter allowing the product of the full-length or truncated versions of the rlucVP1 ORF is marked rluc. the VP2fluc product is the shortest (predicted size, 33 kDa) the shortest (predicted size, 33 kDa) is marked fluc. translation products from mRNAs derived from p2luc-MNVwt were linearised at different points within the second ORF. termination-reinitiation is distinct from IRES-mediated expression of downstream ORFs as translation through the upstream ORF is an absolute requirement [11], [14], [16]. a premature stop-codon was inserted close to the end of the rluc ORF but upstream of VP1 sequence information. deletion to 37 nt or less abolished expression of termination-reinitiation product. only 40 nucleotides of VP1 primary sequence immediately upstream of the stop-start window are required for termination-reinitiation in vitro. mutant where pairing was predicted to be maintained (p2luc-MNV GU) termination-reinitiation was clearly detectable, although the efficiency was reduced somewhat compared to that of wild-type mRNA. analysis of role of the complementary region (Motif 1) in termination-reinitiation. a bacteriophage promoter was inserted upstream of the viral sequence of the p2luc-MNV.61 plasmid. the plasmid was linearised with BamHI, T3 run-off transcripts synthesised and the RNA end-labelled with [33P]-ATP. the labelled transcripts were subjected to limited chemical and enzymatic probing prior to analysis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. chemical structure probing was with imidazole (I, hours) or lead acetate (pb; mM concentration in reaction) the water lane represents RNA which was dissolved in water, incubated for four hours and processed in parallel to the imidazole-treated sample. the sequence of the probed RNA and the inferred secondary structure is shown in Figure 4. structure probing analysis of the MNV signal revealed that the mRNA in the region essential for termination-reinitiation is not highly structured. this was especially evident from the chemical probes, with most residues sensitive to imidazole and lead cleavage. the enzymatic probes were also active against the majority of bases in the region. toeprinting of ribosomes paused at initiation codons has shown that the 5\u2032 edge of the terminating ribosome is 12 to 13 nt from the first base of the AUG [21] a terminating ribosome would prevent formation of the secondary structure, conceivably releasing the 18S rRNA complementary region for interaction with the ribosome. there is considerable sensitivity to RNase T1 cleavage within the 5\u2032 arm of stem 2\u2032. the effect of moving the Stop Codon of rlucVP1 further downstream of the Start Codon of VP2fluc Efficient termination-reinitiation seems to require the close proximity of the stop and start codons [12], [14], [19]. the authentic stop codon of rlucVP1 was mutated from UAA to CAA such that the first ORF was extended termination-reinitiation motif reduces reinitiation irrespective of whether the stop or start codon is eliminated. reinitiation was reduced to 8\u201338% of the wild-type level, with reinitiation reduced to 25\u201349% of the wild-type level. in mNV49.8, termination occurred 30 amino acids downstream. a significant proportion of ribosomes terminate 13 amino acids downstream of the authentic stop-start site can reinitiate in an AUG-independent manner. the effect of moving the stop codon of the termination-reinitiation window further downstream on the mRNA. a series of plasmid constructs were prepared, based on MNV.49. the longer product observed in the 49.8 translation is asterisked. the sensitivity of FCV VP2 protein expression to the translation initiation inhibitor edeine suggests that the termination-reinitiation process bears at least some similarity to standard initiation at AUG codons. edeine is present prior to arrival of ribosomes at the stop-start signal. it greatly inhibits termination-reinitiation, but has little effect on translation post-reinitiation. mRNAs containing the termination reinitiation signals were translated in Flexi\u00ae RRL at a final RNA concentration of 50 g/ml in. Identical experiments were performed in which cycloheximide replaced edeine. in all cases, no termination-reinitiation product was evident until the 7.5 min time point, when only a trace was visible. a 255 bp fragment of viral cDNA was cloned between the SalI and BamHI sites of the dual-luciferase reporter vector p2luc [20] p2luc-MNVwt contains a T7 RNA polymerase promoter allowing synthetic mRNAs to be generated to investigate stop-start process in in vitro translation reactions. the termination-reinitiation region was cloned into the SalI and BamHI sites of the p2luc reporter plasmid. the MNV ps rluc product is the shortest (predicted size, 33 kDa) the figure in brackets represents the ratio of the intensity of the fluc and rluc products (adjusted for methionine content and expressed as a percentage) for the MNVwt mRNA. deletions of increasing size were made from the 5\u2032 end of the inserted viral information. deletion to 37 nt or less abolished expression of the termination-reinitiation product. deletions of increasing size were made from the 5\u2032 end of the inserted viral information. termination-reinitiation requires a closely conserved primary sequence element (referred to as Motif 1) that is complementary to a region of helix 26 of 18S rRNA [11]\u2013[12], [14]. this sequence is essential for the stop-start process [12]\u2013[14], [18]\u2013[19]. two point mutations were made to disrupt potential mRNA:rRNA pairs. a bacteriophage T3 promoter was inserted upstream of the viral sequence of the p2luc-MNV.61 plasmid (Figure 1b) the plasmid was linearised with BamHI, T3 run-off transcripts synthesised and the RNA end-labelled with [33P]-ATP. the chemical probes used were imidazole and lead acetate. structure probing was with RNases T1, U2 and CL3 which preferentially cleave single-stranded G, A and C residues respectively. RNA derived by transcription of p2luc-MNV-T3/BamHI with T3 RNA polymerase was 5\u2032 end-labelled with [-33P]-ATP and subjected to limited RNase or chemical cleavage. the sensitivity of bases in the MNV termination-reinitiation region is shown. the first base of the transcript is numbered 1. the reactivies of the VP1 stop codon are marked. the size of the symbols is approximately proportional to the intensity of cleavage at that site. the most stable RNA fold was the bulged stem-loop shown in Figure 4. however, the correspondence between this mfold and the mapping data was not absolute. the single-stranded probes showed more activity against regions predicted to be single-stranded than they did against predicted helices. a terminating ribosome would prevent formation of the secondary structure. a terminating ribosome would release the 18S rRNA complementary region. this could promote 18S rRNA binding and ribosome tethering. a possible explanation for this lies in the fact that the \u201cnew\u201d stop codon is itself embedded within a second potential stop-start sequence (UGAUG) which could facilitate some reinitiation, but perhaps at a lower frequency, as it would not necessarily be spaced appropriately with respect to Motif 1. a significant proportion of ribosomes that terminate 13 amino acids downstream of the authentic stop-start site can reinitiate in an AUG-independent manner. in this mRNA, a significant proportion of ribosomes that terminate 13 amino acids downstream of the authentic stop-start site can reinitiate in an AUG-independent manner within the stop-start window. pMNVwt is a fully functional, truncated version of pMNVwt. in which the stop and start codons of the termination-reinitiation signal were altered. the figure shows the primary sequence and three-frame translation of the relevant region of the mRNA encoded. the effect of the peptide on the activity of the MNV and BM2 signals (with FCV as a control) using translation time-courses. the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide replaced edeine. in the edeine experiments, the vast majority of ribosomes did not reach the stop-start window until at least 7.5 minutes had passed. in all cases, the frequency of termination-reinitiation at early time points was higher than that seen at the steady state. this is indicative of a titration effect; early in the time course, when fewer ribosomes have loaded onto the mRNA, the greater frequency of reinitiation may reflect the increased relative abundance of a necessary factor. the molecular basis of the resistance seen with the MNV signal is difficult to explain. reinitiation product was evident until the 7.5 min time point, when only a trace was visible. the relative levels of the rluc and fluc bands was determined by densitometry. in panel D, the Rluc/Fluc ratio is plotted against the time of edeine addition for the three mRNAs. a comparative alignment of the MNV signal with other known or suspected termination-reinitiation signals reveals that Motif 1 is always present and that the stop and start codons of the termination-reinitiation site are in close proximity to each other. it is not clear whether the \u201cadditional\u201d sequences present in viruses with longer TURBS have a role in termination-reinitiation. the formation of this stem is likely to be important to termination-reinitiation in the BM2 and MNV systems. it is noticeable that deletions that would affect formation of stem 2 showed reduced activity in termination-reinitiation. the termination-reinitiation signal of influenza BM2 is also shown. mfold analysis of the MNV region present locally upstream of the terminating ribosome does suggest an alternative secondary structure. the requirement for translation through the TURBS may simply reflect the need to deliver ribosomes to the stop-start window. but it could also indicate a requirement to remodel the TURBS. eIF1 and eIF1A are thought to play important roles in locating and correct recognition of the AUG start codon. edeine does not inhibit binding of the eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi ternary complex to the 40S ribosomal subunit, nor Met-tRNAi/40S complex scanning, but there is a complete failure of AUG codon recognition. no obvious conventional frameshift signals are present in the region of overlap between the two ORFs [26]\u2013[27]. it could also represent the outcome of a failed attempt to terminate and subsequent resumption of translation by ribosomes on the downstream ORF. mutagenesis to introduce insertions longer than 6 bp was performed in two steps. plasmids were linearised with HpaI and capped run-off transcripts. messenger RNAs were recovered by a single extraction with phenol/chloroform (11 v/v) followed by ethanol precipitation. samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE by the addition of 10 volumes of 2X Laemmli's sample buffer [31]. the relative abundance of products on the gels was determined by direct measurement of [35S]methionine incorporation using a Packard Instant Imager 2024. RNA structure mapping was prepared by in vitro transcription of BamHI-digested p2luc-MNV-T3 using T3 RNA polymerase. plasmids pT7:MNV and pSG-2/3* were digested with SalI and BamHI. sequences were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. mutagenesis was performed using the Quikchange II site-directed mutagenesis kit. mRNAs were translated in Flexi\u00ae rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Flexi\u00aeRRL, Promega) programmed with 50 g/ml template mRNA. reactions were composed of 60% (v/v) Flexi\u00aeRRL, 20 M amino acids (lacking methionine), 500 M MgOAc, 2 mM DTT, 5U RNAse inhibitor (RNAguard, GE Healthcare Life Sciences), 130 mM-160 HI-digested p2luc-MNV-T3 using T3 RNA polymerase. all probing reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 l."}
