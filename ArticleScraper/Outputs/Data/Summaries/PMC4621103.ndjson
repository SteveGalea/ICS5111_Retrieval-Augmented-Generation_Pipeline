{"summary": "cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are responsible for identifying incoming transmission/founder (T/F) genomes and/or their products as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) the PAMP/PRR interaction then induces signaling of cell-intrinsic innate immunity, resulting in an antiviral state within the infected cell and the production of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines. the importance of this pathway in determining the outcome of viral infection is demonstrated by the variety of viral antagonists shown to interfere with RIG-I- and MAVS-dependent signaling. careful discrimination between self and nonself molecular patterns is essential to prevent triggering of an innate immune response to the host. this pU/UC motif is approximately 100 nucleotides (nt) in length and is essential for viral replication (37\u201339) significant variability in the pU/UC sequence and in the length of poly-uridine stretches is observed (2). the presence and location of the pU/UC motif in the 3\u2032 UTR of HCV are highly conserved. in a study of normal human plasma donors who were infected with HCV as a result of either mucosal or intravenous exposure, the numbers of T/F viruses leading to productive infection ranged from 1 to more than 30. more-recent studies in HIV-1-positive men found a lower number (median of 1) of T/F genomes. a total of 7 unique full-length T/F genomes were inferred on the basis of SGS analyses of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR. the sequences of these T/F genomes were unambiguous because, in each case, the plasma vRNA/cDNA sequences conform to a model of random variation from which a coalescent T/F genome could be inferred. we hypothesized that variation within these pU/UC sequences would impart differential recognition by RIG-I and that those variants with a shorter U-core length would evade RIG-I interactions and signaling. sequences with longer pU/UC tracts representing authentic T/F virus variants should be recognized by RIG-I and result in robust innate immune stimulation in human hepatoma cells. the hepatitis C virus (HCV) used in these studies was a cell culture-adapted variant that was produced from the synthetic JFH-1 HCV 2a infectious clone as previously described. Plasmids encoded the full sequences of transmitted/founder viruses. RNAs for the HCV T/F pU/UC regions were synthesized from promoter-linked PCR products derived from plasmids encoding full-length T/F virus sequences. the amplified PCR product was purified by agarose gel extraction using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Various amounts of purified recombinant full-length RIG-I protein were mixed with 6 pmol RNA and 10 l ATPase reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 1.5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) RNA was visualized using agarose gel (Tris-acetate-EDTA; pH 7.2) the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. ATP (NEB) was added to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 1 mM. the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. reaction products were analyzed using SDS-PAGE Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and visualization with QC colloidal Coomassie stain (Bio-Rad) the signal intensity of the band representing the repressor domain (RD) was quantified. the results are represented as percentages of the signal intensity of Con1-treated protein. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. one-step real-time quantitative PCR was performed using an iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit. the copy number was calculated by comparison to a standard curve of in vitro-transcribed full-length HCV RNA. each pU/UC RNA was assigned an \u201cactivity rank\u201d based on the EC50 values determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ATPase assay. the hepatitis C virus (HCV) used in these studies was a cell culture-adapted variant that was produced from the synthetic JFH-1 HCV 2a infectious clone as previously described. pJFH-1 (47, 48) has been previously described. RNAs for the HCV T/F pU/UC regions were synthesized from promoter-linked PCR products derived from plasmids encoding full-length T/F virus sequences. the amplified PCR product was purified by agarose gel extraction using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

ATP (NEB) was added to the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 1 mM. the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (1 mg/ml) was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. reaction products were analyzed using SDS-PAGE Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and visualization with QC colloidal Coomassie stain (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. one-step real-time quantitative PCR was performed using an iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit. the copy number was calculated by comparison to a standard curve of in vitro-transcribed full-length HCV RNA. each pU/UC RNA was assigned an \u201cactivity rank\u201d based on the EC50 values determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ATPase assay. the sequences of the pU/UC regions of these genomes are shown in Table 1. the sequences are labeled with patient identifiers (A to F) and with numbers indicating unique pU/UC motifs. the pU/UC variant genomes within all of the patients were identical except for the pU/UC sequence. sequences representing each T/F isolate ranged in length from 23 to 49 nt. in vitro U-core variants ranged in length from 13 to 18 nucleotides. 132 GGCCAUUUCUG U14 GUUUCCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU recombinant human RIG-I protein was incubated with purified RNA and subjected to nondenaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. the positive-control pU/UC RNA from the HCV Con1 genome formed a stable complex with increasing amounts of RIG-I. however, reaction of RIG-I with 5\u2032ppp RNA representing the 100-nt X region (X RNA) did not form a complex with RIG-I 1 control included C2 and D1, which contain the longest U cores of the T/F RNAs. those sequences with limited binding by RIG-I (E4 and F1) contain short U cores. pU/UC-induced ATPase activity and conformational changes of RIG-I following binding to pU/UC RNAs. CARDs are bound to the C-terminal repressor domain (RD) and the helicase insertion domain (Hel2i) through inhibitory interaction (8, 50, 51). Upon recognition of and binding to RNA, RIG-I undergoes an ATPase-driven conformational change to bring the RNA into close contact with the helicase domains. we conducted limited trypsin proteolysis of RIG-I/RNA complexes. a qualitative assessment of RIG-I RD accumulation supports the idea of differential recognition and binding of RIG-I to the T/F pU/UC motifs. this observation indicates that RIG-I is capable of recognizing all pU/UC RNA motifs but does so with RNA binding affinity that promotes differential ATPase activity. however, RIG-I binding and recognition of T/F pU/UC RNA motif are not uniform. fected each RNA into Huh7 hepatoma cells and assessed their ability to trigger innate immune activation. this included activation/phosphorylation of IRF3 and induction of IRF3 target genes (IFIT1 and IFN-), ISGs (IFIT1, MX1, and RIG-I) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- and IL-6) pU/UC RNAs were harvested 18 h later for immunoblot analysis (A and B) or RT-PCR assay (C and D) it remains possible that some level of innate immune signaling could occur through pathways other than RIG-I, such as toll-like receptor 2 (TLR3), TLR7, or melanoma differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA5) pathways. molar amounts of each T/F pU/UC variant, Con1 pU/UC, and X RNA control were transfected into cells and followed 18 h later by HCV infection (JFH1 strain; multiplicity of infection, 1.0) at 48 h postinfection, we measured cell-associated viral RNA levels and quantified infectious virus released into the supernatant using a sensitive focus-forming-unit assay. cells were harvested 48 h postinfection, and viral RNA was quantified by a qPCR assay. supernatant from infected cells was isolated and infectious virus measured by focus-forming-unit (ffu) assay. pU/UC stimulatory activity correlates with U composition and length of the U core. U core significantly correlated with PAMP activity to bind RIG-I and trigger innate immune signaling that restricts HCV infection. only characteristic correlated with activity was U-core length, suggesting that the U core is a defining feature recognized by RIG-I. each pU/UC RNA was assigned an activity rank based on the level of RIG-I activation measured in biochemical assays. the innate immune response elicited in vitro was then calculated for all RNAs with an activity score based on the variable characteristics. single-patient variants with differential U-core lengths were included in our analysis to determine how U-core length influences the PAMP activity of T/F variants. we previously defined the pU/UC motif as containing three distinct regions, the U core and its flanking 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 arms. pU/UC motifs in our sequences ranged overall from 100 to 178 nt in length.

F pU/UC RNA motif was capable of stimulating RIG-I ATPase activity at a level in a range between those seen with the Con1 and X RNA controls. differences in the respective picomolar EC50 and EC90 values corresponding to the pU/UC RNA required for ATPase activity induction ranging from 3-fold to over 17-fold. pU/UC RNA conducted limited trypsin proteolysis of RIG-I/RNA complexes. RIG-I changes to a conformation that protects the 17-kDa RD from trypsin digestion. we found that the RIG-I signaling conformational changes were differentially induced by T/F pU/UC RNA. recognition of HCV T/F RNA could result in innate immune stimulation with differential abilities to control infection. results of densitometric analysis of RD accumulation as percentage of accumulation following incubation with Con1 pU/UC RNA are shown in the table at bottom of the figure. sequences C2 and D1 strongly induced IFN- transcription as expected based on their ability to bind RIG-I and induce RIG-I ATPase activity and conformational change. transfection with other stimulatory T/F pU/UC RNAs resulted in low levels of ISG protein and gene expression above those seen with X RNA but below those seen with Con1 pU/UC or other stimulatory T/F RNAs. we assessed signaling of T/F pU/UC RNA in Huh7.5 cells. these cells lack functional RIG-I but retain TLR and MDA5 signaling. innate immune response from T/F pU/UC RNA is mediated by RIG-I. pU/UC RNAs with no or low signaling activity restricted only partially or failed to restrict HCV infection. modest inhibition of replication was observed in cells treated with T/F pU/UC variants shown to be mildly stimulatory (A2, D2, E2 and F2) the level of stimulatory activity of an RNA was determined by the sum of the assigned activity ranks from all of the assays presented in this study. we then conducted statistical analysis based on two-tailed Spearman nonparametric correlation to identify determinants of PAMP activity among the pU/UC variants. ding Conformational change ATPase activity Immunity Activation rank Con1 34 1 1 1 4 2 1 A1* 33 6 3 11 6 4 5 A2-V 18 14 2 6 12 6 8 B1* 24 9 12 12 7 5 10 C1-V 13 5 5 9 11 9 7 C2* 49 3 8 7 3 1 3 D1* 41 2 6 2 3 3 2 D2-V 14 12 9 8 13 10 14 E1-V 14 8 11 15 14 11 15 E2-V pU/UC motif is a feature of all HCV genotypes and variants. it represents a major PAMP of RIG-I recognition in conjunction with 5\u2032ppp of the HCV RNA. in vitro variants of each with shorter U-core motifs escape RIG-I recognition. pU/UC RNAs and variants actively engaged by RIG-I to promote its activation to a signaling-on conformation. only those pU/UC RNAs which induced RIG-I to undergo the signaling-on conformational change induced innate immune signaling and IFN induction. differences in the pU/UC motifs are responsible for the differential RIG-I recognition results that we observed. alterations in pU/UC motif sequence within the U core and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 arms would impact overall RIG-I activation for variable restriction of virus infection. pU/UC region in the HCV genome has been previously demonstrated to be essential for genome replication. full-length HCV T/F genomes retain PAMP activity in host cells. this activity is linked to the pU/UC motif of the T/F genome. other HCV RNA interactions may create a proinflammatory state within infected cells."}
