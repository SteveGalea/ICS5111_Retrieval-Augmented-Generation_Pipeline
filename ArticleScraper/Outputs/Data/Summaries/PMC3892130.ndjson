{"summary": "current MS therapies have limited ability to prevent neuronal damage. it is unclear whether SIRT1 activating compounds exert similar effects in demyelinating disease induced by other etiology. new therapies reduce the inflammatory component of MS. but their ability to prevent neuronal damage is limited [7-10], suggesting additional therapies with neuroprotective benefits are needed. the most common MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), is an autoimmune driven CNS demyelinating disease [12] that also exhibits neuronal damage [13-15] tylase involved in cell stress responses, attenuates neuronal damage in EAE [23-25], although mechanisms mediating this effect are not known. oxidative stress plays a role in neuronal degeneration in MS and EAE [28-30], suggesting SIRT1 activation may prevent neuronal damage by increasing mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. mice were treated with SRTAW04, 100 mg/kg/mouse/day by oral gavage. the dose was chosen based on previously measured pharmacokinetics of the drug. one group received SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (10 mg/kg/day i.p.) for 30 days. the retinas were washed with PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% TritonX 100 in PBS by freezing them for 15 min at 70\u00b0C, rinsed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with goat-antiBrn3a antibody. mice were killed at day 30 post inoculation, and were perfused transcardially with PBS followed by PFA. spinal cord tissues were sectioned at 5 m and stained with either Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) to detect demyelination or with anti-neurofilament antibodies to detect loss of axons. area of demyelination in LFB staining were quantified using a 0\u20133 point scale. experiments were repeated three times with 3\u20135 mice in each group. spinal cord sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector laboratories) mitoSOX red (invitrogen) superoxide indicator is a fluorogenic dye for selective detection of superoxide, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. reagent is cell permeable and is selectively targeted to the mitochondria, where it is oxidized by superoxide. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels, with 20 g of protein per lane. membrane was blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Licor Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE) for 1 hr at RT and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SIRT1 (1:1500) mice MHV-free mice were inoculated intracranially with 50% of the half lethal dose of the demyelinating strain MHV-A59 [2000 plaque forming units (pfu)] mice were monitored daily for mortality and signs of disease. mice received SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (10 mg/kg/day i.p.) for 30 days. previous studies have shown that EX527 treatment alone does not result in the acetylation of SIRT1/2 target p53. seven day and 30 day treatment groups received SRTAW04 starting from day 1 until sacrifice. one group received SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (10 mg/kg/day i.p.) for 30 days. previous studies have shown that EX527 treatment alone does not result in the acetylation of SIRT1/2 target p53. retinas were washed with PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% TritonX 100 in PBS. retinas were washed three times in PBS, incubated for 2 hours. cells were counted in 12 fields for fluorogold labeled RGCs. spinal cord levels were dewaxed, rehydrated, and then permeabilized with 0.5% tween-20 in PBS. sections were blocked with blocking reagent from Vectastain Elite ABC kit. incubated with goat biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 2 hours. the reaction was terminated by adding Fluor de Lys Developer (Enzo Life Sciences) and 2 mM nicotinamide after 60 min of incubation at 37\u00b0C. nicotinamide is a fluorogenic dye for selective detection of superoxide, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. nerves were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and mounted in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) 5 M cross-sections were made, mounted onto glass slides with Mowiol mounting medium, and observed under an Eclipse E600 (Nikon) fluorescence microscope using excitation 580 nm. the membranes were incubated with IRDye\u00ae 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG or IRDye\u00ae 600 goat anti-mouse IgG (Licor) as secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000 for 1 hr at RT. for normalization of signals, blotted membranes were stained for -actin (Sigma) significant differences were found in total RGC numbers counted in 12 standardized retinal fields, but not within any one region of the retina. MHV-A59 infected mice had significantly fewer surviving RGCs compared to non-infected mice. MHV-A59 or RSA59 infected mice were treated with SIRT1 activator SRTAW04 by oral gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day. mice were killed on the 4th day at different time intervals after the final dose. the expression level of SIRT1 protein in the optic nerves of MHV-A59 infected mice showed no significant change (n = 4) the expression level of SIRT1 protein in the optic nerves of MHV-A59 infected mice after 30 days of SRTAW04 treatment showed no significant change (n = 4) the ability of SRTAW04 to attenuate neuronal loss in MHV-A59 infected mice was therefore examined. the treatment group was administered SRTAW04 (100 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage starting from day 1 for 30 days. the decrease in RGC numbers in untreated MHV-A59 mice was significantly attenuated by SRTAW04 treatment. treatment with recombinant strain of MHV, RSA59 results in significant (@@@@p 0.01) attenuation of RGC loss. RSA59 induced a significant decrease in RGCs (***p 0.001) compared to control (n = 8) and MHV2 infected (n = 6) mice. for 30 days shows numerous RGCs similar to the non-infected control. MHV-A59 infected mouse treated with SRTAW04+ EX527 for 30 days shows fewer RGCs. neurofilament stained optic nerves from a representative control. axonal staining in control (n = 12) and RSMHV2-infected (n = 10) mice shows significant preservation (@@@p 0.01) of the axons compared to RSA59 infected mice. SRTAW04 treatment reduces accumulation of ROS in MHV-A59 infected optic nerves MitoSOX Red detection of superoxide within mitochondria was used to determine whether there is ROS accumulation in MHV-A59 mice were infected with MHV-A59 and sacrificed 7 days post-inoculation. there is an increase in staining of the superoxide anion in MHV-A59. less staining present in optic nerve from an MHV-A59 infected mouse. s were isolated during the peak of inflammation, 7 days post-inoculation with MHV-A59, from mice treated with or without 100 mg/kg SRTAW04 daily. protein levels of SDHb showed a significant decrease in the MHV-A59 infected group compared to controls. treatment with SRTAW04 significantly attenuated that change. MHV-A59 infected mice treated with SRTAW04 showed a significant increase (@p 0.05) of SDHb protein expression compared to untreated MHV-A59 infected mice. treatment with SRTAW04 significantly attenuates that change. spinal cord was isolated from mice infected with RSA59 for 30 days. demyelinating plaques were quantified on a 0 to 3 scale. the group receiving SRTAW04 showed a significant decrease in demyelinating. treatment with SRTAW04 shows a significant reduction in demyelinating score. 59 infected group compared to control and RSMHV2 infected mice. no significant difference was observed between inflammation score of MHV-A59 infected mice treated with SRTAW04. sections were stained with anti-Iba1 antibody, a macrophage/microglial marker. results suggest there is difference in the area and number of microglia present. all plaques contain Iba-1 stained cells regardless of SRTAW04 treatment. MHV-A59 infection induces optic nerve inflammation and neuronal loss. MHV-A59 infected mice develop inflammation peaking by 5\u20137 days after inoculation. whereas MHV2 infected mice have almost no inflammation nor demyelination. Inoculation with demyelinating strains MHV-A59 (n = 12), and its isogenic recombinant strain RSA59 (n = 10), lead to significantly decreased (***p 0.001) RGC numbers compared to non-infected control mice (n = 10), and mice inoculated with the non-demyelinating control strain MHV2 (n = 16) MHV-free mice were treated with SIRT1 activator SRTAW04 (100 mg/kg/day) for 4 days and sacrificed on the 4th day at indicated time intervals after the final dose (n = 4 per group). MHV-free mice were sacrificed 1 hr after SRTAW04 treatment. the ability of SRTAW04 to attenuate neuronal loss in MHV-A59 infected mice was therefore examined. the decrease in RGC numbers in untreated MHV-A59 mice was significantly attenuated by SRTAW04 treatment. RSA59 induced a significant decrease in RGCs and treatment with SRTAW04 attenuated RGC loss. the treatment group receiving EX527 showed a significant decrease in RGCs compared to the group that only received SRTAW04. treatment with SIRT1 inhibitor alone does not further reduce RGC survival. n = 10) showed a significant decrease in RGC numbers compared to the group that only received SRTAW04.

MHV induced disease also occurs even in the absence of lymphocytes. a number of potentially beneficial effects include anti-carcinogenic properties, anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators and/or activated immune cells, and inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cycooxygenase-2. the current studies show SRTAW04 exerts neuroprotective effects without suppressing gross levels of inflammation assessed by H&E staining. in this virus induced model of MS inflammation consists almost exclusively of macrophages. it is interesting that SIRT1 activation fails to block the migration of macrophages into the CNS. evidence suggests neurologic dysfunction in MS occurs as a result of axonal degeneration. authors have no financial interests or relationships with Sirtris or related to its SRTAW04 compound. authors declare no competing financial interests or relationships with Sirtris."}
