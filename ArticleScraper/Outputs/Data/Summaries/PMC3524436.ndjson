{"summary": "pertussis is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. there has been the resurgence of reported pertussis cases primarily in infants younger than 1 yr old. there has been the resurgence of reported pertussis cases primarily in infants younger than 1 yr old, especially less than 3 months of age. the incidence of pertussis was markedly increased (more than about 5.5 times) in 2009, compared to the previous (14). the incidence of pertussis in 2011 was more than two times compared with the incidence in 2009 (15). aryngeal aspirates (NPA) or swab. positive result of B. pertussis in PCR or real-time PCR of NPA or swab. RT-PCR was done by the method Glare et al. reported (16); RT-PCR was done by modified method of Reischl. a prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted between January 2009 and September 2011. we evaluated all infants clinically suspected of pertussis infection because of a cough lasting at least 2 weeks with at least one of the following symptoms. xin antibody in a single serum sample was higher than cut-off value (24 EU/mL) of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (IBL, Hamburg, Germany) or a 4-fold increased change in anti-PT antibody between acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum. parents and guardians provided an informed consent before enrolling the patients. nine patients (42.9%, average age: 47.4 days) had not received any DTaP vaccinations. 9 (42.9%, average age: 77.2 days) received 1 dose, 2 (9.5%, average age: 104.5 days) received 2 doses, and 1 (4.8%, age: 198 days) received 3 doses of DTaP. a total of 72 family members and long-term guardians of index infant cases were enrolled in this study for confirming household transmission. a total of 18 potential family sources (18/21, 85.7%) were identified for confirmed cases. DTaP vaccination coverage in Korea is very high, with 94% of the children completing the primary series of pertussis immunization. pertussis mostly occurred in young infants under 6 months of age who did not complete the primary series of DTaP vaccination. studies from other countries have also shown that the reported pertussis case mostly occurred in a summer months with high temperatures (21, 22) this lack of awareness and nonspecific clinical characteristics may be associated with underdiagnosed condition of pertussis. the diagnostic tool of pertussis is challenging. there has been an increase in the reported number of pertussiss cases in many countries, primarily among adolescents and adults. this is special concern because adolescents and young adults are a recognized reservoir of infection for neonates and infants, who are at high risk for pertussis-related morbidity and mortality (23-26) vaccination at 11 to 12 yr is expected to decrease the transmission of pertussis in households in Korea."}
