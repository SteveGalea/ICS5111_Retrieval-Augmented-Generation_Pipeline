{"summary": "producers and veterinarians make decisions that seek to maximize profit. but individual-level decisions may lead to complex and diverse epidemiological scenarios at a regional level. there is not much hope for disease control if programs are not simultaneously implemented at local and regional levels. tension between \"individual\" and \"common\" good leads to a complex relation of behaviors and attitudes, resembling a \u201cgame\u201d in social economics corresponds to a concept referred to as \u201cgame theory\u201d (9, 10), soon becomes dynamic. conditions required to control the disease at a regional level become difficult to reach, and often depends on regional leadership. a group of producers and practitioners shared breeding herd PRRSv status for their respective production systems. the program's name changed through time and is currently referred to as the Morrison's Swine Health Monitoring Project (MSHMP) in 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) and porcine delta-coronavirus (PDCoV) emerged in the US swine population (12, 13). these systems accounted for roughly 17% of the total US breeding herd based on USDA estimates (11). the prevalence graph for PRRSv is based on a classification from the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV), in which each PRRSv sow herd status is defined (15) the prevalence graph for PRRSv is based on a classification from the american association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV), in which each PRRSv sow herd status is defined (15) ccurrence Is Nationally Consistent but Regionally Different For the last 10 years, PRRSv has maintained stable incidence levels on an annual basis. the only period that showed a substantial different incidence was in 2013\u20132014, when PEDv was first detected in the US (17). however, seasonal dynamics seemed to differ across different states, with large epidemics occurring every 2\u20134 years. economic analysis revealed an advantage for herds using MLV compared to LVI (20, 21) 82 breeding herds in the midwestern US participated in this study, which accounted for 250,000 sows. the annual cost of PRRS to the swine industry has decreased since 2011. breeding herds have been classified using a slightly modified terminology to the one proposed by Holtkamp et al. (15) breeding herds have been classified using a slightly modified terminology to the one proposed by Holtkamp et al. that incorporates breeding herd shedding and immune status. swine sites were protected from reporting a PRRSv outbreak compared to sites located in regions with higher land slopes. swine sites surrounded by trees and herbaceous coverage were protected from reporting a PRRSv outbreak compared to sites located in regions with lower land slopes. the potential for forecasting was initially explored using PED incidence data (25) animal movement data available within the MSHMP was combined with environmental risk factors within a 10 km radius around breeding farms. results suggest that PED occurrence may be predictable with an acceptable (i.e., >80%) level of accuracy. a total of 82 breeding herds in the midwestern US participated in this study, which accounted for 250,000 sows. the annual cost of PRRSv to the Swine Industry has Decreased since 2011. has decreased $83.3 million from October 2010 ($663.91 million) to October 2016 ($580.62 million) (23), partially possibly due to increased number of breeding herds constantly immunizing sows with attenuated PRRS virus vaccines. some suggest that producers may have seen some value in the adoption and implementation of those research findings in the field. herds that have negative PRRSv shedding status and positive PRRSv exposure status maintain seronegative status for at least a year after reaching Category 3. pigs have stopped gilt and sow exposure to live virus. environmental factors play an important role in determining outbreak risk. the availability of farm-level outbreak data through MSHMP has enabled some of the first data-informed epidemiological models in the US swine industry. the availability of PRRSv genetic sequences from farms that became infected allowed for the model to be fit to the observed spatiotemporal dynamics of the unfolding PED epidemic in 2013. a program like MSHMP has had an important impact on the surveillance of pathogens for the national industry. an academic institution-led program has motivated producer and veterinarian collaboration for the greater good of the industry. but motivation declines with time and it is important to demonstrate the added value of the effort. author contributions All authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
