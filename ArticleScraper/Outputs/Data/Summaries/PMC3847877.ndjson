{"summary": "Background Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a RNA virus with high genetic variation. this virus causes significant economic losses in most pig-producing countries. the clinical presentation of PRRSV ranges from asymptomatic to devastating. PRRSV infection can range from asymptomatic to devastating, with symptoms such as listlessness, emaciation, hyperpnea, dyspnea, chemosis, abortion, stillbirth and a reduction in semen quality. the diagnosis has relied on probe-based real-time PCR [12-21], SYBR Green-based PCR [11,22-24], RT-PCR [1], virus isolation [1], immunohistochemistry [1] and serological methods ZNA were shown to enable specific and sensitive reactions when used as a primer for PCR and reverse transcription. results ZNA probe-based real-time PCR amplification and the limit of detection Tenfold serial plasmid dilutions (101 to 106 copies/l) were tested. we analyzed other swine viruses to test the specificity of the ZNA probe-based real-time PCR. the CV values in within-run and between-run ranged from 0.52 to 1.87% and from 0.85 to 1.98%, respectively. assay was tested on serum from both healthy and PRDC pigs. 112 (84.2%) of the 133 PRDC pigs and 79 (17.8%) of the 444 asymptomatic pigs were positive. the serum of PRDC (n = 112) and asymptomatic pigs (n = 79) was analyzed using ZNA probe-based real-time PCR. the mean percentages (long horizontal lines) of the PRRSV load in the PRDC and asymptomatic pigs were compared. the dynamic range of the real-time PCR assay spanned 6 log units. the dynamic range of the real-time PCR assay spanned 6 log units. the dynamic range of the real-time PCR assay spanned 6 log units. intra-assay variability Inter-assay variability Mean Cq SDa CV% Mean Cq SD CV% 1 2.09 0.06 2.68 2.13 0.05 2.11 2 2.98 0.14 4.70 3.04 0.14 4.45 3 4.85 0.02 0.43 4.85 0.16 3.39 4 6.01 0.09 1.45 6.07 0.17 2.72 5 2.75 0.13 4.60 2.76 0.10 3.51 aLog10 copy number per microliter of PRRSV. the levels of viral load correlated with the severity of the clinical presentation of the PRRSV-infected pigs. the serum of PRDC (n = 112) and asymptomatic pigs (n = 79) was analyzed using ZNA probe-based real-time PCR. the mean percentages (long horizontal lines) of the PRRSV load were significantly higher (P 0.0001) in the pigs with PRDC compared with the asymptomatic pigs. a new type of modified oligonucleotides known as ZNA was recently developed as a method for the clinical diagnosis of pathogens, such as the hepatitis B virus [27]. asymptomatic pigs are believed to serve as important reservoirs for the transmission of PRRSV to uninfected pigs [29]. the viraemia of the asymptomatic pigs ranged from 1.32 to 4.7 log10 PRRSV genome/l (mean 2.72 0.67 log10, median 2.75 log10). the presence of high PRRSV loads in a sample of animals is correlated to the presence of PRDC in pigs. the ORF 6 product was identified in 125 nucleotide sequences from Asian (n = 74), European (n = 41) and American (n = 10) available from GenBank. a 177-bp region was amplified using the primer pair PRRSV-M177F &-M177R. ZNA probe-based real-time PCR to detect PRRSV. each 10 l reaction mixture contained 0.2 M concentrations of the forward and reverse primers and 3 l of the cDNA. each run included serial 10-fold dilutions of the standard plasmid DNA. animal, specimen collection and sample preparation Serum samples were collected from 577 pigs from middle and southern Taiwan from 2012 to 2013. these animals included 444 healthy pigs and 133 symptomatic pigs that showed a clinical history of PRDC. RNA extraction and reverse transcription were performed according to the procedures outlined in Chomczynski [35] and Lin [36], respectively. the plasmids were purified using a plasmid miniprep purification kit. a standard curve was generated using 10-fold dilutions of the standard plasmid DNA. the reproducibility of the method was also evaluated by repeatedly testing the clinical samples. the correlation between PRRSV and PRDC was evaluated using the chi-square test."}
