{"summary": "vero cells can be grown in OptiPRO serum-free medium. most cells for vaccine production are mainly based on established animal cells. most cells are mainly based on established animal cells, such as MRC-5 human diploid cells. many vaccines, such as those against chikungunya, dengue fever, japanese encephalitis, viral gastroenteritis, polio, rabies, Ross River fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, smallpox, west Nile encephalitis, and influenza have been developed using the vero cell culture system [1] the cells used for viral vaccine production are anchorage dependent and therefore, processes involving these cells cannot easily be scaled up because there is a need for studies have attempted to develop a serum-free production platform for virus propagation. in a previous study, MDCK cells cultured in serum-free EX-Cell MDCK produced higher amounts of influenza virus than those cultured in serum-containing Glasgow's Minimum Essential Medium [10]. Opt-MEM Reduced-Serum Medium (Gibco) is a serum-free medium designed for the cultivation of a mammalian cell type supplemented with human insulin, bovine transferrin, and a purified mixture of bovine serum proteins including albumin. a stepwise reduction of percentage of FBS was performed to adapt serum-free culture condition. Adhesive cells were cultured in an Erlenmeyer flask for 5 days on an orbital shaker. viable cells were evaluated using a hemocytometer, along with 0.4% trypan blue staining. viability was monitored for 180 days by trypan blue staining. MRC-5 cells were cultured in Modified Eagle's Medium (MEM, Gibco) containing 10% FBS and 1 U/mL penicillin. 1 g/mL streptomycin (Gibco) in 5% CO2 conditions at 37\u00b0C. the virus was propagated in Vero cells with DMEM containing 2% FBS. cells were seeded in 10-cm culture dishes at a concentration of 1106 cells/dish. after 72 hours of culture, total cell number was determined using a hemocytometer. morphology of cells cultured in the media was evaluated based on cell number. the cells were infected at an multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for 5 days. the relative amount of Ad5-GFP produced was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity using a fluorescence microplate reader. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism ver. 5.0. MRC-5 and FRhk-4 cells cultured in Opti-MEM or OptiPRO serum-free medium showed abnormal cellular morphology. growth rate of MRC-5 cells cultured in VP-SFM or OptiPRO serum-free medium was lower than that when the cells were cultured in conventional medium (MEM with 10% FBS) growth rate of MRC-5 cells cultured in Opti-MEM or Ultraculture was lower than that when the cells were cultured in conventional medium (MEM morphology of vero cells in absence of FBS may not be applicable for other vaccine strain-producing cells such as MRC-5 cells. growth rate of FRhk-4 in serum-free culture conditions compared with that in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Vero cells cultured in both adhesive and shaking suspension culture showed cytopathic effects at 5 days after Ad5-GFP infection. we tested the vero cells in terms of their ability of virus generation using Ad5-GFP as a virus generation marker. growth rates of vero cells cultured in VP-SFM or OptiPRO media were lower than that of vero cells cultured under conventional culture conditions. the blue and red arrows represent abnormal cell growth. growth rate of cells cultured in serum-free conditions was lower than that of cells cultured in conventional culture media. FRhk-4 cells cultured in VP-SFM or Opti-MEM showed a similar growth rate. optimal culture conditions may not be applicable for other vaccine strain-producing cells such as MRC-5 cells. vero cells cultured in both adhesive and shaking suspension culture showed cytopathic effects at 5 days after Ad5-GFP infection. we tested the vero cells in terms of their ability of virus generation using Ad5-GFP as a virus generation marker. suspension-adapted Vero cells showed a 1.5-fold efficacy for VSV propagation. OptiPRO serum-free medium is free of any animal-derived components. OptiPRO is designed for several kidney-derived cell lines."}
