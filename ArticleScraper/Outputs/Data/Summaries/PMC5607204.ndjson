{"summary": "entry inhibitors are unique at blocking the function of an extracellular target, the envelope glycoprotein (Env) (1, 2, 3) entry inhibitors are responsible for receptor/coreceptor binding and virus-cell fusion. a series of works support the possibility that peptides derived from hydrophobic-at-interface envelope glycoprotein sequences may comprise new generic antivirals. we have recently established a synthetic virus-like (VL) mixture. it includes the main seven lipid species found in the HIV-1 membrane (22) and exhibits the same order degree and phase behavior. we first compare the inhibitory potencies of several membrane-proximal external region-transmembrane domain (MPER-TMD)-derived peptides. the 8-aminonaphtalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid sodium salt (ANTS), p-xylenebis(pyridinium)bromide (DPX), N-(7-nitro-benz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)phosphatidylethanolamine, and 6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Laurdan) were synthesized sequences covered by overlapping peptides used in this study. infectivity, vesicle permeability, and vesicle-vesicle fusion are also indicated. infectivity inferred from total cells expressing GFP. TZM-bl target cells were layered on top of immobilized virions. lipid suspensions were subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles before extrusion 10 times through two stacked polycarbonate membranes with a nominal pore-size of 0.1 m. vesicle-vesicle fusion was determined by the standard assays of ANTS/DPX leakage and Rho-PE/NBD-PE-based lipid mixing. lipids and peptides were mixed at the desired peptide-to-lipid molar ratio in CHCl3/CH3OH (9:1) before desiccation for 1 h to remove the organic solvent. to produce planar-supported phospholipid layers, phospholipid monolayers were first spread from chloroform/methanol 9:1 (v/v) solutions onto a 5 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl subphase, and then transferred onto mica. aFM images were obtained in an atomic force microscope (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) this region is absolutely conserved across viral strains and isolates. it would be involved in generating the type of lipid perturbations that prime the viral membrane for fusion. the particular organization of the MPER-TMD region allows, on the one hand, testing the prediction that CRAC-mediated, Chol-dependent membrane perturbations may sustain antiviral activity of the peptides. peptide MPER(671693)L679I induced robust antiviral activity with a mean IC50 value of 1.67 0.04 M. virucidal activity correlated with the capacity of the peptides for altering the properties of the viral membrane. significant leakage of contents and lipid mixing was observed upon VL LUV incubation with the peptides MPER(671693) or MPER(671693)L679I. however, peptide-induced perturbations that in the vesicular system can relax through vesicle-vesicle aggregation and fusion must persist in the immobilized viral particles. GP value distributions were determined for at least 30 single vesicles. lipid mixtures were as follows: POPC/SPM/CHOL/DHSM/POPE/pl-PE/POPS. AFM images were taken from VL mixture films compressed at the indicated surface pressures. Plots below images display the height profiles for the trajectories indicated by the white lines. decreasing the Chol content resulted in lower mean GP values, consistent with a decrease of the VL membrane order. a more subtle reduction of Laurdan GP values was observed for the GUVs treated with peptides MPER(671693) and MPER(671693)L679I. h values were significantly higher in peptide-containing monolayers. inclusion of 1 mol % of peptide induced more marked effect on lipid miscibility than reducing the Chol content of the mixture by 30 mol %. value in GUVs that contained the virucidal peptide MPER(671693) but comparable decreases in GUVs containing the inactive peptides. GP values were determined for VL GUVs that contained peptide (peptide/lipid 1:500) liquid-liquid immiscibility was also observed in the samples that contained the TMD(684704) peptide. in this case, the pattern was completely different, with the rigid areas surrounded by streams of fluid lipid. properties of the lipid bilayer seem to be critical for the entry function (14, 22, 23, 49, 54) in addition, the Env subunit gp41 is anchored to the HIV membrane through the MPER-TMD region (Env residues 656704, HXB2c numbering), which encompasses interfacially active sequences enriched in aromatic residues (24). using the VL surrogate we have comparatively assessed the selected peptides in their capacity for altering membrane the peptide MPER(671693) showed virucidal efficacy. it combined hydrophobic-at-interface aromatic and hydrophobic-aliphatic residues. this strongly suggests that the virucidal effect was not dependent on a direct interaction of the peptide with Chol. however, the mechanism relating this membrane activity to infection inhibition is not clear. virucidal peptides MPER(671693) and MPER(671693)L679I slightly, although significantly, decreased lipid packing of the VL mixture. incubation with peptides totally or partially depleted the solid supports of lipid, respectively. lipid monolayers were compressed to 10 mN/m, which represents a miscibility transition pressure for the HIV lipids and ternary mixtures containing Chol (23, 56). this condition was selected based on previous observations indicating that increasing lateral pressure to 30 mN/m induces collapse of the lipid monolayer made of the viral lipids. the lateral organization, consisting of demixed nanodomains, was preserved at the lower values of 20 and 10 peptide MPER(671693) inhibited HIV infection with an IC50 of 1.5 M. virucidal activity was not attained by fully hydrophobic peptide TMD(684704) however, antiviral capacity was not attained by fully hydrophobic peptide. virucidal peptides displayed membrane activity in lipid mixtures that resemble the composition and biophysical properties of the viral envelope. however, the mechanism relating this membrane activity to infection inhibition is not clear. virucidal peptides MPER(671693) and MPER(671693)L679I slightly, although significantly, decreased lipid packing of the VL mixture. however, a comparable fluidifying effect was observed when inactive sequences MPER(656683) or TMD were incorporated into VL GUVs. virucidal peptides can alter line tension directly by accumulating at the periphery of rigid domains. accumulation on the edges of lipid domains might help the assembly of the membrane permeating structures inducing vesicle leakage.
