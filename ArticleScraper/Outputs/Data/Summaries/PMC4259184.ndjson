{"summary": "IBV causes infections that result in clinical signs, such as gasping, coughing, tracheal rales, depression, and nasal and ocular discharge. the extent of morbidity and mortality depends on the virus strain, already established immunosuppression, breed and age of the chicks, nutrition, and environment (12,26,51) chicken homologues of the human receptors, DC-SIGN or L-SIGN, are part of an IBV receptor complex (1,59,61) receptors such as the toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and TLR2/6 may initiate the local trachea innate immune response upon IBV recognition. studies have shown that MBL may participate in the protection of the human host against viral infections, such as influenza A virus (13), hepatitis C virus (6), Ebola virus (44), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (28,63). in chickens, MBL serum concentrations have also been associated with the severity of a variety of diseases. the elucidation of the role of MBL in the development of adaptive immunity during an IBV infection may lead to a better understanding of how MBL may influence the outcome of infection. the aim of this study was to characterize the cellular and humoral immune response after IBV infection in the two chicken lines, L10H and L10L, varying in MBL serum concentrations. the first and second groups (the noninfected groups) were treated with 200 L PBS per bird containing IBV-M41. the solutions were given half nasally and half orally to mimic the natural occurring inoculation routes of IBV in the chicken. RNA and DNA isolation for total RNA extraction from the liver, lung, larynx, and trachea was controlled on a 1% agarose gel. samples were stored at 80\u00b0C if the RNA was not to be used immediately. a total of 5 L reaction volume containing 25 ng of DNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and applied to 384-well PCR plates. a total of 5 L reaction volume containing 25 ng of DNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and applied to 384-well PCR plates. genotyping data were analyzed by using the KlusterCaller software 2.24.0.11 (LGC Genomics) the design is based on the flanking regions of SNP1 and SNP2. real-time qRT-PCR of IBV load was determined using a method previously described. three swab samples from each subline, treatment group and day were pooled. RNA purification was performed using the QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA Mini kit. standard curves were made as fivefold dilutions starting at one dose. results are expressed as viral load according to the standard curve. each experiment contained triplicate no-template controls, test samples, and dilution series. real-time RT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master mix reagents kit. mRNA was used as an endogenous control to normalize the quantities of target mRNAs. mRNA was normalized by using the Ct method. Flow cytometry The absolute numbers of different T-cell subsets in peripheral blood were determined at weeks 0, 1 and 3 p.i. using a no-lyse no-wash flow cytometric method. the numbers of cells in the samples were calculated according to manufacturer's instructions. cells/L=(total number of cells counteddilution factorL fluorospheres addedassayed concentration of fluorospheres)/(total number of fluorospheres countedtotal volume) viral loads were, due to pooled samples (only three pools per group), only tested for subline differences on day 3 p.i. by the Student t-test. the model used for the absolute counts of B cells and monocytes measured by flow cytometry was yijl=+Ii+Lj+ILij+eijl, where was the overall mean, Ii was the effect of infection or not, and Lk was the effect of line k. isolators with group 1 and 3 contained 15 chickens, whereas isolators with group 2 and 4 contained 30 chickens. all IBV inocula were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) just before use. unstabilized blood was collected from all the blood sampling time points. EDTA-stabilized blood was also collected on day 7 p.i. (groups 2 and 4) and day 21 p.i. (groups 1 and 3) for MBL and MHC genotyping. swab samples were kept in 0.5 mL virus media. the RNA qualities were controlled on a 1% agarose gel. the samples were stored at 80\u00b0C if the RNA was not to be used immediately. final elongation was performed with 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 10 sec. annealing and extension was performed at 57\u00b0C for 1 min. allele discrimination was performed using two allele-specific fluorescent dyes. the design is based on the flanking regions of SNP1 and SNP2 in the chicken genomic MBL promoter sequences. qRT-PCR was performed using the high-capacity cDNA Archive kit. the total reaction volume was 20 L containing 11 L TaqMan\u00ae Universal PCR Master Mix. the reaction was performed in the ViiATM 7 system at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min with optic off. standard curves were made as fivefold dilutions starting at one dose, corresponding to minimum 103 EID50. RNA was reverse transcribed using the high-capacity cDNA Archive kit. the resulting cDNA was used as template for real-time RT-PCR. amplification was performed using the ViiATM 7 system. GAPDH mRNA was used as an endogenous control to normalize the quantities of target mRNAs. calculated expression was normalized by using the Ct method. each real-time RT-PCR experiment contained no-template controls. all flow cytometric analyses were performed using the BD FACSCantoTM (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) equipped with a 488 nm blue laser and 633 nm red laser. single-stained compensation controls as well as negative fluorescence minus one controls were included. the model used for the IBV-specific Ig antibody titer measured by ELISA was yijkl=+Ii+Dj+Lk+IDLikj+eijkl, where was the overall mean, Ii was the effect of infection or not, and Lk was the effect of line k. the various interaction effects and yijk and eijk were expected to be normally distributed. all L10L chickens were homozygous for the A1 allele, and all L10H chickens were homozygous for the A3 allele (37). the marker alleles for the MHC genotypes were determined by the use of LEI0258 genotyping. the two genotypes were randomly distributed in the experimental groups. a distinct difference in the MBL serum concentrations between L10H and L10L chickens at week 0 p.i. (p0.01) was observed. a weak acute phase response was observed in both sublines after infection peaking at day 3 p.i. followed by a decrease in the MBL serum concentrations below the baseline until day 7 p.i. a tendency for a different between MBL expression in infected and noninfected L10L chickens was observed. at day 3 p.i., the MBL fold change in infected L10L chickens was 7.5 times higher in the noninfected L10L chickens than in the noninfected L10L chickens. infected chickens increased 2.2 times and 3 times in infected L10L chickens from days 3 to 7 p.i. all differences were statistically significant (p0.01) at days 3 and 7 p.i., no significant difference of interest between the MBL fold changes in the larynx of the chickens was observed. the results are presented in Figure 6. Detection of lymphocytes in whole blood using the no-lyse no-wash flow cytometry procedure. EDTA blood was stained with anti-TCR FITC, anti-CD4-R-PE, and anti-CD8-Cy5. the double asterisks indicate statistically significant differences (p0.05) between the groups. the comparison of counts for TCR +cells between treatment groups and sublines (L10H and L10L) is presented in the upper panels in Figure 6. the numbers of TCRCD8+CD4 cells in the infected chickens did not increase until after week 1 p.i. the numbers of total TCRCD4+ cells increased during the experiment for all groups. however, no differences were observed between noninfected and infected L10L chickens within corresponding sublines. 121a 2,814135b 2,052213a Monocytes** 2,863242a 3,061188a 1,762108b 2,234166b Staining and gating of cell populations were performed according to Figure 5B. single asterisk indicates that parameters marked with the letters a and b within rows are statistically significantly different (p0.03) determination of MBL and MHC genotypes MBL genotypes were determined by the use of the KASP SNP genotyp viral load was significantly higher for L10L chickens than for L10H chickens at day 3 p.i. (p0.03). asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference (p0.03) between infected L10H and L10L chickens. MBL serum concentration from day 0 to 21 p.i. was measured by ELISA. results are shown as meanSEM. H or L indicates sublines with high or low MBL serum concentrations respectively. the MBL fold change in infected L10L chickens was three times higher than that of infected L10L chickens. at day 3 p.i., the MBL fold change in the liver was 7.5 times higher in the noninfected L10L chickens than in the noninfected L10L chickens. however, it did not reach the level of L10L chickens. the results are shown as meanSEM. H or L indicates the sublines with high or low MBL serum concentrations respectively. a no-lyse no-wash method was used to quantify T-cell subsets in peripheral blood. the absolute counts of TCR+CD8 cells are shown in the upper panel. the absolute counts of TCR+CD8+ cells are shown in the left column. the absolute counts of total TCRCD4+ cells are shown in the right column. the numbers of TCRCD8+CD4 cells were the same for all groups at week 0 p.i. at week 3 p.i., the numbers of TCRCD8+CD4 cells in the infected chickens did not increase until after week 1 p.i. and did not reach the same level as the corresponding noninfected subline. no significant differences were observed for the numbers of monocytes between noninfected and infected L10L chickens. however, a tendency (p=0.08) for a difference was observed between the number of monocytes in noninfected and infected L10L chickens. in the present study, the viral load peaks at day 3 regardless of the virus dose given (8,33) this difference may be explained by the different age of the chickens, infection routes, and the use of different IBV strains. however, in the previous studies, the decrease in the MBL serum concentration in L10H chickens after day 3 p.i. was less pronounced. the highest MBL expression in the present study was observed in the lungs of infected chickens at day 3 p.i. this is consistent with the viral load being highest at day 3 p.i. however, the climaxing of viral load in the trachea and lung may not necessary be the same at the same time point. the decrease in the MBL serum concentration after an IBV infection may be due to a negative feedback mechanism occurring at the MBL transcriptional level. however, it supports the other theories suggested by Juul-Madsen et al. that MBL may be transferred from the blood to infected tissues or that MBL has been used for opsonization. studies have indicated that T cells respond to pathogens and provide a protective immune response after immunization with both live-attenuated and nonattenuated Salmonella strains. in the current study, the numbers of TCR+CD8 cells differed between L10H and L10L and both infected chickens had lower number of TCR+CD8+ cells than the corresponding noninfected chicken line. this indicates that IBV affects the number of TCRCD8+CD4 cells during infection. the number of B cells was higher in noninfected L10L chickens than in noninfected L10L chickens. this contradicts the suggestion that the difference observed in the number of B cells between vaccinated L10H and L10L chickens could be caused by the given vaccine. the number of TCR+CD8+ cells differed between noninfected and infected L10H and L10L chickens. these cells may play a role in the immune response after an IBV infection. the number of monocytes was also higher in L10H chickens than in L10L chickens, which may have influenced the decreased viral load in the trachea."}
