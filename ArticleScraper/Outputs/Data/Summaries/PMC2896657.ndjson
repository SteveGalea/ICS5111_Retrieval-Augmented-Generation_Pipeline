{"summary": "protease inhibitors have been purified from an array of leguminous and nonleguminous species. protease inhibitors impair the activity of insect midgut proteases. they represent one of the multitude of entomotoxic proteins. the resulting supernatant was applied to a 5 20 cm column of DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) after elution of unadsorbed proteins (fraction D1), the column was eluted successively with 0.2 M NaCl and 1 M NaCl in the Tris-HCl buffer. dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to determine the molecular mass of the protein. the FPLC-Superdex 75 column was previously calibrated with molecular mass marker proteins. the highest iodoacetamide concentration used in the test was devoid of any effect on trypsin activity. assay for antiproliferative activity of the purified trypsin inhibitor was assayed as described below. the assay makes following use of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, commencing from the template/primer hybrid poly (dT) 15. an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. the peroxidase enzyme affects the cleavage of the substrate. BL21 cells containing plasmid were grown at 37\u00b0C until it reached OD600 0.7-0.8. cells were induced by addition of 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside) and harvested, after 4 hours of incubation, by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM MnCl2, 30 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol. pBluescript SK was coated onto each well in presence of 2 M NaCl as target DNA. the donor DNA was prepared by annealing VU5BR (5\u2032-biotin-GTGTGGAAAATCTC protein trichosanthin was employed as a positive control. reaction was carried out in a mixture containing 5 M SARS CoV protease, 5 M sample, and 20 M substrate and buffer. reaction was terminated by heating at 100\u00b0C for 2 minutes. disks containing the control produced crescents of inhibition around disks containing samples with antifungal activity. aqueous extract of the beans (250 g) was produced by blending in distilled water (3 ml/g) followed by centrifugation (14000 g for 25 minutes at 4\u00b0C) the resulting supernatant was applied to a 5 20 cm column of DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to determine the molecular mass of the isolated proteins. gel filtration on an FPLC-Superdex 75 column was employed to determine the molecular mass of the protein. trypsin inhibitory activity is equal to the % decrease in absorbance of the supernatant. assay for trypsin inhibitory activity was terminated by adding iodoacetamide at twice the amount of thiol functions at each DTT concentration. the highest iodoacetamide concentration used in the test was devoid of any effect on trypsin activity. sin inhibitors manifest this activity [50, 51] according to instructions supplied with the assay kit from Boehringer Mannheim. the assay makes following use of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, commencing from the template/primer hybrid poly (A) oligo (dT) 15. a 1-liter culture of cells containing the expressing plasmid was grown at 37\u00b0C until it reached OD600 0.7-0.8. cells were induced by addition of 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside) and harvested, after 4 hours of incubation, by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 5 mM, followed by dialysis against buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 20% glycerol) containing 2 mM -mercaptoethanol and then against buffer B containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. a 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the plasmid was grown at 37\u00b0C until it reached OD600 0.7-0.8. cells were induced by addition of 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside) and harvested after 4 hours of incubation. the supernatant was applied to a 1 ml chelating Sepharose column charged with 50 mM imidazole. the protein was eluted with five column volumes of buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole. the protein was eluted with three column volumes of buffer A containing 200 and 400 mM imidazole. biotinylated DNA immobilized on the wells was incubated with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) after the reaction, biotinylated DNA immobilized on the wells was incubated with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) followed by colorimetric detection with sterile blank paper disks (0.625 cm in diameter) were laid at a distance of 0.5 cm from the edge of the mycelial colony. an aliquot (15 l) of the trypsin inhibitor was added to a disk. the plates were exposed at 23\u00b0C for 72 hours until mycelial growth had enveloped the disks containing the control. both SP2SU2 and SP3SU2 displayed a molecular mass of 16 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Figure 3) and gel filtration (Figure 2). their N-terminal sequences are shown in Table 2. chromatography gel filtration of fraction SP3 from SP-Sepharose column on a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column in 0.2 M NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.5) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. trypsin inhibitory activity was restricted to the second fraction (SP3SU2) VMTI: double-headed trypsin inhibitor from Phaseolus vulgaris. VMTI: double-headed trypsin inhibitor from Phaseolus lunatus. IC50 = circa 0.6 M. inhibitory effects of the trypsin inhibitors on L1210 cells were, respectively, 21.5 M and 28.8 M. however, there was no activity toward MBL2 cells when tested up to 100 M. inhibition rate (%) of white cloud bean trypsin inhibitors on L1210 cells, MBL2 cells, and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) results are presented as mean SD (n = 3) ion exchange chromatography of fraction B1 on SP-Sepharose resolved it into a small unadsorbed fraction SP1 and three large adsorbed fractions (SP2, SP3 and SP4) of about the same size. final purification of SP2 on Superdex 75 produced two fractions, SP2SU1 and SP3SU2. trypsin inhibitory activity was found in both fractions SP2 and SP3. line across the right half of the chromatography represents the linear 0-1 M NaCl gradient in 10 mM NH4OAc buffer. Molecular mass of both trypsin inhibitors was calculated to be 16 kDa. trypsin inhibitors SP3SU2 and SP2SU2 were compared with other leguminous trypsin inhibitors. the two trypsin inhibitors did not inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase when tested at various concentrations up to 100 M (Table 4). they lacked antifungal activity when tested up to 24 g/disk (100 M, 15 l) the IC50 values of the inhibitory effects of the trypsin inhibitors on L1210 cells were, respectively, 21.5 and 28.8 M (data not shown) 30.6 2.9d 54.1 4.1e 67.4 4.1f 28.3 3.0d 54.1 3.6e 65.5 4.3f 93.7 5.0b 80 61.7 6.5g 83.2 5.9h 94.5 5.6i 59.6 4.7g 80.6 6.5h 91.9 6.6i 96.4 4.3c Results are presented as mean SD (n = 3). different alphabets (e.g., a, b, and c) indicate statistically significant difference (P 2.2d 4.3 1.0 3.1 0.6 Different alphabets indicate statistically significant difference (P.05) when data were analysed by analysis of variance followed by Duncan's multiple range test. the white cloud bean trypsin inhibitors demonstrate the same molecular mass; both are adsorbed on DEAE-cellulose and unadsorbed on Affi-gel blue gel. white cloud bean trypsin inhibitors exert antiproliferative activity. white cloud bean trypsin inhibitors do not exert a similar action on lymphoma. white cloud bean trypsin inhibitors do not inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. sin inhibitors."}
