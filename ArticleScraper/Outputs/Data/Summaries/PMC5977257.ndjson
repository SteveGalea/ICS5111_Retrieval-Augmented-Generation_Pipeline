{"summary": "tetherin is a type II single-pass transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, an extracellular domain, and a putative glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor from its N terminus to C terminus [13,14,15]. tetherin blocks enveloped viruses through a shared mechanism tethering them to the cell membrane [16], while different viruses take different measures to an viral membrane protein Vpu can downregulate huTHN from the cell surface by targeting it for proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. other enveloped viruses including HHV8, Ebola virus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) are also found to be restricted by tetherin. eqTHN, but not huTHN, has restriction activity towards human FLUAV A/Sichuan/1/2009 (H1N1) and equine FLUAV A/equine/Xinjiang/1/2007 (H3N8) no studies on the activity of tetherins from different species that block FLUAV. 293T cells and Madin-Darby canine kidney cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s high-glucose modified Eagle medium (HyClone, Logan, Utah, USA) all mutant plasmids were constructed according to the online In-Fusion \u00aeHD Cloning Kit User Manual (http://www.clontech.com/CN/Products/Cloning_and_Competent_Cells/) the fragments of the pLPCX vector and each target gene were amplified with a 15 bp homologous arm. pLPCX_huTHN was used as the template to amplify the pLPCX vector, including an HA tag and the N-terminal 14 amino acids of huTHN. this sequence was then fused with the eqTHN fragment. cell lines were lysed using a RIPA Lysis Buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and centrifuged at 13,000 g and 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. the cells were then selected using 5 g/mL puromycin. membranes were washed three times for 10 min with TBST. signals were detected by a LI-COR Odyssey Imaging System. recombinant viruses were proliferated using 9-day-old embryonated hen eggs. a 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 1 g/well of mouse monoclonal anti-FLUAV nucleoprotein (NP) antibody. the plate was washed three times with washing buffer and blocked with 200 L 5% calf serum at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were gently washed with preheated PBS and DMEM supplemented with 1 g/mL TPCK the plate washed again and incubated with freshly prepared tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) peroxidase substrate. the reaction was stopped by adding 50 L of 2 M H2SO4. the optical density at 450 nm (OD450) was measured using the VersaMax Microplate Reader. the cells were incubated with the primary antibody (anti-FLUAV NP mouse antibody) and the secondary antibody (anti-mouse-HRP from KPL, 50 L/well) for 1 h at RT. with a further wash, the cells were incubated with 50 L of True Blue substrate for about 10 min until blue spots from infected cells appeared. cells were incubated with anti-rabbit HA antibody (Sigma, 1:200) for 1 h at RT, then for a further hour with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) the cells were dyed with anti-fade-46-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) pLPCX, the MLV Gag polymerase expression vector pCGP, and pVSV-G were purchased from Clontech (Felicia, CA, USA) PCR-generated fragments were then cloned into the pLPCX vector via the NotI and XhoI restriction sites. pLPCX_huTHN was used as the template to amplify the pLPCX vector, including an HA tag and the N-terminal 14 amino acids of huTHN. this sequence was fused with the eqTHN fragment. the 8 plasmids for rescuing the virus A/equine/Xinjiang/1/2007 were constructed in-house. helper plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells cultured in a 10-cm dish. the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. cell lines were then selected using 5 g/mL puromycin. recombinant viruses were proliferated using 9-day-old embryonated hen eggs. mutants with single point mutations in HA or NA were generated by using mutant plasmids. cDNA was synthesized from vRNA by reverse transcription-PCR. supernatants were collected at 36, 40, 44, 48 and 52 h post-infection. debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min. the amount of virus present in each supernatant was determined by an in-house ELISA method. nm was measured using the VersaMax Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) dilution buffer was used as blank control and the purified 1:2 diluted FLUAV NP protein was used as a standard. the virus production was calculated according to the standard curve. the cells were incubated with 50 L of True Blue substrate (KPL, Milford, MA, USA) for about 10 min until blue spots from infected cells appeared. the cells were dyed with anti-rabbit HA antibody (Sigma, 1:200) ade-46-diamidino-2-phenylindole was observed using a leica DM-IRE2 confocal microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) for subcellular location of tetherins after viral infection, the cell lines were seeded into the capsule. when the density of the cells reached 70\u201380%, they were infected with SC09 or SC09rHBG HA/NA at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 the HA tag was used as a negative control to remove HA tag interference during viral budding. cells were lysed in radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. proteins were separated by 4\u201312% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. the results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown and results were later confirmed in three separate experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviations (SD); (D\u2013F) The amount of SC09 virus released from MDCK, huTHN and eqTHN-expressing MDCK cells at 48 h post-infection. eqTHN could significantly inhibit the replication of SC09 before 60 h post-infection. the quantitative ELISA could be used as an indirect measure of viral titer. eqTHN could significantly inhibit the replication of SC09 before 60 h post-infection. eqTHN or huTHN by transfection with increasing dose in HEK293T cells had no impact on both SC09 and XJ07 polymerase activity. eqTHN had a shorter cytoplasmic tail domain than huTHN, which has also been reported in feline tetherin. the shorter cytoplasmic tail domain of eqTHN contributed to its stronger restriction activity. tetherin is localized to lipid raft domains used for budding by FLUAV. the shorter cytoplasmic tail domain of eqTHN contributed to its stronger restriction activity. huTHN, eqTHN, huTHN_del_14 and hu_eqTHN-expressing MDCK cells were stained with an anti-HA antibody (green) and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) the cells were subsequently analyzed using confocal microscopy. huTHN_del_14 was unable to block the budding of SC09. higher restriction levels of eqTHN could be partly ascribed to its shorter cytoplasmic tail domain. replacement of eqTHN CT with huTHN CT did not alter localization of tetherin. the eqTHN_del_GPI could be expressed on the cell surface at a higher level, shown by subcellular distribution using fluorescence microscopy. the GPI anchor was required for the tethering of nascent virus particles onto the cell surface. eqTHN could inhibit the release of FLUAV from MDCK cells. huTHN was unable to block the release of SC09rHBG HA/NA at an MOI of 0.1 at any of the time points assessed. eqTHN fully lost the ability to inhibit the egress of SC09rHBG HA/NA. results showed HA and NA of both SC09 and HBG were able to counteract huTHN. MDCK-, huTHN- and eqTHN-expressing cells were infected with SC09 or SC09rHBG HA/NA. cells were stained with an anti-HA antibody (green) and anti-nucleoprotein (NP) antibody (red) and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) the cells were subsequently analyzed using confocal microscopy. an alignment of amino acid sequences of HA and NA in SC09 with those of HBG revealed differences at only 2 positions in each protein, namely positions 13 and 49 of HA and positions 32 and 80 of NA. to verify this, we predicted the structures of HA and NA of both virus strains using the online service Phyre2 (Figure 5B,C). analysis was performed using Swiss-PBD Viewer software. structure prediction of HA2 domain of SC09 and HBG using Phyre2. results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. the release of SC09 reassortants bearing HA or NA of HBG was not modulated by eqTHN. either HA or NA alone of HBG had the ability to counteract eqTHN in an SC09 context. this was consistent with a previous study regarding herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) eqTHN was able to block the release of both human FLUAV SC09 and Equine FLUAV XJ07 FLUAV has been the subject of inconsistent data regarding its sensitivity to tetherin. for this purpose, three MDCK cell lines constitutively expressing either an HA tag, an N-terminally HA-tagged huTHN or eqTHN protein were generated. at 1 h post infection, the excess input viruses were removed by washing using preheated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 24 h, 36 h, 48 h and 60 h post-infection, supernatants were harvested and the amount of virus released was determined by ELISA. results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown and results were subsequently confirmed in three separate experiments. a single experiment performed with triplicate samples is shown. results were later confirmed in three separate experiments. eqTHN-expressing and control MDCK cells were each infected with SC09 at an MOI of 0.1. eqTHN or huTHN could not inhibit the production of SC09. the expression levels of endocellular NP in these three cell lines were almost the same (Figure 1E) and tetherin also expressed well (Figure 1F) neither eqTHN nor huTHN affected the production of viral protein and tetherin functioned by restricting the release of FLUAV. the shorter cytoplasmic tail domain of eqTHN contributed to its stronger restriction activity. eqTHN had a shorter cytoplasmic tail domain than huTHN, which has also been reported in feline tetherin. ic tail domain of huTHN is boxed in black. two putative N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain are marked with black triangles. cells were lysed and the sample was treated as described for panel A in Figure 1. confocal microscopy showed both of the mutant proteins still localized on the surfaces of host cells. the replacement of eqTHN CT with huTHN CT did not alter the localization of tetherin. the shorter CT of eqTHN was instead important in the maintenance of its antiviral activity. the inhibition of wild-type SC09 release is currently unclear. the expression levels of eqTHN_del_GPI were higher than those of eqTHN. quantification of the number of SC09 viruses released into the supernatants showed no significant differences. infection and detection were carried out as described above. results were confirmed in three separate experiments. HA and NA of both SC09 and HBG could counteract eqTHN. infection and detection were carried out as described as above. results of a single experiment performed with duplicate samples are shown. results were subsequently confirmed in three separate experiments. eqTHN and huTHN still localized on the surface of cells with either SC09 or SC09rHBG HA/NA infection or without infection. however, expression levels of eqTHN and huTHN seemed to increase after infection which could be explained by rising interferon levels after viral infection. eqTHN increased most with SC09 infection. HA2 is known to first anchor HA to the viral membrane and then to facilitate membrane fusion of the virus with the endosomal bilayer. modification of HA2 might alter its interaction with eqTHN and thus keep or even enhance its role in viral replication. eqTHN-expressing MDCK cells released at 48 h post-infection at 0.1. results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. infection and detection were carried out as described above. the release of SC09HA A13T and SC09HA I49L was markedly inhibited compared with that of SC09rHBG HA. mutants with a single point mutation in NA could still greatly enhance release of SC09 from eqTHN-expressing cells. huTHN is able to inhibit the release of FLUAV VLPs [26,34,43] eqTHN can inhibit release of SC09 while huTHN has no effect on it. there is an interspecies restriction between FLUAV and its hosts imposed by tetherin. significant controversy exists surrounding whether tetherin is able to exert an antiviral effect on wild-type FLUAV [26,34,44] the ELISA can be used as an indirect measure of viral titers. the tetherin functions at the viral budding stage by tethering the virions onto the cell membrane. the difference of viral production between wild-type and tetherin positive cells dwindled. a human can be infected by a wide range of FLUAV, whereas limited strains are able to spread between horses and the H3N8 subtype viruses are the only viruses currently circulating in horses [50] Restriction factors are components of the intrinsic and innate host defense process. it is extremely difficult to find key sites of antagonism against tetherin in HA and NA. eqTHN carries a shorter N-terminal region and displays strong inhibition on FLUAV release. the shorter cytoplasmic domain of eqTHN compared with huTHN leads to the loss of a dual-tyrosine motif (Y6\u2013Y8). this region has been found to be key for the internalization of tetherin from lipid rafts on the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments by clathrin-mediated endocytos current research evaluates anti-FLUAV activities of huTHN and eqTHN. key sites on HA and NA in an SC09 virion context to antagonize eqTHN. more work needs to be done to illustrate the detailed molecular mechanism involved in the structure-specific interaction."}
