{"summary": "osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that causes progressive disorder of joint function. it is the leading cause of disability and poor quality of life among the elderly in developed countries. information from the NHI database is considered appropriate for assessment of epidemiologic features of TKR in Taiwan. we sought to estimate the incidence of TKR from 1996 to 2010 by demographics, incidence rates, lengths of stay. all dollar values at the end of each year were adjusted to 2011 Taiwan currency values. all hospital charges were then converted from Taiwan dollars to US dollars using an exchange rate of 30:1 based on the average exchange rate over the 1996 to 2010 period. the rate of incidence of TKR in females was approximately 2.5 to 3 times that of males from 1996 to 2010. the mean age was 68.83 years in all individuals, and the average age of patients receiving TKR increased from 1996 (66.34 years old) to 2010 (69.97 years old). the average age of TKR patients gradually increased by 3.63 years. incidence rates of primary total knee replacements from 1996 to 2010 stratified by gender. the rates were calculated as the register count per 100,000 persons in the population defined by the national health insurance. gender percentages also show similar result to incidence rate of TKR for females compared with males. patients with RA and AVN in their primary diagnoses had a lower risk for TKR (RR = 0.15, 95% CI: 15.30\u201317.25 and RR = 0.007, 95% CI: 15.30\u201317.25, respectively) in all, 154,553 TKR surgeries were performed in Taiwan. the average age of TKR patients gradually increased by 3.63 years. the rate of TKR tripled, from 24.64 to 74.55 per 100,000 between 1996 and 2010. however, there was a large increase in the distribution in TKR in the 80 age group whose incidence rate increased approximately 4.1 times. the gender percentages also show a similar result to the incidence rate of TKR for females compared with males. the principal diagnosis during the study period was OA, which ranged from 90.31% to 96.94%. the average cost to individuals undergoing TKR declined from $7485.32 to $4826.61. diagnoses had a lower risk for TKR (RR = 0.15, 95% CI: 15.30\u201317.25 and RR = 0.007, 95% CI: 15.30\u201317.25, respectively) than those with OA. the rate of TKR increased over the years 1996 to 2010 and the increase was much larger when women compared with men. there were 10,132 primary TKA for OA in Australia in 1994, which increased by 42.8% to 14,472 in 1998. there were 10,132 primary TKA for OA in Australia in 1994, which increased by 42.8% to 14,472 in 1998. 96.9% of TKR patients had OA in 2010. there is a close association between the ageing society and the risk of OA. the median charge of TKR in hospitals rose from $19,309 to $29,509 (1.53 times) in the last few years in the united states. the average hospital charges of TKR increased from $39.69 to $83.35 million (an increase of 110.00%) HCC, YLC, GSH participated in the design of the study, analyzed and interpreted the data. CL, HC carried out the statistical analysis. HSL, SJY conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination."}
