{"summary": "data were abstracted from these articles using a data collection tool. results We identified six main topic domains: infectious diseases (58.7%), non-communicable diseases (29.4%), mental health and substance use (8.3%), general population behavior (4.6%), environmental, dietary, and lifestyle (4.6%), and vital status (0.9%) digital epidemiology can be broadly defined as epidemiology that uses digital methods from data collection to data analysis. a narrower definition of digital epidemiology is that which uses digital data that was not generated with the primary purpose of epidemiological studies. researchers used data from Twitter to track level of disease activity and concern about the influenza H1N1 pandemic in 2011 [6]. twitter has also been used to assess health sentiments such as those about vaccination [7] and to monitor drug safety [8]. the key words used in the PubMed search are presented in Table 1. PubMed search criteria. we excluded 753 articles that met at least one of the exclusion criteria. we created a general descriptive classification of these variables. first, we examined the full text of the articles, and extracted the data sources and analytical methods. then, we identified and categorized data sources and analytic methods. study selection We included all research articles published within the last decade that used digital data to answer epidemiological research questions within the domain of healthcare. we excluded studies that primarily focused on plant and animal epidemiology. we also excluded review articles that did not make substantial use of digital data. we created a general descriptive classification of these variables. first, we examined the full text of the articles, and extracted the data sources and analytical methods. then, we classified the articles using these categories. the number of publications on digital epidemiology has increased over the past decade. of the 62 studies conducted in a single country, more than half were conducted in the united states followed in order by the UK, France, and Italy. the general population behaviors studied included suicide, cancer screening, and population movement. the environmental, dietary, and lifestyle category included foodborne illness, vitamin D, and air quality. most of the social media data was from twitter and blogs. study design Overall, 70.6% of studies were time series cross-sectional studies, 22.9% were cross-sectional studies at a single point in time, 3.7% were case-control studies, 1.8% were cohort studies, and 0.9% were intervention studies. an example is Zhang et al. [21], which examined seasonal variation in the volume of Google search queries for cellulitis from 2004 to 2016. 48.7% of the studies with outcome measures estimated incidence of infectious diseases or other problems. 47.4% assessed disease prevalence in the united states in near-real-time by monitoring the rates of Wikipedia article views. topics included infectious diseases (58.7%), non-communicable diseases (29.4%), mental health and substance use (8.3%), general population behavior (4.6%), environmental, dietary, and lifestyle (4.6%), and vital status (0.9%) descriptive studies focus on presenting phenomena with incidence, size, and/or other measurable attributes. an explorative study focuses on understanding the underlying causes of a phenomenon or the systematic relationships among variables. an example of a cross-sectional study at single point in time is a study by Tourassi et al. [15], which classified study subjects into a case group (females for whom cancer is the stated or inferred cause of death) an example of an intervention study is Edoh's study [16] which conducted an experiment using large range/distance temperature sensors and drones in order to collect infectious diseases-related data. used regression analyses, 25.6% used machine learning techniques, 19.3% used descriptive analyses. Generous et al. used boosted decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks as machine learning classifiers. data sources More than half of the studies (52.3%) used web search queries via search engines such as google, Baidu, Yandex, Daum and Parsijoo. most of the social media data was from twitter and blogs. online obituaries from funeral home web pages were used to retrieve vital status of patients with cancer. study design Overall, 70.6% of studies were time series cross-sectional studies, 22.9% were cross-sectional studies at a single point in time, 3.7% were case-control studies, 1.8% were cohort studies, and 0.9% were intervention studies. most time series cross-sectional studies analyzed digital data to compare phenomena across time periods. t al. [24] evaluated the feasibility of using zika-related Google search queries, Twitter, and news reports collected by HealthMap to dynamically track and predict the incidence of Zika virus up to 3 weeks ahead of the release of official reports. 47.4% assessed disease prevalence. more than half of studies (56.9%) used digital data collected in a single country. the united states topped the list with 35 studies, followed by the UK, France, and Italy with 3 studies each. examples of epidemiological studies in more than one country include evaluation of GFT data in low-to middle-income Latin America [32] data was used to study the travel patterns and malaria risk for the population of Kenya [10], and to examine the magnitude and trends of population movements following the earthquake and cholera outbreak in Haiti [11]. however, explorative studies were the most frequent type (38 studies) followed by explanatory studies (30 studies). in traditional epidemiological studies, the most frequently used method is cross-sectional regression. four authors independently reviewed each article and category of abstraction. no prior standards to follow for evaluating literature from novel digital data sources such as search engines, social media services, and mobile phones."}
