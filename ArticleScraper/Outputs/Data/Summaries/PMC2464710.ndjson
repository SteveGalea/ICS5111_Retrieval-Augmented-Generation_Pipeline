{"summary": "pathogen outbreaks often occur when anthropogenic change brings wildlife into increased contact with humans and domestic animals [1], [2], [3] scientists and laypeople pay great attention when these outbreaks involve the emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases of humans, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or H5N1 influenza [4], [7].. wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are also suffering serious declines throughout North America [24], [25] and the UK [17], [26]. a recent report concluded that, in North America, a possible cause of bumble bee decline is pathogen spillover from commercially reared bees [27] worldwide, five species of bumble bees are reared commercially for the pollination of at least 20 different crops. at least one pathogen, the intestinal protozoan Crithidia bombi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) [42], [43], is known to spread horizontally when infected and susceptible bumble bees share flowers. in Europe, C. bombi is a well known enemy of bumble bees [50], whereas in North America, almost nothing is known about its occurrence. spillover of C. bombi from commercial bumble bees is expected and observed near industrial greenhouses. compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in field. t = 18 wks, peak prevalence reaches 100%, and the wave spreads through the wild bumble bee population at a rate of 2 km/wk. pathogen spillover depends most crucially on the dynamics of transmission at flowers. halving the estimated rate at which C. bombi breaks down on flowers causes the late-season wave of infection to increase by 4\u20135 times. in our model, infection occurs at a rate proportional to the product of the densities of pathogens and hosts. in contrast, a five order-of-magnitude change in the diffusion rate of hosts and pathogens increases the peak prevalence of infection by, at most, 30%. a wave front will form and travel through the wild host population. this species comprised, at the same time of year, only 15% of bumble bees at Beamsville, where greenhouses had stopped using B. impatiens. a third of bumble bees at our site away from any greenhouse operation (Thamesville) commercial bees escaping from greenhouses were from infected hives. 89% of the colonies contained the pathogen C. bombi. 7326% of nestmates were infected within hives that tested positive for this pathogen. the prevalence and intensity of C. bombi infections in bumble bees declined with increasing distance from greenhouses. up to 33% (Exeter) and 47% (Leamington) of bees collected immediately adjacent (within 30 m) were infected. however, no infected bees were found at 2.4 km from the greenhouse at Exeter. bumble bee workers collected at varying distances to industrial greenhouses at (A) Exeter and (B) leamington during summer 2005. sample sizes are shown in parentheses. shaded areas indicate predicted prevalence of infection during our study period. the spillover model reproduced the sharp decline in pathogen prevalence observed near greenhouses. the model predicts that, for nearly any given distance from a greenhouse operation, the prevalence of infection would vary by less than 10% between June\u2013August. workers of two other bumble bee species were frequently infected by C. bombi. the wild species that often shared flowers with commercial B. impatiens (e.g., B. rufocinctus) were more often infected by C. bombi than those that rarely shared flowers with B. impatiens. fervidus 1.450.92 (69) 5.712.87 (35) B. griseocollis 0.000.00 (17) 0.000.00 (3) B. impatiens 17.462.59 (189) 26.834.60 (82) B. rufocinctus 45.4510.26 (22) \u2013 Other 0.000.00 (38) 0.000.00 (6) Table 4. Percent similarity in plant species use among bumble bee species at our study sites in southern Ontario during June\u2013August, 2005 pathogen spillover into wild populations is localized around the source. predicted prevalence of C. bombi peaks at approximately 20% alongside greenhouses. by t = 14 and 15 wks, peak prevalence of C. bombi near greenhouses increases from roughly 35% to 75%. halving the estimated rate at which C. bombi breaks down on flowers causes the late-season wave of infection to increase by 4\u20135 times (from 20% to 90%) pathogen species that remain in the environment (decay slowly) as durable spores could spread extensively if introduced into wild populations. in early summer at Exeter, almost all (>90%) of the B. impatiens were collected within 200 m of the greenhouse, whereas only 1% foraged beyond 400 m despite suitable flower patches at greater distances. the same pattern was evident at our leamington site. many of the worker and male B. impatiens we observed near greenhouses originated from mature commercial colonies used for pollination. most, if not all, of these B. impatiens workers were from commercial colonies in the greenhouse. wild Bombus were entirely free of C. bombi (site effect, G = 26.9, d.f. = 3, P0.001). the prevalence and intensity of C. bombi infections in bumble bees declined with increasing distance from greenhouses. greenhouses were foci of infection for all bumble bees. fewer infected commercially reared B. impatiens as we moved away from their hives. sitea 2.4 1 0.12 Time of yeara 3.7 1 0.06 Distancesite 11.0 1

those that rarely shared flowers with B. bombi. a simple correlation analysis revealed a significant positive association (Pearson's rho = 0.8, n = 5, P = 0.04) between percent similarity in plant species use (Table 4) and prevalence of infection (Table 3). average (SE) percentage of bumble bees (sexes and castes pooled) among the most common Bombus species at our study sites in southern Ontario during June\u2013August, 2005. pathogen Crithidia bombi infects up to 75% of wild bumble bees. at sites distant to greenhouses, we have not found any bees harbouring this pathogen. pathogen prevalences near greenhouses are generally consistent with our model. wild bumble bees emerge earlier in the year or remain active year-round. seasonal forcing in temperate regions does not mean there is no lasting impact of spillover on wild bee populations. new queens may acquire C. bombi from their infected natal hives or from contaminated flowers. bumble bee domestication (bombiculture) has produced dense monocultures of hives. under these conditions, contagious disease has flourished [28], [32], [34], [37] commercial rearing facilities work to achieve and maintain disease free bumble bees for crop pollination. infected commercial bees often escape from greenhouses and share nearby flowers with wild Bombus, thereby providing sufficient opportunities for transmission of disease. prevalence of C. bombi in our study reflected patterns of plant species use by the hosts. it is possible that spillover occurs via wild bees entering greenhouses and visiting contaminated plants/bee hives. we simplified the model in this way because we want to focus on the introduction of pathogens by commercial bees into an established population of wild bumble bees. the second assumption was made in order to minimize the number of unknown and currently inestimable parameters in our model. we imposed \u2018no flux\u2019 boundary conditions, i.e., the rate of change in the densities of hosts and pathogens is zero at the edges of space. by reducing the spatial dynamics to a single dimension, the model assumes that pathogen spread away from the point source is the same in all directions. the validity of assuming random, diffusive movement of pathogen cells is supported by the fact that bumble bee populations isotropically disperse other pathogenic particles. bumble bee populations isotropically disperse other pathogenic particles (e.g., anther smut) among plants over relatively short distances. all field work was carried out during summer 2005. collected bees during mornings and afternoons by walking haphazard trajectories. collected 468 workers, 123 males, and 24 queens across nine bumble bee species. the rearing facility selected our hives from stock destined for industrial greenhouses. screened each colony for C. bombi by removing 10 arbitrarily chosen workers. in total, we examined 65 colonies in this manner. this analysis included only collecting sites immediately adjacent to greenhouses. all other species were too rare to accurately characterize their use of plant species. similarity values can range from zero (no overlap at any plant species) to 100 (identical use of plant species) we based our model of pathogen spillover on the standard insect-pathogen model of Anderson and may [67] we track the spread of pathogens in space x (displacement from starting point) as well as time t: (1) (2) (3) where S, I, and P are the densities of susceptible wild bees, infected wild bees, and infective pathogen particles in the environment. e colonies are small and vulnerable to disease-induced mortality. only about 5% of bees infected by C. bombi are sexual, suggesting almost all transmission occurs among workers. our dispersal coefficient D has the same value for hosts and free-living pathogen cells. the validity of assuming random, diffusive movement of pathogen cells is supported by the fact that bumble bee populations isotropically disperse other pathogenic particles (e.g., anther smut) among plants over relatively short distances. all field work was carried out during summer 2005. in total, we collected 468 workers, 123 males, and 24 queens across nine bumble bee species. the greenhouses used commercial Bombus impatiens Cresson continuously from February to June. used bumble bees for approximately two months prior to sampling. used hives from stock destined for industrial greenhouses. screened each colony for C. bombi by removing 10 arbitrarily chosen workers. we wished to determine if bee species that often shared flowers with commercial B. impatiens experienced greater prevalences of infection by C. bombi than species that rarely shared flowers with commercial bees. this analysis included only collecting sites immediately adjacent to greenhouses and only mid- to late-summer sampling dates. supporting information Text S1 Experimental parameter estimates (0.06 MB DOC) Click here for
