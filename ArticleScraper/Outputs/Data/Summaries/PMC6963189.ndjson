{"summary": "sialic acid (Sia) refers to a family of more than 50 forms typically varying at the C5 position. chief among these in mammalian cells is N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), which is a keto-aldononulosonic acid positioned at the terminal ends of glycolipids and glycoproteins. O-acetylation can occur in mono-, di-, tri-, or tetra- forms at varying positions of Neu5Ac. most common forms of O-acetylation across species occur at C7,8, and 9 positions. di-O-acetylneuraminic acid V, H [32] 5-N-Acetyl-4,7,9-tri-O-acetylneuraminic acid V, H [32] 5-N-Acetyl-7,8,9-tri-O-acetylneuraminic acid V, H [32] 5-N-Acetyl-4,7,9-tetra-O-acetylneuraminic acid V, H SOAT (EC 2.3.1.44) is responsible for O-acetylation on the extended alkyl chain of Sia at C7\u20139. 4-SOAT (EC 2.3.1.44) is responsible for O-acetylation at the C4 position. accharide occurs from C8 to C7 when monitored by 1H and 13C NMR [26,27], while acetyl groups of serogroup W-135 polysaccharides spontaneously migrate from C7 to C9 [28]. acetyl groups of serogroup W-135 polysaccharides containing -(2,6)-linkages to galactose or glucose spontaneously migrate from C7 to C9. coronaviruses, a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus classified under the family Coronaviridae, contain spike (S) glycoproteins (and hemagglutinin-esterases) that utilize O-acetyl forms of Sia for attachment [36,37,38] Viral fusion with the host membrane promotes viral replication. 4 O-acetylated Neu5Ac is ubiquitous in ungulates [11,22,40,40,41,42,43,44], echinoderms [45], echinoderms [45], Australian monotreme echidna [40], and a subgroup of chordates [42,43,44,46,47]. the most convenient isolation techniques involve the application of sialidases. benzene [54,56,57], colorimetric determination [58,59,60], thin-layer chromatography [60], electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry [61], GC-MS of silylated analogues [53,63] Extraction and detection methods of O-acetylated Neu5Ac. conditions +/ Comments References Alkaline conditions \u2013 Acetyl migrations [47,62] Glycan release by Na partially O-acetylated CMP Neu5Ac (e.g., Neu5,7(8,9)Ac2) are used as glycosyl donors rather than free CMP sialic acid. some strains of Gram-negative bacteria modulate CPS by a bifunctional genetic code, NeuA. de-O-acetylation of Neu5Ac is not exclusive to post-glycosylation modification. it can be used directly as substrates for glycosylation. only the O-acetylated forms at the C7\u20139 were investigated. pepper reported the effects of O-acetylated Neu5Ac on virus hemagglutinin/neuraminidase activities. the presence of O-acetyl groups inhibits bacterial sialidase activities. it remains unclear whether C4 O-acetylation exhibits similar functions.

Modified Sias, specifically O-acetylated isoforms, have been recognized as receptor determinants of virus pathogenesis. different classes of viruses infect the host cell using glycoproteins. most viral families, including orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae, and Adenoviridae, use Sias on host membranes as recognition molecules for attachment and entry."}
