{"summary": "healthcare professionals from two Swedish hospitals were asked to answer a questionnaire before and after training. the questions were relating to physical and mental discomfort and attitudes to CPR. the concern about being infected was reduced with the most marked reduction in physicians. study was approved by the Uppsala Regional Ethics Committee, Sweden. a total of 2614 out of 3165 (83%) employed healthcare professionals agreed to participate in the study. all healthcare professionals had to take part in CPR training at some time during the year. the cardiopulmonary resuscitation training presented to the participants followed the guidelines from the Swedish Resuscitation Council. the use of AEDs is taught in a 4-hours course that includes theory and practical training in basic CPR, use of oxygen and ventilation with mouth-to-mask technique, and use of suction devices for clearing of the airways [2]. questionnaire A questionnaire was designed to collect information about healthcare professionals' attitudes to and experiences of performing CPR. generalized McNemar's test for homogeneity of marginal distributions was used. all analyses were performed using R 9.2 [5]. a total of 2614 out of 3165 (83%) employed healthcare professionals agreed to participate. the cardiopulmonary resuscitation training presented to the participants followed the guidelines from the Swedish Resuscitation Council. the training programme includes theory and practical training in basic CPR, use of oxygen and ventilation with mouth-to-mask technique, and use of suction devices for clearing of the airways. questionnaire was designed to collect information about healthcare professionals' attitudes to and experiences of performing CPR. eity of the marginal distributions was considered statistically significant. a total of 945 (44%) of the participants had performed CPR. of these, 903 participants had performed CPR on adults and 247 on children. 74 +10 0.03 67 +9 0.001 60 +13 0.001 30 +5 NS 60 +10 0.001 Not nervous 53 -5 NS 54 +3 0.01 53 +8 0.001 21 +2 NS 49 +4 0.001 Duty to intervene 98 +3 NS 97 -2 NS 96 +3 NS 92 +4 NS 96 +0 NS Secure in CPR knowledge 70 +18 0.001 71 +14 0.001 68 therapists, social welfare officers, psychologists and biomedical analysts % Proportion of participants with the respective attitude after education Diff. in the group of healthcare professionals that had performed CPR in real life the physicians reduced their fear for infection transmission during CPR from 90% to 14% (P 0.001) pulmonary resuscitation of all different healthcare professionals in the two hospitals. nurses and assistant nurses tended to change their attitudes most among all professions. this may positively affect their willingness to initiate CPR in an actual resuscitation situation. the attitudes expressed in this study can be overcome with education. it remains to be seen if the attitudes expressed in this study can be applied into real-life situations. the attitudes expressed in this study can be overcome with education. no objective analysis of the number of infections among the healthcare professionals was undertaken, which is a limitation. however, we believe that our study presents new data regarding healthcare professionals' attitudes to perform CPR and to use AEDs. be brought face to face with the situation Question: I would consider it my duty to intervene if necessary Question: I know what to do if cardiac arrests occur Question: I would act instinctively Question: If necessary I would manage to take command of the situation Question: yes, no, do not know."}
