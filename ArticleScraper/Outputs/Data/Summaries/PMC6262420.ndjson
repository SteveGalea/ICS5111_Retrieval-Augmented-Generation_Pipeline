{"summary": "uric acid (UA) is the final product of a purine metabolism generated by xanthine oxidase or xanthine dehydrogenase in humans. Approximately two-thirds of the daily produced UA is excreted by the functioning of the kidneys, and the rest is largely excreted through the gastrointestinal tract. the burden on healthcare systems caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. patients and Methods This study was carried out retrospectively at a single peritoneal dialysis center of Changhua Christian Hospital in Taiwan. from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2014, patients who started CAPD as renal replacement therapy for ESRD were screened for this study. the primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. blood tests consisting of white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphate (ALP), uric acid, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were checked at the laboratory of Changhua Christian Hospital. 6.6\u20137.6 mg/dL; tertile 3 7.7 mg/dL. skewed continuous data were compared by analysis of variance. hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). the relationship between UA and mortality was calculated after excluding the patients taking allopurinol at entry to the study to mitigate the confounding effect of hypouricemic agents on serum UA level. a total of 126 participants (25.6%) were taking hypouricemic agent (allopurinol) at baseline. men 80 (47.1%) 82 (50.3%) 74 (46.5%) 0.76 Age (years) 58 14.8 52.9 14 49.4 15.8 0.001 Body mass index (kg/m2) 22.7 (20.6\u201325.2) 23.8 (21.1\u201326.7) 23.2 (20.7\u201326.6) 0.09 Smoker 0.45 never 134 (78.8%) 137 (84.1%) 131 (82.4%) current 5 (2.9%) 5 (3.1%) 2 (1.3%) ever 31 (18.2%) 21 0.001 Serum albumin (g/dL) 3.3 (2.9\u20133.7) 3.4 (3\u20133.9) 3.4 (3.1\u20133.9) 0.01 Hemoglobin (g/dL) 8.79 (8\u20139.5) 8.7 (7.8\u20139.4) 8.6 (7.4\u20139.4) 0.09 BUN (mg/dL) 76.5 (64\u201390) 82 (68\u201396) 92 (76\u2013109) 0.001 Creatinine (mg/dL 16 (12\u201323) 0.92 Intact PTH (pg/mL) 312.17 (184\u2013445.5) 350.8 (200.67\u2013544) 375.8 (196\u2013641) 0.06 Comorbidities Hypertension 146 (85.9%) 139 (85.3%) 134 (84.3%) 0.92 Diabetes mellitus 66 (38.8%) 64 (39.3%) 49 (30.8%) 0.21 Cardiovascular disease 69 (40.6%) 64 (39.3%) 53 all-cause mortality rate showed a stepwise decrease from UA tertile 1 to UA tertile 3 (37.1%, 27%, 12.6%, respectively; p 0.001). compared with the UA tertile 1, UA tertile 3 was associated with a lower risk of overall mortality. 0.87 0.99 (0.59\u20131.67) 0.97 0.81 (0.37\u20131.66) 0.58 Tertile 3 0.49 (0.29\u20130.82) 0.006 0.44 (0.23\u20130.86) 0.02 0.52 (0.21\u20131.16) 0.14 Model 2 Tertile 2 1.02 (0.68\u20131.51) 0.94 1.03 (0.61\u20131.72) 0.92 0.83 (0.38\u20131.71) 0.62 Tertile 3 0.46 (0.27\u20130.76) 0.003 0.48 (0.25\u20130.93) model 3: adjusted for model 2 covariates and comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and Charlson score); model 4: adjusted for model 3 covariates and peritoneal dialysis related parameters (weekly total Kt/V urea, normalized protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA), dialysate-to-plasma (D/P) creatinine. a stepwise decrease from UA tertile 1 to UA tertile 3. there were no statistically significant differences in the risk of infection-associated mortality among the sex-specific tertiles. tertile 3 0.51 (0.31\u20130.84) 0.007 0.46 (0.24\u20130.88) 0.02 0.46 (0.17\u20131.24) 0.12 Model 3 Tertile 2 0.82 (0.54\u20131.24) 0.34 0.89 (0.37\u20131.65) 0.53 Tertile 3 0.43 (0.26\u20130.69) 0.001 0.42 (0.22\u20130.78) 0.007 0.39 (0.15\u20131.05) 0.06 Model 4 Tertile 2 0.86 (0.58\u20131.29) 0.47 0.98 (0 model 4: adjusted for model 3 covariates and peritoneal dialysis (PD) related parameters (weekly total Kt/V urea, normalized protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA), dialysate-to-plasma (D/P) creatinine at 4 h, ultrafiltration, 24-h urine output, and residual renal function. similar association was noted when we treated UA as a continuous variable. all-Cause Mortality Cardiovascular Mortality Infection-Associated Mortality HR (95% CI) p-Value p for Interaction HR (95% CI) p-Value p for Interaction mortality risk for every 1-mg/dL increase in serum uric acid level Total cohort All patients (n = 492) 0.79 (0.69\u20130.9) 0.001 0.25 0.8 (0.68\u20130.96) 0.01 0.44 0.67 (0.53\u20130.84) 0.00 the correlation of UA with other Parameters Table 5 listed the significant association between UA and clinical parameters at baseline. serum UA level was positively correlated with male gender, albumin, BUN, iPTH, phosphorus, triglyceride, CV disease, and residual renal function. 4.8.

Xia et al. conducted a large investigation of 985 PD patients in south china. found an elevated level of UA was an independent risk factor for all-cause and CV mortality in men, but not in women, treated with PD. a multicenter study of 2264 patients on chronic PD in china reported contrasting results. contradictory results relating UA to outcomes were partly attributed to the dual effects of UA on CV outcomes. hyperuricemia is closely related to the established conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as DM, hypertension, older age, and male gender. hyperuricemia has been reported to accelerate residual renal function decline which is a strong predictor of patient mortality in PD patients. so-called \"reverse epidemiology\" cannot be completely excluded. inflammatory cytokines appear to cause low UA as a result of impaired renal tubular reabsorption of urate. inflammatory cytokines appear to cause low UA as a result of impaired net renal tubular reabsorption of urate. a single measurement of UA at baseline might underestimate or over-estimate the true relationship with study outcomes. despite these limitations, we believe this study contributes to the rather limited knowledge of the predictive value of UA in CAPD patients."}
