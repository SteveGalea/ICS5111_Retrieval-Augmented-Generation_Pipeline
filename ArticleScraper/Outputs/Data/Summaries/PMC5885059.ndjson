{"summary": "the system was piloted in 74 LGs in Chiang Mai, Thailand, with the participation of 296 volunteer reporters. volunteers monitored animal and human diseases, as well as environmental problems, in their communities. results were based on performance: A (good), B (fair), and C (poor), with the majority categorized into group B. a key strategy to avert pandemics is the early detection of pathogen occurrence or disease outbreak in domestic animals. in 2004, an AI outbreak (subtype H5N1) resulted in more than 500 human infections worldwide. the link between disease in backyard chickens and potential for a global human influenza pandemic requires a holistic view of human, animal, and environmental health. developed in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and is called Participatory One Health Disease Detection (PODD) a key strategy to avert pandemics is the early detection of pathogen occurrence or disease outbreak in domestic animals. a key strategy to avert pandemics is the early detection of pathogen occurrence or disease outbreak in domestic animals. participationatory one health disease Detection is a digital disease surveillance tool. the system was developed in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and is called Participatory One Health Disease Detection (PODD) the system is a digital disease surveillance tool with three parts: data reporting to a data collection system via a mobile phone. the status of any given report was changed to \u201csuspected outbreak\u201d only after the report had been verified. if the investigative team detected multiple cases of an infectious disease in either a household or a village, the \u201csuspected outbreak\u201d status was changed to \u201cfinish\u201d. all events\u2014related to animal health, human health, or environmental problems\u2014were sent to the PODD epicenter to detect whether any relationship exists between them with respect to place or time. if the link between different events was detected, animal and public health authorities and communities would be notified. the PODD program had to make several concerted efforts to help participating communities in developing their ability to prevent and control animal epidemics sustainably. the program included developing contingency plans for LGs to address abnormal animal deaths; establishing a revolving fund for a chicken vaccination campaign; and providing knowledge via a training on prevention and control of disease in chickens. the diseases themselves (ie, based on case definitions, as presented in Textbox 1) enter their observations into the PODD system. the list of animal diseases, human diseases, and environmental problems is provided in the PODD mobile app. reporters can take a photo, indicate location, and send data to public health authority via the PODD app. the authorities must check and investigate all reports: food poisoning Dirty restaurant/ butcher Toxic mushroom Suspected contaminated food (chemical/biological/physical) Low quality meat Low quality food The following problems, all of which still occur in several places across Thailand, were added to the PODD app. a total of 300 volunteers from 75 LGs were recruited to be PODD volunteers in the community. volunteers reported abnormal animal sicknesses and deaths, animal diseases, animal bites, food safety issues, human diseases, and environmental problems. the status of the reports was immediately changed to \"insignificant report\" volunteer reporter was asked to continue monitoring of the case once a week. if investigative team detected multiple cases of an infectious disease in either household or village, the \u201csuspected outbreak\u201d status was changed to \u201cfinish\u201d only after the outbreak had been controlled. participation one health disease Detection System was designed for villagers to serve as volunteer reporters and LGs to take responsibility for controlling outbreaks within their jurisdictions. 74 LGs in each of the 25 districts in all regions of Chiang Mai Province participated in the pilot study. the pilot study area covered urban, rural areas, including mountainous area. training on prevention and control of disease in chickens program was an integrated effort among LGs, the PODD project team, and district DLD offices. training on prevention and control of disease in chickens program was an integrated effort among LGs, the PODD project team, and district DLD offices. reporters can take a photo, indicate location, and send the data to public health authority via the PODD mobile app. zoonoses with high impacts on human health need to be controlled early to limit disease spreading. food poisoning Dirty restaurant/ butcher Toxic mushroom Suspected contaminated food (chemical/biological/physical) Low price meat Low quality food The following problems, all of which still occur in several places across Thailand, were added to the PODD app. reporters report humans who have been bit by animals, particularly dogs and cats, and then follow the animals for 10 days after the biting. 3 groups of LGs (A-C) and 4 groups of volunteers (A-D) were identified. majority of LGs (34/74, 46%) were categorized into group B. most were in group C (15/74, 20%; Table 1). the primary goal of the PODD system is to detect emerging diseases in animals before it spreads to humans. of these, 98.82% (112,571/113,911) indicated that conditions were normal in their communities, whereas 1.18% (1340/113,911) reported abnormal events. the majority of abnormal reports were of sick or dead animals. vulsion, paralysis, diarrhea, edema eyelids, depression, loss of appetite, and sudden death were reported in 10 households. the PODD epicenter verified the cases and classified them as a \u201csuspected outbreak\u201d a disease investigation team was sent into the field 3 days later. scores of volunteers were classified using the results of the outcome mapping process. the results included regularity of reporting, participation in training, leadership, enthusiasm, and possibility of being a role model for other volunteers. the majority of volunteers were categorized into group B. a total of 113,911 reports were sent by volunteers during the first 16 months of the PODD operation. 98.82% (112,571/113,911) indicated that conditions were normal in their communities, whereas 1.18% (1340/113,911) reported abnormal events. majority of abnormal reports were of sick or dead animals, followed by zoonoses and other human diseases. a chicken disease outbreak occurred in a 50-chicken household in the northern part of Chiang Mai. clinical signs in the chickens included convulsion, paralysis, diarrhea, edema eyelids, depression, loss of appetite, and sudden death. the outbreak was reported through the PODD app by a volunteer in mid-March 2016. disease surveillance has played an important role in global health security. since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza between 2003 and 2005, disease surveillance has played an important role in global health security. community and DLD officers enabled early detection of a backyard chicken disease outbreak. the outbreak was controlled within 7 days, which was faster than the time taken by a traditional system to respond. in Tanzania, the Epicollect mobile app was implemented with the One Health approach for infectious disease surveillance."}
