{"summary": "nasopharyngeal aspirates were prospectively collected from children 5 years presenting with ARI over one year to a paediatric A&E department. disease severity was grouped according to presence of lower respiratory tract signs, need for hospital admission and need for oxygen. acute respiratory infection (ARI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality with a worldwide disease burden estimated at 112 900 000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) ARI causes about 20% of all deaths in pre-school children worldwide, with 90% of these deaths being due to pneumonia. syncytial virus (RSV), hMPV, Rhinoviruses (hRV) and Para-influenza viruses (PIV) have consistently been shown to predominate. some displaying strong seasonal peaks and with co-infection with more than one viral pathogen occurring in 4\u201333% of children. few studies have attempted to determine whether particular viruses are associated with different severities of disease. research assistant approached consecutive patients with ARI between 7 am and 3 pm. subjects included upper and/or lower respiratory tract manifestations of ARI of less than 7 days duration. bronchiolitis was diagnosed in children 18 months with upper respiratory symptoms preceded lower respiratory symptoms of wheeze, tachypnoea and signs of respiratory distress. upper respiratory tract infections were diagnosed based on symptoms such as coryza, earache, sore throat and stridor. nucleic acid extraction Each NPA was diluted in 3 mls of normal saline before being centrifuged at 500 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. time from sample collection to freezing was less than four hours in all cases. PCRs with RNA targets utilised 10 ul purified nucleic acid from the Qiasymphony with the Roche LC480 Probes Master kit. all assays were performed in a lightcycler 480 real-time PCR machine (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK) R AAAGGGCTATAAAGAGAGAATAAGGTATTCT 0.4 229E (HEX)\u2013 CCCTGACGACCACGTTGTGGTTTTCA \u2013(BHQ1) 0.16 HKU1 F TTACTTTCCACACTTTTCATCTCTCTG 0.4 HKU1 (LC640)\u2013 CGCCCACTTGAAGCGCACCG \u2013(BHQ2) 0.16 CMA-3plx Cpp F CAAGGGCTATAAAGGCGTTGCT all oligonucleotides were purchased from Metabion Ltd, Germany. Statistical analysis Differences in pathogen prevalence between disease severity categories or different clinical manifestations were examined using a Fisher Exact test. baseline observations including temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory and pulse rates were recorded at the time of consulting the A&E department. bronchiolitis was diagnosed in children with fever, tachypnoea and respiratory distress. nucleic acid extraction Each NPA was diluted in 3 mls of normal saline before being centrifuged at 500 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. the resultant cell pellet was resuspended in a solution of 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma \u2013 Aldrich, Brazil) and then frozen, along with the supernatant, at 70\u00b0C. thermal cycling conditions were as described previously,[18] except for removal of the 50\u00b0C hold for reverse transcription. the enzyme activation hold at 95\u00b0C was extended to five minutes for the Roche LC 480 Probe Master kit.

Combined prevalence was greater than 100% because of co-infection. the commonest pathogens in co-infected samples were AdV (528%), RSV (441%), hBoV (416%), hRV (267%) and Mpp (193%) the most frequent combinations were RSV/hBoV (161% of co-infections) and RSV/AdV (112%). children with RSV and Mpp infection were more likely to have moderate or severe than mild disease (* p0.05). children with RSV and Mpp infection were more likely to be hospitalised than children without these pathogens. prevalence was greater than 100% because of co-infection. only Mpp infection was more commonly associated with pneumonia than bronchiolitis. hBoV was more commonly associated with EVW/asthma than bronchiolitis. 43% of the children came from households with at least one smoker. the mean household income was US$275 (160), which is approximately half the average monthly income in Brazil. 43% of mothers and 44% of fathers had completed the national compulsory nine years education. half of the children were admitted to the hospital wards and three died. the commonest pathogens in single infections (n = 187; 459% total samples) were RSV (433%) and hRV (182%) with AdV and hBoV compris a much smaller percentage (86% and 48% respectively) the most frequent combinations were RSV/hBoV (161% of co-infections) and RSV/AdV (112%). 57% (n = 23) children had very mild disease, 425% (173) mild disease, 415% (169) moderate disease and 103% (42) severe disease. most pathogens were represented within each of the disease severity groups. children were discharged with a diagnosis of URTI, 518% (211) with bronchiolitis, 268% (109) with pneumonia, 135% (55) with EVW/asthma and 22% (9) with another diagnosis (whooping cough, pneumonia with pleural effusion and bronchiolitis obliterans) only Mpp infection was more commonly associated with pneumonia than bronchiolitis. seasonal distribution RSV, hMPV and Mpp exhibited strong seasonal patterns. hMPV and hRV were endemic throughout the year. in the year studied, different PIVs circulated at different times of year. the study screened for more pathogens than previous studies and included hBoV, a virus particularly prevalent in pre-school children. most came from low-income families living in urban slums, where overcrowding is common. hRV primer set used in this study does not detect all hRV genotypes (e.g. hRV-72), which could lead to underrepresentation. over 80% of children in this study had mild or moderate disease. most pathogens were detected across all disease severity categories. co-infection was consistently between 39\u201342% across all groups. severe disease was no more or less common in those children in which pathogens were not detected. however, we did not investigate pathogen prevalence in asymptomatic children. of the morbidity and mortality associated with ARI lies."}
