{"summary": "acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are worldwide a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. these factors increase the inflammatory burden in the lower airways, overwhelming the protective anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms and thus leading to tissue damage. combining bacterial and viral infection can be identified in 25% of exacerbations. this increased severity is not confirmed by all studies. Neither clinical nor biological markers can reliably distinguish between virus induced exacerbation and exacerbation due to other causes. cigarette smoke enhances parenchymal and airway inflammation, as well as apoptosis, emphysema, and airway fibrosis. these processes are induced by the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) poly(I:C) resulting in early induction of type I interferon (IFN) and IL-18, later induction of IL-12/IL-23 p40 and IFN-, the activation of the adenovirus (HAdV) infections play an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD. latent HAdV infections persist in epithelial airway cells long after the acute infection has been cleared. adenoviral E1A protein can be detected more often in patients with COPD than in healthy subjects. ive tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1)-mRNA and protein expression are up-regulated in E1A-positive HBE cells. both, E1A-positive and E1A-negative HBE cells contain cytokeratin, but only E1A-positive cells express mesenchymal markers vimentin and -smooth muscle actin. adenoviral infection may act as a starter of chronic obstructive bronchitis in children. chronic obstructive bronchitis with inadequate response to inhaled steroid and bronchodilator therapy is a rather rare disorder in this age group. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects negatively the course of COPD. latent infections seem to play an undeniable role in the pathogenesis of the disease. the virus is present in exacerbations but also in times of stable disease. infection with HIV is associated with COPD, accelerated emphysema development, chronic bronchitis, small airways abnormalities, and non-specific airway hyperresponsiveness. these patients are at increased risk for the development of respiratory symptoms even prior to the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related pulmonary complications. human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infects virtually all children by the ages of 5\u201310 years. pathogen may contribute to exacerbation of COPD. it is only detectable in a very small number of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. IFV infection is associated with increased expression of CC-chemokine receptor chemokines. hemagglutinin and neuraminidase play a crucial role in induction of human IFV immunity. annual anti-influenza vaccination is therefore recommended for patients with COPD. trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (TVV) and live cold-adapted influenza virus vaccine (CAIV-T) are more immunogenic than TVV alone. receipt of cold-adapted influenza virus vaccine is associated with temporary stabilization of COPD. acute respiratory illness is associated with a worsening concerning functional status and subjective well-being. human rhinovirus HRV is the causative pathogen in more than half of acute viral infections of the upper respiratory tract. the viruses are associated with acute exacerbations of respiratory disease, including asthma, sinusitis, otitis media, and COPD. the virus can be identified in nearly 20% of exacerbations of COPD [73] frost exacerbators experience significantly more colds than infrequent exacerbators. exacerbation frequency in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with an increased frequency of acquiring common cold. patients experiencing frequent colds have significantly higher exposure to cigarette smoke. in vivo infection of human volunteers with HRV-16 strikingly increases IP-10 protein in nasal lavages during symptomatic colds. levels of IP-10 correlate with symptom severity, viral titer, and numbers of lymphocytes in airway secretions. smoke extract differentially modulates rhinovirus-induced chemokine profiles in human airway epithelial cells. it increases a rhinovirus-induced stimulation of CXCL8 production via mRNA stabilization and inhibits rhinovirus-induced CXCL10 production via transcriptional regulation. antiviral agents are desirable for both prevention and treatment of HRV infections in COPD patients. RSV can lead to activation and recruitment of T-cells that skew the immune response towards more intense pathology, including mucus production and remodeling of the airways. despite contradictious reports, several studies suggest asymptomatic persistence of RSV in COPD patients. pulmonary disease exacerbations can be severe with prolonged recovery times. but viral infection does not appear to have effects on subsequent readmissions or mortality rate. colonization of the lower respiratory tract with bacterial or viral infectious agents results in chronification of inflammatory processes. patients with documented infection do not demonstrate greater increases in sputum levels of inflammatory cytokines during exacerbations. increased plasma fibrinogen and IL-6 levels are further signs of systemic inflammatory effects during COPD exacerbations. picornaviruses are leading in western countries, influenza virus in Asia. the weighted mean prevalences for the respective viruses were 17.3% for picornavirus (7.2\u201327.3%), 7.4% for IFV (2.9\u201312.0%), 5.3% for RSV (1.6\u20139.0%), 3.1% for HCoV (0.4\u20135.8%), 2.6% for HPIV (0.4\u20134.8%), 1.1% for HAdV (0.4\u20133.3) and 0.7% for HMPV (0\u20131.8 cell is the principal site of viral infection in the airways and plays a central role in viral modulation of airway inflammation by the release of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. the epithelium also contributes to the host\u2019s innate defense response to viral infection by releasing products that are antiviral and/or can lead to increased recruitment of dendritic cells and lymphocytes."}
