{"summary": "monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; also named CCL2) is produced by multiple cell types including bladder epithelial cells [1,2] and plays an important role in recruiting monocytes/macrophages as well as other leukocytes to sites during an inflammatory process. genetically deficient mice display decreased macrophage recruitment and activation, increased susceptibility to mucosal infection, and reduced T cell responses. uroplakin peptide-induced autoimmune cystitis model demonstrates the hallmark symptoms of IC/BPS. uRO-MCP-1 model secretes MCP-1 by the bladder epithelium and develops bladder inflammation, pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction upon intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of LPS. ioned sequences and a poly A additional site were microinjected into fertilizing eggs. each generation was confirmed for the presence of the MCP-1 transgene by PCR genotyping using a sequence-specific primer pair. bladder epithelium from an URO-MCP-1 mouse was processed for RT-PCR. pUPII-MCP-1 served as a control for MCP-1 genomic DNA. urine was collected from both C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice. Bladder histology Bladders were collected and processed for formalin fixation, paraffin embedment, section preparation, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and photography as described previously. slides were incubated with biotinylated rat anti-mouse F4/80 antibody. cDNA was synthesized using Invitrogen SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and Oligo dT. PCR amplification was performed on cDNA products using Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) assay (ELISA) Urine was collected using micturition cages. levels of urinary MCP-1 were measured using paired capture and detecting antibodies. mice were placed in individual micturition cages for 24-hour real time recording of voiding habits with 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycles. response frequency was calculated as the percentage of positive response to each filament. a positive response to hind paw stimulation was defined as either a sharp withdrawal or licking of the tested paw. a value of p0.05 was considered statistically significant. transgenic founders backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for 10 generations. each generation was confirmed for the presence of the MCP-1 transgene. PCR was performed for 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for one minute. bladder epithelium from an URO-MCP-1 mouse was processed for RT-PCR. pUPII-MCP-1 served as a control for MCP-1 genomic DNA. uRO-MCP-1 mice express MCP-1 protein in the urine. paraffin embedment, section preparation, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. slides were incubated with biotinylated rat anti-mouse F4/80 antibody. cDNA was synthesized using Invitrogen SuperScript III Replicase. PCR was performed on cDNA products using Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and sequence-specific primer pairs for MCP-1 (5\u2019-CGAGGTCGACTGCAGAAG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TGAGGTGGTTGTGGAAAAGG-3\u2019; 560 bp), IL-1\u00df (5\u2019-GCCCATCCTCTGTGTGACT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-GGAAATTGGTTTGTCG-3\u2019; 339 CP-1 were measured using ELISA with paired capture and detecting antibodies. mice were placed in individual micturition cages for 24-hour real time recording of voiding habits with 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycles. the cages consist of a fluid receptacle that funnels the captured urine droplets into a specimen freezer. a positive response to hind paw stimulation was defined as either a sharp withdrawal or licking of the tested paw. a value of p0.05 was considered statistically significant. compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice (n = 7; score: 0\u2014+), mice developed clear histological bladder inflammation (n = 8; score: ++\u2014+++) 24 hours after intravesical instillation of a single sub-noxious dose of LPS (1 g of LPS in 100 l PBS) bladders of URO-MCP-1 mice express increased inflammatory factor mRNAs after cystitis induction. bladder total RNAs were extracted 24 hours after intravesical PBS or LPS treatment and analyzed by RT-PCR. mice were evaluated for voiding habits using micturition cages before (baseline) and 1, 3 and 7 days after intravesical PBS or LPS treatment. there were no significant changes in voiding habits compared to baseline voiding habits for both URO-MCP-1 and C57BL/6 mice. Fig 3 represents the typical voiding habits of C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice before (baseline) and one day after intravesical PBS or LPS treatment. total voided volumes in 24 hours were similar between PBS- and LPS-treated URO-MCP-1 mice. both wild-type C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice were treated intravesically with 100 l PBS or 1 g of LPS in 100 l PBS. both mice were evaluated for voiding habits using micturition cages at 1, 3 and 7 days after intravesical treatment. both wild-type C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice were evaluated for pelvic pain using von Frey filament stimulation. there were no significant differences in baseline pelvic responses between C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice or in pelvic response changes after PBS treatment in both mouse strains. BL/6 (top panels) and URO-MCP-1 mice were treated intravesically with 100 l PBS or 1 g of LPS in 100 l PBS. baseline pelvic responses were included for comparison. the same C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice exhibited no significant changes in tactile sensitivity. URO-MCP-1 mice exhibit bladder hypersensitivity and develop bladder inflammation upon intravesical administration of a single sub-noxious dose of LPS. the bladder inflammation peaked at days 1\u20133 and diminished by day 7. the bladder inflammation peaked at days 1\u20133 and diminished by day 7. bladders of both C57BL/6 (n = 7) and URO-MCP-1 mice (n = 8) were instilled with 100 l PBS (top panel) or 1 g of LPS in 100 l PBS (bottom panel) after 24 hours the bladders were collected and processed. mice were evaluated for voiding habits using micturition cages before (baseline) and 1, 3 and 7 days after intravesical PBS or LPS treatment. there were no significant changes in voiding habits after intravesical PBS treatment compared to baseline voiding habits for both URO-MCP-1 and C57BL/6 mice. Fig 3 represents the typical voiding habits of C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice before (baseline) and one day after intravesical PBS or LPS treatment. total voided volumes in 24 hours were similar between PBS- and LPS-treated URO-MCP-1 mice. both wild-type C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice were treated intravesically with 100 l PBS or 1 g of LPS in 100 l PBS. the baseline voiding habits were included for comparison. wild-type C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice were evaluated for pelvic pain using von Frey filament stimulation. there were no significant differences in baseline pelvic responses between C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice or in pelvic response changes after PBS treatment in both mouse strains. both wild-type C57BL/6 and URO-MCP-1 mice were treated intravesically with 100 l PBS or 1 g of LPS in 100 l PBS. the baseline pelvic responses were included for comparison. the results are representative of 8 mice in each group. URO-MCP-1 mice do not spontaneously develop bladder inflammation, pelvic pain and voiding dysfunction in the unmanipulated state. however, the urothelial expression of MCP-1 alone is not sufficient to cause bladder inflammation and functional changes in these mice. inflamed bladders expressed elevated mRNAs for proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u00df and IL-6. inflamed bladders also expressed elevated mRNAs for NGF and substance P precursor (a neurotransmitter), suggesting a strong neuro-immune interaction. the URO-MCP-1 model described in this study represents an acute cystitis model. future studies will focus on extending this model to a chronic cystitis model to more closely mimic human IC/BPS."}
