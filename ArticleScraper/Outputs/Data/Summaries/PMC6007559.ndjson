{"summary": "a total of thirty bovine and two human brain tissue samples belonging to twenty-one rabies outbreaks were amplified and sequenced. the phylogenetic analysis was performed using the maximum likelihood method and GTR + G + I model included in Mega 6. the human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of AIDS. over 39 million people have died due to this disease worldwide. the pathogenicity of SIV in chimpanzees is unclear. the ultimate goal of this study is silencing of putative transmission-responsible genes in the future by the development of transgenics. information on gene expression and control in the target insect is necessary for this goal. there are differentially expressed downregulated genes such as ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase/protease ubiquitin specific protease [Culex quinquefasciatus], ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, Apis mellifera, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2-like. the population of vervet monkeys on the island of St. Kitts is considered to be almost equal to that of humans. some juvenile monkeys are caught by locals, and are caged and/or used for entertaining tourists (tourism animals) the presence of rotaviruses and picobirnaviruses in the fecal samples remains uncharacterized. genome sequencing and sequence analysis will be performed on select virus strains to study the genetic diversity of rotaviruses and picobirnaviruses in this part of the world. fected cells using polyclonal flavivirus group antibodies confirmed by RT-PCR. nucleotide (47.4%) and amino acid (39.8%) identity was observed with nounan\u00e9 virus (NOUV) pairwise comparison of the NS5 region, nucleotide identity was observed with IGUV (69.8%), Naranjal virus (69.6%) and Bussuquara virus (69.3%). type 1 PRRSV is further divided into at least three subtypes. but until now only subtype 1 has been detected in western Europe and North America. vaccinations are widely used and vaccinations are widely used. main objective was to assess the diversity of circulating PRRS viruses in pigs. phage KAZ14 is a T4-like myovirus which infects Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli 01 (APEC 01) and lactamase producing E. coli isolated from chickens. APEC 01 causes colibacillosis in poultry leading to huge economic losses in the poultry industry. since 2009 there has been a surge in novel reassortant HPAI H5 viruses, mostnotably H5N8 in 2013. the virus epidemic provides an opportunity to investigate the factors behind HPAI emergence in much more detail than before. sixty-three randomly selected veterinary practices in five european countries were asked to collect oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from their feline patients. RT-PCR was conducted on all isolates followed by consensus sequencing. a total of 140 samples tested positive for FCV (9.2%) clinical poultry samples will be tested for the presence of IBV. positive samples will be sequenced and analyzed alongside other strains of IBV worldwide and the strains used for the vaccination program. the prevalence of HVP2 in baboons was determined by detection of anti-HVP 2 antibodies in sera from 189 baboons captured from different regions using ELISA. 90% of the female and 83% of the male baboons were seropositive for HVP2 antibodies. this information will greatly enhance the use of baboons as models to study the pathogenesis of HSV and test vaccine strategies. 1,300 known species, some of which are vectors for livestock viruses. insect light-trapping was performed in different ecozones throughout Trinidad. serotypes and strains of BTV and EHDV circulating in livestock in Trinidad. phylogenetic analysis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seroconverters in Sydney, Australia: 2004\u20132013 A. Pinto,1,* F. Di Giallonardo,2 A. Carrera,3 A. Shaik,1 P. Cunningham,4 D. Cooper,1 and A. Kelleher1. previous local seroconverter studies have differed from international rates of transmitted drug resistance. 10/25(40%) of TDR sequences were associated with clusters of other TDRs. rates of TDR in NSW are lower than that reported in other states of australia and overseas. the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epidemic in the Caribbean is mostly driven by the dissemination of the pandemic clade B and of older non-pandemic B lineages. the low number of sequences from most Caribbean Islands limits the information about the timing and the migration patterns of HIV-1B in the region. HIV-1 CRF 02_AG (MART: 5%; GUA, 7%; SMART, 11%; Hati 15%,) as HIV-1 Subtype D (MART: 0.8%; GUA 1.5%) are also circulating. next steps are to establish the prevalence of the BCAR clades. higiene e Medicina Tropical, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal and 6Unidade de Sade Pblica Internacional e Bioestatstica, Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal. a low number of clusters with subtype G patients displaying TDR indicates a different pattern in the subtype G epidemic compared with subtype B. the infection spreads with different dynamics across ethnically and culturally diverse populations, reflecting differences in risk behavior. between 2005 and 2013 the number of infected MSM increased 2.89-fold, compared with 1.63- and 1.27-fold for IVDU and Ethiopian-origin residents. phylogenies were reconstructed with Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. transmitted drug resistance was highest in subtype B (13%) a retrospective study uses sequence and HIV drug-resistance data from individuals enrolled in clinical research studies at Georgetown University in Washington DC. a total of 314 HIV pol gene sequences were collected from 1994 to 2013. the analysis of the viral population before and after ASCT could address the origin of HIV blood reservoir after ASCT. the analysis of the viral population before and after ASCT could help address the origin of HIV blood reservoir after ASCT. studies show 16% transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in the USA with regional heterogeneity. little is known about TDR in Washington DC despite high HIV prevalence of 2.5%. thirty-one had > 1 TAM, decreasing prevalence between 1994\u20135 and 2007\u201313. most common NNRTI mutations were 103N (2.8%), and 181C (1.4%), and PI mutations were 54V (1.8%) and 90M (2.3%) from 2007 to 2013. a total of 262 HIV-infected specimens from voluntary testing and pregnant women participating in a PMTCT program were characterized. analysis of 172 env sequences showed a high level of strain diversity. eight different subtypes (33.1%), five CRFs (18.6%) and unclassified (4.7%) sequences were also found. surveillance surveys documented two separate HIV outbreaks with rapid spread among people who inject drugs. the first occurred in Cebu City, where HIV prevalence in PWID rose from 1% in 2009 to 56% in 2010. the second took place in the neighboring Mandaue City, where HIV prevalence in PWID increased from 3.5% in 2011 to 38% in 2013. the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epidemic in So Paulo is dominated by subtypes B, F1 and. population sequencing was performed on plasma viral RNA for 179 patients. the more prevalent subtypes were B (74%), C (12.3%), F (5.6%) and BF1 recombinants (5.6%), BC recombinants (1%) and subtypes D and G (1%) were also found. the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epidemic is characterized by a high genetic diversity with several circulating subtypes. previous studies have shown that subtype B is the predominant genetic form in Cuba. the evolutionary history of this viral variant in Cuba is still not clear. the HIV-1 subtype B was introduced in Cuba in the late 1970s. this supported the idea of subtype B introduction in Cuba from North America and Europe. the results presented herein provide new insights concerning the epidemic of HIV-1 subtype B. analysis of sequence classified as CRF06_cpx/G indicated no evidence of recombination, suggesting that it is a pure subtype. results confirm the presence of multiple URFs of HIV-1 in the recently diagnosed seropositive population. pol gene sequencing was performed using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Abbott Laboratories, USA) thirty-two (64%) were HIV-1 infected between 2010 and 2014. we performed high-resolution HLA class-I typing and near-full length HIV genome sequencing from sixty-five chronically infected HIV-positive individuals. phylogenetic reconstruction was performed by neighbor-joining and only bootstrap scores >90% were accepted. the number of escape mutations was positively correlated with CD4 count (P = 0.044) and negatively correlated with viral load (P = 0.023). pathogen genomics enhancing understanding of epidemic transmission of infectious diseases using human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) as an example. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has proven difficult to protect against by vaccination due in part to its ability to induce and tolerate high levels of mutation. in natural HIV-1 infection, a majority of patients generate moderate breadth after 2\u20134 years. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epidemic in south brazil is driven by subtype C (HIV-1C) in contrast to a dominance of subtype B in other Brazilian regions. a Bayesian phylogeographic Generalized Linear Model approach was used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of HIV-1C in Brazil. the prevalence of HIV, as well as the population size of subtype C, are factors driving the epidemic expansion towards the north of Brazil. we determined subtypes for 102,153 polymerase sequences reported to the US National HIV Surveillance System between 2001 and 2014. the majority of these discordant sequences (12,624, 74.6%) were subtype B, followed by C (1,309, 7.7%), CRF02_AG (917, 5.4%), A1 (418, 2.5%), CRF01_AE (337, 2.0%), unique recombinant forms (203, 1.1%), G (186, 1.1 HIV-1 pol sequences of samples classified as recent are analyzed by molecular-epidemiological methods. a maximum likelihood tree analysis was performed to identify transmission clusters and putative new variants. a putative clade of an unclassified URF was identified. the project is to extend and support the ML analyses by Bayesian inference and to identify transmission chains. despite advances in human immunodeficiency virus prevention, >1,000 new diagnoses are reported in NC annually. clusters originated 1997\u20132004, spanned mean 12.7 years, and all grew from 2009 to 2014. large clusters have expanded for >10 years, and continue to grow, particularly among young men. the primary objective of this study is to analyze the patterns of genetic diversity of HIV-1 in the Caribbean and describe the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 drug resistance. the pol and env gene sequences obtained from HIV-1 genotyping for drug resistance will be collected within the country member states of the Caribbean Public health agency and the Caribbean HIV-DR network. the evolutionary history of DENV-2 that has been circulating in the Bucaramanga metropolitan area is unknown. we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree based on Bayesian analysis. the analyses revealed that Colombian strains were grouped in four viral lineages showing different dispersal routes toward Colombia. research aims to evaluate the presence of dengue virus (DENV) in bats. research aims to identify ecological, environmental, anthropogenic and virological factors that could involve the bat in a viral transmission cycle. a38 Genetic diversity and viral fitness studies of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) isolated during the 2013 outbreak in Costa Rica. sixteen isolates were successfully recovered and their serotyping showed dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) as the main circulating serotype. the extent to which viral diversity accrues in infected hosts influences aspects such as pathogenesis, transmission and host immunity. the extent to which viral diversity accrues in infected hosts influences aspects such as pathogenesis, transmission and host immunity. dengue viruses have been identified as the most important arboviral pathogen in the world. they are transmitted by mosquitoes of Aedes species. about 1\u20132% of infections may produce clinically severe Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever. five lineages of DENV-1 (BR1st\u2013BR5th), genotype V were introduced to the country from the Caribbean region (BR1st\u2013BR3rd) and Venezuela (Br4th\u2013BR5th) no positive selection was associated with the introduction of lineages to Brazil or SJRP, but six amino acid substitutions were associated. chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus, causes acute fever and joint pain in humans. chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus, causes acute fever and joint pain in humans. the recombinant strain, KJ679578/India/2011 (ECSA III), derives from viruses of ECSA III and ECSA I. our study demonstrates that recombination is an additional mechanism of genetic diversity in CHIKV that might assist in cross-species transmission process. anti-CHIKV mAbs would have to be broadly cross-reactive against existing CHIKV variants. we will also compare to global CHIKV sequences derived from the wider Americas. whole genome sequences derived to date confirm the presence of the Asian genotype in Trinidad. purpose more than 100 clinical field isolates were collected from across India over the span of 4 years (2010\u201313) all the clinical samples, along with CHIKV passaged six times in vero cells in vitro, were subjected to clinical, molecular and next generation whole genome analysis. activity of the virus was studied via viral load experiments, plaque assays, quantitative PCR and Sanger sequencing, before further processing for whole genome sequencing. around 10% of the clinical diagnoses of dengue febrile cases in Latin America have been estimated to be VEEV ID or IE enzootic infections. only enzootic VEEV ID and IE circulate in Panama, and the last VEEV Panamanian strains described were isolated in 2010. evo le\u00f3n, San Nicol\u00e1s de los Garza, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico, 2Laboratorio Estatal de Salud Pblica de Oaxaca, Carretera a Sola de Vega, Km 18.5,

myalgia, fever, rhinorrhea, malaise, headaches and coughing. the number of patients hospitalized and ambulatory patients with multiple infections was more than twice the number with single infection by pandemic H1N1/09 virus. all influenza B, A (H3N2) and A (H1N1)pdm09 isolates tested were susceptible to zanamivir. 224 had the most commonly detected marker, S31N. more than half of the viruses characterized were resistant to adamantanes. despite this prevalence, there are scarce genomic data from European SIV. of these, 180 contain internal genes derived from the EA lineage, and seventy-nine have complete EA genotypes. these data allow for analysis of the phylogeography and molecular evolution of EA viruses in Europe. mutations were found at the known neutralizing epitope sites. no intertypic recombination was detected, but intratypic recombination signals were found. the estimated mean substitution rate of genotype I worldwide was 3.27 104 substitutions/site/year. many new HCV-4a gene sequences have been obtained since 1993. the different phylodynamic approaches sometimes disagree on virus dynamics prior to PAT initiation. this would support my long-term aim of developing richer and more informative Bayesian phylodynamic models. forty female patients with symptomatic acute HCV infection were identified at the Viral Hepatitis Laboratory, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction products were submitted to direct nucleotide sequencing of the NS5B region. sequences were aligned with corresponding nucleotide sequences of twenty-three HCV reference sequences retrieved from GenBank. a variant of genotype I HDV was encountered that was initially misdiagnosed as genotype II. a further nucleotide analysis revealed a selectively neutral mutation at the single SmaI restriction site within the B cell epitope, which caused these three strains to be falsely categorized as genotype II. we used seven different codon usage bias tools and indexes targeting synonymous codon usage. this included GC content, ENC, SCUO, Codon Volatility, RSCU, Odds ratios and Graphical Codon Usage Analysis tool. there was variation in GC content, nucleoprotein gene, Z-protein gene, S-protein gene and polymerase gene. sapovirus (SaV) and norovirus (NoV) in children with acute gastroenteritis. most studies of gastroenteritis caused by viruses are limited to Rotavirus and norvirus (NoV) V detection was performed using SaV124F, SaV1F, SaV5F and SaV1245R as primers. genotyping was performed using the sequence from the product of SaV F22 SaV R2 primers for a partial capsid region. preliminary data indicates the prevalence of NoV was 38%, with noV GII as the main genotype found in the specimens. rotavirus is the major diarrhoeal pathogen in humans and other mammals. it is important to sequence the entire eleven-segment genome to understand diversity, evolution and zoonotic chatter. enteroviruses are a common cause of illness in infants and children. in 2014, the global reemergence of human enterovirus 68 (EV-D68) commonly associated with severe respiratory illness was identified with outbreaks occurring in the USA and Canada. ten arboviruses were discovered in the 1950s\u201390s in brazil. the virus includes: Catu, Itaqui, Enseada, Tacaiuma, Capim and Apeu. the viruses include: Bujaru and Anhanga virus. the genomes were obtained using a de novo assembly strategy. the reads were quality-filtered using the program FastQC v0.11.3. any adapter sequences were removed using Trimmomatic-0.33 software. 156 patients with chronic HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B treated with adefovir dipivoxil. each mutation found was logit modeled over time, clustered and visualized by heat-map. results promising to better understand evolution of HBV under nucleotide inhibitor treatment. the cervicovaginal microbiome plays an important role in female reproductive health, affecting rates of preterm-birth and neonate mortality. despite its importance, little is known about how cervicovaginal microbiome communities differ in function and how their constituent members interact with each other. the cervical microbiome of the forty-four controls revealed two predominant genera, Lactobacillus and Gardnerella. 80% of control samples were dominated by one or more species of Lactobacillus that constituted 86% of all Illumina reads. the mortality rate from filovirus infection can approach 90%. there are currently no approved filovirus vaccines or therapeutics. our collaborative work has uncovered unique features of filovirus transcription, replication, protein translation and innate immune evasion. the scale, duration, and complexity of the outbreak in west africa have underscored the need for prompt and effective implementation of evidence-based containment measures. it is critical that all potential contacts of suspect, probable and confirmed Ebola cases are systemically identified and put under observation for 21 days from the last day of contact. emergence or disappearance of iSNPs can help us identify biological bottlenecks shaping the viral quasispecies. emergence or disappearance of iSNPs can help identify biological processes to disrupt during design of vaccines and therapeutics. inferring outbreak transmission trees from epidemiologic and genomic data produces better results than epidemiological tracing alone. deep sequencing data available for over 200 Ebola virus genomes from 2013 to 2015 epidemic in Western Africa. human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a paramyxovirus associated with acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract infection in young children worldwide. based on phylogeny, the closest virus to HMPV is the Avian metapneumovirus type C. 158 individuals screened using DENV and CHIKV specific reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCRs) CHIKV was detected in 19% (n = 30) and DENV in 5.1% (n = 8; six DENV-1, one DENV-3, one DENV-4) of cases. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are important public health problems in Trinidad and tobago. serum samples from thirty individuals who were RT-qPCR negative for DENV and CHIKV were also subjected to Illumina sequencing resulting in the detection of CHIKV in three additional individuals. Detailed analyses of the water chemistry have revealed dramatic differences in the samples, particularly in terms of carbon, iron and calcium content. a decline in yields by >50% was observed in some sweet potato fields in barbados. symptoms of yellowing, swollen leaf veins and deep grooves on the tubers suggested the possibility of Sweet potato virus disease. SVPD is a complex synergy of several virus species belonging to the two main genera: Potyviridae and Closterivirdiae. driverNet is a pathway-based method that uses a gene interaction network in the form of an adjacency matrix. an enriched data set was produced that included 11,648 genes and 211,894 edges. an enriched data set was produced that included 211,894 edges. the presence of CRISPR spacer elements within the analyzed genome may represent a chronological order of the acquisition of protospacer sequences from prior infections by Mobile Genetic Elements (MGEs) the presence of CRISPR spacer elements within the analyzed genome was then used to manually annotate proteins and spacer sequences using the Geni-Act toolbox. a71 Genetic variation and population dynamics of members of the Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex (FIESC) are known to be trichothecene producers. members of the Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex (FIESC) are known to be trichothecene producers. EF-1a gene were more informative than ITS sequences based on DNA polymorphism indicators. role of mainland-island vampire bat movement and population dynamics in RABV activity in Trinidad. previous phylogenetic studies implicate the vampire bat species Desmodus rotundus as the source of RABV. genome will be extracted from tissue samples and comparative bat population genetic analysis will be performed using mitochondrial cytochromeb gene and selected microsatellite markers. RABV seroprevalence will also be determined. relationship between bat population dynamics in Trinidad and movements estimated from the bat population genetic analyses. there is no data on the prevalence of the N348I mutation in patients failing different antiretroviral therapy regimens in botswana. the mutation emerged in 10% of patients failing AZT containing cART and 33.3% of participants failing regimens containing NVP or EFV.
