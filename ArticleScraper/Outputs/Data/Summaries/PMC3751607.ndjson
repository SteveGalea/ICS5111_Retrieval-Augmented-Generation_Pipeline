{"summary": "the whole genome of the PEDV strain CH/GDGZ/2012 was amplified by 21 sets of primers (3) and cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa Bio, Inc., Japan), followed by sequencing twice by Beijing AuGCT DNA-SYN Biotechnology Co., China. GDGZ/2012 encodes the only accessory protein related to virulence (7). 96.1% to 97% nucleotide sequence identity with the corresponding ORFs of the reported strains."}
