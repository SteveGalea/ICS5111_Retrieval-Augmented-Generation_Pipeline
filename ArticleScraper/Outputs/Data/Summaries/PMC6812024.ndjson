{"summary": "large carnivores are important to the stability of most ecosystems. environmental and intrinsic correlates of stress, impact of infectious diseases, anthropogenic mortality, habitat loss and fragmentation are all factors influencing the conservation of these carnivores. familiaris are at a higher risk of infection (Murray et al., 1999; Randall et al., 2004; Cleaveland et al., 2007; Lesniak et al., 2017b). close physical contact between group members is characteristic of social canids such as wolves and greatly enhances within-pack transmission of pathogens. a recent comparative survey of the presence of viruses in wolves indicated that density and spatial distribution of susceptible hosts can be important factors influencing infections in wolves. however, the assessment of such drivers through comparison of different geographical regions is complicated by lack of data or by the adoption of different approaches. study areas Eleven wolf packs from three different geographical regions were studied (Table 1): Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise National Park (PNALM) in central Italy, Mercantour National Park (PNM) in south-eastern France and the northern range of Yellowstone National Park (YNP) in north-western United-States.

Capillaria spp. and Toxocara canis were only found in PNALM. all parasites found in PNM were also detected in PNALM. P and CI are expressed as percentages (%). the number of parasite taxa detected in wolf faeces was cumulatively affected. wolves consuming a more diversified array of prey species hosted a lower number of parasite taxa. wolves consuming a more diversified array of prey species hosted a lower number of parasite taxa compared to wolf populations predating on one or two ungulate species. parameters R2 K log-likelihood AICc w Wolf Density 0.233 2 404.050 816.100 \u2013 0.598 Free-ranging dogs + Diet 0.230 3 403.447 816.894 0.794 0.401 Fixed-effect parameters SE 95% confidence interval lower upper (intercept) 0.950 0.969 2.85 0.949 Wolf density 0.040 0.007 0.026 0.054 Free-ranging dog a 1.628 0.275 1.090 2.167 Die t b 1.326 0.161 1.642 1.010 PNM c 0.202 0.305 0.799 0.396 YNP c 1.249 0.195 0.866 1.631 a Reference: Specific diet. the number of directly transmitted parasite taxa per faecal sample was again cumulatively affected by the occurrence of free-ranging dogs. faecal samples In 342 analysed wolf scats, we identified 11 different parasite taxa from four in PNM to ten in PNALM. the proportion of positive samples did not differ between the PNALM and YNP, that shared the highest values. canid endoparasites detected in faecal samples of three different wolf populations from PNALM (2006\u20132007), PNM (2006\u20132007), and YNP (2007\u20132009) total number of analysed samples (N), proportion (P) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) are specified. trematode Dicrocoelium dendriticum was the most commonly detected pseudoparasite in the european national parks. 1 1.5 0.1\u20139.0 3 1.6 0.4\u20135.0 5 1.5 0.5\u20133.6 Metastrongylus spp. 4 4.5 1.5\u201311.9 0 0 \u2013 1 1.5 0.1\u20139.0 0 \u2013 1 0.3 0.0\u20131.9 Toxocara cati 1 1.1 0.1\u20137.1 0 0 \u2013 0 \u2013 1 0.3 0.0\u20131.9 Trichuris suis 3 3.4 0.9\u201310.3 0 0 \u2013 0 \u2013 only candidate models with AICc 10 are shown. fixed-effects parameters R2 K log-likelihood AICc w Wolf Density 0.233 2 404.050 816.100 \u2013 0.598 Free-ranging dogs + Diet 0.230 3 403.447 816.894 0.794 0.401 Fixed-effect parameters SE 95% confidence interval lower upper (intercept) 0.950 0.969 2.85 0.949 Wolf density 0.040 0.007 0.026 0.054 Free effects on parasite taxa for indirectly transmitted parasites Fixed-effects parameters R2 K log-likelihood AICc w Diet 0.274 2 341.839 691.678 0 0.685 Park 0.275 3 341.615 693.230 1.552 0.315 Fixed-effect parameters SE 95% confidence interval lower upper (intercept) a study area effect revealed that in the PNALM, independently of the occurrence of free-ranging dogs, other factors contributed as well to the highest number of directly transmitted parasite taxa we revealed. wolves in YNP hosted a higher number of indirectly transmitted parasite taxa compared to wolves living on one or a few prey species. the presence of sympatric free-ranging dogs positively correlated with both infection status and the number of parasite taxa we detected in faecal samples. only recently, al-Sabi et al. reported a high proportion of 60% of C. boehmi in wolves of Sweden. the constant population of free-ranging dogs in Italy served probably as a reservoir for C. boehmi. in 2013 the death of several wolves in PNALM was attributed to a CDV outbreak. the knowledge of the range of hosts and the geographic distribution of C. aerophila is still incomplete. echinococcus granulosus is widespread in Italy and in particular in the Abruzzo region. it is closely linked to the selection of elk as a primary prey by wolves on the northern range of YNP. it also suggests a high level of infection of the YNP elk population. infection of wolves by Sarcocystis spp. has been reported in different geographical regions. wolves with a more diversified diet hosted a lower number of parasite taxa. wolves with a more diversified diet hosted a lower number of parasite taxa. the proportion of positive samples and the number of pseudoparasite taxa were highest in PNALM, followed by PNM and lower in YNP. the detection of more generalist parasites such as D. dendriticum, Nematodirus spp. or Capillariidae is an indicator of their presence in potential wolf prey species. the presence of free-ranging dogs was a relevant driver of both infection status and the number of parasite taxa detected in wolf faeces. the presence of free-ranging dogs was enhanced by sympatric populations of canids and thus facilitates infection of wolves by shared parasites. et al. (1993) suggested long-established wolf populations might harbour helminths different from newly settled populations. the high number of parasite taxa we reported in PNALM may reflect a long-term co-evolution between the wolf and its parasite community. the total proportion of infected samples in YNP (81.7%) was coherent with previous findings in wolves from north America (91.0% by necropsy, Rausch and Williamson, 1959; 95.0%, Custer and Pence, 1981b) the lowest number of parasite taxa (only four) and the lowest proportion of infected samples were found in PNM. the absence of Capillaria spp. in PNM may be due to lack of infection in dispersing wolves during the re-colonisation period. the overall lower wolf density and lack of free-ranging dogs in PNM prevent the contamination of the environment by these parasites. physaloptera spp. and alaria spp. found in wolf samples from PNALM and YNP were not reported for Italy before. the absence of T. canis in PNM and YNP suggests a low prevalence of this parasite. different parasites of the dog are present as larvae in faeces. most of these parasites have been reported in wolves. helminth proportion would double in PNM, but remain about same in YNP. in italy, M. lineatus, D. caninum, and Ancylostoma caninum were detected in less than 16% of analysed guts of wolves. the low sensitivity of coprology probably explains their absence in our data. the high percentage of C. aerophila was always present, at a lower proportion, as a coinfection in samples with C. boehmi. Capillaria species were not common parasites of foxes in central and Northern Italy. the genera Taenia and Echinococcus are widespread intestinal parasites of canids and have frequently been reported in wolves. both genera include different species described in wolves in Europe and North America. the presence of Sarcocystis spp. in all three study areas was not surprising. wolves are well-known parasites of dogs, foxes and coyotes. 95% of necropsied wolves found dead in Germany being positive for Sarcocystis spp. wolves with a more diversified diet hosted a lower number of parasite taxa. wolves in YNP showed a higher probability of being infected by more than one parasite taxon with an indirect life cycle. the presence of free-ranging dogs was a relevant driver of both infection status and the number of parasite taxa detected in wolf faeces. in central Italy, free-ranging dogs most likely use similar prey species as wolves. wolves scavenge on abandoned livestock carcasses. differences in parasite numbers between the three investigated areas indicated that additional different geographical and biological factors structure the parasite community of wolves. ancestry of the studied populations, other ecological correlates, presence and diversity of sympatric susceptible canids are factors that may explain these differences. the number of parasite taxa we detected in YNP was lower compared to long-established, untreated populations in Canada. all parasites detected in the YNP packs are known coyote parasites (Erickson, 1944; Thornton et al., 1974; Arther and Post, 1977; Hudkins and Kistner, 1977; Conder and Loveless, 1978; Dubey, 1980; Custer and Pence, 1981a; Radomski and Pence small populations of hosts that recolonise new areas usually harbour a subset of the total variety of parasites present in the source population. the absence of Capillaria spp. in PNM might be due to lack of infection in dispersing wolves during the re-colonisation period. only recently, al-Sabi et al. (2018) reported a high proportion of 60% of C. boehmi in wolves of Sweden. the high percentage of this mainly directly transmitted parasite suggests a very efficient transmission and an important contamination of the environment. the dominant proportion of the Taeniidae and Sarcocystis spp. detected in all three investigated areas. these two taxa are known to infect a broad array of ungulate and carnivore species worldwide. the presence of Sarcocystis spp. in all three study areas was not surprising. wolves are well-known parasites of dogs, foxes and coyotes. 95% of necropsied wolves found dead in Germany being positive for Sarcocystis spp., where red deer and fallow deer are the main prey. the more diversified diet of wolves in PNALM and PNM, relative to YNP, could have contributed to the lower proportion of Sarcocystis spp. wolf density An elevated host density usually facilitates the spread of parasites in a population and the transmission of new parasite species. a higher number of members within a pack corresponds to higher chances of infection by one or more parasites taxa. the differences in parasite numbers between the three investigated areas indicated that additional different geographical and biological factors structure the parasite community of wolves. the differences in parasite numbers between the three investigated areas indicated that additional different geographical and biological factors structure the parasite community of wolves. the number of parasite taxa we detected in YNP was lower compared to long-established, untreated populations in canada. all parasites detected in the YNP packs are known coyote parasites (Erickson, 1944; Thornton et al., 1974; Arther and Post, 1977; Hudkins and Kistner, 1977; Conder and Loveless, 1978; Dubey, 1980; Custer and Pence, 1981a; Radomski and Pence the lowest number of parasite taxa (only four) and the lowest proportion of infected samples were found in the elk population of YNP. the presence of capillaria spp. in foxes has not been reported. individual parasites Cystoisospora spp. was, beside Sarcocystis spp., the only other protozoan parasite detected in one sample each in PNALM and YNP. this protozoan was identified in Canada and in the united states, likely causing the death of wolf pups. physaloptera spp. and alaria spp. found in wolf samples from YNP. no wolf pup died in the studied packs from yNP. coprological surveys provide an acceptable approximation to the real parasite fauna. in wild canids coprological prevalences were significantly lower than those found by necropsy. but in wild canids coprological surveys provide an acceptable approximation to the real parasite fauna. the term prevalence is sometimes erroneously used in the literature to describe the proportion of faecal samples containing parasites. however, we believe they provide a practical yet useful assessment of the extent of infection within a host population. findings indicate high levels of infection by a high number of parasite taxa in PNALM and YNP."}
