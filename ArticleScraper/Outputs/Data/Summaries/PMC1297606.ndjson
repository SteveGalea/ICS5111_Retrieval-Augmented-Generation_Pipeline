{"summary": "mechanical ventilation is indispensable for the survival of patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) tidal volumes greater than 10 ml/kg have been shown to increase mortality by causing ventilator-induced lung injury. high static intrathoracic pressures may overinflate parts of the lung that remain well aerated at zero end-inspiratory pressure [6-8] in a given patient, it is impossible to predict intrinsic PEEP induced by a high respiratory rate and no'magic number can be recommended. the clinician should increase the ventilator respiratory rate while looking at the expiratory flow displayed on the screen of the ventilator. the physiological dead space consists of three parts: first, the instrumental dead space, defined as the volume of the ventilator tubing between the Y piece and the distal tip of the endotracheal tube. second, the anatomical dead space, defined as the volume of ventilated and nonperfused lung units. only the former can be substantially reduced by medical intervention. conMV, conventional mechanical ventilation (low respiratory rate with HME); OptiMV, optimized mechanical ventilation (optimized respiratory rate with HH) the basic principle of expiratory washout is to replace, with afresh gas, the CO2-laden gas present at end expiration in theinstrumental dead space [28] expiratory washout is used to protect pH, whereas in the latter it is used to minimize stretch forces acting on the lung parenchyma, to minimize ventilator-associated lung injury. intrainsic PEEP is generated if the expiratory washout flow is not interrupted a few milliseconds before the beginning of the inspiratory phase. the clinician should increase the ventilator respiratory rate while looking at the expiratory flow displayed on the ventilator screen. the highest'safe respiratory rate' is the rate at which the end of the expiratory flow coincides with the beginning of the inspiratory phase. the anatomical dead space, defined as the volume of ventilated and nonperfused lung units, is defined as the volume of ventilated and nonperfused lung units. only the former can be substantially reduced by medical intervention. if a capnograph is used, it should be positioned on the expiratory limb, before the Y piece. expiratory washout is aimed at reducing CO2 rebreathing and PaCO2 without increasing tidal volume. expiratory washout can be applied either to decrease PaCO2 while maintaining tidal volume constant or to decrease tidal volume while keeping PaCO2 constant. expiratory washout is currently limited to experimental use. sighs and recruitment manoeuvres are characterized by intermittent increases in peak airway pressure. sighs and recruitment manoeuvres are characterized by sustained increases in plateau airway pressures. the different pressure thresholds for lung aeration depend on the complex mechanisms regulating the removal of oedema fluid from alveoli and alveolar ducts. the increase in airway pressure displaces the gas \u2013 liquid interface from alveolar ducts to alveolar spaces and increases the hydrostatic pressure gradient between the alveolar space and the pulmonary interstitium. recruitment manoeuvres and sighs are effective in improving arterial oxygenation only at low PEEP and small tidal volumes. recruitment manoeuvres are either poorly effective or deleterious, inducing overinflation of the most compliant lung regions. recruitment manoeuvres are less effective when ALI/ARDS is due to pneumonia or haemorrhagic oedema [43] recruitment manoeuvres are quite efficient for rapidly reversing aeration loss. in patients with severe head injury, recruitment manoeuvres may cause cerebral haemodynamics to deteriorate [53] recruitment manoeuvres may cause cerebral haemodynamics to deteriorate. clinical trials have failed to show an increase in survival rate by prone positioning in patients with acute respiratory failure [59,60] clinical trials have failed to show an increase in survival rate by prone positioning in patients with acute respiratory failure [59,60] a recruitment manoeuvre performed immediately after the reconnection of the patient to the ventilator allows a rapid recovery of end-expiratory lung volume and arterial oxygenation. however, in most severely hypoxaemic patients the open suctioning procedure itself may be associated with dangerous hypoxaemia [62] there is as yet no guideline for endotracheal suctioning in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. an algorithm is proposed in Fig. 3 aimed at preventing lung derecruitment and deterioration of gas exchange during endotracheal suctioning. the increase in airway pressure displaces the gas \u2013 liquid interface from alveolar ducts to alveolar spaces and increases the hydrostatic pressure gradient between the alveolar space and the pulmonary interstitium. recruitment manoeuvres increase arterial oxygenation by boosting the ventilatory cycle onto the deflation limb of the pressure \u2013 volume curve. recruitment manoeuvres and sighs are effective in improving arterial oxygenation only at low PEEP and small ti. recruitment manoeuvres are either poorly effective [46] or deleterious, inducing overinflation of the most compliant lung regions. recruitment manoeuvres are less effective when ALI/ARDS is due to pneumonia or haemorrhagic oedema. recruitment manoeuvres may cause cerebral haemodynamics to deteriorate. prone position restricts expansion of the cephalic and parasternal lung regions. it reduces regional ventilation-to-perfusion mismatch, prevents free expansion of anterior parts of the chest wall. close-circuit endotracheal suctioning is routinely performed in patients with ALI/ARDS. a negative pressure is generated into the tracheobronchial tree for removal of bronchial secretions from the distal airways. a rapid and long-lasting decrease in arterial oxygenation invariably results from open endotracheal suctioning. closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning is generally advocated for preventing arterial oxygenation impairment caused by ventilator disconnection. however, a loss of lung volume may still be observed, resulting from the suctioning procedure itself and appearing dependent on the applied negative pressure [15,63]. mechanical ventilation in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requires specific adjustments of tidal volume and PEEP. ion of gas exchange during endotracheal suctioning in hypox-aemic patients."}
