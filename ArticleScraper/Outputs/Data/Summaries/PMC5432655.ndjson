{"summary": "Objective Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. the association between MBL polymorphisms and TB has been studied in various populations. the results are controversial. HH genotype and H allele may increase the susceptibility to pulmonary TB in the Lur population of Iran, although L allele may decrease the susceptibility to pulmonary TB in this population. we suggest that it is necessary to further studies with larger sample size and other ethnic population. mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an acute-phase serum protein. it is synthesized in the liver and circulates as oligomers complexed with MBL-associated serine proteases. MBL2 gene (10q11.2-q21) encodes for the mannose binding lectin and presents several polymorphisms. many studies showed these genetic variations are associated with a wide variety of diseases. so, MBL polymorphisms may contribute to pulmonary tuberculosis susceptibility. previous studies have not reached a consensus regarding the association between the MBL gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to PTB. the study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Lorestan University of Medical Sciences. all subjects agreed to take part in the study. case-control study was conducted in 100 pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 100 healthy controls. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism technique were used to study frequencies of MBL gene polymorphisms. PCR amplifications were performed using purified DNA Mastercycler (BioRad, USA) in 25 l reaction volumes. primer sequences were previously reported and listed in Table 1. genotypic and allelic frequencies of AB, HL, PQ and XY polymorphisms were ascertained by direct counting in the PTB patients and control group. data were managed and analyzed using SPSS 21 program. controls were 100 unrelated Iranian individuals of the same race and geographic region. none of the controls showed any clinical manifestations of PTB at the time of blood sample collection. PCR amplification products were analyzed on a polyacrylamide gel to detect alterations in PCR-amplified products. primer sequences were previously reported [27], [39], [42] and listed in Table 1. To ensure the validity of result, we also did the DNA sequencing on the 5% representative isolates. isms frequency was assessed by an exact test in both patient and control groups. we calculated differences in the genotypic and allelic frequencies of AB, HL, PQ and XY polymorphisms between the cases group and control group. BL-HL HH 35 22 1.909 0.0417 HL 43 48 0.817 0.4777 LL 22 30 0.658 0.1972 MBL-PQ PP 76 69 1.423 0.2676 PQ 21 26 0.757 0.4044 QQ 3 5 0.588 0.4705 MBL-XY XX 5 7 0.699 0.5515 XY 36 29 1.377 0.2906 YY 59 64 0.809 0.4675 Significant difference ( H allele showed a significant association with increased risk of TB (56.5% in patients vs. 46% in controls, P = 0.0357, OR = 1.525, %95 CI = 1.028\u20132.262). also, the distribution of L allele in patients was significantly lower frequency in TB patients compared to controls. Discussion Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. however, a relatively small proportion of people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. the host immune response against MTB is mediated by cellular immunity. the results were inconsistent and inconclusive MBL gene may be involved in genetic susceptibility to TB. they are rapidly degraded and exist as lower order oligomers. the effect of low MBL levels on TB has been controversial. some studies reported low MBL levels as associated with protection against the disease. others estimated a relation with increased susceptibility to TB. studies showed no association between alleles at the codons 54 and TB. a large study in india showed a significantly increased genotype frequency of MBL mutant homozygotes was seen in pulmonary TB patients compared with that in control subjects. TB is a multifactorial disease and its susceptibility depends on host genetic aspects, but also on interactions with environmental factors.
