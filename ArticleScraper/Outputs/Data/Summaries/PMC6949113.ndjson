{"summary": "71 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) significant number of those with chronic infection will develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or liver failure, resulting in approximately 400,000 deaths each year. recently approved combination regimens of sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ledipasvir and glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir have drastically improved efficacy outcomes. guanosine analogs have proven to be potent, pan-genotypic inhibitors. previously identified guanosine analogs such as PSI-938 and BMS-986094 had excellent activity against HCV replication. however, their development was halted due to observed hepatic and cardiac toxicity. catalyzed by human cathepsin A (CatA) and/or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) producing the L-alanyl intermediate (M1) followed by removal of the amino acid moiety by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) resulting in the MP metabolite, M2. as with PSI-938, M2 is likely converted to M3 by adenosine deaminase like ing protein 1 results in metabolite M2 which can then be converted to M3 by adenosine deaminase like protein 1 (ADALP1) both M2 and M3 can be dephosphorylated by 5\u2019-nucleotidase (5\u2019-NTase) to their respective nucleosides M4 and AT-273. neither AT-511 nor SOF showed toxicity to the replicon cells up to the highest concentrations tested (100 M for AT-511; 1 M for SOF). nM (range 3 to 50 nM), demonstrating that AT-511 is roughly 10-fold more potent than SOF. 287 nM was 5.6-fold across the genotypes tested, compared with a tighter 3.1-fold range (9\u201329 nM) for AT-511. cell viability was measured using the alamarBlue\u00ae assay as described in the Methods. the range in SOF EC50 values (23\u2013126 nM) was 5.5-fold, whereas that for AT-511 covered only a 2.3-fold range (6\u201314 nM) the EC95 potency ratios (4 to 14) and variabilities (195\u20131020 nM and 5.2-fold for SOF; 33\u201380 nM and 2.5-fold for AT-511) were similar across the patient-derived genotypes as well. several HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates were tested using the PhenoSense assay. the EC50 and EC95 values were, respectively, 8- and 10-fold higher for SOF compared to AT-511. for those with this S282T polymorphism, SOF was significantly less effective in inhibiting viral replication compared to its response using the reference strain lacking the S282T variant. cell viability was measured using the alamarBlue\u00ae assay as described in the Methods. neither test article affected viability up to the highest concentration tested. EC50, effective concentration required to inhibit virus replication by 50% EC95, effective concentration required to inhibit virus replication by 95%. antiviral activity and cell viability measured as described in the Methods. EC50, effective concentration required to inhibit virus replication by 50% TC50, threshold concentration required to decrease cell viability by 50% HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1. the potential for AT-9010 to inhibit POLRMT was assessed in parallel with the active TP of SOF (2\u2019-fluoro-2\u2019-C-methyl UTP) and the active TP of BMS-986094 (2\u2019-C-methyl GTP), a drug known to cause toxicity via its inhibition of POLRMT. the incorporation efficiencies of AT-9010 and SOF TP were within two-fold, whereas the TP of BMS-986094 was incorporated aKinetic parameters for the nucleotide controls were taken from [11] to determine if the minimal interaction of AT-9010 with POLRMT could result in deleterious effects on mitochondrial function. AT-511 was incubated with K562 cells in cell culture medium with galactose substituted for glucose. aCell membrane integrity in glucose-free galactose containing medium after 2 h incubation measured by inhibition of cellular ATP levels. AT-511 showed no toxicity at the highest concentrations tested (up to 100 M) in any of the antiviral replicon assays. azosin with cardiomyocytes and 1 and 2 M for AZT in GM and E cell assays. other prodrugs of M3, such as PSI-661 and PSI-938, have been discontinued or have failed due to toxicity in the clinic likely due to the formation of mutagenic O6-alkylated nucleobase metabolites. AT-511 had IC50 values >30 M (the highest concentration tested) for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, compared to the inhibitors used as positive controls for the enzymes. however, AT-511 has low potential for drug-drug interactions mediated by CYP enzymes. hepatocytes incubated for 24 h with 10 M AT-511 in triplicate, collected, lysed and the lysates measured for concentrations of AT-511, AT-9010, M2 and M3 by LC-MS/MS. data are expressed as mean SD. no other quantifiable TP found in any of the hepatocytes at any time point. no other quantifiable TP found in any of the hepatocytes at any time point. charges, including the MPs (M2 and M3), the active TP (AT-9010), and the intermediate diphosphate (DP) were not measured in plasma samples. levels of these phosphorylated metabolites were quantitated in samples of liver and heart tissue obtained 4 h after each AT-527 dose in rats and monkeys. data are expressed as mean SD of 3 male and 3 female rats (combined) and of 3 male monkeys. data are expressed as mean SD of 3 male and 3 female rats (combined) mean profiles of AT-511 and its metabolites in rat plasma over 24 h. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a 300 mg/kg single oral dose of AT-527. plasma concentrations of AT-511, AT-273, M1 and M4 were measured. the mean concentration of the active TP, AT-9010 (6974 2844 pmol/g) was 87-fold higher than that in heart (80 41 pmol/g) in male monkeys 4 hr after an oral dose of AT-527 at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg (n = 2 per dose) concentrations of AT-9010 were 11\u201331. the similarly high ratios for its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 (11\u201372), are further evidence that these compounds are preferentially delivered to the liver, the target organ for HCV infection. the 5\u2019-TP of M2 was either not detected in monkey liver and heart tissue or possibly present but only at trace levels. bIndividual heart concentrations of AT-9010 were estimated by extrapolation of the calibration curve below the LLOQ of 110 pmol/g. the dose proportionality of AT-9010 was reflected in plasma levels of AT-273, with fold increases in respective Cmax and AUC0-last values of 3.1 and 1.9. this is consistent with AT-273 only being formed via dephosphorylation of its phosphorylated forms. neither AT-511 nor SOF showed toxicity to the replicon cells up to the highest concentrations tested (100 M for AT-511; 1 M for SOF). replicons treated with AT-511 or SOF were incubated with serial dilutions of AT-511 or sofosbuvir (SOF) in parallel. the range in EC50 values for SOF (51\u2013287 nM) was 5.6-fold across the genotypes tested, compared with a tighter 3.1-fold range (9\u201329 nM) for AT-511. cell viability was measured using the alamarBlue\u00ae assay. the range in SOF EC50 values (23\u2013126 nM) was 5.5-fold, whereas that for AT-511 covered only a 2.3-fold range (6\u201314 nM) the EC95 potency ratios (4 to 14) and variabilities (195\u20131020 nM and 5.2-fold for SOF; 33\u201380 nM and 2.5-fold for AT-511) were similar across the patient-derived genotypes as well. EC50, effective concentration required to inhibit virus replication by 50% EC95, effective concentration required to inhibit virus replication by 95%. EC95 and EC95 values were 8- and 10-fold higher for SOF compared to AT-511, except for the three strains containing the S282T genetic variation. cell viability was measured using the alamarBlue\u00ae assay as described in the Methods. neither test article affected viability up to the highest concentration tested (10,000 nM for AT-511 and 100,000 nM for SOF). avirin 5.65 38.8 8.07 >100 HRV H1-HeLa Ribavirin 17.1 40.6 18.6 >100 AdV HeLa Ribavirin 0.76 11.7 >100 >100 CoV MRC-5 Ribavirin 3.85 >100 >100 >100 >100 RSV HEp2 TMC-353121 0.003 >0.10 >100 >100 >100 antiviral activity and cell viability were measured as described in the Methods. toxicity of several nucleoside triphosphate analogs is thought to be the result of their ability to inhibit human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) the potential for AT-9010 to inhibit POLRMT was assessed in parallel with the active TP of SOF (2\u2019-fluoro-2\u2019-C-methyl UTP) and the active TP of BMS-986094 (2\u2019-C-methyl GTP) aKinetic parameters for the nucleotide controls were taken from [11] to determine whether the minimal interaction of AT-9010 with POLRMT could result in deleterious effects on mitochondrial function. AT-511 was incubated with K562 cells in cell culture medium with galactose substituted for glucose. AT-511 showed no cytotoxicity at the highest concentrations tested (up to 100 M) in any of the antiviral replicon assays or when incubated with mouse, rat, dog, monkey or human hepatocytes. the cytotoxicity of AT-511 was further evaluated in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) cardiomyocytes. the positive control compounds had the expected cytotoxic effects. other prodrugs of M3, such as PSI-661 and PSI-938, have been discontinued or have failed due to toxicity in the clinic. AT-511 had IC50 values >30 M (the highest concentration tested) for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, and only weakly inhibited CYP3A4 (25 M IC50) compared to inhibitors used as positive controls for the enzymes. s, far exceeded intracellular AT-511 concentrations in hepatic cells. the relative levels of AT-9010 formed, and its accumulation over 24 h. hepatocytes were incubated for 24 h with 10 M AT-511 in triplicate. aCmax = Maximum concentration across time points measured bAUC0-24 = Area under the curve for 0\u201324 h. no other quantifiable TP found in any of the hepatocytes at any time point. a lower amount of the MP, M2, was detected. the phosphorylated metabolites formed and retained intracellularly due to their negative charges, including the MPs (M2 and M3), the active TP (AT-9010), and the intermediate diphosphate (DP; Fig 2). levels of these metabolites were quantitated in samples of liver and heart tissue obtained 4 h after each AT-527 dose in rats and monkeys. 4.7 8.1 18.2 1.7 22.4 2.4 Monkey 100 1.30 0.49 15.3 7.6 39.2 15.0 22.3 4.1 Monkey 300 1.66 0.49 17.3 11.5 53.9 31.7 26.6 9.6 AT-273 Rat 500 2.50 0.52 6.34 0.58 40.3 10.9 17.5 2.1 Monkey 30 0.14 0.01 16.0 6.9 5.42 1.03 26.9 1.9 Monkey 100 0.44 0.17 4.00 0.0 10.1 2.6 23.7 3.8 Monkey mean profiles of AT-511 and its metabolites in rat plasma over 24 h. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a 300 mg/kg single oral dose of AT-527. plasma concentrations of AT-511, AT-273, M1 and M4 were measured. plasma concentrations of AT-511, AT-273, M1 and M4 were measured by LC-MS/MS. the mean concentration of the active TP, AT-9010 (6974 2844 pmol/g) was 87-fold higher than that in heart (80 41 pmol/g) at this high dose, AT-9010 concentrations were 18 times higher in liver compared to corresponding heart tissues. the similarly high ratios for its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 (11\u201372), are further evidence that these compounds are preferentially delivered to the liver, the target organ for HCV infection. heart concentrations contain values estimated by extrapolation of the calibration curve below the LLOQ (10\u201320 pmol/g) for all analytes except AT-9010 bIndividual heart concentrations of AT-9010 were estimated by extrapolation of the calibration curve below the LLOQ of 110 pmol/g. the dose proportionality of AT-9010 in monkey livers between the 30 and 100 mg/kg doses was reflected in plasma levels of AT-273. despite the relatively low concentrations of AT-511 in rat plasma, this species produces one of the highest amounts of the active TP in hepatocyte incubations in vitro as well as liver concentrations in vivo. rat and monkey studies showed that oral administration of a single dose of AT-527 resulted in preferential delivery of AT-9010 and its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 to the liver. AT-273 is the most abundant metabolite formed in hepatocytes in vitro and in liver tissue in vivo. plasma levels of AT-273 can be regarded as a surrogate of the intracellular levels of the active TP. the 10 h half-life of AT-9010 observed in human hepatocytes in vitro and in liver tissue in vivo. galactose cytotoxicity assay in K562 cells did not detect any changes in mitochondrial function. some known mitochondrial toxins such as ddC did not generate cytotoxicity in galactose-adapted cells. lack of toxicity observed with AT-511 in mitobiogenesis assay conducted in PC3 cells is reassuring as these cells are sensitive to mitochondrial toxicity. AT-527 has no inhibitory effect on a panel of cytochrome P450 enzymes. no mutagenic O6-alkylguanine bases were formed from AT-511. compared to other highly inhibitory protides of GTP analogs, it appears to have low potential for metabolic drug-drug interactions.
