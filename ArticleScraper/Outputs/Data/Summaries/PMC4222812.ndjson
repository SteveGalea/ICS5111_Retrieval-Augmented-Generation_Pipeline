{"summary": "breastfeeding and serum IgG have been shown to protect against RSV infection. but many infants depend on bovine milk-based nutrition. bIgG purified from bovine milk (bIgG) can modulate immune responses against human RSV. syncytial virus infection is a major cause of death in the first year of life. upper respiratory tract infections can progress into lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and cause severe disease, especially in pre-mature infants. cow\u2019s milk contains bovine IgG (bIgG) that binds to gastrointestinal pathogens that also infect humans, such as Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus mutants, Cryptosporidium parvum, Helicobacter pylori, and rotavirus. most infant nutrition is bovine milk-based, but lacks intact bIgG. ELISAs purified IgG from human plasma (Intravenous Immunoglobulin, pooled from >1000 donors, or IVIg) or bIgG equivalent to 167 g/ml was pre-incubated at room temperature with twice the amount used for coating of hRSV or vaccine. ice cold 50% PEG6000 in 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 6.1 g/L Tris was added to RSV-infected Hep2 cells while stirring. the mixture was stirred at 4\u00b0C for three hours. supernatant was removed and the pellet taken up in 10% sucrose. monocyte-derived DCs were cultured overnight in the presence of 10 ng/ml IFN- (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) monocyte-derived DCs were differentiated for five days under the influence of 50 ng/ml GM-CSF (Peprotech) Binding of bIgG to cells expressing FcR 96 wells maxisorb plates (Nunc) were coated with Ig in 0.1 M NaHPO4, pH 9 Bovine or human IgG (or buffer) was allowed to bind to RSV for 3 hours. plates were washed 3 times followed by washing once with RPMI containing 0.2% gelatine. assay continued as described under \u2018Binding of IgG to human FcyR\u2019. cells were incubated twice (30 sec) with acid medium (RPMI pH 2.5, 0.1% FCS) to remove extracellular RSV-Ig. cells were washed and fixed with 1% PFA in PBS and GFP expression was analysed. Detection of pathogen-specific IgG Maxisorb ELISA-plates coated with 0.5\u20132 g/ml pathogen antigens derived from human vaccines. plates were blocked with 0.5% gelatine/PBS, washed (0.05% tween-20/PBS), and samples were added and titrated. ice cold 50% PEG6000 in 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 6.1 g/L Tris was added to RSV-infected Hep2 cells while stirring. the mixture was stirred at 4\u00b0C for three hours. the pellet was taken up in 10% sucrose and stored in N2. monocytes were cultured overnight in the presence of 10 ng/ml IFN- (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) for differentiation to macrophages, monocytes were cultured overnight in the presence of 10 ng/ml IFN- (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) 96 wells maxisorb plates were coated with PEG-precipitated RSV. plates were washed (PBS) and blocked with 1% gelatine/PBS (1 hour 37\u00b0C) and washing three times (PBS-tween) Bovine or human IgG (or buffer) was allowed to bind to RSV for 3 hours at room temperature. pre-cooled PMN (1.5*105 cells) and 40 l RSV-Ig mixture was added and allowed to bind for 15 min in 96-wells plates. plates were washed and incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C in pre-warmed RPMI. cells were treated with trypsin for 10 min on ice to remove extracellular RSV. bIgG was observed at concentrations starting at 1.8 g/ml (Figure 1A) bIgG binds to human airway pathogens. RSV, influenza or Haemophilus influenzae type b was coated in ELISA plates. bIg was added in different concentrations (x-axes in g/ml) monocytes were incubated overnight in the presence or absence of IFN-. bIgG binds to human FcRII, which was increased by pre-incubating cells. bIgG was dose-dependent and comparable or slightly lower than human IVIg. PMNs of 4/5 donors bound to IVIg as well as to bIgG were incubated with FcRII (Fab)- and FcRIII (F(ab)2)-specific blocking mAb. pre-incubation of PMN with FcRII-specific Fabs reduced binding of PMN to bIgG of all three donors tested. a representative example of four donors tested is shown. no binding of cells was observed when Ig was inactivated. PMNs were pre-incubated with medium, and/or anti FcRII Fabs. independent experiments were performed with three donors. FITC-labelled bacteria were opsonised or not with human (IVIg) or bovine (bIgG) IgG. extracellular bacteria can be observed at both 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C incubated cells. intracellular bacteria are only present in cells incubated at 37\u00b0C. bIgG incubated at 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C (indicated at x-axes) x-axes indicate medium (\u2013) or bacteria alone without Ig (0). Mean and S.E.M. of triplicate measurements are shown. bIgG enhanced internalisation of S. epidermidis by moDCs. GFP+ cells were tested in the absence of RSV (\u2013), in the presence of RSV. but absence of Ig (0) and in the presence of IVIg or bIgG (g/ml) palivizumab recognises the F protein of bovine RSV. bIgG may be able to prevent infection with hRSV. bIgG binds to human airway pathogens. bIgG binds to human airway pathogens. bIgG binds to human airway pathogens. pathogen-specific bIgG could be detected at levels up to 11 g/ml. compared to bIgG, less IVIg was required to detect the pathogens. hRSV, HIB and influvac-specific IgG could be detected in pooled milk samples. monocytes were incubated overnight in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml IFN- stimulated monocytes. PMNs were incubated for 10 minutes in the absence or presence of 3 g/ml Fabs recognizing FcRIII or FcRII. an experiment was performed requiring bIgG to simultaneously bind to RSV-specific IVIg or bIgG. no binding was observed when plates were coated with gelatin instead of RSV. no binding was observed when plates were coated with gelatin. pre-incubation of PMN with anti FcRII, but not anti FcRIII Fabs, reduced binding of PMN to RSV-specific IVIg and bIgG. bIgG induces FcR-mediated phagocytosis. internalisation is required for efficient clearance of pathogens and efficient induction of memory T cells. FITC-labelled bacteria were opsonised or not with human (IVIg) or bovine (bIgG) IgG. subsequent cells were allowed to bind to opsonised bacteria. extracellular bacteria were defined as FITC+APC+ and intracellular bacteria as FITC+APC. intracellular bacteria are only present in cells incubated at 37\u00b0C. hRSV internalisation by human PMNs was opsonised with bIgG. in the absence of antibodies little internalisation of hRSV by human PMN was observed. however, pre-incubation of hRSV with both IVIg and bIgG resulted in a dose-dependent increase. GFP-renilla-RSV was pre-incubated with bIgG, IVIg or palivizumab. cells were harvested and analysed for GFP expression by flow cytometry. both IVIg and bIgG dose-dependently neutralised RSV. bIgG recognises several pathogens known to cause infections in the respiratory tract of infants. bIgG bound to human FcRII, and enhance phagocytosis of pathogens by human myeloid immune cells. cows are susceptible to pathogens like bovine RSV, and transfer bovine RSV-specific antibodies into colostrum and mature milk after delivery. bIgG consumption may induce adaptive immunity against respiratory pathogens. bIgG encounters swallowed respiratory pathogens in the GI tract or in the tonsillar crypts in Waldeyer\u2019s ring, forming immune-complexes that efficiently bind to DCs in the tissue. cRII-mediated antigen uptake and presentation, as well as DC maturation is crucial for activation and differentiation of T cells. this can thus result in long-lasting protection against airway pathogens via the T-cell dependent induction of pathogen-specific antibodies in the upper airways."}
