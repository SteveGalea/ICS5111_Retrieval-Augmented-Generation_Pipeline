{"summary": "new devices for specific nucleic acid detection need to meet specific requirements in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and high-throughput. this is true when circulating cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood or mutated DNA in rare circulating tumor cells are going to be considered. amplification generates a large number of target copies, greatly enhancing the assay sensitivity. compared to PCR methods, isothermal amplification methods are easier to operate and require less energy than PCR methods that require rapid heating and cooling steps. the use of fully enclosed microstructured devices into which performing the isothermal amplification reduces the risk of sample contamination and implies low sample consumption. the review will first discuss the use of microfluidic-based systems for nucleic acid amplification. microfluidics has been able to exploit differences existing between fluids flowing at the macroscale or travelling through microchannels. fluid mixing occurs through the diffusion, thus resulting in prolonged mixing times. passive mixing principles are very attractive because they rely on diffusion or chaotic advection through specially designed microchannels. silicon/glass-based PCR microchips have shown partial or total inhibition of the PCR amplification caused by a non-specific sequestering of Taq polymerase. the inhibition effect is due to a non-specific sequestering of Taq polymerase which prevents the enzyme activity and thereby the DNA amplification. polydispersity, defined as the standard deviation of the size distribution divided by the mean droplet size, can be 1\u20133%. droplet volumes range from femtoliters to nanoliters. hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the microchannel surface determines which liquid phase is dispersed. the implementation of PCR amplification in droplet-based microfluidic systems benefits from the reduced reaction volumes that result in a decreased reagent and sample consumption. a number of different isothermal amplification procedures have been introduced over the last 10 years. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) uses two sets of specially designed primers, termed inner and outer primers, and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. the reaction is initiated by a forward inner primer (FIP), containing sequences of the sense strand of the target DNA, which hybridizes to F2c in the target and initiates complementary strand synthesis. the outer primer F3 hybridizes to F3c portion in the target sequence leading to the first use of four primers ensures high selectivity for target amplification. pyrophosphate byproducts are produced during the reaction. pyrophosphate byproducts form a white precipitate that increases turbidity of the solution. Fang et al. presented an on-chip LAMP carried out with a total reaction volume of 10 L for visual determination by naked eye with SYBR Green I. the detection of LAMP was performed in an eight-channel chip for readout either by the naked eye or via absorbance measured by an optic sensor. the detection of LAMP was performed in an eight-channel chip for readout either by the naked eye or via absorbance measured by an optic sensor. Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) exploits the activity of a DNA helicase to separate complementary strands of double strand (ds) DNAs. it mimics the denaturation mechanism in living organisms where DNA is replicated by DNA polymerases with the aid of DNA helicase to separate complementary DNA strands. dsDNA helicases can be classified according to directionality (e.g., 5'\u20133' or 3'\u20135'), their source (e.g., prokaryotic or eukaryotic helicases), their oligomeric or monomeric nature and their substrate specificity (e.g., RNA vs. DNA). conserved motifs can be envisioned as an engine that powers the unwinding of duplex nucleic acids. the limited capability of UvrD HDA system in amplifying long target sequences was improved by using a thermostable UvrD helicase (Tte-UvrD) purified from thermophilic bacteria and the Bacillus stearothermophilus polymerase I. multiple reports on the use of HDA for the detection of bacterial and viral target DNA and RNA in standard microtube protocols have been described. the speed and robustness of HDA are highly dependent on the synchronization of helicase, single-stranded DNA binding protein and large fragment of Bst DNA polymerase. by increasing the concentration of constituent enzymes, the overall reaction speed has been increased. padlock probes are oligonucleotides with the two lateral sequences complementary to two target sequences connected by a linker sequence. the padlock segments are sealed through the action of a DNA ligase alone or in combination with a DNA polymerase. RCA of padlock probes produces a large DNA product that collapses into a submicrometer-sized concatamer. RCA has been used to amplify circular genomes of DNA viruses. the method is called multiply primed RCA and uses 29 DNA polymerase and an exonuclease-resistant random primer. dic devices included separate devices for droplet generation, fusion and detection and allowed the amplified DNA in each of the 2 pL droplets to be analyzed by measuring the activity of the encoded enzyme (-galactosidase) the rolling-circle enhanced enzyme activity detection (REEAD) was combined with a droplet microfluidic lab-on-a-chip platform by Juul et al. [91] the high-fidelity amplification by MDA preserves DNA sequence information. the random priming on the double-stranded DNA target is efficient enough to obtain an initial priming step that is followed by the strand-displacement process that produces the amplification. amplification bias can be reduced and the specificity of the amplification process can be increased as the reaction volume shrinks from microliters to nanoliters. the amplification yield is independent of the input amount of DNA template and reaches a plateau at a 0.7\u20131.0 g/L concentration of the amplified DNA. the fluidic cartridge of the device was fabricated with a thermoforming process. liquid and dry reagents for the amplification were pre-stored on the chip. the DNA sample was directly added to each microchamber. NASBA is an isothermal, transcription-based amplification method. it was first introduced by Compton in 1991 and is performed at 41 \u00b0C. NASBA cannot amplify double-stranded DNAs not subjected to a denaturation step. a specific forward primer (P1) hybridizes to any target RNA present in the sample. a specific reverse primer (P2) hybridizes to any target RNA present in the sample. this leads to the formation of a dsDNA with the target sequence and a T7 promoter. real-time NASBA technology has been integrated in a microfluidic system. amplification of 1.0 and 0.1 M oligonucleotides (human papillomavirus) 16 and artificial 118-bp single-stranded DNA was performed. a surface treatment was required to prevent the adsorption of reaction mixture components on the surface of the microfluidic device. the microfluidic NASBA system was based on microchannels and microchambers. it included a silica bead-bed RNA purification chamber and a NASBA chamber. the amplified tmRNA target was detected in real-time via molecular beacons fluorescence detection. the integration of the sample preparation, amplification and detection compartments in a single microfluidic device reduces the risk of sample degradation. AMP recognizes the target sequence and generates a large amount of amplified product within 1 h. it has been widely applied for the detection of pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus [41], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [42], Staphylococcus aureus [43], Salmonella enterica [44]. primers are used for strand displacement DNA synthesis during cycling reactions. all four primers are used during initial steps of the LAMP reaction. the amplification is performed at a constant temperature between 60 \u00b0C and 65 \u00b0C. the detection of LAMP was performed in an eight-channel chip for readout either by the naked eye or via absorbance measured by an optic sensor. the electrochemical detection of microfluidic integrated LAMP amplicons has been applied for the detection and the quantification of Escherichia coli [55]. helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) exploits activity of a DNA helicase to separate complementary strands of double strand (ds) DNAs. it mimics the denaturation mechanism in living organisms where DNA is replicated by DNA polymerases with the aid of DNA helicase. helicases can be classified according to their directionality (e.g., 5'\u20133' or 3'\u20135'), their source (e.g., prokaryotic or eukaryotic helicases), their oligomeric or monomeric nature and their substrate specificity (e.g., RNA vs. DNA) a thermostable UvrD helicase (Tte-UvrD) purified from thermophilic bacteria and the Bacillus stearothermophilus polymerase I at 60\u201365 \u00b0C. multiple reports on the use of HDA for the detection of bacterial and viral target DNA and RNA in standard microtube protocols have been described. the speed and robustness of HDA are highly dependent on the synchronization of helicase, single-stranded DNA binding protein and large fragment of Bst DNA polymerase. the increasing of the primer concentration also improved the reaction speed but also produced a partial loss in amplification accuracy. linear and exponential RCAs have been developed. padlock probes are oligonucleotides with the two lateral sequences complementary to two target sequences connected by a linker sequence. when the padlock probe hybridizes the target sequences it circularizes. the padlock segments are sealed through the action of a DNA ligase alone or in combination with a DNA polymerase. the method is called multiply primed RCA and uses 29 DNA polymerase and an exonuclease-resistant random primer. RCA and circle-to-circle amplification (C2CA) of padlock probes were introduced on a poly(methyl methacrylate) microchip. in each droplet to be analyzed by measuring the activity of the encoded enzyme (-galactosidase) after the fusion of the 2 pL droplet with a 15 pL droplet containing an in vitro translation (IVT) system supplemented with fluorescein-di--D-galactopyranoside (FDG) that is transformed into fluorescein by -galactosidase. the rolling-circle enhanced enzyme the high-fidelity amplification by MDA preserves DNA sequence information. the random priming on the double-stranded DNA target is efficient enough to obtain an initial priming step that is followed by the strand-displacement process that produces the amplification. the possibility to directly apply MDA to genomic material obtained from single cells helps in eliminating the need to develop culture methods. amplification bias can be reduced and the specificity of the amplification process can be increased as the reaction volume shrinks from microliters to nanoliters. the amplification yield is independent of the input amount of DNA template and reaches a plateau at a 0.7\u20131.0 g/L concentration of the amplified DNA. the fluidic cartridge of the device was fabricated with a thermoforming process. liquid and dry reagents for the amplification were pre-stored on the chip. the DNA sample was directly added to each microchamber to minimize surface adsorption effects. amplification process was obtained by adding a chemical initiator to each reaction compartment with a simple slipping step after instrument-free pipet loading. the digital RPA did not require precise temperature control since it is tolerant to fluctuations of the incubation temperature ranging from 37 \u00b0C to 42 \u00b0C. in the initiation phase, a specific forward primer (P1) hybridizes to any target RNA present in the sample. a specific reverse primer (P2) hybridizes to any target RNA present in the sample and is extended by the reverse transcriptase. in the amplification phase, each newly synthesized RNA can be copied. real-time NASBA technology has been integrated in a microfluidic system by Gulliksen et al. in this case, the amplification of 1.0 and 0.1 M oligonucleotides (human papillomavirus) 16 and artificial 118-bp single-stranded DNA was performed in a silicon-glass microchip device. a surface treatment was required to prevent the adsorption of reaction mixture components on the surface of the microflu the microfluidic NASBA system was based on microchannels and microchambers. a silica bead-bed RNA purification chamber enabled the capture of tmRNA target in real-time via molecular beacons fluorescence detection. the integration of the sample preparation, amplification and detection compartments in a single microfluidic device reduces the risk of sample degradation, which can compromise assay accuracy, reliability and reproducibility. the use of fully enclosed microstructured devices into which performing the isothermal amplification reduces the risk of sample contamination. the implementation of isothermal DNA amplification in microfluidic systems has the added benefit of reduced reaction volumes that result in a decreased reagent and sample consumption. target Detection limit a Ref.

NASBA for example is especially suited for RNAs such as mRNA, rRNA, tmRNA or genomic RNA. it can amplify double-stranded DNA unless subjected to a denaturation step. a thermostable UvrD helicase is able to amplify only short sequences (from 70 to 120 bp) the target applications of the RCA method are wide, ranging from small and circular single-stranded DNAs to double stranded linear DNA molecules and even mRNA. ss the circularizing step of a padlock probe is strictly target-dependent. microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technology for amplification of nucleic acids offers great potential for lower cost, higher speed, smaller sample consumption and automation of all processes from sample preparation to signal detection. the use of microfluidic-based methods for isothermal nucleic acid amplification has been described. the use of isothermal amplification techniques coupled with miniaturized devices for analysis ensure a higher percentage of specific amplification product obtained from the targeted DNA template. also accurate and high fidelity single-cell genome amplification in nanoliter volumes."}
