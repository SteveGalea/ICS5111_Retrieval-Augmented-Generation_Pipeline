{"summary": "infections are generally localized to the respiratory, enteric or nervous systems, but systemic disease can also be caused by some coronaviruses. two HCoVs, strains 229E (HCoV-229E) and OC43, generally cause winter outbreaks of mild, self-limited upper respiratory tract infections. alveolar epithelial type II cells, type I-like cells and alveolar macrophages (AMs) were susceptible to HCoV-229E infection. previously, HCoV-229E was shown to infect bronchial epithelial cells and blood monocyte-derived macrophages. some of the infected type I-like cells formed syncytia that stained for viral antigens, which are indicative of CoV infection. in contrast, >50 % of the human AMs were susceptible to HCoV-229E. 16HBE cells were inoculated with HCoV-229E at an m.o.i. of 1, fixed at 24 h post-inoculation and immunostained for the epithelial cell marker cytokeratin (clone MNF116; red) and HCoV-229E proteins (green), and with DAPI (blue) the MRC-5 cell line used to propagate HCoV-229E is known to express CD13/APN. alveolar type I-like cells and Calu-3 cells expressed a low but detectable level of CD13/APN. the level of CD13/APN was below the level of detection for alveolar type II cells and H292 and H441 cells. inoculation and the samples were analysed using an antibody bead-based Luminex assay. 11 of the 25 cytokines were detectable by this assay. of the infected samples, tumour necrosis factor alpha showed the greatest increase. AMs were cultured and infected with HCoV-229E at an m.o.i. of 1 and the culture supernatants were collected 24 h later. levels of cytokines TNF- (a), RANTES (CCL5) (b) and MIP-1 (CCL4) (c) were measured by ELISA. oV-229E infection in all groups except the ex-smokers was only four. there was no increase in TNF- secretion when AMs were inoculated with HCoV-229E. one of the most important responses of many cell types to virus infection is secretion of type I IFNs, which induce an antiviral state in surrounding cells. surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D have the capacity to bind HCoV-229E. the surfactant proteins were bound to an ELISA plate, followed by binding of the HCoV-229E virus, goat anti-HCoV-229E antibody and an HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody. SP-A and SP-D inhibited virus infection in a concentration-dependent manner. but SP-D caused a greater reduction in HCoV-229E infection at both 3 and 10 g ml1 than the same concentrations of SP-A. type II cells were refractory to HCoV-229E infection in all experiments. some of the infected type I-like cells formed syncytia that stained for viral antigens. however, some of the infected type I-like cells formed syncytia that stained for viral antigens, which are indicative of CoV infection. alveolar epithelial type I-like cells were inoculated with HCoV-229E at an m.o.i. of 1, fixed at 24 h post-inoculation and immunostained for the epithelial cell marker cytokeratin (clone MNF116; red) and HCoV-229E proteins (green), and with DAPI to stain the nuclei. AMs, 16HBE cells, A549 cells and MRC-5 all expressed significant levels of CD13/APN. alveolar type I-like cells and Calu-3 cells expressed low but detectable level of CD13/APN. expression of CD13 was related directly to their susceptibility to infection by HCoV-229E. the supernatant was collected at 24 h post-inoculation and the samples were analysed using an antibody bead-based Luminex assay. 11 of the 25 cytokines were detected by this assay and increased in all three of the infected samples compared with the controls. cytokines TNF- (a), RANTES (CCL5) (b) and MIP-1 (CCL4) (c) were measured by ELISA. mRNA levels of IFN- and IL-29 in AMs from eight donors 24 h after inoculation with HCoV-229E or control medium. there was no increase in TNF- secretion when AMs were inoculated with UV-inactivated HCoV-229E. one of the most important responses of many cell types to virus infection is secretion of type I IFNs. a Luminex assay detected a small increase in IFN- from infected AMs. surfactant proteins bound similarly to HCoV-229E virions in a dose-dependent manner. the results showed that SP-A and SP-D have the capacity to bind HCoV-229E. the number of cells infected with virus alone was set at 100 %. SP-A and SP-D inhibited virus infection in a concentration-dependent manner. but SP-D caused a greater reduction in HCoV-229E infection at 3 and 10 g ml1 than the same concentrations of SP-A. AMs produced a variety of cytokines in response to HCoV-229E infection. cytokines are known to activate or be chemotactic for monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes. HCoV-229E produced a cytokine response in AMs. the cellular tropism of HCoV-NL-63 and HCoV-HKU-1 needs to be defined more precisely, but both are reported to infect bronchial epithelial cells. the ability of AMs to respond to virus infection is probably mediated in part by prior exposure to toxins and micro-organisms. the levels of cytokine expression by AMs isolated from smokers are reduced compared with those from non-smokers. in a mouse-model system, AMs from mice of a single genetic background were exposed to cigarette smoke and to poly(I : C) there was a significant reduction in the levels of TNF-, IL-6 and RANTES compared with AMs from control animals. SP-A and SP-D have been shown to be important components of innate immunity in the lung. SP-D binding to haemagglutinin inhibits both virus infection and haemagglutination activity. HCoV-229E is still able to initiate infections in the lower respiratory tract. the cellular environment of the alveolus is not conducive to HCoV-229E production. AMs secreted cytokines and chemokines that can attract other immune cells. the red blood cells were lysed with Pharm Lyse (BD Biosciences) and macrophages were either plated immediately or resuspended in freezing medium (10 % DMSO and 90 % FBS) and stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen for use at a later time. cells were cultured in DMEM with 10 % FBS, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics. most infections were carried out on AMs cultured for 2 days. cell line was grown on tissue-culture plates using DMEM with 10 % FBS. HCoV-229E was originally obtained from the ATCC. virions were purified by sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation. cells were inoculated with sucrose gradient-purified HCoV-229E. primary antibodies for cell markers were mAbs for cytokeratin for type I epithelial cells (clone MNF116; DakoCytomation) and CD68 for AMs (clone KP1; DakoCytomation) the secondary antibody was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) the effects of SP-A and SP-D on HCoV-229E infection were determined in a similar way. the inoculum was removed and the cells were overlaid with minimal essential medium containing 8 % FBS, antibiotics and 0.5 % SeaKem LE agarose (Cambrex) a Luminex antibody bead kit was used to measure human chemokines and cytokines produced by infected cells. antibody was added for 45 min, the wells were washed twice and the samples were analysed using a bio-Plex fluorescent reader (Bio-Rad) a hundred beads were counted for each analyte per well and values were calculated using the bio-Plex manager software (Bio-Rad) SP-A was isolated from alveolar proteinosis lavage fluid. non-specific binding was prevented by incubation with buffer A. a goat anti-HCoV-229E antibody was used for detection. hoc tests were selected for multiple comparisons. the effect of HCoV-229E on TNF- secretion was carried out by a Wilcoxon t-test. epithelial cells were either plated immediately or resuspended in freezing medium and stored in liquid nitrogen. cells were washed with DMEM to remove non-adherent cells. purity of isolated AMs was typically 90 % before plating. 16HBE cells were originally isolated from human bronchial epithelial cells and transformed with the origin-defective simian virus 40 genome. cell lines were grown on tissue-culture plates or glass coverslips using DMEM with 10 % FBS and antibiotics. control inoculated cells were incubated for 1 h with DMEM buffer diluted in DMEM at the same ratio as the virus inoculum. at 24 h after inoculation, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in methanol at 20 \u00b0C. at the indicated time intervals after inoculation, medium from inoculated cultures was collected. the mixture of virus and surfactant protein was applied to a monolayer of 16HBE cells in a 96-well plate. cells were stained with goat anti-HCoV-229E antibody and then with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) and DAPI. il-1Ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IFN-, IFN-, TNF-, granulocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), MIP-1, MIP-1, IP-10, eotaxin, RANTES and monokine induced by IFN- (MIG cell lines, type-I like alveolar epithelial cells, type II cells and cell lines were cultured as for infection. cells were stained with anti-human CD13/APN antibody (BD Biosciences) or isotype control (BD Pharmingen), followed by secondary PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. the primary and secondary antibodies were each incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h in buffer A. the binding of HCoV-229E to surfactant protein was determined using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate for the peroxidase reaction. the lavage fluid was retained for isolation of AMs. the red blood cells were lysed with Pharm Lyse. macrophages were either plated immediately or resuspended in freezing medium (10 % DMSO and 90 % FBS) isolated AMs were plated at a density of 2105 or 5105 cm2. most infections were carried out on AMs cultured for 2 days. cell cultured in DMEM with 10 % FBS, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics. 16HBE cells used in this study grow readily in monolayers. cell line was grown on tissue-culture plates or glass coverslips using DMEM with 10 % FBS and antibiotics. HCoV-229E was originally obtained from the ATCC. HCoV-229E was detected in cells grown on coverslips by immunostaining. primary antibodies for cell markers were mAbs for cytokeratin for type I epithelial cells (clone MNF116; DakoCytomation) and CD68 for AMs (clone KP1; DakoCytomation). stocks of purified virus or medium from HCoV-229E-infected cultures were diluted serially in DMEM. after a 1 h adsorption period, the inoculum was removed and the cells were overlaid with minimal essential medium containing 8 % FBS, antibiotics and 0.5 % SeaKem LE agarose (Cambrex) supernatant samples were pipetted at 50 l per well and mixed with 50 l of the bead mixture. a secondary PE-conjugated antibody was added for 45 min. samples were analysed using a bio-Plex fluorescent reader (Bio-Rad) purified surfactant proteins (SP-A or SP-D) were coated onto microtitre wells (1 g per well in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.6) and incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. a goat anti-HCoV-229E antibody was used for detection of the virus. a paired t-test was used to compare the difference between two groups. a value of P0.05 was considered significant for all methods."}
