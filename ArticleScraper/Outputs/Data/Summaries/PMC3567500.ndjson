{"summary": "the fast dynamics of these interactions make necessary the existence of tightly regulated mechanisms to guarantee that each of the organelles involved in these processes retains its own identity. sorting and retrieval of cargo and constituents and efficient vesicular fusion and fission are often mediated by different protein complexes that bind to the surface of the participating compartments. PI(4)P is known to participate in the regulation of trafficking in the Golgi apparatus. synthesis is under the control of four PI-4-Kinases (PI4Ks) in mammalian cells. PI4KIII and PI4KIII are the major contributors of PI(4)P. PI4KII and PI4KIII can act sequentially in Golgi and endosomes. to date, only a few extra-Golgi functions have been described for PI4KIII. this includes its participation in regulated exocytosis of secretory granules. PI4KIII kinase activity regulates lysosomal cargo along the secretory endo-lysosomal pathway. results PI4KIII kinase activity regulates LAMP dynamics. mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells) stably transduced with lentivirus carrying shRNA to knockdown PI4KIII have reduced in-bulk protein secretion. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts control (ctr) or stably knockdown for PI4KIII (PI4KIII()) were subjected to: (A) Immunoblot for indicated proteins; (B) RT\u2013PCR for PI4KIII mRNA; (C) Immunofluorescence for PI4KIII; and (D\u2013H) live-cell microscopy upon transfection with red fluorescence-tagged LAMP1. this clustering of LAMP1- and LAMP2-positive compartments could be measured as an increase in their size (2.40.8-fold) and a concomitant decrease in their number (3.70.2-fold) compared to control cells. depletion of PI4KIII alters the cellular distribution of LAMP1. cytosolic clusters of interconnected compartments from where tubular projections frequently emanate. transfection of PI4KIII() cells with a dominant-negative kinase-dead mutant of PI4KIII (D656A)KiD was sufficient to reduce LAMP1 tubulation. transfection of control cells with the kinase-dead mutant was sufficient to reproduce most changes in the dynamics and cellular distribution of LAMP1 observed after knocking down PI4KIII. PI4KIII regulates the dynamics of LAMPs through the secretory endo-lysosomal system and that this function requires its kinase activity. cells control or knockdown for PI4KIII (PI4KIII()) were subjected to: (A) Immunofluorescence for LAMP1 (green) and the indicated Golgi markers (red) and green fluorescence-tagged Golgi markers (pink) 4KIII() cells transfected with red fluorescence-tagged LAMP1 and galactosyltransferase. changes in LAMP1 dynamics in PI4KIII() cells were not directly linked to alterations in Golgi structure or function. similar results were observed after treatment of cells with brefeldin A (BFA) that inhibits ER to Golgi transport. PI4KIII regulates lysosomal dynamics Formation of tubular structures from Lys has been described in different conditions. PI4KIII regulates lysosomal dynamics Formation of tubular structures from Lys has been described in different conditions. immunoblot for the indicated proteins of homogenates (Hom) and lysosomes (Lys) from cells control (+) or stably knockdown for PI4KIII(). Arrows indicate precursor (p), intermediate (i) and mature (m) forms of the proteins. the tandem construct highlights autophagosomes with both fluorophores and Lys only with mCherry since GFP is sensitive to the lysosomal acidic pH. mCherry-LC3 labelled the tubular projections in PI4KIII() fibroblasts. immunoblot revealed a significant reduction in the levels of integral membrane proteins (LAMP1, LAMP-2A, LAMP-2B, V-ATPase) and resident lumenal enzymes (Cathepsin B, Cathepsin D, Cathepsin L) the lower levels of lysosomal constituents in PI4KIII() cells are not due to their reduced synthesis or stability in this compartment. reduced levels of lysosomal membrane proteins in PI4KIII-deficient cells may indeed be a consequence of their enhanced exit from this compartment via the abnormal hypertubulation. p62, a cargo receptor for selective autophagy, did not accumulate inside PI4KIII() fibroblasts. immunofluorescence for PI4KIII in cultured cells confirmed its colocalization with LAMP1 (18.75%) and LAMP2 (26.91.3%) in accordance with the levels found when Lys were isolated from these cells. the absence of PI4KIII in some of the LAMP-positive compartments could be a result of the characteristic heterogeneity of the lysosomal compartment. indicated proteins in Hom and Lys of livers from mice untreated or injected with leupeptin (Leup) to block lysosomal degradation. values are expressed as arbitrary densitometric units per g of protein. top: representative immunoblot. PI4KIII could be released from the lysosomal membrane after a high-concentration salt wash (58.610.8% released) or alkaline wash (77.24.8% released) bidimensional electrophoresis and immunoblot for PI4KIII revealed distinctive isoelectric properties for the Lys-associated PI4KIII compared to the cytosolic and the Golgi variants. we attribute the presence of a high percentage of Lys negative for this kinase to the characteristic morphological and functional heterogeneity of the lysosomal population and to the fact that LAMP1 will label both Lys but also late endosomes. we also found a weak but consistent association of the PI(4)P-binding probe FAPP-PH-GFP to isolated Lys in vitro. we first examined possible changes in the lysosomal association of clathrin and its cognate adaptors in PI4KIII-deficient cells. we found that levels of clathrin (Clath HC) were markedly increased (3-fold) in Lys isolated from PI4KIII() cells. fibroblasts subjected to increasing centrifugation forces K, 1000 g. bidimensional electrophoresis and immunoblot for PI4KIII of the vesicles in (D) and lysosomes. PI4KIII, clathrin and lysosomal membrane proteins showed a gradual enrichment towards the smaller sized vesicles. PI4KIII in the vesicular fraction showed an isoelectric point similar to that observed for lysosomal PI4KIII. we propose that some of these small vesicular carriers would be responsible for the discrete exiting and recycling of lysosomal components. this clearly contrasts with the pronounced loss of lysosomal materials trough the abnormal tubules that form in absence of PI4KIII. out of the three Rabs, Rab9 colocalized with the LAMP1 tubules in PI4KIII() cells. it is possible that inability of adaptor and motor proteins to precisely dock onto molecules of PI4KIII at the lysosomal membrane and on the surface of the carrier vesicles leads to random association. lysosomal tubulation occurs in response to nutritional changes (starvation/refeeding) cells respond to consumption of Lys by autophagy, increasing the amount of lysosomal efflux through tubules. PI4KIII is required for proper sorting of recycled lysosomal materials during lysosomal reformation after prolonged starvation. study found tubulation during refeeding is regulated by PI(4)P-5-Kinase (PIP5K) 1B and 1A located at lysosomal budding areas and in the tips of the tubules, respectively. knockdown of PIP5K1B almost completely abolished tubule formation and lead to enlarged autolysosomes. ptain A revealed that in the absence of PIP5K1A, the luminal content was efficiently retained in Lys whereas it gained access to tubules when the PI4KIII knockdown was superimposed on those cells. these results highlight the dependence on PI4KIII but not on PIP5K1A for proper sorting. phenotype of cells defective in PI4KIII was still observed under basal conditions even in the absence of PIP5KB or PIP5KA. pepstatin A co-staining in the double knockdown demonstrated inefficient sorting and presence of lysosomal content in the tubules. kinase activity regulates LAMP dynamics. mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells) stably transduced with lentivirus carrying shRNA to knockdown PI4KIII (758% decrease in protein and mRNA levels) have reduced (1.50.4-fold) in-bulk protein secretion. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts control (ctr) or stably knockdown for PI4KIII (PI4KIII()) were subject to: (A) Immunoblot for the indicated proteins; (B) RT\u2013PCR for PI4KIII mRNA; (C) Immunofluorescence for PI4KIII; and (D\u2013H) live-cell microscopy upon transfection with red fluorescence-tagged LAMP1. positive compartments could be measured as an increase in their size (2.40.8-fold) and a concomitant decrease in their number (3.70.2-fold) compared to control cells. depletion of PI4KIII alters the cellular distribution of LAMP1. cytosolic clusters of interconnected compartments from where tubular projections frequently emanated. transfection of PI4KIII() cells with a plasmid expressing the human variant of this protein (huPI4KIIIWT) was sufficient to reduce LAMP1 tubulation (Figure 2F; Supplementary Movie S2) and clustering. ad mutant was sufficient to reproduce most changes in the dynamics and cellular distribution of LAMP1 observed after knocking down PI4KIII. PI4KIII regulates the dynamics of LAMPs through the secretory endo-lysosomal system. PI4KIII does not impact LAMP1 dynamics at the Golgi or endosomal compartments. cells control or knockdown for PI4KIII (PI4KIII()) were subjected to: (A) Immunofluorescence for LAMP1 (green) and the indicated Golgi markers (red). individual and merged channels for PI4KIII cells are shown here and for control cells in Supplementary Figure S3A. tagged PI4KIII() cells were not directly linked to alterations in Golgi structure or function. similar results were observed after treatment of cells with brefeldin A (BFA) that inhibits ER to Golgi transport. late endosomes are not the site of action of PI4KIII on the regulation of LAMP1 tubulation. PI4KIII regulates lysosomal dynamics Formation of tubular structures from Lys has been described in different conditions. immunoblot for the indicated proteins of homogenates (Hom) and lysosomes (Lys) from cells control (+) or stably knockdown for PI4KIII(). Arrows indicate precursor (p), intermediate (i) and mature (m) forms of the proteins. the tandem construct highlights autophagosomes with both fluorophores and Lys only with mCherry since GFP is sensitive to the lysosomal acidic pH. we found that only mCherry-LC3 labelled the tubular projections in PI4KIII() fibroblasts indicating that they originate from autolysosomes (red). blot revealed a significant reduction in the levels of integral membrane proteins (LAMP1, LAMP-2A, LAMP-2B, V-ATPase) and resident lumenal enzymes (Cathepsin B, Cathepsin D, Cathepsin L) the lower levels of lysosomal constituents in PI4KIII() cells are not due to their reduced synthesis or stability in this compartment. p62, a cargo receptor for selective autophagy, did not accumulate inside PI4KIII() fibroblasts. absence of PI4KIII results in marked changes in the lysosomal compartment. a fraction of cellular PI4KIII associates with Lys. d cells confirmed its colocalization with LAMP1 (18.75%) and LAMP2 (26.91.3%) the absence of PI4KIII in some of the LAMP-positive compartments could be a result of the characteristic heterogeneity of the lysosomal compartment. however, levels of PI4KIII in Lys did not increase upon blockade of lysosomal proteolysis in cultured cells. values are expressed as arbitrary densitometric units per g of protein. most Lys-associated PI4KIII was located at the lysosomal membrane instead of in the lysosomal matrix. bidimensional electrophoresis and immunoblot for PI4KIII revealed distinctive isoelectric properties for the Lys-associated PI4KIII. the lysosomal pool of PI4KIII was comprised mainly of a net negatively charged isoform (pI 3.5), thus discarding possible Golgi contamination in the lysosomal fraction. we found a weak but consistent association of the PI(4)P-binding probe FAPP-PH-GFP to isolated Lys in vitro. we also found a weak but consistent association of the PI(4)P-binding probe FAPP-PH-GFP to isolated Lys in vitro. clathrin (Clath HC) was markedly increased (3-fold) in Lys isolated from PI4KIII() cells. live imaging revealed clathrin movement along the base and the length of the LAMP1-positive tubule projections. also noticeable was the increase of the adaptor protein AP-2. electrophoresis and immunoblot for PI4KIII of the vesicles in (D) and lysosomes. immunoblot for the indicated proteins in homogenates (Hom) and cytosolic vesicles isolated in the 500-K spin. PI4KIII, clathrin and lysosomal membrane proteins (LAMP1) demonstrated a gradual enrichment towards the smaller sized vesicles. of PI4KIII in the vesicular fraction displayed an isoelectric point similar to that observed for lysosomal PI4KIII. we propose that some of these small vesicular carriers would be responsible for the discrete exiting and recycling of lysosomes. this clearly contrasts with the pronounced loss of lysosomal materials trough the abnormal tubules that form in absence of PI4KIII. the three Rabs, Rab9 colocalized with the LAMP1 tubules in PI4KIII() cells. it is possible that the inability of adaptor and motor proteins to precisely dock onto molecules of PI4KIII leads to their random association with the membrane. PI4KIII is required for proper sorting of recycled lysosomal materials during lysosomal reformation after prolonged starvation. lysosomal tubulation occurs in response to nutritional changes (starvation/refeeding) cells respond to consumption of Lys by autophagy, increasing the amount of lysosomal efflux through tubules. tubulation during refeeding is regulated by PI(4)P-5-Kinase (PIP5K) 1B and 1A located at lysosomal budding areas and in the tips of the tubules, respectively. we performed single and double knockdowns for PIP5K1B or PIP5K1A and PI4KIII in fibroblasts. despite hypertubulation, the luminal content was efficiently retained in Lys. it gained access to tubules when the PI4KIII knockdown was superimposed on those cells. results highlight the dependence on PI4KIII but not on PIP5K1A for proper sorting. phenotype of cells defective in PI4KIII still observed under basal conditions even in the absence of PIP5KB or PIP5KA. pepstatin A co-staining in the double knockdown demonstrated inefficient sorting and presence of lysosomal content in the tubules. the absence of PI4KIII and the failure to generate PI(4)P at the lysosomal membrane leads to formation of elongated tubular structures from the lysosomal surface. the absence of PI4KIII results in (1) unrestricted association of clathrin-coat components and its adaptor molecules to the sites of vesicle formation. previous studies have characterized a role for PI4KIII in different aspects of Golgi maintenance, structure and function. the impairment in trafficking of proteins from the Golgi to endocytic/lysosomal compartments once PI4KIII is not present is discrete. only the catalytically active form of PI4KIII can rescue the hypertubulating lysosomal phenotype. we place the site of PI(4)P action directly at the Lys rather than in the Golgi or any other compartment. it is plausible that PI(4)P at the lysosomal membrane facilitates efficient fission of carrier lysosomal vesicles. rin to Lys in the absence of PI4KIII requires further investigation. but we propose that it may reflect a failure to confine them at specific membrane locations. if PI(4)P or any of its downstream products are part of this dual signal, then their loss would not abrogate membrane recruitment of adaptor molecules per se. this binding via multiple low affinity membrane interactions could explain their increased association. the increase in tubule formation in PI4KIII-deficient cells is independent of presence or absence of PIP5Ks. the active conversion of PI(4)P to PI(4,5)P2 at specific membrane sites where PIP5K1B localizes may favour conversion of vesicles into elongated tubular carriers. new function of PI4KIII in Lys should have an impact on many aspects of lysosomal biology and on cellular processes requiring efficient recycling of lysosomal material. we propose that this new function of PI4KIII in Lys should have an impact on many aspects of lysosomal biology. in maTek chambers 24 h post transfection using a microscope (TCS SP5) with a motorized x-y stage for multiple position finding (Leica) and an 8000-Hz resonant scanner (lenses: HCX Plan Apo CS 63.0 NA 1.40 oil) image sequences were processed with ImageJ and QuickTime. chondria, microsomes and PM were isolated from rat liver using previously specified procedures. cytosolic fractions were obtained from the cytosolic fraction (supernatant of centrifugation of a cell lysate 1 h at 100 000 g) by successive centrifugation at 300 000, 400 000 and 500 000 g for 1 h. animals and cell culture Adult male Wistar rats and C57BL/6 male mice were used. all cells were cultured in complete DMEM medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum. electron microscopy and immunogold of cells cultured in monolayers was done after fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 1% uranyl acetate staining. samples were viewed with a Jeol JEM-1200EX electron microscope. PI4K activity was measured as previously described (Sweeney et al, 2002). secretion was determined by using a modification of the method earlier described (Blagoveshchenskaya et al, 2008)."}
