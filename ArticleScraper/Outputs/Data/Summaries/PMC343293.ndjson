{"summary": "the first known case of SARS was discovered in south china on 16 November 2002. the disease has spread rapidly along international air routes to other parts of the world. a novel coronavirus is the causative agent of SARS. this kind of support is vital for making well-informed decisions when designing and following up epidemic control strategies or issuing and updating travel advisories. the WHO also uses this epidemiological mapping technology to predict environmental and climatic conditions conducive for some outbreaks. on 16 November 2002, the first known case of SARS was discovered in southern china. the number of reported SARS cases has increased exponentially, prompting the world to issue a global alert on 12 March 2003. geoinformatics is the science and technology of gathering, storing, visualising, analysing, interpreting, modelling, distributing and using spatially referenced (geographically referenced) information. geoinformatics plays an important role in the study and control of epidemics [11-14]. this also applies to the 2003 global outbreak of SARS. the internet is a unique source of reliable, up-to-date information on SARS. this includes the latest SARS case counts and lists of affected areas. examples of geographic mapping of SARS WHO Early in the 2003 outbreak, the WHO started publishing a static, non-interactive daily world map of the \"cumulative number of reported probable cases\" the size of the graduated blue circle over an affected country on these maps reflected the cumulative number of reported cases in that country. the WHO dropped the \"type of transmission\" from its daily world map of SARS and switched to a choropleth rendition to display the \"number of current probable cases\" the maps are generated by Corda's own interactive data visualisation engine (PopChart + OptiMap 5.0) they are available online as a free public service to educate visitors about SARS situation on a global and national level. the WHO provides up-to-date SARS affected area information on its Web site http://www.who.int/csr/sarsareas/en/. the graph allows users to visually monitor and appreciate the epidemic's progress. mapAsia's provincial SARS distribution maps of china adopted a dichromatic (from light green to maroon) choropleth scheme with graduated pie charts depicting the relative numbers of discharged/under treatment/dead cases in affected provinces. some of MapAsia's Hong Kong maps also traced SARS spread within 250-metre coloured buffer zones. ESRI China's \"SARS GIS\" \u2013 SARS case distribution in Hong Kong as of 30 April 2003. the interactive \"SARS GIS\" maps are regularly updated based on latest figures from the WHO and Hong Kong Department of Health. users can type a location (English or Chinese input) to find the nearest five infected buildings. the service can also show the locations of district hospitals on the maps. the only infected building seen in this screenshot falls within a public housing area. the maps are generated on the fly based on the latest SARS data. the service is powered by ESRI's ArcIMS and ArcSDE (Spatial Database Engine) GIS technology. subscribers can access SARS-related data in Chinese or English. other maps SuperMap GIS Technologies, Inc. has produced an online interactive SARS map. the map shows SARS infected areas in Hong Kong over a five-day period. the maps were generated using ESRI ArcView GIS and CDC data. an interactive web-based map of the world showing the spread of SARS in different countries based on WHO data is also available. the maps were produced by the WHO's public health mapping team. they were updated every 1\u20132 days and updated every 1\u20132 days. the WHO also published graphical epidemic curves of SARS. a toolTip appears with the cumulative number of reported cases. an accompanying graph shows SARS deaths by country. users can drill-down into the united states map to view how many cases have been reported. web browser screenshot by this author of Corda's SARS worldwide infections/recoveries/deaths time line graph as of 4 July 2003 http://www.corda.com/examples/go/map/sars_time.cfm. also of interest is the news that the US National Cancer Institute is currently using Corda PopChart and OptiMap to create its Section 508-compliant maps, charts and graphs of cancer mortality rates for the united states. mapAsia's provincial SARS distribution map of China adopted a dichromatic (from light green to maroon) choropleth rendition and graduated pie charts. the small pie chart over Shanxi (162 cases) and the large one over Guangdong (1359 cases) citizens have the right to know SARS distribution where they live in order to take all necessary precautions to protect themselves. esrihk.com/SARS/Eng/sars_eng_main.htm provides comprehensive information on SARS case distribution in the world, china and Hong Kong. the maps were created with ESRI ArcIMS, a GIS-driven Internet map server, and feature a handy toolbar that provides the sort of functionality found in the standard ArcView GIS desktop interface. map.com/en/viewer.asp \"mapService=SARSMap\" highlights the relationship between the predominant housing type and infected buildings. the mapping, overlay analysis and point-in-polygon analysis are used to explore and highlight the relationship between various aspects of population distribution and infected buildings on the maps. .b3e.jussieu.fr/sarsnet/www/activity.html was inspired from WHO/FluNet http://rhone.b3e.jussieu.fr/flunet/. it provides comprehensive up-to-date SARS surveillance statistics from different countries and for different time periods. a software company has produced an online interactive SARS distribution map. the map shows SARS infected areas in Hong Kong over a five-day period. the map was generated using ESRI ArcView GIS and CDC data. maps are available from http://www.mapcruzin.com/sars-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome/. an interactive web-based map of the world showing the spread of SARS in different countries based on WHO data is also available from MapTell.com. map users always need to be alert for \"lies\" that range from legitimate and appropriate suppression of some details selectively to help the user focus on what needs to be seen. sound epidemiological principles and methods should provide the foundation for all data analyses to be displayed on maps [23]."}
