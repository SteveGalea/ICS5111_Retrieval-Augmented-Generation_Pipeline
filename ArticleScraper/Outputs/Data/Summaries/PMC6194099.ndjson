{"summary": "the critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which add another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. a new study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health. it analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes. this study will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future. challenges in adoption and use of recommended codes and need for an informatics savvy workforce were identified as some of the issues in the move towards ELR [21] recurring theme across these studies was assessing the quality of data, including exploring new venues to measure [22-24] and improve it. MEDSS is the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance at a state level for Minnesota and operational since 2008. it holds data on reportable conditions and receives ELRs submitted to the state public health agency. 153,880 lab tests/results were reported electronically for 2017 across six health systems and four reference labs. the focus included both on-boarding (process of shifting to electronic exchange for either new reporting or migration/upgrade to different standard) and on-going submissions. the focus included both on-boarding (process of shifting to electronic exchange for either new reporting or on-going submissions) evaluation of messages not mapped to any disease program in MEDSS was identified as a priority. the number of non-reportable tests that get submitted and added to data in MEDSS was examined. the number of incoming messages which get rejected due to errors was examined to quantify the need for additional technical assistance. test messages using NIST Test Bed - Ability to map content to HL7 fields Contextual DQ (Completeness) C. Submit HL7 test messages to MEDSS - Capability to submit data in R (required) fields Contextual DQ (Completeness, Value-added data) D. Checking for message formats and codes which may not be present in current HL7 test feeds Contextual DQ (Completeness, Relevancy) the analysis also revealed the need for collaboration and some processes depend on coordination across MEDSS informatics team, information technology (IT) staff and public health program professionals. data on race was present in 2,310 messages and 1680 messages received in that time frame had data on Ethnicity. 270 number of messages wherein race from ELR feed was different than one currently recorded in MEDSS. identified Issues, data quality impact and correlations with data exchange processes. data quality Enhancement Race Data 2,310 / 3,651 (63%) Contextual DQ (Completeness, Value-added data) Ethnicity Data 1,680 / 3,651 (46%) Discussion Federal regulations and incentives have offered the needed momentum towards electronic reporting to public health. open source software tools have been proposed to support data quality checks for both immunization reporting [39] and ELR [23,40]. implementation and maintenance of these tools requires both financial and technical resources. a multipronged approach with automated tools, data exchange partners education, technical assistance, regular updates of codes/tools, organizational commitment and national guidelines. a large volume of ELR submitters are reference labs which are not required to collect race and ethnicity data. some DQ errors are attributed to frequency of upgrade of codes/validation engine that are driven by organizational resources (finances, trained personnel) / institutional priorities."}
