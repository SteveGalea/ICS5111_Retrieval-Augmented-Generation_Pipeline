{"summary": "the first new pathogen of the era of globalization has been identified. the pathogen causes fever, pulmonary edema, and diffuse alveolar damage. the pathogen causes fever, pulmonary edema, and diffuse alveolar damage. avirus in that, to date, is the only member known to cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans [8]. the clinical symptoms of SARS are those of a lower respiratory tract infection and are accompanied by damage to the lungs [6,9,10]. more than 20% of patients presenting with watery diarrhea [11]. a number of excellent review articles on the clinical and molecular aspects of SARS epidemiology have been published. this review highlights the progress made in revealing the molecular aspects of SARS-CoV biology and how such information may lead to strategies for disease prevention. group III includes the turkey coronavirus (TCoV), pheasant coronavirus and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). 61 SARS-CoV genomic sequences have been analyzed representing different phases of the epidemic (early, middle, and late) and two isolates from palm civets. progress in SARS-CoV genome-based evolutionary biology RNA viruses use a variety of mechanisms to exchange their genetic repertoire. the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP) have a built in error rate that allows diversification of the genomic sequence as replication proceeds. a recombination breakpoint suggests multiple genetic origins for this molecule. the mechanism of SARS virus pathogenesis in vivo may reflect both the effect of viral replication in target cells and host immune responses. the molecular basis for SARS-CoV replication, the signaling pathways affected, and the inflammatory responses provoked by viral infection are not yet understood. Akt induction appears to be insufficient to prevent the virus-induced apoptosis. Exactly how SARS-CoV manipulates these cellular signaling pathways to facilitate viral replication remains to be determined. ACE2 is the cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV. the receptor-binding sites on the virion are located in the 12\u2013672 amino acid region of the S protein. the spread of the disease was controlled by strict quarantine protocols and patient-isolation measures. vaccinal development Vaccines are the best and least expensive prophylactic measures against pathogens that cause epidemics in humans. despite these potential pitfalls in the development of a human vaccine, efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent another SARS outbreak are underway. inactivated whole virus Takasuka et al (2004) have reported that subcutaneous administration of UV-inactivated purified SARS-CoV virion elicits a high level of humoral immunity. the antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the virus. inactivated virus also induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation. intra-muscular immunization of mice with a plasmid DNA construct encoding the full-length N protein was shown to elicit serum anti-N antibodies and spenocyte proliferative responses against the N protein. in this case, significant levels of N-specific IgG in the mice sera were detected, suggesting that the engineered bacteria may serve as a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV [65]. attenuated live virus The third possibility is a genetically engineered version of live SARS-CoV for traits such as attenuated phenotype, increased immunogenicity, and safe handling. a full-length cDNA-containing plasmid has been developed from which synthetic infectious viral RNA can be produced. the structure resembles the 530 loop of 16s rRNA involved in translation initiation. this unique structure presents an attractive target for tunnel binding antiviral drugs. despite these potential pitfalls in the development of a human vaccine, efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent another SARS outbreak are underway. inactivated whole virus elicits a high level of humoral immunity. antibodies elicited in mice recognized both the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N proteins of the virus. inactivated virus also induced regional lymph node T-cell proliferation. immunization of mice with a plasmid DNA construct encoding the full-length N protein was shown to elicit serum anti-N antibodies and spenocyte proliferative responses against the N protein. in this case, significant levels of N-specific IgG in the mice sera were detected, suggesting that the engineered bacteria may serve as a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV. recombinant virus elicits potent neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys. the major epitope is mapped to the virus receptor-binding region. co-expression of SARS-CoV S, M and N expression plasmids in human 293T cells result in the formation of SARS-CoV pseudoparticles. elicited antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) present in the S1 region of SARS-CoV. the antibodies effectively inhibited the S-protein mediated SARS-pseudovirus entry up to 50%, suggesting the potential of the inactivated SARS-CoV as antigen for vaccine development. significant levels of N-specific IgG in the mice sera were detected. this suggests that the bacteria may serve as a mucosal vaccine against SARS-CoV. in the case of SARS-CoV there remains the threat of introducing live virus into the environment from partially inactivated vaccine. new system allows for functional analysis of each gene in the context of infection and can be used for making attenuated strains for vaccine development. a lack of complete understanding in the areas of animal models of the disease and host immune responses to the evolving molecular diversity of this newly emerged human virus. author(s) declare that they have no competing interests. authors contributed equally to the intellectual content of this review article."}
