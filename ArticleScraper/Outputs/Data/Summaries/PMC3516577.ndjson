{"summary": "members of the family Filoviridae, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) are the causative agents of viral hemorrhagic fever in central africa. worldwide concern relates to the importation of infected individuals and the potential use of filoviruses as biothreat pathogens. catB and catL are members of a family of 11 human cysteine proteases. they are highly abundant, broadly expressed and exhibit nonspecific proteolytic activity within lysosomes. catL is important for epidermal homeostasis and regulation of the hair cycle. a double knockout mouse lacking CatB and CatL has been generated. the role of cathepsins has been demonstrated to be important for the entry of reovirus, SARS-CoV, henipaviruses and ZEBOV. in vivo replication of mouse-adapted ZEBOV is independent of CatB and CatL. cell culture and virus propagation Vero E6 cells and mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) cell lines lacking cathepsin B, cathepsin L or both cathepsins were cultured in a 37\u00b0C incubator, 5% CO2. the supernatants were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 1,500g for 10 min, aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen. a mixture of 2.4% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and 2 Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 4% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine was added and kept for one hour at 37\u00b0C. EBOV inoculated cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and removed from BSL4 following standard operating procedures. pretreatment occurred with 200 l of 100 nM BafA1, 100 M CA074, 10 M CatL-inhibitor V or no inhibitor for 1 hour. 200 l ZEBOVwt (MOI = 1) were added and cells were incubated for another hour. on day 3 and 7 post infection 3 mice of each group were euthanized. blood, liver and spleen samples were collected and stored at 80\u00b0C. blood samples and supernatant collected from infected cells were thawed. the ELISA used VSV antigen in a 1100 dilution. sera from mice infected with MA-ZEBOV were inactivated by -irradiation. the furin knockout and mouse-adapted variants of ZEBOV [28]\u2013[30] were propagated in vero E6 cells. the supernatants were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 1,500g for 10 min. a mixture of 2.4% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and 2 Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 4% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine was added containing the appropriate concentration of inhibitor (BafA1 100, 50, 25, 10 nM; CA074 (CatB) 100, 50, 25, 10 M; CatL-inhibitor V 10, 5, 2.5, 1 M) cell lines were seeded in a 24-well plate the day before the experiment. 200 l ZEBOVwt or MA-ZEBOV (MOI = 1) were added and incubated for one hour. samples were stored at 80\u00b0C before titration on vero E6 cells. blood samples and supernatant collected from infected cells were thawed. media was removed from cells and triplicates were inoculated with each dilution. the number of foci was determined by immunostaining. only the inhibition of CatB resulted in significantly reduced virus entry. catL proteolytic activity did not appear to be obligatory for ZEBOV uptake into vero E6 cells. a representative experiment performed in triplicates shows the standard error of the mean. the role of catB in cellular uptake differs among Ebola virus species. CIEBOV, REBOV and SEBOV produced foci independent of the presence of the catL inhibitor. the entry of none of the EBOVs was affected by the catL inhibitor. titers were determined on vero E6 cells using a TCID50 assay. the results demonstrate that ZEBOV replicates to similar titers in the presence of catB or catL inhibitor. the presence of both inhibitors reduced ZEBOV replication by about 1 log. cell lines were seeded the night before infection in a 24-well-plate. one hour prior to infection cells were incubated with inhibitors directed against the indicated cathepsin(s) or endosomal acidification (Baf A1) cells were infected for 1 hour with 0.2 ml ZEBOVwt (B) or MA-ZEBOV (C) at an MOI of 1. catB/, catL/ and control mice were infected with 1,000 LD50 of MA-ZEBOV. on day 3 and 7 post-infection 3 mice in each group were euthanized. all animals in the catL/ group succumbed to infection between days 7 and 9. the one surviving mouse showed signs of disease and recovered. survival (A) and weight curves (B) for MA-ZEBOV infection are shown. VSV antibodies were detected using ELISA to confirm infection (D) catB/, catL/ or control mice (n = 3) were infected with 1,000 LD50 of MA-ZEBOV. ZEBOV entry in vitro is catB-mediated. both viruses entered vero E6 cells in a catB-dependent manner. a different in vitro assay based on foci reduction using the same inhibitors. mutations throughout the viral genome acquired during the adaptation process of ZEBOV to the mouse have no influence on ZEBOV uptake. mutations throughout the viral genome acquired during the adaptation process of ZEBOV to the mouse have no influence on ZEBOV entry. infection of all viruses was reduced in the presence of BafA1. only the maximum concentration of the catB inhibitor had an effect on BEBOV uptake into vero E6 cells. entry of none of the EBOVs was affected by the catL inhibitor. a representative experiment performed in triplicates is shown. errors indicate the standard error of the mean. ZEBOV replication is largely independent on cathepsin cleavage. ZEBOVwt and MA-ZEBOV replicated similarly well in the absence of catB or catL or both proteases. one-way ANOVA did not find statistically significant p values. one-way ANOVA did not find statistically significant p values. the catB/ and catL/ mice are well characterized [37] and therefore ideal to determine the importance of catB and catL for ZEBOV replication in vivo. mouse cathepsins are functionally similar to human cathepsins and important for ZEBOV-GP-mediated entry [11], [38] mice were infected with 1,000 LD50 of MA-ZEBOV. mutations in the glycoprotein gene of MA-ZEBOV during in vivo replication, we determined the full GP sequence and found no mutations. groups of mice were i.p. infected with 10 ffu MA-ZEBOV (1,000 LD50) or 1105 pfu VSV (serotype Indiana) and monitored daily for weight loss and signs of illness. survival (A) and weight curves (B) for MA-ZEBOV infection are shown pleen samples taken on day 3 and 7 post VSV infection no viral RNA was detected. ELISA performed with serum samples of these mice showed that all animals were infected as indicated by the detection of VSV-specific antibodies. this data demonstrates that there is no obvious difference between catB/, catL/ and control mice in susceptibility to viral infections and the development of immune responses. HIV-1 particles are largely spherical and the mechanism of uptake is receptor mediated through the interaction of its surface glycoprotein gp160 with CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4 [40] in the infectious ZEBOV context the interactions of GP with VP24 and VP40 (missing in pseudotype particles) may further influence the cellular uptake mechanism [14], suggesting that HIV-1- and VSV-based pseudotype particle entry could be different from those of filovirus particles studies using bone marrow derived macrophages and dendritic cells derived from cathepsin knockout mice did not identify a single cathepsin as an essential factor for TLR9 signaling. it seems reasonable to speculate that in the absence of CatB and CatL, other endosomal proteases will mediate EBOV-GP cleavage enabling cathepsin-independent EBOV entry into target cells. in vivo is CatB- and CatL-independent. catB seems to play a more considerable role in ZEBOV uptake than any other EBOV species."}
