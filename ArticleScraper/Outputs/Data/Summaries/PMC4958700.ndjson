HeLa cells were treated either with (A) GNS-396 or (B) HCQ at different concentrations (1, 10 and 100 mol/L) during 6 h in the presence or absence of 100 nmol/L bafilomycine A1. HCQ was used as a positive control of autophagy inhibition. omycin A1 was used as a positive control of autophagy inhibition. after 4 h exposure of HeLa cells to GNS-396, accumulation of LC3-II was observed. accumulation of LC3-II was not enhanced in the presence of HCQ. SkBr3 mRFP-EGFP-LC3 stable cell line was treated during 6 h. accumulation of yellow punctua (dots) corresponding to autophagosomes or non-acidic autolysosomes was noticeable.
