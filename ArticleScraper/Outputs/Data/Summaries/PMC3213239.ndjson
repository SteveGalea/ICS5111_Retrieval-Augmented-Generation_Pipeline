{"summary": "Background Antisense oligomer induced exon skipping aims to reduce the severity of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. a subset of dystrophin mutations are intra-exonic and therefore have the potential to compromise oligomer efficiency. it remains unclear whether all patient polymorphisms within antisense oligomer target sequences will require the costly process. splice switching AOs are designed to target motifs in the normal dystrophin gene transcript. the most common type of mutation is a deletion of one or more exons. splice switching AOs are designed to target motifs in the normal dystrophin gene transcript. dystrophin gene changes, such as intra-exonic insertion/deletions/substitutions collectively represent less than 30% of cases but are spread across the dystrophin gene. the development of optimal exon skipping strategies for most DMD mutations are best evaluated in cells from the patient. the optimal sequence to excise exon 25 was then prepared and supplied by AVI Biopharma Inc (Bothell, WA) the optimal sequence to excise exon 25 was then prepared and supplied as a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide (PPMO-k) [8,9] patients fibroblasts were cultured to 80% confluency, washed with PBS, detached with 0.25% Trypsin (w/v) (Gibco), inactivated with media containing 10% FCS, pelleted by centrifugation at 600 g and then resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum and the MyoD adenoviral vector at a multiplicity of infection of 250. a 1 L aliquot was removed after 35 cycles (myoblasts) and 40 cycles (MyoD converted fibroblasts) a 1 L aliquot was subjected to nested PCR to amplify exons 18 to 26 for 30 cycles (myoblasts) or 35 cycles (MyoD converted fibroblasts) samples were vortexed briefly, sonicated for 1 second, 4-8 times at a setting of 30/100 on an ultrasonic processor. gel contents were electrophoresed at 16\u00b0C on a 3-10% Tris- Bis/Glycine SDS gradient gel at pH 8.8 with a 3% stacking gel pH 6.8. AO design and synthesis Oligomers consisting of 2'-O-methyl (2OMe) modified bases on a phosphorothioate backbone were synthesized on an Expedite 8909 synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Melbourne, Australia) the optimal sequence to excise exon 25 was then prepared and supplied by AVI Biopharma Inc (Bothell, WA) fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% foetal calf serum (FCS) (Serana, Bunbury, Australia), 1% GlutaMaxTM-I (Gibco, Melbourne, Australia), 10 U/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 10 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B (Sigma, Sydney, Australia) 2OMeAOs were transfected as lipoplexes with Lipofectamine 2000\u00ae (1:1 w/w) (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM media (Gibco) as per manufacturer's instructions. RNA extraction and nested RT-PCR Total RNA was harvested 96 h after transfection from duplicate wells using TRIzol\u00ae (Invitrogen) AT C gel Analysis, Imaging and Sequencing PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels in TAE buffer. relative exon skipping efficiency was estimated by densitometry of the full length and AO induced PCR products. the identity of induced transcripts was confirmed by band stab isolation [13], purification of templates using UltraClean spin columns. gel contents were electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane overnight at 18\u00b0C at 290 mA in a transfer buffer without methanol. Dystrophin was detected with NCL-DYS2 monoclonal anti-dystrophin (Novocastra, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK) applied at a dilution of 1:100 for 2 hours at room temperature. 2OMeAOs designed to target predicted splicing motifs in dystrophin exon 25 were transfected into normal human myoblasts. in normal cells, all AOs tested demonstrated robust skipping of exon 25 at 100 nM and were effective at the lower concentration of 2.5 nM. annealing co-ordinates of these AOs can be found in Table 1. mutation occurs 11 bases downstream from the 5' end of H25A(+95+119) the dystrophin (c.3385 Insertion A) mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing (A) this mutation occurs within the annealing site of H25A(+95+119) suggesting a number of potential scenarios for the binding of H25A(+95+119) or H25A(+95+A+119) the 2OMeAOs H25A(+95+119) and patient-specific H25A(+95+A+119) were transfected into normal myoblasts (A, C and E) and MyoD adenovirus converted (c.3385 Insertion A) patient myoblasts (B, D and F) at the concentration indicated. PPMO-k H25A(+95+A+119) mediated excision of exon 25 from patient cells. cells were collected 7 days after transfection for analysis of dystrophin mRNA (A) and protein (B) levels. oligomer annealed across a single base insertion that would loop-out and/or alter the secondary structure of the pre-mRNA to further compromise exon recognition and selection. previously mismatched oligomer studies used sequences with mismatched bases but no deletions within the oligomer:mRNA duplex. testing of oligomers in patient cells will be the most appropriate way to determine if patient-specific mutations or polymorphisms compromise AO efficacy. we predicted that personalizing an oligomer optimized in normal cells to match the patient sequence would further enhance efficacy. this proved otherwise in the case presented here. nearly half of dystrophin exons are in-frame and therefore many intra-exonic mutations could be addressed by single exon skipping. the presence of intra-exonic mutations or SNPs may increase or decrease exon skipping efficacy by altering splice motifs or directly compromising oligomer annealing. the women's & children's hospital, Adelaide, south australia."}
