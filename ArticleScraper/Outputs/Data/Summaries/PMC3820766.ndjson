{"summary": "hepatitis B is the most common risk factor for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the mortality of HBV-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) may exceed 60%. iTRAQ method has been used to study a variety of diseases. the exclusion criteria included pregnant and lactating females, patients that had been treated with antivirals or immunomodulatory therapy within the previous six months. the exclusion criteria included the presence of other factors causing active liver diseases (e.g. autoimmune, drug-induced liver, alcoholic liver and inherited metabolic liver diseases), concomitant human immunodeficiency virus infection or congenital immune deficiency diseases. 82 20.7 12.1 8.03107 7 CHB patient Male 28 + + + + 38.0 84 22.4 14.1 1.76106 8 CHB patient Male 32 + + + + 39.0 43 15.9 13.5 8.18106 9 CHB patient Male 24 + + + + + 36.0 38 21.6 12.9 1.02106 10 CHB patient Male 22 + + + + 49.0 57 18.7 14.2 3.21106 11 HBV-induced ACLF patient Male 39 + + + + 26.0 35 463.5 HBsAg HBsAb HBcAb AST (14.5\u201340.0 U/l) ALT (3\u201335 U/l) TBIL (4.0\u201323.9 mol/l) PT (11.0\u201314.5 sec) HBV DNA (IU/ml) 1 Healthy control Male 36 + 21.0 31.0 13.8 12.3 100 2 Healthy control Male 30 + 15.0 24.0 20.1 11.1 100 3 Healthy control Male 30 + 19.2 28.6 15.6 12.8 100 4 CHB TBIL, total bilirubin, PT, prothrombin time; PT, prothrombin time; HBV, hepatitis B virus; ACLF, acute-on-chronic liver failure. informed patient consent was obtained prior to participation in this study. the reaction was terminated by adding MilliQ water. the samples were labeled with 114, 115, 116 and 117 mass-tagged iTRAQ reagents. the labeled peptides were then dried in a vacuum centrifuge. the peptides were loaded onto a micrOTOF-Q II-nano LC system. mass spectra were acquired in the 250\u20131,600 m/z range every second for 60 min. the data were screened against the human sequence database. western blotting kits showed the greatest differences in expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases. the protein lysates were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. HBV-induced ACLF was diagnosed using the previously described criteria (10,11) the exclusion criteria included pregnant and lactating females, patients that had been treated with antivirals or immunomodulatory therapy within the previous six months. the presence of other factors causing active liver diseases (e.g. autoimmune, drug-induced liver, alcoholic liver and inherited metabolic liver diseases) 8.03107 7 CHB patient Male 28 + + + 38.0 84 22.4 14.1 1.76106 8 CHB patient Male 32 + + + 39.0 43 15.9 13.5 8.18106 9 CHB patient Male 24 + + + + 36.0 38 21.6 12.9 1.02106 10 CHB patient Male 22 + + + 49.0 57 18.7 14.2 3.21106 11 HBV-induced ACLF patient Male 39 + + + + 26.0 35 463.5 25.5 6.52104 12 HBV-induced HBsAg HBsAb HBeAg HBeAb HBcAb AST (14.5\u201340.0 U/l) ALT (3\u201335 U/l) TBIL (4.0\u201323.9 mol/l) PT (11.0\u201314.5 sec) HBV DNA (IU/ml) 1 Healthy control Male 36 + 21.0 31.0 13.8 12.3 100 2 Healthy control Male 30 + 15.0 24.0 20.1 11.1 100 3 Healthy control Male 30 + 19.2 28.6 1 the protocol conforms to the Ethical Guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. the study protocol was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Committee of third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) the reaction was terminated by adding MilliQ water. the samples were labeled with 114, 115, 116 and 117 mass-tagged iTRAQ reagents. the labeled peptides were then dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 200 ml Buffer A. the peptides were loaded onto a micrOTOF-Q II-nano LC system. mass spectra were acquired in the 250\u20131,600 m/z range every second for 60 min. the data were screened against the human sequence database. western blotting five proteins showed the greatest differences in expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases. iTRAQ identified 16 different proteins that had 1.5-fold differences in expression levels between the patients with HBV-induced ACLF and CHB, respectively. reporter group and using m/z 114 as a reference showed significant results (P0.05) some identified protein was lost in the corresponding reporter group, giving no quantification information. the specific information and re-identification will be published in a future study. the 16 proteins that were identified using iTRAQ were classified into six categories, based on protein function. the five proteins that showed the greatest differences in their expression were verified using western blotting. two of the five proteins were not classified according to biological processes. the six categories were transporter, cell adhesion molecule, defence/immunity protein, regulatory molecular, extracellular matrix and unclassified. a new tab CHB, chronic hepatitis B; HBV, hepatitis B virus; ACLF, acute-on-chronic liver failure. the aim of this study was to describe the changes in serum protein levels in patients with CHB and those with HBV-induced ACLF. iTRAQ and western blotting were not classified according to biological processes. levels of apolipoprotein J precursor decreased in the progression of HBV from CHB to ACLF. in this study, it was revealed that levels of the precursor of CRP were decreased in the patients with CHB and markedly increased in the patients with ACLF. apolipoprotein J precursor is important in cell aging and tumorigenesis. in the present study, levels of platelet factor 4 precursor decreased in the progression of hepatitis B to liver failure. this result suggests that further studies are required to investigate the potential of platelet factor 4 precursor as a biomarker in the progression of CHB. levels of VN in the liver tissue were significantly increased in patients with chronic liver disease compared with those in normal controls. the authors aimed to describe changes in serum protein levels in patients with liver dysfunction induced by hepatitis B and patients with severe liver damage (ACLF)"}
