{"summary": "87 per cent of respondents (n=229/266) had vaccinated their cattle in the past year. diseases most commonly vaccinated against were bovine Viral Diarrhoea, Leptospirosis and Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis. vaccination can help to control and eradicate disease, as demonstrated by the global eradication of rinderpest (Normile 2008), and control of rabies, foot and mouth disease and swine erysipelas (Lombard and others 2007). in the UK, vaccination may be carried out by anyone who is deemed capable by the person prescribing the vaccine. one-third of farmers never referred to the vaccine product datasheet. one-third of farmers never referred to the vaccine product datasheet. 48 per cent of farmers administered the two doses in the primary vaccination course at the incorrect interval (Meadows 2010). bluetongue vaccines and one BVDv vaccine were excluded from the survey. at the time the questionnaire was distributed, bluetongue vaccination was not permitted. a BVDv vaccine had recently been taken off the market. izer Lactovac E coli, coronavirus, rotavirus Mastitis Hipra Startvac E coli, Staphylococcus aureus Reproductive Intervet Bovilis BVD BVDv Leptavoid H Leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo Novartis Bovidec BVDv Pfizer Spirovac L borgpetersenii serovar hardjo Respiratory Hipra Hiprabovis IBR Mark participants canvassed at events around the UK, including the dairy event and livestock show, royal Berkshire show, dairy health events. participants were canvassed at events around the UK, including the dairy event and livestock show, royal Berkshire show, dairy health events. paper copies were distributed to approximately 750 cattle farmers at nine agricultural shows and meetings. the link was distributed by email to 13 veterinary practices. questionnaire was developed and distributed to UK farmers between September and November 2011. it contained 14 closed and 9 open-ended questions and took approximately 10 minutes to complete. a cover letter included explaining the purpose of the study. farmers were asked to nominate which vaccines they had used in the past year. multivalent vaccines, providing protection against more than one disease, were placed in multiple categories. all vaccines registered for use in cattle in the UK were excluded from the survey. bovilis Ringvac Tricophyton verrucosum Enteric Intervet Bovivac S Salmonella dublin, S typhimurium Rotavec Corona Escherichia coli, coronavirus, rotavirus Pfizer Lactovac E coli, coronavirus, rotavirus Pfizer Lactovac E coli, coronavirus, rotavirus Mastitis Hipra Startvac E coli, Staphylococcus aureus Reproductive the target population was any person in the UK who owned or worked with cattle. between September and November 2011, participants were canvassed at events around the UK. the link to the online questionnaire was distributed by email to 13 veterinary practices. study was further increased through articles in farming and veterinary press. ten per cent of questionnaires were checked to detect data entry errors. no errors were observed. female 18 (40/220) 12 (13/108) 24 (22/92) Role on farm Senior (e.g., owner, herdsman, herd manager) 74 (164/222) 74 (84/113) 77 (68/88) Junior (e.g., worker) 26 (58/222) 26 (29/113) 23 (20/88) Farm size Small (81 adult cattle) 35 (77/219) 10 (11/114) 69 (59/86) Medium (81\u2013160 adult milk yield (litres/cow/year) range 4700 to 10,700 Mean (median) 7733 (8000) *Includes dairy, beef, mixed and unallocated respondents Data derived from open questions with responses grouped using thematic analysis methods HND, Higher National Diploma; NDA, National Diploma of Agriculture; Ordinary National Diploma. dairy, beef, mixed and unallocated respondents were more likely to have vaccinated their cattle in the past year than small farms (81 cows) the difference in vaccination uptake between small or large, versus average size farms was not significant in the 2 analysis. thirty-three per cent of respondents excluded certain animals from vaccination. 6% of respondents indicated that they excluded pregnant animals. a clostridial vaccine is not recommended for animals in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. recommended route 73 (128/175) 77 (69/90) 73 (49/67) If using an intramuscular or subcutaneous route, which injection site did you use\" Recommended route 69 (57/82) 67 (28/42) 70 (26/37) What instructions did you follow.
