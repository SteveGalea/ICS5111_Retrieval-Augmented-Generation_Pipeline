{"summary": "the GP64 superfamily includes the glycoprotein (GP) encoded by members of the Thogotovirus genus of the Orthomyxoviridae. the entry proteins of other baculoviruses, group II NPV and granuloviruses are class I penetrenes. the penetrenes of enveloped animal viruses can be divided into at least three classes. the penetrenes contain a \"fusion peptide,\" a cluster of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids. members of the Flaviviridae and the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae are class II penetrenes. es and a group of caenorhabditis elegans retroviruses are also class II penetrenes. the entry glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) contains a fusion domain comprised of sheets, other sheet domains, an extended -helical domain, a membrane proximal -helical stem domain and a carboxyl terminal anchor. baculoviruses encode two distinct penetrenes. entry proteins of group I NPV are all approximately 64 kilodalton glycoproteins. GV and baculoviruses encode entry proteins referred to as fusion proteins. the fourth largest RNA segment of THOV encodes a glycoprotein (GP) that has significant similarity with the class I penetrenes, hemagglutinin 2 (HA2) or hemagglutinin-esterase 2 (HE2). thogotovirus GP share significant sequence similarity with baculovirus GP64. we also compared GP64 superfamily members to penetrenes of representative members of the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, and Bunyaviridae. comparisons of F from ISAV strain RPC/NB 98-049-1 (ABE98322), F from Spodoptera exigua MNPV (AAF33539) and retrovirus-related Env polyprotein from transposon gypsy (P104 domains with significant propensity to form transmembrane helices were identified with TMpred. TMpred is based on a statistical analysis of TMbase, a database of naturally occurring transmembrane glycoproteins. virus structural G (P32595), nonstructural G (P32596), novirhabdovirus: lettuce necrosis yellows virus glycoprotein (LYP425091); nucleorhabdovirus: rice yellow stunt virus (AB011257) and rhabdovirus: Taastrup virus (AY423355). GP64 superfamily members to penetrenes of representative members of the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Togavirida TMpred was preferred method of secondary structure prediction. domains with significant propensity to form transmembrane helices were identified with TMpred. similar sequences and common structural/functional motifs are located collinearly. this strategy has proven to be highly predictive of structures solved later by X-ray crystallography [4,36]. this strategy can also be applied to discovery of potential structures of viral penetrenes that belong to class II [13,14]. -helical stem domain with several aromatic aa (indigo cones) in THOV GP (aa 442\u2013472) and AcMNPV GP64 (aa 441\u2013471) prior to transmembrane anchor. a common domain nomenclature for class III penetrenes is used. the fusion domains of class II and III penetrenes have a highly similar structure. a consistent nomenclature for these class III penetrenes was not used. the current class III penetrene numbering also combines two interacting domains into domain III. sequences with positive WWIHS have a high potential to interface with or disrupt lipid membranes. similar linear arrangement of putative domain structures of THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64. amino acids are numbered beginning after the putative signal sequences in VSV G, but at the beginning of the signal sequence of HSV-1 gB. black boxes represent hydrophobic regions, with violet representing the transmembrane anchor (TM) alignments between VSV G, THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 are proposed. these alignments support assignment of a common domain architecture for these proteins. the proposed alignments support assignment of a common domain architecture for these proteins. the predicted structures of THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 were fit to the post-fusion structure of VSV G [17]. secondary structures for THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 were predicted by PHD or by alignment to VSV G. OV GP and AcMNPV GP64 structural models are not intended as definitive structural predictions. the modeling does establish feasible structures that are consistent with the secondary structure predictions and with the assignment of GP64 superfamily members as class III penetrenes. the results of this structural modeling also provide further support for the proposed alignment of VSV G with THOV GP. ISAV F1 is shorter in overall length than HA2 of influenza A or B viruses or HE2 of influenza C viruses. other similarities include the presence of a conserved cluster of three cysteine residues (ISAV F aa 382\u2013390) and an aromatic pre-anchor domain (aa 414\u2013421) similar sequences are located collinearly in VSV G, THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 Gallaher and co-workers employed the fusion peptide and other conserved features. this strategy has proven to be highly predictive of structures solved later by X-ray crystallography. tools in THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 are the carboxyl terminal transmembrane anchor. TMpred assigns significant scores (> 500 is statistically significant) to THOV GP aa 471\u2013491 (score: 2428) and AcMNPV GP64 aa 470\u2013490 (3030) this suggests that these sequences represent the transmembrane anchors. -sheets (t) and (u) of VSV G are not present in the protein data base structure (2cmz.pdb). -helices predicted by PHD are indicated by dashed boxes and predicted -sheets are identified with dashed arrows. thOV GP (aa 44\u2013182) and AcMNPV GP64 (aa 49\u2013186) with 6 or 8 cysteine residues, plus 1 or 2 sequences with positive WWIHS scores. a prominent feature of class III penetrenes is an extended -helix beginning near the carboxyl terminal third of the ectodomain (domain III) the sequence of the predicted helices is consistent with that of a leucine zipper (mostly leucines or isoleucines in first and fourth positions of seven amino acid repeats) the -helices in the GP64 proteins are predicted to be several helical turns longer than the major helix (helix H) of the post-fusion structure of VSV G, but comparable in length to the major -helix of HSV-1 gB. THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 scaffolded on the structure of VSV G in the post-fusion configuration [17] were constructed. the alignments between VSV G, THOV GP and AcMNPV suggest that these penetrenes may have a similar structure. THOV GP, AcMNPV and other GP64 superfamily members have similarly located glycosylation sites on or between predicted -sheets corresponding to VSV G. thogotovirus penetrenes are structurally distinct from penetrenes encoded by viruses in the three other genus of the Orthomyxoviridae. isavirus F1 is shorter in overall length than HA2 of influenza A or B viruses or HE2 of influenza C viruses. other similarities include the presence of a conserved cluster of three cysteine residues and an aromatic pre-anchor domain. fusion peptide red, amino terminal helix orange, c-terminal helix (green), aromatic domain (indigo) fusion peptide red, amino terminal helix (N-helix) orange, c-terminal helix (green), aromatic domain (indigo). hydrophobic transmembrane domains (violet) thOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 appear in similar model locations to the two glycosylation sites of VSV G. the three penetrene classes for enveloped virus membrane glycoproteins were established based on structural similarities in the post-fusion configurations. GP64 superfamily members follow a mechanism of fusion similar to rhabdovirus gB. a mechanism involving rearrangement of functional domains has also been proposed. GP64 superfamily members join rhabdovirus G and herpeviruses gB as class III penetrenes. similar penetrenes are not present in all contemporary members of the Orthomyxoviridae. ISAV HE shares limited sequence similarities with more closely related HE of influenza C viruses, coronaviruses and toroviruses. distinct penetrenes, class I or III, appear to have been acquired independently by different orthomyxovirus genuses. it is unclear which, if any, was present prior to divergence of this family. similarities detected between GP64 superfamily members and rhabdovirus G are consistent with divergent evolution from a common progenitor. it is unlikely that there are any recent common ancesters of rhabdoviruses and baculoviruses, and that the class III penetrenes of these viruses were acquired by independent genetic events.
