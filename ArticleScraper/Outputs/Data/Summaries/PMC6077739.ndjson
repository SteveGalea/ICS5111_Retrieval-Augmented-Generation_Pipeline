{"summary": "a platform with 20 gfp-luxABCDE dual-reporter plasmids was constructed. only compounds that resulted in significantly low luminescence readings were selected for secondary screening. a total of 670 compounds that repressed 65% of hla promoter activity were selected for secondary screening. cleavage of peptide bond between leucine and tyrosine by ClpP results in increased fluorescence intensity. we chose 100-M substrate concentration for subsequent screening against 670 selected hla repressors. M21 was the only compound that had both ClpP inhibition effect and targeting multiple virulence factors at the same time. M21 inhibition on hemolysis of human erythrocyte caused by S. aureus. on leukotoxic effect of S. aureus against mouse macrophage cell line. a dose-dependent inhibition effect of M21 on hemolysis against human erythrocyte and a leukotoxic effect against mouse macrophage cell was observed. M21-treated S. aureus showed a significantly reduced ratio of adherence and internalization in A549 cells. concentrations of ClpP and Suc-LY-AMC used were 1 M and 100 M respectively. M21 increased the maximum velocity (Vmax) but did not affect the Michaelis constant (Km) of ClpP enzyme reactions. treatment with compound M21 inhibited such proteolytic activity. ClpP indirectly controls the production of -toxin and protein A and a number of other virulence factors under the control of agr. a grid box surrounding the entire crystal structure of ClpP predicted that M21 could fit into two pockets near H142 or Q35, respectively. a highest-affinity binding conformation of such docking around H142 is shown in Fig. 3A. surface representation of ClpP is labeled in cyan. the green color area is the binding pocket, and the cyan area is the active site. on the basis of potential binding sites predicted by our docking models, we made site-directed mutations along the predicted binding pocket. mutant lysates of Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) showed no activity on the cleavage of Suc-LY-AMC. mutant variants A118G and T146A retained nearly 20% of their enzymatic activity in the presence of the same amount of M21. the shift of denatured temperature of ClpP on treatment with M21 indicated the binding of M21 to the enzyme. the reduced heat sensitivity of mutants of A118G and T146A suggested that these amino acid residues should be involved in the binding of M21 on ClpP. a mouse bacteremia model used a mouse bacteremia model to assess S. aureus virulence. M21 showed little to no inhibitory effects on S. aureus growth in vitro. the group treated with compound M21 is indicated as \u2018\u2018M21\u2019. survival data were calculated by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. all data represent mean values SEM (*P 0.05; **P 0.01) a platform with 20 gfp-luxABCDE dual-reporter plasmids was constructed. only compounds that resulted in significantly low luminescence readings were selected for secondary screening. a total of 670 compounds that repressed 65% of hla promoter activity were selected for secondary screening. ClpP has been shown to degrade protein substrates such as SspB (26) and the fluorescent substrate Suc-LY-AMC. the successful cleavage of the peptide bond between leucine and tyrosine by ClpP results in increased fluorescence intensity. production of protein A and -toxin in the presence of M21 assayed by Western blot in USA300. M21 inhibition on hemolysis of human erythrocyte caused by S. aureus and on leukotoxic effect of S. aureus against mouse macrophage cell line. a dose-dependent inhibition effect of M21 on hemolysis against human erythrocyte and a leukotoxic effect against mouse macrophage cell was observed. a small modification of the acetic acid group of M21 to methoxyethyl led to little or no inhibition effect on the peptidase activity of ClpP. M21 inhibits ClpP cleavage of SUc-LY-AMC in a peptidase assay. concentrations of ClpP and Suc-LY-AMC used were 1 M and 100 M respectively. -casein was completely degraded by ClpP (4 M), whereas treatment with compound M21 inhibited such proteolytic activity. the deletion of ClpP in S. aureus led to strong induction of urease production. M21 showed no effect on -toxin production in this clpP variant. a grid box surrounding the entire crystal structure of ClpP predicted that M21 could fit into two pockets near H142 or Q35, respectively. the side chains of the predicted interacting amino acid residues that participate in the hydrophobic contacts with M21 are shown. the green color area is the binding pocket, and the cyan area is the active site. on the basis of the potential binding sites predicted by our docking models, we made site-directed mutations along the predicted binding pocket. mutant lysates of Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) expressing wild-type ClpP were used to evaluate variation in ClpP activity. negative control showed no activity on the cleavage of Suc-LY-AMC. mutants with retained activities were further evaluated for resistance to M21 inhibition. the temperature in degree Celsius of sample treatment indicated the binding of M21 to the enzyme. the reduced heat sensitivity of mutants of A118G and T146A suggested that these amino acid residues should be involved in the binding of M21 on ClpP. M21 showed little to no inhibitory effects on S. aureus growth in vitro. mice treated with two different M21 dosages had same level of bacteria recovered from the kidneys. the group treated with injection buffer is indicated as \u2018\u2018Vehicle\u2019\u2019. survival data were calculated by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. all data represent mean values SEM (*P 0.05; **P 0.01) the virulence of S. aureus arises from the combination of surface-associated virulence factors, exotoxins, enterotoxins, and superantigens (1). if nonantibiotic compounds can be identified to repress all or most important virulence factors in S. aureus, these compounds may actualize a paradigm in the treatment of staphylococcal diseases by abolishing the expression of bacterial virulence. we used a chemical library with 50,240 small-molecule compounds for HTS. we selected 670 primary hits for secondary screening. the hit rate during primary screening was 1.9%, similar to previous studies. xin in complex with RNAIII is a substrate of serine protease sspA under the control of Clp-dependent degradation (39). these reports suggest that Clp chaperones and proteases are central in regulating the virulence of S. aureus. M21 affects ClpP activity by noncompetitive inhibition. the binding pocket of M21 on ClpP is located beside the -helix (amino acids 135\u2013147) and the -sheet (amino acids 170\u2013177) of the adjacent monomer. of particular interest is receptor flexibility, which is essential to capturing the protein conformational changes on ligand binding. reverse chemical genetics used the selected pool of 670 biologically active compounds to identify inhibitors of a known virulence regulator (ClpP) through this strategy, we have minimized the disadvantages of both methods and shown that M21 specifically targets ClpP to suppress S. aureus virulence. Detailed procedures are available in SI Appendix, SI Experimental Procedures. Strain USA300-pGLhla was used in high-throughput screening to identify repressors of hla promoter activity (SI Appendix, Table S2)."}
