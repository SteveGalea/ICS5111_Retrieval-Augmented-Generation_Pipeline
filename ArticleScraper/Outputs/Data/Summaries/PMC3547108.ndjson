{"summary": "organic dust extract from swine confinement facilities induces an influx of activated CD11c+/CD11b+ macrophages in the lung. this information may be important because potential therapies such as macrolides and vitamin D were shown to enhance macrophage phagocytic ability. the total cell number of pooled lavages (3 1 ml lavages) was enumerated. differential cell counts were determined on cytospin-prepared slides. slides were semiquantitatively assessed using a previously described lung inflammatory scoring system. details are provided in the online supplement. Statistical methods Data are presented as means SEM. deplete lung macrophages selectively (17, 18, 28) liposomes (30 l) were administered 48 hours before the first DE treatment. the total cell number of pooled lavages (3 1 ml lavages) was enumerated. differential cell counts were determined on cytospin-prepared slides. phagocytic capacity of lung-associated CD11c+ cells was assessed by flow cytometry, modified from methods described previously (10, 13) and in the online supplement. results represent total lung cells and absolute CD11c+ cells. mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of surface marker expression on gated CD11c+ cells is shown. a significant increase was evident in phagocytic ability of lung CD11c+ macrophages after repetitive DE challenge. the phagocytic ability of gated CD11c+ lung macrophages is shown as fold change in mean MFI (SEM) of the proportion of cells in the zymosan-exposed gated population at 60 minutes compared with cells exposed for 0 minutes from DE and saline control mice. results represent the mean SEM (n = 6\u20139 mice/group), with statistical significance between saline-and DE-treated denoted by asterisks. ive PGN exposure resulted in increased costimulatory molecule expression (CD80 and CD86) and increased adhesion molecule CD11b expression in CD11c+ cells. however, repetitive PGN treatment significantly augmented MHC Class II expression in CD11c+ cells. phagocytic ability of lung CD11c+ cells from PGN-challenged mice was also significantly enhanced compared with saline-treated mice. clodronate liposomes (CL-LIP) and saline liposomes (SL-LIP) were administered 2 days before a one-time (acute) exposure to DE or saline control. mice were killed 5 hours after DE exposure. a representative 4- to 5-m-thick section from each group is shown at 40 magnification. asterisks (*P 0.05 and *P 0.01) indicate statistical significance between SL-LIP\u2013treated and CL-LIP DE\u2013treated mice. IL-6 concentrations in CL-LIP + DE\u2013treated animals were evident, compared with SL-LIP + DE\u2013treated animals. macrophages play a selective role in regulating acute (single exposure) DE-induced airway inflammatory responses. the administration of CL-LIP throughout the duration of repetitive DE exposure treatment resulted in increased neutrophil numbers recovered from BALF. repetitive exposure, BALF cytokines and chemokines were at the lower limit of assay detection, consistent with the chronic inflammatory adaptation response (6, 7), and concentrations were not different between SL-LIP + DE and CL-LIP + DE. results represent means SEM (n = 4 mice/group) of total cells and cell differentials recovered from the BALF of mice. significant increases were observed in the inflammatory scores for all parameters assessed in the CL-LIP + DE treatment group compared with the SL-LIP + DE treatment group. the study shows that lung macrophages play a key role in controlling repetitive DE-induced lung inflammation. the expression of costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) and of the adhesion molecule CD11b was significantly up-regulated in lung-associated CD11c+ cells after DE challenge, compared with saline-treated control samples. no change was observed in MHC Class II expression. repetitive intranasal inhalation challenge with DE evokes a significant influx of CD11c+ lung cells. de-treated mice were repetitively exposed to DE or saline for 3 weeks. lung-associated cells were exposed ex vivo to FITC-labeled Saccharomyces cerevisiae zymosan-A bioparticles. intranasal challenge with peptidoglycan (PGN) increases activated CD11c+/CD11b+ macrophages. repetitive PGN treatment results in significant influx of CD11c+ lung cells. results represent means SEM (n = 6 mice/group) of total lung cells and CD11c+ lung macrophages. results represent fold changes in MFI (proportion of cells in the gated population at 60 min, compared with cells exposed for 0 min) C57BL/6 mice were treated with clodronate liposomes (CL-LIP) and saline liposomes (SL-LIP) and exposed to saline or DE 48 hours later. a representative 4- to 5-m-thick section from each group is shown at 40 magnification. cytokine/chemokine concentrations quantitated in cell-free BALF. asterisks (*P 0.05 and *P 0.01) indicate statistical significance between respective saline-treated and DE-treated groups. Macrophage reduction also produced changes in acute DE-induced airway inflammation. CL-LIP + DE mice were treated with clodronate liposomes (CL-LIP) or saline liposomes (SL-LIP) beginning 2 days before the first DE challenge, and then every 3 to 4 days during the daily 3-week repetitive DE or saline exposure. the percentage and numbers of lung neutrophils from whole-lung tissue were significantly increased in animals treated with CL-LIP + DE, compared with SL-LIP + DE. asterisks (*P 0.05, *P 0.01, and ***P 0.001) indicate statistical differences between SL-LIP + DE-treated and CL-LIP + DE-treated mice. the histological examination of lung tissue demonstrated striking differences in lung parenchymal inflammation between the CL-LIP + DE and SL-LIP + DE treatment groups. a 5-m-thick, hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained section of one of four mice per treatment group is shown at 10 magnification. asterisks (*P 0.05, *P 0.01, and ***P 0.001) indicate statistical difference between SL-LIP + DE\u2013treated and CL-LIP + DE\u2013treated mice. repetitive exposure to organic DE elicited the influx of activated lung CD11c+/CD11 alveolar macrophages are key innate immune cells that are rapidly activated and orchestrate immune responses after exposure to inhaled toxins. macrophages can produce inflammatory mediators and resolve chronic inflammatory responses by clearing bacteria, debris, and apoptotic cells. Activated CD11c+ lung macrophages are a common feature of inflammatory responses after exposure to various viral or bacterial pathogens. a hyperresponsiveness in cytokine release with ex vivo, endotoxin-stimulated whole blood from farmers compared with healthy control subjects has been reported. the finding that CD11b expression was dramatically increased in DE-exposed CD11c+ cells is also important. this possibility is supported by our demonstration that without an adequate lung macrophage population, enhanced inflammatory consequences follow repetitive DE exposure. the macrophage does not appear to be an important source of neutrophil chemoattractants during DE-induced airway inflammation. this implies that other cell types, such as airway epithelium, may be important sources of DE-induced neutrophil chemoattractants. cytokine/chemokine response diminished and did not differ between groups. mice receiving repetitive clodronate liposome treatment failed to exhibit equivalent weight gain compared with control mice. repeated clodronate liposome treatment (i.e., 2\u20133 repeated challenges) was reported to cause subtle immunologic changes. supplementary material Disclosures supp_47_5_652__index.html (727B, html)"}
