{"summary": "in 2009, two cohort studies were initiated: FLU 002 in outpatients and FLU 003 in hospitalized patients. disease progression was defined as hospitalization and/or death for outpatients, and transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) if enrolled from general ward. the emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009 highlighted the importance of having infrastructures in place to conduct research that would inform patient management on emerging viruses. follow-up studies of patients diagnosed with influenza are necessary to estimate the percentage that progress to death or respiratory failure. one study (FLU 002) enrolled patients seeking assessment for influenza-like illness (ILI) as outpatients; a second study (FLU 003) enrolled patients who had been hospitalized for complications associated with influenza. both studies were designed to cover a broad clinical spectrum of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in adults (18 years of age) for patients enrolled from a general ward or ICU, this composite outcome is referred to as \u201cdisease progression\u201d at 14 days the resolution of symptoms was also assessed. for general ward patients, outcomes assessed included death, ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation. the FLU 003 hospitalized cohort includes patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus confirmed at a central laboratory and patients who tested positive for influenza A by a local laboratory. the results of local RT-PCR testing did not record the influenza A subtype (see appendix S2). logistic regression was used to study baseline predictors of disease progression and mortality. unadjusted and adjusted ORs are cited along with 95% CIs and p-values. in expanded models, an interaction term (covariate x study) was included in the logistic model. 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. 0.05 were considered statistical significance. 0.05 were considered statistical significance. a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was performed using specific primers and probes for detection of influenza A, (seasonal H1, H1N1pdm09, H3), and B viruses. local RT-PCR test results were only recorded as influenza A positive or negative; after the first year, influenza A subtyping results were recorded. cross-sectional comparisons were performed to assess factors potentially contributing to disease severity. unadjusted and adjusted ORs are cited along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are cited. the imputation was done in an iterative manner using the baseline covariate data available. the regression coefficients from five rounds of imputation were used to obtain the ORs. the imputation had little effect on the univariable analyses, therefore summary statistics from these analyses are based on the observed data. all patients 30 (24, 42) Oct 2009-Sep 2010 enrollment 29 (23, 39) Oct 2010-Dec 2012 enrollment 35 (28, 47) Gender Female - no.
