{"summary": "gene therapy is the experimental use of genetic manipulation techniques to correct errors associated with genetic diseases or to modify undesirable Deoxyribonucleic acid sequences. there is a general agreement on few main issues to be thoroughly addressed before commencing a clinical trial for a novel gene therapy. gene therapy approaches to corneal pathological disorders are being studied extensively. acyclovir and corticosteroids are normally prescribed either alone or in combination for common HSV keratitis. the treatment of recurrent epithelial keratitis includes cycloplegia as well as antiviral eye drops such as trifluridine. the icosadeltahedral capsid is composed of 162 capsomers. the virion is surrounded by an amorphous structure containing various proteins and enzymes. the tegument surrounding the capsid contributes to the virulence of the virus. the icosahedral, DNA-containing capsid is asymmetrically located within the virion and surrounded by an amorphous protein layer called the tegument. there are two different origins of replication, oriL in the long segment and oriS in the short segment. laboratory methods performed by a specialized virologist are highly recommended [19]. the commonly used methods include direct fluorescence antibody test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cell culture using Vero cell line. however, direct fluorescence antibody test was reported to have superior sensitivity than the cell culture method. antiviral and corticosteroids drugs only alleviate symptoms and shorten infection period. but long-term administration of Acyclovir can help decrease the recurrence of the infection. gene therapy has the advantages of prolonged therapeutic effect, tissue-type specificity, transcriptional control via specific regulatory elements. the icosadeltahedral capsid is composed of 162 capsomers. the virion is surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope, acquired from the host, with 12 embedded glycoproteins. these glycoproteins function as attachment, fusion, structural and anti-immune proteins. the icosahedral, DNA-containing capsid is asymmetrically located within the virion and is surrounded by an amorphous protein layer called the tegument. there are two different origins of replication, oriL in the long segment and oriS in the short segment. direct fluorescence antibody test was reported to have superior sensitivity than PCR. PCR and fluorescence antibody test had similar sensitivity and negative predictive figures. corticosteroids are used to improve clinical signs due to its anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenesis effects. gene therapy has the advantages of prolonged therapeutic effect, tissue-type specificity, transcriptional control via specific regulatory elements. complex anti-viral defence mechanisms based on innate and adaptive immunity activates immune recruitment mechanisms. no record exists for clinical trials on herpetic keratitis gene therapy. four classes of viruses are reportedly used in ocular gene therapy. adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, and lentivirus vectors were limited. the incorporation of a laminin derived peptide to a polymer modified adenovirus can improve its cell-type targeting specificity. adeno/HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or adeno/AAV (adeno-associated virus) hybrids have been developed. rAAV genome is packaged in a capsid of another AAV serotype. the results of this mix and match process will not be reviewed here. new comparative studies between different AAV serotypes for the transduction of human corneas (ex vivo) using intra-stromal injection were recently described. retroviral vectors recommended for transducing the cornea are based on different lentiviruses like HIV, equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). retroviral vectors are well known to integrate their genome into the host to achieve stable transgene expression. plasmid encoding interferon alpha 1 (IFN-1) was effective against ocular HSV-1 neovascularisation in a time and dose dependent manner. plasmid encoding interleukin 18 (IL-18) reduced angiogenesis and immunoinflammatory lesions resulting from HSV-1 infection of mice. polylactic coglycolic acid nanoparticles were shown to be efficient, nontoxic, and sustainable form for gene therapy, progressively reducing murine poration method employs high field strength, square-wave electric pulses to allow the penetration of therapeutics molecules. electroporation can cause severe cell damage and induce immunogenic reactions. ultrasound can enhance gene transfer to mammalian corneal cells in vitro and in vivo without cell damage. liposomes containing plasmid DNA and coated with antibodies will form an immuno-specific vector to target specific receptors of a given cell type. liposomes and transferrin (targeted to endocytic transferrin receptor) have been used successfully to modulate corneal allograft rejection with a therapeutic transgene. herpetic keratitis chronic inflammation causes edema, neovascularisation and scarring. 5\u201310% of cornea transplantation operations are performed to replace HSV-1 damaged corneas. gD Rabbits Intradermal injection No effect on herpes simplex keratitis during 16 days postinfection [99] 1997 Plasmid DNA IL-10, IL-2, GM-CSF Mice Topical or intramuscular Topical: IL-10, only, reduced lesion

Subepithelial injection Reduction of herpes simplex keratitis signs 14 days after infection [115] 2004 Plasmid DNA gB, gC, gD, gE and gI Mice Intraperitoneal injection Complete survival and prevention of corneal scarring 28 days after infection [116] siRNA duplexes with or without TargeTran VEGF. gene therapy Targeting the HSV-1 Genome DNA damage response is a mechanism by which cells can correct damage or eliminate severely damaged cells by activating programmed cell death mechanisms. the DNA repair mechanisms include direct repair, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, double-strand break repair. ribozymes are RNA molecules with intrinsic enzymatic activity to promote a variety of reactions without the aid of protein cofactor. they have been shown to be active against HIV-1 [132] and HSV-1 [126, 133], where it improved the survival rate in mice. antisense oligodeoxynucleotides are short synthetic DNA consisting of 15 to 20 nucleotides. antisense oligonucleotides are modified to include a phosphorodiamidate linkage and morpholine ring. morpholinos function by translational arrest. targeting neovascularisation resulting from herpetic keratitis. homonucleases are a group of restriction enzymes encoded by introns and inteins. their recognition sites are rare, but custom made endonucleases can be made targeting specific viral sequences for gene therapy. a number of replications have been proposed as promising targets for antiviral drug discovery. thymidine kinase UL23, ribonucleotide reductase UL39, 40, deoxyuridine diphosphatase UL50, uracil-DNA glycosylase (UL2), and alkaline nuclease (UL12) other strategies include inhibition of DNA polymerase by specific peptides or small molecules. interruption of a few hydrogen bonds between subunits UL30 (Pol) and UL the interest in the recent years was directed to the viral genome itself. however, the interest in the recent years was directed to the viral genome itself. Plasmid DNA IFN-1 Mice Topical Increased survival only when applied 12 hours before infection [107] 2001 Plasmid DNA gB Mice Topical Increased survival only when applied 12 hours before infection [107] 2001 Plasmid DNA gB Mice Mucosal Increased INF- [109] 2002 Plasmid DNA gD-IL-2 Mice Subconjunctival injection Complete prevention of stromal, but not epithelial, keratitis 10 days after gene therapy Targeting the HSV-1 Genome DNA damage response is a mechanism by which cells can correct damage or eliminate severely damaged cells by activating programmed cell death mechanisms. severe injuries can cause the cell to undergo apoptosis. ribozymes are RNA molecules with intrinsic enzymatic activity to promote a variety of reactions without the aid of protein cofactor. antisense oligodeoxynucleotides are short synthetic DNA consisting of 15 to 20 nucleotides. they inhibit protein biosynthesis by targeting the complementary stretches of RNA. topical treatment was found to reduce TNF- in cultured lymphocytes and in vivo in mice. but the topical TNF- blockade may interfere with the antiviral response, ultimately leading to recurrent herpetic keratitis. in vitro plaque test, HSV-1 replication was also inhibited by siRNAs against the UL39 gene encoding the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, ICP6. aptamers \u2014 Oligonucleotide sequences with the capacity to recognize specific target molecules with high affinity and specificity, referred to as \u201captamers\u201d. thymidine kinase UL23, ribonucleotide reductase UL39, 40, deoxyuridine diphosphatase UL50, uracil-DNA glycosylase (UL2), and alkaline nuclease (UL12) potential in treatment of many genetic diseases and viral infections is increasing attention and awareness towards this new era of highly specialized treatment. corneal HSV-1 gene therapy can reduce transplant rejection due to chronic herpetic keratitis and minimise the risk of in vivo gene therapy. pretreatment of corneas ex vivo in eye banks with specialised areas is a new practical approach to corneal HSV-1 gene therapy."}
