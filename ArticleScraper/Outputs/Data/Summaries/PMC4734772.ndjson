{"summary": "virulence of two clinical isolates of SAFV type 3 (SAFV-3) was analyzed in neonatal and young mice. both clinical isolates were infective, exhibited neurotropism, and were mildly neurovirulent in neonatal ddY mice. UR infection resulted in longer inflammation in the brain and spinal cord because of demyelination. the zoonotic Encephalomyocarditis virus is infectious in primates, including humans, but causes only occasional and mild outbreaks [7\u201312] after its initial identification, SAFV was primarily detected in fecal and throat swab specimens from infants and children with acute gastroenteritis. the pathogenicity of SAFV remains unclear because the virus is often detected along with enteric or respiratory viruses such as norovirus, rotavirus, boc enterovirus 71, a member of the family Picornaviridae, can cause meningitis and encephalitis because it infects human neurons. coxsackieviruses A and B preferentially infect neonatal mice rather than adult mice. establishing a mouse model of SAFV infection would advance understanding of the neuropathogenesis of SAFV. ddY mice and young BALB/c mice were infected and analyzed using virological, pathological, and immunological methods. the results showed that both clinical isolates of SAFV-3 infected neural progenitor cells and glial cells, but not large neurons. the clinical isolates showed different cell tropism and neurovirulence. the virus-infected LLC-MK2 cells were disrupted using three freeze-thaw cycles. the supernatant was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 15 min. the stock viruses were expressed as 50% of the cell culture infectious dose (CCID50)/ml in LLC-MK2 cells. neonatal ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally or intraperitoneally with the AM or UR strains. 2MEM was used as a negative control and as the diluent whenever needed. mice were observed for clinical manifestations, and their body weight was measured daily for 21 days. animals were deprived of water for 6 or more hours before oral inoculation. animals were sacrificed under excess isoflurane anesthesia. animals were euthanized under anesthesia if severe disease symptoms or weight loss was observed. the whole head, including the brain, was immersed in a formalin solution overnight. the whole head, including the spine including the spinal cord, muscle, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, stomach, and intestine were harvested and immersed in a formalin solution for 2 or 3 days. clonal antibody or anti Iba1 polyclonal antibody was used alongside serum from a rabbit hyper-immunized with the SAFV-3 AM strain [36] after further washing in PBS, sections were incubated with Nichirei-Histofine Simple Stain Mouse MAX PO (R) anti-cytokeratin (clone AE3; Chemicon, Merck Millipore), and lectin biotinylated GRIFFONIA SIMPLICIFOLIA (GS-lectin) were retrieved by autoclaving the sections in retrieval solution (pH 6.0) at 121\u00b0C for 10 min. the sections were incubated with the primary monoclonal antibody (against Musashi-1, GFAP, GLAST, BL QuantiGene ViewRNA Probes Sets were designed using the whole gene for the SAFV-3 AM strain. RNA was extracted using a PureLink FFPE RNA Isolation Kit. reagents were provided in the TURBO DNA-free Kit. neonatal mice were removed from the skull, washed three times in PBS, and separated into two parts. the brains from young mice were divided into three parts (the cerebrum, brain stem, and cerebellum) to quantify the viral RNA genome. second-round of PCR was conducted for 3 min at 95\u00b0C. followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. nested reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. tab Primer Express software was used to design primers and probes for real-time RT-PCR. all of which recognized the SAFV-3 viral protein 1 (VP1) region was examined using real-time RT-PCR methods. mouse beta-actin mRNA was also quantified. the clinical samples were obtained by the local health authorities of Kochi Prefecture (AM strain) or Gunma prefecture (UR strain) in 2008. we used clinical isolates that were supplied from these local health authorities. this study does not need the approval of the Ethical Review Board. RNA was extracted from virus-infected cell cultures using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. RT-PCR was performed with the oneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) using specific primers. nucleotide sequences of the UR strain were analyzed using Sequencher software. mice were sacrificed under excess isoflurane anesthesia. body weight changes were measured for 8 (ddY) or 60 (BALB/c) days. mice were sacrificed under excess isoflurane anesthesia. animal experiments were conducted in strict compliance with animal husbandry and welfare regulations. all animals were handled in biosafety level two animal facilities. animals were euthanized under anesthesia if severe disease symptoms were observed. deparaffinized sections were placed in a retrieval solution (pH 6) for antigen retrieval. sections were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min. after further washing, sections were incubated at room temperature in 10% normal goat serum. infected cells, paraffin-embedded tissues were subjected to a double immunofluorescence staining procedure using a rabbit antiserum against SAFV-3. anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (clone GA5; Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) (clone AT1D1; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), microtubule anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (to detect viral antigen-binding sites), goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 (to detect antibodies bound to Musashi-1), goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (to detect antibodies bound to GFAP, GLAST, BLBP, MAP-2, CNPase, MAG, or cytokeratin) were used as secondary antibodies (all secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes, Life Technologies Corporation) d to real-time PCR to detect SAFV-3, and appropriate samples were selected for RNA in situ hybridization. sections were incubated with the QuantiGene ViewRNA Probe Set at 40\u00b0C for 2 h and then treated with protease QF at 40\u00b0C for 10 min. sections were stained using a Warp Red Chromogen Kit (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) total RNA was extracted from the supernatants of tissue homogenates. RNA was removed from the extracted RNA using a TURBO DNA-free kit. the product was amplified using oneStep RT-PCR (Qiagen) and TaKaRa Ex Taq (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) kits.

UR-inoculated mice showed greater expression of IFN- than AM-inoculated mice (*P 0.05 and ***P 0.001; one-way ANOVA) the UR-inoculated mouse brain contained a higher number of viral antigen-positive cells than the AM-inoculated mice. the viral antigen-positive cells were determined morphologically to be glial cells, ependymal cells, skeletal muscle cells, or epithelial cells. both SAFV-3 isolates showed neurotropism following intraperitoneal inoculation into neonatal mice. the young UR-inoculated ddY mice gained significantly less body weight than the 2MEM-inoculated mice. no difference in body weight between AM- and UR-inoculated mice. mice in both groups regained the lost weight during the observation period. the degenerated and necrotic nerve cells in the brains were positive for viral antigens. all of the AM- and UR-inoculated mice showed signs of meningitis. body weight of mice inoculated with either of the two SAFV-3 strains decreased during the early phase of infection. on day 3 post-inoculation, brains were obtained from young BALB/c mice. the expression of IFN 4 and mRNA in the cerebrum of UR-inoculated mice was higher than that in AM-inoculated mice on Day 3 p.i.. the expression of IFN 4 and mRNA in the cerebellum of AM-inoculated mice was significantly higher than that in the cerebellum of UR-inoculated mice. BALB/c mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 104 CCID50 (cell culture infectious dose) of the aseptic meningitis (AM) and upper respiratory (UR) strains of SAFV-3. no difference in the number of viral RNA copies between the AM- and UR-inoculated groups. neither AM- nor UR-inoculated mice had viral antigen-positive cells in the brain. one of the six brains from AM-inoculated mice was positive. three of six brains from UR-inoculated mice were positive in second round PCR. shaped cells were observed in the cortex and meninges of AM-inoculated, but not UR-inoculated mice (lower panels) the results indicated that SAFV-3 was only mildly neurovirulent in young ddY and BALB/c mice when inoculated intracerebrally. both strains showed low infectivity and neurotropism in the brain of these young mice. no histopathological changes or viral antigens were observed in the major organs after oral or intranasal inoculation with either virus strain. on day 3 post-intravenous inoculation of UR, viral antigens were detected in the pancreas of all three AM-inoculated mice and one of the three UR-inoculated mice. sera were obtained from mice inoculated intracerebrally (ic), intraperitoneally (ip), intravenously (iv), orally (po), orally (po) or intranasally (in) with the aseptic meningitis (AM) or upper respiratory (UR) strains of SAFV-3 (n = 4 or 6 mice per group) both strains induced an aseptic meningitis (AM) or UR strain. both the neonatal and young mouse models will be useful for future studies aimed at elucidating the pathogenesis of different SAFV-3 strains. the study highlights similarities and differences between the two SAFV-3 strains. no study has reported a similar tropism for TMEV. the pathological process of demyelination may be different between SAFV and TMEV. the UR strain infected young mice via the mucosal route. EV plays an important role in viral replication by inhibiting alpha/beta interferon production [61, 62] and inducing apoptosis [63, 64]. in the present study, the AM and UR strains differed in terms of virus replication and induction of type 1 IFN expression in infected mice. highly neurotropic viruses infect the CNS and cause viral meningitis or encephalomyelitis. the preferential target of these neurotropic viruses is the large pyramidal neurons in the human CNS. this tropism of SAFV-3 could reflect the neuropathogenesis observed in the brains of these mice. neonatal ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 104 CCID50 (cell culture infectious dose) of the aseptic meningitis (AM) and upper respiratory (UR) strains of SAFV-3. inflammatory infiltration in the brains of neonatal mice on days 3 and 21 post-inoculation (p.i.) the viral antigen-positive cells were seen in the cardiac muscle cells in both AM- and UR-inoculated mice. within 24 h of birth, neonatal ddY mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with 104 CCID50 (cell culture infectious dose) of the aseptic meningitis and upper respiratory strains of SAFV-3. perivascular cuffing and mononuclear cell infiltration were observed in the brain stem and cerebellum of UR-inoculated mice. on day 21 p.i., perivascular cuffing and mononuclear cell infiltration were observed in the brain stem and cerebellum of UR-inoculated mice. young ddY mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 104 CCID50 (cell culture infectious dose) of the aseptic meningitis (AM) and upper respiratory (UR) strains of SAFV-3. nerve cells were degenerated (arrows) with mild inflammatory infiltration (asterisk), and the cerebral medulla was positive for viral antigens. in both of the AM- and UR-inoculated mice, Musashi-1+ progenitor neural cells, and GFAP+ or GLAST+ glial fibers within the cerebral medulla were positive for viral antigen.
