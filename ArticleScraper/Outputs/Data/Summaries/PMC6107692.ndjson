{"summary": "rabies virus (RV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) are the items that must be tested. a rapid and sensitive multiplex pathogens detection technology is needed to meet the detection requirement of monitoring the animal health status and the sanitary of their living environment. the Luminex xTAG assay was designed for multiple nucleic acid detection in a single reaction. magnetic microspheres pre-coupled with anti-MagPlex-TAG oligo-nucleotides capture the matching oligo-nucleotide presented on the 5\u2032 end of PCR amplicons. a Luminex fluorescence reader is then used for analytical measurements of bead types. all viruses, nucleic acids and vaccines were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. clinical samples were obtained from the local veterinary clinic in Guangzhou, China. multiplex amplification was performed using a one-step RT-PCR assay kit. amplification steps were 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min and 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. ivity testing was carried out using PCR products from CDV, CPV, CAV, RV, and CPIV amplification that were cloned into the pGEM T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, United States) CDV, RV, and CPIV were in vitro transcribed using the RiboMAX Large Scale RNA production kit. TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) Viruses and Vaccines Canine distemper virus and CPV were preserved by our laboratory. rabies vaccine and polyvalent vaccine against CDV, CPV, CPIV, and CAV-1 were preserved by our laboratory. clinical samples were obtained from the local veterinary clinic in Guangzhou, China. DNA and RNA were extracted using a commercial automatic nucleic acid extraction instrument (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) multiplex amplification was performed using a one-step RT-PCR assay kit. the amplification steps were 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min and 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s and a final step of 10 min at 72\u00b0C. CDV, RV, and CPIV were in vitro transcribed using the pGEM T easy vector. TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) was used for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the cutoff value of each bead set was defined as the net MFI value of negative controls +3 SD as previously defined. the results showed that, all primers pairs were found to detect their specific viral target with no amplification of non-target samples. the 5-plex Luminex xTAG assay showed high specificity. the limit of detection was defined as the highest dilution that resulted in an MFI value above the cutoff value. the detection limit for each of the five viruses was about 100 copies/L. the positive rates for CDV, CPV, CAV, and CPIV were 8% (6/75), 50.7% (38/75), 2.7% (2/75), and 4% (3/75) no sample tested positive for RV and no mixed infections were identified. the xTAG assay was more sensitive than the colloidal gold test strip. three samples were found triple infection and four samples were found double infection. the new developed multiplex xTAG assay had the ability to identify different targets in co-infection samples. the xTAG technology was used to develop high throughput assays for the rapid and sensitive simultaneous detection of these viruses. a 5-plex Luminex xTAG assay for the simultaneous detection of CDV, CPV, CPIV, and RV in a single reaction was developed and validated. this is the first report of a Luminex xTAG assay for use in canine pathogen identification. the assay will be useful for animal health status and their living house monitoring. additional targets can be integrated into the existing multiplex platform."}
