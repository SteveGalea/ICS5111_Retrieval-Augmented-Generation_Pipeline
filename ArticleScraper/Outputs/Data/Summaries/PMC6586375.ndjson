{"summary": "bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening infection of the central nervous system. it is marked by transit of the bacterium across endothelial barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the meningeal blood-cerebral spinal fluid barrier (mBCSFB) a number of surface-associated factors have been described. a direct interaction between a GBS adhesin and an endothelial cell receptor has not been described. antigen I/II family (AgI/II) proteins are multifunctional adhesins. these proteins mediate attachment of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus gordonii. silico analysis has revealed four gene homologs in GBS. the proteins depicted are the antigen I/II proteins AspA from S. pyogenes strain M28. previous work has shown that BspA and BspB share 90% sequence identity. other GBS strains contain the homolog BspC, or in some cases BspD, which is over 99% identical to BspC. we found that BspC and vimentin contribute to the development of GBS meningitis in a mouse infection model. we found that BspC stimulates inflammatory signaling from brain endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. this immune signaling involves the NF-B pathway. we performed precise in-frame allelic replacement to generate a bspC mutant in GBS strain COH1. we further determined the expression of surface BspC in the WT. bspC mutant grew similarly to the WT parental strain. the bspCpDC.bspC complemented strain to hCMEC was assessed after a 30 min incubation. the bspC mutant exhibited a significant decrease in adherence to hCMEC compared to the bspC mutant strain. we heterologously expressed the GBS bspC gene in the non-adherent, non-pathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis. BspC expression resulted in significant increase in L. lactis adherence to hCMEC compared to L. lactis containing the control vector. bspC mutant strain from mouse blood and lung compared to WT. however, we observed a significant decrease in the amounts of the bspC mutant recovered from the brain tissue. we constructed bspC gene deletions in two other GBS strains. ELISA was performed on mouse brain tissue homogenates to assess cytokine protein levels. KC (G) and IL-1 (H) were quantified for brains from mice challenged with either WT GBS or the bspC mutant. mice challenged with WT GBS had significantly more of the neutrophil chemokine, KC, as well as the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1, in brain homogenates than bspC mutant infected animals. after four hours of infection, we collected cells and isolated RNA for RT-qPCR analysis to quantify IL-8 and CXCL-1 transcripts. RT-qPCR to assess IL-8 (A) and CXCL-1 (B) transcript levels in hCMEC treated with purified BspC protein or the S. gordonii CshA protein. ELISA to measure IL-8 (E) and CXCL-1 (F) secretion by hCMEC treated with BspC or the bspC mutant. nuclear factor-B (NF-B) represents a family of inducible transcription factors. it regulates a large array of genes involved in different processes of the immune and inflammatory responses. cells infected with WT GBS had significantly higher luciferase activity than uninfected and bspC mutant GBS infected cells. peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. the spectra from the spot yielded 158 peptide sequences. the molecular weight, 53.6 kDa, and calculated pI, 5.12, of vimentin. bacterial two-hybrid assay using E. coli containing empty vector controls (D), the BspC and vimentin vectors (E) and the positive control vectors (F) -galactosidase activity of E. coli was quantified using a Miller assay. blue colonies were grown on LB agar plates containing X-gal. blue colonies showed -galactosidase activity compared to empty vector control. a leucine zipper that is fused to the T25 and T18 fragments served as the positive control. hCMEC infected with either WT GBS (E-F) or the bspC mutant (G-H) cells were fixed but not permeabilized to label only extracellular bacteria and surface expressed vimentin. hCMEC were washed to remove nonadherent bacteria then fixed and labelled with antibodies to vimentin and GBS. hek293T pLenti-mock cells do not express vimentin. bspC mutant showed no difference in attachment to either cell line. hek293T pLenti-mock cells do not express vimentin. vimentin reacts with the C-terminal of vimentin (AA405-466), reduced WT GBS adherence to levels comparable to the adherence of the bspC mutant. these results indicate that the interaction between BspC and cell-surface vimentin is dependent on the C-terminus of vimentin. vimentin KO mice infected with bspC mutant GBS showed no difference in survival and tissue bacterial counts. vimentin contributes to initiation of immune signaling pathways during GBS infection. strain BspC contains all six domains characteristic of the AgI/II protein family. the proposed domain organization of streptococcal AgI/II polypeptides comprises a stalk consisting of the -helical A (alanine-rich repeats) domain and the polyproline II (PPII) helical P domain. the structure of several regions of the GBS homolog, BspA, has been solved. growth curve analysis showed that the bspC mutant grew similarly to the WT parental strain under the conditions used here. high-magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of COH1 strains showed that the bspC deletion strain exhibit decreased interaction between neighboring cells. lactococcus lactis containing the pMSP empty vector or pMSP.bspC to hCMEC were quantified. bspC promotes bacterial adherence to endothelial cells in vitro. mice were challenged with either WT GBS or the bspC mutant. by 48 hours, 80% of mice infected with the bspC mutant had succumbed to death. 80% of mice infected with the bspC mutant survived. bspC mutant in the 515 GBS background showed decreased bacterial loads in the brain compared to the isogenic parental WT strains. mice were euthanized 72 h after infection with 108 CFU of either WT GBS or the bspC mutant. we performed histological analysis of brains from infected animals. we observed leukocyte infiltration and meningeal thickening characteristic of meningitis that was absent in the infected mice. kine, IL-1, is necessary and sufficient to induce neutrophil chemokine signaling. we infected hCMEC with the bspC mutant or the complemented strain. RT-qPCR analysis quantifying IL-8 (C) and CXCL-1 (D) transcripts in hCMEC treated with purified BspC protein or the S. gordonii CshA protein. ELISA to measure IL-8 (E) and CXCL-1 (F) secretion by hCMEC treated with BspC or CshA. cells infected with WT GBS had significantly higher luciferase activity than uninfected and bspC mutant GBS infected cells. hCMEC showed an increase in p65 expression, an indicator of NF-B activation, during infection with WT GBS but not in response to infection with bspC mutant GBS. membrane proteins from another human brain endothelial cell line (hBMEC) were used to study GBS interactions. the control far Western blot with the streptavidin antibody conjugated to HRP did not show any hybridization. the Miller assay was performed three times with each condition in five replicates. data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test. cells grown to log phase were permeabilized with 0.1% SDS. toluene and enzymatic activity measured by adding ONPG. the strain containing both vimentin and BspC expressing plasmids showed increased -galactosidase activity compared to the empty vector control strain. hCMEC were washed to remove nonadherent bacteria then fixed and labelled with antibodies to vimentin and GBS. no staining of either GBS or vimentin was observed in IgG controls. hek293T pLenti-mock cells do not express vimentin. hek203T pLenti-VIM clone exhibits strong vimentin labelling. hek203T pLenti-VIM clone has strong vimentin labelling. vimentin expression of HEK293T pLenti-Mock (A) and HEK293T pLenti-VIM (B) cells. hCMEC were pre-incubated with antibodies to the N-terminal (E) or the C-terminal (F) of vimentin. WT and vimentin KO mice infected with bspC mutant GBS showed no difference in survival and tissue bacterial counts. vimentin contributes to the initiation of immune signaling pathways during GBS infection. vimentin deficient mice infected with hCMEC showed decreased mortality, bacterial brain loads, and cytokine production in brain tissue. these results corroborate the growing evidence that this intermediate filament protein plays important roles in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections. gp-340 can form complexes with other mucosal components such as mucins. when gp-340 is immobilized, it can be used by bacteria as a receptor for adherence to the host surface. it is unknown if GBS BspC interactions with other host factors are similar to those of other streptococci proteins. vimentin is located in the cytoplasm and functions as an intracellular scaffolding protein that maintains structural and mechanical cell integrity. vimentin is also found on the surface of numerous cells such as T cells, platelets, neutrophils, activated macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells, and brain microvascular endothelial cells. eal pathogen E. coli K1 have demonstrated that the bacterial surface factor, IbeA, interacts with vimentin to promote bacterial uptake into brain endothelial cells [60, 68] another bacterium capable of causing meningitis, L. monocytogenes, uses InlF to interact with vimentin to promote brain invasion [67]. a streptococcal AgI/II protein, BspC, can stimulate NF-B activation and release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and CXCL-1 from hCMEC. both chemokines are major neutrophil recruiting chemoattractants and are the most highly induced during GBS infection [27, 71]. binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2) and NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family pyrin domain-containing-3) that recognize bacterial peptidoglycan and activate inflammatory response via NF-B signaling. these studies will provide important information that may inform future therapeutic strategies to limit GBS disease progression. the anti-BspC polyclonal antibody was further adsorbed against COH1bspC
