{"summary": "the genome from DG01_2011 was sequenced, assembled, annotated, and analyzed. the genome contains 35,240 bp with a GC content of 51.08%. a total of 39 coding sequences were identified. the REA patterns of DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, are identical to each other. the REA patterns of DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009 caused acute bronchitis and pneumonia in an ARD outbreak. DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, caused acute bronchitis and pneumonia in an ARD outbreak. REA allows for comparisons with historical strains that were not sequenced but were characterized by REA patterns and descriptions. all three recent outbreak genomes correspond to the genome type of HAdV-7d, and have identical REA profiles to each other. phylogenetic analysis of 16 available HAdV-7 whole genomes revealed DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, and CQ1198_2010 forming a subclade containing HAdV-7d. all of the genome types form subclades that are separate from the clade containing the prototype 7 (Gomen; 1952) a bootstrap value of 80 indicates robustness and confidence in the branching. the scale bar indicates units of nucleotide substitution per site. DG01_2011 has near genome identity with an earlier HAdV-7 isolate. one synonymous substitution (C to T) was located in hexon assembly-associated protein (A254A) and the other two non-synonymous substitutions G to C and G to T were located in DNA polymerase (S55C) and 34 kDa protein (P87Q), respectively. the nucleotide deletions in ITRs of CQ1198_2010 may be sequencing errors given that the left ITR was not identical with the right ITR, or may represent recent deletion of CATCAT -/- -/- ITR 58 - TC -/- Non-coding Region 518 - Insertion of T - -/- -/- E2B 5517 DNA polymerase GC - DE/- -/- 8470 - GC -/SC -/- L2 14594 Penton base TC - VA/- -/- L4 24298 Hexon assembly the majority of mutations are synonymous and do not affect the integrity of the hexon, penton base, and fiber proteins. the majority of mutations are likely due to tissue tropism being determined and constrained by the fiber gene. genomes of HAdV-B7d strain DG_2011 (Guangdong Province, China; 2011), CQ1198_2010 (Southwestern China; 2010, unpublished) and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 (Northwestern China; 2009)24 were analyzed for sequence recombination events along with HAdV species B genomes using the software Simplot (http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware/simpl genome from DG01_2011 was sequenced, assembled, annotated, and analyzed. genome contains 35,240 bp with a GC content of 51.08%. a total of 39 coding sequences were identified. the genome type of DG01_2011 was determined by comparing its in silico REA profiles with other HAdV-7 genome types reported in the literature3,7,11,15,20. the REA patterns generated from DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, caused acute bronchitis and pneumonia in an ARD outbreak. in-silico restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) pattern analysis of the HAdV-7d sequenced genomes from recently circulating strains DG01_2011, 0901HZ/ShX/2009, and CHN_CQ1198_2010. REA patterns for these recent isolates differ clearly from the prototype, as shown in Figure 2. phylogenetic analysis of 33 archived HAdV-7 hexon genes confirms the genome types. DG01_2011 has an origin common to strains 0901HZ/ShX/2009, CQ1198_2010, Hebei_SJZ_2011, and TW_2011. these hexons form a subclade that is on the same branch with another subclade containing several non-China isolates. phylogenetic analysis of HAdV-7d strain DG01_2011 isolated from Dongguan, southern China (2011). nucleotide sequences of the archived HAdV-7 hexon genes (A) and whole genomes (B) are accessible from GenBank. two single nucleotide substitutions were localized in the ITRs. one non-synonymous substitution each was present in the 100-kDa hexon assembly-associated protein and Virus-Associated (VA) RNA II. the single nucleotide insertion was in a non-coding region of DG01_2011. three non-synonymous substitutions in DNA polymerase (D1039E, S55C) and penton base gene (V239A) respectively. the reference genome is 0901HZ/ShX/2009. nucleotide substitution rates and selection pressures for the HAdV-7d strain DG01_2011 major capsid protein genes were examined by comparing synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. both hexon and penton base genes have less non-synonymous substitutions per site, which leads to the low ratio of Ka/Ks. genomes of HAdV-B7d strain DG_2011 (Guangdong Province, China; 2011), CQ1198_2010 (Southwestern China; 2010, unpublished) and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 (Northwestern China; 2009) were analyzed for sequence recombination events along with HAdV species B genomes using the software Simplot (http://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware/simplo Default parameter settings were used for analyzing the whole genomes. window size (2000 nucleotides [nt]), step size (200 nt), replicates used (n 100), gap stripping (on), distance model (Kimura) and tree model (neighbor-joining) genome nucleotide positions are noted along the x-axis. HAdV-7 is reported to cause a higher mortality rate than HAdV-3 in one long-term survey (1958\u20131990)20, as well as in a recent shorter term survey of adenoviral pneumonia cases in Beijing (2009\u20132011)19. HAdV-7d apparently originated and circulated in China from 1958\u20131990, becoming the predominant strain during the period of 1980\u2013199020. it was also the prevalent genome type found in Korea during two outbreaks in 1995\u2013 HAdV-55 contains a partial hexon gene from HAdV-11. HAdV-55 contains approximately 2.6% of the length of the genome. recombination event revealed by whole genome sequencing indicates this was a novel and emergent pathogen4,37,39,40,41,42. genome types may have different pathogenicity, infectivity, and virulence profiles. a higher mortality rate was reported for children infected by genome types 7d and 7l in Korea. another genome type, HAdV-7h, also resulted in more severe symptoms. there are only three single base substitutions between strains DG01_2011 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009. the high genome percent identity between strains CQ1198_2010 and 0901HZ/ShX/2009 indicates strain 0901HZ/ShX/2009 may be the ancestor of strain DG01_2011. recombination appears to play another novel and major role in molecular evolution of HAdVs and genesis of human pathogens. recent reports of HAdV genomes containing genome segments indicate zoonosis is an avenue of lateral gene transfer. a novel third type of lateral gene transfer is revealed in this newly reported genome of HAdV-7d strain DG01_2011. BLAST analysis reveals the recombinant region to encode the entire L1 52/55 kDa gene of HAdV-B16 with flanking non-coding sequences. the first highly similar sequence is that from the HAdV-B16 prototype (Max. score 2710, Total score 2710, Query cover 100%, E-value 0.0, Ident. 96%) and a HAdV-B16 recombinant (2687, 2687, a pairwise genome dot blot analysis (PipMaker) indicated no recombination events. these observations strongly support and validate the recent paradigm change of using the genome data along with biological and clinical profile changes. in the former outbreak, 176 patients were sampled. in the latter, 440 patients aged between 17\u201322 years were reported as afflicted with ARD62. the hexon nucleotide sequences of five HAdV-7 isolates collected in Taiwan were identical to the sequence of HAdV-7 strain 0901HZ/ShX/200916. the vaccine against HAdV-7 is urgently needed in china due to the apparent decades-absence of circulating HAdV-7. extensive surveillance and corresponding molecular investigation should be carried out when confronting outbreaks of HAdV pathogens in the high-density populations. human adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus OC43 and 229E were detected by real-time PCR. for HAdV identification, type-specific primers were used to characterize the type by PCR. s were PCR-amplified using different primers and resequenced. genome sequence was annotated based on previous annotation of HAdV-7 prototype strain (Gomen)55 and deposited into GenBank with accession number KC440171.
