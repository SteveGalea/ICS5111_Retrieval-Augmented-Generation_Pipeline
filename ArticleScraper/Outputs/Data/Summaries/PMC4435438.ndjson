possibly for the inflammatory process in the aerial ways. the ultrasonic nebulizer of distilled water is insufficient to activate the consequence of cough in up to 20% of the people. the acid citric has greater probability to cause sensation of breathlessness and ardor in pharynx. studies of the effectiveness of anti-cough can suffer the bias from the demulcent effect. l and the Cloperastine fendizoate have not narcotic action in the brainstem. the dextromethorphan is agonist of the receiver not opioid sigma-1. it acts in not-opioid receivers - perhaps of glutamate, serotonin or nociceptin. the anti-cough of central action can boosting the effect depressor of the SNC of the alcohol, hypnotic and sedatives. in many cases of chronic cough it has symptoms or signals of gastroesophageal reflux (RGE) and the inhibitors of the protonic bomb (IBPs), associates or not to the prokinetic ones. the guaifenesin has anti-cough effect in patients with IVAS. it does not inhibit the consequence of cough in submitted healthy volunteers. the vasicine is an originally isolated alkali of leaves of Adhatoda vasica. the honey of bee is demulcent and contains phenols with antirust and antimicrobial. it is cheap and safe for use in bigger children of one year. one third of patients did not receive treatment. phonoaudiologic therapy on cough is esteem that half of patients present some degree of motor dysfunction of the vocal folds. the larynx dyskinesia can be unchained by: inhalation of irritating (smoke or vapors), low temperature or extreme humidity of air, motor acts that involve the respiratory musculature. 16 adults with chronic cough, larynx dyskinesia and refractory symptoms of laryngopharynx reflux to the treatment with IBP. the nasofibrolaryngoscopy was made before and after three months of treatment with IBP managed two times to the day. the threshold of the consequence of adduce of the PPVV was gotten when applying air pulses compressed with changeable pressure in the mucous of the aryepiglottic the bilateral section of the recurrent laryngeal nerve abolishes the cough provoked for mechanical or electric stimulation of the mucous of the larynx and superior portion of the trachea. the mechanoreceptors of low threshold answer the mechanical stimulations. the pulmonary receivers of sprain are activated physiological by the variation of the pulmonary volume during the breath. myelinated staple fibers of type C express some ionic canals of membrane, between which transient receiving potential vanilloid (TRPV) 1 the 4 - numerous also in larynx mucous12 -, and transient receiving potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA-1), activated directly for irritating chemistries10. ideal anti-cough of peripheral action would have to inhibit staple fibers C selectively, to abolish the pathological paroxysms of cough without harm the efferent ways of the cough pass through the nerves vacant and phrenic and of the spinal motoneuron until the expiratory musculature. in the just-born mammals, especially the premature, the presence of secretion, gastric content or other liquids in the superior aerial ways (VAIN) result in movements of deglutition and closing of glottis, apnea, bradycardia and redistribution of the sanguineous the action of the interleukins in the SNC sensitizes the consequence and draws out apneas20. pig younglings are observed biochemists changes and bioelectric in the motoneuron respiratory in the first month of life. sensitivity of the cough is bigger in women and patients with IVAS or variant with cough of asthma (tussigenic asthma)22. mecanoreceivers, nociceptors (chemoreceptors) or chemoreceptors answer the chemical stimulations (acid) in the 2,3%-4,2% of the population consequence it can also be evoked by the palpation of the external auditory meatus. the bilateral section of the recurrent laryngeal nerve abolishes the cough provoked for mechanical or electric stimulation of the mucous of the larynx. the myelinated staple fibers of type C are not the nociceptors become vacant more numerous in the bronchis and lungs the11 and responsible for the bother of the impulse to cough. they express some ionic canals of membrane, between which transient receiving potential vanilloid (TRPV) 1 the 4 - numerous also in larynx mucous12 - and transient receiving potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA-1) the cough provoked for the stimulation mechanics of the trachea is intensified by the instillation of capsaicin in the nasal mucous or esophageal. in the brainstem there are integration between the sensitive afferents of the triplet nerve in the nasal mucous and the wander afferents trachea-bronchial and esophageal15 16. the presence of secretion, gastric content or other liquids in the superior aerial ways (VAIN) result in movements of deglutition and closing of glottis, apnea, bradycardia and redistribution of the sanguineous flow for vital agencies. the action of the interleukins in the SNC sensitizes the consequence and draws out apneas20, what would explain the biggest risk of sudden death in the neonates with infections guinea pig is the specie of small postage more used in experiments13 16. capsaicin, acid (citric, ascetic, tartaric) and ultrasonic nebulized of distilled water are the causes of cough more used, managed in dose only or project dose-reply. studies of the effectiveness of anti-cough can suffer the bias from the demulcent effect (stimulation to the saliva secretion and mucus in the VAS for the sugars) of placebo formulated in boiled22 or of the voluntary inhibition of the cough. anti-cough narcotic (morphine and codeine) acts in the opioid receivers in the nucleus of the solitary treatment in the guinea pig. naloxone, antagonist of these receivers, does not hinder the anti-cough action of codeine in cat14. 34 had evaluated 22 adult patients with chronic cough and 22 healthy volunteers how much to the occurrence of cough and the measures of pH of the condensed air exhaled in the half following hour to the lemonade ingestion. the eight patients who cough in the period where pH of exhaled air remained below of 7,4 had answered to the therapy made with IBP during one month. the pharmaceutical, doses and dosage had not been specified. the hydrochloride mucolytics of ambroxol are an active metabolite of the bromhexine and have antirust, anti-inflammatory properties, surfactant and of local anesthetic. their adverse effects are nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain and coetaneous eruption. the super dosage can provoke dyspneia, ataxia and convulsions36. the honey of bee is demulcent and contains phenols with antirust and antimicrobial. it is cheap and safe for use in bigger children of one year and, pasteurized, rare provokes allergic reaction. one third group of patients did not receive treatment. the dextromethorphan, clobutinol and the Cloperastine fendizoate have not narcotic action in the brainstem. it is agonist of the receiver not opioid sigma-1 and antagonist of receiving N-metil-D-aspartate of the glutamate. the codeine is one of the anti-cough most efficient, however commonly it provokes collateral effect (nauseas, intestinal constipation) and can cause dependence26. the anti-cough of central action can boosting the effect depressor of the SNC of the alcohol, hypnotic and sedatives. the guaifenesin has anti-cough effect in patients with IVAS. it does not inhibit the consequence of cough in submitted healthy volunteers to the capsaicin inhalation. some commercial marks of exempt anti-cough associate the dropropizine, the levodropropizine or the dextromethorphan with classic H1 antihistamines in the formularization. these antihistamines help to alleviate the cough thanks to its peripheral action and to the control of the atopy, but its effect in the SNC cause sleepiness25. l of honey, or 7,5 mg of dextromethorphan, or 6,25 mg of diphenhydramine, or nasal hygiene with physiological serum on the nocturnal cough of 139 children of two the five years with IVAS. half of the patients with chronic cough present some degree of motor dysfunction of the vocal folds (PPVV), the larynx dyskinesia. the sensitivity of the mucous larynx was significantly bigger to the end of the treatment, and the 12 patients who had completed the study had presented cure of the larynx dyskinesia and the cough. the sensitivity of the mucous was significantly bigger to the ending of the treatment. many patients with chronic cough have sensitive neuropathic of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. the importance of the etiological diagnosis of the cough is unquestionable. many sick people appeal to the self-medication with anti-cough and mucolytics - or they request that the doctor prescribe them. the phonoaudiologic therapy can benefit patients with refractory chronic cough to the pharmacologic treatment. this confirms the necessity of attendance to multidiscipline and multiprofessional to the cases."}
