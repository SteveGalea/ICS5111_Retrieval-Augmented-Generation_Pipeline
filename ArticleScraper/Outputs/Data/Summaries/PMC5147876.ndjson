{"summary": "pigs of any age could be infected by enteropathogenic viruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) the positive rate of PEDV is relatively higher in the whole world and causes considerable economic losses to pig-production in recent years. RT-LAMP and real-time RT-PCR gain more sensitivity than antigen-based methods. real-time RT-PCR requires special instruments and dye-labeled probes, making them unsuitable in clinical practice. nanoparticles have lots of nanometer characteristics, such as multivalency, superparamagnetism, modified functional chemical groups. a functionalized nanoparticles-based PCR method was developed to identify PEDV infection in preclinical stool samples. magnetic microparticles coated with PEDV specific probes and gold nanoparticles coated with PEDV specific oligos were used to enrich viral genomic RNA and amplify weak viral signals from fecal samples. the established UNDP-PCR assay for PEDV is fit for diagnosis in early stage of viral infection. PRRSV Shaanxi strain (GenBank No. HQ401282), TGEV strain (GenBank No. HQ462571), PCV2 strain (GenBank No. EU366323) and PPV YL strain (GenBank No. JN860197) used in this study were isolated and purified previously by our research team. fresh fecal samples were collected from individual pigs on farms. they were placed in sterile specimen cups, kept on ice, and returned to the laboratory within 12 h. then stool samples were diluted in PBS buffer, followed by vortex and centrifugation at 4,000 g for 10 min to eliminate fecal debris. 71\u2013105, 211\u2013242, 622\u2013652, 2095\u20132122, 2179\u20132204, 2543\u20132571, 2752\u20132778, 2890\u20132915, 3274\u20133315, 3406\u20133437, 3449\u20133485, 3762\u20133793, 4132\u20134193, 4243\u20134272, 4274\u20134311, 4614\u20134660, 4959\u20134995, 5061\u20135093, 5200\u20135234, 5249\u2013 8 pairs of PEDV specific primers were designed (16 targeted sequence sites in total) PEDV specific primers used in conventional RT-PCR detection method were designed using Primer Premier and Primer-blast software according to PEDV highly conserved sequences in replicase protein-encoding region ORF1a. 26\u2013651 Probe 3 Hybridization 5\u2019NH2-T15GTTCCTGGTACCCATAGAGACAGACC 6234\u20136259 Probe 4 Hybridization 5\u2019NH2-T15ATAGTGGCAGGACCTGTCGGTTGCAC 6784\u20136809 Probe 5 Hybridization 5\u2019NH2-T15AGACAAACTGGCCAACAACGCTGAGT 7046\u20137071 Probe 6 Hybridization 5\u2019NH2-T15GCACCCTTCTTATTTG assay Sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) Position Oligo 1 Hybridization/Amplification 5\u2019SH-T15GCCTCAGAATAGTATGAGACGGCTTCACCGTGAATGGAATGGA 76\u2013101 Oligo 2 Hybridization/Amplification 5\u2019SH-T15CCTGTAGATAGTAGCAAGTGGCTCAGACCGTGAATGGA 626\u2013651 Oligo 3 Hybridization/Amplification 5\u2019SH-T15ATAGTGGCA CCACAAACAAAGTCAGAGAACCAGACCGTGAATGGA 8258\u20138283 Oligo 12 Hybridization/Amplification 5\u2019SH-T15CCTTTATCTCTCATAGGCAACCGTGAATGGA 8775\u20138800 Oligo 13 Hybridization/Amplification 5\u2019SH-T15CCTTTATCTCTCATAGGCAACCGTGAATGGA 9234\u20139259 Oligo 15 Hybridization/Amplification 5\u2019SH-T ml of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with diameter of 15nm was centrifuged at 7,500 g for 30 minutes. the resuspended AuNPs and PEDV specific oligo were mixed together. after that, the functionalized AuNPs were resuspended in 0.01 M PBS and stored at 4\u00b0C until used. complexes were washed twice with 1 mL TE buffer and separated magnetically to remove unbound functionalized AuNPs. eluted DNA barcodes were purified and precipitated with NaAc and absolute alcohol. the amplification products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (EB) and visualized under ultraviolet (UV) light. serially diluted samples with the range from 105 to 1 copies per gram were detected by conventional RT-PCR and UNDP-PCR. the inter-assay and intra-assay was carried out in triplicates of each concentration (104 copies/ gram, 103 copies/gram, 102 copies/ gram) by three independent tests for three consecutive days to test the reproducibility of this assay. 153 fecal samples were collected from apparently healthy pigs in three different pig-raising farms (Qinliangshan, Lvjianyuan and Fuyuan) during the period from November 2015 to January 2016, a total of 153 fecal samples were collected from apparently healthy pigs. the pig farm is located in the south of Zhenfucunyaocun, Jiang village. the RNA extracted from RNA viruses was reversely transcripted into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the reverse transcriptase kit (Takara Corp., Japan) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocols. the extraction procedure was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.
