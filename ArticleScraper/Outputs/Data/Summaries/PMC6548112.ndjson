{"summary": "the earthquake is one of the most natural catastrophic crises that can cause a lot of casualties. in this article, we describe the actions taken by emergency medical service (EMS) after the earthquake in Kermanshah, Varzaghan, and Bam. the occurrence of 23 earthquakes with an intensity of more than 5 magnitudes has been recorded in Iran since 2000. in the past, Iran has experienced several earthquakes in different areas, causing severe economic damage and heavy casualties. the record number of people killed in the earthquakes in the last century has been over 73,000. the EMS as the first responder in the health system was responsible for coordinating and managing health services in this major crisis. in this article, we describe the actions taken by EMS after the earthquake in Kermanshah, Varzaghan, and Sarpol-e-Zahab. the first criterion is the comparison of seismology, geotechnical and texture data. the second criterion is the magnitude of the human damage caused by 3 earthquakes. the fourth criterion: the coordination and pre-hospital Emergency system\u2019s surge capacity program. compared earthquakes Variable Earthquake location Bam East Azerbaijan Kermanshah Baseline Date 2003-12-26 2012-08-11 2017-11-12 Local time 05:26 16:53 21:48 Magnitude (Mw) 6.6 6.5 7.3 Depth (km) 15 9 19 EMS Equipment Local centers (n) 8 14 16 damaged n/a 0 3 Local Ambulance (n) n/a 0 0 0 Technicians of the entire province (n) n/a 11 6 EMS field hospital (n) - 1 3 Other organizations field hospital (n) - - 3 Total referred patients (n) n/a 6275 61500 Surgical operations (n) n/a 50 n/a Ground and air emergency vehicles in the earthquake area (day 1) Deployed provincial ambulances (n) 48 n/a 30 Deployed ambulances from other centers (EMS) (n) 0 0 3 helicopters Ambulance bus ( emergency committee was held at the NEOC site. the disconnection of communication and telecommunication networks in the affected areas has caused difficulties in calling, estimating damages, correct locating and estimating the required resources. 90 ambulances, 19 ambulance buses, two mobile communication vehicles were sent to the earthquake zone. medical teams were called from most of the province's hospitals hours after the earthquake news. the amount of need for force, equipment, and ambulance was estimated by the Committee of the emergency situation of health system crisis. all units located on the western border for the Arbaeen ceremony were settled immediately after the early hours of the incident. in the earthquake of Varzaghan, the Martyr Madani and Taleghani single specialty hospitals were converted into general hospitals. a total of 206 flight missions resulted in the transfer of 2165 injured. a total of 206 flight missions resulted in the transfer of 2165 injured. of the 7350 Kermanshah earthquake missions, 93.9% (6906) were transferred to provincial hospitals and 1.8% (134 persons) to Hamedan province and 4.2% (310 people) to Tehran and Alborz in 20 hours. 29.4% (2165 people) were transferred via air medical service and 70.5% (5185 people) via land medical service. about one-third of the province's capacity has been deployed to the earthquake-affected area. the strength of this program is reducing the need for the transfer of the injured to other provinces. the negative aspect of the program was that the use of provincial capacity would disrupt the provision of the relief process and routine services. EMS of the country for the integrated coordination and management of health services was carried out by this system. this resulted in the transfer of a significant number of injured persons within a limited time frame. limitations of this plan were the lack of an integrated national structure for recording information and lessons learned from events and crises."}
