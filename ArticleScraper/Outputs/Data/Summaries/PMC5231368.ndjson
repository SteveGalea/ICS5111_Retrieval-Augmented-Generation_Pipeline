{"summary": "IBV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus with a 27\u201330 kb genome that encodes several polyproteins. the polyproteins of IBV are cleaved by viral proteases into at least 15 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) the polyproteins of IBV are cleaved into at least 15 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) the existence of lipid rafts in living cells remains controversial. lipid rafts are important during viral infection. lipid rafts are involved in the assembly and egress of viruses. methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD) and Mevastatin (mevastatin) are required for attachment to vero cells. lipid rafts may not be involved in the replication and release of IBV. anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit IgG were incubated with IBV for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were scraped in ice-cold PBS and spun down at 20,656 g for 30 s at 4\u00b0C. lysate was added at the same volume as the 2 SDS sample loading buffer with bromophenol blue. equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the amplification program was set at 94\u00b0C for 25 s, 56\u00b0C for 25 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s for 20 cycles. the sizes and specificity of the PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. GADPH gene was set as the endogenous control. 1 cells were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium. all cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 environment. IBV Beaudette strain [32] was passaged in vero cells. the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of TNEV buffer containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. the supernatant was applied to a discontinuous sucrose gradient followed by centrifugation at 34,426 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 55,000 g for 20 h at 4\u00b0C with SW40Ti rotor. the membranes were detected with ECL Advance Western Blot Detection Kit (Amersham, Marlborough, MA, USA) drug treatment of vero cells washed with serum-free medium. the cells were infected with 1 MOI for 1 h at 4\u00b0C before or after MCD or Mevastatin treatment. primer name sequences S1 forward 5\u2032-TGAGATTGAAAGCAACGCCAGTTG-3\u2032 GAPDH forward 5\u2032-CTTACCATAACTAAGGGC-3\u2032 GAPDH reverse 5\u2032-ATCTTCATCGTGCTGGGCG-3\u2032 2.7 Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) Vero cell monolayers that adhered to coverslips were transfected with plasmids encoding IBV E protein and were then incubated at 37\u00b0 the depletion of cholesterol via MCD treatment did not affect the distribution of NSP5 and NSP12 in cellular fractions. however, the structural proteins, and not NSPs of IBV, are partially associated with cholesterol-enriched raft domains in vero cells during IBV infection. IBV E protein floated in gradient fractions 3\u20135 at 16 hpi. the ganglioside GM1 was also present in fraction 4. the gradient fractions are the same gradient fractions as GM1. at 24 h post-transfection, IBV E protein was mainly distributed in the plasma membrane with GM1. the transfer between the intracellular and plasma membrane indicated that lipid rafts are functionally related to lipid rafts in a time-dependent manner after transfection. vero cells with or without drug treatment were infected with IBV at 1 MOI for 0, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h. supernatants were directly collected and the cells were lysed for Western blot assay. I for 1 h at 37\u00b0C were collected at 0 h, 8 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h. negative-strand gRNA and subgenomic mRNA were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. line charts represent the tendency on the basis of PCR results. endocytosis, the IBV-susceptible cell lines A549 and DF1 were treated with MCD before or after IBV attachment. however, this result was not observed when cells received MCD treatment after IBV attachment. lipid rafts are crucial to virus endocytosis and are required for IBV attachment. the depletion of cholesterol via MCD treatment did not affect the distribution of NSP5 and NSP12 in cellular fractions. structural proteins, and not NSPs of IBV, are partially associated with cholesterol-enriched raft domains in vero cells during IBV infection. vero cells were transfected with plasmids expressing IBV structural protein E. the cells were then permeabilized and immunolabeled with GM1 antibodies. slides were analyzed via confocal laser scanning microscopy. lipid rafts are not necessary for the release of IBV. cell supernatants and total lysates were collected to detect viral proteins with specific antibodies. lipid raft disruption did not influence the release of virions into the supernatant. the samples were evaluated with specific antibodies against the IBV N protein. IBV RNA copies were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR with specific primers. 3.5 Lipid rafts are required for IBV infection, but are not involved in viral genome replication and particle release. host cells were pre-incubated with MCD for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, treated with MCD for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. lipid rafts are crucial to virus endocytosis and are required for IBV attachment. vero, A549, and DF1 cells were treated with MCD before or after IBV infection at 10 MOI. IBV structural proteins co-localized with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. lipid rafts in the cellular surface may mediate viral adhesion to facilitate IBV endocytosis. pathogen-host interactions change downstream signaling network. present study focuses on lipid rafts and its role in the early stages of viral infection. further studies should investigate whether protein molecules in lipid rafts serve as a signaling platform to activate downstream kinases."}
