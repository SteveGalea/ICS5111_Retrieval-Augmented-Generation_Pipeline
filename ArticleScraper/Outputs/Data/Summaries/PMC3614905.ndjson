{"summary": "viruses have developed counter-adaptation strategies to escape immune defenses by evading, suppressing or manipulating the host's immune response. human mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a prototypic soluble calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin, is a key first line host defense molecule and immune regulator. structural variant alleles (B, C, and D) in exon 1 of the MBL2 gene disrupt assembly of MBL high-order oligomers. single nucleotide polymorphisms in promoter region (H/L, X/Y), 5\u2032 untranslated region (P/Q) and other regulatory sites also modify serum concentrations. a high-producing ancestral haplotype (A allele) evolved into multiple low MBL-producing haplotypes because of hetero mice infected with 3,000LD50 native EBOV using supraphysiological dosages of rhMBL had a protective effect which required intact complement component 3 (C3) function [15]. viruses bind to attachment factors and/or cognate receptors which help concentrate the virus on the cell surface. receptors then promote endocytosis or trigger direct fusion of viral and host cells. globulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) was recently proposed as an epithelial receptor that binds the EBOV GP1 receptor binding region [19] but the cognate receptor(s of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells have yet to be identified. a variety of viruses including EBOV, dengue viruses, west Nile virus (WNV), HIV-1, Coxsackie B virus and Ross River virus exploit antibodies or activated complement components a novel MBL receptor-mediated mechanism for enhancing EBOV infection might explain some of the heterotic balanced selection that may contribute to the evolutionary divergence of human MBL haplotypes. we investigated the possibility that human MBL could enhance infection by EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviruses, wild-type-like EBOV and other glycosylated virions. anti-hMBL antibody HYB 131-01 was used for mannan-binding and complement component C4 cleavage assays. anti-human antibody 3F8 was produced by G.L. Stahl [31].

HEK293F and HEK293S GnTI cells (5103/100 l) were incubated with EMEM or DMEM/F12 (2.5% FBS), respectively for 48 hours until 60\u201370% confluent (approximately 2.5104/100 l) monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared and maintained as described above. virion-like particles were preincubated with dilutions of human sera. rhMBL, cyanovirin-N, PNGase F, endo H, thermolysin or serum-free media. cells were preincubated with dilutions of pharmacologic inhibitors of endocytosis. luciferase values were expressed as relative light units per second (RLU/sec) and adjusted for cell viability where appropriate. virions were preincubated with media or 5% MBL-deficient serum (MBL0.6 ng/ml) with or without 10 g/ml MBL (final concentration) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour and then the virion preparation was added to 4104/100 l HEK293T cells. fluorescence was read with a spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices; excitation, 485 nm; emission, 515 nm). experiments were performed twice in triplicate. viruses were preincubated with 10% heat-inactivated MBL-deficient serum. FITC-dextran was incubated with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. FITC-dextran was then incubated with PMA-stimulated, IL-4 supplemented THP-1 cells (1105/100 l reaction volume) in the dark at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. adherent cells were transduced in quadruplicate by incubating shRNA viruses and control vectors. the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium containing 5 g/ml puromycin. after 48 hours, we measured luciferase expression as described in Infection assays and adjusted the results for cell viability. cellular lysates were extracted from shRNA-treated cells with the Qiagen AllPrep protein kit. 10 g lysates were mixed with Laemmli loading buffer and DTT. membranes were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were blocked with 2.5% BSA dissolved in PBS-T solution. mRNA expression of candidate genes was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. skewed data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests. the Tukey test was used for all-pairwise multiple comparison procedures. anti-hMBL antibody HYB 131-01 was used for mannan-binding and complement component C4 cleavage assays. the anti-human MBL neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 3F8, was produced by G.L. Stahl. Puromycin and alamarBlue cell viability reagent were from Invitrogen. PBMC were seeded in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS in a 10 cm tissue-culture dish at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C, fresh media (50 l) and M-CSF (50 ng/ml) were added on day 4. HIV-1 was used for all pseudotyped viral constructs. wild type or wild-type-like viruses Wild-type-like recombinant EBOV (1976 Mayinga variant)-eGFP were prepared in BSL4 laboratories. virus (VSV)-G, and HIV-envelope (env) negative (gp120) virions were produced as previously reported [37], [38] and described in the Methods S1. Infection assays All infections were performed in white clear bottom cell culture microplates unless indicated otherwise. HEK293F and HEK293S GnTI cells (5103/100 l) were incubated with EMEM or DMEM/F12 (2.5% FBS), respectively for 48 hours until 60\u201370% confluent (approximately 2.5104/100 l) monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared and maintained as described above. dilutions of human sera, rhMBL, cyanovirin-N, PNGase F, endo H, thermolysin or serum-free media at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, or 3) cells were preincubated with dilutions of pharmacologic inhibitors of endocytosis at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, or N-glycosylation inhibitors at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours. the final CaCl2 concentration was fluorescence and luminescence were read with a spectrofluorometer. luciferase values were expressed as relative light units per second. virions were preincubated with media or 5% MBL-deficient serum. hendra virus and Nipah virus were preincubated with 10% heat-inactivated MBL-deficient serum (MBL0.6 ng/ml) at 37\u00b0C for 45 minutes before adding the inoculum to Vero E6 cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. 250 l of west Nile virion-like particles were preincubated with 50 l DMEM with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. THP-1 cells (5104/100 l), stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) and supplemented with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) to upregulate potential EBOV receptors [39] became differentiated and adherent after 72 hours of incubation in RPMI 1640 (2.5% FBS) monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared and maintained as described above. hMBL, cyanovirin-N, PNGase F, endo H, thermolysin or serum-free media were preincubated with dilutions of pharmacologic inhibitors of endocytosis at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. dilutions of pharmacologic inhibitors of endocytosis at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, or N-glycosylation inhibitors at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours, and appropriate controls were fluorescence and luminescence were read with a spectrofluorometer. luciferase values were expressed as relative light units per second. virions were preincubated with media or 5% MBL-deficient serum (MBL0.6 ng/ml) viruses were preincubated with 10% heat-inactivated MBL-deficient serum (MBL0.6 ng/ml) at 37\u00b0C for 45 minutes before adding the inoculum to Vero E6 cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. 250 l of west Nile virion-like particles were preincubated with 50 l DMEM, 2% MBL-deficient human serum, with or without 10 g/ml rhMBL at 37\u00b0C the effect of MBL on FITC-dextran endocytosis and GFP expression in HEK293T cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. data were acquired using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using cellQuest Pro software. adherent cells were transduced in quadruplicate by incubating shRNA viruses and control vectors. the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium containing 5 g/ml puromycin. cell viability was assayed with alamarBlue reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. we obtained 4 to 5 unique shRNA constructs per gene from the RNAi Consortium (Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA)[40] targeting 24 candidate lectin, scavenger and other human receptors or receptor-like molecules (Table S1) and cathepsin-L (CTSL1). some of these are implicated in EBOV pathogenesis. after 48 hours, we measured luciferase expression as described in Infection assays. we calculated percentage change in luciferase activity caused by shRNAs. a positive hit was defined as 66% reduction in infection by at least two shRNA constructs for any particular gene. mRNA expression of candidate genes was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. skewed data were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis exact tests. rhMBL-dependent increase in EBOV infection in a variety of human cell lines, including 293F cells. rhMBL-dependent increase in EBOV infection in a variety of human cell lines. rhMBL-dependent enhancement of HIV-EBOV GP infection required EBOV glycoprotein. preincubated with physiological concentrations of rhMBL (0.1\u201310 g/ml) in (A) DMEM or (B) MBL-deficient (0.6 ng/ml) 5% human serum for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. luciferase values were adjusted for cell viability by normalizing to alamarBlue fluorescence units. experiments were performed twice in quadruplicate. we preincubated HIV-EBOV-GP virion-like particles with 5% serum from 35 ethnically diverse individuals. showed associations between level of infection and native MBL activity. EBOV infection was inhibited at serum concentrations >10% in the presence of higher MBL concentrations. this association was validated using 5% serum from our panel of human sera. we compared the effects of human sera from which C2 was removed. MBL-mediated viral infection requires specific glycosylation events known to be essential for its binding interactions. we preincubated 5% human serum (MBL concentration, 3,621 ng/ml) we incubated the serum with HIV-EBOV GP (1200 pg p24/100 l) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour before infecting adherent HEK293F cells. cyanovirin-N (CV-N) inhibited rhMBL-mediated enhancement of HIV-EBOV GP infection in a dose-dependent manner. we compared effects of two endoglycosidases, PNGase F and endo H. they predictably cleave N-linked glycans at different sites. endo H leaves a single GlcNAc residue which is a potential binding site for MBL. Endoglycosidase H (endo H) cleaves linkages within the diacetylchitobiose stem of high-mannose of N-linked glycoproteins. thereby generating a truncated sugar molecule with one N-acetylglucosamine residue remaining on the asparagine. we preincubated HEK293F cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour with 5% MBL-deficient serum. 5% MBL-deficient serum was supplemented with various concentrations of rhMBL. we infected cells with HIV-EBOV-GP virion-like particles (1200 pg p24/100 l) we demonstrated that thermolysin abrogated the MBL-mediated enhancement of HIV-EBOV GP infection in a thermolysin-concentration dependent manner. the maximum reduction of viral infection was 17-fold, whereas there was no inhibition of infection in the absence of MBL. tunicamycin, a chemical inhibitor of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI), also reduced MBL-mediated infection. pharmacological perturbants of endocytosis to investigate if MBL enhanced viral uptake via this canonical pathway. the amiloride analog, EIPA which is important for macropinosome formation [54], inhibited infection of HEK293F cells both in the presence or absence of rhMBL. lipid rafts were required for viral infection regardless of the presence of MBL. infected cells with HIV-EBOV-GP virion-like particles (1200 pg p24/100 l) are relative to DMSO controls. experiments were performed twice in triplicate. dynasore, a potent and specific dynamin inhibitor, did not have any significant effect on infection regardless of the presence of MBL. we found that physiological concentrations of MBL bound effectively to dextran, a prototypic fluid phase marker of macropinocytosis. however, MBL did not enhance the uptake of dextran (Figure 4H) we stimulated 5104 THP-1 cells with PMA (10 ng/ml) and supplemented the cells with IL-4 (100 ng/ml) for 72 hours. we preincubated HIV-EBOV GP or HIV-env negative virion-like particles. five different shRNAs targeting the endosomal protease, CTSL1 (Figure S6) reduced infections by 22\u201399% in the presence or absence of rhMBL. this lent credence to the validity of our assay because proteolysis of EBOV GP by cathepsin-L in the host cell endosome is a critical step for viral entry. lectin 2) reduced HIV-EBOV GP infection to a significantly greater extent in the presence of rhMBL than in its absence for one of the shRNA constructs. Knockdown of protein expression was confirmed by western blots in which single clear bands were detected for CLEC6A and for C1QBP. l puromycin over 48 hours determined cell viability with alamarBlue reagent. we then infected cells in quadruplicate with HIV-EBOV GP virion-like particles. rhMBL enhanced EBOV infection in low complement conditions by 75 to 150%. rhMBL enhanced native Nipah and Hendra viral infections in hypocomplementemic conditions by 20 to 35% respectively. rhMBL significantly enhanced west Nile virion-like particle transduction by 150 to 300% in low complement conditions. comparisons are with baseline values, * p = 0.002; ** p = 0.001. complement contributes to differential antiviral effects of human MBL. rhMBL effectively inhibited infection by EBOV GP-pseudotyped lentiviral virions. rhMBL-dependent enhancement of HIV-EBOV GP infection required EBOV glycoprotein since rhMBL did not enhance infection by HIV-env negative (gp120) or HIV-VSV-G (Figure 1A, 1B). rhMBL-dependent enhancement of HIV-EBOV GP infection required EBOV glycoprotein. the reduced capacity of rhMBL to enhance infection by HIV-EBOV-GP NTDL6 (mutated GP lacks 217 amino acids in the heavily glycosylated mucin-rich region) compared with that for HIV-EBOV GP, which contains intact mucin-rich regions (1.3- vs 17.2fold enhancement, respectively, p0.001). we preincubated HIV-EBOV GP virion-like particles with media or sera (diluted to 1\u201350%) that were complement component 2 (C2)-replete or depleted. recombinant human serum was reconstituted with recombinant human C2 (6.5 g/ml) for comparison. complement components cleave complement components C4 and C2. iC3b binds complement receptor 3 (CR3) leading to enhanced phagocytosis by professional phagocytes and increased cytotoxicity by NK cells. heat inactivation of serum reversed its inhibitory effect on viral infection at higher serum concentrations. 5% human serum (MBL concentration, 3,621 ng/ml) reduced HIV-EBOV GP infection. EDTA also reduced infection which is consistent with the MBL carbohydrate recognition domains' dependence on calcium for binding. clonal antibody or an IgG1 isotype control preincubated HIV-EBOV GP virion-like particles with cyanovirin (0\u2013600 nM) for 1 hour before incubating the particles with 5% serum in the presence or absence of rhMBL. cyanovirin-N inhibited rhMBL-mediated enhancement of HIV-EBOV GP infection in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 197 nM) high-mannose was present in substantial quantities only in untreated, non-deglycosylated virus. we found that PNGase F inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of rhMBL. however, neither active nor heat-inactivated endo H inhibited infection. we preincubated HEK293F cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. we infected HEK293F cells with 5% MBL-deficient serum. significant differences are shown. all experiments were performed twice in quadruplicate. we then tested MBL's effect on HIV-EBOV-GP NTDL6. this lacks a portion of the glycosylated mucin-rich region. carbohydrate trimming by inhibiting glucosidase I-II and -mannosidase II [52] also reduced MBL-mediated infection albeit to a lesser extent than tunicamycin. these chemical inhibitors are potentially cytotoxic but accounted for differences in cell viability by means of cell proliferation assays. MBL mediates HIV-EBOV GP infection via the canonical macropinocytosis pathway for EBOV but with less dependence on actin. we preincubated HEK293F cells with (A) EIPA (5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride, (B) methyl-cyclodextrin (extracts or sequesters cholesterol from the plasma membrane), (C) latrunculin B ( we measured FITC-dextran uptake by flow cytometry and reported the results as mean fluorescence intensity. we confirmed early endosomal acidification is important for EBOV infection. monensin, a carboxylic ionophore which inhibits both endosomal acidification and receptor recycling, attenuated infection to a similar extent in the presence or absence of MBL. rhMBL enhanced infection of both cell types in low complement conditions. infection of THP-1 cells was significantly inhibited by preincubating 5% serum (native MBL concentration, 3,621 ng/ml) we infected cells with HIV-EBOV GP (WT), HIV-EBOV-GP NTDL6 (NTDL6) or HIV-env negative (env neg) in the presence or absence of rhMBL. the box plot represents outliers (dots), 10th and 90th percentiles (whiskers), 25th and 75th percentiles (box) and median values. knockdown of MGL (CLEC10A) reduced infections by 47\u201388%. in our hands, there were no significant differences in protein expression compared with an empty pLK0.1 control vector. we also found a 70% reduction in infection of cells treated with one TYRO3 shRNA which reduced gene expression by 62% but did not reduce protein expression. 8% to 68% by each of three shRNAs compared with that of the empty pLK0.1 control vector. we also showed by means of quantitative real-time PCR that CLEC6A gene transcription was knocked down by >95%. tometry was performed with ImageJ (NIH) by adjusting for variations in the actin loading controls. rhMBL enhanced EBOV infection in low complement conditions by 75 to 150%. rhMBL enhanced native Nipah and Hendra viral infections in hypocomplementemic conditions by 20 to 35%. we preincubated native Hendra and Nipah viruses at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. after 24 hours, infection was detected by chemiluminescence-based viral protein immunoassays. comparisons are with baseline values, *p = 0.001; **p = 0.029. we describe for the first time that MBL enhances EBOV, WNV infections, and to a lesser extent Hendra and Nipah viruses in low complement conditions. these findings suggest certain infectious diseases may have negatively selected high-producing MBL genotypes. this suggests that certain infectious diseases may have negatively selected high-producing MBL genotypes. EBOV GPs are heavily glycosylated with N- and O-linked glycans. the majority of glycans are concentrated in the GP1 glycan cap and mucin-like region. other investigators have speculated that glycans may help EBOV evade immune responses by masking the putative EBOV receptor-binding region. MBL-enhanced HIV-EBOV GP infection was significantly diminished after deglycosylation of virions using PNGase F [50], [64] but not endo H, which leaves an exposed N-acetylglucosamine residue on the polypeptide chain that may serve as a ligand for MBL. this was confirmed by the fact that MBL-mediated enhancement of viral infection was abrogated by thermolysin-treated HIV-EBOV GP calreticulin (cC1qR), CD91, and the binding protein for the globular domain of C1q (gC1qBP/gC1qR/C1QBP) have proven and/or predicted N-linked glycopeptides [67], [67]. we tested whether reduction of N-linked receptor expression [68] by chemical (tunicamycin) or genetic (HEK293S GnTI cells) could reduce MBL-mediated HIV-EBOV GP infection EBOV undergoes macropinocytosis-like endocytosis [17], [70], [74] or clathrin/caveolae/dynamin-dependent endocytosis [75] depending on type of target cells involved. previous studies used replication-competent infectious EBOV, EBOV virion-like particles or pseudotyped lentiviruses. if the phenomenon of MBL-dependent enhancement is applicable to clinically relevant targets, we tested a human monocyte-derived macrophage cell line (Figure 5A) and primary human macrophages (Figure 5B) which represent the type of cells targeted early in the course of natural EBOV infection. we then sought to identify cellular surface receptors that mediated MBL-enhanced viral infection. EBOV-MBL complexes activate C1QBP which then negatively regulates RIG-1 inhibition of viral infection. this in turn could expose potential binding sites in MBL's collagenous stalk for engagement with C1QBP. dectin-2 reduces experimental infection with EBOV. tobin et al. identified mutations in zebrafish and human leukotriene A4 hydrolase genes that conferred heterozygous advantage against Mycobacterium marinum and tuberculosis. a recent report showed a role for MBL in mediating immune pathology in a mouse model of Ross River virus (RRV) arthritis. a mutation in the duffy antigen chemokine receptor confers resistance to malaria. wide variations in plasma concentrations of MBL and certain complement components occur naturally. this variation is due to diversity of genotypes of MBL and complement component C4. deficiency is estimated to affect about 1% of western Europeans. some infectious diseases may modulate complement levels e.g. acute malaria is a pervasive ancient infectious disease. the precise mechanism by which MBL enhances infections by glycosylated virions is not known. the precise mechanism by which MBL enhances infections by glycosylated virions is not known. our study was potentially limited by the fact that we used pseudotyped viruses for mechanistic experiments. we showed a similar phenomenon with wild type-like EBOV and other glycosylated viruses. however, it has been shown that all the GPs of all the Ebolaviruses contain high-mannose and hybrid N-linked glycans. rhMBL enhances HIV-EBOV GP infection in a calcium-dependent manner. more than one-third had very high MBL levels (>4 g/ml) we measured native MBL concentrations (mannan-binding activity) and MBL C4 cleavage activity in sera from 35 healthy adult volunteers of Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic or African-American ancestry. the sample had a 3.7 log10 range of MBL concentrations (0\u20135,424 ng/mL) that were strongly correlated with the concordant MBL C4 cleavage values. we preincubated HIV-EBOV GP virion-like particles (12,000 pg/ml) with PNGase F or endo H (10,000 U/ml each) diluted in DMEM or with DMEM alone for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. products were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and were detected by further incubation with biotinylated Hippeastrum Hybrid Lectin. luciferase values were adjusted for cell viability using alamarBlue. the maximum reduction of viral infection was 17-fold in the presence of rhMBL. there was no inhibition of infection in the absence of MBL. Figure S6 shRNA knockdown of cathepsin-L (CTSL1) and MGL (CLEC10A) we performed RNA interference with a pLK0.1 vector encoding shRNAs that targeted (A) CTSL1 and (B) MGL (CLEC10A) as described for Figure 6.
