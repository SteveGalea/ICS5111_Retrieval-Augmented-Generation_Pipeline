{"summary": "the IHR(2005) require countries to assess the ability of their national structures, capacities, and resources to meet the minimum requirements for surveillance and response. the report describes the results of the assessment undertaken in Uganda. the IHR(1969) were used by WHO Member States to guide international prevention and control of infectious diseases until June 2007. the IHR(1969) included requirements for health and vaccination certificates for travellers from infected to non-infected areas. the IHR(1969) also lacked effective incentives to encourage compliance by Member States. the strategy promotes the integration of surveillance activities for priority conditions, taking advantage of common surveillance and support functions at all levels. Uganda adopted the strategy in 2000 and it is being used as the vehicle for implementing the IHR(2005) [8]. a two-day pre-assessment workshop was held to examine the priorities and objectives. a convenience sample of five sectors were visited to assess the capacities for each of the five IHR(2005) hazards. a two-day pre-assessment workshop was held to examine the priorities and objectives. a convenience sample of five sectors were visited to assess the capacities for each of the five IHR(2005) hazards. district At the district level, a convenience sample of 13 (16%) districts were selected to assess the core capacity requirements for all the IHR(2005) hazards. selected districts included Hoima, Busia, Tororo, Moyo, Ntungamo, Bushenyi, Kasese, Arua, Kampala, Mpigi, Wakiso, Bundibugyo, and kitgum. the selected districts included Hoima, Busia, Tororo, Moyo, Ntungamo, Bushenyi, Kasese, Arua, Kampala, Mpigi, Wakiso, Bundibugyo, and Kitgum. each of the selected districts, the assessment was conducted for the district health office, one hospital or a Health Centre IV (HCIV), and three lower level health centres. the list of notifiable diseases did not require mandatory notification of chemical and radio-nuclear hazards by public health officers. the animal diseases Act (CAP 38) and the Rabies Act (CAP 44) provided for the notification, surveillance and response to zoonotic events like brucellosis, anthrax, avian influenza and rabies. the wild life Act (CAP 200) existed but did not provide for the mandatory notification of zoonoses in wildlife. there were no designated sectoral IHR Focal Points (FPs) to facilitate communications with the IHR NFP in preventing and responding to zoonotic, foodborne, chemical and radio-nuclear hazards. the IHR NFP monitored events at the international level through the WHO event information site. information packages on the IHR(2005) for different target groups and the IHR webpage had not been instituted. none of the districts visited had undertaken activities to increase IHR(2005) awareness. the average completeness and timeliness of weekly public health surveillance reporting were assessed for the four weeks preceding the interview. the average completeness and timeliness of weekly public health surveillance reporting from the district to the national level was 83% (range 46-100%) and 68% (range 44-100%), respectively. cross-border surveillance activities were under taken in response to the SARS outbreak in 2003 and pandemic influenza (H1N1) in 2009. there were periodic joint cross-border planning and simulation exercises for pandemic influenza under the East African Community (EAC) Secretariat. there were periodic joint cross-border planning and simulation exercises for pandemic influenza. the MoH had a roster of experts for supporting infectious hazards response. but it lacked food safety, chemical and radio-nuclear experts. a national stockpile included drugs like Tamiflu, meningitis vaccines and personal protective equipment. the national laboratory policy of 2009 provided for the designation of a national laboratory coordinating office in the moH. the definition of roles and responsibilities of laboratories at national, regional and district levels with regards to infectious and zoonotic investigations. most (77%, or 10/13) of the districts had the laboratory SOPs for infectious and zoonotic diseases. national capacity to confirm priority conditions was malaria, human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), polio, measles, influenza, cholera, Ebola, marburg, meningococcal meningitis, trypanosomiasis, plague, and yellow fever. but the country lacked laboratory capacity for investigating radio-nuclear events. 69% (9/13) of districts and 43% (28/65) of the health facilities had transport media. at least three staff working with the national reference laboratories were certified for safe shipment of biological specimens. there were no national guide lines to streamline the referral of biological samples to reference international collaborating laboratories. the national laboratory services unit participated fully in responding to public health emergencies. the country had one international airport (Entebbe), one international port (Port Bell) and several ground crossing points. there were no provisions for the application of the following IHR documents. the Atomic Energy Act of 2008 (CAP 143) provided guidance on the utilization of atomic energy for socio-economic development and ensured that safety standards were upheld. the legislation did not provide for mandatory notification of accidents, leakage or theft of radioactive sources at radio-nuclear facilities. there were no designated sectoral IHR Focal Points (FPs) to facilitate communications with the IHR NFP in preventing and responding to zoonotic, foodborne, chemical and radio-nuclear hazards. three epidemiologists in the IHR NFP had access to the site and received e-mail alerts of events notified by other countries to the WHO. communications from the IHR NFP were done within the IDSR context. there were no designated sectoral IHR Focal Points (FPs) to facilitate communications with the IHR NFP in preventing and responding to zoonotic, foodborne, chemical and radio-nuclear hazards. capacities for public health surveillance Detection Uganda was using the IDSR strategy to conduct surveillance and initiate interventions for the control of infectious and zoonotic diseases in the general population. only 57% (35/61) and 66% (40/61) of the health facilities had IDSR technical guidelines and case definitions, respectively, for infectious and zoonotic diseases surveillance. the average completeness and timeliness for weekly public health surveillance reporting from the district to the national level was 83% (range 46-100%) and 68% (range 44-100%), respectively. the average completeness and timeliness of weekly public health surveillance reporting from the health facility to the district level was 88% (range 52-100%) and 73% (range 48-100%), respectively. Detection Uganda was using the IDSR strategy to conduct surveillance and initiate interventions for the control of infectious and zoonotic diseases in the general population. the national list of priority conditions was limited to the list of IDSR priority conditions. only 57% (35/61) and 66% (40/61) of the health facilities had IDSR technical guidelines and case definitions for infectious and zoonotic diseases surveillance. the average completeness and timeliness for weekly public health surveillance reporting from the district to the national level was 83% (range 46-100%) and 68% (range 44-100%) during the same period, the average completeness and timeliness of weekly public health surveillance reporting from the district to the national level was 88% (range 52-100%) and 73% (range 48-100%), respectively. there were periodic joint cross-border planning and simulation exercises for pandemic influenza under the East African Community (EAC) Secretariat. but their composition did not meet the expertise required for the multi-hazards approach of the IHR(2005). national clinical guidelines for case management of common infections and zoonoses were found in all the districts. the MoH had a national stockpile that included drugs like Tamiflu, meningitis vaccines and personal protective equipment. all (13/13) districts had focal point officers that serve as spokespersons for coordinating risk communication during emergencies. national guidelines on risk communication were lacking to backup the information. the national laboratory policy of 2009 provided for the designation of a national laboratory coordinating office in the moH. a five-year strategic plan for strengthening national laboratory services was being drafted by the moH and health partners. most (77%, or 10/13) of the districts had the laboratory SOPs for infectious and zoonotic diseases. only 46% (6/13) of the districts reported that the plans were being implemented. the list of international collaborating laboratories for radio-nuclear investigations was not available. the list of inter national reference laboratories for radio-nuclear investigations was available at the national level. there were multiple program-based systems for collecting and transporting specimens to the laboratory. the national level and at least three staff working with the national reference laboratories were certified for safe shipment of biological specimens. there were no national guide lines to streamline the referral of biological samples to reference international collaborating laboratories. despite the absence of a national laboratory biosafety committee, the guidelines had been developed and disseminated to the districts. policy of 2009 provided for the designation of a national laboratory coordinating office in the MoH and health partners. most (77%, or 10/13) of the districts had the laboratory SOPs for infectious and zoonotic diseases. only 54% (7/13) of the districts had operational plans to strengthen laboratory services. the list of international collaborating laboratories for radio-nuclear investigations was not available. the list of inter national reference laboratories for radio-nuclear investigations was available at the national level and had been disseminated. despite the absence of a national laboratory biosafety committee, the guidelines had been developed and disseminated to the districts. the majority of the districts reported having copies of the national biosafety SOPs. the country had one high-containment biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratory and one BSL2+ laboratory, both in the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). there were no provisions for the application of the following IHR documents. there were no provisions for the application of the following documents. the IHR(2005) mandates each country to fully comply with the obligations therein. the scope of activities and operational communication by the IHR NFP was suboptimal. the scope of activities and operational communication by the IHR NFP was limited to the IDSR strategy for communicable disease control, and excluded PoE. advocacy for the IHR(2005) needs to be prioritized in the country. a comprehensive national plan incorporating the IHR(2005) all-hazards approach has to be developed and replicated at district and peripheral levels. the national laboratory SOPs were available at the national level, however critical shortages of laboratory SOPs, reagents, equipment and staffing were observed. shortages in laboratory reagents were mainly attributed to poor stock management. shortages in laboratory reagents were available except for smallpox and radio-nuclear hazards. shortages could be addressed by identifying a list of international collaborating laboratories. national legislation in Uganda should be reviewed to facilitate the attainment of the IHR(2005) core capacity requirements. there is need for a disaster management policy and strategic plan that addresses the IHR(2005) multi-hazards approach for managing public health risks and hazards. cross-border surveillance activities were reactive and only undertaken when there was an ongoing public health risk or hazard. a comprehensive national plan incorporating the IHR(2005) all-hazards approach has to be developed and replicated at district and peripheral levels. HR(2005) requires countries to establish capacities for conducting a comprehensive health risk assessment in response to public health events. it is crucial that the plan provides for the creation of a national biosafety committee, a materials/specimens transfer (referral) policy, a national laboratory accreditation system, and improve the performance of the laboratory information system. the IHR(2005) action plan should be developed to foster improved national and international public health security. a multisectoral taskforce should be constituted to oversee the amendment of the national laws that are relevant for the IHR(2005). the national priority diseases list, surveillance guidelines, case definitions and reporting tools should be updated to incorporate the IHR(2005). authors\u2019 contributions JFW: developed the initial concept, participated in the adaptation of the tools and collection of the data as well as writing of the manuscript.
