{"summary": "coVs are enveloped viruses with large positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. coVs infect a variety of mammalian and avian species, and can cause serious disease in humans. the coV E protein has a well-established role in the assembly of virions. the membrane topology of CoV E is of considerable debate. there are conserved membrane proximal cysteine residues that are targets for palmitoylation [7,13,14,15] there is large variation in the primary sequence of the E proteins. coVs assemble and bud intracellularly at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. formation of the virion envelope required only expression of M and E. this property has been observed for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [20], this property has been observed for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [5], transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [21], and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [21]. the ability of E and M to drive VLP formation clearly shows that E is important for assembly, but the mechanism is not well understood. a version of IBV E with a heterologous HD was able to drive VLP formation and produce infectious virus. TGEV lacking the E gene was shown to assemble virions, albeit to a lower degree than the wild-type viruses. a truncated version of M can functionally replace E in the context of infection. this suggests sequence specific protein-protein interactions between M and E are not required for assembly. palmitoylation of E is the addition of palmitic acid onto membrane proximal cysteine residues. it is likely that palmitoylation alters the conformation of the tail in relation to the membrane. two other PTMs on the E protein have been reported, but not studied. the virus lacking E caused a greater degree of apoptosis compared to the wild-type virus. this result shows that SARS-CoV E may be anti-apoptotic during infection. the suppression of the host stress response by E may be important for down regulating the immune response. all of these proteins are small (63\u201397 amino acids) and contain one or two transmembrane domains, making oligomerization a requirement for channel activity. the role of these proteins varies between viruses, but all of them affect the secretory pathway. the activity of E was first demonstrated for SARS-CoV E in planar lipid bilayers. it was found that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the protein could permeabilize bilayers to Na+ and K+, with a 10-fold preference for Na+. this property was generalized to other CoV groups, as IBV E, MHV E, and HCoV-229E E have ion channel activity for monovalent cations. the role of the ion channel in infection is not entirely clear. studies using inhibitors suggest an important role for the ion channel activity of the E protein. however, it is not clear what step of viral replication is blocked by the drug. the polarity of the Golgi from cis-, medial-, to trans-Golgi is important for sequential processing and proper sorting of cargo. the mechanism by which cargo proteins move through the Golgi complex is controversial. it was originally thought this occurred by the maturation of cisternae [71] procollagen I forms 300 nm triple helical bundles in the ER. the procollagen filaments do not appear to move between the cisternae in vesicles. the trans-Golgi network (TGN) expands in cells producing collagen. this expansion is correlated with efficient release of procollagen. virions were seen in large carriers derived from Golgi/ERGIC membranes. the mechanism underlying the change in Golgi complex morphology is not currently known. the mechanism underlying the change in Golgi complex morphology is not known. s would be a general feature of cells infected with these viruses. many of them do modify the secretory pathway in striking ways. virions were assembled in infected cells, but appeared arrested in the secretory pathway. coV lacking the E gene showed that virions accumulated intracellularly with aberrant material, suggesting that they may be sorted improperly in the absence of E. this suggests that the E protein acts as an ion channel in the secretory pathway, driving the rearrangement of secretory organelles through the alteration of lumenal environments. this in turn leads to efficient trafficking of virions. the mechanism by which cargo proteins move through the Golgi complex is controversial. it was originally thought this occurred by the maturation of cisternae. however, some large cargo proteins such as procollagen I are too big to fit into normal transport vesicles. differences between trafficking of large cargo are not well understood. chylomicrons are large (400 nm) complexes made up of apoB-48 bound to triacylglycerides. they are formed in the ER of intestinal epithelial cells and traffic through the Golgi complex during their biogenesis. the changes induced in Golgi complex morphology for both procollagen and chylomicrons seem to underlie a necessary step in their trafficking. the mechanism underlying the change in Golgi complex morphology is not currently known. virions within the Golgi complex are enlarged and fragmented during infection. the apparent disruption may represent an exaggeration of the mechanisms used by the large cargo described above. it seems possible, or maybe even plausible, that these viruses are exploiting a pre-existing mechanism to facilitate the release of large cargo from the secretory pathway. the topology of the coV E protein is debated in the literature. the E protein does not have a canonical cleaved signal sequence [6] suggesting that the E protein is likely a type II or type III membrane protein. but that is where the consensus ends. the results demonstrate the danger of using epitope tags to determine topology. the results are not consistent with, and often are in direct opposition to, what has been observed experimentally. a small portion of wild-type IBV E protein exists as a membrane hairpin. it is possible that SRP-mediated membrane insertion could produce multiple topologies, including a membrane hairpin and a transmembrane protein. it is important to consider alternate membrane insertion pathways. studies have investigated the role of the GET pathway (guided entry of tail anchored proteins) in CoV E membrane insertion. it is interesting to speculate that CoV E may be inserted into the membrane via multiple mechanisms, resulting in distinct topologies. recombinant viruses should be developed that encode other small ion channels along with E proteins that support assembly but have no ion channel activity. analysis of the ion composition of the disrupted secretory pathway in IBV E expressing cells needs to be carried out to confirm that altered ion balance is responsible for the disruption. recombinant viruses expressing topologically constrained versions of E should be developed, and particle production as well as infectious particle release monitored. in vitro membrane translocation assays should be carried out to determine the components necessary for membrane integration of the E protein (SRP mediated, GET mediated, or a novel route)"}
