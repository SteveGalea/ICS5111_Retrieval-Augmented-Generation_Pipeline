{"summary": "a unique packaging strategy ensures pol particle encapsidation. a non-particle-associated secreted Pol precursor protein was discovered in extracellular wild type PFV particles of different origin. a full-length in-frame PFV Gag-Pol fusion construct showed wildtype-like particle release and infectivity characteristics. PFV Gag-Pol precursor fusion proteins with inactivated protease were highly deficient in regular particle release. coexpression of p71Gag resulted in significant copackaging of these proteins. absence of particle-associated PFV Pol precursor suggests rapid processing upon particle incorporation. retroviral ribosomal frameshifting or termination read-through are essential for pol precursor synthesis. orthoretroviral gag-Pol is incorporated into the virion via interactions with the Gag precursor. it is believed that orthoretroviral Gag-Pol is incorporated into the virion via interactions with the Gag precursor. PFV RNA genome and Pol precursor protein packaging into capsid structures requires at least two cis-acting sequences. these elements comprise the 5' UTR of the FV RNA genome including a 5' part of the Gag ORF (CASI, nt 1-645) and discontinuous regions within a 2 kb fragment of the 3' part of the Pol ORF (CASII, nt 3869-5884) this apparently non-particle-associated Pol precursor protein was pelleted through 20% sucrose in a similar fashion as particle-associated Pol proteins and other viral structural proteins. a major difference was the absence of pol cleavage products p85PR-RT and p40IN in supernatant pellets when Pol was expressed alone. this extracellular Pol precursor appeared to be present as free protein and not in a lipid membrane enveloped vesicular form because it was completely transient co-transfection with 4-plasmids for replication-deficient PFV vector system. transient co-transfection with Pol expression construct p6iPol (4 g + 12 g pUC19) alone. PFV particles generated by transfection of 293T cells. monoclonal antibodies specific for PFV Pol p85PR-RT and p40IN subunits (-RT + -IN), D) polyclonal antibodies specific for PFV Gag (-Gag), E) monoclonal antibodies specific for PFV Env SU (-SU), and F) polyclonal antibodies specific for PFV Env LP (-LP). p127Pol precursor protein is frequently detected in PFV particle preparations of different gp80SU was completely digested by subtilisin treatment. digestion of the LP protein gp18LP removed only its extracellular C-terminal domain. PFV particle preparations were separated by linear velocity gradient centrifugation on iodixanol gradients. p85PR-RT and p40IN Pol subunits were physically separated from the Gag and Pol proteins, banding predominantly at very low densities (Figure 1C-D, lower panels). the lower density of the subtilisin-digested PFV particles probably reflects the removal of the extracellular domains of the envelope subunits. PFV Gag-Pol fusion proteins PFV Pol exists only as a separate pol protein. expression constructs differ only in their Gag domains and presence of PFV PR cleavage sites between the Gag and Pol ORF (GP1, GP2, GP3 and GP4) sequences of PFV Gag origin in dark grey and light grey boxes, of PFV Pol origin in white boxes and of HIV-1 origin in black boxes are given in the 1-letter code. aa not originally encoded by either PFV or HIV-1 derived sequences but from cloning sites are in italic. expression of p68Gag was detectable in samples transfected with proviral constructs PGfP1, PGP1, PGP2 and PGP3. expression of p71Gag was only generated by expression constructs PGfP1 and PGP1 containing the full-length Gag ORF and C-terminal processing sites. antibodies or antisera used were specific for A) PFV Gag (-Gag), B) PFV p pczHSRV2 wt (lane 1, 11, 12; wt); pczHSRV2 iPR (lane 2, 13, 14; iPR); pczHSRV2 PGfP1 (lane 3, 15, 16; PGfP1); pczHSRV2 PGfP1 iPR (lane 5, 19, 20; PGP1); pczHSRV2 PGP1 iPR (lane 6, 21, 22; the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1+zeo vector (plain), p6iGag4 (+Gag wt), or p6iPol (+ Pol wt) pol expression of some constructs deviated significantly from wild type. similar results were obtained using corresponding PFV Gag-Pol fusion protein packaging expression vectors of a 4-component PFV vector system when transfected into 293T either alone or in combination with the residual vector system components. analysis revealed that all constructs expressed the predicted Gag-Pol fusion proteins, which were efficiently processed into the expected cleavage products. a proviral expression construct having only the PR inactivated (iPR) displayed no particle-associated Gag and Pol processing PGfP1 iPR and PGP4 constructs expressing only PFV Gag-Pol fusion proteins showed hardly any subtilisin resistant particle-associated Gag-Pol fusion precursor proteins. this indicates a strong deficiency in particle release of both constructs, which was further supported by the strongly reduced amounts of Env proteins detectable in these samples. the PGfP1, PGP2 and PGP3 constructs were non-infectious. PFV replication is compatible with orthoretroviral-like gag-Pol expression strategies as long as processing between Gag-Pol domains is retained. wild type p127Pol coexpression led to 7-fold increase in supernatant infectivity. infectivity of non-infectious samples generated by cotransfection of separate wild type Gag and Pol iPR expression vectors (PG + PP iPR) could be rescued to 50% levels of the respective wild type control (PG + PP iPR) in cells transfected with the wild type proviral expression construct, capsid structures were homogenous in size. capsid structures with apparently normal morphology and budding structures at different cellular membranes were also detectable. morphogenic phenotype of the iPR mutation in the context of the ribosomal frameshift-mediated Gag-Pol fusion protein generated by PGfP1 (PGfP1 iPR mutant) was definitely more pronounced in comparison to the wild type translational scenario with Pol expressed as an independent protein (iPR mutant) however, if PGP1 was combined with the iPR mutation resulting in PGP1 iPR, no structures with any similarity to original PF p85PR-RT and p40IN were ed through 20% sucrose in a similar fashion as particle-associated Pol proteins and other viral structural proteins. a major difference was the absence of pol cleavage products p85PR-RT and p40IN in supernatant pellets when Pol was expressed alone. this extracellular Pol precursor appeared to be present as free protein and not in a lipid membrane enveloped vesicular form. replication-deficient PFV vector system (4 g puc2MD9, 4 g p6iGag4, 4 g p6iPol, 4 g pczHFVenv EM002) transient transfection with the Pol expression construct p6iPol (4 g + 12 g pUC19) alone (Pol, lane 7+8 [15 ml sup], lane 14 [1/30 of a 10 cm dish]) p40IN subunits (-RT + -IN), D polyclonal antibodies specific for PFV Gag (-Gag), E monoclonal antibodies specific for PFV Env SU (-SU), and F polyclonal antibodies specific for PFV Env LP (-LP). p127Pol precursor protein is frequently detected in PFV particle preparations of different origin. digestion of the LP protein gp18LP removed only its extracellular C-terminal domain. PFV particle preparations were separated by linear velocity gradient centrifugation on iodixanol gradients. a shift toward higher density fractions associated with lower infectivities was observed for the amount of p127Pol precursor protein present in these particle preparations. lower density of the PFV particles reflects the removal of extracellular domains of the envelope subunits. NP40 treatment of virions resulted in a shift of the major Gag and Pol protein containing fractions toward higher densities. however, by this treatment no clear separation of Pol precursor and its cleavage products was observed. expression of an orthoretroviral-like gag-Pol fusion protein is compatible with PFV replication, in particular virion morphogenesis, release and infectivity. we created expression constructs for pure in-frame Gag-Pol fusion proteins, differing only in their Gag domains and presence of PFV PR cleavage sites between the Gag and Pol ORF. PFV Pol origin in white boxes and of HIV-1 origin in black boxes are given in the 1-letter code. aa not originally encoded by either PFV or HIV-1 derived sequences but from cloning sites are in italic. cloning sites in PFV Gag and Pol are indicated by black arrows. all fusion constructs with natural or artificial PFV PR cleavage sites expressed Gag-specific products at levels comparable to the authentic proviral expression construct. expression of p68Gag was detected in samples transfected with proviral constructs PGfP1, PGP1, PGP2 and PGP3. expression of p71Gag was detected in samples transfected with proviral constructs PGfP1 and PGP1 expressing cells. pczHSRV2 wt (lane 1, 11, 12; wt); pczHSRV2 iPR (lane 2, 13, 14; iPR); pczHSRV2 PGfP1 (lane 3, 15, 16; PGfP1); pczHSRV2 PGfP1 iPR (lane 4, 17, 18; PGfP1 iPR); pczHSRV2 PGP1 (lane 5, 19, pol fusion protein packaging constructs the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1+zeo vector (plain), p6iGag4 (+Gag wt), or p6iPol (+ Pol wt) pol expression of some constructs deviated significantly from wild type. similar results were obtained using corresponding PFV Gag-Pol fusion protein packaging expression vectors of a 4-component PFV vector system, when transfected into 293T either alone or in combination with the residual vector system components. analysis revealed that all constructs expressed the predicted Gag-Pol fusion proteins, which were efficiently processed into the expected cleavage products. a proviral expression construct having only the PR inactivated (iPR) displayed no particle-associated Gag and Pol PGfP1 iPR coexpressing p200Gag-Pol and p71Gag also showed only partial subtilisin sensitivity of the p200Gag-Pol precursor protein present in particle samples. however, the PGP1 iPR and PGP4 constructs, expressing only PFV Gag-Pol fusion proteins, contained hardly any subtilisin resistant particle-associated Gag-Pol fusion precursor proteins. this indicates a strong deficiency in GP4 and all constructs with inactivated PR were non-infectious. PFV replication is compatible with orthoretroviral-like gag-Pol expression strategies. packaging construct resulted in no or only minor changes of infectivities in wild type (wt), GP1, GP2 and GP3 samples. wild type p127Pol coexpression led to a 7-fold increase in supernatant infectivity. GP4 has a defect in Gag domains that can be partially rescued by wild type Gag. more heterogeneous capsid structures were observed in samples transfected with the proviral expression construct having the PR inactivated. capsid structures with apparently normal morphology and budding structures at different cellular membranes were also detected. mediated gag-Pol fusion protein generated by PGfP1 (PGfP1 iPR mutant) was definitely more pronounced in comparison to wild type translational scenario. if PGP1 was combined with the iPR mutation resulting in PGP1 iPR, no structures with any similarity to original PFV capsids were detectable. p127Pol precursor protein was detectable in cells transfected with a PFV Pol expression construct. p127Pol was pelletable like intact PFV particles through 20% sucrose. however, large amounts of predominantly subtilisin-sensitive p127Pol precursor were detectable in partially purified PFV wild type virions. pol subunits or mature Pol subunits derived from secreted p127Pol precursor protein to be pelleted through 20% sucrose. potential reasons for such a processing defect could be a misfolding of the released p127Pol precursor resulting in a lack of PFV Pol proteolytic activity mediated by oligomerization through the IN domain. p127Pol precursor protein detectable in pelleted PFV particle preparations is still in line with the current model of PFV Pol incorporation exclusively at its precursor state. however, it suggests that during or early after packaging efficient PFV precursor processing occurs. inhibition of further subunit processing after particle incorporation should result in the clear detection of particle-associated Pol precursor. PFV Pol expression in an orthoretroviral-like gag-Pol fusion is compatible with PFV replication. this is true as long as proteolytic processing between Gag and Pol domains is possible. this is true as long as proteolytic processing between Gag and Pol domains is possible. infectivity of particles derived from HIV-1 frameshift site mediated gag-Pol expression (GfP1) was reduced 5-fold and was reflected by reduced pol particle incorporation and Gag precursor processing. increased cellular Pol precursor levels are not detrimental for PFV particle morphogenesis. a proviral construct similar to GP3 has been described previously. the phenotype of the in-frame GP4 fusion construct was special. the only difference between GP4 and GP3 is the absence of a functional p68Gag/p3Gag cleavage site between the fused Gag and Pol. GP4 seems to have a defect in capsid assembly involving its Gag domains. inactivation of the PFV Pol PR domain always resulted in the failure to produce infectious particles. however, it had different effects on particle formation and release depending on the context of the expression construct. cell lines 293T [32], HT1080 [33], and PFV indicator cell line BHK/LTR(HFV)lacZ [34] were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. all constructs are based on authentic, non-codon-optimized PFV ORFs. constructs GP1, GfP1, GP2, GP3 and GP4 are fused in-frame without any additional sequences. GP3 has most of the PFV Gag p3 domain removed leaving the natural p68/p3 cleavage site intact. in GP4 the PFV Gag p3 domain was completely removed by fusing PFV Pol to p68Gag coding sequences. the different PFV proviral Gag-Pol fusion constructs depicted were generated by replacing a 1829 bp SwaI/PacI fragment of the infectious molecular clone pczHSVR2 [38] with the corresponding fragment of eukaryotic constructs expressing only the mutant Gag-Pol fusion proteins. proviral constructs are labeled with the prefix \"P\" (e.g. PGP-1) that is extracellular viral particles were harvested by ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion in SW28 rotors (Beckman) for 3 h at 25.000 rpm (112,000 g) and 4\u00b0C. after discarding the supernatant the particulate material was gently resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the gradient contained NP40 at a final concentration of 1% (v/v) 120 l fractions were collected from the top to the bottom. antisera, western blot expression analysis and quantification of particle release Western blot expression analysis was performed as described previously. HT1080 cells were seeded 24 h prior to transduction with a density of 2 104/ml in 12 well tissue plates and transduced with 1 ml of viral supernatant or dilutions thereof. after 48 h the amount of focus forming units (ffu) per ml was determined by a blue cell assay involving histochemical -galactosidase staining. ulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. all constructs are based on authentic, non-codon-optimized PFV ORFs. all constructs are based on authentic, non-codon-optimized PFV ORFs. GP2 has most of the PFV Gag p3 domain removed leaving the natural p68/p3 cleavage site intact. in GP4 the PFV Gag p3 domain was completely removed by fusing PFV Pol to p68Gag coding sequences. expression vectors for the Gag-Pol fusion proteins were generated by standard PCR cloning techniques and were verified by sequencing analysis. proviral constructs labeled with the prefix \"P\" (e.g. PGP-1) that is omitted in Gag/Pol packaging constructs of the replication-deficient 4-component PFV vector system. transfections and particle concentration PFV supernatants were generated. subtilisin treatment Subtilisin treatment of concentrated particles was performed as described previously [41] for subtilisin treatment half of the particulate material resuspended in PBS was incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in digestion mix containing final concentrations of 1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and subtilisin (25 g/ml) the other half was treated as a mock control by omitting subtil antisera, western blot expression analysis and quantification of particle release Western blot expression analysis of cell- and particle-associated viral proteins was performed. polyclonal antisera specific for full-length PFV Gag [41], full-length PFV Bet or the leader peptide (LP) of PFV Env, aa 1-86 [37] were used. hybridoma supernatants specific for PFV reverse transcriptase (RT) (clo all titration experiments were performed at least three times. values in each independent experiment obtained with wild type p6iGag4 and p6iPol2 constructs were arbitrarily set to 100%. authors declare that they have no competing interests. this work was supported by grants from the DFG (Li621/3-3, Li621/4-1, Li621/4-2, Li621/6-1)."}
