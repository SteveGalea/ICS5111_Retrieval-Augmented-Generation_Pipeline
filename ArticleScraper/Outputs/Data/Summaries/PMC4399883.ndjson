{"summary": "PDCoV was first identified in a rectal swab collected in 2009 from a pig in Hong Kong, China. it is related to avian and Asian leopard deltacoronaviruses identified in apparently healthy wild animals. PDCoV has been described in association with diarrhea in pigs across all production stages in north America [4\u20136] porcine coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses. coronaviruses contain four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), respectively. ed porcine plasma samples were used in this study. based on sample type and PDCoV exposure status, the samples were divided into three groups. 60 serum samples were collected from 30 sows acutely affected by diarrhea. all 355 samples were tested for presence of anti-PDCoV IgG and for anti-PEDV IgG antibodies using an assay previously described. Archived serum samples (n = 403) collected from 2006 to 2013 prior to initial recognition of PDCoV from 25 different farms. fusion proteins were expressed by transfection of HEK-293T cells. purified using protein A column purification, cleaved with thrombin to remove the Fc tag. optimal antigen concentration and serum dilution were determined using a checkerboard titration. the cut-off was calculated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis for maximum diagnostic sensitivity and specificity using samples classified as PDCoV positive (n = 150) or negative (n = 60 samples) each sample was tested on each of three plates on different occasions to determine the inter-assay CV. serum samples from sows with known PDCoV exposure status were divided into three groups. 60 serum samples were collected from 30 sows acutely affected by diarrhea and again four weeks later on farm A. last 30 samples came from PDCoV negative Farm D. all 355 samples were tested for presence of anti-PDCoV IgG and for anti-PEDV IgG antibodies using an assay previously described [25] Archived serum samples (n = 403) collected from 2006 to 2013 prior to initial recognition of PDCoV. the PDCoV infection status was determined based on real-time RT-PCR for PDCoV on fecal samples. PEDV, PRCV and TGEV RNA were not detected in the feces. all RT-PCRs were performed according to routinely performed standards. each porcine plasma sample consisted of pooled plasma originating from exsanguination of 10,000 pigs slaughtered on the same day. the samples were collected from 14 federally inspected abattoirs located in the eastern part or in the midwestern U.S. a 1:10,000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-swine IgG was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the peroxidase reaction was visualized by using tetramethylbenzidine-hydrogen peroxide solution as the substrate. the PDCoV S1 ELISA was cut-off using MedCalc for Windows, version 13.3.0.0. each sample was tested on each of three plates on different occasions. the coefficient of variation was used to evaluate the intra- and inter-assay variation. a 1:10,000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-swine IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the peroxidase reaction was visualized by using tetramethylbenzidine-hydrogen peroxide solution as the substrate. PDCoV S1 ELISA was tested using eight serum samples with different antibody titers. the coefficient of variation was used to evaluate the intra- and inter-assay variation. each sample was tested on each of three plates on different occasions. PDCoV OD values ranged from 0.04 to 0.33 (average SD, 0.12 0.08) for TGEV. 0.05 to 0.291 (average SD, 0.10 0.06) for PRCV; 0.07 to 0.244 (average SD, 0.13 0.05) for PEDV. the assay cut-off (OD value of 0.34) is indicated by the dashed line. anti-PDCoV and -PEDV IgG antibodies were detected in 81/355 (22.81%) serum samples. positive detection rates in individual PDCoV farms ranged from 20 to 100%. the majority of positive samples were collected in 2013 (40/44, 90.9%) on positive farms, 20 to 60% of the serum samples were positive. 52 porcine pooled plasma samples from 2010 were also tested. the optimal cut-off for the PDCoV S1 ELISA was a 1:100 diluted sample OD value of 0.34 for which the sensitivity and specificity values were higher than 90%. the diagnostic accuracy of PDCoV S1 ELISA was considered to be high as the area under the curve (AUC) index was 0.98. serum anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies obtained from farms with known PDCoV exposure were classified as negative or positive based on viral RNA detection on fecal samples. data presented as ELISA OD values SEM. in 355 serum samples collected during 2014 are summarized in Table 1. Thirty-one serum samples (8.7%) were anti-PDCoV IgG antibody positive which were identified in 13/51 (25.5%) farms. positive detection rates in individual PDCoV farms ranged from 20 to 100%. all serum samples were obtained from commercial pig farms in 18 different states across the united states. the majority of positive samples were collected in 2013. on positive farms, 20 to 60% of the serum samples were found to be positive. a serological assay was developed to evaluate the 2014 prevalence rates of PDCoV in pigs and to determine evidence for PDCoV infection in previous years. a recombinant PDCoV S1 polypeptide-based ELISA was developed and the S1 subunit was selected as coating antigen. anti-PDCoV antibodies and seroconversion were detected within four weeks of initial observation of clinical disease. ideally, the cut-off value should be derived by testing a panel of samples obtained from reference animals with known history and infection status relative to the disease. the lack of a second serological assay and known negative samples did not permit a precise estimation of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test. 6.6% (382) of 5827 cases obtained from 17 of 31 states were positive for PDCoV RNA [30] in the present study, 8.7% (31/ 355) of the serum samples collected from 7/18 states were positive for anti-PDCoV IgG. the percentage of PEDV RNA positive cases was 26.0% (8386/32211) obtained from a total of 31/42 U.S. states according to most recent NAHLN survey [30]. d porcine plasma samples were also used in this study. the data suggest that PDCoV has been circulating in the pig population prior to 2013 without being recognized."}
