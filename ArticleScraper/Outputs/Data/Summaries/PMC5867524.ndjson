{"summary": "the condition at intake had the greatest impact on the outcomes of older cats and dogs. the application of specialized veterinary care, such as orthopedic surgery, is discussed as factors that inform higher rates of live outcomes for these senior companion animals. the american humane association calculates that animal shelters take in an estimated 5\u20138 million cats and dogs every year. the most commonly cited reasons for surrender include: aggressive behavior of the animal, housing-related issues, and caretaker\u2019s personal issues. studies show there has been an increased incidence of surrender due to high medical costs. a retrospective cohort study was conducted on data obtained from APA\u2019s ShelterLuv database. APA was selected due to its collection of innovative programs that are reported to result in a higher rate of live outcomes for animals. 124 cats and 122 dogs over the age of 84 months fell within these selection criteria. data collected for each animal in the study sample included date of intake to APA, intake type (e.g., owner surrender, stray, abandoned), estimated age at intake (in months), weight at intake, identified primary breed, reason for surrender to AAC (if applicable) the length of stay for animals in the sample were reported using the animals\u2019 most recent time in APA\u2019s care. the final day of the study period, 24th November, was used as the last day for time in custody. time in foster was the number of days of the animal\u2019s total time in custody that was spent on-site at APA in one of their kennels. terminal condition for a medical reason included animals with confirmed cancer diagnosis, neoplasia, prolapsed rectum, renal failure in cats, and/or poor mobility in dogs. the coded condition upon intake descriptions reflect the final diagnosis of each animal following this thorough initial evaluation. kennel aggression, swatting or hissing, areas of the body that are sensitive to touch, and resource guarding. animals placed on medication were those experiencing pain, dehydration, or needed ongoing medication for a diagnosed medical condition. animals with a treatment type of surgery required medical action for issues, such as mass removal, orthopedics, tooth extraction or amputation. a logistic regression was performed to determine the impact of the reason for surrender, condition at intake, and treatment plan on senior animals\u2019 outcomes. a 95% confidence interval was used for all statistical analyses, with any result of a p value greater than or equal to 0.05 considered statistically significant. data collected for each animal in the study sample included date of intake to APA, intake type (e.g., owner surrender, stray, abandoned), estimated age at intake (in months), weight at intake, identified primary breed, reason for surrender to AAC. stray, people issues, animal illness, deceased caretaker, negligence, or abandoned. the final day of the study period, 24th November, was used as the last day for time in custody. time in foster was the number of days of the animal\u2019s total time in custody that was

cats included in the study was less than the average time in custody for dogs. length of stay was 1\u2013348 days in custody for cats and 1\u2013367 days in custody for dogs. senior cats and dogs have a longer average length of stay than the general population at APA. a logistic regression was performed to determine the impact of condition at intake on the outcomes for the senior animals. the outcomes for cats and dogs, grouped by their treatment plan, are presented in Table 5. a significant model was achieved for cats (2(8) = 60.04, p 0.01) and for dogs (2(8) = 62.61, p 0.01) according to the model generated based on this sample of senior cats, the cats surrendered due to animal illness were likely to be euthanized at a rate of 80% or adopted at a rate of 20%. cats that came to AAC as strays were then assessed as a terminal condition were likely to be euthanized at average rate of 14.3% is consistent with the actual numbers found in the sample. none of the senior cats or dogs included in the study sample were ultimately euthanized due to behavior reasons. staff to verify the condition of the animals, 11 (9%) of the dogs and 22 (17%) of the cats were transferred from AAC due to behavior concerns. 105 dogs (86%) and 101 cats (81%) were transferred due to medical needs. a majority (72%) of the dogs weighed under 59 pounds. size dog small (0\u201319 lbs) 38 (31%) Medium

Summary of the breeds of cats and dogs. the average time spent in foster care versus on-site at APA for each range of total length of stay (time in custody) for the 124 cats in the sample. a multinomial logistic regression was performed to control for potentially confounding variables. cat treatment plan Euthanasia Adoption Died Still in Care Stolen/Lost Exam 1 (0.8%) 3 (2.4%) 1 (0.8%) 3 (2.4%) 0 (0%) Medication 19 (15.3%) 20 (16.1%) 9 (7.3%) 23 (18.5%) 0 (0%) Surgery 0 (0%) 4 (3.2%) 2 (1.6%) 1 (0.8%) 0 (0%) Monitor 3 (2.4%) 12 (9.7%) 2 (1.6%) 19 (15.3%) 2 (1.6%) cats that came to AAC as strays were then assessed as poor body condition or requiring further medical condition were likely to be adopted at 72.8% and 56.8%, respectively, or likely to die in the care of APA at a rate of 22.7% and 30.4%. based on the model generated on this sample of senior dogs, dogs, regardless of reason for intake were 100% likely to be euthanized if they were classified as terminal. a strong determinant of euthanasia decisions in animal shelters. evidence suggests that animal welfare\u2019s emphasis on advancing spay/neuter programs has contributed to progress in addressing the needs of the growing number of aging cats and dogs in shelters. senior cats and dogs at APA were found to have a longer average length of stay than the general population that was cared for by APA over the study period. most animals in the study (71% for cats and 87.7% for dogs) received some form of medical treatment during their time in APA\u2019s custody. more invasive medical procedures performed on the senior animals in this sample were costly and required extended periods of recovery or monitoring. in this sample, 5.6% of cats and 23% of dogs received one of these higher cost surgical procedures. a shift in tolerance for an increased cost per animal may be needed. partnering are emerging as effective approaches to increasing live outcomes for all at-risk animals in shelters. partnering is emerging as effective approaches to increasing live outcomes for all at-risk animals in their care. innovation in adoption programs may further optimize the potential for adoption of these senior animals."}
