{"summary": "the global disease burden attributable to cryptosporidiosis is substantial. the only approved chemotherapeutic, nitazoxanide, has poor efficacy in HIV positive children. the model is not consistently applied across research studies. cryptosporidiosis is a genus of protozoal parasites that infect a wide range of hosts including wild and domestic mammals, amphibians, and reptiles. the most pathogenic species are C. hominis and C. parvum, which primarily affect people and cattle. in resource-poor countries, disease is characterized by villus atrophy, intestinal crypt inflammation, and maldigestive diarrhea. Nitazoxanide is the only therapy currently approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in people. it has been demonstrated to have modest efficacy in HIV-seronegative children, but not HIV-seropositive children. in veterinary patients there is a dearth of treatment options. the calf model of cryptosporidiosis is the best approximation of human disease because calves experience natural infection and clinical illness that mirrors human symptomology. the model is not consistently applied across research studies, which may impact evaluation of study endpoints such as fecal oocyst shedding, severity of diarrhea, and degree of dehydration. a major disadvantage to CFC is that it is cumbersome and difficult to execute in animal models. a variety of sample collection methods exist to permit simple, non-invasive collection of CFC. the use of confinement housing is necessary to direct the fecal matter expelled by the calf directly into collection pans. calves are more likely to have higher levels of cortisol in the first 10 days of life. there is also a risk that data collected during this period may not be representative. no studies have been conducted comparing CFC and IC, nor are there studies comparing confinement housing and box stalls. each calf was delivered using a single-use plastic sheet or a designated wheelbarrow. a physical exam was conducted and each calf was weighed. the umbilicus of each calf was dipped in an iodine tincture. calves in the confinement housing group were placed inside of commercially manufactured elevated calf stalls. the surface area of each stall was 2.7 m2 (8.75 ft2) each stall was raised 27.9 cm off of the ground. calves were fed every 12 h via nipple buckets with a commercial, non-medicated milk replacer containing 20% crude protein and 20% fat. the oocysts were delivered orally in a 5 mL suspension via an esophageal feeder, followed by approximately 120mL of water to ensure that the entire oocyst suspension was given to the calf. Negative control calves were sham challenged to maintain blinding. qPCR for Cryptosporidium spp. 18S rRNA was performed using a previously described assay on the Applied Biosystems 7500-FAST plaCFCrm. the count was standardized by the fecal dry weight percentage. a complete physical exam was conducted every 12 h at feeding time. cortisol sampling and analysis Blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture on days 2, 4, 5 and 9 post-infection. calves in confinement housing were restrained in sternal recumbancy to visualize the jugular vein. cortisol was extracted from calf plasma by solid phase extraction. quantified using ultra performance liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry. stock solutions were separately prepared in 25% methanol at concentrations of 20 g/mL. ax Eclipse Plus C18 column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) heated to 40 \u00b0C and mobile phases A: water with 0.1% formic acid and B: acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid were used with the following gradient: 90%-80% A over the first minute. 80%-10% A from 1 to 3.5 minutes, a further decrease to 5% A until 5 minutes, followed by an increase back to 90% A until 7 minutes. the frequency of injury was counted once at the time of diagnosis. the frequency of non-fluid therapy treatment was counted with every intervention following diagnosis. bivariate analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between log oocysts per gram of fecal dry matter. calves received 4 L of 50 g IgG/L commercial colostrum replacer within 3 hours of birth. animals were randomly assigned to box stall (n = 9), confinement housing (n = 14), box stall negative control (n = 1), or confinement housing negative control (n = 1) treatments and housed in a BSL 2 isolation facility. calves were fed every 12 h via nipple buckets with a commercial milk replacer. water was provided ad libitum. calves were randomly assigned to inoculation (n = 23) or negative control groups (n = 2). a fecal collection pan was placed beneath each calf and urine was diverted to a 12 h adult diaper. a 0.2 g aliquot of feces was removed from all IC and CFC samples. negative control calves were sham challenged to maintain blinding. a complete physical exam was conducted every 12 h at feeding time. a score of 1 represented normal clinical findings and a score of 3 was consistent with severe clinical illness in the specified category. cortisol sampling and analysis Blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture on days 2, 4, 5 and 9 post-infection. calves in confinement housing were already restrained within the housing system. additional restraint was not required and could have resulted in additional stress. a calibration curve was generated in calf plasma at nominal concentrations of 3, 90, and 175 ng/mL. 150 L of calibration and QC samples were added to a 96-well plate. 20 L of the cortisol-D4 solution was added to each well followed by addition of 300 L methanol. the transitions (m/z) 363.2>121.1 and 367.2>121.1 were used to quantify cortisol and cortisol-D4 respectively. all QC samples were within 15% of their expected values. the coefficients of variation (CV%) were 15%. bivariate analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between log oocysts per gram of fecal dry matter and plasma cortisol. results Enrolled calves weighed an average of 42.1 4.9 kg at birth. no differences in serum total protein across groups (P = 0.7) the uninfected control calf in confinement housing had a mean total fecal output of 0.5 0.6 kg/day (range 0.1\u20132.1 kg/day) and a total mean urine output of 1.7 1.0 kg/day (range 0.4\u20133.9 kg/day) the fecal dry matter percent was significantly lower in CFC samples (P = 0.01). daily log oocysts/g fecal dry matter mean SD 3.4 1.9 3.3 1.8 3.3 1.8 IQR 2.5\u20134.1 2.3\u20134.5 2.1\u20134.4 * P\u2013value 0.05 a Complete fecal collection b Interval collection Fig 1. descriptive summary of study end-points for calves in confinement housing (n = 12) and box stalls (n = 9) from days 0 to 10 post-infection. calves in confinement housing experienced significantly more severe clinical outcomes in comparison to box stall calves. confinement housing calves required 3.5 L/day of parenteral or oral fluid therapy for days 0\u201310 post-infection. box stall calves required 0.25 L/day of parenteral or oral fluid therapy. calves in confinement housing were also more likely to become injured. calves in confinement housing (CH) (n = 12) and box stalls (BXS) (n = 9) experienced abrasions and lacerations over the entire period of enrollment. plasma cortisol levels were significantly higher in confinement housing calves (53.6 31 ng/ml) than in box stall calves (32.2 21 ng/ml) (P = 0.002). this coincides with the peak in fecal oocyst shedding. Fig 3. Comparison of plasma cortisol levels in confinement housing (n = 10) and box stall calves (n = 5) experimentally infected with C. parvum. log oocysts per gram of fecal dry matter was found to be non-significant. the best predictors of total fecal output were plasma cortisol (P = 0.02), percent of milk replacer consumed (P = 0.03) and fecal dry matter percentage (P = 0.01). confinement housing conflicts with The Five Freedoms of Animals. the five freedoms may be compromised if there is scientific justification or no other acceptable alternative exists. the use of confinement housing is unnecessary to measure study end-points. oocyst counts are standardized by fecal dry matter percentage. a representative stool sample can be attained via qPCR. the fecal dry matter percentage was significantly lower in CFC samples compared to IC collected from calves in confinement. lower fecal dry matter percentage of stool collected from the fecal bin would falsely lower the fecal dry matter percentage of stool collected from the fecal bin. if the lower fecal dry matter percentage is a true finding, this would indicate that confinement exacerbates severity of diarrhea. calves in confinement housing required significantly more supportive care than calves in box stalls. in healthy calves, plasma cortisol concentration is reported to be high at birth (40\u201350 ng/ml) and gradually decreases over the first 20 days of life (15\u201320 ng/ml) calves in confinement housing did not follow this pattern. increased stress due to confinement exacerbated the degree of fecal oocyst shedding. in the calf model of cryptosporidiosis this has additional relevance. failure to meet daily fluid requirements through consumption of milk replacer puts calves at greater risk for severe dehydration and development of metabolic acidosis. this also indicates increased time demands on study personnel for provision of care to sick calves. fecal dry matter percentage is a better proxy measure of total fecal output. confinement housing of calves may affect study end-points that are important for the evaluation of novel chemotherapeutics targeting Cryptosporidium. cortisol is just one marker of stress. oocyst shedding could result in imprecise estimates. box stall housing should be preferred in the calf model of cryptosporidiosis.
