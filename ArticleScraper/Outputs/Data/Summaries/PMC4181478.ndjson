{"summary": "human adenovirus 55 (HAdV-55) has caused recent outbreaks of acute respiratory disease. current knowledge on the HAdV-type distributions and its molecular evolution is lacking. adenoviruses (HAdV) are a common cause of acute respiratory diseases, causing sporadic infections, as well as community and institutional outbreaks. infection with HAdV rarely causes serious or fatal illness in otherwise healthy individuals, but may cause severe disease in newborn, elderly, or immunocompromised persons. another two HAdV-55 outbreaks occurred among military training camps in 2005 and 2009. strains from the two outbreaks were highly similar to the QS-DLL strain. most recent HAdV-55 outbreak occurred in 2012 among patients with febrile respiratory tract infection admitted to PLA 252 hospital, Hebei Province, China. nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from the recruited children within 24 hours of admission and stored in the 80\u00b0C. standardized questionnaire was used to gather demographic and hospitalization data such as signs, symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and laboratory test results. phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. similarities between strains were calculated using BioEdit, version 7.13. all GenBank accession numbers for the sequences obtained in this study, as well as those used for comparison, are listed in Table 1. Reference sequences for the hexon/fiber genes and complete genomes from GenBank Strain Accession No. (Hexon/Fiber) Strain Accession No. (Complete genome) south Dakota/6380/1997 FJ841899/FJ841907 HAdV-14 AY803294 Spain/273/1969 FJ841900/FJ84 ARTI was defined as acute onset of cough, rhinorrhea, and dyspnea, with fever 375\u00b0C. a standardized questionnaire was used to gather demographic and hospitalization data such as signs, symptoms, and disease outcome. hexon and fiber gene sequences of HAdV-55 were collected for the establishment of phylogenetic tree for HAdV-55. phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. the bayesian MCMC chain lengths were 1 million generations with sampling every 1000 chain and discarding 10% of the chain as burn-in. the resulting tree of each run was summarized using Tree Annotator. 92 (4817%) infection with HAdV-7, 72 (3770%) with HAdV-3, 6 (314%) with HAdV-55, 5 (262%) with HAdV-5, 4 (209%) with HAdV-1, 1 (052%) with HAdV-2, and 11(576%) with untyped HAdV. the sequence homologies of the six HAdV-55 strains were 998\u2013100% for the hexon gene and 999\u2013100% for the fiber gene, respectively. phylogenetic analyses based on hexon gene and fiber gene revealed the HAdV strains in Chongqing clustered with HAdV-55. hexon gene between the six strains and the HAdV-14 strain (GenBank Accession No.: AY803294) and fiber gene (919%) between the six strains and the HAdV-11 strain (GenBank Accession No.: AF532578) from the above results, three strains were sequenced for the whole genome sequences with the homology of 998%. phylogenetic tree for the whole genome sequences of HAdV-55 demonstrated that all the overall evolutionary rates of hexon gene and fiber gene of HAdV-55 were estimated at 62 105 nucleotide substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) the overall evolutionary rates were lower (17 105 s/s/y, 95% HPD: 22 109\u201335 105 s/s/y) when based on whole genome. four patients had abnormal chest radiograph findings, which included increase in lung markings, interstitial change, or overinflation. the patients recovered without sequela. two other viruses were coinfected with HBoV and PIV-1. three were coinfected with bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Staphyloccocus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively) patient-4 also had evidence of recent CMV infection (IgM assay) phylogenetic analysis of human adenovirus based on partial hexon gene covering hypervariation regions 1\u20137 (nt 18353-20956, corresponding to the QS-DLL strain) and fiber gene (nt 30817-31752) was constructed using neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. homology analysis demonstrated all the determined nucleotide acid sequences and deduced amino acid sequences exhibited high homology to the QS- the closest genetic relationship existed between CQ-2903 and QS-DLL (Shaanxi 2006 strain). most variations were missense mutations and silent mutations. six patients with HAdV-55 infection were boys, and their ages ranged from 1 to 4 years old. three were diagnosed with severe pneumonia and/or toxic encephalopathy with their disease onset occurring in may 2011. the length of their hospitalization stay ranged from 4 to 12 days.
