{"summary": "the innate immune system recognizes pathogen components through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that are specific for conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as pathogen-derived nucleic acids and viral proteins. the recognition of PAMPs ligands leads to the activation of multiple signaling cascades that induce production of interferons (IFN) and other cytokines. in uninfected cells, RIG-I is maintained in an inactive conformation by a C-terminal repressor domain (RD) which masks the CARDs. Deficiency in both RIG-I and MAVS expressions impairs antiviral response and increases susceptibility to RNA virus infection in vitro and in vivo. the recently identified stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein (also called MITA, mediator of IRF3 activation; ERIS, endoplasmic reticulum interferon stimulator; MPYS, N-terminal methionine-proline-tyrosine-serine protein; its gene name is Tmem173, transmembrane protein 173) was shown to play a pivotal role in response to both non-self-cytosolic RNA and teleost fish possess a functional RLR pathway that includes orthologs of human RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [39] and several downstream signaling molecules. overexpression of either full-length RIG-I molecule or the N-terminal CARD domain of RIG-I leads to a strong antiviral state against both RNA and DNA viruses. goldfish (Carassius auratus) also possesses an ortholog of STING. they contribute to the antiviral response mediated by RIG-I pathway. but the role of MAVS, the adaptor molecule of RIG-I, was not addressed. RNA from zebrafish (Danio rerio, XM_694397) nucleotide collection or salmon (Salmo salar, GE786872), carp (Cyprinus carpio, EC394745) and weather loach (Misgurnus anguillicandatus, BJ827384) expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with homology to mammalian STING gene sequences. total cDNAs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vectors pcDNA1.1/Amp (Invitrogen) and peGFP-C1 (Clontech) cDNAs were amplified and cloned into the pcDNA1 vector. sequence of each cloned gene was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. the cDNA corresponding to the C-terminal part of IRF3 (amino acids 115 to 449) was then amplified. the specific primers used to amplify the promoter core of EPC cell IFN1 gene were designed from the sequence of the zebrafish IFN1 gene promoter. the PCR product was then fully sequenced and a fragment KpnI/XhoI was cloned upstream the firefly lucifera the Neighbor-joining tree of STING was calculated by MEGA5 software [51] based on a multiple alignment (using ClustalW) of full-length and partial STING amino-acid sequences from fish and other vertebrates. the conserved synteny around the TMEM173 gene in zebrafish, mouse and human was performed based on the data from the genome assemblies available at NCBI. cell monolayers were stained with crystal violet or subjected to total RNA extraction using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) cell monolayers were then visualized with a UV-light microscope (Carl Zeiss) for immunofluorescence microscopy. RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR Analysis Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) from EPC cells transfected with eukaryotic expression vectors encoding STING, MAVS or an empty vector as a control. all reactions were performed in duplicate from three independent experiments. fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine were previously described. rVHSV of wild-type phenotype and rVHSV-Tomato expressing the tdTomato fluorescent protein were previously described. titers were determined by plaque assay on cell monolayer cultures. total RNA from ZF4-7 (zebrafish, ATCC #CRL-2050) and EPC cells were extracted using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) the RNA was used to generate full-length cDNAs using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Clontech) PCR amplifications were performed using the Advantage 2 PCR kit (BD Clontech) and following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the sequence of each cloned gene was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. specific primers used to amplify by RT-PCR the promoter core of EPC cell IFN1 gene were designed from the sequence of the zebrafish IRF3 gene promoter. a fragment KpnI/XhoI was cloned upstream the firefly luciferase (LUC) gene in the pBlueScript II SK- vector (GenBank X52324). each plasmid construct used in the present study is briefly described in the Table S1. cell monolayers were washed 24 h posttransfection and a well of each transfection was infected with 0.01 to 1 PFU/cell of VHSV or EHNV 48 h posttransfection. after one hour of adsorption, the inoculum was removed, the cell monolayer washed twice and medium samples (0.5 ml of the 2-ml overlay) were taken and replaced by an equivalent volume of fresh medium. eGFP expression from peGFP or pRIG-I Nter-eGFP was measured from 75 l of cell lysates on a Tecan infinite M200 Pro reader using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. luciferase activity was then measured by adding 75 l of luciferase assay reagent on a Tecan infinite M200 Pro reader. zebrafish cDNA is of 1197 nt in length and encodes an ORF of 398 aa. zebrafish cDNA is of 1197 nt in length and encodes an ORF of 398 aa. sequence from zebrafish shows only a weak similarity with its counterparts. resident ER proteins are present along the zebrafish STING sequence. the cDNA is of 1164 nt in length and encodes an ORF of 387 aa (GenBank accession no. HE856620) displaying as expected a high identity with that of zebrafish (71%). the location of the different markers and the chromosomes involved are indicated for the different species. we could also identify partial STING-related sequences in salmon, and in weather loach, suggesting that a STING-related molecule is present in teleost fish. phylogenetic analysis suggested that all these sequences constitute true orthologs. two days posttransfection, the cells were infected with a recombinant fish rhabdovirus expressing the Tomato reporter gene, rVHSV-Tom [49] at a MOI of 1 and incubated at 15\u00b0C. transfection of these cells with a vector encoding the zebrafish STING protected them against rVHSV-Tom infection. at 48 h posttransfection, EPC cells were infected with a recombinant rVHSV-Tom expressing the tdTomato fluorescent protein at an MOI of 1. cells were visualized under a UV-visible light microscope at 24 h postinfection (A) and then stained with crystal violet 4 days postinfection (B) each time point was represented by three independent experiments, and each virus titration was done in duplicate. the viral production in STING-expressing cells was very low. at an MOI of 0.01, the cell monolayer was almost protected for at least 4 days postinfection. the final virus titer was reduced by 3,929-fold. induced mRNA expression of both IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) was quantified using real-time RT-PCR. results indicated that STING overexpression have a strong effect on the IFN induction with 19-fold mRNA increase compared to the empty vector transfected control. part of the protein (IRF3 Cter; amino acids 115 to 449; GenBank accession no. HE856621) together with STING or MAVS abolished the protection as shown by the apparition of a complete CPE 3 days post-infection. thus, overexpression of STING led to a strong induction of both IFN and ISG-stimulated genes which is dependent on IRF3 activation. the culture supernatants were collected at 0, 24 and 96 h postinfection. the viral titer was determined by plaque assay on EPC cells. each time point was represented by three independent experiments. each virus titration was done in duplicate. zebrafish MAVS induced the IFN1 promoter, with a peak at 48 h posttransfection. however, no induction of IFN promoter was observed after zebrafish STING expression in these conditions. coexpression of full-length MAVS and/or STING together with RIG-I Nter delayed the induction of the IFN1 promoter. a similar peak was obtained at 48 h posttransfection instead of 24 h posttransfection with RIG-I Nter alone. a similar peak was obtained at 48 h posttransfection. four transmembrane domains and several ER retention signals were also predicted in the fish STING. zebrafish eGFP-STING was tagged at either its amino- or carboxy-termini with GFP did not retain its activity. transfection of cells with eGFP-STING vector was still able to confer to EPC cells protection against VHSV infection at a somewhat similar level compared to that induced by STING. eGFP-STING or cherry-MAVS overexpression leaded to the aggregation of the mitochondrial network. this aggregation was enhanced by VHSV infection. both proteins were slightly stained together except for some areas where an overlapping staining could be observed. confocal microscopy shows a section of the cell monolayer in the xy plane at the z position indicated by the grey arrow head in the xz plane (small top panel) and the yz plane (small right side panel) zomed insets of boxed areas in merged images are presented. several putative motifs (RXR) found in resident ER proteins are present along the zebrafish STING sequence. the cDNA encodes an ORF of 387 aa (GenBank accession no. HE856620) displaying as expected a high identity with that of zebrafish (71%). phylogenetic analysis suggests that all sequences constitute true orthologs. teleost fish possess a sting gene that is orthologous to the molecule involved in the regulation of IFN expression in human and in mouse. fish EPC cells were transfected with 2 g of pcDNA-STING. as negative control, EPC cells were transfected with the same amount of an empty vector (pcDNA) or as positive control, an expression vector expressing MAVS from zebrafish which was previously shown to induce antiviral immunity. two days posttransfection, the cells were infected with a recombinant fish rhabdovirus expressing the Tomato reporter gene, rV zebrafish STING is a strong antiviral protein. cells were transfected with 2 g of pcDNA-STING and pcDNA-MAVS. at 48 h posttransfection, cells were infected with a recombinant rVHSV-Tom. overexpression of STING decreased the viral titer by 100-fold. the viral production in STING-expressing cells was very low. at an MOI of 0.01, the cell monolayer was almost protected for at least 4 days postinfection. mRNA expression of both IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) was quantified using real-time RT-PCR. results indicated that STING overexpression have a strong effect on the IFN induction with 19-fold mRNA increase compared to the empty vector transfected control. the antiviral response involved the transcription factor IRF3. the co-expression of a dominant-negative of IRF3 corresponding to the C-terminal part of the protein (IRF3 Cter; amino acids 115 to 449; GenBank accession no. HE856621) abolished the protection as shown by the apparition of a complete CPE 3 days post-infection. at 48 h posttransfection, EPC cells were infected with a recombinant rVHSV-Tom expressing the tdTomato fluorescent protein at an MOI of 1. the culture supernatants were collected at 0, 24 and 96 h postinfection and the viral titer was determined by plaque assay on EPC cells. overexpression of eGFP or RIG-I Nter-eGFP reporters strongly induced the IFN1 promoter (13-fold at 24 h posttransfection) zebrafish MAVS induced the IFN1 promoter, with a peak at 48 h posttransfection. asterisk indicates significant differences (*p0.05 and **p0.01) to investigate the involvement of MAVS and STING in RIG-I pathway. a similar peak was obtained at 48 h posttransfection instead of 24 h posttransfection with RIG-I Nter alone. human STING and MAVS Proteins Closely Localize in Mitochondrial-ER Contact Regions Structural analysis of the human STING revealed that the protein contains four hydrophobic transmembrane domains. four transmembrane domains and several ER retention signals (RXR) were also predicted in the fish STING. eGFP-STING localization was clearly not overlapping with the MitoTracker staining. cells transfected with the peGFP-MAVS vector showed a pattern that superposes with MitoTracker staining. eGFP-STING or cherry-MAVS overexpression leaded to the aggregation of the mitochondrial network. EPC cells were cotransfected with 1 g of peGFP-STING and 1 g of pCherry-MAVS. at 48 h posttransfection, EPC were infected with VHSV at an MOI of 1 and incubated at 15\u00b0C for 24 h. isoleucine to an asparagine (I199N) was previously reported as the basis for the type I IFN expression defect in response to listeria infection in a mouse model called Goldenticket [29] other residues like S162, Y167, and T263 found in human STING are also highly conserved between fish and mammals. phylogenetic and synteny analysis indicate that fish STING are true orthologs of the mammalian STING. zebrafish eGFP-STING fusion protein, that retains its activity, was expressed at the ER membrane. this leads to a constitutive signaling and the aggregation of the mitochondrial network. this redistribution of the mitochondrial network has an effect on MAVS and STING co-distribution. fusion machinery, was associated with MAVS and positively regulated RIG-I pathway, suggesting mitochondrial dynamics was important for mitochondria-ER association required for innate antiviral responses. fusion machinery, was associated with MAVS and positively regulated RIG-I pathway, suggesting that mitochondrial dynamics was important for mitochondria-ER association required for innate antiviral responses. new studies in mammals have described multiple DNA sensors contributing to an antiviral DNA recognition response. they include the DNA binding protein DAI, the interferon-inducible sensor IFI16 and the helicase DDX41 [60], [61], [62] and the helicase DDX41 [60], [61], [62]. EPC cells were transfected with 2 g of pRIG-I Nter-eGFP vector encoding RIG-I Nter fused to the N-terminal end of eGFP. at 24 h posttransfection, EPC were infected with rVHSV-Tom at an MOI of 1 and then incubated at 15\u00b0C. EPC cells were transfected with 2 g of peGFP-STING encoding STING fused to the C-terminal end of eGFP or a peGFP vector as a control. at 48 h posttransfection, EPC were infected with rVHSV-Tom at an MOI of 1 and then incubated at 15\u00b0C."}
