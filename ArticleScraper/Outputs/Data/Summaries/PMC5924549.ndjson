{"summary": "viral hepatitis accounts for up to 1.34 million deaths per year. it is the major cause of morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. there is still no reliable cure for HBV infection. NAs inhibit posttranscriptional stages of viral replication, but do not target the stable episomal covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) the hepatitis B X protein plays a role in stabilizing cccDNA by inactivating components of the structural maintenance of chromosomes. associations with factors regulating methylation or heterochromatin formation may also render cccDNA inactive. the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) facilitates HBV entry into hepatocytes [22], peptide inhibitors such as myrcludex-B (NCT02881008 and NCT02888106) are also being developed for therapeutic application [23]. RNAi is an endogenous gene regulatory pathway that can be reprogrammed by exogenous RNA molecules. adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) have been used to deliver cassettes that express HBV-targeting primary microRNA mimics. RNAi-mediated gene silencing of tyrosyl-DNA-phosphodiesterase 2 delays its conversion to cccDNA in HepG2 cells. HBV cccDNA is a primary candidate for nuclease gene editing. compact viral genome restricts development of escape mutants. overlapping reading frames restrict development of escape mutants. Huh7 [45,46,47] HepG2.2.15 [50,55,59,63,64,78] HepG2.2.15 [50,51,52,54,56] HepAD38 [49,52,55,64] HepaRG [52] HepG2 [53,54,56,57,59] ccDNA Cleavage (%) No Yes (12\u201335%) [45,46] Yes (10\u201391%) ** [49,51, nucleases cleave at pre-defined sequences within the HBV genome. mutated cccDNA may be transcribed, but mutant viral proteins cannot carry out viral replication. targeted modifications occur when DNA-binding domains guide epigenetic effectors to pre-defined sequences of cccDNA. id-derived viral sequences were disrupted in a cell culture model of viral replication [38] using inducible liver-derived HepAD38 cells to mimic natural HBV infection [40] ZFN pairs 1, 2 and 3 cleaved 9.8, 34, and 28% of the viral targets respectively. only ZFN pair 3 showed antiviral efficacy but cleavage of cccDNA could not be verified. TALEN dimers designed to bind within the surface (S) and core (C) ORFs showed optimal cleavage activity in the HepG2.2.15 cell line without measurable cytotoxicity. cccDNA targeted disruption frequencies of 35% and 12% were achieved with the S and C TALEN pairs respectively. use of RGNs is now the most popular method of inactivating HBV gene expression. this bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system relies on an RNA guided DNA binding domain with associated Cas9 endonuclease. the system relies on an RNA guided DNA binding domain with associated Cas9 endonuclease. a second study by Seeger and Sohn used next generation sequencing to map CRISPR/Cas9-induced cccDNA mutations. the majority of indels were identified as small deletions when extremely high targeted cleavage (up to 90%) was achieved. other studies report no detectable genotoxic activity. epigenetic modification of DNA may silence gene expression. it is involved in typical cell development and multiple normal or abnormal cellular responses. epigenetic modifications include histone acetylation or deacetylation, histone methylation or demethylation, cccDNA methylation, and cccDNA minichromosome acetylation. hypoacetylation of cccDNA-bound histone 3/4 results in low HBV viremia in hepatitis B patients. hyperacetylation increases HBV replication in duck hepatitis B patients. epigenetic modifications may accelerate cccDNA decay. island II methylation is associated with reduced pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) transcription, viral replication and viremia. in vitro studies showed several DNMTs are upregulated in response to HBV infection. similar reduction in viral gene expression and viremia was observed in human tissue samples with methylated HBV DNA. etic editors on HBV replication are preliminary. however, investigations aimed at developing the approach to treat other chronic viral infections are more advanced. fda approval of HDAC inhibitors for cancer treatment [92] supports the notion that epigenetic editing has clinical potential. a gene therapy-based approach to express IFN- or IFN- were delivered to woodchucks with an HDAd. no obvious side effects were observed and expression of wIFN- did not have a significant effect on WHV replication in mice. a modified IFN- was fused to sequences encoding apolipoprotein A (InterApo) to improve their delivery system. initial assessment demonstrated that interApo exhibited an improved safety profile while maintaining antiviral efficacy. the same group subsequently evaluated efficacy of IL-12 expressed from a semliki forest Virus vector [99]. the anti-tumor and antiviral effects were attributed to the induction of T-cell responses. designer nucleases have dominated the anti-HBV gene editing field. zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems. bp Individual TALE monomer RVDs recognise a single nucleotide Modular assembly of TALE repeats Heterodimers Targets 40 bp Single complementary guide RNA Requires PAM and tracrRNA Targets 20 bp Nuclease domain FokI endonuclease fusion protein PAM-dependent Cas protein Advantages Naturally occurring mammalian proteins Easily assembled, highly specific Very easily synthesized and assembled Disad DNMT3a\u2013catalytic methylation [79] KRAB-transcriptional repressor [80] KRAB-transcriptional repressor [81] Cas9 nickase-RGN heterodimer (targets 40 bp) [51,57] Varying methods of introducing the NTCP receptor into HepG2 cells. anti-HBV ZFNs were first described in a proof-of-concept experiment. 36% of plasmid-derived viral sequences were disrupted in a cell culture model of viral replication. ZFN pairs 1, 2 and 3 cleaved 9.8, 34, and 28% of the target respectively. transcriptional activator-like effector (TALE) is derived from the Xanthomonas bacteria. individual repeat domains comprising 33\u201335 amino acids recognize a single base pair. nucleotide binding specificity of these repeats is predetermined by repeat-variable di-residues (RVDs) located at amino acid positions 12 and 13. this was achieved in liver-derived Huh7 cells transfected with linear viral sequences that generate cccDNA and recapitulate HBV replication. a reduction in viral protein expression was observed across genotypes A, B, C, and D. a synergistic effect was shown when combining IFN- with core TALENs. more than 16 publications have described anti-HBV efficacy of RGNs. mutagenesis of cccDNA in mammalian cells was first demonstrated by Seeger and Sohn [49] who designed CRISPR/Cas9 constructs to bind the conserved enhancer II/core promoter and precore ORFs. gRNA and cas9 nickases are required to effect double stranded DNA cleavage. the large Cas9 endonuclease could be packaged into single stranded AAVs. a recent publication by Scott et al. demonstrated that the smaller Cas9 derived from Staphylococcus aureus could be packaged into single stranded AAVs. epigenetic modifications include histone acetylation or deacetylation, histone methylation or demethylation, cccDNA methylation, and cccDNA minichromosome acetylation. hypoacetylation of cccDNA-bound histone 3/4 results in low HBV viremia in hepatitis B patients, whereas hyperacetylation increases HBV replication [11]. methylation of island I is associated with reduced serum HBsAg concentrations in chronically infected patients. methylation of island II and III is associated with reduced pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) transcription, viral replication and viremia. one study reported successful epigenetic editing of HBV DNA after fusing the catalytic domain of DNMT3a to a ZF that targeted the HBx promoter sequence. the engineered sequence caused downregulation of viral mRNAs and proteins, and a decrease in viral replication in cell culture and in HBV transgenic mice. expression of IFN--encoding sequences in the liver has been explored as a means of improving anti-HBV efficacy and reducing side effects of conventional IFN- treatment. the authors challenged mice with a murine coronavirus, MHV-2. berraondo et al. tested intrahepatic and intramuscular expression of wIFN-5. interferon was readily expressed at both sites of delivery, but expression in the liver was superior. only expression of interferon from the liver was associated with antiviral response. the authors used a murine IL-12 sequence, under transcriptional control of an inducible promoter, and delivered the cassette directly to the liver with the viral vector. woodchucks with a viral load lower than 1010 viral genome equivalents per ml of serum responded well to treatment. the authors further assessed their combination strategy using recombinant IFN- and IL-15 on samples from patients with chronic HBV infection. reconstituting the cytotoxic T-cell response against HBV holds great promise as a strategy for the immune-mediated clearance of the virus in chronic carriers. the lack of suitable chronic HBV infection models also complicates the development of gene therapies for the treatment of the disease. the field is gaining momentum and significant progress seems imminent."}
