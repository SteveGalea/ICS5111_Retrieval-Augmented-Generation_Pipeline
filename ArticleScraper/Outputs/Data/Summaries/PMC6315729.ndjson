{"summary": "the virus causes a range of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. infections may progress to pneumonia and organ failure leading to approximately 35% reported mortality rate [3]. a significant number of MERS cases are linked to healthcare settings. researchers concur that effective hand hygiene practices could significantly limit the transmission of MERS and other emerging viruses in endemic regions. a significant number of MERS cases are linked to healthcare settings, ranging from 43 to 43. transmission of a droplet-transmitted virus in hospitals is primarily transmitted by contact with surfaces or patients already infected with the virus. healthcare workers should practice hand-washing hygiene before and after patient contact, sterilization of patient care equipment before subsequent use, and respiratory etiquette. the world health organization proclaimed hand hygiene to be the major component of standard precaution. the current research investigates the differences noted between healthcare workers\u2019 self-reports of hand hygiene practices and researcher observations of actual hand hygiene behavior. the study took place in three types of hospitals, i.e., public, security forces, and private, in eastern Saudi Arabia. all doctors and nurses on duty in the emergency room were asked to participate. participants were asked to observe hand hygiene practices and administer self-report questionnaires. no data were collected regarding patient behaviors, characteristics, reason for hospital visit, or diagnosis. t-test Two independent sample t-tests were used to examine differences between hand hygiene practices among healthcare workers, two hospital types, and gender. a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to further assess the relationship between hand hygiene practices among healthcare workers. security forces hospital This hospital serves security force personnel and their families. it has 132 beds and some outpatient clinics and other departments created to manage infection and environmental controls. it is a large facility with many outpatient clinics such as internal medicine, maternity, and otorhinolaryngology (ENT), but no hospitalization. all doctors and nurses on duty in the emergency room were asked to participate. at the security forces hospital, infection control personnel assisted in providing access to healthcare workers on duty. 87 participants completed the questionnaire, 83 participants were observed during exams with at least three patients. Observation Checklist Direct observations of healthcare workers\u2019 hand hygiene practices were conducted during work hours using a questionnaire, which contained 16 items. items were grouped into three patient-related time-dependent categories: (a) contact with a patient prior to entrance into an examination room (Before), (b) contact during the exam (During), and (c) contact with a patient upon exit from an examination room (After). a multivariate analysis of covariance was used to further assess the relationship. the practice of hand hygiene measured under three conditions (before, during, and after) was the dependent variable. Statistical analysis controlled for department (emergency rooms or outpatient department), hospital type (public, private, or security forces), and gender (male and female) of the care provider. Table 2 (observations) and Table 3 (self-reports) include minimum scores, maximum scores, means, and standard deviation of all variables. figures also indicate the percentage of observed hand hygiene compliance for physicians (27%) and nurses (29%) among the three time frames. hand hygiene compliance scores before contacting patients were lower than compliance scores during and after contact with patients. hand hygiene compliance scores before contacting patients among all variables were lower than compliance scores during and after contact with patients. figures 1 and 2 show that physicians appear to be more self-aware about their hand hygiene practices than nurses. based on the questionnaire data, all healthcare workers generally believed they were compliant with hand hygiene procedures. the results of this study are robust and relevant to clinical practice in general and specifically in Saudi Arabia. the results of this study are robust and relevant to clinical practice in general and specifically in Saudi Arabia. the public hospital had a dedicated MERS hand hygiene intervention campaign. the security forces hospital only had an annual seminar regarding hand hygiene procedures. this suggests the campaign to increase hand hygiene in the public hospital needs to be rethought with a different implementation strategy. a few healthcare workers were observed not implementing proper alcohol application protocol. some healthcare workers used alcohol wipes to clean their hands, not after hand-washing. these behaviors should be further documented and referenced in order to improve the education of healthcare workers."}
