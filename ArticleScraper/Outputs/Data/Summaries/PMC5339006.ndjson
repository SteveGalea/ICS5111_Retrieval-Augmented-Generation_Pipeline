{"summary": "most of these infections are caused by viruses. in children 5 years, 95% of the sore throat cases are caused by viruses. only in the group of 5- to 15-year-old children, this percentage is reduced to 70%. authors suggest a denaturation of external protein spikes, a pH-induced rearrangement of the tertiary structure of attachment proteins, or selective effect on viral lipid membranes/protein\u2013lipid interaction. iota-carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from the red seaweed. carrageenan containg lozenges (Coldamaris\u00ae, [#1]) for their potential to inhibit viral replication of non-enveloped viruses HRV1a and HRV8 as representatives of major and minor group HRVs. the latter was tested using a hemagglutination inhibition assay. 5.6 Lozenge #2 2.4 mg HR 5.2 Lozenge #3 1.2 mg DCBA/0.6 mg AMC 5.8 Lozenge #5 1.2 mg DCBA/0.6 mg AMC 2.3 Lozenge #6 1.2 mg DCBA/0.6 mg AMC 3.7 Lozenge #7 1.2 mg DCBA/0.6 mg AMC 2.3 Lozenge #8 1.2 mg DCBA/0.6 mg AMC 2.3 Lozenge #6 (Strepsils\u00ae Extra Strong), lozen human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) was purchased from the ATCC. the cells were cultivated in DMEM (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich) and 1% antibiotic\u2013antimycotic mix (Sigma Aldrich) in a 37\u00b0C incubator. human coronavirus OC43 Vero (embryonic green monkey kidney) cells were cultivated in a 37\u00b0C incubator. hCoV OC43 was obtained from the ATCC and propagated in the same medium. the stocks were frozen at 80\u00b0C and virus titers were determined. an incubation of cells with the same dilution series in the absence of any active agent was performed to monitor a potential toxicity of the treatment. from this value, corresponding iota-carrageenan concentrations were calculated for the lozenge #1. two hemagglutination units (HAU) of hCoV OC43/well were incubated with a semilogarithmic dilution series of test samples for 10 minutes at RT. a suspension of chicken red blood cells (RBC; 1%, v/v in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) was added to each well to allow hemagglutination of RBC by the virus for 1.5 hours at 4\u00b0 the virus/beads complexes were removed by centrifugation immediately. the supernatant containing unbound virus was harvested and kept at RT. a 1:1.25 serial dilution in DMEM was prepared in duplicates. DCBA/0.6 mg AMC 3.7 Lozenge #7 1.2 mg DCBA/0.6 mg AMC 2.3 Lozenge #8 1.2 mg DCBA/0.6 mg AMC 2.3 Lozenge #9 1.2 mg DCBA/0.6 mg AMC 2.2 Notes: Lozenge #1 (Coldamaris\u00ae) was manufactured by MoNo chem-pharm Produkte GmbH, Vienna, Austria. human coxsackievirus A10 was obtained from the ATCC and grown on RD cells. the stocks were frozen at 80\u00b0C and virus titers were determined by TCID50 assay. the stocks were frozen at 80\u00b0C and virus titers were determined by TCID50 assay. human rhinovirus 1a and 8 The human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell line (HeLa) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) the stocks were frozen at 80\u00b0C and virus titers were determined by TCID50 assay. xsackievirus A10 was grown on RD cells. the virus was preincubated with a semilogarithmic dilution series of lozenges or control solutions for 30 minutes at RT before it was added to a monolayer of MDCK cells for infection. after an infection period of 45 minutes at RT, cells were washed with medium and then cultured at 37\u00b0C. the antiviral effectiveness of the test samples was assessed by determining cell viability using resazurin fluorescent dye. the ID50 value of each sample was calculated for a sigmoidal dose\u2013response model with XLfit Excel add-in version 5.3.1. the highest nonhemolytic concentration of the test solutions was used as starting point for the dilution series. the virus working stocks (hCoV OC43 and influenza virus A H1N1n) were mixed with the iota-carrageenan bead solution to give a final bead concentration of 25% (v/v) and a HA titer of 7.5 HAU/50 L. at the indicated time points, aliquots were taken. the virus was preincubated with a semilogarithmic dilution series of lozenges or control solutions for 30 minutes at room temperature. after an infection period of 30 minutes at RT, cells were washed with medium and then cultured at 33\u00b0C (HRV) or 37\u00b0C (Coxsackievirus), maintaining the same concentrations of active agent as in the prophylactic treatment. cells were overlaid with semiliquid carboxymethylcellulose medium and then cultured at 37\u00b0C. corresponding iota-carrageenan concentrations were calculated for lozenge #1. the highest nonhemolytic concentration of the test solutions was used as starting point. the virus working stocks (hCoV OC43 and influenza virus A H1N1n) were mixed with the iota-carrageenan bead solution to give a final bead concentration of 25% (v/v) and a HA titer of 7.5 HAU/50 L. carrageenan containing lozenges did not show any hemolytic effect. only lozenge #5 (AMC/DCBA) is active against hCoV OC43 at a dilution of 1:27. hCoV OC43 hemagglutination inhibition by Strepsils\u00ae and Coldamaris. samples in the presence of virus are tested in triplicates. the horizontal line shows the minimal inhibitory dilution/concentration at which the lozenges solution/iota-carrageenan reference still exhibit antiviral activity. Lozenge #1 is highly active against HRV1a with ID50 values of 1:496\u20131:1273, which correspond to iota-carrageenan concentrations between 2.8 and 1.09 g/mL. lozenge #1 is 2-, 6.6-, and 37-fold more active than AMC/DCBA containing lozenges #3, #4, and #5, and 8.5 times more active than HR containing lozenge #2. 50 values of the lozenges solutions and lower and upper 95 % CI were calculated for a sigmoidal dose response model with XLfit Excel add-in version 5.3.1. lozenges containing either AMC/DCBA (#3, #4, #5) or HR (#2) were tested in two separate setups. each in parallel with lozenge #1 (carrageenan) as anti-virally active reference. ievirus A10 Effectiveness against Coxsackievirus A10 ID50 (dilution 1:) 95% CI Superiority of lozenge #1 Lozenge #1 234.062.5 NA Lozenge #2 83.3 >2.8-fold Lozenge #3 8 >29.3-fold Lozenge #4 8 >29.3-fold Lozenge #5 21.04.9 11.1-fold Notes: ID50 values of the lozenges solutions and lower and upper 95 % CI were calculated antiviral activity against influenza virus A H1N1n Effectiveness against IV A H1N1n ID50 (dilution 1:) 95% CI Superiority of lozenge #1 Lozenge #1 45241045.0 NA Lozenge #2 20 >226.2-fold Lozenge #3 9.72037.0 464.4-fold Notes: ID50 values of the lozenges solutions were calculated for a sigmoidal dose response model. time-dependent reduction of free influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43 by binding to iota-carrageenan beads. the viral titer is reduced by 85% and 91% for influenza virus A and hCoV OC43, respectively. hCoV OC43 is at least 1622-fold more effective against hCoV OC43 than the most active of the AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges (lozenge #5) and 1368- to 5474-fold more effective than the other tested AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges with an MIC of carrageenan of 0.032 g/mL. lozenge #9 (Strepsils\u00ae Soothing Honey & Lemon) was tested in comparison to lozenge #1 (carrageenan) against HRV1a and HRV8. the effectiveness of lozenges #2 (HR), #3, #4, and #5 (AMC/DCBA) was tested. antiviral activity against HRV1a and HRV8 Effectiveness against HRV1a ID50 (dilution 1: 95% CI Superiority of lozenge #1 Lozenge #1 (1) 1273.0409.0 NA Lozenge #2 (1) 150.455.4 8.5-fold Lozenge #3 (1) 34.421.6 37.0-fold Lozenge #1 (2) 496.0131.0 NA Lozenge #4 (2) 246.041.0 2.0-fold Lozenge #5 (2) 75.442.1 6.6-fold lozenges #2 (HR), #3, #4, and #5 (AMC/DCBA) were tested in comparison with lozenge #1 (carrageenan) against coxsackievirus A10. only lozenge #5 showed an antiviral effect against the virus at the testable concentrations. the effectiveness of lozenges #2 (HR) and #3 (AMC/DCBA) was tested in comparison to lozenge #1 (carrageenan) which inhibits 50% of the virus replication at a dilution of 1:4524. this corresponds to an iota-carrageenan concentration of 0.31 g/mL. two representative respiratory viruses (influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43) were incubated with iota-carrageenan beads. within 3 minutes, the initial viral load of 3.03e4 influenza virus and 9.43e6 hCoV OC43 particles/well is reduced by 57% and 82%. within 10 minutes, the viral load drops below the detection limit. lozenges containing either AMC/DCBA or HR may exhibit a local antiviral effect in patients with sore throat due to viral RTIs. the experimental setup was the same in both publications. we chose enveloped hCoV OC43 as a representative of the coronaviruses. we hypothesized that spike proteins lose their ability to cause hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes. Lozenge #2, with a pH of 5 was tested as it is the only lozenge that contains HR. no virucidal effect on minor group HRV1a, we could confirm findings of Oxford et al.5. lozenge #1 (carrageenan) was 11.3 times more effective in inhibiting replication than lozenge #3, whereas lozenge #2 was ineffective at the testable concentrations. to this end, we studied the binding kinetics of these two viruses to iota-carrageenan beads. we previously used beads to study the mechanism of the antiviral effect of various polymers. the average timespan that has been observed for the dissolution of a lozenge is sufficient to effectively reduce the titer of representative influenza virus A H1N1n and hCoV OC43. however, it was not clear whether the average timespan that has been observed for the dissolution of a lozenge is sufficient to effectively reduce the titer."}
