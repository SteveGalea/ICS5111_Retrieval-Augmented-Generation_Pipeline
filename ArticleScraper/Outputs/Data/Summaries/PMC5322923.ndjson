{"summary": "researchers have developed a range of different scales to measure individual differences in conspiracist ideation. these scales have not been subjected to thorough investigations of their psychometric properties. this is concerning because scholars may be inadvertently introducing a degree of bias into their studies. Theory Belief Scale [4], the Composite Conspiracy Beliefs Scales [5], and the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory [6]. These scales vary widely in terms of the information provided about scale development, item construction and content, number of items, and internal consistency. there has been a tendency for scholars to treat these scales as factorially unidimensional in the absence of analyses of their factor structures. study 1 English 189 UK undergraduates 17 1 = Never under any circumstances, 7 = Probably yes Not examined.82 Not examined None [4], Study 2 English 60 UK undergraduates 17 1 = Never under any circumstances, 7 = Probably yes Not examined Not reported Not examined None [8], Study 1 English 137 UK undergraduates 17 1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree Not examined.82 Not examined None [12], Study 2 English 328 online adults, location unspecified 7 1 = Strongly disagree, 7 not examined None [48], Study 2 English 112 UK undergraduates 15 1 = Completely false, 9 = Completely true Not examined.87-.89 Not examined None [49] English 420 US adults from online sample 15 1 = Completely false, 9 = Completely true Not examined.87 Not examined Measure of belief in a fictitious conspiracy theory, r =.55 [51] German 281 and 273 central European adults from the community 15 1 = Completely false, 9 = Completely true Not examined. study 1 English 107 Australian adults (unspecified) 15 1 = Completely false, 9 = Completely true Not examined.93 Not examined Measure of belief in 9/11 conspiracy theories, r =.77 [54], Study 2 English 121 Australian adults (unspecified) 15 1 = Completely false, 9 = Completely true Not examined.94 Not examined Measure of belief in fictitious conspiracy theory, r =.78; Measure of \u2018true\u2019 conspiracy theories, r =.75; GCB, the authors [8] elected to compute a total score (Cronbach =.78) arguing that item inter-correlations were high. this is problematic because item inter-correlations and high internal consistencies may still mask underlying latent factors. scale translators have not reported on the dimensionality of the measure. a shorter, 10-item version of the scale has also been translated into French [18] but again a total score was computed in the absence of evidence of a one-factor structure.

Measure of one study [8] submitted the 17 items of the Conspiracy Theory Belief Scale to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) it extracted two distinct factors relating to generic conspiracy theories and climate change conspiracy theories. however, it is not apparent that the study had a sufficiently large size (N = 138) by conservative participant-to-item standards (i.e., a participant-to-item ratio of 10:1) [9] to conduct EFA. a shorter, 10-item version of the scale has also been translated into French [18] but again a total score was computed in the absence of evidence of a one-factor structure. the scale translators have not reported on the dimensionality of the measure. the latter two scales have been subjected to EFA and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) but likewise suffer from a number of limitations. scales that measure generic conspiracist ideation. not examined Endorsement of 33 conspiracy theories, rs =.37-.76 [21], Study 1b German 133 German university students 5 0% = Certainly not, 100% = Certain Not examined.77-.82 15-day interval, r =.84 None [21], Study 2 English 120 UK university students 5 0% = Certainly not, 100% = Certain Not examined.73 Not examined Endorsement of 33 conspiracy theories, rs =.30-.81 [21], Study 3 english 480 US undergraduates 10 1 = Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree Not examined.67 Not examined None Generic Conspiracist Belief Scale [22], Study 1 English 489 mixed US and UK undergraduates Originally 75 (59 following EFA) 1 = Definitely not true, 5 = Definitely true EFA on 59 positively worded items;

MTurk is a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace that allows individuals and businesses to ask \u201cworkers\u201d to complete tasks for payment. the project was advertised as a study on \u201cpolitical opinions and attitudes\u201d and included an estimated duration and compensation. in terms of education, 27.3% had completed high school, 4.0% were still in full-time education, 49.7% had an undergraduate degree, 15.6% had a postgraduate degree, and the remainder had some other qualification. in terms of marital status, 43.7% were married, 27.3% were single and not currently partners, 22.2% were partnered by not married, 5.4% were divorced. a powerful and secretive group, known as the new world order, are planning to eventually rule the world through an autonomous world government. the company intentionally changed to an inferior formula with the intent of driving up demand for their classic product. the Apollo moon landings never happened and were staged in a Hollywood film studio. the 5-item CMQ had a one-dimensional structure using EFA. the fit was adequate in German- and English-speaking samples using multi-group CFA. the response scale for this measure may be criticised for being difficult-to-understand. GCBS items are reported in Table 6. Items and factor loadings for the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale. Item Factor 1 Factor 2 3. The government uses people as patsies to hide its involvement in criminal activities. one-item conpiracy measure We included the one-item conspiracy measure [18]. participants are first presented with instructions that allude to some political and social events being debated. the item was rated on a 9-point scale, ranging from 1 (Completely false) to 9 (Completely true) variance explained = 79.0%), with all items having excellent loadings (.81). an overall subscale score was computed as the mean of the relevant 10 items. this subscale had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach =.95) and good patterns of construct and convergent validity. the retained subscale included 4 items that tap the conspiracist belief that vaccinations are being covered-up. the retained subscale included 4 items that tap the conspiracist belief that vaccinations are being used as population tracking mechanism (Cronbach =.92) factor eigenvalues were determined by factor eigenvalues above 1.0 (the EGV1 criterion), examination of the scree-plot, and parallel analysis results. the latter was used because scree-plot inspection and the EGV1 criterion are known to lead to over-extraction of factors. parallel analysis works by creating random datasets with the same number of cases and variables as the actual dataset. a cut-off value for SRMR is recommended to be \u201cclose to\u201d or.09 [38]. the comparative fit index measures the proportionate improvement in fit by comparing a target model with a more restricted, nested baseline model. data collected via Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) website on may 6\u20137, 2016. MTurk samples are increasingly being used in psychological studies. the majority of participants self-reported as white (84.4%), while 6.1% were of African American ancestry, 5.6% of Asian ancestry, and 3.8% as some other ethnic background. 43.7% were married, 27.3% were single and not currently partners, 22.2% were partnered by not married, 5.4% were divorced, and the remainder were of another marital status. a powerful and secretive group, known as the New World Order, are planning to eventually rule the world through an autonomous world government. the group intentionally changed to an inferior formula with the intent of driving up demand for their classic product, later reintroducing it for their financial gain. the 5-item CMQ had a one-dimensional structure using EFA. participants were asked to respond on an 11-point scale ranging from 0% to 100% (Certain) higher scores on this scale reflect greater generic conspiracist ideation. items were rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (Definitely not true) to 5 (Definitely true) higher scores on this measure reflect greater generic conspiracist ideation. one-item conpiracy measure we included the one-item conspiracy measure. participants are first presented with instructions that allude to political and social events being debated. the item was rated on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (Completely false) to 9 (Completely true) an EFA with quartimax rotation revealed a single factor ( = 7.90, variance explained = 79.0%), with all items having excellent loadings (.81). an overall subscale score was computed as the mean of the relevant 10 items, so that higher scores reflect greater endorsement of general 9/11 conspiracist beliefs. the retained subscale included 4 items that tap the conspiracist belief that vaccinations are being used as population tracking mechanism. the retained subscale included 4 items that tap the belief that vaccinations are being used as population tracking mechanism (Cronbach =.92, 42.1% of the variance explained). the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. was the result of an organised conspiracy by US government agencies such as the CIA and FBI. 77.02 15. Government agencies in the UK are involved in the distribution of illegal drugs to ethnic minorities. 61.16 1. A powerful and secretive group, known as the New World Order, are planning to eventually rule the world through an autonomous world government. in 1947, the US military recovered the wreckage of an alien craft from Roswell, new Mexico. the 5-item CMQ had a one-dimensional structure using EFA and that the fit was adequate in German- and English-speaking samples. GCBS items were rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (Definitely not true) to 5 (Definitely true) higher scores on this measure reflect greater generic conspiracist ideation. a small, secret group of people is responsible for making all major world decisions, such as going to war. the one-item conspiracy measure was rated on a 9-point scale, ranging from 1 (Completely false) to 9 (Completely true) bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity, 2(45) = 9453.29, p.001, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy, KMO =.96, indicated that the 8 items had adequate common variance for factor analysis. the results indicated two factors with > 1.0 (3.37 and 2.87, respectively) and parallel analysis indicated that both factors should be extracted. the retained subscale included 4 items that tap the conspiracist belief that vaccinations are being used as population tracking mechanism. for the BCTI and CMQ, we used a varimax rotation because of the expectation of a single, orthogonal factor. the number of factors to be extracted was determined by factor eigenvalues above 1.0 (the EGV1 criterion) the number of factors to be extracted was determined by factor eigenvalues (the EGV1 criterion) RMSEA values close to.06 indicate a good fit, with values ranging to.10 representing a mediocre fit. a cut-off value for SRMR is recommended to be \u201cclose to\u201d or.09 [38]. correlations of.10 are considered small, correlations of.25 are considered medium, and correlations of.40 are considered large. a two-step procedure was used to examine the factor structures of the three scales. parallel analysis works by creating random datasets with the same number of cases and variables as the actual dataset [36] Factor loadings were interpreted using Tabachnick and Fidell\u2019s [29] recommendations. a cut-off value for SRMR is recommended to be \u201cclose to\u201d or.09 [38]. the comparative fit index measures the proportionate improvement in fit by comparing a target model with a more restricted, nested baseline model. the size of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy, KMO =.93, suggested that the BCTI items had adequate common variance for factor analysis. the results of the EFA revealed two factors with > 1.0 (7.11 and 1.33) but inspection of the scree-plot suggested one primary factor and a steep cut-off to the secondary factor. modification indices were consulted to free error covariances between items #7 and #10. standardised estimates of factor loadings for this modified model were acceptable. all 5 items of the CMQ were loaded onto a single latent variable. fit indices values were found to be 2(5, N = 401) = 194.646, 2normed = 38.929, CFI =.812, RMSEA =.308 with 90% CI =.272-.346, SRMR =.081. the standardised estimates of factor loadings were acceptable. the GCBS items were examined for normality of distribution. the size of the KMO (.94) and Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity, 2(105) = 4292.37, p.001, showed that the 15 GCBS items had adequate common variance for EFA. the results of the EFA revealed only two factors with > 1.0 (5.50 and 4.19) and the scree-plot showed a steep cut-off between the primary and fit indices for the one-factor model were found to be poor. 2(90, N = 401) = 1122.934, 2normed = 12.477, CFI =.751, RMSEA =.169 with 90% CI =.161-.178, SRMR =.089. but the fit of this one-dimensional structure remained poor. Fig 4 depicts the factor structure and standardised estimates of factor loadings for the five-factor model. based on these results, we concluded that the five-factor model should be discarded. structure was more acceptable in terms of fit, though still problematic on a number of indices: 2(33, N = 401) = 191.556, 2normed = 5.805, CFI =.931, RMSEA =.110 with 90% CI =.095-.125, SRMR =.076. results suggest that even following modifications, the two-factor model continued to have poor fit. the size of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy suggested that the BCTI items had adequate common variance for factor analysis. the size of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy, KMO =.93, suggested that the BCTI items had adequate common variance for factor analysis. the results of parallel analysis showed that the mean of the first for random data was smaller than the real data counterpart, whereas the mean of the second was larger than the second for the real data. all 15 items had good loadings on this factor. all 15 items had good loadings on this factor. Cronbach for the overall score was.91. fit indices values were found to be 2(90, N = 401) = 585.008, 2normed = 6.500, CFI =.824, RMSEA =.117 with 90% CI =.108-.126, SRMR =.063. standardised estimates of factor loadings for this modified model were acceptable. the size of KMO measure of sampling adequacy, KMO =.96, suggested that the BCTI items had adequate common variance for factor analysis. the results of the EFA revealed a single factor with = 3.15, which explained 63.0% of the variance. Item numbers reflect the item number in the figure. the large circle is the latent construct, with the rectangles representing measured variables. the small circles with numbers are the residual variables (variances) the standardised estimates of factor loadings for this model were acceptable. this model provided poor fit to the data: 2(3, N = 401) = 22.859, 2normed = 7.620, CFI =.980, RMSEA =.129 with 90% CI =.083-.180, SRMR =.028. results of parallel analysis indicated that both factors should be extracted. the mean of the first and second factor was smaller than the real data counterparts. 6 items for the first factor and 4 for the second factor were cross-loaded onto both factors. we concluded that there is little support for a one-dimensional structure of the GBCS. Fig 4 depicts the factor structure and standardised estimates of factor loadings for the five-factor model. the factor loadings are standardised in parenthesises, and the unstandarised values outside. the small circles with numbers are the residual variables (variances) factor loadings are standardised in parenthesises, and the unstandarised values outside. estimates of covariance between exogenous variables are displayed in italics. the factor loadings were fixed at the indicated value (1.00a) fit indices for the one-factor model were found to be poor: 2(90, N = 401) = 1122.934, 2normed = 12.477, CFI =.751, RMSEA =.169 with 90% CI =.161-.178, SRMR =.089. but the fit of this one-dimensional structure remained poor. the factor loadings were fixed at the indicated value (1.00a) the fit indices for this structure were also found to be poor: 2(80, N = 401) = 1038.819, 2normed = 12.985, CFI =.769, RMSEA =.129 with 90% CI =.164-.183. modification indices were consulted to free error covariances between items under the same factor between items #14 and #15. resulting two-factor structure was more acceptable in terms of fit, though still problematic on a number of indices. evidence of convergent validity was strongest for the BCTI and weakest for the one-item conspiracy measure. however, evidence of convergent validity was strongest for the BCTI. belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory Of the four measures we included in the present work, the BCTI showed the strongest evidence of factorial validity. using EFA, we found support for the idea that the scale reduces to a single dimension, onto which all items load adequately. the high mean scores for this measure suggest that participants in this study were indeed rating some items of the CMQ as factually correct. we suggest that there may be underlying problems with the construct validity of the CMQ, which affects its latent dimensionality. this measure may tap different dimensions of conspiracist ideation. the CMQ appears to have poor factorial validity (and likely poor construct validity) whereas the one-item conspiracy measure appears to have weak convergent validity. scholars who wish to measure generic conspiracist ideation may find it better to use the GCBS, but they should pay careful attention to its factor structure within studies. et al. submit items to exploratory factor analysis using a suitably large sample. submit them to a single factor analysis, to examine the extent of conceptual overlap and possible item redundancy. future studies may also wish to revisit factorial validity of the Conspiracy Theory Belief Scale. findings suggest that scholars working on conspiracist ideation need to pay more detailed attention to measurement issues in their studies. belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory Of the four measures we included in the present work, the BCTI showed the strongest evidence of factorial validity. cist ideation may reflect underlying problems with the construct validity of the CMQ. we believe the poor factorial and convergent validity of the CMQ may reflect rational beliefs about the current state of the world. the GCBS may tap different dimensions of conspiracist ideation. at worst, it may tap multiple dimensions that do not cohere very well. this was to be expected given the inherently low reliability of any one-item measure. we do not recommend the use of the CMQ and the one-item conspiracy measure in future studies. the CMQ appears to have poor factorial validity (and likely poor construct validity), whereas the one-item conspiracy measure appears to have weak convergent validity. scholars should not assume that the GBCS is necessarily one-dimensional. t validity [13] had not been submitted to factor analysis. we found a divergent structure to what the authors of the parent study had assumed. but our findings highlight discrepancies in factorial validity that cannot, and should not, be overlooked. supporting information S1 File.
