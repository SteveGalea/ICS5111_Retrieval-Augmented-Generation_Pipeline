{"summary": "the results showed that the optimal multiplex RT-LAMP reaction was obtained with primer sequences shown in Table 1 and the primer concentrations described in Materials and Methods. at 63 \u00b0C, the best amplification efficiency was observed for all the three HA subtypes (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1) and thus 63 \u00b0C was considered to be optimal temperature for the multiplex RT-LAMP reaction.

NH assay developed in this study is a cost-saving method. it is more suitable for multiple-target detection of limited amount and/or precious nucleic acids. unknown clinical specimens with co-infection can also be distinguished without using any equipment. mRT-LAMP-IRNH offers the same high specificity. assay were found to be 101 copies of synthetic RNA for all three targets. the detection limit for A/H5 obtained by mRT-LAMP-IRNH was ten times higher than that obtained by real-time turbidity detection. sensitivity of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay was compared to that obtained by real-time RT-PCR. a highly sensitive and specific mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay was developed for the first time in this study. this assay can detect three prominent subtypes of influenza viruses (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1). the advantages of cost-saving and no requirement of any complicated instrument make this assay more suitable for low-equipment setting laboratory use and for on-site testing. four known positive poultry cage surface swabs were collected from live poultry markets. all these isolates and specimens were stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. RNA was extracted from 200 l of samples with a MagNA PureTM system. the sequence information of the final selected multiplex RT-LAMP primers is shown in Table 1. the cascade invasive reaction upstream probes and downstream probes were designed using the Universal Invader Design Software version 1.2.4 (Third Wave Technologies, Inc., Madison, USA) modification of AuNPs were synthesized by reducing tetrachloroauric acid with trisodium citrate according to the protocol described previously46. transmission electron micrographs were taken to measure the size of synthetic particles (an average diameter of 13 nm) the 20 l invasive reaction was carried out with 0.2 M upstream probe, 0.2 M downstream probe, 0.2 M hairpin probe, 100 ng AfuFEN enzyme. reactions were run at 85 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by 63 \u00b0C for 20 min. clinical specimen analysis To investigate the feasibility of our methodology for clinical sample analysis, 88 clinical specimens were collected and analyzed by mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay. the parallel analysis by our in-house real-time RT-PCR assays for influenza A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1 was recommended by WHO48,49,50. all the three assays had been validated against viral culture and commercial real-time RT-PCR kits. 84 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from influenza-like cases. 48 were identified positive for influenza A viruses including 18A/H7N9, 2A/H5N1, and 28 2009A/H1N1. 4 known positive poultry cage surface swabs were collected from live poultry markets. primers and probes were designed using conserved regions of the HA gene for each influenza A subtype. primers were designed using the PrimerExplorer version 4 program (Eiken Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) the feasibility and specificity of the primers were subsequently checked by BLAST search with sequences in GenBank. multiplex RT-LAMP reaction was carried out with a RNA Amplification Kit. reaction mixture containing 1 l of distilled water was used as no-template controls. reaction mixture containing 1 l of distilled water was used as no-template controls. a heat-block (ThermoStat Plus, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) was used for RT-LAMP amplification reaction. three target-specific cascade invasive reactions were performed. a total of 88 clinical specimens were collected and analyzed by mRT-LAMP-IRNH assays. the amplicons from each RT-LAMP reaction were further identified by cascade invasive reaction and gold nanoparticle hybridization as described before in three separate target-specific detection tubes."}
