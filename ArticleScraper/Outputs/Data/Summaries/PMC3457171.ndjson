RESULTS Animal characteristics and clinical outcomes. viral RNA was detectable in nasal swabs at 1 dpi, with levels peaking at 2 dpi in both young adult and aged animals. viral genomes ceased to be detected at 21 dpi in both young adult and aged animals. it is possible that CA04 shedding has a biphasic course. higher levels of viral RNA were detected in the BAL fluid. they reached 107 to 108 genomes/100 l BAL fluid at 4 dpi. these levels began to decline at 7 dpi, becoming undetectable by 21 dpi. prior to CA04 infection, frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the BAL fluid were each at 20% of circulating lymphocytes in both aged and young adult animals. this change seemed relatively stable, since it was still evident at 99 days postinfection. no significant changes in CD4 CM and EM frequencies in the BAL fluid were detected. aged animals generated a larger proliferative burst than young adult animals. a dramatic increase in Ki67+ T cells was detected in PBMCs from young adult animals at 7 dpi. the onset of the T cell proliferative burst was delayed in aged animals compared to young adults. the overall size of the proliferative burst was measured from the AUC. these differences are best illustrated when considering the total CD4 response against CA04. responses generated by young adult animals were significantly higher than those generated by aged animals at 7 and 14 dpi. however, these data are in line with the delay in T cell proliferation observed in peripheral blood. young adult animals generated a marginally bigger T cell response. aged rhesus macaques generate a more robust humoral response. aged rhesus macaques generate a more robust humoral response. aged animals generated a better primary humoral response following CA04 infection. we measured changes in cytokine concentrations in BAL fluid supernatants collected during acute CA04 infection using a multiplex ELISA. after infection, we did not detect any changes in the levels of IL-17, TNF-, or the IL-12/23p40 common chain. influenza virus infection induces a robust cytokine response in the BAL fluid. no changes in IL-15 (A), IL-1ra (B), IL-8 (D), IL-6 (E), IFN- (F), IFN- (G) and sCD40L (H) were detected. we found 709 genes differentially expressed between young adult and aged macaques. these genes were organized into three clusters on the basis of expression levels. cluster 1 consists of 194 genes that were more highly induced in young adult animals. cluster 3 contains 228 genes that were less downregulated in aged animals after infection. the genes in cluster 1 were mostly associated with nave B cells (P = 1e13) and resting CD8 and CD4 T cells (P = 2e21 and 2e20, respectively) a large number of the genes within cluster 2 are ISGs (P = 4e23); some are associated with activated dendritic cells (DCs; P = 2e42) and differentiating macrophages (P = 2e74). 62 ISGs, including those for classical proinflammatory cytokines, numerous chemokines, and complement genes, were more highly induced in aged than young adult animals. a higher induction of ISGs could explain the increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines seen in BAL fluid supernatants of aged animals. 8 young adult and 8 aged female rhesus macaques were inoculated with a/California/04/2009 (CA04) virus. prior to infection, aged animals had significantly fewer nave T cells and a higher frequency of terminally differentiated (EM) T cells. animals were monitored for signs of clinical disease by visual inspection (rhinorrhea and respiratory rate) viral RNA was detected in nasal swabs at 1 dpi. levels peaking at 2 dpi in both young adult and aged animals. viral genomes ceased to be detected at 21 dpi in both young adult and aged animals. aged animals experienced higher viral loads in the BAL fluid (P = 0.04 for AUC), especially at 7 dpi (P 0.001). these data suggest that CA04 infected both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. the infection resolved with similar kinetics in both young adult and aged animals. there was a dramatic increase in the frequency of CD8 T cells in the BAL fluid. the relative frequency of CD4 T cells decreased to 10%. this change seemed relatively stable, since it was still evident at 99 days postinfection. the overall size of the proliferative burst was measured from the AUC. aged animals generated a larger proliferative burst than young adult animals. a dramatic increase in Ki67+ cells was detected in PBMCs. the onset of the proliferative burst was delayed in aged animals compared to young adults. the overall size of the proliferative burst was measured from the AUC. aged animals generated a bigger CD4 EM cell proliferative burst than young adult animals (CD4 CM cell proliferation was comparable) in the BAL fluid (Fig. 2). however, these data are in line with the delay in T cell proliferation observed in peripheral blood (Fig. 3), suggesting a delay or a defect in generation of effector CD4 T cell function with age. aged rhesus macaques generate a more robust humoral response than young adult animals following pandemic H1N1 virus infection. we measured B cell proliferation (via Ki67 expression) within memory and MZ-like B cells in the BAL fluid. this proliferative burst peaked at 7 dpi. we measured changes in cytokine concentrations in BAL fluid supernatants. after infection, we did not detect any changes in the levels of IL-17, TNF-, or the IL-12/23p40 common chain. in contrast, levels of IL-15, IL-1ra, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-6, and IFN- increased at 4 dpi and returned to baseline at 10 dpi. no changes in IL-17, TNF-, and IL-12/23p40 with influenza virus infection were detected. no changes in IL-17, TNF-, and IL-12/23p40 with influenza virus infection were detected. we first used nonparametric MDS to visualize global changes induced after CA04 infection in aged animals. cluster 3 contains 228 genes that were less downregulated in aged animals after infection. each mRNA sample is represented as a single point colored by the age of the animal and with a different shape according to the time p.i. genes within cluster 1 were induced to a greater extent in young adult than aged animals. upregulation of most of these genes was associated with increased trafficking of T and B cells into the BAL fluid at 4 dpi. expression of some T cell-specific (SIGIRR, AES, APBA2) and B cell-specific (CD22, TSC22D3) genes correlated with changes in the frequency of T and B cells in young adult animals. cluster 2, 62 ISGs, including those for proinflammatory cytokines, numerous chemokines, and complement genes, were more highly induced in aged than young adult animals. most of these genes are known targets of the NF-B transcription factor, which was predicted to be highly activated in aged animals only. the increased activation of the IFN response could be due to the increased viral loads observed in the BAL fluid of aged animals. the outbreak of swine-origin influenza A H1N1 virus in early 2009 highlighted the ability of influenza viruses to recombine, generating new strains that can spread efficiently between humans. only 13% of deaths and 10% of hospitalizations occurred among individuals older than 65 years of age. in cynomolgus macaques infected with r1918 virus, a rebound in viral titer was observed in trachea at 6 and 8 dpi. a recent study in rhesus macaque reported biphasic tracheal viral titers at 12 h and 6 days after H5N1 infection which were associated with a biphasic fever pattern (26) a recent study in humans showed that the frequency of influenza virus-specific CD4 T cells correlated negatively with disease severity. however, the plasma HI titers peaked at 21 dpi, after viral replication ceased in the animals. cytokines play a critical role in the activation of the innate immune response (IFN-) and recruitment of phagocytic cells, notably neutrophils and monocytes (IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1), as well as lymphocytes (MCP-1 and IL-6). increased levels of IL-15 and IFN- in the BAL fluid could also be due to the higher CD8 and CD4 EM T cell proliferation observed in aged animals. early and sustained innate immune responses have also been associated with severe influenza in previous macaque studies. increased induction of NF-B with age was also found in rhesus macaques infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and in that study, this was associated with a greater severity of infection. older individuals generate a broader antibody response with higher avidity than young adults following vaccination (14) or infection (20, 28) with the 2009 H1N1 virus. the improved antibody response is most likely mediated by memory B cells specific for swine-origin influenza A viruses generated during previous exposures."}
