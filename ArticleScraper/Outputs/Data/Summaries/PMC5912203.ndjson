{"summary": "the detection of airborne pathogen inoculum has been improved through the development of quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays that allow for near real-time monitoring of inoculum concentration. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays could be an inexpensive alternative for detection in the field or at remote facilities. traditional LAMP assays produce a magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate when DNA is amplified that can be detected with the human eye. in low concentrations of target DNA, precipitate may be difficult to observe. dyes have the potential to inhibit LAMP reactions or require the use of spectrophotometers. more recently, fungicide applications have been reduced using inoculum detection systems. however, these systems do not provide in-field inoculum concentration for producers. a timely and cost-effective system that improves detection of E. necator inoculum throughout the growing season is needed. rods with one or 10 spores were created by transferring individual spores with eyelash brush. a set of sample rods containing 500 conidia was also generated using the conidial suspension. each reaction contained 14.8 l of Isothermal Master Mix with no dye. internal primers FIP EN and BIP EN (2.4 M), external primers F3 EN and B3 EN (0.24 M), forward loop primer FAM strand (FL-F, 0.08 M), and Quencher strand (Q-strand, 0.08 M) to create a 25 l reaction. a primers and probe from qPCR assay and primers from the LAMP assay were used to develop and test the quantitative LAMP assay. b Primer concentrations in the reaction mix were 2.4 M for FIP and BIP, 0.24 M for F3 and B3, and 0.8 M for Forward loop primer FAM strand and Quencher strand (Q-strand) qLAMP assay to Erysiphe necator as a function of percent amplification (y-axis) and spore + 1 log10 concentrations (x-axis) each point represents the amplification of 10 separate extractions created from different E. necator conidia dilution series (102, 103, and 104 conidia concentrations), one and 10 conidia eyelash transferred spore rods. DNA from collected spore sampler rod pairs was extracted using the powerSoil\u00ae DNA extraction kit. a set of positive control rods containing 500 E. necator conidia was included as an extraction efficiency control. qPCR reactions contained 7.5 l perfeCTa\u00ae qPCR ToughMix\u00ae. custom impaction spore samplers were placed at a research vineyard and six commercial vineyard locations within the Willamette Valley of Oregon. each spore sampler contained a pair of sample rods described above. spore samplers were run continuously, sampling 45 L/min, and sample rods were replaced daily or every Monday and Thursday (bi-weekly) both the L-qLAMP and G-qLAMP detections were evaluated using a 2 2 contingency table whereby the qPCR assay results were assumed correct. both the qLAMP detections were evaluated using a 2 2 contingency table whereby the qPCR assay results were assumed correct. Spore rods were transferred to 2-ml screw-cap tubes containing 200 l of 5% Chelex 100 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) in molecular grade, DEPC-treated water. tubes containing rods were vortexed for 5 s then placed in boiling water for 5 min. samples were centrifuged at 16,000g for 2 min to collect the contents in the tube. reactions were carried out on an ABI StepOne Plus qPCR machine. reactions were 65 \u00b0C for 45 min followed by 80 \u00b0C for 5 min. all reactions were run in triplicate. Melting temperatures for the primers were 59.2 and 59.9 \u00b0C respectively. a log-linear curve is required to describe the assay because LAMP amplification rate is faster than exponential due to concatenation of amplicon. positive control samples were also compared to the standard curve. frozen aliquots of qLAMP master mix were stored in insulated cryoboxes at 20 \u00b0C until reactions were conducted. all reactions were conducted in beta-version smart-DART handheld LAMP reaction devices (Diagenetix, Inc., Honolulu, HI, USA) qPCR reactions were carried out using an ABI StepOne Plus qPCR machine. each reaction plate contained 500 conidia extraction control, 100 and 10,000 conidia positive reaction controls, and template-free negative control. cycle threshold (CT) analysis was conducted using a qPCR machine. paired spore samplers, one for the qPCR assay and one for the qPCR assay, were collected and processed by laboratory personnel on a daily and bi-weekly schedule. Spore samplers for the L-qLAMP and the qPCR assay were deployed on April 15, 2013 and April 14, 2014. 80% of one conidia sample amplified using the qLAMP assay. all other spore quantities tested showed 100% amplification sensitivity. qLAMP standard curve development resulted in a standard curve (R2 = 0.99). qLAMP (gray diamond) and qPCR (black square) assays collected daily (A) and biweekly (B) from the Botany and Plant Pathology Research Farm vineyard (Corvallis, OR) during the 2013 growing season. the qLAMP assay significantly underrepresented spore levels for both the daily collections (P 0.001) and the biweekly collections (P = 0.01) compared to the qPCR assay detection results. qPCRc Fisher\u2019s exact test (Probability)d Positive Negative Laboratory-qLAMPa 2013

proportions of 94%, and true positive proportions of 18% compared to the qPCR detection results. extensive troubleshooting was conducted due to loss of sensitivity of the qLAMP assays to E. necator observed during assay testing in 2014. the concentrations of inhibitor removal compounds within the master mix were assessed, including 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) 40, EDTA, and BSA concentrations. no differences were observed for inhibitor removal compounds within the master mix. qLAMP standard curve development resulted in a standard curve (R2 = 0.99) when fit with a log-linear curve. a log-linear curve was fit to the log spore quantity to account for the number of primers used in the assay. the amplicon produced concatenates resulting in greater than an exponential rate of amplification. the qLAMP quantification was significantly lower than the qPCR daily samples (P 0.001) but the biweekly qLAMP and qPCR sample quantification was not significantly different (P = 0.14). the qLAMP assay significantly underrepresented spore levels for both the daily collections (P 0.001) and the biweekly collections (P = 0.01) compared to the qPCR assay detection results. bability)d

observed during assay testing in 2014, extensive troubleshooting was conducted. qLAMP assay developed was sensitive to E. necator DNA with one spore amplifying 80% (n = 10) using the simplified DNA extraction. the cause for loss of qLAMP sensitivity remains undetermined. the qLAMP assay consistently underrepresented spore quantities later in the growing season compared to the qPCR assay. this may be due to an increase in the presence of PCR inhibitors (such as pollen, humic acids from soil, spider webs, etc.) found in air samples (Wilson, 1997) that may not have been removed by the rapid Chelex DNA extraction. the inhibition of the field qLAMP assay and the difficulty of differentiating low spore quantities indicates that the assay currently has more utility as a qualitative inoculum detection tool. this may be due to difficulty in assessing positive detections from the output of the mobile device. early in the growing season, the weather in the region ischaracterized by frequent precipitation events that limit pollen and insect flight. later in the growing season, pollen, insects, birds, and soil particulates are abundant in the air, and subsequently on the sampling rods. the results from the qLAMP had lower true positive proportions and true negative proportions than that of turbidimetric LAMP previously developed. complex DNA extraction techniques are likely to preclude field implementation of LAMP assays and increase assay costs. qLAMP assay was developed due to reports of high sensitivity and specificity to target DNA, tolerance of the reaction to the presence of reaction inhibitors, and potential for use by growers or crop consultants. qLAMP assay was developed using a simple DNA extraction method for use by growers or crop consultants utilizing inoculum detection. however, the qLAMP assay consistently underrepresented spore quantities later in the growing season compared to the qPCR assay. the cause was not determined during this study. authors
