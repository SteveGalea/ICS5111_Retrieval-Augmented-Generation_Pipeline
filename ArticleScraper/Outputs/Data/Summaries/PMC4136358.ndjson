{"summary": "picornaviruses have naked icosahedrical capsids that encapsulate a single strand of genomic 6,500- to 8,000-nucleotide (nt)-long RNA of positive polarity containing one open reading frame. resulting polyprotein undergoes processing by virus-encoded proteases to generate about a dozen intermediate cleavage products and mature peptides. membranes in infected cells are not dependent on new expression of cellular genes. how these viruses manage to completely overrun the complex cellular control of membrane homeostasis in a matter of hours. the development of membranous replication organelles in poliovirus-infected cells has been extensively studied since electron microscopy (EM) imaging in biology. similar membrane rearrangements are observed in diverse cell types permissive for poliovirus replication (9, 14, 15) similar membrane rearrangements are observed in diverse cell types permissive for poliovirus replication (9, 14, 15) poliovirus replication complexes revealed that they contain markers of virtually all cellular membranous organelles (15) resemblance of picornavirus replication structures to clusters of membranous vesicles suggested that the replication structures may be generated by the membrane-remodeling system of the secretory pathway. vesicular traffic is mediated by COPII and COPI transport carriers at the ER-Golgi complex interface. secretory cargos are synthesized in the ER, exit the ER at ERES in COPII-coated vesicles, and are transported to ERGIC. a COPI-mediated pathway recycles proteins from the Golgi compartment and ERGIC and returns them to the ER. proteins shown to bind to the yeast ortholog of GBF1 are depicted in purple. poliovirus protein is predicted to bind GBF1 based on homology with a plant ortholog. the association of COPI and COPII with replication membranes is a by-product of membrane rearrangement rather than a functional engagement. despite the intuitive appeal of viruses simply \u201chijacking\u201d cellular machineries such as COPI- and COPII-dependent vesicle budding and using them much the same way as a cell does, accruing evidence suggests that viruses utilize some membrane traffic elements for virus-specific functions. sensitivity of poliovirus, CVB3 and a few other related viruses to brefeldin A (BFA) was found to be dependent on GBF1: GBF1 colocalized with the replication complexes of poliovirus and CVB3 (30, 39), and replication of these viruses in the presence of BFA was rescued by the expression of wild-type or BFA-insensitive variants of GBF1 but not BIG1/2. ogenous GBF1 severely inhibited replication of poliovirus and CVB3. recruitment of GBF1 to replication complexes was provided by studies showing active recruitment of GBF1. poliovirus and CVB3 mutants with impaired 3A-GBF1 interactions were much more sensitive to BFA inhibition, more strongly inhibited by siRNA-mediated GBF1 knockdown. a minimal amount of GBF1 associated with the replication membranes (in a 3A-independent manner, such as nonspecific diffusion) may support viral replication in cell culture. the expression of poliovirus proteins in the presence of BFA results in membrane remodeling indistinguishable from that observed in control cells. poliovirus 2C and 3A proteins confer partial resistance to poliovirus and had synergistic effect when combined together in one genome. poliovirus 2C and 3A proteins confer partial resistance to BFA and had synergistic effect when combined together in one genome. the intact N terminus of GBF1 was absolutely required for poliovirus replication. deletion of just 37 amino acids from that part of GBF1 abolished its ability to support viral replication. truncated mutants capable of supporting viral replication were incompetent in cellular functions of GBF1. the functional network of GBF1 in uninfected cells is not the same as the one sufficient to support picornavirus replication. this suggests that looking at \u201cnormal\u201d GBF1 functions might be superfluous for characterizing GBF1 functions within the context of viral infection. a model that considers all available data suggests that the GBF1 interactome might be altered in infected cells. it is likely that such new interactions occur through the N-terminal region of GBF1 required for viral replication. the puzzling division of picornaviruses into those that are strongly dependent on GBF1, like enteroviruses. the role of GBF1 in the replication of other positive-strand RNA viruses, like hepatitis C virus and coronaviruses, also depend on GBF1. the role of GBF1 in the replication of these viruses suggests a conserved core of replication requirements shared by diverse positive-strand RNA viruses. the role of GBF1 in the replication cycle of different viruses is unclear. recruitment of GBF1 to replication complexes is a result of the lack of BIG1/2 recruitment or of other defects in the replication complexes associated with these mutations. the functional role of BIG1/2 in replication is currently unknown. poliovirus and CVB3 mutants with impaired 3A-GBF1 interactions were much more sensitive to BFA inhibition, more strongly inhibited by siRNA-mediated GBF1 knockdown. a minimal amount of GBF1 associated with the replication membranes may be sufficient to support viral replication in cell culture. a requirement for GBF1-dependent Arf activation in virus-induced membrane remodeling is ruled out by the observation that the expression of poliovirus proteins in the presence of BFA results in membrane remodeling indistinguishable from that observed in control cells. a report showing siRNA knockdown of Arf1 being strongly inhibitory for CVB3 replication must be interpreted with caution, since the level of Arf1 protein reduction was modest, 50%. the intact N terminus of GBF1 was absolutely required for poliovirus replication. deletion of just 37 amino acids from that part of GBF1 completely abolished its ability to support viral replication. this suggests membrane-bound GBF1 plays an essential role in virus-encoding processes. the functional network of GBF1 in uninfected cells is not the same as the one sufficient to support picornavirus replication. this suggests that looking at \u201cnormal\u201d GBF1 functions might be superfluous for characterizing GBF1 functions within the context of viral infection. a model that considers all available data suggests that the GBF1 interactome might be altered in infected cells. it is likely that such new interactions occur through the N-terminal region of GBF1 required for viral replication. this suggests that the virus destroys important interactors of GBF1 to extract the protein from its normal cellular network and make it available for virally encoded functions. use significantly different strategies for replication or whether cardioviruses substitute a GBF1-provided function with some other mechanism. Is GBF1 function in the replication of these viruses analogous to its role in enterovirus replication. is GBF1 supporting different steps in the replication cycle of different viruses? recruitment of BIG1/2 correlates with efficient viral replication. however, the functional role of BIG1/2 in replication is currently unknown. recruitment of PI4KIII to replication complexes is significantly enriched. the first model suggests that recruitment of PI4KIII to replication complexes may be mediated by activated Arf1. PI4KIII is a known Arf1 effector (71), and its redistribution to replication membranes is dependent on the expression of enterovirus protein 3A. a second model is based on the finding that individually expressed 3A proteins from as diverse picornaviruses. a 3A mutant that lost its ability to bind GBF1 was able to recruit PI4KIII normally in ACBD3-depleted cells and in an in vitro assay (46). PI4KIII and PtdIns(4)P lipid are detrimental to the replication of diverse picornaviruses (8, 53, 72, 75, 76) poliovirus and CVB3 mutants selected in the presence of PI4KIII-inhibitng compounds invariably have single-point mutations in the 3A protein but never in the 3D polymerase. poliovirus and CVB3 mutants selected in the presence of PI4KIII-inhibitng compounds invariably have single-point mutations in the 3A protein but never in the 3D polymerase. the ease of emergence of mutants resistant to PI4KIII or GBF1 inhibitors (77, 80, 82, 83) raises an important question of how a requirement for presumably indispensable activities of cellular factors can be overcome by a single-amino-acid change in a viral protein. this would explain the strong effect of compounds like BFA or PI4KIII inhibitors on the replication of wild-type viruses. OSBP-1 and OSBP-2 are members of a multigene protein family. enviroxime-like compounds are presumed to act by directly inhibiting PI4KIII (77) OSBP localizes to the ER via its FFAT domain interacting with the integral ER proteins VAP-A and VAP-B. recruitment of PI4KIII to replication complexes may be mediated by activated Arf1. PI4KIII is a known Arf1 effector (71) and its redistribution to replication membranes is dependent on the expression of enterovirus protein 3A. recruitment of PI4KIII to replication complexes may exert an antiviral effect in the case of poliovirus infection. recruitment of ACBD3 to replication complexes may exert an antiviral effect in the case of poliovirus infection. PI4KIII may interact with poliovirus protein 2BC in a mammalian two-hybrid system. the expression of a dominant negative mutant of the kinase, or the expression of SacI phosphatase, resulted in a noticeable inhibition of viral replication (8). further support for the importance of the enzymatic activity of PI4KIII for picornavirus replication came from the observations that other compounds inhibiting this enzyme have a strong antiviral effect (76, 77) virus replication to PI4KIII inhibitors was described. one in the hydrophobic, membrane-interacting domain and two in the cytosolic part of 3A (77, 80) the lack of PI4KIII dependence did not decrease replication fitness in cell culture. mutation in the 3A protein rescues viral replication in their presence in picornaviruses resistant to enviroxime was earlier described (77, 80, 82, 83) oxysterol binding proteins 1 and 2 (OSBP) were designated minor enviroxime-like compounds. OSBP localizes to the ER via its FFAT domain interacting with the integral ER proteins VAP-A and VAP-B (85). siRNA knockdown of OSBP in HEK 293 cells made replication more sensitive to minor enviroxime-like compounds. short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of OSBP expression in HeLa cells seemed to noticeably inhibit poliovirus propagation. compensatory mechanisms exist to protect cells from the loss of a single OSBP protein. long-chain fatty acids can freely diffuse through the plasma membrane. acyl-CoAs serve as acyl donors for downstream metabolic processes. recent findings reveal rapid activation of cellular long-chain acyl-CoA-synthesizing activity. in picornavirus-infected cells, the import of long-chain fatty acids is highly activated, but triglyceride synthesis is inhibited. the activation of fatty acid import in poliovirus-infected cells requires the viral protease 2A. a similar stimulation of fatty acid import was observed in different cell types infected with diverse picornaviruses. the increased supply of long-chain acyl-CoAs in infected cells would result in the accumulation of diacylglycerol. however, due to inhibited triglyceride synthesis in infected cells, diacylglycerol would be consumed in increased production of phosphatidylcholine. the initial emergence of poliovirus-specific membranous structures is associated with the Golgi complex. in uninfected cells, cholesterol is concentrated mostly on the plasma membrane. the development of the CVB3 replication organelles activates reverse trafficking of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the replication structures. the intracellular esterified cholesterol stored in lipid droplets apparently is not easily accessible during infection, confirming that metabolism of neutral lipids is severely compromised. it is unclear whether the imported or endogenously generated fatty acids represent the major source of building blocks for infection-specific phospholipid synthesis. the importance of the imported fatty acids for the development of poliovirus replication membranes is indicated by experiments showing that providing the infected cells with an excess of oleic acid results in inhibition of the viral replication concomitant. a similar stimulation of fatty acid import was observed in different cell types infected with diverse picornaviruses. the detailed mechanism of activation of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases and inhibition of triglyceride synthesis seems to be key steps sufficient to activate infection-specific phospholipid production. aqueous cytoplasmic environment, new membranes would spontaneously assemble into characteristic convoluted tubular structures typical of the replication organelles (5, 7, 11), similar to the growth of myelin figures (106), without the requirement for additional input from another membrane-shaping mechanism(s). a rerouting of lipid biosynthetic pathways would disturb normal lipid homeostasis and likely induce activation of compensatory regulatory networks. picornaviruses are believed to have emerged before the diversification of eukaryotes (108) they apparently perfected the usurping of key elements of membrane metabolism to induce the rearrangement of self-organizing host modules. we still cannot answer the fundamental questions of why positive-strand RNA viruses use membranes for replication. the role of sphingolipid metabolism in picornavirus replication is not known at all. the association of early replication sites with Golgi membranes (7\u20139) indicates that we may be missing key components that shape the structure and function of replication organelles."}
