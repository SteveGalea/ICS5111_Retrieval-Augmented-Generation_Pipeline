{"summary": "we randomized 600 students into 4 treatment arms: 1) vitamin D3 and gargling, 2) placebo and gargling, 3) vitamin D3 and no gargling, and 4) placebo and no gargling. results Of 600 participants, 471 (78.5%) completed all surveys while 43 (77.2%) completed none; 150 (25.0%) reported clinical URTI respectively. vitamin D3 significantly reduced the risk of laboratory confirmed URTI. results suggest vitamin D3 is a promising intervention for the prevention of URTI. participants were enrolled during the first two weeks of September 2010 or 2011. they were followed to the end of October 2010 or 2011 respectively. individuals were eligible for the study if they were enrolled at McMaster University. study was double-blind with respect to the vitamin D3/placebo intervention. participants randomized to the gargling were not blinded. all other participants and study personnel remained blinded. students were asked to immediately electronically report the onset of a \u201ccold\u201d and the weekly survey asked participants if they considered themselves to be sick. participants were asked about the frequency of hand washing before meals, average weekly hours of exercise, average hours of sleep per night, current vitamin supplement use and gargling habits. Statistical analysis We aimed to recruit 600 unique participants to ensure greater than 80% power to detect a 25% reduction (from 50% to 37.5%) in the proportion of students with URTI. this study was powered to detect main effects and was underpowered to definitively investigate interactions. participants were enrolled during the first two weeks of September 2010 or 2011. they were followed to the end of October 2010 or 2011 respectively. individuals were eligible for the study if they were enrolled at McMaster University. participants were randomized to receive a container with eight capsules of either 10,000 IU of active vitamin D3 or identical placebo. participants were instructed to take one pill weekly and received a weekly email reminder. all participants received general lifestyle and health advice about the benefits of appropriate sleep, nutrition, hand hygiene, and exercise. self-reported and adjudicated episodes of clinical URTI were considered \u2018events\u2019 if the onset occurred at least seven days after the participant\u2019s randomization date. secondary outcomes included laboratory confirmed illness, viral load, and symptom duration and severity. this study was powered to detect main effects and was underpowered to definitively investigate interactions. poisson regression with robust standard errors was chosen in place of model based standard errors which are typically too large [27]. 60% were first or second year undergraduate students, and 64% were female. Flow diagram of participant randomization and follow-up during the McFLu2 COLD3 Prevention Trial, Hamilton, Canada, 2010 and 2011. a total of 150 individuals experienced symptomatic (clinical) URTI. laboratory confirmation data was available for 492 (82%) and 489 (81.5%) participants. fewer participants randomized to receive vitamin D3 reported a clinical URTI than those randomized to receive placebo. \u20acViral load, mean (SD) 5.51 (1.6) 6.40 (1.2) 0.036 Symptom duration, mean days, (SD) 6.0 (1.6) 6.2 (1.3) *HR: 1.32 (0.59-2.90) 0.49 5.8 (1.5) 6.2 (1.2) clinical URTI laboratory confirmed URTI Gargling (n = 256) Control (n = 236) Effect measure (95% CI) P value Gargling (n = 254) Control (n = 235) Effect measure (95% CI) P value Imputed URTI episodes, No. (%) 106 (35.3) 100 (33.3) *RR: 1.1 (0.78-1.44) 0.69 Complete case URTI episodes, No. (%) 85 (33.2) 65 (27.5) *RR: the mean viral load in the vitamin D3 group was lower compared to those in the placebo group. the mean viral load in those assigned to the gargle group was 6.24 log10 viral copies/mL compared to 5.95 log10 viral copies/mL in the control group. the mean viral load in those assigned to the gargle group was 6.24 log10 viral copies/mL. participants Six hundred ninety-eight prospective participants provided written consent. 600 completed the baseline survey, provided a nasal swab and were randomized into the study. median age of participants was 19 years, 60% were first or second year undergraduate students, and 64% were female. a total of 150 individuals experienced symptomatic (clinical) URTI. laboratory testing identified viral pathogens in 70 infections. rhinovirus is the predominant viral pathogen (61 cases), six cases of enterovirus and one case of coronavirus NL63. placebo participants reported clinical URTI compared to 65 (27.5%) participants not assigned to gargle. n = 53 in each of the vitamin D and placebo groups respectively. three (13.0%) participants assigned to gargle had a laboratory confirmed URTI compared to 37 (18.7%) participants randomized to the control arm. but this was not a statistically significant difference. a total of 150 individuals experienced symptomatic (clinical) URTI with 106 episodes self-reported and 44 episodes established through adjudication. fewer participants randomized to receive vitamin D3 reported a clinical URTI than those randomized to receive placebo (80 or 34%) effect measure (95% CI) P value Imputed URTI episodes, No. (%) 91 (30.3) 114 (38.0) *RR:0.80 (0.63-1.02) 0.08 Complete case URTI episodes, No. (%) 70 (27.1) 80 (34.2) *RR:0.79 (0.61-1.03) 0.09 26 (10.2) 44 (18.9) *RR:0.54 (0.34-0.84) 0.007 \u20acViral load, mean (SD) 5.51 (1.6) 6. three (13.0%) participants assigned to gargle had a laboratory confirmed URTI compared to 37 (18.7%) participants randomized to the control arm. but this was not a statistically significant difference. for clinical URTI, n = 55 and n = 51 in the gargling and control groups respectively. the mean viral load in the vitamin D3 group was lower compared to those in the placebo group. the mean viral load in those assigned to the gargle group was 6.24 log10 viral copies/mL compared to 5.95 log10 viral copies/mL in the control group. clinical and laboratory confirmed URTI (218.6 versus 199.8 and 229.7 versus 181.5, respectively) but the difference was not statistically significant. vitamin D supplementation was associated with a statistically significant 46% risk reduction of clinical URTI. si and colleagues randomized 164 men to 400 IU vitamin D3 or placebo daily from October through March. the proportion of men who did not experience a URTI was significantly greater in the intervention group (51.3%) than in the control group (35.7%). the study recorded 593 and 611 URTI episodes in the vitamin D3 and control groups respectively. research has shown that vitamin D plays a role in the innate immune response by stimulating the production of antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and cathelicidins. we hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation might reduce the amount of virus in infected persons. this definition captured episodes attributable to allergies or other causes. it is possible that this definition captured episodes attributable to allergies or other causes. this would contribute to larger variance in the estimates and uncertainty surrounding our results. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
