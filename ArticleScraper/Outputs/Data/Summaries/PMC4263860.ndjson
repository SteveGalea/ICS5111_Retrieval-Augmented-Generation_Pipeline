{"summary": "mammalian aminopeptidase N (APN), also called CD13, is a tumor marker that is overly expressed on the cell surface of almost all major tumor forms. as a zinc-dependent aminopeptidase, APN cleaves the N-terminal neutral residue off physiological peptides and functions ubiquitously in various peptide metabolism pathways. however, tumor cell surface APN also mediates tumor cell motility and serves as a tumor-homing receptor. the pAPN ectodomain has a seahorse-like shape, with four distinct domains: head, side, body, and tail. pAPN forms a homodimer through interactions between the head domains. the catalytic site contains a tightly chelated zinc, a zinc-activated catalytic water that attacks and breaks scissile peptide bond of peptide substrates. view of pAPN-CNGRCG is obtained by rotating the view in A. it is obtained by rotating the view in A first by 90\u00b0 along a vertical axis. enlarged view of CNGRCG in the active site of pAPN. the concept of tumor-homing therapy is to link anti-tumor drugs to a tumor-homing peptide. the latter specifically recognizes a receptor that is uniquely or overly expressed on tumor cell surfaces. integrins are receptors for tumor-homing peptides containing an RGD motif. pAPN containing an N-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and a C-terminal His6 tag was cloned into pFastbac1 vector. pAPN containing the E384Q mutation was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis, and it was expressed and purified in the same way as the wild type pAPN. gene encodes residues 1\u2013275 (including the free N terminus and domains 1\u20135) was synthesized commercially (Genscript) different fibronectin domains with a C-terminal His6 tag were cloned into vector pET42b(+) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Invitrogen) CNGRCG (AnaSpec), 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 25% (v/v) PEG3350, 200 mm Li2SO4 and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.2.

Error bars indicate S.E. (two-tailed t test; ***, p 0.001; n = 3). we further investigated interactions between APN and fibronectin. mutations in the NGR motif significantly decreased binding affinity between pAPN and the fibronectin NGR domain. a catalytically inactive mutant pAPN containing an E384Q mutation in the catalytic site bound the fibronectin NGR domain in the same way as the wild type pAPN did. this suggests that APN specifically binds the NGR motif of ECM proteins. the AlphaScreen signal measured between pAPN and fibronectin domains 1\u20135 with the N terminus of GST was taken as 100%. interactions between pAPN and fibronectin domains 4\u20135 fused to the N terminus of GST. the conformation of the fibronectin NGR loop depends on the tertiary structure of fibronectin, including the inter-domain interactions between domain 5 and domain 4. however, comparison of the structural conformation of the fibronectin NGR loop to that of APN-bound CNGRCG shows that the two NGR loops share similar structural conformations, suggesting that APN interacts with the fibronectin NGR motif and the tumor-homing NGR peptide. two cleavage products (molecular mass of 9 and 2 kDa) would be detected on SDS-PAGE of the reaction mixture. pAPN did not cleave the NGR motif in the fibronectin NGR domain. pAPN was previously crystallized in a closed and catalytically active conformation. structure of the complex was refined at 1.95 resolution (Table 1). data collection and refinement statistics pAPN-CNGRCG complex Data Collection Space group C2 Cell dimensions a, b, c () 260.3, 62.9, 82.0, (\u00b0) 90, 100.6, 90 Resolution () 50-1.92 (1.96-1.92)a Rsym or Rmerge 0.079 (0.615) I/I 20.7 (1.7) Completeness (%) 97.9 (97.0) Red pAPN residue His-383 forms five water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the side chains of pAPN residues Glu-413, Ser-410, and Glu-384. the side chain of the arginine in the NGR loop forms a hydrophobic interaction with pAPN residue Ala-346. glycine in the NGR loop has no direct contact with pAPN, but its conformational flexibility is critical for the formation of the NGR loop. mutant pAPN-polyalanine complex has catalytically inactive conformation. mutant peptides were fused to a C-terminal GST tag. mutant peptides were fused to a c-terminal GST tag. mutations of each of the flanking cysteines in CNGRCG to a glycine significantly weakened APN binding. soaking the peptide into pAPN crystals did not yield any clear electron density of the peptide, consistent with the weak APN binding by GNGRG. CNGRCG was soaked into catalytically active pAPN crystals. electron density revealed that CNGRCG remained uncleaved in the crystals. this suggests that CNGRCG is a much poorer substrate than polyalanine for APN. the electron density map corresponds to the Fo Fc omit map calculated in the absence of the uncleaved polyalanine and contoured at 2.0. glu-384 from wild type pAPN (PDB code 4FKE) was grafted here to illustrate the catalytic mechanism of pAPN. pAPN specifically binds fibronectin and laminin, both of which contain NGR motifs, but not type IV collagen that does not contain any NGR motif. the results suggest that APN specifically interacts with ECM proteins containing NGR motifs, contributing to the APN-mediated cell motility. ility by anti-APN or anti-integrin antibody was taken as 100%. transwell migration assay showed the inhibition of HT-1080 cell motility by anti-APN antibody. the results from the AlphaScreen assay showed that pAPN has significantly higher affinity for the NGR domain than for the exposed N terminus of fibronectin. pAPN has significantly higher affinity for the NGR domain than for the exposed N terminus of fibronectin or laminin. the E384Q mutation at the pAPN active site did not have a significant effect on the binding of pAPN to the fibronectin NGR domain or any of the active site inhibitors. these results suggest that APN specifically binds the NGR motif of ECM proteins and that the binding site for the NGR motif of ECM proteins is located at the APN active site. pAPN and fibronectin NGR domain in the absence of any inhibitor were used as the standard and taken as 100%. the NGR motif of fibronectin shares similar structural conformations with the NGR motif in the APN-bound tumor-homing peptide. structure of fibronectin NGR domain (domain 5; in magenta) is stabilized by inter-domain interactions with its neighboring domain (PDB code 1FBR) also shown is the superposition of the NGR motifs in fibronectin domain 5 (in magenta) and in the tumor-homing peptide CNGRCG (in green) pAPN and human APN share high sequence homology, with catalytic residues 100% conserved between the two proteins. pAPN was expressed, purified, and crystallized as described previously for other APN-binding ligands. the structure of the complex was refined at 1.95 resolution (Table 1). the CNGRCG tumor-homing peptide binds to the catalytic site of pAPN (Fig. 1, C and D) the two cysteines in CNGRCG form a disulfide bond. glycine in the NGR loop makes sequence-specific interactions with the pAPN active site through the side chains of asparagine and arginine. pAPN-bound polyalanine peptide is expected to interact with both APNs in the same way. pAPN residues are in magenta, and CNGRCG is in green. pAPN residues are in magenta, and CNGRCG is in green. GRCG with pAPN was used as the standard and taken as 100%. the catalytic activity of pAPN on ala-p-nitroanilide in the absence of any inhibitor was taken as 100%. the pAPN-CNGRCG tumor-homing peptide resists enzymatic degradation by pAPN. electron density showed a broken scissile peptide bond and hence a degraded polyalanine. CNGRCG is a much poorer substrate than polyalanine for APN. CNGRCG is too far away from Glu-384 to accept the transferring proton. CNGRCG can serve as an efficient and stable tumor-homing peptide by targeting tumor cell surface APN without being turned over immediately during the tumor-homing process. wild type pAPN (PDB code 4FKE) was grafted here to illustrate the catalytic mechanism of pAPN. red arrow indicates the potential attack of the scissile peptide bond by the catalytic water at the pAPN-active site. pAPN specifically binds fibronectin and laminin, both of which contain NGR motifs. pAPN specifically binds fibronectin and laminin, both of which contain NGR motifs. these interactions were significantly inhibited by anti-APN antibody. his6-tagged pAPN was detected by anti-His6 antibody. Error bars indicate S.E. a catalytically inactive mutant pAPN containing an E384Q mutation in the catalytic site bound the fibronectin NGR domain in the same way as the wild type pAPN did. the binding site for the NGR motif of ECM proteins is located at the APN active site. AlphaScreen signal measured between pAPN and fibronectin domains 4\u20135 with the N terminus of GST was taken as 100%. interactions between pAPN and fibronectin NGR domain (domains 4\u20135) without any mutation was taken as 100%. the conformation of the fibronectin NGR loop depends on the tertiary structure of fibronectin, including the inter-domain interactions between domain 5 and domain 4. however, comparison of the structural conformation of the fibronectin NGR loop to that of APN-bound CNGRCG shows that the two NGR loops share similar structural conformations, suggesting that APN interacts with the fibronectin NGR motif. two cleavage products (molecular mass of 9 and 2 kDa) would be detected on SDS-PAGE. this was not supported by SDS-PAGE. pAPN did not cleave the NGR motif in the fibronectin NGR domain. the structural information provided in this study can guide the design and development of tumor-homing peptides that efficiently target tumor cell surface APN and inhibitors that effectively block APN-mediated tumor cell motility and metastasis. the implications of our findings go beyond APN-based tumor cell motility and tumor-homing therapy. both APN and integrins relay signal transduction between cells and the extracellular environment. integrins serve as functional receptors for tumor-homing peptides that contain NGR and RGD motifs."}
