{"summary": "measles virus (MeV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. it is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, genus Morbillivirus. the virus initiates infection in the respiratory tract by infecting resident immune cells expressing the receptor signaling lymphocytic activation molecule. the same common acute MeV strain that, from a single point of entry, invades and progressively disseminates throughout the brain. the virus that is present at the onset of SSPE symptoms, however, differ substantially from the original MeV strain and is referred to as mutant or SSPE virus. the SMa79 MeV-H clone had a series of amino acid changes that differed from the consensus sequence (Z80828.1) at several positions: D14G, I65T, L233I, E492G, and D574N (Table 2). Characteristics of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cases. the predicted MeV-H amino acid sequence of the 2 SSPE cases belong to genotype F (SMa79 and SMa94) is extended by 4 amino acids. only MeV-H of SMa79 could be detected on Western blotting. SMa84 patients were treated with or without PNGase F before they were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. meV-H genotype C1 lacks a potential N-linked glycosylation site (PNGS) at N200 and shows a downward band shift compared with MeV-H genotype A and F (SMa94) proteins. meV-H protein surface expression was detected with anti-MeV-H BH026 antibody followed by goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 594. the amino acid sequence of MeV-H from SMa84 predicts the lack of an N-linked carbohydrate at N200, because of an N200D point mutation. this results confirm that an N-glycan moiety is absent in the MeV-H of genotype C1 (SMa84). the precise biochemical aberration causing a lower molecular weight for SMa79 is currently unknown. glycan processing has been correlated with MeV-H dimer formation. meV-H SMa84 was almost exclusively present as monomers. syncytia was detected in vero cells expressing human SLAM. syncytia were observed in CHO cells expressing the MeV receptors. syncytium-forming activity for SMa94 was greater in a SLAM-dependent manner. syncytium-forming activity for SMa94 was greater in a SLAM-dependent manner. soluble protein fragments of SLAM and nectin-4 were produced having their respective whole extracellular domains. the IgG1-Fc region fused to the receptors was used for purification via protein G, which facilitated detection of the protein bound to the plastic-coated MeV-H. a low-binding-affinity group comprising genotypes F (SMa94) and B3.1 was identified. the other MeV-H from genotype F, SMa79, showed only residual binding to nectin-4. the other MeV-H from genotype F, SMa79, showed only residual binding to nectin-4. viruses encoding MeV-H from SSPE SMa79 and SMa84 showed better syncytium-inducing capacity (P.005 and P.05, respectively) differences were only significant when other wild-type genotypes were excluded from the analysis. anti-cytoplasmic tail-specific antibodies are used but not when antibodies against the variable MeV-H globular are used. a slight decrease in the band corresponding to the green fluorescent protein transgene, which is located upstream of the meV-N cistron, was observed for the SSPE SMa79 virus. mAbs with recombinant MeV containing meV-H genes of genotype A (Moraten vaccine strain), H1 (wild-type), C1 (SSPE case SMa84) and F (SSPE cases SMa79 and SMa94) neutralized all recombinant MeVs tested; neutralization potency was greatest at site III. anti-MeV mAb encoding different MeV-H proteins. antibodies BH097 (antigenic site IIa) and cl55 (antigenic site III) were used as controls for neutralization. Glycans (light pink spheres) attached to N168, N187, N200, N215, and N416 were modeled on the MeV-H structure using GlyProt (www.glycosciences.de) antigenic sites displayed on the surface are color-coded. mAbs BH015 and BH130 also failed to neutralize genotypes B3.1, D4.1, D4.2, D7, D8, D9, and H1. mAbs BH015 and BH130 also failed to neutralize genotypes B3.1, D4.1, D4.2, D7, D8, D9, and H1. no differences in neutralization sensitivity were observed with the nearby-located antigenic site IIb-targeting antibody BH125. this result broadens our previous finding in which some genotypes might show enhanced sensitivity to neutralization by antigenic site IIa-targeting mAbs via point mutations at amino acid 492. a correlation between disease time course for SSPE and antigenic mutability cannot be drawn from these neutralization assay results. anti-MeV-H polyclonal antibodies present in meV-H genotype A\u2013immunized mice were used for the assay. the antibody titer is standardized to mIU/mL according to the 3rd International Standard for Anti-Measles. ngth of clinical symptoms 17 years 3 months 3.5 years Measles virus genotype F F C1 Table 2. only amino acids that differ from those in the Moraten vaccine strain are shown. the predicted MeV-H amino acid sequence of the 2 SSPE cases belongs to genotype F (SMa79 and SMa94) is extended by 4 amino acids. MeV-H from SMa79 has 3 mutations in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (I8T, F11L, and D14G) anti-MeV-H globular head BH195 antibody revealed a similar downward band shift regardless of the presence of N-linked glycans. no changes in electrophoretic mobility were observed for the F180S/L181P mutant. an F180S point mutation in this MeV-H SMa84 creates a PNGS at N178 (178NQFNQS), although its potential usage was not predicted by the NetNGlyc 1.0 server. we investigated the glycosylation status of MeV-H SMa84 by peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) treatment, which releases asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. a distinct double band in the MeV-H D416N mutant was observed after PNGase F treatment (apparent molecular masses of 59.3 and 61.3 kDa) this higher-molecular-weight band most likely corresponds to a partially deglycosylated form. cotransfection of expression plasmids for MeV-H and the MeV envelope fusion glycoprotein (MeV-F) genes results in cell fusion visualized as syncytia. only meV-H genotype A induced syncytia in vero cells. syncytia were observed in CHO cells expressing CD46 only when MeV-H genotype A was used. syncytium-forming activity for MeV-H SMa94 was greater in a SLAM-dependent manner. syncytium-forming activity for MeV-H SMa94 was greater in a SLAM-dependent manner. protein-G\u2013purified soluble MeV receptor-Fcs were separated by SDS-PAGE. Binding was monitored by optical density (OD) only at concentrations higher than 2,000 nM were binding values indistinguishable among the MeV-H forms tested. recombinant Moraten viruses were built and rescued in which the MeV-H gene was replaced with that from the SSPE cases. we also used recombinant Moraten viruses encoding the genotype-specific MeV-H genes we have previously described. syncytia size was measured 24 hours post transfection. differences in syncytia formation were significant between MeV-H from SSPE cases and genotype A when other wild-type genotypes were excluded from the analysis. meV-H expression was apparently increased in the latter virus, together with the SSPE SMa94 virus, when the anti-MeV globular head mAb BH195 was used instead. a panel of anti-MeV-H neutralizing antibodies covered most of the immunogenic epitopes. l55, BH067, and BH026) neutralized all recombinant MeVs tested. all antigenic sites had characteristic dose-response curve slopes. mAb cl55 neutralized genotype H1, mAbs BH216, 8905, and I-44 did not. mAbs BH130, BH030, BH097, and BH125 were used as controls for neutralization. mAbs BH130, BH030, BH097, and BH125 were neutralized against different MeV mutants. mAbs BH015 and BH130 also failed to neutralize genotypes B3.1, D4.1, D4.2, D7, D8, D9, and H1. mAbs BH015 and BH130 also failed to neutralize genotypes B3.1, D4.1, D4.2, D7, D8, D9, and H1. mAb BH015 and BH130 target the same, yet new, antigenic site. the single-point mutations N282H, N282K, and D283G are present in genotypes D9, H1 and B3.1/F. mAbs previously used were derived from mice; thus, we used polyclonal anti-MeV-H mouse sera induced by vaccination with an adenovirus encoding the genotype A strain of MeV-H. the results showed that no recombinant MeV escaped a polyclonal anti-MeV-H response. antigenic change does not occur over the disease course and is not a risk factor for SSPE. the conclusions are based on the following experimental evidence. first, we demonstrated that the MeV-H obtained by direct sequencing of brain autopsy material is functional despite extensive amino acid substitutions and produces cell-to-cell fusion. this is the first MeV generated by reverse genetics with the MeV-H gene from brain autopsy samples. different recombinant and pseudotyped viruses expressing SSPE glycoproteins have been produced [44\u201346], but the \u201cSSPE strains\u201d were passaged in vero cells (CD46+, SLAM, nectin-4), which may have altered viral tropism. syncytia formation positively correlates with receptor binding affinity [53,54] of interest, MeV genotype B3.1 has been reported to be more pathogenic than genotype C2 [55]. syncytia formation positively correlates with receptor binding affinity [53,54] wild-type MeV genotypes may be even more resistant to neutralization by mAbs than SSPE viruses. a structural change in MeV-H in the context of the trimeric protein complex MeV-H, MeV-F, and MeV matrix protein does not explain our results. changes in residues P397 and N405 instead may alter specific epitopes within the noose antigenic site rather than the whole MeV-H structure. a slight decrease in sensitivity of SMa79 despite being neutralized by all mAbs tested. the disruption in the structure of the noose antigenic site in SMa84 apparently had the same effect in polyclonal-mediated neutralization. CHO cells stably expressing human SLAM [38] and CHO cells stably expressing human nectin-4 [70] were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, and 0.5 mg/mL G418. all cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. two to 3 days after infection, cells were harvested and viral particles were released by 3 freeze-thaw cycles. pCG plasmids encoding MeV-F and the indicated MeV-H mutants or pCG-MeV-H alone (2 g) were seeded onto 6-well plates. fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis Expi293 cells (2.5106) were transfected using ExpiFectamine 293 (Gibco) at 72 h post transfection, cells were washed with cold Opti-MEM and resuspended in same medium. after 3 washes with Opti-MEM, cells were incubated for an additional hour with goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) cross-ad membrane washed 3 times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 before incubation for 1 h at room temperature. membranes were revealed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher) proteins secreted to culture supernatants were purified by affinity chromatography. stepwise elution was performed with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized with 1M Na2PO4, pH 9.0 (1:10) protein size and purity was evaluated by reducing SDS-PAGE analysis. anti-MeV-H antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold in Opti MEM and incubated with an equal volume of virus diluted to 90\u2013120 PFU per 150 L. after 90 min of infection, DMEM-5% F. the number of enhanced green fluorescent protein\u2013expressing syncytia/well was counted using a fluorescence microscope. one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey multiple comparisons was used to compare multiple groups. CHO cells and CHO-CD46 cells were grown in RPMI 1640. gene was easily exchanged via unique PacI and SpeI sites in pCG-MeV-H plasmids. recombinant viruses were rescued using standard protocols. V-H alone (2 g) were diluted in 100 L of OptiMEM (ThermoFisher) onto a 96-well plate. another 100 L of OptiMEM containing 6 L of Fugene HD (Promega) was then added to each well. aliquots were kept at 20\u00b0C if not used immediately. the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk/tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. the membrane washed 3 times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 before incubation for 1 h at room temperature. the membranes were revealed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher) blot stripping was performed with the manufacturer's instructions. soluble ectodomains of SLAM (residues 21\u2013237) and nectin-4 (residues 32\u2013349) were amplified. precoated microtiter 96-well plates were incubated with 100 L of supernatant containing MeV-H for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. plates were washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) plates were read at an optical density of 490 nm using an Infinite M200 PRO multimode microplate reader (Tecan) BH047, BH059, BH129 [75,77], BH026, BH067, BH125, BH015 [78]; cl55 [80], cl55 [81], cl55 [81], cl55 [81], cl55 [26,80] and mAb8905 [29] Neutralization assays were performed in quadruplicate. the number of infected green fluorescent protein\u2013expressing foci per well was counted 2 days post infection. the number of infected green fluorescent protein\u2013expressing foci per well was counted as a percentage of the number of infected foci."}
