{"summary": "1,153 EV-D68 cases in 49 states were confirmed by CDC. from mid-August 2014 to January 15, 2015, 1,153 EV-D68 cases in 49 states were confirmed by CDC. EV-D68 shares biological characteristics with rhinoviruses such as improved growth at low temperatures. the connection between EV-D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis remains unclear. it is difficult to know the true burden of disease related to EV-D68. the reported incidence of infection is likely an underestimation of the true incidence. PHOL has had the capacity to test respiratory specimens for EV-D68 since September 24, 2014. primary specimens underwent total nucleic acid extraction using the bioM\u00e9rieux NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u00ae protocol. all positive specimens were subjected to a semi-nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the 5\u2019NTR region. multiplex PCR (Seeplex1 RV, Seeplex1 RV15 ACE; Seegene, USA) were used to test for adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza and RSV. a total of 907 patients tested for EV-D68 at PHOL. the date for which the first EV-D68 positive specimen from a case was collected was September 4th, 2014. the specimen collection date for the greatest number of cases and highest test positivity was 18/35 (51.4%) cases. after September 16th, the number of EV-D68 cases begins to decline. the median age of patients tested (686/907; 75.6%) were less than 10 years old. more than half of patients tested (686/907; 75.6%) were less than 10 years old. most patients (710/880; 80.6%) were hospitalized and (12/880; 1.4%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) the remainder of patients were either seen in a community physician\u2019s office (140/880;15.9%), in the emergency department (14/880; 1.6%) or in an institution (4/880;0.2%). cases were more likely to be identified in September than October. the greatest number of patients tested for EV-D68 resided in south western Ontario. city of Toronto was the health unit of residence for 26/153 (17%) of cases. nasopharyngeal swab, respiratory aspirate, throat swab or nasal swab were tested. EV-D68 was not detected in any of the five cerebrospinal fluid specimens submitted for testing. 154 EV-D68 positive specimens were also tested by viral culture. of 89 EV-D68 positive specimens tested by MRVP, 29 (32.6%) specimens were classified as rhinovirus, 1(1.1%) specimen as rhino and enterovirus, 3(3.4%) specimens as rhino and parainfluenza 4 virus, 1(1.1%) specimen as parainfluenza and 1(1.1%) specimen as adenovirus. Variables category EV-D68 Negative Crude OR(95% CI)n = 907 Adjusted OR(95% CI)n = 904 Counts (%)n = 754 Age group (in years) 20+ 7 (4.6) 1.00 1.00 0\u20134 75 (49) 447 (59.3) 2.92 (1.31\u20136.50)* 2.61(1.02\u20136.70)* 5\u20139 50 (32.6) 114 (15.2) 7.64 (3.32 the median age of patients tested was 3 years (range 3 weeks to 94 years) more than half of patients tested (686/907; 75.6%) were less than 10 years old. cases were more likely than controls to be less than 20 years of age. cases were more likely to report at least one symptom (75.8% versus 67.1%, respectively; p-value 0.05) in comparison to controls, undefined respiratory symptoms were reported more frequently in cases than controls. cases were more likely to be identified in September than October. in proportion to each health unit\u2019s population in Ontario, the highest incidence rate was observed in CHK with 9.1 cases per 100, 000 population followed by WEC with 5 cases per 100,000 population. however, both health units tested more specimens relative to their proportion of Ontario\u2019s population. 155 EV-D68 positive specimens submitted for testing included poorly defined specimen types. 154 were also tested by viral culture and / MRVP as per routine laboratory testing at PHOL. of 148 specimens tested by viral culture, 4 (2.7%) specimens were classified as \"entero-like virus\" viral culture and MRVP testing did not detect enterovirus and EV-D68 viruses in 95.9% and 60.3% of PCR-positive specimens. it is likely that EV-D68 has been underdiagnosed when only viral culture or MRVP test methods were used. all EV-D68 viruses were detected in respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal, respiratory aspirate, throat swabs and nasal swabs. EV-D68 was not detected in stool, CSF, sputum or BAL. this is congruent with what has previously reported elsewhere. tests for EV-D68 were performed by PHOL and NML. this may have affected the number of positive results reported in this study. however, it is not possible to determine if requests for testing for EV-D68 were requested more frequently. to protect the patient\u2019s privacy, the data were aggregated and de-identified from all personal identifiers including (health card number, birth date, health unit and address)."}
