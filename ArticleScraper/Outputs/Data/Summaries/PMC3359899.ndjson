{"summary": "the vast surface area of Type I cells suggests that it is the first cell type encountered by respiratory pathogens entering the distal air spaces. this study adds new data to the field of alveolar inflammation, and may lead to new therapies aimed at limiting inflammation and injury. TI cells were cultured on trans-well plates at a density of 500,000 cells/cm2. reagents were added to the cells in serum-free media. cells were cultured for 18 hours before the collection of cells. ohistochemistry was performed on cytocentrifuged preparations of mixed rat lung cells. antibodies included toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and ACE2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Ang II (RayBiotech, Norcross, GA), RTI40, and RTII70. ation Alveolar TI and TII cells were isolated by FACS (14) using antibodies specific to rat TI (RTI40) (15) or rat TII (RTII70) (16) cells were discarded. more than 95% of all cells were viable, as measured by a Live/Dead Kit. Western Blot Analysis Protein lysates from TI and TII cells were studied using standard Western blotting techniques. antibodies included AT1R or AT2R (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and -actin (Sigma-Aldrich). densitometric quantitation was performed using ImageJ software (www.NIH.gov). the animals were administered intratracheal LPS (10 mg/kg) to induce ALI. TI and TII cells were isolated by FACS 18 hours later. transcripts for TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 were detected in TI cells. tLR4 expression in TI cells was assayed via immunocytochemistry. TI cells express toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a receptor for LPS. mixed lung preparations from uninjured rats double-stained for TLR4. TI cells contain both AT1R and AT2R according to Western blotting. TI cells contain approximately 16% more AT1R protein than in TI cells. TI cells contain approximately 35% more AT2R protein than TI cells. western blots of TI and TI cell lysates demonstrate presence of angiotensin Type 1 receptor (AT1R; top panels) and angiotensin Type 2 receptor (AT2R; bottom panels) cells were isolated by FACS. -actin staining is shown to demonstrate the equalization of protein loading. mixed lung cell preparation was stained with Ang II. mixed lung cell preparation was stained with Ang II. cells were stained with RTI40 to display TI cells. data are expressed as fold expression of ACE2 mRNA over control values SEM. all values were normalized to 18S. ACE2 mRNA concentrations were measured via Q-PCR in freshly isolated TI cells. ELISA of the TI cell culture supernatants measured cytokine concentrations from the supernatant of cultured TI cells. the cytokine response from LPS stimulation can be modulated by renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS elements) pretreatment with ACE2 before LPS treatment did not alter TNF- expression. but pretreatment with LOS before LPS treatment significantly decreased TNF- concentrations. results with Ang II alone (n = 3) were no different from those of control samples. ACE2 inhibits LPS-Stimulated IL-6 and IL-1 from cultured TI cells. ACE2 could cleave the Ang II that was up-regulated by LPS. ang II did not increase supernatant cytokine concentrations above control levels. LOS inhibited TNF- secretion from LPS-stimulated TI cells by 89.2% (106.9 34.4 pg/ml, *P 0.05) and IL-6 secretion by 87.3% (152.5 29.8 pg/ml, *P 0.05) in cultured TI cells, pretreatment with PD123319 (30 minutes before LPS stimulation did not alter TNF- (984.1 129.2 pg/ml the combination of RAS Reagents on Cytokine Production in LPS-Treated TI cells was only notable for IL-6. the addition of ACE2 + LOS together before LPS stimulation was predicted to reduce cytokine concentrations in TI cells. TNF- concentrations were reduced by LOS, but remained unchanged with exogenous ACE. LOS decreased LPS-induced TNF- production by 90% within 3 hours. LOS decreased LPS-induced IL-6 production by 58% in as early as 3 hours. LOS disrupts feedback inhibition of AT1R transcript expression. after 18 hours, TI cells have approximately 50% of the AT1R transcript expression of control TI cells. the addition of LOS before LPS treatment brought AT1R transcript expression back to control levels. the findings suggest that AT1R may be feedback-inhibited. mRNA transcripts from freshly isolated FACS TI and alveolar Type II (TII) cells from animals administered intratracheal LPS (injured) or vehicle control were analyzed by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) mRNA concentrations of TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 were normalized to 18S. n = 4 separate experiments for TI cells and n = 5 separate experiments for TI cells. mixed lung cell preparation is stained with TLR4 and TI cell marker. the same slide section is stained with RTII70 to identify TII cells. the same slide section is stained with RTII70. mixed rat lung cell preparation was stained with ACE2. same slide section was stained with TI cell marker RTI40 to identify TI cells. same slide section was stained with ACE2 to identify TI cells. Ang II (Ang II) is present in TI cells from both LPS-injured and noninjured rat lungs. cells were stained with an antibody to Ang II and a TI cell marker. cells were stained with RTI40 to display TI cells. TI and TII cells were isolated via FACS from rats 18 hours after treatment with intratracheal LPS or vehicle control. uninjured TII cells had lower AGT mRNA concentrations, whereas LPS injury increased AGT concentrations by 3.5-fold in TI cells. a 48% reduction was evident in the quantity of ACE2 transcript in the TI cells of injured animals compared with control cells. TI cells produced a small amount of TNF- at baseline (20.6 6.5 pg/ml) (mean SEM) the cytokine response from LPS stimulation in TI cells can be modulated by renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) elements. results are expressed as mean concentrations of cytokine (in pg/ml) SEM. pretreatment with ACE2 before LPS treatment did not alter TNF- expression over baseline levels. ACE2 + LOS pretreatment before LPS treatment significantly decreased IL-6 production by 63.4% (n = 3, *P 0.05), compared with LPS-treated cells. pretreatment with either LOS (n = 6), ACE2 + LOS (n = 6), or PD (n = 6) before LPS treatment decreased the absolute concentrations of IL-1. Ang II 107 M was added to cultured TI cells, and supernatants were collected 18 hours later. ang II did not increase supernatant cytokine concentrations above control levels. inducible effect was modest when compared with LPS treatment. AT2R activation yields vasodilatation, fibroprotection, and apoptosis. pretreatment with PD123319 (30 minutes before LPS stimulation) did not alter TNF- (984.1 129.2 pg/ml) or IL-6 (796.3 214.4 pg/ml) secretion at 18 hours when compared with LPS stimulation alone. IL-1 concentrations were also decreased (15.6 5.7 pg/ml), but this decrease did not reach statistical significance. LOS reduced LPS-stimulated TNF- and IL-6 production by 90% and 58%, respectively. AT1R mRNA concentrations were measured via Q-PCR in cultured TI cells treated with LPS or LOS (103 M) + LPS for 18 hours. control cells were treated with serum-free medium. A 42% reduction was evident in AT1R transcripts in LPS-treated cells. limited data are available on the contribution of TI cells to BAL cytokine content. transcripts for TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 were present in both control (uninjured) and LPS-injured TI cells. similar results were observed in TI cells, as previously reported (4, 23\u201325) ACE\u2013Ang II\u2013AT1R represents the injury-promoting arm. ACE2\u2013Ang-(1\u20137)\u2013AT2R represents the injury-protective arm (29). we postulate that LPS-stimulated cytokine production in TI cells can be modulated. recombinant ACE2 attenuating lung damage detected in TI cells after 18 hours. no difference in ACE2 transcript in TI cells from uninjured lungs. ang II decreases ACE2 mRNA by 60% in certain cell types. control TI cells produced minimal amounts of all three cytokines. recent reports of TNF- concentrations in cultured TI cells range from 800\u20131,000 pg/ml 24 hours after LPS stimulation. ang II induces apoptosis in rat TII cells (37, 38), which may also account for the lack of robust cytokine expression. however, we did not detect any significant reduction in TI cell viability after treatment with Ang II at 107 M for 18 hours. ACE2 decreased the production of IL-6 and IL-1 in LPS-stimulated TI cells, but not the production of TNF-. thus, ACE2 in TI cells the addition of the AT2R-specific inhibitor PD123319 did not produce statistically different results from those of LPS alone. this may represent the cross-reactivity of AT2R inhibitors in the less studied angiotensin receptors AT3R and AT4R. this may occur with AT2R inhibition, thus reducing the inflammatory response. ACE inhibitors or AT1R antagonists were reported to attenuate the inflammatory response in animal models of ALI (8, 42), but similar large-scale studies in humans have yet to be performed. to see if the RAS acts immediately on LPS-induced signaling or if the observed effects arise from the indirect influence of the RAS on other mediators produced by LPS. ium is able to produce cytokines in response to LPS speaks to the ability of TI cells to play a role in alveolar inflammation. TI cells may serve as targets for the development of new therapeutic and preventive tools to regulate alveolar inflammation, to assist in controlling lung injury, and to promote alveolar repair."}
