{"summary": "the age-adjusted invasive cancer incidence rate is 533.8 (532.6-535.1) per 100,000 population. more than 1.4 million people were projected to be diagnosed with cancer in the united states in 2009. in 2005, more than 100,000 cases of hematological malignancies were diagnosed in the united states and approximately 230,000 in Europe [4,6] there are unresolved questions about whether part or all of these supportive therapies can be simultaneously administered with cancer-specific treatments, including chemotherapy. the lack of survival benefit in cancer patients admitted to the ICU with multiple organ failure [10,17] has raised concerns about the timing of ICU admission. recent prospective and retrospective cohort studies have documented lower mortality rates compared with the mortality rates previously reported [16,23,29-33] the impact of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign may have played a part in the reduction in mortality seen during the past few years in patients with septic shock [26,27]. the medical literature has documented improvement in survival of critically ill patients with cancer. however, most of the studies have evaluated short-term outcomes, such as ICU, hospital, 28-day, and rarely, 3- or 6-month survival. a multicenter study of patients with hematologic malignancy admitted to the ICU showed that BMT was a risk factor for increased hospital death [55] among patients with cancer admitted to the ICU, those who underwent autologous BMT had the same prognosis as those who did not [19,23] allogeneic BMT recipients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy [27,61], patients with multiple organ failure related to delayed ICU admission [10] and specific clinical vignettes in patients with solid tumors. the prognosis remains grim, with an overall 1-yr survival rate of less than 10% in patients who receive mechanical ventilation [27,34,65-67] failure and need for mechanical ventilation 4-6 weeks after BMT. thrombotic microangiopathy due to endothelial activation triggered by GVHD. thrombotic microangiopathy due to endothelial activation triggered by GVHD, total body irradiation, and infectious diseases. a prospective study evaluated the outcomes of patients proposed for ICU admission. 20% of patients who were not admitted because they were considered \"too well\" died before hospital discharge. 25% of patients who were not admitted because they were too sick survived. early ICU admission offers the opportunity to use noninvasive diagnostic tests. bronchoscopy and BAL can be avoided in large proportion of patients. hemato-oncologists are able to appraise outcomes and to update the intensivists. bronchoscopy and BAL in hypoxemic patients may be less harmful if performed in the ICU. there is a linear relationship between the number of organ dysfunctions and patients' survival. patients should be treated with a full code status, or according to an ICU trial. some patients with low-grade hematological malignancies may be admitted at any time of their disease course, mainly for infectious or toxic life-threatening complications. patients with partial remission (myeloma) or high-risk solid tumors (metastatic breast or ovarian cancer) can be admitted at a later course of their disease, even after several courses of chemotherapy. ICU is warranted to avoid late ICU admission (condition associated with higher mortality) c) Palliative ICU admission Noninvasive strategies only Admission to the ICU for the purpose of undergoing noninvasive mechanical ventilation as the ceiling of therapy. terminal ICU admission No life-sustaining therapies ICU admission is required to best provide palliative care and symptom control. this study was an attempt to broaden ICU admission policies. survival was 20% overall but 40% in patients who were alive and in the ICU after day 3. this is when evidence emerges that a new effective therapy is available for a patient without lifespan-prolonging therapy. we must emphasize that if this status of ICU admission is used more than 2 to 3 times per year, conflict resolution strategies or an attempt to increase the understanding and knowledge about the underlying condition are in order. the common characteristic of all previous statuses of ICU admission is that patients receive full-code management for an unlimited or a limited time period. ill cancer patients suggest a research agenda to address the following ten burning issues. the first and most intriguing issue is the lack of studies on long-term outcomes in cancer patients who survive their ICU stay. no study has specifically evaluated health-related quality of life and post-ICU burden in critically ill cancer patients who survived the ICU. david frum: studies in relatives of critically ill cancer patients should be developed to seek specific needs and communication strategies. he says new modalities of ICU admission should be evaluated and the balance between strengths and weaknesses described. frum: it is possible, yet debatable, that death that occurs in the ICU is perceived as \"good\" transition from curative to palliative care is complex in cancer patients because of their young age, complex medical conditions, doubts on the actual therapeutic plans, and pressures from consultants and relatives. the need to document patient preferences for resuscitation and end-of-life issues at the time of ICU admission is crucial. additional multicentre cohort studies are needed to identify predictors of death in cancer patients admitted to the ICU. these include triage criteria for ICU admission, code status implemented at ICU admission, the nature of life-sustaining therapies that are required, and the extent of organ dysfunction at admission. this includes data on non-ICU cancer patients with various levels of organ dysfunction on the wards. we advise caution when implementing NIV in hypoxemic patients with cancer [94] unless NIV is the ceiling of therapy [95], we believe that NIV should be initiated only in an ICU or high-dependency unit setting. the concept that the ICU is an appropriate setting to deliver palliative or terminal care is highly controversial. early admission to the ICU for cancer patients is recommended 10. Doing everything possible, even cancer chemotherapy, may improve outcome Table 2. Recent ICU advances in the management of critically ill cancer patients 1. Less restrictive admission policies [17] 2. Use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation [23,48,49] 3. Diagnostic strategy in acute respiratory failure [40,47,50,60] 4. Prevention of tumor lysis syndrome [12,58,59] 5. Management of acute kidney injury [37-39] 5. Advance in antifungal agents [102] unadjusted hospital mortality rates in critically ill cancer patients by year of study publication (clear gray). new strategies avoiding early chemo during the course of chronic malignancies assist in managing patients with improved performance status with less organ-related toxicity. no study has used long-term or meaningful outcomes, such as disease-free survival and quality of life after ICU admission. classical predictors of mortality are no longer relevant Current studies still report that the need for mechanical ventilation, presence of invasive fungal infection, development of multiorgan failure are additional prognostic factors for mortality among cancer patients. improved understanding of organ dysfunction in patients with cancer has led to better understanding of the pathophysiology of acute tumor lysis syndrome [12,46,58,59] and macrophage activation syndrome [14] and to a comprehensive diagnostic strategy of acute respiratory failure [60]. there are three groups of patients in whom survival rates remain marginally low. ten factors have been identified to be associated with mortality after a critical care illness. most are surrogate markers of GVHD. most are surrogate markers of GVHD. patients with multiple organ failure are at higher risk for death if their ICU admission is delayed. the nature and the extent of organ dysfunctions, at ICU admission or more significantly after day 3, are good predictors of mortality [17,26,71]. triage criteria for ICU admission remain unreliable. identifying patients who remain severely ill may be easier and more effective to appraise outcomes. there may be \"golden hours or days\" of resuscitation associated with improved outcome, for the ICU management of critically ill cancer patients. further observational studies are needed to confirm optimal time for the \"ICU Trial\" ICU clinicians may be more knowledgeable and experienced in setting goals of life-sustaining therapies based on the reversibility of single organ dysfunction. decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies best undertaken by both parties. information given to patients' relatives and shared decision-making should be presented by both parties together. studies have shown the feasibility of administering chemotherapy in the ICU, with acceptable short- and long-term outcomes. short-term survival after critical care illness improved when patients present with severe sepsis or septic shock after recent chemotherapy. the medical literature has documented improvement in survival of critically ill patients with cancer. but most of the studies have evaluated short-term outcomes, such as ICU, hospital, 28-day, and, rarely, 3- or 6-month survival. invasive fungal infection, development of multiorgan failure, and high severity of illness scores are additional prognostic factors for mortality among cancer patients. a multicenter study of patients with hematologic malignancy admitted to the ICU showed that BMT was a risk factor for increased hospital death [55], but those who underwent autologous BMT had the same prognosis. allogeneic BMT recipients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy [27,61], patients with multiple organ failure related to delayed ICU admission [10] and specific clinical vignettes in patients with solid tumors. the prognosis remains grim, with an overall 1-yr survival rate of less than 10% in patients who receive mechanical ventilation [27,34,65-67]. acute respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation 4-6 weeks after BMT. thrombotic microangiopathy due to endothelial activation triggered by GVHD, total body irradiation, toxicity of immunosuppressive regimen, and infectious diseases. triage criteria for ICU admission remain unreliable. 20% of patients who were not admitted because they were considered \"too well\" died before hospital discharge. 25% of patients who were not admitted because they were too sick survived. early ICU admission offers the opportunity to use noninvasive diagnostic tests. bronchoscopy and BAL can be avoided in large proportion of patients. hemato-oncologists are able to appraise outcomes and to update the intensivists. the following four observations suggest early admission may improve outcome. a) during the past decade, decreased mortality was observed in association with earlier ICU admission. b) receiving oxygen at a flow higher than 1 liter/min is significantly associated with subsequent need for mechanical ventilation and death. some patients with low-grade hematological malignancies may be admitted at any time of their disease course, mainly for infectious or toxic life-threatening complications. patients with partial remission (myeloma) or high-risk solid tumors (metastatic breast or ovarian cancer) can be admitted at a later course of their disease, even after several courses of chemotherapy. ICU is warranted to avoid late ICU admission (condition associated with higher mortality) c) Palliative ICU admission Noninvasive strategies only Admission to the ICU for the purpose of undergoing noninvasive mechanical ventilation as the ceiling of therapy. we have advocated the use of the ICU trial in patients with newly diagnosed malignancies. survival was 20% overall but 40% in patients who were alive and in the ICU after day 3. we propose this admission status for patients in whom severe limitation of the performance status are attributable to the malignancy itself. the philosophy of this type of ICU admission is that 1 or 2 days of ICU management will make the prognosis more evident to appraise and create mutual trust. the use of heroic ICU to resolve conflicts may create false hope, raise unrealistic expectations, and can be perceived as highly controversial. some patients with low-grade hematological malignancies may be admitted at any time of their disease course, mainly for infectious or toxic life-threatening complications. patients with partial remission (myeloma) or high-risk solid tumors (metastatic breast or ovarian cancer) can be admitted at a later course of their disease, even after several courses of chemotherapy.

Detailed evaluation of the ICU admission process including data on non-ICU cancer patients with various levels of organ dysfunction. we advise caution when implementing NIV in hypoxemic patients with cancer [94] unless NIV is the ceiling of therapy [95], we believe that NIV should be initiated only in an ICU or high-dependency unit setting. however, these studies report no qualitative outcomes, including quality of life, ICU-burden, and quality of dying for the majority of patients who die after NIV. a grant from the Assistance-Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AOM 04139) and the French Society for Intensive Care Medicine."}
