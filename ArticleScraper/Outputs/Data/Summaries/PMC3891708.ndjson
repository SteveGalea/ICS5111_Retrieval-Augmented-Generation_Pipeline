{"summary": "the only tuberculosis vaccine currently available is an attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG), although its efficacy against adult TB disease remains controversial. about 500,000 of people around the world are affected by MDR-TB every year. however, there are a small number of effective drugs against MDR-TB. granulysin is a member of the saposin-like protein family and colocalizes with perforin and granzymes in the cytolytic granules of human CTL and NK cells. in the presence of perforin, it has a cytolytic activity against intracellular pathogens in the cytoplasm of human CTL and NK cells. granulysin-vaccine is produced from CTL and NK cells. immunological function of Ksp37 has not been elucidated yet. we have established Ksp37 transgenic mice to elucidate the in vivo role on Ksp37 in the immunity to the infection of TB. the vaccine in murine models of TB Therapeutic efficacy of HSP65 DNA + IL-12 DNA vaccine was evaluated. at 30 d after intravenous challenge of MDR-TB, the CFUs of TB in the lungs, spleen, and liver were counted and therapeutic efficacy of HVJ-Envelope DNA vaccine was evaluated. the vaccine consists of a plasmid DNA vaccine expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65)+ HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA + IL-12 DNA vaccine showed therapeutic efficacy against MDR-TB and drug-sensitive TB in mice. significant prolongation of survival was observed in the XDR-TB infected mice by the treatment with this vaccine. mice were infected with H37Rv TB by using intratracheal aerosol challenge using aerosol chamber. one week after challenge of TB, 100g of HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA were administered 6 times for 3 weeks by i.d, i.m, or s.c. mice were sacrified, and CFUs of TB in the spleen were evaluated. IL-2 receptor -chain gene disrupted SCID-PBL/hu. in vivo humanized immune models of IL-2 receptor -chain disrupted NOD-SCID mice. one 107 PBL from a healthy human volunteer were injected into IL-2 receptor-chain disrupted NOD-SCID mice. twenty one days after injection of PBL, mice were challenged with 5 105 H37Rv i.v. and then treated with vaccine. the monkey group treated with HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA + IL-12 DNA vaccine showed 100% survival. in contrast, the monkey group of control saline showed 60% survival. thus, the therapeutic DNA vaccine improved the survival rate of TB-infected monkeys, compared with the saline (control). this data indicated the therapeutic efficacy of a GMP-level of DNA vaccine in TB-infected monkeys. the precise role of granulysin in the in vivo against the tuberculosis infection has not been elucidated yet. we have established two kinds of transgenic mice by using usual microinjection method. we measured CFU number of M. tuberculosis in the lung four weeks after intravenous injection of TB (5 105 /mouse) five 15K granulysin transgenic mice and five wild type C57BL/6 mice were injected with 5 105 H37Rv M. tuberculosis i.v. four weeks after the challenge of M. Tuberculosis, mice were sacrificed. four weeks after TB challenge, mice were sacrified, and CFUs of TB in the liver were evaluated. survival rate of granulysin-vaccine was 25% (1/4) at 1 y after TB infection. survival rate at one year after TB infection was 0% (0/4) five 102 M. tuberculosis (Erdman strain) were intratracheally into cynomolgus monkeys. four weeks after challenge of TB, 400g of HVJ-Envelope/15K granulysin were injected i.m. six times every two weeks. we measured the CFU number of M. tuberculosis in the lung 3 weeks after TB aerosol infection. this result indicated the anti-TB effect of Ksp37 in vivo. this vaccine significantly decreases the number of drug sensitive TB in the spleen and the lung of mice. this vaccine also decreased the number of MDR-TB in the lungs and spleen of mice, indicating the efficacy of the vaccine in the mouse model of TB. -Envelop/HSP65 DNA + IL-12 DNA vaccine in combination with INH against TB infection. mice were infected with H37Rv TB by using intratracheal aerosol challenge using aerosol chamber. five weeks after challenge of TB, mice were sacrified, and CFU of TB in the spleen were evaluated. efficacy of intradermal administration (i.d.) was highest among three administration routes. efficacy of intradermal administration (i.d.) was highest among three administration routes. ID-PBL/hu used in vivo humanized immune models of IL-2 receptor -chain disrupted NOD-SCID mice (SCID-PBL/hu) mice were sacrificed and CFU of TB in the liver of mice were accessed. the efficacy of HSP65 + IL-12 DNA vaccine was examined in this IL-2 receptor -chain gene disrupted SCID-PBL/hu-model. this model shows stronger human CTL induction and proliferation than conventional SCID mouse-based model (CB17-SCID-PBL-hu) the vaccine consists of a plasmid DNA vaccine expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65)+interleukin-12 (IL-12) and a vector (hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome or HVJ-envelope) this vaccine significantly decreases the number of drug sensitive H37Rv TB in the spleen and the lung of mice. therapeutic efficacy of this vaccine on chronic TB disease models was demonstrated. therapeutic efficacies of this vaccine on the MDR-TB infection and XDR-TB were observed. BALB/c mice were infected with H37Rv TB by using intratracheal aerosol challenge using aerosol chamber. one week after challenge of TB, 100g of HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA were administered 6 times for 3 weeks. five weeks after challenge, mice were sacrified, and CFUs of TB in the spleen were evaluated. IL-2 receptor -chain gene disrupted SCID-PBL/hu. 0.05; G1 vs. G3; p 0.05; Student\u2019s test Therefore, in the monkey model we plan to study efficacy of intradermal injection of this vaccine. TB in the liver of mice were accessed as described in Materials and Methods. one 107 PBL from a healthy human volunteer were injected into IL-2 receptor-chain disrupted NOD-SCID mice. twenty one days after injection, mice were challenged with 5 105 H37Rv i.v. the monkey group treated with HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA + IL-12 DNA vaccine showed 100% survival. thus, the therapeutic DNA vaccine improved the survival rate of TB-infected monkeys, compared with the saline (control). these data indicated the therapeutic efficacy of a GMP-level of DNA vaccine in TB-infected monkeys. granulysin transgenic mice elucidate mechanism of granulysin in vivo. we measured CFU number of M. tuberculosis in the lung four weeks after intravenous injection of TB (5 105 /mouse) the combination of granulysin-vaccine and granulysin-vaccine showed synergistic effects. five 15K granulysin transgenic mice and five wild type C57BL/6 mice were injected with 5 105 H37Rv M. tuberculosis i.v. Four weeks after the challenge of M. Tuberculosis, mice were sacrificed. survival rate of granulysin-vaccine was 25% (1/4) at 1 y after TB infection. all monkeys in saline group were died within 200 d after TB challenge. survival rate at one year after TB infection was 0% (0/4) granulysin showed cytolytic activity against a variety of tumors and microbes, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. in vivo anti-microbe activity and anti-tuberculosis activity has not been elucidated yet. we have established granulysin transgenic mice by using usual microinjection method. we measured CFU number of M. tuberculosis in the lung four weeks after intravenous injection of TB (5 105 /mouse) reduction of CFU number was observed in 15K granulysin transgenic mice compared with the normal C57BL/6 mice. five 15K granulysin transgenic mice and five wild type C57BL/6 mice were injected with 5 105 H37Rv M. tuberculosis i.v. Four weeks after the challenge of M. Tuberculosis, mice were sacrificed. survival rate of granulysin-vaccine was 25% (1/4) at 1 y after TB infection. all monkeys in saline group were died within 200 d after TB challenge. survival rate at one year after TB infection was 0% (0/4) 102 M. tuberculosis (Erdman strain) were intratracheally into cynomolgus monkeys. the proliferation of PBL from monkeys vaccinated with HVJ-Envelope/15K granulysin on 13 weeks after TB challenge were assessed. the CFU number of M. tuberculosis was decreased compared with that of wild type control mice. in vivo anti-TB effect of Ksp37 transgenic mice. granulomatous lesions were observed in lung of vaccine-treated monkey. a lot of granulomatous lesions were observed in lung of survived monkey. a little or no such lesions were observed in lung of saline-treated monkey. the level of Ksp37 protein in the serum of patients with TB was lower than that of healthy volunteer. the result suggested the relation between the serum level of Ksp37 and TB disease. we have established Ksp37 transgenic mice to elucidate the in vivo role of Ksp37 in the defense against the infection of M. tuberculosis. i.d. vaccination of HSP65-vaccine showed stronger therapeutic effects against TB than i.m. vaccination on the basis of the prolongation of survival and ESR (erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) combination of several vaccines or combination of vaccines with drugs for chemotherapy might provide a new insight for the prevention of the reactivation of TB. granulysin- and Ksp37-vaccines might be useful vaccines against TB including XDR-TB and MDR-TB. granulysin were injected six times every two weeks. all animal experiments were approved by the Leonard Wood Memorial Animal Care and Use Committee and the National Hospital Organization Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center. all vaccinations and experiments on isolate tissue of animal were done under anesthetic state with sevoflurane. all animal experiments were approved by the National Hospital Organization Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center Animal Care and Use Committee. the number of colony of mycobacterium tuberculosis was measured. two types of Ksp Tg mice (#13, #14) were made. animals were vaccinated with HVJ-Envelope/15K granulysin DNA vaccine 6 times. four weeks after challenge of TB, 400 g of HVJ-Envelope/15K granulysin were injected six times every two weeks. mice were kept in isolator cages, manipulated in laminar flow hoods. all vaccinations and experiments on isolate tissue were done under anesthetic state with sevoflurane. mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv 5 105 CFU was intravenously injected to 15K granulysin Tg mice, 9K granulysin Tg mice and normal C57BL/6 mice (812weeks) from 2 to 12 weeks after injection, these mice were sacrificed."}
