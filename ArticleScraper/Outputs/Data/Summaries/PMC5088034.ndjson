{"summary": "seventeen patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were in the hospital during march 24\u2013May 3, 2014. all patients with suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infection were placed in private rooms equipped with negative pressure ventilation. all patients with suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV infection were placed in private rooms equipped with negative pressure ventilation. contacts with MERS-CoV patients were described, including patient care activities, duration of contact, and exposure to body fluids. we assessed exposures outside the hospital, including household exposures to persons with MERS-CoV. al review board of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre approved the study. results Of 363 HCP eligible for the MICU (178 HCP), ED (137 HCP), and neurology unit (48 HCP) cohorts, 292 (80.4%) HCP were enrolled: 131 (73.5%) from the MICU, 127 (92.7%) from the ED and 34 (70.8%) from the neurology unit.

CP could serve as a potential source of infection to other HCP. the attack rate appears to be substantially higher than that in prior reports that used nonserologic methods of detection."}
