{"summary": "the study Fecal samples were collected from 79 ferrets from 10 animal hospitals scattered across 5 prefectures in japan. most of the ferrets were brought to veterinarians for clinical signs such as diarrhea, abdominal masses, and hypergammaglobulinemia. some had signs unrelated to coronavirus infection or were asymptomatic. of 79 samples, 33 (41.8%) were positive for coronaviruses by RT-PCR. the identities with feline coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus and mink coronavirus were 73.5%\u201375.9%, 73.5%\u201376.1%, 73.8%\u201376.1%, and 80.2%\u201384.0%, respectively. human coVs (HCoVs) 229E and NL63, which belong to the Alphacoronavirus genus, were used as the outgroup. scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. results for RT-PCR using this new primer set showed 44 (55.7%) of 79 samples were positive for coronavirus. forward primer 5\u2032-CTG GTG TTT GTG CAA CAT CTA C-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-TCT ATT TGC ACA AAA TCA GAC A-3\u2032 for genotype 1. Among these ferrets, 30 (38.0%) were infected with genotype 1 and 17 (21.5%) with genotype 2. 8 (10.1%) ferrets were infected with both genotypes of coronaviruses. genotype 1 ferret coronavirus has also been detected from asymptomatic ferrets in the Netherlands (11) to further investigate virus transmission routes, oral swab specimens were collected from 14 of the 79 ferrets and examined by RT-PCR using primers FRCoV RdRp-F1 and FRCoV RdRp-R1. ferret coronaviruses have no relationship between the 2 genotypes of ferret coronavirus and the type of disease. the addition of 23 new isolates to the phylogenetic tree of ferret coronaviruses tends to support the latter conclusion. without extensive animal passage studies, virus isolation, and coronavirus-free ferrets, this theory may be difficult to confirm."}
