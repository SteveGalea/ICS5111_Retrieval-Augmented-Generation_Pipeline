{"summary": "TBF in cattle and sheep is characterized by high fever, reduced milk yield, inclusion in circulating neutrophils, leucopenia, abortions and reduced fertility. clinical signs in cattle may include depression, decreased appetite, coughing, nasal discharge, respiratory signs, swelling of the hind limbs and stiff gate. the most serious problem associated with TBF is the following immunosuppresion, which may predispose to secondary infections. four cows contracted high fever (40.9\u201341.2\u00b0C) within a period of four days. two more cows showed high fever one week later. clinical signs were not seen in local cattle. a total of 400 neutrophils were examined on each smear by light microscopy. the number of cells containing Anaplasma inclusions was recorded. EDTA and whole blood samples were collected on august 10. PCR was performed in 25 l reaction volumes containing 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 M of each primer, 0.7 U AmpliTaq Gold enzyme (Perkin Elmer), and approximately 100 ng of DNA. sequences were visually inspected from chromatograms. serological cross-reactions between all members of the A. phagocytophilum group have been reported [3], the sera were analysed using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) with a horse isolate (formerly Ehrlichia equi) as antigen. a titre of 1.6 (log10 reciprocal of 1:40) or more was regarded as positive. earlier studies indicate that exposure to the bacterium may be common even on pastures with no apparent tick infestation. sensitivity of the serological test could have been increased if strictly homologous antigen had been used, but such an antigen was unfortunately not available. and Eli Brundtland for technical assistance."}
