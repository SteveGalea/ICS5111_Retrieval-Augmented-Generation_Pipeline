{"summary": "in 2005, the first human bocaparvovirus, HBoV1, was discovered in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children (2 years of age) following HBoV1, three additional HBoV strains, namely, HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4, were isolated from pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis (7, 8) common patient symptoms include diarrhea, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, pneumonia HBoV-related respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections worldwide (>17 countries), combined with a lack of direct treatment, drives the desire to understand the disease-causing mechanisms of these viruses. HBoVs have also been detected in river water and urban sewage water samples, suggesting a possible transmission route (28, 29). VP1u contains a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzyme. it is required for modifying membranes and escaping from the endosomal/lysosomal pathway while trafficking to the nucleus for genome replication. this activity was also shown to be harmful to tight junctions found in human airway epithelial cells that normally function as barriers to pathogens and foreign entities. differences were identified in all 10 reported VRs, VR-I to VR-IX (39). these VRs are important determinants of parvovirus infectivity, transduction efficiency, and antigenicity (39). the data from these structures expand our knowledge of bocaparvovirus capsids. 1, HBoV3 and HBoV4 capsid structures reported here are among the highest obtained by using cryo-reconstruction for virus capsids of this size. the estimated resolution of HBoV1 (black line) at FSC threshold values of 0.5 and 0.143 are 3.16 and 2.87, respectively. all three structures have characteristic features common to other available Parvovirinae subfamily structures but more closely resemble members of the Dependoparvovirus genus. these features include a shallow depression at each 2-fold symmetry axis, a trimeric protrusion that surrounds each 3-fold symmetry axis, and a channel at each 5-fold symmetry axis. however, HBoV3 and HBoV4 have more prominent 3-fold protrusions than HB Arrowheads point to the locations of the 5-fold (5f) symmetry axes and channel. under each 5-fold channel, density forming a basket can be observed. VP3 amino acids with side chains start from N-terminal residue 33 of HBoV1 or residue 34 of HBoV3 and HBoV4 respectively. this extended density could be interpreted as the main chain for residues 27 to 32 of HBoV1 and 28 to 33 of HBoV3 and HBoV4. bocaparvoviruses are postulated to become externalized through the 5-fold channel to enable their PLA2 function. the HBoV1, HBoV3, and HBoV4 VP3 models were built from N-terminal residues 33, 34, and 34 to the last C-terminal residues 542, 539, and 541 (VP3 numbering) the amino acid side chain densities were well defined in the core secondary structure regions (e.g., D and G) but exceptions were observed for glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues. the resolution of the maps enabled the interpretation and modeling of these differences. the truncated density of the glutamic acid side chain (Glu237) is due to high sensitivity to radiation damage (46). bocaparvovirus VPs contain a second helix (B) in the EF surface loop. a similar helix was previously described in BPV, another bocaparvovirus (39) this observation suggests a genus level function for B, as well as the density extension under the 5-fold axes. the overall VP3 sequence identity range among HBoV1, HBoV3, and HBoV4 is 78 to 91%. HBoV3 and HBoV4 are the most similar at 91%. the structural alignment resulted in 0.88 residues aligned and six gaps. trusions, the 5-fold channel, and the floor of the 5-fold depression create local capsid surface variations between the bocaparvoviruses. bocaparvoviruses are aligned in the VRs Comparison Range of C distances. the bocaparvoviruses are aligned in the VRs Comparison Range of C distances. HBoV1 (blue), HBoV3 (green), HBoV4 (red) and BPV (pink) are shown. orange highlighting indicates identical residues among the HBoVs. VR-II is part of the footprint for a cross-reactive antibody that recognizes HBoV1, HBoV2 and HBoV4 (34). HBoV1 is highly divergent in HBoV1 compared to HBoV3 and HBoV4 because of an insertion of 4 aa. the loop that corresponds to VR-V displays significant differences at both the sequence and structure levels. VR-VI, VR-VII, and VR-VIII are structurally similar among the HBoVs and show only minor amino acid differences. this region forms part of an antibody generated against HBoV1 that cross-reacts with HBoV2 and HBoV4 (34). BPV shares 46% sequence identity with the HBoVs. superposition of the BPV crystal structure onto the HBoV crystal structure resulted in C RMSDs ranging between 1.28 and 1.37 with conservation of the core secondary structure elements. however, the conformations of the surface loops differed significantly. the HBoV structure information for HBoV-based gene therapy vectors is under way (58) the use of HBoV vectors is advantageous for the treatment of respiratory genetic diseases by using HBoV1 vectors and the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases by using HBoV2 to HBoV4 vectors. a previously identified VR-III as a determinant of tissue tropism. comparison to the previously reported BPV structure identified VR-VI to VR-IX as possible host range determinants. other regions showing structural variability localize to previously identified functional regions of parvovirus capsids.

HBoV3 and HBoV4 have more prominent 3-fold protrusions than HBoV1 that give their capsid surfaces a more \u201cspiky\u201d appearance. this unique feature, reported previously for the crystal structure of BPV (39), for HBoV1 at 7.9- resolution (33), and low-resolution structures determined for the HBoV-Fab complexes (34), has not been observed in any other non-bocaparvovirus capsid structures HBoV1 VP3 structure is shown within its semitransparent density. first residue for which side chain density is ordered is labeled. orange-shaded residues are identical amino acids among the HBoVs. yellow-shaded residues are similar amino acids. reconstructed maps are rendered at lower density thresholds (0.7 to 0.8 sigma) this extended density could be interpreted as the main chain for residues 27 to 32 of HBoV1 and 28 to 33 of HBoV3 and HBoV4. this observation supports a previous hypothesis that the N-terminal residues of the bocaparvoviruses lie inside the capsid. HBoV4 VP3 models were built from N-terminal residues 33, 34, and 34 to the last C-terminal residues 542, 539, and 541 (VP3 numbering) the amino acid side chain densities were well defined in the core secondary structure regions (e.g., D and G) but exceptions to the ordering of the side chain densities were observed for glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues. the resolution of the maps enabled the interpretation and modeling of these differences. truncated density of the glutamic acid side chain (Glu237) is due to high sensitivity to radiation damage (46). bocaparvovirus VP3 structure shows a genus level function for B. the conserved -barrel core motif (B-I), A, and the A and B helices (orange) are indicated. loops inserted between these secondary structure elements also contain -strand regions, as indicated. HBoV3 and HBoV4 are the most similar at 91%. the structural alignment resulted in C root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 0.88 (498 residues aligned and six gaps), 0.97 (480 residues aligned and eight gaps), and 0.86 (484 residues aligned and four gaps) the main chains of HBoV1 and HBoV4 differ most. the bocaparvovirus VP3 VRs are closeup views of the VRs when HBoV1 (blue), HBoV3 (green), HBoV4 (pink) and BPV (pink) are compared. the bocaparvovirus VP3 VRs show closeup views of the VRs. orange highlighting indicates identical residues among the HBoVs. 3D capsid surface representations generated with PyMol (37) (A) of the HBoV capsid models viewed down the 2-fold axis and Roadmap projections generated with the RIVEM program (74) (B) VR-II is part of the footprint for a cross-reactive antibody that recognizes HBoV1, HBoV2 and HBoV4 (34). HBoV1 is highly divergent in HBoV1 compared to HBoV3 and HBoV4. regions analogous to VR-III serve as determinants of tissue tropism, pathogenicity, transduction efficiency, and antibody recognition in other parvoviruses. VR-VI, VR-VII, and VR-VIII are structurally similar among the HBoVs. these loops are located on the side of the 3-fold protrusions. these regions have also been associated with a role in parvovirus infectivity and antigenic reactivity. BPV crystal structure onto the HBoV crystal structure resulted in C RMSDs ranging between 1.28 and 1.37. however, the conformations of the surface loops differed significantly. VR-III, one of the most divergent VRs of the HBoVs, is structurally more similar. the use of HBoV vectors is advantageous for the treatment of respiratory genetic diseases by using HBoV1 vectors and the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases by using HBoV2 to HBoV4 vectors by taking advantage of their natural tissue tropism. the higher genome packaging capacity of the HBoVs is larger than that of AAVs (4.7 kb) baculoviruses expressing VP3 of HBoVs were generated and used to infect Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 5. recombinant baculoviruses were generated and used to infect Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 5. frame alignment of the micrographs was performed with the DE_process_frames software (Direct Electron) the individual parameters of the data collection and the corresponding dark and bright reference images were used without radiation dose damage compensation (63). inverse temperature factor of 1/100 2 was applied to each of the final density maps. noise suppression factor was applied in AUTO3DEM to avoid amplification of noise in density maps. real-space refinement subroutine was run with the default settings for five macrocycles. a 60-mer of the model was further refined by using the rigid-body and B-factor refinement options in PHENIX. the final statistics for each refined model are listed in Table 1. surface representations of the VP3 structures and side chain density images were generated with the PyMOL program (73). the final cryo-reconstructed maps and atomic models of HBoV1, HBoV3, and HBoV4 have been deposited in the EMDB (accession numbers EMD-8598, EMD-8604, and EMD-8605) the grids were screened for suitability for cryo-data collection with a 16-megapixel charge-coupled device camera (Gatan, Inc.) these grids were screened for suitability for cryo-data collection with a 16-megapixel charge-coupled device camera (Gatan, Inc.) the data collection parameters were performed with the DE_process_frames software (Direct Electron) the gold standard protocol was used throughout the structure determination process. the resolutions of the reconstructed maps are reported on the basis of FSC threshold criteria of 0.143 and 0.5. an inverse temperature factor of 1/100 2 was applied to each of the final reconstructed density maps. the high resolution of the HBoV1 density map, at 2.9, enabled the interpretation of individual amino acid positions. the reference VP3 monomer model was adjusted into the density map guided by the amino acid sequence by using interactive model building and the real-space-refine options available in Coot. VRs were previously defined for autonomously replicating viruses (as regions with two or more consecutive residues with an RMSD of >2.0 between the superposed structures) animation representations of the VP3 structures and side chain density images were generated with the PyMOL program (73)."}
