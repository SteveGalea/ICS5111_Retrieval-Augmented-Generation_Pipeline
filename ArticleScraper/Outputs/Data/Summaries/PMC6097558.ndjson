{"summary": "one-day-old specific pathogen-free chicks were divided into four groups in each experiment. group 1 and 2 were inoculated with H9N2 AIV through nasal route in 1 day old, group 1 and 3 were vaccinated with live infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) vaccine in 5 and 18 days old. serum samples were collected weekly for the detection of humoral immune response against H9N2 AIV, NDV, and IBV from all chicken groups. rRT-PCR results with virus titration in ECEs revealed a significant increase in H9N2 AIV titer with extension in the period of viral shedding. infections with H9N2 viruses in Egypt are higher in chicken than other species, mostly in apparently healthy broilers. infections with H9N2 viruses in Egypt are higher in chicken than other species, mostly in apparently healthy broilers, and recorded in layers and breeders. 109 EID50/ml were diluted to a final concentration of 106 EID50/ml.

Vaccines Commercial live IBV vaccine (H120 strain, 103 EID50/dose) and live Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine (Clone 30 strain, 106 EID50/dose) were used in both experiments. live IBV and NDV vaccines were administrated in drinking water by the recommended dose of the producer. groups/No number of birds 1 day old 5 days old 18 days old 5 20 H9N2 IBV vaccine NDV vaccine 6 20 H9N2 - NDV vaccine 7 15 - - NDV vaccine 8 10 - - - IBV=Infectious bronchitis coronavirus, NDV=Newcastle disease virus Serology Sera were collected weekly in each transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) RNA extraction was completed using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) catalog no.52904. Real-time RT-PCR was applied using Quantitect probe, catalog no. 204443. cloacal swabs collected from different groups were inoculated for virus detection and titration. serology of NDV in experiment 2 showed a significant increase at 28 and 35 days in Group 7 (6.7 and 7.7) than other Groups 5 (4 and 3.3) and 6 (4.7 and 3.6), respectively. in experiment 2, increasing IBV antibody titer by increasing the age in Group 5 besides 10 ELISA units in all remaining groups. organs collected from group 1 showed sloughed epithelium in the lumen in tra\u00adchea. examination revealed severe denudation of renal tubules and mul\u00adtifocal histiocytes infiltration and focal mononuclear cell infiltration in kidney. severe Histopathological results of experiment 2 showed severe denudation and focal infiltration with mononuclear cells. intertubular congestion and intertubular hemorrhage in kidney, severe activation of mucous glands, hyperplasia of lining epithelium with sloughed epithelium and submucosal hemorrhage in trachea. Virus shedding extended in Group 1 up to 15 days versus Group 2 only up to 10 days. a significant increase in RNA copies in group 5 with copies ranged between 2.31910 (ct 27.80) at 21 days. in experiment 1, there was a significant increase in Group 1 (3) than Group 2 (1) observed clearly at 7 days old with virus shedding extended in Group 1 up to 15 days. in experiment 2, there was a significant increase in group 5 (2.7, 2.3, and 1.5) than Group 6 (2.3, 1.5, and 1) at 3, 5, and 7 days postvaccination, respectively, with virus shedding extended in Group 5 up to 10 days versus Group 2 only up to 7 days. serology of NDV in experiment 2 showed a significant increase at 28 and 35 days in Group 7 (6.7 and 7.7) than other Groups 5 (4 and 3.3) and 6 (4.7 and 3.6), respectively. in experiment 2, there was a significant increase in Group 1 (8.7 and 9.6) than Group 2 (4.6 and 3.3) at 7 and 14 days. serology of NDV in experiment 2 showed a significant increase at 28 and 35 days. in experiment 1, there was a significant increase in ELISA units in Group 3 (15.4) than Group 1(14.4) at 14 days old, while the same results obtained at 7 days old were 10. in experiment 2, increasing IBV antibody titer by increasing the age in Group 5 besides 10 ELISA units in all remaining groups. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - age of birds group organ Kidney Trachea Spleen S1 S2 S3 S1 S2 S3 S1 S2 S3 S1 S2 S3 7 days 5 +++ ++ ++ ++ ++ 6 + - + - - - - + + + 7 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - organs collected from group 3 results showed sloughed epithelium in the lumen in tra\u00adchea. however, organs collected from group 4 showed no changes. in kidney, severe activation of mucous glands, hyperplasia of lining epithelium with sloughed epithelium and submucosal hemorrhage in trachea and severe focal hemorrhage and lymphoblasts infiltration. group 6 Histopathological results showed only flattening and degeneration of some renal tubules with cystic formation and congested blood ves\u00adsels. Virus shedding extended in Group 1 up to 15 days versus Group 2 only up to 10 days. RNA copies ranged between 2.31910 (ct 27.80) at 21 days and 1.86 (ct 31.16) at 28 days. in experiment 2, there was a significant increase in RNA copies in Group 1. real-time RT-PCR Results of H9N2 AIV shedding using rRT-PCR assay showed a significant increase in RNA copies in Group 1 (1.6510 [ct 28.07] and 2.31910 [ct 27.58]) than Group 2 (1.89 [ct 30.73] and 1.19 [ct 31.91] observed clearly at 7 and 10 days, respectively. in experiment 2, there was a significant increase in RNA copies in Group 5 with copies range in experiment 1, there was a significant increase in group 5 (2, 1.6, and 1.4) than Group 6 (1.5, 1.3 and 1) at 3, 5, and 7 days old with virus shedding extended up to 10 days in Group 5 versus Group 6 only up to 7 days. in experiment 2, there was a significant increase in Group 5 (2.7, 2.3, and 1.5) than Group 6 (2.3, 1.5, and 1) at 3, 5, and 7 days postvaccination, respectively, with virus shedding extended in Group 5 in experiment 1, there was a significant increase in virus shedding in group 5 (2, 1.6, and 1.4) than Group 6 (1.5, 1.3 and 1) at 3, 5, and 7 days old with virus shedding extended up to 10 days in group 5 versus Group 6 only up to 7 days. mixed infection of AIV H9N2 with Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus paragallinarum activated HA of the virus and increased its replication and spread. HPAI viruses have multiple basic amino acids (arginine and lysine) at their HA0 cleavage sites [1,27,28] and appear to be cleavable by ubiquitous proteases. these viruses are able to replicate and spread throughout the bird, damaging vital organs and tissues. live IBV vaccine exacerbates the manifestation of experimental H9N2 AIV infection in broiler chickens [37,38]. live IBV vaccine coinfection may have provided protease enzymes and enhanced H9N2 AIV pathogenicity in this study. the results of HI titer of H9N2 AIV in experiment 2 revealed that H9N2 AIV HI titer was reduced in the group infected with H9N2AIV and vaccinated with both live IBV and NDV vaccines. the results indicated that live NDV vaccine interfered with H9N2 AIV replication and this is in accordance with others [43-45] chickens infected with LPAIV and coinfected with NDV showed mild clinical signs and moderate inflammation in the epithelia of the nasal trachea and air sacs. there was no effect of live NDV vaccine on the severity of lesions caused due to H9N2 AIV.
