{"summary": "surveillance systems that incorporate seasonality and other long-term trends would discover outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI) sooner than systems that only consider the recent past. methods We simulated surveillance systems aimed at discovering modeled influenza outbreaks injected into backgrounds of patients with ARI. the electronic medical record (EMR) includes numerous entries that could combine to facilitate the discovery of individual cases [8, 9] or outbreaks of ARI [10]. a monitoring system rooted in such a comprehensive EMR implementation could provide early insight into outbreak severity and support the flow of information necessary to manage specific patients as well as the overall epidemic [11\u201313]. the s17 and the s33 time series mimic typical surveillance data for ARI such as pneumonia, influenza or influenza-like illness. the synthetic outbreaks \u201c08\u201d (Log Normal) or the \u201c04\u201d (Inverted Log Normal) served as the epidemic signal to be injected. CDA2 was chosen because its use resulted in the highest epidemic detection performance amongst eight (8) alternative ARI case-detection methods [10], illustrating the gains in system performance that could be achieved by combining different EMR data fields compared to using diagnostic codes alone. an 80-day period extracted from a multiyear time series of authentic ARI cases. black circles plot values due to background ARI cases only; red diamonds plot values due to background + injected epidemic cases. the first true positive alarm occurs earlier with 1% FAR (horizontal blue lines in panels B and C) the value of the statistic for each day was stored for subsequent analysis. the 80-day surveillance cycle was repeated, each time shifting the outbreak injection to a different week of the two, one-year study periods. an alarm present in the Combined dataset but absent from the Background-only dataset was considered a \u201ctrue alarm\u201d. Y ( t ) and S(t) are a 7-day moving sample mean and standard deviation calculated with a 2-day lag from the index day. the value of S(t) was replaced by 1 if S(t) 1. the cyclic periods were taken as 364 days [27], 260 days and 104 days for years, weekdays and weekends. a square root transformation was applied to make the data series stationary in both mean and variance. each of the sixteen SARIMA models was used daily to forecast the next day\u2019s case count in their respective times series. each passing day, the models updated themselves to incorporate the latest information into the forecasting procedure. the final SARIMA models for weekday ARI counts were of the form SARIMA (1,0,1)(0,1,1)260. the datasets are provided as supplementary material (S1 File) the datasets are provided as supplementary material (S1 File) the datasets are provided as supplementary material. CDA2 was chosen because its use resulted in the highest epidemic detection performance amongst eight (8) alternative ARI case-detection methods [10], illustrating the gains in system performance that could be achieved by combining different EMR data fields compared to using diagnostic codes alone. the model includes coupled series of differential equations [21] adjusted to describe an epidemic of severe, 1918-like influenza, propagating through a susceptible population. the proportion of community cases presenting to the VA Maryland Health Care System was adjusted to reflect the age, gender, and population estimates of Baltimore veterans. an alarm that originated in the Background-only time series was considered a false alarm. an alarm present in the Combined dataset but absent from the Background-only dataset was considered a \u201ctrue alarm\u201d. the software computed two benchmarks for a given alarm threshold. models were of the form \u201cSARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s\u201d which abbreviates the following equation: P * ( B s ) p ( B s ) ( 1 B s ) d ( 1 B s ) q ( B s ) t, where B is the backshift operator. the cyclic periods were taken as 364 days [27], 260 days and 104 days for years, weekdays and weekends, respectively. a square root transformation was applied to make the data series stationary in both mean and variance. models for the weekend ARI counts were all of the form SARIMA (1,0,1)(0,1,1)104. cases retrieved by CDA3 were low, and did not allow SARIMA modeling. we used case detection algorithms (CDA) previously developed against a manual record review seeking reference ARI cases. we chose the following ARI CDAs: a) CDA1 (sensitivity 63%, positive predictive value (PPV) 13%) retrieved outpatient visits where provider assigned a diagnostic code. Y-axis shows daily case counts (panel A) and corresponding EARS (panel B) and SARIMA statistics (panel C) as a function of time (x-axis) for an 80-day period. the first true positive alarm occurs earlier with SARIMA (day 29, panel C) than with EARS (day 46, panel B). the software began a surveillance cycle on the day when the modeled epidemic signal was injected into a background time series. starting on the injection day, and then daily for a total of 80 days, a statistical outbreak detection method was applied in parallel to the background+epidemic (Combined) time series. the value of the statistic for each day was stored for subsequent analysis. the early aberration reporting system (EARS) W2c [24] made predictions using data from the past 7 days of the relevant time series. seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models used 2\u20134 years of past data. daily case counts were first separated into two time series. t is a sequence of independently distributed random shocks assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero and constant variance 2. p(B) = (1 1B 2B2 qBq) is an autoregressive polynomial of order p for the non-seasonal component; d is the order of the differencing of the non-seasonal component; q(B) = (1 1B 2B2 qBq) is a moving average polynomial of adequacy was assessed by comparing model-generated counts to the actual counts used for model building. each of the sixteen SARIMA models was used daily to forecast the next day\u2019s case count in their respective times series during the study periods. a change around a low FAR produced a greater change in outbreak detection delay than a similar change around a high FAR. the SARIMA method discovered the injected outbreaks faster than EARS did. the timeliness advantage of SARIMA over EARS became increasingly pronounced at any FAR below 2%. EARS-based surveillance exhibited a better performance when using CDA2 for ARI case detection than when using CDA1. compared CDA1 (open black diamonds) to CDA2 (open black squares) across panels A and C (2002\u201303) and B and D (2003\u201304) we avoided the time period immediately following the public announcement of the pandemic. this period contained many visits from worried individuals but only sporadic laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases. during this period, there were peaks in laboratory-based surveillance for pH1N1 in Baltimore, MD, but no corresponding local peak of ARI visits observed in CDC's bioSense syndromic surveillance system. synthetic time series exhibited seasonal increases in case counts typical of ARI. lowering the statistical alarm threshold decreased the time it took to discover the injected outbreak but increased the false-alarm rate (FAR) the relationship between detection delay and the FAR was not linear. surveillance simulations performed over two different one-year time periods. a) 8/2002-7/2003, a year with an average ARI incidence; and b) 8/2003-7/2004, a year with a high seasonal incidence of ARIs. compared CDA1 (open black diamonds) to CDA2 (open black squares) the AMOC curves in Fig 3 suggest that at the commonly used daily FAR of 1%, SARIMA could reduce detection delay by 14\u201316 days for CDA1 and 5 days for CDA2 True alarms at a 3% FAR were issued by SARIMA alone on the days highlighted by red circles, EARS alone (black diamond) or by both SARIMA and EARS (green squares) the first alarm of the time period is recognized by both statistical approaches. we compared a CDA that used diagnostic codes, a staple data type for public health surveillance, to a CDA that took advantage of the EMR to cross-validate diagnostic codes with ARI symptoms documented in related clinical notes. a negative finding for one specific outbreak does not reduce the impetus to design ever more sensitive and specific surveillance systems. the results are confined to our experimental conditions and do not represent the final evolution of our own surveillance system. the CDA- and SARIMA-related gains in detection timeliness may be related to characteristics of the epidemic, to the EMR software itself. the performance of EMR-based systems may be more prone to variations than simpler systems. the file is a compressed folder containing instructions and all files required to run and adjust the epidemic model used in this work."}
