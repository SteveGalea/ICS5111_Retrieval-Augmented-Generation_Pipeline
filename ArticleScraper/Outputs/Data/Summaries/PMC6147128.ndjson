{"summary": "studying animal microbiomes can also help us answer key questions about host evolution and ecology. but the vast majority of studies focus on a narrow range of host taxa. bats are unique among mammals as the only ones capable of powered flight. bats can serve as excellent models for understanding microbiome evolution at both local and landscape scales. some evidence suggests geographically widespread bat species show differences in microbiome structure among local populations. frugivory evolved at least twice, once in the Pteropodidae and at least once in the Phyllostomidae. similar instances of parallel evolutionary diet changes can be found for carnivory and nectarivory. around 70% of mammal diversity is contained in the orders Rodentia, Chiroptera, and Eulipotyphla (hedgehogs, shrews, and allies). understanding the microbiomes of bats can help shed light on their ability to carry out these functions. a few studies have identified potentially pathogenic members of the excreted bat microbiome such as Bartonella spp. (39, 40) and Leptospira spp. (41) bats are also known or suspected to be the reservoir of several viruses that are lethal to humans. bats may transfer microbes to livestock when they exist in close proximity. the host microbiome of bats was enriched with Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas spp., which are known to have antifungal activity. the microbiome of bats can be used more generally to understand the links between the microbiome and the evolution of other phenomena of interest. bat microbiomes are an untapped resource for understanding microbiome evolution in mammals. studies of their microbial symbionts will reveal exciting new roles for microbes in driving host evolution and fitness and may help us to better understand emerging zoonotic pathogens."}
