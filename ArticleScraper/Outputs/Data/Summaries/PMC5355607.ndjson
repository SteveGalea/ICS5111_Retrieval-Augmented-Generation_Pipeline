{"summary": "in 1985, the atomic structure of the first rhinovirus (RV), B14, was published. the protein data bank (PDB) now has records of >70 iterations of RV structures (35 for B14 alone) documenting a myriad of receptor and immunogenic complexes, as well as putative antiviral drug interactions. RV-A and RV-B species cluster as distinct clades in the Enterovirus genus (Picornaviridae), with members sharing >70% amino acid identity over the nonstructural regions of their polyproteins. 77 RV-A and 30 RV-B genotypes currently define 77 genotypes. RV-C Enter rhinovirus C (RV-C) was first described by genome sequencing in 2006 (4) but not physically grown in culture until 2011 (5). the isolates are binned taxonomically using criteria similar to those for RV-A+B. the sequences (and structures) again suggest these types will have nonoverlapping antigenicity. RV-A+B is completely refractive to growth in standard tissue culture. virus discovery quickly found that one could transfect cells with full-length genome RNA, native or recombinant. lack of such display in normal cultured cells precluded virus growth. the asthma susceptibility protein (Tyr529) dominates the cell surface. the asthma-protective protein (Cys529) does not. the RV-C receptor hunt switched focus to the Tyr529 variant. CDHR3 Classical cadherins are multifunctional Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion proteins. primary job is holding cells together through homologous contacts on or between cell surfaces. EC repeats (6 -strands each) orient themselves linearly, in long, slightly curved stalks. modeling algorithms identify 6 EC domains (human sequence, aa 24 to 681), preceded and tailed by common signal (aa 1 to 23), TM (aa 714 to 735), and cytoplasmic units (aa 736 to 885). three motif-anticipated glycosylation sites, asn186 (EC2), asn384 (EC4), and asn624 (EC6), have been confirmed by mass spectroscopy. a relatively rare, but phenotypically dominant, asthma-related A-encoded Tyr529 variant of the CDHR3 gene apparently causes greater RV-C receptor display on the pulmonary cell surfaces of children. a risk allele manifests itself as a measurable virus and asthma susceptibility factor, even for children who are A/G heterozygous (11). the 1000 Genomes Project (www.1000genomes.org) has recorded allele frequencies that range from >95% G (most Asian populations) to >31% A (most African populations), dependent upon specific ancestral lineages. both alleles circulate as part of larger haplotypes on chromosome 7 that may date back 50,000 years. if the observed, devastating effects of RV-C infections on children expressing Tyr529 proteins are any predictor, surely this infectious combination had the lethal potential to shape human evolution."}
