{"summary": "results Of 23,646 suspected cases, 119 (0.5%) were confirmed by laboratory results. these confirmed cases (67.2% of which were males) had a mean age of 43.23 years (SD 22.8) around 42.2% of the confirmed cases were aged between 41 and 60 years and about 47% of confirmed cases had their suspected specimen tested in the summer. to date, the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV, after Saudi Arabia, occurred in south Korea during the period between May and July of 2015. 186 reported cases, 39 deaths, and a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 21% are reported. males with a history of serious medical conditions are highly susceptible to this infection. the mean age of infection in adults is 60 years. a large multicentre study showed that it is nearly impossible to differentiate between patients of MERS-CoV and non-MERS-CoV just on the basis of clinical presentation [16]. identifying suspected cases which have higher chances of diagnosis is necessary to implement preventive strategies to combat the spread of the disease to family members and hospital healthcare workers. study aims to identify demographic markers specific to confirmed cases of MERS-CoV. the nature of these markers has not been investigated in Saudi Arabia. univariate analyses were conducted to estimate the unadjusted contribution. to determine significant factors, a p value below 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval were considered. confirmed case is defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. rRT-PCR results required for at least two specific genomic targets. region upstream and open reading frame1a (upE and ORF1a) logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of confirmation of infection within suspected cases groups. a p value below 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval were considered. a p value below 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval were considered. a confirmed case is defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection [20]. a confirmed case is defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. a confirmed case is defined based on the age group, clinical presentation, and epidemiologic links. d Case A confirmed case is defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection [20]. results 3.1. Demographics of Suspected Cases A total of 23,646 of MERS-CoV suspected cases were included in this study. around 25.2% of such cases eventually died due to MERS-CoV. the risk of MERS-CoV was significantly higher during the summer and spring seasons. logistic regression model of MERS-CoV among suspected and confirmed cases. reference Univariate Multivariate P value OR 95% CI for OR Lower Upper Upper Male Female 0.001 1.875 1.278 2.752 0.001 1.882 1.280 2.765 Age 20\u201340 y Age 0\u201319 y 0.013 3.684 1.319 10.294 0.036 3.026 1.075 8.516 Age 41\u201360 y Age 0\u201319 y 0.00 the highest prevalence of MERS-CoV infected cases (41.2%) was seen in the age group 41\u201360 years. around 25.2% of such cases eventually died due to MERS-CoV. the risk of MERS-CoV was significantly higher during the summer (A.OR: 3.046, 95% CI: 1.053\u20138.12, P value = 0.040) in the age category above 61 years, it increased threefold as compared with the 0\u201319 years old group. the risk of MERS-CoV was significantly higher during the summer (A.OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.83\u20136.19, P value = 0.001) as compared with that in the total of 23,646 suspected cases were confirmed via laboratory results. all the confirmed cases are reported to MOH through HESN. odds of infection among males were twice as high as that of females. in 2016, only 9 of 552 cases (1.6%) of MERS-CoV infection were found among pediatric patients. the study which was conducted across the Gulf countries between 2012 and 2016 did not report any MERS-CoV cases among children. this low predictive value in the lab results is related to the high burden of false positive cases referred to the lab. no one has developed a logistic regression that focuses on demographic risk factors such as sex, age, and seasons prior to our study. but further investigations are needed to confirm our findings. all suspected and confirmed cases were included in this study. we assume that our results are generalizable for both the regions with confidence. this study is about predictors for the confirmation of diagnosis among suspected cases only. data Availability The laboratory data used to support the findings of this study were provided by Riyadh Regional Laboratory under license and are not freely available. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
