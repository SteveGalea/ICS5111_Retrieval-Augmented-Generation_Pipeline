{"summary": "the peroxisome is a ubiquitous organelle of eukaryotic cells that participate in a wide variety of metabolic processes. the mechanism of peroxisome biogenesis has yet to be elucidated, and there is no cogent model for the genesis of this organelle. peroxisomes catalyze translocation of proteins across the peroxisome membrane. mutations in at least 12 different PEX genes can cause ZS. mutations in a number of different PEX genes can cause ZS. PMPs lack recognizable PTS1- or PTS2-like features. most pex mutants that disrupt matrix protein import have no effect on PMP import. human PEX19 is a predominantly cytoplasmic PMP-binding protein. plasmids pcDNA3-PEX10, pcDNA3-PEX10myc, pcDNA3-PEX11, pcDNA3-PEX11myc, and pcDNA3-PEX12myc. plasmids pcDNA3-PEX3, pcDNA3-PEX14, pcDNA3-PEX34, pcDNA1/Amp-PMP70, pcDNA plasmids pcDNA3-PMP70myc, pcDNA3-C395PMP70myc, pcDNA3-C476PMP70myc, pcDNA3-C558PMP70myc, pcDNA3-C578PMP70myc, and pcDNA3-C598PMP70myc were created by amplifying the appropriate regions of the human PMP70 cDNA with oli myc were created by transferring the coding regions of each clone into the bacterial expression vector, pT7-His. for all plasmids, any regions generated by PCR were sequenced to ensure the absence of any unintended mutations. the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 5 ml of buffer A containing 35S-labeled PMPs that had been synthesized in vitro, washed, and exposed to film. all 6xHis-tagged proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria as described. monoclonal mouse anti-myc antibodies were obtained from the tissue culture supernatant of the hybridoma 1-9E10 (Evan et al. 1985), guinea pig anti\u2013PMP70 antibodies were raised against the COOH-terminal 18 amino acids of human PMP70. secondary antibodies were obtained from commercial sources. codenz centrifugation and assay of marker enzymes were performed as described previously using a 15\u201345% Nycodenz gradient. a rat liver was homogenized, a postnuclear supernatant was generated, and then spun at 25,000 g for 30 min. equal proportions of the resulting homogenate, supernatants, and pellets were processed for immunoblot with anti\u2013PEX19 antibodies. pPC86/LEU2-PEX19 was created by appending a DNA fragment encoding the sequence MDKAEFLEAPKKKRKVEDPRNSSSVPGDPL upstream of the PEX19 ORF in pcDNA3 (NLS underlined) the plasmids pcDNA3-PEX10, pcDNA3-PEX10, pcDNA3-PEX10myc (Warren et al. 1998), the plasmids pJL59W-PEX10, pJL59W-PEX11, pJL59W-PEX12, and pJL59W-PEX13 contain the ORF of each gene in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of pJL59W. the plasmids pcDNA3myc, pcDNA3-C395PMP70myc, pcDNA3-C plasmids pcDNA3-N119PEX11myc, pcDNA3-N180PEX11myc, pcDNA3-N210PEX11myc, pcDNA3-C231PEX14myc, and pcDNA3-C270PEX14myc were all created in similar fashion. all plasmids were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 d, transferred to BA-85 membranes. membrane was incubated for 2 h with 5 ml of buffer A containing 35S-labeled PMPs that had been synthesized in vitro, washed, and exposed to film. membranes containing 5 g of each protein were blocked as before. the labeled PMP bound was detected using a PhosphorImager. all 6xHis-tagged proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria. all 6xHis-tagged proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria. the cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using established protocols (Dodt and Gould 1996) and antibodies specific for catalase, which is a peroxisomal matrix protein. a rat liver was homogenized, a postnuclear supernatant was generated, and then spun at 25,000 g for 30 min. this supernatant was removed and subjected to further centrifugation at 200,000 g for 1 h. we used the yeast two-hybrid assay as a crude screen to identify candidate PEX19-binding proteins. full-length human PEX19 was expressed as a GAL4 AD fusion and screened against a panel of GAL4 DNA BD fusions to all 14 known human PEX proteins. Yeast strains expressing the GAL4 transcription activating domain (AD) or an AD-PEX19 fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) were grown on filters, lysed, and assayed for LacZ activity using the indicator substrate X-gal. purified recombinant 6xHis-PEX19 and 6xHis-XECI were resolved by SDS-PAGE. recombinant PEX19 bound PEX12 and PEX13. two of the PMPs that interacted with PEX19 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. PEX19 also bound three other peroxin PMPs that do not participate in peroxisome biogenesis. the ability of PEX19 to bind recombinant PEX14 was determined by blotting with affinity-purified anti\u2013PEX14 antibodies. the ability of PEX19 to bind recombinant PEX14 was determined by blotting with affinity-purified anti\u2013PEX14 antibodies. excess unlabeled PEX14 effectively competed labeled PEX14 from PEX19. but excess PTE1 had no effect on PEX19-PEX14 binding. PEX19-PMP binding is saturable. wild-type PEX19 accumulates in the cytoplasm when overexpressed. but a form of PEX19 containing a nuclear localization signal is instead targeted to the nucleus. normal human fibroblasts were cotransfected with plasmids designed to express a variety of epitope-tagged PMPs. targeting PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of PMPs. human fibroblasts expressing the myc-tagged PMPs PEX14 (D\u2013F), PMP34 (G\u2013I), ALDP (J\u2013L), PEX3 (M\u2013O), PEX11 (P\u2013R), or PEX12 (S\u2013U) were also stained with DAPI (AA) PTE1 was imported into peroxisomes regardless of NLS/PEX19 expression. similar results were observed for PECI, another peroxisomal matrix protein. also, NLS/PEX19 did not affect the distribution of PMPs already had been imported into peroxisomes. the first 101, 81, or 61 amino acids of PMP70 are also able to mediate peroxisomal targeting but only at reduced efficiency. these shorter pieces of PMP70 were localized to both peroxisomes and mitochondria. the positive identification of the tubulovesicular structures as mitochondria was confirmed by colocalization with a mitochondrial marker. the COOH-terminal 78 amino acids of this 259\u2013amino acid-long protein were sufficient for both peroxisomal localization and interaction with PEX19. the COOH-terminal 49 amino acids of this protein were also directed to the peroxisome, though at reduced efficiency. epitope-tagged forms of PEX14 were generated and subcellular distributions were determined by immunofluorescence. full-length PEX14 was efficiently imported into peroxisomes, but a fragment of PEX14, containing amino acids 1\u2013108, did not associate with peroxisomes. normal human fibroblasts expressing PEX14myc (B and C), C231PEX14myc (D and E), or C270PEX14myc (F and G) were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for the myc epitope tag and PMP70. the presence of PEX19 in purified peroxisomes was confirmed by blotting a sample of purified peroxisomes. a small amount of PEX19 pellets at 25,000 g can be pelleted at high speed. a postnuclear supernatant of rat liver was fractionated by centrifugation on a 15\u201345% Nycodenz gradient. fibroblasts were transfected with pcDNA3 (E), pcDNA3-PEX19 (F), or pcDNA3-PEX19/C296A (G) and processed by immunofluorescence using antibodies to catalase and the appropriate secondary antibodies. most PEX19 was released at concentrations that also released LDH from the cell, supporting the hypothesis that significant amounts of PEX19 reside in the cytoplasm. PEX19 is farnesylated via the cysteine residue at position 296, and is therefore unable to accept the farnesyl moiety. we transfected a PEX19-deficient human fibroblast cell line with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-PEX19, and pcDNA3-PEX19/C296A. we assessed the ability of each plasmid to restore peroxisome biogenesis in these cells. PEX19-deficient cells lack detectable PMP70-containing structures. similar results were observed when these cells were stained with antibodies specific for the integral PMPs PEX13 and PEX11. but not all PMPs were undetectable in PEX19-deficient cells. a subset of PMPs localizes to mitochondria in PEX19-deficient cells. the distribution of endogenous PEX14 was determined in wild-type (A) and PBD399 (B) fibroblasts using antibodies specific to the myc epitope. the distribution of endogenous PEX14 was determined in wild-type (A) and PBD399 (B) fibroblasts. PEX11 is thought to act in matrix protein import downstream of receptor docking. PEX10 and PEX12 act in matrix protein import downstream of receptor docking. negative results in this assay can be caused by a variety of nonspecific problems. purified recombinant PEX19, washed, probed with affinity-purified anti\u2013PEX14 antibodies, and detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent detection. recombinant PEX19 bound PEX12 and PEX13, two of the PMPs that interacted with PEX19. PEX19 does not bind peroxisomal matrix proteins, shown here by its inability to bind peroxisomal enoyl-CoA isomerase. PEX19 was also unable to bind to integral membrane proteins of other organelles, including an integral plasma membrane protein (VSV-G; Adams and Rose 1985) blot overlay assay also used to examine thermodynamic parameters of PEX19-PMP binding. recombinant PEX19 was incubated with various concentrations of recombinant PEX14 spiked with 35S-labeled PEX14. the amount of PEX14 bound at each concentration was determined and plotted versus 6xHis-PEX14 concentration using a PhosphorImager. membranes containing 1 g of immobilized 6xHis-PEX19 were incubated with 35S-PEX14 or 35S-PEX3 in buffer A (left lanes) and buffer A containing 10 M 6xHis-PTE1 (middle lanes) PEX14myc was imported into peroxisomes in cells cotransfected with pcDNA3-NLS/PEX19. this PMP was never detected in the nucleus in the absence of NLS/PEX19 expression. this PMP was never detected in the nucleus in the absence of NLS/PEX19 expression. pcDNA3 (Y) or pcDNA3-NLS/PEX19 (Z and AA) were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal anti\u2013myc antibodies with appropriate secondary antibodies. fibroblasts transfected with pcDNA3 (Y) were also stained with DAPI (AA) the ability of PEX19 to bind PMPs of diverse function implicates PEX19 in the biogenesis of PMPs. the integral PMPs, PMP70, PEX11 and PEX14, were chosen for these studies. PEX19 binds the peroxisomal targeting element of PMP70. full-length PMP70 is shown at the top, and predicted transmembrane domains are shown in black boxes. normal human fibroblasts expressing the PMP70 mutant constructs were cotransfected with either vector alone (B, C, F, and G) or pcDNA3-NLS/PEX19 (D, E, H, and I) normal human fibroblasts were transfected with pcDNA3-N180/PEX11 (B-E) or pcDNA3-N210/PEX11 (F\u2013I) and cotransfected with a vector control (B, C, F, and G) or pcDNA3-NLS/PEX19 (D, E, H, and I) unlabeled full-length PEX14 effectively displaced labeled PEX14 at a concentration of 10 M, as expected. the mutant containing amino acids 1\u2013147 of PEX14 showed weak competition at 10 M. the fragment of PEX14 that was not transported to peroxisomes failed to compete labeled PEX14 from PEX19 at all three concentrations. a rat liver postnuclear supernatant was separated by Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation, assayed for marker enzymes of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and cytosol. a small amount of PEX19 pellets at 25,000 g, as expected for a peroxisome-associated protein, and the PEX19 present in the 25,000-g supernatant cannot be pelleted at high speed. peroxisomal marker (catalase, solid line), mitochondrial marker (succinate dehydrogenase, dotted line) and cytoplasmic marker (lactate dehydrogenase, dashed line) are shown. the abundance of PEX19 in each fraction was determined by immunoblot. rat liver peroxisomes were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblot. s were incubated with varying amounts of digitonin, which preferentially permeabilizes the plasma membrane. most PEX19 was released at concentrations that also released LDH from the cell. it should be noted that 20% of LDH activity and 30\u201340% of PEX19 were released only after the addition of 1% Triton X-100. the mutation had only a mild effect on PEX19 activity. it reduced it to 80% the activity of wild-type PEX19. therefore, it appears that farnesylation has an ancillary effect on PEX19 function. tagged derivatives of several integral PMPs introduced by transfection. these included the integral PMPs PEX12 (Fig. 9, D\u2013F) and ALDP (Fig. 9, G\u2013I) similar mitochondrial mislocalization was observed when PEX13 and PEX11 were overexpressed in the PEX19-deficient cells of the yeast Pichia pastoris. the peroxisomal nature of the punctate structures in wild-type fibroblasts was confirmed by double label with anti\u2013PMP70 antibodies (data not shown). the peroxisomal nature of the punctate structures in wild-type fibroblasts was confirmed by double label with anti\u2013PMP70 antibodies. the import of nuclear-encoded peroxisomal proteins is a critical aspect of peroxisome biogenesis. PEX19 failed to bind peroxisomal matrix proteins or integral membrane proteins that reside in the plasma, Golgi, or mitochondrial membranes. the interaction between PEX19 and these same same seven PMPs was also tested in an independent PEX19-binding assay. we observed interaction of PEX19 with nine human PMPs in at least two independent assays. the results are difficult to interpret in the absence of controls for the expression, folding, and nuclear targeting of the various GAL4BD-PMP fusion proteins. if true, we would expect regions of PMPs that were sufficient for targeting to peroxisomes would retain the ability to bind PEX19. we found that the first 61 amino acids of PMP70 (10% of the protein) are sufficient for peroxisomal localization and that this same segment of PMP70 retained the ability to interact with PEX19. we also used a more quantitative method for the analysis of PEX14-PEX19 binding. biologically defined PMP targeting signals are likely to include signals for two potentially distinct processes: targeting, which may involve the recognition by a PMP receptor, and retention, which may require insertion of the protein into the peroxisome membrane. the targeting elements we identified in PMP70, PEX11, and PEX14 all contained a putative transmembrane domain. this is particularly true for PEX3 since previous studies have localized a low efficiency PMP targeting element to within the first 40 amino acids of this PMP. this is particularly true for PEX3 since previous studies have localized a low efficiency PMP targeting element to within the first 40 amino acids of this PMP. a large population of cytosolic, soluble PEX19 is cytoplasmic. a similar bimodal distribution has been observed for yeast forms of PEX19. a similar bimodal distribution has been observed for yeast forms of PEX19. PEX19 binds to a diverse array of PMPs, including metabolite transporters and peroxins. PEX19 is a predominantly cytoplasmic, partly peroxisomal protein. loss of PEX19 results in absence of detectable peroxisomal structures. in this model, peroxisomes are defined as vesicles that contain a normal or nearly normal complement of PMPs. preperoxisomal vesicles are defined as vesicles that either lack PMPs altogether or have only one or a small number of PMPs. PEX19 is a predominantly cytoplasmic PMP-binding protein with an important role in PMP biogenesis. the binding activity of PEX19 appeared to be specific for PMPs as PEX19 failed to bind peroxisomal matrix proteins or integral membrane proteins that reside in the plasma, Golgi, or mitochondrial membranes. in this second assay, PEX19 interacted with 14 human PMPs. we observed interaction of PEX19 with nine human PMPs in the yeast two-hybrid assay. if true, we would expect that regions of PMPs that were sufficient for targeting to peroxisomes would retain the ability to bind PEX19. the analysis of PEX11 provided similar results, with the COOH-terminal 49 amino acids of PEX11 being sufficient for both targeting and interaction with PEX19. we have encountered similar problems during searches for targeting signals in the PMPs PMP34, PEX12, and PEX13. the difficulty in identifying concise PMP targeting signals lies in the nature of protein targeting assays. however, it is difficult to envision how PMPs could be retained unless they were inserted into the peroxisome membrane. the only PMP targeting signal in the literature that meets this criteria is the mPTS of C. boidinii PMP47 (Dyer et al. 1996). we considered testing whether PEX19 recognized this mPTS, but found that this signal is not sufficient for peroxisomal membrane targeting in human cells. we detected interactions between PEX19 and these two proteins. PEX16 reflects our view that such studies will be extremely important not only for what they will tell us about general PEX19\u2013PMP interactions. however, the analysis of targeting elements and PEX19-binding sites in PMPs that are not required for peroxisome membrane synthesis are likely to yield data that relate only to the general role of PEX19 binding in PMP biogenesis. X19 from peroxisomes without disturbing peroxisome integrity in general. we used site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate the farnesylation site. high activity also has been reported for an analogous CAAX box mutant. X19 may represent a steady state view of a cycling PMP-binding protein. it facilitates early steps in PMP biogenesis, either as a chaperone or as a PMP receptor. existing data on peroxisome biogenesis in human cells are consistent with the ability of cells to generate peroxisomes in two ways. the results of this study do not directly address this question. but it is worth noting that our results offer no clear support for an ER role in peroxisome membrane synthesis. we failed to observe accumulation of any PMPs in the ER in the absence of PEX19."}
