{"summary": "ANNOUNCEMENT Penaeus semisulcatus and Marsupenaeus japonicas are the two native shrimp species in Egypt cultured since the 1980s. laboratory diagnosis revealed the presence of Penaeus stylirostris densovirus 1 (PstDNV1), hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV), yellow head virus (YHV) and gill-associated virus (GAV) a pairwise comparison of PstDNV1-Egypt isolates to the reference strain showed 92.33% to 100% identity. the genome sizes of 10 HPV-Egypt isolates varied from 5,685 to 6,336 nt. YHV-Egypt showed 100% identity to an Australian isolate. the genome of GAV-Egypt was 26,253 nt, containing 4 ORFs (12) ORF1a contains a 3C-like protease (nt 8535 to 9386) domain. ORF1b contains an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase motif (nt 14252 to 15007) and a helicase domain (nt 16136 to 1751 KT316249, KT316250, KT316251, KT316252, KT316253, KT316254, KT316256, KT316257, KT316258, KT316259, and KT316260 for PstDNV1. KT316279 for YHV; KT316278 for YHV; KT316278 for YHV."}
