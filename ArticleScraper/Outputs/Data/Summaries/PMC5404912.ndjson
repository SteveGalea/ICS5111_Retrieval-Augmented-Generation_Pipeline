{"summary": "adenosine deaminase acting on dsRNA (ADAR1) isoforms neutralize the immunostimulatory activity of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by converting adenosine to inosine (i.e., A-to-I editing) the modifications suppress the cellular responses to dsRNA and prevent to type I IFN production. mutation of either MDA5 or MAVS rescues the embryonic lethal phenotype of Adar1 knockout (KO) mice. ADAR1 also antagonizes the IFN-inducible dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase, PKR, by altering the structure of dsRNA and thereby preventing both PKR activation and phosphorylation of its substrate protein eIF2. our results suggest that the RNase L activation is the primary mode of cell death induced by either endogenous or exogenous dsRNA. in the absence of ADAR1 dsRNA can be recognized by (1) MDA5 leading to IFN production; (2) OAS leading to activation of RNase L and eventually translational inhibition and apoptosis. cells lacking RNase L expression were resistant to cell death at treatment with up to 5 g/ml of pIC while treatment of PKR KO or MAVS KO cells with 0.5 g/ml of pIC promoted cell death. we compared the kinetics of pIC-induced cell death with the same set of cells in real time with an IncuCyte Live Cell Imaging System and software. genes Primers nucleotide sequences (5\u20193\u2019) are indicated as bold and italic. ADAR1 KO cells were rescued from RNASE L KO or MAVS KO but not from WT or PKR KO A549 cells. proteins in cell lysates were separated by 12% SDS/PAGE, transferred to PVDF-membranes, and probed with antibodies to detect total eIF2 or phosphorylated eIF2. mRNA encoding the IFN inducible p150 isoform and constitutively expressed p110 isoform are indicated. pIC attenuates pIC induced cell death and accelerates cell migration. four separate wells were treated with each experimental condition and a minimum of 4 image fields were analyzed per well. a minimum of 2 image fields (>1000 cells per well total) were analyzed per well. similar data were obtained from two independent experiments. PR/Cas9 and sgRNA4 directed at Exon 1 of ADAR1 within the coding regions of p110 and p150. the clones in which ADAR1 remained intact were apparently derived from cells in which the CRISRP/Cas9 targeting vector failed to mutate ADAR1. however, using RNASEL KO or MAVS KO A549 cells and similar lentivirus delivery of sgRNA4 we were able to recover WT sgADAR1-6 p150 KO 24 12 sgADAR1-4 NA* 17 0 MAVS KO sgADAR1-6 MAVS-p150 KO 24 8 sgADAR1-4 MAVS-ADAR1 DKO 23 8 RNASEL KO sgADAR1-4 RNASEL-ADAR1 DKO 24 2 PKR KO sgADAR1-4 NA 24 0 WT NS2 sgADAR1-4 NS2-ADA either WT RNase L or inactive mutant (R667A) RNase L and dead and total cells assessed in the IncuCyte system. a minimum of four separate wells were treated with each experimental condition. your browser is not supporting the HTML5 video> element. You may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice. dsRNA leads to RNase L activation thus accelerating cell death. as a control, we constructed a cell line expressing an inactive mutant NS2H126R, unable to antagonize RNase L due to loss of its ability to cleave 2-5A. second clone (C7) of NS2-ADAR1 KO cells showed similar phenotype. expression of the MHV NS2 RNase L antagonist activity can rescue ADAR1 KO A549 cells. ADAR1 KO NS2 expressing cells (clone C7) or WT NS2 expressing cells were transfected with siRNA targeting NS2 (siNS2-1, siNS2-2) or GFP(siGFP). at 48 hr post treatment cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. IFN treatment of ADAR1 KO cells upregulated ISG expression and further induced IFN by endogenous dsRNA. this was most evident in RNASEL-ADAR1 DKO cells, which retained MAVS. rRNA remained intact in WT, RNASEL KO or MAVS KO cells. tRNA-His cleavage was readily observed using a quantitative RT-PCR assay in IFN-treated MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells. but not in IFN-treated cells, which lack RNase L activity. elife-25687-fig6-data1.xlsx (36KB, xlsx) DOI: 10.7554/eLife.25687.021 Figure 7. RNase L activation following IFN treatment of ADAR1 KO cells. cells were treated with 200 U/ml of IFN- or infected with Sindbis virus (SINV) lentivirus delivered CRISPR/Cas9 and single-guide (sg)RNA (Table 1) to construct A549 cell lines with disruption of genes encoding each of these proteins, RNASEL KO, MAVS KO, PKR KO cells as well as MAVS-RNASEL double knockout (DKO) RNASEL KO or RNASEL-MAVS DKO showed accelerated wound healing in monolayer scratch assays compared with MAVS KO and WT cells, all of which retained RNase L. human mammary epithelial cells were also protected from pIC-induced cell death by ablation of RNase L expression. ADAR1 KO cells were rescued from RNASE L KO or MAVS KO but not from WT or PKR KO A549 cells. PKR expression was induced 1.6\u20131.9 fold following IFN treatment. the mRNA encoding the IFN inducible p150 isoform and constitutively expressed p110 isoform are indicated. the sgRNA6 targeting exon1 of p150 and the sgRNA4 targeting exon1 of p110 were used to knockout expression of p150 or both p150 and p110 respectively. cells were transfected with 20 ng/ml of pIC and caspase-3/7 activity was determined using an IncuCyte system. a minimum of 4 image fields (>10000 cells per well) were analyzed per well. KO of RNASEL and dsRNA sensors MAVS and PKR could rescue ADAR1 KO cells from lethal effects of dsRNA. lentivirus delivered CRISPR/Cas9 and sgRNA4 directed at Exon 1 of ADAR1 within the coding regions of p110 and p150. clones in which ADAR1 remained intact were apparently derived from cells in which the CRISRP/Cas9 targeting vector failed to kinetics of cell death following treatment with exogenous pIC are similar in RNASEL KO and RNASEL-ADAR1 DKO or MAVS KO and MAVS-ADAR1 DKO. we compared the kinetics of cell death in response to pIC transfection of these DKO cells. expression of WT RNase L promotes death of RNASEL-ADAR1 KO cells. four separate wells were treated with each experimental condition. a minimum of 4 image fields (>10000 cells per well) were analyzed per well. RNase L promotes lethality of ADAR1 KO cells in absence of exogenous dsRNA. transduced RNASEL KO and RNASEL-ADAR1 DKO cells with lentiviruses expressing either WT RNase L or inactive mutant RNase LR667A.

ADAR1 KO or WT A549 NS2 expressing cells were transfected with siRNAs against NS2 (siNS2-1 and siNS2-2) or siRNA against GFP (siGFP) and (b) 96 hr later cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet or (c) 72 hr later lysed and analyzed by Western immunoblotting. RNASEL-ADAR1 and MAVS-ADAR1 cells are deficient in expression of the ADAR1 p150 isoform (Figure 2a) previously reported in the mouse system to be responsible for the editing of RNA that activates MAVS or MDA5. this was most evident in RNASEL-ADAR1 and MAVS-ADAR1 cells described above. rRNA remained intact in WT, RNASEL KO or MAVS KO cells. highly specific and characteristic RNase L-mediated rRNA degradation products were observed in IFN-treated ADAR1 p150 KO, MAVS-ADAR1 p150 DKO, or MAVS-ADAR1 DKO cells. interferon (IFN) and interferon stimulated gene expression following IFN treatment of ADAR1 KO cells. cells were mock treated or treated with 200 U/ml of IFN- and cells were lysed and 2-5A quantified using a FRET based assay. cells were harvested at MOI = 1 and at 48 hr post treatment or 24 hr post infection, cells were harvested, total RNA was extracted and resolved on RNA chips on a Bioanalyzer. RNA was extracted and specific cleavages at tRNA-His-36 were quantified. PKR ablation was unable to rescue either adar1 KO mouse embryo lethality. it is possible that in the mouse embryo system, RNase L, activated downstream of MDA5-MAVS also contributes to embryonic lethality. however, rescue of lethality due to adar1 KO may be due to one or more other MAVS dependent activities. a potent RNase L antagonist enables recovery of viable ADAR1 KO cells while knockdown of NS2 in ADAR1 KO cells leads to cell death. it has been shown that RNase L site-specifically cleaves tRNAs and Y-RNAs, and that depletion of the Y-RNA RNY1 contributes to apoptosis (Donovan et al., 2016). dsRNA is the only well-established activator of OAS enzymatic activity. dsRNA is the only well-established activator of OAS enzymatic activity. dsRNA is the only well-established activator of OAS enzymatic activity. mutation of ADAR1 leads to self-dsRNA activation of cGAS. mutations affecting homologous nucleic acid sensors in the IFN system lead to AGS. hTERT-HME1 cells were authenticated by STR analysis by ATCC. 293 T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. cells tested negative for mycoplasma at university of Pennsylvania or the Cleveland Clinic. goat anti-mouse antibody (1:5000, Santa Cruz) and goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:3000, Cell Signaling) conjugated with HRP(Horseradish peroxidase) oligonucleotide sequences to be used for generation of single guide RNAs (sgRNA) are listed in Table 1 and their positions of sgRNA4 and sgRNA6 in the ADAR1 gene are shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1. cells were transduced with Lenti-sgADAR1-4 for knocking out ADAR1 p150 expression. cells were selected for puromycin resistance and cloned by previous methods. mutant cells were verified by PCR using primers listed in Table 2.
