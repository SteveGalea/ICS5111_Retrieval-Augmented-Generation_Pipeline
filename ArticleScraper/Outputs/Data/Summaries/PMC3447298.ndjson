{"summary": "CVT-E002 (COLD-FX\u00ae), a patented poly-furanosyl-pyranosyl-saccharide-based extract of panax quinquefolius, is known to have immunomodulatory properties. a therapy that can enhance the anti-influenza response in influenza-vaccinated seniors would be of therapeutic benefit in this population. the study was the first to assess the impact of CVT-E002 dose on efficacy. it was hypothesized that regular supplementation of CVT-E002 during influenza season would maintain immune stimulation. it was also hypothesized a dose response would be observed resulting in improved efficacy of 800 mg/d of CVT-E002 over that observed with 400 mg/d. participants included those seasonally vaccinated for influenza who were available for follow-up visits. subjects with the following medical conditions excluded: HIV infection, malignancy, unstable cardiovascular disease, renal abnormalities, pulmonary disease, acute or active chronic liver disease, active tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, bleeding disorders. a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained by the study coordinator within 5 days of the onset of URI symptoms and tested for influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. participants were contacted weekly during the study to ensure adherence to the study protocol. subjects completed daily logs of severity of their URI-related symptoms on a scale of 0\u20133 (0 = no symptom, 1 = mild symptom\u2014no change in daily activities, 2 = moderate symptom\u2014some decrease in ability to carry out daily activities, and 3 = severe symptom\u2014confined to home or bed) subjects completed their daily logs at approximately the same time each day. URIs were evaluated using a validated symptom self-assessment tool. subjects were considered to have a Jackson-confirmed URI if the TSS over two successive days was greater than or equal to 14. at least one of the following symptoms was present. study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm trial. influenza-vaccinated, community-dwelling seniors were recruited through four different health regions in Canada. participants included those seasonally vaccinated for influenza. subjects with the following medical conditions excluded: HIV infection, malignancy, unstable cardiovascular disease, renal abnormalities, pulmonary disease, acute or active chronic liver disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, multiple sclerosis, bleeding disorders, or planned surgery over the course of the trial. subjects with a history of alcohol/drug abuse or known allergies to ginseng were not allowed to participate. a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained by the study coordinator within 5 days of the onset of URI symptoms and tested for influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. participants were contacted weekly during the study to ensure adherence to the study protocol. URI Assessments During an URI, subjects completed a daily log of the severity of their URI-related symptoms on a scale of 0\u20133 (0 = no symptom, 1 = mild symptom\u2014no change in daily activities, 2 = moderate symptom\u2014some decrease in ability to carry out daily activities, and 3 = severe symptom\u2014confined to home or bed) subjects completed their daily logs at approximately the same time each day. a total of 260 subjects per group were enrolled, resulting in a total sample size of 780 subjects. all randomized subjects who had received at least one dose of study medication were included in the primary efficacy analysis. between-group comparisons were made using the log-rank statistic. a total of 783 volunteers were recruited from 4 centers across canada. 264, 264, and 255 received placebo, CVT-E002 400 mg/day, and CVT-E002 800 mg/day. 145 subjects (19.4%), 56 (22.1%) in placebo group, 39 (15.7%) in CVT-E002-400 group, and 50 (20.3%) in CVT-E002-800 group withdrew from the study. CVT-E002 groups are significantly greater than placebo groups in the ITT population. the 6-month rate of lab-confirmed-clinical URIs in the ITT group was found to be 5.5%, 5.2%, and 4.6%. the rate of laboratory-confirmed-clinical URIs was found to be 6.1%, 4.3%, and 4.6% in the placebo, CVT-E002-400, and CVT-E002-800 group, respectively. the infection rates for the individual viruses tested in the study were found to be similar among the groups, with no statistically significant between-group differences seen. overall between-group comparison of infection rates, and severity and duration of URIs. cBetween-group comparisons made using chi-square test for comparing proportions. cBetween-group comparisons made using chi-square test for comparing proportions. the proportion of subjects in the ITT group (n = 748) with Jackson-confirmed URIs was 26.7% in the placebo group, 21.8% in the CVT-E002-400 group, and 19.3% in the CVT-E002-800 group (P 0.23, Table 2). both doses of CVT-E002 were found to significantly reduce the number of these URIs. a total of 36 subjects (4.8%) experienced serious adverse events during the study. 12 (4.7%) in the placebo group experienced serious adverse events. 6 were possibly related to study medication. treatment codes were broken for 2 subjects, one in the placebo group and one in the CVT-E002-400 group. the treatment codes were broken for 2 subjects, one in the placebo group and one in the CVT-E002-400 group. 13.8%) 0.917 Renal/genitourinary 5 (2.0%) 8 (3.2%) 4 (1.6%) 0.460 Serious adverse events Total number of serious adverse events 13 14 10 Any serious adverse event 12 (4.7%) 14 (5.6.0%) 10 (4.1%) 0.719 Serious adverse event by category Cardiovascular 4 (1.6%) 4 (1.6%) 2 (0.8%) 0.784 Dermatology 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.4%) 0.329 Gastrointestinal 5 (2.0%) 3 participants Characteristics Following the screening process a total of 783 volunteers were recruited from 4 centers across Canada. 264, 264, and 255 received placebo, CVT-E002 400 mg/day, and CVT-E002 800 mg/day, respectively. 145 subjects (19.4%), 56 (22.1%) in placebo group, 39 (15.7%) in CVT-E002-400 group, and 50 (20.3%) in CVT-E002-800 group withdrew from the CVT-E002 800 mg (n = 246) Age (years) [232] 71.3 (5.5) [244] 71.4 (5.5) [233] 71.6 (7.5) Sex\u2014female 135/253 (53.4%) 143/249 (57.4%) 108/246 (43.9%) Smoker 12/251 (4.8%) 15/246 (6.1%) 16/243 (6.6%) Weight (kg) [243] 75.9 (14.3) [241] 75.0 (15. the infection rates for the individual viruses tested in the study were found to be similar among the groups, with no statistically significant between-group differences seen. overall between-group comparison of infection rates, and severity and duration of URIs. placebo versus 400 mg, P 0.04; 800 mg, P 0.03; 400 mg versus 800 mg, P 0.92. placebo versus 400 mg, P 0.06; 800 mg, P 0.05; 400 mg versus 800 mg, P 0.89. placebo versus 400 mg, P 0.04; 400 mg versus 800 mg, P 0.92. a previous study showed that efficacy of CVT-E002 was only apparent in the final 8 weeks of a 16-week treatment period [6], an analysis was completed including only those participants who had completed the entire course of study. the 180-day rate of Jackson-confirmed URIs was found to be 28.9% in the placebo group, 20.0% in the CVT-E002-400 group, and 19.4% in the CVT-E002-800 group (P 0.04) there were no among-group differences except for cardiovascular adverse events. a total of 36 subjects experienced serious adverse events during the study. 12 (4.7%) in the placebo group. -E002-800 (n = 249) Adverse events Total number of adverse events 215 220 216 Any adverse event 117 (46.3%) 122 (49.0%) 119 (48.4%) 0.811 Adverse event by category Allergy 2 (0.8%) 0 (0.0%) 2 (0.8%) 0.478 Blood 1 (0.4%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) >0.999 Cardiovascular 17 (6.7%) 6 (2.4%) 0.784 Dermatology 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.4%) 0.329 Gastrointestinal 5 (2.0%) 3 (1.2%) 2 (0.8%) 0.623 Hemorrhage 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.4%) 0 (0.0%) 0.662 Musculoskeletal 1 (0.4%) 2 (0.8%) 1 (0.4%) 0.849 Neurology 1 (0.4%) 2 (0.8%) 0 (0.0%) 0.550 Oncology 1 (0.4%) 0 (0.0%) the present study was designed to evaluate possible dose-related effects of CVT-E002 when administered to influenza-vaccinated, otherwise healthy, community-dwelling seniors. subjects with a seasonal immunization against influenza were recruited to determine if CVT-E002 supplementation would provide additional prophylaxis to that provided by the vaccine. the results indicate that regular supplementation of CVT-E002 during winter months was effective in reducing the number of Jackson-confirmed respiratory infections the design of this clinical trial was based on designs used to study products with direct impact on the virus. increasing knowledge about the mechanism of action of CVT-E002 has led to the understanding that CVT-E002 belongs to a new therapeutic class of polymolecular botanical drugs that impact the host immune system rather than the virus. CVT-E002 is known to act through toll-like receptors to stimulate innate and Th1-type immune responses. it is therefore possible that by enhancing inflammatory responses of innate and T cells to the respiratory viruses, CVT-E002 may have reduced the viral load. the observed reduction in cardiovascular adverse events in participants taking CVT-E002 was unexpected. t-E002 is a T-E002."}
