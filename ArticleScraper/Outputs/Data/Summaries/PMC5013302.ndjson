spotted triplicate in each block using a smartArrayer 48 microarrayer (CapitalBio, Beijing, China) after immobilization overnight at 4 \u00b0C, the microarrays were then stored at 80 \u00b0C prior to use. two aliquots of the lysate were prepared. human semen samples were collected from Shanghai Jiai Genetics & IVF Institute. the semen samples were evaluated for volume, sperm density, percentage of motile sperm after liquefying for 30 min. sperm cells were collected by centrifugation (500 g, 10 min) from the semen. sperm samples were washed 3 times with PBS and resuspended in 100 l. ddH2O was added to the supernatant at a ratio of 1:100 (v/v) for 1 h. the sperm samples were also analyzed with a Flow cytometer. glutathione agarose beads were coated with GST only as control. the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. the samples were then subjected to silver staining. each peptide sample was redissolved in 2% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. trapped peptides were released and separated on a C18 capillary column. peptides were eluted with gradient 2\u201310%B in 6 min, 10\u201335%B in 34 min. oxidation of methionine and N-terminal acetylation were specified as variable modifications. trypsin specificity was used, allowing for two missed cleavages. mass tolerance of 20 ppm was used for MS precursors and 0.05 Da for fragment ions. 93 clones of human lectin or lectin-like proteins were obtained from several sources. pEGH-A (23) with a N-terminal GST fusion was chosen as the destination vector for constructing the expression clones by the Gateway LR reaction. inant human lectin or lectin-like proteins were affinity purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae through the N-terminal GST tag. the quality of these proteins was then determined by silver staining using an anti-GST antibody. the majority of lectins on the microarray are Active It is a general practice to confirm the activities of proteins on the protein microarray once a new type of microarray is constructed. among the final set of 60 successfully purified human lectins and lectin-like proteins, 36 of them localize to the membrane. it is well recognized that membrane proteins are not stable, especially after purification. the most significant signal reductions were from COLEC11v1, LGALS13, and MASP1v3. most of the human lectins on the microarray are active. sperm samples from healthy male were chosen for this study. positive bindings were observed for 5 of the proteins. galectins are specific for galactoside and sialic acid. a lectin didn't show positive binding with sperm on the microarray, i.e. CLEC-2, was included as a negative control. the sperm glycans or glycoproteins that galectin-8 and ERGIC 53 bound to showed different distribution on the sperm surface. galectin-1 was incubated with sperm lysate and galectin-1 bound proteins were pulled down through affinity binding between GST tag at the N-terminal of galectin-1 and glutathione beads. eight membrane-associated and secreted proteins were successfully identified with high stringency. a highly specific anti-HSP90 antibody was applied. sperms were stained with biotinylated galectin-1 and anti-HSP90 simultaneously. lectin microarray and validation indicate the presence of human lectin specific glycans/glycoproteins on the sperm surface. two aliquots of equal amounts of sperms were prepared. one aliquot was set for capacitation in the presence of galectin-8. another was set for capacitation with the addition of GST as a control. galectin-8 promotes acrosomal reaction through enhancing of sperm capacitation. sperms were treated with GST only as control. sperms were stained with FITC conjugated PNA. we successfully purified 60 human lectins and lectin-like proteins in a soluble form by GST affinity purification. silver staining showed that most of the proteins are of the expected size. the quality of these proteins was then determined by silver staining using an anti-GST antibody. 12 identical blocks were printed on a single microarray. each protein was printed in triplicate. the printing and immobilization were reproducible among the 12 blocks. a mixture of complex glycans was tested on the microarray. one aliquot of the lysate was probed on the microarray. another aliquot that was treated with PNGase F was included as control. the plant lectin microarray (13, 14), two cell lines, 293T and MDA-MB-231, were fluorescently labeled and probed on the microarray as previously described (16). the binding patterns are more similar between 293T and MDA-MB-231 than that of yeast (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1). lectin and lectin-like proteins on the microarray bound the human sperms. sperms were fluorescent labeled and incubated on the microarray. results were recorded with a microarray scanner. sperms were directly visualized by fluorescent microscopy after incubation with biotinylated lectins followed by Cy3-streptavidin. different lectins exhibited different binding distributions on the sperm surface. for example, galectin-8 showed strong binding across the whole sperm. corresponding proteins were identified as HSP90A and HSP90B. C, Anti-HSP90 antibody specific recognized HSP90 from sperm cell lysate. sperms were stained with biotinylated galectin-1 and anti-HSP90 simultaneously. the presence of galcetin-1 and HSP90 was then identified by Cy3-streptavidin and a Cy5 conjugated second antibody that was specific for the anti-HSP90. two hundred sperms were counted for the sperms incubated with galectin-8. the sperms of both acrosomal intactness (AI) and AR were counted. the results showed that the addition of galectin-8 during capacitation could significantly promote acrosome reaction. 93 clones of human lectin or lectin-like protein were obtained from several sources. pEGH-A (23) with a N-terminal GST fusion was chosen as the destination vector for constructing the expression clones. a substrate slide coated with the polymer, polymer-Slide H from Capitalbio, was chosen for this study. all the 60 purified proteins were printed on the microarray along with controls. to ensure the reproducibility and to reduce the cost, 12 identical blocks were printed on the microarray along with controls. most of the human lectins on the microarray are active and could specifically bind glycans because PNGase F treatment specifically removes N-glycans from glycosylated proteins. most of the human lectins on the microarray are active. the total proteins in the cell lysate were biotinylated prior to microarray incubation. the microarray results were visualized by incubation with a Cy3 conjugated streptavidin. galectins are specific for galactoside and galectin-8 is specific for sialic acid. sperms were fluorescent labeled and incubated on the microarray. all five positive bindings on the microarray were evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM) using biotinylated lectins, followed by Cy3-streptavidin. the results are consistent with those of the lectin microarray, with the highest binding observed for galectin-8. the identification of galectin-1 recognized membrane-associated proteins by LC-MS/MS analysis. a, LC-MS/MS was used to identify the galactosylations of the membrane-associated proteins. 4 HSPA1A/1B Heat shock-related 70 kDa protein 2 70.0 530.9 15 Membrane (52) Glycosylation (56) 4 HSPA1L Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1-like 70.3 178.5 9 Membrane (52) Unknown 4 HSPA1A/1B Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A/1B 70.0 120.9 6 Secreted (57) Glycosylation (56) 5 TUBB4B Tubulin beta-4B chain 49.8 galectin-8 showed high binding to sperms both on the microarray and in other validations. two aliquots of equal amounts of sperms were prepared. one aliquot was set for capacitation in the presence of galectin-8. the other was set for capacitation with the addition of GST as a control. 93 clones of human lectin or lectin-like proteins were obtained from several sources. pEGH-A (23) with a N-terminal GST fusion was chosen as the destination vector for constructing the expression clones. all the proteins were spotted in triplicate on polymer slides. the slides were probed with an anti-GST antibody after immobilization. the results showed that the printing and immobilization were reproducible among all of the 12 blocks on a single microarray. the majority of lectins on the microarray are Active It is a general practice to confirm the activities of proteins on the protein microarray once a new type of microarray is constructed. among the final set of 60 successfully purified human lectins and lectin-like proteins, 36 localize to the membrane. the most significant signal reductions were from COLEC11v1, LGALS13, and MASP1v3. most of the human lectins on the microarray are active. the total proteins in the cell lysate were biotinylated. sperm samples from healthy male were chosen for this study. positive bindings were observed for 5 of the proteins: galactoside and sialic acid on sperm surface. biotinylated galectin-1, galectin-7, galectin-8, GalNAc-T6 and ERGIC 53 were included as a negative control. sperm glycans or glycoproteins that galectin-8 and ERGIC 53 bound to showed different distribution on the sperm surface. galectin-1 was incubated with sperm lysate and galectin-1 bound proteins were pulled down through affinity binding between GST tag at the N-terminal of galectin-1 and glutathione beads. the enriched specific bands were cut from the gel, digested and subjected for LC-MS/MS analysis. sperms were stained with biotinylated galectin-1 and anti-HSP90 simultaneously. the presence of galcetin-1 and HSP90 was then identified. a highly specific anti-HSP90 antibody was applied. lectin microarray and validation indicate the presence of human lectin specific glycans/glycoproteins on the sperm surface. the results indicate that specific human lectin binding on the sperm surface could have significant functional effects on key biological processes of sperm maturation. sperms were exposed to galectin-8 during capacitation. sperms were treated with GST only as control. FITC conjugated PNA stained acrosomes from galectin-8 treated sperms. galectin-1 primarily binds to heat shock proteins in the sperm neck and other glycoproteins of sperm head. this indicates that HSP90 is glycosylated in sperm and may play critical roles in maintain sperm activity. previous studies found that the protein level is positively correlated with sperm quality. galectin-8 expressed on the inner surface of genital tract may interact with the glycans on the sperms, promote sperm capacitation and then the acrosome reaction directly. it can be found in female reproductive system (35) and its expression changes in some cancers of the reproductive tract. lectins and lectin-like proteins all naturally exist in the human body. they exhibit a greater selectivity and specificity in recognizing complex glycan structures in our body than the plant lectins. the current version of this human lectin microarray also possesses several disadvantages. first, there are less than 50% of the known human lectins and lectin-like proteins on the microarray. we have successfully applied the microarray in the analysis of human sperms. we identified five proteins that could specifically bind sperms. our microarray is easily expanded with either more human lectins or with plant lectins."}
