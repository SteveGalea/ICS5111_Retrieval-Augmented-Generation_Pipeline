{"summary": "small RNA sequencing (small RNA-seq or sRNA-seq) is used to obtain thousands of short RNA sequences with lengths that are usually less than 50 bp. with sRNA-seq, many novel non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been discovered. ARS-CoV-cpsR-19 was detected from a DNA complemented palindrome TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA in the SARS-CoV genome. both psRNAs and cpsRNAs could comprise a novel class of small RNAs due to their special sequence structures. a large proportion of the sRNA-seq data is from other small RNA fragments. phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus genome sequences was performed. the results of the RNAi experiments showed that one 19-nt segment corresponding to SARS-CoV-cpsR-19 significantly induced cell apoptosis. the cleaning and quality control of the sRNA-seq data were performed using pipeline Fastq_clean [12], which was optimized to clean the raw reads from the Illumina platforms. the software R v2.15.3 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) with the Bioconductor packages [14] obtained alignment results in sequence alignment map (SAM) format. the 16-nt, 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt, and 22-nt segments from the DNA were selected as the target sequences for pSIREN-RetroQ vector construction. each group had three replicate samples for plasmid transfection and cell apoptosis measurement. the cells were washed with PBS, were triedpsinized, and were collected using a 5-mL culture tube 48 or 72 h after transfection. the culture tube was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove the supernatant. the cells were gently vortexed and were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. total RNA was isolated using RNAiso Plus Reagent (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) and the cDNA was synthesized by M-MuLV (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) the cDNA product was amplified by qPCR using GAPDH as internal control and the qPCR reaction mixture was incubated at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. 6 mammalian viruses (HPV-18, HBV, HCV, HIV-1, SMRV, and EBV) were detected from 36 runs of sRNA-seq data. in total, 11 invertebrate viruses and 8 mammalian viruses were detected from 107 runs of sRNA-seq data using VirusDetect. the ORF3b gene from human betacoronavirus, eight homologous sequences from bat betacoronaviruses, and two homologous sequences from civet betacoronaviruses were aligned using ClustalW2 [15] with curation. each group had three replicate samples for plasmid transfection and cell apoptosis measurement. Gbico RPMI-1640 medium was added to the cells, which were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove the supernatant. cells were seeded into one well of a 6-well plate for plasmid transfection. cell apoptosis was measured with the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I. appoptotic cells were quantified by summing the count of the early apoptotic cells (FITC-Annexin V+/PI) and the late apoptotic cells (FITC-Annexin V+/PI+) the expression levels of three cell-apoptosis marker genes were also measured by quantitatice PCR (qPCR) assays. for each gene, three RNAi samples and three control samples were tested for relative quantification.

DNA palindromes with sizes ranging from 14 to 31 nt and DNA complemented palindromes with sizes ranging from 14 to 53 nt existed ubiquitously in the animal virus genomes. only a few of them were detected as transcribed or processed into psRNAs or cpsRNAs.

RNAi using 16-nt, 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt, and 22-nt segments also caused increased relative expression levels of MDL1 by 1.28, 5.43, 1.58, 9.25, and 1.41 fold changes in Hela cells. qPCR of MDL1 produce higher sensitivities than that of BAX/BCL2 and CASP3 in the detection of cell apoptosis. the 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt, and 22-nt siRNA duplexes in invertebrates had much higher percentages of total sequenced reads than those in plants. comparison of small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes that were induced by plant and invertebrate viruses could not provide meaningful results using our data. complemented palindrome TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA was detected in four runs of sRNA-seq data. this 19-nt cpsRNA was named SARS-CoV-cpsR-19 and the DNA complemented palindrome contained 22 nucleotides. however, we did not have any evidence to prove the existence of siRNA duplexes. 16-nt, 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt, and 22-nt palindromic small RNAs (cpsRNAs) were not detected in this study. all of the 22-nt homologous sequences in the civet betacoronavirus genomes were identical to the DNA complemented palindrome TCTTTAACAAGCTTTAAAGA. classically defined as a nucleic acid sequence that is reverse complementary to itself. small psRNAs that are reverse complementary to themselves are defined as cpsRNAs in this study. a typical psRNA should have a sequence that is 100% identical to its reverse sequence. however most psRNAs are semipalindromic or heteropalindromic. psRNAs from two (CTACTGACCAGTCATC and AAGGTCTCTCTCTGGAA) of 14 DNA palindromes and cpsRNA from two (CTACTGACCAGTCATC and TCTTTAACAAGCTCTCTCTGGAA) of 29 DNA complemented palindromes in the SARS-CoV genome. one possible reason could be that only a few of cpsRNAs had been ligated to adapters during the s 35 18 4.5 AAATGCAAATCTGCATTT 4234 4251 18 28 18 4.9 ATATGTCTATGACATAT 4949 4965 17 24 18 4.3 CCTCATGTAAATCATGAGG 5020 5038 19 42 22 9.0 ATAACAATTGTTAT 5207 5220 14 14 12 0.9 ACTTCAACAGCTTGAAGT 5241 5258 18 39 18 4.7 ACTTCAAATTCATTTGAAGT 6256 6275 20 25 20 5.5 GTACT psRNAs from two of 29 DNA complemented palindromes were identified in the SARS-CoV genome. civet cats, which are distant relatives of house cats, may have been the springboard for the transmission of SARS-CoV to humans. the results of the sequence analysis showed that the ORF3b gene from human betacoronavirus was only located in the ORF3b genes of betacoronaviruses. the results showed that the ORF3b gene from human betacoronavirus had homologous genes from the betacoronaviruses of bats and palm civets. all of the human and civet betacoronaviruses containing the DNA complemented palindrome were grouped into one clade. the nearest relative of the human and civet clade was the bat betacoronavirus (GenBank: JX993988.1) containing the DNA complemented palindrome. the next nearest relative was the bat betacoronavirus (GenBank: DQ412042.1) containing a homologous 22-nt sequence the 19-nt segment significantly induced cell apoptosis in five other human cell lines and one mouse cell line. the siRNA duplexes that were induced by the 19-nt segment could silence cell-specific transcripts to induce cell apoptosis through RNAi. these results suggested that SARS-CoV-cpsR-19 had significant biological functions and could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or pathogenesis. tosis marker genes (BAX, BCL2, and CASP3) were measured by qPCR assays using the same RNAi protocol in the Hela cell line. results showed 1.08-, 1.65-, 1.60-, 1.24-, and 1.30-fold increases in BAX/BCL2 ratios which were caused by 16-nt, 18-nt, 19-nt, 20-nt, and 22-nt segments. the RNAi using 16-n cpsRNAs from the DNA palindrome TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or pathogenesis. cpsRNAs from the DNA palindrome TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA could play a role in SARS-CoV infection or pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-cpsR-19 was detected in very low abundance using four runs of sRNA-seq data. one possible reason could be that SARS-CoV-cpsR-19 can form one hairpin and the Tm (melting temperature) of this hairpin is about 20 \u00b0C. svRNA-N is more easily captured during the sRNA-seq library preparation process."}
