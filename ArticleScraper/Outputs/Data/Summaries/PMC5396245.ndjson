{"summary": "the first of two pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies with its dengue vaccine candidate has achieved its primary clinical endpoint. the efficacy study showed a significant reduction of 56% of dengue disease cases and a good safety profile for the vaccine. the first of two pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies with its dengue vaccine candidate has achieved its primary clinical endpoint. immatics biotechnologies has successfully completed a Phase 1 trial of its brain cancer vaccine IMA950 for glioblastoma, the most common and lethal adult brain tumor. the vaccine consists of 11 HLA-restricted tumor-associated peptides (TUMAPs), known to be overexpressed on the surface of glioblastoma tumors. 90% of patients responded to the vaccine, in comparison to 90% of patients who responded to it. IMA950 is the first of nine products developed under the CDP initiative. it is the first of nine products developed under the CDP initiative to complete a clinical trial and be taken forward. people with ragweed allergy suffer from stuffy noses with sneezing, itching and congestion. these symptoms often affect the quality of sleep and impair daily activities. current treatments include various nasal sprays as well as injectable immunotherapeutic products. depoVax is a patented formulation that provides controlled and prolonged exposure of antigens plus adjuvant to the immune system. the depoVax platform is highly flexible, allowing it to work with a broad range of target antigens in various therapeutic applications. a second study detailed immune responses from Immunovaccine's Phase 1 study of DPX-Survivac in ovarian cancer patients. the vaccine induced durable target T-cell responses, which were more robust when DPX-Survivac was combined with cyclophosphamide as an immune modulator. the results provide strong support for the potential of combining DPX-Survivac with complementary immune modulators. meningitis B is unpredictable and can strike at any time with devastating consequences. a US license for bexsero is the only sustainable solution to ensure timely responses to future outbreaks. the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine targets the LP2086 bacterial surface protein. meningococcal serogroups (A, B, C, W-135 and Y) have been responsible for the majority of meningococcal disease. serogroup B is the only one for which no broadly-protective vaccine is currently approved in the u.s. despite efforts to create a vaccine against SARS-CoV, no vaccine candidate has been successfully licensed for use. the protein nanoparticle vaccine technology is proving to have the potential to respond rapidly to emerging viruses such as MERS-CoV and certain potential pandemic influenza strains. infected 350 people across the Middle East, Europe, Asia and North Africa. of 91 cases reported in Saudi Arabia in April this year, 73 cases occurred in jeddah. the upcoming phase 2 trial, sponsored by Stemline Therapeutics, will include 80\u2013100 patients. a new study found the Bordetella pertussis bacterium that causes whooping cough has changed \u2013 most likely in response to the vaccine used to prevent the disease. the bacterium no longer produces a key surface antigen called pertactin, which is a component of some current pertussis vaccines. the proportion of pertactin-free bacteria rose from 5% of cases tested in 2008 to 78% in 2012. pertactin-free strains have been detected in countries such as france and the us."}
