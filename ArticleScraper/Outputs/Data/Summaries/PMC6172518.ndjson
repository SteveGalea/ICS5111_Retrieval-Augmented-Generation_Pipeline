{"summary": "the most frequent age group was 1\u20133 years old (48.6%) and the next was less than 12 months of age (17.4%). the prevalence of confirmed bacterial pneumonia decreased from 3.07% in 2007 to 0.08% in 2014. the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria strain was identified in 73% of bacterial pathogen. a viral or bacterial cause was identified in 81% of cases, with more than one kind of virus detected in 66% of cases. by 2012, viruses had emerged as more significant pathogens of pneumonia than bacteria. the aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology of CAP in Korea, including trends in incidence, frequency of viral and bacterial pathogens and the impact of PCV. the data were obtained from the national emergency department information system (NEDIS) for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. virus pneumonia J16.0 Chlamydial pneumonia J12.8 Other viral pneumonia J16.8 Pneumonia due to other specified infectious organisms J12.9 Viral pneumonia, unspecified J17 Pneumonia in diseases classified elsewhere J15 Bacterial pneumonia, not elsewhere classified J18 (including J18.0, 18.1, J18.2, J18.8, J18.9) Pneumonia, organism unspecified J15.0 Pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae J86.0 Py yearly prevalence of pediatric pneumonia increased from 30,521 cases in 2007 to 68,451 cases in 2014. yearly prevalence of pediatric pneumonia increased from 30,521 cases in 2007 to 68,451 cases in 2014. the rate of hospitalization was highest among patients under the age of 1 year (63.7%), followed by 13 to 18 years old group (2.56%; Table 2). 437 (1.19) 45 (0.12) 325 (0.89) 10 (0.03) 13\u201318 21,012 (6.4) 6,203 (29.5) 540 (2.56) 6 (0.03) 438 (2.08) 20 (0.09) 331 (1.58) 13 (0.06) Year 2007 30,521 1,9339 (63.4) 578 (1.89) 5 (0.02) 936 (3.07) 142 (0.47) 214 (0.70) 22 (0.07) 2008 30,180 19,136 (63.4) 487 (1.61) the rate of hospitalization declined from 63.4% in 2007 to 38.2% in 2014. overall, 66 deaths were reported, with a comparable rate of mortality of 0.1% to 0.03% for children under the age of 18 years. influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were the most prevalent (11,553 patients, 41.8% of viral pneumonia), followed by the respiratory syncytial virus (4,771 patients, 17.3% of viral pneumonia). adenovirus and human metapneumovirus were the most prevalent (11,553 patients, 41.8% of viral pneumonia), followed by the respiratory syncytial virus (4,771 patients, 17.3% of viral pneumonia). mycoplasma pneumoniae 12,635 (3.8) 1,935 (15.7) 951 (7.5) 621 (4.9) 1,066 (8.4) 3,638 (28.8) 1,569 (12.4) 974 (7.7) 1,881 (14.9) Unspecified pneumonia was identified in 1.3% cases (4,316 patients, diagnosis codes J13, J14, J15\u2013J15.9. the yearly incidence of bacterial pneumonia decreased from 3.07% in 2007 and 0.65% in 2014 (Table 2). bacterial pneumoniae pneumonia was diagnosed in 3.8% of cases (12,635 patients; Table 3) the 8-year monthly prevalence of MP was shown in Fig. 2. the monthly incidence of bacterial pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia, pleural effusion, and empyema in children and adolescents younger than 18 years per 100,000 population in 2008\u20132014. there was no decreasing or increasing trend in the number of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, pleural effusion, and empyema per 100,000 population per year during the period from 2007\u20132014. 1.23 1.01 0.33 1.10 0.79 0.23 0.45 0.52 -0.429 0.1736 Pleural effusion 1.86 1.27 1.02 1.90 2.25 0.88 0.97 1.65 -0.0714 0.9015 Empyema 0.19 0.15 0.05 0.12 0.19 0.09 0.17 0.21 -0.0364 1.0000 Annual death per 10,000,000 population stratified by age 1 yr 44.7 131.2 46.0 68.7 66.7 0 22.6 71.3 - seasonal trend decomposition plot of monthly incidence for bacterial pneumonia and empyema in 2008\u20132014. seasonal pattern for 12 months based on seasonal pattern for 2008\u20132014. 0.2143 0.5362 7\u201312 yr 10.06 6.29 4.59 12.13 29.92 7.56 6.53 15.56 0.2143 0.5362 13\u201318 yr 3.53 2.55 1.87 2.96 5.78 2.28 1.83 3.81 -0.0714 0.9015 Annual incidence of empyema per 100,000 population by age group 1 yr 2.23 0.66 0.23 0 1.56 0.81 0.71 0 1 1\u20133 yr 5.24 4.55 1.44 5. the yearly prevalence of pediatric pneumonia increased from 30,521 cases in 2007 to 68,451 cases in 2014. the rate of hospitalization was highest among patients under the age of 1 year (63.7%), with the rate decreasing with age to a rate of 30.0% among patients 13 to 18 years old.
