{"summary": "ARIs are responsible for at least six percent of the world's disability and death. few studies on the viral etiology and clinical characteristics of ARIs have been performed in the northwest region of china. ARIs are a group of diseases that include pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) ARIs are responsible for at least six percent of the world's disability and death and cause a world disease burden of 94,037,000. the distribution of respiratory viruses in males and females had no difference. 94.6% (264/279) suffered from fever, which was the most common clinical symptom, followed by cough (89.3%, 249/279) and expectoration (49.8%, 139/279). 39.4% (110/279) of patients showed abnormal chest radiography. average hospital stay duration was 6 days. 136 respiratory viral pathogens were identified from 105 patients. RSV was the most frequently detected (26.5%, 36/136), followed by PIV 22.1% (30/136), HRV 21.3 (29/136), CoV10.3% (14/136) and HAdV 9.6% (13/136). FluA, hMPV and BoCA were identified only 4.4%, 3.7%, and 2.2%, respectively. flu 3(1.1) 1(0.4) 2(0.7) 6(2.2) B 0(0) 0(0) 0(0) sH1N1 0(0) 0(0) sH1N1 0(0) 0(0) sH1N1 0(0) 0(0) sH1N1 0(0) 0(0) sH1N1 0(0) 0(0) sH1N1 0(0) 0(0) sH1N1 0(0) 0(0) s 0 0 BoCA 1 1.1 2 1.3 0 0 Single infection 21 23.9 57 37.3 7 18.4 Co- infection 5 5.7 6 3.9 1 2.6 Multiple-infection 3 3.4 2 1.3 3 7.9 Positive cases 29 33 65 42.5 11 28.9 Viral pathogens distribution in different season. single-infections accounted for 30.5% (85/279) of cases, co-infections were found in 4.3% (12/279) and multiple infections were 2.9% (8/279). 136 respiratory viral pathogens were identified from 105 patients. in the co-infections, PIV accounted for 41.7% (10/24) of the multiple-infections. PIV3 and CoV NL63 were the most frequently detected. the majority (12/13) of HAdV was detected as single infection. RSV, HRV, PIV and CoV were detected in all groups. 11 of the 13 HAdV cases and all of the patients with hMPV infected also belonged to this group. study was the first to detect multiple respiratory viruses in hospitalized children with ARIs in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, china. a total of 279 patients were enrolled from January to December 2011. HAdV was reported to be responsible for 5\u201310% of ARI in children. the high detection rate of PIV and CoV in co-infections and multiple infections was an interesting finding. hMPV had low prevalence in this study, but only five hMPV infection cases were detected and were aged between 1 to 6 years. the use of multiple RT-PCR makes rapid, effective, and affordable detection for virus a reality in resource limited areas. RT-PCR was performed using a QIAamp mini viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) 25-L reaction mixture contained 5 L 5 PCR Mix, 1 L of dNTP Mix, 1 L of Enzyme Mix,1.25 L of each primer mix. first 10 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. uM 144 FLuB M gene 1 uM 166 CoV 229E N gene 1 uM 182 CoV OC43 N gene 1 uM 200 CoV HKU1 N gene 1 uM 219 sH1N1 HA gene 1 uM 283 ADV Hexon gene 1.75 uM 338 RSVA F gene 1 uM 158 CoV NL63 Polymerase 1 uM 174 PIV2 HA gene 279 throat swab specimens were taken from 279 inpatients. they were transported at 2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C and preserved at 80\u00b0C. clinical information including demographic characteristics, symptoms, signs treatments, duration of hospitalization, clinical diagnosis were documented in case report forms. the PCR products were analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis. group A was tested for the presence of fluA, fluB, sH1N1, HRV, CoV 229E/CoV OC43/CoV HKU1, PIV1, and HAdV. group B was tested for the presence of RSVA/B, CoV NL63, PIV2/PIV3, HMPV and BoCA. the group ratios were compared using Pearson's test. the group ratios were compared using an inspection level of 0.05."}
