{"summary": "autophagosomes fuse with lysosome (vacuole in yeast), in which hydrolases degrade the cargo for reuse by the cell. formation of autophagosomes involves five steps [1]: initiation, nucleation, elongation and closure, recycling, and autophagosome fusion. isolation membrane expands from the PAS, either by direct flow of membranes from a source such as the endoplasmic reticulum. fusion of the growing edge of the isolation membrane completes autophagosome formation. several Atg proteins are recycled in a process involving Atg9. this review focuses on the ever-expanding array of non-autophagic biological functions for Atg proteins. we define these processes as those generally distinct from, or occasionally in addition to, an involvement in autophagosome formation or lysosomal cargo degradation. ubiquitin-like Atg proteins and their conjugates have a broader role that goes beyond autophagy. this has raised the question of whether the ubiquitin-like Atg proteins and their conjugates have a broader role that goes beyond autophagy. the six ATG8 orthologues in humans interact with at least 67 other proteins. Atg5 or Atg12\u2013Atg5 Regulation of isRNA-generated type I IFN production through Atg12\u2013Atg5 interactions with CARDs of helicases RIG1, MDA5Unknown functions\u2014Atg5 interactions with other CARD proteins [26,27][26,27] Calpain-cleaved Atg5 Apoptosis\u2014mitochondrial insertion, Bcl-xL activation, cytochrome c release beclin 1 Cleavage by caspases suppresses autophagy and induces apoptosis [55,57,58] Atg5, Atg7 Needed for adipogenesis in mice [59,60] LC3, Atg2 Lipid droplet formation in mice [62,63] Atg12\u2013Atg5, Atg7 and Atg16L1 Required for IFN-mediated host defence against murine norovirus replication. the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway regulates several Rho GTPases. the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway regulates several Rho GTPases. the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway regulates several Rho GTPases. LC3 interacts with a GEF called AKAP-Lbc. this interaction inhibits the Rho\u2013GEF activity of AKAP-Lbc in HEK293 cells. LC3 binding maintains AKAP-Lbc in an inactive state, thereby impairing its ability to promote downstream signalling. plasmic reticulum, of a protein called EDEM1, produces cellular membranes for its replication. MHV infection results in the accumulation of EDEM1 and OS9 in the DMVs coated with the non-lipidated LC3-I and Atg8 autophagy marker. the downregulation of LC3 but not the inactivation of host cell autophagy, inhibits CoV infection. atg12\u2013Atg5 conjugates Atg12\u2013Atg5 as suppressor of antiviral immune signalling. atg12 and its conjugation partner, Atg5, are also involved in non-autophagic signalling processes. infection of mammalian cells produces virus-derived immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA) structures. the conjugate interacts with the RNA helicases RIG1 and MDA5. this interferes with the ability of the helicases to engage in their normal CARD interactions with IPS1. this is reflected by the increase in type I IFN production in VSV-infected Atg5-knockout fibroblasts and a reduction in viral replication. worms with mutated UNC-51 regulate axon guidance in many neurons. serine/threonine kinase modulates subcellular transportation of UNC-5. PP2A\u2013UNC-51 complex regulates axon guidance. osteoclasts secrete lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin K (CatK) and hydrochloric acid into an extracellular resorptive space (resorptive lacuna) osteoclasts become polarized, the ruffled border is formed and an actin ring confines and seals the contact site between the osteoclasts and the bone. the secretion of demineralizing and degradative enzymes is confined lysosomal exocytosis events involved a subset of vesicles containing VAMP7 and synaptotagmin VII were implicated in plasma membrane wound healing and neurite outgrowth. LC3 isoforms and other Atg proteins [33] might be involved more broadly in processes such as neurite outgrowth and plasma membrane wound healing. atg protein defects impair the mRNA and protein levels of BLOC1 and AP3. a block in autophagy causes levels of p62 to increase. p62 sequesters keap1, an E3 ligase for Nrf2. the mechanism of unconventional protein secretion remains poorly understood. there is good evidence that Acb1 and probably IL-1 are secreted by an autophagosome-like vesicular intermediate. this vesicular intermediate captures cytosolic cargo and delivers it to the exterior of the cell. caspases cleave Atg proteins and regulate autophagy. apoptosis is associated with translocation of this Atg5 fragment from the cytosol to mitochondria. apoptosis is associated with translocation of this Atg5 fragment from the cytosol to mitochondria. the formation of the apoptotic DISC depends on the presence of Atg5 and the autophagosomal membrane containing LC3 and Atg16L. in mutant animals lacking one of these proteins, adipose tissue deposits are smaller in mass than those observed in wild-type mice. a subset of the autophagic machinery is required, in a non-degradative capacity, for IFN-mediated host defence against murine norovirus (MNV) macrophages co-opt some of the cellular Atg proteins to block norovirus infection by inhibiting formation of the replication complex. the mechanism by which the autophagy proteins described above interfere with membrane alterations and membrane-associated viral replication is not known. aBCV formation and transport of Brucella to the endoplasmic reticulum is unaffected in autophagy-deficient cells obtained either by knockdown of specific autophagy components in HeLa cells or by using macrophages carrying null mutations in Atg proteins. however, BCV formation is dependent on autophagy proteins, such as ULK1, beclin 1, Atg14L and PI3K activity. atg5 and Atg6 are required for interaction with the tumour suppressor p53 and for transcriptional activation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21CDK1N1A. the new roles point to a complex interplay between autophagy, cell proliferation and cell death during neural development in mammals. the knockout of ATG genes in mice yield distinct phenotypes ranging from early embryonic to perinatal lethality. this area needs to be explored further in yeast and mammalian models. this would require studying the cellular functions of more Atg8/LC3-interacting partners, as well as Atg12-interacting partners."}
