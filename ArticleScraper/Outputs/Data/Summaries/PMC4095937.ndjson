{"summary": "disordered proteins and protein regions defy this structure\u2013function paradigm. they do not exhibit stable secondary and/or tertiary structures. they exist as dynamic ensembles of interconverting conformers with preferred, nonrandom orientations. how complex intracellular environments modulate the in vivo properties of disordered proteins. how do complex intracellular environments modulate the in vivo properties of disordered proteins. how do complex intracellular environments modulate the in vivo properties of disordered proteins. cytosolic ion and metabolite compositions and concentrations, and delineate their effects on cellular dielectric constants, pH and viscosity. the total concentration of cytoplasmic inorganic ions in E. coli is 300 mM according to the CyberCell database. concentrations of K+ were determined to be 250 (free), 180\u2013200, and 100 mM. large variations in the total concentration of Mg2+ have been reported. estimates for other common inorganic ions include Na+ at 5 mM,34 Ca2+ at 0.1 mM,35. the total iron load in red blood cells is 20 mM, while it is 1 mM in neurons. global intracellular concentrations of free metals are similar in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Zn2+ binding to proThymosin (ProT) increases transient helicity from 1% to 12%59,60. metal binding can also promote oligomerization. many amyloidogenic IDPs directly bind metals. intracellular Glu\u2013 levels change from 96 to 149 to 45 mM. intracellular glutathione concentrations change from 17 to 18 to 8 mM. ATP from 9.6 to 9.0 to 4.1 mM. frog muscle, where phosphocreatine is the most abundant metabolite (50 mM), followed by carnosine, total free amino acids, creatine and total ATP at respective concentrations of 19.5 mM, 11.7 mM, 11.0 mM, and 6.2 mM. not measured are the important polyamine metabolites putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. glycerol, trehalose and zwitterions stabilize proteins at intracellular concentrations between 100 and 300 mM. these compounds may represent a special class of metabolites, because they also function as powerful stabilizing agents in vitro. free amino acids increase dielectric constant by molar increments of 20\u201330 M\u20131. alanine is expected to increase the dielectric constant of the cytosol by a very modest 0.02 units. the dielectric properties of many cell types have been investigated. pH As a rule of thumb, the pH of the cytoplasm is 7.2,91. it is critical to maintain this value for any given organism. only histidine (pKa 6.04) and other imidazoles affect buffering near neutral pH. some IDPs adopt more ordered structures in response to \u201cdrastic\u201d pH changes. -helical content in histones at pH 10,102 increased helicity of the calpastatin domain I at pH levels below 4,103 and an increase in transient helicity of ProT at pH 2. 85% of all intracellular water displays translational (macroscopic) and rotational (microscopic) dynamics that are indistinguishable from pure water. 90% of the water molecules in the hydration layer of proteins display an average 2-fold reduction in dynamic properties compared to bulk water. macromolecular crowding is a general property of the intracellular space. in the typical E. coli cell, this corresponds to 200\u2013320 g/L of protein (4 mM), 75\u2013120 g/L of RNA, and 11\u201318 g/L of DNA. in mammalian cells, protein concentrations ranging from 50 to 250 g/L have been determined. in the first part of our discussion, we describe \u201cclassical\u201d macromolecular crowding effects that result from steric repulsion. in the second part, we outline additional attractive effects that contribute to crowding in cells. in vivo studies of protein folding reported weak modulatory effects. in mammalian cells, melting temperature of folded phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) increases by 3 K. the disordered FlgM protein displays structural alterations toward more folded conformations in intact E. coli cells and in glucose, BSA and ovalbumin-crowded solutions. higher concentrations and larger sizes of PEG molecules lead to greater intramolecular FRET efficiencies. macromolecular crowding and viscosity may indeed determine the net effects observed in intact cells. 136,147 Figure 4. Macromolecular crowding and viscosity. ies used a theoretical capture-flow model in which macromolecules exhibit size-dependent characteristics, i.e., capture capacities and weak interactions with other molecules that they drag along. neither metabolites nor macromolecules alter the viscosity of bulk intracellular water on the nm scale. in crowded environments, a transition from nano- to microviscosity is observed. above the nm scale, overall increases in apparent microviscosity are felt by solute particles. the extent to which microviscosity is experienced depends on its radius. in has a radius of 4 nm,171 whereas tau (441 residues) has a radius of 6 nm. both proteins experience an intracellular microviscosity inside E. coli and mammalian cells that is 8- and 3-times greater than in buffer. rotational diffusion in eukaryotic intracellular compartments was found to be 2\u20133 times slower than in pure water. the measured rotational correlation times in the cytoplasm are 10\u201320% larger than in dilute solution, 10\u201330% larger in mitochondria and 100% larger in the endoplasmic reticulum. in folded proteins, weak interactions target localized structural entities such as hydrophobic or charged surface patches. weak IDP interactions may result in more discontinuous viscosity effects that target individual protein segments differently. a t term is introduced to describe non-Brownian diffusion. values between zero and one denote subdiffusion. values greater than one denote superdiffusion. prokaryotes exhibit much higher intracellular concentrations of metabolites. these diffusion properties are contrasted by the 3- to 9-fold higher intracellular diffusion coefficients inside Dictyostelium discoideum (Dcyt 24 m2/s) and in mammalian NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (Dcyt = 27 m2/s), which reinforces the notion that macromolecular crowding in mammalian cells exerts weaker effects on intracellular diffusion than in bacteria. no such diffusion barriers or impairments are detected for low molecular weight compounds, such as fluorescently labeled sugars, even at 14.7 Osm (2 M NaCl) these results imply that the bacterial cytoplasm displays sieve-like properties toward larger molecules that result in strong impairments of translational diffusion and local entrapments. oligomeric IDP species may exhibit reduced intracellular diffusion. in the case of fibrillar tau, aggregates could hamper vesicle transport in neuronal cells and contribute to Parkinson\u2019s disease. even the largest macromolecular assemblies can travel back and forth multiple times during one cell division cycle. osmotic stress will increase these times and progressively affect biological reactions that rely on fast macromolecular diffusion. general intracellular- or organelle-macromolecular crowding exerts small effects on the diffusion properties of average-sized proteins at physiological concentrations. extended DNA fragments diffuse slower in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HeLa cells than dextran molecules of similar sizes. macromolecular crowding has the capacity to modulate the structures and diffusion behaviors of biological macromolecules, as well as how weak transient interactions can counteract or exacerbate these effects. we also discussed how weak transient interactions can counteract or exacerbate these effects. oxidase in PEG-, dextran-, and ficoll-containing environments. stronger stabilizing effects were detected for complexes with more than two subunits. higher viscosity decreases association rates but also decreases dissociation rates. in vitro association kinetics may differ only marginally from in vitro rates. in vivo association rates of the barnase-barstar interaction are not affected by polyvinylpyrrolidone crowding. TEM1-BLIP binding is less than 4-fold slower in PEG-, dextran-, and Ficoll-solutions, and only 2-fold slower in HeLa cells. organelles offer additional lipid-solvent interfaces at their interiors and exteriors. structural disorder is the main determinant for function. phosphorylation of conserved serines within the effector domain of MARCKS reduces its net charge. lipid rafts harbor specific sets of trans-membrane proteins and act as platforms for complex biological processes. lipid rafts exhibit distinct lipid compositions and have characteristic permeabilities, fluidities, and overall electrostatic properties. the cytoplasm harbors multiple physical barriers that spatially confine vesicles, organelles and large cellular machines such as ribosomes. the segregation of the cytoplasm into nanometer-sized compartments created defined pools of biomolecules and metabolites. cellular machines such as ribosomes reside at specific locations in these metabolic zones, where more or less defined compartments insulate concurrent biological processes. the model by Spitzer and Poolman is a good description of the heterogeneous cytoplasm. concentrations of K+ were determined to be 250 (free), 180\u2013200, and 100 mM. large variations in the total concentration of Mg2+ have been reported. estimates range from 2035 to 100 mM,36. concentration of free Zn2+ in mitochondria is in the pM range but nM in the cytoplasm. despite these differences, global intracellular concentrations of free metals are similar in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Zn2+ binding to ProThymosin (ProT) increases transient helicity from 1% to 12%59,60. metal binding can also promote oligomerization. many amyloidogenic IDPs directly bind metals. intracellular Glu\u2013 levels change from 96 to 149 to 45 mM. intracellular glutathione concentrations change from 17 to 18 to 8 mM. ATP from 9.6 to 9.0 to 4.1 mM. frog muscle, where phosphocreatine is the most abundant metabolite (50 mM), followed by carnosine, total free amino acids, creatine and total ATP at respective concentrations of 19.5 mM, 11.7 mM, 11.0 mM, and 6.2 mM. not measured are the important polyamine metabolites putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. the extent of these effects increases with polyamine charge, length and concentration, suggesting that they can also occur in vivo. other metabolites such as trimethylamine-N-oxide, proline, betaine, and ectoine, stabilize proteins at intracellular concentrations between 100 and 300 mM. free amino acids increase the dielectric constant by molar increments of 20\u201330 M\u20131. alanine is expected to increase the dielectric constant of the cytosol by a very modest 0.02 units. pH As a rule of thumb, the pH of the cytoplasm is 7.2,91. it is critical to maintain this value for any given organism. only histidine (pKa 6.04) and other imidazoles affect buffering near neutral pH. es 6.3 in early endosomes, 6.5 in recycling endosomes, 5.5 in late endosomes. resistance to pH changes serves as a common indicator for native \u201cunfoldedness\u201d some IDPs adopt more ordered structures in response to \u201cdrastic\u201d pH changes. concentrations of K+ were determined to be 250 (free), 180\u2013200, and 100 mM. large variations in the total concentration of Mg2+ have been reported. differences have been reported for some specialized tissues/organs. in eukaryotic cells, intracellular concentrations of metal ions are more difficult to determine accurately. many proteins bind metals, and their abundance and localization leads to dynamic changes in metal content. the total iron load in red blood cells is 20 mM for example, while it is 1 mM in neurons. Zn2+ coordination by the disordered N-terminal domain of HIV-1 integrase, for example, results in -helix formation. deletion of the disordered C-terminal 27 residues of the scavenger protein cardiac calsequestrin results in the loss of tetramerization. intracellular Glu\u2013 levels change from 96 to 149 to 45 mM. intracellular glutathione concentrations change from 17 to 18 to 8 mM. ATP from 9.6 to 9.0 to 4.1 mM. frog muscle, where phosphocreatine is the most abundant metabolite (50 mM), followed by carnosine, total free amino acids, creatine and total ATP at respective concentrations of 19.5 mM, 11.7 mM, 11.0 mM, and 6.2 mM. not measured in these studies are the important polyamine metabolites putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. polyamines have been found to accelerate the in vitro aggregation and fibrillation of -synuclein, an IDP implicated in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), in vitro. the extent of these effects increases with polyamine charge, length and concentration, suggesting that they can also occur in vivo. free amino acids increase the dielectric constant by molar increments of 20\u201330 M\u20131. alanine is expected to increase the dielectric constant of the cytosol by 0.02 units. the dielectric properties of many cell types have been investigated. intracellular electric susceptibility depends on ion and metabolite concentrations. it is moreover possible that ion and metabolite effects scale differently in different intracellular microenvironments. this complexity may lead to spatially modulated effects on IDP structure and function. cisterns and 6.0 at trans-Golgi networks, 8.0 in mitochondria, 7.0 in peroxisomes, 6.3 in early endosomes, 6.5 in recycling endosomes, 4.7 in lysosomes. disordered proteins are sensitive to pH, and unfolding is common at pH values 3.100. some IDPs adopt more ordered structures in response to \u201cdrastic\u201d pH changes. 85% of all intracellular water displays translational (macroscopic) and rotational (microscopic) dynamics that are indistinguishable from pure water. 90% of the water molecules in the hydration layer of proteins display an average 2-fold reduction in dynamic properties compared to bulk water. macromolecular crowding a general property of the intracellular space. the typical E. coli cell contains 25% protein by volume, of which 10% are cytoskeletal filaments and 90% are soluble globular proteins. macromolecules occupy 10\u201340% of any cell volume and make this space unavailable to other macromolecules. clusion on the thermodynamic, kinetic and structural properties of macromolecules in crowded media. in the first part of our discussion, we describe \u201cclassical\u201d macromolecular crowding effects that result from steric repulsion and volume exclusion. s protein compaction (Figure 3B) may stabilize globular proteins (Figure 3C), or promote protein\u2013protein associations (Figure 3D), which may, in turn, lead to conformational collapse and aggregation (Figure 4). 137,138 therefore, they may experience exacerbated crowding effects. DP compaction was reported for the disordered carboxyamidated ribonuclease T1 (TCAM) in the presence of 400 g/L of dextran139. the disordered FlgM protein displays structural alterations toward more folded conformations in intact E. coli cells. higher concentrations and larger sizes of PEG molecules lead to greater intramolecular FRET efficiencies. the uniform trend predicted by \"classical\" theory may indeed determine the net effects observed in intact cells. 136,147 Figure 4. Macromolecular crowding and viscosity. macromolecules exhibit size-dependent characteristics, i.e., capture capacities and weak interactions with other molecules that they drag along. the combination of these effects determines the overall macroscopic viscosity of bulk intracellular water on the nm scale. crowding induces local nanoviscosity via hydrodynamic interactions, not hard-sphere repulsions. in crowded environments, a transition from nano- to microviscosity is observed. above the nm scale, overall increases in apparent microviscosity are felt by solute particles. intracellular crowding does not significantly change the hydrodynamic radii of these IDPs. both proteins experience an intracellular microviscosity inside E. coli and mammalian cells that is 8-fold greater than in buffer. in eukaryotic intracellular compartments, the measured rotational correlation times in the cytoplasm are 10\u201320% larger than in dilute solution, 10\u201330% larger in mitochondria and 100% larger in the endoplasmic reticulum. in the case of disordered proteins, backbone motions are difficult to dissect from rotational diffusion properties. in-cell NMR data on human tau, -synuclein and other disordered proteins support this notion. translational diffusion is defined as the mean-square displacement of a given particle with time (t) in a homogeneous solvent, translational diffusion is primarily determined by the solute\u2019s size and shape. translational diffusion can become complex and exhibit characteristics of anomalous diffusion (non Brownian diffusion) a t term is introduced to describe non-Brownian diffusion. values between zero and one denote subdiffusion. values greater than one denote superdiffusion. translational protein diffusion in E. coli and mammalian cells is 10 times slower (Dcyt = 3\u20138 m2/s) than in water (D = 87 m2/s) these diffusion properties are contrasted by the 3- to 9-fold higher intracellular diffusion coefficients inside Dictyostelium discoideum (Dcyt = 24 m2/s) in mammalian NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. intracellular GFP diffusion coincides with formation of noncontinuous pools of intracellular GFP. no such diffusion barriers or impairments are detected for low molecular weight compounds, such as fluorescently labeled sugars. oligomeric IDP species may exhibit reduced intracellular diffusion. in the case of fibrillar tau, aggregates could hamper vesicle transport in neuronal cells and contribute to Parkinson\u2019s disease. even the largest macromolecular assemblies can travel back and forth multiple times during one cell division cycle. osmotic stress will increase these times and affect biological reactions that rely on fast macromolecular diffusion. cosity felt by GFP is only 2 times higher than in water. the viscosity in the nucleus is 1.2 to 1.4 times greater than in water. the results establish that general intracellular- or organelle-macromolecular crowding exerts small effects on the diffusion properties. macromolecular crowding has the capacity to modulate the structures and diffusion behaviors of biological macromolecules, as well as how weak transient interactions can counteract or exacerbate these effects. this statement cannot be generalized, because some associations result in complexes with dimensions greater than those of the individually interacting molecules. destabilizing effects were noted for the barnase-barstar interaction in the presence of PEG and for TEM1 and -lactamase-BLIP inhibitor in PEG- and dextran-crowded solutions. a 2-fold in vivo affinity increase between the GTPase Cdc42 and its various effector-proteins was reported in HeLa cells. a view is biased toward intracellular association rates and oblivious to dissociation kinetics. in vivo association rates are not affected by polyvinylpyrrolidone crowding. TEM1-BLIP binding is less than 4-fold slower in PEG-, dextran- and Ficoll-solutions. in vivo studies of protein folding reported weak modulatory effects. in mammalian cells, melting temperature of folded phosphoglycerate kinase increases by 3 K compared to isolated in vitro conditions. c-terminal fragments of human prothymosin-, the binding domain of the activator for thyroid hormones and retinoid receptors (ACTR) and the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 integrase failed to show compaction under similarly crowded in vitro conditions. cellular and in vitro crowding contributions on protein compaction do not follow the uniform trend predicted by \u201cclassical\u201d theory. depletion layer moves according to microviscosity (gray) of its surrounding. anomalous subdiffusion occurs at transition between fast nano- (Dnano) and slow microdiffusion (Dmicro) intracellular solvent viscosity displays the same features as viscosity in aqueous protein solutions. crowding induces local nanoviscosity via hydrodynamic interactions, not hard-sphere repulsions. crowding induces local nanoviscosity via hydrodynamic interactions. the extent to which microviscosity is experienced by a particle depends on its radius and the crowding agents\u2019 dimensions and concentrations. 157,162169 Holyst et al. rationalized this effect in an advanced manner: (i) when a particle is much larger than the crowding agent, it experiences microviscosity, which corresponds to the viscosity of bulk water. microviscosity is 5-fold greater than microviscosity, on average. this model conceptualizes many of the measured intracellular viscosity effects. it also accounts for differences in diffusion behaviors in cells. 178180 These values directly reflect the local cellular viscosity on the subnano to nanometer scale, which influences the rotational correlation times of proteins. in the case of disordered proteins, backbone motions are difficult to dissect from rotational diffusion properties, because both occur on the same ns time scale. transient contacts may predominantly occur at clustered charged or hydrophobic residues or at regions of transient secondary structure functioning as promiscuous binding interfaces. a central assumption in describing normal diffusion is that the solute moves within a continuous hydrodynamic fluid. prokaryotes exhibit much higher intracellular concentrations of metabolites and biological macromolecules than eukaryotes. at physiological osmotic concentrations (0.44 Osm), bacteria contain 200 g/L of protein. when shifted to 1.02 Osm, protein levels reach 320 g/L, which correspond to a concentration typically observed in protein crystals. average hydrodynamic radii of disordered proteins (4\u20136 nm) are slightly larger than those of similarly sized, ordered proteins. translational protein diffusion in E. coli and mammalian cells is 8- and 3-times slower than in pure water in the supra-nanometer range. cytosolic diffusion coefficients (Dcyt) are generally smaller than predicted by the Stokes\u2013Einstein equation. this disparity increases with molecular weight, which indicates that larger proteins or protein complexes diffuse much slower than suggested by their size. crowded cytoplasm of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells restricts translational diffusion. most biological reactions occur faster than diffusion. even the largest macromolecular assemblies can travel back and forth multiple times. translational diffusion in the lumen of intracellular organelles contributes to many cellular processes. eukaryotic intracellular- or organelle-macromolecular crowding exerts small effects on diffusion properties of average-sized proteins at physiological concentrations. the measured rotational correlation times in the cytoplasm are 10\u201320% larger than in dilute solution, 10\u201330% larger in mitochondria and 100% larger in the endoplasmic reticulum. these values directly reflect the local cellular viscosity on the subnano to nanometer scale, which influences the rotational correlation times of proteins. in-cell NMR data on human tau, -synuclein and other disordered proteins support this notion. translational diffusion is defined as the mean-square displacement of a given particle with time (t), and according to Fick\u2019s law, the diffusion coefficient (D) denotes the velocity with which a solvent unit cross section is transversed in time (s\u20131) prokaryotes exhibit much higher intracellular concentrations of metabolites and biological macromolecules than eukaryotes. at physiological osmotic concentrations (0.44 Osm), bacteria contain 200 g/L of protein. when shifted to 1.02 Osm, protein levels reach 320 g/L. the average hydrodynamic radii of disordered proteins (4\u20136 nm) are slightly larger than those of similarly sized, ordered proteins. translational protein diffusion in E. coli and mammalian cells is 8- and 3-times slower than in pure water in the supra-nanometer range. the Stokes\u2013Einstein relationship states that diffusion of a particle scales inversely with its Stokes radius, also called hydrodynamic radius (RS or RH) this disparity increases with molecular weight, which indicates that larger proteins or protein complexes diffuse much slower than suggested by their size. -synuclein aggregates could hamper vesicle transport in neuronal cells. fibrillar tau tangles may increase diffusion-limiting effects of the microtubule network. most biological reactions occur faster than diffusion. translational diffusion in the lumen of intracellular organelles contributes to many cellular processes. in higher eukaryotes, translational diffusion in the lumen of intracellular organelles contributes to many cellular processes. metabolites channeling along spatially arranged membrane-bound enzymes was the only way to ensure efficient mitochondrial activity. macromolecular crowding has the capacity to modulate the structures and diffusion behaviors of a biomolecule. it is reasonable that size and shape alone do not determine a biomolecule\u2019s intracellular diffusion. soft interactions can either exacerbate or counteract hard-sphere effects. macromolecular crowding can either stabilize or destabilize protein\u2013protein interactions, depending on the size and shape of the reacting molecules and the resulting complexes. a 2-fold in vivo affinity increase was observed for complexes with more than two subunits. intracellular viscosity depends on different macromolecular crowding contributions. higher viscosity decreases association rates but also decreases dissociation rates. kinetic effects can have complex behaviors. macromolecular crowding can either stabilize or destabilize protein\u2013protein interactions, depending on the size and shape of reacting molecules and the resulting complexes. a 2-fold affinity increase between the GTPase Cdc42 and its various effector-proteins was reported in HeLa cells. translational diffusion in cells is much faster than on the m scale, where anomalous diffusion prevails. this behavior is exacerbated by steric repulsion, but unaffected by slower translation diffusion. this behavior is equally affected by macromolecular crowding, but largely governed by slower translational diffusion. organelles are separated by membranes that function as physical barriers in preserving environmental properties and counteracting exchange. their interiors offer different environmental conditions, which are often determined by their biomolecular composition. lipid rafts harbor specific sets of trans-membrane proteins and act as platforms for complex biological processes such as signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, membrane transport and pathogen invasion. lipid rafts harbor specific sets of trans-membrane proteins and act as platforms for complex biological processes. disordered proteins with clustered positively charged residues experience attractive forces, which can be weak, but biologically meaningful in mediating membrane interactions. protein complexes spanning membranes and connecting cellular compartments often mediate selective transport and exchange of biomolecules, especially with regard to permeability. 239 Spitzer and Poolman developed a comprehensive physicochemical model of the heterogeneous cytoplasm. the model postulates the existence of intracellular metabolic zones that comprise electrolyte pools and levels of macromolecular crowding different from other regions. proteomes of higher eukaryotes contain larger proportions of disorder than unicellular ones. Approximately 30% of all mammalian proteins are disordered. 75% of all signaling proteins contain extended disordered regions. regulation of IDP synthesis Protein synthesis is generally controlled on the transcriptional (DNA), post-transcriptional (RNA) and translational (ribosome) levels. results indicated that genes encoding disordered proteins are more intricately regulated than genes encoding folded proteins. the Babu group also investigated the synthesis and degradation rates of IDP transcripts and compared them to the rates of ordered proteins. they found that the number of transcription factors regulating IDP gene expression is roughly the same as for folded proteins. the half-lives of mRNAs encoding highly disordered proteins are shorter compared to ordered proteins. ribosomes/ORF 0.5 0.37 protein abundance (proteins/cell) 2900 1860 protein half-life (min.) 45 37 % PEST sequences 19 42 ubiquitination sitesb,c 50 70 a Data from S. cerevisae, adapted from ref (252), except, b entries obtained from human tissues and cell lines. alternative splicing occurs more frequently in mRNAs encoding disordered than ordered proteins. only 19% of all alternative splice sites occur in ordered regions. isoforms of disordered proteins can contain different sequences, different numbers of linear motifs, or novel post-translational modification sites. such changes can rewire protein interaction networks and facilitate new phenotypes in cell-, tissue-, organ- and organism-specific manners. site-specific cleavage within a disordered loop of plasma membrane-bound sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) by a subtilisin-related serine protease and a Zn(II)-metalloprotease promotes membrane dissociation. the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is another ordered, membrane-bound protein with well-defined heparin and Cu/Zn binding domains. APP is cleaved by - and -secretase releasing disordered, aggregation-prone and highly neurotoxic A peptides. eukaryotes, broadly acting proteases degrade misfolded or otherwise damaged proteins. complex proteolytic systems and processes, such as the proteasome and autophagy regulate global protein homeostasis, acting on a wide range of proteins. 20S proteasome degrades folded proteins that contain extended disordered regions at their termini. a priming disordered region of 30 amino acids is required for polyubiquitin-dependent proteolysis by the 26S proteasome. in e. coli bulky, hydrophobic amino acids are most destabilizing, followed by basic residues (Arg and Lys) in eukaryotic proteins, PEST sequences contain between 10 and 50 amino acids rich in Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr that cause rapid degradation. the Selbach group has measured absolute mRNA and protein levels in mammalian NIH3T3 cells, and their turnover rates and average stabilities. this resource has not yet been interrogated with respect to disorder. many in vivo studies suggest disordered proteins are not degraded appreciably faster than ordered ones. ar crowding are expected to increase, rather than decrease, proteolytic activity. this is caused by crowding-induced structural changes in the protease that favor an open conformation of its substrate entry site. a similar behavior was reported for the HIV-1 protease. 3,314 cytoplasmic -synuclein can potentially be proteolyzed when it is not bound to membranes. when it is treated with proteases such as thermolysin, proteinase K, or the Glu-specific V8-protease it is efficiently degraded into small peptide fragments that span its entire sequence. disordered regions are often post-translationally modified which leads to altered structures and functions. in many cases, modifications regulate protein interactions, which may either protect disordered proteins from degradation or signal their turnover. disordered proteins were considered in vitro artifacts and an indication of the absence of appropriate chaperones to help them adopt their \u201cnative\u201d, ordered conformations. a large portion of recent IDP/chaperone literature addresses the functional roles of chaperones as cellular anti-aggregation factors. the small heat shock proteins (sHsp) mediate interactions with different substrates. these regions efficiently cross-link with many cellular proteins. molecular shielding via disordered regions is another mechanism by which chaperones reduce unfavorable interactions. some partially disordered ribosomal proteins, such as L16 and L18 exhibit dual protein and RNA chaperoning activities. disordered proteins do not constitute preferred chaperone targets. a computational study by Hegyi and Tompa concluded that disordered proteins spend more time in chaperone-bound states than ordered ones. weak binding to Hsp90365 and GroEL367 was reported in the absence of ATP or ADP. it is difficult to assess whether such isolated in vitro chaperone interactions with nonaggregated IDPs are physiologically relevant in vivo. eukaryotic PTMs represent the single most important means to dynamically regulate protein function in a reversible manner. we often think of PTMs as binary \u201cswitches\u201d that toggle between \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d states. these notions assume that PTMs control all or nothing decisions, which is not always case. e proteins and their relative phosphorylation levels (occupancy), according to ref (394). e proteins and their relative phosphorylation levels (occupancy), according to ref (394). chemical structures of post-translational amino acid modifications at increasing ROS/RNS levels. the occurrence of PTMs in disordered proteins exceeds often the three to four modifications per protein mentioned above. among 50 proteins phosphorylated at 20 or more sites, most are disordered. a recent study suggested that 65% of these sites might lack unique functional roles. most modifications are present substoichiometrically (occupancy below 50%), meaning roughly equal numbers of substrate molecules lack the modification. Thr-Pro motifs represent 30% of all threonine phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic proteins. Ser-Pro constitutes 20% of all phosphorylated serine residues. dephosphorylating enzymes are ten-times less abundant than kinases. abundant proteins, prone to random encounters with kinases and phosphatases, are more frequently phosphorylated, although their individual phospho-site \u201coccupancies\u201d are low. 8% of all serines and threonines are phosphorylated in disordered proteins, whereas the number is only 2.5% in ordered ones. the 7 human phospho-serine and phospho-threonine specific 14\u20133\u20133 domain isoforms are not specific and interact with target sites within multiple kinase consensus motifs. Tudor-, PHD-, and chromo-domains bind methylated lysines irrespective of sequence context. nitrated tyrosines generally occur at low abundance and only 0.01% of all tyrosine are nitrated under inflammatory conditions,435,437 they may serve as important disease factors. nitrated tyrosines may function as immunogenic signals that activate inflammatory responses. yrosine sites in IDPs that are readily nitrated in vitro do not correspond to residues modified in vivo. studies of independent replicates of H2O2 exposed mammalian Jurkat cells show that methionine oxidation does not occur randomly. 85% of the characterized modification sites show oxidation levels of 30%. methinione oxidation occurs with rather low penetrance under physiological conditions. many other oxidative modifications, such as tyrosine halogenation, dityrosine formation, tryptophan nitration and carbonylation of various amino acids427, are mediated by reactive oxygen species that accumulate with aging. protein disorder favors cooperative mechanisms because PTM sites are exposed and easily accessible to modifying and demodifying enzymes, but also because modified residues can rapidly engage in novel protein\u2013protein or protein\u2013membrane interactions and directly alter local or global IDP conformations. sic1 is intrinsically disordered and contains seven Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. Upon Cdc4 binding, Sic1 is degraded and full Cdk1 activity required for entering S-phase is established. phosphorylation events may occur at low abundance in the absence of sustained Cdk1 activity. phosphorylation of short peptides derived from the proline-rich regions of human tau induces poly proline type II helices. phosphorylation at internal, or C-terminal helix positions destabilizes the secondary structure, whereas N-terminal phosphorylation stabilizes -helices. serine/threonine phosphorylation N-terminal to prolines does not affect cis/trans equilibria. in cells, proline cis/trans isomers may be differently sequestered by binding partners. other types of modifications may also affect structural properties of disordered proteins. action was observed for -synuclein upon methionine oxidation. ubiquitination and sumoylation introduce new interaction surfaces. cellular modifications greatly expand the chemical heterogeneity of these proteins, which in turn may increase their structural and functional diversity. in this section, we discuss how different intracellular environments may affect coupled folding and binding reactions. we outline how disorder-to-order transitions can be of biological advantage, and discuss how coupled folding and binding may occur in cells. transient helicity of the B region in the absence of KIX domain binding is only 10%. pKID residues corresponding to A exhibit 50% transient helicity in their free form. conformational selection postulates that free disordered proteins sample the structures of their bound states. dogan et al. showed that the NCBD-ACTR interaction involves a transient priming state, whereas most of the specific hydrophobic contacts are established after this rate-limiting encounter. the first encounter probably driven by conformational selection, followed by a structural rearrangement that could easily pass as an induced fit mechanism. exclusive induced fit mechanisms have been proposed for some disorder-to-order transitions. 530,546548 Given their high degree of conformational plasticity, disordered proteins may be particularly prone to mixed binding behaviors. disordered proteins enable faster protein\u2013protein interactions due to their extended hydrodynamic radii and enhanced ligand-capture efficiencies. 447,449 Kriwacki and co-workers provided important insights into how much disorder is needed for the cellular functions of the cyclin-dependent kinase regulators p21 and p27.559,560. in vitro, -synuclein interacts with negatively charged lipid vesicles and artificial membranes. in vitro, -synuclein interacts with negatively charged lipid vesicles and artificial membranes. -synuclein is enriched at presynaptic terminals and colocalizes with synaptic vesicles, suggesting that the protein also exists in helical membrane-bound conformations in vivo. a recent study by the George group is of particular interest. -synuclein overexpressed in yeast cells abolishes -synuclein membrane staining and results in diffuse cytoplasmic localization. these indirect observations support the notion that membrane-bound -synuclein exists in helical conformations in cells. ubiquitin ligase Cdc4.512 Sic1 is degraded in response to multisite phosphorylation. binding to Cdc4.586 Cdc4 recognizes six different phosphorylation sites of Sic1. the concept of fuzzy complexes also offers a means of describing modulatory cellular effects along a continuum of stabilizing and destabilizing interactions. low abundance mRNAs encode disordered proteins involved in organ development and differentiation. the authors found a weak correlation between intrinsic disorder, mRNA expression levels and predicted protein abundance. cellular quantity/regulation mechanism ordered

\u201cconstruct\u201d their three-dimensional structures, leaving them fewer degrees of freedom to accommodate substitutions. globular proteins exhibit fewer intramolecular contacts, their primary amino acid structures tolerate mutational changes better. a sequence analysis of 62 dual-coding regions revealed that their protein products are particularly rich in disordered regions. this mechanism results in novel functions and also protects mRNAs from nonsense-mediated decay. alternative splicing is particularly versatile in controlling protein diversity and abundance. proteolytic processing of the Bcl-2 family of proteins is one example. these proteins contain extended (50 residues) disordered loop regions. opposing phosphorylation- and site-specific caspase cleavage-reactions within these loops disrupt or enforce existing interactions. the desintegrin and metalloproteinase family of proteases dissociates the disordered N-terminus of PrPc from its membrane-bound C-terminus. other proteases such as calpain and cathepsins target PrPsc at different sites, generating longer and shorter N- and C-terminal fragments. Dunker and Lin compared the genetic distances of ordered and disordered proteins within 26 families. their analysis showed that disorder-rich regions in otherwise ordered proteins evolve more rapidly. authors propose that these differences primarily arise because globular proteins typically employ more residues to \u201cconstruct\u201d their three-dimensional structures. a sequence analysis of 62 dual-coding regions revealed that their protein products are particularly rich in disordered regions. alternative splice-site selection can also entail the use of different exon combinations to generate functionally distinct proteins. isoforms of disordered proteins are also generated on the protein level by targeted proteolysis. some of these cleavage reactions produce toxic fragments, including aggregation prone species. others result in modified proteins with novel functions. cleavage of PrPc dissociates the disordered N-terminus of PrPc from its membrane-bound C-terminus. other proteases target PrPsc at different sites, generating longer and shorter N- and C-terminal fragments. disordered proteins are more susceptible to proteolysis than ordered proteins. disordered proteins provide unrestricted access to proteases over their entire lengths. disordered polypeptides are preferred Lon substrates. ordered proteins require ATP-dependent disassembly to be degraded. similar observations were made for proteasome system. we discussed in vitro aspects of proteolytic processing. we discussed in vitro aspects of proteolytic processing. we discussed in vitro aspects of proteolytic processing. ubiquitination sites are more abundant in disordered and ordered proteins. many in vivo studies suggest disordered proteins are not degraded appreciably faster than ordered ones. the importance of disorder at protein ends in steering degradation is likely to affect these processes. in other cases, partial degradation may preserve the globular tags. another issue may relate to the use of data sets from different cellular systems. disordered proteins are likely bound by other biomolecules in cells. -synuclein exists in a membrane-bound conformation that entails its first 100 residues. many disordered proteins are likely bound by other biomolecules in cells, modulating their degradation. nascent disordered protein regions transiently interact with ribosomal proteins until sequences emerge that interact with nanny proteins. proteasome gatekeepers and nanny proteins function as protective chaperones preserving the integrity of disordered proteins. intrinsically disordered proteins are not targeted by ubiquitination to an appreciable greater extent than ordered proteins. a large portion of recent IDP/chaperone literature addresses the functional roles of chaperones as cellular anti-aggregation factors. we focus on intrinsic disorder as an inherent structural property of chaperones. chaperones facilitate protein folding and counteract interactions that result in misfolding. entropy transfer reactions transmit conformational entropy to misfolded proteins. dehydrins such as -synuclein349,350 are entirely disordered yet prevent temperature-induced aggregation of several substrates. nematode AavLEA1 and plant Em protect organisms from desiccation-induced aggregation of citrate synthase. RNA chaperones resolve misfolded RNA species, which critically depends on their disordered regions. some partially disordered ribosomal proteins, such as L16 and L18 exhibit dual protein and RNA chaperoning activities. -synuclein does not bind Hsp70 according to fluorescence anisotropy and pull-down affinity capture experiments. -synuclein does not bind Hsp70 according to fluorescence anisotropy. disordered proteins facilitate protein folding and counteract interactions that result in misfolding. chaperones prevent and reverse protein aggregation and ameliorate refolding. dehydrins such as nematode AavLEA1 and plant Em protect organisms from desiccation-induced aggregation of citrate synthase. dehydrins are entirely disordered yet prevent temperature-induced aggregation of several substrates. disorder extends to the realm of RNA and is common in RNA chaperones. some partially disordered ribosomal proteins, such as L16 and L18 exhibit dual protein and RNA chaperoning activities. -synuclein does not bind Hsp70 according to fluorescence anisotropy and pull-down affinity capture experiments. -synuclein does not bind Hsp70 according to fluorescence anisotropy. prone, hydrophobic and disordered polypeptides are preferred substrates for yeast ribosome-associated Hsp70,370. cotranslational ubiquitination was not found to be statistically different in ordered and disordered proteins. eukaryotic proteins rapidly adopt different structural and functional states in response to internal and external cues. scores for pS, pT, pY, acK, meK, and meR (black) and nonmodified residues (green) were calculated as the ratio of O-glycosylation sites in predicted IDRs. for nonmodified sites, the ratio of serines/threonines in IDRs was determined over their numbers in the same set of proteins, ref (379). eukaryotic PTMs occur in disordered protein regions. disorder provides unrestricted access for modifying and demodifying enzymes. disorder is overrepresented in signaling proteins and in proteins controlling gene activity. modifications modulate protein stability, DNA binding and transcription. tau contains 75 verified and 85 predicted phosphorylation sites. only 7 of these sites are annotated and known to affect microtubule binding. lysine acetylation is the most abundant modification in eukaryotes. methyltransferases and demethylases mediate lysine and arginine methylation. protein phosphatases are ten-times less abundant than kinases, 407. no consensus sequence has been determined for the broadly acting transcriptional regulator and acetyltransferase CBP/p300. however, in vitro studies suggest that it follows the classical Theorell-Chance \u201chit and run\u201d model. some surrounding residues confer low-level binding specificity. many of the 100 human SH2 domains, for example, bind phospho-tyrosines with dissociation constants above 10 M. cellular scavenging of ROS and RNS constitutes a process of fundamental biological importance. it is often implicated in human disorders, although it is difficult to determine whether oxidative modifications are a cause or a consequence of the disease. nitrated tyrosines generally occur at low abundance and only 0.01% of all tyrosine are nitrated under inflammatory conditions. nitrated tau is found in brain plaques of Alzheimer\u2019s patients and nitration inhibits tau binding to microtubules. methionine oxidation appears to be balanced by endogenous methionine reductase activities. methionine sulfoxide reductases are less active when acidic residues precede the modified methionines. oxidation of all four -synuclein methionines results in a decompaction of the protein,445 inhibits its fibrillization. cellular proteins continuously experience transient, chemically distinct modifications, many of which with no biological function. differences in growth conditions and intracellular environments may further embellish the heterogeneity of physiological modification patterns. here, we discuss the role of disordered proteins in processing PTM \u201cnoise\u201d. a single protein can promote the establishment of additional modifications in a stepwise manner or ramp up binding affinities to new partners. low-level PTM noise may actually improve signaling sensitivity and robustness by allowing faster responses without the requirement for positional substrate site conservation. kinase activation overcomes the signaling threshold that triggers the robust biological response. many IDPs undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to cognate partners. binding conformations often transiently sampled in their free states. short peptides derived from the proline-rich regions of human tau induce poly proline type II helices,488,491. this is particularly intriguing given the large number of proline-directed kinases and kinase consensus sequences. PTM effects on IDP compaction Besides altering the conformations of IDPs, modifications can also affect their global appearance. lower compaction has been reported for mutant version of tau that contained six serine/threonine to glutamic acid substitutions. the occurrence of PTMs in disordered proteins exceeds often the three to four modifications per protein mentioned above. most are disordered or contain extended disordered regions. p53 contains 20 annotated PTM sites. study suggests 65% of these sites may lack unique functional roles. most modifications are present substoichiometrically (occupancy below 50%), meaning roughly equal numbers of substrate molecules lack the modification. phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic proteins, whereas Ser-Pro constitutes 20% of all phosphorylated serine residues. dephosphorylating enzymes, i.e., protein phosphatases are ten-times less abundant than kinases,407 which is also reflected in their weaker substrate site specificities. abundant proteins, prone to random encounters with kinases and phosphatases, are more frequently phosphorylated in disordered proteins. 8% of all serines and threonines are phosphorylated in disordered proteins. the number is only 2.5% in ordered ones. the 7 human phospho-serine and phospho-threonine specific 14\u20133\u20133 domain isoforms (up to 15 in plants) are not specific and interact with target sites within multiple kinase consensus motifs. Tudor-, PHD-, and chromo-domains bind methylated lysines irrespective of sequence context. nitrated tyrosines generally occur at low abundance and only 0.01% of all tyrosine are nitrated under inflammatory conditions,435,437 they may serve as important disease factors. nitrated tyrosines may function as immunogenic signals that activate inflammatory responses. methionine oxidation does not occur randomly, although no particular class of proteins, nor subcellular compartment are preferentially affected. studies of independent replicates of H2O2 exposed mammalian Jurkat cells show that methionine oxidation does not occur randomly. oxidative modifications are mediated by reactive oxygen species that accumulate with aging, impairment of oxidative stress response pathways and inflammation. many neurodegenerative diseases are age-related and associated with neuro-inflammation, but many functional roles of oxidative modifications were postulated early on. dephosphorylating enzymes, i.e., protein phosphatases are ten-times less abundant than kinases,407 which is also reflected in their weaker substrate site specificities. kinases are often tethered to subcellular structures such as membranes or occur as parts of immobile scaffolding complexes. 8% of all serines and threonines are phosphorylated in disordered proteins. the number is only 2.5% in ordered ones. disordered proteins are frequently targeted by cellular modifications. -serine and phospho-threonine specific 14\u20133\u20133 domain isoforms are not specific and interact with target sites within multiple kinase consensus motifs. Tudor-, PHD-, and chromo-domains bind methylated lysines irrespective of sequence context. nitrated tyrosines generally occur at low abundance and only 0.01% of all tyrosine are nitrated under inflammatory conditions,435,437 they may serve as important disease factors. nitrated tyrosines may function as immunogenic signals that activate inflammatory responses. methionine oxidation does not occur randomly, although no particular class of proteins, nor subcellular compartment are preferentially affected. 85% of the characterized modification sites show oxidation levels of 30%. methionine oxidation does not reach full penetrance. oxidative modifications are mediated by reactive oxygen species that accumulate with aging. many neurodegenerative diseases are age-related and associated with neuro-inflammation. 446 functional roles of oxidative modifications in these diseases were postulated early on. DPs.450,454 These properties are equally important in cell signaling, which requires transient interactions with multiple partners. a number of signaling pathways exhibit ultrasensitive responses. a number of signaling pathways exhibit ultrasensitive responses. k1 inhibitor Sic1 is intrinsically disordered and contains seven Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. Upon Cdc4 binding, Sic1 is degraded and full Cdk1 activity required for entering S-phase is established. phosphorylation events may occur at low abundance in the absence of sustained Cdk1 activity. several studies investigated the influence of glycosylation and phosphorylation on peptide secondary structures. these effects depend on the nature of the glycan and the protein sequence context. phosphorylation can also induce or stabilize -helical structures via side-chain salt bridges. serine/threonine phosphorylation N-terminal to prolines does not affect cis/trans equilibria.500503 However, in cells, proline cis/trans isomers may be differently sequestered by binding partners, which may, in turn, change equilibrium distributions. ubiquitination and sumoylation introduce new interaction surfaces that may mask, reveal, or modulate IDP structures. cellular modifications greatly expand the chemical heterogeneity of these proteins, which in turn increases their structural and functional diversity. lix positions destabilizes the secondary structure, whereas N-terminal phosphorylation stabilizes -helices. these properties are often mentioned in relation to secondary structure changes in response to modifications occurring in vivo. lower compaction has been reported for a mutant version of tau that contained six serine/threonine to glutamic acid substitutions. 510,511 Similarly, multisite phosphorylation of Sic1 leads to compaction of this positively charged protein. the induced fit mechanism and conformational selection can be of biological advantage. the disordered and ordered ligand is shown in red (D and O, respectively), the folded binding partner (P) is shown in gray. pKID residues corresponding to A exhibit 50% transient helicity in their free form. pKID residues corresponding to A exhibit 50% transient helicity in their free form. pKID residues corresponding to A exhibit 50% transient helicity in their free form. selection is based on the work of the late Flemming Poulsen. his group established that the free nuclear coactivator binding domain (NCBD) exists in a conformation resembling its structure in the p160 coactivator-bound complex. they further determined that NCBD adopts this conformation 90% of the time. binding via conformational selection alone is unlikely to result in the observed high affinity complexes. binding via conformational selection alone is unlikely to result in the observed high affinity complexes. effects may enhance or reduce binding free energies and thereby improve or weaken molecular recognition. it is difficult to predict how these parameters modulate cellular disorder-to-order transitions. it has been suggested disordered proteins enable faster protein\u2013protein interactions due to their extended hydrodynamic radii and enhanced ligand-capture efficiencies. mutants with shorter LH domains fail to induce cell-cycle arrest. p21 and p27 disorder specifically tune binding affinities toward Cdk-cyclins in vitro and in vivo. lipid environments rather than protein interactions mediate folding transitions of -synuclein. -synuclein binds different membranes in different -helical conformations. in cells, -synuclein is enriched at presynaptic terminals and colocalizes with synaptic vesicles. -synuclein overexpressed in yeast cells abolishes -synuclein membrane staining and results in diffuse cytoplasmic localization. these results provide compelling evidence for the existence of membrane-bound pools of -synuclein under physiological conditions. forman-Kay and co-workers studied another example of a fuzzy complex. the interaction between phosphorylated Sic1 and the ubiquitin ligase Cdc4.512 Sic1 is degraded in response to multisite phosphorylation. the concept of fuzzy complexes also offers a means of describing modulatory cellular effects along a continuum of stabilizing and destabilizing interactions. ID undergoes an induced fit disorder-to-order transition and docks onto the KIX domain in a second, -helical conformation (B) forming the final, high-affinity complex. transient helicity of the B region in the absence of KIX domain binding is only 10%. BD adopts this conformation, described as a molten globule, 90% of the time. this interaction involves a transient priming state, whereas most of the specific hydrophobic contacts are established after this rate-limiting encounter. this interaction too requires at least 2 steps, with the first likely driven by conformational selection. IDP-ligand complexes often contain additional structural features that are not populated in their free states. exclusive induced fit mechanisms have been proposed for some disorder-to-order transitions. mixed mechanisms have been suggested for others. p21 and p27.559,560 bind Cdk-cyclins via interactions of their D1 and D2 subdomains. p21 inhibits Cdk2-cyclin A activity and establishes cell-cycle arrest in G1, whereas p21 broadly inhibits Cdk-cyclin complexes. degrees of p21 and p27 disorder specifically tune their binding affinities and specificities toward Cdk-cyclins in vitro and in vivo. -synuclein interacts with negatively charged lipid vesicles and artificial membranes, such as SDS micelles and unilamellar vesicles. -synuclein binds different membranes in different -helical conformations. in cells, -synuclein is enriched at presynaptic terminals and colocalizes with synaptic vesicles. a recent study by the George group is of particular interest. -synuclein overexpressed in yeast cells abolishes -synuclein membrane staining and results in diffuse cytoplasmic localization. these results provide compelling evidence for the existence of membrane-bound pools of -synuclein under physiological conditions. ay and co-workers studied another example of a fuzzy complex, the interaction between phosphorylated Sic1 and the ubiquitin ligase Cdc4.512 Sic1. the concept of fuzzy complexes also offers a means of describing modulatory cellular effects along a continuum of stabilizing and destabilizing interactions. the concept of fuzzy complexes also offers a means of describing modulatory cellular effects along a continuum of stabilizing and destabil insoluble aggregates of the prion protein are synonymous with Creutzfeld-Jacob's disease (CJD) insoluble fibrils of Huntingtin are characteristic of Huntington's disease (HD) in their native states, these proteins are either fully or largely disordered, while they adopt extended -sheet structures in their aggregated forms. the disease is characterized by proteinaceus cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies,595,596 which primarily contain -synuclein amyloid fibrils. the disease is characterized by proteinaceus cytoplasmic inclusions known as lewy bodies,595,596. sions of poly glutamine repeats (polyQ) are encountered in many human disorders. the disease is characterized by the formation of granular and fibrous deposits of the Huntingtin protein in the nuclei and cytoplasm of several neuronal cell types, leading to pervasive cell death. s -synuclein is abundantly expressed in various parts of the brain. most sporadic cases of PD occur late in life, enforcing the notion that age, and age-related cellular processes constitute important disease factors. unrelated protein Sup35p acts as a release factor during translation termination. RNA polymerase reads through stop codons, which results in greater protein diversity and the generation of new protein activities that are beneficial for survival. aggregation properties such as macromolecular crowding, intracellular viscosity, post-translational protein modifications and ligand binding affect aggregation in vivo. most mechanisms entail initial steps of native ensemble perturbations that produce partially folded intermediates. monomeric proteins are continuously consumed by initial oligomeric species that eventually extend into mature amyloid fibrils. more detailed mechanisms have been reported, some of which depend on the nature of the aggregating protein or on specific aggregation conditions. interactions with binding partners, post-translational protein modifications and intracellular macromolecular crowding conditions exert additional effects. intracellular environments and extracellular fluids contain large amounts of macromolecules, reaching concentrations of up to 300\u2013500 g/L. ozyme, ficoll, and dextran concentrations range from 100 mg/mL to 150 mg/mL. aggregation-enhancing effects were attributed to a selective decrease in the lag-phases of the respective aggregation processes. these effects were less pronounced, supporting the notion that higher viscosity slows down diffusion-controlled additions of monomers. cellular conditions and activities, including post-translational protein modifications, likely modulate in vivo aggregation kinetics and aggregate morphologies. cellular conditions and activities, including post-translational protein modifications and biological interactions, likely modulate in vivo aggregation kinetics. nitration no fibrillation spherical aggregates (696, 697) monoubiquitination: (694) Lys10 no change amyloid fibrils Lys6, Lys12, Lys21, Lys23 inhibition (>3-fold) amyloid fibrils/proto-fibrils Lys32, Lys34, Lys43, Lys96 no fibrillation monomers/amorphous aggregates. theaflavins no fibrillation spherical aggregates (753) dopamine no fibrillation amorphous aggregates (734) -synuclein (2:1) inhibition (2-fold) amyloid fibrils -synuclein (2:1) inhibition (>4-fold) amyloid fibrils (331) chaperones. each condition was compared to the aggregation rates of -synuclein control samples -synuclein, Tau and other disease related IDPs are examples. 90% of the protein is phosphorylated at Ser129, whereas only 4% of cytosolic -synuclein is modified. phosphorylation promotes aggregation in vivo. the increased net charge and electrostatic repulsions between -synuclein monomers were put forward as explanations for these inhibitory effects. 680,681 This example illustrates the difficulties to correlation with changes in in vitro aggregation behaviors to effects observed in vivo. -synuclein methionine oxidation induces soluble oligomers that do not aggregate into amyloid fibrils in vitro. -synuclein methionine oxidation induces soluble oligomers that do not aggregate into amyloid fibrils in vitro. in vitro experiments revealed diminished aggregation propensities of Thr3-, Ser13-, and Ser16-phosphorylated protein. phosphomimetics had opposing effects on Tau aggregation, which depend on the targeted protein region. interactions are of particular interest because of the strong link between cellular metal homeostasis and neurodegenerative disorders. 609,625,718720 Cu was identified as a potent enhancer of -synuclein, A and tau oligomerization and/or fibrillation. Chaperones such as the heat shock proteins Hsp20, Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp104 prevent -synuclein aggregation and exert neuro-protective effects in several cell and animal models of PD. ecular crowding, cellular post-translational modifications and ligand interactions affect aggregation in vitro. early transmission electron-microscopy studies on amyloids extracted from post-mortem tissues revealed that their overall -rich structures are similar to fibrils grown in vitro. TEM images of A fibrils grown in vitro from pathological seeds of two Alzheimer\u2019s patients. yellow arrows point to fibrils with reduced diameters and periodic twists. labels indicate cross-peak assignments for patient 2 fibrils. oligomeric and fibrillar A (1\u201342) peptides were detected within 1 h of incubation. 10% exhibited curvatures and distortion angles similar to amyloid fibrils from Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients. in situ measurements revealed that -synuclein distributed evenly throughout the cells at early time points, whereas it accumulated in cytoplasmic inclusions after 48 h. -synuclein aggregation occurred faster in SH-SY5Y cells than in vitro. the advent of technologies to generate appropriate cellular systems for studying IDP aggregation offers exciting new possibilities in this direction. the advent of technologies to generate such appropriate cellular systems for studying IDP aggregation offers exciting new possibilities in this direction. aggregation of disordered proteins results in cell damage and pathology. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. it is characterized by progressive memory loss and dementia. prion disease is a neurological disorder manifested by insoluble deposits of the prion protein (PrP) 598 Prion aggregates are transmissible and can be passed on similar to an infectious agent. PrPSc is self-propagating and catalyzes further conversions of PrPC into PrPSc. the brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because it consumes approximately one-fifth of the inspired oxygen and metabolizes ATP at high rates. 5% of all oxygen consumed by cells is converted into reactive oxygen species (ROS), levels in the brain are higher than in other tissues. kinases (MAPKs), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalases display age-related declines of their activities. co-occurrence of both effects may render an abundant, intrinsically disordered protein particularly prone to oxidative damage. d Pmel17 forms amyloid-like fibrils in specialized organelles of epithelial cells called melanosomes. these structures act as polymerization seeds for small molecules forming melanin fibers that protect cells from UV and oxidative damage. aggregation prevents melanin-associated toxicity by sequestering intermediate on-pathway species in the course of polymer formation. in the nucleation phase, oligomers aggregate via partially folded intermediates into soluble oligomers. in the stationary phase, proto-fibrils mature into amyloids. studies aimed at characterizing on-pathway species in vitro and the structural properties of early A, -synuclein and amylin oligomers have been analyzed to great detail. higher-order fibrils are insoluble and stain positive for dyes such as Congo red and Thioflavin T.645 They typically comprise 2 to 6 proto-filaments. several studies dissected the individual contributions of crowding and viscosity to IDP aggregation. a selective decrease in the lag-phases of the respective aggregation processes, indicating that the formation of early oligomers is favored under crowded conditions. dextran enhanced aggregation in a concentration dependent manner (4-fold and higher at 200 g/L) in vitro, crowding further prompted fibrillation of GSK3-phosphorylated Tau. similar aggregation-promoting effects in crowded in vitro solutions were also reported for peptides, amylin, tau and the prion protein. amyloid fibrils (661, 663) lysozyme (50 g/L) enhancement (5-fold) amyloid fibrils (661, 663) glycerol (40%) enhancement (3-fold) amyloid

defined as the formation of Thioflavin-T (ThT) positive aggregates. each condition was compared to the aggregation rates of -synuclein control samples. -synuclein deposits in PD patients showed that 90% of the protein is phosphorylated at Ser129, whereas only 4% of cytosolic -synuclein is modified.675 These results led to the hypothesis that phosphorylation promotes aggregation in vivo. phosphorylation of -synuclein increases affinity to Cu and Fe. truncations of -synuclein correlate with enhanced aggregation in vitro and in vivo. -synuclein is isolated from post-mortem PD patients\u2019 brains. phosphorylation, tyrosine nitration and methionine oxidation also decrease the avidity of -synuclein membrane interactions. phosphomimetics had opposing effects on Tau aggregation, which depended on the targeted protein region. positions 13 and 16 reduce aggregate formation in vitro and in vivo. in vitro experiments revealed diminished aggregation propensities of Thr3-, Ser13-, and Ser16-phosphorylated protein. these results underscore the importance of cellular post-translational modifications in defining the aggregation behaviors of IDPs. oxidation or dityrosine cross-linking may also promote aggregation. ligands such as polyamines, dopamine, or other oxidized cathechols may also promote aggregation. ligands may also inhibit aggregation. oligomers of expanded polyQ-tract Huntingtin correlate well with their generic roles in repressing intracellular potein aggregation and cytotoxicity. in most of these cases, chaperone-mediated antiaggregation activities result from direct interactions with target IDPs. mers in the amyloid core and novel side-chain interactions within the strand-bend-strand motifs emerged.774 The Tycko group further showed that native A amyloids have structural and/or biochemical features that modulate the outcomes of in vitro aggregation processes. a recent application analyzed the behaviors of A (1\u201340) and A (1\u201342) peptides in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells. however, new evidence suggests that intracellular deposits are also involved in pathogenesis. similar fluorescence imaging techniques were employed to study intracellular aggregation of -synuclein. similar fluorescence imaging techniques were employed to study intracellular aggregation of -synuclein. -synuclein aggregation occurred faster in SH-SY5Y cells than in vitro. -synuclein displays reduced aggregation propensities and forms oligomeric structures rather than characteristic amyloid fibrils. molecular simulations are an integral part of IDP investigations. they have been used extensively to simulate the structural properties of disordered proteins. the following features make them attractive vehicles for exploring the behavior of disordered proteins. a number of groups have devised computational strategies to recapitulate the physical properties of the E. coli cytoplasm in silico. in 1996, Bicout and Field performed the first dynamic simulation of this kind. they assumed a mixture of three different types of macromolecules: ribosomes, tRNA, and proteins. the authors determined that the average diffusion coefficients of GFP-sized molecules are decreased 2-fold relative to dilute solutions. by then, it was known that this decrease was smaller than what had been observed experimentally. the next advance in dynamically modeling the bacterial cytoplasm was reported by McGuffee and Elcock. the only meaningful way to model IDPs is to include internal protein dynamics and conformational motions. the only meaningful way to model IDPs is to include internal protein dynamics and conformational motions. omitting the latter can lead to drastic underestimations of cellular diffusion coefficients. 149,821,822 Mammalian cells can be targeted with isotope-labeled, cell penetrating peptide-tagged cargo proteins for active intracellular transport.823,824 Alternatively, cells can be permeabilized with pore-forming bacterial toxins to enable passive infusion of isotope-labeled proteins. \u201ctumbling\u201d of ordered proteins is primarily governed by their molecular size. small proteins tumble faster and their NMR signals relax slower. fast relaxing NMR signals give rise to sharp resonance cross peaks. the intracellular environment often affects dynamic processes such as chemical reactions or conformational exchange on the s to ms time scale. such effects are abundant in disordered protein regions exhibiting features of transient secondary structure or for protein segments that adopt multiple conformations. some were primarily geared toward understanding post-translational protein modifications in intact cells. s.842 Opponents contested the existence of a tetramer with results from similar experimental approaches. the groups of Selkoe and Petsko argue that the use of denaturing agents or boiling of bacterial cell lysates during initial purification steps destroys the alleged tetramer conformation and results in the accumulation of monomeric species. dedmon et al. exploited this behavior to investigate the conformational properties of FlgM in different in vitro and in vivo environments. in e. coli, the same NMR resonances that disappear upon 28 binding are not detected. in-cell NMR spectra of tau revealed several NMR signals indicative of phosphorylated amino acids. in-cell NMR results indicate feasibility of high-resolution IDP studies in prokaryotic cells. fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), fluorescence correlation and image correlation techniques. FRAP and FLIP exploit photobleaching to monitor molecular diffusion. in FRAP, an intense laser pulse is used to bleach a small region of the cell. correlating fluorescence signal over time and space thus provides data on molecular mobility, oligomeric distributions, and binding of small fluorescent moieties to larger molecular assemblies or vesicles. photobleaching measurements can be used to count the number of fluorescent subunits (i.e., monomers) in oligomers. distance sensitive F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy provides a way to monitor protein\u2013protein interactions or conformational changes, in cells. the most common applications of FRET involve two labels with spectrally distinct fluorescence emissions. super-resolution imaging methods provide even more information on intracellular protein localization and motion. super-resolution methods have been used to probe oligomerization and localization of at least three different IDPs in cells providing valuable data on the formation and morphology. 134 PGK was more stable, folding was faster and the PGK population was more homogeneous in the nucleus of U2OS bone cancer cells than in the endoplasmic reticulum or the cytoplasm. however, PGK folding displayed a two-state, rather than multistate character in the ER. FReI has since been applied to -synuclein875 and has the potential to reveal both the stability of the proteins in cells and the FPs derived from other organisms can be obtained by mutating of Ala206 to Lys. FPs reported to be monomeric have, in some cases, been found to promote dimerization. FPs may affect the conformational behaviors of IDPs via weak intra- or intermolecular interactions. the authors introduced a tetra-Cys motif into a loop region of the folded cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) and expressed it in E. coli. in the absence of tetra-Cys CRABP, FlAsH has a low quantum yield882 and the cells showed little fluorescence signal. biarsenic dyes bind to the linear sequence Cys-Cys-X-Y-Cys-Cys-Cys. this allows the design of split-tetra-Cys motifs on adjacent beta strands that bind FlAsH only when the sheets are properly oriented. polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats from the Huntingtin exon 1 to the C-terminus of tetra-Cys CRABP investigated IDP aggregate formation in E. coli. in-cell aggregation of tetra-Cys CRABP-Huntingtin-40 (where 40 is the length of the polyQ repeat) depend on the length of the polyQ tracts. polyQ monomers and small oligomers in cells show dim, diffuse fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm. larger, less mobile inclusion bodies result in intense, punctate fluorescence. FRAP experiments revealed short polyQ tracts containing 35 repeats were mobile in 3 to 4 day old nematodes. onodera and co-workers have built an in-cell FRET sensor for oligomerization by expressing mixtures of polyQ constructs labeled with different FPs. FRET in mobile oligomers was only observed when the FPs were on the same termini of the polyQ construct (polyQ-CFP plus polyQ-YFP, or CFP-polyQ plus YFP-polyQ) polyQ repeats can be monitored over time as cells age and die providing data on cytotoxic species. some gene knockdowns that reduced inclusion body formation of a polyQ with 35 repeats (Q35) resulted in increased toxicity, arguing that soluble oligomers can be cytotoxic. studies using luciferase,911 or FP complementation912 have focused on the Parkinson\u2019s disease associated protein -synuclein and the A peptides associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. fluorescently labeled IDPs have been used to monitor cell\u2013cell spread of oligomers and oligomerization in real time. overexpression of the molecular chaperone Hsp70 reduced cytotoxicity in C. elegans. overexpression of -synuclein-FP constructs resulted in secretion into the extracellular medium. overexpression of -synuclein-FP constructs resulted in secretion into the extracellular medium. a number of groups have pursued alternative labeling strategies using smaller organic fluorophores. the biarsenical dye, FlAsH, was employed to monitor the aggregation of -synuclein modified with a C-terminal tetra-Cys tag in mammalian cells. fluorescently labeled A peptides localize to synapses and cluster glutamate receptors when incubated with live hippocampal neurons. similar localization of oligomers was observed by immunofluorescence for hippocampal neurons incubated with unlabeled oligomers937. the exact characteristics of cell bound species depended on which cell-types and A peptides, i.e., A (1\u201340) or A (1\u201342)934 were used. in all of these experiments, as well as in experiments using higher peptide concentrations,926,927 the distribution of oligomeric states shifted from mainly monomeric in solution to dimers and higher-order oligomers on the surface of cells. protein FTIR spectra contain different regions characteristic for different modes of vibration. the amide I band in particular (1655 cm\u20131) is sensitive to protein secondary structure because its spectral features are affected by the different hydrogen-bond patterns in -helices, -sheets, and disordered structures. FTIR microspectroscopy applications in cells and tissues have focused almost entirely on intracellular aggregation of A, Huntingtin and the Prion protein. IR spectra of different sample areas are spatially matched with immuno-electron, or -fluorescence microscopy. Miller et al. investigated thioflavin S-positive inclusions in brain slices of AD patients. they found -aggregate characteristic absorption bands at 1625 cm\u20131.958. the -sheet contents of these species are lower than those of in vitro aggregated A fibrils. FTIR microspectroscopy studies convey several important points. they show intracellular IDP aggregates are structurally inhomogeneous, which contrasts with results obtained in vitro. they also show that aggregate accumulation correlates with disease progression. simulations of intracellular environments are to be weighted against two main disadvantages. the first is the accuracy of the energy functions used to describe intra- and intermolecular interactions. the second is the problem of \u201csampling\u201d. in 1996, Bicout and Field performed the first dynamic simulation of this kind. they assumed a mixture of three different types of macromolecules: ribosomes, tRNA, and proteins, all of which were modeled as spheres. they showed that translational diffusion is approximately 2-fold slower in their model than in dilute solution. hydrophobic intracellular encounters are consistent with \u201csoft\u201d interactions exerting important modulatory effects on translational diffusion. these soft interactions recapitulated the destabilizing effects of the cytoplasm on the apparent folding thermodynamics of the CRABP protein. in 1996, Bicout and Field performed the first dynamic simulation of this kind.803 they assumed a mixture of three different types of macromolecules: ribosomes, tRNA, and proteins, all of which were modeled as spheres. they showed that translational diffusion is approximately 2-fold slower in their model than in dilute solution. the authors were able to adjust the simulated diffusion behavior of GFP until it corresponded to its measured in vivo properties. these soft interactions recapitulated the destabilizing effects of the cytoplasm on the apparent folding thermodynamics of the CRABP protein. high-resolution in-cell NMR spectroscopy exploits atomic resolution properties of solution state NMR in the context of individual isotope-labeled proteins. in bacteria, intracellular enrichment is achieved via the induction of recombinant protein expression in the presence of isotope-labeled metabolic precursors. high-resolution in-cell NMR spectroscopy does not yield spatial information about intracellular protein localizations. it provides ensemble descriptions of the combined effects that the cellular environment exerts on the isotope-labeled protein under investigation. high intracellular viscosity slows down rotational diffusion or tumbling. high intracellular viscosity slows down rotational diffusion. high intracellular viscosity slows down rotational diffusion. in-cell NMR studies on -synuclein feature most prominently. recent reports that relieve the protein of its disordered status by postulating a folded helical tetramer as representing the relevant in vivo structure. -synuclein tretramer evaded detection for so many years. earlier in-cell NMR reports on -synuclein showed the protein is monomeric and disordered in intact E. coli cells. 450g/L), BSA- (400 g/L), or ovalbumin-crowded (450 g/L) in vitro solutions revealed that the observed transition depends on the absolute amount of the respective crowding agent. transient weak interactions can similarly explain the disappearance of FlgM NMR signals. 850 in-cell NMR methods are well-suited to report on in vivo characteristics of IDPs in a fully integrated manner. fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy provide relatively simple ways to monitor localization, oligomerization, and diffusion of IDPs in cells and on cell surfaces. in FRAP, an intense laser pulse is used to bleach a small region of the cell. fluorescently labeled protein can diffuse into the bleached region within the experimental time scale fluorescence intensity in this region recovers. but in this case the photobleaching beam is constantly on. oligomers move relatively slow, i.e. when proteins bind to DNA857 or to cell membranes.858860 In these experiments, the number of photobleaching steps report on the number of monomers in a single region of interest and thereby provide information on the stoichiometry of oligomers. the most common applications of FRET involve two labels with spectrally distinct fluorescence emissions. in vitro174 and in cells,134 FRET can be used to monitor conformational changes and conformational distributions. FRET can also be used to monitor protein\u2013protein interactions, oligomer formation and conformational changes within oligomers. the ability to quickly manipulate the cellular environment provides valuable information on protein stability and the conformations accessible to IDPs and folded proteins. FReI has since been applied to -synuclein875 and has the potential to reveal both the stability of the proteins and the folding kinetics. fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy requires labeling of IDPs with fluorescent molecules. FPs are quite large (27 kDa) compared to many IDPs and FP fusions can lead to experimental artifacts. monomeric FP variants should be used for all experiments. tetra-Cys motifs and biarsenical dyes bind to tetra-Cys motifs. they are membrane permeable and allow facile in-cell labeling. they also show significant increases in fluorescence quantum yield. tetra-Cys CRABP was destabilized in E. coli relative to in vitro experiments. tetra-Cys motifs and biarsenical probes provide a powerful tool for in-cell measurements of protein stability and protein aggregation. 215 FlAsH binding was reversible and the aggregation kinetics were not significantly altered by the N-terminal tetra-Cys motif or by FlAsH binding. the early and swift increase in fluorescence intensity indicated that oligomers formed quickly and the later, coincident increase in ThT fluorescence intensity as well as FRET. tetra-Cys CRABP constructs with longer polyQ tracts formed detergent insoluble aggregates over time. long polyQ tracts also resulted in long, filamentous bacteria. polyQ-FP constructs with 33 repeats were mobile in young nematodes. the high fluorescence intensity from inclusion bodies obscures lower intensity fluorescence signals from smaller, more mobile aggregates. specific fluorescent sensors for oligomerization can be constructed by combining labeling modalities. monomers showed a high ratio of biarsenical dye fluorescence intensity to fluorescent protein intensity. soluble oligomers can be monitored over time as cells age and die. identification of cytotoxic species is key to understanding how polyQ repeats and other aggregation prone species kill cells. in-cell fluorescent techniques provide clues as to which polyQ species may be toxic, but truly deciphering the conformational distributions in cells will likely require creative applications of and innovations in fluorescence techniques combined with other techniques including NMR and ion-mobility mass spectrometry. -synuclein is enriched at the synapse where it dynamically binds to synaptic vesicles. -synuclein is localized at the presynaptic terminals, in intraluminar vesicles of multivesicular bodies and in lysosomes in neuronal cell bodies. ed protein was associated with oligomeric915 and associated with Hsp70 altering its size distribution. RNA interference screens in C. elegans designed to identify proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and lipid transport as key to reducing toxicity. oligomers of fluorescently labeled A peptides localize to synapses and cluster glutamate receptors when incubated with live hippocampal neurons. similar synaptic localization of oligomers was observed by immunofluorescence for hippocampal neurons incubated with unlabeled oligomers937. physiological A peptide concentrations range from sub-nM to low nM.939941 At these concentrations in aqueous solution, fluorescent A (1\u201340) and A (1\u201342) peptides are mainly monomeric, with small populations of dimers and trimers. fluorescence labeling of IDPs and fluorescence microscopy in cells will likely continue to be important for understanding IDP localization, function and dysfunction. fluorescence labeling of IDPs and fluorescence microscopy in cells and whole organisms will likely continue to be important for understanding IDP localization, function and dysfunction. FPs may affect conformational behaviors of IDPs via weak intra- or intermolecular interactions. IDPs may be labeled with small organic fluorophores, such as the biarsenical dyes FlAsH and ReAsH. FlAsH binding to tetra-Cys CRABP increased the quantum yield. the cells showed little fluorescence signal. tetra-Cys CRABP mutant was destabilized in E. coli. tetra-Cys motif may be split between two proteins, allowing FlAsH binding to report on protein\u2013protein interactions. the split tetra-Cys motif may be split between two proteins. tetra-Cys CRABP-Huntingtin-40 displayed both soluble and aggregated populations. long polyQ tracts also resulted in long, filamentous bacteria. the use of a flanking sequence can influence IDP aggregation. long polyQ tracts containing 35, or fewer repeats were mobile in 3 to 4 day old nematodes, tracts with 40 repeats were polydisperse with mobile and immobile fractions. polyQ constructs with 33 repeats displayed punctate fluorescence in 5 day, or older nematodes. the high fluorescence intensity from inclusion bodies obscures lower intensity fluorescence signals from smaller, more mobile aggregates. FRET in mobile oligomers and large aggregates was only observed when the FPs were on the same termini of the polyQ construct (polyQ-CFP plus polyQ-YFP), and not on different termini (i.e., polyQ-CFP plus YFP-polyQ).865 Alternatively, Hatters and colleagues combined tetra-Cys tags and FPs in the same monomers.892,902 In these experiments, monomers displayed a knockdowns that reduced inclusion body formation of a polyQ with 35 repeats (Q35) resulted in increased toxicity, again arguing that soluble oligomers can be cytotoxic. in-cell fluorescent techniques provide clues as to which polyQ species may be toxic, but truly deciphering the conformational distributions in cells will likely require creative applications. a number of groups have constructed -synuclein-eGFP fusions with the enhanced GFP at the C-terminus. -synuclein is localized at the presynaptic terminals, in intraluminar vesicles and in lysosomes in neuronal cell bodies. -synuclein-FP constructs fused to fragments of luciferase resulted in secretion into the extracellular medium. the secreted protein was often oligomeric915 and associated with Hsp70 altering its size distribution. however, RNA interference screens in C. elegans designed to identify proteins that reduced -synuclein pathology did not pull up Hsp70. super-resolution fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor -synuclein aggregates by labeling the protein with a rhodmaine spiroamide derivative, an organic fluorophore, in vitro. further super-resolution microscopy experiments either using microinjected, or photoactivatable-, photoswitchable FP-tagged protein may help elucidate how -synuclein is trafficked in cells providing more data on cellular incubation with low concentrations (250\u2013500 nM) of fluorescently labeled A peptides results in internalization and formation of intracellular aggregates.782,928 Super-resolution imaging of such in-cell aggregates revealed fibril formation by internalized, fluorescence-labeled A. oligomeric states shifted from monomeric in solution to dimers and higher-order oligomers on the surface of cells. a large portion of these oligomers showed restricted motions on cell membranes. a large portion of these oligomers showed restricted motions on cell membranes. a large portion of these oligomers showed restricted motions on cell membranes. long polyQ tracts formed detergent insoluble aggregates over time. long polyQ tracts also resulted in long, filamentous bacteria. polyQ tracts with lengths above pathological threshold seeded the formation of later, detergent resistant aggregates. inclusion body formation by polyQ-FP constructs has proven to be an extremely effective sensor for monitoring changes in protein homeostasis due to aging,897,898 osmotic899 and other stresses. the high fluorescence intensity from inclusion bodies obscures lower intensity fluorescence signals from smaller, more mobile aggregates. monomers showed a high ratio of biarsenical dye fluorescence intensity to fluorescent protein intensity. when the polyQ repeat length was above the pathogenic threshold, the ratio was also reduced in the mobile population. identification of cytotoxic species is key to understanding how polyQ repeats and other aggregation prone species kill cells. in-cell fluorescent techniques provide clues as to which polyQ species or sets of species may be toxic. but truly deciphering conformational distributions in cells will likely require creative applications of and innovations in fluorescence techniques combined with other techniques including ion-mobility mass spectrometry. -synuclein is enriched at the synapse where it dynamically binds to synaptic vesicles. -synuclein is localized at the presynaptic terminals, in intraluminar vesicles of multivesicular bodies and in lysosomes in neuronal cell bodies. elegans designed to identify proteins that reduced -synuclein pathology did not pull up Hsp70, or other molecular chaperones. these results are consistent with -synuclein\u2019s role in synaptic vesicle trafficking,918 lysosomal abnormalities observed in the nervous system of transgenic mice expressing human -synuclein-eGFP. incubation of cells with fluorescently labeled peptides can provide valuable, physiologically relevant data on how A peptides interact with the extracellular leaflet of plasma membranes. oligomers localize to synapses and cluster glutamate receptors when incubated with live hippocampal neurons. physiological A peptide concentrations range from sub-nM to low nM. single molecule fluorescence photobleaching,860,943 or multicolor934 experiments provide a way to monitor A peptides-cell interactions at these physiologically relevant concentrations. fluorescence labeling of IDPs and fluorescence microscopy in cells continues to provide facile methods for monitoring IDP conformations. fluorescence microscopy in cells and whole organisms will likely continue to be important for understanding IDP localization, function and dysfunction. recent combination of FTIR spectroscopy with light microscopy made it possible to also study aggregated IDPs in intact cells and tissues. despite these advantages, FTIR microspectroscopy also bears several drawbacks, some of which are directly linked to the physical nature of the technique. andre et al. investigated the structures of Huntingtin fibrils in brain slices of control individuals and Huntington\u2019s disease patients. FTIR microspectroscopy of amyloid fibrils of Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients displays varying degrees of -sheet content in different brain regions. Diomede et al. used FTIR microspectroscopy to monitor A aggregation in the presence of tetracyclines in C. elegans. 954 Tetracyclines inhibit A amyloid formation and are considered possible AD drugs. we discussed the elementary composition of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in terms of ions, metabolites and biological macromolecules. we described biological activities encountered in cells, such as post-translational protein modifications, and how they influence in vivo properties of intrinsically disordered proteins. we presented methods to study IDPs in silico and in intact cells. we can learn a great deal about the in vivo properties of disordered proteins. we must acknowledge that these environments only partially reflect the physical and biological contributions experienced in cells. we must strive to develop and employ tools to analyze disordered proteins in intact physiological settings."}
