{"summary": "the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) are a group of G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors that play important roles in host defense and inflammation [1,2]. they are so named because their cognate agonists are peptides bearing formylated methionine (fMet), such as those derived from bacterial and mitochondrial proteins [3,4]. the present review focuses on the FPR family members in humans and mice and their interaction with a wide variety astrocytes, microglial cells, hepatocytes, microvascular endothelial cells, neuroblastoma cells, phagocytic leukocytes and other non-myeloid cells. in recent studies, FPR1 has been associated with anti-bacterial inflammation and metastasis of malignant glioma cells. mFpr-rs5 (mFpr-rs5) is found as a pseudogene that does not code for a functional receptor. work on mFprs has been focused mostly on the gene products of mFpr1 and mFpr2 which are widely expressed in mouse leukocytes. mFpr-rs8 (mFpr-rs2) has been characterized as a constitutively expressed gene associated with mouse longevity [31,33] the gene products of five other mFprs, including mFpr-rs1, mFpr-rs3, mFpr-rs4, and mFpr-rs7, are recently described as mouse vomeronasal sensory receptors. functional and pharmacology assays conducted in stably transfected cells suggested that mFpr-rs1 responds poorly to most agonists that activate human and murine FPR receptors. these observations add to studies using knockout animal models and together indicate that murine Fprs share numerous structural and pharmacological properties with human FPRs. eloid cells including astrocytoma cells, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, microvascular endothelial cells, neuroblastoma cells, in addition to phagocytic leukocytes. in recent studies, FPR1 has been associated with anti-bacterial inflammation and metastasis of malignant glioma cells, while FPR2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases such as systemic amyloidosis work on mFprs has been focused mostly on the gene products of mFpr1 and mFpr2 which are widely expressed in mouse phagocytic leukocytes. targeted deletion of mFpr1 or mFpr2 renders mice more susceptible to bacterial infection without changing their viability and fertility. both mFpr1/ and mFpr2/ mice respond differently from their wildtype littermates. mFpr-rs8 (mFpr-rs2) has been characterized as a constitutively expressed gene associated with mouse longevity [31,33] the gene products of five other mFprs, including mFpr-rs1, mFpr-rs3, mFpr-rs4, mFpr-rs6, and mFpr-rs7, are recently described as mouse vomeronasal sensory receptor FPRs are classified as a group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) [36,37,38]. the evolutionary correlation between them is by no means linear. peptides SAA1.1 FPR2, others [56,57] A42 DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA FPR2 [28,58] Ac2\u201326 Ac-AMVSEFLKQAWFIENEEQEYVQTVK FPR1, FPR2 [59,60] LL-37 LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES FPR2 [61 Quinazolinones Quin-C1 FPR2 [75] b. benzimidazole derivative N-substituted benzimidazole 11 FPR2 [77] d.

N-phenylure fMLF is among the first characterized and also the shortest formyl peptides with full agonistic activities. fMLF is among the first characterized and also the shortest formyl peptides with full agonistic activities. formylated peptides are the most commonly studied class of FPR agonists. they trigger a variety of biological activities in myeloid cells, such as chemokinesis, chemotaxis, calcium flux, cytokine production and superoxide anion generation. fMLF and other peptides serve as potent chemoattractants. cytolytic peptides PSM (phenol-soluble modulins) are -helical peptides composed of 20\u201325 amino acids. phenol-soluble modulins are -helical peptides composed of 20\u201325 amino acids. a prominent exception is mitocryptide-2, a neutrophil-activating formyl peptide produced from mitochondrial cytochromes. fMLF is not a potent activator for murine Fprs, including mFpr1 and mFpr2 when compared to human FPR1. mFpr1 was found more responsive to formyl peptides derived from Listeria monocytogenes (fMIVTLF), Staphylococcus aureus (fMIFL), and mitochondria (fMMYALF) two antimicrobial peptides were reported to elicit neutrophil chemotactic migration through FPR1. the host-derived non-formyl peptide agonists for FPRs are generally peptides and proteins associated with human diseases and inflammation. a prominent example of them is serum amyloid A (SAA) prion protein fragment PrP (106\u2013126) was reported to interact with FPR2 in glial cells and induce calcium mobilization, chemotaxis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. other two amyloidogenic disease-associated peptides were found to be agonists for FPR2. humanin is neuroprotective on the contrary. antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and its murine homolog CRAMP were identified as FPR2 agonists. LL-37 activates FPR2 and evokes superoxide generation in human fibroblasts. LL-37 also inhibits SAA signaling in human neutrophils. uPAR is a serine protease involved in regulation of fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, migration and tissue repair. uPAR D2D388\u2013274, a cleaved peptide corresponding to residues from 88 to 274 of uPAR, binds to and activates FPR2 in monocytes. uPAR84\u201395 activates both FPR2 and FPR3 in basophils. this study suggested that FAM3D/FPR interaction might play a role in intestinal homeostasis and gastrointestinal inflammation. the receptors also have other endogenous peptide ligands, such as cathepsin G for FPR1, chemokine CCL23 (amino acids 22\u2013137) and its N-terminal fragment SHAAGtide for FPR2, and a heme-binding protein fragment F2L for FPR3. a series of AApeptides were designed and synthesized to mimic the structure and function of the prototypic tripeptide fMLF, the reference agonist of FPR1. a tethered library was screened and a peptide with the sequence MMWLL was identified as an FPR1 agonist. this peptide becomes 1000-fold more potent when the first Met is N-formylated, consistent with the preferential recognition of fMet-containing the first reported non-peptide agonist for FPR from library screening is a quinazolinone derivative named Quin-C1 [75] it was found highly selective for FPR2 as opposed to FPR1. it stimulated calcium mobilization through FPR2 but did not induce substantial neutrophil superoxide generation, even at concentrations up to 100 M. benzimidazoles, pyrazolones, pyridazin-3(2H)-ones, chiral pyridazines, N-phenylureas, chiral 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2-[3-(4-nitrophenyl)ureido] propanamides, 2-(N-Piperazinyl)acetamide derivatives, quinazolinone more than 10 pyridazinone-based compounds have been reported to have an EC50 in the nanomolar range in functional assays. a pyrazolone derivative, designated in most publications as \u201cCompound 43\u201d, was first identified as a FPR2-specific agonist [78], but it was redefined to be a mixed FPR1/FPR2 agonist in an independent screen. derived Lipid and Lipopeptide Agonists Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) has highly potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activities based on in vivo studies. this eicosanoid was reported to directly bind to FPR2 and a variant of mouse mFpr-rs1 [34,74,149,153]. despite the high-affinity binding, LXA4 is an atypical ligand for FPR Resolvin D1, a biosynthetic product from DHA, activates FPR2 and GPR32. selective knock down or inhibition of FPR2 reduces Resolvin D1 response. oxLDL-induced foam cell formation and TNF- production could be inhibited by an FPR1 antagonist. apoA-I and apoE are described as anti-inflammatory, as they suppress chemotaxis of leukocytes in the airway. there has been an increasing interest in a group of newly emerging molecules that modulate GPCR activity by entirely novel mechanisms. these molecules comprise a lipid moiety conjugated with a peptide that is derived from a sequence of the cytoplasmic loops. the pepducins P2Y2PalIC2 and P2Y2PalIC3 contain sequences of the second and third intracellular loops of P2Y2R. a pepducin (ATI-2341) designed for CXCR4 was found to activate neutrophils with responses inhibited by FPR2 antagonists but not P2Y2R antagonist. it is also notable that pepducin derived from another intracellular loop has no effect [168]. fMLF is among the first characterized and also the shortest formyl peptides with full agonistic activities. these peptides are initiated with N-formyl methionine and are generally cleavage products of bacterial and mitochondrial proteins. fMLF and other peptides serve as potent chemoattractants. cytolytic peptides PSM (phenol-soluble modulins) are -helical peptides composed of 20\u201325 amino acids. mitocryptide-2 can directly bind to FPR2 and activate it with an EC50 of 6.9 nM in calcium flux assay, whereas it manifests no interaction with FPR1 [54] l peptides, the N-formyl group is important for optimal interaction with FPR1 and FPR2. fMLF is not a potent activator for murine Fprs, including mFpr1 and mFpr2 when compared to human FPR1. mFpr1 was found more responsive to formyl peptides derived from Listeria monocytogenes (fMIVTLF), Staphylococcus at least five peptide sequences were found more potent at FPR2 than at FPR1 and mFpr1 [101,102,103,104,105], except only one is selective for FPR1 and mFpr1 [101,102,106]. a cecropin-like peptide (Hp2-20) from Helicobacter pylori was also identified as an agonist for FPRs [55,107]. research conducted with SAA1 isoforms purified from an E. coli expression system suggests major SAA1 isoforms have cytokine-inducing activity and minor substitutions of amino acids affected their potency at FPR2. other amyloidogenic disease-associated peptides were found to be agonists for FPR2: the 42-amino acid form of A amyloid peptide (A42) and humanin. the annexin A1 peptides fully activate FPR1 like the conventional agonists that induce pro-inflammatory responses. at low concentrations they only show partial activity at FPR1 [123], leading to neutrophil desensitization and inhibiting neutrophil migration induced by other chemoattractants. uPAR is the cell surface receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) uPAR is a serine protease involved in regulation of fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, migration and tissue repair. uPAR is a cleaved peptide corresponding to residues from 88 to 274 of uPAR. in HEK293 cells transfected to express FPR1 or FPR2, FAM3D induced significant cell chemotaxis and calcium mobilization. the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling caused by FAM3D in neutrophils was blocked by an antagonist of FPR2. this study suggested that FAM3D/FPR interaction might play a role in intestinal homeostasis and gastrointestinal inflammation. peptide agonist for FPR2 is highly selective for FPR2 and weakly agonistic for FPR3. another peptide identified from library screen, MMK-1 (LESIFRSLLFRVM), is a highly selective chemotactic agonist for FPR2 [70,138]. a tethered library was screened and a peptide with the sequence MMWLL was identified as an FPR1 agonist. small molecules screened from chemical library are more stable and highly selective for certain FPR members. these properties make them valuable tools for detailed characterization of FPRs. this is important for a better understanding of the complex role of FPRs in vivo. a series of structurally divergent small-molecules with high-affinity have been identified as FPR ligands via cell-based assays for high throughput screening (HTS) around one hundred FPR agonists with high potency and clear selectivity have been identified and optimized in the reported research. phenylureido)propan-2-yl)-1-(4-phenylbutyl)urea coded as 1753-103 is also the most potent synthetic non-peptide agonist for FPR1 known to date [84] other chemical agonists with high FPR1 specificity, such as the benzimidazole derivates [145] and the pyridazinone-based compounds [146] have been described. lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is an atypical ligand for FPR2. it cannot activate proinflammatory activities such as chemotaxis, enzyme release and ROS production. it appears difficult to determine the role of LXA4 as an FPR2 agonist without establishing a standard in compound preparation. Resolvins, protectins and maresins are novel pro-resolving mediators. they are biosynthesized from omega-3 fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) these lipid mediators block neutrophil recruitment, promote monocyte activation, and enhance macrophage phagocytosis. circulating high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was reported to induce calcium flux and chemotaxis through FPR2. it is unclear whether D-37pA is an anti-inflammatory antagonist of FPR2. apoA-I itself and apoE are described as being anti-inflammatory. a shorter variant was shown to act as a partial agonist for direct activation of FPR2 but as a full agonist for cross-talk triggered hPFR2 reactivation generated by PAF receptor and ATP receptor (P2Y2R) a pepducin (ATI-2341) was found to activate neutrophils with responses inhibited by FPR2 antagonists but not P2Y2R antagonist [73,167] the presence of different forms (such as homo- or heterodimers) involved in the activation of these two major human FPRs requires verification. it also remains a question whether the pepducins mentioned above can interact with murine Fprs. these molecules inhibit cell responses induced by FPR agonists. t-butyloxycarbonyl analog of formylated peptide f-FLFLF is another antagonistic peptide that potently inhibits neutrophil NADPH-oxidase activity induced by fMLF [40,173,174]. Boc-1 and Boc-2 begin to lose their receptor preference to FPR1 at high concentrations (>5 M) and display inhibitory effects on FPR2 and even the complement component 5a (C5a)-induced responses. cyclosporin H (CsH) is one of the most potent and specific FPR1 antagonists. another cyclic undecapeptide CsA is derived from peptide metabolites of the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum [87,144,174] aminidase release assay demonstrated that cyclosporin H and its derivatives are potent FPR1 antagonists with nanomolar IC50 values. the blocking effect on FPR2 signaling is also observed with CsH at high concentrations (>2.5 M) peptide 88Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Tyr92 is actually a dual agonist for FPR1 and FPR2. the cyclized SRSRY was reported to inhibit the binding of fluorescence labeled fMLF to FPR1-expressing cells. the precise molecule responsible for the inhibitory activity has not yet been identified. a cell permeable peptide of 10 amino acids conjugated with a rhodamine group (PBP10) has potent inhibitory activity on FPR2. the peptide sequence of PBP10 is derived from PIP2-binding domains of the cytoskeletal protein gelsolin. the rhodamine group is essential for the peptide to pass through plasma membrane and exert antagonistic activity. ys-NSpe)6-NH2 belongs to a group of immunomodulatory host defense peptides. unlike most HDPs, this synthetic HDP mimic is resistant to proteolysis. both lipid and peptidomimetic portions are important for its immunomodulatory function. the first reported competitive antagonist is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Sulfinpyrazone and its derivative 1,2-diphenyl-4-(3-(1-naphthyl)-propyl)-3,5-pyrazolidinedione. however, Sulfinpyrazone is a low affinity (Ki = 14 M) and non-specific ligand at FPR1. lignin PP-6 was found to block binding of fluorescently labeled ligand fNLFNYK (Ki 10 M) and block FITC-fMLF binding to neutrophils with a Ki of 1.5 M. it is difficult to consider PP-6 a competitive antagonist for FPR1. a pyrolidine bis-diketopiperazine-based compound was recently identified as the most potent non-peptide FPR2 antagonist with a Ki of 1 nM and an IC50 of 81 nM in calcium mobilization assays. a quinazolinone derivative was previously reported to suppress FPR agonist-stimulated inflammatory responses in vitro and in an in vivo model. t-butyloxycarbonyl-MLF (t-Boc-MLF, Boc-1) binds to FPR2 with Ki values of 0.21, 1.8 and 3.2 M. the subsequent functional analysis revealed no direct agonistic effects in one of the most potent compounds. future studies of binding properties and off-target effects are needed to determine the bona fide antagonists. Boc-1 and Boc-2 may be classified as pan-antagonists for FPRs. despite their relatively specific activity at low concentrations, these Boc peptides may be classified as pan-antagonists for FPRs. cyclosporin H (CsH) is one of the most potent and specific FPR1 antagonists. cyclosporin H (CsH) is one of the most potent and specific FPR1 antagonists. cyclosporins were synthesized based on CsH and SAR analysis. the blocking effect on FPR2 signaling is also observed with CsH at high concentrations (>2.5 M) [174] another study revealed that administration of CsH reduced opioid peptide secretion and analgesia associated with neutrophil activation during mycobacteria butyricum infection. an endogenous allergen uteroglobin (UG) was previously identified as an FPR2 antagonist. an extract of secondary metabolites from a marine Bacillus sp. was also found to have FPR antagonistic properties. other endogenous non-cyclized peptides with antagonistic activity include spinorphin and sarpopeptate. rhodamine-linked decapeptide is essential for the peptide to pass through plasma membrane and exert antagonistic activity. rhodamine-linked decapeptide can completely inhibit ROS production mediated by FPR2 but not by FPR1. Pam-(Lys-NSpe)6-NH2 belongs to a group of immunomodulatory host defense peptides (HDPs) unlike most HDPs, this synthetic HDP mimic is resistant to proteolysis. both lipid and peptidomimetic portions are important for its immunomodulatory function. the first reported FPR1 competitive antagonist is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Sulfinpyrazone and its derivative 1,2-diphenyl-4-(3-(1-naphthyl)-propyl)-3,5-pyrazolidinedione. however, Sulfinpyrazone is a low affinity (Ki = 14 M) and non-specific ligand at FPR1. hederagenin SMG-1 was found to block binding of fluorescently labeled ligand fNLFNYK (Ki 10 M) it has been verified that SMG-1 has no direct agonist effects. a lignin PP-6 was found to inhibit fMLF-induced neutrophil response. the compound 1754-31 showed no agonistic activity at concentrations up to 12 M. a quinazolinone derivative was previously reported to suppress FPR agonist-stimulated inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. binding properties and off-target effects are needed to determine the bona fide antagonists among compounds that have been identified to suppress FPR agonist-stimulated cell responses in functional activity assays. a number of key residues have been identified to be crucial for the interaction between FPRs and various modulators. binding of fMLF to FPR1 disrupts electrostatic interaction between Lys85 and Asp284. lack of a \u2018salt bridge\u2019 formed by Lys/Asp in FPR2 is responsible for the low affinity binding of fMLF and most formyl peptide. the formation of \u2018salt bridge\u2019 seems still important because the D281G substitution of FPR2 failed to restore the potency of fMLF to the level in FPR1 [96] studies have also shown that longer formyl peptides with -helical and amphipathic properties favor FPR2 over FPR1. chimeric receptors were also constructed to dissect the mechanisms of action by which cell-penetrating lipopeptides (e.g., pepducins and PBP10) use unconventional access to modulate FPR2. a substitution of these amino acids from FPR1 to FPR2 did not affect the selectivity of these pepducins. the current homology models of receptors (including FPR1 and FPR2) are generally created by using the crystal structures of two classes of receptors. the bovine rhodopsin receptor has a relatively low sequence identity to FPRs (20%) and was selected as a template because of its higher resolution (2.2) a rhodopsin-based homology model of FPR1 suggested an important role of water molecule in discrimination between FPR1 agonists and antagonists. the proposed model comprises three sub-pockets, the pharmacophore sub-pocket I (within the small cavity) surrounded by positive residues, and the hydrophobic sub-pockets II and III (within the large cavity) surrounded by polar residues. u109, and Trp254 were identified as critical for agonist binding. the model proposed that three hydrophobic clusters are important in binding non-peptide ligands. the first cluster is formed by TM2 and TM3 while His102 is crucial in the interaction with docked ligands. uous residues include Arg84, Lys85, Arg163, Arg205, and Asp284 in FPR1 (Figure 1). it is suggested that binding of fMLF to FPR1 disrupts the electrostatic interaction between Lys85 and Asp284, which might contribute to the receptor activation [212,214,215] another charged residue in FPR2 (Gly280 in FPR1) was found to be crucial for the interaction of FPR2 with certain formyl peptides that contain a positively charged C-terminal residue. the formation of \u2018salt bridge\u2019 seems still important because the D281G substitution of FPR2 alone failed to restore the potency of fMLF to the level in FPR1 [96] chimeric receptors were also constructed to dissect the mechanisms of action by which cell-penetrating lipopeptides (e.g., pepducins and PBP10) use unconventional access to modulate FPR2. a substitution of these amino acids from FPR1 to FPR2 did not affect the selectivity of these pepducins. the current homology models of FPR receptors are generally created by using the crystal structures of two classes of receptors. the bovine rhodopsin receptor has a relatively low sequence identity to FPRs (20%) and was selected as a template because of its higher resolution (2.2) a pharmacophore model based on best docking poses of four FPR1 antagonists including CsH described three anchor points: two acceptors for H-bonding and one hydrophobic point. the three-point model was further proved to be fitted by FPR1 antagonists but also by FPR1 agonists. the peptide agonist WKYMVM fits well with this model by occupying all three sub-pockets. residues His102, Val105, Asp106, Leu109, and Trp254 were identified as critical for binding non-peptide ligands, including agonists and antagonists. the FPRs are highly \u2018promiscuous\u2019 in terms of ligand recognition. how FPRs recognize these different ligands remains unclear at present without available crystal structures. molecular docking and computer simulation approaches combined with site-directed mutagenesis have provided clues to our understanding of how formyl peptides interact with FPR1."}
