{"summary": "pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) induce innate immune responses. innate response against infection with intracellular pathogens includes synthesis of type I IFNs (IFN-I) listeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen which replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. a strain of L. monocytogenes modifies its PGN, with fifty per cent of the muropeptide composition being N-deacetylated [25]. a strain of L. monocytogenes mutated in its ability to alter its PGN, pgdA, is sensitive to lysozyme and induces immunostimulants. the aim of the present study was to decipher the signaling pathways involved in this response to pgdA infection. we reveal that IFN- production in peritoneal macrophages requires TLR2 signaling and the TRIF adapter protein. we complemented our original pgdA mutant with the wild-type gene. data are mean SD (***, p0.0001, n = 5). IFN- mRNA synthesis induced by L. monocytogenes infection of PEM required TLR2. TLR2-deficient BMM showed no impairment in their synthesis of IFN- mRNA. IFN- induction does not require Mal/TIRAP but depends on TRIF. TRIF is necessary for IFN- response to Listeria in peritoneal macrophages. the adapter TRIF is employed by TLRs 3 and 4 to signal through the TBK1-IRF3/7-IFN- pathway. there is no previous evidence of an association or functional interaction between TRIF and TLR2. there is no previous evidence of an association or functional interaction between TRIF and TLR2. compared induction of IFN- in wild-type and tlr3/ PEM infected with EGDe or pgdA strains. compared induction of IFN- in wild-type and tlr4/ PEM infected with pgdA strains. levels were measured in supernatants by ELISA. data are mean SD (***, p0.0001; n = 3). IFN- is induced by intracellular bacteria Induction of IFN- via TLR2 is no longer an exception. PEM from WT C57BL/6J mice were treated with 80 M dynasore. after 4 h of infection, IFN- induction was measured by qRT-PCR. response to Listeria is mediated by IRF3 and IRF7 in peritoneal macrophages. mRNA was isolated and the IFN- induction was measured by qRT-PCR. the comparison between EGDe and pgdA strains showed that both caused similar magnitudes of IB mRNA synthesis. this suggests that the increased IFN- production after infection with pgdA relies on activation of other transcription factors. inactivation of PgdA increases Listeria sensitivity to peptidoglycan-targeting antimicrobials such as lysozyme. pgdA released significantly higher amounts of DNA and RNA than wild-type and complemented pgdA strains. we thus measured IFN- induction in THP1 macrophages transfected with Listeria DNA. PEM were transfected with bacterial lysates, pretreated with DNase or not treated. IFN- is highly expressed in response to infection with Listeria pgdA mutant in a TLR2-dependent manner A L. monocytogenes pgdA mutant induced a much higher IFN- response. after 7 h of infection, IFN- levels were measured in supernatants by ELISA. data are mean SD (***, p0.0001, n = 5) IFN- levels were measured in supernatants by ELISA. data are mean SD (**, p0.01, n = 5). IFN- induction does not require Mal/TIRAP but depends on TRIF. the adapter TRIF is employed by TLRs 3 and 4 to signal through the TBK1-IRF3/7-IFN- pathway. there is no previous evidence of an association or functional interaction between TRIF and TLR2. however, the link between TRIF and the IRF pathway on the one hand suggested the possibility of a role for TRIF. LR2 and TRIF by the resident macrophage population determine the difference in signaling to the IFN- gene between BMM and PEM. we compared induction of IFN- in wild-type and tlr3/ PEM infected with EGDe or pgdA strains. IFN- is induced by intracellular bacteria Induction of IFN- via TLR2 is no longer an exception. it has been shown that vaccinia virus-induced IFN- production was dependent on TLR2 signaling. in both cases, IFN- induction was strongly reduced. 7 h post-infection, IFN- concentrations were measured in cells supernatants by ELISA. PEM from WT C57BL/6J mice were treated with 100 M chloroquine. data are mean SD (***, p0.0001, n = 3\u20134) IFN- response to Listeria is mediated by IRF3 and IRF7 in peritoneal macrophages. PEM from irf3 / and irf7 / mice were infected with the parental EGDe strain. macrophages with EGDe or pgdA showed that both TLR2 and adaptor were required for full induction of IB mRNA in response to EGDe and pgdA strains. these results suggest that both caused similar magnitudes of IB synthesis. the activation of NFB by Listeria is independent of PgdA. inactivation of PgdA increases Listeria sensitivity to antimicrobials such as lysozyme. pgdA released significantly higher amounts of DNA and RNA than wild-type. we thus measured IFN- induction in THP1 macrophages transfected with Listeria DNA, either undigested or treated with DNase. parental EGDe strain (black bars) or the pgdA mutant (grey bars) were incubated with lysozyme. PEM were transfected with bacterial lysates, pretreated with DNase or not. IFN- production was quantified in cells supernatants 24 h. in support of an unconventional role for TLR2, recent studies reported roles for TLR2-dependent induction of IFN- in response to vaccinia virus or synthetic ligands [26], [29]. in support of an unconventional role for TLR2, recent studies reported roles for TLR2-dependent induction of IFN- in response to vaccinia virus or vaccinia virus. TRIF is an adapter known to trigger the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs upon engagement of TLR3 and TLR4. this was ruled out by showing that Listeria-infected tlr4/ PEM produced a similar amount of IFN- as their wild counterparts. nucleus of NF-B, IRF3, IRF7 and/or activator protein-1 collaborate to induce transcription of type I IFNs [37]. inactivation of IRF3 totally abrogated this response to both strains while IFN- induction was significantly but not totally impaired in IRF7-deficient macrophages. this macrophage population employs cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing similar to macrophages or macrophage lines derived from different anatomical locations. other bacterial components could participate in IFN- production upon infection with the pgdA mutant. genes EGDe (BUG1600, ATCC BAA-679), L. monocytogenes pgdA (BUG2288, [25]) and L. monocytogenes pgdA complemented strain (BUG2382) were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI, Oxoid), aerobically at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm. experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Institut Pasteur (permit #03-49) the percentage of macrophages was determined by flow cytometry using CD11b (1100, eBiosciences) and F4/80 (1100, eBiosciences) antibodies. cells were seeded onto 6-well plates (Nunc) at a concentration of 2106 cells per well. cells were seeded onto 6-well plates at a concentration of 2106 cells per well. cells were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. macrophages were seeded at a concentration of 5.6104 cells per well onto a 96-well plate. monolayers were washed twice followed by incubation in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
