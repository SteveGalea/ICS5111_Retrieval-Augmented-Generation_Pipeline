{"summary": "influenza virus (family Orthomyxoviridae) contains a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome divided into eight segments. the eight gene segments are: polymerase basic 2 (PB2), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), and nonstructural protein (NS) (1). the only example of dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) study with influenza viruses is from murine lungs infected with two avian viruses, H5N1 and H5N8 (21). there are no dual RNA-seq studies that have simultaneously characterized the transcriptome of human epithelial cells and the genome and transcriptome of clinically relevant IAV strains. a well-characterized example of AS of host genes during viral infection is the herpes simplex virus 1-induced AS of MX1, whose gene product favors virus replication (26). however, whether IAV modulates AS of human host genes encoding immune response and/or key biological functions is not known. strand-specific dual RNA-seq and IAV/H3N2 genomics. RNA samples were subjected to a strand-specific RNA-seq assay. total RNA-seq read counts were mapped by sample (x axis) curves of the three viruses were confirmed by virus titration in beAS-2B cells. UD/72 6-hpi samples cluster with BR10/07 and PER16/09 24-hpi samples. vRNAs PB2, PB1, PA, and M of UD/72 were upregulated from 6 to 24 hpi. the valley between these \u201cedges\u201d corresponds to genomic deletions consistent with reads mapping to vRNAs that are commonly associated with DI RNAs (32). DI RNAs were reported mostly during in vitro infection at a high multiplicity of infection (33), but were also described in clinical specimens following infection with the pandemic strain A/California07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) (34). deletions of the polymerase gene segments of PER16/09 are mapped on the negative-strand RNA. RNA polarity is color-coded (pink, negative-strand RNA; blue, positive-strand RNA). spliced isoform of the NS mRNA segment was confirmed as a positive control. sashimi plots (99, 100) of RNA-seq reads from 6- and 24-hpi samples were aligned to the NA segment of BR10/07 (blue), PER16/09 (red), or UD/72 (green). a schematic representation of the full-length NA transcript is presented. predicted NA spliced transcripts were validated by reverse transcription-PCR. cloning and Sanger sequencing were used to validate the splice junctions. amplicons generated from the cDNA of UD/72 showed a different pattern compared to those amplified from BR10/07 and PER16/09. donor and acceptor sites follow the canonical GT-AG rule in UD/72. the same splice donor site in BR10/07 and PER16/09 is AT instead of GT. splicing prediction scores of all 5\u2032ss observed in different strains are consistent with our observed strain-specific transcript variants. Isoforms NA2 and NA4-7 are each estimated to be expressed at levels ranging from 0.3 to 0.7% at 6 and 24 hpi in UD/72 infected cells. these levels are comparable to the expression level of M2 (0.4 to 0.6%) and slightly lower than NS2 (2.1 to 5.1%) in UD/72 at the same time points. 0.00 0.54 0.75 NA3 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 6.24 9.84 11.18 NA4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 0.00 0.54 0.63 NA6 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 0.01 0.55 0.70 NA7 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 0.00 0.28 0.30 NA8 0.00 0.51 1.74 0.00 0.65 1.59 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 M M1 99.80 98.92 99.15 98 we identified a single hit for NA8 in influenza A/Myanmar/13M035/2013. this strain has a 5\u2032ss and 3\u2032ss identical to PER16/09 and BR10/07. the low number of hits in SRA data sets is likely due to library preparation optimized for amplification of genomic RNA rather than mRNA. s residues between 127 and 319 of native NA produce the peptide EPYVSCDPDK in native NA and the unique peptide EPYVSCDPGLVGDTPR in NA5. s residues between 127 and 319 of native NA therefore tryptic cleavage of the bond C-terminal to R118 and N-terminal to K128 produces the peptide EPYVSCDPDK in native NA. the predicted NA8-specific peptide LHQSVLLCGVDK was detected at m/z 456.92 (z = 3) where cysteine is carbamidomethylated (+57 Da) the amount of NA8 in 1 g of supernatant is estimated at 170 and 20 amol, respectively, for both PER/16/09 and BR10/07 strains. NA of UD/72 or PER16/09 is likely to form multimers with themselves. both interfaces are fully formed and identical to other N2 structures. the enzyme active site in each is unchanged relative to other N2 structures. thelial cells to UD/72 infection have been reported (18) we first identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in beAS-2B cells infected with seasonal or laboratory strains compared to time-matched, mock-infected cells. we detected a total of 81, 372, and 1,614 DEGs at 1, 6, and 24 hpi. 119 DEGs were upregulated in response to each of the three IAV/H3N2 at 1, 6, or 24 h. UD/72 predominantly induced expression of a large set of proinflammatory genes that were either not induced. seasonal strains showed similar patterns of DEGs and similar induction of key transcription factors (TF) that either form an ISGF3 complex (STAT1 and IRF9) or are induced by ISGF3 (IRF7). a common set of genes was induced earlier and to higher levels in response to PER16/09 than to BR10/07 infection. the presence of TF binding sites contributes to the transcriptional regulation of virally induced genes. we first evaluated the enrichment of nonredundant TRANSFAC motifs. each represents a family of one or more related TF binding motifs. at 6 hpi in BR10/07 samples, no significant IRF motifs were predicted in promoters of upregulated DEGs. at 24 hpi, enrichment of binding motifs for RelA and SRF was found in promoters of upregulated DEGs after infection with PER16/09 and UD/72. size across samples is approximately 110 bp and many library fragments below 100 bp are retained. snoRNAs are classified into three groups: SNORDs, possessing the C/D box and directing the 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation of rRNAs; and SCARNAs, forming a complex with small nuclear proteins (SNURPs) UD/72 infection shows the greatest ability to modulate snoRNA expression. five of the six H/ACA box snoRNAs that share the same host gene TAF(I) are upregulated. snoRNAs with reported noncanonical functions (56) were upregulated by UD/72. we detected 775 genes showing AS in at least one infected sample. pathways and gene ontologies enriched in each data set include RNA binding, nonsense-mediated decay, cell cycle process, influenza life cycle. many of the genes involved in these pathways/functions are ribosomal protein genes. BR10/07 and PER16/09 differentially regulate 5\u2032 AS of IFI35. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is critical to antiviral defense. TBK1 is also known to have an AS variant in which exons 3 to 6 of the 21 exons are skipped (64) the two seasonal viruses BR10/07 and PER16/09 induced AS of IFI35 at 24 hpi. this event generates an in-frame deletion of six bases that encode amino acids 126 to 127 (Val-Met) in the NMI domain that mediates interaction with IFI35. strand-specific RNA-seq assay maintains the polarity of host and virus RNA. total RNA-seq read counts were mapped by sample (x axis) and read fraction distribution (y axis) strand-specific RNA-seq assay maintains the polarity of host and virus RNA. vRNA versus cRNA/mRNA from each gene segment was tracked by normalization of read coverage by viral gene segment to total host reads. vRNAs of the two seasonal strains were relatively constant between 6 and 24 hpi. vRNAs PB2, PB1, PA, and M of UD/72 were upregulated from 6 to 24 hpi. at the latter point primary transcription is expected to be complete. the fraction of DI-like RNA to vRNA seems to be important for the outcome of an infection. we measured this fraction and found it to be noticeably higher for all three viral polymerase segments of PER16/09 than either BR10/07 or UD/72. each viral stock had a similar HA titer, but infectivity varied modestly (30-fold), with PER16/09 virus having the lowest infectivity titer. y and x axes and the abundance of the deletion are expressed by the sizes of the circle (B, D, and F) per centage of DI-like genomic (negative-strand) reads as a fraction of total genomic (negative-strand) reads of PA (red), PB1 (green), and PB2 (blue) during infection of each IAV/H3N2 (x axis) virus. spliced transcripts of NA (blue lines/bars) and one positive-strand deletion (NAdel) are shown. a schematic representation of the full-length NA transcript is presented. primers NAFw1 and NARv1272 were used to detect all predicted RNA isoforms. cDNA fragments corresponding to the NA species expressed by each virus are reported. five clones (2.5%) represent NA2, 76 (38%) represent NA3, and the numbers of clones representing NA4, NA5, and NA6 were 6 (3%), 4 (2%) and 2 (1%), respectively. splicing prediction scores of all 5\u2032ss observed in different strains are consistent with our observed strain-specific transcript variants. the more commonly used 3\u2032ss at position 972 has a higher score than the 3\u2032ss at position 958. we identified a prominent positive-strand deletion near the N terminus in PER16/09. this is not likely a result of alternative splicing. NA3 expression is higher than NA2 and NA4-7, comprising 9.8 and 11.2% at 6 and 24 hpi. cRNA cannot be separated from mRNA in our RNA-seq data. fractional values for spliced isoforms may be lower than actual values. 69 99.37 99.57 M2 0.20 1.08 0.85 1.45 1.93 0.89 3.31 0.63 0.43 NS NS1 97.71 99.02 98.52 99.17 99.41 99.29 99.00 97.92 94.88 NS2 2.29 0.98 1.48 0.83 0.59 0.71 1.00 2.08 5.12. splice donor/acceptor sequence combination suggests that the NA8 spliced isoform might be produced in other N2 strains as well. this isoform is likely specific to the N2 subtype since neither the 5\u2032ss nor the 3\u2032ss is conserved in 7825 unique NA sequences from non-N2 strains. only 7 of the 7,825 sequences have a maximum entropy > 5. mass spectrometry detection of NA5 and NA8 isoforms. representative LC-MS/MS fragment spectra of NA8-specific peptide identified in trypsin-digested supernatants from UD/72-infected BEAS-2B cells. annotation was carried out using PLGS software (Waters) the amount of NA8 in 1 g of supernatant is estimated at 170 and 20 amol, respectively, for PER16/09 and BR10/07. the NA proteins are about nine times more abundant in PER/16/09 strain than in BR10/07 (data not shown). deeper sequencing or antibody-based methods could potentially confirm protein expression or a lack of expression of these remaining isoforms. NA8 is not likely to form a tetramer as one interface is incomplete. the absence of part of the protein likely alters the configuration of this region. a portion of the active site is missing (the 430 loop and the 405 region) UD/72-specific DEGs accounted for 42, 58, and 72% of all DEGs identified at 1, 6, and 24 hpi. of the 804 innate immunity genes, 119 were either up- or downregulated during infection, while 685 were not differentially expressed. twenty-two DEGs were upregulated by all three viruses. a common set of genes was induced earlier and to higher levels. only BR10/07 did not significantly induce expression of IRF1. UD/72 induced a high expression of IFNB1/proinflammatory genes. only UD/72 showed early expression of TF components of the IFNB1 enhanceosome (JUNB and ATF3) or a gene whose product induces NFKBIZ. IPA revealed six canonical pathways shared by the three H3N2 viruses at 6 and 24 hpi. IRF was the most highly enriched motif, demonstrating up to 115-fold enrichment above unchanged promoters. promoter regions of ISGs are known to contain multiple ISREs and/or a combination of motifs. the response to UD/72 infection was relatively modest at 6 hpi. enrichment of binding motifs for RelA and SRF was found in promoters of upregulated DEGs after infection with PER16/09 and UD/72. IFNB1 also has a binding motif for RelA in its promoter. snoRNAs are classified into three groups: SNORDs, possessing the C/D box and directing the 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation of rRNAs; and SNORAs, containing the H/ACA box and guiding synthesis of ribosomal pseudouridines. results for up- and downregulated DEGs (yellow and blue, respectively) in UD/72-infected cells (A) or in UD/ a small subset of RNA-based innate immunity genes show similar patterns of expression in PER16/09 as in UD/72. at 24 hpi, PER16/09 or UD/72 infection were associated with a 2-fold increase of EIF2AK2. one target, HCFC1, is downregulated in PER16/09 or UD/72 infection with respect to mock-infected samples. RPLP1, RPL4, RPL31, RPS2, NUP155, RPL13A, GRSF1 and RP24 are examples of AS events differentially induced by seasonal and laboratory strains. TBK1 is also known to have an AS variant in which exons 3 to 6 of the 21 exons are skipped. the predicted TBK1 variant induced by UD/72 infection at 24 hpi was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) at 1 hpi, BR10/07 induced an intron retention event of DDIT3 with inclusion of an additional 23 amino acids at the N terminus. RNA-seq has been used to dissect key regulatory events at the mRNA level. we used a strand-specific dual RNA-seq strategy to characterize novel elements of interactions between the BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cell line and three strains of IAV/H3N2: two seasonal strains and the laboratory strain UD/72. the presence of a TF binding site does not necessarily imply a direct effect on expression of the gene. at 24 hpi an enrichment for the RelA motif occurs in the promoter regions of many DEGs upregulated uniquely by UD/72. human HEK293T cells infected with chikungunya virus upregulate a group of snoRNAs overlapping with annotated snoRNAs. UD/72 upregulates other SNHGs associated with cellular processes that may work together with the translational repression process. subcellular localization of viral components plays an important role in influenza infection. the NS1 protein of IAV/H3N2 strains isolated from 1950 to 1987 carries a string of residues at the C terminus (K219, R220, R224, and K229) that targets the nucleolus by binding to nucleolar proteins such as fibrillarin and nucleolin (75, 76). RNA-seq retains the polarity of host and virus RNAs. three elements of host-virus interactions differ during infection of BEAS-2B cells with seasonal IAV and UD/72. DI RNAs (33) serve as PAMPs to drive RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated expression of IFN (79) AS may control levels of the gene product by maintaining levels of mRNA that produce functional proteins in equilibrium with mRNA that generate nonfunctional products. TBK1 participates in the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including IFN (with substrates IRF3 and -7) and NF-B (82). UD/72 AS events predict the generation of several frameshift products and one novel in-frame product. the first model proposes that two or more 5\u2032ss that share the same 3\u2032ss cause stuttering of the viral polymerase. the common 3\u2032ss suggests its importance in the splicing event. this is consistent with multiple predicted AS isoforms of UD/72. mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of NA5 in UD/72 supernatants and NA8 in supernatant from both seasonal strains. it is also possible that the NA8 isoform is expressed in other IAV/N2 strains. stocks were amplified in the allantoic cavity of 9- to 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. beAS-2B and MDCK cells were each plated (0.5 106/12-well plate), incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), followed by DNase treatment. rRNA was first removed by two rounds of selection using a Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit. 14 cycles of PCR were performed using the Illumina Truseq strand-specific library preparation kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) reads mapping to chrUn_gl000220 were removed as rRNA. we measured differential gene expression using DefinedRegionDifferentialSeq (USeq 8.7.6). gene ontology: Biological Process, and REACTOME [94] pathways were grouped and displayed as an Enrichment Map v.3.5.1 network in Cytoscape v.3.5.1 (96) with an overlap fraction of 0.37. reads mapped to influenza genomes were converted to fastq. each virus using SeqMan (Lasergene) was mapped to a consensus of the viral genomes. splice junctions with a strong bias to the positive strand (i.e., mRNA strand) were selected for further investigation. DI-like reads were calculated by subtracting reads for full-length genomic RNA from the total number of reads. the maximum entropy splicing prediction scores (104) were determined using the MaxEntScan server. SRABlast was performed using 30bp query sequences corresponding to 15bp of the upstream exon and 15bp of the downstream exon of all NA isoforms. all unique influenza A H2 sequences found in human host (7,446 total) were aligned using tools available at the Influenza Research Database. mRNAs located within the first 200 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end or the 3\u2032 end of NA were not different in molecular mass from the unspliced mRNA. primers either upstream or downstream of the splice site were designed to amplify a smaller fragment containing the splice sites. PCRs of the GAPDH and NS1 genes were carried out at 55\u00b0C as an annealing step. cloned sequences were aligned to predicted sequences. aliquot was taken in low-bind Eppendorf tubes and digested overnight. the digestion was stopped by adding 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2. the eluate was sprayed via a PicoTip Emitter (New Objectives) into synaptG2 MS. a targeted MSMS (tMS2) acquisition method was used to detect the predicted NA8-specific peptide LHQSVLLCGVDK at m/z 456.92 (z = 3) where cysteine is carbamidomethylated (+57 Da) a total of 50 fmol of the synthetic analog of LHQSVLLCGVDK with carbamidomethylated cysteine and heavy isotope-labeled lysine was spiked in the t the top-scoring models were taken and superimposed onto a crystal structure of the H2N2 neuraminidase tetramer (PDB 3TIA) the top-scoring models were taken and superimposed onto a crystal structure of the H2N2 neuraminidase tetramer. motifs used for TF binding motif enrichment for IRF, ISRE, IRF1, IRF2, and IRF7 had the internal motif codes IRF_Q6_01, ISRE_01, IRF1_Q6_01, IRF2_01, IRF3_Q3 and IRF7_01. real-time PCR for host AS events. three primers were designed, and two reactions were carried out. one reaction detects the unspliced form using a primer pair, including forward (fw) and reverse (rv), located in the skipped exon to detect the full-length transcript. a second reaction detects the spliced variant using the third primer. splice isoforms were expressed as a ratio of one splice isoform to another. for TBK1, we used the variable exon inclusion/variable exon skipping ratio. for DDIT3, we used the variable intron retained (unspliced)/variable spliced ratio. cells were cryopreserved in BEGM supplemented with 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 7.5% dimethyl sulfoxide. stocks were used within five passages. cells were grown in tissue culture plates coated at 37\u00b0C. infection of beAS-2B and MDCK cells was performed at an MOI of 1 at 37\u00b0C. after 1 h of incubation, the inoculum was replaced with fresh media containing TPCK. total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), followed by DNase treatment. rRNA reads mapping to chrUn_gl000220 were removed as rRNA. we measured differential gene expression using DefinedRegionDifferentialSeq. events annotated to more than three genes were removed. pathway and gene ontology enrichment was performed using toppGene (93) with an FDR of 0.05. viral genomes were assembled separately using 1 hpi reads initially (with -K 41) and using reads from 6 hpi and 24 hpi (assembled with values ranging from 13 to 49 for -K) a consensus sequence was determined for each virus using SeqMan (Lasergene) positive-strand BAM files were analyzed in Cufflinks (v2.1.1) (101) with the parameters \"-G transcripts> -b respective assembled viral genome> -u \u2013library-type fr-firststrand -m 125 -s 50 -N \u2013max-bundle-frags 1000000000000 \u2013min-isoform-fraction 0 \u2013pre-mrna-fraction 0 \u2013overhang-tolerance 0.\" reads were converted SRABlast was performed using 30bp query sequences corresponding to 15bp of the upstream exon and 15bp of the downstream exon of all NA isoforms. all unique influenza A H2 sequences found in human host (7,446 total) were aligned using tools available at the Influenza Research Database. primer pair of NAFw26 (5\u2032-GCAGGAGTRAAGATGAATGAATCCAAATC-3\u2032) and NARv1272 (5\u2032-CCTTATCAACTCCACATAAAAGCACC-3\u2032) were used to amplify a smaller fragment containing the splice sites. primers upstream or downstream of the splice site were designed to amplify a smaller fragment containing the splice sites. v217, 5\u2032-CTTTTCTACAATTTGCTTTCC-3\u2032; NS2_BR10/07_PER16/09_Rv656, 5\u2032-GTGGAGGTCTCCCATTCTCA-3\u2032. PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 90 s, 60\u00b0C for 60 s, and 68\u00b0C for 30 s. an aliquot was taken in low-bind Eppendorf tubes and digested overnight using sequencing-grade trypsin. digestion was stopped by adding 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2. a targeted MSMS acquisition method was used to detect the predicted NA8-specific peptide LHQSVLLCGVDK at m/z 456.92 (z = 3) where cysteine is carbamidomethylated (+57 Da) a total of 50 fmol of the synthetic analog of LHQSVLLCGVDK with carbamidomethylated cysteine was spiked in the tMS2 run (m/z = 459.58) the resulting LC-MS raw data were searched against Swiss-Prot Human protein database plus NA sequences using Sequest algorithm on Proteome Discoverer 1.4 platform. Skyline 3.7 (developed by the University of Washington) was used to extract fragment ion chromatograms and peak areas. we used a matched promoters FDR 0.05 and a ratio of sites/Kb in DEGs to sites/kb in NC of >2 as a threshold for significance. motifs used for TF binding motif enrichment for IRF, ISRE, IRF1, IRF2, and IRF7 had the internal motif codes IRF_Q6_01, ISRE_01, IRF1_Q6_01, IRF2_01, IRF3_Q3 and each cycle consisted of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15s, annealing at 58.0\u00b0C for 5 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 s respectively. one reaction detects the unspliced variant using a primer pair, including forward (fw) and reverse (rv), located in the skipped exon to detect the full-length transcript. for TBK1, the exon inclusion was detected using the primers TBK1-Fw-ex1-4 (5 primers were IFI35 Fw-donor splice1 (5\u2032-ATCCAGATGTCCAGCCAGT-3\u2032), IFI35 Rv-donor splice2 (5\u2032-TGATGATGTCCAGTTG-3\u2032) for TBK1, we used the variable exon inclusion/variable exon skipping ratio. for DDIT3, we used the variable intron retained (unspliced)/variable spliced ratio. and submitted to GenBank as KJ609203 to KJ609218 and KM879361."}
