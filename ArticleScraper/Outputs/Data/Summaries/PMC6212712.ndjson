{"summary": "study aimed to identify clinical characteristics, etiology, and laboratory findings in childhood Bell\u2019s palsy. study aimed to identify clinical characteristics, etiology, and laboratory findings in childhood Bell\u2019s palsy. acute peripheral facial palsy may be caused by infections, congenital disorders, systemic disorders, trauma, metabolic disorders, or neoplasms. in most cases of acute onset Bell\u2019s palsy in children, there is no known cause for the idiopathic peripheral facial palsy. idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy was diagnosed for at least 1 month. a follow-up period lasting for at least 1 month was followed up for at least 1 month. no evidence of systemic diseases, (4) no previous history of facial palsy, and (5) no previous treatment with corticosteroid. the requirement for informed patient consent was waived. the requirement for informed consent was waived by the IRB. steroid treatment was initiated if there was anxiety about prognosis. onset age, sex, infection and vaccination history, laterality, severity of facial palsy, laboratory findings, magnetic resonance imaging findings, treatments, and outcomes. the mean age at onset was 7.45.62 years (standard deviation), ranging from 2 months to 19 years. the mean age at diagnosis was 7.45.62 years (standard deviation), ranging from 2 months to 19 years. a respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction test was performed in 22 patients (22%). 6 patients were infected with rhinovirus, 1 patient with adenovirus, and 1 patient with coronavirus. no fever or other symptoms were observed after vaccination in these patients. only one patient showed clinical sign of pleocytosis, such as headache, and received mannitol treatment (1 g/kg/day) under the diagnosis of viral meningitis. there was no significant difference in severity at onset between the groups. brain MRI was performed in 91 patients (91%) with Bell\u2019s palsy. twenty-nine patients showed abnormal MRI findings, that is, thickening and/or enhancement of the facial nerve. the average interval from the first symptom to the hospital visit was 2.5 days in group 1 and 2.6 days in group 2 (P=0.69) there was no significant difference in age and severity between the groups at the time of diagnosis. 139 patients were diagnosed with facial palsy, but 23 were excluded due to symptoms caused by congenital diseases, trauma, or acute otitis media. the mean age at onset was 7.45.62 years (standard deviation), ranging from 2 months to 19 years. 100 patients were excluded due to follow-up loss. a respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction test were performed in 22 patients (22%). 6 patients were infected with rhinovirus, 1 with adenovirus, and 1 with coronavirus. 5 of the patients under 1 year of age had received vaccinations, such as influenza or DTaP-IPV vaccine within 4 weeks before palsy onset. itis, such as headache, and received mannitol treatment (1 g/kg/day) under the diagnosis of viral meningitis. there was no significant difference in the severity at onset between groups 1 and 2. brain MRI was performed in 91 patients (91%) with Bell\u2019s palsy. twenty-nine patients (31%) showed abnormal MRI findings. there was no significant difference in sex, site of palsy, severity, and duration of follow-up between these 2 groups. the average interval from the first symptom to the hospital visit was 2.5 days in group 1 and 2.6 days in group 2 (P=0.69) 78 patients (93.2%) had a good outcome, 4 patients (5.5%) remained with grade II or III, and 1 patient (1%) maintained the grade V status. in children, differential diagnosis of facial palsy includes congenital causes and acquired causes, such as trauma, infection, and neoplasm [7,8]. in previous studies, there is no evidence of an increased risk of Bell's palsy following immunization with any vaccine [9]. in our study, we could not describe the causal relationship between vaccination and Bell's palsy. a large, randomized controlled trial conducted for verifying the efficacy of steroid treatment for Bell\u2019 palsy in adults showed a generally favorable outcome in patients receiving double placebo. 64.7% of patients showing full recovery at 3 months and 85.2% at 9 months. the treatment of Bell\u2019s palsy in children remains controversial. seventy-three patients (73%) were treated with oral prednisolone. good outcomes were confirmed in 68 of these patients. there was no significant difference in the recovery rate between the steroid-treated group and nontreated group (P=0.48)"}
