{"summary": "the HCV replication cycle is initiated by virions entering the host cell via interaction with cell surface receptors. the resulting polyprotein undergoes proteolytic cleavage into structural (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins. HTAs inhibit host factors that are essential in the viral replication cycle. there is a higher genetic barrier to develop resistance to HTAs. however, few HTA candidates are in the anti-HCV drug discovery pipeline. a study aims to optimize CCZ (Rac-2) for an anti-HCV application. the lead compounds in this series exhibited increased anti-HCV activity and selectivity. the optimized lead compounds merit further preclinical development. deuterated derivatives (R)-20 and (S)-20 were synthesized from (R)-1 and (S)-1 with CD3I in the presence of aqueous NaOH. trifluorinated derivatives (R)-21 and (S)-21 were prepared from the common chiral starting material. piperazine derivative 29 was further alkylated, following a modified literature procedure, to produce the diehtylene glycol-containing compound 34,32. compounds 38 and 39 were prepared according to Scheme 2B, via reductive amination of acetaldehyde with the corresponding piperazines 36 and 37 in presence of NaBH3CN and acetic acid in methanol. a EC50 SEM (n 3) is from the HCV-Luc infection assay. CC50 SEM (n 3) is from the ATPlite cytotoxicity assay. a EC50 SEM (n 3) is from the ATPlite cytotoxicity assay. all compounds were tested at 10 M, except that compounds (S)-1, Rac-23, and Rac-29 were tested at 3.2, 3.2, and 1 M, respectively, to avoid potential cytotoxicity. the numeric value corresponds to the percentage of activation induced by histamine (250 nM) in presence of 10 nM of compound. compound 16 having a cyclopentyl ring showed improved activity (EC50 = 19 nM), while compound 17 having a cyclohexyl ring showed an activity in the expected range (EC50 = 177 nM) acetylation of the piperazine ring dramatically reduced the potency of analogue 19 to a double-digit micromolar value. solubility, total polar surface area, and number of free rotatable bonds could lead to longer pharmacokinetic half-lives. by using ethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol as linker, we explore the effect of introducing a series of functional groups at the terminal position. a 6-fold increased activity and retained selectivity were observed with compound Rac-23 (EC50 values below 8 nM) a EC50 SEM (n 3) is from the ATPlite cytotoxicity assay; CC50 SEM (n 3) is from the ATPlite cytotoxicity assay; selectivity index = CC50/ EC50. the replacement of the piperazine ring with other ring structures led to a dramatic loss of activity. CCZ (Rac-2) and (S)-1 were the positive and negative controls. lead compounds with R3 = H (compounds (S)-1 and 29) showed very low H1HR inhibition. CCZ (Rac-2) and (S)-1 were the positive and negative controls. a vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudoparticle (VSV-Gpp) and a murine leukemia virus pseudoparticle (MLVpp) were tested as the control, in which no inhibitory effect was detected. a compound could be targeting an entry step that is not otherwise captured by the HCVpp system. the alanine transaminase levels27 in the mouse serum were measured. the ALT levels were around or below 80 U/L at most time points. the ALT level was elevated at multiple time points with the treatment of the vehicle only. values in the DENV-RVPs assay were approximately 1000-fold more than their EC50 values against HCV-Luc infection. the selective indices were below 5 for both compounds against the dengue virus. activity of (S)-10 was submitted for evaluation in the NIAID antiviral screen against 13 types of viruses. chirality, side chains off the piperazine ring, substituents on the phenyl rings, and modifications on the piperazine core. most of the structure modifications in the piperazine core were not tolerated, suggesting that its geometry and its pKa value were important for the anti-HCV activity of the series. lead compounds in Table 4 showed excellent antiviral activity and selectivity in host cells. compounds 29, 30, and 34 with t1/2 > 30 min in human microsomes, compound 30 was selected for in vivo pharmacokinetic mouse studies because of its lower in vitro cytotoxicity. compound 30 showed improved PK properties in comparison with that of (S)-CCZ ((S)-2), namely, a longer half-life while retaining a high liver/plasma ratio. thylamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) the column used was a Phenomenex Luna C18 (5 m, 30 75 mm; Phenomenex, Inc., Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of 45.0 mL/min. chemical shifts are reported in ppm with undeuterated solvent (DMSO at 2.49 ppm) as internal standard for DMSO-d6 solutions. all the analogues tested in the biological assays have a purity of greater than 95% based on both analytical methods. the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight and quenched with 1 N NaOH solution. the residue was redisolved in DMSO, filtered, and purified by preparative HPLC. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) ppm 7.31 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 4H), 7.28 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 4H), 5.78 (d, J = 3.2 Hz, 1H), 2.26 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, 1H), resulting reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 45 min. a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium iodide was added to the mixture. the reaction mixture was refluxed for 8 h, after which LC/MS analysis showed completion. the reaction mixture was concentrated and redisolved in EtOAc. the reaction mixture was partitioned between EtOAc and H2O. the layers separated, and the organic phase washed with brine. the reaction mixture was heated to 100 \u00b0C for 48 h. crude mixture was purified by flash column chromatography, silica gel with a gradient of 0\u20135% MeOH in CH2Cl2 to afford 31 (123 mg, 60%) as a free-base oil. phthalimide (147 mg, 1.000 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (262 mg, 1.00 mmol) were added to the mixture. azodicarboxylate was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness and residue purified by preparative HPLC. reaction mixture was stirred at 60 \u00b0C for 3 h, after which LCMS analysis showed product formation. tert-butyl (14-(4-Chlorophenyl) (Phenyl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl (Phenyl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)-3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecyl)carbamate (Rac-24) was concentrated under reduced pressure and residue purified by preparative HPLC. ethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)carbamate (174 mg, 0.558 mmol) in DMF (1.00 mL) was quenched with H2O and extracted with CH2Cl2. the organic layer was separated, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated. crude residue was purified by preparative HPLC to give Rac-25 (109 mg, 60%) as the TFA salt.
