{"summary": "the species Carnivore protoparvovirus I is a member of the Parvoviridae family. it includes the antigenic variants feline parvovirus (FPV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) the species is present in apparently healthy individuals from almost all wild and domestic carnivore populations tested (5\u20137) CPV infections in dogs have resulted in the emergence of different antigenic variants or strains. the first strain, designated CPV-2 (15), appeared in 1978 and was unable to infect felines. it spread globally and within a few months killed many naive domestic dogs. the most recent strains, CPV-2b and -2c, emerged in 1984 and 2000. fewer studies have focused on the role that africa wild animals play in carnivore parvovirus ecology. despite some studies concluding that wild carnivores have been infected by an unspecified carnivore parvovirus strain, it is perhaps more appropriate to conclude that seropositive wild carnivores have been infected. mass dog vaccination programs against rabies, canine distemper and CPV have been performed around the periphery of the Serengeti National Park (SNP) since 1996, this environment provides an opportunity to investigate the implications of mass dog vaccination in wild and domestic carnivore populations. no molecular studies have yet been carried out to characterize circulating strains in a wide range of potential host species. the fecal sample from the positive lion, which was added a posteriori, was positive for infection. the number of samples from different wild carnivore families and species that were positive for parvovirus DNA. the output from the binomial regression analysis investigating the determinants of carnivore parvovirus infection in the samples tested is given in Table 2. Liver samples (OR = 17.8 [95% CI, 1.8, 218]; P = 0.01) were significantly more likely to be infected. the year of sample collection was not a predictor of infection (Fig. 2). the shaded areas identify the Serengeti National Park (Serengeti), the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, and a number of unnamed game reserves. the locations of the villages where domestic dog samples were collected and the locations where positive and negative wildlife samples were collected are shown. FPV and CPV-2a isolates detected in black-backed jackals were found in two different individuals. this is the first time FPV DNA has been detected in jackals, hyenas, africa wild dogs, and white-tailed mongoose. this is the first time that FPV DNA has been detected in jackals, hyenas, africa wild dogs, and white-tailed mongoose. FPV sequences detected in wild carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem shared two mutations at two different residue positions that distinguish them from FPV sequences described elsewhere. the first mutation, F303Y, was found only in a cougar (Puma concolor) and could have arisen independently in this individual. a further mutation at position 20, where a Thr residue replaced an Ala residue (A20T), was present in three of eight FPV sequences containing this amino acid (belonging to two lions and a mongoose) this mutation was also found in four of the CPV sequences described in dogs sampled in this study. CPV-2a clustered phylogenetically with the CPV-2a sequences from dogs. a single mutation at amino acid position 323 (an Asp residue replaced the CPV-2a-typical Asn or Glu residues [Table 3]) was present. a single mutation at amino acid position 323 was present. 87.5% (CI, 47.3 to 99.7%) and 83.3% (CI, 35.9 to 99.6%) of dogs sampled were infected. none of the factors studied (village, year of sampling, or age or gender of dog) were significant predictors of infection. position 101 determines the antigenic structure and binding capabilities of the capsid (42), and a Thr residue at this position is typical of the CPV-2a, -2b, and -2c strains. the CPV-2 sequence found in H493 presented an intermediate viruslike feature at position 101. a third sequence (H469 from Merenga in 2008) was translated into the same amino acid sequence. a nucleotide sequence described in a dog in 2005 was found to be identical to the sequence of H503/H506. strain mutations (I219V and Q386K) were obtained from foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in china in 2009. all sequences showed a nucleotide identity of 99.8% and an amino acid identity of 99.5% with the sequence of H503/H506. the CPV-2 sequences isolated in this study clustered with two sequences from Italy and China and the Nobivac Puppy DP vaccine strain. the presence of carnivore parvovirus DNA was confirmed in 13.8% (confidence interval [CI], 8.7 to 20.3%) (n = 21) of samples and in 9 out of 14 wild carnivore species tested. hyena 32 2 6.3 (0.8\u201320.7) Striped hyena 2 1 50 (1.3\u201398.7) Total 152 21 13.8 (8.7\u201320.3) TABLE 2. Final regression output, investigating the determinants of the likelihood of detecting carnivore parvovirus DNA in the samples. the null deviance was 117.8 on 149 degrees of freedom. the residual deviance was 90.2 on 140 degrees of freedom. the AIC value was 110.2. a total of 21 positive wild carnivore samples, 13 vp2 gene fragments were sequenced. ten sequences consisted of 1,377 nucleotides, and one sequence each consisted of 1,311, 1,088, and 699 nucleotides. this is the first time that FPV DNA has been detected in jackals, hyenas, african wild dogs, and white-tailed mongoose. s, possibly introduced by the live-virus vaccine strain, and violet indicates important and repeated mutations found among the wildlife sequences. FPV sequences detected in wild carnivore species in the Serengeti ecosystem shared two mutations at two different residue positions. mutations were located at amino acid position 303, where a Tyr replaced a Phe residue. residue 303 is located in the capsid surface area that contacts the host cell receptor. as such, this position is subjected to evolutionary selective pressures. the second mutation, I101T, has occasionally been reported in FPV sequences. two pairs of amino acid sequences were pairwise identical. a single mutation at amino acid position 323 (an Asp residue replaced the CPV-2a-typical Asn or Glu residues) was present. a single mutation at amino acid position 323 was present. the FPV strains detected in the wildlife species in this study have a common ancestor. they formed a geographic cluster separated widely from other previously reported isolates. the FPV strains are closely related, suggesting cross-species transmission. of the CPV-2a strains, four were detected in Nyamburi (2005, 2006, and 2009), one was detected in Piyaya (2004), and one was detected in Kitawasi (2005). CPV-2 and CPV-2a strains were differentiated using amino acid positions 87, 101, 219, 300, 305, and 375. mutations I219V and Q386K were found in all the CPV-2 isolates. they were found in the live-virus vaccine strain contained in the Nobivac Puppy DP vaccine. these replacements were patented by the manufacturer and introduced in order to attenuate the virus. a nucleotide sequence described in a dog in Italy in 2005 (GenBank accession no. FJ222824) (45) was found to be identical to the sequence of H503/H506 and to the Nobivac Puppy DP vaccine strain described in Ecuador (GenBank accession no. MG264079) (46) it was not reported whether the isolate from Italy was collected from a vaccinated or unvaccinated dog. CPV-2a sequences isolated in this study clustered with two sequences from Italy and China and the Nobivac Puppy DP vaccine strain. domestic dogs living around the periphery of the SNP were infected with CPV. there was no evidence of cross-species transmission, suggesting the existence of two separate epidemiological systems. we found parvovirus DNA in 13.2% of wild carnivores sampled in the Serengeti ecosystem. the percentage of wildlife samples found to be positive did not change significantly across the 10 years studied or across the species tested. this lends weight to the hypothesis that carnivore parvoviruses are endemic in wildlife species in the Serengeti ecosystem. seropositivity in previous studies may have resulted from FPV infection. a mutation introduced less than 6 million years ago into the TfR gene confers resistance to FPV infection in most canine species. this mutation is present in coyotes (Canis latrans), wolves (Canis lupus), and domestic dogs (49\u201351) but has been shown to be lacking in red foxes, bat-eared foxes, and black-backed events of cross-species transmission of FPV among wildlife species have been previously documented in the wild (6, 10) and in captivity (54), suggesting that parvoviruses are transmitted between hosts during contact, for example, predation and/or scavenging of carcasses. phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship among all the sequences described. a recent analysis of long-term serological data to investigate the transmission ecology of CPV in the Serengeti ecosystem indicates that infection cycles in lions are coupled with those in dogs. however, as CPV and FPV are antigenically similar, it is likely that seropositive lions were infected with FPV, complicating the interpretation of the serological data. 65% of the sequenced viruses from dogs were CPV-2. this strain has been replaced in most areas of the world by newer antigenic types 2a, 2b, and, more recently, 2c (40). the detection of this strain in several different villages over a 4-year period generates confidence in this finding. the same artificial mutations have been reported in samples from foxes and raccoon dogs from china in 2009. this suggests that vdCPV could be transmitted to wild carnivores. a concern with live vaccine viruses is the potential for reversion to virulence. a vdCPV from domestic dog H493 sampled in 2009 had the amino acid substitution I101T, common to the CPV-2a strain and to the FPV strains detected in the Serengeti ecosystem. position 101 is variable, and this is the first time an intermediate CPV/CPV-2a strain has been reported in dogs (6). the percentage of wildlife samples found to be positive did not change significantly across the 10 years studied. this lends weight to the hypothesis that carnivore parvoviruses are endemic in wildlife species in the Serengeti ecosystem. a mutation introduced less than 6 million years ago into the TfR gene confers resistance to FPV infection in most canine species. this mutation is present in coyotes (Canis latrans), wolves (Canis lupus), and domestic dogs (49\u201351) but has been shown to be lacking in red foxes, bat-eared foxes, and black-backed jackals (51) this is consistent with the evolutionary history of hyenas, wild genetically indistinguishable viruses in sympatric species in the Serengeti ecosystem suggest that FPV can be transmitted between species. this clustering is due primarily to two specific mutations (F303Y and I101T) that characterize all identified Serengeti ecosystem strains. the clustering of Serengeti FPV sequences independently of other sequences reported in GenBank. a recent analysis of long-term serological data to investigate the transmission ecology of CPV in the Serengeti ecosystem indicates that infection cycles in lions are coupled with those in dogs. but as CPV and FPV are antigenically similar, it is likely that seropositive lions were infected with FPV, complicating the interpretation of the serological data. a modified live vaccine virus was the source of this CPV-2 strain. this strain has been replaced in most areas of the world by the newer antigenic types 2a, 2b, and, more recently, 2c (40). the detection of this strain in several different villages over a 4-year period generates confidence. the circulation of vaccine-derived strains CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c would be of more concern than the circulation of the CPV-2 strain. the circulation of vaccine-derived strains CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c would be of more concern than the circulation of the CPV-2 strain because it has been shown that field strains 2a, 2b, and 2c are able to cause disease in felids this is the first time an intermediate CPV/CPV-2a strain has been reported in dogs (6). it is not clear whether this substitution arose after a recombination or a mutation event. the second intermediate mutation was described in the black-backed jackal H398 sequence in 2011. nivore postmortem examinations carried out in the Serengeti National Park (SNP) nivore postmortem examinations were carried out. the cause of death for each sampled wild carnivores
