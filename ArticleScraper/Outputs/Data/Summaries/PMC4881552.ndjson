{"summary": "prolonged and/or overdosed GC therapy is the leading cause of secondary osteoporosis. approximately 39% develop osteonecrosis within a few months of GC treatment. previous studies found that GCs could inhibit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell proliferation. PEDF expression plays a key role in endochondral ossification. PEDF effects are blocked by antibodies which are cell surface-binding antagonists. PEDF receptor (PEDF-R) induces phospholipase A2, liberating lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and fatty acids. dexamethasone induces cell death and promotes apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were exposed to a wide range of DEX concentrations for 24 h. 105 mol/L DEX was assessed at different time points. dexamethasone Regulates Pigment Epithelial-Derived Factor (PEDF) at the Gene and Protein Levels. a decrease of PEDF on mRNA and PEDF protein levels, respectively, was observed. dexamethasone down-regulates pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. cells were exposed to DEX at different concentrations for 24 h. mRNA levels and protein levels were detected by RT-PCR. anti-PEDF-R antibodies were used to knock down PEDF-R. RNA interference assays were used to knock down PEDF-R. PEDF attenuated DEX-induced MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts with reduced PEDF expression exhibited increased apoptosis compared with controls. protective effect of PEDF reducing DEX-induced MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis was attenuated by PEDF-R siRNA. PEDF-R mediated PEDF activates PI3K/Akt pathway by increasing LPA levels in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. PEDF-R mediated PEDF activates PI3K/Akt pathway by increasing LPA levels in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. xamethasone (DEX) induces cell death and promotes apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were exposed to a wide range of DEX concentrations for 24 h. 105 mol/L DEX was assessed at different time points. dexamethasone regulates Pigment Epithelial-Derived Factor (PEDF) at the Gene and Protein Levels. a decrease of PEDF on mRNA and PEDF protein levels was observed. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts exposed to DEX at different concentrations. cells were incubated with 105 mol/L DEX for different times. PEDF mRNA levels (upper panels) and protein levels (lower panels) were detected. PEDF attenuates DEX-induced MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis. PEDF knockdown increased caspase-3 activity in osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts with reduced PEDF expression showed increased apoptosis compared with controls. protective effect of PEDF reducing DEX-induced MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast apoptosis was attenuated by PEDF-R siRNA. PEDF-R mediated PEDF activates PI3K/Akt pathway by increasing LPA levels in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. PEDF-R mediated PEDF activates PI3K/Akt pathway by increasing LPA levels in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. apoptosis pathways are activated under DEX treatment. GCs could down-regulate several Bcl-2-related anti-apoptotic molecules. the translational isoforms of GR could selectively regulate pro-apoptotic enzymes in pre-osteoblasts. rPEDF could protect against dex-induced apoptosis in cultured MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. rPEDF had no effect on MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast survival in normal conditions. however, treatment with DEX down-regulated PEDF expression and modified this balance. mice showed increased total body fat [21,29], illustrating its systemic role as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. PEDF can protect against DEX-induced apoptosis and alter cell survival partly through LPA-mediated Akt activation. apoptosis due in part to PEDF level reduction. existing research suggests that PEDF contributes to osteogenesis and osteoblast survival. dexamethasone suppresses PEDF expression, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for DEX-induced osteoporosis or other bone-related diseases. cell counting kit (CCK-8) was obtained from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan) Mem-PERTM Plus Kit (Membrane Protein Extraction Kit) was obtained from Biovision, Inc. (San Francisco, CA, USA) ELISA kits for PEDF and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were purchased from Cloud-clone Corp. dex was used at different concentrations and times to evaluate the relationship between glucocorticoids and osteoblast apoptosis. after incubation, the assays described below were performed. primary antibodies raised against cleaved caspase-3, -actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), cleaved PARP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), PEDF, PEDF-R, phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), total Akt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), and Na/K ATPase were added overnight at 4 \u00b0C. products were obtained on a DNA thermal cycler, and analyzed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA interference assays were used to knock down PEDF-R. membrane fraction proteins were passed through spin columns with NeutrAvidin gels. samples were analyzed on a flow cytometer (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) within 1 h. MC3T3-E1 cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC, PI and Hochest33342. Hoechst 33342 and Dexamethasone (DEX) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. dexamethasone (DEX) was dissolved in ethanol and stored at 20 \u00b0C. cell counting kit (CCK-8) was purchased from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan) MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts are derived from murine calvaria osteoblasts and have similar behavior to primary calvarial osteoblasts. cells were maintained in -MEM medium (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. equal amounts of proteins were separated by 7%12% SDS-PAGE. membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies raised against cleaved caspase-3, -actin. cDNA was synthesized using ScriptRT Reverse Transcriptase. cDNA was synthesized using TRIzol Plus RNA Purification Kit. -actin-forward (mouse) 5\u2032-CCTCTATGCCAACACAGTGC-3\u2032 and -actin-reverse (mouse) 5\u2032-ACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGAC-3\u2032 were analyzed using the Quanti Scan software. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts were harvested and resuspended in PBS at 1 106 cells/mL. after centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 4\u20135 min, the cells were gently resuspended in 500 L of cold binding buffer, 5 L of Annexin V-FITC and 5 L of propidium iodide (PI) this is the first study to show that GCs down-regulate PEDF expression, which contributes to osteoblast apoptosis. the detailed regulatory mechanisms and what happens to PEDF in osteoclasts under DEX treatment need further investigation."}
