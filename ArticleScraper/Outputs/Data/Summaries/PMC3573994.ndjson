{"summary": "metapneumovirus was first recognized in 2001 in the Netherlands from nasopharyngeal aspirates collected during a 20-year period in 28 hospitalized children and infants with acute respiratory tract infection. the virus genomic sequence was identified by randomly primed PCR protocol and revealed to be closely related to the avian pneumovirus, a member of the Metapneumovirus genus, in the paramixoviridrid. a large epidemiological retrospective study examined nasal washes collected over a 20-year period during acute respiratory illnesses in an outpatient cohort of children. hMPV was detected in 1%-5% of pediatric upper RTIs (UTRIs), with variation from year to year. other reported syndromes include asthma exacerbation, otitis media, flulike illness, and community-acquired pneumonia. s with RSV and hMPV are more severe than infections with either RSV or hMPV alone, requiring a longer hospitalization and supplemental oxygenation [38,39]. s with either hMPV or hMPV are more severe than infections with either RSV or hMPV alone, requiring a longer hospitalization. flu HRV HEV HPeV PIV hMPV ADV RSV Coronavirus HBoV Polyomavirus H1N1 A B HCoV 229E HCoV NL63 HCoV HKU1 WUPyV KIPyV Greensill, 2003 X(a) X(a) pediatric (30, ventilated and with bronchiolitis) 70% rates of co-infection RSV-hMPV in a cohort of infants no virus co-infection between RSV and hMPV in a cohort of infants with bronchiolitis Foulongne, 2006 (d) (d) (d) X(a) (d) 589 children hospitalized with respiratory disease5 years 8.5% rates of hMPV infections, the second leading cause of RTD after RSV, 30% of the cases are hMPV-RSV coinfections. most co-infections were with HCoV-NL63 co-infections with RSV-A. most co-infections were with hcov NL63 positive, 33% coinfected NL63-HRV, 10% coinfected NL63-HRV. coinfections were observed for HKU1, NL63 and OC43, mostly with RSV. no d(d)ferences of HCoV viral load were observed between single infection and RSV coinfection. high load and viremic HBoV infection were associated with respiratory tract symptoms. a low viral load in the nasopharinx alone has uncertain relevance. it was the fourth most common virus in the material after RSV (25%), HRV (17%) and hMPV(14%) those diagnosed with high load of HBoV DNAin nasal/throat swabs Don, 2010 (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) (e) most frequently detected virus was RSV (40.%), followed by HRV (20.%), HBoV (11.5%), PIV1-3 (8%), AdV (7.5%), FluA (7%), HMPV (6.%), NL63 (4%), HKU1 (2.%) and FluB (0.98%). of the HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63-positive samples, 74% were co-infected with at least another virus, most commonly HRV and R WUPyV was detected in 7% children with LARD, 4.2% of asymptomatic children and as coinfection with other respiratory viruses in 67.6%. it is not possible to prove a causal relationship between the detection of KIV and WUV and respiratory disease from these findings. no association found between CD4+ cell counts in HIV-1 positive patients and infection with KIPyV or WUPyV Debiaggi, 2010. asymptomatic adulthematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients 0.79% KIPyV, 0.79% WuPyV positive among transplant recipients. higher viral loads for KIPyV (but not for WUPyV) in the immunocompromised group was detected and infection with either virus occurred in older children compared with controls. no clear clinical difference has been noted between single or mixed HRV-C infections Harvala, 2008. HRV-A/B Miller, 2009 X(a) 1052 hospitalized children 5 years with acute respiratory illness HRVCs were detected in 7% of children hospitalized for fever or respiratory conditions. 3,800 children aged 2 to 13 years with respiratory illness EV109 isolates were then detected in 1.6% of respiratory samples of children with influenza like illness (ILI) the prevalence of HpeV is 0.4%.

HCoV-NL63 co-infections with RSV-A occurred predominantly in the hospitalised patients. the most common symptoms are rhinorrhea, fever, and abdominal breath sounds. pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, bronchiolitis, and acute asthma exacerbations were also described. dual infections with RSV and Coronaviruses NL63, HKU1 or OC43 indicating that RSV may presumably facilitate coronavirus infection without increasing disease severity. however, in the same study considering viral load data, a role of these coronaviruses in coinfections in respiratory disease was suggested. HBoV was the most frequently detected virus after RSV and HRV. three other related bocaviruses (HBoV2, 3 and 4) have been identified in stool samples and associated with gastrointestinal diseases. serological studies on HBoV1 are in line with molecular data. HBoV1 is the most probable cause of respiratory tract disease if the patient has a single infection and high viral load in the nasopharinx alone. despite these diagnostic challenges it is becoming increasingly evident that HBoV1 is an important respiratory pathogen. samples from children with respiratory tract disease ranging from 0.2% to 2.7% and from 1.1 to 7% respectively. link between these polyomaviruses and acute respiratory diseases remains speculative. a co-detection rate of 74% has been observed for KIPyV. real-time PCR detected KIPyV and WUPyV in 2.6% and 4.6% of HIV-1\u2013infected patients respectively. no association was found between CD4+ cell counts in HIV-1 positive patients and infection with KIPyV or WUPyV. the new HRV lineage designated HRV-C has been identified using molecular methods and associated with severe clinical presentations in infants and immunocompromised adults. symptoms of patients infected with this new strain were mainly bronchiolitis, wheezing, and asthmatic exacerbation in cases from Australia and Hong Kong. HRV-C monoinfection group, HRV-A or HRV-B monoinfection group and RSV group were statistically the least likely virus of 17 examined to be associated with co-infections. in a large study, HRVs were statistically the least likely virus of 17 examined to be associated with co-infections. two recent studies have investigated the involvement of HPeVs in respiratory diseases reporting a low frequency of detection and a lack of clear disease association. however, a high rate of co-infection with other respiratory viruses was observed in HPeV positive samples. more children and younger adults were infected by the pandemic flu strain. young children presented a higher attack rate than older adults. a childhood mortality rate of 6 per million population was reported. in the same H1N1v early pandemic period, few RSV infections were reported compared with epidemiological data in the same period of the last four years. the delayed and reduced circulation of RSV observed in 2009\u201310 compared with 2008\u201309 suggests that the early circulation of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses had an impact on the RSV epidemic. nasopharyngeal aspirates collected during a 20-year period in 28 hospitalized children and infants with acute respiratory tract infection (RTI) hMPV was detected in 1%-5% of pediatric upper RTIs (UTRIs) over the entire study period, hMPV was detected in 1%-5% of pediatric upper RTIs. hMPV and hMPV co-infection were associated with increased disease severity and higher risk of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. similar findings are supported by other studies suggesting that in young children, coinfections with RSV and hMPV are more severe than infections with either RSV or hMPV alone. in experimental studies performed in macaques, a synergy between hMPV and SARS was not confirmed. infections of hMPV with respiratory viruses different from RSV have also been occasionally reported but no sufficient data are available to discuss epidemiology or association with clinical disease presentation. olitis is hMPV positive, 67.9% RSV positive, without clinical d(d)ference. no virus co-infection between RSV and hMPV in a cohort of infants with bronchiolitis. HCoV-NL63 can present as croup, asthma exacerbation, febrile seizures, and high fever. most co-infections were with RSV-A HCoV-NL63 co-infections with PIV3. minosse, 2008 X(a) X(a) X(a) hospitalized adult patients (433, mean age 56 years) 2% Hcov NL63 positive, 33% coinfected NL63-HRV, 10% coinfected NL63-ADV Wu, 2008 X X X(b) 539 children 15 years with respiratory disease 1.3% HCoV NL63 positive, 43% of HCoV infection are coinfections (RSV, ADV, HBoV was the fourth most common virus in the material after RSV (25%), HRV (17%) and hMPV(14%) multiple viral infections were present in 78% of the samples. prevalence of HBoV infection was 3.8%. 817 children with respiratory tract infection HBoV was ident(d)ied in 12% of samples. co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 51%. presence of IgM was significantly more prevalent in viremic patients. HBoV was detected significantly more often than any of the 14 respiratory viruses but HRVs. most frequently detected virus was RSV (40.%), followed by HRV (20.%), HBoV (11.5%), PIV1-3 (8%), AdV (7.5%), FluA (7%), HMPV (6.%), NL63 (4%), HKU1 (2.%) and FluB (0.98%). X(b) 2,263 samples from children 4 years of age and 374 from children >4 years of age for routine respiratory virus detection 2.7% samples positive for WU polyomavirus and 71% coinfected with other viruses. repeated identification of WU polyomavirus in the same patients suggests that it may persistently infect humans. X(a) 1,326 hospitalized children with acute respiratory diseases 4.9% positive WUPyV. 56% co-infections with other viruses (ADV, fluA, hBoV and RSV) hematology/oncology patients and immunocompetent controls with acute respiratory illnesses Prevalence of WUPyV and KIPyV is similar in hematology/oncology patients (3% and 5.6%, respectively) compared with the general pediatric population (5% and 2.3, respectively) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X(a) X( the most commonly identified HPeVs were HpeV1(58%) and HpeV3 (37%). the frequent association of HPeV with other respiratory viruses may indicate a less pathogenic role for HPeV. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have been identified as common causes of community-acquired respiratory infections. the coronaviruses are reported in 7 to 12-month old children with both upper and lower RTIs. HCoV-NL63 was found in croup, asthma exacerbation, febrile seizures, wheezing and high fever cases. most co-infections were with RSV-A, probably because of the high percentage of RSV-A infections. double infection of NL63 with RSV-B and with PIV3 occurred in a minority of cases. a high number of coinfections was observed for HKU1, NL63 as well as for OC43, mostly with RSV. no differences in clinical outcome were observed between single and dual infections with RSV and Coronaviruses NL63, HKU1 or OC43. a role of these coronaviruses in coinfections in respiratory disease was suggested. HBoV was detected in 12% of children with RTI. it was the fourth most common virus after RSV, HRV and hMPV. recently, in children with radiographically confirmed community acquired pneumonia, HBoV was the most frequently detected virus after RSV. a positive correlation was seen between respiratory illness and high copy numbers of HBoV1 DNA or the presence of HBoV1 monoinfection. HBoV DNA was reported more frequently in patient blood during acute symptoms than after recovery. despite these diagnostic challenges it is becoming increasingly evident that HBoV1 is an important respiratory pathogen. KI (Karolinska Institute) polyomavirus (KIPyV) and WU (Washington University) polyomavirus (WUPyV) infection is widespread ranging from 54.1 and 67% for KI and from 66.4% and 89% for WU in North American and German blood donors. a co-detection rate of 74% has been observed for KIPyV. real-time PCR detected KIPyV and WUPyV in 2.6% and 4.6% of HIV-1\u2013infected patients respectively. no association was found between CD4+ cell counts in HIV-1-infected patients and infection with KIPyV or WUPyV. HRVs are currently classified in the Picornaviridae family, genus Enterovirus, that includes 3 species: HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C. the new HRV lineage designated HRV-C has been identified using molecular methods and associated with severe clinical presentations in infants and immunocompromised adults. the new HRV lineage designated HRV-C has been identified using molecular methods. the severity of clinical manifestations for HRV-C is comparable to that for HRV-A in children with community-acquired pneumonia. in a study, monoinfection was observed in more than half of cases and was more common than RSV monoinfection in patients with upper RTD. in a large study HRVs were statistically the least likely virus of 17 examined to be associated with co-infections. a recent study describes a clinical case of severe respiratory and pericardial disease in an infant infected by HRV-C. this suggests tha viral tropism is not strictly restricted to the respiratory tract. a study focusing on the global distribution of novel rhinovirus indicates its association with community outbreaks and pediatric respiratory disease also in Africa. EV104 genotype was first identified in Switzerland in 2010 from respiratory samples collected during 2004\u20132007 in 8 children with respiratory signs and symptoms. in immunocompetent patients EV104 was associated with chronic rhinopharyngytis. only in one out of 5 patients a coinfecting virus was detected. a total of 642 confirmed cases of human infection with the outbreak strain of H1N1v were identified in 41 states in the USA. the age of hospitalized patients ranged from 19 months to 51 years and among the hospitalized patients, 18% were children under the age of 5 years. a high rate of co-infection with other respiratory viruses was observed in HPeV positive samples. the rate was highest for children less than 1 year and with severe pre-existing disorders. the occurrence of co-infection with influenza A H1N1v and other respiratory viruses has been reported in few studies. TTV produces long-lasting (possibly life-long) viremia in about 80% of apparently healthy individuals of all ages and living in different countries[158] studies could not confirm the association, but documented a link between TTV infection in children and asthma, suggesting that TTV might be a contributing factor in the lung impairment caused by this condition. the use of diagnostic assays able to simultaneously detect more respiratory viruses, including the newly identified ones, and in some cases their load, will help clarify virus-host interactions. this will allow to develop appropriate control measures for nosocomial infection containment. in many cases respiratory viruses pave the way to severe secondary bacterial infections. from 1984 to 1991, following the award of a Research Grant in the area of infectious diseases, she worked in the department of microbiology. since November 1992 she is Researcher at the Department of Clinical and Diagnostic Sciences, Unit of Microbiology, University of Pavia. her teaching activity is currently held in the official courses of Medical Microbiology for medical students.
