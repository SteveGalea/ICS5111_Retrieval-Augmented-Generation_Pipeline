{"summary": "the implementation of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) has revolutionized the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections due to their high sensitivity and specificity. many commercially available tests have focused on the detection of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and have been used in point-of-care facilities, limiting the number of samples that can be analysed simultaneously. the Panther Fusion\u00ae platform detects a smaller number of viral targets. the reduced response time, random access and possibility of testing samples urgently are sufficiently attractive arguments to consider its clinical use. both assays consist of three multiplex real-time rRT-PCR panels. panel 1 for detection of flu A, Flu B, RSV A, RSV B and Flu A subtypes H1, H1pdm09 and H3; panel 2 for detection of PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, AdV, hMPV and human enterovirus (hEV) and panel 3 for RV, human coronavirus (hCoV) OC43, 229E and NL63, and human bocavirus (hBoV) no Yes Sample volume 200 l 500 l Elution volume 100 l 50 l PCR reaction volumen Final volume: 25 l Nucleic acid extraction 4: 5\u201310 l Number of PCR amplification cycles 45 45 Reagent storage temperature - 20 oC 4 oC 1The analysis of the results must be carried out with a specific program. 405 samples from patients suspected of respiratory viral infection tested simultaneously by both assays. a retrospective part of the study was carried out to test samples for viruses that do not normally circulate during the months of December and January. more than one virus had been previously detected in 39 of these 400 positive samples. residual supernatants were retrieved from storage at -80 oC. the first two aliquots of each specimen were thawed to be tested. the third was kept at -80 oC to be used in the case of discrepancy. multiplexed rRT-PCR tests were used to detect and differentiate respiratory viruses. rRT-PCR was performed in a manner blinded to the results of the other NAATs. amplification, test turnaround time, characteristics of the amplification, sample volume, possibility of primary tube utilization, STAT capability and reagent storage conditions are shown in Table 1. a third PCR-based assay (R-GENE\u00ae, bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France, 18, 19] using duplex. reactions were carried out as a reference method in the case of discordant results. the following panels were used: Influenza A/B, RSV/hMPV, Rhino & EV/Cc, HCoV/HPIV. Specimen collection A total of 865 clinical specimens were analyzed. 563 were nasopharyngeal exudates, 236 nasopharyngeal aspirates, 46 BALs and 20 AdV-positive culture supernatants. sided 95% score (Wilson) confidence intervals (CIs) were also estimated. inter-rater agreement statistics (kappa values; k) were used to compare detection of viral targets between the Panther Fusion and Allplex assays. a two-tailed Student\u2019s t test was performed to determine statistical significance. both tests showed excellent sensitivity and specificity values. Panther Fusion had sensitivity values >0.95 for all viral targets. Allplex showed values lower than 0.95 for detection of hMPV and RV, though still >0.90. allplex detected 11 RV positives that were not detected in Panther Fusion. only one was confirmed by R-GENE. hMPV in 10 samples that were not positive by Allplex. a total of 399 samples were analyzed for Flu A and B, RSV, AdV, hMPV and RV. in 20 samples, more than 1 virus was detected. the overall results obtained by both primary assays for each virus are shown in Table 4. hMPV 6 393 3 1 0.83 (0.36\u20130.99) 0.99 (0.97\u20130.99) 0.62 (0.25\u20130.89) 0.99 (0.98\u20130.99) 1 1 0.83 (0.36\u20130.99) 0.99 (0.98\u20130.99) 0.83 (0.36\u20130.99) 0.99 (0.98\u20130.99) RV 37 362 5 2 0.94 (0.80\u20130.99) 0.87 (0.72\u20130.99) 13 2 0.94 (0.80\u20130.99) 0.96 (0.93\u2013 results for all the viruses investigated in 150 samples (37.0%) and discrepant results in 75 samples (18.8%). both methodologies yield high values, ranging from 0.83\u20131 with good predictive values. the values reached by Panther Fusion for the detection of RSV stand out. 194 (22.7) Negative, n (%) 14 (1.6) 651 (75.8) 665 (77.3) Total, n (%) 201 (23.4) 658 (76.6) 859 (100.0) Flu B 98.6 0.95 (0.92\u20130.98) Positive, n (%) 128 (14.9) 3 (0.4) 131 (15.3) Negative, n (%) 9 (1.0) 719 (83.7) 728 (84.7) Total, n (%) 137 (1 n (%) 7 (0.8) 799 (92.7) 806 (93.5) Total, n (%) 59 (6.8) 803 (93.2) 862 (100.0) Flu A, virus influenza A; Flu B, virus influenza B; RSV, Respiratory Syncytial Virus; AdV, Adenovirus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; CI, confidence interval Amplification efficiency. 0.001 PIV 27.79 (23.16\u201333.17) 28.80 (23.05\u201334.45) 0.39 1 Median value calculated using the generic amplification values of influenza A virus Flu A, virus influenza A; Flu B, virus influenza B; RSV, Respiratory Syncytial Virus; AdV, Adenovirus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; IQR, interquartile range Discordant results. 117 samples presented values of Ct >30 in both tests. most of them showed a Ct value between 35 and 40 cycles. only 3 samples with a Ct 30 in Panther Fusion were discordant.

Panther Fusion was validated alongside Allplex as a sensitive and specific assay for detecting the most common viruses responsible for respiratory infections."}
