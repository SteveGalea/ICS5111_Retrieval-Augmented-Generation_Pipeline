{"summary": "human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection can lead to development of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) little is known about the immune response against HBZ in HTLV-1-infected individuals. ham/TSP is characterized by perivascular inflammatory infiltrates in the brain and spinal cord, with a predominance of HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells. despite strong HTLV-1-specific immune responses, HTLV-1 proviral loads are significantly elevated in HAM/TSP patients compared to AC [12] a novel gene, HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), has been identified. HBZ mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all ATL cells and promotes the growth and survival of the leukemic cells. HBZ was found to inhibit tax-mediated viral gene transcription from the 5\u2019 LTR. HTLV-1-specific antibody responses using LIPS showed a differential pattern of antibody responses between HTLV-1-infected and uninfected subjects. the majority of each group was comprised of females, although the proportion of females in each group ranged from 53.9% in the ATL group to 83.5% in the AC group (p 0.0003). information on age was missing for 1 HAM/TSP subject from Jamaican cohort. there were no significant differences in frequency or magnitude of anti-HBZ antibody responses in serum/plasma. strong mean antibody levels against HBZ were detected in the HTLV-1-infected groups, including AC, ATL patients and HAM/TSP patients. the differences of the mean antibody level were statistically significant for the AC and HAM/TSP groups relative to the ND group. data were obtained from 98 ND, 145 AC, 89 ATL patients and 104 HAM/TSP patients. antibody responses against HBZ were detected in HTLV-1-infected groups (AC, ATL and HAM/TSP) the horizontal line represents the mean. the prevalence of HBZ immunoreactivity was detected in 10.0% (3/30) of ATL patients with the acute subtype, 24.14% (7/29) of those with the chronic subtype, and 33% (1/30) of those with the lymphoma subtype. the prevalence of HBZ immunoreactivity was detected in 10.0% (3/30) of ATL patients with the acute subtype. HBZ-specific immunoreactivity was detected in a subset of HTLV-1 infected subjects. antibody responses against Gag, Env or Tax did not differ significantly. we also compared HTLV-1 proviral load and HBZ mRNA expression between HTLV-1-infected individuals with and without HBZ-specific immunoreactivity. HBZ mRNA expression and HTLV-1 antibody titer in serum [27]. comparison of antibody responses against HTLV-1, proviral loads and HBZ mRNA expression of HTLV-1-infected individuals. antibody responses for HTLV-1 Gag, Env, Tax and HBZ were detected in both serum and CSF samples of all five HAM/TSP patients. HBZ-specific antibody responses in CSF were detected at lower levels compared to serum. production of HBZ-specific antibodies was detected in 9.2-41.4% of immortalized memory B cells from all three HAM/TSP patients with HBZ-specific antibody response. production of HBZ-specific antibodies was detected in 9.2-41.4% of immortalized memory B cells from all three HAM/TSP patients with HBZ-specific antibody response. HBZ-specific antibody production was not detected in the memory B cell cultures of both HAM/TSP patients without HBZ-specific antibody response HBZ-specific IgG significantly inhibited the spontaneous lymphoproliferation in PBMCs of a HAM/TSP patient without anti-HBZ response. HBZ-specific IgG significantly inhibited the spontaneous lymphoproliferation predominantly in CD8+ T cells of HAM/TSP patients without anti-HBZ response. the frequency of CD8+CD25+ cells was less in HAM/TSP patients with anti-HBZ response than those of NDs. HBZ-specific antibody responses may have a role in suppressing T cell activation in HAM/TSP patients. the data were obtained from 7 HAM/TSP patients without anti-HBZ response (closed circles) and one ND (opened circle) as control. the majority of each group was comprised of females, although the proportion of females in each group ranged from 53.9% in the ATL group to 83.5% in the AC group (p 0.0001) male 15 [20.5] 22 [16.5] 41 [46.1] 13 [26.5] Female 58 [79.5] 111 [83.5] 48 [53.9] 36 [73.5] Race (n[%]) African-descent 72 [98.6] 132 [99.2] 86 [96.6] 42 [85.7] Caucasian-descent 0 [0.0] 0 [0.0] 1 [2.0] Other 0 [0.0] 1 [3.0] 0 [ there were no significant differences in frequency or magnitude of anti-HBZ antibody responses in serum/plasma between Jamaican and NIH subjects. strong mean antibody levels against HBZ were detected in the HTLV-1-infected groups, including AC, ATL patients and HAM/TSP patients. the differences of the mean antibody level were statistically significant for the AC and HAM/TSP groups relative to the ND group. the data were obtained from 98 ND, 145 AC, 89 ATL patients and 104 HAM/TSP patients. the distribution of subjects with antibody response against HBZ among the groups was compared by Chi-Square Test. the prevalence of HBZ immunoreactivity was detected in 10.0% (3/30) of ATL patients with the acute subtype, 24.14% (7/29) of those with the chronic subtype, and 3.33% (1/30) of those with the lymphoma subtype. the prevalence of HBZ immunoreactivity was detected in 10.0% (3/30) of ATL patients with the acute subtype, 24.14% (7/29) of those with the chronic subtype, and 33% (1/30) of those fected individuals with or without HTLV-related diseases had immunoreactivity against HTLV-1 HBZ. HBZ-specific immunoreactivity was detected in a subset of HTLV-1 infected subjects. antibody responses against Gag, Env and Tax did not differ significantly. antibody responses for HBZ did not correlate with proviral loads or HBZ mRNA expression in HAM/TSP patients. HTLV-1 proviral loads were examined in PBMCs of HAM/TSP patients using Mann\u2013Whitney Test. correlation of immunoreactivity against HBZ with HTLV-1 proviral loads (closed circles) and HBZ mRNA expression (opened circles) in 6 HAM/TSP patients with antibody response against HBZ by Spearman\u2019s correlation test. antibody responses for HTLV-1 Gag, Env and tax were detected in both serum and CSF samples of all five HAM/TSP patients. tax (C) and HBZ (D) were examined in serum (opened bar) and in CSF (closed bar) to those in serum of two HAM/TSP patients with HBZ-specific antibody responses. to confirm the inhibitory effect of HBZ-specific antibody on T cell activation, we further attempted to generate immortalized memory B cells producing HBZ-specific antibody from HAM/TSP patients. HBZ protein (25 kDa) and HBZ-Renilla luciferase (Ruc) fusion protein (61 kDa) were detected in nuclear protein extract of HTLV-1 infected cell lines (MT-2 and HUT102) and HBZ/pRen2 transfected 293T cells, respectively, using anti-HBZ (+) B cell culture supernatant. HBZ-specific IgG significantly inhibited the spontaneous the frequency of CD8+CD25+ T cells was less in HAM/TSP patients with anti-HBZ antibody response than those of NDs. HBZ-specific antibody responses may have a role in suppressing T cell activation in HAM/TSP patients. the data were obtained from 7 HAM/TSP patients without anti-HBZ response (closed circles) and one ND (opened circle) as control. HBZ gene is constitutively expressed in HTLV-1-infected cells, ATL cells and PBMC of HTLV-1-infected individuals. HBZ-specific CD8+ T cells were detected in HTLV-1-infected individuals. HBZ-specific CTL clones were able to lyse naturally infected cells. HBZ-specific immune responses appear to be lower compared to other HTLV-1 immunodominant proteins, Gag, Env and Tax. median survival of patients with ATL is 20 weeks; patients with acute subtype survive for a median of 13 weeks. patients with the acute subtype survive for a median of 13 weeks. patients with the chronic subtype survive for a median of 20 weeks. patients with the chronic subtype survive for a median of 25 weeks. the regulatory protein Tat plays an important role in viral infectivity and pathogenicity. antibody responses for HBZ were only observed in a subset of HTLV-1-infected individuals. HBZ-specific humoral immune response will be required to characterize the humoral immune response against HBZ in HTLV-1-associated diseases. in the future it will be interesting to examine the relationship between CSF proviral load, and the presence or level of anti-HBZ antibody in CSF and to compare the clinical phenotype of HAM/TSP patients with and without anti-HBZ antibodies. in the future it will be interesting to examine the relationship between CSF proviral load, and the presence or level of anti-HBZ antibody in CSF and to compare the clinical phenotype of ham/TSP patients. it remains to be defined how HBZ-specific antibody inhibits CD8+ T cell proliferation in HAM/TSP patients. however, since humoral immunity is not limited to extracellular viral recognition but can neutralize a virus even within the cytosol of infected cells, HBZ-specific antibodies might therefore be able to interact with HBZ within HTLV-I infected cells. further experiments including the nuclear retention and translation of HBZ mRNAs and the involvement of HB serum samples were obtained from 92 subjects, including 25 HTLV-1-seronegative donors (NDs), 12 ACs and 55 HAM/TSP patients. all serum and plasma samples from study subjects were previously tested for HTLV by ELISA or EIA. acute ATL is the most common subtype, accounting for 47% of patients. the lymphoma and chronic subtypes occur in 27% and 21% of patients. a fourth subtype, smoldering ATL, is uncommon, occurring in only 6% of Jamaican ATL patients. all anti-HBZ data from independent experiments were normalized using the LU values of positive control rabbit anti-HBZ serum. cut-off values for anti-HBZ immunoreactivity were defined as an HBZ-LIPS antibody response that was in the 100 percentile of the values of the ND group (6853 LU). hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was detected as an endogenous control. the HTLV-1-infected cell line MT-2 was used as a calibrator sample. the level of HBZ mRNA expression was then calculated using the comparative CT method. protein concentration was determined using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) from each protein sample, 50 g was electrophoresed through a NuPAGE\u00ae 4-12% Bis\u2013Tris gel (Invitrogen) the gel was transferred to a nitrocellurose membrane (Invitrogen) after blocking with 3% BSA in TBS, the membrane was visualized by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal\u00ae West Pico Chemiluminescent 2105 cells/well into 96 U-bottom microplates with 1 g/ml of HBZ-specific IgG or human IgG as control. the data were acquired on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) race, gender and age information for each patient were organized into matrix form with the anti-HBZ data generated for each patient. s correlation was used to evaluate association between anti-HBZ antibody levels and proviral DNA loads. anti-HBZ data was log (base = 2) transformed then fit via the four-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model. per race, subjects were coded as \u201cyoung\u201d, \u201cyoung to middle-age\u201d, \u201cmiddle-age to senior\u201d or \u201csenior\u201d. serum/plasma samples were obtained from 344 subjects, including 73 NDs, 133 HTLV-1 seropositive ACs, 89 ATL patients and 49 HAM/TSP patients. in Jamaica, acute ATL is the most common subtype, accounting for 47% of ATL patients. each mammalian expression vector with the HTLV-1 gene was transfected into 293T cells using FuGENE\u00ae6 transfection reagent. cut-off values for anti-HBZ immunoreactivity were defined as an HBZ-LIPS antibody response that was in the 100 percentile of the values of the ND group. HTLV-1 HBZ mRNA detection Total RNAs were extracted from PBMCs of HAM/TSP patients by RNeasy\u00ae Mini Kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacture\u2019s instructions. the sequence of primers and probe for HBZ mRNA detection were as follows: 5\u2032-aga acg cga ctc aac cgg-3\u2032, 5\u2032-tga caa gca tcg a culture supernatants of memory B cells producing anti-HBZ were collected and stored at 807\u00b0C until use. western blot determined production of HBZ-specific antibody from memory B cell culture. the intensity of HBZ proteins detected by B cell culture supernatant or rabbit anti-HBZ serum was normalized by the intensity of -actin. Flow cytometry was performed using a LSR II (BD Biosciences) PBMCs were stained with CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD25. anti-HBZ antibody levels between anti-HBZ positive and anti-HBZ negative groups, proviral DNA loads and HBZ mRNA expression between anti-HBZ positive and anti-HBZ negative groups. the Chi-Square Test was used to compare the gender and racial distribution among the groups, numbers of anti-HBZ positive and anti-HBZ negative subjects between study groups.
