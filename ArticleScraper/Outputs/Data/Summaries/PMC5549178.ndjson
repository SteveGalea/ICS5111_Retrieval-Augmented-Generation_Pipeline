{"summary": "four types of influenza viruses, designated influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), influenza C virus (ICV) and influenza D virus (IDV) have been identified. the genomes of IAV and IBV consist of eight RNA segments. ICV and IDV contain only seven segments. the viral HEF glycoprotein is a primary force in dictating the exceptional stability of IDV infectivity at low temperatures and high heat. the viruses are listed in Fig. 1A, including two IAVs (originated from swine and human), one ICV (from human), and two IDVs (from cattle and swine) IDV D/OK/13 retained a high residual infectivity, while IAV, IBV, and ICV were completely inactivated. the complete loss of its infectivity was observed only after 1 h of incubation at 65\u00b0C. the data presented in this figure are representative of three independent experiments, with each assay sample tested in duplicate. the error bars represent standard deviations and indicate the variations among the experiments. the virus retained about 80% of its original infectivity at pH 3.0. all other types of influenza viruses completely lost their infectivity at a pH of 3.0. ICV, evolutionarily and genetically close to IDV, also acquired appreciable resistance to more-acidic environments. /WSN/33) were replaced with the HEF segment of D/OK/11 (from swine) using the reverse genetic system (Fig. 2A) the stability and infectivity of the rescued A/D-HEF chimeric virus were examined and directly compared with its parental viruses. the chimera was able to survive and maintain its infectious titer after exposure to 53\u00b0C for up to 120 min. chimeric A/D-HEF virus was generated through cotransfection of 293T and MDCK cells with the chimeric HEF plasmid together with a/WSN/33-derived PA, PB1, PB2, NP (nucleoprotein), M (matrix), and NS (nonstructural) RGS plasmids. chimeric A/D-HEF was treated in solution at 53\u00b0C for different times, followed by incubation physicochemical stability has apparently not inhibited the ability of IDV to spread efficiently in global animal herds. this stability may give IDV additional advantage in surviving well in harsh environmental conditions, such as heat and low pH. the observation of viral HEF protein conferring exceptional resistance to high temperature and low pH raises several interesting questions about the entry pathway and biology of IDV. we speculate that low pH is required but not sufficient to trigger complete activation of the IDV fusion peptide. test model is that receptor binding may play a critical role in priming IDV fusion, a mechanism used by avian sarcoma and leucosis virus (ASLV) (19), jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (20) and hepatitis C virus (21)."}
