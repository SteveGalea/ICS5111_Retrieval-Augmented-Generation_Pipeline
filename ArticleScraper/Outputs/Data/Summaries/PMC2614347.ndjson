{"summary": "non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up approximately 80% of all lung cancer cases. tumor shrinkage in only 20% of patients and a two-year survival rate between 10% and 16%. lack of tumor specificity allows anti-cancer drugs to distribute indiscriminately to normal organs and tissues. liposomes can significantly reduce the volume of distribution and increase the concentration of active drug within the tumor. doxorubicin has been shown to significantly improve the therapeutic index of doxorubicin in preclinical [15]\u2013[17] and clinical studies [18]\u2013[21]. other than PEGylated liposomes, higher and more selective anti-cancer activity can be achieved. cell epitopes [32]\u2013[35] and receptor-ligand interactions [36] can also be used to identify organ- and cell-type-specific peptides [26], [27], [37]\u2013[39]. peptide libraries can also be used to identify organ- and cell-type-specific peptides [26], [27], [37]\u2013[39]. in vitro phage display screening was used to select peptides that bind to the NSCLC cell line CL1-5. FITC-labeled peptide SP5-2 bound to five NSCLC cell lines. PC5-2 was competitively inhibited by the synthetic peptide SP5-2. PC5-2 bound specifically to cells including CL1-5 and PC13. the control helper phage did not bind to CL1-5 cells. the binding activity of the PC5-2 phage to CL1-5 cells was inhibited. 42.6% of CL1-5 cells were bound by PC5-2. this binding was completely inhibited by 27 g/ml of SP5-2 peptide. PC5-2 did not bind to SAS or NNM. SP5-2 (TDSILRSYDWTY) competed with PC5-2 for binding to surgical specimens of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. the same concentration of a mutated peptide, MP5-2 (TDSILRSYDGGG) did not. the phage was localized on tumor tissues (d and e) no localization was observed in normal organs such as the brain (a), heart (b), and lungs (c), or in the tissue sections treated with the control phage (f\u2013i). the interaction of PC5-2 with the tumor section was inhibited by synthetic peptide SP5-2 (j) SCID mice bearing NSCLC xenografts were injected with PC5-2. we then removed and fixed the tumor and control organs. PC5-2 localized in tumor tissues. the tumor sizes in the LD and MP5-2-LD groups were 2.1 and 2.6 times larger than those in the SP5-2-LD group. the tumor sizes in the FD and control PBS groups were 7.0 and 8.3 times larger than that in the SP5-2-LD group. mice bearing large lung cancer xenografts were treated with SP5-2-LV, LV, or PBS (n = 6 in each group; **P0.01) survival curve showed longer lifespan of mice treated with SP5-2-LV than those treated with LV and PBS (n = 5 in each group). mice bearing large lung cancer xenografts were assigned to three treatment groups. doxorubicin at this concentration reduced the tumor size by only 14%. the body weight of the mice in this group increased by 10.3% (2.38 g) in contrast the LD-treated mice had a smaller increase in body weight of 2.4% (0.59 g) to further confirm SP5-2 could increase the therapeutic index for lung cancer. all five animals in the LV-treated group died (survival rate 0%) three mice died in the LV-treated group (survival rate 0%) in the LV-treated group, however, the survival rate was 80%, significantly higher than the other two groups. tumor doxorubicin concentration in the FD, LD, and MP5-2-LD groups was higher than in the FD, LD, and MP5-2-LD groups. the intra-tumor nuclear doxorubicin concentration in the SP5-2-LD group was 4.8-, 2.6- and 2.4-fold higher than the nuclear doxorubicin concentration. doxorubicin was visualized in the tumor nuclei one hour after SP5-2-LD was administered. the area with detectable doxorubicin was significantly larger in SP5-2-LD-treated tumors than that in FD, LD, and MP5-2-LD-treated tumors. the tumors had larger apoptotic areas and a lower density of tumor blood vessels in the SP5-2-LD-treated group than in the LD- and PBS-treated groups. the greater accumulation of anti-cancer drugs in tumor tissues and more bioavailable doxorubicin in cancer cell nuclei further demonstrated that the SP5-2 peptide recognized the target molecule on the surface of lung cancer cells. in vitro phage display screening was used to select peptides that bind to the NSCLC cell line CL1-5. FITC-labeled peptide SP5-2 bound to five NSCLC cell lines but not to NPC-TW01 cells. phage clones specifically binding to NSCLC cells are shown in boldface. the control helper phage did not bind to CL1-5 cells. PC5-2 bound neither to other cancer cell lines, including oral cancer. FITC-SP5-2 specifically bound to all of the NSCLC cell lines we tested, including CL1-5, H460, A549, PC13 and H23. PC5-2 did not bind to SAS or NNM (Fig. S2 e and f) SP5-2 (TDSILRSYDWTY) competed with PC5-2 for binding to surgical specimens of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. the same concentration of a mutated peptide, MP5-2 (TDSILRSYDGGG) did not. the phage was localized on tumor tissues (d and e) no localization was observed in normal organs such as the brain (a), heart (b), and lungs (c), or in tissue sections treated with the control phage (f\u2013i). the interaction of PC5-2 with the tumor section was inhibited by synthetic peptide SP5-2 (j) PC5-2 was found to localize in tumor tissues. there was no reaction product detected on normal organs. there was no reaction product detected on normal organs such as brain, heart and lung tissues. the tumor sizes in the LD and MP5-2-LD groups were 2.1 and 2.6 times larger than those in the SP5-2-LD group. the greater therapeutic efficacy of SP5-2-LD was lost when the WTY motif in the peptide had been changed to GGG in MP5-2-LD. CL1-5-derived lung cancer were treated with SP5-2-LV, LV, or PBS (n = 6 in each group; **P0.01) mice bearing large lung cancer xenografts were assigned to three treatment groups. doxorubicin was used to treat a different type of lung cancer xenograft (H460-derived tumor) the body weight of the mice in this group increased by 10.3% (2.38 g) at the end of the treatment period. in contrast, the LD-treated mice had a smaller increase in body weight of 2.4% (0.59 g) to further confirm SP5-2 could increase the therapeutic index for lung cancer. we linked the SP5-2 peptide to another anti-cancer drug, liposomal vinorelbine (SP5-2-LV) and tested its efficacy against lung cancer xeno three mice died in the LV-treated group (survival rate 40%) in the SP5-2-LV-treated group, however, the survival rate was 80%, significantly higher than the other two groups. these experiments demonstrate that SP5-2 increased the therapeutic efficiency of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin. doxorubicin concentration in tumor tissues (A) and nuclei of cancer cells (B) was higher than in FD, LD, and MP5-2-LD groups. the intra-tumor nuclear doxorubicin concentration in the SP5-2-LD group was 4.8-, 2.6- and 2.4-fold higher than the nuclear doxorubicin concentration in the LD and MP5-2-LD groups. doxorubicin was visualized in the tumor nuclei one hour after SP5-2-LD was administered. the areas with detectable doxorubicin were significantly larger in SP5-2-LD-treated tumors than that in FD, LD, and MP5-2-LD-treated tumors. the tumors had larger apoptotic areas and a lower density of tumor blood vessels in the SP5-2-LD-treated group than in the LD- and PBS-treated groups. the greater accumulation of anti-cancer drugs in tumor tissues and more bioavailable doxorubicin in cancer cell nuclei further demonstrated that the SP5-2 peptide recognized the target molecule on the surface of lung cancer cells. the binding activity of PC5-2 to tumor tissues was inhibited by the synthetic peptide SP5-2. PC5-2 interacted with NSCLC cells by its displayed peptide and not by another part of the phage particle. this phenomenon was observed in immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens. liposomal doxorubicin significantly changed the transportation and distribution of doxorubicin in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver in mice. this is in part a result of suboptimal doses within the tumor due to indiscriminate drug distribution throughout the body. this peptide markedly increased the therapeutic efficacy of liposomal chemotherapies. doxorubicin concentration was 1.9- and 2.1-fold higher than those in the LD and MP5-2-LD groups. the bioavailable drug in the nuclei of cancer cells in the SP5-2-LD was also 2.6- and 2.4-fold higher than those in the LD and MP5-2-LD groups. this peptide directly delivered the chemotherapeutic drug to intended targets. the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (NPC-TW01), an oral cancer cell line (SAS) and human normal nasal mucosal epithelial (NNM) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, CA, USA) at 37\u00b0C in a 10% CO2 incubator. identification of phage clones using cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Ninty-six-well ELISA plates were seeded with either cancer or control cells. individual phage particles were added to the cell-coated plates and incubated. the reaction was stopped and absorbance was measured at 490 nm using an ELISA reader. the cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, OR, USA) and mounted with a mounting solution. the cells were then examined under a leica universal microscope. the phages were injected along with 100 g synthetic targeting peptide, control peptide or mutant peptide. the organs and tumor masses were fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma, MO, USA) after fixation, the samples were embedded in paraffin blocks. doxorubicin was injected with liposomal doxorubicin (SP5-2-LD, MP5-2-LD, and LD) at a dose of 2 mg/kg. at selected time points, three mice in each group were anaesthetized and sacrificed. xenograft tumors and mouse organs were removed and homogenized. animal model for study of ligand-targeted therapy Mice 4\u20136 weeks of age were injected s.c. in the dorsolateral flank with human NSCLC cells. mice with size-matched tumors (approximately 50\u2013100 mm3) were randomly assigned to different treatment groups and injected with SP5-2-LD. tomato lectin conjugated to biotin was visualized with streptavidin-conjugated rhodamine (Pierce, IL, USA) the biotinylated lectin was visualized with streptavidin-conjugated rhodamine. CL1-5 cells were incubated with UV-treated inactive control helper phage. phage-displayed peptide library was then added. eluted phage pool was amplified and titered in an Escherichia coli ER2738 culture. synthetic targeting peptide SP5-2 (TDSILRSYDWTY), mutant peptide MP5-2 (TDSILRSYDGGG) and control peptide (RLLDTNRPLLPY) [27] were synthesized and purified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to >95% purity. peptides were plated and grown to about 80% confluence on cover slips. phages were mixed with synthetic targeting or mutant peptide. slides were subjected to routine immunohistochemical staining. phages were injected along with 100 g synthetic targeting peptide. doxorubicin and vinorelbine were encapsulated in liposomes. the peptide was coupled to a distearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine. the reaction was confirmed by quantitation of the remaining amino groups. rofluorometry at ex 485/20 nm and em 645/40 nm (Synergy HT Multi-Detection Microplate Reader, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT 05404 USA) to correct for background fluorescence, a standard curve was obtained by spiking tissue extracts from mice that did not receive doxorubicin. large tumors (approximately 500 mm3) were treated with SP5-2-LD for eight times (2 mg/kg, twice a week for four weeks) mice were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling reaction mixture (Roche Diagnostics) at 37\u00b0C for an hour. the binding of PC5-2 to CL1-5 cells (a, g, m) was inhibited by 3 g/ml (b, h, n), 9 g/ml (c, i, o) and 27 g/ml (d, j, p) of SP5-2 in a dose-dependent manner. the binding activity of PC5-2 to NSCLC cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. i.v. mice were injected with SP5-2-LD, MP5-2-LD, LD, and FD in a single dose of 2 mg/kg. doxorubicin concentration in blood was measured at selected time points. doxorubicin concentration was measured at selected time points.
