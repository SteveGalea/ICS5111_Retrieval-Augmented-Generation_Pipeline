{"summary": "17 adult patients were admitted to the emergency department of the national Taiwan University Hospital and met the clinical case definitions for probable SARS (15) the first day of fever was defined as day 1 of illness. all 17 cases with probable SARS in this study were confirmed by laboratory tests (15) the remaining 0.88 mL was collected as the cellular fraction of throat wash. aliquots of the saliva, to which an equal volume of 1 x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was also subjected to viral RNA extraction. RT-PCR conditions were 52\u00b0C for 40 min and 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 68\u00b0C for 45 s. the in vitro transcribed RNA was purified and quantified to determine the copy number of RNA as described previously (22). the sensitivity of the assay is 5 copies RNA per reaction, corresponding to 90 copies per milliliter throat wash. the sensitivity of the assay is 5 copies RNA per reaction, corresponding to 90 copies per milliliter throat wash. treatment of the mucus-cell pellet with N-acetyl-L-cysteine presumably released SARS-CoV from the mucus and increased the volume twofold. the copy numbers in the M component equal the amount in the treated supernatant (copies/mL) times 2 mL minus that from the originally untreated supernatant (1 mL) bSampling day 2 (d2) is the second day of fever. first antibody was serum from a rabbit immunized with the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV. the first day of fever was defined as day 1 of illness. all 17 cases with probable SARS in this study were confirmed by laboratory tests (15) aliquots of saliva, treated supernatant, and cellular fractions were subjected to viral RNA extraction. aliquot of saliva, to which an equal volume of 1 x phosphate-buffered saline was added, also subjected to viral RNA extraction. RT-PCR conditions were 52\u00b0C for 40 min and 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 68\u00b0C for 45 s. an aliquot (5 L) of RNA isolated from the clinical sample and known amounts of the in vitro transcribed RNA was subjected to real-time RT-PCR. the number of RNA copies per reaction was divided by 56 L (560 L x 5 L/50 L) and multiplied by 1,000. the sensitivity of the assay is 5 copies RNA per reaction, corresponding to 90 copies per milliliter throat wash. ysteine presumably released SARS-CoV from the mucus. the copy numbers in the M component equal the amount in the treated supernatant (copies/mL) times 2 mL. the copy numbers in the C component equal the amount in the cellular fraction (copies/mL) times the volume of the cell pellet (C = cellular fraction x volume of cell pellet [in mL]). 6 d4 14,400 (95.4) 695 (4.6) 7 d4 631,280 (99.9) 416 (0.1) 8 d4 19,900 (99.4) 124 (0.6) 9 d4 17,800 (99.5) 91 (0.5) 10 d5 40,500 (99.9) 60 (0.1) 11 d5 3,152,000 (99.2) 25,146 (0.8) 12 d6 1,896,000 (99.4) 12,160 (0.6) 13 d6 11, ed to a quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay by using the primers and probe within a highly conserved region of the ORF1b (20,21) a linear curve was observed as the input RNA increased from 5 to 50 million copies per reaction. positive signal was detected in the reactions containing RNA template derived from the SARS-CoV Taiwanese strain TW1 but not in those from 12 healthy controls. d No 3.56 x 103 NA 10 47 M d5 Yes No No Yes 8.10 x 103 9.24 x 104 11 52 M d5 Yes No Yes 2.46 x 105 6.38 x 108 13 48 F d6 Yes No No Yes 2.22 x 103 1.78 x 105 14 26 F d6 Yes No No Yes 9.73 x 102 9.52 x 103 15 21 F d7 Yes No No Yes 5.93 x 106 the amount of SARS-CoV RNA in the saliva was greater than that in the throat wash for every patient from whom both types of specimens were available. a linear relationship existed between the amounts of SARS-CoV in the saliva and throat wash. this suggests, but does not prove, that they could originate from a common source in the respiratory tract. oscopic studies have shown SARS-CoV particles in the desquamated cells from bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissues, both in the lower respiratory tract (6,8,24) our detection of SARS-CoV RNA in the cell-associated component of the throat wash suggested that SARS-CoV replicates in the upper respiratory tract. epithelial cells in throat wash from a healthy control (E) and two SARS patients, ID17 (C,D) and ID11 (F,G), were incubated with the preimmune (C,F) or postimmune (D,E,G) rabbit serum. the light microscopic picture of (G), taken with the fluorescent light on. findings support the possibility that SARS-CoV can be transmitted through oral droplets. a substantial proportion, 88.8 % to 99.9%, of the SARS-CoV in the throat wash was present in cell-free form. RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates from SARS patients had positive rates of 32% at day 3, 50% at day 5, and 68% at day 14 (8,14) the amounts of SARS-CoV RNA in the throat wash and saliva were in the same range as those previously reported for the nasopharyngeal specimens (7,14) a mutually nonexclusive possibility is that more respiratory secretions, mucus, and cells can be removed from the respiratory tract through throat wash than through nasopharyngeal aspiration. onset and duration of infectiveness, extent of infectiveness of some patients, such as superspreaders, and response to antiviral agents."}
