{"summary": "Hantaviruses are currently the most lethal human pathogenic viruses known to occur in America. hantaviruses have a tri-segmented single strand RNA genome of negative polarity packaged by the nucleoprotein into viral ribonucleocapsids. a lipid membrane anchors the viral ribonucleocapsids. viral fusion proteins insert a fusion peptide or fusion loop into a target membrane. at this intermediate stage, the fusion peptide is located at one end of the fusion protein. the opposite end is anchored to the viral envelope membrane by a transmembrane region. fusion culminates in the formation of a fusion pore through which the virus can deliver its ribonucleocapsids into the cell cytosol. ctodomain to the transmembrane anchor is thought to follow the movement of DIII by folding against the trimeric core formed by the fusion protein [37\u201339]. the extensive conformational changes that occur during the fusion process offer opportunities to disrupt the fusion cascade, thereby blocking viral infection. hantavirus Gc shares mechanistic similarity with class II fusion proteins. both, recombinant DIII and synthetic stem peptides, interfered with ANDV infection. pET28a gave rise to fusion proteins with an N-terminal tag of 34 residues including polyhistidine (His-tag) cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. 7 residues from the GST-fusion protein remained fused to the N-terminal of DIII, corresponding to the sequence GAMDPEF. expression of recombinant DIII proteins was performed as established before. GST moiety and the TEV protease were removed by sequential passage through glutathione-sepharose 4B and Ni-NTA (Qiagen) resins. Eventually, DIII was concentrated using an ultrafiltration device with 3 kDa cut-off. further purified on a HiLoad 16/60 superdex 200 prep grade column. NN peptide comprising the sequence QLVTARQKLKDAEKAVEVDPDDVNKSTLQRRAAVSTLETKLG was used as control. peptides R2 and R2.2 were soluble in HNE buffer (10 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl, 0,1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) cells were ted with ANDV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence and absence of protein or peptide inhibitor candidates. cells were then fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for virus inactivation, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. different dilutions of VSV-G pseudotyped SIV vectors were incubated for 1 h with Vero E6 cells in the presence and absence of protein or peptide inhibitor candidates. three days later, the expression of GFP in transduced cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. the mean fusion index of five fields was calculated (n = 3) for each sample, approximately 200 nuclei per field were counted (20x magnification), and the mean fusion index of five fields was calculated. ANDV infection mediated by virus-plasma membrane fusion cells were pre-chilled on ice for 10 min with 20 mM NH4Cl. the presence of Gc in each fraction was assessed by western blot analysis using anti-Gc mAb 2H4/F6. the molecular mass of each fraction was assessed by the coomassie staining of a molecular marker. the experimental molecular mass of the marker was next plotted against the log of its theoretical molecular mass in the panel above the western blots of the gradient. with 40 M 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (CellTracker Blue CMAC, Invitrogen) in supplemented 12-K medium for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. the excess dye was then removed by replacing the dye-containing media with supplemented DMEM. after 30 min of incubation the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. the fluorescent label was detected at the full circumference of the cells. the standard deviation of at least n = 3 experiments was calculated. a Student s t-test was performed for statistical evaluation. fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (E.coli) BL21. they were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, pH 8. soluble proteins were purified through ion exchange resin Bio-Rex 70. the proteins were heated to 95\u00b0C for 3 min, and alkylated by incubation with 24 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. ellipticity per amino acid residue was converted into ellipticity per amino acid residue. NN peptide of 42 residues was used as control of both short R peptides and longer DIII fragments. all peptides were soluble in HNE buffer (10 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl, 0,1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) 10.000 cells of each condition were incubated for 45 min with anti-ANDV N monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7B3/F6 [58] then the primary antibody was detected with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to Alexa 555 (Life Technologies) 10.000 cells of each condition were analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACS CAN II, Becton Dickinson). cells were incubated with vero E6 cells for 18 h at 37\u00b0C. the conversion of tetrazolium to formazan was assessed. cell-cell fusion assay was performed as established before. ANDV infection mediated by virus-plasma membrane fusion cells were pre-chilled on ice for 10 min with 20 mM NH4Cl. adsorption of ANDV (MOI = 0.2) was performed at 4\u00b0C for 1h. cells were washed, and infection was followed by incubation for 16 h. the experimental molecular mass of the marker was plotted against the log of its theoretical molecular mass in the panel above the western blots of the gradient. well-characterized VLPs projecting ANDV glycoproteins were prepared as described elsewhere, and were incubated for 30 min at pH 5.5. effector cells (transfected 293FT cells) and target cells (CHO-K1 cells) were combined in a ratio of 1:4 (effector:target) for 3 h. then, the fusion protein was activated by incubating the cells in low pH media for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. after 30 min of incubation the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. sequence alignments were used to identify a putative DIII in ANDV Gc. the sequence was termed ANDV DIII, and served as template to predict a putative DIII in Gc of other hantaviruses such as PUUV. sequence conservation at each position is represented by the overall height of the stack. acid residues are indicated in red, basic residues in blue, apolar residues in black and polar residues in green. hantaviruses harbored in shrews, moles and bats from the families. fusion proteins, including those of flavi- and alphaviruses, have been previously established in E. coli [52, 67\u201371]. the feasibility of preparing DIII from flavi- and alphaviruses in a prokaryotic expression system may be related to its globular IgG-like fold and lack of glycosylation. circular dichroism spectra showed a unique negative maximum at 209 nm. the spectra was acquired from 5 scans between 190 and 260 nm. the spectrum was acquired from 5 scans between 190 and 260 nm. PUUV hDIII did not show any cross-inhibition of ANDV. the absence of cross-inhibition was due to the presence of the N-terminal His-tag in PUUV DIII. transduction was assessed by GFP reporter gene expression using flow cytometry. 100% transduction defined as transduction in the absence of Gc-derived fragments (Mock) part of the predicted Gc stem region blocked the infection of cells by ANDV up to 55% at 20 M. in contrast, the R1 peptide spanning the N-terminal part of the predicted Gc stem did not show any reduction of ANDV infection. to further explore the specificity of the Gc fragments on viral inhibition, we used as a model. s and recombinant domains abrogated the viability of cells when they were incubated with vero E6 cells. it was previously reported that flavivirus stem peptides bind to ANDV before it enters the cell, helping its delivery into endosomal compartments. a similar dose-dependent inhibition could be observed. ANDV DIII and ANDV hDIII diminished the glycoprotein-mediated fusion activity by 70% at 25 M and 50 M respectively. cross-inhibition of hantaviruses by exogenous DIII and stem fragments. PUUV hDIII blocked the PUUV glycoprotein-mediated fusion process. hantavirus cross-inhibition results suggest residues in DIII and stem fragments are involved in intramolecular interactions. exogenous DIII and stem fragments block fusion process ANDV cell entry can be blocked at different steps such as receptor binding and membrane fusion. exogenous DIII and stem fragments block the virus-cell membrane fusion process. incubation for 1 h of vero E6 cells with exogenous DIII and stem fragments at 10 and 20 M, followed by washing and subsequent inoculation with ANDV. fusion process involves multiple steps, we next assessed at which specific stage the Gc fragments interfere in this process. ANDV was therefore incubated at neutral or low pH with or without DIII. ANDV VLPs were incubated at the indicated pH and DIII (6 M) or R2 (20 M) added before or after acidification. the trypsin resistance of Gc was quantified by densitometry. some residual Gc could be detected, most likely because the DIII or stem fragments did not block all Gc molecules. the formation of a stable homotrimer was however not prevented when the control peptide NN was added before acidification. confocal microscopy allows unambiguous identification of GM1 transfer from effector cells to target cells. CHO-K1 cells were only defined as GM1+ when the label was detected on their full circumference. target cells in contact with effector cells, but showing only partial or no GM1 stain, were defined as GM1-. exogenous DIII and stem fragments block a fusion stage preceding the mixing of outer membrane leaflets. CHO-K1 cells were stained with CMAC (blue fluorescence) and GM1+ cells were labeled with the cholera toxin -subunit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence) we used the alignment from the original ANDV Gc model [23] to identify a putative DIII in ANDV Gc. we subsequently defined the putative stem region in ANDV Gc as the sequence encompassing residues Leu414-Asn456, which correspond to the region between the C-terminal end of the predicted DIII and the predicted Gc transmembrane region. sequence conservation at each position is represented by the overall height of the stack. acid residues are indicated in red, basic residues in blue, apolar residues in black and polar residues in green. hantaviruses harbored in shrews, moles and bats from the families. soluble DIII from flavi- and alphaviruses is purified from inclusion bodies. the proteins were obtained from the supernatant of E. coli BL21 or Origami 2(DE3) cells. they were eluted after their purification as a single peak detected by absorbance at 280 nm. circular dichroism spectra into four components by different servers [54\u201356] indicated that DIII contained 40\u201341% -sheets, 60% random coils and turns with an -helical content close to zero. this composition coincides with the high content of -sheets and turns observed in DIII of class II fusion proteins. ANDV was incubated with vero E6 cells in the presence of the Gc fragments. after 1 h incubation, the cells were washed and the infection monitored. PUUV hDIII did not show any cross-inhibition of ANDV. the absence of cross-inhibition was due to the presence of the N-terminal His-tag in PUUV DIII. transduction was assessed by GFP reporter gene expression using flow cytometry. 100% transduction defined as transduction in the absence of Gc-derived fragments. peptide spanning the N-terminal part of the predicted Gc stem did not show any reduction of ANDV infection. to further explore the specificity of the Gc fragments on viral inhibition, we used the unrelated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) flavivirus stem peptides bind to ANDV before it enters the cell. a similar dose-dependent inhibition could be observed. a similar dose-dependent inhibition could be observed. PUUV hDIII did not achieve cross-inhibition of ANDV glycoproteins. the ANDV R2 stem peptides impaired the ANDV glycoprotein fusion activity. cross-inhibition of hantaviruses by exogenous DIII and stem fragments. the R2.1 peptide reached the highest cross-reduction result of 70% at 20 M. this peptide also achieved the highest inhibition value of ANDV-mediated cell-cell fusion. residues in DIII and stem fragments are involved in intramolecular interactions. exogenous DIII and stem fragments were added during the 5 min low pH incubation step. we assessed inhibition in a fusion infection assay, fusing ANDV with the plasma membrane. ANDV was incubated at neutral or low pH with or without DIII. the viral glycoproteins were extracted from the virus and applied to a sucrose gradient (7\u201315%) to evaluate their molecular mass. ANDV VLPs were incubated at the indicated pH and DIII (6 M) or R2 (20 M) added before or after acidification. the digestion of Gc was assessed by western blot analysis. exogenous DIII and stem fragments interfered in the formation of a stable Gc homotrimer. the formation of a stable homotrimer was not prevented when the control peptide NN was added before acidification, nor when the NN peptide, DIII or the R2 peptide was added after the low pH incubation. CHO-K1 cells were defined as GM1+ when the label was detected on their full circumference (Fig 7A, red arrows) target cells in contact with effector cells showed only partial or no GM1 stain. but this assay does not discriminate between full fusion and hemifusion of membranes. exogenous DIII and stem fragments block a fusion stage preceding the mixing of outer membrane leaflets. CHO-K1 cells were stained with CMAC (blue fluorescence) and GM1+ cells were labeled with cholera toxin -subunit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence) ANDV and PUUV hantaviruses were blocked by ANDV DIII without additional N-terminal His-tag or C-terminal residues. the addition of an N-terminal His-tag achieved a 100-fold improvement in blocking fusion of semliki forest virus. 1 peptide spanning the first 17 N-terminal residues of the 44-residue stem region did not affect ANDV entry. the R2 peptide appears to contain residues in these two regions that participate similarly during inhibition. a need for such a membrane-binding property for inhibitory activity coincides with studies on peptides derived from the stem region of alphavirus fusion proteins. stem peptides of the DV2 E protein have been shown to interfere with the fusion of the virus in the endosomal compartment by a two-step mechanism. if the ANDV R2 peptide would interact with membranes by a hydropathy segment, such an interaction did not favor ANDV inhibition sufficiently in the endosomal route. modifications to the R2 peptide that favor membrane interaction may help in the future to improve its inhibitory activity and to direct it towards the closed environment of peptides derived from the stem region of ANDV cross-inhibited the PUUV fusion activity. it is likely that the histidines of the tag become positively charged in the low pH environment. repulsion may be overcome by a higher binding affinity of DIII to Gc from the same hantavirus, but not to heterologous viruses. strategies employed against class II fusion proteins allow for the inhibition of hantaviruses such as ANDV and PUUV. the novel inhibitory strategy based on ANDV DIII and stem peptides will help in the future development of therapeutic strategies against different hantaviruses."}
