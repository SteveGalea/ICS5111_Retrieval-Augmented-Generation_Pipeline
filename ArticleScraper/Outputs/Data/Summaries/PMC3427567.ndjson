{"summary": "the majority of human EIDs are zoonotic\u2014originating especially from wildlife reservoirs. emerging diseases pose unprecedented challenges to the global health of people, animals and ecosystems. the risk is not uniform: 53 per cent of global outbreaks from 1996 to 2009 were in Africa. bats are associated with zoonoses of potentially great global public health impact. they are the source of lyssa viruses [11], Hendra virus [12], Nipah virus [13], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [14,15], and Ebola and Marburg viruses [16\u201319]. RNA viruses associated with old world fruit bats pose zoonotic disease threats of high public health significance internationally. new metagenomic studies of viral abundance and diversity in bats have demonstrated the amazing breadth and diversity of microbial populations in different species of bat and microbe. outbreaks or cases of encephalitis caused by henipaviruses have been confirmed in Australia, Southeast Asia and South Asia. this distribution of outbreaks was expected as henipaviruses were thought to be confined to Australasia, southern Asia and Madagascar [28,30] this distribution of outbreaks was expected as henipaviruses were thought to be confined to australasia, southern Asia and Madagascar [28,30] cultural contingencies, life experiences, intellectual paradigms and political agendas are often highly influential in shaping how science or policy is conceptualized. 'blinkers' limit the possibilities to recognize multiple perspectives, seek more participatory solutions or question the assumptions on which decisions get made. this combination of disciplines needs to be carefully integrated in a manner that has not really been achieved for the study of any disease, let alone a wildlife-associated zoonosis. there is a clear need to integrate interdisciplinary research and policy, and to work across wildlife, veterinary and public health sectors, to develop approaches and interventions. a conceptual framework for the study of wildlife derived zoonoses, focused on bat infections. in figure 1, the central rectangle portrays the inter-linked spectrum of dynamics involved in zoonotic spillover and disease emergence. the framework also captures how intermediate hosts, such as livestock, can play key bridging roles in such spillover events. a range of local influences and practices, both social and environmental, can shape bat ecology and populations. the interactions between bats and ecosystems are manifold; through seed dispersal and pollination, bat populations also influence ecological structure and functioning. the public perception of bats and bat diseases can trigger eradication efforts that may then increase spillover risks. research themes There are a number of ways that specific research themes could be developed within our proposed conceptual framework. thematic approach is critically important as it allows intra-disciplinary study, vital for ensuring impactful and relevant publications, each testing specific hypotheses. the same themes can cross geographical divides, providing integration on that scale. yptiacus are the most widespread and possibly the most abundant fruit bats. yptiacus roosts in trees in urban settings, whereas R. aegyptiacus roosts predominantly in caves and in more rural areas. in west africa, pteropodid fruit bats appear to be very large. the ecology and distributions of fruit bats in many countries in which spillover may occur are not very well characterized, particularly quantitatively. the study of zoonotic pathogens has stimulated the study of a number of species, including Pteropus giganteus [70] and Pteropus vampyrus [71] in india, Malaysia and Bangladesh and E. helvum in Ghana. studies can enable detection of temporary stopover roosts. identification of feeding sites can facilitate the determination of interactions with other wildlife species (especially other species of bat) and with livestock and humans. pathogen dynamics must be surveyed longitudinally in bat populations. the importance of longitudinal data from carefully selected bat populations at sufficiently frequent intervals cannot be overemphasized. these investigations should be conducted in parallel with serological, virological and epidemiological studies in relevant human and domestic animal populations to determine the occurrence of spillover. research should critically explore people's perceptions and practices in interacting with bats [95], perhaps drawing inspiration from recent anthropological theorizing on human\u2013animal interactions [96\u201399], considering livelihood trajectories [100], gendered strategies [101] and differential access to resources and decision-making. thematic research should be grounded in ecological anthropology, political ecology and livelihood approaches [79]. the obvious epidemiological and public health approaches must be integrated with anthropological perspectives that emphasize how prevailing social and cultural values influence disease classifications and diagnoses. critical medical anthropology has directed the attention towards the social and political determinants of ill health, disease distribution and access to health care. people's attitudes to past disease surveillance measures and health education initiatives should be elicited. beliefs about bat-associated diseases on the part of health care workers need to be recorded alongside observation of clinic culture and diagnostic practices. the importance of this was exemplified in Bangladesh, where bats were rejected as a source of Nipah virus in favour of superstitious causes. empirical models can quantify impact of different spatial drivers on risk of initial spillover and subsequent spread. on the basis of time series analyses, risk maps could be generated that predict spatio-temporally changing \u2018hot zones\u2019 for spillover, thus contributing to forecasting. work here should explore broader interpretations and representations\u2014framings\u2014held by a wide range of different interested parties. thematic work could be particularly influential for policy-related work that might follow. thematic work could be particularly influential for policy-related work that might follow. lvum often roosts in trees in urban settings, whereas R. aegyptiacus roosts predominantly in caves and in more rural areas. some individuals have been shown to migrate over 2500 km [58], but not all individuals migrate. in west africa, E. helvum colonies appear to be very large (with roosts of more than one million individuals) the ecology and distributions of fruit bats in many countries in which spillover may occur are not very well characterized, particularly quantitatively. the study of zoonotic pathogens has stimulated the study of a number of species, including Pteropus giganteus [70] and Pteropus vampyrus [71] in india, Malaysia and Bangladesh and E. helvum in Ghana. studies tracking movement patterns can enable detection of temporary stopover roosts and allow resource availability to be linked to movement, reproduction and local bat population size. the development of mathematical models is a critical foundation of this theme [44,45,47,49] pathogen dynamics must be surveyed longitudinally in bat populations, using appropriate (for the pathogen) suite of serological and virological techniques. the importance of longitudinal data from carefully selected bat populations at sufficiently frequent intervals cannot be overemphasized. these investigations should be conducted in parallel with serological, virological and epidemiological studies in relevant human and domestic animal populations. research should critically explore people's perceptions and practices in interacting with bats [95], perhaps drawing inspiration from recent anthropological theorizing on the social character of human\u2013animal interactions. understanding material interactions with bats, the presence of bats within local belief systems and folklore, attitudes and responses to the existence of bats near dwellings and domestic animals, and differential access to resources and decision-making. critical medical anthropology has directed the attention towards the social and political determinants of ill health, disease distribution and access to health care. the obvious epidemiological and public health approaches must be integrated with anthropological perspectives that emphasize how prevailing social and cultural values, legal, political and economic factors and organizational norms influence disease classifications and diagnoses. beliefs about bat-associated diseases need to be recorded alongside observation of clinic culture and diagnostic practices. the importance of this was exemplified in Bangladesh, where bats were rejected as a source of Nipah virus in favour of superstitious causes. the immediate reaction to this knowledge is often to want to get rid of the bats, but there are interrelated livelihood challenges, value system and cultural challenges and ecological challenges. empirical models can quantify impact of different spatial drivers on risk of initial spillover and subsequent spread. risk maps could be generated that predict spatio-temporally changing \u2018hot zones\u2019 for spillover, thus contributing to forecasting. work here should explore broader interpretations and representations\u2014framings\u2014held by a wide range of different interested parties (often termed \u2018actors\u2019 in the social sciences) data from these studies need to be analysed systematically through qualitative techniques to identify key framing elements and clusters. this work could be particularly influential for policy-related work that might follow. there will often be strong demand for such work among potential users and beneficiaries. nationally, they would include governments addressing human health (e.g. WHO), animal health (e.g. FAO, OIE), biodiversity (e.g. IPBES, CBD, CMS, TEEB) and bats. inter-disciplinary approaches are vital, but do not remove the importance of more reductionist studies. holistic, integrated and interdisciplinary studies could produce a step change in our understanding of how best to deal with the complex issues surrounding disease emergence."}
