{"summary": "the discovery of antivirals with high efficacy, low cost, and low cytotoxicity is a long-pursued goal in drug discovery. the marine environment is a wealthy source of biological and chemical diversity of natural antivirals. the investigation of natural antivirals isolated from marine sources is an interesting approach in the development of new antiviral agents. the main goal of this research was to discover new candidates of antiviral drugs with a low cytotoxicity and affordable cost of production that could help control viral infection diseases. five species of Mexican macroalgae were used in this study, three from Baja California (Macrocystis pyrifera, Ecklonia arborea), and Silvetia compressa (formerly Pelvetia compressa) polyphenol-Rich extracts Isolation was performed according to Xi et al. [14] with few modifications. 10 g of alga powder was washed with distillated water and dried at room temperature overnight. samples were centrifuged for 15 min (2500 rpm) en, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum FBS. 1% (v/v) antibiotic (Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) PPs against MeV were evaluated by syncytia reduction assays. vero cells seeded in 12-well plates were treated with different concentrations of PPs (0.01\u20135 g/mL) at the same time for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, allowing the virus to adsorb. each treatment was tested in triplicate and each experiment was performed at least in triplicate. PPs with the best SI were selected for the following experiments. real-time PCR was carried out using SensiFASTTM SYBR\u00ae No-ROX Kit (BIOLINE, TN, USA) and the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) the number of viral copies was calculated using a standard curve (reference) and results were expressed as a percentage of total number of viral copies observed in viral control monolayers. PPs (5 g/mL) were added at different times of infection. PPs (5 g/mL) were added at different times of infection. after incubation period of 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. incubation period cells were treated with 40 mM citrate buffer. buffer replaced by DMEM and monolayers were stained with 1% crystal violet. characterization of polyphenol-rich extracts was carried out using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) the gradient used to separate Solieria filiformis extract was: 100% A at 0 min, 90% A and 10% B at 3.5 min, 50% A and 50% B at 2 min, 25% A and 75% B at 5 min, and 100% B at 7\u201320 min. CC50 and IC50 values at 48 h were determined by Probit regression analysis. two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey analysis were performed when comparing different techniques. polyphenol-Rich extracts Isolation was performed according to Xi et al. [14] with few modifications. 10 g of alga powder was washed with distillated water and dried overnight. samples were centrifuged for 15 min (2500 rpm) one green seaweed from southern Baja California (Ulva intestinalis) and one red seaweed from Yucatan (Solieria filiformis) the green alga Ulva intestinalis (Linnaeus) was collected from the water drainage channel of the Gran Mar shrimp farm. the samples were centrifuged for 15 min (2500 rpm) the supernatant was recovered and added with 96% ethanol for residual polysaccharides precipitation. the ethanol of the supernatant was evaporated at 55\u00b0 in a rotary evaporator and the water was eliminated by freeze drying. the cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 1.5 104 cells/well at 37 \u00b0C in and 5% CO2. after 48 h of incubation the media were replaced with MTT solution. the optical density (OD450 nm) was measured using a microplate reader. the results were expressed as a percentage of total syncytia observed in viral control monolayers (untreated cultures) the IC50 was determined from dose-response curves and the selectivity index (SI) values were calculated as CC50/IC50. each combination was tested on its corresponding IC25 and IC50 using syncytia reduction assays. the synergistic effect of combinations was calculated by using the CompuSyn software which calculates a combination index (CI) described by Chou [15] variables were performed in triplicate for each experiment and repeated at least three times (N = 9). PPs (5 g/mL) were added at different times of infection: 60 min before infection and 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after infection. total phenolic content (TPC) was measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. the polyphenol-rich extracts were prepared in methanol, with a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile with 3% Acetic Acid (solvent A), water with 3% Acetic Acid (solvent B). the gradient used to separate Solieria filiformis extract was: 100% A at 0 min, 90% A and 10% B at 3.5 min, 50% A and 50% B at 2 min, 25% A and 75% B at 5 min, and 100% B at 10\u201320 min. ribavirin showed a CC50 of 405 g/mL. PPs of Ecklonia (formerly Eisenia) and Solieria showed the best SI values. results were consistent with those observed by Syncytia reduction assays. PPs were tested at 5 g/mL by syncytia reduction and qPCR assays. PPs were tested at 5 g/mL by syncytia reduction and qPCR assays. each bar represents the average of three replicates. IC50 of Ecklonia arborea (formerly Eisenia) PPs and IC25 of Solieria filiformis SPS combination (PPE50/SPS25) showed the best synergistic effect. by contrast, Table 3 indicates the combined effect of PPs with ribavirin.

PPs of Solieria filiformis and Ecklonia arborea PPs with ribavirin showed antagonic effect. virucidal activity of PPs of Solieria filiformis and Ecklonia arborea was tested. the best inhibitory effect was observed when performing the virucidal test. the total phenolic content test confirmed that both extracts are rich in phenolic compounds. HPLC and mass analysis allowed us to identify potential natural compounds that may be playing an important role in the antiviral activity of the extract. formerly Eisenia bicilys was reported to have a Selectivity index of 668.87 [31] against murine norovirus. this is the first report of the virucidal effect of seaweeds polyphenols."}
