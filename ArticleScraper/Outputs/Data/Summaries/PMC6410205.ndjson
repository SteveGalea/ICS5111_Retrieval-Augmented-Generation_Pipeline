{"summary": "the interest in bat research has increased because of the range of viruses that they harbor. there is direct evidence that viruses have spilled over from bats to other vertebrates. for example, Nipah virus spilled over from bats to humans and pigs leading to outbreaks in Southeast Asia and Hendra virus continues to spillover into horses and humans in Australia. bats have an efficient and varied antiviral response. bats have an efficient and varied antiviral response. bats have an efficient and varied antiviral response. the immune response has two primary components, innate and adaptive. the host initially responds to infection by activating innate mechanisms. there are mutations in the coding sequence of p53 functional domains that are unique to these bats. an antiviral effector 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease (RNase-L) is a unique downstream ISG gene. the activated RNase-L can then cleave viral mRNA. in human cells, RNase-L is not directly stimulated by interferon. in vivo experiments with Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) many bats have a mechanism to suppress the expression of TNF. this suggests that many bats have a mechanism to suppress the expression of TNF, thereby maintaining a balanced response to viral infection. a mutation at a highly conserved serine residue in one of the key adaptor molecules for sensing damaged DNA. evolution of tolerance to DNA damage and unique antiviral immune response in bats. evolution of flight necessitated evolution of bats with ability to modulate consequences of increased metabolic activity by suppressing inflammation. increased susceptibility of cells to virus replication compensated by more effective antiviral measures. the increased rate of metabolism accompanying flight would lead to higher levels of oxygen-free radicals. this would also explain why bats of certain species live longer than expected. in bats the evolutionary suppression of inflammation is counteracted by constitutive expression of innate immune genes. asymptomatic infections have been observed in bats for human pathogens such as henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra viruses), coronaviruses (MERS-CoV) and filoviruses (Marburg virus and ebolaviruses) experimentally inoculated bats were able to transmit the virus to other contact bats. despite the lack of detectable virus, even four months after initial infection, experimentally inoculated bats were able to transmit the virus to other contact bats. a bat coronavirus was also shown to persistently infect North American little brown bats. prolonged infectious periods or latent infection of bats are required to explain persistence of henipavirus in small populations. this estimate is considerably longer than the current estimates of the detectable infectious period for henipaviruses in fruit bats, which is approximately 7 days. studies on murine gammaherpesvirus-68 in mice have shown that latent gammaherpesviruses are sequestered in cells in the spleen and can be reactivated by stress. stressors, such as unfolded protein responses and hypoxia, can induce the expression of viral immediate early genes that help in initiating the lytic cycle of virus. study looked at effects of white-nose syndrome fungus on a persistently infecting coronavirus. the intestines of the fungus-infected bats showed a gene expression profile suggesting suppression of the innate antiviral response. this suggests secondary infections in bats persistently infected with viruses could increase the potential of viral shedding. codon usage is an interspecies bias where one codon is selected over other synonymous codons in a particular species [65]. natural selection for viral variants works by selecting codons matching host tRNA abundance. it also selects variants with the advantage of not activating innate response genes, such as those for toll-like receptor 9. immune systems and factors leading to an increase in viral replication might help us understand viral spillovers."}
