{"summary": "microbial agents that have the potential to cause disease can be detected in clinical samples on the basis of their specific nucleotide sequence. the rapidly increasing breadth and scope of microbial sequence reference databases in the research community have also facilitated the identification of novel microorganisms. despite the broad utility of NGS in pathogen discovery, the technique is associated with a high risk of inadvertent contamination (16\u201318) the parvovirus-like hybrid virus was detected in samples from patients with chronic seronegative (non-A-E) hepatitis and diarrhea of unknown etiology. the initial finding of a novel parvovirus-/circovirus-like agent in these patients was of great interest because these viruses are known to broadly infect insects, vertebrate animals, and humans. a total of 169 serum samples from a clinical study of patients with seronegative hepatitis were collected and processed at 3 different time points. in february 2012, 64 samples, including 22 previously processed samples, were combined in pools of 4, passed through a 0.22-m filter (Millipore), and pretreated with nucleases. 105 samples were processed similarly to those processed in february 2012. the remaining 105 samples were processed similarly to those processed in february 2012. libraries were prepared using an Eppendorf epMotion 5075 BioRobot. viral NA was isolated using the QIAamp viral-RNA kit (Qiagen) and 4 libraries were prepared using the ScriptSeq V2 RNA-Seq kit (Epicentre) all 88 individual samples were re-extracted following nuclease pretreatment using the EZ1 viral minikit (Qiagen), and libraries were prepared using an epMotion 5075 BioRobot. additional clinical samples screened for PHV include diarrheic stool samples from Mexico (40), Naegleria fowleri cultures (41), baboon adenovirus cultures (42), baboon adenovirus cultures (42), prostate cancer tissue (20), a hemorrhagic fever serum sample (13), human feces samples from Pakistan (37), and live-attenuated vaccines (8). the water was eluted through at least three spin columns prior to PHV detection by PCR. five fecal specimens from the diarrheal stool samples from Nigeria and five nuclease-free water samples were also re-extracted in parallel using the QIAamp viral-RNA minikit. all computationally subtracted reads were realigned to a targeted database of parvovirus proteins in GenBank using BLASTx. putative parvovirus reads were then inputted as \u201cseeds\u201d into the PRICE de novo assembler (43), requiring at least 85% identity over 25 nucleotides to merge two fragments. BLASTn alignment at a cutoff of 1030 and mapping to the PHV-1 genome. the consensus sequence was determined in Geneious by selection of the majority base at each nucleotide position. multiple sequence alignments including PHV-1, PHV-2, and NIH-CQV were then performed using MAFFT. all clinical samples were analyzed under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards of University of California, San Francisco. written informed consent was previously obtained for patients in non-A-E hepatitis cohort 1 (University of Chicago), non-A-E hepatitis cohort 2 (BIOLINCC Transfusion-transmitted Viruses Study) and the California Encephalitis Project (35). in July 2010, 22 samples were extracted using the QIAamp UltraSens virus kit (Qiagen) and Illumina TruSeq-adapted libraries were constructed as described previously (13). in february 2012, 64 samples, including the 22 previously processed samples, were combined in pools of 4, passed through a 0.22-m filter (Millipore) and pretreated with nucleases as described previously (36). prenuclease treatment, NAs were extracted using the QIAamp viral-RNA minikit (Qiagen) libraries were then prepared using the ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq and run on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. 88 serum samples from the transfusion-transmitted Virus Study (TTVS) were obtained from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute BioLINCC database. samples from patients with encephalitis were processed using the QIAamp viral-RNA minikit (Qiagen) samples were processed using the QIAamp viral-RNA minikit (Qiagen) and TruSeq-adapted libraries were generated as described above. nuclease-free water was eluted through three spin columns prior to PHV detection by PCR. five fecal specimens from the diarrheal stool samples from Nigeria and five nuclease-free water samples were also re-extracted in parallel using the QIAamp viral-RNA minikit (Qiagen) and the MagMax viral-RNA isolation kit (Ambion) raw reads from non-A-E hepatitis serum cohort 1, pool A (PHV-1), diarrheic stool from Nigeria, pool E (PHV-2) and extracted water (PHV-3) were preprocessed. all computationally subtracted reads were realigned to a targeted database of parvovirus proteins in GenBank using BLASTx at an E-score cutoff of 102. publicly available environmental metagenomic data sets were also screened by BLASTn alignment for PHV reads at an E-score cutoff of 1030. coverage maps for other PHV strains were generated by BLASTn alignment at a cutoff of 1030 and mapping to their respective genomes using Geneious version 6.1.2. s of all 12 PHV strains described in this study have been deposited in GenBank as PHV strains UC1 to UC12. the data sets from which PHV-1, PHV-2, and PHV-3 were assembled were filtered for removal of human reads and deposited into the GenBank Sequence Read Archive. the read was selected as a seed for de novo assembly using the PRICE assembler (43), which generated a complete viral genome within 9 cycles. the virus was provisionally named parvovirus-like hybrid virus (PHV), and the initial detected strain from the seronegative hepatitis pool was designated PHV-1. de novo assembled a viral genome from NGS data corresponding to diarrheal stool samples from Nigeria. nucleic acid extractions from these samples were also performed using the QIAamp viral-RNA minikit. the assembled viral genome was found to be 3,636 bp long. 794) and 50% of the sequence shared 23% amino acid identity to porcine circovirus-like (Po-Circo-like) virus 21 (ACK86566.1) only 31% translated amino acid identity over 17% of the gene to the corresponding capsid gene in goose parvovirus (ACK86566.1) individual samples corresponding to pool from which PHV-1 genome was initially assembled were re-extracted using a magnetic-bead-based NA extraction method. PCR of the NA extracted using the QIAamp viral-RNA minikit successfully detected PHV in all of the tested samples. reads aligning to PHV were detected in non-A-E hepatitis serum cohort 1. the percentage of total reads per pool was remarkably similar. PHV sequences were identified in multiple additional data sets from laboratories 1 and 2. PHV-3 reads mapped to PHV-1 spanned 97% of the genome at 69 coverage. average coverage obtained from representative sample pools was >150. all assembled viral genomes were remarkably similar (Fig. 5A, arrow) PHV reads only in metagenomic data sets corresponding to clinical samples extracted using Qiagen spin columns. the detection of PHV reads only in metagenomic data sets. a subset of PCR amplicons were confirmed to be >99% identical to PHV-1. environmental metagenomic sequence data sets in CAMERA and MG-RAST (47) databases were scanned for evidence of PHV-related sequences using BLASTn alignments at a high-level. 78 public data sets containing 213,615,095 sequence reads were analyzed. included 8,063,303 reads from vertebrate metagenomes, 395,038 reads from plant metagenomes, 14,922,577 reads from sediment sewage and soil metagenomes, and 189,242,666 reads from marine metagenomes. both data sets corresponded to metagenomic shotgun sequencing of sampled seawater off the Pacific coast of north America iologies for undiagnosed cases of seronegative non-A-E hepatitis were prepared from sera collected from a patient cohort of non-A-E hepatitis in the united states. nucleic acids (NA) were extracted using the QIAamp viral-RNA minikit (Qiagen) analysis revealed multiple divergent sequence reads with homology to parvoviruses. de novo assembly of the viral genome was performed in 16 cycles from a single 100-bp read with 38% amino acid identity to Acheta domestica densovirus. the whole-genome sequences of PHV-1 and PHV-2 shared 99% nucleotide and amino acid identity with each other. genome of PHV-1 was found to be 3,636 bp long, with 3 open reading frames (ORFs) and 148-nt terminal repeats at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends. replicase gene exhibited remote homology to circoviruses. capsid gene was highly divergent, with only 31% translated amino acid identity over 17% of the gene to the corresponding capsid gene in goose parvovirus. inverse PCR failed to detect evidence of a circular form for PHV. PHV and NIH-CQV are situated on a deep independent branch. the closest relative to PHV and NIH-CQV is Po-Circo-like virus 21. failure to detect PHV in re-extracted clinical samples raised the likelihood of contamination. sequences were identified by BLASTn alignments at an E-score cutoff of 1030. the bar graphs show the percentage of PHV reads in each data set. clinical sample sets extracted using Qiagen spin columns are highlighted using red text; those extracted using other methods are shown in black. overlapping samples from non-A-E hepatitis serum cohorts 1 and 2 were extracted using two independent methods. overlapping samples from non-A-E hepatitis serum cohorts 1 and 2 were detected only in samples that had been extracted using Qiagen columns. large number of PHV reads were also recovered from deep sequencing of a negative water control mock extracted through the QIAamp viral-RNA minikit. coverage maps for independently de novo assembled PHV-1, PHV-2, and PHV-3 genomes. arrow depicts break in coverage that precluded whole-genome assembly of PHV-3. nt, nucleotide, black vertical bars indicate mismatches or insertions. PCR analysis of the processed water controls using four sets of primers detected PHV only in samples that had been processed using Qiagen spin columns. a subset of PCR amplicons were Sanger sequenced and confirmed to be >99% identical to PHV-1. 78 public data sets containing 213,615,095 sequence reads were analyzed. a total of 78 public data sets containing 213,615,095 sequence reads were analyzed. two data sets from marine sources containing Roche 454 pyrosequencing data harbor 3 PHV sequences. study of metagenomes in coastal regions off Oregon and Concepci\u00f3n, Chile. PHV appears to be a hybrid intermediate between the parvoviruses and circoviruses and is nearly identical by sequence to another virus, NIH-CQV, recently reported to have been found in patients with seronegative hepatitis. if present in PHV, an episomal form, which has been detected in parvoviruses such as adeno-associated virus and bocavirus (55, 56) may represent a rare variant in the viral population. PHV does appear to bridge the interface between circoviruses and parvoviruses. as such, may be related to the last common ancestor of these two ssDNA viral family lineages. sporadic contamination events may inadvertently mislead researchers into making disease associations if they are unaware that a newly discovered virus is a contaminant and not a bona fide infectious agent. the presence of contamination in spin columns can negatively impact the performance of both clinical and research-based assays for pathogen detection. greater sequence variation was observed in PHV-3 (negative water control) and PHV-6C (encephalitis samples, pool C), which had relatively lower depths of coverage than the other PHV genomes. an alternative possibility is that there is indeed genetic heterogeneity in PHV/NIH-CQV that reflects natural variation arising from lot-to-lot variability. a highly conserved sequence within the immunodominant region of HTLV gp21 that is shared with p15E was likely the source of the cross-reactive antibodies elicited by HTLV-1 infection (60). a highly conserved sequence within the immunodominant region of HTLV gp21 that is likely the source of the cross-reactive antibodies elicited by HTLV-1 infection (60) silica used in many commercial spin columns is derived from the cell walls of diatoms (57) sporadic contamination may be due to seasonal variation in diatom abundance, diatom type, and rates of viral infection (67) the contamination of spin columns is not confined to PHV but can be seen by the presence of sequences corresponding to phages, circoviruses, and parvoviruses other than PHV (16). our results thus strongly call into question any association of the PHV and NIH-CQV viruses with seronegative hepatitis. timely reporting of \u201cdediscoveries\u201d as well as discoveries is needed to maximize the translational impact of pathogen discovery to clinical medicine and infectious diseases."}
