{"summary": "ILIs were defined as body temperature 38\u00b0C and cough and at least two of the following symptoms: sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache and muscular pain, for a maximum duration of 3 days. we screened these specimens using five multiplex real time Reverse Transcription and/or Polymerase Chain Reaction assays for detection of 14 respiratory viruses. acute lower respiratory infections account for 20% of all deaths among children under 5 years. most of viral ARI especially in children are caused by human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which induces bronchiolitis, asthma exacerbation and pneumonia. influenza epidemics often result in dramatic increases in hospitalization, death and significant economic losses due to workplace absenteeism. malaria is an island located in the south-west part of the Indian Ocean. it has several bio-climates from sub-tropical to semi-arid along its coasts. it has a more temperate climate in the centre highlands. malaria is one of the poorest countries of the world with a health system. study conducted in 9 influenza sentinel sites in the central part of the country. a cold and dry season (austral winter) from May to October and a warm and rainy season (austral summer) between November and April. sample was considered as positive when its Ct value was equal or above the Ct value of the Limit of Detection (LOD) of the corresponding reference viruses. sample was inoculated in MDCK cell line and then identified according to the WHO protocol. the protocol and oral consent were determined as routine surveillance activity, and therefore non-research by the national Steering Committee for Surveillance of Fevers. data were collected in an objective of surveillance and are anonymous. a retrospective study analyzed anonymous specimens collected from July 2008 to June 2009. for the study, viral RNA and DNA were extracted from specimens. we performed four multiplex rRT-PCR and one multiplex rPCR assays. results Demographics and clinical characteristics of outpatients presenting ILI relating to infections in Antananarivo, from July 2008 to June 2009. 138 (44.1%) males and 175 (55.9%) females. 94,2) Rhinorrhea 191 (61.0) 150 (63,8) 98 (59,0) 52 (75,4) Headache 124 (39.6) 93 (39,6) 64 (38,6) 29 (42,0) Muscular pain 55 (17.6) 79 (33,6) 67 (40,4) 12 (17,4) N = total number of patient. a all patient had fever and cough at presentation as inclusion criteria. ness ranged from 3.9% to 0.6%.

Figure 1 shows the seasonal patterns of the most prevalent viruses. 138 (44.1%) males and 175 (55.9%) females were positive for at least one pathogen. single infections occurred in 166 (53.0%) patients and co-infections were detected in 69 (22.0%) patients. children 5 years old represented 49.2% of all ILI cases. highest percentage of viral infections was observed in children under 5 years old. sore throat was present in 93.9% of the patients. Virus Total (%) Single infection (%) Co-infection (%) 5 yr > = 5 yr 5 yr > = 5 yr 5 yr > = 5 yr 5 yr > = 5 yr N = 177 N = 134 N = 82 N = 84 N = 95 N = 50 FLUAV 40 (22.6) 45 (33.6) 21 (25.6) 29 (34.5) 19 (20.0) 16 (32.0) HRV 38 (21.5) 39 (29 oV 2 (1.1) 0 (0.0) 1 (1.2) 0 (0.0) HPIV-2 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) N = total number of virus detected. the first period of circulation occurred from October to December 2008. this period was followed by a low level circulation of A/H3N2 in April 2009. HRV and HAdV were detected throughout the study period. we defined ILI as fever and cough with at least two of listed symptoms. patients presenting to clinics with ILIs were more frequently children less than 5 years (49.2%) since 2006, rates of influenza positive cases among all specimens received ranged from 27.8% to 35.8%. HRV is known to be responsible for upper ARI but also in asthma exacerbation in infants and children. prevalence of viral infections (single and co-infection) was higher in children under 5 years (49.4% and 65.2%) as expected, since level of pre-immunity in this age group is lower. in Antananarivo, influenza circulation occurred during two distinct periods, the first during the cold season and similar to what occurs in southern hemisphere countries. in our study, HCoV-OC43 infection occurred in winter, before the FLUAV circulation, however HAdV was more frequent during summer. the other respiratory viruses showed a low prevalence during the study period, without any defined seasonal pattern. molecular assays testing for these 14 pathogens in respiratory secretions still have some interests in clinical practice. the viruses temporal patterns detected in this study also need to be assessed over multiple years to identify long-term seasonal patterns. this study did not test for bacteria and therefore gaps remain in our understanding of all the etiologies of ILIs in Madagascar."}
