{"summary": "IFN- is produced as the earliest of type I IFN initiating a cascade of IFN- via autocrine and paracrine loops. in non-viral infections IFN production might be defensive or deleterious [7], [8]. type I IFN synthesis via triggering a pattern recognition receptor in the cytosol of host cells [10], [11]. lymphotoxin- might be involved in the triggering of type I IFN responses [13], [14] and lymphotoxin receptor was shown to be crucially involved in the controlling of Listeria monocytogenes infection [15]. different myeloid cell populations were shown to be responsible for IFN- production during Listeria infection. stockinger et al. defined CD11b+CD11cPDCA1B220 macrophages to be the major IFN- producers and pDCs were claimed to make no contribution. the luciferase signal in spleen and lymph nodes mirrored the presence of Listeria in these organs. we compared LO28 and EGDe, two commonly used strains of Listeria monocytogenes. at 24 hours post infection (p.i.), IFN- induction occurred almost exclusively in the spleen. luciferase activity was visualized in the IVIS 200 whole body imaging system. LO28 induced a stronger signal compared to EGDe. there was no significant signal from the liver at any time point. listeria monocytogenes colonizes cervical and inguinal lymph nodes. a defect in the type I IFN system resulted in lower bacterial numbers. a defect in the type I IFN system resulted in lower bacterial numbers. cLNs and \"iLNs\" stand for cervical and inguinal lymph nodes respectively. experiment was done twice with 3 animals per group. colonization of lymph nodes paralleled IFN- production. pDCs do not contribute to the production of type I IFN during Listeria monocytogenes infection. plasmacytoid dendritic cells do not produce type I IFN during Listeria monocytogenes infection. pDCs were depleted in vivo by intravenous injection of 100 g anti-mPDCA-1 mAb 24 hours prior L. monocytogenes LO28 infection. pDCs do not significantly contribute to type I IFN production. cells produce IFN- both in spleen and in lymph nodes. bacterial loads in spleen and livers of such mice were similar. \"global\" stands for IFN-+/-luc; \"CD4\", \"CD19\" and \"LysM\" stand for IFN-+/flox-luc x CD4cre, IFN-+/flox-luc x CD19cre and IFN-+/flox-luc x LysMcre. low signals due to quenching of bioluminescent light by melanin in fur and skin of the C57BL/6 mice. luminescence signal in such mice is lower than in the mice shown in Fig. 1A. the results were corroborated by ex vivo quantification of luciferase activity. LysM-expressing cells almost exclusively produce IFN- in both spleen and lymph nodes upon infection with L. monocytogenes. the extent of IFN- expression was dramatically reduced in IFN-flox-luc/flox-luc x LysMcre mice. total IFN- levels were also markedly reduced in IFN-flox-luc/flox-luc. flox-luc/flox-luc x LysMcre and IFN-/ mice showed strongly reduced bacterial numbers in the organs 24 hours after infection. preventing LysM-expressing cells from IFN- production is sufficient to avoid the detrimental effects of type I IFN during murine listeriosis. granulocytes were depleted 24 hours prior to infection of mice with 5105 L. monocytogenes LO28. granulocytes were sacrificed 24 hours before infection, spleens and serum were harvested. CD11b+CD11cintLy6C+ cells previously defined as Tip-DCs are the major IFN- producers upon Listeria infection [29] we wanted to know whether Tip-DCs belong to LysM-expressing monocyte /macrophage population. we sorted CD11b+CD11cmacrophages, CD11c+CD11b dendritic cells (DCs), CD11b+CD11cintLy6C+ Tip splenic cells were isolated and subjected to FACS sorting. RNA of the isolated cells was extracted, reverse-transcribed and subjected to PCR for the indicated genes. a previously described IFN- reporter mouse allows whole body in vivo imaging of IFN- induction. luciferase activity was visualized in the IVIS 200 whole body imaging system. LO28 induced a stronger signal compared to EGDe. there was no sign from the liver at any time point, although this organ is highly colonized by Listeria. listeria monocytogenes colonizes cervical and inguinal lymph nodes. spleen and liver were defined as the target organs of these bacteria. a defect in the type I IFN system resulted in lower bacterial numbers. cLNs and \u201ciLNs\u201d stand for cervical and inguinal lymph nodes respectively. experiment was done twice with 3 animals per group. results are expressed as means. colonization of lymph nodes paralleled IFN- production. pDCs do not contribute to the production of type I IFN during Listeria monocytogenes infection. plasmacytoid dendritic cells do not produce type I IFN. pDCs were depleted in vivo by intravenous injection of 100 g anti-mPDCA-1 mAb 24 hours prior L. monocytogenes LO28 infection. pDCs do not significantly contribute to type I IFN production. bacterial loads in spleens and livers of such mice were also similar. mice were crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase. the albino gene was not yet crossed in. \"global\" stands for IFN-+/-luc; \"CD4\", \"CD19\" and \"LysM\" stand for IFN-+/flox-luc x CD4cre, IFN-+/flox-luc x CD19cre. recombinant mice were infected with Listeria monocytogenes and 24 hours p.i. serum levels of type I IFN were determined by ELISA. the results were corroborated by ex vivo quantification of luciferase activity. FN- production was identical in C57BL/6 and IFN-flox-luc/flox-luc/flox-luc mice. extent of IFN- expression was dramatically reduced in IFN-flox-luc/flox-luc x LysMcre mice. total IFN- levels were also markedly reduced in IFN-/ mice. IFN-flox-luc/flox-luc x LysMcre and IFN-/ mice showed strongly reduced bacterial numbers in the organs 24 hours after infection. preventing LysM-expressing cells from IFN- production is sufficient to avoid the detrimental effects of type I IFN during murine listeriosis. e activity in IFN-+/-luc mice depleted of neutrophils revealed. similar amounts of IFN- and total IFN- in serum were found in C57BL/6 mice. depletion of granulocytes does not influence the amount of type I IFN. no expression is observed in T and B cells. we wanted to know if Tip-DCs belong to LysM-expressing monocyte /macrophage population. we sorted CD11b+CD11cmacrophages, CD11c+CD11b dendritic cells. FN-+/flox-luc x LysMcre mice (n = 5) were infected intravenously with 5105 L. monocytogenes LO28 strain. splenic cells were isolated and subjected to FACS sorting. RNA of the isolated cells was extracted, reverse-transcribed and subjected to PCR for the indicated genes. we could show that IFN- is almost exclusively produced by LysM-expressing cells in the spleen as well as in colonized lymph nodes. the use of the LysMcre mouse does not allow distinction between myeloid cell populations, although lower expression in CD11c+ cells was reported. CD11ccre mice experiments confirm that conventional DCs do not significantly contribute to IFN- production. this extends the in vitro data of Stockinger et al. [28] to the in vivo situation. the absence of a contribution of Kupffer cells was expected. the colonization of lymph nodes after i.v. infection has been ignored. the colonization of lymph nodes after i.v. infection has been ignored. riosis is responsible for the induction of type I IFN cascade in most cell types. pDCs, the cell type that is able to produce type I IFN independent of IFN- and neutrophils, do not contribute at all to the overall production of type I IFN during murine listeriosis. CD11ccre mice [64] were kindly provided by Prof. Ulrich Kalinke, Twincore. IFN-+/-luc mice were crossed with albino C57BL/6 to improve in vivo imaging. RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from spleen cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) the data were analyzed using LSRII (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) monocytogenes strain LO28 serotype 1/2c [65] and EGDe serotype 1/2a [66] was grown in brain heart infusion or on BHI-plates overnight. the next day, suspensions were diluted and grown until reaching log-phase. bacteria were then centrifuged, washed several times and resuspended in sterile PBS. 5105 CFU/mouse is lethal dose (25LD50), mice start dying at day 2\u20133 after infection. all mice are able to clear the bacterial around day 7 after infection. conditional deletion/reporter mice IFN-flox-luc were generated using C57BL/6 ES-cells (Bruce4) to replace the IFN- CDS by luciferase in germ line (IFN-luc), IFN-flox-luc mice were crossed with CD19cre [62], CD4cre [63] and LysMcre [44] mice respectively.
