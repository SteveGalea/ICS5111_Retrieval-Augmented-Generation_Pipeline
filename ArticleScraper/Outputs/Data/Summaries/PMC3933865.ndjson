{"summary": "clonal populations were derived by limiting dilution cloning or sorting T cells using antibodies specific for the variable region of TCR beta chains. TCRs were cloned into the MP-71 retroviral vector18 and tested for expression in primary human T cells.

T cell cytokine production mirrored TCR expression and there was clearly a positive and negative orientation for each TCR construct. the optimal orientation of the TCR expression cassettes resulted in an increase in the frequency of TNF- and IL-2 producing cells within the population of transduced T cells. a simple modification of inverting the TCR alpha and beta chain orientation can have a significant impact on T cell function in engineered T cells. pentamer staining following transduction of T cells activated in the presence of IL-2 alone or IL-2 + TLR ligands. increase in IFN-+ CD4+ T cells compared to T cells activated in IL-2 alone. we analyzed the supernatant taken from cultures after the 48 h incubation with anti-CD3, IL-2 and TLR ligands. we tested for the production of 42 different cytokines in cultures derived from 3 separate healthy donors. we found that addition of TLR ligands generally reduced the production of immunoregulatory/Th2 cytokines compared to IL-2 alone. we observed an increase in IFN-+/pentamer+ T cells with polyI:C and ssRNA40 compared to IL-2 alone. however, only approximately 70% of the IFN-+ cells were pentamer positive. this leaves a significant number of IFN-+ T cells that express too little TCR to stain with pentamer. bars show total frequency of IFN-+ CD8+ T cells transduced under different conditions. specific lysis of hepatocyte cell lines expressing HBV antigens with sorted HBV core18\u201327 TCR, V beta+ CD8+ transduced T cells cultured under different conditions. we compared the ability of T cells transduced with the HBV core antigen-specific TCR to lyse hepatocyte-like cell lines (HepG2) expressing HBV antigens. we observed 95% specific lysis at a 1:5 E:T ratio and 80% specific lysis at a 1:10 E:T ratio. a glycine-serine-glycine spacer and a non-native cysteine disulfide bond in the TCR constructs led to increased expression and pairing. the difference in expression of the TCR beta chain between the different orientations was less pronounced than that observed for HLA multimer staining in the non-CD8 T cell population. in some TCRs, the two different orientations (-P2A- and -P2A-) resulted in nearly equal expression. this similarity was observed in TCRs with the highest TCR V beta expression (>25% of CD8 T cells) these TCRs may be particularly stable and thus expression is not influenced so significantly by endogenous TCRs. T cells that do not express enough paired TCR were also positive for the introduced beta chain. 90% or greater of the IFN-+ T cells were also positive for the introduced beta chain. cell lines Antigen-presenting cell lines, EBV transformed B cell and HLA-A2 positive T2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 20 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 5 g/ml Plasmocin (InvivoGen) cultures were tested for positive responses using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-. cells were stained with anti-IFN PE-Cy7 (BD Pharmingen) for 15 min on ice. postive responses were restimulated to increase frequency and numbers of peptide-specific T cells. isolation of Ag-specific T cells Expanded T cell lines were stimulated with 1 ug/ml of peptide for 2 h in the presence of anti-CD107a-APC at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed once and passed through a 70 uM cell strainer. the gene cassettes consisting of VC-P2A-VC and VC-P2A-VC orientations were tested for expression and functionality in primary human T cells. the gene cassettes consisting of VC-P2A-VC and VC-P2A-VC orientations were tested for expression and functionality. lymphocytes were harvested, washed, counted and 5 105 cells plated into retronectin coated wells and mixed with 1.5\u20132 ml of unconcentrated retroviral supernatants. after 24 h, the viral supernatant was replaced with 2% human AB serum, supplemented with 100 U/ml IL-2. functionality of the introduced TCR redirected T cells was tested 7 days post transduction as described below. each experiment was performed at least twice and the best clone from each orientation was used to test functionality of the TCR transduced T cells. the best clone from each orientation was used to test functionality of the TCR transduced T cells. cells were labeled with a Fixable Viability Dye eFluor780 (eBioscience) and stained with CD8-PECy7 and CD4-Alexa700. redirected cells specific for the HBV core18\u201327 epitope were sorted based on TCR V beta and CD8 expression. s 10 g/ml polyI:C (TLR-3), 5 g/ml Imiquimod (TLR-7), 1 g/ml ssRNA40 (TLR-8), and 5 uM CpG (CpG2216; TLR-9) were added during the first 48 h of PBMC activation. cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 20 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 5 g/ml Plasmocin (InvivoGen) cultures were tested for positive responses using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-. cells were stained with anti-IFN PE-Cy7 (BD Pharmingen) for 15 min on ice. postive responses were restimulated to increase frequency and numbers of peptide-specific T cells. isolation of Ag-specific T cells Expanded T cell lines were stimulated with 1 ug/ml of peptide for 2 h in the presence of anti-CD107a-APC at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed once and passed through a 70 uM cell strainer. sequences obtained were BLAST against the Human TCR database online (IMGT/V-Quest, http://www.imgt.org) to identify the components of the TCRs.
