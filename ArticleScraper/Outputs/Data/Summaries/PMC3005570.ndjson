{"summary": "public health professionals in the small island state of barbados put various measures in place to improve its response in the event of a pandemic Methods Data was collected using ten sentinel sites. it is comprised of ten sentinel sites which send weekly notifications of acute respiratory illness (ARI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) to the Office of the national Epidemiologist. international health organizations recognized the need for all countries to develop sensitive surveillance systems to be able to detect the entry of novel viruses into the population. Barbados is the most easterly island in the Caribbean Sea, measuring 166 square miles with an estimated mid-year population in 2009. in 2007, the national Influenza Surveillance System was revitalized beginning with surveillance of cases of acute respiratory illness (ARI) at the countries eight community health centres which served as sentinel sites. this was expanded in January 2008 to include the island\u2019s lone tertiary public hospital where cases of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) are detected routinely through active surveillance. abs were taken from all cases of SARI detected at the hospital sentinel site and a sample of six swabs from patients meeting the criteria of ARI. all primary health care facilities were asked to take nasopharyngeal swabs from all persons who presented with fever (>38\u00b0C) with respiratory symptoms and a travel history to an affected area. the evidence surrounding the use of some NPIs to delay spread of infection in a pandemic has been found to be weak [9],[10],[11]. this paper compares these interventions to the recommendations of the article by Aledort et al. for the outbreak period (June to October 2009), the surveillance team received reports of 2,483 cases, compared to 412 cases for the same period in 2008. the total hospitalization rate due to SARIs for the year 2009 was 90.1 per 100,000 people, compared to 7.3 per 100,000 people for 2008. the highest hospitalization rate occurred in children less than one year followed by those 1 to 4 years old (290 per 100,000). an infectious waste protocol was developed to guide health facilities in the disposal of infectious waste. a protocol governing distribution and usage was developed and circulated. the central storage facility has been improved upon during this time but remains challenged by lack of security. contact management Quarantine and contact tracing Ministry of Health took the decision early in the pandemic that there was insufficient evidence to support quarantining of asymptomatic persons who had been in contact with a probable or confirmed case. the protocol adopted for contact tracing varied according to whether persons were regarded as probable or confirmed cases. a probable case is an individual with an influenza test that is positive for influenza A, but is unsubtypable by reagents used to detect seasonal influenza virus infection classes were cancelled for approximately 1-2 hours in each case. public health officials also visited the workplaces of the first reported cases. one school reported high absenteeism among staff, which resulted in the decision to close the school. the case definition for a suspected case of 2009 H1N1 was modified to exclude travel requirement. the drug was widely used throughout the outbreak and no cases of resistance were reported. the vaccine campaign began in february 2010. more than half (53.5%) of all confirmed 2009 H1N1 viral infections occurred in females. the most common presenting symptoms were fever - 92.9% (144 cases); cough or sore throat - 82.6% (128 cases). only 35.5% (55) of cases presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. all cases suspected of having 2009 H1N1 were investigated and close contacts monitored until the results of the swab were obtained. the swabs were sent to a regional centre for real-time polymerase chain reaction testing to be done. this resulted in wait times for results that average one week but were occasionally as long as six weeks. the manual provided detailed instructions to health care leaders. the manual provided detailed instructions on the structure and type of isolation facilities that ought to be available at their facility. health care facilities attempted to follow evidence-based guidelines. close contacts with symptoms were isolated at home or in hospital. contacts were given a short sensitization session and fact sheets on hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and proper cleaning methods of laundry and other household items. many primary (ages 5-11) and secondary schools (ages 11-18) reported absenteeism rates from schools ranged from as low as 9% to as high as 40%. all suspected cases in the island were reported to the Office of the National Epidemiologist and nasopharyngeal swabs taken. all cases suspected of having 2009 H1N1 were investigated and close contacts monitored until the results of the swab were obtained. a protocol governing distribution and usage was developed and circulated. the central storage facility has been improved upon during this time. all suspected cases in the island were reported to the Office of the National Epidemiologist and nasopharyngeal swabs taken. personal protective equipment (PPE) was donated by the u.s. agency for international development (USAID) in may 2008. USD 40,500 in supplies was approved for the financial year 2008/2009. central storage facility has been improved upon during this time. the island\u2019s lone public hospital is the only major health centre with designated isolation facilities but its capacity was significantly overwhelmed during the outbreak. administrators and health care providers remained committed to the principles of patient isolation for dangerous infectious diseases. the protocol adopted for contact tracing varied according to whether persons were regarded as probable or confirmed cases. the protocol adopted for contact tracing varied according to whether persons were regarded as probable or confirmed cases. a probable case is an individual with an influenza test that is positive for influenza A, but is unsubtypable by reagents used to detect seasonal influenza virus infection. close contacts were followed at home or in hospital depending on severity of symptoms. public health officials visited the workplaces of the first reported cases. one school, however, reported high (75%) absenteeism among staff. education officials made the decision to close the school to prevent issues of discipline and security from arising. public health officials visited the workplaces of the first reported cases. classes were cancelled for 1-2 hours in each case as fears were addressed. one school reported high absenteeism among staff, which resulted in decision to close the school. the case definition for a suspected case of H1N1 was modified to exclude the travel requirement. in July 2009 those with mild respiratory illness who had certain specified chronic diseases and those with moderate to severe illness were eligible to receive Tamiflu. the protocol was first circulated in may 2009. use was restricted to those with moderate to severe respiratory illness who met the case definition of a suspected case. the disease became more widespread in barbados, the case definition for a suspected case of H1N1 was modified to exclude the travel requirement. protocols were developed, disseminated and adhered to in the majority of the private and public sectors. the response was characterized by technical cooperation between public and private sector within the country as well as regional (PAHO and CAREC) and extra-regional (CDC) alliances. most non-pharmaceutical interventions employed closely followed recommendations made by international organizations such as the WHO and CDC. the use of rapid tests in the pre-pandemic and early pandemic phases was recommended by Aledort et al. but the recommendation was made with the reservation that these tests often have suboptimal sensitivity [9,22]. in barbados, having weighed the benefits of rapid diagnosis against the high costs and wide margin of error, the use of rapid tests was decided against. authors acknowledge the contribution of the following persons to the pandemic response: the Barbados Drug Service, the Medical Officers of Health and Senior Health Sisters of all community health centres (polyclinics) the authors have approved the final version of this publication."}
