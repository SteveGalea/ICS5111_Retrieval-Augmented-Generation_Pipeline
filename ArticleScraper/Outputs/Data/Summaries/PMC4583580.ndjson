{"summary": "the study was a 52-week prospective investigation of households between august 2009 and august 2010. participants provided informed consent. the study included the second wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. sample lysis, nucleic acid purification, nested-multiplexed PCR, and amplicon analysis were performed in a closed pouch using the filmArray instrument. sample lysis, nucleic acid purification, nested-multiplexed PCR, and amplicon analysis were performed. an illness episode was defined as 1 consecutive weeks in which symptoms were recorded. the same virus was detected and classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic. symptom diary documented by the household reporter the occurrence on any day in the past week of: fever, nasal congestion, cough, wheeze, or gastrointestinal symptoms. data reported >7 days after the scheduled date were excluded. a reminder email was sent and the study coordinator contacted the family. a weekly anterior nares swab specimen was obtained. purification, nested-multiplexed PCR, and amplicon analysis were performed in a closed pouch using the filmArray instrument. internal controls were included for each sample. the cohort included 26 households with 105 individuals at initiation.
