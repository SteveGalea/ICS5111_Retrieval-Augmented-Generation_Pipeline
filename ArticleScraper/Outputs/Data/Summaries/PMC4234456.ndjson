{"summary": "global outbreak detection and reporting have generally improved for a variety of diseases and geographic regions in recent decades3. the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic illustrates the global public health risks associated with reporting lags. methods Infectious disease outbreaks reported by Chan et al. (2010) that were selected for analyses included those that could be linked to a specific causal pathogen. we eliminated 52 reports of acute or undiagnosed symptoms and diseases from the initial dataset of 398 outbreaks and also removed the 2005 Chikungunya outbreak on Reunion Island. 27 outbreak reports were eliminated because explanatory factors for the country-year of occurrence were not available. cell phone subscriptions per 100 people can be a number over 100 when individuals have more than 1 subscription. internet coverage and cell phone subscriptions are representative of two communications infrastructure advancements that globally occurred during the study\u2019s duration. previous communication advancements, such as Telex likely had similar impacts when first implemented 23, 24. freedom of the press index and internet usage were most strongly associated with reduced lags in outbreak reporting. countries with open media policies and a large proportion of Internet users are fastest to report outbreaks. 1 -1093.43 2188.87 25.96 0.0001 1 FP 2 -1087.30 2178.60 15.69 0.0002 2 HCE 2 -1090.38 2184.76 21.85 0.0001 3 I 2 -1085.52 2175.05 12.14 0.0012 4 H 2 -1093.23 2190.45 27.55 0.0001 5 Cell 2 -1092.11 2188.21 25.31 0.0001 6 FP, HCE 3 the shortest expected reporting lags occurred in the Americas, Europe, and Australia. the longest expected lags occurred in central and northern Africa and central Asia. light gray indicates countries with expected lags less than one week. many countries expected waiting times decreased over time (A), remained relatively constant (B), and a few increased (C) interests exist."}
