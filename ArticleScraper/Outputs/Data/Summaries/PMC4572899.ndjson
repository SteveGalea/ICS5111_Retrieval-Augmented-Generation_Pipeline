{"summary": "a detailed analysis of the immunomodulatory properties and proteomic profile of MSCs systemically administered to two patients with severe refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) both patients received 2 106 cells per kilogram and each improved with resolution of respiratory, hemodynamic, and multiorgan failure. ARDS is a severe, life-threatening medical condition characterized by widespread uncontrolled inflammation in the lungs associated with the loss of surfactant and impaired pulmonary capillary endothelial barriers. etiologies can trigger ARDS, including primary respiratory infections, sepsis, and significant trauma. ARDS survivors often have long-term pulmonary, neuromuscular, and cognitive symptoms. administration of non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allogeneic MSCs has also been demonstrated to be safe and potentially effective in a widening range of clinical applications in both lung diseases and other diseases. a recent phase I dose-escalation safety study demonstrated the safety of a single i.v. administration of 1\u201310 million cells per kilogram of MSCs in 9 patients with moderate to severe ARDS. the condition of the two patients in our report had deteriorated with ECMO support. a total of 28 ml of bone marrow was aspirated from a 49-year-old volunteer. the cells were harvested and cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. the total dose administered to the patients was 2 106 cells per kilogram of recipient body weight. the total dose was divided into 4 syringes of 50 ml, and each syringe was infused over 30 seconds. pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in serial samples of BAL fluid and serum were assessed using a multiplex cytokine assay (EMD Millipore) in BAL fluid, the surfactant protein B concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; USCN Life Science Inc., Houston, TX, http://www.uscnk.com) the preamplified material was diluted 1:20 in Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) for analysis. the samples were loaded onto OpenArray plates using the standard Accufill protocol (Life Technologies) a total of 758 miRNAs were assayed, and 200\u2013300 miRNAs gave a detectable Ct value for each time point. the same bone marrow-MSCs used in the patient were cocultured with allogeneic T cells (MSC/T-cell ratio 1:5 and 1:10) for 5 days. the T cells were stimulated with activating anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 antibodies. PBMCs were cultured for 5 days in the presence of MSCs. the cells were treated with the Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, http://www.bdbiosciences.com) to perform intracellular staining, the cells were analyzed using a FACS Canto II cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo, version 9.5 software. indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), 5\u2032-GCATTTTTTCTCTTCGCATA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCATACACCAGACCGTCTGATA-3\u2032. 2-microglobulin, 5\u2032- TGCTGTCTCCATGTTTGATGTATCT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TCATACACCACCGTCTAAGT-3\u2032 were resuspended in 250. nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed using the NS500 (NanoSight, Wiltshire, U.K., http://www.malvern.com) the number of particles and their movement were recorded using a camera level of 15 and automatic functions for all postacquisition settings except for the detection threshold. trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, http://www.promega.com), at a 1:50 trypsin/protein ratio, was added to the cell lysate in 250 mM urea and 50 mM HEPES. the filter units were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 14,000g, followed by 2 more additions and centrifugation with 8 M urea and 25 mM HEPES. the Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent manner, selecting the top five precursors for fragmentation by higher energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) the survey scan was performed at 70,000 resolutions from 300 to 1,700 resolutions from 300 to 1,700 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), with a maximum injection time of 100 milliseconds and target of 1 106 ions. clinical-grade MSCs were generated under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions according to a common protocol elaborated by the European Group for Bone and Marrow Transplantation Developmental Committee. the MSCs were harvested and cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. cells were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 0.9% saline solution. the cells were resuspended in 0.9% saline solution with the addition of 10% AB plasma. mography scans were performed as part of the routine clinical care provided to each patient. Respiratory measurements, including lung volumes and pressure, were obtained from the mechanical ventilation record of each patient. human pool A and Human Pool B (Life Technologies) were used for reverse transcription followed by a preamplification step. the preamplified material was diluted 1:20 in Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) for analysis. a total of 758 miRNAs were assayed, and 200\u2013300 miRNAs gave a detectable Ct value for each time point. the same bone marrow-MSCs used in the patient were cocultured with allogeneic T cells (MSC/T-cell ratio 1:5 and 1:10) for 5 days. the same bone marrow-MSCs were stimulated with activating anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec) for 5 days. annexin-V-FITC staining kit was used to assess levels of PMN apoptosis. cells were analyzed using a FACS Canto II cytometer (BD Biosciences) messenger RNA levels were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a Rotor Gene Q (Qiagen) Relative gene expression was determined by normalizing the expression to 2-microglobulin using the 2Ct method. the following gene-specific primers were used (forward and reverse sequence) the pellets were resuspended in PBS, pooled, and ultracentrifuged again at 110,000g for 90 minutes at +4\u00b0C. the remaining pellet was resuspended in 250 l of PBS. trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, http://www.promega.com), at a 1:50 trypsin/protein ratio, was added to the cell lysate in 250 mM urea and 50 mM HEPES. the filter units were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 14,000g, followed by another addition of the 8 M urea buffer and centrifugation. the Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent manner, selecting the top five precursors for fragmentation by higher energy C-trap dissociation. the survey scan was performed at 70,000 resolutions from 300 to 1,700 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), with a maximum ion injection time of 100 milliseconds and target of 1 106 ions. gene ontology term enrichment analysis was done using the protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER) classification system. one-way analysis of variance was used to statistically evaluate the difference of sample means among multiple groups. 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension was hospitalized 8 days after the onset of high fever, cough, and dyspnea. the total dose (2 106 cells per kilogram of recipient weight) was divided into aliquots of 5 ml of cell suspension given at 6 time points over 20 minutes. ECMO support was maintained for 3 minutes between each infusion. the patient had no detectable influenza A H1N1 particles, as assessed by RT-PCR. pulmonary compliance increased from 6 ml/cmH2O before infusion to 20 ml/cmH2O at 2 days, increasing to 44 ml/cmH2O at day 8. transfusion-related acute lung injury could also have played a role in the patient\u2019s deterioration. in patient 2, pulmonary compliance increased from 20 ml/cmH2O before infusion to 35 ml/cmH2O at day 1. tidal volumes similarly increased; increasing in patient 1 from 100 to 420 ml over a 2-day period, reaching 720 ml at 5 days. patient 1 stabilized over the first days and was weaned off intravenous pressor agents. ase; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; MSC, mesenchymal stromal cell; WBC, white blood cell. progressive decrease occurred in pulmonary infiltrates starting the first day after MSC infusion. by day 7, the CXR findings had improved back to normal. the bone marrow function continued to be reconstituted after MSC infusion. patient 1 was discharged from the ICU after 46 days and left the hospital at day 69. two months later, the patient had returned to work and had recovered both physically and mentally. plasma and BAL fluid granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels increased in response to both MSC administration and pneumonia. proinflammatory chemokine inducible protein 10 (IP10) responded similarly to IL-8 in the BAL fluid with an initial rapid decrease after MSC infusion, followed by a small increase as a response to the pneumonia. no significant change in plasma IL-8 levels was observed. a transient increase in miRNA levels was observed by day 7. other inflammation-related miRNAs showed a dichotomous pattern. other inflammation-related miRNAs showed a dichotomous pattern. a progressive decrease in both ccK18 and K18 occurred in both patients\u2019 BAL fluids, suggesting no clear shift between epithelial apoptosis and necrosis. in both patients\u2019 BAL fluids, surfactant protein B levels increased during the first 4 days after MSC administration, further suggesting recovery of alveolar epithelial integrity and function. in both patients, MSC administration was temporally associated with changes in circulating neutrophil counts. compared with unprimed MSCs, primed MSCs upregulated cell surface expression of CD54 (ICAM-1), CD106 (VCAM-1) and HLA-ABC and HLA-DR (supplemental online Fig. 3A) culture, both resting and pMSCs protected PMNs from apoptosis. the percentage of CD16-positive PMNs matched the percentage of viable PMNs. the percentage of CD11b-positive PMNs was higher in the presence of MSCs. coculture with MSCs led to a marked increase of mature CD11bright/CD16bright/CD62Ldim (N2-type) PMNs resembling granulocytic MDSCs (F) coculturing MSCs with healthy control PBMCs promoted CD14+HLA-DRlow monocytes resembling monocytic MDSCs (H) a subpopulation of PMNs and monocytes, termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), exert immune regulatory effects and are often increased in inflammatory or inflammatory-like conditions such as cancer. preclinical data have pointed toward beneficial effects [42] increased levels of circulating CD4+CD25highCD127low regulatory TRegs were observed in both patients\u2019 peripheral blood for up to 20 days after MSC administration. findings from animal models suggest recovery from acute lung injury involves upregulation of TRegs [47] article tracking analysis showed a typical EV distribution pattern with particles of a mode size of around 60 nm. the nanoLC-MS/MS analysis identified 3,040 proteins in the MSCs and 937 proteins in their EVs. the median number of peptide spectrum matches per protein was approximately 10 for cells and 8 for EVs. GO enrichment data on biological processes, molecular function, cellular component, protein class, and pathways can be found in the supplemental online data (supplemental online Fig. 6A\u20136E). ARDS diagnostics according to the Berlin criteria at admission to the ICU. patient's condition worsened, with persistent hypoxemia, progressive bilateral infiltrates, and liver failure. progressive hypercapnia and hypoxia developed over the next 2 days. despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, progressive hypercapnia and hypoxia developed over the next 2 days. an echocardiogram demonstrated normal cardiac function. the patient\u2019s condition worsened over the next 2 days, with persistent hypoxemia, progressive bilateral infiltrates, and liver failure. he was diagnosed with severe ARDS according to the Berlin criteria. acute myeloid leukemia was diagnosed in the bone marrow aspirate. several teeth were extracted at the initiation of cytotoxic therapy. despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, progressive hypercapnia and hypoxia developed over the next 2 days. serial CXRs demonstrated progressive decreases in pulmonary infiltrates. positive end-expiratory pressure and peak inspiratory pressure were set and maintained within a defined range while the patient was receiving ECMO support. pulmonary compliance increased from 6 ml/cmH2O before infusion to 20 ml/cmH2O at 2 days, increasing to 44 ml/cmH2O at day 8. the patient was weaned off ECMO the next day and extubated on day 12. by day 7, the pulmonary compliance (B) and tidal volumes (C) improved to normal levels within the first 2 days. patients 1 developed nosocomial pneumonia with fever, increased white blood cell count, and new infiltrates on CXR. the blood cultures were positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci. tidal volumes increased from 221 to 617 ml over a 7-day period. the patient underwent consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia and subsequently could not perform the SF-36 test. changes in Pulmonary and Systemic Inflammatory Markers After the MSC infusions demonstrated elevations in some, but not all inflammatory, markers in both patients. the orange line represents the mean values measured in healthy controls. levels of caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18, indicative of epithelial apoptosis, and uncleaved cytokeratin-18, indicative of total epithelial death in BAL fluid decreased in both patients within a few hours after MSC administration. changes in pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines could not be evaluated in the BAL fluid of patient 2. no significant increase in pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines was observed in either BAL fluid or plasma after MSC administration. ccK18 was elevated in patient 1 before MSC transfer and decreased, starting a few hours after infusion. miR-409-3P, 886-5P, 324-3P, 222, 125A-5P, 339-3P, 155) that were elevated before MSC administration, showed a significant decline within 24 hours after infusion. a transient increase in these miRNA levels was observed by day 7 in patient 1 and had returned to normal by day 28. compared with unprimed MSCs, primed MSCs upregulated cell surface expression of CD54 (ICAM-1), CD106 (VCAM-1), and HLA-ABC and HLA-DR. subsequently, the expression levels of surface markers by control or LPS-stimulated PMNs were investigated after 40 hours of direct coculture with either MSCs or pMSCs. in the absence of LPS, PMN survival was enhanced only in presence of pMSCs in selected experiments, MSCs were exposed to IFN- and TNF- for 48 hours. after priming, IDO expression was substantially upregulated as assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction compared with untreated MSCs. the percentage of CD11b-positive PMNs was higher in the presence of MSCs and further enhanced by LPS treatment. PMNs showed a hypersegmented nuclear morphology after coculture with both resting (PMN MSCs at 24 hours) and pMSCs (PMN pMSCs at 24 hours) MSCs were also capable of promoting the induction and expansion of immune suppressive CD4+CD25highCD127low TRegs. increased levels of circulating CD4+CD25highCD127low TRegs were also observed up to 20 days after MSC administration. a subpopulation of PMNs and monocytes, termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), exert immune regulatory effects. they are often increased in inflammatory or inflammatory-like conditions such as cancer, where they are postulated to act as an intrinsic negative feedback mechanism. preclinical data have pointed toward beneficial effects [42] thymic emigrants among CD45RA+ nave TRegs in both patients. findings suggest recovery from acute lung injury involves upregulation of TRegs [47] proteome Characterization of Donor MSCs and Derived Extracellular Vesicles. a relatively poor correlation of protein abundance was observed between EVs and cells. a relatively poor correlation of protein abundance was observed between EVs and cells. this indicates that EVs are not formed by lysed cells but rather result from selective protein packing into vesicles. additional GO enrichment data on biological processes, molecular function, cellular component, protein class, and pathways can be found in the supplemental online data (supplemental online Fig. 6A\u20136E) clinical improvement was observed in both patients with severe refractory ARDS. no increase in inflammatory indices has been reported in clinical trials of MSCs given to severely immunoincompetent recipients. the second patient mainly had severe respiratory failure but nonetheless demonstrated an improvement in clinical status after MSC administration. similar trends in inflammatory indices were observed. the dose used in these patients was based on previous use of MSCs in GVHD patients [27]. the study of systemic MSC administration in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also used an empiric approach for multiple dosing. previous clinical studies have indicated that in vitro assays can correlate with ex vivo observations. the role of TRegs in ARDS is complex, and it is unclear if the promotion of PMN survival, activation, and/or increase in MDSC subsets will indicate beneficial clinical effects. however, the correlation between the induction of TRegs in vivo and increased levels of circulating TRegs in vivo is striking. in vitro experiments mimicked an inflammatory milieu by pretreating ex vivo expanded MSCs with IFN- and TNF-. this is an established technique that can be performed to assess MSCs\u2019 immune modulatory potency. the standard immune plasticity assay based on IFN-, with or without TNF- is a good model of in vitro priming to assess the immune regulatory properties of MSCs. some of the therapeutic effects of MSCs in ARDS are likely mediated by the release of soluble proteins and EVs. some of these proteins and pathways were identified in the MSCs and EVs that have been suggested as potentially associated with the therapeutic effects in other disease models. this includes pathways associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor activation. the use of freshly thawed vs. cultured MSCs has been shown to result in different effects in the in vitro mixed lymphocyte reactions. the use of freshly thawed vs. cultured MSCs has been shown to result in different effects in the in vitro mixed lymphocyte reactions.
