{"summary": "patient 1 was a 32-year-old male tv producer in whom fever and headache developed on December 16, 2003. patient 3 was a 20-year-old female waitress who became ill on December 26. all patients had temperatures >38\u00b0C and x-ray evidence of pneumonia. SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, coV, coronavirus, RT-PCR, reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction, IFA, immunofluorescence assay. serum samples were tested by laboratories B, C, and D for neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV by microneutralization assay. the neutralization titer was measured as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited Vero E6 cell lysis in at least two of the three triplicate wells. diluted serum specimens were added to lysate\u2013coated wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. lysate (Urbani strain) or vero E6 cell lysate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. plates were incubated with goat anti-human immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and IgM conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. titer for a specimen was taken as the highest dilution that had a positive adjusted OD value >0.21. the immunofluorescence titer was taken as the highest dilution that showed a positive reaction (apple green fluorescent cytoplasmic granules) laboratory C performed a similar IFA but modified it to use SARS-CoV (strain 6109)\u2013infected FRhK4 cells. 50 L of heat-inactivated human and animal control hyperimmune serum samples were serially twofold diluted in 10% FBS-DMEM in triplicate wells. each sample was diluted in duplicate 96-well tissue culture plates followed by adding 100 TCID50 of 229E or OC43. plates were incubated at 33\u00b0C in 6% CO2 for 5 days. a tetra-methyl benzidine substrate was added and incubated for 15 min. the colorometric reaction was stopped with 2 mol/L phosphoric acid. the highest dilution showing a >0.1 OD was taken as the virus-specific IgG antibody titer. culture Virus isolation was attempted on RT-PCR\u2013positive respiratory specimens collected from patients 1 and 2 by methods previously described (2). patients and Specimens From December 16, 2003, to January 8, 2004, four SARS cases were identified in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. initial tests by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong Province and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangzhou were positive for SARS-CoV. confirmatory testing was performed by the Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention and Institute for Communicable Infection Disease. SARS-CoV microneutralization assay Serum specimens were tested by laboratories B, C, and D for neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV by microneutralization assay. a total of 75 PFU of SARS-CoV was added to the diluted serum samples and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. the wells were rinsed with a wash solution and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. a substrate solution was added to wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min in the dark. optical density (OD) measured using 450 nm with a reference wavelength at 630 nm. dilutions were measured at 410 nm and 490 nm wavelength. the titer for a specimen was the highest dilution that had a positive adjusted OD value >0.21. the slides were rinsed twice, mounted with phosphate-buffered glycerol and coverslip. RD cells were grown to 80%\u201390% confluence in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% defined fetal bovine serum (FBS) 229E (ATCC VR-740) and OC43 (ATCC VR-759) were introduced onto the washed monolayers. cultures were incubated at 33\u00b0C with 6% CO2 for 5 days. at 33\u00b0C in 6% CO2 for 5 days, a back titration was included in each test. OC43 Immunofluorescence Assay Laboratory performed an in-house IFA. but it was modified to use OC43-infected RD cells. a titer rise of more than fourfold between early and late serum pairs was considered evidence of recent infection with OC43 or 229E. diluted serum specimens were tested by laboratories B, C, and D for neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV. the wells were rinsed with a wash solution and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. a substrate solution was added to wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. the optical density (OD) measured using 450 nm. s were measured at 410 nm and 490 nm wavelength. the adjusted sum OD for the 1:100 through 1:6,400 dilutions exceeded 1.25. the titer of a specimen was the highest dilution that had a positive adjusted OD value >0.21. 229E and OC43 were introduced onto the washed monolayers. cultures were incubated at 33\u00b0C with 6% CO2 for 5 days. infected wells were identified by an immunofluorescence assay. OC43 Immunofluorescence Assay Laboratory C performed an in-house IFA. but it was modified to use OC43-infected BSC-1 cells. 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C. OC43/229E RT-PCR was performed on throat swabs by degenerated consensus PCR primers for the genus Coronavirus by using the SuperScript One Step RT-PCR kit. RT-PCR was carried out by using the method previously described (15). laboratory D used real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays from several different sources. RT-PCR was performed on throat swabs by degenerated consensus PCR primers for the genus Coronavirus by using the SuperScript One Step RT-PCR kit. new modified DMEM with 2% fetal calf serum was added. cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with rocking. negative cultures for SARS-CoV were confirmed by RT-PCR. 12 128 1,280 64 160 13 128 1,280 15 64 + 6,400 400 22 64 6,400 160 2 (onset 12/26/2003) 6 10 10 8 40 7 4 20 + 80 100 8 8 40 1,600 160 160 9 80 160 10 80 160 11 16 6,400 160 17 + 6,400 1,600 16 160 19 16 21 6,400 160 22 16 3 (onset 12/30/2003) earliest acute-phase serum specimens for patients 2\u20134 were unavailable for these tests. cOC43 and 229E neutralization tests were conducted by laboratory D only. cOC43 and 229E neutralization tests were conducted by laboratory D only. RT-PCR\u2013positive throat swabs were collected on days 6, 8, and 10 for patient 1 and on days 6 and 8 for patient 2. none of the other types of specimens tested positive for SARS-CoV RNA. only the throat swab collected on day 6 from patient 1 had sufficient viral RNA for the initial sequencing studies. aSARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus; RT-PCR, reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction; +, positive,\u2013, negative. bNumber of days the specimen was collected. cSpecimens tested by government Virus Unit, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. all four patients had detectable SARS-CoV antibodies by one or more laboratories early in the illness. serum specimens collected 6 days after onset from patients 1 and 2 were positive by all laboratories by one or more methods. dSpecimens tested by government Virus Unit, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, with a subset tested by Department of Microbiology, Queen Mary Hospital. a concurrent rise in OC43 antibodies was detected by IFA (laboratory C) in patient 4. 29E and were detected at a lower titer to OC43 than to SARS-CoV. previous studies have shown a lack of SARS-CoV antibodies in paired serum specimens from patients with acute 229E and OC43 infections. only the throat swab collected on day 6 from patient 1 had sufficient viral RNA for the initial sequencing studies. sequences were confirmed to be SARS-CoV and most closely matched isolates from civet cats taken in November and December from wild animal markets in Guangdong Province. cSpecimens tested by government Virus Unit, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, with a subset tested by department of microbiology, Queen Mary Hospital. the specimen was collected after symptom onset. antibody testing provided a relatively early indication of SARS-CoV infection in all four patients, as early as 6 days but no later than 9 days after onset of illness. a longer incubation period, possibly because of low virus inoculum, could have provided additional time to mount an antibody response. authors noted that the S protein gene had a higher ratio of coding to noncoding changes in the early stages of the outbreak, compared with later stages. this finding is consistent with findings from other coronaviruses that amino acid changes in the S protein can affect tissue tropism and disease associated with infection. test samples and proficiency panels allow laboratories to assess their assays' performance and guidelines for specimen management. rapid identification and confirmation of SARS-CoV infection in these four cases exemplify the successful collaboration between local and WHO Network Laboratories."}
