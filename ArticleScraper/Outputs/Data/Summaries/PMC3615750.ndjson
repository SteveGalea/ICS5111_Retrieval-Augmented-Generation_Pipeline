{"summary": "in 2003, a communicable respiratory disease known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), later found to be caused by a previously unknown coronavirus, rapidly spread from china to 37 countries. in the summer of 2008, peppers containing Salmonella serotype Saintpaul caused the largest recorded food borne outbreak in the united states. these new and emerging diseases pose widespread public health risks. prototype AKR is an electronic collection of all active public health alerts of importance to the health care of the population. AKR is an electronic collection of all active public health alerts of importance to the health care of the population. the nationalwide health information network (NHIN) will support requests for de-identified health information, with the possibility of case follow up in the event of a public health emergency. the network will support requests for de-identified health information, with the possibility of case follow up in the event of a public health emergency. the public health alerting approach described herein has the potential to improve patient treatment and care in the face of developing disease outbreaks. the aim of this research is to demonstrate an easy-to-use technical architecture and prototype system to improve communication between public health officials and clinicians. the AKR must provide an alert management web interface for public health officials to author, monitor, and maintain alerts within the repository. the AKR must include a correlating function that matches the characteristics of a patient\u2019s present illness with elements of the case definition in the public health alert. the prototype AKR system was developed and demonstrated on the basis of the functional requirement described above. the InfoShare application was originally designed to provide a simple and structured method for sharing public health information among public health jurisdictions. the application was modified to provide for the posting of public health alerts derived from epidemiological investigations or from automated syndromic surveillance system alerts. the public health officials can then automatically upload the alert information via the AMWI interface. public health official may enter text comments and color code them according to their level of concern. only a limited number of fields in the alert message are shown in Figure 3. health alerts residing in the AKR database are available for retrieval. the AKR has an EMR interface that allows a user of an EMR to view patient-specific alerts contained within the AKR. the proposed Infobutton function generates a query to the AKR to see if patient-specific information matches an active public health alert. the query generates a de-identified profile that includes basic demographic data and symptom information. er is a natural language processing system that can parse a chief complaint text into disease-related syndrome categories. in the AKR, these categories are mapped via a lookup table to a set of diseases/conditions that are matched in the public health alert. the AKR contains an alert that closely matches the patient\u2019s parameters. the AMWI allows the public health official to create an alert. the AMWI contains authoring tools and a viewer. if the public health entity uses the ESSENCE disease surveillance system [13], alert parameters can be transferred to AKR automatically. the AMWI interface allows users to quickly search for alerts within the AKR. the search criteria at the top of the AMWI display provides a filter for disease categories and concern levels for alerts that are contained within the AKR. the alerts in the AKR are matched with the clinician\u2019s EMR-based query. the de-identified patient profile is produced by the clinician\u2019s EMR-based query. the chief complaint is a brief description of the patient\u2019s stated or primary reason for the health care visit. a sample web page returned by the AKR in response to a T.81 query is shown in Figure 8. HTTP Formatted Results for a Health Alert Query Each alert message is a structured collection of fixed-value and free-form data fields. the structure supported the development of a fully configurable repository with fields that sufficiently describe the alert. AKR service uses a web-based secure interface to allow public health officials and clinicians to view and query a database of public health alerts created by public health officials. alerts contain information that may include free text descriptions and interpretations, links to Web sites with additional text and graphical information, and color-coded levels of concern provided by the public health official. alerts are not constantly re-transmitted for a given patient profile. the clinician is immediately able to determine if the patient they are seeing is potentially part of a larger public health concern. by improving communication between public health officials and clinicians, the AKR potentially may help improve patient care."}
