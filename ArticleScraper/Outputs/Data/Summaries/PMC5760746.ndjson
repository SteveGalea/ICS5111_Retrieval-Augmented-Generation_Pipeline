{"summary": "powassan virus is the only member of the tick-borne encephalitis complex (TBE-C) of viruses, which are transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. other members of the TBE-C include the following flaviviruses: tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in eastern Europe and Western Asia, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus in siberia, Kyasanur Forest disease virus in India, alkhurma virus in Saudi the potential for concurrent transmission with other tick-borne pathogens, particularly Borrelia burgdorferi, has not been previously studied in North America. a serologic test panel for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to POWV in serum and plasma samples has been unavailable in the united states. a sample dilution of 1:20 for IgM and 1:40 for POWV IgG IFAs demonstrated the optimal balance between sensitivity and nonspecific background staining. a PRNT90 titer of 1:20 was determined to be the limit of detection (LOD) for the serologic test panel. a sample known to be positive for YFV IgG antibodies (vaccinee 3) had a positive POWV IgG IFA result at a 1:20 dilution but was negative at a 1:40 dilution. a sample known to be positive for YFV IgG antibodies (vaccinee 3) had a positive POWV IgG IFA result at a 1:20 dilution. only one recent YFV vaccine sample demonstrated cross-reactivity in the POWV IgG IFAs when assayed at optimal screening dilutions. only one recent YFV vaccine sample demonstrated cross-reactivity when assayed at optimal screening dilutions.

EI-2661-9601G) and anti-TBEV ELISA IgM (Euroimmun catalog no. EI-2661-9601M) assays employ inactivated TBEV antigens of strain K23. optimum density (OD ratio) values were calculated for each sample in reference to a calibrator provided with the test kit. slides were incubated for 30 min and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline. 50 l of DyLight 488 anti-human IgG (Vector Laboratories) diluted 1:300 or 50 l of fluorescein anti-human IgM (mu-specific) secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) diluted 1:200 was added to each well. all 100 non-TBD samples were tested for TBE-C and WNV by EIA. samples with higher-than-baseline OD ratios were tested with the optimized POWV IFA. the heterologous-flavivirus sample set consists of 11 human serum/plasma samples known to be IgM antibody positive and 12 samples known to be IgG antibody positive to heterologous flaviviruses. the tick-borne disease sample set consists of 106 serum/plasma samples submitted for Lyme disease testing from patients residing in Wisconsin, an area in which Lyme disease is endemic (23). disease is endemic consists of 100 serum/plasma samples collected from patients without symptoms of TBD and without history or evidence of recent tick exposure. the samples were collected locally for biospecimen banking, in the northeastern region of the united states. vero cells infected with POWV were grown on eight-well chamber slides. slides were warmed for 30 min in a humidity chamber at room temperature. slides were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline. negative-control samples were included in all IFA runs. titrations of fluorochrome-conjugated anti-human secondary antibodies were performed. low-PRNT90-titer samples were analyzed in duplicate assays. sensitivity was determined using the arbovirus encephalitis panel. limit of detection was calculated as the lowest PRNT90 titer detected in the POWV IgG assay."}
