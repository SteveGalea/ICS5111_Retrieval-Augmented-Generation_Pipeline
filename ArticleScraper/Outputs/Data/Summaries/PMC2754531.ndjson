{"summary": "IBV is a highly infectious pathogen of domestic fowl that replicates primarily in the respiratory tract but also in epithelial cells of other organs. IBV has a 27.6 kb RNA genome and is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis. pp1ab is an extension product of pp1a as a result of a -1 ribosomal shift mechanism. the two polyproteins are cleaved by two types of virus-encoded proteinases. the IBV accessory genes are not required for replication in vitro. however, we could not determine any role of the IBV accessory proteins in pathogenicity. virulent virus (M41) altered the tropism of the rIBV and restored immunogenicity for subsequent challenge with M41. recombinant IBVs consisted of the replicase gene from the avirulent Beaudette strain and the structural and accessory genes from the virulent M41 isolate of IBV. the growth of IBV in chick kidney cells was as described previously [31]\u2013[33]. plasmid, pGPT-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-3UTR, consisted of the 3\u2032-end of the replicase gene of Beau-R. the region of the M41-CK genome encoding the structural and accessory genes terminated by the M41-CK derived 3\u2032UTR. rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-3UTR was fused to the truncated recombination events resulted in either rVV-BeauR-Rep--Struct (no modification) or in rVV-BeauR-Rep--M41-Struct. a potential recombination event is indicated between the 1416 nt of the Beau-R replicase gene sequence common to both constructs. randomly selected MPA resistant rVVs were grown and plaque purified three times using vero cells in the absence of selection medium. this resulted in a second recombination event involving the loss of the GPT gene from the rVVs. either generation of an IBV cDNA corresponding to the sequence in rVV-BeauR-Rep-Struct or a full-length IBV cDNA consisting of a Beau-R the 3\u2032-UTR from Beau-R results in a 667 bp product but a 483 bp PCR from M41-CK. rVV, rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct, contained a full-length IBV cDNA consisting of the replicase gene from Beau-R and the rest of the genome derived from IBV M41-CK. rIBVs in tracheal organ cultures were prepared from 19-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) Rhode Island Red chicken embryos. group of five TOCs were inoculated with 0.5 ml of medium containing 5.4104 PFU/ml of each virus. after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. birds in mock-infected group were inoculated with serum-free BES medium. snicking, tracheal rales, wheezing, nasal discharge, watery eyes and ciliary activity of the trachea. birds were checked individually for presence of tracheal rales, nasal discharge, watery eyes and wheezing. IBV and 24 h post-infection medium was collected, diluted 110 and used to infect a new monolayer of CK cells. total RNA was extracted from the P25 infected CK cells. RT-PCR was used to generate a series of overlapping PCR products covering the complete genome of the P25 rIBV. plasmid, pGPT-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-3UTR, consisted of the 3\u2032-end of the replicase gene of Beau-R. the region of the M41-CK genome encoding the structural and accessory genes terminated by the M41-CK derived 3\u2032UTR. rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-3UTR was fused to the truncated recombination events resulted in either rVV-BeauR-Rep--Struct (no modification) or in rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct (no modification) or in rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct; the desired rVV. randomly selected MPA resistant rVVs were grown and plaque purified three times using vero cells in the absence of selection medium. this resulted in a second recombination event involving the loss of the GPT gene from the rVVs. either generation of an IBV cDNA corresponding to the sequence in rVV-BeauR-Rep-Struct or a full-length IBV cDNA consisting of a Beau-R the 3\u2032-UTR from Beau-R results in a 667 bp product but a 483 bp PCR from M41-CK. rVV, rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct, contained a full-length IBV cDNA consisting of the replicase gene from Beau-R. the rest of the genome derived from IBV M41-CK was identified and used for further work. tracheal organ cultures were prepared from 19-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) Rhode Island Red chicken embryos. group of five TOCs, in triplicate, were inoculated with 0.5 ml of medium containing 5.4104 PFU/ml of each virus. after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove residual virus. birds in mock-infected group were inoculated with serum-free BES medium. snicking, tracheal rales, wheezing, nasal discharge, watery eyes and ciliary activity. birds were checked individually for presence of tracheal rales, nasal discharge, watery eyes and wheezing. RT-PCR was used to generate a series of overlapping PCR products covering the complete genome of the P25 rIBV. a full-length IBV-derived cDNA was generated by homologous recombination using the TDS method. following TDS, DNA was extracted from 20 rVVs, potentially containing the chimaeric IBV full-length cDNA. two rVVs, rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 and rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12, were recovered from DNA extracted from rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 and rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12. rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41- the transfected CK cells (P0) were incubated until they showed a cytopathic effect. the medium was filtered to remove any rFPV/T7 and any potential rIBV passaged three times more on CK cells (P3) total RNA from the infected P3 CK cells was extracted and analysed by RT-PCR and spot sequence analysis. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12 contained an extra a characterisation of the rIBV in vitro The titres of the progeny viruses were analysed over a 96 h post-infection period. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 reached peak titres by 24 h post-infection. but the titre of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was approximately 1 log10 lower. p-M41-Struct-2-P3 washed and incubated for 96 h after 1 h at 37\u00b0C. each titration value is the mean of three replicates. each titration value is the mean of three replicates. tracheas isolated from chickens showed wheezing by 7 days post-inoculation. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 infected chickens had >95% ciliary activity. chickens inoculated with M41-CK showed 0% ciliary activity (100% ciliostasis. the average titre of M41-CK, isolated from the tracheas of the three chickens, was 4.1 log10 CD50/ml. if any virus was present in the tracheas of the chickens infected with either Beau-R or rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 the amounts present were at least 4 log10 CD50/ml lower than the M41-CK detected from the chickens. tracheal epithelial cells isolated from chickens infected with M41-CK were positive for the presence of M41-CK-derived RNA. no IBV-derived RNA was detected in the tracheal epithelial cells of chickens infected with either Beau-R or rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 supporting our virus isolation data. RT-PCR analyses were performed using oligonucleotides located at the end of the N gene and at the end of the 3\u2032-UTR. lanes 1\u20133 correspond to tracheal epithelial cell extracts from chicks infected with (1) Beau-R; (2) rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 and (3) M41-CK. previous work demonstrated that our rIBVs, Beau-R and Beau rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 replicated and produced progeny virus in TOCs. group of five TOCs were infected with 0.5 ml of 5.4104 PFU/ml of Beau-R, M41-CK or rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3. p-M41-Struct-2 all growth experiments were carried out using virus that had been passaged three times (P3) in CK cells. the rIBV, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2, showed slightly reduced growth properties when compared with both parental viruses, Beau-R and M41-CK. if the two UTRs interact this could affect the growth properties of the recombinant viruses. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 rIBV grew to a higher titre than rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 at 24 h post-infection. rIBV grew to a higher titre than rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 at 24 h post-infection. the growth profiles of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 from passage 25 were compared to those of Beau-R and rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 in (A) CKCs and (B) TOCs to determine whether passage resulted in an altered growth profile. the viruses were analysed as described in Fig. 2 for CKCs and in Fig. 5 for TOCs. rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 and rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 sequences arose on further passage of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3. the two nucleotide changes within the ORF 5b sequence, nucleotides 25815 and 25816 (UUAA), rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was a mixed population. it appeared both substitutions occurred simultaneously. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 preferentially contained substituted nucleotides. two rVVs, rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 and rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12, were recovered from DNA extracted from rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 and rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12. rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41- total RNA from the infected CK cells was extracted and analysed. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12 contained an extra adenosine nucleotide. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12 contained an extra adenosine nucleotide at position 25317 in a six base polyadenosine repeat sequence within the M41 intergenic region between the end of the M rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was analysed over a 96 h post-infection period. the titres of the progeny viruses were analysed over a 96 h post-infection period. twelve one-day-old chickens were inoculated with 0.1 ml of 106 PFU/ml of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2, M41-CK or Beau-R. the birds were observed for clinical signs up to 11 days post-inoculation. only chickens inoculated with M41-CK showed any clinical signs of an IBV infection. BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 infected chickens had >95% ciliary activity. chickens inoculated with M41-CK showed 0% ciliary activity (100% ciliostasis; Fig. 3D) rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was not pathogenic. the amounts present were at least 4 log10 CD50/ml lower than the M41-CK detected from the tracheas of the chickens infected with either Beau-R or rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2. if any virus was present in the tracheas of the chickens infected with either Beau-R or rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2. no IBV-derived RNA was detected in the tracheal epithelial cells of chickens infected with either Beau-R or rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2. this was consistent with previous results suggesting that Beau-R probably does not reach the tracheas of infected chickens. rIBVs, Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) caused ciliostasis of infected TOCs with concomitant production of progeny virus. rIBVs, Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S), caused ciliostasis of infected TOCs with concomitant production of progeny virus. the titre of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was between 1-2 log10 units lower than the titres observed for M41-CK and Beau-R respectively. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 replicated and produced progeny virus. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 showed slightly reduced growth properties compared with both parental viruses, Beau-R and M41-CK. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 grew in TOCs but did not cause ciliostasis, which is induced by both parental viruses. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 grew to a higher titre than rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 at 24 h post-infection. growth properties of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 were then studied in TOCs. analysis of TOCs infected with rBeauR-Rep-M41-St no nucleotide changes were found within the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR sequences of the rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 virus. rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 genome sequence. rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 genome sequence was sequenced. ides 25815 and 25816 (UUAA) resulted in the introduction of a premature stop codon in ORF 5b and a modification of the N gene transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) from UUCUUAACAA to AACUUAACAA. at P5, the AA mutation was more prominent than the parental (UU) sequence. dette strain of IBV with an S gene derived from the pathogenic M41-CK isolate of IBV showed that although the S gene was responsible for tropism it was not responsible for virulence [24]\u2013[26] we could not rule out the fact that other IBV structural (E, M and N) and accessory (3a, 3b, 5a and 5b) genes may also play a role and therefore be required for the acquisition of virulence. the M41-CK-derived structural and accessory gene sequence was fused to the Beau-R replicase by homologous recombination using the TDS method [25], [37] and rIBVs were rescued in CKCs. the M41-CK IGR contains an untranslated region, the intergenic untranslated region (IGR), between the M and gene 5, which is 305 nt in Beaudette and 350 nt in M41-CK. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12, were rescued from the rVVs, rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 and rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12. analysis of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12 identified an extra adenosine nucleotide at position 25317 in a chickens infected with either rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 or Beau-R showed clinical signs of an IBV infection. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was not pathogenic indicating replacement of structural and accessory genes did not restore virulence. analysis of epithelial cells failed to detect virus from chickens infected with either Beau-R or rBeauR-Rep-M41-St rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was able to replicate in TOCs. rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was able to replicate in TOCs. no clinical signs were observed nor was any rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-derived RNA detected. rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25, on CKCs and TOCs, showed an altered growth rate in comparison to rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3. however, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 still did not cause ciliostasis in TOCs. we sequenced the entire genome of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 for comparison with the sequence in rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3. we identified three nucleotide changes between the P3 and P25 viruses. one resulted in an amino acid change, PheLeu, in the S1 region of the S gene and two adjacent nucleotides in the ORF a major difference between the two MHV isolates and the two IBV viruses was that the two MHVs were pathogenic but showed different pathogenicities, neurovirulence and hepatitis. the difference between the two IBV isolates used in this work was that one causes disease and the other does not. the nucleotide changes resulted in eight amino acid changes in the replicase protein, eight amino acid changes in the S protein and one amino acid in ORF 5a and the N protein. the authors were unable to confirm which amino acid changes were responsible for loss of pathogenicity. results from work described here have shown that replacing all the structural and accessory proteins with those from a virulent isolate of IBV did not restore virulence. generation of the rIBV produced in this work can either be viewed as replacing the structural and accessory genes of an avirulent virus with those of a virulent virus."}
