{"summary": "a prospective population study was conducted during the 2009 austral winter. antibodies to pH1N1/2009v were titered using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) titers 1/40 were considered positive. the first cases of acute respiratory infections caused by a novel triple-reassortant influenza virus, pH1N1/2009v, occurred in Mexico and the united states [1]. the rapid spread of infection to other continents led the world health organization to declare on 11 June 2009 that a pandemic of pH1N1/2009v influenza was under way. a significant proportion of infections are asymptomatic or mild [3]. a prospective population serosurvey was conducted in Reunion Island during the outbreak in the 2009 austral winter season. prevalence of infection was assessed on a weekly basis and seroconversion rates were measured using paired sera. a pre-existing sample of 2442 households established in October 2006 for the investigation of the Chikungunya outbreak. 8\u00b0C associated with any respiratory or systemic symptom led to three consecutive visits of a nurse to the incident case-dwelling. at week 45, the active inquiry was discontinued and a second (post-epidemic) serum sample (sample 2) was obtained (weeks 45\u201352) to determine seroconversion rates. hemagglutinating titer of the non inactivated viral antigen was immediately determined under the HIA format described below. dilution providing 5.33 hemagglutinating units in a volume of 25 L was used for subsequent HIA. four successive phases were identified throughout the pandemic wave. phase A (weeks 30\u201331) corresponded to early epidemic time, phase B (W32\u201339) to the epidemic unfolding, phase C (W40\u201344) to the immediate post-epidemic stage and phase D (W45\u201352) to the late post-epidemic stage. data entry used EpiData version 3.1 (The Epidata Association, Odense, Denmark) SAS version 9.1 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for statistical analysis. the characteristics of the study cohort were compared to those of the population of Reunion Island. the coPanFLu-RUN was part of the coPanFLu international project. we used a pre-existing sample of 2442 households established in October 2006 for the investigation of the Chikungunya outbreak. a first serum sample (sample 1) was obtained from each household member. the protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and French law for biomedical research (N\u00b0 ID RCB AFSSAPS: 2009-A00689-48) every eligible person was asked for giving their written informed consent. dilution providing 5.33 hemagglutinating units in a volume of 25 L was used for subsequent HIA. sera were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min prior to use. human red blood cells (RBC) were used for hemagglutination experiments. the antigen was prepared by diluting a non-inactivated cell culture supernatant producing a pdm H1N1v strain. the virus was propagated onto MDCK cells under standard conditions. the last passage (used for antigen preparation) was performed in the absence of trypsin and ht-FBS. seropositivity was defined as a HIA titer of 1/40 or more. baseline-proxy seroprevalence rate was estimated on serum samples collected in phase A. seroconversion was defined as shift from seronegative at inclusion (sample 1: HIA 1/40) to seropositive on follow-up. the sample size was calculated for identifying risk factors in the prospective cohort study. the study allowed 1\u20132% absolute precision around the estimated values for seroconversion rates. the children and adolescents (20 yrs), young adults (20\u201339 yrs), middle-age adults (40\u201359 yrs), and elderly adults (60 yrs) compared to the community of Reunion Island, the sample of 1,687 individuals for

phase B (W32\u201339); early post-epidemic phase C (W40\u201344) and late post epidemic phase D (W45\u201352) seronegation rates were 27.0% (61/226) for all age groups, 17.4% (12/69) in children and adolescents (20 yrs), 32.3% (41/127) in adults (20\u201359 yrs) and 26.7% (8/30) in the elderly (60 yrs). the seroconversion rate of this group is the most indicative of the exposure of individuals to the whole epidemic wave. it was the highest (63,2%, P0.0001) in children and adolescents (20 yrs) and still significantly high in adults (39.4%, P0.0001) seroconversion was defined as a shift from seronegative at inclusion (i.e. HIA titer 1/40) to seropositive on follow-up sample, or as a 4-fold increase of reciprocal HIA titer between first and second samples for sera tested seropositive on inclusion (i.e. HIA titer 1/40) no subject with a HIA titer superior to 1/40 had evidence of seroconversion to pH1N 0.008) for age 20 years (vs age 60 years) and 11.35 (95%CI: 0.41\u20134.47, P = 0.62) for age 20\u201360 years (vs age 60 years). seroconversion rates according to age and baseline-proxy HIA titer are displayed Figure 4. paired sera tested seropositive at 1/40, 1/40, 1/80 and 1/160. initial HIA antibody titers were 1/40, 1/40, 1/40, 1/80 and 1/160. 43 individuals out of 46 were tested seropositive at HIA titer 1/40. HI assay detected seroprotective antibody titers in 93.5% and gave evidence seroconversion in 73.9% of qRT-PCR confirmed pH1N1/2009 influenza. this is confirmed by the fact that our HI assay detected seroprotective antibody titers in 93.5% and gave evidence seroconversion in 73.9% of qRT-PCR confirmed pH1N1/2009 influenza. a substantial proportion of Reunion Island's population had pre-existing immunity to 2009 pandemic influenza virus with the highest baseline-proxy seroprevalence rate. other studies from all continents had also reported high pre-epidemic seropositivity rates among the elderly [5], [6], [8], [22]\u2013[26]. 66,915 people in Reunion Island who consulted a physician were infected by the pH1N1/2009 virus during the 9 weeks of the epidemic, giving a cumulative attack rate of 8.26%. a similar conclusion was also drawn from Australia [34]; iii) our serological test might detect cross-reactive antibodies triggered by recent vaccination with trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine as reported [4], [35]\u2013[39]. a large fraction (almost two thirds) of those who got infected by pH1N1/2009 virus escaped medical detection, probably because they developed mild disease or asymptomatic infection. the cumulative incidence rates of infection by the pandemic virus in children were 20 to 40 times higher than that estimated from clinical surveillance. this level of pre-existing cross reactive immunity likely confers true protection against infection. a decline in antibody titers occurred shortly after the passage of the epidemic wave. this decline was significant enough to bring, within a few weeks, almost 27% of sera that tested positive. this decay accounts for the observation that older adults were almost completely spared by the epidemic if one only considers cumulative incidence rates derived from IHA titration. the epidemic progression coincided with the implementation of the prospective study. we used as proxy base line seroprevalence data from individuals recruited. this may overestimate the base line immunity if subclinical community transmission had occurred before the first cases of pH1N1/2009 influenza were reported."}
