{"summary": "human rhinoviruses are classified into three species (A, B and C) within the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. HRVs mainly cause upper respiratory tract infections. however, they can also cause lower respiratory infections. 3714 respiratory specimens from 2608 patients were sent to the laboratory of virology of Lille University Hospital Center for testing in a multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) for respiratory viruses. the diagnostics for respiratory viruses was prescribed by the physician in charge of the patient. if the HRV/enterovirus type differed between the first and the last specimen of a patient, specimens obtained in between those were not submitted to typing. a patient who was included in the \u201cpersistent infection\u201d group was not included in the \u201creinfection\u201d group even if he/she had an episode of reinfection with another HRV type. specimen with detection of HRV/enterovirus followed by a specimen without HRV/enterovirus detection taken between 3 and 44 days after the positive specimen HRV +-. all specimens were negative for HRV/enterovirus Detection of respiratory viruses Respiratory specimens were stored at -80\u00b0C before RNA extraction. RNA was submitted to a commercially available multiplex RT-PCR that screens for a panel of respiratory viral pathogens. the detection limit for sensitivity of the RV16 assay is 50 copies/reaction, corresponding to 3125 copies/mL of respiratory specimen. the detection limit of the RV12 assay is not indicated by the manufacturer. sequences were assembled and aligned to HRV/enterovirus genomes. sequences were aligned and phylogenetic trees were constructed using mega-Software (MEGA 6 [27] to confirm nearest HRV/enterovirus type. a neighbour joining tree of partial VP4/VP2 sequences was constructed by using MEGA 6 [27]. the numbers indicate the patients and the letters the specimens, with A being the first chronologically. the percentage of bootstraps that supports the corresponding clade is shown at the nodes if higher than 70%. 3714 respiratory specimens from 2608 patients were sent to the laboratory of virology of Lille University Hospital Center for testing in a multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) for respiratory viruses. no systematic virological surveillance is performed for respiratory viruses, even in severely immunocompromised patients, such as stem cell transplant recipients. a patient who was included in the \u201cpersistent infection\u201d group was not included in the \u201creinfection\u201d group even if he/she had an episode of reinfection with another HRV type. patients were included in the \u201ccleared infection\u201d group if they had detection of different HRV/enterovirus types in two or more respiratory specimens. a patient who was included in the \u201cpersistent infection\u201d group was not included in the \u201creinfection\u201d group even if he/she had an episode of reinfection with another HRV type. patients were included in the \u201ccleared infection\u201d group if they had detection of different HRV/enterovirus types in two or more respiratory specimens. lower respiratory tract specimens (URT) are bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, bronchial or tracheal aspirates. HRV++ detection in two or more respiratory specimens HRV++ 45 days. RNA was extracted using the Magtration System 12GC. virus A and B, human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43, parainfluenza virus 1\u20133, HRV A/B (Seeplex RV12 ACE Detection, Seegene, Seoul, Korea) from January to September 2012 (235 specimens, 6.3%) and to a commercially available multiplex RT-PCR that screens for a panel of respiratory viral pathogens including influenza virus A and B RT/Platinum Taq Mix was performed with the following thermal profile: 30 minutes (min) at 45\u00b0C, 2 min at 94\u00b0C followed by 4 cycles of 30 seconds (s) at 94\u00b0C, 30s at 46\u00b0C and 1 min 30s at 68\u00b0C, followed by 36 cycles of 30s at 94\u00b0C, 30s at 53\u00b0C and 1 min 30s at 68\u00b0C. sequences were aligned and phylogenetic trees were constructed using Mega-Software (MEGA 6 [27]) using both neighbour joining and maximum likelihood methods. phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the HRV/enterovirus VP4/VP2 region. continuous non-parametric variables were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. if the difference between the three groups was significant, pairwise comparisons were performed. logistic regression with stepwise backward variable selection was performed comparing the persistence group with a combined group including both patients with cleared infection and reinfection. Typing was successful in 137 of 139 (98.6%) specimens from 52 patients. 77 were HRV-A (56.2%), 28 were HRV-B (20.4%), 30 were HRV-C (21.9%) and 2 were Coxsackievirus A21 (1.5%). 18 out of 51 patients had detection of the same HRV/enterovirus type in at least two respiratory specimens taken at least 45 days apart. enterovirus positive specimen followed by a HRV/enterovirus negative specimens at an interval of 3 to 44 days. these patients were included in the cleared infection group (Fig 1). Age was significantly different between the three groups. variables age and hematologic disorder were associated with persistent infection in logistic regression analaysis. b Kruskal-Wallis test; post-hoc test showed that age is different between the cleared infection versus persistent infection groups (p = 0.005) and reinfection versus persistent infection groups (p = 0.004) but not between the cleared infection versus reinfection groups (p = 1.00) the nearest HRV/enterovirus type, the duration of virus shedding, the respiratory site of the HRV/enterovirus detection and other respiratory viruses that were detected are shown in S3 Table. the nearest HRV/enterovirus type, the duration of virus shedding, the respiratory site of the HRV/enterovirus detection and other respiratory viruses that were detected were shown. the largest case series of persistent HRV/enterovirus infections so far published. most patients in this study were hospitalized (54/76, 71.1%) and immunosuppression was frequent (47/76, 61.8%). the minimum median duration of HRV/enterovirus persistence in our patients was 92 days, ranging from 50 to 455 days. other respiratory viruses were frequently detected in respiratory specimens of patients with persistent HRV/enterovirus infection, patients with reinfection and patients with cleared infection. in patients in which we did not find evidence for persistence, we do not have data on the duration of the infection with the different types of HRV. the fact that the second respiratory specimen was obtained at various time intervals following the first HRV/enterovirus positive specimen also impacted the \u201ccleared infection\u201d group.
