{"summary": "flooding is the most frequent natural weather disaster (30%\u201346% of natural disasters in 2004\u20132005), affecting >70 million persons worldwide each year. the most common illnesses associated with floods described in the literature are diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis (jaundice), and leptospirosis. remote imaging technologies have been used to relate sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and chlorophyll A levels to cholera outbreaks. this process used a composite environmental model that demonstrated a remarkable similarity between predicted rates based on these 3 parameters and actual incidence. the model is constantly being improved and the satellite data are becoming increasingly accurate through ground truthing. zoonotic, vector-borne, or both, have complex life histories that make predicting disease emergence or reemergence particularly difficult. climatic variables explain only 55% of spatial variation in tick-borne encephalitis in the Baltic States. satellite imaging has been used to predict the distribution of 5 of the 6 species responsible for much of the malaria transmission in Africa (13) this disease continues to devastate sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the developing world. human factors again make accurate prediction of disease events complex. glass et al. (15,16) unable to make a definitive link with precipitation events in their analyses of HPS in the southwestern united states. they found a relationship between LTM images recorded by satellite in 1992 and HPS risk the following year. the authors admit that considerable ground truthing is necessary to relate satellite imagery to the environmental variables being measured (i.e., vegetation, soil type, soil moisture) the popular press may serve an important role in increasing awareness of a heightened health risk, which promotes greater compliance with health advisories. many respiratory infections are well known as highly climate dependent or seasonal. many other infectious diseases show strong seasonality or association with climatic conditions. public health agencies in the united states and around the world are focusing on influenza preparedness. the severity of the disease raises images of the 1918 influenza epidemic on an unimaginably vast scale if the virus were to adapt to more efficient human-to-human transmission. a similar approach can be used in conjunction with the more traditional approach of analyzing bird migration patterns and poultry production. a tsunami captures the imagination of the world in a way that weeks of rainfall in the Sudan or a rise in sea surface temperature cannot. a tsunami captures the imagination of the world in a way that weeks of rainfall in the Sudan or a rise in sea surface temperature cannot. a continuing concern is the conditions that result in newly emergent virulent strains of pathogens. the scientific community is a long way from incorporating environment-gene interactions into predictive models. however, investigation of these parts of the pathogen\u2019s ecology should remain on the national research agenda as we move forward with developing predictive models of disease outbreaks. disease prediction."}
