{"summary": "antivirals and immune modulators can be considered on short- and long-term management. there is a lack of well-controlled clinical trials in cats. there are no antivirals licensed for use in veterinary medicine with the exception of several immune modulators, which have concurrent antiviral properties. immune modulators restore several functions of the immune system, allowing a better management of opportunistic infections and a better clinical recovery. interferons (IFNs) are key components of the host immune system, being particularly relevant in viral infections. ine medicine, the use of type I IFNs as immune modulation therapy is common. it inhibits oncogenic mutations induced by retroviruses. it restrains viral nucleic acid synthesis and suppress protein production. RFeIFN- is the first interferon compound licensed for use in veterinary medicine. rFeIFN- improves clinical signs and hematologic parameters in retrovirally infected cats. but it does not change hypergammaglobulinemia, proviral load, or viremia. rFeIFN- does not seem to have an anti-viral effect in vivo, and the observed clinical improvement must be related to a potential immune modulation. a previous study in cats treated with HuIFN- documented that the induced clinical improvement could be related to a recovery of serious opportunistic infections [21]. rFeIFN seems to be able to contribute to the management of this reality by improving clinical signs and decreasing concurrent viral excretion. in further studies, the influence of rFeIFN- in the acute phase reaction was investigated [28]. rFeIFN- is the first work documenting the effect of rFeIFN- on innate immunity. this study reinforces the action of this compound on the innate immune system. the evaluation of other innate immunity biomarkers (namely Mx protein) would be useful. oral protocol was 10-fold lower than licensed subcutaneous protocol. clinical improvement, concurrent viral excretion, APP profiles, and different hematology and biochemistry parameters were assessed. cats treated with oral rFeIFN- showed significant clinical improvement without remarkable changes in hematology and biochemistry profiles. authors concluded that viremia did not change in the group of FIV-infected cats treated with the licensed protocol [27]. however, in opposition to what was previously reported, a significant increase on proviral load was reported and correlated to a relative increase of lymphocytes cell count (even within the normal range) cats, mRNA expression and concurrent plasma levels of various cytokines were monitored using biological samples from the two groups of FIV-infected cats treated with either subcutaneous or oral rFEIFN- protocols [27] despite its pleiotropic effect, variations of Th-1 and Th-2 responses were assessed based on different measured cytokines. results showed that only IL-6 (a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in different immune pathways and particularly in the innate immune response) significantly changed studies have shown that IFNs can be beneficial in the early stages of HIV infection [15]. in symptomatic animals, an initial subcutaneous protocol followed by an oral continuous lower-dose therapy can now be recommended. in both groups, it was unsuccessful. the individual oral therapy for each cat was free of charge and comprised a total of 90 daily doses that were partially given to the owners at each evaluation time point. a structured prospective study would be interesting in order to evaluate not only the long-term benefits of therapy but also any effect on the mean life span of FIV-infected cats. this work presents a new oral rFeIFN- protocol, which was successfully tested and validated. this review reinforces the beneficial properties of IFN therapy. rFeIFN- is a species-specific compound, but these conclusions can be extrapolated to a larger perspective."}
