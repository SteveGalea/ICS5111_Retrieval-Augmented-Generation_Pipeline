{"summary": "despite being the simplest of biological entity, viruses play an enormously important and complex role in human and animal health, environmental ecology. despite being the simplest of biological entity, viruses play an enormously important and complex role in human and animal health, environmental ecology. in SISPA method, a primer-binding sequence(adapter) is ligated to both ends of restriction enzyme digested DNA fragments allowing their subsequent amplification using a single primer. the comprehensive identification of all viruses in a given sample poses unique challenges due to the tiny and complex nature of viral genomes. absence of conserved anchor sequences similar to the bacterial or eukaryotic ribosomal sequences prohibit pan-amplification and sequencing of viruses. metagenomics remains the most widely used approach for new virus identification and virome analysis to date. evolution and use of sequencing technologies for virus metagenomics Simple dideoxy or Sanger sequencing was not very applicable for viral metagenomics but was the only option available before 2005. pyroseqeuncing This is the first HTS technology used for metagenomics based virus discovery. the principle of 454 is sequencing-by-synthesis chemistry in which DNA molecules are amplified through an emulsion PCR, generating multiple clones of DNA using a single template. most of these viruses were identified from samples like serum, respiratory, and fecal samples. some studies used this technology to identify viruses from tissue and organ samples. this method generally allows sequencing of 500,000 to 5 million reads. hepatitis B virus (Yan et al., 2015), HCV (Gaspareto et al., 2016), polyomavirus (Anthony et al., 2013), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Kvisgaard et al., 2013), orthoreovirus (Steyer et al., 2013), bluetongue virus (Lorusso et al., 2014), rotavirus bas-congo virus (Grard et al., 2012), canine bocavirus 3 (Li et al., 2011), snake arenaviruses (Stenglein et al., 2012), snake arenaviruses (Stenglein et al., 2012), simian adenovirus c (Chiu et al., 2013), theiler\u2019s disease associated virus (Chandriani et al., single molecule sequencing is extremely well suited for virus metagenomics studies. lower throughput, higher costs per base sequencing and higher error rates currently limit the scope for the viral metagenomics study of low titer viruses. 454 sequencing was widely used to identify new viruses and virome profiles from human and animal samples. most of these viruses were identified from samples like serum, respiratory, and fecal samples. some studies used this technology to identify viruses from tissue and organ samples. Ion personal genomics machine (PGM) sequencer platforms are similar to the 454 pyrosequencing platform in template preparation and sequencing steps. adapted DNA fragments are amplified by emulsion-PCR on the surface of beads which are distributed into microwells. some studies used this technology to study viromes in skin (Bzhalava et al., 2013), ticks (Tokarz et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2015), gut virome in piglets (Kluge et al., 2016) this platform is not the ideal choice for virome study in human clinical samples due to lower outputs. high throughput and low error rates are the main reasons that Illumina technologies have dominated the viral discovery field in the past several years. high throughput, higher costs per base sequencing and higher error rates are the main reasons that Illumina technologies have dominated the viral discovery field. the nanopore platform has been used for viral detection in human clinical samples. low outputs and high error rates are a concern for virus discovery. selective sequencing approaches Currently high throughput sequencing technologies are capable of producing millions of sequence reads. several methods including ultra-filtration, iron chloride precipitation and density gradient centrifugation are available for pre-extraction virus enrichment. for the virome analysis of clinical samples with a low abundance of host cells, like cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory samples, serum, urine or stools, filtration and nuclease digestion or density centrifugation can be used as a method of pre-extraction virus enrichment. the compact nature of virions allows the use of density gradient centrifugation (sucrose, cesium chloride, polyethylene glycol) as a method to enrich samples for virus derived nucleic acids. this method was also used in the first virus metagenomics study for enriching viruses in sea water samples. nuclease treatment is not very effective in degrading unprotected nucleic acids. nuclease treatment cannot be used to find viruses in cells or tissue samples where most virus nucleic acids are not encapsidated. most recently, two very comprehensive probe sets were developed for positive selection based sequencing of all known vertebrate viruses and their variants. these methods use virus-specific probes in a liquid-phase hybridization to capture viral sequences from metagenomics libraries. VirCapSeq includes probes for all viruses known to infect vertebrates by targeting their protein coding regions. the use of VirCapSeq gained 100\u201310,000-fold more virus sequences in the metagenomics libraries. the sensitivity of VirCapSeq was also compared with real time PCR for detection of viral sequence in blood and serum samples spiked with live enterovirus D68. VirCapSeq allows the identification of viruses whose genomes are vastly different from those used to design the probes. negative selection approach can use the principle of suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) or representational difference analysis (RDA) which allows the comparison of two DNA populations (tester and driver) and enrichment of differentially distributed molecules. the remaining unhybridized DNAs represent DNA molecules present in the tester yet absent from the driver DNA. GLOBINclear kit provide sequence specific (human/mouse/rat/bacteria) biotinylated oligos designed to capture host rRNA or highly expressed gene. the kit uses a slightly different approach where a DNA oligo binds to rRNA sequences in the samples followed by RNase H mediated selective removal of hybridized rRNA. most animal viruses are less than 200\u2013300 nm in diameter and therefore can pass through filters with 0.2\u20130.45 m pore size. filter with pore diameter closer to the virus size can reduce the amount of viruses in the filtrate. nuclease treatment or nuclease mediated removal of non-capsidated nucleic acids to enrich samples for viral nucleic acids was first described by Allander et al. (allander et al., 2001) nuclease treatment of virus containing serum samples can help enrich the metagenomic libraries from virus derived sequences. DNA microarray has been employed to characterize and discover a number of novel or variant viruses including the human cardioviruses, porcine circovirus, rhinovirus and adenovirus respectively. however, due to their limited specificity, none of these methods were suitable for the comprehensive characterization of vertebrate viruses or for the analysis of viromes. stringent hybridization conditions of VirCapSeq allow specific enrichment of virus-like sequences in libraries generated from different sample types. VirCapSeq gained 100\u201310,000-fold more virus sequences in the metagenomics libraries. sensitivity of VirCapSeq was also compared with real time PCR for detection of viral sequence in blood and serum samples spiked with live enterovirus D68. negative selection based virus metagenomics An ideal negative subtraction strategy would allow the removal of all non-viral nucleic acids from samples. a negative selection approach can use the principle of suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) or representational difference analysis (RDA) new rRNA depletion kit uses a slightly different approach where a DNA oligo binds to rRNA sequences in the samples followed by selective removal of hybridized rRNA. rRNA subtraction is not promising when looking for viruses in cells and tissue samples that usually contain an abundance of genomic DNA and transcripts. rRNA subtraction is not promising when looking for viruses in cells and tissue samples that usually contain an abundance of genomic DNA and transcripts. VirCapSeq and ViroCap allow a comprehensive analysis of viruses in clinical samples. vircapSeq and ViroCap also allow a broad selection of probes for all known vertebrate viruses."}
