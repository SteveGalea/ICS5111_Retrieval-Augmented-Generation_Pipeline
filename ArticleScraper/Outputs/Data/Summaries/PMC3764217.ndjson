{"summary": "a patient with severe respiratory disease at the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in jeddah, Saudi Arabia was getting worse. a sample of sputum was sent to Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki to identify the culprit. the sample showed no positive hits on any of the virus assays he normally used. the first isolate was hCoV-EMC, which stood for human coronavirus\u2013Erasmus Medical College. an additional isolate was isolated from a patient in London, UK. the closest phylogenetic neighbors to MERS-CoV are putative bat coronaviruses in China. anecdotal evidence suggests that MERS-CoV may have been transmitted to humans via livestock (camels or goats); however, there is no scientific data yet to support this theory. ex-vivo infections of human lungs and human airway epithelial cell cultures identified type II alveolar cells and non-ciliated lung epithelial cells as the targets of infection. the receptor for MERS-CoV was recently identified as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) by mass spectrometry analysis of Huh7 cell protein bound to the MERS-CoV Spike protein. MERS-CoV is shown to modulate the innate immune response, antigen presentation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and apoptosis pathways. inhibition of the MAPK pathway showed reduction in viral replication in culture, pointing to potential therapeutics. there is no current treatment or vaccination available for MERS-CoV. none have been tested in vivo, in part due to the lack of a small animal model. one promising avenue is to use the knowledge of SARS-CoV and compare it to MERS-CoV. emergence of novel sARS coronavirus in 2003 from a zoonotic source in china is not an isolated incident of coronavirus spread. the sooner we understand these current microbial threats, the more people we can save from infection and possible death."}
