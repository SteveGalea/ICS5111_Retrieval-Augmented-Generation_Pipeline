{"summary": "the reconstruction of the transmission tree describes the history of infectious events at the resolution of individual cases. two approaches to the inference of transmission trees from WGS have emerged. one starts with an underlying transmission model, attaching to this a model of sequence evolution that relates observed genetic relationships between pathogens to unobserved epidemiological relationships between infected individuals. the impact of limited genetic diversity on the reconstruction of disease outbreaks remains to be investigated. the impact of limited genetic diversity on the reconstruction of disease outbreaks remains to be investigated. the impact of limited genetic diversity on the reconstruction of disease outbreaks remains to be investigated. transmission divergence of ten major outbreak-causing pathogens, namely Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), SARS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), pandemic influenza A (H1N1), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Shigella sonnei (S. sonne transmission divergence appears to follow a mixed Poisson distribution. the mixing distribution of the Poisson rate is determined by variation in the generation-, sampling- and coalescent times. ten major outbreak causing pathogens have been identified. transmission divergence is defined as the number of mutations separating pathogen WGS from transmission pairs. black circles represent empirical observations of the proportion of unique sequences for a given outbreak. phybreak consistently estimating higher values than outbreaker (S5 Table) outbreaker estimated a mean value below one for eight of the ten pathogens considered. two pathogens that showed significantly higher transmission divergence were K. pneumoniae and SARS-CoV. we quantified genetic diversity by the number unique of sequences as a proportion of total sequences. diversity between these outbreaks was more variable than expected. one value fell outside both prediction intervals and two values only expected. greatest disagreement with our predictions was observed for a K. pneumoniae outbreak described by Snitkin et al. [106]. analysis of simulated outbreaks using outbreaker and phybreak inference algorithms. we quantified the accuracy in outbreak reconstruction and the statistical confidence in ancestry assignments using the posterior entropy. increases in mean transmission divergence resulting in markedly lower accuracy. this was most evident in SARS-CoV and K. pneumoniae outbreaks. the average transmission divergence was nearly two times higher. a significant number of ancestries were incorrectly assigned. uniformity of outbreak reconstruction is defined as proportion of correctly assigned ancestries in the consensus transmission tree. coloured points represent individual simulated outbreaks. the solid black line represents the fitted linear model, the dotted black lines the 95% prediction interval. pathogen generation time (SD) (in days) Mutation rate (per site per day) Genome length (base pairs) Basic reproduction number R0 References EBOV 14.4 (8.9) 0.31 x 105 18958 1.8 [28\u201334] MERS-CoV 10.7 (6.0) 0.25 x 105 30115 1.2 [35\u201340] SARS-CoV 8.7 (3.6) 1.14 x 105 29714 2.7 [41\u201349] Influenza A ( black circles represent empirical observations of the proportion of unique sequences for a given outbreak. the grey circle in the EBOV column represents the weighted mean across the four outbreaks. transmission divergence simulated under the two models differed significantly. we quantified genetic diversity by the number unique of sequences as a proportion of total sequences. we also quantified genetic diversity by the number unique of sequences as a proportion of total sequences. over 90% of sequences in S. sonnei and S. pneumoniae outbreaks were identical. the greatest disagreement with our predictions was observed for a K. pneumoniae outbreak described by Snitkin et al. [106], for which 7 out of 18 WGS were identical. the average serial interval over this outbreak was only 25.8 days (S6 Table), which was unusually short compared to the average value of 62.7 days. we reconstructed each outbreak with and without WGS data. we quantified the accuracy in outbreak reconstruction, as well as the statistical confidence in ancestry assignments using the posterior entropy (S1 Fig, S2 Fig). to minimise confounding epidemiological differences between pathogens, we calculated the absolute change in accuracy of outbreak reconstruction. at high values, mean transmission divergence was also poorly predictive of increases in accuracy, which were identical between SARS-CoV and K. pneumoniae. similar trend was observed when considering the statistical confidence in ancestry assignments. change in posterior entropy is related to the number of plausible posterior infectors for a given case. lower average entropy indicates greater statistical confidence in the proposed transmission tree. dotted black lines the 95% prediction interval. 120 patients (36%) had no recorded epidemiological contact with their genetically related case. a number of these pairs were probably separated by unobserved transmission events, for example by asymptomatic carriers, increasing the observed genetic diversity between supposed transmission pairs. reconstruct outbreaks even when mean transmission divergence was high, in accordance with previous studies [11,107]. Combined, these results demonstrate that WGS data will often be insufficient to fully resolve transmission chains, and reveal the need to incorporate other sources of information into transmission inference frameworks. the results do not imply that WGS is of no use for inferring transmission routes as a whole. the robustness of the correlations presented in Figs 2 and 3 suggests that our measures of genetic diversity have captured a central determinant of the utility of WGS data in reconstructing outbreaks. we assumed that the sampling time distribution is equivalent to the generation time distribution. but this could result in biases. the advent of WGS data has initiated a revolution in modern infectious disease epidemiology, shedding new light into disease dynamics and evolution at a variety of scales. the analysis of WGS alone will struggle to reconstruct transmission trees accurately for a large number of pathogens. cobacterium tuberculosis Shigella sonnei Clostridium difficile For the generation time distribution, we used the search terms \u2018generation time OR serial interval OR generation interval\u2019. the time of sampling is drawn from the sampling time distribution S. mutations accumulate in the time between infection of a primary and secondary case. within-host diversity is considered negligible, such that the same strain is both onwardly transmitted and sampled. outbreaker MCMC chains were run for 100,000 iterations with a thinning frequency of 1/200. phybreak chains for 10,000 iterations with a thinning frequency of 1/20. the burn-in period for both analyses was 1,000 iterations. an entropy value of 0 indicates complete posterior support for a given ancestry, with higher values indicating a larger number of plausible transmission scenarios. the searches were performed between 1st June 2015 and 3rd March 2017 and limited to publications in English. a long-term estimate was derived from serial pairs of isolates in a hospital outbreak [23], over a long-term estimate using historical phylogenetic analysis. studies estimating R0 were identified using the search terms: \u2018basic reproduction number OR basic reproductive number\u2019. within-host evolution was modelled in phybreak with an effective pathogen population size increasing at a daily rate of 1. for each pathogen, we generated 100 outbreaker simulations and 100 phybreak simulations with a minimum size of 30 infected individuals. in period for both analyses was 1,000 iterations. 100 outbreaks were simulated and reconstructed for each pathogen. phybreak algorithm requires WGS data to be provided. individual i infects individual j. generation time Wi,j is defined as intervals between infection of i and secondary case j. time for discriminatory mutations to occur between pathogen genomes sampled from i and j is denoted by red lines.
