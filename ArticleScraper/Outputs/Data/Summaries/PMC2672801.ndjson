{"summary": "HBoV was found in two sputum and one nasal lavage sample. the frequency of HBoV infection was low in both AE-COPD (0.8%) and stable COPD (2.9%). HBoV was found in two sputum and one nasal lavage sample. in about one third of severe exacerbations the cause remains unknown. human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and several coronaviruses (SARS, NL63, and HKU1) have been discovered. the role of HBoV in a well characterized population of adult patients with AE-COPD has not been systematically studied yet. the aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of HBoV infection in hospitalized patients with AE-COPD. AE-COPD was characterized by worsening of dyspnea, cough and/or sputum expectoration beyond normal day-to-day variations. AE-COPD was characterized by worsening of dyspnea, cough and/or sputum expectoration beyond normal day-to-day variations and was acute in onset. 7,25\u201328 HBoV PCR and sequencing DNA was extracted from 250 l of induced sputum and nasal lavage samples using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) extracted DNA samples were stored at 20 \u00b0C for further analysis. one negative control was amplified for every five samples. a plasmid containing 5182 bp of HBoV DNA was used as positive control. a single copy of viral genome per reaction was assessed. AE-COPD was characterized by worsening of dyspnea, cough and/or sputum expectoration beyond normal day-to-day variations. patients with stable COPD did not experience an exacerbation within the last 30 days prior to hospital admission, had no changes in inhaled or oral medication within the last 14 days. real-time PCR assays for all patients in nasal lavage and induced sputum samples. 7,25\u201328 HBoV PCR and sequencing DNA was extracted from 250 l of induced sputum samples using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) negative control was amplified for every five samples. plasmid containing 5182 bp of HBoV DNA was cloned in the vector pCR4-TOPO\u00ae. age distribution in AE-COPD group ranged from 41 to 83 and from 43 to 81 years in the control group. significant differences were apparent for increased airflow limitation on admission (FEV1 in liters and % predicted), higher inflammatory laboratory parameters indicating infection (CRP and leukocytes) and higher doses of oral steroids before admission in the AE-COPD group. n Range Median Range Pack yearsb 30.0 2\u2013120 30.0 2\u2013120 0.65 FEV1ad (L) 1.0 0.4\u20132.2 1.2 0.5\u20132.6 0.0001 FEV1ad (% predicted) 36.8 16.7\u201379.0 43.4 19.4\u201377.3 0.001 FEV1dis (L) 1.2 0.6\u20132.9 1.2 0.5\u20132.6 1.00 FEV1dis (% predicted) 45.2 18.5\u201378.9 43.4 HBoV was found in two sputum samples and one nasal lavage sample. only one nasal lavage sample tested positive for HBoV. clinical features of the three patients positive for HBoV are shown in Table 2. two subjects had stable COPD and reported cough, whitish expectoration and dyspnea on exertion without any recent changes in severity. the individual with AE-COPD complained of progressive cough, purulent expectoration and dyspnea at rest and symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. 84 of 134 patients (62.7%) with AE-COPD, had significantly improved after treatment for acute exacerbation and were comparable to the baseline airflow in the control group. spirometric data before discharge were available for 84 of 134 patients (62.7%) with AE-COPD. 93 69.4 42 61.8 0.34 No 41 30.6 26 38.2 Inhaled corticosteroids Yes 87 64.9 48 70.6 0.44 No 47 35.1 20 29.4 Mean SD Mean SD Age (years) 67.8 8.7 65.3 10.8 0.22 Body mass index (kg/m2) 27.2 5.4 27.4 5.3 0.80 Median Range Pack yearsb 30.0 2\u2013120 30.0 2\u2013120 0.65 FEV1ad (L) 1.0 three of 202 patients (1.5%) tested for HBoV were found to be positive by PCR and subsequent sequencing. only one had acute exacerbation, the other two had stable, but (very) severe COPD. clinical features of the three patients positive for HBoV are shown in Table 2. HBoV was found in two sputum samples and one nasal lavage sample. corresponding nasal lavage and sputum samples were negative. all patients were male and presented in the winter/spring season. HBoV DNA was detected in three of 202 patients (1.5%) only. it was found both in acute exacerbation and stable disease. the findings suggest that HBoV may not be of clinical relevance in adult patients with AE-COPD. AE-COPD requiring hospital admission was significantly associated with the presence of common respiratory viruses. induced sputum, which may more reliably reflect the lower respiratory tract, had a higher viral yield than upper respiratory tract specimens in patients with AE-COPD. this is the first controlled study on the prevalence of HBoV in adult hospitalized patients with AE-COPD. we found HBoV at a very low frequency in patients with acute exacerbation as well as stable COPD. this is consistent with the hypothesis that HBoV is carried at low copy numbers in some individuals."}
