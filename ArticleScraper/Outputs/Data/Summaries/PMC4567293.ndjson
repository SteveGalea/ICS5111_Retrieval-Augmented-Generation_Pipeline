{"summary": "as of November 16, 2014, a total of 457 confirmed cases had been reported. this is the first time that avian influenza A H7N9-subtype virus infection has been reported in humans. this is the first time that avian influenza A H7N9-subtype virus infection has been reported in humans. laboratory-designed nucleotide detection assays have been developed and used in the public health laboratories of the Chinese National Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (CNISN) these assays are currently the main tools employed for the rapid identification of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus and have played a critical role in early responses to the outbreak of the virus. however, careful and persistent monitoring of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus is urgently needed. the study protocol and informed consent documents were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the first Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University (ZJU Hospital), the Nanjing Public Clinical Health Center (SPHCC), the Guangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangdong CDC), the Guangzhou Municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangzhou CDC) and the Jiangsu Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Jiangsu CDC strains were prepared by the state key laboratory for diagnostic and treatment of infectious diseases. the viral titers were 105.7 and 104.6 TCID50/mL respectively. the other three H7N9 strains were cultured by the national institute for viral disease control and prevention. the sequencing results were aligned with the influenza sequences deposited in the global initiative on sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database. RT-PCR and sequencing analyses were independently performed using identical protocols in two different laboratories at the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) and the Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine (BIRM) the culture supernatants of the non-H7N9 influenza virus strains were diluted 50- to 500-fold in lyophilization buffer. each bulk sample (0.5 mL) was placed in a 2-mL penicillin bottle and immediately processed for lyophilization. the penicillin bottles were lightly fitted with rubber stoppers and were then lyophilized in a Genesis 25LE freeze-dryer. s were verified in our laboratory by PCR and sequencing using plasmid-specific primers. PCR products with T7 promoter sequences were used as templates for subsequent in vitro transcription. s were added upstream of the HA, MP and NS fragments using specific primers. RNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. the commercial and WHO-CNIC assays were conducted strictly according to the kit instructions and protocols. the criteria for the internal control (human RNaseP) were not considered when interpreting the results of the analytical evaluation of the Puruikang assay. the experimental procedures, result interpretation and quality control criteria for each kit are documented in detail in S3 File.

RT-PCR and sequencing analyses were independently performed using identical protocols in two different laboratories at the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) and the Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine (BIRM) the culture supernatants of the non-H7N9 influenza virus strains were diluted 50- to 500-fold in lyophilization buffer. each bulk sample (0.5 mL) was placed in a 2-mL penicillin bottle and immediately processed for lyophilization. the penicillin bottles were lightly fitted with rubber stoppers and then lyophilized in a Genesis 25LE freeze-dryer. PCR products with T7 promoter sequences were used as templates for PCR. the plasmids were added upstream of the HA, MP and NS fragments. the PCR products were gel-extracted, photometrically quantified and transcribed into RNA using the MegaScript T7 in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, USA) five strains of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (H7N9 virus) were isolated and cultured in the laboratory to establish the quality-control panel. the virus titer (TCID50 or HA titer) was determined according to the protocols recommended by the WHO [18, 19] viral culture supernatants were confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. RT-PCR and sequencing primers were aligned with the influenza sequences deposited in the global initiative on sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database. multipette stream electronic hand dispensers with Combitip bio-safe tips were used for the dispensing process. Approximately 10 mL of viral culture supernatants from the H7N9 virus strains A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013 and A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU02/2013 were designated P1 and P2, respectively, and were directly dispensed in 0.1-mL aliquots in screw-cap sequences of synthetic HA, MP and NS fragments were verified in pUC- or pBluescript-derived plasmid vectors.

CFDA approved three commercial real-time RT-PCR assays for specifically detecting avian influenza A (H7N9) viral RNA in may and July, 2013 for emergency use. the ability to identify different H7N9 viruses is an important factor in the quality of diagnostic assays. five different H7N9 viruses in the panel and additional positive clinical specimens collected from more than 90 infected patients could be successfully detected, thus validating the sensitivity and inclusiveness of the assays. commercial multiplex xTagRVP assay was approximately 200-fold less sensitive than the WHO-CNIC method. this difference may be due to reliance of commercial assays on the detection of the conserved region of the M segment of the influenza virus without any optimization for the detection of the novel H7N9 virus. both their own assay and the assay developed by corman et al. [29] could detect samples at a dilution of 108 for the H7 target, while neither assay could detect N9 [26] the results of other studies have indicated that the WHO-CNIC assay was 10-fold more sensitive for the detection of the H7 segment than for N9. the influenza virus is an RNA virus that tends to exhibit sequence changes and segment reassortment. one of the earliest identified strains, A/Shanghai/1/2013, showed particularly high diversity in comparison to other H7N9 viruses. more than 100 throat swabs were assessed to evaluate the sensitivity of the commercial assays for the detection of H7N9 virus in upper respiratory tract specimens. more than 98% of positive samples defined by the reference method were correctly detected by all of the commercial assays. only six and three samples from H7N9-infected patients yielded discordant results. an internal control, which is added to each sample prior to nucleic acid extraction, serves to monitor inhibitory factors in the extracted specimen. such internal controls are required in PCR-based assays to decrease the occurrence of false-negative results and to increase the sensitivity of the assay. the simultaneous detection of the internal-control targets and viral RNA in one reaction can lead to better control of false-negative results. control using the MS2 bacteriophage was incorporated into the molecular assay used to specifically detect the avian influenza A (H7N9) virus. external positive and negative controls contained in the kits monitored false negative results caused by reagent failure and operation errors. these external controls work together with the internal control described above, resulting in stringent and sustained quality control for commercial assays. commercial assays and the WHO-CNIC method were located on both the HA and NA genes of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus. the target region was beyond the consensus position of the commercial assay. the difference in the target regions between WHO-CNIC and the commercial assays may explain the enhanced sensitivity of the WHO-CNIC method. commercial assays will be interpreted as avian influenza A (H7N9) virus RNA-positive only when both H7 and N9 are positive. but the undetermined cross-reactivity may not hamper the application of the assays for current patient samples. results for samples that were repeatedly freeze-thawed five times. yellow columns indicate the results for samples at the time of production. red and blue columns indicate the results obtained for samples at 6 and 12 months after production. influenza virus strains and their final concentrations in the reference panel.
