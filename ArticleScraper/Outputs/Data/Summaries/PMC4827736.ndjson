{"summary": "a 22-month-old male domestic short-haired cat was presented with a 2-week history of progressive lethargy, vomiting, and decreased appetite. the cat had a rectal temperature of 39.9\u00b0C and a body condition score of 3/9. the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. the cat was hospitalized and treated symptomatically with IV Lactated Ringer\u2019s Solution at 20 mL/h, maropirant (Cerenia; Zoetis, Kirkland, Quebec), 10 mg/kg body weight (BW), subcutaneously (SQ) and buprenorphine (Vetergesic Multidose; Reckitt Benckiser, Mississauga, Ontario), 15 g/kg BW, PO buccally. bilirubin (34 mol/L) as well as a mild decrease in Na+ (139 mmol/L; RI: 142 to 164 mmol/L; RI: 3.7 to 5.8 mmol/L) and total proteins (52 g/L; RI: 54 to 82 g/L) on a blood smear there was a mild ( 10%) polychromasia, a moderate (50%) anisocytosis samples of the liver, small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, and pancreas were submitted for histopathology. hematoxylin and eosin stained sections (5 m) with routine staining methods. some hepatocytes contained multiple 3 to 4 m diameter round-elongate basophilic bodies within their cytoplasm. hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of liver tissue showing necrosis of hepatocytes and intracytoplasmic basophilic bodies resembling protozoa. no significant immunoreactivity was identified in sections of mesenteric lymph node. the highest prevalence of FIP is among purebred cats, usually in multicat environments or catteries. the increase in total bilirubin is the one clinicopathologial finding most suggestive of FIP (15) oocysts closely resemble the oocysts of other coccidian species. definitive hosts only shed for a short time (1 to 2 wk) during this period of oocyst shedding the host typically does not display clinical signs, further limiting the usefulness of fecal testing during active infection. monary involvement is suspected, given the pleural effusion detected on postmortem evaluation. the enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes could have revealed tachyzoites. thoracic radiographs could have served as an additional aid in diagnosis. pet owners should be made aware of both the public health risk and the feline health risk associated with feline toxoplasmosis. treatment, if instigated early enough, is often successful (4)."}
