{"summary": "Background Rotavirus (RV) infection is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in children. an effective vaccination regime against RV can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality. 85% of these deaths occur in developing countries where nearly two million children are hospitalized annually due to RV infection. the first RV vaccine (RotashieldTM) was withdrawn in 1998 due to a common side effect, intussusception. previous studies have shown that RV VP6 can interact with a large fraction of human naive B cells. mice immunized with VLP2/6 prime-rAd boost regimen elicit stronger humoral, mucosal and cellular immune responses. anti-VP6 IgG were present in all mice subjected to VLP+rAd and VLP treatment. mice were sacrificed at 35 days post-inoculation (dpi) and the cellular immune responses were determined. at dpi 42, the remaining mice were challenged with the murine RV EDIM strain. d alone group remained negative in the duration of the study. d alone group remained negative in the duration of the study. in the VLP+rAd group, 4 of 5 mice tested positive for anti-VP6 IgA at dpi 28 and all mice were positive at dpi 35. this is in contrast to the VLP treated group for which only 2 of 4 mice tested IgA positive at dpi 35. only IFN- and IL-2 levels were higher than those of the PBS group. splenocytes were isolated and stimulated with RV VP6 peptide. five mice were challenged with 10DD50 of murine RV EDIM. the viral shedding in each experimental group decreased to various degrees after challenge. the VLP+rAd group, the rAd+VLP group, and the rAd group were 76.7%, 36.1%, and 31.1% respectively. anti-VP6 IgG were present in all of the mice in the rAd+VLP group until after the third immunization. in the rAd group seroconversion was observed in only 3 out of 5 mice. i 28 and dpi 35 only in mice immunized with VLP+rAd and VLP. at dpi 35, serum IgA of the VLP+rAd group was significantly higher than that of the VLP group. in the VLP group, only 3/4 of the mice showed that IgA were positive. fecal IgA (P = 0.17412) and IgG (P = 0.34917) levels were negative after each inoculation. levels of specific IgG (A) and IgA (B) antibodies in the feces were examined. the levels of both Th1 cytokines (TNF-, IFN-, and IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) increased following all immunization schemes. only IFN- and IL-2 levels were higher than those of the PBS group. the concentrations of TNF- (A), IFN- (B), IL-5 (C), IL-4 (D) and IL-2 (E) in the culture supernatant were measured. Error bars represent standard errors of the mean. study compared effectiveness of rAd prime-rAd boost and rAd prime-vLP boost regimens in eliciting anti-RV protective immunities. results demonstrate that the rAdVP6 boost regimen is more effective in stimulating VP6 specific immunities and conferred a higher protection than the other regimens tested. boosting twice with rAd at a small dosage was an effective and economical immunization scheme. the mice immunized with the VLP+rAd regimen elicited stronger humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses. the reasons for this disparity are unclear. correlation analysis between all measurement indicators and reduction in rotavirus shedding in mice Indicators r P value Serum IgA 0.94839 0.051611 Serum IgG 0.84071 0.15929 Fecal IgG 0.96137 0.038633 Fecal IgG 0.95773 0.04227 TNF- 0.37996 0.62004 IFN- -0.0793 0.92072 IL-5 -0.2375 0.76253 IL-4 0.013 VLP2/6 was produced by expression of RV VP2 and VP6 simultaneously in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells through recombinant baculovirus. the recombinant baculovirus was generated by the Bac-to-Bac\u00ae Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) mice were intranasally (i.n.) inoculated with 10 g RV VLP2/6 at days 0, 14, and 28 respectively. for the rAd+vLP group, mice were orally primed with 1 106 ifu rAdVP6 at day 0, followed by twice i.n. boosting with 10 g RV VLP2/6 at days 14 and 28 respectively. group were euthanized at 42 dpi and stool samples were collected daily. splenocytes were isolated for the cytokine measurements. peroxidase substrate, and absorbance was read at 450 nm (A450) using an ELISA plate reader. serums were serially diluted to determine antibody titers. presence of RV antigen in fecal samples was determined by a sandwich-ELISA. recombinant replication defective adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) expressing RV VP6 termed rAdVP6 was generated with the AdEasy system (Stratagen, Cedar Creek, TX) the virus was titered with an Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and stored at -70\u00b0C prior to use. virus was generated by the Bac-to-Bac\u00ae Baculovirus Expression System. cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (20 min at 10,000 rpm) the presence of the purified VLP2/6 was confirmed by Western blot. mice were orally primed with 1 106 ifu rAdVP6 (in 0.1 ml each dose) at day 0, followed by twice i.n. boosting with 10 g RV VLP2/6 at days 14 and 28 respectively. control mice received intranasal immunization of 0.1 ml PBS at days 0, 14, and 28. ELISA ninety-six-well polystyrene microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.1 g/well VP6 antigen diluted in carbonate buffer. wells were washed three times with 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T) and blocked with 200 l of 1% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS (PBS-BSA) for 2 hours individual stool samples were tested--10% (wt/vol)--and specimens' A450 was determined using an ELISA plate reader. shedding curves for each animal were plotted, and the areas under the curves for each animal were calculated. a >50% reduction in shedding was considered significant protection from virus challenge. a value of 50 (one-half the lowest detectable level) was assigned to the sample. the value of the sample was two times that of the background. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
