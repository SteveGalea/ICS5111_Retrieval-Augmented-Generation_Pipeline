{"summary": "the world was faced with the first severe and readily transmissible new disease of the 21st century \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) it emerged in late 2002 as the probable cause of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in southern China. it then spread to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (China) via an infected traveller who arrived at his hotel on 21 February 2003. the disease continued to spread, reaching 26 countries on five continents and causing at least 8096 cases and 774 deaths worldwide before it was finally virologists, clinicians and epidemiologists communicated through teleconferences and video conferences, virtual grand rounds and via secure web sites. their goal was to expedite the identification of the etiological agent and development of diagnostic reagents;7\u20139 (2) share clinical information, including presenting features, disease progression, treatment and prognostic indicators. the work of these networks supported the global implementation of effective prevention and control strategies. zhou demonstrated significantly higher exposure to SARS-CoV compared to controls. the strain responsible for the global epidemic was similar to virus isolates obtained from small mammals sampled in live animal markets. in response, china issued a ban on the hunting and sale of civets. world has witnessed several emergent zoonoses including the geographical expansion of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1), the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the Arabian peninsula in 2012\u20132013,20,21 and a low pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9) in China in 201322,23. the world also experienced the H1N1 pandemic in 2009; an estimated 284 400 influenza-related deaths, with 9.7 million years of life a new global early warning system is being developed to detect novel zoonotic emerging diseases that move from wildlife to humans. the PREDICT programme is run by the United States Agency for International Development Emerging Pandemic Threats Programme. it is coordinated through the University of California and Columbia University with partners in the Americas, Africa and south-eastern Asia. the first APSED (2005) was so successful in meeting its objectives, with event-based surveillance systems and trained rapid response teams able to quickly conduct field investigations established in most countries. a second, updated strategy, APSED (2010),28 has been initiated to consolidate gains made in the first five years. the importance of IHR (2005) in detecting and responding to these threats cannot be overestimated. avian influenza in china is the single most important development in public health."}
