{"summary": "aliquot of culture supernatant was collected and stored at \u201380\u00b0C for RT-PCR evaluation. aliquot of culture supernatant was collected and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. aliquot was mixed with 2 x 106 vero cell suspension in 2 mL of complete medium. adherent vero cells flasks were seeded in a 25 cm2 tissue culture. they were injected with 0.5 mL of stored supernatant filtered with 0.45 filters. three days after infection, the cells and supernatant were subjected to 2 cycles of freeze thawing. a sequence of the SARS-CoV RNA encompassing the target region was used as positive control. a sputum sample from a healthy donor and a feline coronavirus RNA extract were used as negative controls. a sequence of the RNA encompassing the target region was used as positive control. the pCR2.1 plasmid was infected with 5 x 104 PFU/mL of SARS-CoV HSR1 at the third passage in a T-75 flask. the cell suspension was centrifuged at 173 x g for 4 min. a linear distribution was obtained between 101 to 108 copies. the pellet was resuspended and fixed in 4% formaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. the pellet was fixed with 2% OsO4 in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. the complete sequence of SARS-CoV HSR1 strain was aligned with all the previously sequenced genomes available from the GenBank database. available full-length sequences were trimmed to equivalent length and phylogenetic relationships were estimated with PAUP* (maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods) an aliquot (0.5 mL) of the sputum sample was mixed with 2 x 106 vero cell suspension in 2 mL of complete medium. after incubation, 5% CO2, 4 mL of complete medium was added. the cell cultures were examined with an optical microscope for evidence of cytopathic effects (CPE) vero cells seeded in 2 flasks of 75 cm2 were injected with 1.5 mL of the second passage virus stock in a total volume of 25 mL. RNA was purified from 750 L of the resulting homogenate. cDNA synthesis and subsequent amplification were performed by either nested RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR approach. a sequence of the SARS-CoV RNA encompassing the target region was used as positive control. a sputum sample from a healthy donor and a feline coronavirus RNA extract were used as negative controls. the amplified PCR product was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. confluent Vero cells in 6 well plates were infected with 5 x 104 PFU/mL of SARS-CoV HSR1 at the third passage in a T-75 flask. after 1 hour of incubation, the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet (Sigma) in 70% methanol. the plaques were counted after being examined with a stereoscopic microscope. the pellet was dehydrated in graded ethanol, washed in propylene oxide and infiltrated for 12 hours in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and epoxidic resin (Epon) cells were then embedded in Epon and polymerized for 24 hours at 60\u00b0C. slides were cut with ultramicrotome (Ultracut Uct, Leica, Deerfield, IL), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. nested RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR assays performed on the sputum sample from a person with SARS tested positive for SARS-CoV RNA. the viral load in the sample was estimated to be 5.6 x 104 SARS-CoV RNA copies/mL. the virus on Vero cells to obtain a tertiary viral stock yielded 9.1 x 108 copies/mL. the plaque assay was optimized to determine the in vitro infectivity of SARS-CoV. about 360 genomes were required to generate a single plaque in tissue cultures. virions were fed with viral particles localized in cytoplasmic vesicles. this feature is typical of all Coronaviridae viruses that bud intracellularly at membranes of the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. newly assembled virions reach the cell surface by vesicular transport (16) 149 sites were variable among the 22 aligned isolates. 24 loci in the viral genome varied in more than one isolate. recurrent mutations were silent, whereas 3 of 13 mutations generating amino acid substitutions were observed within the N-terminal domain of the spike glycoprotein gene. the isolation of a novel CoV in persons with SARS underscores the importance of identifying the pathogenic determinants of SARS-CoV. major areas of research include analyzing growth characteristics of SARS-CoV in vitro and evaluating virus-host relationships at the molecular level. infection in vero cells showed most of the usual characteristics of the CoV replication (16), including intracellular budding of virions. incubation of Vero cells with heparin (30 min before SARS-CoV injection curtailed infection by 50%. a novel sARS-CoV isolate was to date the second isolate obtained in Europe. the sequence analysis indicates that SARS-CoV HSR1 clusters together with the Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada isolates."}
