{"summary": "B-LCLs are similar to germ cells in differentiation and development. the somatic mutation rate of B-LCLs was only 0.3%1, with negligible genetic and phenotypic alteration. many methods have been developed for the immortalization of B lymphocytes by EBV. methods simplify the technique by omitting the separation procedure. only a small amount of whole blood, either fresh14 or frozen15,16, is sufficient to obtain the cell lines. this method is convenient, time saving and applicable to a large number of samples. centrifuge at 240 x g for 10 min at room temperature, then rapidly thaw at 37 \u00b0C. repeat 3 times until the virus particles are released from the cells. vaporation, add 200 L 1x PBS to every well around the 96-well plate. Expansion and Cryopreservation of B-LCLs Change half of the medium once per week for the first month after EBV infection. only a thick layer of cell fragments is visible under microscope at day 7. centrifuge cell plate for 10 min at 168 x g. remove supernatant and add 100 L DMSO per well. measure absorption at 570 nm by using a microplate spectrophotometer. 0.5 mL whole blood anticoagulated by EDTAK2 to 15 mL tube. put 1 mL red blood cell lysis buffer to the whole blood and mix well. centrifuge at 240 x g for 5 min at room temperature. lymphoblastoid cell clusters are visible under a thick layer of cell fragments under the microscope (Figure 2). Change half of the medium every 3 days until the cell clusters are clearly visible under the microscope. Typically, this process takes 10 to 20 days. small clusters of cells were clearly visible with the density gradient separation method after 7 days of infection. only a thick layer of cell fragments are visible from the red blood cell lysis method. with more frequent medium change, the cell debris decreases. the results show that the cell viability of established B-LCLs is much higher than that of the density gradient separation method. the red blood cell lysis method is simple and requires a small volume (as little as 0.5 mL) of blood for establishing a permanent cell line with a high success rate. current technologies for EBV transformation use relatively large volumes of peripheral blood, approximately 2 - 2.5 mL blood20 to isolate lymphocytes while others require 10 mL or more10,21. this contrasts to the 0.5 mL of whole blood needed to obtain an immortalized cell line with the method described here. this contrasts to the 0.5 mL of whole blood needed to obtain an immortalized cell line with the method described here. the cell lines developed in the present study provide a valuable and cost-effective source of biomaterials carry out various studies. authors declare that they have no competing financial interests."}
