{"summary": "DES is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by rapid evaporation and insufficient production of tears. severity is worsened by pathological conditions such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, which induces disruption of the ocular surface epithelium [3] or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) allogeneic serum can be prepared by some blood establishments in a production setting that should comply with good manufacturing practice (GMP) principles [19,20], to ensure product standardization and quality [20]. the main potential safety concern associated with allogeneic SEDs is, based on the historical experience with transfused blood products, the risk of infection by blood-borne pathogens, particularly viruses. we compared the safety and efficacy of S/D-treated and untreated rabbit SEDs in a DES rabbit model. the experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University. male new Zealand rabbits purchased from animal health research institute weighing 2.53.5 kg. serum was dispensed into Eppendorf tubes (0.5 mL/tube) and frozen at -20\u00b0C. the remaining 130 mL of serum was subjected to S/D treatment in a polyvinyl chloride bag. DES induction Rabbits were housed at 23 2\u00b0C, a relative humidity of 60% 10%, and an alternating 12-h light-dark cycle (06:0018:00). DES was induced as described in previous studies [28,29] with slight modifications. rabbits underwent general anesthesia for immobilization (intramuscular injection of 11.5 ml of a 1:2 mixture of Zoletil 50 and 2% Rompun solution) the same operator conducted the tests at defined time points under a standard controlled environment. corneal epithelium was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Sigma) sections of corneas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Sigma) for histologic examination. was determined using a DY5670 kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA) rabbit interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, and IL-6 were respectively determined using MBS725024, MBS2507990, and MBS812867 kits from MyBioSource (San Diego, CA, USA) a probability (p) value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. blood from each rabbit was allowed to clot for 2 h to generate serum. the supernatant serum was recovered, pooled and divided into two fractions. an aliquot of 90 mL was filtered on a 0.2-m filter to remove bacteria. serum characterization Total proteins were quantified by the Bradford assay. Sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under non-reducing and reducing conditions was performed using gradient gels. triton X-45 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 25\u00b0C for 1 h under constant gentle stirring. the mixture was extracted and clarified by adding 10% (v/v) soybean oil (Sigma), with vigorous shaking for 30 s, mild shaking for 15 min, and decantation for 40 min at 22 2\u00b0C. the clarified bottom protein layer was recovered, and the upper oil layer was discarded. DES induction Rabbits were housed at 23 2\u00b0C, a relative humidity of 60% 10%, and an alternating 12-h light-dark cycle (06:0018:00). DES was induced as described in previous studies [28,29] with slight modifications [30]. the paper strip for Schirmer\u2019s test was placed on the palpebral conjunctival vesica. each eye was tested twice at 30-min intervals, and the average length of paper wetting was calculated. fluorescein staining corneal FL staining was performed before and after DES induction. Quantification of inflammatory cytokines in the cornea Thawed corneas were weighed and separately chopped into small pieces. liquid nitrogen was added to immerse the tissue for solidification, and it was then ground into a powder. the tissue extraction solution containing 99% T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent and 1% HaltTM Protease were added to the tissue at a ratio of 15 mL per 1 g of cornea. rabbits underwent general anesthesia for immobilization (intramuscular injection of 11.5 ml of a 1:2 mixture of Zoletil 50 and 2% Rompun solution) same operator conducted the tests at defined time points under a standard controlled environment. each eye was tested twice at 30-min intervals, and the average length of paper wetting was calculated. corneal epithelium was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; Sigma) staining was performed to examine apoptosis. corneal epithelium was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. rabbit interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, and IL-6 were determined using MBS725024, MBS2507990, and MBS812867 kits from myBioSource. Statistical differences between groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) post hoc tests. a probability (p) value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Schirmer\u2019s test Tear production was examined after the 3-week eye drop treatment period. tear secretion rapidly decreased in eyes treated with 0.1% BAC. all groups were significantly difference from control group (normal eye, *p0.05) a dramatic improvement of the epithelial defect was observed in the two groups treated with SEDs and S/D-SEDs. normal corneas (control) had three to five layers of epithelial cells and dense collagen fibrils in the stroma. corneal sections in the 0.1% BAC-treated group showed a thinner corneal epithelium with only two or three layers. normal eyes (control) showed nearly no TUNEL-positive cells. eyes treated with 0.1% BAC (DES) showed fewer TUNEL-positive cells. eyes treated with SEDs showed fewer TUNEL-positive cells. the IL-6 concentration in all groups was much higher than that in normal corneas. using SEDs or S/D-SEDs to treat DES rabbits could selectively inhibit inflammatory cytokines in the eyes. rabbits were treated with 0.1% BAC three times daily for 4 weeks to establish DES. next, rabbits with established DES were treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs twice daily for 3 weeks. all groups were significantly difference from control group. a dramatic improvement of the epithelial defect was observed in the two groups treated with SEDs and S/D-SEDs. normal corneas had three to five layers of epithelial cells and dense collagen fibrils in the stroma. rabbits treated with SEDs and S/D-SEDs had normal corneal epithelia with a normal number of layers and thicknesses. normal eyes (control) showed nearly no TUNEL-positive cells. eyes treated with 0.1% BAC (DES) showed large numbers of apoptotic cells in the corneal basal epithelium and stroma. eyes treated with SEDs showed fewer TUNEL-positive cells. the IL-6 concentration in all groups was much higher than that in normal corneas. using SEDs or S/D-SEDs for topical delivery to treat DES rabbits could selectively inhibit inflammatory cytokines in the eyes. ocular surface of all experimental eyes was stained with FL. dark-green staining was observed in corneas of eyes treated with 0.1% BAC. corneal sections of the PBS group had thinner corneal epithelia. rabbits treated with SEDs and S/D-SEDs had normal corneal epithelia with a normal number of layers and thicknesses. damage to the epithelium was observed in (b) dry-eye syndrome (DES); 0.1% BAC. higher levels of TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, and IL-8 were detected in the 0.1% BAC (DES)-treated group. this model mimics inflammatory conditions associated with DES (*p0.05) DES is a frequent disorder prevalent in the elderly and in patients with chronic GVHD. symptoms include pain, irritation, itching, burning, and grittiness. artificial tears, anti-inflammatory drops, and punctal plugs are conventional treatments. 1% TnBP and 1% Triton X-45 treat allogeneic SEDs at 31\u00b0C. these conditions are known to inactivate over 5 log of HIV, porcine pseudorabies, bovine viral diarrhea virus [47], hepatitis C virus [48], and Dengue virus [49]. this treatment does not alter the plasma protein functionality or content of plasma components. preclinical rabbit model used topical administration of BAC to relieve DES. BAC alters both the cornea and conjunctiva, leading to physiological changes mimicking DES symptoms in humans."}
