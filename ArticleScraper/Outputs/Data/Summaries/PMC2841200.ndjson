ATPase activity of rNSs in presence of ATP analog adenosine. Kinetic parameters were determined by three independent experiments. rNSs could also use dATP as substrate. k cat for dATP was approximately 10 times lower than that of ATP. rNSs were mutated to alanine by site directed mutagenesis. the mutant proteins were analysed on a 12% SDS-PAGE. the ATPase activity was tested using 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 g. ucleotide kinase (MBI fermentas) and [-32P] ATP were removed. the 5\u2032 end labelled poly(A) was purified using Sephadex G25 column. rNSs could cleave the 5\u2032 phosphate from end labelled poly(A) in the absence of ATP and the reaction was inhibited by the addition of 1 mM ATP. 5\u2032 labelled poly(A) was treated similarly with Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (MBI Fermentas) and was used as positive control. siRNA (siblue, purchased from Dharamacon), ssDNA (D159A sense primer), dsDNA (D159A sense and antisense primers annealed) were also 5\u2032 end labelled and used as substrates for 5\u2032 phosphatase activity of rNSs. 5\u2032 Phosphatase activity of rNSs was assayed with ssRNA poly(A) as described in the methods section in the absence of ATP.

RNA silencing or PTGS is a major strategy by which plants mount defense responses against molecular parasites such as viruses. the RNA silencing pathway involves the initial processing of viral dsRNA into small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes of length 21\u201325 nt by DICER or its homologs. NSs might act as a suppressor of PTGS by removing 5\u2032 phosphate from dsRNA, the ATPase reaction was carried out using 2 nM of [javascript:app(\u2018lower case gamma\u2019)32P] ATP, 1.3 g of NSs protein and with increasing concentration of EDTA for 30 minute at 25\u00b0C. each point represents the average of three experiments.
