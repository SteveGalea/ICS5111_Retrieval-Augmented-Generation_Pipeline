{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is defined as a common, preventable, and treatable disease. progressive airflow limitation is attributed to chronic inflammation leading to small airway obstruction and parenchymal tissue destruction1. causes of exacerbation are complex and mainly include respiratory, viral, or bacterial infections. neutrophils in sputum were found to be correlated with a rapid decline in patients' forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in a 15-year period of observation. increased activity of MMP-8 (collagenase) and MMP-9 (gelatinase) was detected in induced sputum from patients with COPD. the role of eosinophils in COPD and the mechanism of eosinophil influx into airways remains to be clarified. nearly one third of COPD patients had sputum eosinophilia and the number of eosinophils was significantly correlated to the level of exhaled nitric oxide17. inhaled fluticasone (200 g/day) can significantly suppress the numbers of eosinophils in the airways of COPD. improvement in FEV1 is not associated with a reduction in the sputum eosinophil count in COPD with sputum eosinophilia. increased CD8+ T lymphocytes have been shown in the central and peripheral airways and lung parenchyma in COPD12,13,24, the exacerbation rates were significantly associated with post-bronchodilator FEV1, impairment in health status, history of reflux or heartburn, white blood cell count, and prior history of exacerbation. acute exacerbation of COPD had been found to be an independent factor of mortality, suggesting more exacerbations with higher mortality29. the number of neutrophils in induced sputum11 and in the sub-epithelium from bronchial biopsies12 suggests neutrophilic inflammation of the airways may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD. the number of alveolar macrophages was correlated to the extent of emphysema formation and to the severity of airway obstruction12. the higher counts of eosinophils in induced sputum is associated with higher pack-years and lower peak expiratory flow 25%\u201375% values18. patients with FEV1 >0.4 L and >15% increment had higher sputum eosinophil levels whereas the level did not differ when dichotomized by FEV1 increment >0.2 L and >12%19. cytolytic activity of CD8+ T cells against alveolar epithelial cells is perforin-independent. however, the contribution of CD8+ T cell and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cells to the pathogenesis of COPD as well as the cell recruitment to the airways are not clear. 48.1% of COPD patients with GOLD classification group A, B, C, and D had no acute exacerbation in the previous year before enrollment31. 55% and 29% of patients had bacteria or virus-associated exacerbations, respectively32. influenza virus infection can increase production of IL-8, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) from airway epithelial cells. air pollution and temperature Increased concentration of outdoor pollutants such as NO2, O3, SO2, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and particulate matter 10 (PM10) were associated with increased respiratory symptoms. seasonal variations and temperature may affect the incidence of acute exacerbation of COPD. cold temperature was reported to be linked to bronchoconstriction50 and FEV1 decrease51 especially for COPD patients. fibrosis via production of connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) is essential for TGF-1\u2013induced fibrogenesis. major bile acid stimulated alveolar epithelial cells to increase IL-8 production through p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. this may enhance neutrophilic inflammation in chronic airway disorders57. 28% of cases of acute exacerbation of COPD were associated with sputum eosinophilia. patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome may present with more respiratory symptoms, worse lung function, and increased risk of exacerbation. OSA exacerbated airway inflammation by increasing neutrophil proportion and levels of IL-8 and TNF- in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from moderate to severe COPD patients. the augmentation of inflammation can be curbed by treatment with CPAP69. 55% and 29% of COPD patients had bacteria or virus-associated exacerbations. major viruses associated with COPD exacerbations were rhinovirus (common cold), coronavirus, influenza, and parainfluenza. air pollution and temperature Increased concentration of outdoor pollutants such as NO2, O3, SO2, particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and particulate matter 10 (PM10) were associated with increased respiratory symptoms, acute exacerbations, and hospital admissions in COPD patients. gastroesophageal refluxate contains gastric acids, bile, and pepsin. prevalence of GER disease was 26.7% among stable COPD patients. severe GERD symptoms were associated with more frequent exacerbations of COPD. chol acid stimulated alveolar epithelial cells to increase IL-8 production. this may enhance neutrophilic inflammation in chronic airway disorders57. how to intervene and attenuate GER-related inflammation and fibrogenesis in chronic airway disorders is worth further investigation. patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome may present with more respiratory symptoms, worse lung function, and increased risk of exacerbation and hospitalization. a reduction in eosinophilic airway inflammation was associated with a reduction in severe exacerbation of COPD63. the mechanisms of how OSA exacerbates airway inflammation in COPD remain to be elucidated. the significant predictors/factors associated with increased risk of acute exacerbation in COPD are summarized in Table 1. bronchodilators can reduce exacerbations by improving hyperinflation or targeting inflammation. combination of inhaled salmeterol and fluticasone caused a significant reduction in IL-8 and MMP-9 in induced sputum from patients with COPD. combination of indacaterol/glycopyrronium was superior in preventing moderate to severe exacerbations by 17% compared to placebo for severe COPD patients. phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors were associated with a reduced likelihood of COPD exacerbation with odds ratio 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71\u20130.83) the EPA has recommended that time and intensity of outdoor activity should be regulated by air quality index since 2009. the N95 respirator was reported to be able to provide excellent protection against airborne particles85. gastroesophageal refluxate can trigger exacerbation of COPD. bronchiectasis patients have more respiratory symptoms, more exacerbations, and worse prognosis. azithromycin 500 mg taken 3 times a week for 12 months resulted in a significant reduction in the exacerbation rate versus placebo (HR, 0.58; p=0.001). the prevalence of elevated serum IgE had been reported to be 47.3% in COPD patients93. the levels of eosinophils in sputum samples were significantly correlated with exhaled nitric oxide level (eNO)17. CPAP is the optimal choice to reverse the inflammatory process so far. bronchodilators such as long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and long acting 2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) are the major pharmacological drugs for COPD. a combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium significantly reduced the annual rate of moderate to severe exacerbations versus glycopyrronium alone by 12%. a combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium significantly reduced the annual rate of moderate to severe exacerbations. the vaccine group had fewer episodes of influenza-related acute respiratory illnesses in all severities (mild, moderate, and severe) of COPD, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer requirements for mechanical ventilation84. the vaccine group had fewer episodes of influenza-related acute respiratory illnesses in all severities (mild, moderate, and severe) of COPD, fewer hospitalizations, and fewer requirements for mechanical ventilation. the ability to identify COPD patients who are at risk for GERD or GER-related chronic cough is essential to COPD management. it is worth conducting randomized trials to investigate the efficacy of anti-acid and anti-reflux therapy. eosinophilic inflammation in COPD is attributable to ACOS or is a specific phenotype of COPD. the response of eosinophilic inflammation to treatment would be more important than the delineation of the differences between these terms. obstructive sleep apnea CPAP is considered to be the standard treatment for OSA patients. CPAP may reduce oxidative stress by decreasing plasma malondialdehyde in OSA99. CPAP is the optimal choice to reverse the inflammatory process so far.
