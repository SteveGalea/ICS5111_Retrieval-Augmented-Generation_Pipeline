{"summary": "RNA moiety occupies a significant portion of a large basic patch of the NS5 protein. m7G0pppA1G2U3U4-3\u2032 sequence was refined to Rwork 0.1827, Rfree 0.2436 at a resolution of 2.6 with good stereochemical parameters. a total of 4 nt becomes protected by the flavivirus MTase during 2\u2032-O-methylation (13, 25) only weak electron density is visible for G5U6U7 that extends out of the MTase binding groove. the present conformation was superimposed with the free NS5 enzyme.

RNA is bound in the DENV MTase catalytic site, such that the 2\u2032-O-ribose of residue A1 is also conserved. the side chain of K180 activates the 2\u2032-OH of the adenosine ribose of the RNA methyl acceptor. the activated ribose 2\u2032-O makes a nucleophilic attack on the methyl group of the positively charged sulfur center via an inline SN2 reaction. at pH 8.5, the side chain of K180 can be easily deprotonated. MTase is consistent with the observation that amino acids F25, R57, and R61 all make key contacts with RNA in the present complex (29) the SAM cofactor could act as a \u201csensor\u201d by probing for the base identity and for the presence of a methyl group(s) in the RNA substrate. the catalytic mechanism proposed for NS5 is shared with the human mRNA cap-specific 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase the VP39 G0 pocket is deeper and more distant from the RNA binding groove compared with NS5 and CMTr1. in all three complexes, four RNA bases occupy the positively charged groove. nsp16, no apparent pocket is visible. specific recognition of the capped viral RNA is essential for virus replication. data normalized to the activity of the WT NS5 MTase on WT viral 5\u2032UTR RNA. each data point is the average for three replicates. the flavivirus genus is the only clade in the Flaviviridae family that encodes an MTase at the N terminus of NS5. despite a low sequence identity of 14% between the two proteins, the closest NS5 structural homolog with an rmsd of 2.9 for 222 of the 406 CMTr1 -carbon atoms and a Z score of 15.8 is the human mRNA cap-specific 2\u2032-O flavivirus NS5 protein may have originated from a domain fusion event. a mutagenesis study targeting the highly conserved residue E111 of NS5. this establishes the sole direct specific polar contact with the second base (G2) of the flavivirus RNA. X2 = U2 or C2 in place of G2 introduces unfavorable electrostatic contacts between their O2 atom and the carboxylic group of E111. this is consistent with the observation that the consensus sequence G0pppA1G2X found in flaviviruses (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B) binds more tightly than G0pppA1C2X to the DENV MTase (23) mutant virus is less thermostable than WT protein (SI Appendix, Table S1B) it has lower elongation polymerase activity, probably due to its poorer ability to bind RNA. m7G0 ring makes hydrogen bonds through its N2 atom with the carbonyl oxygen atom of L20 and N18. m7G0 and A1 are neutralized by a hexacoordinated Mg2+ ion. the remainder of the RNA adopts an -helical conformation along an axis that crisscrosses with the m7G0ppp moiety. only weak electron density is visible for G5U6U7 that extends out of the MTase binding groove. no domain reorientation between the MTase and RdRp domains upon binding capped RNA (26) no domain reorientation between the MTase and RdRp domains upon binding capped RNA (26). the RNA substrate is positioned so that the 2\u2032-O atom of residue A1 lies next to the sulfur atom of SAH and adjacent to the K180 side chain. collection and refinement statistics Parameters NS5: Cap-0 RNA: SAH Data collection statistics Resolution range, 47.33\u20132.60 (2.72\u20132.60)* Rwork 0.1827 (0.2857) Rfree 0.2436 (0.3382) No. of nonhydrogen atoms 7,228 Macromolecules 6,950 Ligands 148 Water 241 Protein residues 852 Rms, bonds, 0.003 Rms, angles, \u00b0 0.779 Ramachandran enzymatic mechanism for 2\u2032-O-methylation by the flavivirus NS5 MTase. close contacts between the 2\u2032-oxygen atom of adenine A1 and the sulfur group of SAH are indicated by dashed lines. stereochemistry of reactants conform to what is expected from an inline SN2 reaction. adenosine 2\u2032-O-methylation has been identified in viral genomic RNA internal adenosines and polyA but not on polyG, polyC, or polyU substrates. pyrimidine bases would leave a large empty space in the pocket, leading to energetically less favorable van der Waals interactions with the protein (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A) observation is consistent with the strict conservation of the 5\u2032 G0pppA1G2 sequence during flavivirus genome evolution (27) residues from the NS5 MTase domain that form the tip of the RNA binding pocket and establish specific polar interactions with the A1G2 dinucleotide are also conserved. the present complex represents a snapshot along the 2\u2032-O-methylation reaction pathway, possibly the reaction product. side-chain carboxylic group is at the right distance to stabilize the electrophilic sulfur group of SAM as well as K180. mutations at these positions abolish the 2\u2032-OH adenosine ribose activity. amino acids F25, R57, and K61 all make key contacts with RNA in the present complex. MTase has a demonstrated RNA substrate sequence specificity. a requirement for Mg2+ ions was reported for the COMT MTase. the structure of COMT suggested that Mg2+ ions play an important role for RNA stabilization but not for catalysis. four RNA bases occupy the positively charged groove in nsp16. the RNA binding groove in nsp16 is shallow and less positively charged. in nsp16, no apparent pocket is visible. qRT-PCR and plaque assays are 100 copies and 1 infectious virus particle, respectively. the flavivirus NS5 protein belongs to a family of SAM-dependent RNA MTases that methylate diverse RNA species including mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, and siRNA. within the Flavivirus genus, both the primary sequence and the 3D structures of the MTase domain are highly conserved. flavivirus NS5 is the only clade in the Flaviviridae family that encodes an MTase at the N terminus of NS5. the flavivirus genus is the only clade in the Flaviviridae family that encodes an MTase at the N terminus of NS5. the present flavivirus NS5 protein might have originated from a domain fusion event. E111A and E111Q mutations in the NS5\u2013cap-0 RNA have a smaller impact on the ability of the protein to bind cap-0 viral RNA compared with the E111R mutation. this is consistent with observation that the consensus sequence G0pppA1G2X found in flaviviruses binds more tightly than G0pppA1C2X to the DENV MTase (23). mutations such as E111Q and E111A attenuated virus replication. mutations attenuated virus replication and produced three to four times less infectious virus. effect of MTase mutant on polymerase activity suggests interdependence of two domains. our study indicates that attenuated viruses could be designed by targeting the E111 residue of NS5. the protocol for NS5 protein expression and purification was as previously described. deNV2 full-length cDNA clones with NS5 E111A, E111Q, and E111R mutations were constructed with a pACYC-NGC FL and a TA-NGC (shuttle E) vector as previously described (46). the protocol for NS5 protein expression and purification was as previously described (26). deNV4 2\u2032-O-MTase assay performed as described previously. full-length cDNA clones with NS5 E111A, E111Q, and E111R mutations were constructed with a pACYC-NGC FL and a TA-NGC (shuttle E) vector."}
