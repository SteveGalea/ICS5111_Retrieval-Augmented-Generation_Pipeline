{"summary": "the two most commonly used yeasts belong to the kingdom of fungi. budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) yeasts are single cell eukaryotic organisms. the study of both budding and fission yeasts in the past half century has contributed significantly to advance our knowledge in human biology, physiology and cancer biology. the awarding of three Nobel Prizes to scientists who were working on yeast model systems within a time period of fifteen years. the importance of using budding yeast as a model to study human cell biology was cemented by the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. it was awarded to a single scientist, Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi, for his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy. studies of yeast killer viruses have helped us to study cellular necrosis and apoptosis during virus-host interaction 14,15,16,17, and to understand potential cellular viral restriction factors toward viral infections 18,19. molecular studies of fission yeast Tf elements or budding yeast Ty elements provided insights into functions of retroviruses such as HIV or murine leukemia viruses 20,21,22. the first report showing an entire human viral genome can replicate as an episomal plasmid in yeast suggests yeast has the necessary cellular factors to support HPV/BPV replications. the report suggests yeast has the necessary cellular factors to support HPV replications. both polarities 33 DNA viruses Papillomaviridae Human papillomavirus (HPV) dsDNA circular Humans Amount of HPV genome DNA using a DpnI resistance assay 25 Bovine papillomavirus (BPV) dsDNA circular Animals Same as HPV 26 Geminiviridae Mung bean yellow mosaic India virus (MBYMIV) ssDNA circular Plants Yeast colony size, PCR budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has sixteen chromosomes with a genome size of approximately 1.2 x 106 base pairs (bps) it has about 5,700 protein-coding genes, with about 4.4% of them contain introns 37. budding yeasts have both asexual (vegetative) and sexual reproductive cycles. mitotic cell cycle has all of the typical eukaryotic cell cycle stages of G1, S, G2 and M phases, but it spends most of its cell cycling in G1 phase. diploid cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores by sporulation. budding yeasts have all of the typical eukaryotic cell cycle stages of G1, S, G2 and M (mitosis) phases, which can be recognized by DNA content, nuclear morphology and bud morphology. the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) is estimated to have about 5,000 protein-coding genes. the optimal growth temperature for S. pombe cells in the laboratory is 30\u00b0C with a doubling time of 2 - 4 hours. the standard Yeast Extract with Supplements medium is normally used to grow fission yeast cells without selection. the Edinburgh Minimal Medium (EMM) is typically used to select for the presence of a plasmid that carries a LEU2 gene or URA4 gene. fission yeast cell maintains its shape by growing exclusively through its cell tips. after mitosis, cell division occurs by medial fission with the formation of a septum that cleaves the cell at its midpoint to produce two equal sized cells. both yeasts have homologous genes with higher eukaryotes that they do not necessarily share with each other. fission yeast has RNAi machinery genes like those in vertebrates, but it is missing from budding yeast 77. fission yeast is divided by binary fission that produces a daughter cell with equal size to the mother cell. the budding yeast is also known as the \u201cbrewer\u2019s yeast\u201d because it is commonly used commercially for baking breads or making top-fermented beers such as ale. both budding and fission yeasts in the past half century have contributed significantly to advances our knowledge in human biology, physiology and cancer biology. the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine was for their seminal discoveries concerning the control of the cell cycle by using budding and fission yeast models, respectively 2,3. yeast cells are easy to culture in the laboratory. they grow rapidly with a doubling time of 3-5 hours. traditional yeast genetic methods could be used to examine gene effect in yeast on loss-of-function by gene deletion. yeast expressing BMV RNA replication genes 1a and 2a supports RNA-dependent replication and transcription of BMV

circular Animals and Humans Similar to MBYMIV 34 Yeasts also have much smaller genomes than higher eukaryotes. dding yeast (S. cerevisiae) has sixteen chromosomes with a genome size of 1.2 x 106 base pairs (bps) it has about 5,700 protein-coding genes, with about 4.4% of them contain introns 37. the daughter cells that are generated during cell division are generally smaller than mother cells. mitotic cell cycle has all of the typical eukaryotic cell cycle stages of G1, S, G2 and M phases, but it spends most of its cell cycling in G1 phase. diploid cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores by sporulation. the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) has three chromosomes with the size of 5.7, 4.6, and 3.5 Mb. its genome has approximately 1.4 x 106 bps. more than 90% of them contain introns 4,54. the standard Yeast Extract with Supplements medium is normally used to grow fission yeast cells without selection. the YES medium is typically used to select for the presence of a plasmid that carries a LEU2 gene or URA4 gene to compensate cellular gene defect in the leu1-32 or ura4-294 gene. antibiotics such as cycloheximide and Zeocin have also been used to select for hygromycin and bleMX fission yeast has been used extensively to study cell cycle regulation, DNA damage and repair as well as DNA replication. fission yeast has been used extensively to study cell cycle regulation, DNA damage and repair as well as DNA replication. fission yeast has RNAi machinery genes like those in vertebrates. budding yeast has an extended G1 phase of the cell cycle. fission yeast spends most of its cell cycling time in the G2 phase. killer yeast strains secrete protein toxins (K1, K2, K28 and Klus) killer yeast strains secrete protein toxins that are lethal to non-killer strains of the same or other species 84. two dsRNA viruses were subsequently discovered in the killer yeast strains 86. the helper virus, ScV-LA, encodes the capsids for both viruses. the K1, K2, K28, and Klus toxins are produced by different satellite ScV-M viruses 87,88. the presence of a ScV-LA helper virus needs co-existence of a ScV-LA helper virus. dsRNA viruses and higher eukaryotes 92 are known to replicate in yeast S. cerevisiae. a list of higher eukaryotic retroviruses is included in Table 1. a number of experimental tools could or have been used in yeasts. ribosomal frameshifting is a viral mechanism to merge proteins encoded by two overlapping ORFs such as Gag and Pol. the HIV-1 frameshifting site consists of a slippery sequence (U UUU UUA), followed by a stimulatory element P3 98,99. a follow-up yeast study by using a dual reporter system confirmed a direct correlation between HIV frameshifting efficiency and presence of the stimulatory element as a stem loop 102. a number of retroviruses including HIV-1 have the same stimulatory element. this process is essential for viral replication and molecular mechanisms of frameshifting is conserved from yeast to humans 103. a geminiviral genome consists of either one or two circular ssDNA in the range of 2,500 - 3,100 nucleotides. the DNA-A genome encodes six viral proteins, and the DNA-B produces two movement proteins 107. mutations in the MSV Rep-pRbR interaction motif abolished this interaction in yeast and resulted in significant reduction of MSV-induced symptom severity in maize 115. similar to budding yeast, Rep showed very similar activities in fission yeast as it does in plants. two of the plasmids constitutively express the essential TBSV replicase proteins. the third plasmid drives TBSV replicon\u2019s transcription through an inducible GAL1 promoter. a single gene yeast knock-out library was first subjected to a genome-wide screening. a specific Pkc1p inhibitor, cercosporamide, also resulted in increased TBSV replication 119. ribosomal frameshifting is commonly found in many of the RNA viruses including HIV-1 and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) a follow-up yeast study by using a dual reporter system confirmed a direct correlation between HIV frameshifting efficiency and presence of the stimulatory element as a stem loop 102. a number of retroviruses including HIV-1 have the same stimulatory element. this process is essential for viral replication and molecular mechanisms of frameshifting is conserved from yeast to humans 103. genome consists of either one or two circular ssDNA in the range of 2,500 - 3,100 nucleotides. the DNA-A genome encodes six viral proteins, and the DNA-B produces two movement proteins 107. ectopic expression of the ACMV Rep alone triggers cellular DNA re-replication in fission yeast 109. a RXL motif was identified in the Rep protein that might be an alternative link to the Rep-pRbR interaction and cell cycle control 116. two of the plasmids constitutively express the essential TBSV replicase proteins. the third plasmid drives TBSV replicon\u2019s transcription through an inducible GAL1 promoter. a single gene yeast knock-out library was first subjected to a genome-wide screening. a specific Pkc1p inhibitor, cercosporamide, also resulted in increased TBSV replication in yeast, plant cells, and whole plants. other viral proteins that regulate cell cycle in yeasts include SV40 RF-S 126, HTLV-1 tax 129, HPV E2 130, TBSV Rep 112. HIV-1 Vpr is a virion-associated viral protein of about 12.7 kD. it is involved in multiple steps of the HIV-1 life cycle 136. it induces cell cycle G2 arrest in both human and fission yeast cells. tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) on Cdc2/CDK1 is phosphorylated by wee1 kinase during late G2. it is rapidly dephosphorylated by the Cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase to trigger cellular entry into mitosis. mitotic regulators are safeguarded by two well-characterized mitotic checkpoint pathways to prevent cells from entering mitosis. fission yeast and mammalian studies showed that Vpr induces cell cycle G2 arrest via a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated cellular pathway 145,153,154. a later study showed that Vpr induces cell cycle G2 arrest through a unique molecular mechanism that regulates host cell cycle regulation in an S-phase dependent fashion 156. apoptosis is a form of cell death caused by factors external to the cell. apoptosis is a naturally occurring and programmed process of cellular death. autophagy is a normal cellular process that maintains cellular homeostasis. it regulates protein degradation and turnover of the destroyed cell organelles. some of the same mammalian pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic regulators were found in yeasts that show similar activities to higher eukaryotes. apoptosis is not as well studied in fission yeast as in budding yeast. expression of exogenous viral proteins also induce cell death and apoptosis in yeasts 64,174. anti-apoptotic viral proteins include baculovirus p35 174 and DPV022 protein of the Deerpox virus 181. a genome-wide screen was launched to search multicopy HIV-1 PR suppressors using a fission yeast genomic cDNA library. a fission yeast serine/threonine kinase was identified as a novel PR suppressor that suppresses HIV-1 PR-induced PR protein cleavage and cell death in budding yeast 179. a genome-wide functional search for multicopy protein suppressors of Vpr-induced cell death/apoptosis was conducted by overproducing a fission yeast cDNA library. it suppresses Vpr-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells through caspase 9 and caspase 3-mediated mechanism 66,67. a large-scale gene cloning strategy and a streamlined functional characterization system are also needed for this purpose. a large-scale gene cloning strategy and a streamlined functional characterization system are also needed for this purpose. the pYZ1N vector contains a wild type nmt1 promoter 68,196. it carries a LEU2 gene for selection. pYZ3N-GFP contains the same nmt1 promoter as pYZ1N and has an added green fluorescent protein GFP tag. three viral proteins, Vpr, PR and Rev, affected various cellular activities. only the Rev effect is described below as the effects of HIV-1 Vpr and PR have already been described in the early sections. fission yeast was used to carry out large-scale molecular cloning and functional characterization of a small viral genome. the study of the ZIKV 36 is a small (+)ssRNA virus that has a viral genome of approximately 10.7 kb 213. the genome encodes a single polyprotein that encodes a single polyprotein. each one of the 14 ZIKV viral cDNA that encodes a specific protein product was cloned into the fission yeast gene expression systems. all of the ZIKV viral activities were measured simultaneously under the same inducible conditions thus it expedited the functional characterization of the ZIKV genome. NS4A-mediated oxidative stress was mediated through Tor1 and Tip41. these proteins are the human equivalents of TSC1 and TIP41 proteins 221,222. these yeast findings provide a foundation for future research. HTLV-1 Tax 129, HPV E2 130, TBSV Rep 112 and ZIKV proteins 36. vpr-induced cell cycle G2 arrest in human and fission yeast cells. it induces cell death through apoptosis 136. phosphorylation status of tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) on Cdc2/CDK1 is regulated in part by the phosphorylation status of tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) on Cdc2/CDK1. this is phosphorylated by wee1 kinase during late G2 and is rapidly dephosphorylated by the Cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase to trigger cellular entry into mitosis fission yeast and mammalian studies showed that Vpr induces cell cycle G2 arrest via a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated cellular pathway 145,153,154. a later study showed that Vpr induces cell cycle G2 arrest through a unique molecular mechanism that regulates host cell cycle regulation in an S-phase dependent fashion 156. apoptosis is a form of cell death that is caused by factors external to the cell such as viral infection. autophagy is a normal cellular process that maintains cellular homeostasis. however, prolonged activation of autophagy often results in autophagy-mediated cell death by either cell necrosis or apoptosis. yeast apoptosis is not as well studied in fission yeast as in budding yeast. expression of mammalian pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak induce apoptosis-like cell death that was strongly suppressed by co-expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL 170,171. viral proteins that induced yeast cell death and apoptosis include, but are not limited to, pro-apoptotic proteins such as adenovirus E4orf4 protein 175, HIV-1 Vpr 67,176, HIV-1 protease (PR 177,178,179,180, and ZIKV proteins 36. the difference between these two yeasts could be explained by the relative thicker cell wall of fission yeast than budding yeast 179,180. studies in the fission yeast further demonstrated that HIV-1 PR cleaves its indigenous viral protein target sequences such as matrix and p6 proteins 189,190. yeast strains lacking part of the PTPC showed reduced Vpr-induced killing than wildtype control cells. a genome-wide functional search for multicopy protein suppressors of Vpr-induced cell death/apoptosis was conducted in a fission yeast strain. a large-scale gene cloning strategy and a streamlined functional characterization system are also needed for this purpose. a large-scale gene cloning strategy and a streamlined functional characterization system are also needed for this purpose. ura4) 68,196 allow testing of gene expression at various levels. multiple viral gene-producing yeast strains can be established and maintained that allow simultaneous viral gene testing. by using this system, functions of small viral genomes such as HIV-1 or ZIKV have been characterized as outlined below 35,36. each one of the HIV-1 genes was cloned and expressed individually in a wild type fission yeast strain 35. the effect of protein expression on basic cellular functions such as subcellular location, cell proliferation, and cytotoxicity were observed. fission yeast was used as a surrogate to carry out large-scale molecular cloning and functional characterization of a small viral genome. the latest example of using fission yeast to carry out large-scale molecular cloning and functional characterization of a viral genome is the study of the ZIKV 36. the ZIKV genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved by viral and host proteases into 14 proteins and small peptides. each one of the 14 ZIKV viral cDNA that encodes a specific protein product was cloned into the fission yeast gene expression systems. NS4A activates autophagy through the cellular TOR stress pathway. the inhibitory NS4A effect on TOR was mediated through Tor1 and Tip41. these yeast findings provide a foundation for future research of viral cytopathic factors that contribute to increase of viral pathogenicity. cell-based and high throughput drug screening systems could be used to for the new drug discovery. yeasts offer additional advantages over the use of mammalian cell systems. for example, yeast cells grow much faster than mammalian cells. inactivation of the Trp1p by CMV PR-mediated cleavage of Trp1p causes cell growth arrest. inactivation of the Trp1p by CMV PR-mediated cleavage causes cell growth arrest. another budding yeast cell-based HTS assay was for the Matrix-2 proton channel protein of the influenza A virus 236. an absorbance-based assay measuring Vpr-induced growth arrest was used as the primary assay. production of GFP driven by the same nmt1 promoter as primary and secondary assays was used as a counter-screen assay to eliminate potential false positives due to the inhibitory activity against the nmt1-mediated transcription 232. fission yeast has a thick cell wall. there are differences in cell membrane permeability and drug uptakes between yeast and human cells. however, the effective inhibitory concentration of an inhibitory compound identified from yeast must be re-calibrated. development of a new drug takes on average of at least ten years. the average success rate of a lead drug candidate is approximately one out of ten thousands 230. majority of the lead compounds failed because of the drug cytotoxicity or drug associated adverse side effect. it is always desirable to develop a fast, large-scale and cost-effective drug discovery process. both fission and budding yeast have been used to develop antiviral drugs. for example, CMV PR is an essential viral enzyme for viral replication. inactivation of the Trp1p by CMV PR-mediated cleavage of Trp1p causes cell growth arrest. Vpr prevents cell proliferation, induces cell cycle G2/M arrest and causes cell death in fission yeast and mammalian cells 63,64,244. an absorbance-based assay measuring Vpr-induced growth arrest was used as the primary assay. 165 lead compounds were found to have various levels of inhibitory activities against Vpr. lytic enzyme in fission yeast cleaves the same indigenous HIV-1 viral p6/MA protein substrate as it does in natural HIV-1 infections. both PR-induced cell death and proteolytic cleavages can be prevented by PR-specific enzymatic inhibitors, Indinavir (IDV), Darunavir (DRV) and other PIs 179,180. the use of yeasts as a model tool saves cost and provides unique tools to identify highly conserved cellular factors that interact with the virus of interest. the use of yeast to study virus is combined with the tools of higher eukaryotic biology and virology."}
