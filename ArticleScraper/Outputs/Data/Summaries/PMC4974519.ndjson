{"summary": "most of the transmembrane and secreted proteins are translated, modified, and folded in the ER. the amount of proteins in the ER can fluctuate substantially when a cell is undergoing physiological changes or when it is affected by various environmental stimulations. signaling via the ATF4-CHOP pathway promotes apoptosis induction during prolonged ER stress. known coronaviruses and viral proteins modulating the UPR signaling are also indicated. PERK-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis limits nascent protein transport to ER lumen, thereby attenuating protein accumulation in ER. IRE1-dependent RNA decay (RIDD) can also activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and promote caspase-12 dependent apoptosis. increasing amounts of unfolded proteins activate the protein and lead to its translocation from the ER to the Golgi. the cytosolic domain of ATF6 is then released and transported into the nucleus[10], where it induces expression of UPR genes. increased expression of ER stress related genes has been determined in cells infected with various coronaviruses. these include mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-coronavirus) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). er stress response can be detected in cell overexpressing the spike protein. morphogenesis and budding of coronavirus virions occur in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), a membrane system that is structurally and functionally extended from the ER. coronavirus infection induces ER stress and triggers UPR in general. onavirus E protein suppresses the IRE1-XBP1 pathway activation and inhibits apoptosis induction. neither the spliced XBP1 protein (XBP1s) nor the upregulation of downstream UPR genes could be detected. significant upregulation of UPR genes (such as ERdj4 and p58IPK) can be detected in cells infected with IBV. IRE1 and XBP1 involved in transcription of IL-8 and IFN-during IBV infection. cleavage of ATF6 into its active form cannot be detected in cells infected with SARS-coronavirus. most of the transmembrane and secreted proteins are translated, modified, and folded in the ER. the amount of proteins in the ER can fluctuate substantially when a cell is undergoing physiological changes or when it is affected by various environmental stimulations. signaling via the ATF4-CHOP pathway promotes apoptosis induction during prolonged ER stress.

MHV may hijack vesicles originated from the ER and use the membrane for DMV formation. morphogenesis and budding of mature virus particles deplete the membrane component in the ER. SARS-coronavirus E protein suppresses the IRE1-XBP1 pathway activation and inhibits apoptosis induction. neither the spliced XBP1 protein (XBP1s) nor the upregulation of downstream UPR genes could be detected in cells infected with IBV. however, significant upregulation of UPR genes (such as ERdj4 and p58IPK) can be detected in cells infected with IBV. ukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 (39,40) have also implicated the involvement of IRE1 and XBP1 in the transcription of IL-8 and IFN-during IBV infection. further investigation needs to be carried out for other coronaviruses to understand the detailed mechanisms and potential counter measures implemented by coronaviruses. coronavirus infection 2.1 regulates ER stress response pathways. p38 and JNK signaling pathways are phosphorylated by upstream MAP kinases. p38 is activated by MAPKKs, which are in turn phosphorylated by upstream kinases. p38 translocates into the nucleus and activates multiple effector proteins, such as MAPK-Activated Protein Kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2). activated c-Jun dimerizes with other proteins such as cellular FBJ murine osteosarcoma (c-Fos) to form the activator protein 1 complex, thereby inducing genes harboring the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response inhibition of p38 significantly reduces transcription and secretion of IL-6 in MHV-infected cells. production of TNF- and IL-8 in MHV-infected cells is significantly inhibited by p38 inhibitor. p38 has been shown to induce the expression of macrophage prothrombinase fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2). coronavirus-induced activation of the JNK pathway has been less well characterized. JNK phosphorylation has been determined in cells infected with MHV [67], SARS-coronavirus [67] and IBV [37]. phosphorylation of the JNK pathway has also been demonstrated in cells overexpressing the N protein. coronavirus infection activates upstream kinases, which in turns activate MKK3/6, MKK4 and MKK7. p38 and JNK have been shown to modulate inflammatory response by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. p38 and JNK are mainly responsive to cellular stress, such as DNA damage, ionizing radiation and protein synthesis inhibition. p38 is activated by MKK3, MKK4 [52] or MKK6 [53], whereas JNK can be phosphorylated by MKK4 or MKK7 [54]. p38 translocates into the nucleus and activates multiple effector proteins, such as MAPK-Activated Protein Kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2) pathway by Coronavirus Infection Phosphorylation of p38 is detected in cells infected with several coronaviruses including MHV [60], SARS-coronavirus [61], feline coronavirus (FCoV) [62], IBV [63] and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus [64]. p38 pathway is also activated in cells overexpressing the SARS-coronavirus accessory protein 3a [65] and 7a [ dephosphorylate the active p38 and suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) in the SARS-coronavirus E protein can interact with the cellular protein syntenin. production of inflammatory cytokines is significantly reduced in syntenin-knockdown cells compared with mice infected with the wild type virus. coronavirus infection activates upstream kinases, which activate MKK3/6, MKK4 and MKK7. induction of IL-8, activation of CREB and the transcription of cyclooxygenase-2 gene in cells transfected with SARS-coronavirus spike also requires JNK. mRNA1 encodes two large precursor polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, pp1ab is translated via 1 programmed ribosomal shifting manner. many of the nsps participate in viral RNA replication and transcription. coronavirus mRNAs are 5\u2032-capped and 3\u2032-polyadenylated, structurally equivalent to host mRNAs. in response to acute viral infection, host cell would shut down protein translation system to cope with the infection stress. virus must overcome this obstacle to ensure viral protein synthesis. infection stress stimili induces translational shutoff via phosphorylation of eIF2. eIF2 mediates binding of initiator Met-tRNAi to the ribosome. eIF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation of eIF2 on Ser51. PKR is induced as an IFN stimulated gene (ISG) under virus infection stress. dsRNA binds to PKR and causes a conformational change. PKR phosphorylates eIF2 and inhibits protein synthesis. sustained phosphorylation of eIF2 in 293T/ACE2 cells. PKR plays a role in viral induced apoptosis. overexpresson of spike glycoprotein resulted in activation of PERK. MHV infection induces protein synthesis inhibition. MHV replication is not negatively affected in host translational shutoff-deficient (eIF2S51A) cells or stress granule impaired. TGEV7 infected piglets exhibit accelerated pathology and more lesions at 4 dpi. piglets infected with virulent enteric strain TGEV-SC11-7 develop faster and more pronounced clinical disease. coronavirus nsp1 was first identified to block expression of reporter gene. the presence of 5\u2032-end leader sequence in viral mRNA protects mRNAs from nsp1-induced RNA cleavage. the binding of stem loop 1 in the 5\u2032-UTR with nsp1 protects viral mRNAs from nsp1-induced RNA cleavage. the inhibition of host protein synthesis and IFN inhibition by nsp1 seems to be a general phenomenon in coronavirus. TEGV nsp1 suppresses host mRNAs translation without affecting stability. HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 nsp1 inhibit expression of reporter genes. this protein inhibits translation of different reporter mRNAs in cells or cell extract. virus encoded proteases, papain-like proteinase (PLpro) and 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) into 13\u201316 mature non-structural proteins (nsps) many of the nsps participate in viral RNA replication and transcription. the subgenomic mRNAs are translated into structural proteins haemagglutinin-esterase (HE), spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocaps coronavirus must hijack the host translational machinery to produce their own proteins. eIF2 mediates the binding of initiator Met-tRNAi to the ribosome. eIF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation of eIF2 on Ser51. phosphorylation of eIF2 is a checkpoint of protein synthesis initiation. the level of phosphor-eIF2 is no wonder regulated under infection stress. there are four eIF2 kinases, GCN2, HRI, PERK, and PKR. these kinases are activated as a result of discrete stress. ible protein 34 (GADD34), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) helps PP1 to dephosphorylate eIF2, thereby recovering global protein synthesis. a number of viruses encode viral protein mimicing the function of GADD34, helps PP1 to counterbalance the PKR/PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2. the MHV induced translation inhibition coincides with degradation of host mRNA. the viral proteins are still efficiently made, which can be attributed to the 5\u2032-leader sequence and N protein in viral mRNA or the abundance of viral mRNA. the translational inhibition is not beneficial for virus replication in vitro. if2 was reduced to low level at late infection times, resulting in robust protein synthesis throughout the infection course. TEGV infection leads to PKR activation with a maximum at 12 h.p.i. but the level of phosphor-eIF2 in TEGV infected cell is comparable to mock-infected cells. coronavirus nsp1 is highly divergent among coronaviruses. nsp1 is involved in the regulation of host protein translation. a number of reports demonstrate that nsp1 is involved in the regulation of host protein translation. nsp1 selectively targets nuclear host mRNA and transports them to the cytoplasm for degradation and translation inhibition. MHV nsp1 suppresses host mRNAs translation without affecting their stability. nsp1 also inhibits the translation of different reporter mRNAs in cells or cell extract. further studies on corovirus-host interactions will shed light on antiviral therapeutics."}
