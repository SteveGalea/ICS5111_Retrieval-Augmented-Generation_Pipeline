{"summary": "flaviviruses are taxonomically classified in the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae. most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and cause public health problems worldwide. the development and usage of vaccines against some flaviviruses have decreased the rates of morbidity and mortality from infections caused by these viruses. RESULTS Screening of an FDA-approved drug library for inhibitors of flavivirus infection and disease. recombinant viral particles (RVPs) with the luciferase-reporting replicon enveloped by the JEV structural proteins were used to select inhibitors. the number of genomic RNA copies of RVP was determined to be 8.4 106 copies/ml. avir mesylate is an HIV-1 protease blocker. avir mesylate is an HIV-1 protease blocker. all five drugs showed a dose-dependent inhibition of JEV RVP infection. all five drugs robustly inhibited virus production, with a reduction of approximately 4 to 5 log units at the highest concentration and an approximately 1-log-unit decrease with 2.5 M the drugs. the attenuated RNA levels in the high-dose, middle-dose, and low-dose groups were all above 40%. a time-of-addition experiment was performed to investigate whether hit drugs blocked the entry step or the replication step. no suppression of luciferase activity was observed when they were used as treatments before infection or during infection or as a virucide. however, these drugs exerted fully inhibitory effects when they were added at 1 h postinfection. the highest concentration of manidipine and nelfinavir mesylate tested in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells was adjusted to 5 M and 10 M respectively. both drugs inhibited the initial translation of replicon RNA (5, 14) cell culture supernatants were subjected to a viral titer assay at 48 h postinfection. duplicate cells were assessed for viral RNA quantification. luciferase activities were determined 48 h or 72 h later. calcium channels inhibit the efflux of Ca2+ from the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum pool. treatment with the cell-permeant Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetraacetic acid could also suppress JEV infection. the effects of manidipine on WT and P20 resistant viruses were determined in a viral titer assay. data are represented as the means SDs for 2 independent wells. the experiment was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2A. individual virus clones were isolated, and two isolates were randomly selected and amplified. an amino acid substitution was observed in two isolated clones, resulting in a glutamine (Q)-to-arginine (R) switch. the plaques of the Q130R, Q130K, and Q130E mutants were similar to the plaques of the WT, whereas the plaques of the Q130A mutant were smaller than those of the WT. analysis of the plaque morphology revealed that the plaques of the Q130R and Q130A mutants were similar to the plaques of the WT. manidipine treatment reduced the mortality rate to 20% (4 out of 15 animals survived) mice treated with manidipine alone or treated with manidipine showed little abnormal behavior. survival of mice in each group monitored for 21 days after inoculation of JEV by intraperitoneal injection. manidipine-treated group formed in either the manidipine- or vehicle-treated group. viral loads were undetectable in each group on day 21 postinfection. the effects of manidipine on peripheral JEV infection were evaluated at earlier time points. the signal-to-basal ratio, coefficient of variation (CV) and Z\u2032 factor were 38,374, 2.8%, and 0.89, respectively. after three rounds of screening, five hits with a selective index (SI) were selected. the CC50 values of the hit drugs exhibited in Fig. 1B were similar to those previously published for diverse cell systems. the criterion required for the compounds to pass the primary screen was inhibition of >90%, and 28 primary candidates were selected. each dot represents the percent inhibition achieved with each compound at a concentration of 10 M. the five hit drugs inhibited JEV infection in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. a time-of-addition experiment was performed to investigate whether the hit drugs blocked the entry step or the replication step. no suppression of luciferase activity was observed when they were used as treatments before infection or during infection. time-of-addition analysis of the antiviral activity of hit drugs. manidipine (10 M), cilnidipine (10 M), benidipine hydrochloride (10 M), pimecrolimus (10 M), or nelfinavir mesylate (8 M) were introduced at different time points of RVP infection, designated virucidal, pretreatment (pre), during treatment (during), or post. ZIKV exhibited a higher sensitivity to the two calcium channels inhibitors manidipine and cilnidipine than JEV, with no plaque formation being observed at 10 M. treatment with 5 M manidipine produced a 95% inhibition of viral replication, translation, and viral yields. a dose-dependent reduction in the level of WNV replication was observed with the drug treatments. the same phenotype was observed for DENV-2 for all drugs except nelfinavir mesylate. the five hit drugs are excellent candidates for broad-spectrum antiflavivirus treatment. ic calcium is a potent target for antiflavivirus treatment. verapamil, 2-APB, cyclosporine, and BAPTA-AM are shown. the ratio of the total number of cells stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate to the number stained with DAPI (blue; nuclei) was calculated by comparison to that for the DMSO-treated control group. the location of Q130 in NS4B is highlighted with a red dot. sequences of recombinant viruses with different Q130 mutations were derived from sequences. the conserved Q130 of NS4B may account for the sensitivity of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2 to manidipine, as described above. to confirm that the Q130R mutation did confer manidipine resistance, we produced JEV clones with the Q130R, Q130K, Q130E, or Q130A mutation by introducing the desired mutations into the infectious cDNA clone. the Q130A mutant virus showed moderate resistance and a slightly higher than 2-log-unit decrease in titer. the Q130E mutant virus showed no resistance to manidipine. it could be concluded that Q130 is critical for conferring manidipine sensitivity. viral loads in mouse brains were measured by plaque assay on days 5 and 21 respectively. manidipine treatment alleviated histopathological changes in mice caused by JEV infection. mouse brain sections were collected and assayed at day 5 and day 21 postinfection. manidipine, cilnidipine, and benidipine hydrochloride were VGCC inhibitors. it has been well documented that VGCC inhibitors serve to inhibit virus infection at the stage of either entry (15, 22) or replication (18) and even at the stage of budding (23) n-terminal 125-amino-acid domain of DENV NS4B was indicated to be responsible for inhibition of the immune response. n-terminal 125-amino-acid domain of DENV NS4B was indicated to be responsible for inhibition of the immune response. n-terminal 125-amino-acid domain of DENV NS4B was indicated to be responsible for inhibition of the immune response. two hit drugs, pimecrolimus and nelfinavir mesylate, showed similar inhibitory activities on the replication of JEV, ZIKV, WNV, and DENV-2. nelfinavir mesylate was confirmed to inhibit herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and the replication of several other herpesviruses by interfering directly or indirectly with the later steps of virus formation. BHK-21, SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma), Vero, and Huh-7 cells were cultured in modified Eagle medium. JEV strain AT31, the WNV replicon, and the DENV-2 replicon expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) were propagated and titrated in Vero cells. the criteria used to identify the primary candidates were no apparent cytotoxicity. the CC50 of each compound was applied for the reconfirmation screen. the luciferase activities were determined 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h later. two manidipine-resistant virus isolates were plaque purified and amplified in the presence of manidipine. a cDNA clone of JEV, strain AT31 (pMWJEAT) was used to recover mutant viruses. five mice from each group were sacrificed on days 1, 3, and 5 postinfection. mice that showed neurological signs of disease were euthanized according to the regulations for the administration of affairs concerning experimental animals in china. l-cyclodextrin and dimethyl sulfoxide were used as positive and negative controls. a library of 1,018 FDA-approved drugs was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. the compounds were stored as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO at 4\u00b0C until use. manidipine-resistant virus was generated by passaging of JEV on vero cells in the presence of manidipine. passages 11 to 20 used 10 M manidipine. two manidipine-resistant virus isolates were plaque purified. mice were infected intraperitoneally with 5 106 PFU of JEV strain AT31. treatments were administered twice a day for the first 2 days. five mice from each group were sacrificed on days 1, 3, and 5 postinfection."}
