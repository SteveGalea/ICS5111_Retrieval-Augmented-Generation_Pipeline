{"summary": "the participants self-collected an anterior nasal swab from one nostril. the participants self-collected another two swabs on a subsequent day. a respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff- and 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs. self-collected midturbinate swabs had a sensitivity of 86% for the detection of respiratory pathogens compared to the gold standard. self-collected midturbinate swabs had a sensitivity of 86% for the detection of respiratory pathogens compared to the gold standard. Ip et al. investigated the validity of self-collected nasal (posterior nares) and pharyngeal swabs to detect influenza virus infection. compared quality of swabbing and efficiency of viral detection of anterior nasal swabs. the study participants completed a short acceptance questionnaire. all participants received a remuneration of 5 \u20ac. e-mail messages were sent reminding them to come to the study center within 7 days of onset. a staff-collected and a self-collected swab were obtained on day 1 from separate nostrils. the participants were instructed to collect a self-swab from each nostril the next day. the actual day of self-swabbing ranged from day 2 to day 6. plasmid eTC GFP -actin Zip (Plasmid 27124 by Addgene, 1 Kendall Sq. Ste. B7102 Cambridge, MA 02139, USA) contains these -actin gene sequences in a pcDNA3.1 backbone. the values of the two swabs that were self-collected were pooled. acceptance Satisfaction and acceptability were assessed using a nine-item questionnaire. participants rated each item on a five-point Likert scale with 1 indicating strong disagreement, 2 disagreement, 3 neither disagreement nor agreement, 4 agreement, and 5 strong agreement. a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect basic sociodemographic data. at the end of the ARI season the study participants completed a short acceptance questionnaire. all participants received a remuneration of 5 \u20ac. swabbing kit containing written and visual self-swabbing instructions. two nasal swabs and two vials of 1 ml transport medium were stored at 70\u00b0C. participants were instructed to collect a self-swab from each nostril the next day. plasmid eTC GFP -actin Zip (Plasmid 27124 by Addgene, 1 Kendall Sq. Ste. B7102 Cambridge, MA 02139, USA) contains these -actin gene sequences in a pcDNA3.1 backbone. cDNA was synthesized with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Hilden, Germany) cDNA was synthesized with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and tested by multiplex PCR. participants rated each item on a five-point Likert scale with 1 indicating strong disagreement, 2 disagreement, 3 neither disagreement nor agreement, 4 agreement. Statistical Analysis Data were described by percentage for categorical variables and median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. agreement between self- and staff-collected nasal swabs in the detection of respiratory pathogens was examined with the McNemar test. n = 56)* 5 (5\u20135) I felt comfortable when taking the swab myself (n = 56)* 5 (5\u20135) I would prefer taking a nasal swab myself and not having it taken by study personnel (n = 56)* 3 (2\u20133) Nasal self-swabbing was easy to perform (n = 56)* 5 (5\u20135) the -actin DNA concentration was higher in the self-collected swabs. the -actin DNA concentration was higher in the self-collected swabs. -actin DNA levels did not correlate with the duration of symptoms preceding the day of swab collection. a respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff- and in 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs collected on day 1. the most frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A, B or C (12/27 positive swabs, 44%), human coronavirus OC43 (4/27 swabs, 15%) and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 or 4 (4/27, 15%) values represent the percentages of pairs of staff- and self-collected swabs obtained in the study center (total n = 75 swab pairs, collected from 56 participants) a given pathogen was detected by real-time PCR in at least one swab. a viral pathogen was detected in 39% (21/67) of the self-collected swab from the right and in 37% (25/67) of swabs from the left nostril. however, this apparent difference was not significant (p = 0.22, McNemar test) the participants did not make a preference regarding self- or staff-collected nasal swabs. 75 matched pairs of staff- and self-collected nasal swabs were available. about 14% of these were taken on the day of symptom onset. the additional set of self-collected swabs was obtained in the majority of ARI episodes (71/75, 95%) of which swabs from both nostrils were returned. -actin DNA concentration was higher in the self-swabs collected on or after day 2 than in the self-swabs from day 1. a respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff- and in 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs collected on day 1. the most frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A, B or C (12/27 positive swabs, 44%) and human coronavirus OC43 (4/27 swabs, 15%) values represent the percentages of pairs of staff- and self-collected swabs obtained in the study center (total n = 75 swab pairs, collected from 56 participants) a given pathogen was detected by real-time PCR in at least one swab. 25% of the paired swabs were from participants who had more than one ARI episode during the study period. a viral pathogen was detected in 39% (21/67) of the self-collected swab from the right and in 37% (25/67) of swabs from the left nostril. however, this apparent difference was not significant. self-swabbing was not inferior in terms of acceptance, satisfaction, sample adequacy, and viral detection rate. the agreement between self- and staff-collected swabs collected the same day was somewhat less pronounced, but still was classified as substantial ( = 0.67). -actin DNA concentration was significantly higher in the self-collected than in staff-collected swabs. swabs that were collected the same day showed a higher number of epithelial cells and a tendency toward a higher -actin DNA level in a second self-swab that was collected immediately after the first one [8]. Alternatively, the presence of leukocytes in purulent secretions may have contributed to -actin levels in some swabs. anterior nasal self-swabbing for the detection of influenza virus infection still needs to be validated in dedicated studies. a flocked mid-turbinate swab was developed and turned out to be superior to the gold standard nasopharyngeal swab in terms of ARI virus detection. the anterior nasal swab used in the present study has not been compared to this midturbinate swab. this should be done in a future study. our findings are limited by the fact that the study was conducted in a selected study population recruited within a research institution."}
