{"summary": "malaria malaria is a global public health problem that hinders socio-economic development in vast regions of the world. it is estimated that 3 billion people from over 100 countries are exposed to the infection by one or more Plasmodium 1 species. in 2010 there were over 216-million clinical cases, over 650.000 of which were lethal. no malaria vaccine has been licensed for massive application in populations. however, rising evidence indicates the feasibility of developing vaccines. in individuals exposed to malarial infection, the naturally acquired immunity accumulates progressively during the first two decades of life. a third level in which the parasite s life cycle can be interrupted is the sporogonic phase. it is possible to interrupt the fertilization process and ookinete invasion to the mosquito s intestine. a functional vaccine against it must include components from at least the two most abundant species, P. falciparum and P. vivax. the homologous protein in P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) has reached maximum progress in its clinical development. the homologous protein in P. vivax has been analyzed in clinical trials in Phases I 17 and a Phase II study is under way. the approach used in the last two to three decades to design a malaria vaccine has been based on identifying \"subunits\" of the parasite. other methods have been tried like the production of vaccines from DNA and recombinant viruses. this process has given way to most advanced proteins being tested in clinical and preclinical phases. new strategies of antigen discovery Use of the Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) technology allowed learning that parasites from the Plasmodium genus have genomes composed by between 5000 and 6000 genes. this vertiginous development permitted learning that parasites from the Plasmodium genus have genomes composed by between 5000 and 6000 genes. is of protein libraries assembled on a same format generated through cloning and expression of large fragments of the genome of microorganisms. this proteomic technology permits simultaneous analysis of immunoreactive profile of hundreds of the organism s significant proteins or of its fragments. it is one of the most attractive approaches for large-scale discovery of new vaccine candidates. TAPF technology has been used with different pathogens to identify antigens recognized by the immune system after vaccination or infection with such microorganism 29. the most reactive antigens are selected for evaluation in different kind of studies, e.g., immunogenicity to determine their potential for vaccine development or to design immune-diagnostic methods. 4.75% of the totality of the genome were cloned, expressed and included in protein micro-arrays 32. the reactivity of these micro-arrays was then evaluated against serum samples from individuals vaccinated with irradiated sporozoites. those protected against infectious challenge react with greater intensity and at a higher number of antigens than those unprotected. 10 proteins from pre-erythrocytic stages were identified. these proteins were widely recognized by individuals from endemic regions. the peptide micro-arrays are now being used for functional evaluation of proteins. many of the epitopes recognized by antibodies represent three-dimensional surfaces of an antigen molecule. conformational epitopes depend on the position of the amino acids in the protein s three-dimensional structure, which is determined by the combination of its alpha helix, folded beta sheet, or coil structures. recent progress in chemical synthesis techniques have allowed the production of 95 fragments of 30-40 amino acids of length corresponding to P. falciparum proteins. all the antigens selected were evaluated to determine their antigenicity by using a panel of serum from donors from endemic zones 41. the immunogenicity of some of these fragments was evaluated in murine models. a total of 10 fragments have been preselected because of their high reactivity with serum from individuals from PNG. a total of 10 fragments have been preselected because of their high reactivity with serum from PNG and from Colombia. the large number of proteins produced by Plasmodium demand the use of high-performance tools for their identification, production, and analysis."}
