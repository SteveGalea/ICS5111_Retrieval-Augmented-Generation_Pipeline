{"summary": "a 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension and stroke was admitted to a tertiary hospital in Seoul, south Korea, with a 6-day fever, myalgia, and chill. a peripheral blood test revealed leukopenia (white blood cell count, 1,200/mm3; 48% neutrophil) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 42,000/mm3) no pleocytosis (WBC count, 4/L; 51% neutrophils) and normal protein (58.2 mg/dL) and glucose (79 mg/dL; ratio of glucose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] to that in serum, 0.54) levels. no bacteria, virus, or fungi were isolated from CSF. a male patient who recovered from SFTS in July 2016 agreed to donate plasma. on HD 4, we performed the first convalescent plasma therapy. the patient became comatose with persistent thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. the second donor\u2019s and patient\u2019s titers of SFTSV IgG were both 1:640 before the second plasma therapy. the patient\u2019s SFTSV IgG titer was 1:1,280 and the serum SFTSV viral load was 0.10 log copies/L. after that, virus RNA was no longer detectible by RT-PCR. studies are needed to determine whether early PE can prevent organ damage by lowering cytokines in animal models mimicking human SFTS infection. the use of convalescent plasma therapy in some viral infectious diseases has led to clinical improvement. PE may play a role in quashing the cytokine storm, especially during the early course of disease. convalescent plasma therapy as a salvage therapy may reduce viral load. this is a single case report and no controls not given these experimental therapies were included."}
