{"summary": "honeybee venom is a complicated defensive toxin that has a wide range of pharmacologically active compounds. manually (or reservoir disrupting) extracted glandular venom (GV) and venom extracted through the use of electrical stimulation (ESV) the proteomes of GV and ESV were compared using gel-based and gel-free proteomics approaches. honeybee venom is known to contain 12 proteins that are recognized as allergens in humans by the international Union of Immunological Societies. the allergic response to these proteins in a sting victim varies from swelling, redness, pain, itching around the sting site. the biochemical composition of honeybee venom has been reported to have a wide array of biomolecules. a comprehensive profiling of honeybee venom has been achieved using this robust MS platform. previous studies have been performed using a singular proteomics approach. a combination of gel-based and gel-free proteomics has proven to be an efficient protocol to increase proteome coverage of a biological sample. venom toxins are secretory proteins that undergo a series of post-translational modifications (PTMs) once released from the venom glands of the honeybee. venom toxins are secretory proteins that undergo a series of post-translational modifications (PTMs) once released from the venom glands of the honeybee, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and sulfation. the abundance of melittin, phospholipase A-2, and apamin preproprotein showed no significant differences between the two forms of venom. 53 of the 70 GV spots and 17 of the 24 ESV spots were successfully identified corresponding to 24 non-redundant proteins in GV and ESV. venom serine carboxypeptidase (Api m 7) and arginine kinase (arginine kinase) were found in GV. the other 17 specifically detected proteins in GV were involved in antioxidants. in total, 44 non-redundant proteins were identified in the two forms of bee venom, 16 proteins were shared in GV and ESV. in GV, 27 proteins were specifically expressed: 4 toxins and 23 non-toxins. in GV, only toxin MCD peptide was specifically expressed.

Hyaluronidase (Api m 2) facilitates the diffusion of other venom constituents through the interstitial space [29]. the higher abundance of all above allergens in ESV are thought to be a survival strategy of the honeybee to effectively defend individuals and the colonies they live in [31] peptide has reported anti-inflammatory activity at higher concentrations. most toxin proteins had either a higher abundance in ESV or were found in equal abundance in GV and ESV (melittin, apamin and secapin) in GV, many non-venom toxic proteins were identified even though manually milking of the venom from the gland was performed carefully. icarapin-like protein is suspected in evoking an immune response after a bee sting through protein phosphorylation. phospholipase A-2 is an important neurotoxic polypeptide, and its phosphorylation may participate in the modulation of Ca2+-activated K+channel. lyte and immobilized pH gradient strips were purchased from Bio-Rad. Dithiothreitol (DTT) and iodoacetamide (IAA) were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) the modified sequencing grade trypsin was from Roche (Mississauga, ON, Canada) the bees stung the nylon taffeta under which was a glass collection plate. the venom dried rapidly on glass plates and was scraped off with a knife. silver-stained gel slices were excised and destained in a 200 l solution (30 mmol/L K3Fe(CN)6: 100 mmol/L Na2S2O3 = 1:1) until the gel spots were transparent, then dried for 10 min with ACN (100%) the gel slices were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 hour and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h in the dark. all gels were matched with one of the selected reference gels. protein abundance represented as means and standard deviations from triplicate experiments. only spots statistically significant with at least 2-fold changes and p 0.05 were considered to be differential protein spots. the LC-chip used for analysis of the 2-DE protein spots was the same as that used for1-DE, but the enrichment column was 40 nL. the mass spectrometric conditions of Han et al. were followed. protein identification Tandem mass spectra were retrieved using massHunter software. MS/MS data was searched using in-house Mascot (version 2.4.0, Matrix Science, UK) the protein abundance identified by 1-DE and shotgun analyses was estimated by the exponentially modified Protein Abundance Index (emPAI) [58] an error probability of p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. peptide identification used cutoff score of >20 (10 lgP) and FDR 0.1%. incorrect peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) of modified peptides have equal chance of being derived from either the target or decoy database. venom samples were collected from five colonies of italian honeybees. manual (or reservoir disrupting) venom extraction was performed. 100 guard bees were captured near the entrance and anesthetized by chilling at 20\u00b0C. one-Dimensional gel electrophoresis (1-DE) 1-DE was performed by the previously described protocol. the protein sample was divided into three parts for the following analysis. two-Dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) 2-DE was performed by a previously described protocol. three independent and reproducible 2-DE gel images from the two venom samples were digitized with Image Scanner III. the digested protein spots were analyzed by the LC-MS/MS system. the LC-chip used for analysis of 1-DE gel slices was constituted of a Zorbax 300SB-C18 enrichment column (160 nL, 5 m) and a Zorbax 300SB-C18 analytical column (75 m 150 mm, 5 m) the peptides were separated using a PL-SCX (50 0.3 mm, 1000, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) exchange media online. each fraction was analyzed using the same mass spectrometric parameters as 1-DE. ogaster (downloaded April, 2012), Sacharomyces cerevisiae (downloaded April, 2012) and a common repository of adventitious proteins were searched using in-house Mascot. the false discovery rate (FDR) for the shotgun and 1-DE analyses was set at 1% when the decoy sequences were included. phosphopeptide enrichment using IMAC was followed by Yu et.al with minor modification. dissolved phosphopeptides in 35 l of 0.1% FA were subject to MS analysis. decoy database approach is used to estimate the false discovery rate for modified peptide identification. the success of two consecutive b- or y-type site-determining ions was required to assign a confident site. no ethical use approval is necessary. authors declare that they have no competing interests. the ratio of the protein abundance is ESV to GV. negative values denote higher protein abundance in GV. panel A, B and C are comparison of protein abundance analyzed by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1-DE), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) five-year development (2011\u20132015) (2011BAD33B04)."}
