{"summary": "ERVA is the leading cause of diarrhea in neonatal foals. the genotypes G3P[12] and G14P[12] are the most prevalent. infections by strains with other genomic arrangements are infrequent. the identification of circulating strains of ERVA is critical for diagnostic and surveillance purposes. multiplex RT-qPCR assay had a high sensitivity/specificity for every target. this assay had a high overall agreement (98%) compared to conventional RT-PCR and sequencing."}
