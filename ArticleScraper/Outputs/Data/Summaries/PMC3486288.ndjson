{"summary": "some positive-sense RNA viruses can be classified further into the picornavirus-like supercluster. they include viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae families. the development and implementation of the PV vaccine in children for the prevention of poliomyelitis represent successful control of viral diseases. a common feature of the viruses in the picornavirus-like supercluster is that they possess a viral 3C or 3C-like protease (3Cpro or 3CLpro, respectively) the 3Cpro and 3CLpro share several common characteristics, including a typical chymotrypsin-like fold; a Cys residue as an active site nucleophile in the catalytic triad (or dyad) dyad and substrate binding pockets shown by high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) structures of 3Cpro and 3CLpro of these viruses (2, 19, 29, 30, 45, 46) protease inhibitors (28, 40), including a dipeptidyl aldehyde (GC373) and an -ketoamide (GC375). GC376 covalently bound to Cys 139, Cys 147, and Cys 144 of NV 3CLpro, PV 3Cpro, and TGEV 3CLpro respectively. compounds have broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple viruses in the picornavirus-like supercluster, including important classical and emerging animal and human pathogens. all cells except for HG23 cells were obtained from ATCC. cDNAs for 3Cpro or 3CLpro of TGEV and HAV were synthesized fused with 6 His residues. expression and purification of 3Cpro and 3CLpro were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) protease assay performed as follows. each protease was mixed with serial dilutions of each compound or with DMSO in 25 l of assay buffer. wavelength of 460 nm on a fluorescence microplate reader (FLx800; Biotek, Winooski, VT) 1 h following the addition of substrate. the dose-dependent FRET inhibition curves were fitted with a variable slope by using GraphPad Prism software. TGEV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, PV, poliomyelitis virus, HRV, human rhinovirus, FMDV, foot-and-mouth disease virus were incubated at 37\u00b0C, except for HRV-infected HeLa cells. the effects of each compound on viral replication were examined in cell culture systems. the primers and probes used for real-time qRT-PCR included: 45\u00b0C for 30 min and 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. the IC50s were determined by GraphPad Prism software.

X-ray diffraction data were collected at Advanced Photon Source beamline 17-ID using a Dectris Pilatus 6 M pixel array detector. effects of GC375 (a dipeptidyl -ketoamide) were moderate (2.87 to 4.02 M) against proteases of caliciviruses and coronaviruses. GC375 showed weak but appreciable inhibitory effects on HAV 3Cpro compared to GC373 and GC376. the IC50s are means standard errors of the means for two or three independent tests with each optimized protease assay. both GC373 and GC376 were significantly effective against caliciviruses (NV and MNV-1), coronaviruses (TGEV, FIPV, MHV, 229E, and BCV), and picornaviruses (HRVs 18, 51, and 68, EV71, and PTV) rupintrivir did not inhibit the replication of MNV-1, FCV, and MHV at concentrations up to 50 M or 100 M. all compounds, including rupintrivir, did not show any nonspecific cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 500 M in the cells used for virus replication in this study. the IC50s are averages for 3 independent tests and were determined by real-time qRT-PCR. the apo-NV 3CLpro structure represents a new crystal form of NV 3CLpro (PDB accession no. 2FYQ) crystal structures of apo-NV 3CLpro and NV 3CLpro in complex with GC376 refined to 1.65- resolution. NV 3CLpro existed as a noncrystallographic dimer that was nearly identical to that observed for the apo crystal form. RMSD of 0.80 and 0.68 between the C atoms for chains A and B. the largest differences were observed in the loop containing Gln 110. all other residues that form hydrogen bonds to the compound are in similar positions. Fo Fc omit map contoured at 3 for GC376. GC376 (red) in the S1 and S2 positions of the active site of TGEV 3CLpro. the proteases of a picornavirus (PV 3Cpro) and a coronavirus (TGEV 3CLpro) were selected to study the interaction with GC376 in comparison to that of NV 3CLpro. the GC376-bound structures of PV 3Cpro and TGEV 3CLpro are similar overall to the corresponding apo crystal forms. hydrogen bond interactions between Thr 47, Phe 139, His 162, and Glu 165 in the protease and the compound are shown in Fig. 3I. the interactions between PV 3Cpro and GC376 also lead to conformational changes in loops containing Leu 127, Gly 128, and Gly 164 to accommodate hydrogen bonding. GC373 (dipeptidyl aldehyde) was previously shown to be effective against NV 3CLpro (40), inhibited the activities of all viral proteases except for HAV 3Cpro. it was effective against the proteases of caliciviruses (NV and MD145 virus), coronaviruses (TGEV and SARS-CoV) and picornaviruses. the IC50s are means standard errors of the means for two or three independent tests with each optimized protease assay. both GC373 and GC376 were significantly effective against caliciviruses (NV and MNV-1), coronaviruses (TGEV, FIPV, MHV, 229E, and BCV) FCV was less sensitive to GC373 and GC376, with IC50s of 65 and 35 M, respectively. GC375 showed significant antiviral effects against NV and all coronaviruses and picornaviruses, including HAV. rupintrivir did not inhibit the replication of NV at concentrations up to 50 M or 100 M. 0.1 1.5 0.3 4.5 0.4 0.25 0.1 0.8 0.2 19.5 2.1 15.2 1.3 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 1.1 0.3 0.15 0.1 0.6 0.2 50.2 5.6 10.3 2.4 0.15 0.1 Rupintrivir >50 >50 2.5 0.7 10.3 1.3 >100 0.3 0.1 15.3 2.5 >100 0.5 0.2 0.15 0.1 a The IC50s are averages for 3 independent tests. NV 3CLpro structure was similar to a previously reported crystal structure of NV 3CLpro (PDB accession no. 2FYQ) (46) the largest differences were observed in certain loop regions of the protease, including Met 101 to Arg 112, Lys 146 to Val 152 and Thr 161 to Thr 166. the 6-membered aromatic ring of the compound is not included in the modeling due to disorder. the aromatic ring of the compound is not included in the modeling due to disorder. the glutamine surrogate ring and the leu of GC376 fit into the S1 and S2 sites. the aromatic ring of the inhibitor (green) was not included in the model due to disorder. the aromatic ring of the inhibitor (green) was not included in the model due to disorder. apo and ligand-bound forms are colored magenta and cyan. hydrogen bonds that form between Gln 110 and the inhibitor are indicated by dashed lines. hydrogen bond interactions between amino acid residues His 40, Leu 127, Gly 128, Thr 142, Thr 142, and Glu 165 in the protease and the compound are shown in Fig. 3F. the largest differences that occur upon ligand binding were observed in the loops containing leu 127, Gly 128, and Thr 142. a single water-mediated contact was observed in 3 of the 4 subunits. a single water-mediated contact was observed in a similar position. the water molecules fit well to the electron density maps. the NV and MD145 strains belong to norovirus genotypes I, II, and III. noroviruses of these genotypes are associated with the majority of norovirus outbreaks in humans. PV is responsible for an acute hepatitis, affecting tens of millions of individuals each year in areas with poor hygiene standards. FMDV is highly contagious in domestic livestock, and FMDV outbreaks can result in devastating economic losses and international trade embargoes. GC375 was as potent as or more potent than GC373 and GC376 against the majority of coronaviruses and picornaviruses tested, including HAV. GC375 was less effective than GC373 and GC376 against NV replication, and even less effective against replication of FCV and MNV-1. 3CLpro resembled that of acetyl-Glu-Phe-Gln-Leu-Gln-CHCHCOO to norovirus 3CLpro, with irreversible covalent binding to Cys 139 (19). the cocrystal structure of the TGEV 3CLpro-GC376 complex also demonstrated similar binding interactions between the protease and the compound. these results confirm the conserved key sites of 3Cpro or 3CLpro as attractive targets for the design a bisulfite adduct compound behaves as a prodrug of the precursor aldehyde. it may act as a prodrug of the aldehyde inhibitor (GC373). it may act as a prodrug of the aldehyde inhibitor (GC373). the compounds in this study were found to be generally as potent as rupintrivir against caliciviruses and picornaviruses. the compounds in this study were found to be generally as potent as rupintrivir against caliciviruses and picornaviruses. the high efficacy and low toxicity of the compounds described herein suggest that they may be suitable candidates for further development as antivirals against one or more viruses."}
