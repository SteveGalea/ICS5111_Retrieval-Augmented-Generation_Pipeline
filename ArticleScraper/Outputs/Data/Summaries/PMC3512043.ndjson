{"summary": "the association and dissociation of protein complexes is of enormous biological significance, especially because most proteins exist in such forms in vivo. the study initially focused on interactions between folded, fully structured proteins. however, more recently, there has been increasing interest in association of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) these coupled folding and binding reactions are predicted to be widespread in biology (5). dissociation constant (A), association rate constant (B), and dissociation rate constant (C) for various ordered (open bars) and disordered (closed bars) dimeric complexes are displayed in paired histograms. complexes between two ordered proteins are more stable, with lower dissociation rate constants. urea concentrations shown are that accessible for the study of the protein-protein association reaction, since above 3 M urea the neighboring 1 domain begins to unfold. there is now a wealth of data on the thermodynamics of IDP binding, but few studies that assess the effects of mutagenesis on the kinetics of binding. recent studies on the artificial model system, S-peptide and S-protein (13), and various peptides binding PDZ domains (14,15) are we used an alternative approach to study two-state association kinetics. a significant advantage to using this approach is the quick access to an estimate of Kd for the complex, without the need for high concentrations and/or isothermal titration calorimetry equipment. each spectrin repeat is a folded, 106-amino-acid (aa), three-helix bundle. the long - and -spectrin associate to form 22 tetramers on the intracellular side of the cell membranes. many mutations have been reported that affect this critical interaction and lead to disease (16,35) no structural information is available for unbound 1617; a representation was made using pdb 3LBX. a complete analysis of association of recombinantly expressed human eyrthrocyte - and -spectrin constructs. the variances of the disordered and ordered groups were statistically significant for k+ (p = 0.0014) however, we obtained very similar p-values using both the Kruskal-Wallis test (p = 0.55) and a Welch\u2019s t-test (p = 0.54). the difference in association rate constant between the two groups is not statistically significant. the harvested cells were sonicated and centrifuged. the protein was purified from the soluble fraction by affinity chromatography. all proteins were stored at 4\u00b0C in PBS. Irreversible association model A + B k + A B (Scheme 1) For irreversible association described by Scheme 1, the concentration of protein A is equal to that of protein B. the concentration of the complex is [ A B ] = [ A ] T 2 k + t / 1 + [ A ] T k + t, as previously described (38), where k+ is the association rate constant. integration of Eq. 4 with Eq. 1 leads to Eq. 5, a general equation for describing the system fluorescence in a reversible system, which applies equally for association and dissociation kinetic traces. b = K d 2 [ A ] T, z = K d 2 + 4 K d [ A ] T, and [AB]0 is the concentration of complex at the start of the reaction. Isothermal titration calorimetry ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC from MicroCal (GE) 1617, 16-50 M, was titrated 14\u201320 injections, at 1000-s intervals, of 01 (150\u2013600 M) protein concentrations were confirmed by absorbance spectroscopy. the variances of the groups are not statistically significant at the 5% level for either Kd (p = 0.095) or k (p = 0.19) according to a Conover test, demonstrating that the Kruskal-Wallis test was appropriate in these cases. the variances of the disordered and ordered groups were statistically significant for k+ (p = 0.0014) the harvested cells were sonicated and centrifuged. the protein was purified from the soluble fraction by affinity chromatography. all proteins were stored at 4\u00b0C in PBS. Irreversible association model A + B k + A B (Scheme 1) For irreversible association described by Scheme 1, the concentration of protein A is equal to that of protein B. the concentration of the complex is [ A B ] = [ A ] T 2 k + t / 1 + [ A ] T k + t, as previously described. integration of Eq. 4 with Eq. 1 leads to Eq. 5, a general equation for describing the system fluorescence in a reversible system. the concentration of complex in the syringe ([AB]syr) was calculated using Eq. 6, where [A]T,syr is the total concentration of protein A in the syringe. Irreversible association model A + B k + A B (Scheme 1) For irreversible association described by Scheme 1, the concentration of the complex is [ A B ] = [ A ] T 2 k + t / 1 + [ A ] T k + t. the fluorescence throughout the reaction can simply be described by Eq. integration of Eq. 4 leads to Eq. 5, a general equation for describing the system fluorescence in a reversible system. b = K d 2 [ A ] T, z = K d 2 + 4 K d [ A ] T, and [AB]0 is the concentration of complex at the start of the reaction. yr was calculated using Eq. 6, where [A]T,syr is the total concentration of protein A in the syringe: [ A ] s y r = 2 [ A ] T, s y r + K d ( K d + 2 [ A ] T, s y r 2 2. the data fit poorly to the simple irreversible model (Scheme 1, Eq. 2 (38). a significant back reaction is expected, given the Kd values for almost equivalent pairs of domains of 0.4 0.1 M (16), 1.1 0.1 M (18) and 0.84 M (25) that have been reported previously. milla et al. (39) and milla et al. (40) have required at least one further variable to be fixed (typically F or F0) fluorescence stopped-flow traces of association and dissociation of the spectrin tetramerization domain and accompanying fit residuals for irreversible (blue; Eq. 2 and single-exponential equation) the association rate constant can be extracted from the association kinetic traces (k = Kdk+), providing estimates of k (k> = (2.6 1.2) 104 s1), which are also independent of concentration. k+ and k were lower by an order of magnitude. k+(H2O) and Kd(H2O) values are better approximated. the weighted averages for the equilibrium constant and association rate constant were Kd(H2O)> = 0.39 0.02 M and k+> = 630 20 M1 s1, respectively. spectrin complex was induced by pre-equilibrating a 1:1 molar mixture of 01 and 1617 in the absence of denaturant for 2 h followed by rapid mixing to varying concentrations of urea. all unfolding kinetic traces experienced some drift in fluorescence signal and all fits included a linear drift term. k values and m values from the unfolding data have weighted averages of k> = (2.61 0.16) 104 s1 and m> = 0.85 0.02 kcal mol1 M1 agree very well with those calculated from the folding kinetic traces. the data for the urea-induced dissociation of the spectrin tetramerization domain also fit surprisingly well to a single-exponential function. a significant back reaction is expected, given the Kd values for almost equivalent pairs of domains of 0.4 0.1 M (16), 1.1 0.1 M (18) and 0.84 M (25) that have been reported previously. we considered a reversible kinetic model (Scheme 2, Materials and Methods), where a significant back reaction is also in operation. tetramerization domain and accompanying fit residuals for irreversible (blue; Eq. 2 and single-exponential equation) and reversible (red; Eq. 5) schemes. association of domains after 1:1 mixing of 01 and 1617 domains at 1:1 molar ratios at 0 M urea (A). surface-attached surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (25) showed k+ and k were lower by an order of magnitude. association and folding in the presence of denaturant Denaturants such as urea slow the folding and binding of dimeric proteins through the destabilization of partially structured transition states. urea destabilized the final structured complex relative to the dissociated subunits, with ln(Kd) increasing linearly with denaturant concentration. ln(kd) increased linearly with denaturant concentration, suggesting that meq = 1.20 0.03 kcal mol1 M1. there was an upper limit to the final concentration of urea investigated. the neighboring folded spectrin (1) began to unfold significantly. all unfolding kinetic traces experienced some drift in fluorescence signal and all fits included a linear drift term. however, to aid the fitting process, we rewrote the exponential rate constant in terms of k rather than k+. the data for the urea-induced dissociation of the spectrin tetramerization domain fit surprisingly well to a single-exponential function (with linear drift term) however, the rate constants obtained in this manner show poorer linearity with urea and display greater sensitivity to the total spectrin concentration. an example of this is found in the irreversible fits to the folding and unfolding data presented here. the Kd we obtained from our fitting matched very well with that from the well established equilibrium technique of ITC. both estimates are close to that obtained for a very similar pair of spectrin domains by Gaetani et al. (16) meq is similar to the values obtained from the unfolding of isolated spectrin domains R15 (1.8 0.1 kcal mol1 M1), R16 (1.9 0.1 kcal mol1 M1), and R17 (2.0 0.1 kcal mol1 M1) determined by equilibrium denaturation. the association rate constant of the spectrin domains (630 M1 s1, an order of magnitude faster than that determined using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy) is notable the importance of this interaction in vivo is manifested by the fact that most mutations of spectrin domains related to hereditary hemolytic anaemias are associated with this tetramerization site. in vivo, these proteins are bound to the membrane, which perhaps accelerate their association by positioning the proteins in an orientation favorable for binding. fitting with the irreversible model will always overestimate the dissociation rate constant, to an extent that depends on the relative sizes of Kd and protein concentration. we found that fitting with the irreversible model could obtain comparably good fits to the individual kinetic traces."}
