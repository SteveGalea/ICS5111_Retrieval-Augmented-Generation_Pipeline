{"summary": "all Chlamydia species share a dimorphic developmental cycle that allows them to survive within the hostile environment of the host cell. the bacteria begin remodeling the inclusion membrane by insertion of bacterial proteins that promote segregation of the inclusion from the classical endosomal/lysosomal transport pathway. bacterial pathogens require host-derived membrane lipids, including sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol, for intracellular growth and development [6], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [13], [14]. SM biosynthesis is also required for homotypic fusion of multiple inclusions within the same cell as well as for inclusion membrane stability [15]. Arf1 activation is spatially and temporally regulated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GBF1 (Golgi-specific BFA resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) and BIG1/BIG2 (BFA-inhibited guanine nucleotide exchange proteins 1 and 2) which are present in the cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi. ceramide from the ER to the trans-Golgi is converted to SM by a cytosolic lipid transfer protein called CERT. CERT has three functional domains, an N-terminal PH (pleckstrin homology) domain that binds phosphoinositide-4-phosphate (PI4P) at the trans-Golgi. we examined the role of specific host proteins required for vesicular and non-vesicular lipid transport during Chlamydia infection. we found that C. trachomatis selectively co-opts GBF1 within the cis-Golgi compartment for vesicle-mediated SM acquisition. this source of SM contributes to inclusion membrane growth and stability but that GBF1 function is not required for bacterial replication. we first examined the localization of Arf1-GFP, GBF1 and BIG1 during C. trachomatis infection of HeLa cells. we found that GBF1 and BIG1 were localized to the fragmented Golgi around the inclusion in uninfected cells. similar results were obtained in cells expressing GFP-tagged GBF1. HeLa cells were infected with C. trachomatis L2 for 24 hrs. they were then fixed and stained with antibodies to GBF1 (red) and BIG1 (green) cis and trans polarity of the Golgi was maintained in the cells. cells were infected with C. trachomatis for 24 hrs, treated with 10 M BFA or GCA. they were then labeled with BODIPY FL-Ceramide to analyze SM acquisition. the average inclusion size in GBF1-depleted cells was decreased by 40% (p0.001) compared to control siRNA-treated cells. depletion of BIG1 and/or BIG2 gave rise to inclusions that were slightly larger than those observed in control siRNA-treated cells. the reason for the increase in progeny is not currently known. 80% of infected cells in which GBF1 function was inhibited showed broken inclusions. the loss of inclusion membrane integrity was observed at mid- to late times of infection. 80% of infected cells in which GBF1 function was inhibited exhibited broken inclusions. new studies have shown that inclusion is stabilized by a cage-like structure composed of F-actin and vimentin. inhibition of SM biosynthesis did not result in alteration of the vimentin or actin structure around the inclusion [15], experiments using BFA have revealed that perturbations in vesicular trafficking lead to reciprocal changes in the architecture of the vimentin network in the host cell. ceramide transport protein, CERT and its ER binding protein, VAP-A, are recruited to the inclusion. ceramide transport from the ER to the trans-Golgi by the cytosolic lipid transporter, CERT, is the predominant pathway for SM biosynthesis. CERT-GFP was recruited to inclusions as early as 2 hpi. nascent inclusions were enveloped by CERT-GFP-containing vesicles. images shown are maximum intensity projections of confocal z-stacks. CERT-GFP and HcRedVAP-A colocalize on the inclusion membrane. images shown are maximum intensity projections of confocal z-stacks. ceramide serves as a substrate for SM synthesis by trans-Golgi localized SMS1 and SMS2. casein Kinase I2 (CKI2) plays a crucial role in down-regulating CERT activity [48], and (3) depletion of CERT by siRNA. we observed a dose-dependent decrease in inclusion formation (Figures 4A) and progeny production (Figure 4B) in cells exposed to HPA-12, resulting in a 96% reduction in progeny at 10 M HPA-12 compared to DMSO (p0.001). HA-CKI2 decreased inclusion size but did not affect CERT-GFP recruitment to the inclusion membrane. CERT depletion reduced inclusion size and progeny formation. ceramide, though CERT is still able to interact with VAP-A at the ER, is sufficient to inhibit CERT function. in cells co-transfected with CERT-GFP and HA-tagged CKI2, we observed a significant defect in inclusion development. CERT-GFP was still recruited to the inclusion in cells expressing HA-tagged CKI2. the exposure time for each filter set of all images was identical. images shown are maximum intensity projections of confocal z-stacks (0.4-m slices) CERT-GFP localization to the inclusion was unaffected by Arf1 inhibition. CERT depletion of CERT led to a significant reduction in inclusion size. we monitored lipid transport in presence of the CERT inhibitor, HPA-12. inclusions in HPA-12-treated cells showed 56% decrease in fluorescence intensity. ceramide appeared to be highly enriched in the region adjacent to the inclusion in what is likely to be the surrounding ER. ceramide and CERT-GFP did not overlap on the inclusion membrane. ceramide and CERT-GFP did not overlap on the inclusion membrane. ceramide binding is required for CERT recruitment to the inclusion. CERT transfer activity and ceramide binding are required for SM biosynthesis. ceramide binding is required for CERT recruitment to the inclusion. CERT (G67E)-GFP and CERT (D324A)-GFP localized to the inclusion at 24 hpi. none is observed for CERT (G67E)-GFP (Figure 6A) co-staining with antibodies to Calnexin revealed that although the ER appears in close proximity to the inclusion, it does not overlap with CERT (G67E)-GFP. treated cells revealed a 64% decrease (p0.001), Exo1 had no effect on CERT recruitment to the inclusion. PI4P, VAP-A, or Arf1 binding may function redundantly. CERT-GFP was still recruited to inclusions in cells treated with GCA, BFA, or Nocodazole, which disrupts microtubules. the exposure time for each filter set for all images was identical. images represent a single z slice from confocal images. images represent a single z slice from confocal images. in uninfected cells, both SMS1 and SMS2 are found at the trans-Golgi. in uninfected cells, both SMS1 and SMS2 are found at the trans-Golgi. in contrast, C-terminally 3xFLAG-tagged SMS2 localized to the fragmented Golgi surrounding the inclusion. membrane was confirmed by co-staining infected cells expressing SMS2-V5 with antibodies to IncA. inclusion-membrane localized SMS2-V5 appeared to partially overlap with IncA. no overlap was seen between IncA and SMS1-V5. SMS1 and SMS2 are required for host SM production. but their relative contributions to subcellular SM levels are distinct. cells were depleted of SMS1 or SMS2 by siRNA. depleted of SMS1 or SMS2 for 3 days and then labeled with BODIPY FL-Ceramide to analyze SM accumulation in the Golgi. scale bar = 5 m. (C and D) cells were analyzed for inclusion size and production of infectious progeny. we first examined the localization of Arf1-GFP, GBF1 and BIG1 during C. trachomatis infection of HeLa cells. we found that GBF1 and BIG1 were localized to the fragmented Golgi around the inclusion in uninfected cells. similar results were obtained in cells expressing GFP-tagged GBF1. HeLa cells were transfected with Arf1-GFP for 18 hrs, infected with C. trachomatis L2 for 24 hrs. then fixed and stained with antibodies to GBF1 (red) and BIG1 (green) HeLa cells were depleted of GBF1, BIG1, and/or BIG2 for 3 days. the exposure time for all images was identical. dashed red lines demarcate the inclusions. the average inclusion size in GBF1-depleted cells was decreased by 40% (p0.001) compared to control siRNA-treated cells. depletion of BIG1 and/or BIG2 gave rise to inclusions that were slightly larger than those observed in control siRNA-treated cells. the reason for the increase in progeny is not currently known. 80% of infected cells in which GBF1 function was inhibited exhibited broken inclusions. the loss of inclusion membrane integrity was observed at mid- to late times of infection. arrows point to the region on the inclusion that is devoid of vimentin staining. inclusion stabilized by a cage-like structure composed of F-actin and vimentin. inhibition of SM biosynthesis did not result in alteration of the vimentin or actin structure around the inclusion. ceramide transport protein, CERT and its ER binding protein, VAP-A, are recruited to the inclusion. ceramide transport from the ER to the trans-Golgi is the predominant pathway for SM biosynthesis. ceramide transport from the ER to the trans-Golgi is the predominant pathway for SM biosynthesis. CERT-GFP was recruited to inclusions as early as 2 hpi. nascent inclusions were enveloped by CERT-GFP-containing vesicles. images shown are maximum intensity projections of confocal z-stacks. CERT-GFP and HcRedVAP-A colocalize on inclusion membrane. images shown are maximum intensity projections of confocal z-stacks. ceramide serves as a substrate for SM synthesis by trans-Golgi. Kinase I2 (CKI2) plays a crucial role in down-regulating CERT activity [48] and (3) depletion of CERT by siRNA. we first examined inclusion morphology and progeny production in cells treated with increasing concentrations of HPA-12. cells were infected for 1 hr and then incubated in the absence or presence of HPA-12 for an additional 23 hrs. I2 decreased inclusion size but did not affect CERT-GFP recruitment to the inclusion membrane. CERT depletion reduced inclusion size and progeny formation. CERT is still able to interact with VAP-A at the ER [61]. overexpression of CKI2 is sufficient to inhibit CERT function. in cells co-transfected with CERT-GFP and HA-tagged CKI2 we observed a significant defect in inclusion development. this is similar to the results observed with HPA-12. the exposure time for each filter set of all images was identical. images shown are maximum intensity projections of confocal z-stacks (0.4-m slices) CERT-GFP localization to the inclusion was unaffected by Arf1 inhibition. depletion of CERT led to a significant reduction in inclusion size. we monitored lipid transport in presence of the CERT inhibitor, HPA-12. inclusions in HPA-12-treated cells showed 56% decrease in fluorescence intensity. treatment with HPA-12, D609, and BFA-treated cells showed a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity of the inclusion and its contents compared to DMSO-treated samples. ceramide appeared to be highly enriched in the region adjacent to the inclusion in what is likely to be the surrounding ER. ceramide binding is required for CERT recruitment to the inclusion. CERT transfer activity and ceramide binding are required for its recruitment to the inclusion. the presence of PI4P at the inclusion raises the possibility that CERT could be recruited. CERT (G67E)-GFP and CERT (D324A)-GFP localized to the inclusion at 24 hpi. none is observed for CERT (G67E)-GFP (Figure 6A) co-staining with antibodies to Calnexin revealed that although the ER appears in close proximity to the inclusion, it does not overlap with CERT-WT, D324A, or G67E at the inclusion. PI4P, VAP-A, or Arf1 binding may function redundantly or there may be other determinants within CERT. CERT-GFP was still recruited to inclusions in cells treated with GCA, BFA, or Nocodazole. vesicular trafficking, and microtubules are not required for CERT recruitment. scale bar = 5 m, except the insets where scale bar = 2.5 m. images represent a single z slice from confocal images. exposure time for each filter set for all images was identical. CERT-GFP was still present in the golgi surrounding the inclusion. ceramide binding and/or transfer activity of CERT is required. in uninfected cells, both SMS1 and SMS2 are found at the trans-Golgi. in uninfected cells, both SMS1 and SMS2 are found at the trans-Golgi. infected cells expressing SMS2-V5 were staining with antibodies to IncA. inclusion-membrane localized SMS2-V5 appeared to partially overlap with IncA. no overlap was seen between IncA and SMS1-V5. SMS1 and SMS2 are required for host SM production. but their relative contributions to subcellular SM levels are distinct. cells were depleted of SMS1 or SMS2 by siRNA. cells were depleted of SMS1 or SMS2 for 3 days and then labeled with BODIPY FL-Ceramide. the exposure time of all images was identical. C. trachomatis recruits CERT, its ER binding partner VAP-A, and SM synthases to establish an on-site SM biosynthetic factory at or near the inclusion that is critical for C. trachomatis replication. we found that depletion or inhibition of CERT significantly impaired production of infectious progeny and SM acquisition. trans-Golgi localized SMS1 and SMS2 could be transferred to inclusion by a BFA-insensitive vesicular trafficking pathway. CERT transfers ceramide from the ER to the inclusion. SM is then transferred to the inclusion by a BFA-insensitive pathway. the inclusion membrane localized SMS2 and CERT are not disrupted by BFA, GCA, or Nocodazole. the inclusion membrane localized SMS2 and CERT are not disrupted by BFA, GCA, or Nocodazole, which may explain why bacterial replication is not affected by these drugs. a small amount of ceramide and/or VAP-A may be incorporated into the inclusion membrane from either the plasma membrane during endocytosis or by fusion with the ER or ER-derived vesicles containing ceramide. further studies are needed to determine whether CERT transfer activity or ceramide binding alone is necessary for its recruitment to the inclusion. CERT has access to ceramide via CERT and at least one SMS isoform. previous work has suggested that there is an intimate association of the ER or ER proteins with the chlamydial inclusion. CERT and VAP-A together may be important for the inclusion to obtain other essential lipids. if the loss of inclusion integrity is a direct or indirect consequence of the collapse of the closely associated cytoskeletal cage or if it results from the loss of SM acquisition, remains to be determined. if the loss of inclusion integrity is a direct or indirect consequence of the collapse of the closely associated cytoskeletal cage. poliovirus and coxsackievirus encode a protein (3A) that binds to and co-opts GBF1 function. L. pneumophila secretes into the cell RalF that regulates Arf1 localization to the L. pneumophila-containing phagosome. it is possible that GBF1 communicates indirectly with the inclusion through a variety of host proteins or lipids that have been shown to bind GBF1.
