{"summary": "aromatase inhibitors (AIs) reduce the synthesis of estrogens and offer a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancers. the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) are mostly azole type compounds, such as the clinically used anastrozole and letrozole. they mimic the natural substrate androstenedione and are converted by the enzyme to reactive intermediates, which bind irreversibly to the enzyme active site. lecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) are two of the most widely used quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D QSAR) methodologies. coMFA calculates the energies of steric and electrostatic interactions between the compound and the probe atom at various intersections of a regular 3D lattice. the resulting energies derived from these two potential functions can be contoured to offer a quantitative spatial description of the molecular properties. the best model was used as a 3D query for virtual screening against NCI2000 database. the biological activities of hit compounds were further predicted by using CoMFA and CoMSIA models. 32 1-OCOCF3; 2-MeOPh(p) 7.00 5.155 33 1-OCOCF3; 2-COCH3; 3-Ph 6.57 5.182 34 a

sterically favored regions, yellow contours (20% contribution) indicate sterically disfavored regions. the coMFA electrostatic contour map is shown in Figure 4b. the red areas are the regions where a negative potential is favorable to activity, while a negative potential is unfavorable in the blue areas. figure 5b shows the HBA contour maps, in which magenta and red contours represent areas where HBA substituents are expected. it is supported by the case that all the studied compounds have at least one HBA atom in those positions. compound 13 (Formestane) show quite high bioactivity because of its three HBA atoms in those positions. model contains two acceptor atoms and four hydrophobic centers. four hydrophobic centers mean the centers of A, B, C and D rings of steroids, and two acceptor atoms next to C-3 of the ring A and C-17 of the ring D. the selected model (Model_04) is indicated in boldface. the selected model includes two acceptor atoms (green) and four hydrophobic centers

indicates that the steric and HBA fields mainly contribute to the binding affinities. the corresponding field contributions of steric and HBA are 0.677 and 0.323, respectively. the obtained r2pred of the test set is 0.658, 0.601 for the CoMFA, CoMSIA model, respectively, which indicates that both models have good predictive ability. the observed and predicted pIC50 of the training and test sets by

for the CoMFA model with the most active inhibitor compound 7 is shown in Figure 4a. green contours represent regions of high steric bulk tolerance (80% contribution), while yellow contours represent regions of low steric bulk tolerance (20% contribution) it can be seen that a large green contour near C-6 of the ring B indicates a bulky group in this position is favorable to bioactivity. this figure displays two red contours around C-3 of the ring A and one red contour near C-4 of the ring A. this means that the bioactivity can be enhanced if an electronegative atom is present in these areas. it is supported that most of the studied compounds have electronegative atoms on C-3 or C-4 of the ring A. magenta and red contours represent areas where HBA substituents are favored and disfavored respectively. one is next to C-3 of the ring A, another is near C-4 of the ring A, and the third is close to C-17 of the ring D. this indicates that the activity can be enhanced if the HBA atoms are present in these there positions. two acceptor atoms next to C-3 of the ring A and C-17 of the ring D indicate that hydrogen bond acceptor atoms in these positions can enhance the activity. the selected model (Model_04) is indicated in boldface. the selected model includes two acceptor atoms (green) and four hydrophobic centers (cyan) the sphere sizes indicate query tolerances. compounds 1\u20133 [22], compounds 4\u201313 [23], compounds 14\u201317 [24], compounds 18\u201324 [25], compounds 25\u201328 [26] and compounds 29\u201366 [27] were used for this analysis. the pIC50 values of

structure shown in Figure 7. a 3D cubic lattice with grid spacing of 2.0 in X, Y and Z directions was created automatically by SYBYL. PLS method with cross-validation (leave-one-out) was used in SYBYL to determine the optimal numbers of components by using cross-validated coefficient q2 (r2cv) after obtaining the optimal numbers of components, a PLS analysis was performed with no validation and column filtering 2.0 to generate the final model with the training set. the pIC50 values of the studied compounds cover an interval of more than 3 log units. the whole data set of 66 compounds was divided into two groups in approximate ratio of 4:1. a training set with 50 compounds, a test set with 16 compounds (Table 1). steric fields were calculated using a Lennard-Jones potential. electrostatic fields were calculated using a Coulombic potential. a 3D cubic lattice with grid spacing of 2.0 in X, Y and Z directions was created. a PLS analysis was performed with no validation and column filtering 2.0 to generate the final model with the training set. the predictive capability of the 3D QSAR models was determined from the predictive correlation (r2pred) coMFA and CoMSIA contour maps show that a proper bulky group near C-6 is favorable for activity while a bulky group near C-3, C-15 and C-16 is unfavorable. pharmacophore models were derived from eight highly active and structurally diverse compounds using GALAHAD."}
