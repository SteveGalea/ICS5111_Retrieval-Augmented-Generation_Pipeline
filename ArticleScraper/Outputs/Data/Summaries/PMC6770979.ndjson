{"summary": "a strictly cell-associated disease induced by the highly oncogenic -herpesvirus II disease virus [1] has a complex life with four main phases [2,3]: an early cytolytic phase at 2\u20137 days post infection. a latent phase around 7\u201310 dpi, a late cytolytic phase with the presence of tumors that is triggered between 14 and 21 dpi, and a final proliferation phase after 28 dpi. ASE refers to unequal expression of multiple alleles of a gene. the extreme case of ASE is monoallelic expression. the genes with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exhibiting ASE will provide a strong foundation for investigating the genetic mechanisms of complex traits. chickens, samples, and experimental design two reciprocal crosses were obtained. the chickens were divided into two groups, with two birds infected with MDV and two controls. RNA concentration was assessed using a nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. only samples with RIN scores over 7 could be submitted for sequencing. mRNA was used to synthesize the first- and second-strand cDNA. the sequencing data were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of national center for biotechnology information (NCBI), and are accessible through the accession number PRJNA488865. the fastQ files of mapping reads of each sample were individually aligned with the reference genome using Bowtie 2. four comparison groups were divided into 63 72 infected (I) vs 63 72 non-infected (N), 72 63 I vs 72 63 N, 63 72 I vs 72 63 I, and 63 72 N vs 72 63 N. each SNP was classified based on its position in the reference chicken genome as exonic, intronic, intergenic, 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR), 3\u2019 UTR, splicing site, qRT-PCR was performed in triplicate based on iCycler iQ PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) the expression of genes were normalized against GAPDH or -actin cDNA in the corresponding samples. the ASE significant genes (FDR 0.05) list was firstly submitted to DAVID. the analysis classification stringency was set to the highest level with suitable controls. the resulting clustering was limited to an enrichment score of >1.0. chickens, samples, and experimental design Two reciprocal crosses were obtained. for each reciprocal cross, the chickens were divided into two groups. virulent plus (vv+) strain of MDV-648A passage 50 was injected intra-abdominally at day 5. RNA concentration was assessed using a nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. only samples with RIN scores over 7 could be submitted for sequencing. mRNA was used to synthesize the first- and second-strand cDNA. after purification, the double-strand cDNA was fragmented into 300 base pairs (bp) fastQC [18] and Trimmomatic [20] with default parameters. resulting FastQ files of mapping reads of each sample were individually aligned with the reference genome using Bowtie 2 (version 2.2.7) [21,22] with mainly default parameters. four comparison groups were divided into 63 72 infected (I) vs 63 72 non-infected (N), 72 63 I vs 72 63 N, 63 72 I vs 72 63 I, and 63 72 N vs 72 63 N. each SNP was classified based on its position in the reference chicken genome as exonic, intronic, intergenic, 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR), 3\u2019 UTR, splicing site, 11 overlapped genes between ASE and DE analysis were selected for gene functional validation in both CD4+ T cells and tumors. the protocols followed for mRNA extraction and dsDNA synthesis were the same as those mentioned above. the analysis classification stringency was set to the highest level with suitable controls. the resulting clustering was limited to an enrichment score of >1.0. the resulting clustering was then limited to an enrichment score of >1.0. sample no. of Total Reads One Time Aligned Reads Multiple Times Aligned Reads Total Reads Alignment 63 72 I_1 19,223,914 14,084,204 1,063,547 15,147,751 78.80% 63 72 I_2 18,840,597 13,938,069 1,061,498 14,999,567 79.61% 63 72 N_1 21,702,185 15,052,834 1,315,212 16,368,046 75.4 around 150,000\u2013260,000 SNPs were left after filtering. about one-third of heterozygous SNPs were left after filtering. all of the VCF files were then merged and divided into four comparison groups. 63 72 N 15,105 61 39 72 63 I vs 72 63 N 22,067 123 132 63 72 I vs 72 63 I 18,229 62 66 63 72 N vs 72 63 N 20,310 79 96 An R script was used for each SNP determined by a chi-square test. 61 and 123 SNPs exhibiting ASE in response to MDV infection were identified in intercrosses 63 72 and 72 62 and 79 SNPs exhibiting ASE were identified in infected and non-infected birds. the significant SNPs were located in 66 genes and 79 SNPs in 96 genes in infected and non-infected groups. 96 ASE genes were identified before and after infection. 66 were identified after infection, with 11 overlapped genes in total. the common genes were both identified before and after infection. the expression of 382 (71.5%) DEGs was higher and 152 (28.5%) were lower after infection. for intercross 72 63, 854 (55.3%) and 689 (44.7%) DEGs were up- and down-regulated after infection. 5 up-regulated and 15 down-regulated genes were identified in non-infected groups.

GO terms and pathways analysis invoked in DAVID yielded 45 (5 terms of cellular component, 15 terms of molecular function, and 25 terms of biological processes) functional terms and 11 pathways (P 0.05, Table 8), including the immune-related pathway, T cell activation.

GO terms and pathways analysis invoked in DAVID yielded 45 (5 terms of cellular component, 15 terms of molecular function, and 25 terms of biological processes) functional terms (P 0.05, Table S8) and 11 pathways (P 0.05, Table 8), including the immune-related pathway, T cell activation. the preeminent canonical pathways are comprised of T cell receptor (TCR), PI3K/AKT, B cell receptor (BCR), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. the top diseases and disorder clusters, including inflammatory response, immunological disease, hematological disease, and organismal injury and abnormalities, were considered relevant to MDV infection. ASE is a powerful technique used to measure the expression of each allele. a gene with allelic inequality or imbalance is the key genetic factor causing MDV susceptibility. a gene with allelic inequality is the key genetic factor causing MDV susceptibility. the largest number of SNPs was classified as intronic (n = 26, 34.7%) and located downstream of a gene (n =23, 20.5%) in infected and non-infected groups. more overlapped ASE genes were identified in intercrosses 63 72 and 72 63 in response to MDV infection. in this study, we found an ASE SNP in this MCL1 gene. expression of this gene is significantly higher in infected birds and tumors. this gene was identified both as a virus-related gene and a host-related gene, so it could be a critical gene connecting MDV to the host. the PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathway is one of the three major signaling pathways critical in tumor progression. this classic route consists of two signaling pathways, PI3K/AKT and mTOR, which are important in regulating the cell cycle and directly related to cellular proliferation, tumors, and cancer. the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway is a chain of proteins in the cell that communicates a signal from a receptor on the surface of the cell to the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. this pathway is one of the most extensively studied pathways involved in tumorigenesis [55]. our approach underlines the importance of comprehensive functional studies. findings provide additional insights into the mechanisms of MD and disease resistance breeding in poultry."}
