{"summary": "phospholipase A2 reaction hydrolyzes sn-2 position of phospholipids to yield fatty acids and lysophospholipids. arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4) is metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases (LOXs) to lipid mediators including prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) LPA is produced by fatty acid deacylation of phosphatidic acid (PA) by PLA2 (or PLA1) or by removal of the polar head group of lysophospholipase D termed autotaxin (ATX) in most in vivo situations, the ATX-dependent route is dominant for the production of LPA. LysoPAF is deacetylated to alkyl-PC by LPCAT3. anti-inflammatory PUFA metabolites derived from 6 AA (lipoxin A4; LXA4), 3 EPA (resolvin E1; RvE1), and 3 DHA (RvD1 and protectin D1; PD1) are shadowed. in vitro enzymatic activity of individual PLA2s may be influenced by the assay conditions employed, such as composition of the substrate phospholipids, concentrations of PLA2s and substrates, presence of detergents, and pH. the results obtained using a commercially available PLA2 assay kit should be interpreted carefully, since some PLA2s are unable to hydrolyze it efficiently. the classification, distributions, properties and functions of individual PLA2s in the context of lipoquality are summarized in Table 1. iPLA2 9 PNPLA1 Epidermal keratinocytes -O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o lceramide transacylase Production of -O-acylceramide for skin barrier formation Lethal ichthyosis 68 PNPLA2 iPLA2/ATGL Ubiquitous (Abundant in liver and adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) TG lipase Hydrolysis of TG in lipid droplets for fatty acid -oxidation TG accumulation in multiple tissues. metabolites or PUFA-containing lysophospholipids Skeletal muscular weakness, heart failure, and impaired adaptive thermogenesis due to mitochondorial dysfunction, reduced -oxidation, Resistant to diet- induced metabolic syndrome, Neurodegeneration, Susceptibility to parasitic infection, Platelet dysfunction 46, 149\u2013153 PNPLA9 iPLA2/PLA2G6 Ubiquitous PLA2 Membrane remodeling Production of AA metabolites or PAF Male lase Hydrolysis of intracellular PAF Enlargement of ganglionic eminences in pafah1b2/Pafah1b3/ mice 161 LPLA2 1 PLA2G15 Lysosomal PLA2 Ubiquitous PLA1 or PLA2 Lysosomal degradation of phospholipids Abberant accumulation of non-degraded surfactant phospholipids in lysosomes of alveolar macrophages (phospholipid ABHD6 Ubiquitous Lysophospholipase or monoacylglycerol lipase Hydrolysis of 2-AG for microglia migration, Enhanced adipose browning, Attenuated diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome 92, 93, 165 ABHD12 Ubiquitous LysoPS lipase Hydrolysis of LysoPS Massive accumulation of LysoPS in brain leading to age-dependent increases in microgli 116, 117 PLA2G2E sPLA2-IIE Hypertrophic adipocytes, Hair follicles PLA2 Hydrolysis of PE and PS in lipoproteins Uncertain Protection from diet-induced obesity and hyperlipidemia. the cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) family comprises 6 isoforms (\u2013), among which cPLA2 maps to the same locus. cPLA2 (also known as group IVA PLA2) is undoubtedly the best known PLA2 and its biological roles in association with lipoquality have been well documented. cPLA2 translocates from the cytosol to the phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich perinuclear, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes (particularly Golgi) Upon cell activation, cPLA2 translocates from the cytosol to the phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich perinuclear, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and gol PLA2-deficient mice are protected against bronchial asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, cerebral infarction, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, metabolic diseases, intestinal cancer and so on. phenotypes are recapitulated in mice lacking one or more of the biosynthetic enzymes or receptors for PGs and LTs, lending strong support to the notion that cPLA2 lies upstream of eicosanoid biosynthesis cPLA2 (group IVB PLA2) has a unique JimC domain in the N-terminal region. cPLA2 (group IVD PLA2) exhibits a unique transacylase activity that transfers sn-1 fatty acid of PC to an amino residue of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form N-acyl-PE. enzymes bearing a large and unique N-terminal region (PNPLA69) act mainly on phospholipids (phospholipase type), while those lacking the N-terminal domain (PNPLA15) act on neutral lipids (lipase type) PNPLA8/iPLA2 has lysophospholipase activity that cleaves lysophosphatidylcholine to yield fatty acid and glycerophosphocholine. genetic mutations or deletions of these phospholipid-targeting PNPLAs cause various forms of metabolic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. the activity of PNPLA2 is regulated positively by ABHD5 and negatively by perilipin and G0S2. the fatty acids released from lipid droplets by PNPLA2 act as endogenous ligands for the nuclear receptor PPAR or PPAR. linoleic acid (LA; C18:2) in triglyceride to -hydroxy residue of ultra-long-chain fatty acid in ceramide to form -O-acylceramide. genetic deletion or mutation of PNPLA1 hampers epidermal -O-acylceramide formation, thereby severely impairing skin barrier function and causing ichthyosis in both human and mouse. type-I PAFAH is a heterotrimer composed of two catalytic subunits, group XIIIA and XIIIB PLA2s, and a regulatory subunit LIS-1. Deficiency of type-I PAFAH leads to male infertility through an unknown mechanism. LPLA2 is homologous with lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and catalytically active under mildly acidic conditions. gene deletion of LPLA2 results in unusual accumulation of non-degraded lung surfactant phospholipids in lysosomes. ABHD3 selectively hydrolyzes phospholipids with medium-chain fatty acids. ABHD4 releases fatty acids from multiple classes of N-acyl-phospholipids to produce N-acyl-lysophospholipids. ABHD6 acts as lysophospholipase or monoacylglycerol lipase. cPLA2 family comprises 6 isoforms (\u2013), among which cPLA2, and map to the same chromosomal locus. cPLA2 is the only PLA2 that shows a striking substrate specificity for AA-containing phospholipids. cPLA2 can hydrolyze phospholipids containing EPA. phosphoinositide PIP2 and ceramide-1-phosphate modulate the subcellular localization and activation of cPLA2.12,13. the AA released by cPLA2 is converted by the sequential action of constitutive COX-1 or inducible COX-2 and terminal PG synthases to PGs or by the sequential action of 5-LOX and terminal LT synthases to LTs. the cPLA2 family is conserved in cPL cPLA2-deficient mice are protected from asthma,25\u201327. inherited human cPLA2 mutations are associated with reduced eicosanoid biosynthesis, platelet dysfunction, and intestinal ulceration. cPLA2 (group IVB PLA2) displays PLA1, PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities. cPLA2 (group IVD PLA2) exhibits a unique transacylase activity that transfers sn-1 fatty acid of PC to an amino residue of phosphatidylethanolamine to form N-acyl-PE. cPLA2 (group IVE PLA2) displays both PLA1 and PLA2 activities without fatty acid selectivity. enzymes bearing a large and unique N-terminal region (PNPLA69) act mainly on phospholipids (phospholipase type), while those lacking the N-terminal domain (PNPLA15) act on neutral lipids (lipase type) the patatin domain, which is characteristic of this family, is conserved in all of these enzymes. lysophospholipase activity cleaves lysophosphatidylcholine to yield fatty acid and glycerophosphocholine. genetic mutations or deletions of these phospholipid-targeting PNPLAs cause various forms of metabolic dysfunction. lack of PNPLA9/iPLA2 leads to male infertility through an unknown mechanism. the catalytic activity of PNPLA3 is controversial. it may serve as a triglyceride lipase, since its loss-of function mutation increases cellular triglyceride levels. recent evidence suggests that PNPLA3 acts as a retinyl-palmitate lipase in hepatic stellate cells to fine-tune plasma levels of retinoids. PNPLA1 catalyzes transacylation of LA from triglyceride to -OH ceramide. acylceramide is an essential component of lipid lamellae and the cornified lipid envelope in the uppermost epidermis. Deficiency of type-I PAFAH leads to male infertility through unknown mechanism. plasma-type PAFAH (group VIIA PLA2) preferentially hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids (i.e., phospholipids having an oxygenated fatty acid at the sn-2 position) in cellular membranes. the PLA-acyltransferase (PLAAT) family is structurally similar to lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) the ABHD family is a newly recognized group of lipolytic enzymes, comprising at least 19 enzymes in humans. ABHD6 acts as lysophospholipase or monoacylglycerol lipase. 2-AG is an endocannabinoid lipid mediator that plays a role in the retrograde neurotransmission. in the brain, the AA released from 2-AG by monoacylglycerol lipase, rather than that released from phospholipids by cPLA2 is linked to the production of a pool of PGE2 that promotes sPLA2 family contains 10 catalytically active isoforms and one inactive isoform in mammals. sPLA2 family hydrolyzes sn-2 position of phospholipids, a feature that differs from intracellular PLA2s that often display PLA1, lysophospholipase, lipase, or transacylase/acyltransferase activity. sPLA2-IB and -IIA are two prototypic sPLA2s that were initially identified through classical protein purification from the pancreas and sites of inflammation. sPLA2-V tends to prefer those with a lower degree of unsaturation such as oleic acid (OA; C18:1), and sPLA2-IID, -IIF, -III and -X tend to prefer PUFAs including AA and D sPLA2-IIA is synthesized as an inactive zymogen in the pancreas. its N-terminal propeptide is cleaved by trypsin to yield an active enzyme in the duodenum. the main role of sPLA2-IB is to digest dietary and biliary phospholipids. sPLA2-IIA, -IIC, -IID, -IIE and -IIF are often classified into the group II subfamily (sPLA2-IIC is a pseudogene in human) sPLA2-IID is constitutively expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid organs. sPLA2-IID-null mice exhibit more severe contact hypersensitivity and psoriasis. 2-IIE is expressed in hair follicles in association with the growth phase of the hair cycle118. sPLA2-IIE-deficient mice display subtle abnormalities in hair follicles118. sPLA2-IIF has a long C-terminal extension containing a free cysteine. sPLA2-IIF preferentially hydrolyzes P-PE bearing DHA to liberate P-LPE and DHA under physiological conditions. sPLA2-V is markedly induced in adipocytes during obesity as a \u201cmetabolic sPLA2\u201d and hydrolyzes PC in hyperlipidemic LDL to release OA and to a lesser extent LA. sPLA2-V is markedly induced in adipocytes during obesity as sPLA2-V-null macrophages have a reduced ability to phagocytose extracellular materials. sPLA2-V-null mice suffer from more severe lung inflammation caused by bacterial or viral infection. sPLA2-V has a propensity to preferentially hydrolyze phospholipids having sn-2 fatty acids with a lower degree of unsaturation. sPLA2-X has the highest affinity for PC. sPLA2-X is activated by cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide by furin-type convertases. sPLA2-X-transgenic mice exhibit global anti-inflammatory phenotypes in association with elevation of systemic 3 PUFA levels. sPLA2-III is expressed in the epididymal epithelium and acts on immature sperm cells passing through the epididymal duct in a paracrine manner. sPLA2-III is also secreted from mast cells and acts on microenvironmental fibroblasts to produce PGD2. sPLA2-XIIA is evolutionally far distant from other sPLA2s. PLA2R1 is homologous to sPLA2-inhibitory proteins present in snake plasma and exists as an integral membrane protein or as a soluble protein resulting from shedding or alternative splicing. in support of its signaling role, PLA2R1 promotes the migration and growth of myofibroblasts and thereby protects against cardiac rupture. the sPLA2 family hydrolyzes the sn-2 position of phospholipids. individual sPLA2s exhibit unique tissue and cellular distributions. sPLA2s are secreted and require Ca2+ in the mM range for catalytic action. sPLA2-IB, -IIA and -IIE do not discriminate fatty acid species. sPLA2-V tends to prefer those with a lower degree of unsaturation. sPLA2-X is very active on PC, while sPLA2-IIA has much higher affinity for PE than for PC. sPLA2-IIA is to digest dietary and biliary phospholipids in the intestinal lumen. resistance to diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis. sPLA2-IIA is often referred to as inflammatory sPLA2. sPLA2-IIA, -IIC, -IID, -IIE and -IIF are often classified into the group II subfamily. sPLA2-IID is constitutively expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) in lymphoid organs. sPLA2-IID-null mice exhibit more severe contact hypersensitivity and psoriasis. sPLA2-IIF hydrolyzes PUFA-containing plasmalogen-type PE in keratinocyte-secreted phospholipids to produce plasmalogen-type lysophosphatidylethanolamine (P-LPE; lysoplasmalogen), which promotes epidermal hyperplasia. sPLA2-IIF-transgenic mice spontaneously develop psoriasis-like skin. sPLA2-IIF preferentially hydrolyzes P-PE bearing DHA to liberate P-LPE and DHA under physiological conditions. sPLA2-V is markedly induced in adipocytes during obesity as a \u201cmetabolic sPLA2\u201d and hydrolyzes PC in hyperlipidemic LDL to release OA and to a lesser extent LA. transgenic overexpression of sPLA2-V, but not other sPLA2s sPLA2-V-deficient mice are more susceptible to fungal infection and arthritis due to defective clearance of hazardous fungi and immune complexes. sPLA2-V-null mice suffer from more severe lung inflammation. control (+/+) mice were subjected to mass spectrometric lipidomics analysis (values are mean SEM, *P 0.05 and **P 0.01) sPLA2-X is expressed abundantly in colorectal epithelial and goblet cells. sPLA2-X has the highest affinity for PC leading to release of fatty acids. sPLA2-X-transgenic mice exhibit global anti-inflammatory phenotypes. sPLA2-X secreted from acrosomes of activated spermatozoa hydrolyzes sperm membrane phospholipids to release DHA and docosapentaenioc acid. sPLA2-X-null mice are protected from asthma, accompanied by decreased levels of pulmonary 6 AA-derived eicosanoids. sPLA2-XIIA is a catalytically inactive protein due to substitution of the catalytic center histidine by leucine. sPLA2-XIIB deficiency impairs hepatic lipoprotein secretion.
