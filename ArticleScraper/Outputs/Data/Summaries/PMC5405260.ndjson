{"summary": "the PEDV genome (28 kb) consists of seven open reading frames (ORFs) (2). the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome contains the replicase-transcriptase ORF1 (overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b), followed by five ORFs encoding four structural proteins and one strain-specific accessory protein. PEDV was first reported in the early 1970s as the causative agent of PED. porcine enteric coronaviruses infect villous enterocytes, causing atrophic enteritis that leads to malabsorptive diarrhea (7, 8, 18) enteric coronaviruses primarily infect villous enterocytes, causing atrophic enteritis. fluorescent microbead-based immunoassay (FMIA) and whole-virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the final aim of this project was to identify highly sensitive and specific PEDV antigen targets for the antibody-based differential diagnosis of coronavirus-related enteric disease. PEDV and TGEV Purdue (DPI 7 to 10 and DPI 28 to 42), and PEDV and PRCV (DPI 7 to 10 and DPI 42) no differences in the FMIA sample/positive result (S/P) ratios with respect to the IgG antibody response to S1 from the S-INDEL strain were observed over time in any inoculation group. sample/positive result (S/P) ratios of serum antibody (IgG) responses (mean, SE) over time in each inoculation group. different letters denote statistical differences (P = 0.05) 58/72 (80.6); 69.9\u201388.0 E 0.90 1/72 (1.4); 0.25\u20137.5 WV particles 0.67 48/72 (66.7); 55.2\u201376.5 ELISA WV particles 0.70 63/72 (87.5); 77.9\u201393.3 a The optimal S/P cutoff points were selected to ensure 100% diagnostic specificity. 12 11 11 N 0 0 0 2 6 10 10 10 10 10 9 9 E 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 WV particles Single ELISA 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6-plex FMIA 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 S1 (S-INDEL) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 cross-reactivity of individual antigens to antiserum obtained over time from pigs inoculated with PEDV-related porcine coronaviruses. rM protein was highly reactive to pigs experimentally inoculated with TGEV Miller (12/12), TGEV Purdue (9/12), and PRCV (7/12) between DPI 7 and DPI 42. pigs were inoculated with PDCoV during experimental inoculation. pigs were inoculated with PEDV, TGEV Miller, TGEV Purdue, PRCV, and PDCoV. the recombinant polypeptides were recombinantly generated (s1 non-S-INDEL and S-INDEL, N, M, and E) DV recombinant polypeptide S1 PEDV non-S-INDEL (consensus) S1 PEDV S-INDEL (consensus) N PEDV (consensus) M PEDV (consensus) E PEDV (CV777 strain) antibodies to the rS1's (FMIA), rN (FMIA) and WV (ELISA) in the PEDV-inoculated group were significantly higher (P 0.05) at DPI 10 than to those the TGEV, PRCV, and PDCoV inoculation groups. no significant differences in rM responses were found in pairwise comparisons. samples above the estimated S/P cutoff (dashed line) were considered positive. different letters denoted statistical differences (P = 0.05) samples above the estimated S/P cutoff (dashed line) were considered positive. the optimal S/P cutoff points were selected to ensure 100% diagnostic specificity. the time of detection and the over[time detection of PEDV antibodies to different PEDV antigens are presented in Table 2. seropositivity using the WV antigen was higher when it was used on the ELISA platform than when it was used on the FMIA platform. seropositivity using the WV antigen was higher when it was used on the ELISA platform.

INDEL, N, M, and E have homologous regions corresponding to porcine coronaviruses PEDV, TGEV Miller, TGEV Purdue, PRCV, and PDCoV used during experimental inoculationa Strain used for exptl inoculation % homology for amino acid sequence of PEDV recombinant polypeptides S1, N, M, and E. five recombinant polypeptides derived from the four PEDV structural proteins (S, M, N, and E) and a WV antigen were generated. proteins S and M were truncated on the basis of gene size, hydrophobicity, and antigenic features. the most abundant protein in the virion envelope (35), the N protein is the most abundant coronavirus antigen produced throughout infection (36), and the S protein forms the crown-like projection of the viral surface (37). the lower response in the FMIA assay can be attributed to the fact that the Luminex carboxylated magnetic microbeads bind WV (intact) PEDV particles less efficiently than they bind proteins or polypeptides with free amino groups. pigs exposed to different coronaviruses that share genetic and antigenic traits that may contribute to false-positive results. recent evidence suggesting antibody cross-reactivity between PEDV and TGEV (13) and between PEDV and PDCoV (40) raised concerns about the specificity of PEDV serologic testing using assays based on targets containing the most conserved regions. further analysis identified at least one epitope on the N-terminal region of the PEDV/TGEV N protein that contributed to this cross-reactivity (13). cross-reactivity could be corrected by increasing the S/P ratio cutoff value from 0.59 to 0.80, but this would reduce the diagnostic sensitivity from 83.3% to 76.3%. pigs' serum samples were tested with a PEDV immunofluorescence assay (21), PEDV WV ELISA (24), TGEV/PRCV differential ELISA (Svanova, Sweden), and PDCoV IFA (14). the pigs' serum samples were tested with a PEDV immunofluorescence assay (s gene)/PRCV (N gene)-based differential rRT-PCR (14), while pig fecal and nasal sw PEDV recombinant and WV target antigens were used to develop a multiplex (6-plex) FMIA platform to analyze the antibody response to each target using sera from pigs experimentally inoculated with PEDV, TGEV Miller and Purdue strains. the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and the analytical specificity were evaluated for each individual antigen. plasmids were cloned into pNPM5 eukaryotic expression vector. transfected HEK293 cells were grown in serum-free freestyle 293 expression medium. soluble expression of S1-Fc proteins was confirmed by 12% dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. rS1 non-S-INDEL (717-amino-acid [aa]) and rS1 S-INDEL (714-aa) proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. the gene was amplified using forward primer 5\u2032-CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT ATG GCA TCT GTT AGC TTT CAG GAT CG-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-AGA CTG CAG GTC GAC AAG CTT TTA ATT GCC GGT ATC GAA GAT C-3\u2032. the amplicon was cloned into pCold II expression plasmid (Novoprotein Scientific Inc., Shanghai, China) the rN protein (452 aa) was purified by SFF affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer's instructions.
