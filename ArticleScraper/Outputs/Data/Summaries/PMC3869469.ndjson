{"summary": "a deep nasal flocked swab was collected by research staff and compared with an anterior foam NS obtained after instillation of saline spray. at home, up to 2 self-collections of paired foam NS (with and without saline) were collected. children ages 6\u201318 years with a diagnosis of CF were eligible to enroll if they met the following criteria: (1) attended at least 2 CF clinic visits during the previous 12 months; (2) currently experiencing a new respiratory illness or willing to return for a clinic visit or collect home samples. children were excluded if they had received antiviral medications during the 30 days before enrollment or if they were awaiting or had previously received a lung transplant. 5 sprays of saline from a polyethylene metered bottle (0.1 mL/spray) were instilled into the anterior naris, followed by NS insertion into the anterior naris as far as possible. swab was collected by the research nurse as an opportunity to demonstrate the proper technique for collection to the patient and parent. home-collected NS were mailed to the University of Washington Molecular Virology Laboratory using US Postal Service Pre-paid Priority Mailers with appropriate packaging and labeling for Category B Infectious Substances. participants received phone or e-mail reminders every 1\u20132 weeks to collect samples at home at onset of new respiratory illness. linear regression analyses were used to compare differences in time from collection to laboratory processing, symptom duration, and number of symptoms between swabs collected at home versus in clinic. swabs were positive for other virus types to perform statistical analyses. a polyurethane foam NS was collected in the opposite naris after instillation of saline nasal spray. the swab was collected in the opposite naris, followed by NS insertion into the anterior naris, and rotation of the swab while exhaling through the nose for 5\u20137 seconds. dry swabs were collected by inserting a foam swab into the anterior naris. participants were asked to collect the dry swab before the saline swab. for home collections, participants were asked to collect the dry swab. a panel of 8 single or multiplexed real time reverse-transcription (RT)\u2013PCR (for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses) and PCR (for adenovirus and bocavirus) were used to compare differences in time from collection to laboratory processing, symptom duration, and number of symptoms between swabs collected at home versus in study samples thus included 61 swab sets collected during new respiratory illnesses. the mean age of participants who performed self-collection was older than that of participants who had samples collected by someone else (15.7 vs 10.3 years, respectively) 122 swabs tested, 81 (66.4%) had 1 or more viruses detected. 41 (33.6%) were negative for all viruses tested. most prevalent finding was rhinovirus, which was detected in 59 swabs. onavirus 3 (7.0) 2 (4.7) 5 (4.1) Respiratory syncytial virus 2 (4.7) 2 (4.7) 4 (3.3) Parainfluenza type 3 1 (5.6) 1 (5.6) 2 (1.6) Influenza A (2009 H1N1) 1 (5.6) 1 (2.3) 2 (1.6) Influenza A (2009 H1N1) 1 (5.6) 1 (2.3) 2 (1.6) Influenza A (2009 H1N1) 1 (5.6) 1 (2.3 value (95% CI) was 31.0 (27.1, 35.0) and 30.9 (25.2, 36.7) for 6 clinic-collected deep NS and 4 saline NS, respectively, and 28.0 (25.5, 30.5) and 26.3 (25.4, 28.1) for 25 home-collected dry and 24 home-collected saline NS, respectively. symptoms reported at the time of collection for swabs collected at home. n (%) Home Collection #1 (25 surveys) n (%) Home Collection #2 (18 surveys) n (%) Fever 1 (5.6) 5 (20.0) 5 (27.8) Chills/rigors \u2013 3 (12.0) 3 (16.7) Decreased appetite 1 (5.6) 4 (16.0) 4 (22.2) Muscle aches 3 (16.7) 2 (8.0) 3 (16.7) Headache 1 (5.6 participants regarded collection of anterior nasal foam swabs as comfortable (71% agree or strongly agree responses, 11% neither agree nor disagree, and 18% disagree responses). subjects thought self-collection was simple (96% agree or strongly agree responses) majority of participants indicated willingness to participate in future studies using the procedure. 27 (63%) swab sets were collected by the parent, 14 (33%) by the participant, and 2 by another adult individual. the mean age of participants who performed self-collection was older than that of participants who had samples collected by someone else (15.7 vs 10.3 years, respectively) the most prevalent finding was rhinovirus, which was detected in 59 swabs (48.4%) for swabs collected in clinic, overall percent agreement was observed for 13 of 18 pairs (72.2%). for NS collected at home, overall percent agreement was observed for 39 of 43 pairs (90.7%) influenza A (2009 H1N1) 1 (5.6) 1 (2.3) 2 (1.6) Influenza A (2009 H1N1) and adenovirus 1 (2.3) 1 (0.8) aAmong swab pairs collected at home, the following paired results were observed. 31 pairs with the same virus detected by dry foam swab and saline foam swab, 8 pairs with both swabs negative, 2 pairs with dry foam swab positive the difference in mean PCR CT values was \u20133.8 comparing home versus clinic collections (95% CI \u20136.8, \u20130.9; P =.014) the difference in mean CT values for 24 home versus 4 clinic collections was 4.6, 95% CI (8.1, 1.1; P =.013) there was no association between longer time from collection to laboratory processing and likelihood of negative results by viral PCR. 5 (27.8) Chills/rigors \u2013 3 (12.0) 3 (16.7) Decreased appetite 1 (5.6) 4 (16.0) 4 (22.2) Muscle aches 3 (16.7) 2 (8.0) 3 (16.7) Headache 1 (5.6) 7 (28.0) 10 (55.6) Increased nasal congestion 17 (94.4) 24 (96.0) 17 (94.4) Increased cough 13 (72.2) 13 (52.0) 9 (50.0) Increased fatigue 2 (11.1) 7 (28.0) 7 (38 the majority of participants indicated willingness to participate in future studies using the self-collection procedure. participants indicated that the procedure for collection of anterior nasal foam swabs was preferred over collection of the deep nasal flocked swab (94% agree or strongly agree responses) the self-collection method was feasible using foam swabs collected with saline or dry swabs with comparable rates of viral detection. a recent manuscript showed that self-collected foam NS had increased sensitivity over dry swabs for detection of respiratory viruses. it is likely that children shed high quantities of respiratory virus. samples in the setting of new respiratory illness suggest that this method is useful to detect incident viral infections. the majority of the virus detections were rhinovirus, and because the more than 100 serotypes do not amplify with the same efficiency using our RT-PCR assay, quantitative RT-PCR testing was not performed."}
