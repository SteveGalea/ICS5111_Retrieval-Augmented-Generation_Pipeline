{"summary": "a strategy for developing improved vaccines is to enhance their ability to activate the innate immune system. there are currently multiple viruses being developed as live-virus vaccine vectors for the delivery of heterologous antigens that are effective activators of the innate immune system. flagellin has been shown to elicit a higher level of cytokine production in human monocyte-derived DCs. previous studies have shown the ability of VSV that expresses flagellin to elicit a higher level of cytokine production in humans. the NLRC4 inflammasome is formed with pro-caspase-1 and adapter proteins. formation of the inflammasome leads to processing and secretion of interleukin-1 and IL-18. pyroptosis is an inflammatory cell death that can promote enhanced immune responses. stimulant factor (GM-CSF) generated from a baculovirus vector was provided by S. Mizel, Wake Forest School of Medicine. fluorescently labeled antibodies against mouse cell surface antigens were purchased from BioLegend. monoclonal anti-VSV N protein antibody 10G4 was produced as described previously. cells were lysed and washed, and progenitor cells were plated at a density of 5 105 cells/ml in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 10 ng/ml of GM-CSF and 10 g/ml of gentamicin. cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 6 days and fed with fresh medium and GM-CSF on days 2, 4 and 5. data were acquired using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). immunoblotting. DCs were infected at an MOI of 10, supernatants were collected at 8 h postinfection. cells were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer without SDS. at 24 h postinfection, cells were harvested, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-VSV-N antibody followed by a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. data were then acquired by flow cytometry as described above. NLRC4/ mice were acquired from M. Schnell (Thomas Jefferson University) all mice were maintained and bred in the animal facility at Wake Forest School of Medicine. experiments were conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 105 cells/ml were infected with virus at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) indicated in the figures or legends for 6, 12, or 24 h. supernatants were collected and stored at 80\u00b0C. cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DCs were infected at an MOI of 10 and at the time points indicated in the figures or legends were analyzed for cell viability using a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. data were acquired using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software. flagellin gene was inserted into the M51R backbone as a separate transcriptional unit between the M and G genes. these vectors induce potent innate and adaptive immune responses in the absence of viral pathogenicity in mice. flagellin expression was tested in myeloid DCs cultured from bone marrow precursors in presence of GM-CSF. the gene for flagellin was inserted into the M51R backbone as a separate transcriptional unit between the M and G genes. at 8 h postinfection, cell lysates (20 g of protein) and media (70 g of protein) were analyzed for flagellin expression by immunoblotting. IL-6 and IL-12 production licit low levels of cytokine production compared to those seen with other TLR agonists. DCs were treated at various MOIs for 24 h. supernatants were collected, and cytokines were measured by ELISA. NLRC4 is the major PRR for flagellin induction of IL-1 production in these DCs, whereas antiviral signaling through IPS-1 does not play a role. these results indicate that NLRC4 is the major PRR for flagellin induction of IL-1 production in these DCs. stimulation of proIL-1 production followed by caspase-1-mediated cleavage to generate the mature form of the cytokine. the latter process results from inflammasome activation. only uncleaved proIL-1 was detected in cell lysates. arrow of WT, NLRC4/, or IPS-1/ mice treated for 8 h with M51R or M51R-F vector (MOI = 10). Integrated pixel densities were measured using ImageQuant software. results are expressed as the maximum response (WT DCs treated with M51R-F vector) expression of CD80 and MHC-II molecules by IPS-1/ DCs increased costimulatory molecule expression. at 24 h, the cells were harvested, stained for cell surface markers, and analyzed by flow cytometry. cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for 7AAD fluorescence and forward light scattering (FSC-H) in the WT cells, approximately 20% of both mock-treated and M51R vector-treated DCs were 7AAD positive. in contrast, approximately 50% of DCs treated with M51R-F vector-treated DCs were 7AAD positive. this indicates that DCs treated with flagellin-expressing virus elicited a rapid permeabilization of the plasma membrane that results of multiple experiments expressed as percentage of CD11c positive that were also 7AAD positive. the observation that the M51R-F vector induces rapid membrane permeabilization raises the question of how many cells remain viable after treatment with these viruses. bacterial flagellin as a vaccine adjuvant is well established as a purified protein and when expressed in viral vaccine vectors. the activity of bacterial flagellin as a vaccine adjuvant is well established both as a purified protein and when expressed in viral vaccine vectors (reviewed in references 25 and 26) s to IL-1 production and pyroptosis is the NLRC4 inflammasome. production of IL-6, IL-12, and costimulatory molecules was primarily through antiviral signaling. deletion of TLR5, the other major PRR for flagellin, had only minor effects in this study. apoptosis is effectively induced by M51R viruses through activation of both the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways. induction of apoptosis leads to rapid release of intracellular contents in vivo and in cell culture. pyroptosis has been described most often for myeloid cells infected with a variety of pathogens. it is likely that other nonmyeloid cells are also capable of undergoing pyroptosis in response to vectors that express flagellin. this raises the question of why some cells survive infection while others undergo cell death by pyroptosis. the cells that survive the induction of pyroptosis are likely to be those in which the balance of regulators favors survival. there is variation in the level of flagellin expression, so that cells with relatively less flagellin would be expected to survive. both VSV and flagellin are in clinical trials in humans as vaccine vectors and adjuvants for heterologous antigens (43) there is no vaccine vector that incorporates both VSV and flagellin in current clinical trials. there are other viruses that are also being developed as vectors expressing flagellin (SV5) that may also be subject to future clinical trials."}
