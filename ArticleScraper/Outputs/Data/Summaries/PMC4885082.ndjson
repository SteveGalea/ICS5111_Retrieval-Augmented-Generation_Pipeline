{"summary": "replicating-competent reporter-expressing viruses (RCREVs) are one type of artificially modified viruses that retain the viral genetic characteristics but also possess the new properties of the reporter genes. a recurring difficulty in generating RCREVs is the genetic instability, especially for a larger reporter gene. reporters with a smaller size may be a promising option due to their minimal effects on the viral biology. a nonessential viral gene can be replaced with a reporter gene to generate a reporter virus. a nonessential viral gene can be replaced with a reporter gene to generate a reporter virus. reporters can be expressed from an additional transcriptional unit (ATU) reporter gene is generally flanked by highly conserved gene start-and-stop signals. recombinant alphaviruses expressing a separate Fluc by 2A-mediated cleavage were successfully used to screen viral receptors. some viruses possess a large genome, but they usually permit a large extrinsic genetic insertion without impairing viral replication. for most RNA and some DNA viruses, the insertion of a large reporter gene into the genome is difficult or even impossible to achieve. reporters with a smaller size may be a promising option due to their minimal effects on the viral biology. the Rluc gene (933 bp) is better than the Fluc gene (1653 bp) and has a minimal influence on the growth of the engineered classical swine fever virus expressing the reporters. the same strategy might lead to different effects on the growth of the same virus due to the distinct insertion site. a recombinant respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) expressing a reporter protein from an ATU upstream of NS1 displayed negligible attenuation in cell cultures [19], whereas the RSV expressing a reporter from an ATU inserted between F and G genes was significantly attenuated. antiviral compounds, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have potential applications in the treatment of many diseases. traditional methods based on wild-type viruses are inefficient for antiviral screening. a recombinant EBOV carrying a luciferase reporter was used to screen antiviral siRNAs efficiently [16]. there are some problems associated with RCREVs in HTS applications. the interference of compound fluorescence may occur when screening antivirals using fluorescent reporter-expressing viruses. the use of replicons or pseudoparticles would help to identify the step(s) of the viral life cycle as the potential targets of antivirals. the receptors are regarded as promising targets for development of novel antivirals against infectious diseases. RCREVs provide an ideal tool for monitoring the dynamics of viral infection progression in vitro and in vivo. reporters Viruses Tracking and Live Imaging Green fluorescent protein (GFP) Influenza virus Dynamics of virus infection progression in mice [53] Herpes simplex virus (HSV) Compartmentalization of protein by autofluorescent particles [54] Borna disease virus (BDV) Routes of virus spread in vivo [56] Canine distemper virus (CDV) Route ECFP, EGFP, Venus, RFP, mCherry, NanoLuc and Gluc split-GFP, Cre recombinase Influenza A/B virus Viral infection in vitro or in lung tissues [58,71,72,73,74,75,76] iRFPs Adenovirus In mouse model [69] dTomato Canine distemper virus (CDV) Routes of virus spread in vivo [56]. the TC-labeling technology has led to successful tracking of the nonstructural or structural proteins of diverse viruses. the engineered replication-competent TC-tagged viruses are not suitable for tracking viral protein in vivo. recombinant canine distemper virus (dTomato) was used to investigate the routes of virus spread in vivo. reporters fused with viral proteins are very suitable for investigating the localization and distribution of the proteins in infected living cells. RCREVs will help advance virus-related live-imaging studies in vitro and in vivo. reporters Viruses Expression Strategies Screened Cellular Receptors Proteins Firefly luciferase (Fluc) Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) Fusion with a viral protein Laminin receptor (LamR) [50] Alphaviruses Introduction of foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A-enconding sequence Fuzzy homolog (FUZ) and tetraspanin membrane protein TSPAN9 [18] Green fluorescent protein ( dTomato canine distemper virus (CDV) Routes of virus spread in vivo [56] EGFP+Rluc/Gluc Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV) Tracking of viral replication in vitro and in vivo [77] RCREVs carrying a GFP reporter gene have been successfully used for tracking viral protein(s) or viral infection in vitro and in vivo [53,54,55,56] FPs in RCREVs can be expressed efficiently in rodent brain for a long time [57] and show lower autofluorescence in the tissue [56]. an engineered virus expressing the split-green fluorescent protein (split-GFP) in the presence of cell lines expressing the complementing GFP can facilitate the tracking of viral infection in living cells. viruses expressing ECFP, EGFP, Venus or mCherry were generated to facilitate the study of viral infection in in vivo models. in the future, \u201ccolor\u201d or dual-reporter viruses will be powerful tools to analyze viral infection at the cellular level in vivo. recombinant viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) harboring RFP gene was used to evaluate viral-vectored vaccines. a novel gE-deleted pseudorabies virus (PRV) was obtained by gE/gI-deleted virus expressing EGFP [85]. a practical challenge for some viruses lies in not allowing the insertion of reporter genes in the genome of influenza viruses. a potential consequence of RCREVs\u2019 attenuation is the purging of the inserted reporter from the viral genome. luciferase imaging uses the luciferases to catalyze reactions that produce visible light in vivo at body temperature. luciferases will still become major reporters for in vivo imaging in real time in the future. iRFPs are in high demand for in vivo imaging, which exhibit high brightness in mammalian cells and tissues. luciferase mutants can be chosen to design RCREVs for specific purposes. the two-reporter RCREVs may be widely used to address the scientific questions. the detection of reporter gene expression could be performed with inexpensive, small and simple-to-use equipment."}
