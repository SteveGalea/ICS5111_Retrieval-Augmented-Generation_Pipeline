{"summary": "antibody-based therapeutic modalities have shown clinical success in the treatment of many diseases [1,2,3,4] mers-CoV is a novel coronavirus first isolated in 2012 from a patient in Saudi Arabia. it causes SARS-like symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and can lead to respiratory or renal failure. 27 countries have reported 2442 cases of MERS-CoV infections. at least 842 related deaths since september 2012. effective therapeutics and vaccines are urgently needed. two of the peptides, P1 and HR2P, were reported to interact with heptad repeat 1 domain (HR1) of S protein S2 subunit, to form a 6-HB complex. the combination of m336 antibody and HR2P peptide showed potent synergism in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus infections. a single fresh colony was inoculated into 3 mL of 2YT medium containing 100 g/mL ampicillin and incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 250 rpm overnight. protein fragments were harvested from the bacterial cell pellet and the precipitate was re-suspended with 50 mL PBS. eluted with elution buffer (250 mM imidazole in PBS) the proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE and the purity was estimated as >90%. the protein concentration was further confirmed by size exclusion chromatography using an FPLC AKTA system. 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with a pcDNA3.1-MERS-CoV-S plasmid and a PNL4-3.luc.RE plasmid encoding an Env-defective luciferase-expressing HIV-1genome. after 48 h post-transfection, the produced pseudovirus was harvested from the supernatant, and filtered through 0.45 m sterilized membrane. m336 scFv, m336 scFv-pep, m336 diabody-pep, and CH3-pep were transfected with pAA-IRES-MERS-EGFP (293T/EGFP, effector cells) encoding the MERS-CoV proteins or pAA-IRES-EGFP (293T/EGFP) as a negative control. p was generated by replacing the (G4S)3 linker between VH and VL of m336 scFv-pep with a 5 amino acids GGGGS linker. the CH3-pep was also generated by fusing HR2P peptide with IgG1 CH3 domain. sequences were verified by direct DNA sequencing. the cultures were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. target proteins were eluted with elution buffer (250 mM imidazole in PBS) the protein purity was estimated as >90%. the dissociation phase was followed for 600 s and chip surfaces were regenerated by injecting 10 mM glycine HCl, pH2.0, 100 L/min for 18 s. data were analyzed using ProteOn Manager 3.1 software. 293T cells were transfected with pAA-IRES-MERS-EGFP (293T/EGFP, effector cells) encoding the MERS-CoV proteins or pAA-IRES-EGFP as a negative control. cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. a dimeric peptide-only control, namely CH3-pep, was also generated by linking HR2P peptide and IgG1 CH3 domain with the flexible (G4S)3 linker. this fusion protein possesses two peptides and comparable molecular weight compared to other constructs. all three m336-based fusion proteins (m336 scFv, m336 scFv-pep, and m336 diabody-pep) exhibited potent binding to S protein with very similar binding pattern. the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of m336 scFv for S protein was 0.8 nM with on-rate (kon) of 4.7 105 M1s1. m336 scFv, m336 scFv-pep and m336 diabody-pep exhibited potent neutralization activity. m336 diabody-pep inhibited the infection more potent than that of m336 scFv at low protein concentrations (0.03 nM) the control fusion protein CH3-pep showed no appreciable activity at a concentration as low as 0.5 nM. the m336 diabody-pep was significantly more potent than m336 scFv in inhibiting cell fusion. antibody-peptide bispecific fusion proteins, especially the m336 diabody-pep, have the potential to be developed as potent MERS-CoV inhibitors that could neutralize MERS-CoV infection, but also inhibit MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. the number of 293T/MERS/EGFP cells fused or unfused with Huh-7 cells were counted. the four proteins, m336 scFv, m336 scFv-pep, m336 diabody-pep, and CH3-pep were soluble expressed in E. coli cells with high efficiency. the m336 diabody-pep migrated as a monomer under the denaturing conditions of the SDS-PAGE. m336 diabody-pep showed similar binding kinetics to that of m336 scFv. the m336 scFv-pep had slightly more potent binding affinity (KD 0.2 nM) with slower dissociation rate constant (koff 1.2 104 s1), compared to the other two fusion proteins. m336 scFv, m336 scFv-pep and m336 diabody-pep exhibited potent neutralization activity. m336 diabody-pep inhibited the infection more potent than that of m336 scFv at low protein concentrations. m336 diabody-pep showed no appreciable activity at a concentration as low as 0.5 nM. the calculated IC50 for m336 diabody-pep was 0.81 0.02 nM. the m336 diabody-pep was significantly more potent than m336 scFv. discussion Monoclonal antibodies represent one of the most promising immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers and infectious diseases. previously, we used RBD of MERS-CoV S protein to screen a non-immune phage-displayed Fab library and identified two potent MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs, MERS-4 and MERS-27. m336 diabody-pep was the most potent in blocking cell-cell fusion. the m336-scFv interferes with viral attachment to the DPP4 receptor. the HR2P peptide inhibits the formation of the 6-helix-bundle fusion core and thus interrupts viral fusion with the target cell membrane. m336 diabody-pep was much more potent than m336 scFv at concentrations higher than 5 nM in the cell-cell fusion assay. all the fusion proteins could be easily produced in E. coli in large amount and low production cost. their half-life would be shorter than full-size IgG due to lack of Fc region. diseases."}
