{"summary": "the gp90 protein of avian reticuloendotheliosis-associated virus (REV-A) is an important envelope glycoprotein, which is responsible for inducing protective antibody immune responses in animals. the mAb A9E8 recognized phages with the consensus motif SVQYHPL. study may have potential applications in development of epitope-based marker vaccines against REV-A and other viruses of the REV group. the group includes defective REV-T [2], [3], non-defective REV-A [4], [5], chick syncytial virus [6], duck infectious anemia virus [7], and spleen necrosis virus [8]. monoclonal antibody (mAb) against gp90 protein from the REV-A strain HLJ07I used it to screen a phage-displayed random 12-mer peptide library for the linear B-cell epitope. the information provided in this study will facilitate the development of specific serological diagnosis of REV infection. spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells SP2/0 (SP2/0-Agl4; ATCC CRL 1581) [17], using 50% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (vol/vol) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) 100 L of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG, 15,000 dilution,Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and once with deionized water. the cells were mounted in 50 L of 90% glycerol in PBS. the ascitic fluid was heat inactivated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C. the dodecapeptide library consisted of 2.7109 electroporated sequences (1.51013 pfu/mL) the mAb was purified from the ascites fluid of mice inoculated with the hybridma cells secreting A9E8 by affinity chromatography. eluted phages were amplified by infecting E. coli (ER2738) eight individual phage clones were selected for target binding in ELISA. 96-well plates were coated with 100 ng of purified mAb A9E8, or anti-porcine IFN- mAb. oligonucleotides coding for wild-type and truncated versions of the epitope SVQYHPL were synthesized, annealed, and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1. expression plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent cells, followed by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-D-thioga CCGTACAGTATCACTAAC SVQYH-(H7PL) H7PL-R TCGAG TTAGTGATACTGTACGGAG R1-S GATCC TCCGTACAGTATCACCCTTTATAAC SVQYHPLA(R1) R1-R TCGAG TTAGGCTAAAGGGTGATACTGTACGGAG R3-S GATCC TCCGTACAGTATCACCCTTTATAAC PSVQYHPL 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% SDS\u2013PAGE) the gel was either stained with commassie blue staining solution or electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. after being washed three times with PBST, the membrane was probed with a 15,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, St Louis, MO, chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were prepared as primary cultures from 10-day-old chicken embryos. Viruses were grown in CEFs and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 5 days. suspension was frozen and thawed three times to disrupt cells and release virus. the spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells SP2/0 (SP2/0-Agl4; ATCC CRL 1581) [17], using 50% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (vol/vol) the hybridomas producing mAbs were cloned three times by limiting dilution of the cells. phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) containing 0.3% H2O2 for 5 minutes at room temperature in the dark. the reaction was stopped with 50 L/well of 2 M H2SO4 and the absorbance measured at 492 nm. the plates were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the presence of viral gp90 protein was detected by ELISA with the mAb A9E8. a neutralizing endpoint was determined by using a 50% specific signal calculation. the 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 10 g/mL of mAb A9E8 in coating buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. the phage library (1.51011 phages/100 L) was added to the blocked wells and the plate incubated for 1 h at room temperature. the eluted phages were amplified by infecting E. coli (ER2738) bound phages were subjected to reaction with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-M13 antibody (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NY, USA), followed by color development with substrate solution containing o-phenylenediamine (OPD). oligonucleotides coding for wild-type and truncated motif SVQYHPL were synthesized, annealed, and clo H7wt-S GATCC TCCGTACAGTATCACCCTTTATAAC SVQYHPL(H7wt) H7wt-R TCGAG TTATAAAGGGTGATACTGTACGGAG H7L-S GATCC TCCGTACAGTATCACCCTTAAC SVQYHP-(H7L) H7L-R TCGAG TTAAGGGTGATACTGTACGGAG H7PL-S GATCC CA L1-S GATCCCCC TCCGTACAGTATCACCCTTTATAAC PSVQYHPL(L1) L2-R TCGAG TTATAAAGGGTGATACTGTACGGAGGGG L3-S GATCCCTACCCC TCCGTACAGTATCACCCTTTATAAC YPSVQYHPL(L2) L2-R TCGAG TTATAAAGGGTGATACTGTACGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG ouse IgG (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) or HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. sequence alignment of epitope and regions on gp90 proteins of 32 REV-A strains, one REV-T strain, four SNV strains and one CSV strain was performed using the DNASTAR lasergene program. mAb A9E8 neutralized the virus with a neutralization titer (NT50) of 100. biopanning of a phage displayed 12-mer random peptide library was performed using the affinity purified mAb A9E8. eight phage clones were selected for reactivity with the mAb A9E8. the clones showed specific reactivity with the mAb A9E8. all the selected eight phage clones showed specific reactivity with the mAb A9E8. acid sequence of inserta A1 S Y Q Y H T L T Y T E L A2 G M A G V Q Y H P L H L A3 V N A L Y S V Q Y H P L L A4 S Y L S V Q Y E P L L T A5 A S V D Y Y T L T D L R A6 L E K F N M V Q G Q H T A7 A Y V T T P L Y T the color was developed using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. the color was developed using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) a series of GST-fusion proteins were expressed with extended amino acid residues at both N and C termini of the motif SVQYHPL. these proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and tested for reactivity with mAb A9E8 in Western blot. all amino acids in the motif were identical among all REV strains. the sequences of 32 REV-A strains, one REV -T strain and 5 other reticuloendotheliosis virus strains surrounding the epitope-coding region are boxed. mAb A9E8 neutralized the virus with a neutralization titer (NT50) of 100. biopanning of a phage displayed 12-mer random peptide library was performed using the affinity purified mAb A9E8. epitope prediction Eight phage clones were selected for reactivity with the mAb A9E8 after three rounds of biopanning. these selected clones were further evaluated by Phage ELISA for reactivity with the mAb A9E8 and a negative control mAb (anti-porcine IFN-) assays were performed for each selected phage. a DNA fragment coding for the motif SVQYHPL was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli.
