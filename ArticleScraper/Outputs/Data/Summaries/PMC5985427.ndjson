{"summary": "2068 volunteers from 142 countries were trained to provide early verification of health threat alerts via a secure, easy-to-use, online platform. the responses led to 194 ProMED posts, of which 99 (51%) supported verification of an outbreak, were published on ProMED. traditional disease surveillance techniques face several challenges. missing information from populations who do not access health care or do so through informal channels. delays in reporting due to delays in obtaining specimens for testing. EpiCore uses crowdsourcing to gather supplementary information to validate rumours and informal reports about disease outbreaks. they respond to requests sent by ProMED moderators via a secure online networking and reporting system. the information collected through EpiCore is then shared with ProMED subscribers worldwide. ProMED was using the services of 47 consultants with expertise in the areas of infectious diseases, virology, public health or epidemiology, microbiology, veterinary medicine, plant biology and toxicology. formal information sources included reports from health ministries, WHO, academic institutions and NGOs. responders chose to include their name and information when responding to a request for information. the response text masks any identifying information referenced in the response text and does not provide any details on my identity. Secure shell protocol was used to authenticate and establish a secure connection between the participating responder and project servers. demographic information on EpiCore responders included geographical location, education level, professional background, years of experience and work sector. requests for information included geographical location, number of members reached, number of responses received, rating of usefulness of member responses and time from request for information initiation to first response. each response that led to a ProMED report was evaluated by two of the authors to determine whether a report supported verification. responders were recruited at training programs in epidemiology and public health interventions network (TEPHINET) global and regional meetings. they were recruited through targeted recruitment of members of related organizations. the EpiCore programme manager vetted the applications from responders. a digital platform was developed by healthMap (Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, Boston, United States of America) to allow secure communication between responders and responders. the requester was able to select responders by country or by using a bounding box on the online platform that showed the approximate location of potential responders as pins on a map. the training took about one hour and prospective EpiCore members could complete the course online or in-person. trainings were also held for requesters about how to generate requests for information, use the digital platform to receive responses and disseminate responses that validated or de-escalated unverified outbreaks. about half of current EpiCore responders had more than 10 years of experience. 530 (26%) had 5\u201310 years of experience, 298 (14%) had 3\u20135 years of experience and 167 (8%) had less than 3 years of experience. most EpiCore responders worked in the government sector, 488 (24%) in NGOs or the non-profit sector. in country no.

EpiCore complements current ministry of health and WHO systems by addressing these gaps and verifying or refuting numerous unconfirmed public health events. current challenges and limitations of EpiCore include uneven geographical distribution of responders. some countries have no or very few responders. this is due in part to recruitment efforts being driven by location of infectious disease conferences, ProMED subscribers and partner organizations. EpiCore is meant to be a complementary tool supporting traditional and official surveillance systems through crowdsourcing. proMED subscribers include many personnel from the WHO, world organisation for animal health, national ministries of health and agriculture and many regional and local health authorities."}
