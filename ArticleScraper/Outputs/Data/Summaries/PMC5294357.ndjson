{"summary": "acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy (AHEI) is a less common etiology of pediatric purpura. patients with AHEI usually make a complete recovery within 1\u20133 weeks of presentation with supportive care only. tests showed a smiling infant with multiple erythematous and violaceous nonblanching plaques over her face, trunk, feet, and bilateral ears. no skin biopsy was performed given the classic appearance of the rash. a small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis causes benign purpura in children. it presents with rapidly progressive purpuric lesions over the face, extremities, and bilateral ears. the presence of bilateral auricular swelling and purpura in a well-appearing child should raise particular clinical suspicion for AHEI. coronavirus NL63 has been associated with petechial rash. this is the first case to our knowledge to be associated with AHEI. this is the fourth report in which a recurrence of symptoms occurred. awareness and early recognition of AHEI may prevent hospital admission, invasive workup and parental and provider concern."}
