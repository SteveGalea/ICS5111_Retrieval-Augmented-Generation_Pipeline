{"summary": "the first sequenced genomes were the RNA bacteriophage MS2 [1] and the DNA bacteriophage -X174 [2] as important as Drosophila was in shaping the field of genetics and tobacco Mosaic Virus was in advancing the study of virology and biochemistry. the focus was not on searching for natural recombinant bacteriophages. recombination occurs when two disparate DNA or RNA strands exchange or merge stretches of their sequences. mutation involves the substitution, deletion or insertion of a nucleotide resulting in the change of the nucleotide sequence of a gene or an amino acid sequence of a protein. ssRNA coliphage mutants failed to provide evidence for recombination. the first indication of RNA recombination in a male-specific ssRNA phage was the report of small, non homologous, recombinant RNA molecules produced from a purified template-free Q replicase molecule. the investigators noted similar RNA molecules were present in E. coli cells infected with phage Q. Chetverin et al. studied this phenomenon by observing the formation of novel sequences in RNA molecules. the approach taken here was to compare sequences from the JS strains to nucleotide and amino acid sequence data from entire genomes of 10 levivirus genogroup I strains and 5 levivirus genogroup II strains. a total of 17 strains (Table 1) were used to examine the relationships between nucleotides and amino acids in the Levivirus genus.

JS replicase differed from genogroup I replicase as it had one amino acid insertion at replicase position 467. lysis protein only generated results in a PfamB search matching the genus Leviviridae strains from both genogroups I and II. common protein motifs such as casein kinase II phosphorylation, cAMP and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation occurred in DL52 and DL54 when compared to the Levivirus strains. Simplot and bootscan analyses of replicase nucleotides from JS strains DL52 and DL54 compared to genogroup I strain fr and all genogroup II strains. no recombination was detected when DL52 and DL54 were compared to genogroup I strain fr. the recombination breakpoint occurred in the replicase gene in strain DL52 at nucleotide positions 787\u2013818 where the 2 changed from 0.8 to 6.3 (sum 2 of 7.1) the second breakpoint occurred at nucleotide positions 979\u20131029 where the 2 changed from 0.6 to 7.0 (sum 2 of 7.6) the JS strains, depicted in green, diverged from the other genogroup I strains at approximate nucleotide (nt) position 660. the JS strains, DL52 and DL54, diverged from the other genogroup I strains at approximate amino acid 220 within the replicase gene. recombination area within the replicase gene is shown in pink beginning at nucleotide 84 and crossing over at 592, upstream from the catalytic domain. DL52 was queried to all Levivirus (family Leviviridae) genogroup I FRNA Levivirus strains. parametric cost curves predicted the highest preference for recombination in strains DL52 and DL54. the remaining genogroup I strains did not show a preference for recombination (cost of 0\u20133). RAT, RDP3 and Recco all predicted recombination breakpoints. a total of 17 strains (Table 1) were used to examine the relationships between nucleotides and amino acids in the Levivirus genus. the first 9 strains in genogroup I, i.e., MS2, ST4, DL1, DL2, DL13, DL16, R17, M12 and J20, were referred to as \"MS2-like\" the JS strains also had identical ORF start and stop codon positions as previously reported for strain MS2. the JS strains also had identical ORF start and stop codon positions as the MS-2 like strains. nucleotide pairwise comparisons were made between all strains within the Levivirus genome, including strains within genogroups I, JS and genogroups II. the JS nucleotide sequences were more similar to MS2-like genogroup I (80\u201385%) than to the genogroup I strain fr (69%) or to genogroup II strains (52\u201354%) JS strains Strain DL52 DL54 DL52 100 DL54 96.73 100 DL1 81.48 81.87 DL16 85.41 84.72 ST4 80.30 80.11 R17 80.55 80.53 J20 82.00 82.01 MS2 80.12 80.01 fr 69.18 69.06 (ii) Genogroup II and JS strains (3525 nt) were shorter than all geno JS strains shared the 3' terminal \"signature\", ACCACCCA, present in Levivirus genogroups I and II. alignment of each genogroup is depicted in discontinuous blocks. 98\u2013100% and 95\u2013100% sequence similarities, respectively. the replicase protein sequences of the JS strains were quite dissimilar to the replicase protein sequences of the MS2-like genogroup I strains. JS replicase differed from genogroup I replicase as it had one amino acid insertion at replicase position 467 and one amino acid deletion at the 3' termini of the stop codon. the replicase catalytic domain in the JS strains occurred between amino acid positions 243\u2013373, thereby adding confidence to placing the grouping of JS into genogroup I [3]. the genogroup I strains, the JS subgroup strains, and the genogroup II strains all formed faithful clusters with correlations of 100, 90 and 98. the cluster cutoff method, however, showed only two relevant clusters being the genogroup I strains, which included fr and JS, and genogroup II strains. the Simplot and bootscan analyses of replicase nucleotides from strain DL52 queried to DL54, DL1, DL3, DL13, DL16, ST4, R17, J20 and MS2. the replicase nucleotide sequences in strain DL54 were 97% similar to strain DL52, DL52 was chosen as the query. recombination analysis of replicase nucleotide sequences from Leviviridae genogroup I strains DL13, DL16, ST4, R17, J20, MS2 diverged from the other genogroup I strains at approximate nucleotide (nt) position 660. the JS strains, DL52 and DL54, diverged from the other genogroup I strains at approximate nucleotide (nt) RDP3 predicted DL52 and DL54 as recombinant strains using several detection methods and analysis algorithms (Table 4) and suggested DL16 as a minor parent strain. breakpoint nucleotides for strains DL52 and DL54 occurred between nt 84\u2013592 and 84\u2013401. manual alignment of replicase nucleotides showed an insertion of the nucleotides YA beginning at position 1374. the amino acid composition of the JS strains diverged from the other genogroup I strains slightly upstream from this insertion at amino acid position 455. the graph represents the p-value for recombination at each position along the replicase gene. the lower graph represents the breakpoint p-values for the entire set of Levivirus genogroup I and JS strains DL52 and DL54. genogroup I strain fr was uniformly different from all other genogroup I strains in all four proteins. it is therefore plausible to propose natural recombination in these two novel JS-like FRNA coliphages. genetic exchange in ssRNA viruses was first demonstrated in polioviruses. human noroviruses, a positive sense ssRNA virus with a genome length of 7400\u20138300 nt, are considered to belong to a prototype strain. two sets of strains were investigated for recombination. one set was identified from a child care center in Houston, TX. a total of 64 additional human astroviruses lacked these novel traits. the exact amino acid and/or nucleotide breakpoint varied slightly along the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. the sliding window approach as used with many recombination programs is based on an arbitrarily chosen window length. however, manual alignment provided a more accurate picture of where the recombination event occurred along the genome. coliphage RNA was extracted from purified virus as described [26] using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) Purified RNA was stored frozen at &20 \u00b0C. 4.2. Sequencing and Analysis Full-length genome sequencing was performed by the \u201cprimer walking\u201d approach as described [3] phylogenetic trees were built by global cluster analysis performed on multiple aligned sequences. a bootstrap analysis, based on 10,000 substitutions, was used to measure cluster significance. reliability of each cluster was expressed on a percentage basis. Recombination events occurred when the 2 value changes signifying a breakpoint position. RAT uses a distance-based method of recombination in both DNA and protein multiple alignments. default settings were window size of 10% of the sequence length and an increment size being half of the window size. strains CICEET 29 and CICEET 24 were isolated and placed into the putative JS subgroup [10,11] using the genotyping methods of Vinj\u00e9 et al., [4]. each strain was plaque purified and further enriched using Escherichia coli HS(pFamp)R as host. Phylogenetic trees were built by global cluster analysis performed on multiple aligned sequences and clustered by UPGMA using arithmetic averages. a bootstrap analysis, based on 10,000 substitutions, was used to measure cluster significance. genogroup I strains DL1, DL2, DL13, DL16, ST4, R17, J20, MS2, fr, and genogroup II strains GA, KU1, DL10, DL20 and T72 were analyzed. RAT default settings were window size of 10% of sequence length and an increment size being half of the window size. recco uses an algorithm that locates putative recombination points based on cost minimization. the cost of mutation relative to recombination is represented by. the proposed classification of JS strains is genogroup I subgroup \u201cJS-like\u201d. both JS strains were prepared for sequencing in the same laboratory. the possibility that contamination resulted in false recombinants seems unlikely."}
