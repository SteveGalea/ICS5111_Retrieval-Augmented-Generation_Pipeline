{"summary": "the aim was to adapt and apply shortell et al.'s (1998) four dimensions of CQI in an examination of a public health accountability and performance management initiative in Ontario, Canada. in total, 24 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with informants from public health units. empirical evidence on the impact of quality improvement approaches in public health is emerging. development of CQI in healthcare settings has been much more extensive, dating back to the late 1980s. many of the key factors presented in the four-dimensions framework overlap with those emphasized in the public health quality improvement literature. the importance of training and education in quality-improvement concepts and techniques is also stressed in both the public health literature and the technical dimension. system of accountability and performance management currently undergoing implementation across 36 municipal and regional public health jurisdictions. the system is composed of (1) the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS), which outline the program and service requirements for boards of health and public health units. interviews for both public health unit and public health informants included specific and broad items relating to facilitators and barriers within the four dimensions of CQI. a web survey of public health managers was conducted. quantitative data collected using keysurvey.com were recoded for descriptive and bivariate analyses using SPSS. two-sided Fisher's exact tests (p\" 0.05) assessed association because of the small survey sample. findings are presented across strategic, cultural, technical and structural dimensions. a large proportion of survey respondents reported moderate or great familiarity with many components of the intervention. many public health unit informants cited participation in committees and working groups related to the CQI initiative. local informants noted that the Ministry took a hard line in making decisions despite concerns voiced by the field. public health unit informants acquiesced to the province's quality improvement initiative. each of the local public health unit interview sites placed greater emphasis on internal systems of performance management to foster meaningful performance improvement. 74% of survey respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that an emphasis on provincial performance measurement and target achievement would interfere with the quality of program and service provision at a local public health level. site-A informant Site-B exhibited many characteristics of group culture. site-A exhibited many characteristics of group culture, such as teamwork and participation. risk-taking and innovation were often regarded as very important aspects of the organization's culture. sites-C informant Resistance to change, unrewarded achievement and hierarchical and rational organizational cultures are regard as barriers to the cultural dimension. 84.3% of the survey sample agreed or strongly agreed that the initiative was primarily concerned with maintaining compliance with public health practice and performance expectations. respondents in the area of emergency preparedness were more likely to disagree with the statement that data generated from the provincial initiative would be used to improve performance. the choice of population health outcomes as measures of public health performance was identified as problematic because of externalities that made attributing public health outputs difficult. some performance indicators were perceived as unreflective of public health performance by health units. site-C informant said performance information would allow for \"discussion\" with public health units. some public health unit informants speculated that performance information lacked the context to address why the results were the way they were. only 55% of survey respondents believed the province's system of accountability and performance management had the intent of providing learning opportunities and improving performance. the strategic dimension emphasizes the importance of leadership, communication and inclusion of all stakeholders in decision-making. many public health unit informants cited participation in committees and working groups related to the CQI initiative. local informants noted the Ministry took a hard line in making decisions despite concerns voiced by the field. one informant corroborated this dynamic by stating their interest in the input provided by the field. 74% of survey respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that emphasis on provincial performance measurement and target achievement would interfere with the quality of program and service provision at a local public health level. some did not consider general resourcing to be adequate for achieving all targets. all three public health unit interview sites exhibited at least some of the characteristics of developmental and/or group culture. Site-A informant Site-B appeared to be an equally distributed mix of developmental, group and rational cultural types. Site-C informant: \"i think setting targets and celebrating the reaching of the targets is the other part\" 84.3% of the survey sample agreed or strongly agreed that the initiative was primarily intended to promote learning. Site-A informant Gaps in training and data systems can be precursor to frustration and false starts. some guidance materials, such as the previously mentioned tuberculosis protocol, were criticized by Site-C informants. site-B informant Ministry informants generally agreed that information systems needed to be improved and that this task was a difficult one. but when evidence was weak, best-practice information was used in place of causal linkages between OPHS requirements and outcomes. Site-C informant Ministry informants stated that performance information would allow for \u201cdiscussion\u201d with public health units. some public health unit informants speculated that these discussions would include questions of what barriers to performance existed. only 55% of survey respondents believed the province's system of accountability and performance management had the intent of providing learning opportunities and improving performance. the importance of senior and managerial leadership engagement cannot be over-emphasized, as previous reviews of public health quality improvement initiatives have shown. public health unit informants were adamant that performance targets indicated by population health outcomes were problematic. limitations This study is limited by its small public health unit sample, which ultimately cannot represent the broader set of units. boards of health are acknowledged to be important stakeholders in the public health system, but members were not included in this study because of unsuccessful recruitment. framework relating to facilitators and barriers of CQI implementation has largely confirmed disparate public health research on the topic. this confirmation is a promising indicator that the framework may hold value as a tool for public health decision-makers developing and implementing CQI systems."}
