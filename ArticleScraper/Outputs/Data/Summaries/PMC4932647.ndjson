{"summary": "WNV is a positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus in the Flaviviridae family. large outbreaks have occurred globally in both humans and other animals. the first isolation of WNV from a dromedary calf in the united arab Emirates during the process of MERS-CoV screening. the results of the comparative genome and phylogenetic analysis were obtained during a necropsy of a dromedary calf at the central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai, the United arab Emirates. samples were examined with a Philips EM208s electron microscope. sample preparation for Illumina sequencing RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) a single round of priming and extension was performed using the Klenow fragment polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, UK) ome at 55 \u00b0C for 5 min was amplified in 12 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. the amplified DNA library was purified using 1.8 AMPure XP beads. complete polyprotein nucleotide sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstraps was constructed using the GTR substitution model. nucleotide sequence of the dromedary WNV genome isolated in this study has been lodged in the GenBank sequence database. cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 and inspected for cytopathic effects daily using inverted microscopy. sample preparation for Illumina sequencing RNA was extracted from the isolated virus using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. metagenomics library was generated using a DNA library prepared with the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) the amplified DNA library was purified using 1.8 AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral genome were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using the 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche, Penzberg,Germany) nucleotide sequence of the genome and the deduced amino-acid sequences of the open reading frames were compared with those of other WNV strains with complete genomes. both the cytopathic effects and viral morphology were inconsistent with those of MERS-CoV. a total of 10 345 nucleotide positions were included in the analysis. a total of 10 302 nucleotide positions were included in the analysis. a total of 10 302 nucleotide positions were included in the analysis. the scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. only changes that occurred in 3 strains indicate no difference from the dromedary WNV. cytopathic effects of WNV from a dromedary on vero cells showed cell rounding, progressive degeneration and detachment. dromedary WNV occupied a unique position within lineage 1a. a total of 10 345 nucleotide positions were included in the analysis. a total of 10 302 positions were included in the analysis. dromedary WNV strains isolated from a mosquito in Kenya, horses in Italy and a human in Italy. putative E protein encoded by the genome possessed the original WNV E protein glycosylation motif NYS at E154\u2013156. 14 amino-acid residues in the present dromedary WNV genome. in the united arab Emirates, antibodies against WNV have been reported in 38% of 1119 dromedary sera5 and 19.2% of 750 tested equine sera. in the united arab Emirates, antibodies against WNV have been reported in 38% of 1119 dromedary sera5 and 19.2% of 750 tested equine sera. this finding was consistent with previous studies that showed that WNV could also be detected in respiratory specimens from birds, humans and other mammals. 14 amino-acid positions located in various regions of the genome showed marked differences with the corresponding amino acids in the genomes of the isolate's close relatives in cluster 2. most of the amino-acid differences between the present dromedary WNV and the closely related WNVs from Africa and Europe are located in the E and NS5 genes. dromedaries as reservoir of MERS-CoV have boosted interest in the search for novel viruses in dromedaries. dromedary camel hepatitis E virus is a cause of chronic hepatitis E infection in a liver transplant recipient with a habit of camel milk and meat consumption. another group found this dromedary camel hepatitis E virus as a cause of chronic hepatitis E infection."}
