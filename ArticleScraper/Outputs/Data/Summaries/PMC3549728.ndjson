{"summary": "Background Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is clinically defined as a combination of fever, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities, pancytopenia, progressive macrophage proliferation throughout the reticuloendothelial system. it may be primary or secondary to infectious, auto-immune, and tumoral diseases. the pathognomonic characteristic of HPS is the activation of well-differentiated macrophages, phagocyting erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets in bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, liver and other organs. the syndrome was first described in 1939 as poorly-controlled histiocyte proliferation, but has since also been called hemophagocytic histiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome. the aim of this review is to make a critical appraisal of the literature concerning infection-related HPS in paediatrics. the study is to make a critical appraisal of the literature concerning infection-related HPS in paediatrics. the constellation of signs and symptoms of HPS is not specific and none of the biochemical abnormalities is distinctive. the dramatic presentation of the syndrome includes unremitting fever, visceromegaly, thrombocytopenia, lethargy, seizures, skin rash, pulmonary failure, and cardiac and/or renal involvement. the most common laboratory findings are due to liver dysfunction. e) hemophagocytosis in any involved organ f) very little or no NK cell activity g) increased ferritin 500 mg/L h) increased soluble CD25 (serum interleukin-2 receptor alpha) 2.400 U/mL The main pathophysiological abnormality in HPS is cytokine dysfunction, which leads to the uncontrolled accumulation and ectopic migration of activated T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells and histiocytes a pathogenic viral strain that is genetically similar to the strains observed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. the first occurs during primary infection and the second during a reactivation process. in rare cases, EBV may infect T and NK cells and induce persistent EBV infection. hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the last treatment resort for refractory forms of EBV-related HPS. the most frequent herpes viruses associated with HPS other than EBV are cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpes virus 8 (HHV8). HHV8 has been associated with HPS in 13 patients. most of these cases occurred in patients with a lymphoproliferative disorder [45] or immunocompromised patients [46], and rarely in immunocompetent hosts [47]. patients with severe H5N1 (avian) influenza have symptoms similar to those observed in patients with HPS, mainly encephalitis, organ dysfunction with hemophagocytosis, bone marrow failure, and pro-inflammatory cytokine over-production. recombinant hemagglutinin (H5) from H5N1 virus can suppress perforin expression and reduce the cytotoxicity of T cells, including their ability to kill H5-bearing cells. underlying disease was found in four patients who experienced a fatal outcome. ten patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (six in combination with corticosteroids), but only seven survived. other viruses associated with HPS include adenovirus, paramyxovirus and rubella virus. evidence of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis was found in 83% of cases. anti-tuberculous and immunomodulatory therapy may lead to a better outcome. one reported case of HPS occurred after childhood vaccination. psis caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was reported for the first time in a previously healthy 3-year-old. leishmaniasis may mimic the syndrome, as it is characteristically associated with organomegaly and pancytopenia. sporadic cases of undiagnosed leishmaniasis have been treated as HPS with fatal consequences. marneffei infection is common among HIV-infected patients in many regions in Southeast Asia. the first case of HPS associated with penicilliosis in a Thai HIV-infected child was reported in 2001, with complete recovery after antifungal and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. genetic HPS is heterogeneous and arises from defects in the critical regulatory pathways responsible for the natural termination of immune responses. two highly diagnostic clues are increased plasma concentrations of the alpha chain of interleukin-2 receptors (also known as sCD25) and impaired NK cell activity. the hallmark of HPS is the phagocytosis of blood cells and their precursors. ectopic migration of activated T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells and histiocytes leads to persistent activation of lymphocytes and histiocytes. hypersecretion of pro-inflamatory cytokines and high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels that correlate with the prognosis. every form of HPS can mimic infectious diseases, thus hindering the diagnosis of a precipitating and treatable infectious illness. serological testing can help determine whether EBV-associated HPS has occurred in the setting of acute infection or is the result of a reactivation process. the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection and quantification of EBV nucleic acid is an important laboratory means of adequately reflecting viral replication and assessing EBV load in patients with EBV-related HPS. antiviral therapy with acyclovir, ganciclovir or cidofovir has led to disappointing results. hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the last treatment resort for refractory forms of HPS. most frequent herpes viruses associated with HPS other than EBV are cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpes virus 8 (HHV8). treatment based on etoposide, ganciclovir, foscarnet or rituximab has led o successful results. HPS can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, alone or with a wide variety of underlying disorders. PB2, HA and NA are significantly related to cytokine release. recombinant hemagglutinin (H5) from H5N1 virus can suppress perforin expression and reduce the cytotoxicity of T cells, including their ability to kill H5-bearing cells. some authors suggest treatment with a shorter course of etoposide and dexamethasone. HPS associated with bacterial infections Reactive HPS has frequently been associated with intracellular pathogens. pathophysiology of HPS associated with non-viral agents may be related to the production of high levels of activating cytokines by host lymphocytes and monocytes. intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine A, epipodophyllotoxin or plasma exchange may lead to a better outcome. one reported case of HPS occurred after childhood vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin [75] sporadic cases of undiagnosed leishmaniasis have been treated as HPS with fatal consequences. yeast (Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Aspergillus spp., Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium spp.) have been associated with the occurrence of HPS. two forms of EBV-related HPS have been described. the first occurring during primary infection and the second during a reactivation process. in rare cases, EBV may infect T and NK cells and induce persistent EBV infection. cell lymphomas may describe the extremes of a spectrum of disordered T lymphocyte proliferation following EBV infection. of all the infections associated with HPS, EBV infection has the worst prognosis in the presence of underlying hereditary disorders, diffuse intravascular coagulation, neutropenia, or central nervous system involvement. HPS was observed in seven of a series of 171 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HHV8 has been associated with HPS in 13 patients. most cases occurred in patients with a lymphoproliferative disorder or immunocompromised patients. patients with severe H5N1 (avian) influenza have symptoms similar to those observed in patients with HPS, mainly encephalitis, organ dysfunction with hemophagocytosis, bone marrow failure, and pro-inflammatory cytokine over-production. some authors have suggested treatment with a shorter course of etoposide and dexamethasone [63]. four patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (six in combination with corticosteroids), but only seven survived. HPS associated with bacterial infections Reactive HPS has frequently been associated with intracellular pathogens. pathophysiology of HPS associated with non-viral agents may be related to production of high levels of activating cytokines by host lymphocytes and monocytes. sarcoidosis-related HPS has a poor prognosis, with a mortality rate of approximately 50%. anti-tuberculous and immunomodulatory therapy may lead to a better outcome. one reported case of HPS occurred after childhood vaccination. sporadic cases of undiagnosed leishmaniasis have been treated as HPS with fatal consequences. yeast (Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium spp.) have been associated with the occurrence of HPS. neoplastic diseases, protracted corticosteroid administration, and transplantation are common among HIV-infected patients in many regions in Southeast Asia. the first case of HPS associated with penicilliosis in a Thai HIV-infected child was reported in 2001. a multidisciplinary approach by experienced clinicians and infectious disease specialists is required to ensure the appropriate management of the syndrome. a combination of high fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, cytopenia, organomegaly and characteristic histological findings. a better understanding of the pathophysiology of HPS should clarify the interactions between immune system pathways and infections. severe cases of infection-dependent HPS require immunosuppressants or chemotherapeutic agents. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors\u2019 contributions VA and DR drafted the manuscript and contributed equally to its preparation."}
