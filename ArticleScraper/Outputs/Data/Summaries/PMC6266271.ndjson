{"summary": "CF is a common autosomal recessive genetic disease that affects multiple organ systems. aggressive early interventions have been established to improve quality of life of people with CF. progressive lung disease remains difficult to manage and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. regulator mutations are categorized into 6 classes based on the mutation function or protein output. a red \u201cx\u201d or arrow indicates where each CFTR mutant protein is affected. people with CF can have more than one mutation; thus, the percentage is representative of the entire population. two groups demonstrated proof-of-concept for gene therapy by expressing full length CFTR complementary DNA (cDNA) within a year of discovering CFTR, two groups independently demonstrated the proof-of-concept for gene therapy by expressing full length CFTR complementary DNA (cDNA) in CF cells. functional CFTR assays and new model systems were being rapidly developed. experiments were performed on patient-derived immortalized cells such as CF pancreatic cells [17], human bronchial epithelial cells [19], CF bronchial epithelial cells [19], and IB3-1 cells [20]. established metrics to quantify CFTR expression levels and activity included messenger RNA abundance. three CF patients received an Ad vector (serotype 2) carrying CFTR. the vector was applied to nasal turbinates with an applicator for 30 min. one side was biopsied and the contralateral side was used to measure NPD. CFTR mRNA and protein were undetectable. the effects were transient and inflammatory responses were observed. innate and cellular immune responses presented obstacles to achieving long-term and efficient gene transfer with Ad-based vectors. in 1999, an Ad5 vector carrying the OTC gene was delivered to an 18-year-old male subject named Jesse Gelsinger. four days after administration, he died from multiple organ failure and associated cytokine storm. in total, 9 CF clinical trials used Ad as the delivery vehicle. vector modifications and delivery agents were screened to improve titer, tropism, transduction efficiency, expression, and stability. in this era, research focused on improving gene delivery, measuring persistent expression, and understanding the host immune response to viral vectors. a single dose of AAV transduced airways and conferred stable expression for many months. many studies showed their safety and efficacy in repeat dosing to nonhuman primates and mice. many studies showed their safety and efficacy in repeat dosing. AAV clinical trials failed to meet trial endpoints of detecting CFTR DNA from nasal brushings by PCR, a change in NPD, a change in specified metrics as measured by high resolution CT scan, and an improved FEV1. despite low CFTR expression levels, the results were encouraging because they demonstrated the safety of the vector. a cationic lipid complexed with CFTR showed partial NPD correction of cAMP-mediated Cl transport in the nasal epithelium of six people with CF. in the first nonviral clinical trial by Caplen et al., a cationic lipid complexed with CFTR showed partial, transient expression lasting no longer than 4 weeks. retroviral vectors replaced retroviral vectors as they could effectively transduce nondividing airway cells. lentiviral vectors were welcomed as a promising therapeutic option because genomic integration could provide long-term expression. lentiviruses became a new interest in the field of CF gene therapy. many studies confirmed that primate and non-primate lentiviral vectors were promising gene therapy candidates. a GP64 pseudotyped FIV was shown to support gene transfer in a pig model. a series of events exemplifies a use of vehicle formulations to overcome physical and immunological barriers to the vector. many vehicle formulations were evaluated for their ability to improve receptor access or reduce immunostimulation upon entry as a means to increase transduction efficiency. a novel hybrid promoter/ EF1 promoter developed for nonviral clinical trials proved efficacious. the development of a minimal synthetic promoter F5Tg83 also facilitated improved CFTR expression from an AAV vector. -dependent Ad (HDAd) was developed, expressing no viral proteins. this was a strategy to reduce immune responses to viral antigens. studies comparing first generation Ad to HDAd focused on understanding the innate immune responses. a single dose of AAV transduced airways conferred stable expression for many months. many studies showed their safety and efficacy in repeat dosing to nonhuman primates [82,83] and mice, even in presence of neutralizing antibodies. three additional single dose AAV clinical trials for CF were published in 2004 and 2007 [94,95] results from the dose escalation AAV clinical trials for CF were published in 2004 and 2007 [94,95]. these trials used an AAV carrying the full length CFTR cDNA driven by the promoter activity from the AAV ITR. nonviral vector delivery is an enticing approach because there are no size constraints; however, efficient delivery to cells is challenging. a nonviral approach to delivering CFTR was not enough to achieve clear phenotypic correction. retroviral vectors replaced retroviral vectors as they could effectively transduce nondividing airway cells. lentiviral vectors were welcomed as a promising therapeutic option because genomic integration could provide long-term expression. retroviral vectors were welcomed as promising therapeutic option because genomic integration could provide long-term expression. lentiviruses became a new interest in the field of CF gene therapy. lentiviruses became a new interest in the field of CF gene therapy. many studies confirmed that primate and non-primate lentiviral vectors were promising gene therapy candidates. studies redirecting CAR to the apical surface of human airway epithelial cells using a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage increased apical gene transfer. many vehicle formulations were evaluated for their ability to improve receptor access or reduce immunostimulation upon entry as a means to increase transduction efficiency. a novel hybrid promoter/ EF1 promoter developed for nonviral clinical trials proved efficacious. the inclusion of inducible promoters regulated by transgene expression levels and modified CFTR expression cassettes were novel ways to regulate gene expression through vector design. studies comparing first generation Ad to HDAd focused on understanding the innate immune responses. both Ad5-CFTR and HDAd5-CFTR decreased lung bacterial infections through restoration of CFTR to the airways in mice [178,179,180,181] the CF pig recapitulates several features of human lung disease. a CF ferret first reported in 2008 is another large animal model with a lung disease phenotype. a novel parvovirus vector derived from human bocavirus transduces ferret airways. an important advance in understanding CF disease pathogenesis was elucidated using the CF pig by Pezzulo et al. in 2012. from these studies, relevant assays were devised to measure CFTR correction in vivo. from these studies, relevant assays were devised to measure CFTR correction in vivo. gene editing by both ZFNs [209,210], TALEN [211] and CRISPR/Cas9 [212] methods have been evaluated in vitro. interests include both delivery to respiratory epithelia and systemic delivery strategies that might correct CF defects in multiple affected organs. gene therapies approved for use in Europe include tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel. lentiviral vectors are delivered to autologous T cells, with some patients achieving complete remission. breakthroughs in gene therapy for other genetic diseases fueling new interest in CF. the early surge in enthusiasm to develop a gene therapy treatment for CF fell to the realization that delivering CFTR to the lung was more complex than expected. improvements in vector design and delivery methods, understanding lung biology and disease development, and the ability to use new animal models are all reenergizing the gene therapy field. a hybrid nonviral transposon/viral integrating vector system led to persistent expression in mice for at least a year. a recent study documents whole lung distribution by a piggyBac/Ad vector and phenotypic correction of a CF pig model. gene therapies approved for use in europe include alofisel, Spherox, Zalmoxis, Stimvelis, Imlygic, and Holoclar. major breakthroughs in gene therapy for other genetic diseases is fueling new interest in CF. new animal models recapitulate features of human lung disease allow preclinical studies to refine delivery protocols."}
