{"summary": "bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 (BVDV-2), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3) play an important role in the pathogenesis of BRD because of their ability to impair the integrity of the upper respiratory tract, cause immunosuppression, promote secondary bacterial infection. commercial colostrum-replacement products may provide adequate passive immunity. a greater mass of IgG (150 to 200 g) increases passive immunity. the ability of colostrum-replacement products to provide calves with adequate levels of antibodies against BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3 have not been described. all 16 calves born on the farm that did not vaccinate against BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3 were assigned to the CR group. group CR received 2 packets of a colostrum-replacement product providing 100 g of IgG per packet. calf isolation barn provided biosecurity to prevent exposure to BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3. after 12 h of life the calves were examined and fed 1.8 L of a commercial milk replacer twice daily until weaning. a calf starter, hay, and free-choice water were offered to all the calves from 1 wk of age until weaning. serum IgG concentration at 2 d of age (g/L) plasma volume (L) total IgG intake (g) was estimated as 9.9% of the body weight. blood samples were collected from all the calves for virus antibody testing. mean log2 antibody titers were calculated from the endpoint titers for the animals in each group. the mean time to reach seronegative status was defined as a serum antibody titer less than 2, which equates to a log2 antibody titer of 0. standard positive-control serum samples were obtained from cattle with high titers of neutralizing antibody against BHV-1 and BPIV-3. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used as a negative control for all the serum samples. single radial immunodiffusion Undiluted serum samples obtained before colostrum feeding, maternal colostrum diluted 1:4 obtained after colostrum feeding, maternal colostrum diluted 1:15 and colostrum-replacement samples diluted 1:15 were assayed for total IgG concentration. antiserum against bovine IgG (heavy and light chains; Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, Pennsylvania, USA) was used. analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done to compare the mean time to reach seronegative status among treatment groups with the use of a generalized linear model. a nonparametric 1-way ANOVA was done to compare the mean serum antibody levels for each virus at each time point. all 16 calves born on the farm that did not vaccinate against BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3 were assigned to the CR group. group CR received 2 packets of a colostrum-replacement product. group MC received 3.8 L of fresh or frozen maternal colostrum. calf isolation barn provided biosecurity to prevent exposure to BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3 during the trial. the calves were fed 1.8 L of a commercial milk replacer twice daily until weaning, between 6 and 8 wk of age. after 12 h of life the calves were examined and fed 1.8 L of a commercial milk replacer. serum IgG concentration at 2 d of age (g/L) plasma volume (L) total IgG intake (g) was estimated as 9.9% of the body weight. blood samples were collected from all the calves for virus antibody testing at 2 and 7 d of age. mean log2 antibody titers were calculated from the endpoint titers for the animals in each group. seronegativity to BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 was defined as a serum antibody titer less than 2, which equates to a log2 antibody titer of 0. standard positive-control serum samples were obtained from cattle with high titers of neutralizing antibody against BHV-1 and BPIV-3. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used as a negative control for all the serum samples. all ELISA results were calibrated against their respective standard positive controls. single radial immunodiffusion Undiluted serum samples obtained before colostrum feeding, maternal colostrum diluted 1:15 and colostrum-replacement samples diluted 1:15 were assayed for total IgG concentration. antiserum against bovine IgG (heavy and light chains; Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, Pennsylvania, USA) was used. 3 wells of a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate were inoculated with a median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of the test strain of 100 to 500 per milliliter. after inoculation, the plate was incubated at 38.5\u00b0C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air for 1 h. positive and negative control serum was included in each plate. a 1:5000 dilution of protein G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was added. the net OD value of the sample was calculated by subtracting the mean sample OD values of the wells coated with the cell control from the mean sample OD values of the wells coated with BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3 antigen. the results for each virus were classified as positive or negative according to whether the ELISA reactivity was greater or less than 10 EU. all samples were tested in triplicate and incubated in a humid atmosphere at 25\u00b0C for 18 to 24 h. a nonparametric 1-way ANOVA was done to compare the mean serum antibody levels for each virus at each time point. the chi-squared test was used to compare the proportion of calves reaching seronegative status with respect to each virus at each time point between the treatment groups. the mean total mass of IgG administered by feeding was higher with maternal colostrum than with colostrum replacement. the calves in the MC group had higher mean concentrations of serum IgG at 2 d of age than the calves in the CR group: 20.65 versus 12.41 g/L. statistically significant differences were not observed between the groups at any time point. BPIV-3, statistically significant differences were not observed between the groups at any time point. the mean level was significantly higher in the MC group than in the CR group at 8 mo of age (P = 0.032) the decay rate was similar in the 2 groups. for BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BRSV, and BHV-1 the variation was significantly greater (P 0.05) in the MC group at 2 d and 2 mo of age. the 2-d time point represents the time the first sample was obtained after administration of the colostrum-replacement product or maternal colostrum. the duration of passively acquired immunity, expressed as the mean time to reach seronegative status with respect to BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3, did not differ significantly between the CR and MC groups. significant decay of antibody titers was observed after 1 mo of age for each virus BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3 treatment were seronegative. differences between groups were significant only at 2 and 3 mo of age. the differences between the groups were significant at 7 d, 1 mo, 2 mo, 3 mo, 4 mo, and 5 mo of age. two doses of the product used in this study provided serum levels of virusspecific antibodies that were similar to those in calves that received 3.8 L of good-quality maternal colostrum. a wide range of levels of antibodies to respiratory viruses has been reported in calves after maternal colostrum intake (12,13) these levels have a direct effect on the duration of colostrum-derived immunity, as calves with low initial levels become seronegative earlier in life. the mean duration of colostrum-derived antibodies in beef calves was 185.6 59.8 d for BVDV-1, 157.8 56.1 d for BVDV-2, 183.7 33 d for BRSV, 122.9 46.6 d for BHV-1, and 190.6 58.3 d for BPIV-3. variable duration of colostrum-derived immunity could result in poor calf-herd immunity and increase the risk of introduction of BVDV-1, BVDV-2, BRSV, and BHV-1 into the calf herd. the more uniform time to seronegativity suggests that it should be possible to better predict the optimal time to vaccinate calves fed the replacement product compared with maternal colostrum. this should be the subject of additional study."}
