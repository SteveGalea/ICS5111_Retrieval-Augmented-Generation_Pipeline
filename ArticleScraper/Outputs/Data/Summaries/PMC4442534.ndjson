{"summary": "bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most common and costly problem in the cattle industry. the annual costs of BRD have been estimated at over 1 billion dollars per year. bacterial infections are thought to be opportunistic infections precipitated by viral infections causing damage to the respiratory epithelium (5, 6) studies of farm animals have revealed the presence of both known and new viruses occurring at high frequency in healthy and sick animals (20, 23\u201327) the Schmallenberg bunyavirus was recently identified in the plasma of cows with fever, decreased milk production, and diarrhea. a novel astrovirus was recently identified in brain tissues as the likely cause of a common neurological condition in cattle. all case and control calves had nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal recess swabs collected. the swab was inserted five inches into a clean naris and rotated against the surface for 15 s. the swab was removed and placed into the same tube of viral transport medium. cDNA was synthesized using Klenow fragment DNA polymerase extension. resulting double-stranded cDNA and DNA were then PCR amplified using ampliTaq gold DNA polymerase and a 20-base primer. the randomly amplified nucleic acid was then subjected to the NexteraXT library preparation protocol (Illumina) Sequences belonging to different viral families are reanalyzed manually. reads representing the same viral genome with high sequence identities were reassembled with high-sequence-identity criteria. reads representing different viral strains were individually identified and analyzed. samples were resequenced using an Illumina MiSeq Platform. real-time PCR was performed in a Roche 480 thermocycler using a Fam-Zen TaqMan probe. the primer-probe set for each virus investigated by real-time PCR. the reaction mix consisted of 15 mM KCl, 40 mM Tris HCl, 25 g bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 mM Mg2+, 20 mM dNTP, 1 M each primer, 0.2 M TaqMan probe, and 0.75 units Fastart Taq polymerase (Roche) Bovine adenovirus 3 Adenoviridae KP264982 2,547 4,279 Bovine adenovirus 3 98 (Hexon) Bovine adeno-associated virus Parvoviridae KP264981 4,279 3,481 Bovine adeno-associated virus 98 (Rep) Bovine rhinitis A virus BSRI4 Picornaviridae KP264974 7,207 11,109 Bovine r 79 bovine herpesvirus 2 96 (NS1) Bovine herpesviridae 19 Bovine herpesvirus 6 96 to 100 (multiple) Viral metagenomics. resulting 160-l pools were passed through a 200-nm filter. nucleic acids were then extracted using the QIAquick viral RNA column purification system according to the manufacturer's instructions. human reads and bacterial reads were subtracted by mapping these reads to human reference genome hg19 and bacterial RefSeq genomes release 66 using bowtie2 (34). reads were considered duplicates if bases 5 to 55 from 5\u2032 end were identical. one random copy of duplicates was kept. longer gaps were obtained by bridging PCR amplification with TaKaRa LA Taq. random cDNA templates were generated prior to amplification with cDNA ends (RACE) cDNA kits followed by amplification with LA Taq (TaKaRa) individual samples were prepared for next-generation sequencing in a manner analogous to that described above. a 3-l portion of the above-described premix was mixed with 17 l of nucleic acid. for DNA virus screening, the cDNA synthesis step was omitted. for DNA virus screening, the synthesis step was omitted. the same virus cannot be compared across different viruses. the open reading frame (ORF) of the viral nucleotide sequences was analyzed with Geneious version R6. bovine rhinitis A virus > bovine adenovirus 3 > adeno-associated virus > bovine rhinitis B virus > astrovirus BSRI1 > picobirnavirus > picobirnavirus. deep sequencing revealed 4,279 sequences related to bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV3), providing coverage of 82.6% of the total genome length. a complete hexon sequence was obtained, which shared 98% amino acid identity to that of bovine adenovirus 3 (AF030154) a total of 11,109 reads with sequences identities to bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) were detected. a near-complete genome (KP264974) was assembled, resulting in a 7,207-base sequence. a total of 512 bases of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) were generated and were 91% identical to that of the reference genome. the phylogenetic analysis therefore revealed multiple, closely related bovine rhinitis viruses from the genus Aphthovirus present in the bovine respiratory disease sample set. the phylogenetic analysis therefore revealed multiple, closely related bovine rhinitis viruses from the genus Aphthovirus. ORF1a and ORF1b encode nonstructural and RdRp proteins. the highly conserved AAAAAAC sequence was identified at residues 2246 to 2252. the conserved promoter sequence UUUGGAGNGGNGGACCNAAN14AUGNC was detected at the start of ORF2. the presence of these stop codons was detected in both pooled and individual deep-sequencing runs using separate RNA extracts. active RdRp may be provided by minority wild-type helper picobirnavirus in the same cell. bovine rhinitis B virus strains BSRI1 and -3 were screened using the same real-time PCR assay targeting their conserved RdRp regions. the results from the real-time PCR case-control study are shown in Fig. 2. twelve animals (24%) from the symptomatic group had detectable amounts of bovine rhinitis A virus RNA. four animals (8%) tested positive for the presence of the BSRI4 strain. a significantly different rate of detection was calculated using Fisher's exact test (P = 0.009) only a single animal with BRD tested positive for picobirnavirus BSRI1. resulting P value were nonsignificant at 0.117. adeno-associated viruses have not been associated with disease. bovine adeno-associated virus (BAAV) was detected with 3,481 sequences. assembled genome contains replicase- and capsid-encoding genes. reads shared 98.5% amino acid identity in the replicase with previously described BAAV. the complete polyprotein showed 94% identity to that of the reference BRAV genome and single currently available BRAV genome (JN936206). another 2,639 sequence reads were more closely related to bovine rhinitis B viruses (BRBVs) further sequence analysis revealed the presence of several BRBV strains. PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing were used to identify an individual sample within a pool containing influenza virus. further deep sequencing of that sample generated 304 reads with coverage of 72% of the genome. these sequences shared 92 to 98% protein identity to seven segments of swine influenza D/OK virus. dRp ORF1b shared 71% protein identities of a bovine astrovirus recently identified in Hong Kong (Table 1). dRp ORF1b is most closely related to that of bovine astrovirus B34/HK (HQ916315), although with only 43% protein identity. seventy-nine sequences with an average of 82.36% nucleotide identity to bovine parvovirus 2 (AF406966) were identified. the sample positive for this genome was identified by PCR and individually deep sequenced. Virus detection rates in BRD cases versus controls Virus Viral family No. positive/total (% positive) P valuea Asymptomatic animals Animals with BRD Bovine adenovirus 3 Adenoviridae 5/50 (10) 24/50 (48) 0.0001* Bovine rhinitis A virus BSRI4 Picornaviridae 4/50 (8) 12/50 (24) 0.009* Bovine rhinitis B virus BSRI1 the asymptomatic group had one animal each positive for BSRI1 plus -3 and BSRI2. seven animals (14%) within the symptomatic group were positive for influenza D virus. none of the animals from the symptomatic group was found to be positive for the virus. bovine adenovirus 3 (P 0.0001), bovine rhinitis A virus (P = 0.005) and bovine influenza D virus (P = 0.006) were each associated with BRD. a high level of coinfections was also detected, with more than one virus in 38% of BRD cases versus 8% in controls. bovine adenovirus is highly seroprevalent in feedlot calves, with 50% of animals reported to seroconvert during the first month in feedlots. intratracheal inoculation of 4-months-old colostrum-deprived calves also induced fever and other symptoms. BRAV is one of four picornavirus species in the Aphthovirus genus. a single BRAV genome is currently available in GenBank (NC_010354) one nearly complete genome of bovine rhinitis A virus and two of bovine rhinitis B viruses were sequenced. humans (63) and animals (64), including cows, with neurological symptoms (29, 30), indicating their host range can extend beyond enteric tissues. a single infection was detected in a BRD animal coinfected with both bovine adenovirus 3 and astrovirus BSRI1. a viral metagenomics approach to characterize all viruses present can provide simple approach to the study of a complex infectious disease. five DNA viruses recently reported in a viral metagenomics study of beef (muscle tissue) were also not detected in these nasal secretions from animals with BRD. the mix of respiratory viruses infecting cattle may vary widely between herds, in different geographic regions, or when sampled during different years or even seasons."}
