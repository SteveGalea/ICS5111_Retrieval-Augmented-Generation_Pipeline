{"summary": "all positive-strand RNA viruses assemble in infected cells their replication complexes (RCs) in association with intracellular membranes [1],[2],[3],[4],[5]. membrane association may provide a shielded environment that prevents the activation of antiviral host cell responses. Brefeldin A (BFA) is a well known fungal metabolite that induces the redistribution of Golgi proteins into the ER [17],[18], effectively resulting in the block of transport though the secretory pathway [19],[20]. this drug inhibits the activation of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) small GTPases by targeting the large guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GBF1) and BIG (BFA poliovirus RNA replication was shown to be sensitive to BFA. RNA replication of encephalomyocarditis virus was not affected at all. other members of the picornavirus family appeared to differ in their sensitivity to BFA. LR7 cells were inoculated with a luciferase-expressing recombinant of MHV-A59 (MHV-EFLM) in the presence or absence of 5 g/ml BFA. after 1 h, the inoculum was removed and the cells were further incubated either in the presence or in the absence of BFA. LR7 cells were inoculated with MHV-2aFLS, transfected with synthetic RNA transcribed from pM5f-RL-M3 and incubated from 2\u20136 h p.i. in the presence or absence of 5 g/ml BFA. luciferase expression levels were determined in the cell lysates at 6 h p.i. the reduction in luciferase expression resulted from a corresponding decrease in viral RNA synthesis rather than from inhibition of viral protein translation. similar results were obtained when targeting the Taqman PCR to a different region of the viral genome. LR7 cells were infected at high multiplicity with the recombinant virus MHV-2aFLS. LR7 cells infected with MHV-EFLM were treated with BFA for overlapping 2 h periods. at the end of each incubation period the intracellular luciferase expression levels were determined and compared to those in mock-treated cells. the results showed that replication was affected throughout the course of the infection. cells were transfected with plasmids expressing YFP fusions of either wild type ARF1, ARF1-T31N or ARF1-Q71L. the percentage of RFP-positive cells in the YFP-expressing population was determined relative to that of the wild type ARF1 expressing cells. over-expression of the dominant-negative ARF1 mutant did not significantly affect MHV infection compared to non-transfected cells. LR7 cells were inoculated with MHV-A59 and treated with 5 g/ml BFA. immunostaining was performed using antibodies against nsp8 (anti-nsp8) and against the M protein (anti-M) at 7 h p.i., cells were fixed and an immunostaining was performed using nsp8 antibodies. the number and intensity of nsp8 foci were clearly reduced when compared to non-treated cells. we investigated whether these nsp8 foci represented MHV replication sites. the nsp8 foci recruited the nucleocapsid protein N, a protein previously shown to localize to the RCs. MHV-infected LR7 cells were inoculated with MHV-A59 and treated with or without 5 g/ml BFA from 1\u20136 h p.i. they were embedded in Epon resin in order to be analyzed by electron microscopy. morphology and dimensions of these vesicles were similar to those previously described for the DMVs harboring the RCs. in these cells, vesicles with a morphology almost identical to those present in non-treated cells were observed. however, the number of these DMVs was significantly decreased (p0.005) in BFA-treated cells as compared to non-treated cells. the reduction in the number of DMVs is likely to be an underestimation. lgi network (TGN) and the endocytic organelles in MDCK cells are still sensitive to BFA [54],[55],[56]. the results show that MHV replication was not affected by BFA treatment. the cells were infected with siRNAs directed against GBF1 or ARF1. at 72 h post transfection, the cells were infected with the luciferase-expressing MHV-2aFLS. six h later, the number of viable cells and luciferase expression levels were determined. 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) did not change the RII. siRNAs targeting firefly luciferase reduced the RII up to 95% (p0.05). similar results were obtained when the three siRNA oligos for each gene were singly transfected. cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting ARF1 and subsequently processed for immunofluorescence. the GM130 staining was indistinguishable from that in mock-treated cells. this is in complete accordance with the results of Volpicelli-Daley et al. [58]. nsp2-GFP expression was much more affected than that of nsp8 by depletion of either ARF1 or GBF1. nsp2-GFP expression was much more affected than that of nsp8 by the depletion of either ARF1 or GBF1. ARF1-YFP was predominantly localized to the Golgi apparatus. at 4 h p.i. and 7 h p.i., only in a minority of the cells co-localized. no co-localization could be observed in infected cells at 7 h p.i. a similar recruitment of COPI to the replication vesicles occurs during MHV replication. this recombinant virus allowed us to directly visualize the replication vesicles without having to perform an immunostaining with the anti-nsp8 antibodies. the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis using the COP antibody. MHV reduces but does not block protein secretion. LR7 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the Gaussia gene. at 4.5 h p.i. the intracellular and extracellular levels of Gaussia luciferase were measured. luciferase activity was determined both in the cell lysate and in the culture supernatant. the relative amount of luciferase present in the cell lysate is depicted. MHV genomic RNA replication is sensitive to BFA is known to disturb membrane traffic in most cell types, resulting in a redistribution of Golgi proteins into the ER. LR7 cells were inoculated with MHV-2aFLS or with Sindbis pseudovirus particles containing a luciferase replicon. at the end of each incubation period, virus replication was analyzed by determining the luciferase expression level (A and D) or the amount of viral genomic RNA (B) Sindbis virus replication was not affected by the BFA treatment. this result indicates that the observed effect of BFA on MHV-driven luciferase expression was not due to non-specific drug-induced toxicity. similar results were obtained when targeting the Taqman PCR to a different region of the viral genome. the results show that BFA treatment did not inhibit the synthesis of Renilla luciferase from the synthetic mRNA. firefly luciferase expression driven by the recombinant virus was severely affected. all together, these results indicate that BFA inhibits MHV RNA replication while translation of viral mRNAs is not affected. LR7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing YFP fusions of either wild type ARF1, ARF1-T31N or ARF1-Q71L. after transfection, the cells were inoculated with an RFP-expressing MHV-A59 recombinant (MHV-RFP) the percentage of RFP-positive cells in the YFP-expressing population was determined relative to that of the wild type ARF1 expressing cells the nsp8 antibody revealed the typical perinuclear staining pattern in both treated and non-treated cells. in contrast, a dispersed distribution of M protein was observed in BFA-treated cells reflecting the collapse of the Golgi. in non-treated cells the M protein showed a clear Golgi-like staining. arrows indicate nsp8-positive foci. nsp8 was added to LR7 cells directly after inoculation with MHV-A59. staining was performed at 6 h p.i using the nsp8 antibody. luciferase expression data shows that the nsp8 foci that had been formed in the presence of BFA correspond with the replication sites. this result demonstrates that BFA inhibits, but does not completely block, the formation of RCs. MHV-infected LR7 cells were fixed at 6 h p.i. and embedded in Epon resin. treatment of cells with BFA (1\u20136 h) led to the expected disappearance of an apparent Golgi complex with the concomitant expansion of the ER volume. in these cells, vesicles with a morphology almost identical to those present in non-treated cells were observed. however, the reduction in the number of DMVs is likely to be an underestimation as only EM sections were included in the analyses. MDCK cells have a BFA-resistant Golgi-apparatus due to a point mutation in GBF1. however, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the endocytic organelles in MDCK cells are still sensitive to BFA [54],[55],[56]. the graph shows the relative luciferase expression (RII) compared to mock-treated cells. at 24 h post transfection, the cells were fixed and the percentage of YFP-positive cells was determined. the results of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown. luciferase activity expressed relative to mock-treated cells. transfection of control siRNAs targeting the housekeeping protein glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) did not change the RII. siRNAs targeting firefly luciferase reduced the RII up to 95% (p0.05) Fig. 4C demonstrates that GBF1 and ARF1 expression are prohibited in the presence of their specific siRNAs. we analyzed whether inhibition of MHV replication coincided with a collapse of the Golgi complex as observed after BFA treatment. six hours after infection the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence with the nsp8 antibody. in mock transfected cells, many GFP and nsp8 positive foci were observed, which largely co-localized. nsp2-GFP expression was much more affected than that of nsp8 by the depletion of either ARF1 or GBF1. LR7 cells expressing wild type ARF1 fused to YFP were infected with MHV-A59 and fixed at an early (4 h) or a late (7 h) time point p.i. before identifying the replication sites by immunostaining the cells with nsp8 antibodies. a similar recruitment of COPI to the replication vesicles occurs during MHV replication. the recombinant virus allowed us to directly visualize the replication vesicles without having to perform an immunostaining with the anti-nsp8 antibodies. no co-localization between the RCs and PLD1b could be observed. specific inhibition of PLD by 1-butanol did not affect MHV luciferase expression compared to controls. MHV reduces but does not block protein secretion. LR7 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the Gaussia gene were at 1 h post transfection either infected with MHV-A59 or mock-infected or were treated with BFA. MHV requires a functional GBF1-ARF1 pathway for efficient RNA replication. we hypothesize that BFA inhibits MHV RNA replication by affecting RC maturation or functioning rather than RNA replication. two major steps in the protein secretion route are linked to MHV RC formation and/or RNA replication. a dominant-negative mutant of ARF1 is also involved in MHV RC formation. a fully functional secretory pathway is not essential, as a dominant-active mutant of ARF1 blocks transport between VTCs and cis-Golgi [49] does not impair MHV replication. picornaviruses belonging to different genera were found to differ in their sensitivity to BFA. coronavirus RCs did not co-localize with PLD1 nor was coronavirus replication affected by inhibition of phospholipase D. this may be because the GBF1-ARF1 pathway simply functions to deliver lipids to the RCs. a recent study showed that ARF1 depletion did not affect the morphology of the Golgi complex. avirus replication was inhibited when the ER export machinery was blocked by the use of the kinase inhibitor H89. this was not the case when the GBF1-mediated activation of ARF1 was impaired by BFA. further investigations are needed to unravel the precise mechanism by which the secretory pathway contributes to the biogenesis of functional coronavirus RCs. -21 cells stably expressing Sindbis virus structural proteins [75] were maintained in Glasgow MEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS, 100 IU of penicillin/ml, 100 g of streptomycin/ml, 250 g/ml G418 and 125 g/ml hygromycine B. the firefly luciferase gene was cloned into the pSinRep5 vector (invitrog pN-EGFP plasmid encodes MHV nucleocapsid (N) protein fused to YFP. pARF1T31N-YFP and pARF1Q71L-GFP encode wild type proteins fused to YFP. pN-EGFP plasmid was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment into pEGFP-N3. plasmid pM5f-RL-M3 was generated by cloning a synthetic DNA segment (Genscript) corresponding to the extreme 5' 211 nt and the extreme 3' 401 nt of the MHV-A59 genome. the coding region for Renilla luciferase, obtained from pRLnull, was cloned into the NheI-digested vector. sed and intracellular Renilla and firefly luciferase activity was measured with the dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega) the cells were fixed using a 4% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS. after several washing steps, the cells were incubated with an appropriate dilution of secondary antibody in the same buffer for RNA was isolated from the cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. the reactions were performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA duplexes targeting different sites within the coding sequences of GBF1, BIG1, BIG2 and ARF1 were designed by and obtained from Ambion Inc. each well was performed in triplicate. luciferase values were corrected for the cell number and viability. mRNA levels of each gene were determined after siRNA transfection. LR7 cells infected with MHV-A59 and treated from 1 to 6 h p.i. with or without 5 g/ml BFA were resuspended in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for at least 2 h at room temperature. cells were then centrifuged, washed 3 times with the 0.1 M cacodylate buffer before being post-fixed in 1% Os 5 g of methylnadic anhydride and 560 ml of benzyldimethylamine. the Epon resin was then replaced the following day with freshly made resin. 65\u201380 nm sections were then cut using an Ultracut E ultramicrotome. 57 cells stably expressing the MHV receptor mCEACAM1a were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Cambrex) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU of penicillin/ml, 100 g of streptomycin/ml, 250 g/ml G418 and 125 g/ml hygromycine B (Boehringer GmbH) fusion protein was cloned behind an additional transcription regulation sequence into a derivative of the RNA transcription vector pMH54 [74]. antibodies and plasmids Antibodies directed against the MHV nsp8 (anti-p22, kindly provided by M.
