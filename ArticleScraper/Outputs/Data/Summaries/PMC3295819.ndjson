{"summary": "the natural history of pediatric dengue early in illness in a community-based setting has not been well-defined. tens of millions of dengue cases and approximately 500,000 life-threatening complications occur annually. most cases present as classic dengue fever (DF), a debilitating but self-limited illness that manifests with high fever, retro-orbital pain, severe myalgia/arthralgia, and rash. in some cases, children, illness progresses to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), characterized by vascular leakage leading to hypovolemic shock and a case fatality rate up to new tools are therefore needed to distinguish dengue from OFIs. new tools are therefore needed to prevent deaths from severe dengue. results were not consistent across studies. study activity was based in the health center S\u00f3crates Flores Vivas. participants aged 2\u20139 years were recruited through house-to-house visits. children were eligible to remain in the study until age 12 or until they moved from the study area. parents/legal guardians of all subjects provided written informed consent. study physicians in both the hospital and HCSFV completed systematic data collection forms that contained approximately 80 variables. additional clinical data, including fluid balance and treatment, were collected daily during hospitalization or through ambulatory follow-up visits by a team of study physicians and nurses. fever or history of acute fever lasting 2\u20137 days Hemorrhagic manifestations (positive tourniquet test; petechiae, equimosis, purpura or bleeding from mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, injection sites or other locations) Thrombocytopenia (100,000 platelets/mm3) Evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) dengue classification A case was considered laboratory-confirmed dengue when acute DENV infection was demonstrated by: detection of DENV RNA by RT-PCR; isolation of DENV; seroconversion of DENV-specific IgM antibodies observed by MAC-ELISA. laboratory-confirmed dengue cases were further classified by severity. the frequency of dengue testing results was examined by year, demographics, serotype and immune response. the frequency of the WHO case definition for suspected dengue was examined by dengue testing results and age, and a chi-square test for trend was performed. study activity was based in the health center S\u00f3crates Flores Vivas (HCSFV), a public facility that is the primary source of health care for district II residents. participants aged 2\u20139 years were recruited through house-to-house visits, and additional two year-olds were enrolled each year. study physicians in both the hospital and HCSFV completed systematic data collection forms that contained approximately 80 variables. additional clinical data, including fluid balance and treatment, were collected daily during hospitalization or through ambulatory follow-up visits by a team of study physicians and nurses. data were recorded on medical tests ordered and treatments prescribed. thrombocytopenia (100,000 platelets/mm3) Evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) a DHF with hypotension for age or narrow pulse pressure (20 mmHg) plus one of the following: rapid and weak pulse Dengue with compensated shock (DFCS) a DF with poor capillary refill (>2 sec) plus one of the following on the same day. a case was considered laboratory-confirmed dengue when acute DENV infection was demonstrated by detection of DENV RNA by RT-PCR; isolation of DENV; seroconversion of DENV-specific IgM antibodies observed by MAC-ELISA in paired acute and convalescent-phase samples. a 4-fold increase in anti-DENV antibody titer measured using Inhibition ELISA. only data from days 1\u20138 of illness were included for analysis. the frequency of dengue testing results was examined by year, demographics, serotype and immune response. the frequency of the WHO case definition for suspected dengue was examined by dengue testing results and age. nearly all (95%) of severe dengue cases but only 116 (72%) met the WHO case definition for dengue. median age for cases meeting the dengue case definition was 8 years (range 2\u201313) and that of undifferentiated febrile illness due to DENV infection was 6 years (range 2\u201310). 60% of severe dengue cases were DENV-2, followed by DENV-3 (25%) and DENV-1 (10%). the median day of illness at presentation was day 2 for all patients. median follow-up time of all children in the cohort was 3.9 years per child. deNV, dengue virus; OFI, other febrile illness; DF, dengue fever; Severe dengue = dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS), dengue with signs associated with shock (DFCS). a Includes 9 DHF, 4 DSS, 3 DSAS, and 4 DFCS cases. OFI versus DF: chi-square test for trend 14.928, p = 0.0001; day 1, n = 606; day 2, n = 1,243; day 3, n = 1,066; day 3, n = 1,066; day 4, n = 876; day 5, n = 675; day 5, n = 675; day 6, n = 481; day 7, n = 175; day 8, n = 175; day 8, n = 175 chi-square tests for trend comparing DF to severe dengue were non-significant. OFI, other febrile illness; DF, dengue fever; Severe dengue = dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome, dengue with signs associated with shock. on all days of illness, dengue-positive cases had increased odds of the same signs and symptoms as on days 1\u20133 of illness. however, the magnitude of the point estimates tended to be higher. this difference was most pronounced for rash and platelets 150,000 cells/mm3, which had ORs approximately double in magnitude.
