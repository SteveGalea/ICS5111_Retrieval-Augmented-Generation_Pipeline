{"summary": "KD is characterized by clinical manifestations including fever persisting for 5 days or more, swelling of the cervical lymph nodes, conjunctival infection, changes in oral mucosa and the tongue, skin rash, and redness of the palms and soles of the feet (1, 2). at least 14 species of the virus have been reported to be relevant to KD. this has led to speculation that viral infection may underlie KD pathogenesis. adenoviral infection exhibits seasonal pattern and some symptoms similar to that of KD (18, 19). putative RNA-Associated Virus Immunoglobulin A (IgA)-producing plasma cells are observed in the affected arterial tissue of KD patients. it was detected using synthetic antibodies generated from the alpha and kappa chain-encoding DNA sequences, which were cloned from the affected arterial tissue of KD patients. previous studies suggest that the involvement of viruses in KD is still very controversial. ohydrolase (dUTPase), an EBV-encoded protein, stimulates monocyte-derived macrophages through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent signaling (15) this up-regulates the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (15), which activates endothelial cells (ECs) and platelets. adenovirus It has been known that adenoviral infection exhibits seasonal pattern and some symptoms similar to that a representative INF-alpha2a/gamma-inducible protein was recently reported as a promising biomarker for the early acute phase of KD (29). these two studies raise the possibility that KD pathogenesis might be associated with a common immune response to viral infections. ECs express MHC-II and co-stimulators, TSST-1 activates human umbilical vein ECs in vitro in the presence of T cells (34). the number of V2-/V6.5-bearing T-cell subsets and anti-SPEC antibodies are increased in the peripheral blood of acute KD patients. increase in cTfh2 and IL-4 are observed in IgG4-RD. despite the foregoing evidence, the involvement of SAgs in KD has not been confirmed. some studies have independently found no significant elevation of antibodies against S. aureus or S. pyogenes-derived SAgs. mycobacterium Reactivation of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin scar is a well-established clinical manifestation in acute KD. antibody and CD4+/CD8+ T-cell clones specific to mycobacterium heat shock protein 65 have been detected in KD patients. non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can cause self-limited infections in humans. possible Triggers and Diagnostic Criteria of Kawasaki disease except Y. pseudotuberculosis infection (65, 74, 75), few cases satisfy the six diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease (KD) Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C selectively activates V2-/V6.5-bearing T-cell subsets and anti-SPEC antibody levels. the number of V2-/V6.5-bearing T-cell subsets and anti-SPEC antibody levels are increased in the peripheral blood of acute KD patients. some studies have independently found no significant elevation of antibodies against S. aureus or S. pyogenes-derived SAgs in KD patients. some species of YP produce YP-derived mitogens (YPM), which are SAg-like virulence factors (63). mycobacteria have not been isolated from KD patients as a causal pathogen. antibody and CD4+/CD8+ T-cell clones specific to mycobacterium heat shock protein 65 have been detected in KD patients. non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can cause self-limited infections in humans. ric winds containing Candida species as a predominant fungus suggested the implication of westerly wind-associated fungi in KD (73). it might be possible to validate phlogogenic activity of the wind-blown microbes / molecules with established animal models for KD. KD-like vasculitis can be induced in rabbit, swine, and mouse models. known genetic background and ease of genetic manipulation have made mouse models preferred model to investigate molecular pathogenesis of KD. the experimental model of vasculitis reportedly underlies the interaction between the CCR2 expressed in monocytes and the CCL2 induced by the NOD1-dependent signaling in EC (78). it is important to consider whether these models accurately represent the actual molecular mechanisms of KD (97). however, some evidences indicate that the experimental murine vasculitis is relevant to KD pathogenesis. killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) expressed in natural killer cells interacts with HLA-I to suppress activation of NK cells. killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) also recognizes and KIR3DL2 engulfs pathogen-derived CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) to activate TLR9-dependent signaling. the lectin pathway is triggered by activation of mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteinases (MASPs) the lectin pathway is triggered by activation of mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteinases (MASPs) a variety of microbes or virus-derived biomolecules can stimulate immune cells or other cell types, including ECs. in a murine model of vasculitis, Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS) is used as the inducer. inflammatory change is observed in the aortic root, including the coronary arteries in CAWS-treated mice (89, 90) Sensitivity and severity of CAWS-induced vasculitis apparently depend on mouse strain. ms in the CCR3-CCR2-CCR5 gene cluster are associated with KD susceptibility (99) lipophilic substances almost identical to MAMPs derived from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and S. aureus, have been detected in the serum of KD patients. this finding supports the possibility that KD underlies the molecular pathogenesis similar to the aforementioned mouse models. a recent case-control study of HLA-A and -B genotypes in Caucasian KD patients proposed the hypothesis that high abundance of HLA ligands for KIR3DL1/2 interferes with KIR-dependent cellular CpG-ODN sensing to impair effective clearance of pathogens during infection. this impaired clearance might allow expansion of PAMPs/MAMPs. genetic polymorphisms of these proteins might affect susceptibility of KD. prevalence of KD in children is potentially limited. a series of clinical genetic investigations have revealed KD-related gene polymorphisms in more than 20 genes. genetic background of infected children affects the magnitude of the immune responses to develop KD in a limited number of children. several infectious agents produce superantigens (SAgs) and pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) complement pathways can elicit inflammatory vascular damage through recruitment of innate inflammatory cells and direct injury to ECs. extent of inflammatory reaction is influenced by genetic backgrounds of individuals. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
