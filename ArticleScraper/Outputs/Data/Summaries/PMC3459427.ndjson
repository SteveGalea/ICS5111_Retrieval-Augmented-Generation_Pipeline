{"summary": "dengue fever (DF) is a vector-borne infectious disease transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquito. it is caused by four different serotypes of dengue virus (DENV 1\u20134), members of the family Flaviviridae. this rapidly-spreading mosquito-borne viral infection manifests in severe forms, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) analysis of the blood proteome is an effective approach to decipher disease pathogenesis and the host immune response in dengue virus infections. the overall pathobiology of this disease remains unexplored. dengue infection is diagnosed by using dengue-specific IgM antibody. emerging molecular diagnostic methods, viral isolation, or PCR, are effective for early diagnosis of dengue infection, but these techniques are expensive and time-consuming. the establishment of early detection surrogates can help meet the need for less expensive and better diagnostics and more effective therapy. blood samples were collected in the defervescent stage from DF patients with 2\u20135 days of fever. patients were categorized as DF according to the WHO severity grading scale. all subjects were aged 20\u201350 years. analysis for relative protein quantification across all the dengue, malaria, and control samples was performed using ImageMaster 2D Platinum 7.0 DIGE software (GE Healthcare) in-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry The identity of differentially-expressed proteins was established using an AB Sciex 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA) mass spectrometer. Western blotting was performed using monoclonal/polyclonal antibodies against clusterin (sc-8354), hemopexin (sc-134443), and haptoglobin (sc-71207; all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) imageQuant software version 5.0 (GE Healthcare) was used for quantitation of signal intensity of the bands in the Western blots. DF were categorized as DF according to the WHO severity grading scale (Dengue hemorrhagic fever: diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control; World Health Organization, 1997). blood specimens were collected from age- and sex-matched falciparum malaria patients (n=8) as febrile disease controls, and healthy subjects (n=8) to perform comparative proteomic analysis. the combined MS and MS/MS peak lists were searched using GPSTM Explorer software version 3.6 (AB Sciex) the combined MS and MS/MS peak lists were searched using the MASCOT version 2.1 (http://www.martixscience.com) search engine against the Swiss-Prot database. protein networks and functional analysis Functional pathway analysis was performed with the serum proteins showing altered expression levels in the DF patients using the protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) system, version 7 (http://www.pantherdb.org; Thomas et al., 2006), and the database for annotation visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) the 26 protein spots identified by MS correspond to 18 unique differentially-expressed proteins (Table 1, Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1; see online supplementary material at http://www.liebertonline.com). some of our identified differentially-expressed proteins such as apolipoprotein A-IV, complement C3, clusterin, and 1-antichymotrypsin were found to be consistent with an earlier plasma proteomic study performed on severe DF patients.

NS1/Clu interaction may lead to plasma leakage associated with DV infections. the dengue fever patients analyzed in this proteomic study were suffering from primary infection, without any hemorrhagic phenomena (DHF) or shock (DSS) further investigation of the modulation of the coagulation system and its associated plasma/serum proteins in dengue hemorrhagic fever could provide interesting insights into the disease's pathogenesis. the first study demonstrating human serum proteome alterations in DF in an Indian population. altered serum levels of serum amyloid P, haptoglobin, complement factors C4 and H, hemopexin, protein C6 orf165, and kininogen precursor, have not been reported in previous proteomics studies. supplemental data Supp_Table5.2.pdf (38KB, pdf) Supplemental data Supp_Fig3.pdf (43.5KB, pdf) Acknowledgments We acknowledge the support of Dr. Urmila Thatte, Dr. Nithya Gogtay, Dr. Santosh Taur and Tulip Jhaveri."}
