{"summary": "EV71 is a common etiological agent of hand, foot and mouth disease. the genetic information of EV71 strains circulating in our locality is limited. a distinct lineage of EV71 subgenotype C2 has emerged in Hong Kong in 2008. EV71 strains of \u201cgenotype D\u201d have been circulating in the Netherlands for over 7 years, with \u201cgenotype D1b\u201d being predominant. a research group has proposed a novel subgenotype B0 of EV71 that was circulating in the Netherlands from 1963 to 1967. occurrence of intratypic and intertypic recombination events in EV71 has been reported during EV71 epidemics in Asian countries since the late 1990s [15,14]. a study from Taiwan revealed that intratypic recombination between EV71 genotypes B and C has taken place in one EV71 isolate N3340-TW-02 [18]. in china, intertypic recombination between EV71 subgenotype C2 and coxsacki in EV71 of subgenotype C4 (proposed genotype D), we performed complete genome sequencing on eight EV71 strains and complete VP1 gene sequencing on 22 EV71 isolates in Hong Kong. most patients were young children who presented with HFMD without any complications. most patients were young children (median age 3 years, range from 9 months to 32 years) who presented with HFMD without any complications. RT-PCR and sequencing of partial VP2-VP3, 2C and 3D gene regions of EV71 from the 22 viral isolates were amplified and sequenced. 20 isolates were clustered with EV71 subgenotype C4 strains and 2 were closely related to EV71 subgenotype C2 strains. incongruent phylogenetic relationships observed among different partial gene regions of our 20 EV71 subgenotype C4 strains suggest that these strains belong to a newly proposed genotype D. the results showed that except the two EV71 strains belonging to subgenotype C2, all EV71 strains from Hong Kong during 2004\u20132010 included in this study belonged to subgenotype C4 (proposed genotype D) EV71 isolates of subgenotype C4 (proposed genotype D) and those of subgenotype C2 respectively from Hong Kong were selected for complete genome sequencing. the sizes of the genomes of the eight EV71 strains ranged from 7404 to 7409 nucleotides. their genome organization was typical of Enterovirus. phylogenetic trees of 5'UTR, P1, P2 and P3 regions of EV71 and CVA16 strains with complete genome sequences. trees were inferred from 5\u2032UTR (A), P1 (B), P2 (C) and P3 (D) region data by ML method. the region upstream of 2A-2B junction of the strain V10-2234054 was most closely related to a genotype C strain, but the region beyond the breakpoint at 3C shared higher similarity with CVA16 strain G-10. similar recombination patterns were also observed in other 6 EV71 \u201cgenotype D\u201d strains in Hong Kong. 71 strains, 18 belonged to subgenotype C4a (proposed genotype D1b), while 2 belonged to subgenotype C4b (proposed genotype D1a) a nucleotide divergence of 5.9-9.3% was observed between \u201cgenotype D1a\u201d and \u201cgenotype D1b\u201d strains from Hong Kong. tMRCA for EV71 genotypes was estimated at 1905 (HPDs, 1858 to 1943), 105 years ago; that of genotype B and C at 1925 (HPDs, 1895 to 1951), 85 years ago; that of genotype B at 1953 (HPDs, 1942 to 1963), 43 years ago; and that of genotype C at 1972 (HPDs, 1960 to 1982), 38 years ago. EV71 isolates were detected from 17 stool, 2 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), 2 throat swab and 1 rectal swab samples of 22 patients in Hong Kong. most patients were young children who presented with HFMD without any complications. ten were males and 12 were females. RT-PCR and sequencing of partial VP2-VP3, 2C and 3D gene regions of EV71 from the 22 viral isolates were amplified and sequenced. the 20 EV71 subgenotype C4 strains were clustered with EV71 subgenotype C4 strains and 2 were closely related to EV71 subgenotype C2 strains. the two EV71 subgenotype C2 strains, V08-2231530 and V08-2236079, were clustered with other subgenotype C2 strains for partial 2C and 3D regions. the result showed that except the two EV71 strains belonging to subgenotype C2, all EV71 strains from Hong Kong during 2004\u20132010 included in this study belonged to subgenotype C4 (proposed genotype D) the sizes of the genomes of the eight EV71 strains ranged from 7404 to 7409 nucleotides, with G + C content of 47.5 to 48.6%. the complete genome sequences of the 7 \u201cgenotype D\u201d strains were highly similar, with the nucleotide sequence identities of 92.7-98.3%. phylogenetic trees using nucleotide sequences of 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR), P1 (VP4 to trees were inferred from 5\u2032UTR (A), P1 (B), P2 (C) and P3 (D) regions. sequences for 751 nucleotide positions in each 5\u2032UTR, 2586 nucleotide positions in each P1 region, 1734 nucleotide positions in each P2 region and 2259 nucleotide positions in each P3 region were included in the analysis. similar recombination patterns were also observed in other 6 EV71 strains in Hong Kong. the above findings suggest that all EV71 strains from Hong Kong in this study belonged to the double recombinant \u201cgenotype D\u201d. similarity plot (upper panel) and bootscan analysis (lower panel) were conducted with SimPlot version 3.5.1. the nucleotide divergence of the subgenotype C4 strains is 8.1-14%. that of the subgenotype C4 strains is 14.8-18.2% when compared to EV71 genotype B strains. the tree was constructed using ML method, with bootstrap values calculated from 1000 trees. the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of all EV71 genotypes A, B and C was estimated at 1905 (HPDs, 1858 to 1943), 105 years ago. the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of all EV71 genotypes A, B and C was estimated at 1905 (HPDs, 1858 to 1943), 105 years ago. a mosaic of incongruent patterns for EV71 were likely due to the independent evolutionary pathways of the two genome regions of EV71. VP1 gene sequence mainly provides information on the serotype of EV71 and encompasses only about one-tenth of the entire genome. a combination of VP1 and 3D gene sequences was proposed to be used for initial genotyping of EV71 isolates in the absence of complete genome sequences. a combination of VP1 and 3D gene sequences was proposed to be used for initial genotyping of EV71 isolates in the absence of complete genome sequences. EV71 strains have been persistently circulating in Hong Kong. 20 belonged to \u201cgenotype D\u201d and two belonged to subgenotype C2. this is consistent with an epidemiological study showing that \u201cgenotype D\u201d was the major type of EV71 in our locality over the 7-year period. a high degree of conservation in the immunogenic VP1 protein of the 20 \u201cgenotype D\u201d strains raises the possibility of developing a vaccine against this predominant genotype in Hong Kong and mainland China. a distinct lineage of EV71 subgenotype C4 strains in Hong Kong have been stably evolving during 2004\u20132010. two EV71 strains from Hong Kong, V08-2231530 and V08-2236079, detected in 2008 shared a high nucleotide sequence identity with other subgenotype C2 strains in recent years (2006\u20132008) this was in line with the result of a study showing that recent subgenotype C2 strains from the Netherlands and the united kingdom formed a clade distinct from a group of \u201cold\u201d strains detected in the 1990s. diversity and no recombination has been mapped within VP1 gene [41], while recombination within 5'UTR, P2 and P3 regions is frequent in EV71 [15,17,22]. the evolutionary rate of EV71 was 3.1 10-3 s/s/y comparable to that of other enterovirus, such as EV68 (4.93 10-3 s/s/y) [42]. EV71 strains of \u201cgenotype D\u201d have been persistently circulating in Hong Kong over a decade. a distinct lineage of subgenotype C2 strains has emerged in 2008. molecular surveillance is crucial for detecting genetic changes in EV71 and preventing outbreaks due to emergence of new viruses. RNA extraction Viral RNA was extracted from the EV71 isolates using EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) the RNA was eluted in 60 l of AVE buffer and was used as the template for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) the RNA was converted to cDNA by a combined random-priming and oligo(dT) priming strategy. sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce final sequences of the viral genomes. nucleotide sequences of the genomes and the deduced amino acid sequences of the single open reading frame (ORF) were compared to those of EV71 strains with available sequences in GenBank. the PCR mixture (25 l) contained DNA, iProof High-fidelity PCR buffer (Bio-Rad), 200 M of each dNTP and 0.5 U iProof High-fidelity DNA polymerase (Bio-Rad) the mixtures were amplified by using 40 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 50 s, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. complete genome sequences of the eight EV71 strains and the complete VP1 gene sequences of 22 EV71 strains have been deposited in the GenBank database. EV71 strains Among EV71 strains positive in clinical specimens during 2004\u20132010 in Hong Kong, two to five strains from the peak season of HFMD (April-June; one selected randomly from each month) for each year were selected. twenty two EV71 strains detected from throat and rectal sw Phylogenetic trees of each region were constructed using maximum likelihood (ML) method in MEGA5 with the best models K2+G for partial VP2-VP3, K2+G+I for partial 2C and TN93+G for partial 3D [47]. robustness of branches was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. complete genome sequencing of EV71 The genomes of eight EV71 strains (Table 1) were amplified and sequenced using the strategy described in our previous publications [10 a nucleotide alignment of the genome sequences of our EV71 strains was performed using a nucleotide alignment of the genome sequences of our EV71 strains. EV71 genotype A prototype strain BrCr (GenBank accession no. U22521), EV71 genotype B strain Nagoya (GenBank accession no. AB482183), EV71 genotype C strain 4643-TW98 (GenBank accession no. AB s A, B and C were calculated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach as implemented in BEAST (Version 1.7.4). MCMC analysis was run for 2 108 generations and sampled every 1000 steps. tMRCA and highest posterior density regions at 95% were calculated. authors\u2019 contributions CCYY, SKPL, PCYW and KYY designed the study. authors declare that they have no competing interest. the nucleotides in EV71 genotype B that are the same as those in EV71 strain V10-2234054 but different from those in CVA16 strain G-10 are highlighted in grey. the predicted breakpoint position by bootscan analysis is indicated by an arrow."}
