{"summary": "in Portugal, RSV cases are detected through the ISS using the European Union (EU) influenza-like illness case definition. three case definitions (EU ILI, a modified EU acute respiratory infection, and one respiratory symptom) performed in detecting RSV infections in Portugal. human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. it is the predominant viral agent affecting the respiratory tract, causing acute, sometimes fatal lower respiratory tract infections in infants, young children and the elderly. the global burden of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection has been estimated at 33.1 million annually. a broader ARI case definition has been considered to be more suitable for capturing RSV infections. the EU ILI case definition includes sudden onset of symptoms, at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath) and at least one systemic symptom (fever or feverishness, malaise, headache or myalgia) the sentinel ISS sends nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza and other respiratory viruses diagnosis to INSA. the non-sentinel component of the ISS is formed by the Portuguese Laboratory Network for the Diagnosis of Influenza Infection (PLNDII) it is coordinated by the Portuguese laboratory network for the Diagnosis of Influenza Infection (PLNDII) case definitions tested The EU ILI case definition is used in the sentinel ISS. ARI-like and only one respiratory symptom were created based on clinical characteristics. coryza and the clinician\u2019s judgement were not included in the ARI-like case definition because they were not collected in the Portuguese Influenza Surveillance System. data analysis Retrospective analyses were performed on individuals included in the study. the sentinel ISS weekly reports demographic, clinical and laboratory data of individuals tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses. the influenza season comprises the period between week 40 (October) and week 20 (May) of the next year. the non-sentinel component of the ISS is formed by the Portuguese Laboratory Network for the Diagnosis of Influenza Infection (PLNDII) RSV detection was performed using real-time PCR as previously described by Gunson et al. [17], with a slight modification of cycling conditions (30 min at 50 \u00b0C, 2 min at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 8 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min) case definitions tested The EU case definition is used in the sentinel ISS. coryza and the clinician\u2019s judgement were not included in the ARI-like case definition because they were not collected in the Portuguese Influenza Surveillance System. data analysis Retrospective analyses were performed on data from individuals included in the study. female\u2013male ratio was 1.36:1 among 6,523 patients included in the study. 66.3% (n = 4,322) were laboratory-confirmed for any respiratory virus. observed frequencies were higher than those expected if respiratory virus infection and age were independent among children aged 5 years (154.0 vs 118.9) and 5\u201314 years (444.0 vs 393.8) n % n % Age group in years 0\u20134c (n = 171) 23 12.6 148 2.4 5\u201314 (n = 585) 8 4.4 577 9.3 15\u201364 (n = 4,652) 107 58.5 4,545 73.6 65c (n = 951) 45 24.6 906 14.7 Total (n = 6,359) 183 100.0 6,176 100.0 Sex Male (n = 2,698) 66 35.1 2,632 42.1 Female (n adults 65 years old did not show any significant clinical predictor. shortness of breath was more likely in RSV-positive cases aged 14 years.
