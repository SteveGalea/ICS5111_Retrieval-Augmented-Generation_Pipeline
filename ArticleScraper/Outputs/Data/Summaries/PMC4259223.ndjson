{"summary": "both serotypes occur in two pathotypes: Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) FECV replicates in macrophages/monocytes leading to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly lethal systemic granulomatous disease of wild and domestic cats. FIPV contains a single-stranded positive-sense polyadenylated RNA genome. it encodes two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) which need to be processed into 16 non\u00adstructural proteins (nsp1\u201316) for genome replication. the critical role of nsp5 in virus replication makes it an ideal target for anti-FIPV drug design. the coding sequence for FIPV main protease was synthesized and cloned into the vector pGEX-6P-1 using the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. the recombinant plasmid was verified by sequencing and then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. cultures were grown in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml1 ampicillin at 310 K until the optical density at 600 the protease was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg ml1 for proteolysis in PBS. five additional residues (GPLGS) were left at the N-terminus of FIPV main protease. the protein of interest was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography. purified protein was supplemented with 10% DMSO and concentrated to 1 mg ml1 for crystallization. the previously reported inhibitor N3 was added to the purified protein to give a molar ratio of between 3:1 and 5:1. crystallization drops were carefully set up by mixing 1.0 l protein solution with 1.0 l reservoir solution. initial crystals of FIPV main protease in complex with N3 inhibitor were obtained after 24 h under condition No. 45 from Crystal Screen. a complete data set was collected from a single crystal which diffracted to 2.5 resolution. all intensity data were indexed, integrated and scaled with HKL-2000 package. values in parentheses are for the outer shell. the coding sequence for FIPV main protease was synthesized and cloned into the vector pGEX-6P-1 using the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. the recombinant plasmid was verified by sequencing and then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. resulting protein of interest was purified by anion-exchange chromatography. resulting protein of interest was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a hiTrap Q column. purified protein was immediately supplemented with 10% DMSO and concentrated to 1 mg ml1. the previously reported inhibitor N3 was added to the purified protein to give a molar ratio of between 3:1 and 5:1. initial crystals of FIPV main protease in complex with N3 inhibitor obtained after 24 h. crystals were cryoprotected in a solution consisting of 0.2m zinc acetate dihydrate, 0.1m sodium cacodylate trihydrate pH 6.5, 18%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. all intensity data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the HKL-2000 package. results and discussion FIP, which is caused by FIPV, is a lethal systemic systemic. granulomatous disease of cats around the world. however, upon virus infection the induced antibodies further enhance the infection instead of neutralizing the virus. thus, no clinical vaccines against FIPV have been successfully developed to date. further structural and biochemical analysis of FIPV main protease in complex with the Michael acceptor N3 will lead to better design and optimization of antivirals against FIP."}
