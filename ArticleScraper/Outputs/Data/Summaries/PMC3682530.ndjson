{"summary": "innate immune system must recognize signatures of pathogen infection. initiating a wide variety of anti-pathogen responses may give an organism the greatest chance to contain an infection. type I IFNs (IFN-/) are major antiviral cytokines. IFITM1, -2, and -3 restrict the cell entry of influenza A, flaviviruses, dengue virus, west Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and filoviruses. the IFITM proteins restrict viruses independent of receptor usage but are dependent upon processes that occur in late endosomes. the dissociated fragment 1N allow for conformational changes and subsequent membrane association of the viral capsid that mediates penetration of the viral core into the cytoplasm (23, 26). reovirus particles traverse a number of endocytic compartments, but correct targeting to late endosomes containing Rab7 and Rab9 is crucial for establishing a productive infection. glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B. rsT3D-1T249I isogenic to T3D with the exception of a single amino acid substitution in the 1 protein rendering it insensitive to protease cleavage. purified reovirus virions were generated using second or third passage L-cell lysates of twice-plaque-pur guinea pig anti-reovirus NS and rabbit anti-T3D antisera were generously provided by Dr. Terence S.

RESULTS IFITM3 restricts entry of enveloped viruses that require acid pH or endosomal components for membrane fusion. IFITM3-expressing and control cell lines were adsorbed with reovirus strains T1L and T3D at various m.o.i. the percentage of infected cells was determined at 18 h post-infection by immunostaining using an anti-reovirus NS antiserum. similar results were obtained using an A549 cell line engineered to express IFITM3. the percentage of infected cells was determined by fluorescent focus assay 18 h post-infection. Error bars indicate S.D. *, p 0.05 by Student's t test in comparison with vector control cells. we first measured IFITM3 RNA levels in HeLa cells after infection. cells were mock-infected or infected with T3D at an m.o.i. of 100 pfu/cell. levels of IFITM3 mRNA were quantified by using qPCR. cells expressing shIFITM3 were significantly less sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN in comparison to control cells. IFN treatment reduced the percent of infected cells by 60\u201380% in control cells and by 10\u201320% in shIFITM3-expressing cells. no significant difference was observed in the percentage of infected control- and shIFITM3-expressing cells in the absence of IFN (p = 0.12) vector control- or shIFITM3-expressing cells were either mock-treated or treated with IFN- (100 IU/ml) for 6 h. cells were then infected with TIL or T3D at an m.o.i. of 10 pfu/cell. control- or IFITM3-expressing cells were infected with either rsT3D-1T249I virions or ISVPs. ammonium chloride treatment reduced the infectivity of virions by 80%. in contrast, ammonium chloride had no effect on the entry of ISVPs. productive reovirus entry occurs in late endosomes that colocalize with specific Rab GTPases such as Rab7 and RILP (27). control- or IFITM3-expressing HeLa cells were transfected with Rab7-EGFP or RILP-EGFP, which localize to late endosomes. at 18 h post-transfection, cells were chilled at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. cells were imaged by confocal microscopy. insets depict enlarged areas of boxed regions. scale bars, 10 m. B and C, shown is quantification of colocalization of reovirus-A546 particles with EGFP-tagged versions of Rab7 (B and RILP) rsT3D escaped ammonium chloride blockade around 30 min earlier (p 0.05) in control cells than in IFITM3-expressing cells. IFITM3 expression delays the kinetics of reovirus escape from ammonium chloride treatment. IFITM3 delays kinetics of reovirus particle entry into acidified endosomal compartments. vector control- or IFITM3-expressing cells were adsorbed with 10,000 particles/cell of reovirus-pHrodo at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for the times shown. IFITM3 expression delays reovirus outer capsid cleavage. cells were washed 2 times with PBS, pelleted at 3000 g, and resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. cell entry represents a very attractive target, as all viruses require some mechanism to penetrate into a host cell either at the cell surface, via endosomes, or via other cell transport events. many viruses require the use of endosomal compartments for proteolytic cleavage or pH-dependent conformational changes necessary for membrane fusion or penetration. the precise mechanism of action for IFITM3 is not fully understood. IFN treatment or IFITM3 expression expands late endosomal and autolysosomal compartments (14, 49), indicative of changes in the activity of these structures. changes could alter the rate of acidification of endosomes before delivery of the components to lysosomes, influence cathepsin activity. a previous study indicated that particles that do not efficiently penetrate endosomes localize to lysosomes (23). we cannot exclude the possibility that IFITM3 also alters the properties of endosomal membranes to prevent membrane penetration. alterations in this region of the protein also affect sensitivity to IFITM3. many nonenveloped viruses require access to endosomal compartments for membrane penetration. however, the precise endosomal dynamics required for these viruses to penetrate membranes differ."}
