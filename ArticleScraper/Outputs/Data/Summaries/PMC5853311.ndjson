{"summary": "HCoV strains were identified using strain-specific PCR. shedding duration was defined as time between first positive and first negative sample. logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors for prolonged shedding (21 days) the first cohort included patients whose nasal samples were collected and tested for clinical purposes when respiratory symptoms were present from March 2009 through June 2016. the second cohort came from a prospective surveillance study of HCT recipients undergoing transplant from December 2005 and February 2010. prolonged shedding defined as the duration of shedding 21 days. highest daily steroid dose and lowest cell count in the 2 weeks prior to first HCoV detection were recorded. only subjects with respiratory symptoms were selected for the current study. mNGS was conducted when 4 positive samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values of 28 were available irrespective of presence of respiratory symptoms from the above-mentioned prospective surveillance study. only the first episode of HCoV infection per subject was used for the outcome analyses. two-sided P values.05 were considered statistically significant. all statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 for Windows. coronavirus strains OC43 11 (25) 3 (18) 8 (30) NL63 10 (23) 5 (29) 5 (19) 229E 4 (9) 2 (12) 2 (7) HKU1 6 (14) 2 (12) 4 (15) Unknown 13 (30) 5 (29) 8 (30) Ct value, median (range) 28.3 (19.2\u201339.4) 28.8 (19.6\u201339.4) Lowest WBC count 1000 106 cells/La 14/36 (39) 3/15 (20) the bars indicate median values and first and third quartiles (P =.79 by Kruskal-Wallis test) Outcome Analyses Initial high viral load (Ct value below the median) was associated with prolonged shedding with the lowest P value (.01) by univariable analysis. four patients started viral shedding prior to transplant. lowest WBC countb (106 cells/L) 1.0 vs 1.0 0.23 (.05\u20131.05).06 0.33 (.06\u20131.7).18 Lowest neutrophil countb (106 cells/L) 0.5 vs 0.5 0.28 (.06\u20131.3).10 0.37 (.07\u20131.9) no single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OC43 and HKU1 were recovered in patients 4 and 5 respectively. one adult patient developed lower respiratory tract disease during prolonged shedding. one 18-year-old pediatric patient (patient 4) had 3 different HCoV strains detected in succession over a period of 5 months. patients 4 and 5 showed no variants over time for the same coronavirus species. both nonsynonymous and synonymous variants are depicted relative to the day 0 genome recovered. allele frequencies for variant sites are depicted when the majority allele had 95% frequency. consensus base is not a variant relative to the day 0 genome. majority allele frequency at that base is 95% (in flux). median duration of shedding was 14 days (4\u201360 days) and 17 patients had prolonged shedding (21 days) OC43 11 (25) 3 (18) 8 (30) NL63 10 (23) 5 (29) 5 (19) 229E 4 (9) 2 (12) 2 (7) HKU1 6 (14) 2 (12) 4 (15) Unknown 13 (30) 5 (29) 8 (30) Ct value, median (range) 28.3 (19.2\u201339.4) 28.8 (19.6\u201339.4) Lowest WBC count 1000 106 cells/La 14/36 (39) 3/15 (20) 11 /21 (52) univariable and bivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that initial high viral load was associated with prolonged shedding consistently in all models. four patients started viral shedding prior to transplant; therefore, we separately analyzed 40 patients who started shedding after transplant. the results remained similar. single-nucleotide variants accumulated at a rate of approximately 1 variant per 3\u20134 weeks. no single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OC43 and HKU1 were recovered in patients 4 and 5. one 18-year-old pediatric patient (patient 4) had 3 different HCoV strains detected in succession over a period of 5 months. one 18-year-old pediatric patient (patient 4) had 3 different HCoV strains detected in succession. single-nucleotide variants in the consensus genome for patient 1 (A), 2 (B) and 3 (C) are depicted. both nonsynonymous and synonymous variants are depicted relative to the day 0 genome recovered. the duration of shedding appeared to be similar across all 4 HCoV strains. no drastic intrahost evolution of viral genomes occurred in this immunocompromised population with prolonged shedding. no previous data exist describing how the HCoV genome evolves within a host over time. engraftment occurred in 4 of 5 patients sequenced prior to shedding. no SNPs were recovered 30 days after shedding even after immune reconstitution. only univariable logistic regression analysis could be performed. this is the first study to evaluate risk factors associated with prolonged shedding of HCoV by quantitative and strain-specific reverse transcription PCR."}
