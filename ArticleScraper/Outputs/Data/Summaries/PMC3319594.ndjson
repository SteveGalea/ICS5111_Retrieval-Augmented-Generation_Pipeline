{"summary": "the paramyxoviridae family includes a large number of human and animal viruses responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases. hendra and nipah have caused fatal infections in humans upon zoonoses from animal reservoirs. members switch hosts at a higher rate than most other virus families. virions from this family are enveloped, pleomorphic, and have a single-stranded, non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome. complete genomic RNA sequences for known members of the family range from 13\u201319 kilobases in length. PCR assays are available for the flaviviruses [8], coronaviruses [9], [10] and adenoviruses [11] for the Paramyxoviridae. a PCR assay is described that detects all genera of the Paramyxoviridae with a single set of primers without the requirement of nesting. this assay was shown to detect all known viruses within the Paramyxoviridae family tested. consensus degenerate and inosine-containing forward and reverse primers, PMX1 and PMX2, respectively, were designed to amplify a fragment with a total size of 121 base pairs. entropy values were plotted for each nucleotide position in the primers. considerable heterogeneity was still present for each of the oligonucleotides. the sequences recognized by oligonucleotides PMX1 and PMX2 were compared to representative paramyxovirus genera and species sequences (N = 33) the heterogeneity was expressed as entropy as defined by Shannon: H (1) f(b, 1) ln [f(b, 1)], where H (1) represents a residue out of the allowed choices for the sequence in question (A, C, G, T, \u2013), and f(b, 1) is the the RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis to visualize the amplified fragments of 121 base pairs. the RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis to visualize the amplified fragments of 121 base pairs, including the primers. za virus type 1 HPIV-1 C35 tMK Human parainfluenza virus type 3 HPIV-3 C243 tMK Rubulavirus Human parainfluenza virus type 2 HPIV-2 Greer,VR-92 tMK Simian parainfluenza virus type 4a HPIV-4A M-25 tMK Simian parainfluenza virus 5 SV5 W3 Eggs Pneumovirinae Pneumovirus Human respiratory additional experiments using RNA isolated from stocks of viruses from different virus families showed no cross reactivity of the assay with influenza A virus, influenza B virus, rhinovirus, human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, and NL63, and adenovirus. PCR fragment detection using a genetic Analyzer Fragment analysis using a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer was used to facilitate screening of larger numbers of samples without the requirement of running agarose gels. avian samples in which no paramyxoviruses were found showed peaks around 121 nucleotides. blue peaks in B and D represent APMV-1 and AMPV-C respectively. RT-PCR assay was a nose wash containing PIV-2 with a CT value of 30. the virus load in the 8 samples that remained negative was lower than the load in the 27 samples yielding a positive reaction. out of the samples tested, 2/3 of the MuV specimens were positive, 4/4 for HMPV, 2/3 for MV, 3/5 for PIV-1, 4/5 for PIV-2, 3/3 for PIV-3, 3/5 for PIV-4, 4/5 high-titre virus stocks of HMPV, HRSV, HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, HPIV-4, and MV were serially diluted to 1010. the same RNA was used for the pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay with subsequent fragment analysis. phylogenetic analysis of 33 different paramyxovirus L-gene fragments was performed. the length of the branch of Taro vein chlorosis virus as an outgroup is broken. it does not represent its genetic distance to the rest of the tree. amplicon sequences obtained with PMX1-PMX2 are used to classify the viruses detected. a total of 847 samples were tested for the presence of paramyxoviruses. APMV-1 was found in a barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and a white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) and APMV-8 in a barnacle goose. this is the first time AMPV-C has been found in Europe. hemagglutinating agents were obtained upon inoculation of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs with bird specimens. seventeen hemagglutinating agents could not be identified as influenza A virus. the most conserved motifs were found in domain III of the polymerase protein. a forced nucleotide alignment was made based on the motifs found in the amino acid alignment. the entropy plots show high conservation of the 14 terminal nucleotides at the 3\u2032 ends of both primers. APMV-6 and henipaviruses have a single nucleotide mismatch to the primer. primer positions are given in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. sequences recognized by oligonucleotides PMX1 and PMX2 were compared to representative paramyxovirus genera and species sequences (N = 33) RNA was isolated from high titer virus stocks in a 50 L volume. 11 L of the RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis to visualize the amplified fragments of 121 base pairs. RNA was isolated from the indicated virus stocks and used for PCR analysis and subsequent electrophoresis. RNA was isolated from the indicated virus stocks. PCR using the PMX1/PMX2 primer pair amplified all 28 paramyxovirus strains. RNA isolated from stocks of viruses from different virus families showed no cross reactivity of the assay with influenza A virus, influenza B virus, rhinovirus, human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, and NL63, and adenovirus. the blue peaks are PCR products amplified by PMX1 and PMX2. the blue peaks are avian samples in which no paramyxoviruses were found. B and D show peaks around 121 nucleotides. pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay detected 27 human paramyxoviruses. the sample with the lowest Ct value (highest concentration target nucleic acid) that remained negative in the pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay was a nose wash containing PIV-2 with a CT value of 30. the virus load in the 8 samples that remained negative was lower than the load in the 27 samples yielding a positive reaction. high-titre virus stocks of HMPV, HRSV, HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, HPIV-4, and MV were serially diluted to 1010. dilutions were tested using agent-specific real-time PCR assays in our diagnostics department. an L-gene fragment of the rhabdovirus Taro vein chlorosis virus was used as outgroup. Sequenced in black were obtained from Genbank while sequences in red were obtained from the avian surveillance study reported here. a selection of influenza virus negative samples was tested for the presence of members of the paramyxoviridae family. a total of 847 samples were tested for the presence of paramyxoviruses. APMV-1 was found in a barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and a white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) hemagglutinating agents were obtained upon inoculation of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs with bird specimens. seventeen hemagglutinating agents could not be identified as influenza A virus. RNA was extracted from these unknown hemagglutinating agents. the polymerase gene is the most conserved gene of the Paramyxoviridae family. the primers were designed using an amino acid alignment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein that contained motifs conserved among all members of the seven genera composing the Paramyxoviridae family. the forward and reverse primers anneal at sites that are highly conserved. all 28 paramyxoviruses that were present in our laboratory were amplified successfully. the thymine at position 20 in the forward primer does not match the cytosine at the corresponding location in the Henipavirus genus L-gene. this same mismatch was also seen in SV5. the sensitivity of the pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay is less than what can be achieved with more specific RT-PCR based tests. the application of the pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay was further evaluated using specimens from wild migratory birds. three different paramyxovirus species were detected. single round pan-paramyxovirus RT-PCR assay described here may thus be a useful tool for the detection of known and unknown paramyxoviruses. oligonucleotide primer design Primers were designed to anneal to conserved motifs in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. the optimized RT mixture contained 11 L of RNA extract, 1 L (500 g/mL) Random Primers (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands), 0.5 L (40 U/l) Ribinuclease Inhibitor (Promega) and 1 L (10 mM each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Roche) after a 5 min incubation at 65\u00b0C for optimal primer hybridisation to template. agarose gel containing 1 GelStar\u00ae Nucleic Acid Gel Stain was visualized by blue light. oligonucleotide PMX1 was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) and PMX2 was unlabeled. ks balanced salt solution containing 0.5% lactalbumin, 10% glycerol, 200 U/mL penicillin, 200 g/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL polymyxin B sulfate, 250 g/mL gentamicin, and 50 U/mL nystatin. all bird samples were stored at 80\u00b0C or at 20\u00b0C if rapid transport or storage was not possible. RNA was isolated manually using a MagnaPure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit (Roche) according to instructions from the manufacturer. the optimized RT mixture contained 11 L of RNA extract, 1 L (500 g/mL) Random Primers (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands), 0.5 L (40 U/l) Ribinuclease Inhibitor (Promega) and 1 L (10 mM each) deoxynucleoside tri RT mixture was sequentially incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5 min and 42\u00b0C for 1 hour to obtain cDNA. PCR was optimized with respect to enzymes, primer sets, and concentrations of reagents as well as cycling parameters. 0.5 L LIZ-600 Size Standard (GeneScan, Freiburg, Germany) was mixed with 9 L formamide and 0.5 L PCR product. data was analysed using the 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) nucleotide sequence alignments of paramyxovirus L gene inserts were done using the Clustal W multiple alignment tool in BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor [13] Maximum likelihood trees were inferred using PAUP* (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony [19], version 4b10)"}
