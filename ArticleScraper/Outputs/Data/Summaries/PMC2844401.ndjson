{"summary": "a cross-sectional study of 1,548 adult subjects recruited from various shopping malls in Riyadh and Jeddah was conducted. all subjects were interviewed using a questionnaire that tested their knowledge, attitudes, and use of precautionary measures in relation to the H1N1 influenza pandemic. misconceptions and worries have led to inappropriate behaviour by the public. such as refusal to comply with precautionary measures, including wearing a mask or accepting a vaccination. avoidance of certain activities including visiting the hospital due to fear of healthcare facilities as a venue for aqcuiring the infection. the scientific committee was able to provide educational material on the signs and symptoms of H1N1 for dissemination through shopping malls, mosques, airports and schools. the members of the scientific committee were requested to provide scientific statements on the developments of the pandemic. this is the first study from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that focused on understanding the public's awareness of and attitudes toward a pandemic threat. a scoring system was applied to assess the level of knowledge of each subject. participants responded with \"strongly agree,\" \"agree,\" \"neutral,\" \"disagree\" and \"strongly disagree\" the total attitude score ranged from 6 to 30 points. a high level of precaution was considered to be 5-6 points, a moderate level was 3-4 points, and a poor level was 2 points or less. a high level of precaution was considered to be 5-6 points, a moderate level was 3-4 points, and a poor level was 2 points or less. each data collector spent an average of 3 hours in each mall at randomly chosen time of the day to recruit participants. of 1,601 possible participants, 1,548 subjects of both sexes were successfully interviewed. a scoring system was applied to assess the level of knowledge of each subject. each participant was asked to report the precautionary measures that s/he has been using during the epidemic to prevent infection. a scoring system was applied in which each participant was given 1 point for each precautionary measure taken. a high level of precaution was considered to be 5-6 points, a moderate level was 3-4 points, and a poor level was 2 points or less. 118 14.3 87 12.1 205 13.2 60 yr. or more 9 1.1 4 0.6 13 0.8 2 = 8.759, p = 0.033 Marital status: Single 397 47.9 291

agreed that the symptoms were the same as those of seasonal flu. 11% of participants assumed that this illness could cause immediate death. only 38.3% of participants believed that the government was reporting the real number of cases, while 55.6% believed there was underreporting of the actual number of deaths. 1,029 58.5 56.0-61.0 The government should restrict travel from and to the areas of the disease. 1,276 82.4 80.5-84.3 The government should avoid inviting workers from areas where disease is frequent. 1,353 87.6 86.0-89.2 The government should be ready to close schools if the number of cases increases dramatically. two-thirds of all participants (60.8%) reported not taking minimal or mild precautions to prevent infection. only 17.2% reported a high level of precautions. education was the only significant predictor of concern, and the level of education was inversely related to the degree of concern (p 0.001) 118 14.3 87 12.1 205 13.2 60 yr. or more 9 1.1 4 0.6 13 0.8 2 =

ache, etc.) most participants (94%) agreed that the symptoms were the same as those of seasonal flu. 11% assumed that this illness could cause immediate death. only 38.3% of participants believed that the government was reporting the real number of cases, while 55.6% believed there was underreporting of the actual number of deaths. 1,029 58.5 56.0-61.0 The government should restrict travel from and

about two-thirds of all participants (60.8%) reported not taking minimal or mild precautions to prevent infection. only 17.2% reported a high level of precautions. a high level of precaution was taken by males (p 0.001) and older individuals (p = 0.047) swine flu has recently emerged from Mexico and has caused the first pandemic of the century [1]. many reports have examined the various levels of knowledge about infectious agents and public behaviour in relation to these infections. many reports have examined the various levels of knowledge about disease transmission, availability of vaccines and effective medical treatment. a survey of 2,081 adults over the age of 16 found that only 48.3% of those interviewed were willing to comply with precautionary measures. young, less-educated males were the least likely to take precautionary measures. the word \"pandemic\" alone and the announcement that we are at Phase 6 gives an impression that many people die every day. the general public should know that swine flu is global but not severe. the majority of participants agreed that the government should isolate patients with Swine flu in special hospitals. more than one-half prefereed not to travel during epidemic and stay at home. regional differences in anxiety towards influenza A, H1N1, have been suggested. disbelief in the government reports about the outbreak could have negative implications for compliance with official advice. misconceptions about the disease may be related to the use of television and newspapers as the primary sources of information on swine flu."}
