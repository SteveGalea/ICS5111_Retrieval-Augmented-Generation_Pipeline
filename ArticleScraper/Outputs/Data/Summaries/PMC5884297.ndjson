GWASs demand recruitment of large well-phenotyped clinical cohorts within appropriate study designs and settings. but they are very expensive, and therefore few funding agencies are able to finance such studies yet they may offer unique opportunities to unveil genetically important signals. authors have extensively reviewed the genetic susceptibility to diseases. the ancient biological \u201carms race\u201d between microbial pathogens and humans has shaped genetic variation in modern populations. this has important implications for the growing field of medical genomics. foremost is a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and resistance in the expectation that this will lead in time to improved interventions such as better drugs or vaccines to prevent or attenuate the great global burden of infectious disease morbidity and mortality. in the past decade, we have also witnessed the emergence of many new pathogens not previously detected in humans. bioinformatics is a set of activities: data acquisition, database development, data analysis, data integration, and analysis of integrated data. bioinformatics tools/software are both \u201copen sources\u201d and commercially available, but clinicians have limited bioinformatics knowledge. genetics/genomics studies in recent years have uncovered a growing list of genes that might have experienced positive selection during the evolution of humans and/or primates. a number of specific genomic variants including -globin locus, G6PD deficiency, Duffy, ovalocytosis, ABO, and human leukocyte antigen confer resistance to malaria in the human host. the 32 mutation at the CCR5 locus is a well-studied example of natural selection acting in humans. the mutation prevents functional expression of the CCR5 chemokine receptor normally used by HIV-1 to enter CD4+ T cells. GWASs are based on the \u201ccommon disease, common variant\u201d hypothesis. they have been performed using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. they focus only on common genetic polymorphisms. common genetic variants have also been demonstrated to regulate susceptibility/resistance to infectious diseases. a genomic database for all mutations identified to be conferring resistance to infectious diseases in different populations is a vital product of more than 10 years of GWAS. more studies should be appropriately designed to identify new potential infectious disease resistance-conferring mutations in human hosts. the future will offer a less costly approach that will integrate a genomic profile in routine patient management, improving management of diseases, and therapeutic development. different individuals have different mutations that offer resistance to different stages of the infection."}
