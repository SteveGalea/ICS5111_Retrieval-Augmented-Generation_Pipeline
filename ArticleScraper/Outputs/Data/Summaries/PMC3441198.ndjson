{"summary": "activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is a chemoproteomic platform for monitoring active proteins or enzymes. ABPP uses chemical probes to interrogate the functional state of large numbers of enzymes in complex proteomes in vitro or in vivo biological systems. serine hydrolases represent one of the largest and most diverse classes of enzymes in higher eukaryotes. hydrolases are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes including blood coagulation (Kalafatis et al., 1997), T cell cytotoxicity (Smyth et al., 1996), inflammation (Bonventre et al., 1997), neural plasticity (Yoshida and Shiosaka, 1999), neurotransmitter catabolism (Taylor, 1991; Cravatt et al., 1996), non-structural 3 protease (NS3 \u2013 is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease) has been shown to be responsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursor and to play a pivotal role in the replication of flaviviruses. NS3 also facilitates viral pathogenicity by cleaving host proteins and down-regulating the innate immune response of the cell. serine protease inhibitors inhibit pseudorabies virus invasion in basal membranes. vaccinia virus serine protease inhibitor prevents virus induced cell fusion. pAB significantly reduces influenza A virus replication in mouse models. selective inhibitors have been introduced to probe the function of individual serine hydrolase in biological systems. ABPP IN HOST VIRUS INTERACTION Microarray technologies in the field of genomics (transcriptomics), and mass spectrometry and bioinformatics technologies in proteomics have facilitated the specific and global analyses of genes and their expression. this has accelerated understanding the molecular basis of disease. ABPP has been used to profile a number of enzyme classes including proteases, hydrolases, oxidoreductases, and isomerases. profiling of hydrolases in Huh7 cells replicating HCV identified CES1 (carboxylesterase 1) as a differentially active enzyme which has an important role in HCV propagation. competitive ABPP has already led to the discovery of selective serine inhibitors (e.g., carbamates, trizole ureas) for several enzymes (e.g., carbamates, trizole ureas), which have in turn been used to test the function of these proteins in living systems. competitive ABPP-SILAC is valuable to identify inhibited enzymes during global screening of inhibitors. metabolomics and ABPP approaches can be applied to mapping biochemical pathways that support disease. using selective inhibitors developed through competitive ABPP efforts or RNA interference technology, the function of an enzyme of interest can be specifically blocked and then the metabolites that the enzyme regulate can be profiled. ABPP with live cell imaging may provide additional insight into understanding the pathogenesis due to viral infection. resistance and developing new antiviral therapeutics and viral diagnostics will make the ABPP application more worthwhile for the field of virology."}
