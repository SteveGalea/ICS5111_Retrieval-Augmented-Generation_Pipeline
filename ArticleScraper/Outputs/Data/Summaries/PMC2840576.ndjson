{"summary": "the definition of stress is an evolving process and for this review we accept the definition of stress as the state of threatened balance, equilibrium, or harmony. the adaptive reactions to stressors may involve mobilization of a wide variety of physiological responses including the immune response. stress can be defined as a psychologically perturbing condition occurring in response to adverse external influences capable of affecting physical health. stress is a major concern because it is ubiquitous, recurring in nature and has detrimental effects on health. in this review we will primarily deal with important psychological stressors and their influence on respiratory disease which is one of the most widely studied models. stress and viral infection There are reports which have shown direct connections between stress and immune system function. studies have extended these results by considering a wider range of psychosocial factors. stress can often act as a buffer against the effects of stress. social support reduced viral replication rate and increased mucociliary clearance of infection. psychosocial factors and health-related behaviors were associated with increased susceptibility to colds, which then led to an exacerbation of asthma. alcohol consumption, personality and demographic factors were also shown to be important predictors of susceptibility. smoking was related to illness severity but not disease susceptibility. at least one source of IL-6 is epithelial cells as evidenced by their production of IL-6 in vitro and in vivo when exposed to rhinovirus. a local increase in the concentration of this pro-inflammatory cytokine precedes the development of acute signs and symptoms of illness. IL-6 concentrations in nasal secretions were associated with upper respiratory tract symptoms. a correlation between stress and illness was mediated by IL-6. the data do not permit causal inference. this pattern of data is consistent with increases in IL-6 occurring in response to tissue damage associated with illness symptoms. cortisol and other glucocorticoid hormones have various effects. conservation of glucose for neural tissues, elevation or stabilization of blood glucose levels, mobilization of protein reserves, suppression of wound healing and the immune system. the general adaptation syndrome divides the stress response into three stages. the HPA is the core stress axis in mammals. there is considerable interplay between both neuronal systems. the noradrenergic nucleus locus ceruleus provides central regulation of the SAM and the parvocellular neurones which regulate the HPA. adrenal cortex damage causes parasympathetic action. the immune system collapses, and stress-related diseases increase. the suspicion has arisen that systemic stressors may also act in such a provocative capacity. the initial theory came from Hans Seyles\u2019 GAS, which was derived from observation and experimentation on laboratory animals. he described a common nonspecific stress response pathway. after initial perception of a stressor, the animal mounts an emergency alarm or fight-or-flight response. new information suggests there are at least four different avenues of neuroendocrine responses. these include the autonomic nervous system, the HPA axis, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters and neuroimmunological peptides and receptors. neuroendocrine regulation of inflammatory and immune responses can occur at multiple levels. interactions have been clearly demonstrated in many animal models using a variety of species and infectious agents. these models are relevant to human inflammatory, autoimmune and allergic illnesses including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, allergic asthma and atopic skin disease. the main studies to correlate stress and disease susceptibility were done either in plant systems41 or a correlation between oxidative stress and infectious disease. a variety of tools have been developed to expedite large-scale analyses of gene expression at the level of individual cells, tissues, or whole organisms. bioinformatics and statistical approaches specific for detailed transcriptomics or cluster analyses of expressed genes have been developed. bioinformatics and statistical approaches specific for detailed transcriptomics or cluster analyses of expressed genes have been developed and are useful for extracting information on various functional genomic responses. the consortium for metabonomic toxicology (COMET) is currently investigating approximately 150 model liver and kidney toxins. the consortium for metabonomic toxicology (COMET) is currently investigating approximately 150 model liver and kidney toxins. authors used 2,769 mouse/rat orthologous genes identified on RG_U34A and MG_U74Av2 arrays. expression profiles were simultaneously analyzed by significance analysis of microarrays. results were validated by comparable expression levels obtained by either real-time or relative RT-PCR. cytokines produced by immune cells can alter brain homeostasis. stressors such as forced exercise, avoidance learning and isolation made animals more susceptible to primary infection with a variety of viruses. bovine respiratory disease models have been developed to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the viral-bacterial synergy which results in fatal BRD infections. the major stressors young cattle experience include maternal separation or weaning, dietary changes, transportation, social reorganization and other environmental effects. virus-1 (BHV-1) followed by M. haemolytica; this combined viral\u2013bacterial infection induces fatal pneumonia in 50%\u201370% of calves.83 Figure 3. Schematic diagram of various important stressors of feedlot cattle. serum cortisol levels were significantly elevated (p 0.01) in both groups of calves. cortisol levels were significantly elevated (p 0.01) in both groups of calves following transport. IL-10 was upregulated on day 4 in PC groups while -defensin was activated on day 4 in both groups. IL-10 acts as an anti-inflammatory gene should be activated on day 4 to control pro-inflammatory responses as a result of BHV-1 infection in either AW or both groups. multivariate analysis revealed distinct differences in the distribution profile of proteins, metabolites and elements following a stress response both before and after primary viral infection. a group of acute phase proteins, metabolites and elements could be specifically linked to either a stress response. time spent walking by the calf also decreases for abruptly weaned calves. it is clear that amount of data to understand such a complex condition is not adequate and enough. behavioural studies may not always be correlated to a particular stressor. studies are needed to understand the physiological differences between acute versus chronic stress as well as the combined effects of various stressors. it is very important to understand the kinetics, specificity and stability or duration of biomarkers associated with a specific stressor."}
