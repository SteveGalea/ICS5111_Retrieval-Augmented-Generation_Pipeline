{"summary": "the AVNV genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule of 210,993 bp with a nucleotide composition of 38.5% G + C. a total of 123 open reading frames were predicted to encode functional proteins, ranging from 41 to 1,878 amino acid residues. the DNA sequence of AVNV is 97% identical to that of ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), and the amino acid sequences of herpesviruses comprise an abundant, widely distributed group of large DNA viruses in vertebrates and invertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and marine molluscs. genomes of herpesvirus have been accumulating since the 1980s. sixty-eight isolated from different species have been deposited in GenBank to date. a distinct OsHV-1 genotype (OsHV-1 Var) has been reported in association with massive mortality in Pacific oysters in france. since the mid-1990s, the farming of Chinese scallops has experienced a period of severe crisis due to the ongoing mortality outbreaks. the AVNV genome was initially determined to be 210,825 bp in size. however, a large palindrome located between ORF49 and ORF50 in the OsHV-1 genome appeared to be deleted upon cloning into the plasmids used for sequencing. the complete AVNV genomic DNA sequences was determined to be 210,993 bp. 12 ORFs were duplicated, resulting in a total of 135 putative genes in AVNV. the proportion of the genome encoding ORFs was about 82%, which was similar to that of OsHV-1 (84%). the average length of AVNV ORFs was 1,260 bp. the AVNV and OsHV-1 DNA sequences showed about 97% identity overall. however, there were several obvious insertions and deletions between the two genomes, the most notable being located in the AVNV genome at positions 1,500-1,700, 60,700-63,350, 183,900-184,100, 187,300-190,300, 192,800-195,100, 203,000-205,100 and 207,800-210,700. the region encodes a putative glycoprotein (ORF88) and has been used to design primers for the detection and identification of OsHV-1 variants in French scallops. the AVNV and OsHV-1 DNA sequences differed in this region by one synonymous and five non-synonymous substitutions. the five non-synonymous substitutions yielded 99% identity in this region at both nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels. the results showed that these three AVNV fragments were 99%, 97% and 99% identical to OsHV-1, respectively. the AVNV genome was initially determined to be 210,825 bp in size. however, a large palindrome located correspondingly between ORF49 and ORF50 appeared to be deleted upon cloning into the plasmids used for sequencing. the two inverted repeats (ORF1-ORF6 and ORF116-ORF122) are shown in a thicker format. the scale is in kb. the AVNV genome analysis resulted in the prediction of 123 unique open reading frames (ORFs) potentially encoding functional proteins. the majority of AVNV ORFs were closely matched in size and orientation with their OsHV-1 counterparts. the majority of AVNV ORFs were closely matched in size and orientation with their OsHV-1 counterparts, with identities from 94% to 100%. however, there were several obvious insertions and deletions between the two genomes. compared to OsHV-1, there were also two deletions of A residues in AVNV at positions 244 and 395, an insertion of an A residue at position 283, and two synonymous substitutions in ORF4 at positions 411 and 516. the location of primers C2 and C6 is underlined and marked by an arrowhead. the genome of AVNV was 210,993 bp in size, which was slightly longer than that of OsHV-1. the genome organization consisted of three unique regions and two inverted repeat regions. previous reports showed that the two viruses were also similar in epidemiology [36,46,47], morphology [25,33,34,48] and histopathology [15,28,34,35]. AVNV has three repeats, whereas OsHV-1 has eight [25], the variant OsHV-1 Var has four [29], another OsHV-1 variant has six [49] and other french specimens present various numbers of CTA repeats. the microsatellite region does display polymorphisms and could be used for identifying and differentiating among OsHV-1 variants. a region located at 60,700-63,350 bp in AVNV is particularly unusual in bearing a large insertion of 2.6 kb compared to the OsHV-1 genome. several OsHV-1 genotypes have also been described in oysters, scallops and clams based on analysis of various genome regions [27-29,50,57] seawater was filtered through 0.22 m membranes (Millipore, USA) and used in the following purification steps. mantle, gill and kidney tissues from scallops were rinsed 3 times and homogenized in seawater (1:9) using an Ultra-Turrax tissue homogenizer. PCR was carried out using an adaptor-specific primer plus a primer specific for the left or right terminal region of the genome. the products were purified using a TaKaRa gel purification kit (Takara) the cloned fragments were sequenced in both directions using universal primers and an ABI PRISM 3770. samples AVNV infected scallops, C. farreri, were collected from Qingdao, china, in 2007. all diseased animals showed clinical signs including slow reactions, weak water-spray, shrunken mantle, blemished ocelli and an enlarged digestive gland. a total of 62 PCR primer pairs were designed based on the OsHV-1 genome sequence (GenBank accession AY509253) the AVNV genome termini were identified using the method described by Davison et al. complete genome sequence alignments were performed using Geneious (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand) complete genome sequence alignments were performed using Accelrys Gene 2.5.
