{"summary": "HBoV is classified in the genus Bocaparvovirus within the family Parvoviridae. HBoV is associated with lower-respiratory-tract infections and gastroenteritis. HBoV is associated with lower-respiratory-tract infections and gastroenteritis. the right half of the genome encodes the structural proteins VP1 and VP2 which share a C terminus. the N terminus of VP1 contains a phospholipase A2 domain which is essential for parvovirus infectivity (26, 27) HBoV contains multiple proximal polyadenylation sites (22, 28) polyadenylation at (pA)d2 is regulated by nonstructural protein NS1, right-end hairpin (REH) and cis elements of (pA)d. the regulation of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 is linked to capsid protein expression levels, which could be important for virus production. splicing donor sites (D), splicing acceptor sites (A), proximal polyadenylation site (pA)p, and distal polyadenylation site (pA)d. the numbers denote nucleotide positions in the HBoV genome. pHBoV1-WH was transfected into different cell lines (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 to 5) or when polarized Calu-3 cells were infected with purified virus. PCR was performed with specific primers and products were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels. RNAs were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels, transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes. adenylation of BPV and MVC, (pA)d2 is located on the right-end terminus. the last 42 nt of the right-end stem of HBoV and MVC are almost identical. the last 42 nt of the right-end stem of HBoV are almost identical. transfection of NP1 knockout plasmid (pHBoV1-NP1KO) to HEK293T cells resulted in decreased polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2 as measured by using 3\u2032 RACE. however, the ratio of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 to (pA)d was not changed. total RNA was isolated from HEK293T cells transfected with the plasmids shown in panel A. the image in the middle (lanes 6 to 10) and the image on the right (lanes 11 to 15) were of the same batch of samples. pA)d was observed when pHBoVREH-161 was transfected to HEK293T cells. the result indicated that the right hairpin plays an important role in polyadenylation at (pA)d2. total RNA was isolated from HEK293T cells transfected with the plasmids shown in panel A. transfecting plasmid pEGFP-(pA)d2 into HEK293T cells resulted in polyadenylation only at (pA)d in the absence of NS1 cotransfection. however, cotransfection of pEGFP-(pA)d2 with pcDNA-NS1 resulted in polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2 and the level of RNA transcripts increased more than transfecting pEGFP-HS (Fig. 5B, lanes 7 and 8) into HEK293T cells resulted in a loss of polyadenylation at (pA)d in the presence of NS1 cotransfection (Fig. 5C, lane 8), suggesting that cis elements of (pA)d are required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2. pEGFP-mPAS was transfected into cells in the a U-rich stretch is 22 nt downstream of hexanucleotide AAUAAA. transfecting the mutation plasmids into HEK293T cells resulted in reduced polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2. polyadenylation at (pA)d2 is not required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2. downstream elements (DSE) of (pA)d regulate polyadenylation at (pA)d and (pA)d2. downstream sequences of (pA)d were mutated as diagrammed. total RNA was isolated from transfected HEK293T cells. sequence between (pA)d and (pA)d2 with heterologous sequences also resulted in decreased polyadenylation at (pA)d2. sequence between nt 5223 or nt 5197 and nt 5356 was deleted in pHBoV1Del1 and pHBoV1Del2 respectively. transfecting pEGFP-HS resulted in the loss of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 and a decrease in GFP expression. a VP2 expression cassette and the downstream sequence of (pA)d, with or without (pA)d2, were cloned into expression vector pXJ40-FLAG. pA)d2 with NS1 into HEK293T cells resulted in polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2. expression level of VP2 protein increased at least 10-fold. alternative polyadenylation at the 3\u2032 end of HBoV regulates capsid mRNA transcript levels and results in increased capsid protein expression. nonstructural (NS1) and capsid (VP1/VP2) protein-encoding genes were amplified from a DNA extract prepared from the feces of a 2-year-old infant. the full-length recombinant clone was designated pHBoV1-WH (Fig. 1A) and transfected into HEK293T cells. dpnI-digested fragments were resolved in 1% agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane. dRF, double replication form; mRF, monomer replication form. purified recombinant viral particles were negatively stained and analyzed. infected Calu-3 cells or pHBoV1-WH-transfected HEK293T cells reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) PCR was performed with specific primers and products were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels. RNA was isolated from HBoV infectious clone-transfected HEK293T cells at the indicated times. polyadenylation at (pA)d and (pA)d2 were both detected by Northern blot analysis. NS1 and REH are required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2. transfection of NS1 knockout plasmid (pHBoV1-NS1KO) resulted in a 7-fold reduction in polyadenylation at (pA)d2. the ratio of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 to (pA)d was not changed. however, the abundance of RNA transcripts polyadenylated at both (pA)d and (pA)d2 increased more than 10-fold. this is consistent with previous report that NP1 facilitates capsid protein expression. VP2 knockout plasmids (pHBoV1-VP1KO and pHBoV1-VP2KO) to HEK293T cells did not result in a change of polyadenylation at (pA)d2. deleting all hairpins at 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 ends of HBoV did not affect polyadenylation at (pA)d2. total RNA isolated from transfected HEK293T cells was resolved in 1.5% agarose gels, transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes, and hybridized with probes spanning nt 4745 to nt 5171. cis elements of (pA)d are required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2. transfection of plasmid pEGFP-(pA)d, which contains (pA)d and downstream sequences transfection of pEGFP-(pA)d2 with pcDNA-NS1 resulted in polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2. the level of RNA transcripts increased more than 10-fold. both NS1 and REH are required for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. no polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was observed when pEGFP-mPAS was transfected into cells in the absence or presence of NS1 cotransfection. the addition of the sPA created a strong enough polyadenylation signal that the majority of RNA transcripts were polyadenylated at (pA)d, and few RNA transcripts were polyadenylated at (pA)d2. polyadenylation at (pA)d2 only requires sequences between nt 5159 and nt 5196. a strong polyadenylation at (pA)d inhibited polyadenylation at (pA)d2. downstream sequences of (pA)d were mutated as diagrammed. the sequences and distance between (pA)d and (pA)d2 affect polyadenylation at (pA)d2. the sequences from nt 5223 or nt 5197 to nt 5356 were transfected into HEK293T cells. the sequences between (pA)d and (pA)d2 are also important for alternative polyadenylation regulation. the sequence between nt 5223 or nt 5197 and nt 5356 was deleted. the sequence between nt 5223 and nt 5356 was replaced with heterologous sequence. polyadenylation at (pA)d2 enhances capsid mRNA and protein expression. alternative polyadenylation at (pA)d2 increases expression level of GFP protein. a VP2 expression cassette and downstream sequence of (pA)d were cloned into expression vector pXJ40-FLAG. no polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was detected because of lack of REH. alternative polyadenylation at (pA)d2 increases expression level of capsid protein. VP2 expression plasmids with or without (pA)d2 are shown. bands with stars represent RNAs that were polyadenylated at the vector polyadenylation site. a new distal polyadenylation site (pA)d2 was discovered when recombinant infectious clones were transfected into HEK293T cells. the recombinant HBoV infectious clone contains three proximal polyadenylation sites, which is consistent with previous reports. no classical hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal was found around (pA)d2. HBoV encodes at least three nonstructural proteins that include NS1, NS1-70K, and NP1. NS1 contains DNA binding, endonuclease, ATPase, and helicase activities. plasmids with (pA)d2 polyadenylation reporter plasmid pEGFP-(pA)d2 in HEK293T cells. these results suggest that all functional NS1 domains are required for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. NP1 facilitates (pA)p read-through of structural protein-encoding mRNA transcripts (24, 25) and increases capsid protein expression. polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was abolished by mutation of sequences from nt 5159 to nt 5177. the downstream elements required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2 are also different. the distance and sequence per se between (pA)d and (pA)d2 also affected polyadenylation efficiency at (pA)d2. this 3\u2032 noncoding region (NCR) of HBoV is 274 nt and affects polyadenylation efficiency at (pA)d2. it could function as a binding site for miRNAs or be involved in the production of noncoding RNAs to regulate protein expression. the sequence of this region enhanced polyadenylation at (pA)d2 but the mechanism is currently unknown. a new polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, was discovered when recombinant infectious clones were transfected into HEK293T cells. HBoV encodes at least three nonstructural proteins that include NS1, NS1-70K, and NP1. HBoV encodes at least three nonstructural proteins that include NS1-70K, and NP1. NS1 contains DNA binding, endonuclease, ATPase, and helicase activities. disrupting the NS1 open reading frame by point mutation resulted in the loss of polyadenylation at (pA)d2. this suggests that NS1 is indispensable for polyadenylation at (pA)d2. NS2, NS3, and NS4 are dispensable for viral replication (36) polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was detected when polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was abolished by mutation of sequences from nt 5159 to nt 5177. the downstream elements required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2 are also different. ylation is widely spread in metazoan protein-coding transcripts. transfecting pXJ40-VP2(pA)d2 resulted in polyadenylation at (pA)d2. the distance between (pA)d and (pA)d2 is 274 nt and affects polyadenylation efficiency. bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells were cultured in DMEM-nutrient mixture F-12 Hams (1:1) supplemented with 1% MEM nonessential amino acids solution (GIBCO), 1% GlutaMAX (GIBCO) and 10% FBS (GIBCO) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. cells with transepithelial electrical resistance values over 600 V/cm2 were used for HBoV infection.
