HEK-293T cells overexpressing IFITM3, IFITM3-K88me1 levels increased over time after VSV infection, which coincided with an increase in VSV RNA levels (VSV-L), but no change in total IFITM3 protein expression. both viral and host signals may influence the monomethylation of IFITM3 at the posttranslational level. HEK-293T cells grown in six-well plates were transfected with 0.5 g of HA-IFITM3 and 1 g of FLAG-SET7. cells were then immunoprecipitated with 1 g of anti-IFITM3 antibody plus protein A/G beads.

SET7 inhibits anti-VSV potency of ISGs in an IFITM-dependent manner. MRC5 cells were tested for knockdown of IFITM1, -2, and -3. knockdown of SET7 promotes antiviral activity of ISGs in an IFITM-dependent manner.

HEK-293T cells with low basal levels of endogenous IFITM3 were depleted. the depletion of SET7 had no effect on the levels of viral RNA detected by qPCR after infection. the effect of SET7 on antiviral responses was dependent on the expression of IFITM3. HEK-293T cells were transfected with 1 g of pcDNA3.1-IFITM3 and 1 g of FLAG-SET7 plasmids as indicated. overexpression of SET7 reduces the antiviral activity of IFITM3. -293T cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.5 g of pcDNA3.1-IFITM3 or 0.5 g of pcDNA3.1-IFITM3-K88R/K88A mutants. cells were infected with VSV at a MOI of 0.02 and collected for analyses 12 h post-infection. SET7 Modulates ISG-mediated Anti-VSV/IAV Responses in an IFITM-dependent FITM1 and IFITM2 were all simultaneously depleted. the effect of SET7 on ISG-mediated antiviral function was effectively abolished. SET7 seemed to not affect antiviral responses when ISGs were not induced, suggesting that at least in this system SET7 does not regulate antiviral responses of low/basal levels of IFITM3. MRC5 cells were tested for knockdown of IFITM1, -2, and -3. knockdown of SET7 promotes antiviral activity of ISGs in an IFITM-dependent manner. lentivirus-packaged shRNAs were transduced into MRC5 cells grown in six-well plates on day 1. knockdown of SET7 no longer had an effect on the levels of WSN33 RNAs detected in the A549 cells. results indicate how the IFITM antiviral factors may be modulated in a SET7-depdendent manner to determine host susceptibility toward viral infection. d, knockdown of SET7 promotes antiviral activity of ISGs in an IFITM-dependent manner.

SET7 was co-transfected into HEK-293T cells grown in six-well plates. lentivirus-packaged shRNA targets IFITM1, -2, and -3. protein blots were probed with antibodies as indicated. knockdown of SET7 no longer had an effect on levels of WSN33 RNAs detected in the A549 cells.
