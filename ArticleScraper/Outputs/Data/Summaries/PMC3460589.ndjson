{"summary": "in vitro Transcription using the T7 High-yield RNA Synthesis Kit. set up the reaction at room temperature in the following order. add 1 g DNA and make up the total reaction volume to 20 l with nuclease free water. 4 8mM Template DNA* X 1 g T7 RNA Polymerase Mix 2 Total 20 *Add 1 g DNA and make up the total reaction volume to 20 l with nuclease free water. the amount of water to be added will vary based on the concentration of the template DNA. add 2 l 10X Capping Buffer, 1 l GTP (10 mM), 1 l freshly diluted S-adenosyl methionine (2 mM) and 1 l (10 units) Vaccinia capping enzyme. mix well by gently vortexing and incubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes in a dry air incubator. to each tube add 1 l capped GLuc RNA (Vaccinia), 1 l capped CLuc RNA (for normalization) and 25 l of serum free DMEM. Mix well. Incubate at room temperature for 2-5 minutes. s obtained from untransfected wells will be used as negative controls. s obtained from untransfected wells will be used as negative controls. electropherogram and gel image obtained after running high quality, intact RNA on the Bioanalyzer. transfection of cells with both capped and uncapped RNA is followed by incubation and assaying cell culture supernatants for luciferase activity. the 5' cap structure is important for protecting the RNA against exonuclease degradation8. the X-axis is the size of the RNA in nucleotides (nt) and the Y-axis represents fluorescence units (FU). the Y-axis represents fluorescence units (FU). the DNA template for the transcription reaction is a linearized plasmid containing the Gaussia luciferase gene and a T7 promoter upstream of the coding sequence. for uncapped RNA, set up the reaction at room temperature in the following order. the amount of water to be added will vary based on the concentration of the template DNA. mix well by vortexing and incubate the reactions at 37 \u00b0C for 2 hours. 2 l 10X Capping Buffer, 1 l GTP (10 mM), 1 l freshly diluted S-adenosyl methionine (2 mM) and 1 l (10 units) Vaccinia capping enzyme to the 15 l denatured RNA. mix well by gently vortexing and incubate the reaction at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes in a dry air incubator. add 1 l capped GLuc RNA (Vaccinia), 1 l capped CLuc RNA (for normalization) and 25 l of serum free DMEM. incubate at room temperature for 2-5 minutes. repeat steps 7 through 10 with the 2nd and 3rd sets of 8 tubes. the bioLux Cypridina Luciferase Assay Kit can produce up to 180 g uncapped RNA and 40 to 50 g of capped RNA per 20 l reaction. RNA transcripts of a longer length than expected may be due to incomplete digestion of template plasmid DNA. transfection of HeLa cells with both capped and uncapped RNA is followed by incubation and assaying cell culture supernatants for luciferase activity. the 5' cap structure is important for protecting the RNA against exonuclease degradation8 and for promoting translation initiation9 of the mRNA. RNA capping is an essential step for transfection experiments. 'L' lane is the RNA ladder, Lane 1 is uncapped GLuc mRNA. Lane 2 is the GLuc mRNA capped using the cap analog. each well consists of plated HeLa cells. the kit is designed for high stability and flexibility. it can be used for synthesizing mRNA, dye labeled RNA and high specific activity radiolabeled probes. it also includes technical information on using PCR products and synthetic DNA oligonucleotides as templates for transcription. the RNA capping methods described above synthesize RNA with a cap 0 structure at the 5' end. the cap 1 structure involves additional methylation at the 2'-O position of the ribose sugar of the first nucleotide. the method described in this paper can be used to transcribe, cap and transfect any desired mRNA."}
