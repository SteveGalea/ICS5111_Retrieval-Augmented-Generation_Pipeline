{"summary": "the village chicken, or free-range, backyard, indigenous, local, or rural chicken, has been an integral part of the lives of many Africans for decades. in Ghana, the population of the village chicken is estimated to constitute 60-80% of the national poultry population [4] guinea fowls also comprise seven percent of the 2009 national poultry population. infectious bronchitis is an acute and highly contagious disease of the respiratory and urogenital tract of chickens. it is ubiquitous in commercial chicken producing regions and economically important worldwide. the disease is caused by a single stranded RNA Coronavirus called infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) the study was conducted in the Ga-East district of the Greater Accra region of Ghana. the inclusion criteria for sampling were all indigenous chickens and/or guinea fowls older than 2 months in these communities. accessibility to the house, willingness of owners to participate in the study, and availability of birds at the time of sampling were also used. ainers were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 mins. sera were harvested into prelabelled 2 mL centrifuge tubes. stored at 20\u00b0C until needed. commercial IBV Antibody Test kit from IDEXX Laboratories Inc. (USA) RNA was extracted from all samples using the Qiagen viral RNA mini kit. PCR negative control (nuclease-free H2O) and PCR positive control (nuclease-free H2O) were added to each reaction set. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Amplicons were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualised with a GelDoc-It\u00ae2 Imager (UVP, USA) after 60 mins of electrophoresis in a 1% TBE buffer. 2.6. Data Analysis OD values were transferred onto an excel worksheet. a na l y z e d 100 % (1) Chi-square test was performed to analyse IBV prevalence between birds in the two (2) communities. those younger than 2 months were excluded from sampling from each bird in a household that met the criteria. a 1:500 dilution of the samples was made with manufacturer's diluent in a 2-step process. 100 l of each diluted sample was pipetted into the appropriate well. a hundred microliters of conjugate was added to all wells. primer pair IBV LC3 5\u2032-ACA GAT TTG CAA C-3\u2032 and LC5 5\u2032-ACT GGC AAT TTT TTC AGA-3\u2032 were used. reaction was performed in a 200 l thin walled PCR tube in a final reaction volume of 25 L in a GeneAmp\u00ae PCR System 9700 thermal cycler. positive control means (PCX) and negative control Means (NCX) for each test plate were calculated. the difference between PCX and NCX was greater than 0.075. majority (59%) of households kept only local chickens and guinea fowls. 7% kept local chickens and duck. 14% kept all three (3) species. in guinea fowls none of the 54 sera samples analysed tested positive for IBV antibody. the overall prevalence of IBV in local chickens was 0%. local chickens from Frafraha were more seropositive for IBV than local chickens from Abokobi. local chickens and guinea fowls were kept by households in both communities. guinea fowls were more likely to be found in the Abokobi community than the Frafraha community. the likelihood of finding local chickens was higher in both communities. the detection of antibodies against IBV is not part of the scheduled vaccination of the Ghana Veterinary Services Directorate. the youngest poultry sampled was more than 3 months old and therefore maternal antibodies against IBV if present would have waned before sampling. the circulation of IBV in local chickens in the district calls for further investigation. the only other avian species with confirmed IBV infection are commercially reared pheasants [22, 23]. fewer guinea fowls sampled could lead us to miss any few positives within the population if the prevalence was low. protection from maternal antibodies would have waned by the age we sampled. local chickens from these countries could have been exposed to field IBV and/or vaccine strains against which antibodies would have been developed. we did not observe a significant association between age and IBV seroprevalence. but a significant difference was observed among local chickens in the 2 communities. the overall seroprevalence of IBV in the local chicken and guinea fowl was 16.0%. local chickens and guinea fowls play an important role in the provision of cheap animal protein for many households in Africa. guinea fowls in the study area were raised under free-range corroborating reports that local chickens and guinea fowls are mostly kept on extensive system by households. all the local chickens from Abokobi had received at least one dose of I2 vaccine but none of the chickens from Frafraha had been vaccinated. vaccination follows efforts by the ministry of food and agriculture's to assist households who keep village chickens in reducing losses due to Newcastle disease nondetection of IBV in guinea fowls could be attributed to a number of reasons. fewer guinea fowls sampled could lead us to miss any few positives within the population if the prevalence was low. the lower prevalence in free-range chickens could also be attributed to the absence of IBV vaccine usage in commercial poultry in the country. both inactivated and live attenuated IBV vaccines are used in the commercial poultry industry in Nigeria and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to control the disease. this introduces vaccine viral strains into the environment which could be transmitted horizontally to the local chickens via aerosol, feed, or water."}
