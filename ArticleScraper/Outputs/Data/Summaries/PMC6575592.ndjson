{"summary": "myeloid cell-specific BCL6-deficient mice (Bcl6Lyz2) were monitored for outcomes after intranasal inoculation with a sublethal dose of IAV (A/PR8/34 strain; PR8) compared with the Bcl6Lyz2 mice, the mice showed drastically decreased weight loss and enhanced host recovery following sublethal PR8 infection. mice with indicated genotypes were infected with sublethal PR8. mice with indicated genotypes were infected with sublethal PR8, and host mortality was monitored. 15, Ifitm3, and Mx1, were similar in the lungs of Bcl6Lyz2 and Bcl6fl/fl mice at 1 and 2 dpi. these data suggest that type I IFNs are probably dispensable for enhanced protection against IAV infection observed in myeloid BCL6-deficient mice. myeloid BCL6 Deficiency Diminishes Pulmonary Inflammation. During acute respiratory viral infection, the deleterious effects of viral replication contribute to pathogenesis (1, 23). however, we observed comparable viral titers in both strains of mice and equal rates of viral clearance. n.s., not significant. n.d., not detected. myeloid BCL6 deficiency diminishes pulmonary inflammation. mice were significantly reduced starting at 4 dpi. decreased morbidity observed in Bcl6Lyz2 mice to IAV infection is possibly due to decreased host inflammation rather than viral burden following IAV infection. Bcl6CD11c and Bcl6fl/fl mice were infected with sublethal PR8. host morbidity (% of initial weight) was monitored. Flow cytometry analysis of BCL6 expression. to study the contribution of inflammatory monocytes (Ly6C+ monocytes) in regulating influenza-associated diseases in Bcl6Lyz2 mice, we crossed Bcl6Lyz2 and Bcl6fl/fl mice to Ccr2/ mice to block inflammatory monocytes trafficking to infected lungs. n.s., not significant. n.d., not detected. 80% of Bcl6fl/fl mice succumbed to lethal PR8 infection. approximately 80% of Bcl6MRP8 mice survived. RNA sequencing was performed to profile transcriptional signatures in neutrophils. 133 genes were down-regulated in RP8 and Bcl6fl/fl mice. 294 genes were up-regulated in BCL6-deficient neutrophils vs. WT neutrophils. the annotated gene names and positions of the BCL6-binding sites are listed. the loss of BCL6 expression in neutrophils resulted in significant enrichment of both the inflammatory response and TNF signaling via NF-B gene sets compared with WT neutrophils. BCL6-deficient neutrophils showed enhanced Pmaip1, Casp3, and Pdcd4 expression compared with their WT counterparts. this suggests that BCL6 controls apoptotic gene expression specifically at the infection site, but not in the circulation or in the bone marrow. chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay for BCL6 in neutrophils purified from the infected lungs or the bone marrow. BCL6 robustly bound to the Casp3 and Pmaip3 loci, and to a lesser extent to the Pdcd4 locus, in neutrophils isolated from the infected lungs. the percentage of apoptotic neutrophils (Annexin V+/PI) was higher in BAL fluid and lungs from Bcl6Lyz2 and Bcl6MRP8 mice compared with Bcl6fl/fl mice. inflammatory monocyte apoptosis remained unchanged (Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Fig. S3E) apoptosis stained with Annexin V and PI in the bone marrow (B) and blood (C) at 2 dpi. the percentages of apoptotic neutrophils (Annexin V+ PI) are shown. Bcl6MRP8 or Bcl6fl/fl mice with influenza A/X31 (X31, H3N2) strain assessed neutrophil apoptosis in the BAL fluid and lung but not in bone marrow or blood. results demonstrate that BCL6 deficiency-promoted lung neutrophil apoptosis is not viral strain-specific. pulmonary inflammation following IAV infection has been missing. we partially depleted pulmonary neutrophils during the early phase of IAV infection. the limited anti-Ly6G\u2013based neutrophil depletion caused roughly 50% decrease in the number of lung neutrophils without affecting inflammatory monocytes during infection. neutrophils are the first responders to infiltrate the sites of infection to clear bacterial infections. increased tissue neutrophil apoptosis caused by BCL6 deficiency may increase pulmonary bacterial burden and worsen outcome during certain respiratory bacterial infections. noxa is a BH3-only protein that can bind and trigger proteasome-mediated degradation of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1 (myeloid cell factor 1) (40), which plays essential roles in neutrophil survival (38, 41) lung neutrophils express higher Noxa levels than blood and bone marrow neutrophils in WT mice, whereas BCL6 deficiency further increases Noxa expression specifically in the lungs. further studies are needed to test this possibility Bcl6Lyz2 and Bcl6fl/fl mice were infected with lethal PR8, and host mortality was monitored. all Bcl6Lyz2 mice survived, whereas all Bcl6Lyz2 mice survived. data are representative of two independent experiments. a recent report has suggested that BCL6 inhibition in macrophages could lead to enhanced type I IFN production on vesicular stomatitis virus infection. deficiency of Ifnar1 could affect the outcomes, we treated Bcl6Lyz2 and Bcl6fl/fl mice with either IFNAR1-blocking or control antibody before and after PR8 infection. ifnar1 treatment did not alter the morbidity of Bcl6Lyz2 or Bcl6fl/fl mice compared with control antibody treatment. myeloid BCL6 promotes pulmonary inflammation following IAV infection. Bcl6Lyz2 and Bcl6fl/fl mice were infected with sublethal PR8. inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly decreased in the BAL fluid of Bcl6Lyz2 mice, particularly at 4 and 10 dpi. these data suggest that myeloid BCL6 deficiency diminishes pulmonary inflammation following IAV infection in vivo. 11c mice in which BCL6 was disrupted in CD11c-expressing alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells. we crossed Bcl6fl/fl mice to CX3CR1-cre transgenic mice. Interestingly, Bcl6CD11c and Bcl6CX3CR1 mice lost comparable amounts of weight compared with their WT littermate controls following PR8 infection. Bcl6MRP8 and Bcl6fl/fl mice were infected with lethal PR8. host mortality was monitored. neutrophils expressed detectable BCL6 following staining with BCL6 Ab. we crossed Bcl6fl/fl mice with MRP8-cre mice to generate Bcl6MRP8 mice to delete BCL6 in neutrophils. 80% of Bcl6fl/fl mice succumbed to lethal PR8 infection. BCL6 represses apoptotic gene expression in neutrophils of lungs following IAV infection. 133 genes were down-regulated and 294 genes were up-regulated in neutrophils vs. WT neutrophils. mRNA expression (normalized log2) of core genes from apoptosis gene sets in lung neutrophils from Bcl6MRP8 and Bcl6fl/fl mice. red and blue represent overexpressed and underexpressed genes. CL6 suppresses proinflammatory mediators in macrophages, possibly through inhibition of NF-B transcriptional activity. overall protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly lower in the lungs of BCL6-deficient mice. decreased pulmonary inflammation observed in Bcl6MRP8 mice may be related to decreased neutrophil numbers but not to diminished expression of inflammatory cytokines. BCL6-deficient neutrophils isolated from the blood or bone marrow showed comparable expression as their WT counterparts. we first examined BCL6 expression levels in the bone marrow, blood, and infected lungs. we found that neutrophils in the bone marrow and blood had comparable BCL6 expression to that of their counterparts in the lungs, kidney, and liver. bone marrow neutrophils expressed robust BCL6. BCL6 regulates apoptotic gene expression in tissue neutrophils. previous studies have shown that IAV infection induces neutrophil apoptosis. we also assessed active caspase 3/7 activity in neutrophils following PR8 infection. BCL6 deficiency resulted in increased caspase 3/7 activity in the respiratory tract but not in the bone marrow. n.d., not detected. n.s., not significant. no significant differences in percentage of apoptotic neutrophils in bone marrow or blood were observed. a difference in neutrophil survival contributes to neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of Bcl6MRP8 and Bcl6fl/fl mice. to determine whether a difference in neutrophil survival contributes to neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of both groups. we measured cytokine and chemokine levels in the BAL fluid of mice treated with or without anti-Ly6G. inflammatory cytokines and chemokines decreased in the BAL fluid of anti-Ly6G\u2013treated mice. these data suggest that excessive accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs drives an exaggerated inflammatory response and increases disease severity following IAV infection. neutrophils may contribute to viral clearance and adaptive immunity (3, 6, 35) the precise roles of neutrophil BCL6 in modulating differential disease outcomes following respiratory infections may ultimately depend on the type of pathogen. a key question is why the enhanced neutrophil death following BCL6 deficiency is restricted to the lungs and does not occur in the blood or bone marrow. cologic agents target neutrophil survival and function in the tissue may be promising to decrease host inflammation and minimize lung injury. the animals, virus infection, experimental setup, sample collection, and statistical analysis are described in detail in SI Appendix."}
