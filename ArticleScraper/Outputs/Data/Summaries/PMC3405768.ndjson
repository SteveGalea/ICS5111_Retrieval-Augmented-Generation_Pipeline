{"summary": "annual epidemics of seasonal influenza result in about 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and 250 000\u2013500 000 deaths worldwide. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection and severe outcomes. studies suggest that the vaccination of HCWs has substantial economic benefits, including reduced absenteeism from work and the extra costs of sick leave and staff replacement. questionnaires were collected immediately by the investigator or returned by mail to the research team using Freepost addressed envelopes. questionnaire completion was anonymous so that it was not possible to follow up non-response. 188/508 respondents (370%) reported receiving a vaccination in the previous season with 449% never receiving a vaccination during the last 5 years. there was no significant difference in the sub-scores of MHLC between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. the model contained five independent variables (knowledge score, risk perception and three sub-scores of MHLC) the full model containing all predictors was statistically significant (2=4415, d.f.=5, P0001; n=522), indicating that the model was able to distinguish between vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents. the strongest predictor of vaccination status was the risk perception score, recording an odds ratio of 176. of the 458 respondents assigned to clusters, 195 (426%) were assigned to the first cluster, 143 (312%) to the second and 120 (262%) to the third. cluster 2 contained those unvaccinated in the previous season with no vaccination intent next season. the never vaccinated had the lowest knowledge score, risk perception score and powerful others sub-score of MHLC compared to the other clusters (P0001, P0001, P=0020, respectively) for the unvaccinated, there were no significant differences across any variable for the newly vaccinated and continuously vaccinated clusters. 862% (162/188) of vaccinated and 822% (263/320) of unvaccinated respondents provided at least one reason for being vaccinated. 649% (122/188) of the vaccinated and 772% (247/320) of the unvaccinated provided at least one reason for not being vaccinated. direct logistic regression was performed to assess the impact of a number of factors on the likelihood that respondents had been vaccinated in the previous season. the full model containing all predictors was statistically significant (2=4415, d.f.=5, P0001; n=522). the model explained between 87% (Cox & Snell's R2) and 119% (Nagelkerke's R2) of the variance in vaccination status. of the 458 respondents assigned to clusters, 195 (426%) were assigned to the first cluster, 143 (312%) to the second and 120 (262%) to the third. cluster 2 contained those unvaccinated in the previous season with no vaccination intent next season. the never vaccinated had the lowest knowledge score, risk perception score and powerful others sub-score of MHLC compared to the other clusters. for the unvaccinated, there were no significant differences across any variable except for the MHLC \u2018powerful others\u2019 sub-score (P=0008) ted usually had higher scores than those of the continuously vaccinated except for one item, i.e. the vaccination of recommended groups. there was a significant difference in one risk perception item, i.e. personal vulnerability to illness (P=0001). Those never vaccinated had a lower score for this item than those who used to be vaccinated. two-step cluster analysis found that vaccination behaviours in nurses were more complex requiring an analysis of both vaccinated and unvaccinated nurses' behaviours. a lack of knowledge about influenza and vaccination was a strong predictor of nurses' vaccination behaviours, especially for those never vaccinated. this cluster had the lowest knowledge score, suggesting that increasing their knowledge might improve their vaccination behaviours. future studies are required to explore the relationship between the content and timings of vaccination campaigns and nurses' first vaccination uptake. but perceptions of the negative consequences of contracting influenza and severity of influenza were not major factors, a finding which is consistent with previous studies [16]. this suggests future educational campaigns might be more effective if they focus on the negative personal consequences of contracting influenza and its sequelae rather than nurses' professional duty to protect patients or other vulnerable groups. studies are needed to explore what may influence this pattern of health locus of control in order to modify nurses' vaccination behaviours. some organizations have recently required mandatory seasonal influenza vaccination for HCWs as a professional and ethical obligation to protect their patients' health. however, ethical issues have been raised with mandatory vaccination because it challenges HCWs' personal autonomy and freedom of choice. for the statistical advice of Peter Milligan."}
