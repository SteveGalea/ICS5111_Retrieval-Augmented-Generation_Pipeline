{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a new respiratory virus that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in september 2012. the outbreak extended to other countries in the Arabian Peninsula followed by another outbreak in Korea in may 2015. at least 26 countries have reported MERS cases as of June 18, 2015. the 3I tool is designed for use in EDs affiliated with an inpatient facility. it can be used in outpatient settings such as urgent care clinics, physicians\u2019 offices and prehospital environments. dromedary (one-hump) camels are strongly linked to having a role as a reservoir for zoonotic transmission to humans. dromedary (one-hump) camels are strongly linked to having a role as a reservoir for zoonotic transmission to humans. work-up MERS can be confirmed at a state or CDC laboratory. serum antibody titers can be measured for both acute infection as well as evidence of prior exposure and immunity. the key action is to identify a potential exposure within 14 days prior to symptom onset. Identify-Isolate-Inform is a tool developed for measles and ARDS. the tool could be accessed real-time on a triage nurse\u2019s computer screen or printed as a poster for display in the triage area. a surgical mask should be placed on such patients and they should be directed to an airborne infection isolation room. if airborne isolation is not available, the patient should be placed in a private room until transfer to an appropriate facility can be arranged. the final action of the tool is to \"inform\" the u.s. CDC endorses airborne precautions (N95 respirators or equivalent) for all circumstances. some would argue that, to avoid transmission, it is better to be more conservative. this approach is not without downsides as, if the virus becomes more widespread, it could result in shortages of respirators. MERS-CoV infection presents as a nonspecific acute respiratory illness. patients typically have fever, cough and shortness of breath. patients may develop pneumonia, ARDS and renal failure. there is a strong likelihood that dromedary (one-hump) camels serve as a reservoir for zoonotic transmission to humans. this has resulted in warnings to avoid close contact with camels and not drink raw camel milk or urine, or ingest raw camel meat. the key action is to identify a potential exposure within 14 days prior to symptom onset at initial patient presentation so that MERS can be considered. drugs for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome such as beta interferons and protease inhibitors are reported to be under investigation. the incubation period for MERS ranges from 2\u201314 days, typically about 5\u20136 days. this is the reason for screening for risk factors within 14 days prior to symptom onset. it is likely to spread via an infected person\u2019s respiratory secretions. dromedary camels are strongly linked to having a role as a MERS-CoV reservoir and source of zoonotic transmission to humans. people who have had close contact with infected dromedary camels within 14 days before symptom onset are at risk for contracting MERS. drugs for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome are under investigation. there are currently no approved specific treatments or vaccines for MERS. travelers to regions where MERS has been detected should avoid close contact with potentially infected persons. the 3I tool provides a concise and simplified version of exposure types coupled with symptoms for both severe and milder illness. if a patient is not identified as having an exposure risk coupled with symptoms, triage may proceed as usual. an assessment of the home environment must first be performed. the patient needs to be reliable and compliant with home isolation. the health department can assist with providing such patients with appropriate public health monitoring. the question of when to use the public health tools of quarantine and isolation is critical. in general quarantine of asymptomatic patients is only beneficial in cases where the infected person is contagious prior to the onset of symptoms."}
