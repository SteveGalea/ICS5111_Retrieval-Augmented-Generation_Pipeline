{"summary": "the geographical area of WNV circulation encompasses most of Africa, Israel, North America and South America, Australia and scattered areas in southern and central Europe. lineage 1 includes most of the American, European and some African strains, while lineage 2 contains mostly sub-Saharan African isolates. a sixth lineage was recently described in Indonesia and a putative seventh lineage has been identified in Spain [11] four external quality assessment studies have been performed. two for the molecular diagnostics of WNV infections and two for the serological methods. the results are presented at the end of this review. a screening policy has been implemented in areas where human cases of WNV related diseases are known to be present. the first is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology and the second is a transcription mediated amplification (TMA) test [30] available from Novartis Diagnostics (Emeryville, CA, USA) the specificity of these methods is considered quite high [32,33] but false positive reactions were reported due to the presence of Usutu (USUV), a virus closely related to WNV [34,35]. the use of pan-specific RTPCR techniques can potentially differentiate WNV related disease from other infections caused by flaviviruses. the amplicons obtained using these labour intensive methods need to be sequenced and the obtained electropherograms analysed to identify the infecting virus. new multiplex RT-PCR assays have been developed to facilitate simultaneous identification of multiple arboviruses. the detection of WNV antigen using histochemical protocols in tissues obtained from fatal encephalitis cases has been available for diagnostic purposes for many years. serological methods can be subdivided into two main groups. the first includes the immunofluorescence based tests. the second includes the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test. PRNT90 assay, by definition, is less sensitive than the PRNT50 assay. it is more appropriate for studies that involve the detection of immune responses in individuals that have presented with clinically apparent infection. it is important to emphasise that in either of these analyses, the test should follow the guidelines of the world health organization [58] both PRNT90 and PRNT50 require evaluation of the NAbs against a panel of related viruses. the following viruses, grown either in mammalian cell lines e.g., vero E6 or mosquito-derived cells such as C6/36, should be included for differential diagnostic purposes and to act as the controls for cross-reactivity reactions. the HIA test requires treatment of each serum to remove non-specific inhibitors. the HIA test requires treatment of each serum to remove non-specific inhibitors. the test specificity and sensitivity suffer from the lack of standardization of antigenic preparations obtained from different sources. most serological diagnostic tests are performed by EIA and IF which are both technically simpler to perform. these methods can be subdivided into three main categories: the IgM antibody-capture EIA (MAC-EIA) and the indirect IgG EIA. the use of highly specific antigens, such as the epitopes located in the domain III of the E protein [88], the whole recombinant E protein produced in insect larvae [89], the Virus-Like Particles from preM and E proteins [90,91], the NS1, 3 and 5 proteins [92,93] have been proposed with promising results in order to increase the standardization of the antigen preparation and to reduce the costs of these assays. all cases of positive IgG detected by this technique need to be further evaluated and confirmed. the reported specificity and sensitivity values for the most commonly used commercially available IgG EIA techniques are about 92%\u201393% and 97%\u201398% respectively. this technique is only applicable in populations not previously exposed to flaviviruses other than WNV. previous vaccination against JEV is another possible confounding factor for the interpretation of the results. the use of the IF assay in routine diagnosis of WNV infection is mainly dependent on the number of samples that need to be evaluated. MAC-EIA, Indirect IgG EIA, IF, virus isolation, RT-PCR, Real time RT-PCR, PRNT90 Evaluation of seroprevalence (serum and/or plasma) PRNT50; Indirect IgG EIA, IF; Epitope blocking EIA Screening of blood and organ donations (serum or plasma) NATs. compared to the first EQA performed in 2006, only 30% of participating laboratories passed the minimum requirements for successful performance. this result is mainly explained by the high rate of cross-reactivity with sera positive for related Abs. also the low sensitivity for IgM detection results in a risk of overlooking WNV acute infections. the diversity and continuous evolution of circulating strains require regular revision of the molecular assays."}
