{"summary": "IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins 1, 2, and 3 were among the first IFN-stimulated genes to be identified. IFITM proteins are approximately 130 amino acids in length and are conserved in most vertebrate species (3). despite a wealth of in vitro data, the antiviral effects of IFITM3 in vivo are less well characterized. despite a wealth of in vitro data, the antiviral effects of IFITM3 in vivo are less well characterized. ectopic expression of IFITMs appears to alter the physical characteristics of the endosome, resulting in increased size, reduced membrane fluidity, and increased cholesterol content. alphaviruses are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses of the Togaviridae family, many of which are transmitted by mosquitoes. infection by encephalitic alphaviruses, including VEEV, eastern, and Western equine encephalitis viruses, causes severe febrile illness associated with infection and injury to neurons, encephalitis, long-term debilitating neurological sequelae. there are no licensed alphavirus vaccines available for use in humans. Ifitm3/ mice inoculated with CHIKV sustained higher viral burdens in the spleen, serum, and joint tissues at early times after infection. this was associated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased joint swelling along with greater replication in some tissues. four-week-old mice were inoculated in the left footpad with 103 focus-forming units (FFU) of CHIKV-LR in 10 l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) organs were harvested, weighed, and homogenized to determine viral titers by a focus-forming assay. cell surface antigens CD45, CD3, CD19, CD3, Ly6G, Ly6C, CD11b, CD11c, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, and F4/80 were detected using biotinylated humanized CHK-152 and murine CHK-166 (54), respectively. secondary staining was followed with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 647 (Invitrogen) primary WT, Ifitm-del, Ifitm2/, and Ifitm3/ transformed MEFs were incubated with lentiviral supernatants. the inoculum was replaced with complete DMEM 24 h later and incubated at 37\u00b0C. CHIKV-LR (La Reunion OPY1 p142) strain was a gift from Kansas State University. VEEV-TC83 was a gift from W. Klimstra (University of Pittsburgh) PCR conditions for both Ifitm2 WT and KO alleles were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 3 min, 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 1 min 30 s, for 35 cycles, and 70\u00b0C for 10 min. WT, Ifitm2/, Ifitm3/, and Ifitm-del MEFs were seeded in a 96-well plate. after 6 h of incubation with IFN- at various doses, MEFs were lysed. anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Chemical), anti-rabbit-IRDye 800CW (Li-Cor; 926-32214) were used instead of HRP conjugates. polyclonal rabbit anti-Ifitm3 (Proteintech; 11714-1-AP) was used for Ifitm3 detection. e or human IgG antibody (Life Technologies) was used for secondary antibody staining. samples were processed by flow cytometry using a BD FACSArray cytometer. cells were plated (105 cells per well in a 12-well plate) and in experiments pretreated with specified doses of IFN- for 12 h. MEFs were rinsed and then incubated with DMEM, supplemented with 0.2% FBS, 10 mM HEPES and 20 mM NH4Cl, on ice for 15 min. unbound virus was removed after several rinses with chilled medium. medium then was replaced with warmed DMEM-10% FBS-10 mM HEPES supplemented with 20 mM NH4Cl. all data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) Viral infection assays in cell culture were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's multiple-comparison test or Student's t test. qRT-PCR assays were analyzed by the log rank test. four-week-old mice were inoculated in the left footpad with 106 FFU of VEEV-TC83-A3G in 10 l of PBS. organs were harvested, weighed, and homogenized to determine viral titers by a focus-forming assay. ine CHK-166 (54), with biotinylated humanized virus (WNV) E16 and murine WNV E60 (55, 56) serving as isotype controls. secondary staining followed with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 647 (Invitrogen) SV2 polyomavirus encodes the large T antigen of SV2 polyomavirus (58), and passaged 10 times. all MEFs were cultured in complete DMEM, which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 mM. CHIKV-LR (La Reunion OPY1 p142) strain was a gift from S. Higgs. SINV (Toto) was a gift from C. Rice and P. MacDonald. VEEV-TC83 was a gift from W. Klimstra (University of Pittsburgh) the IFITM-del allele was determined using the following primers (52). PCR conditions for both Ifitm-del and KO were as follows. qRT-PCR measurement of Ifitm genes. MEFs were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. proteins of interest were detected with mouse anti-actin (CST; 8H10D10), mouse anti-c-Myc (Sigma; 9E10), goat anti-Ifitm3 (R & D; AF337), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Chemical) and anti- polyclonal rabbit anti-Ifitm3 (Proteintech; 11714-1-AP) was used for Ifitm3 detection. the cells were inoculated with a given alphavirus (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 5). cells were chilled on ice for 10 min, exposed to CHIKV-LR at an MOI of 5, and incubated on ice for 1 h. to determine binding efficiency of virus, MEFs were lysed with RNeasy lysis buffer (Qiagen) and RNA was extracted by qRT-PCR. MEFs were rinsed and then incubated with DMEM, supplemented with 0.2% FBS, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3) and 20 mM NH4Cl, on ice for 15 min. unbound virus was removed after several rinses with chilled medium. medium then was replaced with warmed DMEM-10% FBS-10 mM HEPES supplemented with 20 mM NH4Cl. assays were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. qRT-PCR assays were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS Restriction of alphaviruses by Ifitm proteins in cell culture. Ifitm3/ and Ifitm-del MEFs infected with CHIKV produced higher titers of infectious virus than did WT or Ifitm2/ cells. CHIKV infection is enhanced in cells lacking Ifitm3 expression. bars show the means and standard errors of the means (SEM) from five independent experiments performed in quadruplicate or duplicate. Means were compared between control and IFN--treated cells using a nonparametric one-way ANOVA with Dunn's multiple comparisons. CHIKV, Ifitm3/, and Ifitm-del MEFs were pretreated with various doses of IFN- and infected with SFV, ONNV, VEEV (strain TC-83), and SINV at an MOI of 5. at 14 h postinfection, MEFs were stained for viral E2 proteins and analyzed by flow cytometry. c-Myc-tagged firefly luciferase and Ifitm3 were cloned into the pFCIV vector and introduced into WT, Ifitm3/, and Ifitm-del MEFs via lentiviral transduction. successful transduction determined by staining for c-Myc tag by flow cytometry. firefly luciferase (detected with anti-c-Myc antibody) and Ifitm3 (detected with anti-Ifitm3 antibody) were infected for 6 h in the absence of IFN- with CHIKV 181/25 at an MOI of 5. CHIKV-LR was bound to firefly luciferase or Ifitm3-transcomplemented MEFs for 1 h on ice, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. proteinase K treatment significantly decreased the level of cell-bound viral RNA. FFWO assay of CHIKV 181/25 on transcomplemented MEFs. CHIKV was bound to cells on ice for 2 h, followed by treatment with neutral (pH 7.4) or acidic (pH 5.5) medium at 37\u00b0C for 2 min to induce fusion. Ifitm3-transcomplemented MEFs had lower levels of CHIKV antigen than luciferase-expressing controls in WT, Ifitm3/, and Ifitm-del MEFs. the expression of Ifitm3 also inhibits pH-dependent fusion of alphaviruses. at day 2, the titers in the spleen, serum, and ipsilateral ankle were similar. but levels in the contralateral ankle and contralateral quadriceps muscle were somewhat higher. by day 3, no differences in viral titer were observed in any tissues between WT and Ifitm3/ mice. the early higher viral burden in Ifitm3/ mice corresponded to higher levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in the ipsilateral ankle.

Ifitm3 protects against VEEV pathogenesis. four-week-old WT and Ifitm3/ mice were infected with 106 FFU of VEEV-TC83-A3G in the footpad. data are pooled from two independent experiments (n = 19 to 21) MEFs were first pretreated with 1 IU/ml of recombinant mouse IFN- to induce Ifitm gene expression. Ifitm3 protein induction was confirmed by Western blotting in WT and Ifitm2/ MEFs after IFN- treatment. ifitm3 protein induction was confirmed by Western blotting in WT and Ifitm2/ MEFs after IFN- treatment. CHIKV infection is enhanced in cells lacking Ifitm3 expression. WT, Ifitm2/, Ifitm3/, and Ifitm-del MEFs were generated from mice. bars show the means and standard errors of the means (SEM) from five independent experiments performed in quadruplicate or duplicate. Means were compared between WT and deficient cell lines using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons. experiments with CHIKV, WT and Ifitm-del MEFs were pretreated with various doses of IFN-. they were infected with SFV, ONNV, VEEV (strain TC-83), and SINV compared to WT cells. at 14 h postinfection, MEFs were stained for viral E2 proteins. c-Myc-tagged firefly luciferase and Ifitm3 were cloned into the pFCIV vector and introduced into WT, Ifitm3/, and Ifitm-del MEFs via lentiviral transduction. successful transduction was determined by staining for c-Myc tag by flow cytometry. studies with IAV have shown that IFITM3 prevents fusion of virions from the late endosome. correspondingly, IFITM3 is expressed preferentially on membranes of intracellular vesicles, including endosomes (9) but following gene upregulation, such as after IFN induction or ectopic expression, IFITM3 can accumulate on the plasma membrane (18, 65, 66) CHIKV-LR was bound to firefly luciferase or Ifitm3-transcomplemented MEFs for 1 h on ice. total RNA was isolated and analyzed for CHIKV RNA by qRT-PCR. data are representative of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. FFWO is affected by ectopic expression of Ifitm3. MEFs were preincubated with CHIKV at 4\u00b0C, washed to remove unbound virus, then incubated with prewarmed medium at pH 7.4 or pH 5.5. edema and cellular infiltrates were observed in ipsilateral ankle joints of Ifitm3/ mice. greater swelling was observed in ipsilateral ankle joints of Ifitm3/ mice. at day 2 after inoculation, serum, spleen, and ipsilateral ankle had higher viral titers. data were pooled from two independent experiments. each point represents one mouse (n = 8 to 10) the dotted line represents the limit of detection. Ifitm3 contributes to restriction of early viral infection and spread, which impacts cytokine induction and clinical disease.

Detailed gating strategy for different cell subsets is shown. ak infected 4-week-old WT and Ifitm3/ mice with a previously described moderately pathogenic encephalitic alphavirus strain. VEEV-TC83-A3G is resistant to the antiviral effects of another ISG, Ifit1 (46) Ifitm3/ mice exhibited greater mortality (Fig. 7A) and morbidity (as judged by weight loss) VEEV viral burden of serum, spleen, liver, inguinal lymph nodes (iLN), popliteal lymph nodes (pLN), brain, and spinal cord at days 1, 2 and 4 after infection of WT and Ifitm3/ mice. each dot represents one mouse (n = 6 to 10) titers became equivalent in WT and Ifitm3/ mice at early times postinoculation. this suggests possible immune evasion of Ifitm3 by CHIKV. a higher number of macrophages were positive for CHIKV antigen. vivo findings suggest an important role for Ifitm3 in restricting alphavirus pathogenesis in vivo. studies with pseudotyped virions initially suggested that IFITMs had little antiviral activity against CHIKV, SINV, and VEEV. characterization of Ifitm3 as an antiviral ISG against alphaviruses adds to the known host defense genes that block alphavirus infection. a separate genetic screen revealed several unique ISGs with possible antiviral activity against SINV, including Isg20, Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3, and Rsad2 (viperin) a common human allelic IFITM3 variant encodes a 21-amino-acid deletion of the protein that appears to be associated with susceptibility to IAV infection. it remains to be determined whether this or other polymorphisms in the IFITM3 gene can be linked to more severe or persistent alphavirus infection."}
