{"summary": "310 thousand people were hospitalized because of influenza-related illness during the 2015-2016 influenza season. vaccine and antiviral drugs are the major countermeasures against influenza virus infection. current antiviral drugs including M2 and neuraminidase protein inhibitors would be limited by the appearance of resistant viruses. indirubin, a bisindole alkaloid, is the main active ingredient of Isatis indigotica. it inhibited the production of the chemokine regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted in human bronchial epithelial cells infected with influenza virus. indirubin also shows the anti-inflammatory effect as it inhibits the inflammatory reactions of delayed-type hypersensitivity. oseltamivir, indirubin-H and indirubin-L reduced the morbidity to 38% (P 0.01), 50% (P 0.05) and 79% respectively. oseltamivir, indirubin-H and indirubin-L treatment significantly improved the survival rate to 92% (P 0.01). data were obtained from 10 - 14 animals in each group. Indirubin protects against pneumonia caused by influenza infection in stressed mice. the lung tissues were removed on the 5th day after influenza virus challenge. indirubin-H and Indirubin-L respectively represent the higher dose of indirubin (5 mgkg1d1) and the lower dose of indirubin (2.5 mgkg1d1) the difference was considered statistically significant at P 0.05, P 0.01 vs. normal group; #P 0.05, **P 0.01 vs. Virus group. indirubin promotes IFN- generation through MAVS antiviral signaling after influenza infection in stressed mice. NP level indicates replication state of influenza virus. indirubin treatment obviously reduced NP protein level (P 0.01) Indirubin treatment elevated MAVS expression and promoted the phosphorylation of IRF3 in the lung tissues. on the contrary, NF-B expression was reduced by indirubin. indirubin promotes IFN- generation through MAVS antiviral signaling after influenza infection in stressed mice. 10 M of indirubin was chosen to explore the influence of indirubin on MAVS antiviral signaling. the protein expressions of MAVS, p-IRF3, IFN- and IFITM3 were remarkably declined in CORT-loaded A549 cells following influenza virus infection. indirubin treatment reduced NP protein level in cells treated with CORT plus virus. indirubin STING is a protein located in endoplasmic reticulum reticular. it is involved in the regulation of IFN- production by indirubin. the carbonyl at C-3 and C-2\u2032 of indirubin act as hydrogen bond acceptors. data are expressed as mean SEM from 3 independent determinations. results of western blotting showed that STING protein expression was increased in cells following H1N1 infection. but it declined when cells were pre-treated with CORT. indirubin treatment maintained mitochondrial morphology and MAVS expression and location. indirubin (10 M) treatment significantly prevented the decrease of MMP. oseltamivir, indirubin-H and indirubin-L treatment significantly improved the survival rate to 92% (P 0.01), 64% and 57% (P 0.05), respectively. oseltamivir, indirubin-H and indirubin-L treatment significantly improved the survival rate to 92% (P 0.01). indirubin attenuates the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza infection in stressed mice. effects of indirubin on body weight changes (B), morbidity (C) and survival rate (D) of mice after influenza infection. oseltamivir, indirubin-H and indirubin-L notably decreased it to 9.7 1.4 mgg1 (P 0.01), 9.3 4.1 mgg1 (P 0.05) and 12.0 1.8 mgg1 respectively. indirubin protects against pneumonia caused by influenza infection in stressed mice. the expression levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6 and TNF- of lungs increased. however, a modest attenuation of IL-1 occurred in the groups of indirubin-H and indirubin-L treatment. indirubin treatment induced an elevated production of IL-10. indirubin treatment elevated MAVS expression and promoted phosphorylation of IRF3 in the lung tissues. NF-B expression was reduced by indirubin, indicating other intracellular pathways are also involved. indirubin promotes IFN- generation through MAVS antiviral signaling after influenza infection in CORT-loaded A549 cells. indirubin at 7.5 M and 10 M inhibited influenza virus replication. the protein expressions of MAVS, p-IRF3, IFN- and IFITM3 were remarkably declined in CORT-loaded A549 cells following influenza virus infection. RF3 (B), NF-B, IFN- and IFITM3 (C) in A549 cells. the difference was considered statistically significant at P 0.05, P 0.01 vs. normal group; #P 0.05, ##P 0.01 vs. Virus group; *P 0.05, **P 0.01 vs. CORT+Virus group. the structure of indirubin bound to STING (A) is favorable. blue spheres represented THR266 residue and THR266 residue of STING protein. mitochondrial morphology and function of mitochondria play an important role in MAVS signal transduction [22]. mitochondrial morphology and function of mitochondria play an important role in MAVS signal transduction. indirubin treatment maintained mitochondrial morphology and MAVS expression and location. the morphology of mitochondria and the location of MAVS in A549 cells was observed by the transfection of pAcGFP1-Mito Vector. the immunofluorescence of MAVS (C) was determined by flow cytometry using JC-1 staining (D). mice suffered from sickness in a certain proportion after intranasal administration of influenza virus. restraint stress significantly aggravated the morbidity. in contrast, indirubin remarkably improved the sickness symptoms. IL-1 mediates acute pulmonary inflammatory pathology in experimental human infection. indirubin treatment lessened production of TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6. indirubin exerted an anti-inflammation effect. indirubin improved viral pneumonia in restraint-stressed mice. indirubin treatment significantly restored the expression of MAVS and promoted the phosphorylation of IRF3 in stressed mice and CORT-loaded A549 cells infected with influenza virus. indirubin treatment was found a candidate target of indirubin. mitochondria change morphology through membrane fission and fusion, and Mfn2 plays a decisive role in the process. previous research found mitochondrial morphology was drastically changed by overexpression of Mfn2 resulting in small fragmented mitochondria. indirubin recovered the mitochondrial network and promoted MAVS signaling. indirubin is found to promote MAVS signaling by regulating STING following influenza A virus infection. indirubin attenuates NF-B dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production. in the first animal experiment, mice were distributed at random to six groups. normal, Virus, \u201cStress+Virus\u201d, \u201cOseltamivir+Stress+Virus\u201d and two indirubin groups were administered orally to mice for seven days. on the 3rd day, mice were anesthetized using diethyl ether vapor and immediately infected with influenza A virus suspension (2LD50) mice were distributed at random to four groups: normal, Virus, \u201cStress+Virus\u201d and \u201cindirubin+Stress+Virus\u201d. the following treatment was the same as the second experiment. cell culture and treatment A549 cells were cultured in DMEM.
