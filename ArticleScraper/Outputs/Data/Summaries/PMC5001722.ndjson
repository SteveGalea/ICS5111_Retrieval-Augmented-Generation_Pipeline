{"summary": "recognition of viral infection by host cells induces the synthesis of type I IFNs. secreted IFNs interact with IFN receptors on target cells. a signal cascade involves Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) families. bcH8, and Herc5 are IFN-inducible [4, 6, 10, 11] antiviral responses involving protein ISGylation have been reported against diverse viruses. cellular proteins involved in antiviral signaling were also identified or suggested as substrates for ISGylation. ISGylation disrupted its association with importin-, which mediates the nuclear import of NS1A, thus inhibiting viral replication. an ISGylation-independent antiviral effect of ISG15 was also demonstrated in Chikungunya virus infection [44]. IE proteins and virion-associated tegument proteins play key roles in initiating viral gene expression. HCMV employs several mechanisms to counteract IFN production. IE2 and pp65 inhibit IFN production and subsequent ISG activation. time course of ISG15 expression and protein ISGylation during HCMV infection were investigated with different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) in human fibroblast (HF) cells infected with HCMV (Towne), the levels of ISG15 and protein ISGylation were elevated by 24 h at all MOIs tested (MOIs of 0.2 to 10). levels of free ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates were much lower than those at low MOIs. HF cells were mock-infected (M) or infected with HCMV or UV-HCMV at different MOIs (0.2 to 10) as indicated. cell lysates were prepared at 24, 48, and 72 h after infection. the levels of ISG15 in uninfected neighboring cells were higher in HCMV infection than in UV-HCMV infection (Fig 1B). this result suggests that an indirect effect of virus infection on neighboring uninfected cells is responsible for the greater induction of ISG15 and protein ISGylation by HCMV than by UV-HCMV at low MOIs. HF cells were mock-infected (M) or infected with wild-type HCMV, UV-HCMV, or CR208 virus at an MOI of 3. control and IE1-expressing HF cells produced by retroviral vectors were mock-infected or infected with wild-type HCMV, UV-HCMV, or CR208 virus at an MOI of 3. t was performed with anti-myc, anti-IE1, and anti-actin antibodies. we also compared levels of ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates in HCMV, UV-HCMV, and CR208 infection. the delayed induction of ISGylation is similar to what was observed in IFN-treated cells [68]. control and IE1-overexpressing HF cells were infected with HCMV, UV-HCMV, or CR208. results of immunoblot analysis showed IE1 overexpression suppressed the induction of ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates by both virus infection and IFN treatment (as a control) ISGylation inhibits HCMV growth by silencing expression of ISGylation enzymes. HF cells expressing control shRNA or shRNA for UBP43 were generated using lentiviral vectors. control and UBP43 knockdown HF cells were infected or not with UV-HCMV at an MOI of 3. at 24 h after infection, cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies for ISG15 and -actin. at 9 days after infection, virus titers in the culture supernatants were measured by infectious center assays. qRT-PCR assays confirmed the efficient reduction of Herc5 transcript levels in cells expressing shRNAs (shHerc5-1 and shHerc5-2) compared to in cells expressing control shRNA (shC) after UV-HCMV infection. similar enhancement of HCMV growth was observed in HF cells depleted of UBE1L (E1) or UbcH8 (E2). of ISG15AA did not significantly affect levels of ISG15 conjugates or progeny virions. we first compared expression profile of viral proteins in control and Herc5 knockdown cells. at an MOI of 1, levels of viral proteins were comparable between control and Herc5 knockdown cells. cell lysates were immunoblotted at the indicated time points with antibodies for IE1/IE2, p52, pp28 (encoded by UL99), p52, pp28 (encoded by UL99), and -actin (A) at an MOI of 1 or 5. at 4 days after infection, virus titers produced within the cells (cell-associated) and in the culture supernatants were determined by infectious center assays. HCMV knockdown cells were infected with HCMV at an MOI of 1 or 5. the percentages of cell-associated virions to total virions were lower in herc5-knockdown cells, 3.5% (MOI 1) and 3.8% (MOI 5), than in control cells, 19.7% (MOI 1) and 17% (MOI 5). UL26-p21 interacted with ISG15AA, demonstrating that ISG15 can non-covalently interact with UL26. in similar co-IP assays, UL26-p21 also interacted with UBE1L and Herc5, but not UbcH8. pUL26-p21 interacts with ISG15 during virus infection. HF cells were infected with wild-type HCMV (Toledo) or its recombinant virus expressing UL26-HA proteins at an MOI of 3 for 48 h. whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-ISG15 and anti-UL26 antibodies. HF cells were mock-infected or infected with recombinant virus expressing UL26-HA proteins. cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-ISG15 antibody as in (G) cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody as in (J) it has been suggested newly synthesized viral proteins may be broadly modified by ISG15 during virus infection. smear bands of ISGylated UL26 appear to be UL26 proteins that contain ISG15-ubiquitin mixed chains or poly-ISG15 chains. some viral proteins, which did not interact with ISG15, UBE1L, and Herc5 in co-IP assays, could be ISGylated in co-IP assays. HF cells expressing wild-type UL26-p21 or K136/169R mutant were generated by retroviral vectors. expression level of the K136/169R mutant protein was higher than that of the wild-type protein. lysine residues of UL26-p21 from Towne strain and their conservation in other human (Toledo, Ad169, and Merlin) are shown. lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies for IE1/IE2, UL26, and -actin (D) cells were treated or not with 50 ng/ml of TNF for the indicated times. the levels of p65 and its phosphorylated form were also shown. ISGylation of UL26 inhibits its activity to downregulate NF-B signaling. UL26 inhibits protein ISGylation since influenza virus NS1B antagonizes ISGylation in human cells via direct binding to ISG15 [3, 82]. pUL85, pUL71, and IE2 did not inhibit ISGylation by UL26. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids as indicated. expression levels of myc-ISG15, SRT-CHMP5, and -actin in whole cell lysates were also determined by immunoblotting. HF cells expressing control shRNA (shC) or shRNA specific for IE1 (shIE1) were infected with wild-type or UL26 mutant virus at an MOI of 5 for the indicated time points. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies for ISG15, viral proteins (IE1, IE2 and UL26) and -actin. control shRNA (shC) and shIE1-expressing HF cells were infected with wild-type and UL26-deleted mutant viruses at an MOI of 5. UL26-deleted virus less effectively reduced the ISGylation levels than wild-type virus at the late phase of infection. time course of ISG15 expression and protein ISGylation during HCMV infection were investigated with different multiplicity of infections (MOIs) in human fibroblast (HF) cells infected with HCMV (Towne), levels of ISG15 and protein ISGylation were elevated by 24 h at all MOIs tested (MOIs of 0.2 to 10). levels of free ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates at high MOIs were much lower than those at low MOI HF cells were mock-infected (M) or infected with HCMV or UV-HCMV at different MOIs (0.2 to 10) as indicated. cell lysates were prepared at 24, 48, and 72 h after infection. the levels of ISG15 in uninfected neighboring cells were higher in HCMV infection than in UV-HCMV infection (Fig 1B). this result suggests that an indirect effect of virus infection on neighboring uninfected cells is responsible for the greater induction of ISG15 and protein ISGylation by HCMV than by UV-HCMV at low MOIs. HF cells were mock-infected (M) or infected with wild-type HCMV, UV-HCMV, or CR208 virus at an MOI of 3. total RNAs were prepared at the indicated time points and levels of ISG15 and -actin transcripts were determined by RT-PCR (A) cell lysates were also prepared and analysed by immunoblotting. anti-myc, anti-IE1, and anti-actin antibodies. CR208 infection resulted in slightly lower levels of ISGylation. IE1 is required for the suppression of ISG15 expression. control and IE1-overexpressing HF cells were infected with HCMV, UV-HCMV, or CR208. the results of immunoblot analysis showed that IE1 overexpression suppressed the induction of ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates by both virus infection and IFN treatment. HF cells expressing control shRNA or shRNA for UBP43, an ISG15-specific protease, were generated using lentiviral vectors. IFN treatment of normal and control shRNA (shC)-expressing HF cells induced the expression of UBP43 proteins; however, UBP43-specific shRNAs efficiently suppressed this induction. control and UBP43 knockdown HF cells were infected or not with UV-HCMV at an MOI of 3. at 24 h after infection, cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies for ISG15 and -actin. at 5 days after infection, viral supernatants were collected and levels of progeny virions were measured. qRT-PCR assays confirmed the efficient reduction of Herc5 transcript levels in cells expressing shRNAs (shHerc5-1 and shHerc5-2) compared to in cells expressing control shRNA (shC) after UV-HCMV infection. similar enhancement of HCMV growth was observed in HF cells depleted of UBE1L (E1) or UbcH8 (E2). AA did not significantly affect levels of ISG15 conjugates or progeny virions. we first compared expression profile of viral proteins in control and Herc5 knockdown cells. at an MOI of 1, levels of viral proteins were comparable between control and Herc5 knockdown cells. lysates were immunoblotted at the indicated time points with antibodies for IE1/IE2, p52, pp28 (encoded by UL99), p52, pp28 (encoded by UL99), and -actin (A) titers produced in the culture supernatants for 24, 48, and 72 h were determined by infectious center assays (B). at 4 days after infection, virus titers produced within the cells (cell-associated) enhanced ISGylation inhibits the activation of viral promoters. we also assessed whether ISGylation inhibits HCMV virion release. the percentages of cell-associated virions to total virions were lower in herc5 knockdown cells. pUL26 interacted with both ISG15 and UBE1L in co-IP assays. in similar co-IP assays, UL26-p21 also interacted with UBE1L and Herc5. in similar co-IP assays, UL26-p21 also interacted with UBE1L and Herc5. HF cells were infected with wild-type HCMV (Toledo) or its recombinant virus expressing UL26-HA proteins at an MOI of 3 for 48 h. whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-IE1/IE2, anti-HA, and anti-actin antibodies. immunoblotting of whole cell lysates was performed to determine expression levels of each protein. cells were mock-infected or infected as in (J) cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody as in (G) smear bands of ISGylated UL26 appear to be UL26 proteins that contain ISG15-ubiquitin mixed chains or poly-ISG15 chains. some viral proteins, which did not interact with ISG15, UBE1L, and Herc5 in co-IP assays, could be ISGylated in co-transfection/ISGylation assays. HF cells expressing wild-type UL26-p21 or K136/169R mutant were generated by retroviral vectors. expression level of the mutant protein was higher than that of the wild-type protein. lysine residues of UL26-p21 from Towne strain and their conservation in other human (Toledo, Ad169, and Merlin) are shown. lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies for IE1/IE2, UL26, and -actin (D) cells were treated or not with 50 ng/ml of TNF for the indicated times. the levels of p65 and its phosphorylated form were also shown. 15AA did not, suggesting that UL26 inhibits its activity to downregulate NF-B signaling. UL26 inhibits protein ISGylation since influenza virus NS1B antagonizes ISGylation in human cells via direct binding to ISG15. pUL85, pUL71, and IE2 did not inhibit ISGylation by UL26. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids as indicated. expression levels of myc-ISG15, SRT-CHMP5, and -actin in whole cell lysates were also determined by immunoblotting. HF cells expressing control shRNA (shC) or shRNA specific for IE1 (shIE1) were infected with wild-type or UL26 mutant virus at an MOI of 5 for the indicated time points. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies for ISG15, viral proteins (IE1, IE2 and UL26) and -actin. control shRNA (shC) and shIE1-expressing HF cells were infected with wild-type and UL26-deleted mutant viruses at an MOI of 5. results showed that the UL26-deleted virus less effectively reduced the ISGylation levels than wild-type virus at the late phase of infection. IE1 represses transcription of ISGs by sequestrating STAT2 [58\u201360] and PML [61, 62]. IE1 effectively reduced ISGylation during HCMV infection. a specific ISGylation enzyme was depleted by shRNA. HCMV replication was inhibited by ISGylation at multiple steps. ISGylation of IE1 is responsible for the activation of viral early and late genes. ISGylation of cellular proteins that in particular play a role in innate immune responses. studies on viral targets for ISGylation and viral strategies that interfere with the ISGylation-mediated antiviral functions are limited to a few examples. UL26 ISGylation appears to regulate protein stability by competing with ubiquitination. nairoviruses and arteriviruses have shown to encode ovarian tumor domain (OTU)-containing proteases that hydrolyze ISG15 from target proteins. recently, KSHV-encoded vIRF1 was shown to interact with Herc5. a common ISG15-targeting mechanism is shared by influenza B virus, vaccinia virus, and HCMV. HCMV encodes a tegument protein pUL48 that contains a deubiquitinating protease domain. IE1 reduces ISG15 transcription and UL26 inhibits protein ISGylation. stocks for the parent Towne virus and the CR208 mutant were prepared in ihfie1.3 cells as described previously. wild-type and UL26-HA-expressing HCMVs (Toledo strain) were grown in HF cells after electroporation with the bacmid DNAs. Plasmids for SRT-UL26-p21 (pSE124) and Myc-UL26-p21 (pSE107) were cloned using the pcDNA6 (Life Technologies) vector and pCS3-MT vector. two lysine residues on the linker between the SRT tag and the UL26 ORF were changed to alanines to block their possible ISGylation. each transformant was selected on plates lacking tryptophan or leucine. diploid cells (a/) were selected on plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. cells expressing bait and prey that interact with each other grow on SC-TrpLeuHis. retroviral vectors expressing shRNA for UBE1L (pMSCVpuro-shUBE1L-1) were amplified with pLKO.1-based lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA for UBP43. pLKO.1-tRC control expressing a non-hairpin control RNA (shC) was purchased from Addgene. 293T cells were transfected with lentiviral vectors with plasmids pCMV-DR8.91 expressing the gag-pol, tat, and rev proteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pMD-G. at 48 h, the viral supernatants were collected and used to transduce HF cells in the presence of polybrene (7.5 g/ml) antibodies mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and total cell lysates were prepared by boiling the cell pellets in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer. equal amounts of clarified cell extracts were separated on a gel or Gradi-Gel II (Elpis biotech, Republic of Korea) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.

PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated to MSCV-PGKpuro. lentiviruses were prepared in 293T cells after co-transfection with retroviral vectors together with plasmids pHIT60 (Gag-Pol) and pMD-G expressing the envelope G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus. at 48 h, the viral supernatants were collected and used to transduce HF cells in the presence of polybrene (7.5 g/ml) the transduced cells were selected with puromycin (1 g/ml) and maintained in a medium containing puromycin (0.5 g/ml) antibodies mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) 810R, which detects epitopes present in both IE1 and IE2, was purchased from Chemic the blots were blocked by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. after three 5 min washes with PBST, the blots were incubated with appropriate antibodies in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. the extracts were clarified in a microcentrifuge and 20 l of extracts were incubated with 350 l of reaction buffer A (25 mM Gly-Gly pH 7.8, 15 mM ATP and 4 mM EGTA) a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs) was used for the 10-s assay of the photons produced. sonicated cell lysates were incubated with appropriate antibodies. mixture was pelleted and washed 7 times with co-IP buffer. each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. the clarified cell lysates were incubated with appropriate antibody for 16 h. the mixture was pelleted and washed seven times with co-IP buffer. total RNAs were isolated from 2 105 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and MaXtract high density (Qiagen) 293T cells were co-transfected with MSCV retroviral vectors expressing shRNA for UBE1L (shUBE1L-1 or shUBE1L-2) at 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. the results showed that shUBE1L-1 specifically reduced UBE1L expression.
