{"summary": "many researchers have studied how interconnections between networks produce phenomena that are absent in isolated networks [2] a system composed of interconnected networks retains connectivity links within each individual network but adds dependency links that connect each network to other networks in the system. this interdependency is the cause of many real-world multiple network phenomena, such as failure cascades [7], avalanches [8], and traffic overloads [9]. the SIS model can describe the propagation dynamics for recurrent diseases. there are many diseases in which ill individuals either die or become immune to future infections. the favorite approach to describing the spreading process is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [25]\u2013[27]. infected individuals transmit the disease to its susceptible neighbors with a probability and recover after a fixed time. the spread process stops when all the infected individuals are recovered. the dynamic of the epidemic is controlled by the transmissibility. the critical threshold is very small for heterogeneous networks. at this critical threshold, the fraction of recovered individuals overcomes a second-order phase transition. at and below the disease cannot spread and above the disease infects a significant fraction of the population. an epidemic occurs only if the number of recovered individuals in the steady state reaches or exceeds a minimum size. we construct each layer using the Molloy Reed algorithm [37]. we choose randomly a fraction of nodes in each of the layers that represent the same nodes. we assume that the transmissibility is the same in both layers because there is only one disease and all individuals in the system spread equally. the only possibility to have a non-epidemic regime is that none of the branches of infection spread, i.e.. the only possibility to have a non-epidemic regime is that none of the branches of infection spread, i.e.. the only possibility to have a non-epidemic regime is that none of the branches of infection spread. the black full lines correspond to obtained theoretically from Eq. (3). the limit corresponds to a disease spreading in layer A when it is isolated. colored regions correspond to the epidemic-free phase for each value of. the region above corresponds to the epidemic-phase. total fraction of recovered individuals in the steady state of the epidemics. in both panels full black lines correspond to theory given by Eq. (5). simulations results are given for in pink circles, green squares and blue diamonds. the isolated epidemic threshold of the less propagating layer will change discontinuously and acquire the isolated threshold of the other layer. overlapping fraction values were obtained theoretically from Eq. (4) for two Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi layers with different overlapping fraction values. vaccinating or isolating only that layer with the higher propagation capacity can drastically reduce the total branching factor of the network. as a consequence, the epidemic threshold of the system increases significantly, and the risk that a disease epidemic will propagate across the entire network is reduced."}
