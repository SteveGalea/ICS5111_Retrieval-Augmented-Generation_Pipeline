{"summary": "MERS-CoV belongs to beta group of coronavirus. it can infect multiple host species and causes severe diseases in humans. multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. the analysis of the RBD showed similar structure in IT-batCoVs and HKU5 respect to HKU4 sequences. it is possible to suggest also for IT-batCoVs the absence of DPP4-binding potential."}
