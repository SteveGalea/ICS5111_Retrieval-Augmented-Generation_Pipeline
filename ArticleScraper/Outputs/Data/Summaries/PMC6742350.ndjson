{"summary": "combination antifungal therapy is a safe option in immunocompromised children with invasive mold infections. the use of combination antifungal therapy in cases with a severe clinical course is increasing, although information on the efficacy and safety of this approach is limited. evidence about the role of CAT for the treatment of IMI is scarce in the adult population. well-designed studies on the use of CAT in immunocompromised children are lacking. in this scenario, any experience of treating IMI with CAT in children may help clinicians to gain knowledge in this field.

CAT is often chosen as a strategy to improve the outcome in those cases of IMI with severe clinical course. if evidence is limited in the adult population, it is even scarcer in the pediatric setting. in a recent italian multicenter study on 127 invasive fungal infections in hemato-oncological pediatric patients, up to 45/126 (36%) episodes were treated with antifungal combinations as initial therapy. authors speculate that this choice was driven by the more severe clinical conditions of these patients [19] combination of CAT with caspofungin was used for IA as the main CAT. all but 1 patient (4/5) treated with this association survived. the fifth died due to the progression of the underlying malignancy. some studies have reported antagonism between the 2 drugs. some authors support CAT for fusariosis with the association of voriconazole and posaconazole. we have described 2 cases of mucormycosis with rhino-cerebral and orbital involvement successfully treated with L-AMB in association with posaconazole.
