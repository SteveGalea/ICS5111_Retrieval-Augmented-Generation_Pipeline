{"summary": "participants were tested for Schistosoma japonicum infection in stool. seven standard measures of the liver and spleen were obtained using ultrasound to evaluate the relationship between schistosomiasis infection and ultrasound-detectable pathology. the major intestinal schistosomes, Schistosoma japonicum, found in africa, the Americas and the Middle East, mature, mate and lay eggs in the portal and mesenteric blood vessels. eggs are transported to the liver where they are encapsulated and the granulomas that form induce an inflammatory cascade that includes the deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix proteins. the immune regulation of this process is currently being explored [7]. fibrotic pattern is often described as fish scale or tortoise shell-like. egg size allows parasite eggs to enter smaller portal veins and reach a greater portion of the liver. a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed ultrasound measures is lacking. treatment led to declines in parenchymal and periportal fibrosis in a highly exposed cohort. 68% of participants experienced no change in parenchymal fibrosis over a five-year period. a direct relationship between infection and fibrosis or measures of portal hypertension has not been demonstrated consistently [16], [17], [22]. participants in cohort included individuals who had an ultrasound examination in 2000 and lived in one of the ten villages followed through 2005. ethics statement All participants provided oral informed consent and were provided treatment following S. japonicum positive stool examinations. a longitudinal section along the left parasternal line was measured as the maximum oblique diameter using a right anterior axillary view. spleen thickness, measured from the hilum to the opposite section, and the internal diameter of the spleen vein, measured at the entry point to the spleen [24] height-specific standard sizes were classified as abnormal. participants with any versus no height data did not differ significantly by any of the predictors examined in the analyses. participants were tested for infection with S. japonicum in the fall of 2000 and 2002 using the miracidial hatch test and the Kato-Katz thick smear procedure. praziquantel was administered to all residents in the study villages in 2003. participant age, sex, occupation and highest level of schooling were obtained by interview in fall 2000. cohort participants were compared in terms of age, sex, occupation, educational attainment and 2000 S. japonicum infection status. abnormalities were first assessed by examining the impact of current infection status and infection intensity on current ultrasound measures. we also examined the relationship between infection status and intensity two to three years prior to the ultrasound examination and ultrasound-detected abnormalities. we hypothesized age, sex and year of examination could modify the effect of infection on morbidity. tests for trend were calculated by treating categorical variables as ordinal. all results were assessed for statistical significance setting = 0.05. ethics statement All participants provided oral informed consent. the internal diameter of the portal vein was measured at the entry point of the portal vein into the liver. the length of the left liver lobe was measured in a longitudinal section along the left parasternal line. the length of the right liver lobe was measured as the maximum oblique diameter using a right anterior axillary view. random intercept models assume parametric distribution of residuals. the selected model was superior to a model that did not include a random intercept. participants with any versus no height data did not differ significantly by any predictors examined in the analyses including sex, mean age or infection status. participants were classified as infected if at least one test was positive. praziquantel was administered to all residents in the study villages in 2003. participant age, sex, occupation and highest level of schooling were obtained. the relationship between infection and ultrasound-detected abnormalities was first assessed by examining the impact of current infection status and infection intensity on current ultrasound measures. we also examined the relationship between infection status and intensity two to three years prior to the ultrasound examination and ultrasound-detected abnormalities. results In 2000, 578 people from ten villages were examined using ultrasound. the mean age of participants was 29.8 years (range 4\u201361 years) half (51%) were female. in 2002, infection prevalence declined to 32% and intensity to 9.4 EPG. in 2002, infection prevalence declined to 32% and intensity to 32%. in 2002, infection prevalence declined to 32% and intensity to 9.4 EPG. some middle school or higher 173 68 (39) 162 51 (31) 0.70 (0.51\u20130.96) Tuanjie2 58 6 (10) 56 8 (14) 0.19 (0.09\u20130.39) Jiaojia4 59

S. japonicum infection may lead to fibrosis that is not rapidly reversed by treatment."}
