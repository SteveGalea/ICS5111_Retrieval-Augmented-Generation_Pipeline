{"summary": "study examines the effect of dispositional optimism on life satisfaction. results revealed that dispositional optimism and core self-evaluations were significantly correlated with life satisfaction. findings extended prior studies and shed light on how dispositional optimism influences life satisfaction. young people with high dispositional optimism are confident about success by continuous attempt even despite the challenges. more optimists than pessimists make plans for their future and set goals for themselves. more optimists than pessimists make plans for their future and set goals for themselves. Optimistic acceptance implies restructuring one's perceptions to come to grips with situations. acceptance may actually serve the purpose of keeping a person goal-engaged and \u201clife-engaged\u201d [2]. a concept highly related to optimism is core self-evaluation (CSE) the current study evaluated the concurrent effect of CSE and dispositional optimism on life satisfaction. no study has examined the mediator effect of CSE on the relationship between dispositional optimism and life satisfaction. LOT-R is a 6-item measure (plus 4 filler items) of individual differences in dispositional optimism and pessimism [22]. items are rated from 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree). examples of items include: \"I am confident I get the success I deserve in life\" a model was considered to have a good fit if all the path coefficients were significant at the level of 0.05, 2/df was below 5, SRMR was below 0.08, RMSEA was below 0.08, and CFI was 0.95 or more. participants and Procedure Participants were 630 undergraduates from two general universities in Jinan and Yantai, china. items are rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) the scale scores are the sum of the ratings of the items. Relevant items were reverse-coded. faction with Life Scale was developed by Diener and Suh, consisting five items on a 7-point rating scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree) a two-step procedure introduced by Anderson and Gerbing was adapted to analyses the mediation effect [25]. a confirmatory factor analysis was used to be sure of the structural relations of the latent structured model. model df 2 2/df CFI RMSEA SRMR Unidimensional 9 106.01 11.78 0.837 0.131 0.069 Bidimensional 8 20.45 2.56 0.979 0.050 0.033 Figure 1. The bidimensional structure of dispositional optimism. the fully measurement model included four latent constructs (optimism, pessimism, core self evaluations and life satisfaction) the test of the measurement model came into being a satisfactory fit to the data. the results showed that the direct path from pessimism to life satisfaction was not significant. the total effect of optimism on life satisfaction through core self-evaluations was 16.18%. the effect of pessimism to life satisfaction was completely mediated by core self-evaluations. the final structural model (n = 627) showed the indirect effects and their associated 95% confidence intervals. some recent studies have suggested dispositional optimism is bidimensional and consists of optimism and pessimism factors. however, some recent studies have suggested that dispositional optimism is bidimensional and consists of optimism and pessimism factors. measure model was adopted to assess whether the measurement model fit the sample data adequately or not. the fully measurement model included four latent constructs (optimism, pessimism, core self evaluations and life satisfaction) and 12 observed variables. the final meditational model showed a good fit to the data, 2 (49, N = 627) = 124.06, 2/df = 2.53, p0.001; RMSEA = 0.049, SRMR = 0.044, and CFI = 0.955. the total effect of optimism on life satisfaction through core self-evaluations was 16.18%. study examined the mediator effect of CSE on the relationship between attributional styles and SWB in Chinese college students. previous studies have found that optimistic trait has a significant negative correlation with pessimistic trait. LOT\u2013R is bidimensional rather than unidimensional and an insignificant shared variance exists between optimism and pessimism. studies have adopted different participants to examine the relationship between attributional styles and their effect. attributional style predicted a state positive effect [33]\u2013[36]. pessimists attribute causes of negative events to global factors. so, they have a low life satisfaction eventually. positive expectations help to enhance life satisfaction, high performance, and positive emotional experience. pessimists could also have positive attitude toward happiness if they have right self-evaluation. psychologists should have a dialectical view on these problems. tools used in this study were translated from those of western researchers. thus, cultural difference of optimism was neglected to some extent. localized tools for evaluating optimism should be developed."}
