{"summary": "RNA virus populations sustain high genetic diversity due to low fidelity of polymerase, short genome, high replication rates and large population size. a single RNA virus population can consist of a multiplicity of slightly different genomes, sometimes referred to as a mutant spectra. the high mutation rate of RNA viruses increases the ability of these viruses to adapt to diverse hosts. BCoV is known to use 9-O-acetylated sialic acid to bind to host cells, although a second receptor may be involved. the spike protein which is present on the surface of the virion determines host range and tissue tropism of coronvaviruses. naturally-infected BCoV samples are often difficult to adapt to growth in cell culture. isolation in cell culture is likely to result in adaptive mutations. each step of the virus passage protocol was optimized to allow for the greatest chance of virus particle recovery. Approximately 12 kilobase (kb) of the BCoV 30 kb genome was amplified using 16 primer sets designed to conserve regions of the genome. the primer sets were used to amplify unpassaged and passaged viral RNA. in some cases not all primer sets yielded PCR product suggesting changes occurred in the primer binding region during passage. phylogeny was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model. the tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. the percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. four-amino acid insert was located immediately adjacent to the proteolytic cleavage site of the spike protein. the insert was also present at subconsensus level in some of the cell-passaged samples. the insert was present at very low numbers in unpassaged samples. the insert reached consensus in all passages of nasal sample #1, passage 1 of sample #27 and passage 4 of sample #59 in Bomacs. this 12 nt insert was present at subconsensus level between 0.01 and 37%. no insert was detected in diluted or undiluted Mebus RNA. in nasal sample #1, we used the Taqman insert assay to test for the presence of the insert in a second sample of #1. the insert was detected in approximately the same numbers as the polymerase gene, thus indicating that the enrichment process is reproducible. the number of viral genomic variants (nucleotide polymorphism occurring at subconsensus level) varied widely between samples. the fraction of sequenced regions of the genome containing a variant was 0.5% for 454 data. this is consistent with the higher coverage and sensitivity associated with our Illumina data. the consensus sequence for each unpassaged parent sample was compared to its passaged descendants. the x-axis shows the name of the passaged descendant identified by sample (1, 27, or 59), host cell type (BO, THP or HRT) and passage number (1, 4 or 5). mutation signatures are either nonexistent or exist at the subconsensus level in the unpassaged samples. two of these 42 positions are located on the nsp1 gene. the other 40 are all located on the spike gene. the point mutations \u2013base change from UP-SNP to P-SNP \u2013 at 17 of the 42 locations are non-synonymous. all 42 passage markers were found as variants in unpassaged samples #1 and #27. only 15 were identified in unpassaged #59. mutations located in the spike protein are in italics. at least 7 out of 8 non-synonymous mutations occurred at surface-accessible residues in the receptor binding domain. one of these surface exposed amino-acid mutations required 2 transversions (AAT \u2013 TCT) only one non-synonymous mutation, M248L (1 transversion), was located in a buried position on the spike protein. most of the insert-lacking reads contained the UP-SNPs \u2018C\u2019 at 26361 and 26394. majority of the insert-lacking reads showed the P-SNP variant. the majority genetic population in nasal sample #1 lacked the insert and had the genotype 26361-C, 26394-C. each step of the virus passage protocol was optimized to allow for the greatest chance of virus particle recovery before and during cell culture passage. trypsin has been shown to enhance infection of HRT-18 cells [20], [21], but was not used in the infection protocol in order to keep protocols identical for infection of enteric, lung and macrophage cell lines. ensus Sequence Data The nsp1, nsp3, nsp14, and spike protein gene consensus sequences of passaged and unpassaged viruses were compared to identify any changes characteristic of serial passage. regions of the genome varied in the number of observed mutations in the consensus sequence with the spike and nsp1 genes showing the most mutations due to passage. the genomic regions included in the analysis span nts 2764\u20138460 (nsp1), 10858\u201311714 (nsp3), 17910\u201319472 (nsp14), and 23641\u201327732 (spike), as numbered according to accession AB354579. samples may be absent from analysis due to inadequate sequence data generated for a particular coding region. an in-depth analysis using Illumina ultra-deep sequencing (mean 37,901coverage) showed that the insert was present at very low numbers in unpassaged samples but was sometimes enriched during passage in cell culture. na: sample data not available due to a gap in production testing. this 12 nt insert was not present in any BCoV sequences available in GenBank. it is possible that the insert is present at subconsensus level in other common lab-adapted strains of BCoV. compared to 454 data, Illumina sequencing data detected substantially more variants in nasal sample #27 (81 to 226) and nasal sample #59 (10 to 122). this is consistent with the fact that the majority of variants in nasal sample #1 occurred at higher frequency \u2013 high enough that most were detected with 454 sequencing. the majority of consensus passaged consensus SNPs were present as variants in the respective unpassaged parental samples in all cases except 59.BO1 and 59.BO4. the majority of consensus passaged consensus SNPs were present as variants in the respective unpassaged parental samples. the consensus sequence for each unpassaged parent sample was compared to its passaged descendants. we identified 186 positions in the BCoV genome where all three unpassaged samples had the same consensus SNP that differed from the consensus SNP found in all eight NEB samples. of the 186 positions, 42 positions showed an enrichment of the P-SNPs from the early to the late passaged sample in a majority of the cases. the point mutations at 17 of the 42 locations are non-synonymous (Table 2). all 42 passage markers were found as variants in unpassaged samples #1 and #27. only 15 were identified in unpassaged #59. all of sample #1\u2032s passage derivatives rapidly changed with passage. the lack of NEB variants in unpassaged sample #59 was an anomaly. a large increase in NEB strain SNPs existing as variants in the passaged descendants of #59 compared to the parent sample. it seems likely that increased numbers of serial passages would result in samples #27 and #59 acquiring more NEB strain SNPs. a heterogeneous sample from deep sequencing data was reconstructed. the open source software, ShoRAH, was used to carry out genotype reconstruction. most of the insert-lacking reads contained the UP-SNPs \u2018C\u2019 at 26361 and 26394. the majority genetic population in nasal sample #1 lacked the insert and had the genotype 26361-C, 26394-C. it remained unclear whether the insert-lacking passaged variants originated from a P-variant that lost the insert or rather originated from an insert lacking UP-variant. a similar finding was recently described for foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) ence data indicate that the virus population undergoes rapid change when grown in Bomac cells. this may have made the viral genome difficult to detect with our PCR primers. amplification failed for most regions of the genome simultaneously. amplification failed for most regions of the genome simultaneously. the location of the insert in the S2 subunit may decrease the influence of the insert in heparin sulfate binding. it is interesting to note the presence of other basic residues present in the passaged genotype that may impact binding to heparin sulfate. studies of other coronaviruses show that fusogenic activity of the spike protein may allow for trypsin-independent entry of the virus into a variety of cell types. coronavirus spike protein amino acid sequences are underlined. the inserted amino acids are in blue text; RR motifs observed in other sequences are in red. heparan sulfate binding has been associated with viral attenuation in vivo. 8 of the 10 changes identified in a study by Zhang et al., (1991) as being associated with virulence were present in the UP group but not in the P group. a number of the amino acid changes in the spike protein have been hypothesized to be involved in virulence or tissue tropism of the virus. reverse genetics tracked the evolution of variant genotypes over several passages through cell lines. the majority of the identified variants were detected in relatively low abundance. the majority of the identified variants were detected in relatively low abundance, leaving open the question of their functional significance. studies of other coronaviruses show that fusogenic activity of the spike protein may allow for trypsin-independent entry of the virus into a variety of cell types. the addition of a multibasic motif in the S2 subunit of the BCoV spike protein may create a trypsin-independent spike protein activation site. coronavirus species are in blue text; RR motifs observed in other sequences are in red. heparan sulfate binding has been associated with viral attenuation in vivo. coronavirus fixation to heparan sulfate on the surface of macrophages has been associated with increased host inflammatory cytokine response. a number of the amino acid changes in the spike protein have been hypothesized to be involved in virulence or tissue tropism of the virus. a serine at this site has been hypothesized to be associated with cell fusion. another region immediately upstream of the insert (899\u2013907) has been suggested to be a fusogenic domain. the majority of the identified variants were detected in relatively low abundance. the majority of the identified variants were detected in relatively low abundance. the results indicate the importance of identifying the variants in the population. bovine embryonic tracheal cells (ATCC CCL-44) and Calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma) cells (ATCC HTB-55) were grown on RPMI-1640 Medium (Gibco) with 2 mM L-Glutamine, Penicillin/Streptomycin. above cells were propagated with each optimum culture medium until confluent and maintained in 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. swabs were homogenized in Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium. the sample suspensions were clarified by centrifugation at 2000g for 30 minutes. 42 of these animals were positive for BCoV RNA by RT-PCR assay. RNA Extraction A 500 l sample was homogenized with 500 l TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. incubations were performed at 30\u00b0C instead of room temperature. primer design Primers were designed to be as sensitive to target strain variants as possible. products were pooled, purified and quantified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) a subset of amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina GA IIx sequencer at Eureka Genomics Hercules, CA. the raw sequencer reads generated from the experiments and the reads aligned to the reference sequence is available at ftp://gdo-bioinformatics.ucllnl.org/pub/b a sequencing control plasmid was constructed by inserting a 1 kb fragment of the BCoV polymerase gene into a sequencing plasmid. the plasmid region was then sequenced to determine the sequence of the insert prior to PCR amplification and 454 or Illumina sequencing. the sequencing control was used to model error by measuring observed miscall rates of non-consensus bases. an alternative approach would lead to an artificial lowering of the error rate. the error rate was conditioned on the case when a non-consensus base call is made, rather the error rate averaged over all base calls including those where no-subconsensus mutation is attempted. Illumina sequencing was carried out on four samples using Illumina paired-end technology. read pairs of length 112 bp were created with an overlapping region of 80 bp. the known gap size facilitates post-sequencing alignment. 12,159 unique bases were sequenced covering nsp1, nsp2, nsp3 and spike proteins between positions 2647 and 27809 on a reference genome, GenBank accession number NC_003045. four of the 30 samples were also sequenced using Illumina to obtain deeper coverage. EBTr (bovine embryonic tracheal) cells (ATCC CCL-44) and Calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma) cells (ATCC HTB-55) were grown on RPMI-1640 Medium (Gibco) with 2 mM L-Glutamine, Penicillin/Streptomycin, and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. a large number of calves were sampled to ensure that at least several positive samples would be obtained. a study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Protocol Number 2009-207) RNA Extraction A 500 l sample was homogenized with 500 l TRIzol reagent. incubations were performed at 30\u00b0C instead of room temperature. primer design Primers were designed to amplify eight regions of 1.5 to 2.5 kb. a subset of amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina GA IIx sequencer at Eureka Genomics Hercules, CA. the raw sequencer reads generated from the experiments and the reads aligned to the reference sequence is available at ftp://gdo-bioinformatics.ucllnl.org/pub/bcv1. Taqman PCR Taqman assays (qRT-PCR) were designed to detect a region of the a sequencing control plasmid was constructed by inserting a 1 kb fragment of the BCoV polymerase gene into a sequencing plasmid using an Invitrogen TOPO\u00ae Cloning Kit for Sequencing. the plasmid region was then sequenced to determine the sequence of the insert prior to PCR amplification and 454 or Illumina sequencing. the sequencing control was used to model error by measuring observed miscall rates of non-consensus bases. the position within the read must be at least five bases away from the ends of the read. the adjacent bases must agree with the consensus sequence thus filtering out adjacent variant mutations. this rule eliminated a large percentage of the erroneous variant calls in the control sequences. assumed sequencing error rate can be calculated when a mutation occurs in a number of reads that exceed this amount for a P-value of 0.01. for coverage 1,000 the mutation would be required to occur in 5 reads. the detection sensitivity is therefore coverage and sequencer error dependent. 454 pyrosequencing data were obtained for 30 BCoV samples. 7, 7, 8 and 8 samples of nasal samples #27, #59, #1, and the NEB strain. average coverage at the four protein regions is 531, 2535, 588 and 623.
