{"summary": "it has been reported that periparturient cows undergo a period of immunosuppression of various immunological parameters associated with a high susceptibility to uterine and mammary infections. understanding the factors and mechanisms accounting for immunosuppression and disease incidence in periparturient cows is important to maintain the welfare, health and productivity of cows. based next-generation sequencing (RNAseq) provides a tremendous amount of new information regarding gene expression, transcript structure, function and regulation on a whole transcriptome level. the results of our study provided a comprehensive catalogue of transcripts expressed in whole bovine blood. we hypothesized that an efficient immune response to antigen challenge is dependent on the specific metabolic status of the cows around calving. all cows had received a basic double vaccination with an inactivated vaccine (PregSure, Pfizer) against the bovine Virus Diarrhoea Virus. at least one booster vaccination 15 months prior to our experiment. cows were excluded from subsequent data analysis. whole blood total RNA was extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit. paired-end sequencing (61 cycles for each end) was performed on a Genome Analyser GAIIx. read alignments were aligned to the bovine reference genome UMD3.1 [21] using Bowtie/TopHat 2.03 options [22] and guided alignment options supplying TopHat with the bovine gene model annotation from Igenome. the final gtf-file served for locus and transcript quantification using Cuffdiff 2.02 with the bovine UMD3.1 as reference genome assembly. the read counts per locus and sample were extracted from the final annotation file applying the Cuffdiff options. gene ontology analysis was used to identify over- or underrepresentation of differentially expressed genes prior to and after vaccination. the analysis was performed by referring to the human Ensembl annotation because of the incomplete functional annotation of the bovine genome. the length bias characteristic for RNAseq data was accounted for using the wallenius distribution to approximate the true null distribution. cow groups formed by cluster analysis were frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C until further processing. cows were excluded from subsequent data analysis due to results of the cluster analysis. libraries indexed by different adaptors were prepared from samples collected before and 14 days after booster vaccination. paired-end sequencing (61 cycles for each end) was performed on a Genome Analyser GAIIx (Illumina, San Diego, USA) reads were aligned to the bovine reference genome UMD3.1 [21] using Bowtie/TopHat 2.03 options [22] and guided alignment options supplying TopHat with the bovine gene model annotation from Igenome cluster analysis was performed using PermutMatrix [24] for calculation of Euklidian Distance. only loci with a minimum expression > 1 cpm in each of 24 samples were included. 57.8\u201379.7 million reads per sample, 85.1\u201389.0% of which were mapped on the bovine genome. results presented here focus on different response of the cows on transcriptome level in whole blood. cow 4 was in mid lactation and had delivered a calf 12 weeks before vaccination. the hypothesis-free cluster analysis identified those cows that had a different genetic background or had not experienced calving before resulting in clustering. nearly half of the 208 loci differentially expressed had no annotation in the bovine reference genome assembly. compared to the AC cows, the number of differentially expressed loci in response to vaccination was about 10-fold higher in the BC cows vaccinated prior to calving. a higher magnitude of transcriptional response to vaccination in the BC group provides evidence for a generally reduced reactivity of the cows vaccinated at about two weeks postpartum. the specific response to vaccination elicits a divergent regulatory immune defense reaction in each group. the early lactating AC cows are in a physiological stage that is associated with metabolic changes due to the onset of lactation. functional enrichment analysis based on GO categories showed that in the BC cows the absolute number of significantly affected GO terms was substantially higher compared to the AC cows. the most significantly enriched GO terms in this cow group comprise a variety of biological processes included in the regulation of gene expression and protein biosynthesis. in the AC group, we found 36 GO categories to be significantly overrepresented in response to vaccination. the most significantly affected GO terms in the AC cow group showed a focus on the development and differentiation of blood cells. biological processes associated with myeloid cell and erythrocyte differentiation, hematopoiesis, hemoglobin complex as well as gas transport and oxygen gas transport. a total of 59 biological function categories showed to be overrepresented. in the AC cow group, 34 categories displayed enrichment (p0.001, S6 and S7 Tables) biological functions associated with gene and protein expression, cell death and survival were the most significantly affected. vaccination-induced gene set enrichment analysis in the AC cows revealed only 11 significantly overrepresented KEGG pathways. a total of 195 canonical pathways were significantly enriched by the genes that were differentially regulated in the BC cow group. canonical pathways most significantly enriched by differentially expressed genes in response to vaccination prior to calving. canonical pathways most significantly enriched by differentially expressed genes in response to vaccination.

ARG1 activity is switched on in M2 macrophages via IL10/IL4/IL13 induction. a differential regulation pattern of NOS2 and ARG1 is thought to correspond to either classical (M1) or alternative (M2) macrophage activation. this mechanism is still under debate and a more complex regulatory network might be responsible for macrophage polarization. genes with a functional role in blood cell differentiation and development are upregulated in AC cows vaccinated after calving. genes with a functional role in blood cell differentiation and development are upregulated in cows vaccinated after calving. carbonic anhydrase II (CA2), glycophorin B (GYPB), hemoglobin chains A and B (HBA, HBB) and -globin (HBM). the coordinated upregulation of the respective gene network was exclusively observed in the AC cows. the upregulation of genes involved in gas transport enables the AC cows to adjust for the increased demands for oxygen and energy required for regenerative processes to recover from calving. the transcriptional profile modulated in the blood of AC cows in response to vaccination might be compromised by the consequences arising out of blood loss. downregulation of a substantial number of genes critical for the mitochondrial function and OXPHOS system points to a repression of ATP production via this pathway. the structural integrity of the complex I assembly is known to be essential to maintain its functionality. an impairment may lead to catalytic problems or instability of the complex assembly. mitochondria may play a role in regulating the immune response to vaccination in the BC cows. mitochondria are shaping the innate response to pathogens. mitochondria have the capacity to sense energy status of the cell as well as a variety of cellular stresses. PDK4 is known to play a crucial role in glucose utilization and lipid metabolism by regulating the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex that converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA for oxidation and ATP generation in the TCA cycle. a low level of glucose oxidation via TCA cycle has been shown to be due to the constant inhibition of PDH by phosphorylation of one of its four kinases rebalancing of ATP generation via glycolysis is supported by expression upregulation of HK1 (hexokinase 1) and transcription factor HIF1A (hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha) in BC cows. the vaccination-induced mitochondrial deficiency and the upregulation of PDK4 and HIF1A may synergize to activate glycolysis to generate maximal quantities of ATP. cluster analysis revealed a clear separation of cow 9 from all other cows. all other cows had experienced at least a single parturition. a purebred German Holstein cow, segregated separately. the hypothesis-free cluster analysis identified those cows that had a different genetic background or had not experienced calving before resulting in clustering of cows according to their stage of lactation and time point of vaccination relative to calving. compared individuals clustered in the two groups of cows from the CH x GH cross population. the number of differentially expressed loci in response to vaccination was about 10-fold higher in the BC cows vaccinated prior to and after calving. the intersection of loci modulated in response to vaccination in both cow groups comprised a total of 47 loci (q 0.05, Table 2). the early lactating AC cows are in a physiological stage that is associated with metabolic changes due to the onset of lactation. this stage is often associated with a shifting of the metabolism into a severe negative energy balance. this stage is often associated with a shifting of the metabolism into a severe negative energy balance, as the energy demands for lactogenesis exceed energy intake. functional enrichment analysis based on GO categories showed that in the BC cows the absolute number of significantly affected GO terms was substantially higher compared to the AC cows. the most significantly enriched GO terms in this cow group comprise a variety of biological processes included in the regulation of gene expression and protein biosynthesis, particularly mRNA translation. in the AC group, 36 GO categories were significantly overrepresented in response to vaccination. the most significantly affected GO terms in the AC cow group showed a focus on the development and differentiation of blood cells. biological processes associated with myeloid cell and erythrocyte differentiation, hematopoiesis, hemoglobin complex. biological functions related to cellular development, hematological disease and cell death and survival were the most significantly affected in BC cows. the most significant biological function categories (IPA) affected in cows vaccinated prior to and after calving. a spectrum comprising 35 biological KEGG pathways was affected in BC cows.

Activated ARG1 function has been reported to compensate unrestrained inflammation by producing cytokines suppressing the NO-mediated inflammation. regulation of arginase 1 (ARG1) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) downstream metabolic products (blue framed) and association with components of inflammatory responses (red) genes with a functional role in blood cell differentiation and development are upregulated in AC cows vaccinated after calving. coordinated upregulation of the gas exchange is pathway was observed in the AC cows. synergistic modulation of the transcripts integrated in the gas exchange metabolon in the blood transcriptome of AC cows in response to vaccination is reflected in Fig 5B. upregulation of genes involved in gas transport enables AC cows to adjust for increased demands for oxygen and energy required for regenerative processes to recover from calving. transcriptional profile modulated in the blood of AC cows in response to vaccination might be compromised by consequences arising out of blood loss and forcing the activation of red blood cell formation postpartum. the structural integrity of the complex I assembly is known to be essential to maintain its functionality. impairment may lead to catalytic problems or instability of the complex assembly. mitochondrial ETC is also a major source for the generation of reactive oxygen species. mitochondria are shaping the innate response to pathogens. mitochondria are shaping the innate response to pathogens. mitochondria have the capacity to sense energy status of the cell and a variety of cellular stresses. PDK4 is known to play a crucial role in glucose utilization and lipid metabolism by regulating the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex that converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA for oxidation and ATP generation in the TCA cycle. a low level of glucose oxidation via TCA cycle has been shown to be due to the constant inhibition of PDH by phosphorylation of one of its four kinases glycolysis has been reported to produce ATP at a rate 100 times faster than OXPHOS. rebalancing of ATP generation via glycolysis is supported by expression upregulation of HK1 (hexokinase 1) and transcription factor HIF1A (hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha) in BC cows. protein biosynthesis and posttranslational processes are downregulated in cows vaccinated prior to calving Ingenuity canonical pathway analysis in the BC group highlighted the EIF2 signaling and EIF4 and p70S6K signaling as most significantly enriched pathways. IPA analysis showed that these two pathways are represented by numerous affected genes, of which 14% were upregulated. the protein biosynthesis process was not observed in AC cows. the mechanism includes the protection against viral dsRNA via inhibition of protein synthesis is obviously a main immune response. this mechanism seems to be impaired in cows vaccinated prior to parturition. myc-mediated apoptosis signaling and cellular pathways of adhesion, communication and migration were modulated at a highly significant magnitude. all of these pathways are represented by a variety of genes that followed a predominant trend of upregulation (Table 3, S10 Table) and suggest a comprehensive and coordinated immune reaction in the blood transcriptome of the BC cows for protection against antigen exposure, a transcriptional signature divergent to the AC cows. XLOC_32517 locus showed similarity regarding sequence and structural features to CSF2 (colony, or granulocyte macrophage, -stimulating factor 2) was also significantly upregulated in the BC group. due to its cytokine similarity features it can be assumed that the locus might be involved in growth and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells from various lineages.

PDK4 expression leads to a suppression of the influx of glycolytic metabolites into mitochondria. a low level of glucose oxidation via TCA cycle has been shown to be due to the constant inhibition of PDH by phosphorylation of one of its four kinases. PDK4 is a novel regulator of one of the signaling pathways of mTORC1 via HIFA1 effects. HK1 phosphorylates glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in glycolysis, and HIF1A is a transcriptional factor known to control metabolism, survival and innate immunity in response to inflammation and oxygen deficiency. vaccination-induced mitochondrial deficiency and the upregulation of PDK4 and HIF1A may synergize to activate glycolysis to generate maximal quantities of ATP. the results of our study indicate a differential modulation of transcripts, biological processes and pathways in the two cow groups vaccinated prior to or after calving. the response to vaccination elicits a quantitatively and qualitatively divergent regulatory immune defense reaction in the blood transcriptome of each cow group. the response to vaccination elicits a quantitatively and qualitatively divergent regulatory immune defense reaction in the blood transcriptome of each cow group.
