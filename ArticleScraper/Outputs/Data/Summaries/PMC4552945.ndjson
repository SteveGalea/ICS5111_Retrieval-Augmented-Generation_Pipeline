{"summary": "methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains are resistant to almost all the commonly used antibiotics. this fact urges pharmaceutical companies to develop new and effective prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapies. attempts at making S. aureus vaccines have so far been unsuccessful. a peptide mimicking a carbohydrate antigen of tumor cells or polysaccharide in bacterium could increase tumor-specific cellular responses. in this study, we synthesized a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP27) which carried four copies of an identical peptide derived from the screening of the phage peptide library. MAP27 decreased the bacterial burden in organs of the mice and significantly prolonged their survival time after S. aureus lethal-chal mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) via abdominal cavity. mice were monitored every 2 hours for the first 48 hours. survival was monitored for at least 7 days. isotype: mouse IgG3) or mAb against Lipoteichoic acid (LTA, Thermo scientific, MA1-7401, clone No. G35C, isotype: mouse IgG1) at 4\u00b0C for overnight. biotin-labeled SP27, SP27\u2019 or L2 as a control peptide (sequence: Biotin-HSGHWDFRQWQPSGG) was added to the wells coated female BALB/c mice were divided randomly into three groups. first two groups were injected subcutaneously with 100 g MAP27 and 100 g MAPctrl for five times at 2-week intervals. third group of mice, without any peptide immunization, was used as the blank control. the titer of antibody was defined as the highest dilution that gives more than twice the absorbance value of the blank control. all of the mice were infected with S. aureus (ATCC 25923) at 5108 CFU/mouse via tail vein injection. the mortality was monitored for 7 days (168 hours) post challenge. 1\u20132106 lymphocytes were harvested three days after the last heat-inactivated S. aureus boost. splenocytes from MAP27-immunized, MAPctrl-immunized and blank mice were harvested by squeezing. the splenocytes (2 105 cells/well) were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 100 g/ml MAP27 for 24 h or 2104 CFU/well heat-inactivated S. aureus for 72 h. the plates were blocked with complete medium at room temperature for 1 h. the splenocytes were harvested and plated at 4105/well. the plates were extensively washed and developed with substrate solution containing AEC (Sigma) and H2O2. after drying, the plates were read using CTL analyzer. data for specificity of antibody, cytokine production and ELISPOT were analyzed using either one-way ANOVA or Student\u2019s t-test. mice were observed every 2 hours for the first 48 hours during the bacterial lethal challenge. survival was monitored for at least 7 days. peptides, including three linear peptides, were synthesized by Hybio Pharmaceutical. clone No. G35C, isotype: mouse IgG1) at 4\u00b0C for overnight. biotin-labeled SP27, SP27\u2019 or L2 as a control peptide (sequence: Biotin-HSGHWDFRQWWQPSGG) was added to the wells coated with 80 g/ml MAP27 or MAPctrl. wells were washed three times with 0.1% PBS/Twe LB/c mice were divided randomly into three groups. the first two groups were injected subcutaneously with 100 g MAP27 and 100 g MAPctrl for five times at 2-week intervals. the third group of mice, without any peptide immunization, was used as the blank control. titer of antibody was defined as the highest dilution that gives more than twice the absorbance value of the blank control. all of the mice were infected with lethal live S. aureus at 5108 CFU/mouse via tail vein injection. three days after infection, mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. splenocytes from MAP27-immunized, MAPctrl-immunized and blank mice were obtained. splenocytes from MAP27-immunized, MAPctrl-immunized and blank mice were obtained by squeezing followed by filtering through a stainless mesh (size, 70 m) in RPMI1640 medium. the splenocytes (2 105 cells/well) were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 100 g/ml MAP27 for 24 h or 2104 CFU/well heat-inactivated S. aureus for 72 h. the supernatants were collected after the incubation and stored at -70\u00b0C. Statistical analyses of data to compare the different groups were performed using SPSS version 16.0 software. data for specificity of antibody, cytokine production and ELISPOT were analyzed using either one-way ANOVA or Student\u2019s t-test. both SP27 and MAP27 bind to anti-PGN mAb in a dose-dependent manner. MAP27 was synthesized in a tetra-branched form that contains four copies of a sequence (SASPHHHSRLRSESGG) that mimics PGN epitope. MAP27 contains four copies of SP27, with C-terminus of each peptide linked with the non-immunogenic dendritic scaffold. the predicted molecular weight of MAP27 is 7137.7, big enough for immunization according to previous work. trl were used for binding assays by indirect ELISA. serum from MAP27-immunized mice weakly reacted with PGN. anti-S. aureus IgG from MAP27-immunized mice could be detected with 1/200 dilution. sera from MAP27-immunized mice bind to S. aureus after boosting with heat-killed S.aureus. 96-well plates were coated with PGN or sonicated S. aureus fragments. /c mice were challenged with S. aureus (ATCC 25923, 5108 CFU/mouse) by intravenous injection. survival rate monitored for seven days after infection. the levels of IFN- and IL-17A/F, cytokines mainly secreted by T cells, were remarkably higher in MAP27-immunized mice than in MAPctrl-immunized mice and blank control mice. the results indicate that T cell responses might mediate the protection of MAP27 immunization against the S. aureus systemic infection. the percentage of IFN-+CD3+CD4+ T cells from MAP27-immunized mice was significantly higher than that from MAPctrl-immunized mice. the results suggest both CD4+ and CD4- T cells were stimulated to produce IFN- in MAP27-immunized mice post S. aureus infection. CD3+ lymphocytes were further gated from the lymphocyte cluster according to the fluorescence signal intensities. the results were presented as meanSEM. cells were incubated with 100 g/ml MAP27 for 24 h. the supernatant was then collected and cytokine induction was analyzed. the spleenocytes produced significantly more IL-2 and IFN- than cells from control mice. IL-4, which is mainly produced by Th2 cells, could only be detected very weakly in all three groups. ELISPOT measured FN--producing cells from MAP27-immunized mice. the number of IFN--producing cells from MAP27-immunized mice was significantly higher than that from MAPctrl-immunized mice (P = 0.001) and blank control mice (P = 0.001). the number of IFN-- or IL-17A-producing cells from MAP27-immunized mice was significantly higher than that from the control groups (IFN--producing cells: MAP27 vs MAPctrl, P = 0.0126; MAP27 vs blank control, P = 0.0041; MAP27 vs blank control, P = 0.0041; MAP27 vs blank control, P = 0.0039) ELISPOT determined IFN--producing (E) and IL-17A-producing cells. both linear peptides and tetra-branched, multiple antigenic peptide MAP27 bind to antibody specifically. the sequences of SP27 (Biotin-SASPHHHSRLRSESGG) and SP27\u2019 (Biotin-SPHHHSRLRSESSAGG) bind to anti-PGN mAb in a dose-dependent manner. both SP27 and SP27\u2019 (100 g/ml) specifically bind to anti-PGN mAb. MAP27 contains four copies of SP27, with C-terminus of each peptide linked with the non-immunogenic, lysine-based dendritic scaffold. predicted molecular weight of MAP27 is 7137.7, big enough for immunization. antibodies to S. aureus were not detected in the same samples. anti-S. aureus IgG from MAP27-immunized mice could be detected with a dilution of 1/200. the serum samples from either MAPctrl-immunized mice (P = 0.016) or blank control mice (P = 0.002) produced no detectable antibodies. all of the mice were challenged with live S. aureus at a lethal dose on the fifth day post the last boost of heat-inactivated bacterium. survival was then monitored. the number of bacterium in the kidney of MAP27-immunized mice is significantly fewer than that of MAPctrl-immunized mice. MAP27 immunization only induced the production of low titer antibodies against S. aureus or PGN, it protected the mice against S. aureus systemic infection. a chemokine that activates macrophages and neutrophils was also increased in MAP27-immunized mice. these results indicate that T cell responses might mediate the protection of MAP27 immunization against the S. aureus systemic infection. ctrl-immunized mice (3.850.41%, P = 0.021) or blank control mice (3.570.73%, P = 0.03) similar results were also observed for IFN-+CD3+CD4- T cells. both CD4+ and CD4- T cells were stimulated to produce IFN- in MAP27-immunized mice post S. aureus infection. the percentage of IL-17A+CD3+CD4+ cells in spleen is not statistically different among the three groups. splenocytes from MAP27-immunized mice produced significantly more IL-2 and IFN- than cells from control mice upon stimulation by. in vitro MAP27 treatment promoted the production of IFN- in spleen cells from MAP27-immunized mice. spleenocytes isolated from the mice (n = 5 mice per group) were cultured at 2105/well in pre-coated plates. the concentrations of IL-2 (A), IFN- (B) and IL-4 (C) in supernatant were measured by ELISA. the number of IFN--producing cells from MAP27-immunized mice was significantly higher than that from MAPctrl-immunized mice (P = 0.001) or blank control mice (P = 0.001) again, we could not identify IL-17A-producing cells by ELISPOT assay. we speculate that immunization with MAP27 may predominantly induce Th1 cell response. heat-inactivated S. aureus promoted Th1 and Th17 cell responses in the spleen of MAP27-immunized mice. splenocytes isolated from the mice were cultured (2105/well) and stimulated with 2104 CFU/well heated-inactivated S. aureus for 72 h. the failure to develop an effective vaccine against S. aureus is partly due to the high complexity of the numerous virulence factors expressed at different infection stages. we used PGN, a conserved cell wall component of S. aureus as the target, and designed a de novo synthetic multiple antigenic peptide (MAP27) for mimicking a PGN epitope. MAP27-immunization could still protect mice from S.aureus systemic infection. previous studies have shown that IL-17 and Th17 are critical for protection from S.aureus infection. MAP27 immunization may induce different subsets of T cells to secrete IFN- post infection. different from heat-inactivated S. aureus stimulation, MAP27 failed to induce IL-17A/F in splenocytes. this result can be explained by the fact of the inhibitory role of IFN- in vitro.
