{"summary": "a new strain of the H1N1 subtype of influenza A resulted in a pandemic outbreak. in south Korea, cases of pandemic influenza have increased. therefore, we explored perception or preventive behaviors for this virus in hospital employees and outpatients. the first mortality due to H1N1 was reported in south Korea in august 2009, followed within a month by hundreds of reported cases. less than half of the public responders had anxiety for pandemic influenza or thought that pandemic influenza seriously affected their health. the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Dongguk University Gyeongju Hospital. participants were classified as hospital employees and outpatients. each group was calculated frequency and percentage. of the outpatients, 399 (41.7%) were below 40 years old. 394 (41.2%) were 40-59-years-of-age and 164 (17.1%) were over 60 years old. males and females comprised 53.2% and 46.8% of the respondents. of the outpatients, 631 (65.9%) performed the preventative behaviors. 280 (29.3%) performed avoidance behaviors. four hundred and eighty-four of the outpatients (50.6%) desired vaccination. a half of both hospital employees and outpatients felt that they were easily infected by pandemic influenza, while less than half thought that pandemic influenza was a serious disease. at the time of the WHO phase 5 alert, only 20-30% of respondents perceived that pandemic influenza was serious. outpatient data differed from those of a previous study in the UK. more than half of the general population perceived the efficacy of hand washing, while only 37% performed recommended behaviors. this difference may reflect a selection bias due to convenience sampling adopted. this rate was low in health care workers, in contrast to our results, and high in those afflicted with chronic diseases such as asthma,13,14. lack of data prevented us from assessing the vaccination rate in those at high risk."}
