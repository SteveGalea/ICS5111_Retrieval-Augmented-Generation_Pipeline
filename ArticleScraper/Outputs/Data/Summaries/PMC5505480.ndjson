{"summary": "influenza is the best known for its ability to drift, re-assort and cause yearly seasonal outbreaks in the temperate regions of the world. seasonal influenza is caused by influenza A or B viruses and affects 5\u201315% of the human population every year. symptoms vary from mild respiratory complaints to fatal respiratory distress syndrome. a number of changes in our globalizing world contribute to the growing importance of this group. these changes highlight the importance of harmonized international and national guidelines for influenza prevention and treatment in travel medicine. this includes travel, mass gathering, cruise ships and large-scale events. influenza viruses may be transmitted by aerosol/droplet transmission. most likely seasonal influenza viruses first replicate in the columnar epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. shedding of seasonal strains from the upper respiratory tract can be highly efficient. the increased risk of being infected with seasonal influenza appears not to be limited to the period directly before and during the actual flight. the most recent analysis document a rate of 8.9 (95% CI 7.1\u201310.9) per 100 person-months. but only 10% had ILI. influenza is seen especially among those at the extremes of age (elderly and very young), those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women. chronic pulmonary disease31, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and malignancies are also considered risk factors for developing severe influenza. hygienic measures include active ventilation of crowded places, hand sanitation and (possibly) wearing a facemask can reduce the risk of spreading influenza. influenza prevention by vaccination and specific problems associated with vaccinating travellers are discussed in more detail below. neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs: oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) are the most effective anti-influenza drugs. the most effective anti-influenza drugs are the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs: oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) some consider the use of NIs controversial because almost all published studies have been industry-funded. a recent independent meta-analysis showed that oseltamivir in adults with influenza accelerates clinical symptom alleviation, reduces risk of lower respiratory tract complications, and admission to hospital. elderly or other high-risk groups in which vaccine efficacy can be low, could be advised to consider bringing a NI for influenza early treatment. oseltamivir is FDA registered for influenza treatment for any age and as chemoprophylaxis from 3 months of age. age cut-offs for zanamivir use are currently 7 and 5 years. influenza is widely considered a relatively mild and self-limiting disease. a priori chance of developing typhoid fever, hepatitis A or tetanus during a two and half week trip to an Asian destination is much lower than being infected with an influenza virus. however, at least according to most guidelines issued in industrialized nations, these three immunizations are usually recommended for most travellers going to many developing countries while influenza vaccination is often not even considered. influenza vaccines proved safe and effective for pregnant women and their unborn babies. the advice might be broadened to pregnant women travelling to influenza endemic areas and possibly to persons in close contact with pregnant women or other high-risk individuals, like partners and close family members. 60% of ill Hajjis presenting with respiratory tract complaints. the rapid increase in case numbers during the 6-day Hajj confirms the predisposing conditions for influenza transmission during this pilgrimage. cruise ship influenza outbreaks typically affect 2\u20137% of passengers. cruise ship influenza outbreaks typically affect 2\u20137% of passengers. increased vaccination coverage of passengers and crew would be expected to result in decreasing disease burden. human cases of severe avian influenza virus infections have been reported in Asia since 1997 when a highly pathogenic (for poultry) avian influenza A H5N1 infection affected 18 people in Hongkong, 6 of whom died,91\u201393 there have not yet been many reports of avian influenza in travellers. travel advice should be given to travellers planning to visit areas endemic for avian influenza in poultry and where human cases have occurred. such areas are currently found in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. advice should focus on avoiding contacts with patients suffering from respiratory disease. demic influenza and travel medicine Data and recommendations will be issued by international and national health authorities largely based on the knowledge available regarding the influenza strain as it spread. vaccination advice, antiviral use and target groups will likely differ between pandemics and therefore tailor-made advice should be provided. commercial vaccines often maintain acceptable potency for months after they have \u2018expired\u2019. efforts should be made to make opposite hemisphere influenza vaccines available at least for travel clinics. seasonal and avian influenza is the most frequent vaccine preventable disease in travellers. influenza is the most frequent vaccine preventable disease in travellers,11. most likely seasonal influenza viruses first replicate in the columnar epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. demic H1N1 (2009) infection calculated overall attack rates for acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the 1\u20137 days following travel, passenger attack rates were 5.2 and 2.4% respectively, of which a significant proportion were confirmed to be influenza by serology. the number of confirmed influenza cases rose to prevalence figures of 11, 12, 18 and as high as 32%. a large study of influenza virus infection in persons travelling to tropical and sub-tropical countries found that 1.1% of the travellers enrolled in the study seroconverted. 40% of those who seroconverted had sought medical attention during their travel. patients with severe viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), post-influenza Staphylococcus aureus infection with a potential Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection and rare examples of myocarditis and encephalitis. the increased risk of being infected with seasonal influenza appears not to be limited to the period directly before and during the actual flight. however, only 10% of travellers had ILI. influenza attack rate of serologically confirmed infection during travel was 15%. high morbidity and mortality in influenza are seen especially among those at the extremes of age (elderly and very young), those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women. chronic pulmonary disease31, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and malignancies are also considered risk factors for developing severe influenza or complications. hygienic measures, including active ventilation of crowded places, hand sanitation and (possibly) wearing a facemask can reduce the risk of spreading influenza. influenza prevention by vaccination and specific problems associated with vaccinating travellers are discussed in more detail below. neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs: oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) are the

effective for pregnant women and their unborn babies. the advice might be broadened to pregnant women travelling to influenza endemic areas and possibly to persons in close contact with pregnant women. influenza vaccination status of travellers in defined risk categories should be checked. 60% of ill Hajjis presenting with respiratory tract complaints. the rapid increase in case numbers during the 6-day Hajj confirms the predisposing conditions for influenza transmission during this pilgrimage. cruise ship influenza outbreaks typically affect 2\u20137% of passengers. cruise ship influenza outbreaks typically affect 2\u20137% of passengers. increased Influenza vaccination coverage of passengers and crew could reduce disease burden. some studies have addressed the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing influenza spread, especially in the case of a pandemic. hand hygiene and facemasks appear to reduce household transmission of influenza virus when implemented within 36 h of symptom onset of the index patient. the most effective anti-influenza drugs are the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs: oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) the neuraminidase inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) are rarely used since they suffer from rapid development of virus resistance and virtually all currently circulating seasonal influenza A viruses have pre-existing resistance. icacy suggest they should only play a limited role in routine pre-travel advice. in many countries NI requires a medical script to be purchased. these drugs could also play a role in mass transportation settings like cruises or group travel. seltamivir is FDA registered for influenza treatment for any age and as chemoprophylaxis from 3 months of age. age cut-offs for zanamivir use are currently 7 and 5 years, respectively. influenza vaccination should be part of regular pre-travel advice for all travellers. elderly individuals and those with serious co-morbidities would be candidates for influenza vaccination even without travel plans. however, it remains important to assess vaccination status and to evaluate whether or not the strains the individual has been vaccinated against are appropriate for the geographic area and season of the travel plans. the effectiveness of influenza vaccines is often impaired in individuals who could benefit most from vaccination. every year more than 10 million pilgrims from all over the world visit the holy places of Islam in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. one-third of these pilgrims will perform this religious obligation during a 6-day fixed period, called the Hajj. the remaining two-thirds will perform the Umrah, which can be done at any time in the year. almost 50% of pilgrims in the 2009 Hajj had at least one risk factor for the development of severe influenza. despite the Saudi government requirement, a recent cross-sectional study showed vaccination coverage in Malaysian pilgrims to be only 65.2%. non-pharmaceutical measures (e.g. hand hygiene, wearing face masks and social distancing) could further reduce influenza transmission during the Hajj. increased Influenza vaccination coverage would be expected to result in decreasing disease burden. mismatches between circulating and vaccine strains may reduce effectiveness of this strategy. in 2009, a previously established European Union project actively promoted measures to prevent communicable disease outbreaks on passenger ships. a 59-year-old woman visited a poultry market in south china as a tourist. she developed dyspnea and haemoptysis due to severe pneumonia. the risk of acquiring avian influenza is relatively low, but such rare but frequently fatal infections in travellers must be considered during pre-travel advice. only limited data are available about direct and indirect bird-to-human transmission and prevention in travellers going to areas endemic for avian influenza in poultry. a questionnaire-based study among backpackers went to areas with outbreaks of avian H5N1 virus in poultry suggests an overall poor knowledge of this infection. poultry products for human consumption should be fully cooked. only limited data available about direct and indirect bird-to-human transmission in travellers going to areas endemic for avian influenza. based on the knowledge available regarding the influenza strain as it spreads. vaccination advice, antiviral use and target groups will likely differ between pandemics. tailor-made advice may also be appropriate in this setting to reduce spreading of the pandemic virus through air travel. hemisphere influenza vaccines available at least for travel clinics. success in the development of more universal influenza vaccines would bring great benefits for the combat of influenza in high-risk groups. current data show that vaccine coverage among travellers can be greatly improved. experts advice about preventive hygienic and behavioural measures, vaccination and options for antiviral treatment should become routine elements of pre-travel counselling. influenza vaccination should be strongly recommended for people in high-risk groups such as the elderly and the immune compromised.
