{"summary": "cytoplasmic nonmembranous structures known as stress granules (SGs) are sites of non-translating messenger ribounucleoproteins (mRNPs) aggregation under stress conditions. SGs are involved in various stress-induced signaling cascades such as inflammatory signaling and stress-induced apoptotic signaling. eIF2 phosphorylation by one of the selective stress-activated kinases inhibits translation initiation by reducing the availability of eIF2-GTP-tRNAiMet ternary complex. other studies showed phospho-eIF2 independent mechanisms that induce translation inhibition and SG formation. high levels of ROS subject the cells to oxidative stress, which forces the cell to possese certain abilities to combat stress conditions. stress-signaling pathways were found to play a role in ESC differentiation process [33] also found to be an important regulator of human (h)ESC pluripotency. LIN28A and L1TD1 are SG markers and identified DPPA5 as a weakly recruited SG component. granules formed in stressed hiPSCs are typical SGs. cell colonies were grown in mTeSR media (STEMCELL technologies) mouse monoclonal antibodies to eIF3n and TIAR were purchased from Santa Cruz. mouse monoclonal antibodies to eIF3n and TIAR were purchased from BD Biosciences. cells were washed thrice with PBS, fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde for 15\u201330 minutes at room temp (RT), then washed three times with TBST (TBS with 0.2% Tween) cells were then incubated with continuous shaking overnight at 4\u00b0C with the desired primary antibodies, diluted in the blocking buffer. cells were washed three times with PBS, dissociated using ReLeSR. cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen), then extracted from treated or non-treated cells.

CCCH zinc finger (ZF) RBD and RNA Recognition motif (RRM) domain. the K homology (KH) domain is recognized as the RBD of DPPA5. cells were left untreated or treated with either SA or HS. some of these aggregates co-localize with G3BP SGs (white arrows) whereas others do not (Fig 5A; SA and 42\u00b0C). LIN28A is highly recruited to SGs (white arrows), as shown by its strong co-localization with G3BP. assembled granules exhibit typical SGs features, including shape, size, number, composition, and disassembly process. RNA binding pluripotent markers LIN28A, L1TD1, and DPPA5 are selectively recruited to SGs in stressed hiPSCs. granules formed in response to both HS and SA treatments resemble those formed in mammalian cells [53] the formation of SGs in stressed ESCs may be one of these protective mechanisms during development. this assumption is supported by the fact that SGs are able to selectively sequester and protect mRNA from degradation, which will eventually be required for ESC development. ARE elements containing mRNAs were found to be highly recruited to SGs. TIAR binds to NANOG mRNA and/or other ARE elements of mRNAs. this could be due to the high expression of glutathione peroxidases (Gpxs) hiPSCs are stress-specific and stimulate the recruitment of selective PPMs. it is possible that SGs selectively sequester different classes of mRNAs and proteins that regulate pluripotency. thus SGs may be a switch between self-renewal and differentiation. representative fluorescence microscopy images showing hiPSCs treated with 125M SA, subjected to HS (42\u00b0C), or left untreated. insets show magnified views of SGs in individual and merged channels (yellow)."}
