{"summary": "pneumonia is the eighth most common cause of death in the u.s., responsible for 53,282 deaths in the u.s. alone in 2013. the elderly and those with comorbidities are also at increased risk of developing pneumonia. an effective early immune response in the lower respiratory tract is crucial for a successful elimination of microbes. cells of the innate immune system possess germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors that can sense conserved microbial molecules referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) the review has been divided to describe inflammasome assembly and activation. NLRP1 and possibly NLRP12 leads to formation of caspase-1-containing inflammasomes. the inflammasomes involved in pulmonary host defense against infections are listed in Table 1. the inflammasomes involved in pulmonary host defense against infections are listed in Table 1. NLRP3 inflammasome is activated via MAVS, which are intact mitochondrial outer membrane proteins 50 Influenza virus, PB1-F2 and M2 proteins Mitofusin 2 (Mfn 2). RNA of the virus, PB1-F2 protein and M2 proteins are probable ligands. Yersinia pestis (ligand unknown but associated with T3SS) TLR-4 recognizes LPS, upregulation of NLRP12, pro IL-1, IL-18 secretion, inducing IFN- 24 K. pneumoniae (ligand unknown) NLRP12 upregulation in pneumonia, augmented NF-B, MAPK, and expression of histone deacetylases. rod proteins activate NLRC4 with proinflammatory cytokine secretion via caspase-1 activation 37 K. pneumoniae Activation of NLRC4 host protection via IL-1, IL-17A, KC, MIP-2, LIX, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, NF-B and MAPK activity, TNF-, ligand unknown 42 NLRC5 NOD27, NOD4, CLR16.1 Viral Human rhinovirus NLRC5 and viropor successful inflammasome activation and IL-1 production depends on two signals. the first is a priming step that involves recognition of PAMPs by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and recognition of microbial peptidoglycan by NOD1 and NOD2 in the cytosol. the second signal involves the activation of inflammasomes by intracellular stimuli. two-step sequence for activation of mature proinflammatory cytokines serves as a safety mechanism preventing uncontrolled activation and secretion of cytokines. the downstream signaling cascades are generally conserved, although the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in inflammasome activation remain elusive. F. tularensis = Francisella tularensis; HIN200 = hematopoietic expression, interferon-inducible nature, and nuclear localization domain 200; K. pneumoniae = Klebsiella pneumoniae; L. monocytogenes = Legionella pneumophila; LRR = leucine-rich repeat; M. catarrhalis = Moraxella catarrhalis; MDP = muramyl dipeptide; the best characterized inflammasome is NLRP3 (5), which is upregulated in immune and inflammatory cells after infection or inflammatory insult (6). the best characterized inflammasome is NLRP3 (5), which is known to be activated by three different classes of stimuli. NLRP3 inflammasome activates mitochondrial DNA or cardiolipin. NLRP3 inflammasome activates mitochondrial damage, ROS generation, and release of mtDNA into the cytosol. NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to host defense against numerous microbial infections. NLRP12 is downregulated by agonists like lipopolysaccharide and by microorganisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resulting in increased secretion of IL-6 (23). NLRP12 signaling is important for host survival and bacterial clearance during K. pneumoniae infection. the NLRC4 inflammasome includes NLRC4, ASC, caspase-1, and NLR family apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) the NLRC4 inflammasome includes NLRC4, ASC, caspase-1, and NLR family apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) mouse NAIP1 and NAIP2 bind to needle and rod proteins of the type III secretion system, whereas NAIP5 and NAIP6 bind to flagellin. the human NAIP recognizes type III secretion system needles as well as type IV secretion system-associated flagellin. cytosolic F. tularensis induced a type I IFN response by IRF. cytosolic F. tularensis induced a type I IFN response by IRF. FN is critical for inflammasome activation and caspase-1\u2013dependent release of IL-1 and IL-18 (48) pneumonia (including influenza infections) is the eighth leading cause of deaths in the united states in 2014. ATP signaling via the P2X7 receptor is essential for NLRP3 activation in vivo (56). ATP signaling via the P2X7 receptor is believed to control ion channel activity, resulting in caspase-1 maturation and IL-1 release. the human RSV acts through its small hydrophobic viroporin. the small hydrophobic viroporin affects the ion gradient by forming a pore or channel in the plasma membrane. the subsequent ionic changes cause inflammasome activation (54) the small hydrophobic protein of the metapneumovirus was found to act similarly to a viroporin. NLRC5 has the longest chain of LRRs at the COOH terminus among all human NLRs. NLRC5 was reported to adopt a death domain fold without homology to CARD or PYD domains (65), and Kuenzel and colleagues (66) have reported that it does possess a CARD domain at the N-terminus. pediatric cases of SARS were also associated with elevated IL-1 and IL-18. a possible mechanism for inflammasome activation by SARS-CoV is through its E protein. it acts as a cation channel and favors Na+ influx over K+ influx. pothlichet and colleagues have shown the activation of NLRP3 via IFN-1 pathway during influenza infection in vivo and in vitro. optimum IL-1 secretion required upregulation of TLR3 and NLRP3 mediated by RIG-I. further studies to discern the role of IFN in inflammasome activation are needed. IL-18 secretion was found to be essential to confer protection against A. fumigatus in an immunocompromised mouse model (77) a separate study using Nlrp3-deficient mice showed increased host protection and reduced fungal load in the lungs. sregulated Inflammasome Activation and its Regulation Inflammasome activation is critical for containment of pathogens. however, its uncontrolled activation can drive pathologic inflammatory responses leading to extensive host tissue damage. mice deficient in Nlrp3 displayed reduced lung pathologies that were associated with decreased neutrophil recruitment in the lungs (20) the severity of the disease was associated with upregulation of Il-1 and Nlrp3 mRNA transcripts. an efficient inflammasome-mediated host response would eventually subside. the host regulatory mechanisms are critical to control the checkpoints of inflammasome activation. the role of inflammasomes in bacterial, viral, and fungal pneumonia remains elusive. there is little or no information regarding the role of inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of disease by respiratory pathogens. the challenge for the immediate future will be to apply current understanding of inflammasomes to reduce tissue damage caused by excessive and unregulated inflammation."}
