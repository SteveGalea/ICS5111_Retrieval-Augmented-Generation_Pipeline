{"summary": "endothelial cells express chemokines and adhesion molecules that facilitate infiltration of circulating leukocytes into CNS parenchyma. increased levels of inflammatory mediators in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum, such as interferon- (IFN), have been shown to cause endothelial dysfunction. multiple sclerosis is most common clinical presentation of multiple sclerosis. relapse is considered to be the clinical expression of acute focal inflammatory demyelination. current clinical anti-inflammatory therapies for acute multiple sclerosis are limited. NRP1 is highly expressed in specific subsets of developing neurons. it is expressed at relatively low levels in the normal CNS. the expression of NRP1 is lost soon after neuronal circuits have been established. the potential involvement of NRP1 in pathogenesis of neurological diseases had been indicated by evidence. increased NRP1 levels were observed in microvascular endothelial cells. RESULTS Knockdown of NRP1 inhibits IFN-stimulated activation of STAT1 and expression of CXCL10 in a Rac1-dependent manner. HBMVECs were transfected with control siRNA (Csi) or NRP1 siRNA (Nsi) for 24 h and then stimulated with IFN (10 ng ml1) for 15 min. expression of CXCL10 was quantified by qPCR and expressed as fold of that in the control group, which was normalized to 1. n=5 for each group. HBMVECs were pretreated with Rac1 inhibitor NSC 23766 (NSC) for 1 h. then stimulated with IFN (10 ng ml1) for 24 h. total RNA was extracted and subjected to qPCR analysis. expressed levels of CXCL10 are reported as a relative fold of the control group. Rac1 inhibitor NSC 23766 significantly suppressed IFN-induced expression of CXCL10 in HBMVECs. the knockdown of NRP1 significantly inhibited IFN-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1. however, this inhibitive effect on the phosphorylation of STAT1 was attenuated in HBMVECs. receptor tyrosine kinase (Tie2)/NRP1/ mice showed normal viability after administration of tamoxifen. we crossed VECad-Cre-ERT2 mice with ROSA26R reporter mice. to investigate the role of endothelial NRP1 in neuroinflammatory diseases, an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model was then developed in VECad/NRP1/ mice. expression of CXCL10 was extremely low in normal spinal cords. however, its expression was induced in spinal cords after induction of EAE. endothelial-cell-derived chemokines contribute to inflammatory cell infiltration. the three right bar graphs in D represent different cell populations. data are expressed as mean95% confidence intervals in the graphs on the right. VECad/NRP1/ mice showed a significant reduction in the number of NK1+CD3+ natural killer T (NKT) or NKT-like cells within the population of CD45+ spinal-cord-infiltrating leukocytes. inflammatory responses were further evaluated in spinal cord tissues 17 days after administration of MOG35\u201355, when mice reached the peak of disease presentation. representative images of spinal cords from WT mice showed diffused distribution of albumin. spinal cords of VECad/NRP1/ mice showed a more restricted accumulation of albumin in the vasculature. however, tight junction structures were better preserved and were accompanied by much less leakage of FITC\u2013albumin. FITC\u2013albumin was administered to mice and KO (VECad/NRP1/) mice through tail vein injection 2 h before killing at 14 days after EAE induction. half of each spinal cord was subjected to frozen sectioning (A) and immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against occludin (red) (B). EAE induction led to progressive disease in control mice. characterized by weight loss and ascending paralysis. however, VECad/NRP1/ mice exhibited lower disease incidence. t2-weighted MRI scans were used to evaluate lesions in brains 14 days post EAE induction. hyper-intense regions correspond to inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss, were observed in the cerebellum of WT mice. endothelial NRP1 is induced in human acute multiple sclerosis lesions. immunohistochemistry analysis of NRP1 in normal human tonsil tissues reveals strong NRP1 expression in the endothelium. images are representative of three technical replicates. knockdown of NRP1 inhibits IFN-stimulated activation of STAT1 and expression of CXCL10 in a Rac1-dependent manner. knockdown of NRP1 significantly attenuated IFN-induced chemokines, including CXCL10 and CXCL11. HBMVECs were transfected with control siRNA (Csi) or NRP1 siRNA (Nsi) for 24 h and then stimulated with IFN (10 ng ml1) for 15 min. expression of CXCL10 was quantified by qPCR and expressed as a relative fold of that in the control group, which was normalized to 1. n=5 for each group. HBMVECs were infected with a lentivirus expressing Rac1 61L or LacZ as control for 24 h and then transfected with control siRNA (Csi) or NRP1 siRNA (Nsi) for another 24 h. total protein lysates were collected after stimulation with IFN (10 ng ml1) for 15 min. expression levels of Rac1 61L were similar between control and NRP1-knockdown HBMVECs. the knockdown of NRP1 significantly inhibited IFN-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1. however, this inhibitive effect on the phosphorylation of STAT1 was attenuated in HBMVECs. tamoxifen administration induced efficient recombination in endothelium of adult tissues, including the brain and spinal cord. we crossed VECad-Cre-ERT2 mice with ROSA26R reporter mice to examine the specificity and efficiency of Cre activity after tamoxifen administration. helial-cell-derived chemokines contribute to inflammatory cell infiltration and EAE disease progression. induction of endothelial NRP1 in spinal cords was also observed after MOG35\u201355 administration. results suggest deletion of endothelial NRP1 suppressed the STAT1\u2013CXCL10 pathway in spinal cords. spinal cords were harvested 17 days after EAE induction. they were cut into 10\u201312 slabs/per spinal cord, fixed, embedded in paraffin blocks. mice were subjected to qPCR analysis. inflammatory responses were further evaluated in spinal cord tissues. the results in Fig. 2E,F show extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells. limited infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in the spinal cords. disruption of tight junction structures (staining for occludin) was present in spinal cords of the WT mice. however, in the VECad/NRP1/ mice, tight junction structures were better preserved. presence of BBB leakage in the cerebellums of WT mice was visualized. FITC\u2013albumin was administered to Tie2-Cre/NRP1flox/wt (Tie2/NRP1+/+) mice and Tie2-Cre+/NRP1flox/wt mice through tail vein injection 2 h before killing 21 days after EAE induction. half of each spinal cord was subjected to frozen sectioning. deletion of endothelial NRP1 inhibits disease progression in EAE. four-week-old mice and KO littermates were immunized with tamoxifen. behavioural scores (A) and body weights (B) were monitored. endothelial NRP1 is upregulated in human multiple sclerosis lesions. immunohistochemistry was performed in normal and multiple-sclerosis-affected CNS tissues to identify expression pattern of NRP1. normal human spinal cord samples showed limited NRP1 immunoreactivity in subpial regions. Enlarged view (inset) shows NRP1+ glial cells. the enlarged view indicates NRP1 endothelial cells. our findings provide evidence that deletion of NRP1 inhibits the effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN and TNF in HBMVECs. targeting endothelial NRP1 signaling could be a potential avenue to suppress inflammatory responses. our results show that NRP1 mediates IFN-stimulated expression of chemokines in cerebral endothelial cells through a Rac1\u2013STAT1-dependent pathway. Rac1 acts as a downstream mediator of NRP1 to activate STAT1 in HBMVECs. the T-cell response to myelin antigen is considered one of the biggest causes of demyelination in multiple sclerosis. selective deletion of NRP1 in endothelial cells attenuates EAE and alters endothelial cell production of CXCL10 in response to IFN stimulation. endothelial cells are primary sources of CXCL10 in sural nerve biopsies from individuals with classical Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. non-endothelial-cell-derived CXCL10 is also involved in the progression of neuroinflammatory diseases. our study is consistent with previous studies showing that treatment with anti-CXCL10 antibody reduces clinical and histological disease severity and prevents recruitment of activated CD4+ T cells to the CNS parenchyma. an early reduction in spinal cord NKT cell number attenuates ongoing endothelial responses that retain pathogenic T cells, reducing overall disease severity. it may be reasonable to identify the T-cell receptor restriction of these NKT cells to determine whether they are a direct cause of pathogenesis or are immunomodulatory. endothelial NRP1 attenuates leaking of FITC\u2013albumin from the CNS parenchyma. infiltrated inflammatory cells, especially CD8+ lymphocytes, were shown to stimulate resident CNS cells, including astrocytes, microglia and neurons, to release factors to increase BBB permeability. study suggests that NRP1 is involved in astrocyte, microglia and macrophages activation in neuroinflammatory diseases. the results of our study identify a dual pro-inflammatory role of NRP1 in cerebral endothelial cells. the investigator who performed the oral gavage was blind to the genotypes of the mice. animals were crossed with NRP1flox/flox mice to generate the mice. none of the mice were excluded from this study. mice were immunized subcutaneously in both flanks with 100 mg of MOG35-55 peptide. pertussis toxin was then injected intraperitoneally at day 0 and day 2 post immunization. each quadrant from each transverse section from the same mouse was examined for the presence or absence of a pathological abnormality. the maximum score of 100 indicates that there was a pathological abnormality present in all four quadrants of the spinal cord sections. HBMVECs and HMVECs were authenticated by testing for the expression of von Williebrand Factor VIII and cytoplasmic uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein. all the cells were negative for mycoplasma. chemistry staining of human multiple sclerosis tissues was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. x-gal staining Fresh tissues were harvested, snap-frozen in OCT and sectioned at 5 m. files were analyzed offline using FlowJo 7.5 (Windows version; Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). CD45 was detected with antibody clone 30-F11 (BD Biosciences no. 557235). Ly6C and Ly6G were detected with clone 1A8 (BD Biosciences no. 553776). vance II 7 Tesla vertical bore small animal MRI system (Bruker Biospin) mice were anesthetized through isoflurane inhalation and maintained under 3\u20134% isoflurane. each mouse's respiratory rate was monitored during MRI acquisition. an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test was performed for Figs 2B,G,H and 3D. clinical behavior and body weight changes after EAE induction were analyzed by using two-way ANOVA. mice were allocated to experimental groups owing to their predetermined type. no randomization was used. animals were allocated to experimental groups. 10- to 12-week-old male mice were immunized subcutaneously in both flanks. pertussis toxin (Sigma Chemicals; 200 ng) was then injected intraperitoneally at day 0 and day 2 post immunization. FITC\u2013albumin (Sigma Chemicals) was dissolved in PBS (10 mg ml1) and administered to mice through a 100-l tail vein injection 2 h before killing. half of the spinal cords were homogenized in RIPA buffer and centrifuged, and the supernatant collected. HBMVECs and HMVECs were authenticated by testing for expression of von Williebrand Factor VIII and cytoplasmic uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein. all the cells were negative for mycoplasma. x-gal staining Fresh tissues were harvested, snap-frozen in OCT and sectioned at 5 m. the staining was performed as previously described (Ji et al., 2008). antibody clone 30-F11 was detected with clone M1/70 (BD Biosciences no. 553312). Ly6C and Ly6G (lymphocyte antigens) were detected with clone 1A8 (BD Biosciences no. 553128). CD45.1 was detected with clone A20 (BD Biosciences no. 553776). three-dimensional T2*-weighted images were acquired using the Analyze function (Biomedical Imaging Resource, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) we experienced no animal death, and the animals recovered after anesthesia and image acquisition. for small sample sizes (n5) in Figs 1D,E, 3D, Figs S1 and S2 scatter plots are used to present data."}
