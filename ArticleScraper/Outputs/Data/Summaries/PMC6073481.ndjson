{"summary": "nanotechnology advances have revealed new possibilities for the development of biosensors with improved performance based on the unique properties of nanoparticles. plasmonic nanoparticles have gained particular interest from various scientists and engineers because of their unique physical and chemical properties. gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have drawn enormous interest, due to their easy preparation, biocompatibility, inertness, and intense colors. the localization of the electromagnetic field results in the amplification of SPR signals and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) [1,15]. fluorescent signals can also be quenched or enhanced due to the energy transfer between the GNP and fluorophore [16]. a high molar extinction coefficient and significant color changes can be observed by aggregating GNPs, resulting in the development of naked-eye-based biosensors [17]. the size of metal becomes nanoscale relative to the bulk material, resulting in a confined and non-propagating localized surface plasmon around the nanoparticle with a specific frequency known as the LSPR. these spectral characteristics of GNPs are independent of size, shape, and the local dielectric environment. the refractive index changes induced by an adsorbate on a GNP can be used to monitor molecular binding events. single-nanoparticle-based LSPR biosensors have several advantages, such as higher sensitivity and smaller sample volume requirements. compared to array systems, single-nanoparticle-based LSPR biosensors have several advantages. the hybridization of complementary DNA resulted in a significant blue shift of the LSPR maximum. the hybridization of complementary DNA also resulted in a significant blue shift of the LSPR maximum. the hybridization of complementary DNA resulted in a significant blue shift of the LSPR maximum. this results in a 2\u20135-order magnitude enhancement of the local electromagnetic field intensity at the nanoparticle surface, which is the key to the huge enhancement in SERS [28,29]. recent studies of SERS on metal nanoparticles demonstrated the importance of having local field \u201chotspots\u201d due to surface roughness [30,31], nanogaps between aggregated plasmonic NPs [32,33], or NP-metal surfaces [34] which can induce higher EM enhancements a biosensor acts as a direct biosensor by detecting specific signals from target biomolecules, such as neurotransmitters [38], nucleosides [39] and microRNA (miRNA) [40] Tu and his coworkers developed a SERS-based serotonin analysis method by using GNPs in the presence of various closely related precursors and metabolites. a Raman barcoding-based biosensor with GNPs was developed. the system combines GNPs\u2019 SERS and catalytic properties. the nanomaterial embedded GNPs and glucose oxidases in the metal\u2013organic framework to generate hydroperoxide. SERS-based biosensors using GNPs have shown great performance. improvements are needed to overcome current limitations, including signal reproducibility and sensitivity. the Purcell effect is negligible between plasmonic metals and fluorophores. a small peptide sequence with a fluorophore (fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC) on one end was conjugated to the GNP through the functional amine group on the other end. the presence of target miRNA led to the hybridization of DNA\u2013RNA strands. fluorescence (PEF) based on shell thickness to optimize fluorescence enhancement. rhodamine b (RhB) as a fluorophore for bacteria imaging and sensing. plasmon resonance maximum of the core\u2013shell nanoparticles was able to be red shifted due to interactions with the GNP core. the color of the GNP solution is also affected by the LSPR phenomenon upon the aggregation and dispersion of the GNPs. the aggregation of GNPs can induce the coupling of the plasmon modes when the interparticle distances are less than 2.5 times their diameters. the aggregation of the GNPs is influenced by changes to the external environment. non-crosslinking aggregation-based colorimetric biosensors show limitations in signal stability, reproducibility, and target specificity. these non-crosslinking aggregation-based biosensors show several limitations in signal stability, reproducibility, and target specificity. the presence of cysteine analyte can be detected in a specific manner. aptamer-modified colorimetric biosensors have been developed to detect proteins [67], peptides [71], and bacteria [72]. nanoparticle-based plasmonic biosensors have been reported to improve their plasmonic properties in the specific optical systems for the targeted applications. for example, controlling the interparticle gap distance of GNPs to generate \u201chotspots\u201d for the LSPR-based biosensor. a lack of signal reproducibility, standardization, and the necessity of confirmation with conventional methods forms a hurdle for the plasmonic biosensors to be fully implemented in practice. spectroelectrochemical biosensors can be one of the ways to break through current limitations (i.e., difficulty distinguishing similarly structured chemicals) of plasmonic biosensors. proper immobilization of enzymes tends to improve stability. plasmonic biosensors will find more impactful applications in biological, biochemical, and medical fields."}
