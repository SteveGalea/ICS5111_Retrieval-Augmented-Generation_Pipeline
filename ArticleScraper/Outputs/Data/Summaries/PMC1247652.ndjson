{"summary": "geographic information system (GIS) technology can be used during an acute infectious disease outbreak to reveal crucial real-time, quantitative information. the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) ultimately accounted for more than 8,000 cases in 29 countries. cluster analysis produced a series of 12 kernel maps based on date of symptom onset. these maps showed the density of SARS patients (adjusted for underlying population density) on typical days representing different stages of the 16-week outbreak."}
