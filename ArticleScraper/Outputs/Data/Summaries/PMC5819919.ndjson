{"summary": "new advances in the field of Clinical Virology and Molecular Medicine have expanded the level of knowledge on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral infections occurring in infancy and childhood. new advances in the field of Clinical Virology and Molecular Medicine have expanded the level of knowledge on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral infections occurring in infancy and childhood. 7 out of the 10 top key messages of the \u20183rd workshop on paediatric Virology\u2019 included recommendations on specific prevention strategies against viral infections. this included the necessity of vaccination policy in relation to the migration crisis, prevention of hepatitis in newborns, recent advances on influenza vaccines, male vaccination against HPVs and the preventative role of probiotics in the management of viral infections in children. imaging \u2018Imaging of fetal and neonatal viral infections is unable to provide the specific diagnosis; however it can contribute in defining the extent of involvement and reveal the consequences that affect the outcome\u2019. males are the main transmitters of high risk HPV, having more HPV-positive oropharyngeal and anal cancers than females. homosexual males would not profit from a herd effect, when 80% or even more of females had been vaccinated. human breast feeding has been documented to have a beneficial effect on the avoidance of viral infections. it reduces the risk of developing certain malignant tumours arising in early childhood, e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or in young adolescence, e.g., Hodgkin\u2019s disease (HD). prematurely born infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) need increased healthcare utilisation and poorer pulmonary functions at school age (14) there are limited data to suggest that rhinovirus (RV) may adversely affect respiratory-related outcomes in prematurely born infants. several infections are viral, e.g., herpes-group viruses, polyomaviruses and Torque teno viruses. the fate of the latent genomes seems to vary substantially. during prolonged latency, their genomes may become defective and can eventually be degraded. long term effects of viral infections on prematurely born infants chronic respiratory morbidity is common in prematurely born infants. prematurely born infants are functionally (9,10) and genetically (11) predisposed to RSV LRTIs, but their lung function in infancy is worse after the LRTI (12,13) ongoing research at King\u2019s College London (UK) has recently re-examined prematurely born cohorts at school age (5\u20138 years) for which data on all respiratory viral infections in infancy, as well as whether hospital admission was required (17). infants with an extremely low birthweight requiring prolonged ventilation were at an increased risk of suffering from an RV LRTI in infancy. a high vaccination coverage is required for the protection of refugees, migrants and asylum seekers, as well as for the population of the hosting countries. in Greece, an imperative need emerged for implementing supplementary immunisation activities, particularly to refugee children living in the \u2018Points of care\u2019, all over the country. hepatitis B is responsible for 90% of all hepatitis mortalities globally. mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is responsible for 35\u201350% of chronic HBV infections. MTCT of HBV occurs mostly during birth and more rarely in utero or post-natally. the prevention of MTCT of HBV can be achieved in 99% of cases, by delivering the birth dose of the HBV vaccine within 24 h of birth. the risk of MTCT of HBV is highest in infants born to younger mothers. HPVs infect epithelial tissue and their life cycle is closely intertwined with the differentiation of the epithelium (41,42). they require the host DNA replication machinery in order to replicate its genome. this maintains the keratinocytes in a proliferative state via the action of specific HPV proteins. studies on HPV seropositivity in young children indicate a relatively low prevalence of HPV antibodies (approximately 0\u201310%). the presence of such infections in infants and young children suggests that the virus may also be vertically and horizontally transmitted. the united states, canada, australia, and Austria have currently implemented routine vaccination of girls as well as boys (51\u201353). the recent WHO guidelines recommended the vaccination of girls aged 9\u201314 years as the primary target population, and the vaccination of additional target populations (females 15 years and older, and males) only if feasible, affordable and cost-effective (54). inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) in children are considered to be the main drivers of influenza transmission. but recent observational studies have shown conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of LAIV. in 2015/16, in the uk, Finland and canada, LAIV VE was shown to be protective against the drifted influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses. probiotics and viral infections in childhood Probiotics (e.g., Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and Saccharomyces) are live microorganisms, which confer beneficial health effects on the host. they are non-pathogenic in the normal host, resist processing and are able to survive in the human digestive tract. probiotics seem to be more evident when treatment is initiated early (48 h) and are strain- and dose-dependent. probiotics are not useful for treating bacterial diarrhoea (76), but the interventions and existing evidence are inconsistent. some imaging findings are highly suggestive of CNS viral infections in fetuses and neonates (82). the later the diagnosis of congenital infections is made, the more difficult it is to identify the agent. the later the diagnosis of congenital infections is made, the more difficult it is to identify the agent. axial T2-Weighted image through the basal ganglia - white arrows indicate the presence of residual bilateral thalamocaudate groove hemorrhages. this abnormal area (white arrow) is also evident with increased signal intensity on axial T1-Weighted image through the same level. infections of the CNS more often cause meningitis, characterised by a high fever, headaches, vomiting, photophobia and neck stiffness and encephalitis. other clinical manifestations are myelitis, characterised by weakness, bladder dysfunction, flaccid paralysis and reduced or absent reflexes. enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and mumps virus (MuV) are responsible for >90% of cases of aseptic meningitis a certain aetiological factor was detected in only 6 of these patients (4 cases with influenza, 1 case with enterovirus and 1 case with HHV-7), whereas 2 patients suffered from autoimmune encephalitis. all patients with suspected CNS infection should undergo lumbar puncture (LP) all patients with suspected viral encephalitis start treatment with acyclovir. if the PCR test is positive for HSVs or VZV, should continue treatment for at least 14\u201321 days (93) corticosteroids can also be used, although their role remains controversial. RSV is a common cause of wheezing that seems to dominate in the first year of an infant\u2019s life. RV is being detected as a causative agent for acute bronchiolitis and lower tract viral infections in older infants and children. it remains to be clarified whether it is the specific viral respiratory infection that plays the causative role in asthmatogenesis or whether viral-induced wheezing is just a marker of predisposed individuals for the subsequent development of asthma. the cause of death for the infants in the Agora\u2019s well has been the topic of much speculation over the past 70 years. the cause of death for the infants in the well has been the topic of much speculation over the past 70 years. the cruciate eminence of the occipital bone was the most common location for endocranial reactive bone in the infants. more than 30% of the occipital squamae in this collection exhibited clear pathological bone deposits. a paediatrician should commit to lifelong learning. continuing medical development (CMD) recognised as method of improving quality of paediatric care. it is a professional responsibility for all practicing paediatricians to maintain, develop and increase their knowledge, clinical skills and professional performance. by the end of 2015, 856,723 individuals in total had arrived in the country. the majority of individuals arriving in Greece came from Syria (approximately 60%), followed by Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Algeria (23). a high vaccination coverage is required for the protection of refugees and migrants compared to European-born individuals (24) children were vaccinated for 10 infectious vaccine-preventable diseases, out of which 5 were viral infections (26). the estimated coverage among children of appropriate age for each vaccine was 83%; diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis. MTCT of HBV occurs mostly during birth and more rarely in utero or post-natally. MTCT of HBV occurs at a rate of 5% and is the major cause of paediatric HCV infection. the prevention of MTCT of HBV can be achieved in 99% of cases. the universal screening for HCV has been shown to be more effective than risk factor-based screening in preventing MTCT of HCV. the approval of DAAs in pregnant women and children will open new horizons in the prevention of MTCT of HCV. more than 150 types of HPVs have been discovered to date. these are classified into either low- or high-risk according to their malignant potential. asymptomatic infections of the oral or tonsillar mucosa, as well as of the genital mucosa in children have been described. there are a lack of data on the persistence of HPV infections in children and their relation to the subsequent development of HPV-associated diseases. the routine vaccination of girls, aged 11\u201312 years, has been introduced in many countries to reduce the incidence of anogenital cancers. non-vaccinated children will continue to be affected by paediatric HPV-associated diseases. increasing vaccine coverage may reduce HPV prevalence not only for anogenital infections, but also oral infections. but vaccination programmes continue to face challenges, in part due to parental fears regarding vaccine safety. a recent systematic literature review did not find any evidence of decreased efficacy of LAIV when administered during two consecutive seasons (67). the findings suggest decreased serological response among the highly vaccinated group (68). the vaccination of healthy children has the potential to provide both direct protection to children, but also indirect protection to vulnerable groups in the general population. probiotics have been used for the management of children with acute viral diarrhoea as an adjunct to rehydration therapy. they reduce the duration of diarrhoea, ranging between 16.8 h and 30.0 h, as well as the risk of diarrhoea lasting for >4 days. infections of the central nervous system are a very common worldwide health problem in childhood with significant morbidity and mortality. in children, viruses are the most common cause of CNS infections, followed by bacteria, and less frequently by fungi and other causes. some imaging findings are highly suggestive of CNS viral infections in fetuses and neonates (82). combining prenatal ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may document the extent of tissue damage and therefore contribute to treatment and counselling. if maternal viral infection is suspected, combining prenatal ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may document the extent of tissue damage and therefore contribute to treatment and counselling. axial T2-Weighted image through the lateral ventricles reveals signal abnormality in the temporal lobes bilaterally (white arrows) on the 3-month follow-up, same to section b demonstrates persistent signal abnormality in the temporal lobes. viruses, such as EBV, CMV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and human herpes viruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and -7) can invade the brain and influence the neurological status of children. among 29 children with CNS infection admitted to the PICU during the past 5 years, 17 patients (59%) had a viral infection. all patients with suspected viral encephalitis should undergo lumbar puncture (LP) unless this is contraindicated due to raised intracranial pressure. an MRI performed within 48 h of admission is abnormal in approximately 90% of patients. an electroencephalogram is considered if seizures are suspected. Approximately 35% of survivors will suffer from some form of permanent disability (seizures, learning problems, motor deficits, developmental delay) with much a higher incidence, two thirds of patients, in HSV encephalitis cases. the role of allergy in its development is indeed very significant (97) iency, Th2-biased immunity, defective anti-inflammatory response, airway hyper responsiveness and reduced barrier function were associated with decreased wheezing rate. a recent randomised trial of 429 high-risk infants was associated with decreased recurrent wheezing rate when compared with the placebo group (105). RV, the most frequent cause of the common cold in children, can replicate in the lower respiratory tract and can cause exacerbations of asthma (97,103). infant mortality rates from natural causes in the ancient world were very high. up to 50% of neonates may have died early in the postnatal period. cranial bones provide evidence for pathologies and possible infectious causes of death. the perinatal period in ancient Athens was perilous, with considerable risk from viral and bacterial infections. the skeletons from this well provide a brief glimpse into the short lives and early deaths of the youngest Athenians. continuing medical education (CME) has been recognised as a method of improving the quality of paediatric care by several paediatric organisations and institutions. paediatric Virologists should have a leading role in CME in Paediatric Virology. the role should focus on academic excellence and state-of-the-art medical education of practicing paediatricians."}
