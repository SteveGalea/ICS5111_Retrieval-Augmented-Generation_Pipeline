{"summary": "pigs underwent a thorough clinical examination by a veterinarian. fecal samples were analyzed for parasites and Salmonellaspp. the animals were kept in separate areas with individual climate control systems. domestic hybrid pigs were obtained from a german farm for use in nonrecovery experiments. the health and PRRSV status of these animals was not further defined. in the herd of origin, sows were vaccinated against PRRS. 3 transplant recipients received 0.75 Gy whole-body irradiation and 7 Gy thymic irradiation in a cervicocranial field of 6 cm width and 12 cm length. other recipients received a porcine antiCD8 antibody (clone 76-2-11, ATCC HB-143, Manassas, VA) 1 wk before surgery. the herd of origin was consistently negative for PRRSV (EU and NA subtypes) but positive for porcine rotavirus, porcine parvovirus, Campylobacterspp., Clostridium perfringens type A, -hemolytic streptococci, and Candida albicans. pigs of the colony had never been vaccinated against PRRSV. serum samples taken before surgery were stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until further processing. serology, PCR analysis, and sequencing were performed by IVD GmbH (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Innovative Veterin\u00e4rdiagnostik, Hannover, Germany). methylprednisolone was applied for routine antibiotic treatment (2 mg/kg daily) tobramycin (3mg/mL, B Braun, Melsungen, Germany) and cefuroxime sodium (Cefuroxim 1500 mg, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) were used for treatment of suspected infection with bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin. bronchoscopy revealed severe pulmonary hemorrhage, and the pig was therefore euthanized on day 14. radiographs for both pigs show increased density in the left lung. the second pig transplanted (no. 103605) showed severe dyspnea on day 20. pig no. 103339 showed moderate dyspnea and inappetence on day 23. bronchoscopy showed pulmonary hemorrhage and thickened pleura. radiographs indicated rejection of transplanted lung. the recipient lung demonstrates interstitial pneumonia, alveolar edema, and enlarged alveolar macrophages. the transplanted lung displays signs of severe chronic transplant rejection, with severe necrosis and a mixed cellular perivascular, interstitial, and air space infiltrate. bacteria were found sporadically on the surface of the mucus. PCR analysis of lung tissue yielded negative results for mycoplasma hyorhinis, porcine respiratory coronavirus, M. hyopneumoniae, influenza A virus and porcine circovirus 2. pig no. 103314 showed unequivocal signs of rejection of the left lung. severe tissue necrosis and a mixed cellular perivascular, interstitial, and alveolar infiltrate were observed. pig no. 103314 showed unequivocal signs of rejection of the left lung. 5 of the 6 pigs that were immunosuppressed by combining tacrolimus with either irradiation or antiCD8 antibodies became ill approximately 2 to 3 wk after the initial treatment. the remaining pig was euthanized because of rejection of the transplant. the likely source of infection was PRRSV-seropositive pigs of a conventional herd. the pigs were vaccinated with an attenuated live NA-subtype PRRSV vaccine. the vaccine strain is shed by the vaccinated animals for a limited time. the vaccine that was used in the conventional pigs in the current report is registered to be used in PRRSV-seropositive pigs only. the current case report shows that infection with a PRRSV field strain that was closely related to the vaccine strain used in the conventional pigs can induce severe interstitial pneumonia. the infected minipigs developed interstitial pneumonia. disease severity and progression were increased by the immunosuppressive treatment and PRRSV-seronegative status of the minipigs."}
