{"summary": "study recruited 22 patients under 15 years of age with cough lasting longer than 4 weeks (group 1), 7 controls with allergic rhinitis (group 2), and 10 controls without respiratory symptoms (group 3) a diagnosis of clinical bacterial sinusitis was made. the most common etiologies include asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and nonspecific cough. the diagnosis of asthma or cough variant asthma can be made on the basis of NAEPP EPR-3 criteria and response to a bronchodilator. prospective study was conducted between 2017 and 2018 with the approval of the institutional review board and human subject committee at LA Biomed/Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. informed consent was obtained from all patients. Nasal secretion assay Nasal discharge was obtained by swabbing with a wet cotton applicator 1 to 2 cm into the nasal antrum laterally and aiming at the middle meatus. the applicator tip was then smeared over a urine dip strip. strip was scored in 4 components: protein, nitrite, pH at 60 s, and leukocytes at 120 s. instrument detects 7 types of bacteria and the bacterial load, 1 fungus, 19 viruses, and 8 bacterial resistance genes. the bacterial primers were Haemophilus influenzae (HI), Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus ( skin testing Allergy skin tests were employed to identify patients with allergic rhinitis (group 2). the allergens included dust mites, cat, dog, molds, and pollens of grass, trees, and weeds specific to southern California. analysis of variance was used for categorical variables. patients with chronic cough (group 1) and allergic rhinitis (group 2) had additional procedures: nasal endoscopy and allergy skin testing. patients with chronic cough (group 1) and allergic rhinitis (group 2) had additional procedures: nasal endoscopy and allergy skin testing. on assay Nasal discharge was obtained by swabbing with a wet cotton applicator 1 to 2 cm into the nasal antrum laterally and aiming at the middle meatus. the applicator tip was then smeared over a urine dip strip. strip was scored in 4 components: protein, nitrite, pH at 60 s, and leukocytes at 120 s. the strip was scored in 4 components: protein, nitrite, pH at 60 s, and leukocytes at 120 s. a score above 3 was considered as an indicator of bacterial sinusitis. occus aureus (SA) was classified as potentially pathogenic viruses. a bacterium with abundance greater than 50% was considered to be a dominant species. the allergens included dust mites, cat, dog, molds, and pollens of grass, trees, and weeds specific to southern California. Statistical Analyses Means or medians and standard deviations or interquartile ranges were computed for continuous variables. n (%) 8 (80)b 2 (17) 2 (29) NA.004 Mean nasal secretion score (range) 5.4 (3\u20137)b 1.8 (1\u20135) 1.9 (0\u20135) 0.7 (0\u20131).0001 Positive allergy skin test/IgE, n (%) 5 (50) 11 (91) 7 (100) NA a P values are expected to be statistically significant since positive nasal endoscopy findings were used as selection criteria to diagnose bacterial sinusitis. a group 1A (cough with clinical bacterial sinusitis) demonstrated the presence of dominant bacteria in their nasal secretion samples by DNA techniques (P.0001). group 1A Among the 10 patients who met the clinical criteria for bacterial sinusitis, 8 patients (80%) demonstrated the presence of PPB in their nasal samples including SP, HI, and MC. six (60%) patients demonstrated the presence of PPV antigens and 4 (40%) had concomitant PPB and PPV. Group 1A: Cough w/ Bacterial Sinusitis (n = 10) Group 1B: Cough w/o Bacterial Sinusitis (n = 12) Group 2: Allergic Rhinitis (n = 7) Group 3: Asymptomatic (n = 10) P Subjects with PPB (% of total) 8 (80%)a 2 (17%) 1 (14%) 1 (10%).002 Subjects with NPPB (% of total) 5 (50%) group 1A (cough with clinical bacterial sinusitis) demonstrated the presence of dominant bacteria in their nasal secretion samples by DNA techniques (P.0001) Bacteria with abundance greater than 50% was considered to be a dominant species. group 2 Among 7 patients with allergic rhinitis, 1 patient had nondominant PPB. group 3 Among 10 asymptomatic controls, 1 patient had nondominant PPB. group 1B Twelve patients were classified into a nonbacterial cough group. allrgic sensitization was present in 5 out of 10 patients (50%) in group 1A and 11 out of 12 patients (91%) in group 1B. the pathology of subacute sinusitis may resemble acute sinusitis. chronic sinusitis may involve inflammatory processes in association with various microbes including SA. CP was characterized as pathogenic in some studies,26 it was reported to be part of natural microbiota of the nares and throat. DP has not been reported to cause sinusitis. SP, HI, and MC were classified as PPB. nonbacterial pathologies such as allergy, viral infection, or chronic irritation are doubtful due to their presence in control groups 2 and 3. the presence of PNPB in all groups is consistent with recent studies revealing asymptomatic cohorts also carry diverse commensal bacteria. further studies are indicated to replicate these findings. the author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}
