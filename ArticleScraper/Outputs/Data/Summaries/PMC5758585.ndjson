{"summary": "HCV affects 80 million people worldwide and in more than 80% of patients leads to chronicity. the high level of chronicity and the absence of a protective vaccine make HCV infection a significant public health problem. several HCV viral proteins have been described as modulators of immunological phenomena. in chronically infected patients, HCV core protein has been detected as non-enveloped isolated nucleocapsids. in serum, non-enveloped isolated nucleocapsids binding and internalization has also been described in vitro. a lack of host factors can hamper viral production by disrupting the core multimerization process. et al., 2003; Dominguez-Villar et al., 2007, 2012a; Fernandez-Ponce et al., 2014), characterized by an increased expression of Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) and CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4) it has been described for several viruses that the specific subcellular localization of viral proteins and their interactions with host molecules can alter the spatial distribution and organization of cellular proteins. cell cultures human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) Lenti-XTM 293T cell line (Clontech) and Jurkat cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (DMEMTM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes, 1% (v/v lentiviral production HEK Lenti-XTM 293T cells (Clontech) were used as packaging cell lines to produce lentiviral supernatant by co-transfecting plasmids pCMVDR8.91, coding for HIV-1 GAG and POL proteins. transfer vector pHRSincPPT-SEWHCV-core-GFP (HCV-core) coding for the first 191 amino acids of the HCV polyprotein (s jurkat cells were transduced using HCVcore-GFP and GFP (as control) lentiviral supernatants, previously prepared, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10.

IPA core analysis of our dataset (Figure 3) revealed specific immunolabeling of HCV core associated proteins. our findings support the concept that the subcellular localization of HCV core protein might have an impact on CD4+ T cells functions. the identified proteins were associated with splicing and processing of RNA, cell cycle progression, proliferation and apoptosis (B); infection by RNA viruses, replication of RNA viruses and apoptosis (C). Western blot analysis of (PP1) and (MYPT1) confirmed the presence of both proteins in PBMCs lysates obtained from the pull down of HCV Core protein coated magnetic beads. a bioinformatics tool was used to identify potential nucleolar localization sequences in HCV core protein. two noLSs were identified in human nucleolar localization sequences. a database of 46 statistically analyzed human nucleolar localization sequences. two noLSs were identified in HCV core protein (Figure 5). jurkat cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing HCVcore-GFP or GFP as a control. percentage of transduced cells analyzed by flow cytometry was >98% in all cases. jurkat cells transduced with GFP or HCV core GFP- expressing lentiviral construct or left untransduced were subsequently immunostained with anti-GFP antibody and a 10 nm gold-labeled anti-rabbit I micrographs (D) (x20000), (E) (x12000) and (F) (x30000) show a magnification of the gold labeled HCV core-GFP expressing Jurkat cell. gold particles labeling GFP core protein (arrows) in the nucleus, with enrichment and a clustering distribution in the nucleoli. 222 associated proteins were previously described to localize in the nucleus and 43 in the nucleolus. most of the 150 proteins described in the cytoplasm have also been identified in the nucleus and/or nucleolus. the identified proteins were associated with splicing and processing of RNA (A); cell cycle progression, proliferation and apoptosis (B); infection by RNA viruses, replication of RNA viruses. proteins are localized in the nucleus (orange), nucleolus (violet), cytoplasm (blue), and plasma membrane (yellow), according to String 10 Go Cellular component.

HBV core protein usually co-localizes with nucleolar proteins, nucleolin and B23. trafficking to the nucleolus and nucleolar residency time of HCV core protein in CD4+ T cells could be narrowly related with previous findings. the identified molecular recognition features mediate HCV core protein binding to HCV RNA and to multiple host proteins. a wide range of these proteins are involved in several biological signaling pathways, such as, RNA processing and splicing (Figure 3A), cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, apoptosis (Figure 3B) and infection and replication of RNA viruses. associations of HCV core protein in T cells could alter the function of the associated proteins, explaining some of the effects shown for HCV-core expression. DHX9 is involved in virus replication, innate immunity response to viral dsRNA and participation in the expression of IFN-stimulated genes. phenotype described by us and others in CD4+ T cells expressing HCV core protein. some associations are with serine/threonine-protein phosphatase catalytic subunit (PP1), protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A (MYPT1) (Nie et al., 2013), interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3) (Shi et al., 2007a,b), complement component C1Q conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
