{"summary": "the incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is unknown and the outcomes undefined in china. 125 hospitals were included and 412 patients were identified through the hospital information systems. the pathogenesis of ADEM is not fully known, but adhesion molecules, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinase, and other cell factors can play important roles in its occurrence and development. the disease most often follows a nondescript viral or even bacterial infectious illness. study population ADEM cases were selected from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2011. surveyed areas were Nanjing, Nantong, Yancheng and Xuzhou. both urban and rural populations were involved in each city. population Nanjing 117 29,116,289 0.40 1.49 1.12\u20132.00 Nantong 104 30,610,147 0.34 1.16 0.86\u20131.57 Yancheng 81 32,288,440 0.25 0.82 0.60\u20131.14 Xuzhou 109 38,204,947 0.29 1.00. ADEM cases were confirmed by neurologists from clinical data. clinical presentation must be polysymptomatic and must include encephalopathy. event should be followed by improvement, either clinically, on MRI, or both. no other etiologies can explain the event. the four cities are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. Table 1. Age-, sex- and place-related variations in ADEM incidence. Figure 1. Geographical location of Jiangsu province in china (1 = Jiangsu) clinical manifestations, electroencephalograph (EEG), computed tomography (CT), MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations. no history of a clinical episode with features of a prior demyelinating event. no other etiologies can explain the event. 125 hospitals and 4,652,355 records in the four cities were surveyed. from these records, 471 ADEM cases were found in the study population. the incidence was 0.32 cases per 100,000 person-years. sex-specific acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) incidence in Nanjing, Nantong, Xuzhou and Yancheng, china. the highest risk of acquiring ADEM for males was in February and for females, in April and November. age- and sex-specific acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) incidence in males was 0.34/100,000/year. the sex differential did not prove statistically significant. there is a sharper age-specific incidence curve in males than in females. incidence rates in four cities within Jiangsu province were 0.32/100,000/year. this is much higher than that in germans between 1997 and 1999. this is much higher than that in germans between 1997 and 1999. some studies have reported no gender predominance in children. males had an insignificantly higher risk of ADEM; male/female ratio was 1.17. a male-to-female incidence ratio changes with advanced age may suggest differential referral, detection, or access to a neurologist. influenza, rubella, measles, mumps, herpes, varicella, simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis viruses, legionella, mycoplasma, Campylobacter, streptococcus, and rickettsia have been implicated in ADEM. the lack of obvious seasonal variation in incidence may be because the infections found most frequently to trigger this disease occur in different seasons around the globe. s carry out studies for a longer period of time to ensure the discovery of a long-term trend in the incidence rate of ADEM. s carry out studies for a longer period of time to ensure the discovery of a long-term trend in the incidence rate of ADEM."}
