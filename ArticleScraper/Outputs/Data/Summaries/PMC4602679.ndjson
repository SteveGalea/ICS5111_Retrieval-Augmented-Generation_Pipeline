{"summary": "ARI causes approximately 1.8 million fatal cases of pneumonia per year among children 5 years of age. most URTIs are caused by viruses, including influenza virus A or B (IFVA/B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (RV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and others. ARI was determined based on syndromes of cough, rhinorrhea, and/or dyspnea, and/or fever of >37.5\u00b0C. for recruited patients, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) samples were collected on hospital admission after obtaining informed consent. all samples were screened by RT-PCR or PCR for common respiratory viruses. IFVA, IFVB, RSV (A and B subtypes), PIV (types 1, 2, 3, and 4), RV, CoV (229E and OC43), human metapneumovirus (MPV), adenovirus (AdV) and bocavirus (BoV) using standard methods. nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) samples were collected on hospital admission after obtaining informed consent. nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) samples were collected on hospital admission. the complementary DNA sample was synthesized by using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kits (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) the complementary DNA sample was synthesized by using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) adjusting for age and sex. 3181 (77.0%) of the 4130 eligible patients were enrolled in our study. Detection of viruses was more common among children aged 4 compared with those >4 years of age. IFVA (14.9%), and BoV (12.3%) were more frequently detected among the 2375 cases with virus detections. S pneumoniae (14.4%) was the most frequently detected bacteria among the 603 bacteria detections. SV (35.4%) and PIV (25%) more frequently codetected. for virus codetection, RSV, PIV, INFA, BoV, and RV were more frequently codetected with each other. for virus codetection, RSV, PIV, INFA, BoV, and RV were more frequently codetected with each other, especially, RSV and PIV. compared by age groups, most of the differences were significant among younger age groups. there were significant difference for fever, cough mean age (P 0.05), and diarrhea (P 0.1). Those cases detected with 2 bacteria had highest proportion of fever. 82.8% to 95.3% had pneumonia, 8.6% to 28.8% had severe pneumonia based on the definition mentioned above. cases detected with CoV and K pneumoniae had higher rate of pneumonia among all pathogens detections. IFVB and K pneumoniae-detected cases had a higher risk (4.7% and 3.2%) of being transferred to the ICU. there were 2375 cases detected with 1 virus and 707 (22.2%) detected with 1 bacteria. 901 (28.3%) children detected with 2 viruses; 57 (1.8%) detected with 2 bacteria. Detection of viruses was more common among children aged 4 compared with those >4 years of age, especially, highest (76.7%) among those aged 1 to 4 years. all the four types of bacteria-detected cases had high percentage of codetections with virus. the samples detected with viruses have low proportion of codetection with bacteria. 76.7% of those with bacteria detections were codetected with virus. for virus and bacteria codetection, we found that S pneumoniae and H parainfluenzae were more frequently codetected with each other, especially, RSV and PIV. for virus codetection, we found that S pneumoniae and H parainfluenzae were more frequently codetected with each other, especially, RSV and PIV. the clinical characteristics were quite different among different viruses. there were significant difference for fever, cough mean age (P 0.05) and diarrhea (P 0.1). cases with 2 viruses or both virus and bacteria had a higher proportion presenting with diarrhea. the mean age was higher among cases with >2 bacteria. pneumoniae had higher rate (95.3% and 94.6%) of pneumonia among all pathogens detections. those with detections of AdV and K pneumoniae had higher risk of severe pneumonia than others. IFVB and K pneumoniae-detected cases had a higher risk (4.7% and 3.2%) of being transferred to the ICU. the overall positive detection for any respiratory virus was 74.7%, and 22.2% for bacteria, with S pneumoniae most commonly detected in bacteria. previous literature has reported the interaction between these common bacteria and suggested the mechanism like synergism or competition. codetection may not always result in interactions for all virus species. but virus\u2013virus interaction is quite common and have 3 potential categories. the pathogens more frequently involving mixed detection of both virus and bacteria were S pneumoniae, RSV, PIV, IFVA, BoV, and RV. males had higher detection and codetection rate of virus and bacteria than females. fever and cough were 2 main significant predictors for virus codetection. fever alone was a significant predictor for bacteria codetection. fever, cough, and sputum were significantly more frequent in virus and bacteria codetected cases than monodetected. the presence of pathogens tested by molecular techniques or conventional culture may not confirm significant pathogenic role at that time. etiologic diagnostic tool for respiratory microbial infection can reduce overuse of antibiotic in primary care. there are some limitations of this study."}
