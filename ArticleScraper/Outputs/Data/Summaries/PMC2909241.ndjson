{"summary": "inverse folding algorithm Inv can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures. RNAinverse, RNA-SSD and INFO-RNA are limited to RNA secondary structures. pseudoknot structures are being observed in the mimicry of tRNA structures in plant virus RNAs. basic mechanisms, like ribosomal frame shifting, involve pseudoknots. pseudoknots are excluded from large-scale computational studies. mfe-structure is based on a specific concept of pseudoknot loops and respective loop-based energy parameters. k-noncrossing, -canonical RNA pseudoknot structures. secondary structures are coarse grained RNA contact structures. noncrossing diagrams exhibit no crossings at all, therefore RNA secondary structures coincide with 2-noncrossing diagrams having minimum arc-length two. in a diagram, two arcs (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) are called crossing if i1 i2 j1 j2 holds. a k-crossing is a sequence of arcs (i1, j1),..., (ik, jk) such that i a k-noncrossing RNA structure of length n is k-noncrossing diagram over [n] without arcs of the form (i, i + 1). the notion k-noncrossing stipulates that the complexity of a pseudoknot is related to the maximal number of mutually crossing bonds. neutral networks are typically connected in sequence space. the term \"neutral network\" stems from giant component results of random induced subgraphs of n-cubes. the neutral network of this fixed structure consists of all sequences folding into it. a p-neighbor has either Hamming distance one (G-C G-U) or p-neighbor, y, a compatible neighbor. each base pair gives rise to five compatible neighbors (red) exactly one of which being in Hamming distance one (G-C C-G) k-noncrossing, -canonical RNA pseudoknot structures. secondary structures are coarse grained RNA contact structures. a k-crossing is a sequence of arcs (i1, j1) and (i2, j2). k-noncrossing RNA structures exhibit no crossings in their diagram representation. k-noncrossing RNA structures exhibit no crossings in their diagram representation. k-noncrossing RNA structures exhibit no crossings in their diagram representation. k-noncrossing stipulates that the complexity of a pseudoknot is related to the maximum number of mutually crossing bonds. most natural RNA pseudoknots are 3-noncrossing [30]. 1.2 Neutral networks. s' is a sequence derived via a point-mutation of s. the structure S motivates to consider a new adjacency relation within C[S]. a u-neighbor has Hamming distance one and differs exactly by a point mutation. a p-neighbor has either Hamming distance one (G-C G-U) or Hamming distance two (G-C C-G) we call a u- or a p-neighbor, y, a compatible neighbor. this gives rise to consider the compatible and neutral distance of the two sequences. RNAinverse is the first inverse-folding algorithm that derives sequences that realize given RNA secondary structures as mfe-configuration. RNAinverse is the first inverse-folding algorithm that derives sequences that realize given RNA secondary structures as mfe-configuration. in its initialization step, a random compatible sequence s is generated. RNA-SSD performs a stochastic local search, starting at the leaves, subsequently working its way up to the root. INFO-RNA uses an improved (relative to the local search routine used in RNAinverse) stochastic local search in order to find a sequence in the neutral network of T. mfe-structure based on specific loop-types of 3-noncrossing RNA structures. let be an arc contained in S (S-arc) and denote the set of S-arcs that cross by. an arc is called a minimal, -crossing, while is not minimal -crossing. theorem 1 Any 3-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structure has a unique loop-decomposition [19]. a motif is a 3-noncrossing structure, having only -maximal stacks of size exactly, i.e. no stacks nested in other stacks, see Figure 14. a skeleton, c(S) has no noncrossing arcs and its L-graph, L(S) is connected. the core of a structure, c(S), is obtained by collapsing its stacks into single arcs. a skeleton reflects all cross-serial interactions of a structure. cross is an ab initio folding algorithm that maps RNA sequences into 3-noncrossing, -canonical structures. it is guaranteed to search all 3-noncrossing, -canonical structures and derives some (not necessarily unique), loop-based mfe-configuration. the standard loop-types are hairpin-loop, interior-loop and multi-loop. the standard loop-types are hairpin-loop (top), interior-loop (middle) and multi-loop (bottom) these represent all loop-types that occur in RNA secondary structures. theorem 1 Any 3-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structure has a unique loop-decomposition [19]. a motif is a 3-noncrossing structure, having only -maximal stacks of size exactly, i.e. no stacks nested in other stacks, see Figure 14. c(S) has no noncrossing arcs and its L-graph, L(S) is connected. a skeleton reflects all cross-serial interactions of a structure. the algorithm generates 3-noncrossing RNA structure \"from top to bottom\" the routines SHADOW, SKELETONBRANCH and SATURATION are depicted. for illustration purposes we assume here = 1. only motifs with crossings give rise to nontrivial skeleton-trees. in Algorithm 7.2 we show how to adjust the start sequence using the routine ADJUST-SEQ. Lines 3 to 36 contain a For-loop, executed at most times. the subroutine executed in the loop-body consists of the following three steps. a structure is inconsistent if there exists at least one position paired with more than one base. this perturbation leads to a nucleotide establishing two base pairs. the dotted arc is perturbed by shifting its end-point. this perturbation leads to a nucleotide establishing two base pairs. p(T, w) w, set v = p(T, w, set v = p(T, w), we update randomly into the nucleotide, such that for each Ch(i-1) C(i-1), either p(Ch(i-1), w) = 0 or is not compatible with. the pair G-C retains the compatibility to (5, 9), but is incompatible to (5, 10). the sequence is not necessarily incompatible to all competitors. for example, consider a competitor Ch whose arcs are all contained T. the resulting sequence is not necessarily incompatible to all competitors. LOCAL-SEARCH constructs an optimal sequence for T via local solutions. Suppose T is decomposed as follows, where the Tw are the loops together with all arcs in the associated stems of the target. the start-point of Tw precedes that of Th. LOCAL-SEARCH: Given the sequence of intervals I1, I2,..., Im. the target decomposes into the loops T1, T2 and we have I1 = [3, 5], I2 = [3, 6], I3 = [2, 9], and I4 = [1, 10]. Algorithm 7.2 shows how to adjust the start sequence using the routine ADJUST-SEQ. lines 3 to 36 contain a For-loop, executed at most times. the subroutine executed in the loop-body consists of the following three steps. a structure is inconsistent if there exists at least one position paired with more than one base. this perturbation leads to a nucleotide establishing two base pairs. this perturbation leads to a nucleotide establishing two base pairs, which is impossible. ence mutations are always possible, suppose p is paired with q in T and p is paired with q1 in one competitor and q2 in another one. for a fixed nucleotide at p there are at least two scenarios, since a base can pair with at most two different bases. the resulting sequence is not necessarily incompatible to all competitors. for example, consider a competitor Ch whose arcs are all contained T. Suppose T is decomposed as follows, where the Tw are the loops together with all arcs in the associated stems of the target. the start-point of Tw precedes that of Th. in Figure 22 we display the linear order of the loops of the structure shown in Figure 13. the target decomposes into the loops T1, T2 and we have I1 = [3, 5], I2 = [3, 6], I3 = [2, 9], and I4 = [1, 10]. LOCAL-SEARCH: Given the sequence of intervals I1, I2,..., Im. the core of Inv is a stochastic local search routine. it is based on the fact that each 3-noncrossing RNA structure has a unique loop-decomposition. Inv generates \"optimal\" subsequences and eventually arrives at a global solution for T itself. in Figure 26 we show a nonplanar RNA pseudoknot structure and 3 sequences of its neutral network. the determining factor is the subroutine LOCAL-SEARCH. c(l) denotes the complexity of the Cross. for n = 35, 75 we choose a natural pseudoknot structure from the PKdatabase. we display the average inverse folding time based on sampling 200 sequences of the respective target. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. seq|[l, r] get sub-sequence 23. l start-point(Iw) 21. r end-point(Iw) 22. s' seq|[l, r] get sub-sequence 23. end for 25. 26. step 6: output 27. if seqmin = Cross(seq) then 28. return seq 29. else 30. print Failed! 31. seq [w] random nucleotide or pair, s.t. seq C[T] and seq C[Ch(i-1)] 28. end if 29. end for 30.
