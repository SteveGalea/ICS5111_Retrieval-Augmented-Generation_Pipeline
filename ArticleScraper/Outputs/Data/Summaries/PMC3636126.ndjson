{"summary": "the number of complete chloroplast genomes increases rapidly with the development of various genome sequencing projects. no comprehensive platform or tool has been developed for the comparative and phylogenetic analysis of complete chloroplast genomes. CGAP integrated genome collection, visualization, content comparison, phylogeny analysis and annotation functions together. many coding and non-coding sequences of chloroplast genomes have been used for the phylogeny analysis of plants. chloroplast genomes have been widely sequenced and used for the comparison and phylogeny analysis [5-7] bioinformatics tools become more critical for the analysis of complete chloroplast genomes. CGAP contains a built-in database and four web servers including visualization of genomes, comparison of genome features and genome annotation. implementation CGAP contains a built-in database and four web servers including visualization of genomes. complete and regional genome maps of Populus trichocarpa were shown in Figure 2. all functions used Perl modules (including BioPerl, PerlMagick, PostScriptSimple, PostScriptSimple, TestSimple and PerlXML) and OGDRAW to create high quality genome maps. each feature was annotated using its name. Figure 3 shows the comparison results of Medicago truncatula and Porphyra purpurea. internal annotations and lines between genome features indicated the same features between the genomes compared. content comparison results between Pinus thunbergii and Porphyra purpurea. phylogeny analysis is based on multiple sequence alignment. CGAP used a novel sequence feature called base-base correlation. genome annotation CGAP annotated new chloroplast genomes based on feature sequences of the chloroplast genomes collected in CGAP database and basic local alignment method. CGAP identified the potential elements of your genome according to the sequence similarities between the elements and the features in the database. CGAP also visualized the genome in high-quality circular map based on the annotations. complete and regional genome maps of Populus trichocarpa were shown in Figure 2. all functions used Perl modules (including BioPerl, PerlMagick, PostScriptSimple, TestSimple and PerlXML) and OGDRAW to create high quality genome maps. each genome map CGAP provided five types of figures for viewing and downloading. CGAP implemented two functions for the comparison of feature content, including one by one and one by more comparison. the internal annotations and lines between genome features indicated the same features between the genomes compared, and the external annotations indicated the different features. CGAP used a novel sequence feature called base-base correlation (BBC) to characterize the complete chloroplast genome. for each chloroplast genome CGAP extracted one feature vector, and then calculated the distance matrix of the feature vectors using one of the ten distance methods. CGAP annotated new chloroplast genomes based on feature sequences of the chloroplast genomes collected in CGAP database and basic local alignment method. each annotated entry for a segment sequence of your genome has 8 fields, including NormalizedFeatureName, Start, End, FeatureName or Location, LengthRatio, Identity, Score and Expectation. the meaning of each field was described in Table 1. CGAP was developed for the comparative analysis of complete chloroplast genomes. it integrated genome collection, visualization, content comparison, phylogeny analysis and annotation functions together. users can customize the comparative and phylogenetic analysis using their own unpublished genomes. this work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81102746, 81100077, 31201768), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (5113033, 6133033), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (2011M500014, 2012M510011), PUMC Youth Fund, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education."}
