{"summary": "bronchial epithelial cells infected with replication-defective Adenovirus 12-SV40 virus hybrid were cultured in the presence of pidotimod. a synthetic dipeptide able to stimulate the inflammatory and immune effector cells could activate bronchial epithelial cell functions involved in response to infections. blot analysis substantiated that the constitutive TLR-2 expression was significantly increased after exposure to all the stimuli. both TNF- and pidotimod were effective in inducing NF-kB protein expression in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation. if confirmed in vivo, these activities may clarify the mechanism of action of this molecule at airway level. the surface of the respiratory tract acts as a selective barrier, maintaining the integrity of tissue compartments and impeding entry of inhaled majority microbial pathogens, irritants and allergens. airway epithelial cells secrete endogenous danger signals, thereby activating dendritic cells and bridging innate and adaptive immunity. study was designed to evaluate whether pidotimod, a synthetic dipeptide active on both innate and adaptive immunity [20], could modulate airway epithelial cells functions involved in the response to respiratory infections. a defective (immature) inflammatory and/or immune response at airway epithelial level may also be involved [19]. Flow cytometry BEAS-2B cells were grown to 90% confluence in 12 well culture plate in the presence of pidotimod (10 and 100 g/ml), 10 ng/ml TNF- or 50 g/ml zymosan used alone or in association. the cells were washed, resuspended in PBS and immediately analyzed with cell Quest software. beAS-2B cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml TNF-, 50 g/ml zymosan or pidotimod (10, 100 g/ml), in the absence or presence of TNF- and zymosan. after the treatments the supernatant was collected and IL-8 levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 5 min on ice. the lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 5 min. cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were grown to 90% confluence. membranes were blotted for TLR-2 and p65 NF-kB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), total ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), GAPDH (Novus Biological, Inc, Segrate, Milan, Italy), Lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Segrate, Milan, Italy) Flow cytometry BEAS-2B cells were grown to 90% confluence in 12 well culture plate in the presence of pidotimod (10 and 100 g/ml), 10 ng/ml TNF- or 50 g/ml zymosan used alone or in association. for each analysis 2 106 cells were incubated with FITC-Conjugated mouse anti ICAM-1. BEAS-2B cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml TNF-, 50 g/ml zymosan or pidotimod (10, 100 g/ml), in the absence or presence of TNF- and zymosan. IL-8 levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. cells were treated with 100 g/ml pidotimod, TNF- or TNF- with pidotimod. lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 5 min on ice. cells were plated and cultured until 90% confluence. 400 mM NaCI, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. western blot analysis The protein concentration of the lysates was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. equal amounts of protein were resolved with 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE. similar results were obtained exposing BEAS-2B cells for 48 h. the cells were exposed to pidotimod (10, 100 g/ml), TNF- (10 ng/ml) or pre-treated with pidotimod. no changes in ICAM-1 expression were obtained exposing the cells to pidotimod. ICAM-1 expression is quantified as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on the ordinate. the data are expressed as mean SEM. *p 0.05 versus control. the results shown are representative of three independent experiments. flow cytometric analysis of TLR-2 expression on cells treated with TNF-, zymosan, pidotimod (Pid 10, 100 g/ml) plus TNF- (TNF- Pid or zymosan (Zym + Pid), for 24 h. the data are expressed as mean SEM.*p 0.05 versus control. the detectable IL-8 concentrations found in the supernatants of cell cultured in medium alone were significantly increased in cell culture exposed for 24 h to TNF- or zymosan. no further modifications in the TNF- or zymosan-induced increase in IL-8 release was observed with the addition of pidotimod to the cells exposed to TNF- or zymosan. densitometric analysis showed that the inhibitory effect was complete at 5, 30 and 60 min (Figure 5B). the densitometric analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, normalized to total ERK1/2, is shown on the ordinate and the different culture conditions on the abscissa. the densitometric analysis of NF-kB data, normalized to GAPDH (cytoplasm) or laminin A/C (nucleus), are shown on the ordinate and the different culture conditions on the abscissa. the results shown are representative of three independent experiments. no changes in ICAM-1 expression were obtained exposing the cells to pidotimod for 36 h or 48 h. no modifications in the TNF-induced increase in ICAM-1 expression were observed. Western blot and densitometric analysis showed that, at protein level, the effect was statistically significant also for TNF- (p 0.05), zymosan (p 0.01) and for the combinations zymosan with pidotimod (p 0.01). pre-incubation of the cells with pidotimod for 4, 12 or 24 h did not modify the results. IL-8 release BEAS-2B cells were exposed for 24 h to pidotimod (100 g/ml), TNF-, zymosan or TNF- and zymosan with pidotimod. no further modifications in the TNF- or zymosan-induced increase in IL-8 release was observed with the addition of pidotimod to the cells. IL-8 are expressed as mean SEM. **p 0.01 versus control. ERK1/2 pathway activation For ERK1/2 analysis, confluent BEAS-2B cells were exposed to pidotimod, TNF- or TNF- with pidotimod for 5 to 60 min. NF-kB expression and translocation BEAS-2B cells were treated with TNF-, 100 g/ml pidotimod or TNF- with pidotimod for 1h. similar results were obtained in the experiments performed with pidotimod 10 g/ml. we found that exposure of BEAS-2B cells to pidotimod had no effect on ICAM-1 expression and IL-8 release. a detectable upregulation of TLR-2 expression was observed by fluorescence microscopy, cytofluorimetry and western blot analysis. a synthetic dipeptide molecule with biological and immunological activity on both the adaptive and the adaptive immune responses. pidotimod did not increase constitutive or the TNF- induced ICAM-1 expression. a similar interpretation can be made for the results on IL-8 release. IL-8 is a powerful chemotactic and paracrine mediator for neutrophils. TLRs are a type of pattern recognition receptor and recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules. of the ten mammalian TLR proteins identified thus far, TLR-2 seems to be the least discriminating, since it recognizes many bacterial, fungal, viral, and certain endogenous substances. extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) or classical mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are widely expressed protein kinase intracellular signalling molecules that are engaged in the regulation of meiosis, mitosis, but also in several post mitotic functions. NF-kB plays a key role in regulating a quick immune response to infections because it belongs to the category of \u201crapid-acting\u201d primary transcription factors. pidotimod, a synthetic dipeptide used in the prevention of recurrent respiratory infection in children, is able to modulate airway epithelial cells functions involved in host-virus possibly through NF-kB activation. this activity may clarify the mechanism of action of this molecule at airway level. the authors have been involved in drafting the manuscript and revising it critically for important intellectual content. the authors read and approved the final manuscript, including the article-processing charge."}
