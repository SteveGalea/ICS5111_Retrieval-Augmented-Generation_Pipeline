{"summary": "astrocytes are the most abundant population of cells within the central nervous system (CNS) they form a functionally coupled network through a series of gap junctions and have pleiotropic roles in maintaining the blood\u2013brain barrier and controlling cerebral blood flow. astrocytes undergo a spectrum of molecular and functional changes termed reactive astrogliosis. glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells isolated by laser-capture microdissection from postmortem tissues of subjects with AD. senescent cells accumulate in tissues with age, including the brain, and at sites of aging-related pathology. treatment with sublethal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces senescence. our previous studies characterized this type of stress-induced senescence in human astrocytes as determined by changes in cell morphology (enlarged and flattened shape), cessation of division, increased senescence-associated -galactosidase activity (85% of positive cells compared to 5% of controls), increased expression of p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p16INK4a. senescent astrocytes acquire an inflammatory phenotype indicative of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and downregulate the expression of brain-expressed genes. senescent astrocytes could affect tissue dysfunction during aging and neurodegenerative disease via multiple mechanisms. RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from two replicate cDNA libraries per condition. a biological replicate is defined as an independent growth of cells and subsequent analysis. the two replicate cDNA libraries per condition were submitted to the Next Generation Sequencing Core (NGSC) all GO categories have a gene count of 10 or greater and a fold-enrichment of 2 or greater. all GO categories have a gene count of 10 or greater and a fold-enrichment of 2 or greater. expression level was greater than or less than 100 in both datasets. this criterion was expression level of greater than or less than 100 in both datasets. chromosomal coordinates of all promoter regions 1000 bp upstream of the transcription start site were obtained. RT-PCR was performed with Verso 1-Step RT-qPCR reagents. the absence of product in reactions without reverse transcriptase (no RT) was also verified. data were glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-normalized. astrocytes were treated with 10 M BrdU (5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine; BD Pharmingen; San Diego, CA, USA) in complete astrocyte medium for 30 min. cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS, and fixed with ice cold 70% ethanol. immunofluorescence Cells were seeded on coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5% normal donkey serum for 2 h at room temperature. coverslips were incubated with rabbit anti-phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10) diluted 1:500 in PBS 0.1% BSA overnight at room temperature protected from light. 104 cells/cm2) were treated with 200 M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 2 h. cells were considered senescent at least 5 days after treatment. senescent astrocytes were not significantly different than controls. GO analysis was performed on transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed in senescent astrocytes with a greater than 1.5-fold change and a p-value 0.05. all GO categories have a gene count of 10 or greater and a fold-enrichment of 2 or greater. weight of all genes in the GO term is inversely proportional to the total number of GO terms it appears in. \"Genes\" represents the genes constituting the GO term. GO analysis on the intersection of senescence and downregulated transcripts was done similarly. public motif databases Transfac and JASPAR were searched for motifs enriched in the promoter sequences. a de novo motif analysis was performed to find motifs with no correlate. results were filtered by human and mouse species-specificity. escence were grown in complete Astrocyte Medium (AM, ScienCell) as described. cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with ice cold 70% ethanol overnight at 4\u00b0C. fixed cells were centrifuged to remove ethanol, washed with PBS, and stained with Guava Cell Cycle reagent. anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (eBioscience; San Diego, CA, USA) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 was applied for 30 min at room temperature. cells were stained with Guava Cell Cycle solution as described previously. the percent of cells labeled with BrdU was quantified using FlowJo software v10. RNA-Seq Broad Picture of Differentially-Expressed (DE) Genes We sequenced two biological replicates each of pre-senescent astrocytes and astrocytes induced to senesce by oxidative stress. from these datasets, 97.5% of all reads mapped to the reference human genome were tightly clustered based on cellular treatment. a positive log2 fold change indicates transcripts that are upregulated in senescent cells. a negative log2 fold change represents transcripts significantly downregulated in pre-senescent astrocytes. the results demonstrate that there are significant changes to the astrocyte transcriptome during oxidative stress-induced senescence. several upregulated gene GO categories have known associations with senescence. inflammation, modification of the extracellular matrix and resistance to apoptosis are known senescence-associated changes. cellular adhesion (regulation of cell adhesion, regulation of cell motion, positive regulation of binding) and cytoskeleton (actin cytoskeleton organization) related genes were previously seen to be upregulated in in vitro senescence of human dermal fibroblasts. all GO terms overrepresented by senescence upregulated genes, color coded as in (C). GO categories formed by downregulated genes yielded a total of 13 motifs. those formed by upregulated genes yielded only 1 motif, that for p53. the expression levels of selected astrocyte-enriched genes GFAP, S100B, ALDH1L1, FGFR3, CNS enriched Synapse Differentiation Induced Gene 1 (SynDIG1) and a non-CNS enriched gene, KLF3 were validated by qRT-PCR. the expression of astrocyte and CNS enriched genes was lost or diminished in senescence. GFAP expression in pre-senescent astrocytes was greatly reduced in replicative senescence. the loss of astrocyte-enriched genes suggests loss of normal function in these cells upon undergoing oxidative stress-induced senescence. levels of senescence-related transcripts CCND1 (Cyclin D1), IL8, IGFBP5 and ICAM-1 were significantly increased. treatment with H2O2 to induce senescence robustly induces p21 expression in human diploid fibroblasts. d for 24 h arrested predominantly in G0/G1, while in senescent astrocyte cultures, we observed an increase in the fraction of cells with 4N DNA content. we observed an increase in the fraction of cells with 4N DNA content and a concomitant loss of cells in G0/G1 compared with pre-senescent controls cultured in complete growth medium. a multi-phase cell cycle arrest is also a feature of many cell types exposed to oxidative stress and DNA damage. we stained astrocytes for phosphorylated histone H3 (Ser10) in order to address the possibility that senescent cells with G2 DNA content are progressing to mitosis. principle component analysis (PCA) revealed the greatest variability in the RNA-Seq data was due to the treatment condition (PC = principle component) a positive log2 fold change indicates transcripts that are upregulated in senescent cells, while a negative log2 fold change represents transcripts significantly downregulated in pre-senescent astrocytes. GO enrichment analysis used a cut-off of 1.5-fold differential expression to define up- or downregulated genes. 1510 downregulated and 1258 upregulated transcripts satisfied this criterion with padj 0.05, (Supplementary Table S2) gene GO categories have known associations with senescence. senescence of human dermal fibroblasts suggests a mechanism by which astrocyte senescence may be causing further damage in the brain. the top overrepresented GO biological process classes in astrocyte down- and upregulated transcripts are shown in the pie chart. GO categories formed by downregulated genes yielded a total of 13 motifs. those formed by upregulated genes yielded only 1 motif, that for p53, formed by the genes in the \u2018extracellular structure organization\u2019 GO category. genes with differential expression in oxidative stress-induced astrocyte senescence are brain-expressed. expression levels of selected astrocyte-enriched genes GFAP, S100B, ALDH1L1, FGFR3, CNS enriched gene 1 and a non-CNS enriched gene, KLF3 were validated by qRT-PCR. the expression of astrocyte and CNS enriched genes was lost or diminished in senescent astrocytes. the levels of senescence-related transcripts CCND1 (Cyclin D1), IL8, IGFBP5 and ICAM-1 were significantly increased. treatment with H2O2 to induce senescence robustly induces p21 expression in human diploid fibroblasts. the expression of CDKN1A, which encodes for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, was not called as significantly differentially expressed. expression in senescent astrocytes was apparent (RNA-Seq, fold change = 5.84, padj = 0.11) p21 mRNA expression level in senescent astrocytes was almost fourfold increase in p21 mRNA in senescent astrocytes compared with pre-senescent controls. we compared our list of differentially expressed transcripts with cell-type specific markers of astrocytes. the loss of astrocyte-enriched genes suggests loss of normal function in these cells upon undergoing oxidative stress-induced senescence. each symbol represents a single transcript, n = 17, Pearson r = 0.809, p 0.001 95% CI 0.659 to 0.939. the expression of CDKN1A encoded for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was not called as significantly differentially expressed in our dataset. a trend toward increased expression in senescent astrocytes was apparent (RNA-Seq, fold change = 5.84, padj = 0.11) p 0.02, p 0.001 vs. pre-senescent in growth medium using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc testing. senescent astrocytes stained for DNA content and BrdU incorporation. senescent and senescent astrocyte cultures showed few phospho-H3-positive cells. compared with pre-senescent controls, astrocytes exhibited few phospho-H3-positive cells. this is the first report of senescence-associated gene expression changes in a CNS-derived cell type. oxidative stress-induced astrocyte senescence is accompanied by a loss of brain-expressed transcripts involved in neuronal and glial differentiation and development, axonogenesis, and axon guidance. the loss of differentiated function upon senescence is also a feature of human ocular keratocytes. reactive astrogliosis is more heterogeneous than was once thought. astrocyte senescence shares some features of reactive astrogliosis. downregulation of certain markers of astrogliosis helps limit damaging effects of gliosis. senescence induced by oxidative stress in astrocytes downregulates expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation on MHC class II proteins. these results are in concordance with a recent RNA-Seq dataset from rat cerebral cortex. mRNA levels of MHC class II genes are upregulated in astrocytes isolated from aged mouse cortex. activation of p38MAPK has been shown to negatively regulate CIITA. this suggests a possible convergence between the senescence program and dysregulation of immune function during aging or immunosenescence. there are parallels between gene expression changes in astrocytes with AD and senescence RNA-Seq data. genes involved in generation and differentiation of neural cell types were commonly down-regulated in astrocytes in oxidative stress induced senescence and in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. teneurin transmembrane protein 4 encodes for the teneurin-4 transmembrane protein. teneurin transmembrane protein 4 encodes for the teneurin-4 transmembrane protein. this gene was responsible for tremors in mice and caused defects in myelination of small diameter axons. the cause was shown to be inhibited oligodendrocyte differentiation, growth and process formation, due to defective FAK signaling by Ten-4. the number of downregulated genes was slightly higher for astrocyte senescence. there were significantly more genes regulated in the same direction by senescence in both cell types than would be expected by chance. this suggests cell-type specific responses to oxidative stress induced senescence. /analysis tools BG, GD, SG, YL, EY, JC, RN, L-SW, CS, NB, SB, FJ, and CT.
