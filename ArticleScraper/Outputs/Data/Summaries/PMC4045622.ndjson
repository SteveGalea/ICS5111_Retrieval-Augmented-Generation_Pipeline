{"summary": "patients presented with fever, lower respiratory tract symptoms, and infiltrates on chest radiography consistent with pneumonia or ARDS. the index case was a physician from Guandong province who had traveled to Hong Kong 5 days after symptom onset. the illness rapidly spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. the estimated case fatality rate was 13.2% (9.8 to 16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3% (35.2 to 52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric gamma distribution. there has been speculation that the severity of infection in older individuals is related to oxidative-stress machinery. a case control series from the university of Toronto described postmortem studies of pathology specimens from 20 patients who died between March and July 2003 with SARS confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. the authors compared these patients to 22 age- and gender-matched SARS CoV\u2013negative patients who presented with lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms. the authors reported significant overlap between SARS and non-SARS cases of patients who died with ARDS. ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN were inconclusive. in 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and 4 were classified as causing possible harm. there have been no cases of SARS reported since 2004. ACE2 is expressed in the alveolar epithelium in both type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells and in the vascular endothelium of the lung in humans. ACE2 plays a central role in the nonclassical renin angiotensin system (RAS) increased signaling through ACE and downstream cytokines may be important for lung injury. ACE converts angiotensin I (AT) to angiotensin II (AT II) ACE2 inactivates AT II, generating angiotensin 1\u20137 (AT 1\u20137). ACE knockout is protective against lung injury in a gene dose-dependent fashion. the heterozygote shows an intermediate reduction of lung compliance after acid-induced lung injury compared with the wild-type and ACE knockout. recombinant human ACE2 treatment in piglets with LPS-induced ARDS. the animals were intubated, mechanically ventilated, and had pulmonary artery catheters placed prior to LPS-induced lung injury. authors addressed the concern of lowering systemic blood pressure with agents that inhibit the RAS by cleaving AT II. animals with LPS-induced lung injury were found to have an eightfold elevation in AT II. treatment with ACE2 did not result in AT II levels below basal levels. cytokine profiles reflect downstream signaling effects of disruption of ACE and ACE2 balance. the rate of grade 2 pneumonitis was significantly lower in patients taking ACE inhibitors (2%) than in nonusers (11%). the patients who self-reported ACE inhibitor use were similar to those who did not use this class of medication with respect to types and stages of cancer. othelial and epithelial processes to the development of lung injury are under investigation. pathways involved in lung injury induced by SARS CoV infection may be common to other mechanisms of injury, including LPS, acid aspiration, and cecal ligation and perforation. nearly every country had reported laboratory-confirmed cases. most common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (92%), sore throat (66%); 25% of patients had diarrhea, and 25% had vomiting. ARDS, bilateral patchy pneumonia, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase levels, and leukopenia were common to cohorts of adults and children studied worldwide. pregnant women and obese individuals are more susceptible to severe infection from pandemic H1N1. study did find elevated levels of surfactant protein D (SP-D) and von Willebrand factor (vWF), markers for endothelial injury, in obese patients with ALI. study did not specifically investigate the role of the endothelial compartment in murine ALI. early use of corticosteroids in SARS and H3N2 influenza was associated with prolonged periods of viral replication and may have increased the rate of secondary bacterial VAP. recommendations for respiratory support of patients with ARDS or ALI from H1N1 are similar to the widely accepted use of lung-protective ventilation with lower tidal volume. othelial injury is not well understood, and experimental models do not always distinguish between direct cytotoxic effects of alveolar epithelial cell infection and host inflammatory responses that arise from endothelial injury. a small minority of patients infected with pandemic H1N1 go on to develop serious illness necessitating hospitalization or intensive care. with ARDS and 11 with mild disease, showed that severe influenza A (H1N1) virus infection was characterized by IL-6, IL-15, IL-8, and TNF-. these cytokines, except TNF-, had a positive correlation with the admission delay and C-reactive protein. Interestingly, obese patients with pandemic H1N1 infection have significantly higher levels of IL-8 than infected nonobese patients. the clinical response to influenza infection ranges from mild disease to severe pneumonia. it remains unclear whether the inflammatory response to infection is protective or pathogenic. experimental animal models should be extrapolated to human disease with caution. mouse models have generated the bulk of available data on H1N1 infection. IL-17RA knockout mice recruited fewer neutrophils to the airway in response to challenge with either influenza A virus or hydrochloric acid. IL-17 is secreted by many cells, including Th17 cells, gamma delta T cells, and natural killer (NK cells) it acts as a proinflammatory cytokine and links the innate and adaptive immune system by recruiting neutrophils. it links the innate and adaptive immune system by recruiting neutrophils. virus strain BJx109 (H3N2) causes mild disease while virus strain PR8 (H1N1) causes severe disease. the disease severity of PR8 infection in macrophage-depleted mice is similar to untreated mice. findings suggest internalization and nonproductive infection could be a critical factor in limiting severe disease caused by influenza infection in mice. significantly higher levels of IL-1, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1, and MIP-2 were detected in pregnant mice infected with wild-type virus (P 0.03) levels of IL-6, MIP-1, and MIP-2 were elevated significantly in pregnant mice infected by mutant virus (P 0.02) NETs incubated with influenza-primed alveolar epithelial cells formed NETs. this interaction between NETs and the endothelium could explain how epithelial and endothelial damage are related in the development of ARDS in response to H1N1 infection. cytokines Il-6, IL-8, TNF-, and interferon gamma-induced protein-10 were reduced by inhibiting pre\u2013B cell colony enhancing factor. in mice, an S1P receptor antagonist suppresses chemokine and cytokine production, including IFN-, CCL2, EL-6, TNF-, and IFN- after influenza infection. mice were injected with MS ODN named SAT05f. this treatment improved survival, less histopathological changes with fewer neutrophils per high-power field, and reduced levels of TNF- in lung homogenates. future strategies will need to focus on mechanisms that might enhance repair. IL-17 is secreted by many cells, including Th17 cells, gamma delta T cells, and natural killer (NK cells) it acts as a proinflammatory cytokine and links the innate and adaptive immune system by recruiting neutrophils. it links the innate and adaptive immune system by recruiting neutrophils. es is abortive and viral progeny are not released. despite similar abilities to infect urine epithelial cells, virus strain BJx109 (H3N2) causes mild disease while virus strain PR8 (H1N1) causes severe disease. ant BALB/c mice have a higher mortality, more severe pneumonitis, higher pulmonary viral load, lower peripheral blood T lymphocytes and antibody responses. significantly higher levels of IL-1, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1, and MIP-2 were detected in pregnant mice infected with wild-type virus (P 0.03) newtrophil-depleted mice showed only mild lung pathology after H1N1 infection. NETs were also present in normal mice treated with lethal doses of H1N1. endothelial cells show viral tropism for the apical surface and high infectivity. similar studies of H1N1 infection of monolayer cell culture models showed increased expression of inflammatory cytokines Il-6, IL-8, TNF-, and interferon gamma-induced protein-10. this expression was reduced by inhibiting pre\u2013B cell colony enhancing factor. fang et al explored a microsatellite DNA mimicking oligodeoxynucleotides. mice were injected with MS ODN named SAT05f. this treatment improved survival, less histopathological changes with fewer neutrophils per high-power field, and reduced levels of TNF- in lung homogenates. lung repair strategies may provide treatments for all virally mediated lung injury and ALI sustained from a variety of other insults. the looming threat of the next outbreak of a pandemic respiratory viral infection makes a compelling argument for the continuation of investigations into the host immune response to viral infection in the lung."}
