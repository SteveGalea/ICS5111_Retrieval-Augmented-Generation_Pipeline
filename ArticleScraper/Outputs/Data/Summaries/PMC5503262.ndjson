{"summary": "the first biological ZIKV sample was isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947. it was later found ZIKV is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. since 2007, large epidemics of Asian genotype ZIKV have been reported around the world. several studies focused on the possibility of developing neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV [18\u201320], it may take quite a while before such neutralizing antibodies for ZIKV enter clinical trials. the correct processing of the polyprotein is essential for replication of all flaviviruses, which requires both host proteases and a viral NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) binding to a pocket on the back of the active site and allosterically affect the structure-activity property of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. corresponding Zika sequences were identified for the NS2B (S1A Fig) and NS3pro (S1B Fig) of the Asian Zika strain 8375 (GenBank ID: KU501217.1) the linked complexes without His-tag were successfully obtained by cleavage with thrombin covalently linked to beads. however, the linked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes purified directly from supernatant were indistinguishable as judged from both enzymatic activity and biophysical characterization. NS3pro domain also needs NS2B to fold correctly, as previously observed on all other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro [21,30,31]. however, the mixture was easily refolded into the soluble complex (column 2 of S1D Fig), was subjected to further cleavage of His-tag and the final FPLC purification (column 3 of S1D Fig). linked NS2B-NS3pro complexes had sharper 1D up-field peaks and a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum. the unlinked complex had sharper 1D up-field peaks (Fig 1A) and a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum (Fig 1B). far-UV CD spectra of linked (blue) and unlinked (red) Zika NS2B-NS3pro, as well as NS2B (48\u201374)-NS3pro (green) complexes at a protein concentration of 10 M. we further characterized Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes with one being labeled and the other unlabeled. both linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes have far-UV CD spectra with the maximum negative signal at the wavelength of 201 nm and large positive signal at 192 nm. both linked and unlinked NS2B-NS3pro complexes have similar spectra with the emission maxima ranging from 344 to 348 nm. organic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and glycerol were introduced into the activity assay buffers. the results indicate that DMSO induced significant changes in the intrinsic UV fluorescence spectra of ZIKV's NS2B-NS3pro. 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled NS2B alone (blue) and 15N-labeled NS2B in complex with unlabeled NS3pro (red) superimposing the HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled NS2B against its complex form with unlabeled NS3pro revealed that C-terminal residues Arg73-Lys100 were the detectable HSQC peaks of NS unlabeled BPTI converts open conformation of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes to the closed form by both NMR [31] and crystallography [40]. HSQC peaks of Arg73-Ser85 disappeared and only very weak HSQC peaks of Leu86-Lys100 were detectable. apo DENV NS2B-NS3pro complex showed the C-terminal loop of NS2B adopts a defined conformation despite some discontinuous electron densities beyond residue 76 [27]. the Zika NS2B region corresponding to the Dengue NS2B Glu91-Thr96 shows no sequence homology at all (S3 Fig), thus leading to the high dynamics of Zika NS2B. NS2B deleted contains less disordered region than linked and unlinked complexes. despite being less disordered, this complex showed no detectable enzymatic activity even with the protease concentration up to 20 M. previously, we generated a truncated Dengue NS2B with the same C-half deleted but the shorter NS2B is unable to form a soluble complex with its NS3pro. enzymatic catalysis We have extensively characterized the catalytic properties of linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes in different buffer conditions. these substrates were extensively used for characterization of other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes. linked and unlinked complexes showed similar dependence on pH values. similar to other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro linked by (Gly4)-Ser-(Gly4) [23\u201326], different from Dengue-2 NS2B-NS3pro. catalytic activity of Zika NS2B-NS3pro also reduced significantly upon increasing the concentrations of NaCl. the kcat values are almost identical, but the Km value is 2.4-fold less than our current one. this small difference is likely due to: 1) the difference of substrate as Bz-nKKR-AMC was used in the study [34]; or/and 2) the slight differences of NS2B and NS3pro lengths. mM Tris buffer at pH 8.5 + 20% Glycerol + 1% DMSO was used as the screening buffer as it could dissolve all natural products in the present study. we have identified six compounds to have significant inhibitory effects, which belong to flavonoid and natural phenol. Isorhamnetin, also called 3\u2019-Methylquercetin, has a much weaker inhibitory activity (IC50 of 15.46 M and Ki of 6.22 M) than Quercetin. by contrast, Quercetin and Luteolin have almost the same inhibitory activity (Table 2). the red circles are used to indicate that the inhibition is non-competitive, characteristic of the same Km but varying Vmax values. this indicates that these compounds inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in a non-competitive mode. previously Myricetin and Quercetin have been characterized to allosterically inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro. complexes between Zika NS2B-NS3pro and six active compounds bind to the pockets on the back of the active site of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. the pocket for binding six compounds is constituted by the surfaces provided by both Zika NS2B and NS3pro. Zika NS2B-NS3pro determined with an active site inhibitor cn-716. green, red and yellow are used respectively to color loop, helix and -strand of NS3pro domain. brown, cyan and purple are respectively for loop, helix and -strand of NS2B. the Zika pocket is more polar and negatively charged, while the Dengue-2 pocket is less polar and positively charged. we further analyzed the hydrogen bond networks formed between Zika NS2B-NS3pro and six compounds. hydrogen bond between proton of 3\u2019-hydroxyl group and backbone oxygen of Lys73 is lost. this hydrogen bond appears to contribute to the inhibitory activity as the inhibitory constant Ki of Isorhamnetin increases by 6 times as compared to Quercetin. this hydrogen bond appears to be critical for its inhibitory activity as Apigenin has a Ki increased by 25 times as compared to Luteolin. curcumin and Isorhamnetin have the same 3\u2019-methoxy and 4\u2019-hydroxyl groups on the phenyl rings. a high affinity, which is achieved by establishing bivalent or multivalent binding sites, has been extensively found. a high affinity, such as on bivalent thrombin-inhibitor interactions, has been extensively found. a portion of recombinant protein was found to be in supernatant with induction of 0.2 mM IPTG overnight at 18\u00b0C. we purified the linked NS2B-NS3pro by Ni2+-affinity column under denaturing condition for NS3pro and under native condition for NS2B. all NS3pro protein precipitated during dialysis and no enzymatic activity could be detected, suggesting that Zika NS3pro domain also needs NS2B to fold correctly. however, using the same protocol, the mixture of NS2B and NS3pro was easily refolded into the soluble complex (column 2 of S1D Fig) linkage significantly facilitated crystallization of linked NS2B-NS3pro complexes. this linkage significantly broadened NMR signals of linked NS2B-NS3pro complexes. linked NS2B-NS3pro had sharper 1D up-field peaks and a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum. NS2B-NS3pro, NS3pro-Trp50, NS3pro-Trp69, NS3pro-Trp83 and NS3pro-Trp89 side chains only observed for the unlinked complex. far-UV CD spectra of linked (blue) and unlinked (red) Zika NS2B-NS3pro, as well as NS2B (48\u201374)-NS3pro (green) complexes at V NS3pro had a narrowly-dispersed HSQC spectrum with only 29 peaks detectable (S2B Fig) dengue NS2B in complex with dengue NS3pro domain has a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum. the rest of NS2B is highly disordered and lacks tight tertiary packing, which results in a narrowly-dispersed HSQC spectrum. the isolated Zika NS2B (48\u2013100) was soluble in buffers. we introduced organic solvents such as DMSO and glycerol into the activity assay buffers. the results indicate that DMSO induced significant changes in the intrinsic UV fluorescence spectra. 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled NS2B alone (blue) and 15N-labeled NS2B in complex with unlabeled NS3pro (red) the green is used to highlight two residues Gly57 and Gly69, which could only be detected in the HSQC spectrum of NS2B in the free state. HSQC peaks of NS2B in complexed form disappeared. HSQC peaks of Arg73-Ser85 disappeared. only very weak HSQC peaks of leu86-Lys100 were detectable. apo deNV NS2B-NS3pro complex showed the C-terminal loop of NS2B adopts a defined conformation despite some discontinuous electron densities beyond residue 76 [27]. despite its low expression level and insolubility, we cloned and expressed a His-tagged Zika NS2B (48\u201374) with the C-half deleted. escence spectrum indicates that its four Trp residues are similarly buried as linked and unlinked Zika complexes with the full-length soluble domain of NS2B. despite being less disordered, this complex showed no detectable enzymatic activity even with the protease concentration up to 20 M. previously, we generated a truncated Dengue NS2B with the same C-half deleted but the shorter NS2B is unable to form a soluble our results suggest that being disordered for the NS2B C-half might have other functional advantages offered by intrinsically disordered proteins [44], such as to allow the formation of dynamic replication complex observed in HCV replication [45,46]. the linked and unlinked Zika complexes showed the highest activity in the presence of 30% glycerol while the unlinked had the highest activity in the presence of 20% glycerol (S4D Fig). the linked and unlinked complexes only have slightly differences for their kinetic constants in the buffer without any organic solvents. 3pro has NS2B (49\u201395) and NS3 (1\u2013170) also linked by the same (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 linker. kcat values are almost identical, but the Km value is 2.4-fold less than our current one. 58,361 unlinked complex (50 mM Tris buffer pH 8.5 + 20% Glycerol) 75.9 7.2 171.5 1.7 2,279,450 214,520 Unlinked complex (50 mM Tris buffer pH 8.5 + 20% Glycerol + 1% DMSO) 85.1 4.8 126.5 2.2 1,482,086 62810 Screening and characterization of natural product inhibitors Due to the urgency to fight ZIKV infection, we attempted to screen Isorhamnetin, also called 3\u2019-Methylquercetin, has a much weaker inhibitory activity (IC50 of 15.46 M and Ki of 6.22 M) than Quercetin (IC50 of 2.42 M and Ki of 1.12 M), although a hydroxyl group at 3\u2019 position of phenyl ring is absent in Luteolin (Fig 3A). weaver-Burk plots for determining inhibitory constants (Ki) of six natural products on Zika NS2B-NS3pro. [S] is the substrate concentration; v is the initial reaction rate. the curves were generated by the program GraphPad Prism 7.0. spectroscopy cannot be used to investigate the interaction between those compounds and Zika NS2B-NS3pro. the presence of 20% glycerol significantly increased the rotational tumbling time of the protein which made NMR peaks too broad for detection. the complexes bind to the pockets on the back of the active site of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. the crystal structure (PDB code of 5LC0) of Zika NS2B-NS3pro determined with an active site inhibitor cn-716 (in spheres) to which six natural products were docked. green, red and yellow are used respectively to color loop, helix and -strand of NS3pro domain. brown, cyan and purple are respectively for loop, helix and -strand of NS2B. the binding pockets have slightly-different local geometries but very distinctive electrostatic properties. the Zika pocket is more polar and negatively charged, while the Dengue-2 pocket is less polar and positively charged (S6 Fig). hydrogen bond networks formed between Zika NS2B-NS3pro and six compounds. the hydrogen bond between proton of 3\u2019-hydroxyl group and backbone oxygen of Lys73 is lost. this hydrogen bond appears to significantly contribute to the inhibitory activity as the inhibitory constant Ki of Isorhamnetin increases by 6 times as compared to Quercetin. however, this hydrogen bond appears to be not very important as only a very slight reduction of the inhibitory activity was observed for Luteolin as compared to Quercetin. one phenyl ring of Curcumin occupies the pocket identical to five flavonoids with the formation of hydrogen bonds with Gln74 and Gly124. another phenyl ring has additional contacts with a new pocket with unique hydrogen bonds with Asp122 and Ile165. a high affinity, which is achieved by establishing bivalent binding sites, has been extensively found. in the open conformation, most NS2B residues are tightly packed with the NS3pro domain as revealed by the crystal structure. in the present study, we first constructed and characterized the Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex with NS2B and NS3pro linked by an artificial (Gly)4-(Ser)-(Gly)4 sequence. despite slight differences in sequence length, the catalytic parameters (Table 1) of our linked Zika complex have no significant difference a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum of the 15N-labeled NS3pro domain in complex with unlabeled NS2B with sharper NMR peaks. the results revealed that the Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex, the C-terminal residues Arg73-Lys100 of NS2B remain highly disordered unlike the Dengue-2 NS2B-NS3pro complex in the open conformation. we identified five flavonoids and one natural phenol to specifically inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro. the strongest Myricertin has a Ki of 770 nM. the difference might be due to the linked Zika NS2B-NS3pro. five flavonoids are rich in various edible plants including caper, tea, red onion, celery, broccoli, green pepper and turmeric. the same flavonoids inhibit the Zika NS2B-NS3pro complex with higher activity [24,32,48,53] isolated NS3 (14\u2013185) and NS2B (48\u2013100) with the transmembrane regions removed, as well as NS2B (48\u201374) with the C-region further deleted. DNA fragments were designed for linking NS2B (48\u2013100) to NS3 (14\u2013185) by (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 using overlap PCR as previously described. bin-agarose beads from Thrombin CleanCleaveTM Kit (Sigma-aldrich, St. Louis, MO) followed by binding to an excess amount of Ni-NTA beads to remove his-tag and uncleaved fusion protein. to obtain the linked complex in inclusion body, the cell pellets were re-suspended in cold PBS buffer at pH 7.4, containing 10 mM -mercaptoethanol and 8 M urea. the superna all recombinant protease samples were checked by Tris-Glycine SDS PAGE. however, small peptides diffuse significantly and thus usually cannot be seen. reverse-phase (RP) high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an analytic C8 column was used to check the presence of the isolated NS2B peptides. a pair of triple-resonance experiments were acquired. HSQC spectra of Zika NS2B-NS3pro only with NS2B 15N-labeled were acquired in the absence and in the presence of BPTI (Sigma-Aldrich) Zika protease at 50 nM was incubated with substrates ranging from 10 to 1000 M in 100 l assay buffer at 37\u00b0C. initial fluorescence or absorbance velocities were converted to MS-1 from a standard ACMC calibration curve. the assay was performed with different final concentrations of the inhibitors and substrate. the reaction was initiated by adding Bz-nKRR-AMC to 250 M. all measurements were performed in triplicate. the results were clustered with each cluster having a tolerance of 2. The complexes with the lowest energy were selected for analysis and display. genes by GenScript were used as templates for amplifying DNA fragments encoding the isolated NS3 (14\u2013185) and NS2B (48\u2013100) isolated NS2B and NS3 protein expressions were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C. soluble form was purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography under native condition. refolded complex subjected to cleavage of his-tag and final FPLC purification. purified NS2B (48\u2013100)/NS2B (48\u201374) and NS3 (14\u2013185) were mixed up with an excess amount of NS3. the mixture was subjected to refolding by dialysis against PBS buffer (pH 7.4) with 10 mM -mercaptoethanol at 4\u00b0C overnight. opolarimeter and data from five independent scans were added and averaged [21]. to assess the effects of DMSO and glycerol on the conformation of Zika NS2B-NS3pro, we monitored the change of its intrinsic UV fluorescence instead of circular dichroism. 50 mM citrate-phosphate buffer for pH 4\u20135, 50 mM phosphate buffer for pH 5.5\u20138, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer for pH 8.5\u20139.5, and 50 mM Na-bicarbonate buffer for pH 10\u201310.5. to screen natural product inhibitors of Zika NS2B-NS3pro, we also measured the Km values of Zika NS2B-NS3pro in presence of DMSO and glyce the Zika protease at 50 nM was preincubated for 30 min with different compounds at final concentrations of 5 and 500 M dissolved in 1 l DMSO, followed by adding Bz-nKRR-AMC to 250 M to initiate reaction. only the compounds showing significant inhibitions at both concentrations were subject to further determination of IC50 and Ki. autoDock software was used to dock six compounds to the crystal structure of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. the grid box was set with 74 70 66 (x,y,z axis) with the default 0.375 spacing. the initial population size was set to 300, and number of docking runs was set as 150. the exact same sample for SDS PAGE shown in (D) was analysed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reverse-phase (RP) C4 column, which clearly showed the presence of two peaks: one eluted out at 8.1 min for NS2B and another at 27.4 min for NS3pro. pink arrow is used to indicate the HSQC peak of Trp61 side chain in NS2B. red arrow is used to indicate the region with significant sequence variations between Zika and Dengue. 3pro complexes in 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.5. additional presence of glycerol at 0, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%. inhibitory data used for fitting IC50 values for Isorhamnetin and Apigenin. the yellow ellipsoid indicates the pocket previously identified for binding flavonoids including Myricetin and Quercetin."}
