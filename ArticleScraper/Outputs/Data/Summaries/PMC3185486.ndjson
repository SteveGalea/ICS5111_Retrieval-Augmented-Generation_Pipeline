{"summary": "occurrence of FIP among all cats seen at veterinary medical teaching hospitals in the USA from 1986\u20131995 was 1:200 among new feline visits, 1:300 among total cat accessions, and 1% of accessions at diagnostic laboratories. the disease was thought to be viral when first described but no specific etiologic agent was identified at the time. 85% of FECVs studied had deleterious mutations in a small accessory gene called 3c. these mutations were either deletions or introduced stop codons. there is a general feeling that FECV and FECV are either the same virus, with disease dependent on the nature of the host\u2019s immune response. the major tenant of the theory assumes that functional mutations in the 3c gene are somehow related to the FIP biotype. the second correlate assumes compartmentalization of enteric and FIP biotypes to gut and internal tissues. the third correlate, if correct, should show FIPVs to be as geographically diverse as the FECVs from which they arise. all of the genes sequenced, only the 3c genes of the FIPV isolates had SNPs that resulted in premature stop codons or deletions that caused frame shifts. mutability, degree of relatedness, and nature of the functional mutation in the 3c gene are given for each cat. 92 Early stop FJ917526 Cat-T FIPV-UCD-17 E,M,N,3a\u2013c,7a,b na/4660 92 Early stop FJ917527 392312 FIPV-UCD-18a E,M,N,3a\u2013c,7a,b na/4529 91 Deletions FJ917528 FIPV-UCD-18b FJ917529 a SNP differences between tissue virus and the the omentum viruses from Red consisted of two distinct variants. two variants were sequenced from the omentum of Toby, one with a non-functional 3c gene (FIPV-UCD12) and one with a functional 3c gene (FECV-UCD5). Viruses were readily detected in the diseased tissues of cats 388210, 388406, Cat-T, and 392312. FIPV-UCD15a possessed a two-nucleotide deletion near the end of the 3c gene and a second deletion of 48-nucleotide involving the terminus of 3b and beginning of 3c. coronaviruses isolated from the feces of two cats, Tux and Toby, were 99% identical and contained identical 3c gene mutations to the omental viruses from the same cats. the sequence obtained from the fecal virus of Simba, a housemate of Lucy, also had an intact 3c gene and was designated FECV-UCD4. FECV-UCD4 was most closely related to the consensus nucleotide sequences of coronavirus isolates 9943762 Simba FECV-UCD4 E, M, N, 3c, 7a,b 15/4166b 99.65 Intact FJ9943763 Toby FIPV-UCD12 3a,b,7a,b 0/2954 100 Deletion FJ9943765 FJ9943766 Tux FIPV-UCD13c E,M,N,3a\u2013c,7a,b 7/4486 99.84 the 3c gene sequence of the fecal virus of cat 388406 was intact and 99% related to the FIPV found in diseased tissue. the 3c gene of 388210 fecal virus contained a deliterious two-nucleotide deletion near the end of the 3c gene and was designated FECV-UCD6. the deletion was also detected in the lesional FIPV-UCD15a. only 11/13 (85%) of the FIPVs reported by Vennema et al. had deliterious 3c gene mutations. the existence of helper/defective virus replication in the latter situation also needs to be considered. the existence of helper/defective virus replication in the latter situation also needs to be considered. a premature stop codon limited the 3c gene product to the first 16 amino acids. it is also unlikely that mutations in other accessory or structural genes are involved in FIP. there is little scientific evidence that other accessory genes are involved in FIP. lesional viruses from the eight FIP cats in this study were easily differentiated from each other based on deliterious 3c gene mutations alone. an infectious inoculum made from the diseased omentum of one of the FIP cats induced FIP in 3 of 12 cats that were experimentally infected. there is little precedence for a functional 3c gene mutant to be both a cause and effect of the disease. experimental infection of lab cats establishes that FIPV-UCD11a, b possess the FIP biotype. co-infection with both variants leads to infection with one or the other variant. three of these cats developed effusive FIP within 2\u20134 weeks. consensus sequence of FIPV-UCD11a, b, and nature of the functional mutation in the 3c gene are given for each cat. b Variant strain isolated from experimentally infected cat c Variant strain used for SNP comparison. significant sequence differences exist between feline coronavirus isolates from disparate geographic regions of the western US. the study adds to our knowledge of genetic drift among feline coronaviruses that inhabit the same cat, multi-cat household or cattery. the single founder virus effect was confirmed in the present study. marked genetic drift occurs when a single coronavirus strain is serially passed from one susceptible population to the next. this scenario was supported by animal transmission studies; when cats were simultaneously infected with two closely related variants of FIPV, each variant segregated into different cats. all eight FIPVs from this study clearly belonged to serotype I based on their 3a protein sequences. known serotype II viruses and the canine coronavirus formed a separate group. the reference sequence is from FIPV-UCD11. evidence that FIPV may have been shed in urine of infected cats [35] and that coronavirus may be present in the blood, especially among younger cats [36] there are also several reports of FIP outbreaks of sufficient magnitude and acuteness to suggest horizontal transmission. this study indicated the need to carefully study fecal and lesional virus isolates. the 3c protein of feline coronavirus plays an important role in viral assembly, spread and pathogenesis, as well as to protective immunity. truncating mutations in the 3c gene are virtually identical with the exception of truncating mutations in the 3c gene Complete structural (S, E, M, N) and accessory (3a\u2013c and 7 a, b) gene sequences were obtained from diseased omentum of the four related cats that died of FIP. a variable truncation of the 3c protein is given for each cat. the genes sequenced, their mutability, degree of relatedness and the nature of the functional mutation in the 3c gene are given for each cat.

FECV-UCD4 was most closely related to the consensus nucleotide sequences of coronavirus 7 SNPs between fecal virus and consensus sequence of FECVs from other related cats were found in colonic scraping and the diseased omentum. a similar finding was found for the cats that were unrelated to those described above. the 3c gene of 388210 fecal virus contained a deliterious two-nucleotide deletion near the end of the 3c gene and was designated FECV-UCD6. the deletion was also detected in the lesional FIPV-UCD15a. only the 7a, b genes were sequenced from the feces of Cat-T. the existence of helper/defective virus replication in the latter situation also needs to be considered. animal inoculation studies to determine the biotype of a given feline coronavirus are critical for determining the ultimate biotype. 3c mutations in FIPVs occur significantly out of proportion to mutations in other structural or accessory genes. there is little scientific evidence, especially based on animal inoculation, that other accessory genes are involved in FIP. however, both of the latter cats were related and had been experimentally infected with an identical FECV. an infectious inoculum made from the diseased omentum of one of the FIP cats induced FIP in 3 of 12 cats that were experimentally infected. the possibility that deleterious 3c gene mutations are an effect of the disease and not a cause also has to be considered. experimental infection of laboratory cats establishes that FIPV-UCD11a, b possess the FIP biotype and that co-infection with both variants leads to infection with one or the other variant. three of these cats developed effusive FIP within 2\u20134 weeks. nts sequenceda Type of mutation in 3c GenBank Accession #

Deleterious mutations in 3c tend to be found in diseased internal tissues. viruses with intact 3c are found mainly in the feces. the high mutability of feline coronaviruses leads to minor genetic differences between cats in one geographic area. significant genetic differences are seen between isolates from geographically disparate regions."}
