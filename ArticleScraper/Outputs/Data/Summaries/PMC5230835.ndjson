{"summary": "many public health jurisdictions are unprepared to receive and process eCR without additional investment, guidance, and assistance. many jurisdictions are unprepared to receive and process eCR without additional investment, guidance, and assistance to enhance their IT infrastructure and workforce. the eICR would consist of a standard set of data elements, vocabularies, and value sets (ie, a group of acceptable responses for a data element or question) the list of data elements has been drafted by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) based on elements already used for meaningful use and will not require new functions for the EHR. the eICR would be identified in the EHR through a standard set of trigger codes that flag when a provider diagnoses, or considers diagnosing, a reportable condition. the association of public health Laboratories (APHL), CSTE, and CDC have already vetted the reportable trigger codes for 5 conditions. the list of standard trigger codes will reside in EHRs but can be updated from a CDC subscription service that curates and allows access to trigger codes as needed. the CSTE has completed an initial pilot of the RCKMS. it includes logic for adjudicating potential cases of pertussis, hepatitis, elevated blood lead levels, and tuberculosis for 10 jurisdictions. on most intermediary platforms, data containing personally identifiable information will be resident very briefly. only limited data that contain no personally identifiable information will be saved for auditing. work began in 2013 with a 3-year, $3-million investment through a cooperative agreement with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. the PHCP is envisioned to support information sharing (eg, immunization registries, case reporting) between public health and health care providers and among jurisdictions. the public health informatics Institute has begun to outline a robust communications plan on eCR with public health partners. the next steps are to conduct proof-of-concept demonstration projects for eCR to provide initial incremental success. eCR offers the promise of improving public health by enhancing the speed and accuracy of this crucial exchange. eCR will decrease the amount of work needed by local and state public health agencies to obtain case information from health care providers. eCR can foster a reprioritization of activities and resources at state and local health departments that can lead to enhanced tools and methods to prevent disease."}
