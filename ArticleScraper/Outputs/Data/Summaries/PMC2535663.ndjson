{"summary": "a positive-stranded RNA genome replicates in the cytoplasm of infected host cells. it is driven by a membrane-bound viral enzyme complex that is commonly associated with modified intracellular membranes. the replication complexes of positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses of eukaryotes are invariably associated with modified intracellular membranes. morphogenesis, ultrastructure, and function of these complexes are only beginning to be understood. they may facilitate the concentration of viral macromolecules and provide a membrane-based structural framework for RNA synthesis. potential benefits include the possibility to coordinate different steps in the viral life cycle and to delay the induction of host defense mechanisms. replicative enzymes of coronaviruses, like an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a helicase, are common among +RNA viruses. resulting set of subgenomic transcripts (eight in the case of SARS-CoV) serves to express structural and accessory protein genes in the 3\u2032-proximal domain of the genome. nidovirus replicase includes transmembrane domains (TM), protease domains (PLP and MP) and (putative) RNA primase (P), helicase (HEL), exonuclease (Exo), endoribonuclease (N), and methyl transferase (MT) activities. arrows represent sites in pp1ab that are cleaved by the nsp3 papa nsp13 localize to the outside of DMVs and/or the region between DMVs. the origin of DMV membranes has remained undecided since other studies have implicated other organelles in the formation of RTCs and DMVs. previous ultrastructural studies may have been hampered by the technical challenge of DMV preservation [28] the reticulovesicular network of modified ER membranes includes convoluted membranes that were not previously implicated in viral RNA synthesis. the virus-induced \u201creplication network\u201d documented here places the early stages of the viral lifecycle and accompanying virus\u2013host interactions in new perspective. at 7 h p.i., a 100-nm-thick slice through the center of an infected Vero E6 cell generally contained between 200 and 300 DMVs. the cells were cryofixed and freeze substituted at 2 h p.i. (A), 8 h p.i. (B\u2013D), or 10 h p.i. (E) DMVs were concentrated in the perinuclear area (nucleus; N), often with mitochondria (M) lying in between. during the later stages of infection, DMVs appeared to merge into VPs. scale bars represent 100 nm (A), 250 nm (B and D), or 1 m (C and E) our observations define VPs as a third distinct modification of intracellular membranes that is induced by SARS-CoV infection. by 10 h p.i., VPs appeared to have merged into even larger cytoplasmic vacuoles containing both vesicles and significant numbers of budding and completed virions. the analysis was performed at 7 h p.i., a time point at which the various membrane alterations were abundantly present in the absence of advanced cytopathology. in some cells, infection had progressed more than in others, allowing the visualization of both advanced and earlier stages of infection in the same specimen. tomograms were computed from dual-axis tilt series of the 200-nm-thick section shown in (A) the tomographic slice has a thickness of 1.2 nm. the improved image from (B) following anisotropic diffusion filtering facilitates thresholding and DMV surface rendering. scale bars represent 100 nm (A) or 50 nm (B and C) for most DMVs, we observed one or multiple thin (8 nm in diameter), \u201cneck-like\u201d connections of their outer membrane to the outer membranes of other DMVs, to CM, and to cisternae of the rough ER. 77 out of 81 DMVs analyzed had at least one outer membrane connection. the VPs and the tightly apposed membranes of the CM were found to be integral parts of the same reticulovesicular network. the ET analysis further suggested the presence of fibrous material inside DMV inner vesicles. the outer membrane of the second type of VP was tightly apposed but intact. the outer membrane of the second type of VP appeared more relaxed. we also observed virus budding from the outer membranes of the second type of VP. immunogold EM of the SARS-CoV Replicase in Infected Cells was obtained using rabbit antisera. 15-nm colloidal gold particles conjugated to protein A were used for detection of primary antibodies. labeling for SARS-CoV nsp3 was mainly found on electron-dense areas between DMVs, presumably representing CM as most clearly visible in (B) nsp3 and nsp5 were the most abundantly labeled structures. nsp3 and nsp5 were the most abundantly labeled structures. the interior of DMVs (and VPs) was essentially devoid of label. monoclonal antibody J2 [51], recognizing RNA duplexes larger than 40 base pairs, was reported to be a useful tool in recent IF studies [49,50] monoclonal antibody J2 [51], recognizing RNA duplexes larger than 40 base pairs, was reported to be a useful tool in recent IF studies. SARS-CoV\u2013infected Vero E6 cells were fixed at various time points after infection and processed for IF assays using rabbit antisera recognizing different replicase subunits. time-course experiment showing the development of dsRNA signal, which could be detected as early as 2 h p.i. Later in infection, the initial punctate cytoplasmic staining developed into a number of densely labeled areas close to the nucleus. an abundant and highly specific labeling for dsRNA was observed on the interior of SARS-CoV\u2013induced DMVs. some additional labeling was present in the area between the vesicles (arrow) and type 2 VPs were positive for dsRNA. first DMVs were detected at 2 h postinfection (h p.i.) from 4 h p.i. on, the number of DMVs increased dramatically. a 100-nm-thick slice through the center of an infected Vero E6 cell generally contained between 200 and 300 DMVs. MV inner and outer membranes were generally tightly apposed. but sometimes, luminal spacing between the two lipid bilayers could be discerned. despite the generally excellent preservation of cellular membranes, the documented fragility of coronavirus DMVs makes it clear that we cannot exclude the possibility that these local separations could result from preparation damage. scale bars represent 100 nm (A), 250 nm (B and D), or 1 m (C and E) from 3 h p.i. on, we also observed large assemblies of convoluted membranes (CM), often in close proximity to DMV clusters. these structures, with diameters ranging from 0.2 to 2 m, are probably identical to the \u201creticular inclusions\u201d that were first observed in cells infected with mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MH our observations define VPs as a third distinct modification of intracellular membranes that is induced by SARS-CoV infection. by 10 h p.i., VPs appeared to have merged into even larger cytoplasmic vacuoles, containing both vesicles and budding and completed virions. the analysis was performed at 7 h p.i., a time point at which the various membrane alterations were abundantly present in the absence of advanced cytopathology. in some cells, infection had progressed more than in others, allowing visualization of both advanced and earlier stages of infection in the same specimen. dered model shows interconnected DMVs (outer membrane, gold; inner membrane, silver) and their connection to an ER stack. Arrows point to three clearly visible outer membrane continuities, with insets highlighting these connections in corresponding tomographic slices. at least one connection was visible for 77 out of 81 DMVs analyzed. 38 had a single connection, while 27, nine, and three DMVs had two, three, and four connections. the VPs and the tightly apposed membranes of the CM were found to be integral parts of the same reticulovesicular network. a 3-D surface-rendered model was derived by applying ET on a semi-thick section of a SARS-CoV\u2013infected Vero E6 cell cryofixed at 7 h p.i. Scale bar in (A) represents 100 nm. the type 1 VP present in this image shows an outer membrane that accommodates two tightly apposed inner vesicles. we observed inner membrane discontinuities for many of the vesicles present in the second type of VPs. we also observed virus budding from the outer membranes of the second type of VPs. this suggests the ultimate convergence of RTC-associated membrane structures with compartments involved in virus assembly. a small fraction of the nsp8 signal was reproducibly found on the interior of DMVs. immunogold labeling results were obtained with antisera recognizing the large nsp3 subunit, which contains one of the viral proteases. nsp3 and nsp5 were the most abundantly labeled structures. the interior of Coronavirus-Induced DMVs Labels Abundantly for Double-Stranded RNA A critical step in the replication of +RNA viruses is the production of a negative-stranded copy of the genome. it is widely assumed that viral negative-strand RNA synthesis leads to the formation of partially and/or completely dsRNA structures, commonly referred to as replicative intermediates and replicative forms (RFs) es larger than 40 base pairs, was reported to be a useful tool in recent IF studies [49,50]. we here used the J2 antibody in IF and EM studies, resulting in a highly specific labeling of SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells. mock-infected cells were essentially devoid of signal. sRNA signal could be detected as early as 2 h p.i. later in infection. early signals for dsRNA and both nsps (here shown at 3 h p.i.) were found in close proximity of each other. high-resolution images of dual-labeling experiments for nsp3 and dsRNA later in infection (6 h p.i.) virions present in these structures were always negative for dsRNA. the fibrous material observed in our ET analysis may consist (in part) of viral nucleic acids. in all images, 10-nm gold particles conjugated to protein A were used. membrane structures used to compartmentalize RTCs provide scaffold for viral RNA synthesis. replicate structures can range from distinct spherular membrane invaginations to elaborate networks of CM and single- or double-membrane vesicles. first 3-D ultrastructural analysis of a replication structure of the spherular type was recently reported by Kopek et al. a unique reticulovesicular membrane network is continuous with the rough ER. it contains numerous viral replicase subunits and dsRNA. the network is continuous with the rough ER and contains in its lumen numerous \u201cinner vesicles\u201d. a model showing the network of modified ER membranes supports dsRNA synthesis. the CM, the outer membranes of DMVs and VPs were all found to be continuous with the rough ER. the network appears to connect membrane structures involved in virus replication to sites at which the assembly of new virions occurs. a fusion of type 2 VPs and compartments involved in virus budding is a relatively rare event. it could result from general cytopathology and/or fusion of different membrane compartments. a thorough quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV assembly is beyond the scope of this paper. for only one out of 78 DMVs visible in Videos S1 and S3, an aligned gap of both inner and outer membrane could be detected. the inner membrane was locally disrupted (Figure S1B\u2013S1D), but since these sites also showed local separation of the leaflets of the bilayer, we consider it likely that these interruptions were fixation or processing artifacts. three coronavirus replicase subunits (nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6) contain hydrophobic domains that are predicted to traverse the membrane multiple times. the recent phenotypic characterization of a temperature-sensitive MHV mutant with a lesion in nsp4 revealed a dramatic reduction of DMV formation at the restrictive temperature. however, apart from the question whether the transmembrane nsps are able to form membrane pairing is followed by the wrapping of membrane cisternae around cytosolic constituents and leads to the membrane fission event that is needed to explain the sealed inner membrane. despite the presence of several hundred DMVs in infected cells, we were unable to find morphological profiles that seemed obvious examples of an actual DMV-forming fission event. poliovirus RNA replication occurs on the cytosolic surface of ER-derived vesicles [61], which aggregate into rosette-like structures [1]. poliovirus RNA replication occurs on the cytosolic surface of ER-derived vesicles [61], which aggregate into rosette-like structures [1]. poliovirus-induced vesicles may have a double membrane [63] and implicated the autophagic pathway in their formation [64]. a similar hypothesis was launched to explain MHV DMV formation [32]. nidoviruses, coronaviruses and other nidoviruses induced an open connection between cytosol and nidoviruses. a detergent treatment is required to render the viral RNA synthesizing complex susceptible to digestion with proteases or nucleases [67] flavivirus VPs would be \u201ctopologically similar\u201d to coronavirus VPs and consist of a closed inner vesicle surrounded olytic processing of replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab is assumed to be critical posttranslational step in activation of coronavirus replicative enzyme functions. the fact that most of the label for SARS-CoV nsps was present on CM may seem incompatible with the presence of most of the dsRNA signal on DMVs. the labeling for dsRNA, although widely considered a marker for +RNA virus RTCs [3,49,50], does not formally pinpoint RTC activity. however, it is likely that part of the signal represents dsRNA molecules that are no longer actively engaged in viral RNA synthesis. it is likely that part of the signal represents dsRNA molecules that are no longer actively engaged in viral RNA synthesis. a scenario in which part of the dsRNA signal represents molecules that are not present in active RTCs cannot be ruled out at present. the active complex might localize to the CM, where small amounts of dsRNA labeling and the bulk of the viral nsps were detected. the subsequent formation of DMVs could be postulated to constitute an elegant mechanism to conceal viral RNA. replication structures can range from distinct spherular membrane invaginations to elaborate networks of CM and single- or double-membrane vesicles. the replicase and RNA synthesis of flock house virus were found to be confined to spherular invaginations of the mitochondrial outer membrane. this connection is assumed to be sufficient and essential for the import of, e.g., nucleotides into replication spherule the average diameter of the SARS-CoV\u2013induced DMVs (250\u2013300 nm) exceeds the maximum thickness (200 nm) of the sections that could be used for ET made it generally impossible to visualize their entire perimeter. however, the number of inter-DMV connections that could be observed in the reconstructed volume justifies the conclusion that they form an integrated network. the CM, the outer membranes of DMVs and VPs, and\u2014ultimately\u2014membrane compartments used for virus budding were all found to be continuous with the rough ER. the network appears to connect membrane structures involved in SARS-CoV RNA synthesis to sites at which the assembly of new virions occurs. a thorough quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV assembly is beyond the scope of this paper. it would require the collection of extensive datasets, in particular around the peak time of virus assembly (10\u201312 h p.i.) only one out of 78 DMVs visible in Videos S1 and S3, an aligned gap of both inner and outer membrane could be detected. despite previously documented fragility of the inner membrane in particular, this property may also be related to the puzzling inner membrane discontinuities observed for type 2 VPs late in infection. this property may also be related to the puzzling inner membrane discontinuities observed for type 2 VPs late in infection. a temperature-sensitive MHV mutant with a lesion in nsp4 revealed a dramatic reduction of DMV formation at the restrictive temperature. a phenotypic characterization of a temperature-sensitive MHV mutant with a lesion in nsp4 revealed a dramatic reduction of DMV formation at the restrictive temperature. other conceptual problems would remain. inner and outer bilayer may be \u201cphysically associated\u201d due, for example, to interacting luminal domains of protein partners present in the two membranes. the inner membranes are tightly associated just up to the point where narrow neck-like connections protrude to the outer membrane of other vesicles or compartments. this would suggest that the interaction between the two membranes eventually weakens. the absence of ribosomes from inner membranes lends credibility to a scenario involving a preformed inner vesicle derived from another membrane source. the future identification of inhibitory drugs or dominant-negative mutants of viral or host proteins involved in this step may facilitate the visualization of this crucial intermediate stage in DMV morphogenesis. IF studies using autophagosomal marker proteins contradict the \u201cautophagy hypothesis\u201d [28,30]. our studies may have uncovered a closer parallel to the membranes with which the replication complexes of flaviviruses are associated. these structures include \u201cconvoluted membranes\u201d and \u201cvesicle packets\u201d. a detergent treatment is required to render the viral RNA synthesizing complex susceptible to digestion with proteases or nucleases. flavivirus VPs would be \u201ctopologically similar\u201d to coronavirus VPs. if a future ET analysis of flavivirus replication structures were to confirm this similarity, we would essentially be faced with the same question for both virus groups. the labeling for dsRNA may seem incompatible with the presence of most of the dsRNA signal on the CM. nsp3 and nsp5 were detected on the CM in this study. the labeling for dsRNA does not formally pinpoint RTC activity. dsRNA signal represents dsRNA molecules that are no longer active in viral RNA synthesis. part of the signal, a part that may in fact vary between different viruses, represents dsRNA molecules that are no longer active in viral RNA synthesis. a scenario in which part, or even most, of the signal represents molecules that are not present in active RTCs. coronaviruses are capable of interacting and interfering with the innate immune system at multiple levels, likely also depending on the cell type involved. both SARS-CoV and MHV [72\u201374] were found to counteract the induction of interferon via cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors that can sense the presence of viral dsRNA. nsp8 subunits were prefixed overnight with 3% paraformaldehyde. cell monolayers adhered to Thermanox coverslips (Nunc) were plunged into liquid ethane. for cryofixation, cell monolayers adhered to Thermanox coverslips were plunged into liquid ethane.
