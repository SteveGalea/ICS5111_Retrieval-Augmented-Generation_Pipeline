{"summary": "HPAI H5N1 Virus Infection Reduces AFC and Enhances APP in human alveolar epithelial cells. monolayers of primary human alveolar epithelial cells demonstrating tight junctions were grown on apical chambers of transwell culture inserts. highly pathogenic influenza viruses significantly reduce human alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and significantly increase human alveolar protein permeability (APP) the effects were caused by soluble mediators released from H5N1 or H7N9 virus-infected cells. all viruses replicated productively, and a statistically significant increase in titers was detected at 8 h and 24 h p.i. a statistically significant increase in titers was detected at 8 h and 24 h p.i. coculture with human lung fibroblasts or PBS had no effect. MSCs have a dose-dependent effect on H5N1-impaired AFC and APP. but even with 10,000 cells, MSCs still mediate a significant decrease in the impairment of AFC. the mRNA expression of the major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines IFN-, interleukin (IL)-1, RANTES, IP10, IL6 and IL8 was significantly greater in alveolar epithelial cells infected with H5N1 483/97 virus than in the cells infected with human influenza H1N1 54/98. coculture of H5N1 virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells with MSCs Western blot analysis showed reduced expression of CFTR and 1-Na,K-ATPase protein in H5N1 virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells at 24 h p.i. and further reduction of 1-Na,K-ATPase at 48 h p.i. 5N1-induced effects were prevented by coculture with MSCs at 48 h p.i. expression of transporter proteins CFTR and 1Na,K-ATPase was significantly enhanced. Ang1 and KGF are paracrine soluble factors associated with the beneficial effects of MSCs in preclinical models. ELISA measured the effect of Ang1 and KGF on the AFC and APP of H5N1 virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells. we selectively knocked down Ang1 and/or KGF protein in MSCs by using Ang1 and KGF siRNAs, separately or together. growth factor secretion by mesenchymal stromal cells contributes to reduction of AFC and APP impairment. ang1 and KGF mRNA was knocked down in MSCs by using 300 nM Ang1 and/or 100 nM KGF siRNA. all experiments were carried out in aged (6\u20138 wk) mice inoculated with H5N1 virus and injected i.v. with 5 105 MSCs/100 L (n = 16) or with mouse fibroblasts (controls, n = 25) survival and weight loss were comparable with that with mouse fibroblast treatment. survival of mice injected with MSC (n = 51) or mouse fibroblasts (n = 50) data are the mean from three experiments. wet-to-dry lung weight ratio of mice treated with MSCs (n = 3) or mouse fibroblasts (n = 83). all experiments were carried out in aged (8\u201312 mo) mice inoculated with H5N1 virus. injected i.v. with 5 105 MSCs/100 L or mouse fibroblasts on day 5 p.i. all experiments were carried out in aged (8\u201312 mo) mice. the BAL fluid at day 7 p.i. showed significantly fewer CD4+ T cells (P = 0.008) and NK cells (P = 0.039) and significantly more macrophages/monocytes (P = 0.028) after MSC treatment, the macrophage/monocyte population in the BAL fluid was predominantly alveolar macrophages with an M2 phenotype (CD11c+ Ly6Cint F4/80+) (14) (P = MSC-treated and control mice did not seem to differ in alveolar epithelial or endothelial cell proliferation. improved lung pathology and histopathology scores of aged mice treated with H5N1 virus. the H5N1 viruses (483/97, 486/97, and 3046/04) and H7N9 virus (Sh2) caused much greater reduction of AFC (all P 0.0001) than mock infection at 24 h postinfection (p.i.) the other human seasonal influenza viruses, H1N1 (OK/447), H3N2 (1174/99), affected AFC and APP similarly to H1N1 54/98 (Fig. S2). the effect of conditioned medium (virus-free supernatant) from cells infected with H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses affected the AFC and APP of alveolar epithelial cells compared with the live influenza viruses. the effect of conditioned medium (virus-free supernatant) affected the AFC and APP of human alveolar epithelial cells compared with the live influenza viruses. highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 virus significantly reduces human alveolar fluid clearance (A) and significantly increases human alveolar protein permeability (APP) compared with low pathogenic seasonal influenza viruses. coculture with MSCs reduces the Adverse Effect of H5N1 Infection on AFC, APP, and Proinflammatory Cytokine Responses in human alveolar epithelial cells. cells cocultured with MSCs in the basolateral chamber showed a significantly greater increase in net AFC (A) and decrease in APP (B) across the transwell inserts than untreated infected cells, mock-cocultured cells, or cells cocultured with fibroblasts. data represent the mean SE from three experiments. IL-1 (P = 0.035), RANTES (P = 0.024), IL6 (P = 0.022), IL8 (P = 0.031) and IP10 (P = 0.006) mRNA levels compared with cells without MSC coculture. coculture with MSCs reduced expression of cytokines and chemokines. the effects were confirmed in the protein expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) these effects were prevented by coculture with MSCs at 48 h p.i. expression of the transporter proteins CFTR and 1Na,K-ATPase was significantly enhanced. 1,015 at 48 h p.i., compared with levels in mock cocultures. growth factor secretion by mesenchymal stromal cells enhanced by coculture with alveolar epithelial cells. Ang1 siRNA or KGF siRNA reduced the MSC-mediated increase of AFC by 35% and 30%, respectively, compared with mock or MSCs with scrambled siRNA-transfected. addition of 100 ng/mL recombinant human (rh) Ang1 and KGF alone to H5N1 virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells in the absence of MSCs reduced the virus-mediated decrease of AFC and APP impairment in infected alveolar epithelium cocultured with MSCs with knock-down of Ang1, KGF or both showed (A) less increase of AFC and (B) less decrease of APP than cells cocultured with intact MSCs. dotted lines indicate AFC and APP in mock-infected cells. all experiments were carried out in aged (6\u20138 wk) mice inoculated with A/Hong Kong/486/1997(H5N1) virus and injected i.v. with 5 105 MSCs/100 L or mouse fibroblasts on day 5 p.i. immune cell profile of BAL fluid on day 7 p.i. from mice treated with MSCs (n = 4) or mouse fibroblasts (n = 4). Counts were repeated at least twice. effects of treatment with MSCs in aged animal model of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus infection. concentration of major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in BAL fluid at day 7 p.i. in mice treated with MSCs (n = 4) or mouse fibroblasts (n = 4) comparison of the wet-to-dry lung weight indicated the net effect of alveolar fluid clearance. extravasation of Evans blue dye was an indicator of fluid leakage into the alveolar spaces. e and chemokine proteins tested (IP10, MCP-1, MCP-3, M1P-1 alpha, RANTES, IL-4, IL-17, and TNF-alpha) were significantly lower in the BAL fluid of MSC-treated mice. CFTR protein expression was significantly higher in the lung lysates of MSC-treated mice than in fibroblast-treated mice at day 7 p.i. soluble mediators released from influenza virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells impair alveolar fluid clearance and protein permeability by down-regulating alveolar sodium and chloride transporter proteins. this pathology was prevented or reduced by coculture with MSCs in vitro and by MSC treatment in vivo in aged mice. in vitro experimental model of escherichia coli endotoxin-induced acute lung injury showed that alveolar fluid clearance was impaired via proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (10), demonstrating the physiological relevance of the model we used. we found that when MSC expression of the growth factors Ang1 and/or KGF was knocked down by siRNA, the MSCs were less able to attenuate the effects of H5N1 virus infection on alve age affects various MSC functions, including expression and secretion of soluble factors important in recovery from lung injury (20) age-related loss of lung repair capacity may also explain the progressive age-related increase in the clinical severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (23, 24) and pandemic H1N1 virus infection (25) and the higher mortality reported in older patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (26). age-related changes may account for some of these findings. pathogenic mechanisms of H5N1 viruses differ in important ways from seasonal or pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses (30, 31) pathogenic mechanisms and potential benefits of MSC therapy very likely depend on factors relating to both the virus and the host. the seasonal influenza A virus was A/Shanghai/2/2013 (Sh2) all viruses were human isolates. they were grown in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells and then aliquotted. soluble growth mediators Ang1 and KGF were reverse-transfected with 300 nM Ang1 (121280; Ambion) and/or 100 nM KGF (10818; Ambion) silencing RNA (siRNA) duplex or with scrambled siRNA (negative control) female Balb/C mice aged 6\u20138 wk (young) or 8\u201312 mo (\u201caged\u201d) were inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID three mice per group were killed for measurement of pulmonary microvascular permeability and CFTR protein expression. on days 10 and 18 p.i., four mouse lungs per group were fixed for histopathology. the cells were plated on 24-well transwell insets to establish an air\u2013liquid interface. the cells were then aliquotted and stored at 80 \u00b0C. the cells were then aliquotted and stored at 80 \u00b0C. female Balb/C mice aged 6\u20138 wk (young) or 8\u201312 mo (aged) were inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 of 486/97 influenza virus in 25 L. at day 5 p.i., mice were injected i.v. with 5 105 human bone marrow-derived MSCs in 100 L. a 96-well tissue culture plate of confluent MDCK cells was prepared 1 d before virus titration. the plates were observed daily for cytopathic effects in 50% of inoculated wells. human alveolar epithelial cells were cultured in -MEM without ribonucleosides or deoxyribonucleosides (GibcoBRL) containing 2 mM l-glutamine, 16.5% (vol/vol) HyClone FBS (SV30160.03; Thermo Fisher) and 1% each of penicillin and streptomycin. the pellet was resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F12 medium and small airway basal medium (Lonza) supplemented with 0.5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (hEGF), 500 ng/mL epinephrine, 10 g/mL transferrin, 5 g/mL insulin, 0.1 ng/mL triiodothyronine, 0.5 g/mL hydro alveolar epithelial cells were plated on the apical chamber of 24-well Costar Transwell inserts with a 0.4-m pore size (Corning), at a density of 100,000 cells per well. the plated cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37 \u00b0C) the virus-free supernatants were used to treat the influenza A virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells to observe the effect on alveolar fluid transport and protein permeability across the alveolar epithelial cell monolayers. a mixture of the cytokines IL-1, TNF-, and IFN- was used at 50 ng/mL as a positive control for lung injury. the net alveolar fluid transport in Lcm2h1 was measured as [1 \u2013 (fluorescence reading in the initial sample/weight of the initial sample)/(fluorescence reading in the final sample/weight of the final sample)] 100. the remaining fluid in the basolateral chamber was collected after 24 h. the primers for the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were described previously. the primers for the other genes of interest were obtained from Sigma. each gene\u2019s expression was calculated after normalization to beta-actin expression. soluble proteins secreted by MSCs were measured by a flow cytometry-based immunoassay. soluble proteins secreted by MSCs included angiopoietin-1 and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the main cause of disease and death in Balb/C mice experimentally infected with this H5N1 influenza virus strain. some other H5N1 virus strains commonly used for experimental studies in mice are associated with virus dissemination to the brain. the concentration of extravasated Evans blue dye in lung homogenates was calculated against a standard curve. a pathologist blinded to the experimental details histopathologically scored airway, vascular, and parenchymal inflammation on a 13-point scale. cells were stained for 30 min on ice with one of three panels of monoclonal antibodies to innate and adaptive immune cells. all in vitro experiments were performed independently, using at least three different mice. results shown in the figures are the calculated mean and SEM from three independent experiments. groups were compared by using an unpaired, two-tailed t test. a 96-well tissue culture plate of confluent MDCK cells was prepared 1 d before virus titration (TCID50) cells were washed once with PBS, and medium was replenished with serum-free minimum essential medium (MEM) the plates were observed daily for cytopathic effects in 50% of inoculated wells. containing 2 mM l-glutamine, 16.5% (vol/vol) HyClone FBS (SV30160.03; Thermo Fisher) and 1% each of penicillin and streptomycin. cell clumps were dispersed by repeatedly pipetting the cell suspension for 10 min. onza supplemented with 0.5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (hEGF), 500 ng/mL epinephrine, 10 g/mL transferrin, 5 g/mL insulin, 0.1 ng/mL triiodothyronine, 0.5 g/mL hydrocortisone, 30 g/mL bovine pituitary extract, and 0.5 mg/mL BSA, with 5% alveolar epithelial cells were plated on the apical chamber of 24-well Costar Transwell inserts with a 0.4-m pore size (Corning), at a density of 100,000 cells per well. the cells were dissociated with trypsin, detached into Hanks\u2019 buffered saline solution, and seeded as described below in the transwell culture inserts. the virus-free supernatants were used to treat the influenza A virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells. cytokines IL-1, TNF-, and IFN- were used at 50 ng/mL as a positive control for lung injury. the net alveolar fluid transport in Lcm2h1 was measured as [1 \u2013 (fluorescence reading in the initial sample/weight of the initial sample)/(fluorescence reading in the final sample/weight of the final sample)] 100. the remaining fluid in the basolateral chamber was collected after 24 h of dextran incubation. the primers for the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were described previously (6). the primers for the other genes of interest were obtained from Sigma. each gene\u2019s expression was calculated after normalization to beta-actin expression. soluble proteins secreted by MSCs, including angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), were measured in the supernatants of MSC monolayers by ELISA (R&D Systems) soluble proteins secreted by MSCs were measured in the supernatants of MSC monolayers. acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the main cause of disease and death. some other H5N1 virus strains commonly used in mice are associated with virus dissemination to the brain. encephalitis is the major cause of death. pathologist blinded to experimental details histopathologically scored airway, vascular, and parenchymal inflammation on a 13-point scale in tissue sections prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lungs. cells were stained for 30 min on ice with one of three panels of monoclonal antibodies to innate and adaptive immune cells. all in vitro experiments were performed independently, using at least three different mice;
