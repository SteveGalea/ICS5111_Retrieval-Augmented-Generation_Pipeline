{"summary": "foodborne pathogens cause foodborne diseases (FBDs) either directly (by infectious agents) or indirectly (by toxic metabolites, i.e., bacterial toxins and mycotoxins; EMAN, 2015; ECDC, 2014; ECDC, 2015a; Henao et al., 2015). Typical FBDs are diarrheal diseases, with particularly high impact on children (Pires et al., 2015). four sectors are considered as potential users of high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies for detection and characterization of foodborne pathogens (FBPs) the food industry (upper right) is legally obliged to take preventive measures and to monitor its products and production systems to prevent contamination with FBPs. the health sector (lower right) treats patients and is usually the first to isolate and characterize outbreak-associated strains. pre-defined risk indicators are not detectable at a pre-defined limit of detection or in a pre-defined sample size. a pre-defined sample size is often applied, but a pre-defined LOD is usually not Required time from test to result Minutes or usually several hours, but may be justifiable with up to days/weeks in case of re-emerging contamination problem. culturing, PCRe or immuno-assay analyses Enrichment culturing, biochemical tests and PCR complemented with sequencing of genes PCR complemented with gene sequencing. HTS based amplicon sequencing of one to a few genes in some cases justifiable. de novo assembly to obtain a draft quality genome based on high quality, short-read (250 bp) sequence data from single, cultured isolates is complex, but can be (semi-)automated. analysis of re-sequencing data using a mapping strategy (Figures 2, 3) is less complex, and can be (semi-)automated. at least three different approaches for analysis of HTS sequence reads can be selected, but combinations are often preferred. assembly of sequences (e.g., reads) into contigs (consensus sequences) requires mapping. sets of contigs are often further assembled into scaffolds. K-mer analysis is a fast, alignment independent, statistical (probabilistic) approach to investigate properties of a sequenced genome. it is typically used to screen sequenced genomes to identify genomes of particular interest for more comprehensive analysis. long read sequences, up to several kbp, can be obtained using other platforms. the error rates are high (5\u201340%). all HTS technologies allow for assembly of good quality draft bacterial genomes with up to 100 contigs. RNA based shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics are often combined into a single approach \u201cRNAseq\u201d. the shared genomic region in all five has a conserved motif on the left side. the mean coverage per nucleotide of the targets will be: (B) R L/N G = 106 200 bp/6 108 bp = 1/3 where R = number of reads, L = read length, N = number of genomes and G = genome size. in this example, C is 6 105 times more sensitive than B. the main drawbacks of shotgun metagenomics are several logs higher (inferior) limit of detection (LOD; Figure 4) and complex data analyses (bioinformatics) that, at present, are difficult to automate/standardize. the composition of the sample's microbiota and/or the causative agent is typically not well known in advance. over the last decades traditional culture dependent methods have gradually been complemented with molecular analytical methods. concerns about the possible lack of necessary sensitivity, specificity or correspondence between molecular findings and presence or absence of viable, pathogenic microorganisms are among factors restraining this development. outbreak investigations have a strong focus on specific source tracking (red arrow) users, criteria and limitations on use of analytical methods for detection of foodborne pathogensa. food industry, quality control Public enforcement, legal/safety control Clinical outbreak investigation, source trackingb. price sensitive market testing costs per unit must be very low, but may be justifiable with high costs in case of re-emerging contamination problem. testing costs per unit can be moderate to very high Representative analytical approach Traditional culturing, biochemical tests and PCR complemented with sequencing of genes complemented with gene sequencing. high throughput sequencing HTS can generate thousands to millions of sequence reads, and up to several hundred billion base pairs (bp) of sequence information per sample. the number of high quality genomes for the most important food pathogens is already high and rapidly growing. the optimal HTS strategy is therefore purpose dependent. large sequence databases including thousands of completely sequenced genomes are now available. low error rate, long reads and high coverage facilitate sequence assembly. rare k-mers or k-mer frequencies can be used to estimate relationships between two sets of sequences (e.g., two shotgun metagenomes or a sequence isolate and a reference genome) at least three different approaches can be selected, but combinations are often preferred. Illumina sequencing is currently the dominant HTS technology. it provides very large data sets of relatively short reads (100\u2013300 bp) at an error rate per sequenced base of approximately 1%. the short read technologies generally provide significantly higher coverage than the long read technologies. for further distinction we use the term \u201cmetagenomics\u201d for whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-sample-DNA based metagenomics. sequenced fragments with shotgun metagenomics are random motifs from six different genomes. only one of the conserved (primer binding) motifs will exceptionally be included. difference in mean coverage per nucleotide is significant. shotgun metagenomics has a low bias, is independent of a priori knowledge of target sequences. RNAseq is biased by the reverse transcription used to synthesize cDNA prior to sequencing. RNAseq is otherwise comparable to shotgun metagenomics. the contribution of bacteriophages to bacterial genome size, evolution and virulence is very significant. the contribution of bacteriophages to bacterial genome size, evolution and virulence is very significant. current detection methods normally involve one or more enrichment steps, screening (e.g., by PCR), followed by an isolation step. contaminated food sources typically include poultry, eggs, swine and ready-to-eat foods, and affect people at all ages (EFSA, 2015b). the main food vehicles of STEC infections are bovine meat followed by vegetables and juice (EFSA, 2013, 2015b). for outbreak investigation the pathogen must be linked to the correct food product (source of infection) a combination of Roche 454 and Illumina data was used to generate a reference assembly from the strain with best quality data. the hybrid assembly resulted in 463 contigs with average size of 12,028 bp and served as a reference genome for the successive analysis. assays were used to follow the outbreak, including analysis of 106 additional isolates obtained from the outbreak. the data from each typing method did not overlap and were therefore inconclusive. the outbreak was caused by a strain differing in four SNPs from the hypervirulent O157:H7 ST11 clade 8. ates 16 isolates, 8 from humans, 8 from animals GS FLX (Roche) and GAIIx (Illumina) WGS of single isolates followed by de novo assembly. reference-based mapping and phylogenetic analysis combined with further assembly to functionally annotate the EGTs.

Denmark has implemented WGS typing of L. monocytogenes isolates from patients. two unexpected genetic clusters, as classified by MLST type, were identified through the WGS analysis during 2013\u20132015. both SNP-based approaches and cgMLST yield a high discriminatory power. lack of harmonization complicates the conclusive linking of clinical and food isolates. lack of harmonization complicates the conclusive linking of clinical and food isolates. 16S rDNA based classification of bacteria rarely extends beyond phylum, group or genus level. a few FBPs can be identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. only two of the Listeria species known so far are pathogenic. shotgun metagenomic approaches used for improved FBP detection have been tested in a few studies. bioinformatics methods to distinguish two genomes of the same species in a complex sample are needed. inevitably, an enrichment bias of the composition of the bacterial community relative to the original sample will emerge. data mapped to reference databases for identification of virulence markers. shotgun reads can also be assembled into larger contigs or genomes. if successful, the outbreak will be terminated. total outbreak metagenome was screened for sequence reads from healthy humans. 450 outbreak-specific EGTs were then subjected to taxonomic analysis. ten samples had more than 10 coverage of reads mapped to the reference genome of the specific outbreak strain. significant enrichment of paenibacillus sp. from uncultured to cultured samples suggested differences in the microbial community in the starting material of the samples. total number of shotgun reads ranged from 6.8 105 to 5.5 106 per sample. total number of reads ranged from 6.8 105 to 5.5 106 per sample. total number of shotgun reads ranged from 8.0 106 to 1.5 107 per sample Pathogen detection by reference-based mapping to virulence and serotype genes and SNPs. total number of reads ranged from 1.2 106 to 5.2 106 per sample. detection and quantification, and characterization of viral community RNAseq on MiSeq (300PE) From 1.2 106 (irrigated parsley), to 8.1 106 (negative control plants) reads per sample Assembly of reads followed by mapping to viral reference genomes for taxonomic classification. eobacteria dominated in cilantro samples before enrichment. the microbial composition had shifted to Gram-positive Firmicutes. low detection of Salmonella by metataxonomics was thought to be due to low sequencing depth. the consensus sequence after reference-based assembly covered the whole reference genome with only six gaps. but reliable detection to low levels like 10 CFU of STEC per 100 g of spinach required enrichment for at least 8 h. approximately 2.9% of the reads could be mapped to the reference genome with coverage of approximately 10. multiple samples often need to be analyzed after a minimum of enrichment. it would be cost-efficient if 1 coverage would be sufficient for most samples. better sample preparation and enrichment protocols could contribute. foodborne viruses are commonly shed in large amounts by a fecal route. food sources of infections are raw foods like fresh produce, soft berry fruits, herbs, shellfish, ready-to-eat products in general. most viruses that can infect through a foodborne route can also utilize a person-to-person infectious route. the most notable FBP viruses are norovirus (NoV), hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) which are all positive-sense, single-stranded, non-enveloped RNA viruses. the double-stranded RNA rotavirus (RV) are examples of other (zoonotic) RNA viruses suspected to be transmissible via food. the severity of HAV infection varies strongly with age. regions with high quality sanitation and water supply can experience outbreaks of hepatitis A unless broad scale vaccination has been performed. nearly 300,000 people were infected in a clam-related epidemic of HAV in 1988. RV primarily infects children, is the most common source of gastroenteritis among infants. an outbreak of foodborne gastroenteritis in 2012 caused by RV was probably associated with consumption of raw cabbage. small genome sizes of viruses may partly explain why the massive capacity of HTS is rarely used in viral FBP outbreak investigations. a similar approach could be applied to epidemiological monitoring and source identification in case of a foodborne outbreak. noV genotypes GI.3 and GI.4 were most prevalent. the same genotyping approach was applied to a study of the efficiency of removing NoV from shellfish by depuration. plants are commonly infected in the field by \u201cfield fungi\u201d. some produce toxic metabolites and may cause disease when plant derived products are consumed. other fungi infect a broad range of food and feed products during storage. invasive fungal infections are primarily a problem in immunocompromised people. the problem is perhaps under-investigated. there is only one example of the use of HTS to investigate a fungal FBP outbreak. a reference genome assembly was obtained from a strain of M. circinelloides isolated from human skin. the yogurt isolate was mapped to the reference genome for SNPs analysis. no clinical isolate from the outbreak was included in this study. the presence of a multitude of other taxa and the frequently low abundance of parasites or derived DNA in clinical fecal samples challenge the detectability and may prevent effective sampling and purification of DNA for detection of parasites. new databases are in development, collecting genomic information for various parasites. tims commonly reported to have ingested raw Paralichthys olivaceus filets for shotgun metagenomics and RNAseq. pathogenicity of this myxosporean confirmed in mice and house musk shrews. biosynthetic gene clusters in microorganisms are often toxic, and many of the microorganisms producing them are FBPs. direct shotgun metagenomics on DNA purified from microorganisms isolated without enrichment culturing is an attractive approach. direct shotgun metagenomics on toilet waste samples was used to identify bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes. the use of genomic data and large scale WGS has become important for epidemiology, evolution, surveillance and outbreak investigations. salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) causing many outbreaks and sporadic cases with severe or fatal outcome. contaminated food sources typically include poultry, eggs, swine and ready-to-eat foods. WGS will provide highly discriminatory data for subtyping of strains by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis or extended (core genome or whole genome) MLST (cgMLST, wgMLST) for strain comparison. a combination of Roche 454 and Illumina data was used to generate a reference assembly from the strain with best quality data. the hybrid assembly resulted in 463 contigs with average size of 12,028 bp and served as a reference genome for the successive analysis. based on the SNP results five subtypes of the outbreak strain were identified. sporadic cases HiSeq2500 (Illumina), 200PEc Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of single isolates followed by mapping to reference genome and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis UK, 2013 Jenkins et al., 2015 O157:H7 Isolates 29 isolates, 24 isolates from an outbreak, 5 unrelated cases MiSeq (Illumina), 150PE WGS of single isolates followed by de novo assembly and reference-based reference-based mapping and phylogenetic analysis combined with further assembly to functionally annotate the EGTs. results by comparison to previously sequenced genome of the outbreak strain Germany/Europe. serovar Enteritidis Isolates 55 isolates, 28 isolates from 7 outbreaks, 27 isolates from sporadic cases MiSeq, 250PE WGS of single isolates followed by mapping based SNP analysis. amplicon sequencing of VP1/P2B region of HAV followed by mapping to HAV reference genomes. a small outbreak RNAseq on MiSeq (120PE), approximately 1 106 reads Genotyping by mapping to rotavirus reference genomes Japan, 2008\u20132010 Kawai et al., 2012. mate-pair sequencing with a read length of 100 bp. a specific pathogenic agent may exhibit new and unexpected combinations of involved virulence genes for which current tests are not optimally designed. this was for example the case in the large STEC O104:H4 outbreak in Germany and other European countries in 2011. two clinical isolates with similar but distinct PFGE patterns were subjected to WGS to assess the genetic diversity of these isolates. the additional information obtained with WGS compared to PFGE indicated that not one, but three distinct, yet closely related strains were possibly involved in the outbreak. Octavia et al. (2015) used SNP analysis in an attempt to define whether an isolate was part of an outbreak or not. they modeled the mutation rate in S. typhimurium using 250 bp paired-end reads. they estimated a cutoff value for the intra-strain number of SNPs the bacteria could have. fewer than ten SNPs is often interpreted as evidence of an isogenic origin of bacterial isolates. an inferred phylogenetic relationship between nine isolates (A\u2013I; terminal nodes) is shown. Denmark has implemented WGS typing of L. monocytogenes isolates from patients and the food surveillance program. two unexpected genetic clusters were identified through the WGS analysis during 2013\u20132015 and further analyzed for SNP differences. alignment-free SNP analysis was used to differentiate between persistent and repeatedly reintroduced strains of L. monocytogenes in a longitudinal study of food-associated environments. the observed PFGE differences were caused by a single mobile element, suggesting persistent contamination. TEC O157:H7 outbreak were selected for WGS for comparison of isolates and source identification. a combination of Roche 454 and Illumina data was used to generate a reference assembly from the strain. the hybrid assembly resulted in 463 contigs with average size of 12,028 bp.

Octavia et al. (2015) used SNP analysis in an attempt to define whether an isolate was part of an outbreak or not. they modeled the mutation rate in S. typhimurium using 250 bp paired-end reads and estimated a cutoff value for the intra-strain number of SNPs the bacteria could have. fewer than ten SNPs is often interpreted as evidence of an isogenic origin of bacterial isolates. practice is currently not harmonized and also depends on the taxon in question. an inferred phylogenetic relationship between nine isolates is shown. if a = b = c = d = 6, g = h = i = 1, x = 1, and y = z = 3 then only isolates G\u2013I (max = 2) might be considered isogenic. a few countries and laboratories have implemented WGS as a routine typing tool for public health surveillance. WGS and alignment-free SNP analysis were used to differentiate between persistent and repeatedly reintroduced strains of L. monocytogenes in a longitudinal study of food-associated environments. patterns unique to single retailers or single states supported persistence or clonal spread. metagenomics approaches offer the opportunity to investigate the composition of microbes in food matrices in toto without selective isolation. detection of non-viable and \u201cviable but not cultivable\u201d microbes will be essential for meaningful strain typing. shotgun metagenomics of the entire DNA present in a sample offers a more comprehensive insight into the microbial diversity of a sample. it offers a more comprehensive insight into the microbial diversity of a sample with regard to the richness of microbial taxa. reference guided metagenome sequencing based approach for identification and characterization of outbreak associated strains. in case of an outbreak, fecal samples from patients are subjected to culturing. patients are also interviewed in order to try to identify food products that may be the source(s) of infection. a retrospective study of the german/European STEC outbreak in 2011 demonstrated that such an approach could be used to identify the infectious agent in human fecal samples. a set of 450 outbreak-specific EGTs were then subjected to taxonomic analysis and almost 65% were assigned to the Enterobacteriales. ten samples had more than 10 coverage of reads mapped to the reference genome of the specific outbreak strain. tomatoes have been implicated in salmonella outbreaks several times. but isolation of salmonella from tomatoes has only been successful a few times. 1.5 107 sequences of variable length (mean = 210 bp) included a total of 2.6 Gbp Taxonomic classification by reference-based analysis in MG-RAST. total number of shotgun reads ranged from 6.8 105 to 5.5 106 per sample. sample Taxonomic classification by reference-based analysis using Resphera Insight and subtyping of L. monocytogenes 16S rDNA fragments by mapping in PYNAST. pathogen detection and shotgun metagenome analyses with Genius bioinformatics software for identification to species, subspecies and strain level. total number of reads approximately 1.5 109 (approximately 2.3 to 3.4 107 reads per sample) Assembly of reads followed by mapping to viral reference genomes for taxonomic classification, including detection of putative human pathogens. b 151PE refers to the use of paired-end sequencing with a read length of 151 bp. c STEC aimed to characterize the microbiota in cilantro (coriander leaves) and simultaneously identify Salmonella from the samples. Spiked samples with known concentrations of a STEC O157:H7 were sequenced. enough coverage of the genome required spiking with at least 10,000 colony forming units (CFU) of STEC per 100 g of spinach followed by enrichment for 5 h to enable full pathogen characterization. genes were extracted from the metagenomic assemblies for whole genome phylogeny and SNP analysis. the number of mismatches from the SNP analysis was less than 20, i.e., at or close to the intra-strain SNP-variability level. reference guided metagenome sequencing based approach for identification and characterization of outbreak associated strains. in case of an outbreak, fecal samples from patients are subjected to culturing, in order to isolate the outbreak strain. omes of people affected by the outbreak and controls (people not affected) can be compared in case of a larger outbreak. a retrospective study of the german/European STEC O104:H4 outbreak in 2011 demonstrated that such an approach could be used to identify the infectious agent in human fecal samples. tomatoes have been implicated in salmonella outbreaks several times. but isolation of salmonella from tomatoes has only been successful a few times. characterization of the microbial community after pre-enrichment and enrichment Shotgun metagenomics, MiSeq (Illumina) 151PEb Raw data not described. pathogen detection by reference-based mapping to a database of Salmonella genomes. total number of shotgun reads ranged from 1.5 107 to 8.2 107 per sample Taxonomic classification by reference-based analysis using Resphera Insight. pathogen detection and shotgun metagenome analyses with Genius bioinformatics software for identification to species, subspecies and strain level. ar Leonard et al., 2016 VIRUSES Viral community Lettuce: 42 field grown samples and 54 retail samples Pathogen detection and quantification. characterization of viral community RNAseq and shotgun metagenome sequencing, complemented with 16S rDNA metataxonomics. b 151PE refers to the use of paired-end sequencing with a read length of 151 bp. c STEC, shiga-toxin producing E. coli. Jarvis et al. (2015) aimed to characterize the microbiota in cilantro. Leonard et al. (2015) applied shotgun metagenomics to detection of STEC in bagged spinach. spiked samples with known concentrations of a STEC O157:H7 were sequenced. enrichment for 23 h allowed full pathogen characterization by shotgun metagenomics. conserved chromosomal E. coli genes (2,542) were extracted from WGS data from the STEC strains used in the spiking experiment. the number of mismatches from the SNP analysis was less than 20, i.e., at or near the intra-strain SNP-variability level. bacteriophages can affect the virulence and population structure of microorganisms. foodborne viruses are commonly shed in large amounts by a fecal route. normal cooking or frying inactivates viruses. food and water associated transmission is also suspected to enhance the spread of zoonotic viruses. the viral FBP load is often low and heterogeneously dispersed in the food matrix while it is high in clinical patients. it is not trivial to distinguish between foodborne and person-to-person infections, unless initial cases are identified and analyzed. Detection and genotyping with PCR approaches, including metataxonomic HTS approaches, can therefore fail. Detailed understanding of virus stability, inactivation times and temperatures is lacking due to limitations in model systems. Chiapponi et al. (2014) analyzed two samples of frozen berries from two apparently unrelated HAV outbreaks in Italy. RNA was then extracted from the two samples and complete sub-genotype IA HAV genomes were obtained by a combined RNAseq and amplicon HTS strategy. studies of virus variants and quasispecies, analyses of vaccine escapes and drug resistance are now almost exclusively performed with HTS. the etiology of virus-associated outbreaks will often remain unknown, for various reasons. finding and characterizing the causative virus may not be included among the analytical objectives. 16S rDNA metataxonomic screening was used to verify absence of contaminating bacterial DNA. a small fraction ( 1%) of the reads was related to FBPs, including among others HEV and NoV. noV is the no. 1 cause of diarrheal disease and mortalities in the world. the severity of HAV infection varies strongly with age. regions with high quality sanitation and water supply can experience outbreaks unless broad scale vaccination has been performed. an outbreak of foodborne gastroenteritis in 2012 caused by RV was probably associated with consumption of raw sliced cabbage. no food was assessed for presence of pathogens. the study combined a broad spectrum of tests. small genome sizes of viruses may explain why the massive capacity of HTS is rarely used in viral FBP outbreak investigations. a similar approach could be applied to epidemiological monitoring and source identification in case of an outbreak. noV is the no. 1 cause of diarrheal disease and mortalities in the world. etiology is reviewed elsewhere (Moore et al., 2015). s in relation to FBD is almost exclusively metataxonomic, but usually limited to PCR amplification of one or a few genetic loci followed by Sanger sequencing. the relevance of fungi as FBPs is debated, significantly lower than that of bacteria and viruses. several fungi are opportunistic, infective FBPs. the problem is perhaps under-investigated. there is only one example of the use of HTS to investigate a fungal FBP outbreak. more than 200 consumers became ill, although no fatalities were recorded. the affected consumers were immunocompetent. an isolate obtained from a yogurt container was subjected to WGS. yogurt isolate was subjected to WGS in order to characterize its genetic potential to cause significant infections. reads from the yogurt isolate were mapped to the reference genome for SNPs analysis. no clinical isolate from the outbreak was included in this study. the presence of a multitude of other taxa and the frequently low abundance of parasites or derived DNA in clinical fecal samples challenge the detectability. the size of parasite genomes (10\u20131,000 Mbp) ranges from 10 the size of bacterial genomes and nearly the size of the human genome. more than 200 seafood poisoning cases of unknown etiology were reported in Japan from 2008 to 2010. spores and 18S rDNA from Kudoa septempunctata in the fish samples were observed. pathogenicity of this myxosporean confirmed in suckling mice and house musk shrews. the food and drug administration has identified the 22 most common pests contributing to the spread of FBD in the USA. four of these are rodents (mouse and rat species), while the remaining 18 are insects (cockroaches, ants and flies) the traditional approach to identify these is microscopy. direct shotgun metagenomics on DNA purified from microorganisms isolated without enrichment culturing is an attractive approach. the complexity of such urine samples may be comparable to that of some food matrixes. different taxa and life stages of potential pathogens require different treatments for detachment from substrates and complex structures, recovery and lysis. the purity and relative concentration of target isolated nucleic acids affect their detectability and certainly their quantifiability. specific challenges related to molecular analyses Ability to discriminate viable/infective agents from dead/non-infective agents is often important. transcriptomics or use of propidium monoazide prior to sequencing are options to discriminate living from dead cells. there is no harmonized requirement for detection and/or identification of an FBP by HTS. the combination of limited enrichment culturing and fast HTS with (semi-)automated bioinformatics is currently the most optimal, realistic option. for those FBPs that cannot be enriched by culturing, future pipeline developments may improve the situation. the global Microbial Identifier (GMI) was initiated in 2011 (GMI, 2011; Aarestrup et al., 2012). the background for this initiative was the high number of microbiological isolates that arecharacterized annually with very diverse and expensive typing systems. the likelihood that microbiological laboratories (primarily clinical) will have DNA sequencers available in the foreseeable future. in the quality control of products and production lines, the detection of a pathogen may, but not necessarily lead to withdrawal of the product. the decision will depend on the specific context, i.e., the specific combination of pathogen marker, how well characterized the pathogen is, the type of product and the intended use. legal requirements can direct the decision processes. the presence of E. coli itself is undesirable and un-tolerable background levels of E. coli should lead to rejection. so, we believe it is most critical to ensure that the POD for STEC (markers) is acceptable within the entire range of concentrations at tolerable background levels. the ideal HTS solution for the detection of FBPs should be rapid, accurate, operable, and economic. despite this, there are several obstacles to its full adaptation in the routine detection of FBPs. the application of HTS in FBP research and surveillance is impeded or slowed down by the complexity of different formats of diverse software tools. several integrative frameworks consisting of publicly available research software and specifically designed pipelines are available for visualizing, querying and downloading the data released. we believe it is essential that a corresponding user friendly web-based framework for FBPs detection using HTS is created. availability of reference genomes is expected to speed up diagnosis and shorten outbreaks, thus promoting public health. late availability of interpretable data can be a drawback of HTS, depending on the protocols used. the access to advanced analytical technologies is inversely distributed. this is a serious challenge that must be solved in order to ensure initiatives to build up global, collaborative networks and systems to cope with emerging FBPs are successful. the stability of nucleic acids is a critical parameter, and this topic is reviewed by Ceuppens et al. (2014). the stability of nucleic acids is a critical parameter, and this topic is reviewed by Ceuppens et al. POD calculations performed prior to analyses can be useful to assess the cost-efficiency of alternative approaches. direct sequencing of nucleic acids from a clinical or food derived sample can be faster than culture-dependent analytical approaches. use of these data sets is proposed to facilitate standardization and harmonization of bioinformatics pipelines. traditional approaches to standardization and validation cannot be directly applied to HTS approaches. there is for example no common cognition as to what is required for \u201cidentification\u201d of a FBP, such as number of organism-specific reads (positive calls), sequence depth (confidence), LOD. results interpretation HTS can generate a vast amount of data describing the microbial community of foods. the decision will depend on the specific context, i.e., the specific combination of pathogen marker, how well characterized the pathogen is, and the intended use. the presence of specific genetic markers in a bacterial isolate or in a sample can direct the acceptance or rejection of a particular product. the presence of the virulence genes stx1 or stx2 in ground beef can lead to rejection or at least to particular caution and further examination. growing evidence of the diverse functional roles that specific bacteria can take on in humans has forced us to acknowledge that beneficial and pathogenic may be two sides of the same organism. despite this, there are several obstacles to its full adaptation in the routine detection of FBPs. the ideal HTS solution for detection of FBPs should be rapid, accurate, operable, and economic. bioinformatics tools appear as an impenetrable barrier facing almost all scientists in either fields of food science and microbiology lacking or having weak bioinformatics background. the application of HTS in FBP research and surveillance is also impeded or slowed down by the complexity of different formats of diverse software tools. an accurate and complete reference database for each major FBP species or subspecies poses another challenge. genome sequencing is invaluable in advancing our understanding of virulence mechanisms and epidemiology of FBPs. availability of reference genomes is expected to speed up diagnosis and shorten outbreaks, thus promoting public health. third generation sequencing platforms can report sequences in real-time. this opens the possibility to selectively sequence only the nucleic acid of interest. this opens the possibility to selectively sequence only the nucleic acid of interest. the access to advanced analytical technologies isinversely distributed. costs associated with sample collection and preparation, nucleic acid extraction and purification, as well as any other steps in the preparation of sequencing libraries, sequencing, data management and downstream analyses must be considered. there will remain a substantial economic barrier preventing the full implementation of HTS in research and routine for FBP identification. we believe it is essential that a web-based framework for FBPs detection using HTS is created. a close and effective collaboration between different scientists from related fields is urgently needed. the availability of reference genomes is expected to speed up diagnosis and shorten outbreak outbreak. cost-efficiency of data generation is needed for more endemic FBPs. late availability of interpretable data can be a drawback of HTS. this is a serious challenge that must be solved in order to ensure that initiatives to build up global, collaborative networks and systems are successful. the reductionist tradition prevails in many laboratories, i.e., of testing analytically for single agents, in particular in the food sector. all authors (CS, AH, UD, GJ, WL, BS, and JS) critically revised the manuscript. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
