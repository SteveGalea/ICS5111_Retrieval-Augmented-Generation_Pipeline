{"summary": "AD causes epidermal thickness with cutaneous hypersensitivity associated with increased serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and infiltration of inflammatory cell types including mast cells and eosinophils. high serum IgE levels induce activation of mast cells and cause an allergic reaction. SR was reported to have antioxidative stress and antiaging activity via suppressing of nitric oxide production and activity of iNOS. SR blocked H2O2-induced ROS generation in vitro and MCAO-induced ischemic brain damage in vivo. dried SR pieces (50.0 g) were extracted using 390 mL 70% ethanol in a 40\u00b0C shaking incubator for 24 h. we obtained 9.5 g, giving us a yield of 19.1%. mice were observed every day for one week during quarantine and acclimation. olive oil mixture (3 : 1 vol/vol) was applied to challenge the dorsal skin (200 L) and both ears (20 L each) two times a week for 2 weeks. 1% DNCB solution was applied one day prior to sacrifice. oxylin and eosin (H&E) and toluidine blue detected epidermal thickness and inflammatory cells (i.e., eosinophils and mast cells) all samples were observed using an inverted microscope and data are representative of five observations. -HEX release assay -hexosaminidase (-HEX), a marker of mast cell degranulation, was quantified by spectrophotometric analysis of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy--D-glucosaminidase. for cell stimulation, BMMCs (5 105 cells/mL) were sensitized overnight with 100 ng/mL anti-dinitrophen preparation of ESR SOL roots were obtained from Yeongcheon Oriental Market (Yeongcheon, Korea) dried SR pieces (50.0 g) were extracted using 390 mL 70% ethanol in a 40\u00b0C shaking incubator for 24 h. rsal skin and both ears of BALB/c mice to induce AD-like symptoms and skin lesions. one day after complete dorsal hair removal, 200 L 1% DNCB dissolved in an acetone. 1% solution was applied one day prior to sacrifice. ear thickness was measured and recorded with a micrometer. a single investigator performed all measurements to minimize variation. all samples were observed using an inverted microscope. BMMCs (2 105 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates. after 24 h, ESR was added at concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 200 g/mL. plates were incubated for 24 h in a 5% CO2 incubator. the percentage of -HEX released into the supernatant was calculated using the following formula: [supernatant/(supernatant + pellet)] 100. 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (ver. 5.0 GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) Results are expressed as the mean standard error of the mean (SEM) and were evaluated using Student's t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA). the treatment of 100 and 200 mg/kg ESR suppressed eosinophil accumulation and reduced dorsal skin thickness in a dose-dependent manner. the treatment of 100 and 200 mg/kg ESR suppressed eosinophil accumulation and reduced dorsal skin thickness in a dose-dependent manner. ophils accumulations expressed as the average total count in five fields of 100 m2. p 0.05, p 0.001 versus control. effects of ESR on mast cell infiltration and serum IgE levels in AD mice. BMMCs were seeded into 96-well plates and treated with various concentrations of ESR for 24 h. the cells were incubated with different ESR concentrations (10, 50, 100, and 200 g/mL) for 18 h. in AD mice treated with 200 mg/kg ESR, scratching was inhibited strongly compared to the vehicle group. ESR significantly reduced DNCB-induced ear thickness in a dose-dependent manner. results suggest that ESR has a therapeutic effect that can reduce AD symptoms in mice. epidermal thickness in H&E stained sections was measured under a microscope. the number of eosinophils accumulations is expressed as the average total count in five fields of 100 m2. Mast cell infiltration in toluidine blue stained sections is expressed as the average total count in five fields of 100 m2. p 0.05, p 0.001 versus control. 3.5. Effects of ESR treatment on BMMC Cytotoxicity and mast cell degranulation. eosinophils act as immunoregulatory factors by secreting a variety of cytokines and chemokines attracting more eosinophils to the site of inflammation. eosinophils promote a switch from acute to chronic responses in AD. ziyuglycoside I and ziyuglycoside II are the major effective ingredients of triterpenoid saponins extracted from Sanguisorba officinalis L. thus, we used ziyuglycoside I as a phytochemical marker of SR in the experiment. we investigated the therapeutic effects of ESR in the treatment of AD using a DNCB-induced AD mouse model and BMMCs.
