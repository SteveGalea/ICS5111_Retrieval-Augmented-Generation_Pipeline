{"summary": "hypoglycemia may be the product of artifactual causes which may lead the clinician astray. physiological causes of hypoglycemia in the dog broadly divided by the presence or absence of an underlying disease resulting in hypoglycemia. orticism Decreased glucose production from lack of a counter-regulatory hormone (i.e., cortisol) Insulinoma Excess glucose utilization due to hypersecretion of insulin Islet cell hyperplasiaa Excess glucose utilization due to hypersecretion of insulin Extra-pancreatic tumors. in the clinically normal animal, the body maintains euglycemia primarily via equilibrium between the glucose-lowering hormone insulin and the glucose-elevating hormones glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and growth hormone (diabetogenic hormones or counter-regulatory hormones) (2). hepatic autoregulation, independent of counter-regulatory hormones, is vitally important in modulating blood hypoglycemia in dogs is defined by a blood glucose level of 3.3 mmol/L. hypoglycemia occurs when there is perturbation of glucose homeostasis. hypoglycemia occurs when there is perturbation of glucose homeostasis. clinicopathologic hypoglycemia is diagnosed by a blood glucose level of 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL), clinical signs do not typically manifest until the blood glucose concentration is 2.2 mmol/L to 2.8 mmol/L (40 mg/dL to 50 mg/dL) (1,8) the clinical signs may vary, are often non-specific, and can wax and wane. hypoglycemia is a frequent cause of apparent hypoglycemia in dogs. adrenergic activation attempts to counteract the declining blood glucose concentration (1,8). dogs with hypoglycemia may be presented with bradycardia, and clinical signs of circulatory collapse. hypoglycemia may be more marked if the dog has a hematocrit of > 55%. the other main contributor to artifactual hypoglycemia is the generation of pseudohypoglycemia from improper handling of samples. hypoglycemia is referred to as exertional hypoglycemia and colloquially as \u201chunting or working dog hypoglycemia\u201d (1). it is considered more common in this type of dog due to their natural behavior. the prevalence of hunting dog hypoglycemia is unknown. juvenile and toy breed hypoglycemia Neonatal dogs have a propensity for developing hypoglycemia due to several factors. they have limited glycogen reserves, decreased ability for hepatic gluconeogenesis, low body mass index leading to lack of lipolysis for an alternative fuel source, and immature counter-regulatory hormonal systems. these factors cause neonates to poorly cope with stressors such as inadequate or poor-quality food intake, fasting, dehydration, infection xylitol can cause hypoglycemia in dogs through a dose-dependent release of insulin. this insulin surge can lead to hypoglycemia because the amount of insulin released is 2.5 to 7 times greater than if an equal amount of glucose was administered. hypoglycemia occurs within 30 to 60 min of ingestion (29,30) the most common pathological causes of hypoglycemia in 55 dogs were insulinoma, extrapancreatic tumor, sepsis, hypoadrenocorticism and hepatic failure. the most common pathological causes of hypoglycemia in 55 dogs were: pituitary dwarfism, renal disease, fanconi-like syndrome. Insulinoma Insulinomas are functional beta cell tumors of the pancreas. they cause hypoglycemia via secretion of insulin independent of the normal suppressive effects of normoglycemia or hypoglycemia (36). if provocative testing is employed, diligent monitoring of blood glucose every hour should be undertaken to minimize the risk of an unobserved hypoglycemic crisis (37). a third diagnostic problem with insulinomas is that specific clinicopathologic testing for an insulinoma is not 100% sensitive or specific for an insulinoma. an insulin concentration above the upper limit of normal, or a normal insulin level in the upper half of the reference range, in the face of significant hypoglycemia is suggestive of an insulinoma (6). the most common tumors associated with hypoglycemia are hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoma, leiomyoma, and leiomyosarcoma (1,2,4,5) the most common tumors associated with hypoglycemia are hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoma, leiomyoma, and leiomyosarcoma. hypoglycemia is thought to ensue via mechanisms similar to those for bacterial sepsis. hypoglycemia is thought to ensue via mechanisms similar to those for bacterial sepsis. hypoadrenocorticism Dogs with primary hypoadrenocorticism are all deficient in cortisol, which diminishes hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases peripheral insulin sensitivity. hypoglycemia that is severe enough to cause neurologic manifestations is an uncommon presentation in hypoadrenocorticism. in hospitalized hypoglycemic patients, glucose is generally administered in the form of intravenous dextrose. this practice is derived from the incretin effect, in which oral glucose administration increases insulin secretion to a greater extent than does peripheral glucose infusion. if this action is unsuccessful, then maintenance of euglycemia can be achieved via administration of 2.5% to 5% dextrose (49) diluted into a balanced crystalloid solution and administered as a constant rate in in dogs with insulinomas or extrapancreatic tumors secreting insulin analogs, infusion of a rapid, large volume of dextrose can be counterproductive. this situation creates a vicious cycle of hyperglycemia and rebound hypoglycemia (1,6) a glucagon constant rate infusion can be considered as an alternative therapy. if unvaccinated, a dog with chronic or waxing gastrointestinal signs should always have hypoadrenocorticism considered as a cause for the hypoglycemia. a complete blood (cell) count, biochemistry, electrolytes, and urinalysis should be performed. if not already done, a complete blood (cell) count (including blood film review), biochemistry, electrolytes, and urinalysis should be performed. 5.2 nmol/L (> 2 g/dL) sufficiently excludes hypoadrenocorticism. therefore an ACTH-stimulation test is unnecessary (47). if there is still no diagnosis, this is the time when the clinician should consult a veterinary internal medicine or emergency and critical care specialist for further evaluation of the patient. beta blockers via suspected interference of counter-regulating mechanisms Pathological causes of hypoglycemia Severe hepatic disease such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, neoplasia, amyloidosis, hepatotoxins Decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis Congenital portosystemic shunt Decreased glucose production from lack of a counter-regulatory hormone (i.e., growth hormone or ad leukemia/polycythemia vera a Reported as a rare cause of hypoglycemia in humans. glucose homeostasis Glucose in the body is derived from 3 sources: intestinal absorption from the digestion of carbohydrates, ii) dissolution of glycogen (the storage form of glucose) via glycogenolysis predominantly in the liver but also in the muscle. insulin promotes production of triglyceride in adipose tissue and of protein and glycogen in skeletal muscle. glucagon, from pancreatic alpha cells, and epinephrine from the adrenal medulla, are the initial hormones that are released within minutes in response to hypoglycemia but have a short duration of action. hypoglycemia is defined by a blood glucose level of 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL) (1,4,6\u20138) hypoglycemia occurs when there is perturbation of glucose homeostasis in which glucose utilization exceeds glucose production and/or entry into circulation. acute hypoglycemia can lead to changes within the brain on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tantamount to an ischemic stroke (9); hypoglycemic dogs may concurrently have as their prevailing clinical signs. hypoglycemic dogs may have as their prevailing clinical signs, those referable to activation of the adrenergic nervous system. artifactual hypoglycemia is a frequent cause of apparent hypoglycemia in dogs. a human PBGM has a propensity to underestimate a dog\u2019s blood glucose concentration when compared to reference laboratory methods (14\u201318) prolonged fasting or starvation can theoretically lead to hypoglycemia. this is rarely a cause for significant hypoglycemia in the adult dog. this contrasts with adult humans, in whom fasting hypoglycemia is reported to be a frequent event (20) two studies did not document hypoglycemia in working dogs subjected to field training. however, a diagnosis of exclusion and other differentials for hypoglycemia should always be considered. hypoglycemia is secondary to hypoadrenocorticism. xylitol can cause hypoglycemia in dogs through a dose-dependent release of insulin. hypoglycemia ensues within 30 to 60 min of ingestion (29,30) xylitol may lead to liver disease, characterized by elevation of hepatocellular enzymes. erythritol, another common sugar substitute related to xylitol, does not cause toxicity in dogs (34). the most common pathological causes of hypoglycemia in the dog were sepsis, extrapancreatic neoplasia, insulinoma, hypoadrenocorticism and liver dysfunction (6,8) insulinomas are functional beta cell tumors of the pancreas, which cause hypoglycemia via secretion of insulin independent of the normal suppressive effects of normoglycemia or hypoglycemia. if provocative testing is employed, then diligent monitoring of blood glucose every hour should be undertaken to minimize the risk of an unobserved hypoglycemic crisis. it may be difficult to determine whether the hypoglycemia is the cause of the seizure, or whether the hypoglycemia is due to increased skeletal muscle utilization of glucose secondary to seizure activity. a repeat insulin assay may be performed in equivocal insulinoma cases. sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound in detecting an insulinoma varies from 28% to 75%. sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound in detecting an insulinoma varies from 28% to 75%. sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound in detecting an insulinoma varies from 28% to 75%. lycemia is postulated to be from a culmination of processes, including decreased caloric intake, hepatic dysfunction, and increased insulin-independent glucose consumption by bacteria, neutrophils, and peripheral tissues. hypoglycemia is thought to ensue via mechanisms similar to those for bacterial sepsis. hypoglycemia largely relies on hepatic glycogen storage, hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. hypoglycemia is usually relatively mild and an incidental finding (1). most dogs will have abnormalities in other functional hepatic indices such as prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (1,2,46) profound hypoglycemia in cases of hypoadrenocorticism may be due to concurrent sepsis from gastrointestinal ulceration and bacterial translocation (47). prolonged fasting or starvation can theoretically lead to hypoglycemia, but this is rarely a cause for significant hypoglycemia in the adult dog without concomitant disease affecting glucose homeostasis (1,2,4). the reason behind this interspecies difference is unclear. two studies did not document hypoglycemia in working dogs subjected to field training (23,24) hypoglycemia should be considered in dogs with an appropriate signalment and history. a case report in which a hunting dog had recurring seizures associated with exercise revealed that the dog\u2019s hypoglycemia was secondary to hypoadrenocorticism (25) ficiency contributes to dysregulation of gluconeogenesis during the fasted state. concurrent diseases such as sepsis and portosystemic shunt should be explored, especially if episodes of hypoglycemia persist into adulthood. the most common pathological causes of hypoglycemia in the dog are sepsis, extrapancreatic neoplasia, insulinoma, hypoadrenocorticism and liver dysfunction (6,8) the most common pathological causes of hypoglycemia in 55 dogs were: insulinoma (69%), extrapancreatic tumor (14%), sepsis (7%) and hypoadrenocorticism (6%) Insulinomas are functional beta cell tumors of the pancreas. they cause hypoglycemia via secretion of insulin independent of the normal suppressive effects of normoglycemia or hypoglycemia. if provocative testing is employed, then diligent monitoring of blood glucose every hour should be undertaken. it may be difficult to determine whether the hypoglycemia is the cause of the seizure, or whether the hypoglycemia is due to increased skeletal muscle utilization of glucose secondary to seizure activity. a third diagnostic problem with insulinomas is that specific clinicopathologic testing for an insulinoma is not 100% sensitive or specific for an insulinoma. sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound in detecting an insulinoma varies from 28% to 75% (37); therefore ultrasound has only a modest diagnostic yield for insulinomas. sensitivity of abdominal ultrasound in detecting an insulinoma varies from 28% to 75% (37); therefore ultrasound has only a modest diagnostic yield for insulinomas. sepsis from peritonitis was suspected to be responsible for hypoglycemia in 4/6 dogs (41) hypoglycemia secondary to sepsis is postulated to be from a culmination of processes, including decreased caloric intake, hepatic dysfunction, and increased insulin-independent glucose consumption by bacteria, neutrophils, and peripheral tissues. hypoglycemia is usually relatively mild and an incidental finding (1). most dogs will have abnormalities in other functional hepatic indices such as prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (1,2,46) causes of hepatic dysfunction include vascular anomalies such as a portosystemic shunt. profound hypoglycemia in cases of hypoadrenocorticism may be due to concurrent sepsis from gastrointestinal ulceration and bacterial translocation (47). protracted neuroglycopenia can lead to irreversible brain damage and neurological deficits that are refractory to treatment. a glucagon constant rate infusion can be considered as an alternative therapy. if dextrose fails to alleviate the hypoglycemia, then a glucagon constant rate infusion can be considered as an alternative therapy. the median bolus of glucagon was 50 ng/kg BW followed by a median maximum dose of a glucagon CRI of 15 ng/kg BW per minute (50). a diagnostic approach to hypoglycemia Once hypoglycemia is documented, is a repeatable finding, spurious causes for hypoglycemia have been excluded. in some cases, based on signalment, history, physical examination findings, and results of preliminary diagnostic tests, there will be if the insulin and glucose assay result is not consistent with an insulinoma, it is still appropriate to proceed with diagnostic imaging to evaluate the thorax and abdomen for an extra-pancreatic mass and metastasis. if at this stage, there are still no further clues as to the cause of the patient\u2019s hypoglycemia, fasting and postprandial bile acids, a urinary culture, a basal cortisol, and an ACTH-s"}
