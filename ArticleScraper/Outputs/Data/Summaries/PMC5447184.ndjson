{"summary": "healthcare-related MERS-CoV transmission is associated with high morbidity, extended use of mechanical ventilation and fatality rates of up to 65%. this type of transmission can be attributed to shortcomings in observing stringent infection control protocols. a study compared healthcare worker and family contact with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV patients. a review on the effects of Coronavirus infection in children concluded that Human Coronavirus infections may be associated with respiratory symptoms. the authors suggested that the clinical and genetic traits of Human Coronavirus infection among children should be monitored closely for early prevention. few cases have suggested a definitive link between exposure to contaminated dental unit waterlines and Legionella infection. infection control plays an equally important role in the practice of dentistry as do the understanding of oral manifestations and the diagnosis and management of viral infections. toys provided for pediatric patients may be a potential source of cross-infection. soft toys are more likely to be contaminated, difficult to disinfect and may re-contaminate quickly compared to hard-surfaced toys. personnel protective equipment such as gowns, hair covers, masks, gloves, shielded face masks and shoe covers should be used as appropriate. a higher level of respiratory protection should be considered, especially with aerosol-generating procedures."}
