{"summary": "RRV and chikungunya fever are causative agents of arthropod-borne illnesses. an average of 6,000 cases of RRVD endemic to Australia are reported annually. RRV is closely related to RRV, with the largest recorded outbreak of up to 6.5 million cases in India. the cellular and humoral arms of innate immunity serve as the first line of host defense against alphaviral invasion. despite the importance of the innate immune system in the defense against alphaviral invasion, increasing evidence of a pathogenic role for innate mediators has also surfaced over the past few years. the role of PTX3 in alphavirus-induced diseases has yet to be established. the role of PTX3 in alphavirus-induced diseases has yet to be established. PTX3 is highly induced in acute CHIKF and RRVD patients. PTX3 expression is elevated in CHIKF and RRVD patients. expression profile of PTX3 in PBMCs of (A) CHIKF patients (n = 20) or healthy controls (n = 9) were analyzed by qRT-PCR. RRV-infected and mock-infected mice were sacrificed at 2 (peak viremia phase), 5 (disease onset phase), 10 (peak disease phase) and 15 (recovery phase) days post infection. PTX3 expression is up-regulated following RRV infection in murine model. RRV-induced inflammation in quadriceps of WT mice was analyzed by IHC staining with anti-PTX3 antibody at 10 dpi. Arrows indicate abundance of inflammatory infiltrates. images were taken at 20 magnification. total leukocytes (CD45+) showed significant elevation of intracellular PTX3 after RRV infection. no induction of PTX3 was observed in NK cells (NK1.1+ CD3-), T cells (CD3+ CD19-) and B cells (CD3- CD19+) PTX3-/- mice showed faster disease recovery than WT mice. by 15 dpi regained full function of hindlimbs until 18 dpi. at 10 dpi, viral titres recovered from the ankle joints of RRV-infected PTX3-/- and WT mice were also lower than in RRV mice. no difference in viral load was detected between RRV-infected mice in the quadricep muscles. at 10 dpi, IFN-, TNF-, IL-6 and iNOS levels were significantly upregulated in RRV-infected mice compared to WT animals. PTX3 modulates expression kinetics of pro-inflammatory mediators during RRV infection. flow cytometry analysis of peritoneal lavages revealed significantly increased numbers of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in the peritoneal cavity of RRV-infected PTX3-/- mice compared to WT mice. this early influx of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes coincide with the chemotactic responses observed in the quadricep muscles of PTX3-/- mice. mice were infected subcutaneously with 104 PFU RRV. inflammatory monocytes and NK cells are the major cells recruited into muscles during localized inflammation. HEK 293T cells resulted in a significant increase in viral titres recovered from supernatants of RRV-infected cells compared to cells transfected with control vector. this data suggests a direct effect of PTX3 in enhancing RRV replication and viral entry. supernatants from PTX3-overexpressing HEK 293T cells were harvested at 20 h post transfection and incubated with untransfected HEK 293T cells.

PTX3 promotes viral entry and replication at the early stages of RRV infection (0 and 6 hpi) in host cells. RRV infection of HEK 293T cells demonstrated clear evidence of PTX3 colocalization with RRV in the cytoplasm during infection. PTX3 forms a complex with RRV and colocalizes in the cytoplasm during infection. a separate experiment was performed using another acute phase protein\u2014MBL. in the acute RRVD mouse model, elevated serum serum MBL-C was seen at both 2 and 15 dpi. a clear dose-dependent binding interaction between RRV and MBL-C was observed. enriched infectivity was observed in cells infected with PTX3-RRV complex at 6, 12 and 24 hpi. hek293T cells were infected with RRV (104 PFU RRV) and pre-bound PTX3-RRV complex (5 g/ml of human recombinant FL-, N-term- or C-term-PTX3 + 104 PFU RRV) for 24 hours. acute phase protein MBL binds to RRV but does not affect viral infectivity. 21-day-old mice were subcutaneously injected with 104 PFU of RRV or PBS (mock) mice were sacrificed at 2, 5, 10 and 15 dpi, and serum was collected for analysis of MBL-C expression. RRV was pre-incubated with full-length rhPTX3, N-terminal-rhPTX3 or C-terminal-rhPTX3. removal of the N-terminal led to a complete ablation of PTX3-enhanced infection. no difference in viral titre was observed in cells infected with RRV. the magnitude of PTX3 induction in CHIKF patients was dependent on viral load and disease severity. similar observations have been reported for the short pentraxin C-reactive protein (CRP) dual roles of PTX3 have been reported in several pathogen-induced inflammatory diseases. overexpression of PTX3 has protective effector function during bacterial infection with Aspergillus fumigatus [21,43], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [44] and uropathogenic Escherichia coli [45]. PTX3 expression has also been associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses and disease outcomes in intestinal ischemia-re a peritoneal exudate model showed increased recruitment of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in PTX3-/- mice during early stages of infection. this observation may be associated with early upregulation of CCL2 and MIF.

RRV and CHIKV infection of PTX3-expressing HEK 293T cells led to enhanced viral entry and replication. RRV and CHIKV infection of PTX3-expressing HEK 293T cells led to enhanced viral entry and replication during early RRV infection. PTX3-RRV interaction gives rise to pathogenic effect, enhancing viral entry and replication. PTX3 is a structurally complex multimeric protein, comprising a highly conserved C-terminal domain shared across all members of the pentraxin family. but removal of the C-terminal domain did affect the ability of the N-terminal domain of PTX3 to modulate viral replication, resulting in only partial enhancement of viral replication compared to full-length PTX3. newly identified role of PTX3 in alphaviral infection sheds light on poorly defined route of alphavirus entry into host cells. identification of such pathways will be an important step towards future development of therapeutic interventions. patients PBMC specimens of 20 patients classified into viral load (high viral load, HVL; n = 10 and low viral load, LVL; n = 10) and disease severity (severe illness; n = 10 and mild illness; n = 10) groups. severe illness defined as having a temperature of higher than 38.5\u00b0C, pulse rate more than 100 beats/min or platelet count less than 100 109 cells/L. oration of RRV T48 infectious plasmid clone was performed by incubating recombinant proteins on virus-coated microtitre plate for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. in vitro RRV or CHIKV infection HEK 293T cells and primary tail fibroblasts were plated at a density of 1.0 105 per well. qRT-PCR was performed using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. extracted total RNA (10 ng/L) was reverse-transcribed using an oligo (dT) primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase.
