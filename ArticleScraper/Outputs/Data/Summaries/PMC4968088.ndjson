{"summary": "antibody isolation directly from human B cells has advantages in harnessing rare antibodies with desirable functions. the first obstacle is the ability to maintain and screen the antibody-producing B cells. the second obstacle is the capacity to recover antibody genes from as few as one cell. the number of candidate B cell samples needed for gene recovery could be reduced. we developed a new platform that allows functional screenings of EBV-activated B cells seeded in non-clonal format. it can then be followed by in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) Fab expression to quickly identify functional heavy/light chain pairs. the first step is the initiation of gene recovery without achieving B cell immortalization or LDC to reduce the cell loss and save time. the second is the V gene matrix pairings through a novel IVTT platform to allow non-clonal B cell seeding. this step also adds c-Myc and Flag affinity tags to the LC and HC, respectively allowing Western blot or ELISA detections. the primers used for PCR amplification of V genes were designed based on the IMGT\u00ae database (www.imgt.org/).

HC/LC pairs recapitulating the parental well activities were identified in one step. both kappa and lambda chains were recovered from each well. identifying the functional VH and VL pair in 2 steps involving 14 IVTT reactions. it suggested that the B cell number/well should not exceed a limit if high recovery rate is preferred over throughput. the identified V genes were used to construct IgG1 expression vectors for all 4 new mAbs for further functional analysis. mAbs 1E18, 1N23, and 2H4 were tested in ELISAs against indicated HA antigens. one HA from a B isolate was included as a control. mAbs 1E18, 1N23, and 2H4 each belonged to a unique group of influenza A neutralizing antibodies. mAb 2H4 uses a VH subfamily Vh3\u201348*3 as compared to FI6, which is cross reactive to both group 1 and 2 isolates and uses Vh3\u201330.5 mAb 2H4 has significantly fewer somatic hypermutation (SHM) compared to FI6. mAb 1E18 has a 98Y, but a P52aG mutation instead of a P52aA. mAb 1N23 is a new affinity maturation branch. we created the germline predecessors of both mAbs 1E18 and 1N23. P52aA and P52aG both restored germline 1N23 binding effectively. this result necessitates the addition of a new affinity maturation sub-branch typified by the non-98Y usage. 1N23 HC with all kappa LCs recovered from the same sample well found that the Fab expression level varied significantly, but the functional pair was the highest. the dramatic differences in the fully assembled Fab level were not due to the expression levels of individual heavy and light chains. all the chains were expressed at comparable levels when measured by Western blot. heavy chain #5 preferred light chain #3 over light chains #1, 2, and 4. heavy chain #6 showed no bias as examined with a sandwich ELISA showing Fab assembly. light chain preference by heavy chain #5 was confirmed in the recombinant IgG format. the first step is the initiation of gene recovery without achieving B cell immortalization or LDC to reduce the cell loss and save time. the second is the V gene matrix pairings through an IVTT platform to allow non-clonal B cell seeding. V gene rescue efficiency of 80% or better was achieved consistently on sorted single memory B cells from various healthy donors. sequencing of randomly selected, rescued VH, VK, and V confirmed their uniqueness and diversities. the LC and HC, respectively, allowing Western blot or ELISA detections.

HC/LC pairs recapitulating the parental well activities were identified in one step. both kappa (red bar) and lambda (blue bar) Fabs were assembled in the IVTT and tested. wells #1\u20137 contain kappa functional clones and well #8 has lambda functional clone. mAbs 1E18 and 1N23 showed broad binding activity against group 1 HAs. mAbs 1E18 and 1N23 showed rapid on-rate and slow off-rate. mAb 2H4 had a slow on-rate and a fast off-rate leading to a very poor KD. mAbs 1E18, 1N23, and 2H4 each belonged to a unique group of influenza A neutralizing antibodies. mAbs 1E18, 1N23, and 2H4 each belonged to a unique group of influenza A neutralizing antibodies. 61 light chains belong to the family most preferred by Vh1\u201369. mAb 1N23 does not have 98Y in HCDR3. mAb 2H4 uses a VH subfamily Vh3\u201348*3 as compared to FI6, which is cross reactive to both group 1 and 2 isolates. mAb 1E18 has a 98Y, but a P52aG mutation instead of a P52aA. both mAbs 1E18 and 1N23 were capable of restoring the germline antibody binding to several HAs tested. for mAb 1E18, \u201cG\u201d was more effective than \u201cA\u201d. P52aA and P52aG restored germline 1N23 binding effectively. this result necessitates the addition of a new affinity maturation sub-branch typified by the non-98Y usage. the Fab expression level varied significantly, but the functional pair was the highest. the dramatic differences in the fully assembled Fab level were not due to the expression levels of individual heavy and light chains. all the chains were expressed at comparable levels when measured by Western blot using anti--. heavy chain #5 preferred light chain #3 over light chains #1, 2, and 4. heavy chain #6 showed no bias as examined with a sandwich ELISA showing Fab assembly. light chains were expressed transiently in 293F cells and their titers were estimated in an Octet instrument using protein A probes. TT platform is sensitive and accurate in identifying the functional pairings against a complex background with more than 10 B cells. this strategy theoretically allows the seeding of B cells in a non-clonal format, ideally with a density of 4\u201310 cells/well. the exact seeding densities can be determined according to the estimated hit rate and the sample size. mAb 2H4 recognizes the same highly conserved epitope in the HA2 stem region as antibodies from the above described successful campaigns. the repeated immunizations preceding B cell isolation by all the above described campaigns seem to support this hypothesis. mAb 1N23 was observed with higher frequencies in phage-derived 98Y antibodies. but a P52aG in a non-98Y background has never been reported. this dramatic shift away from a recently published model analyzing nearly 200 mAbs31 mostly from a single donor raises several important questions. the blocking and dilution buffer for all steps is PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween20) + 3% dry milk. the HA-specific B cell screening procedure is the same except that Nunc MaxiSorp 384-well plates were used for HA coating. 1.2 106 memory B cells were infected in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep (invitrogen, CA) and stimulated using TLR agonist CpG ODN2006. cells were seeded at 4 cells per well in 384-well plates with 10,000 irradiated CHO-muCD40L cells per well. IVTT was performed using the PURExpress kit from NEB (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) each reaction (25 l) contained 250 ng of total template DNA (HC+LC), 1 l of Disulfide Bond Enhancer (New England BioLabs) and 1 l of RNaseOut (40U/l, Invitrogen) all the assays were done at 200 l/well in ForteBio 10x kinetic buffer (part no. 18\u20131092) at 25\u00b0C. 0.3 g/ml of biotinylated-HA was loaded on the surface of streptavidin biosensors for 400 s. dissociation of the interaction was probed for 600 s. 60 TCID50 of virus was added to 3-fold serial dilutions of recombinant mAb IgGs in a 384-well plate containing 0.75 g/ml L-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) treated trypsin. after 1 hour incubation at 33\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 2 104 Madin-Darby canine Kidney the blood collection procedure has been approved by the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board. all ELISAs for donor screenings and subsequent analysis were performed as described. all secondary antibodies were prepared according to manufacturers' suggested dilutions. 1.2 106 memory B cells were isolated using a switched memory B cell isolation kit. CHO-muCD40Lcells were irradiated at 8000 rads in a irradiator. based on the IgG+kappa+ or IgG+lambda+ phenotypes into 96-well PCR plate containing 5 l/well lysis buffer from the SuperScript\u00ae III one-Step RT-PCR system. cells were collected from the selected wells into Eppendorf tubes, washed once with PBS, and pelleted. the fully assembled Fabs were detected by goat anti-LC antibodies (horseradish peroxidase (HPR)-conjugated goat anti-human kappa or anti-human lambda, SouthernBiotech) the plates were coated with antigens in the antigen binding ELISA. biotinylated-HA (H1, CA09) was captured onto streptavidin biosensors and coated with FI6v3 at a saturating concentration of 200 nM for 600 seconds. the epitopes of 1E18, 1N23, and 2H4 were probed in relation to FI6v3. the concentrations of mAbs required for a 50% reduction in viral replication were calculated using a non-linear fit algorithm curve fit in Graph Pad Prism. if neutralization curve was not complete, then value was assigned the highest concentration of inhibitor tested."}
