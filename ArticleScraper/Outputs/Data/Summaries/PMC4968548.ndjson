{"summary": "fecally-orally transmissible pathogens, such as viruses, protozoa, and helminthes, are parasitic organisms that cannot reproduce or grow outside their host. effective treatment of HEAM can generate safe soil conditioner or fertilizer products for land application. aqueous ammonia (NH3(aq)) is a major nitrogen source for bacteria, eukaryotic microbes, fungi, and plants. in its neutral dissolved form, aqueous ammonia (NH3(aq) is a major nitrogen source for bacteria, eukaryotic microbes, fungi, and plants. however, NH3(aq) may become harmful at elevated concentrations (13); it was found to have bio the mechanisms involved in the toxicity of NH3(aq) toward eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells are not fully understood. the mechanisms involved in the toxicity of NH3(aq) toward eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells are not fully understood. however, the biocidal processes involving NH3(aq) relevant to cells do not apply to viruses. a suite of viruses exposed to NH3(aq) in controlled laboratory solutions. we focused on naked viruses, which represent the majority of enteric viruses of interest. we put our observations in context of literature data to elucidate potential mechanisms of inactivation. virions were propagated by spiking 10 l of HAdV or CV (1010 to 1011 most probable number of cytopathogenic units [MPNCU] ml1) or 100 l of EV or ReoV (107 to 108 MPNCU). HAdV, EV/CV, and ReoV were propagated on A549 human lung carcinoma epithelial cells. ml1) into 160-cm2 flasks containing 95% confluent cells. flasks were incubated until cytopathic effects were apparent. coliphage GA was kindly provided by Joan Jofre (University of Barcelona) and was cultured in the same host as MS2. all phages were propagated and purified as described previously (44) except that E. coli B1 was grown in the absence of antibiotics. the specific composition of the buffers to attain a given NH3(aq) activity was determined with PHREEQC (version 2.18.00) (46) and a database using the Pitzer approach for calculating the ion activity. control experiments were conducted in high-ionic-strength PCa (PCaH), where the ionic strength was increased by adding sodium chloride. 1 ml of a virus solution containing 107 to 1010 PFU or MPNCU ml1 in VDB was added to airtight 116-ml glass serum flasks containing 14 ml of experimental buffer. a 1-ml sample was taken from each flask with a sterile syringe and filtered through a 0.22-m-pore-size filter (Millipore) for pH 11.5, 940 l of sample was amended with 60 l of HCl (0.1 N) for pH 12.0, 400 l of sample was mixed with 600 l HCl (0.01 N) data analysis. kobs is the first-order inactivation rate constant (day1) a concentrated stock of plasmid pBSK 22 (2,985 bp) was linearized with SpeI. a 50-l volume of 4 g liter1 plasmid solution was spiked into 10-ml serum flasks. electrophoresis was carried out with an Agilent DNA high-sensitivity kit. HAdV, EV/CV, and ReoV were propagated on a549 human lung carcinoma epithelial cells, buffalo green monkey kidney cells, and L929 mouse fibroblasts. both media were supplemented with penicillin (20 U ml1), streptomycin (20 g ml1) (Invitrogen), and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. 1 ml of sample containing 1010 to 1011 MPNCU ml1 of HAdV, 109 to 1010 MPNCU ml1 of CV, 107 to 108 MPNCU ml1 of EV, or 107 to 108 MPNCU ml1 of EV was collected and stored at 4\u00b0C as virus stocks. new stocks were produced before each set of experiments. all phages were propagated and purified as described previously (44), except that E. coli B1 was grown in the absence of antibiotics. the detection limit for all phages was 300 PFU ml1. q) activity was determined with PHREEQC (version 2.18.00) (46) and a database using the Pitzer approach. the exact buffer composition and resulting NH3(aq) for each experiment can be found in Table S1 in the supplemental material. a 1-ml sample was taken from each flask with a sterile syringe and filtered through a 0.22-m-pore-size filter (Millipore) each pH, T, and NH3(aq) condition was tested in duplicate flasks for all organisms. kobs is the first-order inactivation rate constant (day1) in the absence of NH3(aq) the data of all replicates were pooled, and the 95% confidence interval of kobs was calculated from the standard error of the slope of the pooled data. a 50-l volume of 4 g liter1 plasmid solution was spiked into 10-ml serum flasks containing VDB or AmCa (pH 9; NH3(aq), 40 mmol liter1) at 20\u00b0C. electrophoresis was carried out with an Agilent DNA high-sensitivity kit. differences in inactivation were observed in the presence of NH3(aq) however, noticeable differences in inactivation were observed between the different viruses, which seemed to be correlated with genome type. for ssRNA viruses, the presence of NH3(aq) led to a substantially faster inactivation, resulting in a 100- to 1,000-fold greater kobs than those of viruses with other genome types. the error bars depict the 95% confidence interval associated with kNH3 values. data points associated with the inactivation of X174 and T4 at pH 8.0 and temperatures of 20 and 35\u00b0C that were not significantly different from zero were omitted. differences in inactivation behavior were also observed within a single genome type. dsDNA viruses HAdV and T4 exhibited a higher kNH3 at pH 9 than at pH 8. kNH3 of EV increased when raising the pH from 8 to 9. this indicates that for these viruses, kNH3 was independent of pH. DNA viruses showed a greater increase in kobs (6- to 8-fold) than RNA viruses (2- to 4-fold) the absolute value of kobs remained low for DNA viruses at 35\u00b0C, between 0.1 and 1 day1. at pH 9 and 20\u00b0C, no significant increase in kobs could be observed with increasing NH3(aq), whereas a comparable increase in NH3(aq) did enhance the kobs. the effect of these two solution parameters on genomic material was investigated. inactivation rate constant in ammonia-free PCa is shown, along with that in solutions with NH3(aq) of approximately 20 and 40 mmol liter1. differences in inactivation were observed between the different viruses, which seemed to be correlated with genome type. for ssRNA viruses, the presence of NH3(aq) led to a substantially faster inactivation, resulting in a 100- to 1,000-fold greater kobs. kNH3(aq) affects ssRNA viruses more drastically than other viruses. it was still significant for HAdV under all conditions tested and for X174 and T4 at pH 9. at pH 8 and 20\u00b0C, additional data for f2 and poliovirus were determined. the effect of pH on kobs can be assessed by comparing the left and middle panels of Fig. 1. in the absence of NH3(aq), no relevant increase in the kobs of DNA viruses could be observed when raising the pH from 8 to 9. an increase in temperature from 20 to 35\u00b0C led to greater kobs and kNH3 for all viruses tested. DNA viruses showed a greater increase in kobs (6- to 8-fold) than RNA viruses (2- to 4-fold) however, the absolute value of kobs remained low for DNA viruses at 35\u00b0C, between 0.1 and 1 day1. cations, such as K+ or NH4+, implicated in promoting genome degradation. at pH 9 and 20\u00b0C, no significant increase in kobs could be observed with increasing NH3(aq), whereas a comparable increase in NH3(aq) did enhance the kobs. effect of NH3(aq) on genomic material was investigated. only few such degradation rates are published for viral genomes or proteins. despite this variation, the reported rates allowed us to establish a relative order of importance of the different degradation processes considered. dsDNA exposed to NH3(aq) under the same conditions did not lose its integrity over the time period studied. dsDNA exposed to NH3(aq) under the same conditions did not lose its integrity over the time period studied. ssRNA viruses are sensitive to changes in both pH and NH3(aq) this lower rate of genome degradation explains why DNA viruses are more resistant to inactivation by NH3(aq) than RNA viruses. the degradation of viral proteins under typical HEAM conditions has not been studied. however, reported peptide bond cleavage rates illustrate that this process is likely slower than ssRNA cleavage. differences in inactivation kinetics were not only observed between DNA and RNA viruses but also among RNA viruses. ssRNA forms higher-ordered structures through base pairing and tertiary interactions. ssRNA viruses are more likely to adopt in-line conformations. kNH3 increases so drastically compared to MS2, GA, and CV upon increasing the pH from 8 to 9 or upon raising the temperature from 20 to 35\u00b0C. monovalent cations, such as NH4+ or K+, have been postulated to enhance endonuclease activity exerted by the viral capsid, causing additional genome degradation. however, this process could be confirmed neither for MS2 (38) nor for EV. dsRNA ReoV exhibited higher resistance against NH3(aq) inactivation. similar trends were reported by others, including Ward and Ashley (19) and Makaya et al. (58), who also observed that ReoV was more resistant than other ssRNA viruses. a shift to more-alkaline conditions enhances RNA and peptide bond cleavage. but not the rate-limiting step of DNA cleavage, depurination. RNA and DNA virus inactivation should shift from genome- and genome-mediated inactivation to mostly protein-mediated inactivation under more-alkaline conditions. rotavirus inactivation at 57\u00b0C was linked to a disruption of protein-mediated steps of the early life cycle. virucidal mode of action of high temperature and pH may also involve a denaturation of the viral capsid proteins that allows for the release of the genome from the capsid. the heterogeneity in virus inactivation kinetics in HEAM is correlated with genome type in neutral to mildly alkaline conditions. however, inactivation is associated with a loss of protein structure and stability. for the subset of viruses studied herein, virus genome type is of less importance during alkaline stabilization or thermophilic digestion. phospholipids were cleaved at a rate of 1 102 day1 at 40\u00b0C and pH 9 (98), which is close to the RNA cleavage rate constant for similar conditions. phospholipids were cleaved at a rate of 1 102 day1 at 40\u00b0C and pH 9 (98), which is close to the RNA cleavage rate constant for similar conditions. phospholipids were cleaved at a rate of 1 concerns about fecal-oral transmission of viruses responsible for recent outbreaks may be partially quelled from the results of this study. the facts that they are ssRNA viruses and possess an envelope make them very sensitive to inactivation in human excreta during simple treatment, such as storage or mesophilic digestion. dsDNA exposed to NH3(aq) under the same conditions did not lose its integrity over the time period studied. ssRNA viruses are sensitive to changes in both pH and NH3(aq) ssRNA viruses are more resistant to inactivation by NH3(aq) than RNA viruses. this lower rate of genome degradation explains why DNA viruses are more resistant to inactivation by NH3(aq) than RNA viruses. differences in inactivation kinetics were not only observed between ssRNA and RNA viruses but also among RNA viruses. differences in inactivation kinetics were not only observed between DNA and RNA viruses but also among ssRNA viruses. the genome length of EV fails to explain why its sensitivity to NH3(aq) increases so drastically compared to MS2, GA, and CV upon increasing the pH from 8 to 9 or upon raising the temperature from 20 to 35\u00b0C. these strong increases in kNH3 imply that additional factors, possibly linked to specific capsid features, promote the virucidal action of NH3(aq) on EV. dsRNA ReoV exhibited higher resistance against NH3(aq) inactivation than ssRNA viruses. similar trends were reported by others, including Ward and Ashley (19) and Makaya et al. (58) inactivation kinetics of ssRNA and DNA viruses no longer exhibited major differences. differences in inactivation were rather low for MS2, reovirus, and hepatitis A. a shift to more-alkaline conditions enhances RNA and peptide bond cleavage. but not the rate-limiting step of DNA cleavage. feline calicivirus inactivation at 72\u00b0C was the capsid, and that inactivation occurred by conformational change of the viral proteins. virucidal mode of action may also involve a denaturation of the viral capsid proteins that allows for the release of the genome from the capsid. resistant viruses include phage (82) and X174 (this study) for high pH and parvovirus. salmonella phage 28B for high temperature (30, 83\u201386) the reasons for these resistant behaviors remain unknown. phospholipids were cleaved at a rate of 1 102 day1 at 40\u00b0C and pH 9 (98), which is close to the RNA cleavage rate constant for similar conditions. phospholipids were cleaved at a rate of 1 102 day1 at 40\u00b0C and pH 9 (98), which is close to the RNA cleavage rate constant for similar conditions. phospholipids were cleaved at a rate of 1 phage 6) were inactivated at higher rates than naked viruses (MS2 and dsDNA phage T3) in wastewater (100). in contrast, Emmoth et al. (17) did not observe a significant influence of the envelope among ssRNA virus inactivated in manure at 4 to 25\u00b0C."}
