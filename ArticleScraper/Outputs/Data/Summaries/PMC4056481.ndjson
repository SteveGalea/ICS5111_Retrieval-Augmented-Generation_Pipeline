{"summary": "human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common pathogen causing congenital infection and primary infection during pregnancy1. it can cause life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised patients and has been recognized as a risk factor for vascular diseases. HCMV can infect many different cell types in vivo, such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, epithelialcells, neuronal cells, monocyte/macrophage lineage cells and so on5\u20137. endothelial cells are natural sites of HCMV infection in vivo following a primary infection and are a viral reservoir, suggesting that endothelial cells may play a role in viral spread and persistence8. gene expression profiling of endothelial cells infected with HCMV has not yet been studied intensively. most studies aimed at human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) as target cell infected by HCMV have not been studied intensively. fluent cells were grown on chamber slides and infected with HCMV for 4 days. one batch of uninfected cells served as control, while other batches were infected with HCMV AD169 strain. PCR was performed in 50 l reaction mixtures, containing 0.5g of DNA template, 0.4m of each primer, 25 l of 2Premix and 18l of ddH 2O. anti-HCMV pp65 (US Biological, USA) washed twice with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. slides were visualized with fluorescent microscopy (Nikon TE-2000, US) on X-102 for 10 min at room temperature, followed by ice-cold solution (0.1SSC, 0.005% Triton X-102) for 5 min. the slides were then dried with nitrogen and stored in dark place. real-time qPCR was used to validate microarray. PCR reactions in a final volume of 10l reaction mixture contain 5l PCR mixture, 1l diluted cDNA and 0.5 M each primer specific primers for six genes selected from differentially expressing genes. mRNA F:-GACAACTGGCTTTGGCATGATTTA 41.66 64.37 174 R:-CCA ACATTGCTTTGCAGTC 52.38 64.96 LRRC28 NM_144598 Homo sapiens leucine rich repeat containing 28 (LRRC28), mRNA. mRNA F: -CTTCACCGTTACCAGAGAGATTCA 47.82 64.92 179 R:-CAGTTCCCAAGCC GCCCTCGTGAACACA 44 64.27 Analysis of HCMV infection process by Gene-Ontology and Gene Annotation.

VEGF gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. it encodes a protein that is often found as a disulfide linked homodimer. this protein is a glycosylated mitogen that acts on endothelial cells. HCMV may effectively use UL33 to orchestrate multiple signaling networks within infected cells. cytokines belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. cytokine encoded by TNFSF9 is a ligand for TNFRSF9/4-1BB. the binding of this protein to its receptors has been shown to trigger the activation of MAPK8/JNK, caspase 8 and caspase 3. the biological process, such as S phase of mitotic cell cycle, was significant in HCMV infection. DDX11 is a homolog of the yeast CHL1 gene. up-regulated genes may represent host responses to stress stimuli. down-regulation of other cellular transcripts may be partly attributed to the shutoff of host macromolecular synthesis in favor of viral replication. MAP2K2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2) can encode a protein. kinase is known to play a critical role in mitogen growth factor signal transduction. MICB gene encodes a heavily glycosylated protein which is a ligand for the NKG2D type II receptor. it is thought that MICA functions as a stress-induced antigen that is broadly recognized by intestinal epithelial gamma delta T cells. protein encoded by this gene contains conserved BH4, BH1 and BH2 domains. overexpression of this gene has been shown to suppress cell apoptosis. the mouse counterpart of this protein is found to interact with Apaf1."}
