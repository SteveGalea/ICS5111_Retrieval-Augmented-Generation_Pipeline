{"summary": "fire et al. discovered the phenomenon of RNAi using a long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which induced the sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNAs. short dsRNAs of 21 to 23 nucleotides (nt) in length are named small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) because RNAi works in a sequence-specific manner, strong gene suppression requires only a few siRNA molecules. polyethylene glycols (PEGs)-siRNA conjugate showed much greater stability against nuclease than nonmodified siRNAs [29]. polyethylene glycols (PEGs)-siRNA conjugate showed much greater enhancement of stability against nuclease than nonmodified siRNAs. trans-activator protein from human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and Penetratin from the homeodomain protein of Antennapaedia were covalently conjugated to siRNAs using a heterobifunctional cross-linker. these lipophilic siRNAs interacted with lipoprotein particles, lipoprotein receptors, and transmembrane proteins. these siRNAs exhibited RNAi activity without any transfection reagent, but only at high ( virus type-1 (HIV-1) Rev sequence consist of short amino acid sequences rich in leucine and the other aliphatic amino acids [44], at the 5\u2032-end of the sense strand. peptide-conjugated 21-nt and 27-nt ssRNAs were obtained in 33.0% and 22.9% overall yields, respectively. tab Synthesis of peptide-conjugated ssRNAs. size Target gene Conjugate HPLC retention time a (min) MALDI-TOF MS b Found/Calcd Yield c. 27-nt Peptide-siRNA was cleaved to a 21-nt siRNA after Dicer digestion. 21-nt siRNA (A), 27-nt siRNA (B), 21-nt Peptide-siRNA (C) and 27-nt Peptide-siRNA (D) were reacted with the recombinant Dicer enzyme. the 27-nt Peptide-siRNA was the most effective for gene silencing of the exogenous Renilla luciferase activity in HeLa cells. however, the 21-nt Peptide-siRNA showed lower RNAi potency compared with nonmodified siRNAs. modifying 21-nt siRNA with peptide may affect adversely the ability of the molecules to silence genes. escence at the 5\u2032-end of the antisense strand, exhibited bright fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. the results of flow cytometric analysis showed the same tendency as the microscope observations. the area of the histogram is separated into four populations (a\u2013d) along with the fluorescence intensity. siRNAs Populations of the HeLa cells (%) a b c d Non-treated 99.58 0.40 0.01 0.00 21-nt siRNA 16.44 60.36 21.89 0.00 21-nt Peptide-siRNA 7.35 36.57 55.00 0.31 27-nt siRNA 14.37 62.29 22.30 0.00 27-nt Peptide-siRNA 5.62 28.93 64.07 0.49 2.2. 27-nt Peptide-siRNA appeared to be cleaved to a 21-nt siRNA after reaction with Dicer. we predicted that the 27-nt Peptide-siRNA do not obstruct certain functions of RISC. however, 21-nt Peptide-siRNA could adversely affect RNAi\u2019s action. the 27-nt Peptide-siRNA has high cell membrane permeability. the 27-nt Peptide-siRNA, containing NES as a peptide, was accumulated in the cytoplasm. this cytoplasmic accumulation of Peptide-siRNAs is important for RNAi technology. peptide-conjugated siRNAs (Peptide-siRNAs) were analyzed by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) each corresponding band showed a different mobility in comparison with that of nonmodified 21-nt and 27-nt siRNAs. each corresponding band showed a different mobility in comparison with that of nonmodified 21-nt and 27-nt siRNAs. two different sizes of siRNAs (21-nt and 27-nt) were designed and targeted to exogenous Renilla luciferase. HIV-1 Rev NES peptide was covalently attached to the 21-nt and 27-nt siRNAs at the 5\u2032-end of the sense strand. luciferase reporter assays were among conventional approaches for RNAi. we compared the RNAi potency of 21-nt and 27-nt Peptide-siRNAs. the 27-nt Peptide-siRNA was the most effective for gene silencing of the exogenous Renilla luciferase activity in HeLa cells. cell membrane permeability of 21-nt and 27-nt Peptide-siRNAs was investigated in the presence of LF2000 using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. both 21-nt Peptide-siRNA and 27-nt Peptide-siRNA labeled with FAM showed bright fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. the results of flow cytometric analysis showed the same tendency as the microscope observations. nt and 27-nt Peptide-siRNAs (200 nM), including nonmodified siRNAs, labeled with FAM in presence of LF2000. logarithm of fluorescence intensity is shown on the horizontal axis. percentage of cell population separated into four parts (a\u2013d) along with fluorescence intensity. gated 21-nt and 27-nt ssRNAs were obtained in 33.0% and 22.9% overall yields, respectively, after HPLC purification. the 21-nt and 27-nt peptide-conjugated siRNAs (Peptide-siRNAs) were annealed with their antisense strands of 21-nt and 27-nt ssRNAs, respectively. two different sizes of siRNAs were designed and targeted to exogenous Renilla luciferase. HIV-1 Rev NES peptide was covalently attached to the 21-nt and 27-nt siRNAs at the 5\u2032-end of the sense strand. luciferase reporter assays were among conventional approaches for RNAi. we compared the RNAi potency of 21-nt and 27-nt Peptide-siRNAs. modifying 21-nt siRNA with peptide may affect the ability of the molecules to silence genes. the luminescence of Renilla luciferase activity was normalized by the luminescence of Firefly luciferase activity after 48 h incubation. the membrane permeability of 21-nt and 27-nt Peptide-siRNAs, including nonmodified siRNAs, was investigated in the presence of LF2000 using confocal microscopy. the peptides showed enhanced cell membrane permeability and cytoplasmic accumulation in culture cells. the peptides showed enhanced cell membrane permeability and cytoplasmic accumulation in culture cells. 21-nt Peptide-siRNA reduced RNAi efficacy in the presence of LF2000. peptide might interrupt incorporation of RISC into the siRNAs. cleavable linkages were used for the conjunction of siRNA and peptide. the 27-nt Peptide-siRNA appeared to be cleaved to a 21-nt siRNA after reaction with Dicer. we predicted that the 27-nt Peptide-siRNA do not obstruct certain functions of RISC. 21-nt Peptide-siRNA could adversely affect the mechanism underlying RNAi\u2019s action. 5\u2032-amino-modified ssRNAs were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA) the amino-modified ssRNAs (sense strand; 4 nmol) were reacted with 200 nmol EMCS linker (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 2 h at room temperature. the ssRNAs coupled with the EMCS linker were purified using a poly-Pak cartridge peptide conjugates were mixed with 1 U of recombinant Dicer. reaction products were electrophoresed on 20% PAGE (30 mA, 70 min) and visualized by silver staining. cells were cultured in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 \u00b0C. 0.02 g of psiCHECK-2 vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was first incubated with 0.2 L of LF2000 (Invitrogen) for 30 min. then 10 L of the mixture was added to each well containing 90 L fresh culture medium without antibiotics. 50 L of dual-Glo Stop and Glo reagent-2 (containing coelenterazine) was added to each well. RNAi efficacy of Peptide-siRNAs toward the Renilla luciferase was assessed as a percentage of the control (siRNAs nontreated) sample. ssRNAs were used to target the synthetic Renilla luciferase gene. ssRNAs were reacted with 200 nmol EMCS linker. the ssRNAs were purified using a poly-Pak cartridge. NES peptide of HIV-1 Rev with a cysteine residue at the C-terminal. coupling reaction of the peptide (40 nmol) and the EMCS-linked ssRNAs (4 nmol) were carried out in 20 mM triethylammoniumacetate (pH 8.0) for 12 h at room temperature (Scheme 1). the reaction products were electrophoresed on 20% PAGE (30 mA, 70 min) and visualized by silver staining. the signals of the reacted products were photographed by the LAS4000 imaging system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). 10 L of the pre-incubated mixture of Peptide-siRNAs and LF2000 was added to each well containing 90 L fresh culture medium. after another 8 h incubation, the culture medium was replaced with 100 L fresh medium. the cells were cultured for 48 h for assessment of RNAi. luciferase was assessed as a percentage of the control (siRNAs nontreated) sample. peptide conjugates, antisense 21-nt and 27-nt ssRNAs were labeled with 5\u2032-fluorescein phosphoramidite at the 5\u2032-end. 200 pmol of each 21-nt or 27-nt siRNAs, including Peptide-siRNAs, labeled with FAM was incubated the 27-nt Peptide-siRNA excels in all things, such as recognition by Dicer, cell membrane permeability, and RNAi efficacy. the 27-nt Peptide-siRNA has excellent properties as RNAi molecules."}
