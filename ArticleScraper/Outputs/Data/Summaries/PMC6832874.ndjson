{"summary": "the feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) [1,2,3], feline enteric coronavirus (FeCoV) [4,5] and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) [6] are the most important known viral causes of feline gastrointestinal disease. astrovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, and vesiviruses (feline calicivirus, FCV) have been sporadically detected in the stools of cats the aim of this review is to provide an update on novel enteric viruses that have most recently been identified in association with enteritis signs in cats. the aim of this review is to provide an update on novel enteric viruses that have been identified in association with enteritis signs in cats. the icosahedral capsid surrounds a 7.5\u20137.7 kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome covalently linked to Viral Protein g (VPg) at the 5\u2032 end and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end. the other NS proteins include the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; NS7), VPg (NS5), the putative NTPase/RNA noVs are classified into at least eight genogroups (GI to GVIII) and >40 genotypes. only GI, GII, GIV, and GVIII NoVs infect humans. in 2007, a novel NoV strain was detected in a stool sample from a 60-day-old mixed-breed pup with diarrhea and vomiting. in the complete VP1, the highest sequence match was found to the lion GIV.2 strain (81.13% nucleotide [nt] and 90.1% aa identities) the identity to human GIV.1 NoVs was 69.4%\u201368.2% aa (75.5%\u201374.0% nt) phylogenetic analysis based on 750-nt sequence of ORF1 spanning 750 nt at the COOH terminus of the polymerase complex. in the complete VP1 protein, the highest identities have been found to canine GVI NoVs. recombination is a powerful mechanism strongly influencing the evolution and epidemiology of human NoVs. a definitive characterization of the strains circulating in carnivores should rely on the sequence analysis of either RdRp region of the ORF2 gene. the RNA of GIV.2 NoVs was detected in 6/14 samples collected from kittens with enteritis housed in a shelter in new york state [11]. Interestingly, upon sequence analysis of the ORF2 gene, the six NoVs were identical to each other, suggesting the spread of a unique strain within the shelter. noVs were detected in animals with enteric signs with a prevalence rate of 6.2%. a specific RT-PCR strategy targeting the RdRp region has been developed based on the alignment of the cat and lion NoV sequences. however, a more detailed characterization should rely on the determination of larger genomic sequence spanning the RdRp region and the complete ORF2 gene [11] of feline NoVs.

ORF1 is translated as a large polyprotein which is co- and post-translationally cleaved by the virus-encoded protease (NS6) to release at least six mature non-struct noVs detected in animals have been classified as GII (pigs) [38], GIII (small and large domestic ruminants) [39,40], GIV (lion, dog, cat) [11,25,26], GV (mice) [42,43] and GVII [44]. first evidence on possible susceptibility of a member of the family Felidae to noV infections was documented in 2006. in the complete VP1, the highest sequence match was found to the lion GIV.2 strain (81.13% nucleotide [nt] and 90.1% aa identities), while the identity to human GIV.1 NoVs was 69.4%\u201368.2% aa (75.5%\u201374.0% nt). direct evidence on the circulation of NoVs in cats was obtained in 2012 in new york State. strains lion/Pistoia/387/06/ITA and cat/CU081210E/USA/2010 were classified as novel feline noVs. in the complete VP1 protein, the highest identities have been found to canine GVI NoVs. in the complete VP1 protein, the highest identities have been found to canine noVs. a definitive characterization of the strains circulating in carnivores should rely on the sequence analysis of either RdRp region of the ORF2 gene. the identification of the lion/Pistoia-387/06/IT in the lion cub [25] also represents the first report describing the possible association of these newly discovered NoVs with clinical signs characterized by severe hemorrhagic enteritis. noVs were detected in animals with enteric signs with a prevalence rate of 6.2%. experimental inoculation of specific pathogen-free cats with the feline GVI.1 strain JPN/2012/M49 could induce enteritis signs, diarrhea and vomiting. a more detailed characterization should rely on the determination of larger genomic sequence spanning the RdRp region and the complete ORF2 gene. the strategies mainly used to determine the sequence of 3.4-kb fragment of the noV genome (the 3\u2032 end of ORF1, the full-length ORF2, ORF3, and the noncoding region through the poly-A tail) baculovirus-expressed full-length VP1 of noVs is assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) morphologically and antigenically indistinguishable from wild-type NoVs. to date, only one seroprevalence investigation was performed in the cat population in Italy [50] by using an ELISA assay based on the VLPs of the genus Kobuvirus. s have been identified in domestic and wild carnivores including dogs [73,74], cats [13], red foxes [75], golden jackal, side-striped jackal, spotted hyena [76] and wolves [77]. genus Kobuvirus currently includes six officially recognized species. kobuvirus was first discovered in diarrheic cats in south Korea [13]. feline strains shared the highest identities with strains previously detected in dogs (82.1% nt and 92.1% aa identities) in rodents (79.9% nt and 89.4% aa) [68]. the P1 encoding the structural proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3, P2 encoding the NSPs 2A-2C and P3 encoding the NSPs 3A\u20133D. cleavage sites of the polyprotein all contain primary Q/G amino acid residues, except for E/G and Q/A between VP0/VP3 and 3A/3B, respectively, in the italian TE/52/13/ITA strain. three identical aa substitutions were present at the C-terminal of the VP1 protein of all FeKoV strains detected in china. the first evidence on the susceptibility of cats to kobuvirus infections was obtained in the UK [81] by a serological screening based on the prototype human AiV strain A846/88 [68]. all FeKoV positive samples were collected from cats with signs of enteritis. none of the healthy cats were found positive (0/46). prevalence in diarrheic and non-diarrheic samples are reported. the first identification of FeKoVs RNA was obtained by using the primers set 10f and 10r [91] targeting a 631 bp fragment of the 3D region highly conserved between bovine kobuvirus prototype strain U1 and human kobuvirus strain A846/88 [68]. RT-PCR strategy widely used to screen feline stool samples is performed by using generic kobuvirus primers (UNIV-kobu-F (Forward, 5\u2032- genus Kobuviruses are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses of approximately 27\u201330 nm in diameter. based on the genomic organization and sequence similarities, the genus currently includes six officially recognized species. the complete genome of six FeKoV strains (FK-13, 12D240, TE/52/13/ITA, WHJ-1, 16JZ0605, and 17CC0811) were characterized. the genome is polyadenylated, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 8.2 kb in length. it contains 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of 646\u2013717 nucleotides. cleavage sites of the polyprotein all contain primary Q/G amino acid residues, except for E/G and Q/A between VP0/VP3 and 3A/3B, respectively, in the Korean and Chinese strains. the different predicted cleavage sites for the six complete genome sequences available on GenBank. s (182, 235, 241 are the aa positions referred to the VP1 protein) were present at the C-terminal of the VP1 protein of all FeKoV strains detected in china. it has been hypothesized that VP1 could be employed as a molecular marker to acquire information on the geographical origin of the feline strains detected. the positive rate of cats from shelters appeared higher than that of cats from private veterinary clinics [87,90] the positive rate of cats from shelters appeared higher than that of cats from private veterinary clinics [87,90] kobuviruses are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses of 22\u201325 nm. kobuviruses are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses of 22\u201325 nm. kobuviruses are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses. stranded DNA genome of 4.5\u20135.5 kb encodes three or fpur proteins. non-structural (NS) 1, nucleoprotein (NP) 1, and viral protein (VP) 1 and VP2. FPV is currently classified within the species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (Protoparvovirus genus) the genus Bocaparvovirus is classified into twenty-three officially recognized species, with at least five species detected in domestic carnivores and designated Carnivore bocaparvovirus 1\u20135. a sixth species (Carnivore bocaparvovirus 6) includes boc. FBoV DNA was firstly identified by assessing fecal, nasal, urine, kidney, and blood samples collected from stray cats. a third strain (HK797U) was detected in one urine sample. newly discovered feline parvoviruses have been classified within a novel species named Carnivore bocaparvovirus 3. the pathogenicity of FBoV has not been experimentally assessed. it is not clear if this virus may play a role in enteric or extra-enteric diseases in cats. the pathogenicity of FBoV has not been experimentally assessed. FBoV2 DNA was identified in four of 48 rectal swabs collected from healthy cats and six of 53 (11.32%) animals with gastroenteritis. a significant association was observed between FBoV infection and clinical disease. in a second molecular study conducted in china, a significant association was observed between FBoV infection and diarrhea. primer sets targeting regions of FBoV and FBoV2 NS1 genes [12,16] and of FBoV3 VP1 gene [17] target References BoVs BoVF GCCAGCACNGGNAARACMAA 141 NS1 [12] BoVR CATNAGNCAYTCTCCCACCA FBoV FBoV1F TCTACAAGTGGGACATTGGA 133 NS1 [12] FBoV1R CAGA FPV is responsible for systemic infections characterized by severe panleukopenia and enteritis. intrauterine or perinatal infection could result in cerebellar hypoplasia with ataxia and intention tremor of kittens. several feline panleukopenia outbreaks in cats are not caused by classical FPV strains. newly discovered canine and feline protoparvoviruses could be considered members of a new species within the genus Protoparvovirus. the NS1 protein showed low aa identity compared to members of the species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1, while the closest relatives to CBuV were protoparvoviruses identified in human and non-human primates. virus was more common in nasal and oropharyngeal samples (10.2%) than in enteric specimens (2.2%) in cats with respiratory signs (16.4%, 29/176) than in asymptomatic animals (8.7%, 17/196). a preferential tropism for the respiratory tract for these viruses has been hypothesized. feline bocaparvoviruses (FBoVs) to date identified in domestic cats have been classified within the species Carnivore bocaparvovirus 3 [12], Carnivore bocaparvovirus 4 [16], and Carnivore bocaparvovirus 5 [17]. FBoV DNA was firstly identified by assessing fecal, nasal, urine, kidney, and blood samples. bocaparvoviruses infections have been identified as a possible cause of enteric, respiratory, reproductive/neonatal, and neurological disease. bocaparvoviruses infections have been identified as a possible cause of enteric, respiratory, reproductive/neonatal, and neurological disease. FBoV DNA was first identified in multiple tissues, specifically in 26 (7.2%) of 363 fecal samples, six (1.6%) of 364 urine samples, three (0.8%) of 361 blood samples, one (0.3%) of 364 nasal samples, and one (2.0%) of 51 kidney samples collected from a total of 364 stray cats in Hong Kong. no significant association was found between FBoV infection and clinical disease. a consensus primer set targeting a 141 bp fragment of the NS1 gene has been used for the first identification of FBoV DNA. a consensus primer set targeting a 141 bp fragment of the NS1 gene has been used for the first identification of FBoV DNA. species Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (genus Protoparvovirus) includes viruses such as FPV, canine parvovirus (CPV-2), mink enteritis virus (MEV) and raccoon parvovirus (RaPV). FPV is responsible of systemic infections characterized by severe panleukopenia and enteritis. the viruses displayed > 99.9% nt sequence identity to a novel canine parvovirus, designated canine bufavirus (CBuV) [141], firstly detected in a litter of five-month-old puppies during an Italian outbreak of canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) the closest relatives to CBuV were protoparvoviruses identified (47.2%\u201351.4% aa identity in NS1) in human and non-human primates. s are associated with any disease in cats is not yet known. other investigations in dogs, monkeys, shrews and sea otters suggest possible extraintestinal and systemic BuV infections. a preferential tropism for the respiratory tract for these viruses has been hypothesized. family Astroviridae are small, non-enveloped, spherical viruses of approximately 28\u201330 nm in diameter. a positive single-stranded RNA genome of 6.8\u20137.3 kb in length is organized in three ORFs (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2) and a poly A tail at the 3\u2032 end. astVs are currently considered as one of the most common viruses associated with either mild or severe gastroenteriti the role of AstV as enteric pathogen in cats remains unclear. experimental infection using the FAstV strain Bristol [153] in specific pathogen\u2013free kittens induced enteritis and viral shedding. rotaviruses (RVs) have been recognized as a major cause of human acute gastroenteritis since 1973. early epidemiological studies on rotavirus infection in cats have been conducted by serological assay and EM analysis. FRVs RNA has been detected with an overall prevalence of 3.0% (57/1727); statistical associations with diarrhea or age have not been found. the susceptibility of carnivores to circoviruses infections has been previously demonstrated in domestic and wild canids. in dogs, these viruses have been found in association with clinical disease characterized by hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, severe necrotizing vasculitis, and granulomatous lymphadenitis. the feline PyVs revealed the highest identity (97.0%) to members of the genus Alphapolyomavirus. the etiologic role of LIPyV in feline diarrhea should be investigated as well as its zoonotic potential. a few aa mutations in the VP2 can modify the host range of FPV and CPV-2. the novel carnivore protoparvovirus 2 has recently crossed the species barrier from a yet unidentified source. the global distribution of cats and their close contacts with humans represents an additional reason to better understand the composition of their enteric virome [16]. more recently, the RNA of a 2117-like VeV was detected in the feces of a clinically healthy cat [190]. understanding the ecology of novel enteric viruses in cats will be helpful also to assess if and to which extent pets may pose a risk of infection for humans."}
