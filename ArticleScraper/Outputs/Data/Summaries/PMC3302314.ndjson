{"summary": "recognition of evolutionarily conserved microbial structures is an essential function of the innate immune system. these PAMPs are molecular structures, such as glycoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, proteoglycans, and nucleic acid motifs. genes encode proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, type I interferons and antimicrobial proteins. toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the most extensively studied family of PRRs so far. they are of substantial importance in the initiation of an antiviral response upon infection. retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are cytosolic sensors of viral RNA species. the C-terminal region shows similarity to the intracellular domain of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) this region is referred to as the toll/IL-1R homology (TIR) domain, which mediates downstream signaling events upon activation of the receptor (1, 12). Upon extracellular ligand recognition, TLR dimerization is thought to be induced, bringing together the cytoplasmic TIR domains and then recruiting adaptor molecules. RNA 55 TLR8 Human immunodeficiency virus ssRNA 21, 54 TLR3 Reoviridae dsRNA 62, 129 Respiratory syncytial virus dsRNA 62, 129 West Nile virus dsRNA 17, 62, 129 Coxsackievirus B3 dsRNA 88 Poliovirus dsRNA 91 Influenza A virus dsRNA 34 Punta Toro virus dsRNA 33 TLR2 in unstimulated cells, TLR7 is localized to the ER and rapidly traffics to the endosome in a process that depends on UNC93B1 and gp96. delivery of ssRNA to TLR7 depends on endocytosis of extracellular viral particles and on the cellular process of autophagy. paramyxoviruses effectively circumvent detection by TLR7 in the endosomes of pDCs. TLR8 is preferentially expressed in myeloid DCs and monocytes (21, 38, 54) a common feature of all TLR recognition is the activation of three major signaling pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), one or more interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and nuclear factor kappa\u2013light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) IKK is phosphorylated by the activated TAK1 associated with the TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1), TAB2 and TAB3. this leads to the IKK-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IB. NF-B, formerly sequestered in the cytosol, is now free to enter the nucleus to induce gene expression. IRF5 and IRF7 interact with the complex of IRAKs and TRAF6. this leads to IRAK1-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of both molecules (118, 122) this mediator is also essential for in vivo resistance to infection with VSV and herpes simplex virus (HSV) RNA virus invasion upregulates type I IFN expression via TLR7 and TLR8. this enhanced IFN expression induces TLR3 gene transcription in many cell types. this dependence is not related to the trafficking of TLR3 from the ER to the endosome as is seen for TLR7 and -8 signaling. IRF3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-4) in a positive feedback system, these type I IFNs, among many other effects, upregulate the level of IRF7 expression in responding cells. west Nile virus (WNV; ssRNA virus), poliovirus (PV; ssRNA virus), IAV, and a phlebovirus (Punta Toro virus [PTV]; ssRNA virus) some studies suggest that the cytokine expression induced by TLR3 (particularly IL-6) may have a detrimental rather than a protective effect on the host. toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been found to participate in antiviral defense to RNA viruses in human cells by recognizing the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (70) and the induction of cytokines in response to coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) depends on TLR4 (121). Upon activation and dimerization of TLR4, two adaptors are known to be recruited to the TIR domains of the TLR2/TLR1 or T TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) is unique to the TLR4 signaling pathway and recruits TRIF. TLR7 senses ssRNA oligonucleotides containing guanosine- and uridine-rich sequences from RNA viruses. pDCs comprise a subset of dendritic cells with plasmacytoid morphology. TLR7 is known to recognize influenza A virus (IAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Dengue virus, Sendai virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) a common feature of all TLR recognition is the activation of three major signaling pathways. RF7 are essential for induction of type I IFNs. the MAPKs activate activator protein 1 (AP-1, a heterodimer of activating transcription factor 2 with c-JUN), which together with NF-B induce the expression of genes required for inflammation and adaptive immune activation. NF-B, formerly sequestered in the cytosol, is now free to enter the nucleus to induce gene expression. AP-1 enters the nucleus and together, NF-B and AP-1 induce the expression of proinflammatory genes (1). mice deficient in the expression of IRF7 in hematopoietic cells fail to produce significant amounts of IFN- systemically. the constitutively high expression of IRF7, required for complex formation, is a unique feature of the pDCs and is not seen for other cells. downstream signaling from TLR3 occurs in much the same way as TLR7 and -8 signaling. this brings together the TIR domains of TLR3s and causes the recruitment of adaptor protein inducing IFN- (TRIF) TRIF recruits TRAF6 for activation and translocation of NF-B and AP-1. type I IFN release stimulates the expression of TLR3 in cells that were initially TLR3 negative. this adds to the positive feedback loop, enhancing the capacity to provide the antiviral response. TLR3 activation in CD8+ DCs enhances the efficiency of cross-presentation of peptide fragments from apoptotic bodies. TLR2 is expressed in particular on the cell surface of most immune cells (85, 119) it is believed that TLR2 forms a heterodimer with coreceptors TLR1 or TLR6 and recognizes virion components. TLR2 has also been associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced inflammation via detection of HCV core and nonstructural 3 (NS3) proteins (15, 22) TIRAP/Mal binds MyD88 to initiate the same signaling pathway as that outlined previously for TLR7 and TLR8, culminating in a proinflammatory cytokines response through NF-B (127) TLR2 activation may also exert some effect on the expression of type I IFNs (8). retinoic acid-inducible gene I product (RIG-I) contains an ssRNA/dsRNA (ss/dsRNA)-binding C-terminal domain (CTD) which, when unbound, functions as a repressor domain (RD) (103) Upon binding to viral RNA structures produced during viral replication, two repeats of a cysteine-aspartic protease (caspase)-recruiting domain (C dsRNA and 5\u2032-triphosphate ssRNA (60) differ from self-ssRNA, such as mRNA and tRNA. self-mRNA is inevitably capped posttranscriptionally with a 5\u2032-7-methylguanosine cap. the 2\u2032-O methylation is suggested to be introduced solely to distinguish self- from nonself. the recognition of a filovirus is antagonized by the Ebola virus V35 protein. this secreted protein binds the dsRNA ligand preventing activation of RIG-I-mediated signaling. gue virus ss/dsRNA 75 Rotavirus ss/dsRNA 109 MDA5 Encephalomyocarditis virus dsRNA 31, 60 Theiler's virus dsRNA 60 Rabies virus dsRNA 23 West Nile virus dsRNA 27 Sendai virus dsRNA 32 Sendai virus dsRNA 32 Sendai virus dsRNA 32 Sendai virus dsRNA 32 Sendai virus ds the LGP2 gene lacks the region encoding CARD in RIG-I and MDA5. studies with mice show increased responses to VSV in LGP2-deficient cells. xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV, a retrovirus) is seen in humans homozygotic for a variant of RNase L with reduced activity (123) dsRNA activates 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) to increase the concentration of 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligoadenylate (2-5A) from cytosolic ATP, and this activates RNase L (113 IPS-1-deficient mice are impaired in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFN in response to all RNA viruses recognized by RIG-I and MDA5. IPS-1 itself is probably not directly involved in the signaling process but serves as a platform to orchestrate the molecular interactions which lead to the activation of IRF3 and NF-B (136). IRF7 gene expression may be induced in cell types not constitutively expressing the IRF7 gene. IPS-1 serves as a platform to coordinate the activation of two signaling pathways also used by the TLRs. the RING finger protein, Riplet, and the tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) are in activating RIG-I through K63 ubiquitin ligation. the modifications imparted by TRIM25 are crucial to the interaction between RIG-I and IPS-1 (29, 30, 90) two repeats of a cysteine-aspartic protease (caspase)-recruiting domain (CARD)-like region at the N terminus are exposed. the middle portion of the RIG-I protein contains the dexD/H helicase domain with an ATP-binding motif. the RD specifically recognizes virus-associated RNA species, including dsRNA and 5\u2032-triphosphate ssRNA (60) IPS-1 is located at the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane. IPS-1 is located at the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane. this mitochondrial association is necessary for initiating further signaling events. sa virus ss/dsRNA 35 Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ss/dsRNA 140 Rift Valley fever virus ss/dsRNA 60 Hepatitis C virus ss/dsRNA 103, 115 West Nile virus ss/dsRNA 27 Rotavirus ss/dsRNA 109 MDA5 Encephalomyocarditis virus dsRNA 31, 60 Theiler' ies virus, dengue virus, and rotavirus (23, 27, 75, 109) are also responsible for the recognition of murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus) and murine norovirus 1 (a calicivirus) dsRNA activates 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) to increase the concentration of 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligoadenylate (2-5A) from cytosolic ATP, and this activates RNase L (113). it is known that RNase L-deficient mice are compromised in their response to infection with EMCV, WNV, and CVB4. IPS-1-deficient mice are impaired in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFN in response to all RNA viruses recognized by RIG-I and MDA5. IPS-1 itself is probably not directly involved in the signaling process but serves as a platform to orchestrate the molecular interactions which lead to the activation of IRF3 and NF-B. the IPS-1/TRADD complex recruits RIP1 (in a complex with the Fas-associated death domain [FADD]) for the initiation of the NF-B pathway. IPS-1 serves as a platform to coordinate the activation of two signaling pathways also used by the TLRs. LR signaling is modified by ubiquitination, direct protein interactions, and caspase activity in an elaborate network of both positive and negative regulation. the RING finger protein, Riplet, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase, tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) are in activating RIG-I through K63 ubiquitin ligation. pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) contains a pyrin domain (PYD) which can interact with the N-terminal PYD of a. a pyrin domain (PYD) can interact with the N-terminal PYD of a. NLRP3 oligomerizes upon activation and recruits ASC and procaspase-1 to form an inflammasome complex. this activates caspase-1, which subsequently mediates the conversion of pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 to fully functional IL-1 and IL-18. NLRP3 is most likely an indirect sensor of viral invasion (5). NLRC2 interaction with IPS-1 does not involve CARD-CARD binding (102) NLRC5 is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells. NLRC5 is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and is further induced in many cell types.

NLRC5 is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and is further induced in many cell types following viral invasion. autophagy is used to bring cytosolic RNA species to the endosome compartment. the role of the innate antiviral response in protecting the host during the early phase of a viral infection has been known for a long time."}
