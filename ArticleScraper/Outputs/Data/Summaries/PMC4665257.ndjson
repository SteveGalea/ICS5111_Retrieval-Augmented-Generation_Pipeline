{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses remodel cellular membranes for different stages of infection process, such as protein translation and processing, viral RNA (vRNA) synthesis, particle assembly, and virus transmission. studies showed distinct membrane structures could be simultaneously generated in one cell that was infected with animal (+) RNA viruses. spherule-like structures are similar to those induced by some animal (+) RNA viruses for vRNA synthesis. they are all formed by membrane invagination of the outer organelle membrane. other types of plant (+) RNA virus-induced membrane structures are ER-derived vesicles. 6K2-induced vesicles contain vRNA and several replication-related viral and host proteins. they are motile (19), traffic through the secretory pathway, and use myosin motors (22) for a new round of infection. they are also involved in long-distance virus movement, as they are present in phloem sieve elements and xylem vessels (24). electron tomography showed that the vesicle-like structures were tubules. TuMV particles were observed to accumulate in the central vacuole as membrane-associated linear arrays. the infectious clone pCambiaTuMV/6K2:GFP:HA was constructed as follows. pCambia/6K2:GFP:HA fragment was then used to replace the 6K2:GFP fragment of pCambia/6K2:GFP:HA. the resulting construct was pCambiaTuMV/6K2:GFP:HA. the plasmid was then cut with SmaI and KpnI. agroinfiltration was performed with 4-week-old plants at 22\u00b0C during the day and 20\u00b0C at night. the midrib area of N. benthamiana leaves systemically infected with TuMV/6K2:GFP was cut and fixed in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde plus 0.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde at different days postinfection (dpi) for more than 24 h. the samples were postfixed in 1% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide with 1.5% (wt/vol) potassium ferrocyanide in sodium cacodylate buffer for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. after rinsing 3 times for 10 min each time, the samples were dehydrated in a graded acetone series (30, 50, 70, 80, 90, and 100%) for 20 min at each step at RT. the samples were postfixed in 0.1% (wt/vol) reduced osmium tetroxide for 15 min at 4\u00b0C (29) the samples were then rinsed in water at RT (3 times for 10 min each time) and dehydrated in a graded alcohol series (30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%) for 20 min at each step at 4\u00b0C on a rotator. sections of 90 to 100 nm were incubated in 20 m s were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in DPBS-BCO. grids were stained with 4% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate for 5 min and Reynolds lead citrate for 3 min. background labeling was determined using mock-infected and TuMV-infected sections. a series of single-axis-tilt images was collected with a Tecnai G2 F20 cryo-S/TEM (FEI) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. a series of single-axis-tilt images was collected with a Tecnai G2 F20 cryo-S/TEM. images were captured over a tilt range of 4\u00b0 (1\u00b0 increments) on the 90-nm-thick section. resulting images had a pixel size of 0.5 nm. images from the tilt series were aligned and reconstructed into a series of tomographic slices using the IMOD software package. a tomogram generated on a 200-nm-thick section in the perinuclear region of a TuMV-infected vascular parenchymal cell at 7 dpi. a higher-magnification image of the area in panel A is shown. the 3-D model (middle and right) shows an SMT with fibrillar material inside and with an adjacent intermediate tubular structure. four-week-old plants were agroinfiltrated with the infectious clone TuMV/6K2:GFP or the mock-infected empty vector, pCambia 0390. leaves were sliced into 1-mm strips using a razor blade. a vacuum was applied for 20 min to remove the air within the leaf tissues. plasmid pCambiaTuMV/6K2:GFP:GFP:HA was amplified by PCR from pGreen/PABP:GFP. pCambia/6K2:GFP:GFP:hemagglutinin (HA)-coding region was amplified by PCR from pGreen/PABP:GFP. the resulting construct was named pCambia/6K2:GFP:HA. pCambia/6K2:GFP:HA was digested with SacII. plasmid was then cut with SmaI and KpnI and ligated in pCambiaTunos. empty vector pCambia 0390 were electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1. the pellet of an overnight culture was resuspended in water supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 and 150 M acetosyringone. the solution was then diluted to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.3. small pieces of mock- and TuMV-infected leaf midrib were cut and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 24 h at 4\u00b0C. the samples were postfixed in 1% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide with 1.5% (wt/vol) potassium ferrocyanide in sodium cacodylate buffer for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. after rins large pieces of mock- and TuMV-infected leaf midrib were cut and fixed in 4% (wt/vol) formaldehyde and 0.25% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Sorensen's phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. the samples were then rinsed 3 times for 10 min each time in washing buffer at RT. sections were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in DPBS-BCO. grids were stained with 4% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate for 5 min and Reynolds lead citrate for 3 min. background labeling was determined using mock-infected leaf cross sections. discs of mock- and TuMV-infected leaf tissues were punched out with a punching device for flat specimen carriers in a drop of 1-hexadecene on a soft piece of rubber. the samples were immediately frozen in a high-pressure freezer (Leica EM PACT2; Leica Microsystems) the samples were then transferred and stored under liquid nitrogen conditions in transfer boxes. a series of single-axis-tilt images was collected with a Tecnai G2 F20 cryo-S/TEM (FEI) operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. images were captured over a tilt range of 4\u00b0 (1\u00b0 increments) on the 90-nm-thick section, and the resulting images had a pixel size of 0.5 nm. red arrows, connection between a SMT and the rER membrane; yellow, SMTs, sky blue, rER; magenta, cytoplasmic inclusion body. CI, cytoplasmic inclusion body; rER, rough endoplasmic reticulum; SMVL, single-membrane vesicle-like structure. four-week-old plants were agroinfiltrated with the infectious clone TuMV/6K2:GFP or the mock-infected empty vector, pCambia 0390. leaves were collected at 9 dpi and sliced into 1-mm strips using a razor blade. plasts were washed two times in washing buffer (0.4 M mannitol, 20 mM MES, pH 5.7) and then resuspended in 10 ml prewarmed (37\u00b0C) lysis buffer (0.2 M mannitol, 10% [wt/vol] Ficoll, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) Epon tended to give a higher image contrast than Spurr, but its penetration into the sample was inhibited because of its higher viscosity. TEM characterization avoided unknown bacterium-induced negative effects, since agrobacteria were frequently found in intercellular space of the infiltrated leaf. the midrib area of systemically infected leaves was collected at different days postinfection with the infectious clone TuMV/6K2:GFP. no 6K2:GFP signal was observed by confocal microscopy in the cross sections of the midrib area at 4 dpi (n = 8), suggesting that infection had not yet reached the upper noninfiltrated leaves. an upper young leaf of an N. benthamiana plant was imaged by tile scanning with a Zeiss LSM-780 confocal microscope using a 10 objective. the tile scan was carried out by assembling images of 11 by 13 tiles. cross sections of a leaf midrib area systemically infected with TuMV/6K2:GFP were imaged by confocal microscopy using a 20 objective. cells were characterized by the accumulation of CM structures adjacent to the rER at 5 dpi. the shape of the structures was round or oval, and the size was estimated to be 113 nm 38 nm (n = 56) in diameter or in length. a 1-day delay in membrane modification took place in mesophyll cells. at 6 dpi, the CM structures were either located near or connected with the rER, and some SMVL structures were associated with the CM structures. at 8 dpi, both SMVL structures and DMVL structures with an electron-dense core were observed. 6K2:GFP:HA-coding sequence was thus introduced into the TuMV infectious clone pCambiaTuMV to produce pCambiaTuMV/6K2:GFP:HA. morphology of 6K2 vesicles was not compromised, as analyzed by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. dsRNA-specific gold particles are located in mock-infected versus TuMV-infected cells. the dsRNA-specific gold particles are localized to TuMV-induced membranous aggregates. the results of two different labeling experiments were considered. anti-HA and anti-RdRp labeling was weak with osmium-treated samples. a 15-min postfixation incubation period with 0.1% reduced osmium tetroxide was added before the dehydration step. this step increased the membrane contrast but also decreased the antigenicity of the tested proteins. a larger amount of labeling was observed on infected samples. the results showed that the gold particles were mainly associated with SMVL structures (98.5%), with few gold particles being found on the DMVL structures. these data suggest that SMVL structures are TuMV RNA replication sites. thickness of the midrib is 356 m 64 m (n = 35), while it is 97 m 23 m (n = 35) for the other leaf area. CM structures were observed at 6 dpi (Fig. 5A) and SMVL structures of 74 nm 22 nm (n = 48) in diameter were observed at 7 dpi (Fig. 5B) in mesophyll cells. time course analysis of TuMV-induced membranous aggregates in mesophyll cells. TuMV/6K2:GFP systemically infected N. benthamiana leaf without rib tissues were fixed by HPF, processed by FS. eously sized SMVL structures were observed in vascular parenchymal cells at 6 dpi. Figures 6I to IV show the representative tomograms that were generated from a single-axis-tilt series. the 3-D surface rendering shows that most SMTs are closely packed together and have a similar orientation. the 3-D rendering of the electron-dense fibrillar materials inside this SMT (represented in light red) was also regenerated. these fibrillar materials could be the replication complexes containing vRNA. this is consistent with our observation that SMVL structures contain dsRNA. filament bundles associated with electron-dense bodies were frequently observed in HPF/FS-prepared mesophyll cells. individual filaments were 13 nm 1 nm (n = 30) in width, which corresponds to the thickness of TuMV particles. electron-dense bodies had diameters of 64 nm 13 nm (n = 44) and DMVL structures with an electron-dense content of a similar intensity were found close to them. the aligned dots were enclosed in a membrane sac within the central vacuole. these structures were also found in HPF/FS-prepared samples. the vacuole showed more electron-dense material. the total proteins of N. benthamiana leaves systemically infected with TuMV were used as a positive control. the diameter of the dot-like structures is consistent with the diameter of viral particles. these structures may then represent the top view of vertically aligned viral particles. purified vacuoles from mock- and TuMV-infected leaves contained CP. HCpro, which is involved in aphid transmission of viral particles, was also detected in purified vacuoles. TEM protocol for improved membrane contrast. leaf systemically infected with TuMV was analyzed by TEM. cytoplasm of mesophyll cells from an agroinfiltrated leaf was pushed to the periphery of the cell owing to the presence of the large central vacuole. cytoplasm of mesophyll cells from an agroinfiltrated leaf was pushed to the periphery of the cell. the midrib area of systemically infected leaves was collected at different days postinfection with the infectious clone TuMV/6K2:GFP. no 6K2:GFP signal was observed by confocal microscopy in the cross sections of the midrib area at 4 dpi (n = 8), suggesting that infection had not yet reached the upper noninfiltrated leaves. this time frame was thus chosen to observe by TEM the progression of TuMV cellular reorganization the fluorescent Brightener 28-stained cell wall is shown in false magenta color. the lower panels show higher-magnification images of the areas in the rectangles in the upper panels. cells were scored positive for TuMV infection by the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions of different morphologies (e.g., pinwheels, bundles, and short curved laminated aggregates or scrolls) few SMVL structures were present at the periphery of CM amalgams at 6 dpi. at 8 dpi, both SMVL structures and DMVL structures with an electron-dense core were observed. DMVL structures had an outer membrane diameter or length of 172 nm 56 nm (n = 40) and an electron-dense core diameter or length of 114 nm 45 nm (n = 40) the 6K2:GFP:HA-coding sequence was thus introduced into the TuMV infectious clone pCambiaTuMV to produce pCambiaTuMV/6K2:GFP:HA. morphology of 6K2 vesicles was not compromised, as analyzed by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. immunogold labeling was performed on the cross sections of mock- and TuMV-infected N. benthamiana leaf tissues by using anti-HA, anti-RdRp, and anti-dsRNA antibodies. the results of two different labeling experiments were considered, and 200 gold particles were counted. anti-HA and anti-RdRp labeling was weak with osmium-treated samples. but the anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody J2 worked well on the reduced osmium-treated samples. the number of gold particles per square micrometer and the relative labeling distribution over mock-infected and TuMV-infected sections were determined. high-pressure freezing (HPF) is widely regarded as the optimal fixation method for TEM (36) high-pressure freezing (FS) is complete within milliseconds and ensures simultaneous immobilization of all macromolecular components (37) electron-dense bodies of 172 nm 59 nm (n = 48) in diameter were observed in HPF/FS-prepared mesophyll cells at 7 dpi. however, electron-dense bodies of 172 nm 59 nm (n = 20) in diameter were also frequently observed in HPF/FS-prepared mesophyll cells at 8 dpi. TuMV-induced heterogeneous SMVL structures in a mesophyll cell at 6 dpi. images in panels I to III are higher-magnification images of the structures identified by the arrows labeled I to III. the 3-D surface rendering shows that most SMTs are closely packed together and have a similar orientation. the SMTs were touching one another, but no holes or connections were observed. the 3-D rendering shows that most SMTs are closely packed together and have a similar orientation. the left panel of Fig. 7C is a close-up of the area identified by the solid square depicted in Fig. 7A. the two right panels are 3-D surface renderings for some of the membrane structures. these membrane structures are SMTs (in yellow) along with double-membrane tubules (DMTs) interspersed between them with irregularly shaped tubules. of 64 nm 13 nm (n = 44), and DMVL structures with an electron-dense content of a similar intensity were found close to them. these structures were also seen in chemically fixed samples, although less frequently (Fig. 8C). these data suggest that these bodies are involved in viral particle assembly. a higher-magnification image of the area in the white square is shown at the bottom. monolayer dot-like structures are aligned along the tonoplast (A, panel I) and loaded into the vacuole from the cytoplasm (A, panel II, and B) 2-D images were collected on a 90-nm-thick ultrathin section. they were aligned and reconstructed to generate a 3-D representation. a 3-D surface rendering showed that they were a cross section of a monolayer of TuMV particles aligned along the same axis. CM collections are reminiscent of those induced during infection by dengue virus (DENV; a flavivirus) (43) and the SARS coronavirus (1). CM structures have been proposed to be sites of viral polyprotein processing and storage for proteins and lipids involved in vRNA replication. both potyviruses and enteroviruses belong to the picornavirus-like virus superfamily. 3-D model showed that the SMV-induced SMVL structures are SMTs (2, 41) vRNA replication proteins were localized on the external cytoplasmic surface of the single-membrane tubule/vesicle. CP did not colocalize with membrane-bound viral replication complexes. this suggests that vRNA encapsidation occurs at a site adjacent to membrane-bound vRNA replication complexes. however, the ultrastructure of the TuMV-induced small motile vesicles still needs to be defined. the acidic pH and the presence of Ca2+ could facilitate crystal formation. the highly stable and compact RYMV particles would ultimately be released from the vacuole during xylem vessel differentiation. the membrane envelope around TuMV particles would thus provide a protective shield against harsh environmental conditions prevalent in the central vacuole for subsequent long-distance movement. hloem sap by sensing the pH (7.0 to 7.5) and a high sucrose concentration (about 400 mmol1) is inserted into the vacuole of parenchymatous cells. owing to the acidic pH (5.0 to 5.5) and low sucrose concentration, the stylet is withdrawn. this brief probing of the aphid stylet in the central vacuole may be sufficient to acquire the membrane-bound TuMV. at the midstage of TuMV infection, CM structures are produced. SMTs are transformed from CM structures and are involved in vRNA replication. electron-dense bodies are produced at the late stage of TuMV infection."}
