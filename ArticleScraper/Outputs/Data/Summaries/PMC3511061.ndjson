{"summary": "177 patients included in this retrospective study, 73% were positive for at least one virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (36.6%) and human rhinovirus (24%) most frequently detected. molecular diagnostic techniques for the detection of respiratory pathogens have been developed, providing rapid results with an increased sensitivity. these new techniques contributed to the discovery of novel viruses such as the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [7], SARS coronavirus [8], human bocavirus [11] and the recently described KI and WU polyomaviruses [12,13]. data collected included age, gender, underlying medical conditions, use of antibiotics prior to admission, signs and symptoms at presentation, findings on physical examination, oxygen requirement, rate and duration of hospitalization, complications, bacterial cultures and definitive clinical diagnosis. no medical ethics review was required according to the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act. Statistical analyses were conducted using a chi-square test for categorical variables. if a given virus was not detected by (RT)-qPCR, the corresponding viral load was assigned a value of zero. the majority of pediatric patients who visit the hospital are referred by their family doctor. the need for subject or parental informed consent was thus waived. to guarantee the privacy of study patients we coded all tested isolates according to the requirements of the National Privacy Regulations in the Netherlands. (RT)-qPCR results were expressed in cycle threshold (Ct) values. Ct values are inversely correlated with viral load. if a given virus was not detected by (RT)-qPCR, the viral load was assigned a value of zero. all other respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae were detected. most commonly detected were RSV in 64 (36.6%) and HRV in 42 (24.1%) samples. HRV, the most detected virus, was found between November and February. HCoVs were detected in 12 patients, with HCoV-OC43 the most frequent coronavirus, only detected in November and December. HPeV, HMPV, FLUBV, KIPyV and M. pneumoniae were always co-detected. for HRV the mean Ct value for 36 single virus infections was 28.3 and 27.8 for 28 multiple virus infections (p = 0.74). for HRV the mean Ct value for 15 single virus infections was 30.7 and 31.4 for 27 multiple virus infections (p = 0.76). for HRV the mean Ct value for 6 single virus infections was 33.9 and 27.3 for 9 multiple virus infections (p = 0.057) there was no difference in the duration of hospitalization between the two groups (4.65 versus 3.96 days; p = 0.56) there was no difference in the duration of hospitalization between the two groups (4.65 versus 3.96 days; p = 0.56) patients with more than 1 respiratory pathogen were more likely to present with the following symptoms when compared to those with 1 respiratory pathogen. there were 68 patients 3 months of age (38.4%) and 109 (61.6%) > 3 months of age. HRV was associated with general discomfort (p = 0.021) and rhinorrhea (p = 0.012) and HEV with fever (p = 0.045), dyspnea (p = 0.007), rhinorrhea (p = 0.014) and wheezing (p = 0.017) HAdV was associated with fever (p = 0.026), HBoV with feeding problems (p = 0.032) and HCoVs with rhinor HEV in 8.5%, WUPyV in 5.6%, HPIV-1 in 5.1%, HCoV-OC43 in 4.0%, HPIV-3 in 2.8%, HPeV 2.3%, HCoV-HKU1, HMPV and M. pneumoniae in 1.7%, FLUBV in 1.1% of the samples. RSV and HRV were found in 27 (57.4%) and 28 (59.6%) of the 47 respiratory samples with multiple respiratory pathogens viruses. for HRV the mean Ct value for 15 single virus infections was 30.7 and 31.4 for 27 multiple virus infections (p = 0.76). for HRV the mean Ct value for 6 single virus infections was 33.9 and 27.3 for 9 multiple virus infections (p = 0.76). patients with and without respiratory pathogens had a higher rate of hospitalization (116 versus 34; p 0.001) than patients without respiratory pathogens. there was no difference in the duration of hospitalization between the two groups. there was no difference in pre-existent comorbidity, premature delivery and abnormalities on chest radiograph observed between these two groups. patients with more than one respiratory pathogen were more likely to present with the following symptoms when compared to those with 1 respiratory pathogen. patients > 3 months of age presented more often with fever (52.9% vs. 68.8%; p = 0.034) and had higher level of C-reactive protein (mean 40 mg/l vs. 18 mg/l; p = 0.039) than those 3 months of age. of 139 patients with the clinical diagnosis of RTI, 120 (86.3%) were diagnosed with a viral RTI and 19 (13.7%) with a bacterial RTI. an antibiotic was prescribed to 29 (24.8%) patients with viral infection before the definite diagnosis was made. eventually 17 patients had a positive test result. the co-infection rate ranged from 17% to 41% in the younger patients. the higher detection rate of respiratory pathogens among younger children has been ascribed to a higher infection rate, lower viral clearance rate due to a still developing specific immune system against these viruses. infections HRV was involved in a much lower co-detection rate of 23.6%. some studies have shown that multiple viral pathogens cause more severe disease. others did not find any difference in disease severity between detection of a single and multiple respiratory viruses in respiratory samples. the impact of a rapid influenza test result was determined on patient management. rapid and sensitive diagnosis of viral infections is also thought to be important to reduce nosocomial transmission as all patients infected with a respiratory virus need to be isolated."}
