{"summary": "enteroviruses belong to the largest genera in the Picornaviridae family. the genus Enterovirus is divided into 10 established and 2 proposed species. at least 7 species infect humans including human rhinovirus (HRV) and human enteroviruses (A\u2013D) that include enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) and coxsackievirus A and B (CVA and CVB) several outbreaks of EV-D68 have been reported in the last 3\u20134 years in Europe, Asia and North America. nationwide outbreak of severe respiratory illness due to EV-D68 infection occurred in the us in 2014. HRVs were recently reclassified into the Enterovirus genus. 3Cpro is functionally and structurally highly conserved among enteroviruses. 3Cpro is an attractive target for discovery of anti-enterovirus small molecule therapeutics. successful development of -ketoamide protease inhibitors against hepatitis C virus (Telaprevir and Boceprevir) suggests these -ketoamide compounds may have a high potential for further drug development against emerging EV-D68 as well as HRV. cDNA encoding full length EV-D68 3Cpro gene was amplified by RT-PCR as previously described. cDNA encoding full length EV-D68 3Cpro gene was amplified by RT-PCR as previously described. the amplified product was subcloned into pET-28(+) vector using EcoRI and XhoI enzyme sites. expression and purification of the protease was performed with a standard method described previously by our lab. the relative fluorescence units (RFU) were determined by subtracting the background values (substrate containing well without protease) from the raw fluorescence values. the dose-dependent FRET inhibition curves were fitted with variable slope using the GraphPad Prism software. guinea pig serum raised against EV-D68 was used for staining. secondary antibody (FITC conjugated goat anti-guinea pig serum) was used for staining. three healthy specific pathogen free rats were given orally or intravenously with a single dose of compound 10 at 10 mg/kg (body weight) the drug was dissolved in 10% ethanol and 90% PEG400. plasma was obtained by centrifugation and stored at \u2013 20 \u00b0C until analysis. five pairs of aldehyde and ketoamide compounds were focused for their activity against EV-D68 and HRV strains. Known enterovirus inhibitors, Plecornail, an entry blocker, and AG7088, a 3Cpro inhibitor, were purchased from Sigma-Aldridge (St Louis, MO) 0.05 0.02 10 C(O)C(O)NH(Cyc-Prop) 0.022 0.05 0.02 0.01 AG7088 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 0.013 0.04 0.014 0.05 2.2. EV-D68 and HRV (1B and 51 strains) obtained from ATCC. ase was performed with a standard method described previously by our lab (Takahashi et al., 2011). the protease assay was performed as follows; stock solutions (10 mM) of the substrate and compounds were prepared in DMSO, and diluted in assay buffer. the protease was mixed with serial dilutions of each compound or mock. inhibition assays WI-38 cell line was used for the cell-based inhibition assay for EV-D68 and HRVs at 37 \u00b0C. the inhibitory effects of each compound against HRV strains were also tested in HeLa cells at 33 \u00b0C to confirm the results obtained from WI-38 cells. cytotoxicity was measured using a non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit. the enzyme selectivity of compound 10 was evaluated against a panel of representative host proteases. the data were fit to one or two-compartment model with and without a lag time and the best model was selected based on Akaike Information Criteria using PKSolver program. the percent bioavailability (%F) was calculated by dividing the PO plasma AUC0- by the IV plasma AUC0- times 100. the compounds with Cha at R2 (compound 5, 6, 9 and 10) were generally more active than those with leu or Phe at R2 against 3Cpro of EV-D68 and HRV14. the most potent compounds for both EV-D68 and HRV14 3Cpro were compound 6 and 10 and their IC50 values were comparable to those of AG7088 and Pleconaril. the EC50 values of these two best compounds were comparable to those of AG7088 or Pleconaril. IFA staining of EV-D68 in WI-38 cells incubated with various concentrations of compound 10 confirmed the antiviral activity of the compound in the cells. IFA staining of EV-D68 infected with WI-38 cells with various concentrations (0.005\u20130.5 M, B\u2013E) of compound 10. controls include no virus infection (A) and virus infection without the compound (F). the plasma drug concentration data were fit to a one or two-compartment model with and without a lag time. the two-compartment model was selected as a best fit with lowest Akaike Information Criteria using PKSolver program (version 2.0) the summary of the PK parameters following IV or PO administration of compound 10 is listed in Table 4. a summary of the PK parameters obtained following an intravenous (IV) or oral (PO) dose of compound 10 at 10 mg/kg. blood was collected at various time points. plasma drug concentrations were measured and the data were fit to two-compartment model using the PKSolver program. poliovirus 3Cpro was superimposed on EV-D68 3Cpro using PyMol. the bisulfite adduct reverts back to aldehyde compound 1. the bisulfite adduct then interacts with Cys146 to form the enzymeinhibitor complex (4DCD) the image also shows hydrogen bonds between the compound and enzyme. the most potent compounds for both EV-D68 and HRV14 3Cpro were compound 6 and 10 and their IC50 values were comparable to those of AG7088 and Pleconaril. the EC50 values of these two best compounds were generally in line with the IC50 values determined by the protease assay. in cells infected with EV-D68-without treatment of compound, cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed. most of the cells still attached to the plate were stained for viral proteins. IFA staining of EV-D68 infected with WI-38 cells with various concentrations (0.005\u20130.5 M, B\u2013E) of compound 10. controls include no virus infection (A) and virus infection without the compound (F) in rats the plasma drug concentration data were fit to a one or two-compartment model with and without a lag time. the two-compartment model was selected as a best fit with lowest Akaike Information Criteria using PKSolver program. the summary of the PK parameters following IV or PO administration of compound 10 is listed in Table 4. the data were fit to two-compartment model using the PKSolver program. the percent bioavailability (%F) was calculated by dividing the PO plasma AUC0- by the IV plasma AUC0- times 100. the bisulfite adduct reverts back to aldehyde compound 1 and then interacts with Cys146 to form the enzymeinhibitor complex (4DCD) the image also shows hydrogen bonds between the compound and enzyme with conformational changes in the enzyme from bound (green) and ligand bound forms (magenta) inhibitors of replicases, such as RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase inhibitors, have been reported. the viral 2A or 3Cpro has been more actively used as a target for inhibition. inhibitors of viral proteases haven't yet been licensed for enterovirus infection. the compounds used in this study belong to a series of dipeptidyl transition state 3Cpro inhibitors. this series was previously reported to have activities against HRVs. the presence of Cha at the P2 position did not lead to a marked change in activity against 3Cpro of EV-D68 or HRVs. however, the presence of Cha at the P1 position yielded better activity against EV-D68 and HRVs, compared to Leu and Phe. poliovirus 3Cpro was co-crystallized with compound 1. compound 1 was found to be highly effective against HRV strains with EC50 100 nM and related enteroviruses. compound 10 is shown to have a favorable oral bioavailability in rats with (%F 20) the plasma drug concentrations remained higher than in vitro EC90 values against EV-D68 for more than 16 h following oral administration using the simple formulation. the %F values for the aldehydes were markedly lower (%F 5) with shorter halt-lives in rats, as compared to those of compound 10. the antiviral potency and favorable pharmacokinetic properties of compound 10 suggest that this compound might be used as a viable lead candidate for further development for EV-D68 and/or HRV infections as a single agent."}
