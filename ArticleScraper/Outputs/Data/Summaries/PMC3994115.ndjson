{"summary": "adult patients with severe HAP required admission to intensive care unit. 107 patients (40.8%) underwent bronchoscopic BAL for etiologic diagnosis. most commonly identified viruses were respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus. viral pathogens are not uncommon in adult patients with severe HAP. hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the second most common nosocomial infection. severe HAP requiring treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. the incidence of viral infection has been considerably underestimated in the absence of PCR [9], [10], [22]. no investigation has been focused on the role of viral infection as a cause of HAP. prospective cohort study conducted between march, 2010 and february, 2012. all consecutive adult patients with severe HAP were included in the study. disease severity was evaluated by the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. microorganisms identified from specimens collected within 72 hours after pneumonia diagnosis were included as pathogens. PCR was used to detect atypical bacterial pathogens such as L. pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Statistical Analysis Data were analysed using IBM SPSS for Windows (version 19.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) results are expressed as the mean SD, or median (interquartile range (IQR) all consecutive adult patients with severe HAP were included in the study. disease severity was evaluated by the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. underlying disease was classified according to McCabe and Jackson classification. PCR was used to detect atypical bacterial pathogens such as L. pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4, respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, and human coronaviruses OC43, 229E/NL63. a total of 1854 patients were admitted to our medical ICU and 722 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia. a total of 262 patients with severe HAP were finally included for analysis. the baseline clinical characteristics and underlying diseases are listed in Table 1. a total of 251 patients (95.8%) underwent mechanical ventilation and in 123 (46.9%) patients, clinical presentation was septic shock at the time of ICU admission. n (%) 123 (46.9) HAP = hospital-acquired pneumonia. APACHE = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; SOFA = Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. the immunocompromised state was verified if the patients: (i) had daily administration of corticosteroids (at least 5 mg per day of prednisolone or an equivalent drug), (ii) were solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. 107 patients (40.8%) underwent bronchoscopic BAL for etiologic diagnosis.
