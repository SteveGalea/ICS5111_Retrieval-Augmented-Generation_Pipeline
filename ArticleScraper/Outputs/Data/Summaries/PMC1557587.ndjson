{"summary": "40 million, 350 million, and 170 million people in the world are carrying human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively. annually 5% to 15% of the global population is infected with influenza, resulting in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. inputs to such models include rates of constituent processes such as entry of the virus into the cell, transcription of viral mRNAs, translation of viral proteins, replication of viral genomes, assembly of intermediates, and finally, production and release of viral progeny. preliminary models of such alternative genome designs can use the \u201clanguage\u201d of the wild-type virus. VSV is a prototype negative-sense single-stranded RNA (Mononegavirales, (-)ssRNA) virus. each particle has a single copy of an 11-kb genome carrying five genes that encode nucleocapsid (N), phospho (P), matrix (M), envelope (G) and polymerase (L) proteins. we first analyzed quantitatively and systematically how the intracellular growth of VSV is regulated. the improved understanding of the virus infection may guide us to identify the key regulatory components to manipulate for developing virus mutants as possible vaccine candidates. the relative levels of free viral proteins in the cytoplasm develop differently from their mRNA levels. the persistently low level of N protein is related to its immediate complexation with nascent genomes and anti-genomes to make nucleocapsid particles during the replication step. after 9 h post-infection, the N protein level is predicted to oscillate. more polymerases bind to the stronger promoter of the anti-genome. more polymerases bind to the stronger promoter of the anti-genome. production ratio of genomes to anti-genomes was estimated to be dynamically changed [33], varying from one to 30. genome nucleocapsids can either be used as templates for RNA synthesis or they may be incorporated into progeny virions. extreme values of Scond that favor one process over the other will be detrimental for growth. for extremely large Scond, newly synthesized genomic nucleocapsids would tend to be prematurely incorporated into virion particles before they could serve as templates for transcription. fraction of ribosomes associated with viral mRNAs is defined by 1- rib_host in Equation 26. inhibition of host macromolecular synthesis causes a failure to supply accessory factors needed for initiation and elongation steps of translation. these two mechanisms create a time window when active ribosomes are maximally available for viral translation in infected cells. non-occupied ribosomes are considered as free ribosomes. when two lines coincide, no free ribosomes exist (all the available ribosomes are occupied by viral mRNAs) ation mechanism then creates altered levels of gene expression. in one study, the three internal genes, P, M, and G, were permuted. the resulting six possible VSV strains were characterized. the experiment is based on labeling and quantifying proteins about 4 h post-infection. it represents a point before the majority of viral proteins have been made. the expression rate of each protein was normalized by that of N protein. N1, N2, and N4 strains have the gene orders, 3\u2032-N-P-M-G-L-5\u2032 (N1), 3\u2032-P-N-M-G-L-5\u2032 (N2), 3\u2032-P-M-N-G-L-5\u2032 (N3), 3\u2032-P-M-N-G-N-L-5\u2032 (N4), respectively. reduction in growth that follows from moving the N gene likely reflects, at least, an imbalance between replication and the growth of the other three strains is the model prediction result. the genome and anti-genome of VSV are synthesized in unequal amounts. the stronger promoter allows viral polymerases to produce more genomes to meet their demands as components of virion particles. the black circles indicate the virion productions of wild-type (Sprom = 5.4) in BHK and DBT cells. the changes of virion production by the relocation of N gene along with the variation in the promoter strength of the anti-genome relative to that of the genome are shown. this 38-fold degree of growth attenuation is greater than the product of the constituent attenuations that one calculates by assuming that the effects were uncoupled. simulated levels of G protein in BHK cells infected with six gene-Shuffled VSV Strains. in the late infection stage, a large fraction of G proteins are incorporated into progeny particles, which significantly decreases the intracellular protein level. we might aim to maximize the immunogenicity of VSV or a VSV-based vector through the expression increase of VSV G gene or inserted foreign gene while minimizing their potential pathogenicity by growth attenuation. Enhanced replicative ability of VSV strain by locating its N gene at an earlier position in its genome can contribute to increasing the level of G protein. if either gene N or gene G is located at the fifth position, both levels of virus growth and G protein expression are very low. ust synthesis of antigen by a highly attenuated strain appears to be an effective vaccine strategy. a potent vaccine should ideally elicit a strong humoral or cell-mediated immune response. conventional vaccine development processes are now being replaced by more rational reverse-genetics\u2013based ones. compared with the most abundant N mRNA, L mRNA is very scanty in infected baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (40 140-fold less) the relative production level of each protein matched the relative availability of the corresponding mRNAs (Figure 1B) free viral proteins include all the proteins in the cytoplasm or plasma membrane, but exclude the proteins that are incorporated into nucleocapsids and virion particles. more polymerases bind to the stronger promoter of the anti-genome, ultimately enhancing the production of genomes over anti-genomes. Virion and (-)NC indicate viral genomes that are incorporated into intracellular nucleocapsids. the virion production rate in BHK cells is at maximum 5\u201310 h post-infection. similar simulation results were obtained except that the synthesis of genome-sized viral RNAs continued for longer time. virus actively and passively competes with the host for limited translation resources by inhibiting host transcription and amplifying viral mRNAs. as viral components accumulate in the cytoplasm from the initiation of infection, an ever-increasing fraction of host ribosomes are available for viral mRNAs. this causes a failure to supply accessory factors needed for initiation and elongation steps of translation. a small fraction of ribosomes as active forms (less than 5% out of 5 106 ribosomes, Table 1) are used for viral translation. the estimated distributions between active (equipped with the required accessory factors) and inactive (not equipped) ribosomes. simulated protein expression and growth of several gene-rearranged VSV strains were compared with experimental results. the stepwise decline in the transcription of genes more distant from the 3\u2032-end region promoter highlights how gene order affects gene expression in VSV. expression rate of protein is affected not only by its gene order, or corresponding rate of mRNA production, but also by its length and degradation rate. the net rate of protein production will reflect the rates of both protein synthesis and protein degradation. the experiment is based on labeling and quantifying proteins about 4 h post-infection. PMG and PGM strains have the gene orders 3\u2032-N-P-M-G-L-5\u2032 and 3\u2032-N-P-G-M-L-5\u2032 respectively. the two rectangular boxes include four datapoints where there are the largest discrepancies between simulation and experimental results. we also used our model to predict the growth of VSV strains having the N gene at four different locations. encapsidation was simulated as an instantaneous process when free N proteins were available. encapsidation was simulated as an instantaneous process. encapsidation was simulated as an instantaneous process. the estimated wild-type value of Sprom of 5.4 gives VSV yields higher than 80% of their maximum yields for both cell types. the balance of the production between genome and anti-genome is determined by the promoter strength of the anti-genome relative to that of the genome (Sprom) silico VSV mutants produced 38-fold fewer virus progeny than wild-type in BHK cells. this 38-fold degree of growth attenuation is greater than the product of the constituent attenuations that one calculates by assuming that the effects were uncoupled. the intracellular level of G protein is highly dependent upon the location of G gene on the viral genome. in the late infection stage, a large fraction of G proteins are incorporated into progeny particles, which significantly decreases the intracellular protein level. for vaccine use we might aim to maximize the immunogenicity of VSV or a VSV-based vector. we simulated in silico the growth of all mutants that retain the gene order P \u2013 M \u2013 L of the wild-type, but allow G and N to move. this is consistent with the experimental results of Flanagan et al. [39]. the size of each circle shows the relative level for each VSV strain. the coordinate of each circle indicates the gene order in each strain's genome. under the line there is no VSV strain case. the relative levels of free viral proteins in the cytoplasm develop differently from their mRNA levels. the persistently low level of N protein is related to its immediate complexation with nascent genomes and anti-genomes to make nucleocapsid particles during the replication step. more polymerases bind to the stronger promoter of the anti-genome. more polymerases bind to the stronger promoter of the anti-genome. production ratio of genomes to anti-genomes was estimated to be dynamically changed. genome nucleocapsids can either be used as templates for RNA synthesis or they may be incorporated into progeny virions. their fate depends on levels of polymerase and M protein, respectively. extreme values of Scond that favor one process over the other will be detrimental for growth. the fraction of host ribosomes associated with viral mRNAs is defined by 1-rib_host in Equation 26. however, the inhibition of host macromolecular synthesis causes a failure to supply accessory factors needed for initiation and elongation steps of translation. these two mechanisms create a time window when active ribosomes are maximally available for viral translation in infected cells. the estimated distributions between active (equipped with the required accessory factors) and inactive (not equipped) ribosomes, and between ribosomes available for viral and host mRNAs are shown. the estimated number of ribosomes available for viral translation and actually occupied by viral mRNAs are shown. gene order affects gene expression in VSV strains. the three internal genes, P, M, and G, were permuted. the resulting six possible VSV strains were characterized. the second sets of points indicate mismatches that could reflect unknown strain-specific mechanisms that are not present in our general gene-permutation model. the experiment is based on labeling and quantifying proteins about 4 h post-infection. this relatively early time point allows one to minimize potentially confounding influences of virion particle assembly and production. wild-type virus having the N gene at the first position on the genome grows best, followed by N2, N3, and N4 respectively. insufficient production of N protein would reduce the extent of encapsidation of nascent anti-genome and allow transcription to dominate over genome replication. the growth of the N1 VSV strain is the fitting result, but the growth of the other three strains is the model prediction result. the stronger promoter allows viral polymerases to produce more genomes to meet their demands as components of virion particles. the balance of the production between genome and anti-genome is determined by the promoter strength of the anti-genome relative to that of the genome. black circles indicate the virion productions of wild-type (Sprom = 5.4) in BHK and DBT cells. the extension of phenotypic variations by double genomic manipulations was predicted. the VSV N4 with Sprom = 0.1 produced a simulated 38-fold fewer virus progeny than wild-type in BHK cells. this 38-fold degree of growth attenuation is greater than the product of the constituent attenuations that one calculates by assuming that the effects were uncoupled. the intracellular level of G protein is highly dependent on the location of G gene on the viral genome. in the late infection stage, a large fraction of G proteins are incorporated into progeny particles, which significantly decreases the intracellular protein level. for vaccine use we might aim to maximize the immunogenicity of VSV or a VSV-based vector through the expression increase of VSV G gene. if gene G is fixed, moving gene N closer to the 3\u2032 promoter is predicted to increase protein G expression. Enhanced replicative ability of VSV strain by locating its N gene at an earlier position in its genome can contribute to increasing the level of G protein. a potent vaccine should ideally elicit a strong humoral or cell-mediated immune response. conventional vaccine development processes are now being replaced by more rational reverse-genetics-based ones. both BHK and DBT cells were subcultured approximately every third day. each strain was bulked once on BHK cells at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 0.1 plaque-forming units per cell. cells were harvested, resuspended in growth medium, and plated into six-well plates at a concentration of 5 105 cells per 2 ml per well. each monolayer was then incubated with 200 l of virus inoculum (MOI 3) for 1 h. plates were rocked gently every 20 min to evenly distribute virions on the monolayers during the adsorption step. each sample was fixed with 2 ml of fixative for 3 h at room temperature. the fixative consisted of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (VWR) and 5% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma) in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma) binding step is rate-determining [48], we lump early steps from the binding to the penetration into a first-order expression. the bound virus is immediately endocytosed and fused, and its genome and protein components are instantaneously released into the cytoplasm at the expense of the fused virus particle. the distribution of polymerases continuously varies over the viral templates during transcription and replication. we first partition the viral genome and anti-genome templates into 40 segments, excluding their 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 end regions. for the genome template that is used for transcription as well as for replication, we specially grouped the segments into five genes. genomic templates (negative-sense nucleocapsids) whose promoters are free of polymerases are available for association with free polymerase or M protein. nc, (-)ncM,new, and (-)ncpol,new are concentrations of total genomic nucleocapsids and subsets of genomic nucleocapsids whose promoters are newly occupied by polymerases. the ratio of (-)ncM,new to (-)ncpol,new is determined by the ratio of the association rates of M protein and polymerase with the genomic nucleocapsid. rasso,M and rasso,pol are the rates of the associations of M protein and polymerase with the genomic nucleocapsid. poltermnew is the concentration of the polymerases newly binding to the promoters of the genomes or the anti-genomes. poltrcnew is the concentration of the polymerases newly binding to the promoters of the genomes and anti-genomes. the polymerases newly binding to the promoters of the genomes and anti-genomes start viral. viral polymerase on the leader region of the genome starts either transcription or replication. if there are sufficient free N proteins, then replication dominates transcription. only nocap (= 1 encap) of the polymerases bound to the genomic promoters can start the transcription. the extents of partial transcription termination are quantified by the attenuation factors, i, in our model. the extents of partial transcription termination are quantified by the extents of partial transcription termination. i fraction of polymerases are released at intergenic region i. translation initiation and polypeptide chain elongation contribute to the rate of viral protein synthesis. the ribosomes involved in viral translation are allocated to the five types of viral mRNAs according to their length and abundance. the synthesis rate of each viral mRNA depends on their length and abundance. polymerases located on the trailer and complementary leader regions of the genomes and the anti-genomes, respectively, llec (= ll) is the length of the complementary leader region, and kd,nc (= ll) is the decay rate constant of nucleocapsid. as progeny virions are assembled, the concentration of each protein is reduced by the amount corresponding to its stoichiometry. polr,p,j is the concentration of the replicating polymerases on the jth segment of the positive-sense anti-genomic nucleocapsids, l is the total length of the genome, and nsec is the total number of segments of the genome. as polymerases leave the promoter regions by moving toward the downstream sequence, the concentration of polymerases on the promoters will decrease. two viral products, leader-mRNA and M protein, contribute to the deficiency by inhibiting the synthesis of host macromolecules at the transcription level [19,28,35,36] the pool of host factors is continuously reduced from the onset of infection. we developed an empirical formula using available experimental data from the literature [36] to account for the competition between host and viral mRNAs for ribosomes. the initial condition for simulation is set by a fixed number of infectious extracellular virus particles per cell (Vex(0)). at time zero (t = 0), the number of bound virus particles per cell (Vex(0)). BHK cells were obtained from I. Novella (Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, Ohio, United States) and grown under the same environment as the BHK cells. a nomenclature list is shown in Table 4. Nomenclature Experiments: Cell and virus culture. both BHK and DBT cells were subcultured approximately every third day. each strain of virus was bulked once on BHK cells at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 0.1 plaque-forming units per cell. the plates were rocked gently every 20 min to evenly distribute virions on the monolayers during the adsorption step. each monolayer was then incubated with 200 l of virus inoculum (MOI 3) for 1 h to allow virus adsorption. the fixative consisted of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (VWR) and 5% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma) in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma) of pH 7.4. the agar overlay was then removed, and each sample was rinsed twice with 2 ml of PBS. t is time, and kb is the apparent rate constant for virus binding. the bound virus is immediately endocytosed and fused, and its genome and protein components are instantaneously released into the cytoplasm at the expense of the fused virus particle. the viral polymerase starts to synthesize its own RNA transcription and replication products by elongating along the templates. we first partition the viral genome and anti-genome templates into 40 segments, excluding their 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 end regions. for the genome template that is used for transcription and replication, we specially grouped the segments into five genes. we chose 40 as a minimum number for total segments which allows each gene to be split into a specific integer number of segments proportional to the length of the gene. genomic templates (negative-sense nucleocapsids) whose promoters are free of polymerases are available for association with free polymerase or M protein. nc, (-)ncM,new, and (-)ncpol,new are concentrations of total genomic nucleocapsids and subsets of genomic nucleocapsids whose promoters are newly occupied by M protein. the ratio of (-)ncM,new to (-)ncpol,new is determined by the ratio of the association rates of M protein and polymerase with the genomic nucleocapsid. rasso,M and rasso,pol are the rates of the associations of M protein and polymerase with the genomic nucleocapsid, respectively, and kM and kpol are the rate constants for each association reaction. the concentration of positive-sense anti-genomic nucleocapsids available for binding to polymerases would be ((+)nc \u2013 poltrc(Spol/ltrc)), where (+)nc is the total concentration of anti-genomic nucleocapsids, poltrc is the concentration of the polymerases bound to the promoter region (Trc) of the anti-genomes, and l a factor, encap, is defined as the ratio of the number of free N proteins to the number required to encapsidate all available nascent genome-sized viral RNAs. only nocap (= 1 encap) of the polymerases bound to the genomic promoters can start the transcription: where polN, 1 is the concentration of the polymerases located at the first segment of the N gene. s of partial transcription termination are quantified by the attenuation factors, i, in our model. i fraction of polymerases are released at intergenic region i. i fraction of polymerases are released at intergenic region i. the ribosomes involved in viral translation (rib) are allocated to the five types of viral mRNAs according to their length and abundance. the ribosomes involved in viral translation (rib) are allocated to the five types of viral mRNAs according to their length and abundance. ribi is the concentration of the ribosomes assigned to mRNA i. polr,n,i, 1 and polr,n,i- 1,nsec,i-1 are the concentrations of replicating polymerases on the first segment of gene i. the level of polymerases that scan through the whole genome determines the amount of newly synthesized anti-genomic nucleocapsids. j is the concentration of the replicating polymerases on the jth segment of the positive-sense anti-genomic nucleocapsids, l is the total length of the genome, and nsec is the total number of segments of the genome. in our model, non-encapsidated nascent genome and anti-genome fragments are released from polymerases and immediately degraded. two viral products, leader-mRNA and M protein, contribute to the deficiency by inhibiting the synthesis of host macromolecules at the transcription level. inhibition by the leader mRNA causes a first-order decay of the host factors, resulting in a shortage of the ribosomes equipped with accessory factors for viral translation. host cells with VSV M mRNA and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) plasmid DNA quantified the expression of CAT based on its activity. the decrease of the expression of CAT (or its activity decrease) is proportional to the decrease of the occupancy of host mRNAs by the translation machinery. the viral polymerase on the leader region of the genome starts either transcription or replication. if there are sufficient free N proteins, then replication dominates transcription. a nomenclature list is shown in Table 4. a fraction of viral polymerases release from the genome template at intergenic sections. the extents of partial transcription termination are quantified by the attenuation factors, i. i fraction of polymerases are released at intergenic region i. RNA that is the same for all five viral mRNAs [54] and polt,i is the total concentration of the polymerases occupying on the ith gene. our formulation for transcription assumes that the synthesis of viral mRNAs is rate-controlled by the transcription initiation as well as the elongation of polymerase. lp,i is the length of protein i, and kdp,i is the decay rate constant of protein i. we assumed that the degradation of nucleocapsids yielded intact N proteins. poltr and pollec are the concentrations of the polymerases located on the trailer. the level of polymerases that scan through the whole genome determines the amount of newly synthesized anti-genomic nucleocapsids, (+)nc: where ltr (= ltrc) is the length of the trailer region of the genome. we also considered the first-order kinetics for the decay of anti-genomic nucleocapsids. the condensation of negative-sense nucleocapsid by M protein initiates the virion assembly and the condensed nucleocapsids are not degraded in the same manner as virion progeny. if the requirement for the stoichiometric amounts of proteins is satisfied, progeny virions are instantaneously assembled and released to the extracellular space. host mRNAs outnumber viral mRNAs and thereby successfully compete for the host translation machinery. newly synthesized M proteins inhibit the host transcription initiation and the export of host mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. the ribosomes distribute into membrane-bound and cytoplasmic forms. each class supporting the syntheses of the viral G protein and the other four viral proteins (N, P, M, and L), respectively, we treated the ribosomes in our model as one population. initial condition for simulation is set by a fixed number of infectious extracellular virus particles per cell. two host parameters (Srib and kd,host) were obtained by fitting our model with the one-step growth of wild-type virus in BHK or DBT cells. initial number of infectious extracellular virus particles per cell was three."}
