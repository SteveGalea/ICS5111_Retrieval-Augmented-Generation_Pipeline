{"summary": "HRV is associated with common colds and concomitant sinusitis. exacerbations of asthma in older children and exacerbations of asthma in older children are the predominant features associated with HRV at different age groups. our study reveals comprehensive gene expression profile of epithelial cell response to HRV-B infection across different time points in vitro. we have demonstrated remarkable gene expression changes in each time points post infection including novel virus-induced genes. pure virus was present in high concentration at UP6 fraction as evident by the presence of three distinct bands corresponding to VP1-3 capsid proteins (S1 Fig). the fractions containing concentrated intact virus were dialyzed using 3500 MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis cassettes G2 (3.5 ml) and followed by concentration step using concentrator 9K MWCO (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) cell viability was assessed at 24 and 48 hpi by adding 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution to each well and incubated for 4 hours in the dark condition. stopping solution was added to each well and incubated for 20 minutes. the proportion of the full-length RNA was evaluated by microfluidic analysis using Agilent 2100 Bioanalysier. samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 7 and greater were used for microarray hybridization. cDNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi. ttgctgctg anti-apoptotic BCL2A1 64 F: accagcataggtgtgtgattgt 75 R:caggagaatggataaggcaaa Transcription factor FOSL1 94 F: ctccccctgcacttg 69 R: ccaaaggatagtgcgatgtttt 62 F: ctgccctg three independent replicates of RNA samples from mock-infected and HRV-infected A549-cells at MOI of 10 PFU were purified at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi and hybridized to microarray genechips for gene expression study. the samples were performed in affymetrix GeneChipPrimeView human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarray system includes more than 53,000 probes covering more than 20,000 genes. hybridization was performed using GenChip Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit (P/N 900720) the arrays were washed and stained in GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 prior to scanning with GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) the quality of the starting RNA samples were evaluated using internal control housekeeping genes (GAPDH and ACTB) QC analysis using Expression Console software showed that all the samples were located within threshold boundaries. RNA samples hybridized to the array had RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 7 or greater. modified Fisher\u2019s exact test (EASE score of 0.01) was used to determine probability of overexpressed gene ontology (GO) biological process terms. expression profiles of the IFN genes including IFN-, Il29 (IFN-1) and IL28 (IFN-2/3) were further evaluated using qRT-PCR. the amplified products were further analyzed by agarose gel. all P-values were two-tailed and values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant. ANOVA was applied to identify differentially expressed genes (DE genes) ultracentrifugation at 48k rpm for 2 hours using OptiSeal Polypropylene Tubes (optima L-100XP ultracentrifuge; Beckman Coulter, Inc.) pure virus was present in high concentration at UP6 fraction as evident by presence of three distinct bands corresponding to VP1-3 capsid proteins. human adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelial cell line, A549, was cultured in 96-well plates. cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks and infected with virus MOI of 10 and 50. at 24 and 48 hpi the supernatant was centrifuged and collected from both infected and mock-infected flasks. the RNA integrity and DNA removal was confirmed by 1% denaturating agarose gel electrophoresis. the proportion of the full-length RNA was evaluated by microfluidic analysis using Agilent 2100 Bioanalysier using RNA LabChip Kit (Germany), as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. gene name Amplicon size Primers (5'3') UPL Probe no chemokine CXCL8 90 F: atggttccttccggtggt 72 R: gagcactccataaggcacaaa CCL20 90 F: atgtccccggttgc 71 R: accagcataggtgtgtgctgctgctgctgctgctgctg gcccctgacttggctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgct double-stranded cDNA was used as a template to amplify biotin-modified RNA (amplified RNA or aRNA) to achieve optimal sensitivity of the assay, the labelled aRNA was fragmented to a mean size of 200 bases at 94\u00b0C and for 35 minutes. RNA samples hybridized to the array had RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 7 or greater. the signal value profile was as expected with correct relative abundance for each of the spikes for both target labelling and sample hybridization indicating acceptable hybridization process. the microarray data have been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and assigned the accession number GSE87463. Modified Fisher\u2019s exact test (EASE score of 0.01) was used to determine probability of overexpressed gene ontology biological process terms. ler 480 Instrument II and LightCycler LC480 software version LCS480 1.5.0.39 under following settings: 95\u00b0C for 10 min denaturation followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 30 sec. expression of genes were normalized to the GAPDH in all samples at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi. the time-course analysis of HRV72 infection in A549 cells was performed by applying this infection protocol. the virus induced specific cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by shrinkage and rounding off the cells as well as detachment and destruction of cell layers. the substantial fold change was started at 6 hpi (51.5 fold); continued at 48 hpi (190.4 fold) and highest viral load was observed at 12 hpi (457.6 fold). analysis of the virus propagation in cell culture supernatant also demonstrated time-dependent increase of viral RNA up to 48 hpi. affymetrix microarray gene expression analysis was performed at four time points post infection. the time course analysis of the infection demonstrated that replication of this virus is time-dependent (Fig 2). genes shown in red were up-regulated, while genes shown in green were down-regulated, in HRV-infected compared to mock-infected cells. the genes were determined at four time points by filtering of the genes at p-value 0.05 and with a fold change of 1.5. laudin 1 2.45 0.0083 11 PDLIM5 PDZ and LIM domain 5 2.3 0.0009 12 LOC100129518 Uncharacterized LOC100129518;

DAVID analysis at 12 hpi showed that DE genes fell into diverse functional categories such as regulation of apoptosis, anti-apoptosis, wound healing and blood vessel morphogenesis. genes related to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and remodeling were affected remarkably at 24 and 48 hpi. expression of two specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6; type II DUSP subgroup) was up-regulated by 2.86, 2.12 and 1.50 fold at 6, 12, and 24 hpi. expression of DUSP22 (type I DUSP subgroup) was down-regulated at 6 hpi. other signal transduction related genes were found to be significantly affected. significant induction of chemokines preferentially at early stage of infection could be an indication of characteristic viral infection. the prominent regulation of the apoptosis related genes together with inflammatory chemokines may indicate that many important events related to the virus pathogenicity had happened during early phase of infection. eight up-regulated DEGs in microarray analysis from different functional categories were tested using qRT-PCR for validation. the log2 values normalized to GAPDH. differentiated primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells infected with HRV-A strains showed no DE genes at early infection stage. this discrepancy might be due to patchy pattern of HRV infection in vivo. CC chemokines including CCL2 and CCL20 were significantly induced upon HRV72 infection suggesting that non-neutrophilic immune response could be potentially provoked by this virus. previous studies demonstrated that CCL2 was implicated in HRV induced airway hyper-responsiveness as a mechanism underlying asthma exacerbation. discrepancy in induction or inhibition of IFN-I observed in HRV infections is not clear. defective induction of major antiviral genes could be related to defective induction of IFN genes. HRV72 induced expression of tripartite motif containing (TRIM 10, 68, 26, and 69) genes. cooperative role of AP-1 in conjugation with NF-B in IL8 induction has been shown for RSV[45]. more research on this topic including protein level expression and determination of absolute or cooperative interaction of AP-1 with other transcription factors. in depth understanding of pro/anti-apoptotic pathways regulated by the virus could lead to the development of novel therapeutics against HRV. the category of genes related to the wound healing and coagulation cascade were differentially expressed between HRV infected vs. un-infected airway epithelia cells. the chemokine role in viral infection can be further characterized. it is intriguing to speculate that defective elimination of HRV-B72 in the current in vitro system might be presented as a severe case in in vivo system. further research regarding to the polymorphism of chemokine genes would be advantageous in determining genotype-phenotype associations of HRV infections and complications. the carboxymethylcellulose over layer was decanted and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution. the cells were seeded at optimal density of 1104 cells/well in triplicates in 96 well plate and the cell infection was carried out at 24 h when cells were almost 80% confluent. the complete list of DE genes with 1.5 fold-change at 12 hpi.
