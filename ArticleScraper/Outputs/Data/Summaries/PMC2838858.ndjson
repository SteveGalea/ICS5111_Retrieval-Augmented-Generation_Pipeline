{"summary": "measles virus (MeV) infects approximately 30 million people annually. it is characterized by a prodromal illness of fever, coryza, cough, and conjunctivitis followed by appearance of a generalized maculopapular rash. measles remains a major cause of mortality in children, particularly in areas with inadequate vaccination and medical care. genetically and antigenetically, MeV is most closely related to RPV. meV probably evolved after commencement of livestock farming in the early centers of civilization in the Middle East. Molecular clock analysis can estimate age of ancestors by phylogenetic patterns. the final data sets comprised 149 taxa with an alignment length of 1830 bp for the H gene and 66 taxa with an alignment length of 1578 bp for the N gene. the rates of nucleotide substitutions per site and TMRCA were estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method available in the BEAST package [19,20] derived a mean evolutionary rate of 6.02 10-4 substitutions/site/year for the N gene and 6.44 10-4 substitutions/site/year for the H gene. based on this approach by analyses for the N gene, 1921 was estimated to be the TMRCA of the current MeV (95% HPD) date of divergence between MeV and RPV was 1171. an increasing number of descriptions of measles in the 11th and 12th centuries may reflect the emergence of MeV in human populations at that time [9-11]. this age is still within 95% credible intervals of our results. a common ancestor of MeV and RPV may have caused zoonosis in the past. authors' contributions YF carried out all analyses and drafted the manuscript. AS and HO participated in the design of the study and helped to draft the manuscript."}
