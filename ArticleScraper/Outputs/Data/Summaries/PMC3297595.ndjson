{"summary": "a number of viral infections of the CNS can lead to demyelination, including distemper (dogs), measles (SSPE, humans), and influenza (humans). a number of viral infections of the CNS can lead to demyelination, including distemper (dogs), measles (SSPE, humans), and influenza (humans). GB virus-C (GBV-C or hepatitis G virus) is a human flavivirus originally isolated from a surgeon who was experiencing acute hepatitis. other flaviviruses include dengue viruses, west Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis. occult viral infection with GBV-C appears to induce antibodies that cross-neutralize HIV. this method identified one occult viral infection with GBV-C in a patient who died with primary progressive MS. RNA samples that passed the quality control step above were subjected to rRNA removal using the RiboMinus kit. rRNA was again quantified and subjected to bioanalyzer analysis. reads which perfectly matched UCSC build 18 of the human genome were excluded from the analysis. the longest sequence from each viral taxon was extracted from the input sequence set and placed in the non-redundant output set. the process was repeated until no unscreened subsequences longer than 49 bases remained in the input. a word size of 16 was used, sequence filtering was disabled. Detection of GBV-C PCR primers was designed from 4 regions of the GBV-C genome based on the deep sequencing results. primers were selected from the 5\u2032-NTR, E2 and NS3 gene regions based on Souza et. al. three anti-GBV-C antibody preparations and controls were provided by the Jack Stapleton laboratory at the University of Iowa. these included pre- and post-immune rabbit polyclonal antiserum against GBV-C E2 protein [24], mouse monoclonal anti-E2 #7067 [24], and mouse monoclonal 1C4 [28], plus control mouse IgG1. imens 100 mg pieces of cryopreserved white matter from MS plaques or control specimens were obtained from the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center, West Los Angeles VA Medical Center and from the Rocky Mountain MS Center, University of Colorado, Denver. this research was submitted to the University of Utah Health Sciences IRB and was found to be exempt from review and oversight. datasets of 36 bp sequences, or reads, were obtained from each brain sample. low complexity reads, reads with homopolymeric stretches longer that 18 bases and those with Bustard quality scores 5 in more than 13 positions were excluded from the analysis. the remaining high quality reads are defined as \u201cscreened reads\u201d the process was repeated until no unscreened subsequences longer than 49 bases remained in the input. a word size of 16 was used, sequence filtering was disabled. sequence-virus pairs with expect values 1.0 were considered in further analysis. primer sequences (5\u2032-3\u2032) employed were: 5\u2032-NTR-1: AAGCCCCAGAAACCGACGCC, TGAAGCGACGTGGACCGT 5\u2032-NTR-2: CGGCCAAAAGGTGGGGACCGT. a standard curve was generated using log dilutions of synthetic standard GBV-C RNA. three anti-GBV-C antibody preparations and controls were provided by the University of Iowa. the tissues were penetrated with Triton-X and endogenous peroxidase was quenched. sections were blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Vector product S-1000) the proportion of specimens obtained from each of the two brain banks was similar between the MS and control groups. the 17 sequenced MS specimens came from deceased patients that carried the diagnoses of primary progressive MS (3), chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (5), secondary progressive MS (5), relapsing-remitting MS (2), or multiple sclerosis. retroviruses were reserved for later analysis due to the ubiquitous expression of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVS) in human specimens. Hits were observed to 2153 remaining taxa. the hit rates to each taxon for each MS sample were then compared to the control hit rate distribution for that taxon. newly assembled contigs were then aligned back to the taxon specific viral databases again. this strategy identified GBV-C as a promising candidate for PCR follow up in a single MS brain sample. the results of this analysis are shown in Table 1. ae 9109 106 bp 1 assembled, confirmed by PCR Foot and Mouth Disease virusPicornaviridae 4102 36 bp 3 not confirmed as viral sequence4 1 students t-test (minimum value) corrected for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method. the assembly of short reads did not improve alignment with the indicated viral sequences. 68 * 1 Viral taxa are defined as sequences in GenBank below the level of family. this includes sequences identified as belonging to genus or species or subspecies (strain) it also includes sequences not assigned to a specific species or genus (strain) rtPCR of this brain sample showed between 1.7106 and 2.4106 viral genome copies per gram of tissue. 1.1106 viral genome copies/ml were not detected in CSF from this subject. MS and seven control CSF samples were interrogated with 3 separate GBV-C specific primers (NTR-1, E2 and NS3) the MS-6 CSF sample was used as a positive control. the recovered sequence of GBV-C UU1 contained a open reading frame of 2842 codons. 17 frozen MS plaque and 15 control, undiseased brain specimens were extracted. they were kept frozen at 70 degrees until being subjected to RNA extraction in our laboratory. the post-mortem interval between the MS and control specimens was similar. s or screened reads between the MS and control brain specimens. Hit rates were calculated for each taxon represented in the nonredundant viral database. only 109 out of 7947 (1.4%) viral taxa showed a non-normal distribution of control hit rates. overrepresented viral taxa had all the deep sequencing reads from the implicated sample aligned to a database containing all GenBank sequences for the taxon of interest. the reads were then joined into contiguous regions (contigs) using SSAKE, a short read assembler. these newly assembled contigs were then aligned to both host and taxon specific viral databases again. this strategy identified GBV-C as a promising candidate for PCR follow up in a single bovine herpesvirus 1Maculoverpesviridae 4105 36 bp 3 not confirmed as viral sequence4 GBV-CFlaviviridae 9109 106 bp 1 assembled, confirmed by PCR Foot and Mouth Disease virusPicornaviridae 4102 36 bp 1. 68 * 1 Viral taxa are defined as sequences in GenBank below the level of family. it includes sequences identified as belonging to genus or species or subspecies (strain) it also includes sequences not assigned to a specific species or genus. PCR primers for 3 viral regions (5\u2032-NTR, E2 and NS3) were designed from the contigs assembled from the Illumina sequencing data on this particular subject. Sequencing of the amplicons showed 96\u201399% identity to >100 known GBV-C sequences. interrogation of CSF from this subject showed 1.1106 viral genome copies/ml. MS and control Specimens Specific RT-PCR amplification of 31 affected (MS) and 23 unaffected (control) brain samples were performed with each of the 3 GBV-C primer sets testing for both positive and negative strand viral RNA. both strands of GBV-C RNA were detected only in subject MS-6, both before and after ribosomal removal. some anti-GBV-C dependent staining of neuronal cytoplasm was observed in both infected and uninfected brain sections. the monoclonal rabbit anti-GBV-C preparations did not specifically detect GBV-C in any of the human brain tissues examined. this method revealed several viral candidates. the presence of one of these candidates, GBV-C, was confirmed in the brain of one of the subjects who suffered and died with progressive MS. this virus has never been detected before the presence of both positive (RNA genome) and negative (replication intermediate) strand flaviviral RNA in MS-6 suggests that the virus was actively replicating in the brain of this subject. the clinical history revealed onset of primary progressive MS beginning at age 44 in an otherwise healthy Caucasian woman. the disease was relentless causing the subject to use a wheelchair by age 55 and to become bed bound at age 60. the failure to specifically detect GBV-C by immunohistochemistry in brain sections from subject MS-6 was disappointing. this may be due to a relative absence of viral antigen in these tissues or the lack of suitable reagents for the detection of GBV-C antigen in fixed, paraffinized tissue."}
