{"summary": "approximately 95% of HTLV-I infected individuals will remain asymptomatic for their lifetimes, but roughly 5% of these patients will develop disease. in japan, an estimated 1.2 million HTLV-I carriers have been identified, and more than 700 cases of adult T-cell leukemia are diagnosed each year. HTLV-I infection requires cell-to-cell contact with infected T cells. transmission may occur via sexual contact, vertical transmission (i.e., breast milk), and transfusion with infected blood. ham/TSP patients reported history of blood transfusion as opposed to 3% of normal donors. the specific sensitivity of an EIA assay is approximately 95%. the specificity of an EIA assay is approximately 95% and the specificity of the WB is 97.1%. a sample is classified as HTLV-I positive if it meets the established criteria. there have been reports around the world of HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate banding patterns that do not meet the strict criteria of HTLV-I seropositivity [15\u201321]. HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate samples have been identified in otherwise healthy and normal individuals from Jamaica, Japan, Brazil, and other HTLV-I endemic areas. the reported prevalence of seroindeterminates has varied greatly from.023% in Taiwan, to 0.1% in IND-1 IND-2 and IND-3 illustrate three possible banding patterns of seroindeterminate samples. reports of large numbers of HTLV-I/II seroindeterminates have come from Iran, Brazil, Japan, Argentina, Taiwan, the Caribbean, Central Africa, and the united states. HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate samples from the united states failed to block antibody reactivities. this led to the assertion that the molecular mimicry may extend to epitopes other than the P. falciparum and plasmodial antigens. HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate patterns are being reported in areas where exposure to P. falciparum is extremely unlikely, such as the united states. cross-reactivity between antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and HTLV has been observed on occasion [27] HTLV antibody response was exhibited when serology tests were performed on samples from patients admitted to a hospital in Taiwan for SARS. however, this was immediately following the SARS outbreak in 2003. new human retroviruses were found in cameroonese hunters showing no signs of HTLV-related diseases. all four HTLV types show 60\u201370% sequence homology with each other. the most plausible suggestions seems to be that HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate blots may result from a low copy number of prototypic HTLV-I. analysis of the 5\u2032 LTR indicated that the HTLV-I strain infecting the patient was of the Cosmopolitan subtype [22] this was the first reported verification of a PCR negative seroindeterminate sample resulting from infection of a full length HTLV-I virus [22]. further support for the suggestion that these seroindeterminates may be the result of a low copy number of prototype HTLV-I comes from a study of patients transfused with HTLV-1 in endemic regions such as Iran and Brazil suggest a potentially far greater exposure to HTLV-I at least in some sub-populations of HTLV-I/II WB seroindeterminates. the table illustrates the prevalence of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) in various cohorts, as well as the percentage of HTLV-I Western blot seroindeterminates in the respective cohort. HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate samples from the united states failed to block antibody reactivities. a subset of HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate samples may exhibit an antibody cross-reaction between HTLV-I and P. falciparum. this suggests that in geographic regions known to be endemic for malaria, such as the Philippines. activity between antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and HTLV has been observed on occasion. HTLV antibody response was exhibited when serology tests were performed on samples from patients admitted to a hospital in Taiwan for SARS. however, this was immediately following the SARS outbreak in 2003. new human retroviruses were found in cameroonese hunters showing no signs of HTLV-related diseases. all four HTLV types show 60\u201370% sequence homology with each other. the most plausible suggestions seems to be that HTLV-I/II seroindeterminate blots may result from a low copy number of prototypic HTLV-I. this was the first reported verification of a PCR negative seroindeterminate sample resulting from infection of a full length HTLV-I virus [22]. further support for the suggestion that these seroindeterminates may be the result of a low copy number of prototype HTLV-I comes from a study of patients transfused with HTLV-1 infected blood. the most prevalent seroindeterminate banding pattern observed in Iran was the appearance of GD21 alone. the prevalence of HTLV-I/II seroindeterminates remains uncertain. it is clear that further investigation is necessary. the sequencing of a virus from a seroindeterminate cell line implicates exposure to the virus. serum samples with negative HTLV-I/II results by EIA may also have seroindeterminate banding patterns by WB. this suggests testing at one time point by EIA cannot ensure the exclusion of seroindeterminate samples. this implies testing at one time point by EIA cannot ensure the exclusion of seroindeterminate samples. the plasmids used in the LIPS assay are inserted with a gene including immunogenic epitope of a virus. a preincubated serum/antigen mixture is then washed to remove any fusion proteins that did not bind to the antibody. further examination of immunogenic epitopes, such as HTLV-I Rex and HBZ, may enhance the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. HTLV-I/II seroindeterminates represent exposure to prototype HTLV-I or HTLV-II. frequency of infection in general population will be greater than previously believed."}
