{"summary": "the earliest therapeutic nucleic acids explored were antisense oligonucleotides, typically short (13\u201325 nucleotides (nts)) single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules. the earliest therapeutic nucleic acids were antisense oligonucleotides, typically short (13\u201325 nucleotides). the RNAi pathway RNAi is a conserved mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing identified in multiple organisms, from worms to plants to mammals. the RNAi pathway RNAi is a conserved mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing identified in multiple organisms, from worms to plants to mammals. dicer proteins usually contain a helicase/ATPase domain, two RNaseIII-like domains, and a dsRNA binding domain. the size of siRNAs produced are predicted by the distance between the PAZ and the RNaseIII domains. the 3\u2032 overhangs are a common feature produced by RNaseIII activity. binding protein (TRBP) is the catalytic endonuclease at the heart of human RISC. the strand with least complementarity at the 5\u2032 end tends to serve as the guide. the strand with least complementarity at the 5\u2032 end tends to serve as the guide. RNAi has become a preferred method to perform highly specific genetic manipulations for functional studies in cell culture. RNAi studies have greatly expanded the repertoire of possible drug targets to treat metabolic and genetic disorders, cancer, or viral infections. RNAi and HCV RNAi is considered an endogenous antiviral mechanism in plants and insects. but it is unlikely to be a robust antiviral pathway in mammalian somatic cells. some evidence for limited antiviral activity of RNAi in mammalian cells. b HCV replicon replication can be inhibited by sequestering miR-122 [41] and infectious J6/JFH-1 replication and virus production can be inhibited by anti-miR-122 RNAs [38]. a much more detailed description of HCV therapeutic approaches targeting miR-122 is described in this special issue of Viruses by Catherine Jopling [45]. dsRNAs can activate the interferon pathway. it was necessary to address whether HCV-specific siRNAs could trigger IFN production. dsRNAs were better at reducing HCV RNA levels than high doses of IFN-. ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18) and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4K-III) siRNAs significantly reduce HCV replication suggesting this is a critical viral replication cofactor [61\u201364,66,67]. RNAi-based antiviral strategies have a number of distinct advantages and disadvantages compared with these therapies. in one study, siRNA-resistant HCV replicons emerged after four weeks of HCV-siRNA therapy with specific mutations in the target sequence. multiple viral and/or cellular targets must be considered to minimize the risk of drug resistance. RISC can integrate siRNAs into the miRNA pathway to produce translational repression of unintended mRNAs containing seed region homology. a pool of siRNAs could be used wherein the concentration of an individual siRNA is reduced. some siRNAs have been shown to trigger innate immunity leading to cytokine and interferon production. adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) is an attractive delivery vehicle for HCV therapies due to its improved liver transduction efficiency over other AAV vectors. toxicity can be controlled by lowering the shRNA dosage, either by decreasing the amount of virus or the strength of shRNA promoter. trial was predicted not to reach therapeutic potential and was terminated in 2009. PF-4523655 (formerly RTP801i-14) is a siRNA currently in phase II trials for use in AMD and also diabetic macular degeneration. CALAA-01 is a RNAi therapeutic candidate for treatment of solid tumors. siRNA-mediated treatment to boost the immune response against metastatic melanoma is also in phase I (Duke University) the first antiviral siRNA drug approved for clinical trials targets respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) clinical results show it is feasible, well tolerated in patients, and has sustained expression up to 24 months [100] the safety of a therapeutic for HCV that targets miR-122 is being analyzed in phase I clinical trials. the major challenge now is to progress from HCV in vitro \u201cproof of concept\u201d studies to in vivo therapeutic approaches using siRNAs or shRNAs. intravenous injection of cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs for apolipoprotein B (apoB) was effective at silencing transcripts in the liver and jejunum of mice. siRNAs conjugated to bile-salt derivatives or long chain fatty acids trigger RNAi in hepatocytes in vivo. cationic liposomes have improved hepatic delivery, but siRNA uptake is often observed in other organs. liposome-siRNA based technologies face the problem of escaping the endosome once internalized. dynamic polyconjugates (DPCs) addresses issues of cell-specific targeting and endosomal escape. ligand N-acetylgalactosamine conjugated to PEG is activated only in the acidic environment of the endosome. a single injection of anti-apoB siRNAs carried by DPCs showed specific reduction of apoB mRNA in the liver and not in the jejunum of mice. shRNAs are cloned into viral vectors under control of Pol II or Pol III promoters. RNAi therapeutics may be one of the next generations of drugs to fill this niche. the compelling strength of RNAi therapeutic approaches is that once the proper modifications are designed to minimize off-target effects, while maximising effective delivery of siRNAs or shRNAs to the hepatic cytosol, they are universally applicable to any liver target."}
