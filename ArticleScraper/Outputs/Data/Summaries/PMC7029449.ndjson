{"summary": "transmission dynamics Infections with 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person. in the earliest phase of the outbreak the basic reproductive number was estimated to be around 2.2, assuming a mean serial interval of 7.5 days. it is too early to estimate whether the effective reproductive number has been reduced to below the critical threshold of 1. data on viral shedding dynamics could help in assessing duration of infectiousness. for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), infectivity peaked at around 10 days after illness onset [7], consistent with the peak in viral load at around that time [8]. this allowed control of the epidemic through prompt detection of cases and strict isolation. 2019-nCoV infections could be more severe in older adults, obese individuals or those with underlying medical conditions. if the seriousness of infection is similar to the 1918/19 Spanish influenza, mitigation measures could be tuned accordingly. if the severity of infection is similar to seasonal influenza, the same responses would be warranted for the most severe influenza pandemics. a wide range of control measures can be considered to contain or mitigate an emerging infection such as 2019-nCoV. some experts already questioned whether the 2019-nCoV may behave similarly to MERS-CoV in cases exhibiting mild symptoms without eliciting neutralising antibodies. mobile telephony global positioning system (GPS) data and location services data from social media providers such as Baidu and Tencent in china could become the first occasion when these data inform outbreak control in real time. there is now a shortage of supply of masks in china and elsewhere, and debates are ongoing about their protective value for uninfected persons in the general community. studies in households and other closed settings Determine environmental effects on virus survival and transmission Virus survival studies in situ vivo and in vitro. environmental sampling studies Severity Provide robust estimates of the risk of fatality of hospitalised cases, by age or other important groupings Reports from unselected clinical cohorts of times to death or recovery among resolved cases. the readiness survey by Reusken et al. in this issue of Eurosurveillance testifies to the rapid response and capabilities of laboratories across Europe. we look towards the identification of efficacious pharmaceutical agents to prevent and treat what may likely become an endemic infection globally. beyond the first year, perhaps borne of wishful hope is that after the first few epidemic waves, the subsequent endemic re-infections could be of milder severity."}
