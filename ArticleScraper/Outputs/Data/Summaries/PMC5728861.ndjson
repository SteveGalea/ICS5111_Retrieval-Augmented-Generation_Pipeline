{"summary": "corticosteroid administration for the treatment of various disorders is one of the main causes of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. average age of people affected by this intractable disease is quite young, at about 38 years old. patients were asked about their pain status (continuous or intermittent) at each of the 2 MRI examinations. coronal T1-weighted imaging and coronal short inversion recovery [STIR] were conducted on 2 machines. data analysis was carried out in SPSS software (version 12.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) Age of patients, time of pain onset, time of first MRI examination, time of final diagnosis, and steroid dosage were analyzed using Student t test. chi-squared test was used to analyze relationships between sex, pain status, pain location, and steroid type. aSigna Excite 1.5-T Imager (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) and a Philips 1.5-T Imager (Philips Medical Systems Netherlands B.V.) coronal T1-weighted sequences (repetition time [TR] 400/echo time [TE] 8.6/Ef) were obtained using a pelvic phased array coil. images (4-mm thick with 1-mm gaps and a 34 34-cm field of view) were obtained using a average time between steroid therapy and first MRI examination was 45.7 25.5 days (range, 10\u201394 days) at the second MRI examination, 12 hips had progressed to stage III, 22 hips had progressed to stage II, and 4 hips had progressed to stage I. osteonecrosis was detected in 44% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (32/72) by MRI approximately 3.1 months after high-dose glucocorticoid treatment. 29/34 patients showed a low-intensity band on T1-weighted images 6 to 12 weeks after renal transplantation. all patients were rescreened by MRI 4 years later, which revealed no new lesions. onset of ONFH may be assumed to occur 0 to 6 months after steroid use. presentation on MRI 1 to 6 months after steroid therapy. most asymptomatic ONFH cases will develop to symptomatic ONFH within 5 years. a barrier to revascularization of the bone marrow and the transport of the cytokines and other cellular mediators needed to remodel the bone. stress fracture occurs, resulting in femoral head collapse and hip osteoarthritis. the use of some drugs, such as lipid-lowering drugs, may reduce occurrence of necrosis. the proliferation response in the femoral head in this case was relatively weak. the sclerosis band was not clear, consistent with a destructive repair mode and rapid disease development. there are several limitations in this study."}
