{"summary": "first human cases were identified in 1954 in Nigeria and serosurveys found evidence of a broad geographic distribution for ZIKV. the first recognized ZIKV epidemic occurred in Yap State, Federated State of Micronesia in 2007. in 2013, a second epidemic occurred in French Polynesia with 28,000 cases reported. two angolan free-tail bats were experimentally inoculated with ZIKV. two of the straw-colored fruit bats were viremic and had seroconverted. two of the straw-colored fruit bats were viremic and had seroconverted. we inoculated Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) with ZIKV to examine virology, immunology and pathology of the infection. no overt clinical signs were detected, and substantial viremia or viruria was not evident. these results suggest that Jamaican fruit bats are unlikely to serve as amplification hosts but that a wildlife disease threat to bats. animal ID Titer AJ-z7 3200 AJ-z8 3200 AJ-z9 3200 Pos Control (uninfected bat) Neg Detection of viral RNA in urine and brain Quantitative probe-based reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on serum-inoculated vero cell supernatants. urine collected during time course study was similarly assayed. all samples were blindly read by one pathologist.

AJz-3 at 5 dpi with inflammation of the mandibular salivary gland had moderate immunoreactivity in the lumen. immunoreactivity in AJ-z5, 10 dpi cerebellum, polyclonal anti- ZIKV antibody highlighting viral antigen in cerebellum of infected bats compared to negative control Jamaican fruit bat. arrows highlighting mononuclear cells consistent with macrophages and leydig cells. macrophages (black long arrows) and leydig cells (short red arrows) in AJ-z8 showed co-localization (yellow) of ZIKV antigen in cytoplasm of activated microglial cells. increased microgliosis was noted in the cerebellum and hippocampus especially around dead neurons. time course study to better understand pathophysiology and chronology of events relating to viremia, viral tropism, replication and shedding of the virus in a new world bat species. the goal was to determine whether bats can be used as an animal model for ZIKV pathogenesis and to assess the possible role of bats in the new world. urine from one human patient was positive from the first time point (6 dpi) through 14 dpi and again on day 56. saliva from that same patient was positive from day nine through day 14 and again on day 49. uremia lasted longer compared to serum and viral loads in urine. mouse models have demonstrated ZIKV infection in both vasectomized and unvasectomized men. this suggests that ZIKV is sequestered in the testes and/or accessory sex glands. one study assessed the prostate found no virus, possibly due to differential expression of the receptor candidate. in the bats used in this experiment, evidence of ZIKV-induced pathology in the brain is consistent with what has been seen in human newborns and fetuses. the novel finding of co-localizing ZIKV antigen in bats lends support to the earlier evidence of microglial cell infection via Axl ligand bridging ZIKV particles to glial cells. animal studies did not show any evidence of disruption to BBB or viral distribution reminiscent of circumventricular distribution seen in alphavirus animal models. infection in this species recapitulates human infection, which is thought to start with infection of epidermal and dermal cells with subsequent dissemination to multiple organs including salivary glands. wild NHPs have antibody to ZIKV including several monkey species trapped near Ziika Forest [10], and wild and semi-captive orangutans in Borneo [49] Molecular epidemiology suggests animals play an important role in an enzootic cycle of ZIKV. bats are kept in a free flight room measuring 19\u2019w x 10\u2019l x 9\u2019h. Roosting baskets are hung from the ceiling throughout the room. ambient temperature is maintained between 20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C, with humidity between 50% and 70%. the virus stock titer is 3x107 plaque forming units (pfu) per ml of media. three male bats were anesthetized with 1% to 3% isoflurane. animals were placed on a heating pad to maintain body temperature and respirations continuously monitored. sc at the level of the cranial edge of the scapula was identified as AJ-z1 through AJ-z6. AJ-z3 and AJ-z4 were euthanized at two dpi. female bats were excluded from the study because they are prioritized for breeding to sustain and expand upon the colony. five dpi from AJ-z3, AJ-z4, AJ-z5 and AJ-z6; and ten dpi from AJ-z5 and AJ-z6. Urine volume ranged between 5 ul and 15 ul. blood collection and necropsy Bats were deeply anesthetized. serum and 1:10 diluted serum were inoculated onto vero cells to amplify any virus that may have been present at low levels. the remaining serum from three of the four bats was assayed directly for ZIKV RNA. plates were washed 5x with 0.05% Tween 20-PBS and blocked with SuperBlock T20 (TBS) Blocking Buffer. a convalescent human serum sample was used as a positive control. a two-fold serial dilution was used starting at 1:100 to 1:12800. a 5mm stainless steel bead (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used with a TissueLyser LT. one ml of TRIzol was added to urine to 5 to 15 l of urine. samples were mixed, incubated for 3 minutes and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. 80% confluency in a 48-well tissue culture plate with 10% FBS-DMEM. serum from each bat was diluted 10-fold in 2% FBS (Millipore Sigma) PBS. inoculum was removed and cells washed twice in sterile PBS. two-hundred nanograms of sample RNA was added to each reaction. a log10 dilution series of the standard was made and linear regression used to determine copy number equivalents of positive samples. rabbit antibody targets preM and E proteins of ZIKV. all slides were blindly read by a diplomat of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists. confocal microscopy Stained sections were imaged on a Ziess LSM 800. each field of view was imaged as a z-stack (8\u201310 planes,.5-m step size) each field of view was transformed into a single maximum projection image. zika virus strain PRVABC59 was isolated from an infected individual. three male bats were anesthetized with 1% to 3% isoflurane to effect with an oxygen flow rate of 1.5 L/min, administered with a gas mask. six male bats were anesthetized at 28 days post-inoculation (dpi) for the time course study. animals were placed in ventral recumbency. recovery followed the same protocol as for the pilot study bats. the bats were placed in a clear solo cup with the screen covering the top of the cup as a lid, and kept in place with a rubber band. if they urinated, bats were removed from the collection contraption and placed back in the cage without disrupting the urine. if they urinated, bats were removed from the collection contraption. a maximum blood volume of between 1 and 1.5mls is collected in a syringe. RTTs sat at room temperature for one hour to allow a clot to form. serum was removed from the clot, placed in a new microcentrifuge tube. a male bat was trapped from the colony and euthanized under the same protocol as the experimental infection bats. after a one hour incubation period, unbound virus was removed and replaced with 2% FBS-DMEM and incubated for a maximum of three days. RNA extraction TRIzol Reagent was used for RNA extraction from serum-cell supernatants, serum, urine and tissues. a 5mm stainless steel bead (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used with a TissueLyser LT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 50 Hz for 5 minutes. supernatant was removed and 75% molecular grade isopropanol was added to RNA pellet. RNA was resuspended in RNase-free water and stored at -80\u00b0C for future use. supernatant was removed and TRIzol extractions performed for RNA recovery. serum samples remained from AJ-z2 at 2 dpi, AJ-z3 and AJ-z4 at 5 dpi. no serum remained from AJ-z1. Tissues fixed in 10%-buffered formalin were cut in and submitted to Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CSU VDL, Fort Collins, CO) hematoxylin, eosin, hematoxylin, eosin and immunohistochemistry (IHC) tissues cut in on bats to assess for histology included: heart, lung, liver, kidney, testes, prostate, urinary bladder and brain. sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 for 15 min at room temperature. sections were blocked with 2% donkey and goat serum for 1 hour. sections were incubated in primary antibodies concurrently at room temperature."}
