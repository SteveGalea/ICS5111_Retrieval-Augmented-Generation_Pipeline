{"summary": "cellular heterogeneity occurs in mixed cell populations exhibiting different functional phenotypes that exist in a dynamic balance. fluctuations in viral protein expression result in the generation of small subpopulations of latent cells during human immunodeficiency virus replication. studies on the occurrence, development, and completion of the viral infection cycle have been confined to whole populations of infected cells. but studies on the occurrence, development, and completion of the viral infection cycle have been confined to whole populations of infected cells, yielding only the average response of the cellular population. cells in the G2/M phase were more amenable to viral infection. correlations between heterogeneity in cell size, number of inclusions, and cell cycle status all affect the infection and replication of FMDV. RESULTS Replication of FMDV varies significantly between individual infected cells. ratios of positive- to negative-strand viral RNA in single cells infected at an MOI of 0.001 were primarily between 10 and 40, ranged from 5 to 200, and averaged 16. similar distribution was observed in FMDV-infected cells at an MOI of 3 (Fig. 1E), which indicated significant variability in RNA synthesis. infected cells were divided into three groups based on their forward scatter (FSC) intensity and pulse width. cells were divided into high FSC intensity and pulse width (here \u201cFSC-high\u201d), FSC-medium, and FSC-low cell populations using FACS. similar results were obtained for cells infected at an MOI of 0.0001. medium, and -low cells accounted for 25%, 50%, and 25% of the cells. single cells infected at an MOI of 3 were analyzed for viral RNA content at 6 hpi via RT-qPCR. single cells were isolated 24 hpi and placed in a 96-well plate containing confluent normal cells. alterations were observed under a microscope at the indicated times. Ideally, we believe that the earlier the cell CPE occurs, the higher the progeny virus yield. the results were similar to those obtained in acutely FMDV-infected cells. the percentage of cells with more than 50 RNA copies was 53.1% in persistently infected cells. the percentage of cells with more than 50 RNA copies was 18.75% in the single cells. -medium, and -low cells sorted from BHK-21-Op51 cells were determined by performing plaque assays at each time point. cells from each group were sorted into a 24-well plate at 5,000 cells per well. cells from each group were sorted into a 24-well plate at 5,000 cells per well. similar results were obtained in cells infected with FMDV at MOIs 0.0001 and 0.001. infected cells were divided into three groups based on their SSC intensity and pulse width. infected cells were divided into three groups based on their SSC intensity and pulse width. single cells infected at an MOI of 3 were analyzed for viral RNA at 6 hpi. single cells were isolated 24 hpi and put into a 96-well plate containing confluent normal cells. viral RNA copy numbers were higher in single SSC-high cells. the number of inclusions was positively correlated with protein 3D levels and viral RNA copies during FMDV infection. single SSC-high, -medium, and -low cells were sorted and cocultured with BHK-21 cells. the ratio of infectivity-positive cells was highest in SSC-high cells, with a ratio of 47% at 120 hpi. cells sorted from BHK-21-Op51 cells were divided into SSC-high, -medium and -low populations. cells from each group were sorted into a 24-well plate at 5,000 cells per well with 1 ml of medium. if cell cycle heterogeneity affected FMDV replication, we will investigate the effects of cell cycle on FMDV replication. FMDV replication was higher in the G2/M phase than in other phases. at 24 hpi, the cells were collected and stained with propidium iodide (PI) cell cycle heterogeneity influences FMDV infection. n = 56. Friedman test, 2 = 97.879, df = 2, P 0.001; G0/G1 versus G2/M: ***, P 0.001; S versus G2/M: ***, P 0.001; G0/G1 versus S: ***, P 0.001. cells from each group were divided into FSC (A) and SSC (B) high, medium, and low populations. cells from each group were sorted into a 24-well plate at 100,000 cells per well with 1 ml of medium. after 24 h, cells were infected with FMDV at an MOI of 3. the adsorption of viral RNA was higher in FSC- and SSC-high cells than in FSC- and SSC-low cells. the results showed that large cells and cells with more inclusions were more favorable to viral adsorption. the expression of integrin receptors was higher in FSC- and SSC-high cells than in the FSC- and SSC-medium and -low cells. cells were 10 to 100 times higher than titers in G1/S and G0 phase cells. similar results were obtained in persistently infected cells. cells in the G2/M phase had the highest V6 expression levels. Flow cytometry of FMDV integrin receptors (v6) expressed on G0/G1, S, and G2/M cells. BHK-21 cells were incubated with (open histogram) or without (solid histogram) the indicated anti-integrin antibody followed by incubation with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit isotype-specific secondary antibody. single BHK cells infected with FMDV were sorted, and RNA levels were assessed. we found >106-fold differences in the number of positive-strand viral RNAs per single cell and average positive-strand RNA copy number values of 43,400, 69,700, and 139,000 for the three multiplicity of infection values. single-cell analysis and distribution of viral RNA levels in FMDV-infected cells. a population of adherent BHK-21 cells was infected with FMDV at different MOIs. the cells were sorted into 96-well PCR plates by FACS. high FSC intensity and pulse width (here \u201cFSC-high\u201d), FSC-medium, and FSC-low cell populations using FACS. the percentages of FMDV protein 3D-positive cells as determined by FACS in the FSC-high, -medium, and -low cell populations were 83.1%, 34.4%, and 18.9%, respectively. a larger cell size corresponded to a higher viral positive rate. cells were infected at an MOI of 0.0001 and their intracellular viral RNA content at 24 hpi was analyzed via RT-qPCR. single cells infected at an MOI of 3 were analyzed for viral RNA content at 6 hpi via RT-qPCR. ideally, we believe that the earlier the cell CPE occurs, the higher the progeny virus yield. the ratio of infectivity-positive cells in the FSC-high population at 24 hpi was 34%. similar trend was observed at 120 hpi. persistently infected cells released virions after prolonged incubation. FSC-medium and -low cells released a small number of virions during the early culture period. large, persistently infected cells contained more infectious virions than smaller cells. cell growth heterogeneity is a common feature associated with an increase or decrease in inclusions. to this end, we divided FMDV-infected cells into three groups based on their side scatter (SSC) and pulse width. calnexin and GM130 expressed in SSC-high, -medium, and -low cells accounted for 25%, 50%, and 25% of the cells. single cells infected at an MOI of 3 were analyzed for viral RNA at 6 hpi. single cells were isolated 24 hpi and put into a 96-well plate containing confluent normal cells. viral RNA copy numbers were higher in single SSC-high cells than in single SSC-high and -low cells. the ratio of infectivity-positive cells was highest in SSC-high cells. the results suggested that the number of inclusions in host cells was closely related to FMDV infection during acute infections. persistently FMDV-infected cells with more inclusions contained more viral RNA and released more infectious virions. cells in the G2/M phase had the greatest number of 3D-positive cells. single cells in different cell cycle phases were sorted, and viral RNA copies in each cell were detected. the peak number of copies/cell in the G2/M phase ranged from 103 to 104. at 24 and 6 hpi, the cells were collected and stained with propidium iodide (PI) the numbers of cells in the G0/G1 (R6), S (R7), and G2/M (R8) phases are shown. at 24 hpi, the cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. error bars represent standard deviations of triplicates. effects of host cell size and inclusion number heterogeneity on FMDV adsorption. cells from each group were divided into FSC (C) and SSC (D) high, medium, and low populations. cells from each group were sorted into a 96-well plate at 10,000 cells per well. after 24 h, cells were infected with FMDV at an MOI of 3. the expression of FMDV integrin receptors was higher in FSC- and SSC-high cells than in the FSC- and SSC-medium and -low cells. the expression of gAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase dehydrogenase) and -actin exhibited similar trends, suggesting larger cells or those with more inclusions contain more protein. BHK-21 cells were grown to 70% confluence in complete medium and then for 16 h in the presence of the indicated cell cycle inhibitors. G0 cells were obtained by growing cells in medium without FBS. we analyzed the correlation among the three heterogeneous cell populations. the mean values for FSC and SSC in G2/M phase cells were higher than in other phases (Fig. 9B and C) the mean FSC value was higher in SSC-high cells and vice versa (Fig. 9D and E) poliovirus-infected cells studied differences in IAV replication using single cells. we found that intracellular viral RNA levels can span 3 orders of magnitude and differ in single-cell viral genome segments (25). large cells and cells with more inclusions contained more viral proteins and viral RNA copies than smaller cells and those with fewer inclusions. correlations between virus and host cell cycle have also been studied. infectious bronchitis virus and HCV induce G2/M cell cycle arrest. murine hepatitis virus and some severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus induce G0/G1 phase arrest (8, 9, 26, 27) adsorption, entry, virus uncoating, genome replication and translation, assembly, and release (35) is important to determine which stage of the FMDV life cycle is affected by host cell heterogeneity. recent studies have shown that FMDV adsorbs to host cells. protein, DNA, membrane structures, and organelles prior to division expand the cellular volume to contain these components. thus, the cells are larger and contain more inclusions in the G2/M phase prior to division than in other phases (39). the mean SSC value was higher in FSC-high cells and vice versa. however, there are some cells with very low SSC values among FSC-high cells, and vice versa. the cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the cells were lysed as previously described (15). BHK-21 cells infected with FMDV at an MOI of 0.0001 or 3 were divided into three groups based on their FSC intensity and pulse width or their SSC and pulse width. the SSC-high, -medium, and -low populations accounted for 25, 50, and 25% of gated cells, respectively. a 10-fold dilution series of in vitro-transcribed positive- and negative-strand RNA standards were analyzed concurrently and used to construct a standard curve. the RT-qPCRs were performed using a bio-Rad CFX96 instrument. cDNA was synthesized at 37\u00b0C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. orescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h at room temperature. the cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using FACS. the cells were triedpsinized, washed twice with PBS, fixed in 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol overnight at 4\u00b0C, and resuspended in staining buffer (50 g/ml PI [Sigma], 20 g/ml RNase in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. at least 2 104 cells from each sample were counted. the cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. cells were used to propagate viral stocks and to measure viral titers in plaque and 50% tissue culture infectious dose assays. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the Rever TraAce qPCR RT kit (Toyobo) and 125 nM strand-specific reverse transcription primers (positive- and negative-strand RT, 5\u2032-GAACACATTCTTTACACCAGGAT-3\u2032) in a 5-l reaction volume. a 10-fold dilution series of in vitro-transcribed positive- and negative-strand RNA standards were analyzed concurrently and used to construct a standard curve. cDNA was synthesized at 37\u00b0C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. the cells were cubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for 1 h at room temperature. flow cytometry was used to confirm cell cycle inhibitors or serum starvation. cells were triedpsinized, washed twice with PBS, fixed in 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol overnight at 4\u00b0C, and resuspended in staining buffer (50 g/ml PI [Sigma], 20 g/ml RNase in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. at least 2 104 cells from each sample were counted."}
