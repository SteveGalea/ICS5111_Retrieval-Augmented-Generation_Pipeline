{"summary": "a large number of PEDV infections occurred unexpectedly in many Korean pig farms, which had a significant economic impact on swine farms. the PEDV genome is composed of at least seven open reading frames (ORFs), encoding three non-structural proteins (ORF1a, 1b, and ORF3) and four structural proteins; spike (S), envelope, membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. the N protein binds to viral RNA and provides a structural basis for the helical nucleocapsid [6]. the new mutant PEDV isolates will allow study of PED pathogenesis, effects of disinfectants, and the development of antigenic or serological diagnostic assays. a live-attenuated or inactivated vaccine to prevent PED outbreaks. small intestinal tissues were used to generate a 10% homogenate. the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 m membrane. the cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics. if no CPEs were observed 5 days after harvesting the supernatant, the cells were fixed in 80% cold acetone and subjected to an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) if no CPEs were detected, the sample was considered negative for the virus. the eluted RNA was subjected to conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the i-TGEV/PEDV detection kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Korea) the PCR products were visualized via 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. RT-PCR was performed in a reaction mixture containing 10 L denatured RNA, 1 L each primer (50 pmol), 10 L 5 buffer (12.5 mM MgCl2), 2 L dNTP mix, 2 L enzyme mix (reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase) and 24 L distilled water (Qiagen, Germany) the cycling profile consisted of cDNA synthesis at 42\u00b0C for 30 min. the sequences of purified plasmids were analyzed by using the MJ Research PTC-225 Peltier Thermal Cycler and ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kits with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. the fluorescently labeled fragments were purified from the unincorporated terminators by applying an ethanol precipitation protocol. two pigs were orally administered a 1 mL dose of 103.0 TCID50/mL QIAP1401-P70 via 5 mL pipette. the remaining two pigs received no treatment. pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs of PEDV infection. small intestinal tissues were used to generate a 10% homogenate. the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 m membrane. the cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics. if no CPEs were observed 5 days after harvesting the supernatant, the vero cells were fixed in 80% cold acetone and subjected to an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) if no CPEs were detected, the sample was considered negative for the virus. eluted RNA was subjected to conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the i-TGEV/PEDV detection kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Korea) the PCR products were visualized via 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.

PEDV particles from the QIAP1401 strain purified by gradient sucrose density centrifugation were examined by EM. the viral particles were 80 to 120 nm in diameter with crown-shaped projections. morphological appearance typical of Coronaviridae. the phylogenetic tree was constructed based on aligned nucleotide sequences obtained by using the neighbor-joining method. the complete S, ORF3, M, and N genes were sequenced after passages 3, 20, 40, and 60, respectively. no deletions were detected in the four structural proteins after 60 passages. all feces obtained from the four piglets at 1 to 6 DPI were positive for PEDV as determined by both RT-PCR and the rapid detection kit (panel A in Fig. 5). the dead piglets were necropsied on the day they died and showed shortened and fused small intestinal villi on microscopic examination. the PEDV antigen in feces was not detected at 11 DPI in growing pigs. a total of 669 cases of the disease occurred between 2000 and 2015. two large epidemics were observed in 2003 and 2014. one of the new PEDV isolates has been used to develop a vaccine candidate for live and inactivated PEDV vaccines. new vaccines are needed because the PEDV vaccine based on the SM98 or DR13 strains might be less related antigenically to the re-emerged PEDV strains. the viral titer of QIAP1401 reached 107.0 TCID50/mL by passage 70, indicating that the QIAP1401-P70 strain was PEDV-seronegative 3-day-old piglets and 11-week-old growing pigs were administered the QIAP1401-P70 strain orally to investigate the pathogenicity of the strain. all four of the 3-day-old piglets shed the virus in their feces, developed severe watery diarrhea from 1 to 6 DPI, and died at 4, 5 or 6 DPI. the QIAP1401 strain is strongly pathogenic to 3-day-old piglets. it could be used as a challenge strain to examine the efficacy of inactivated PEDV vaccines."}
