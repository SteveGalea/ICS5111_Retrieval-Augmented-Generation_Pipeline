{"summary": "in the 20th century there were three notable influenza pandemics. the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d (H1N1 virus) in 1918 and 1919, which resulted in approximately 50 million deaths worldwide1. the \u201cAsian flu\u201d (H2N2 virus) in 1957-1958, which resulted in 1-2 million deaths worldwide2. the \u201cHong Kong flu\u201d (H3N2 virus) in 1968, which resulted in 1 million deaths worldwide. the severity and suddenness of these burdens can create ethical tensions along a number of fronts. healthcare workers will encounter challenging ethical dilemmas involving their professional duties to patients and their strong competing obligation to protect and care for themselves and their family. the employers of these workers will have obligations to minimize risks to their employees. CDC sponsored meetings in africa, Asia, Latin America, and the eastern Mediterranean to explore various cultural perspectives relevant to pandemic influenza preparedness and response. the key objectives for all four meetings were to identify cultural-specific ethical challenges in pandemic influenza detection and control, and explore approaches for addressing these ethical challenges. the africa meeting was attended by 71 people, including representatives from 12 african countries. the Asian meeting was attended by 30 people, including representatives from 9 countries. the Latin America meeting was attended by 33 people. in the africa meeting, participants met in small groups to discuss pre-developed case studies addressing the topics of non-pharmaceutical interventions, obligations of healthcare workers, and equitable access to treatment and prophylaxis. participants wrote short narratives about the ethical issues they thought would be important in a pandemic response. information was presented on the 2007 WHO18 and 2007 CDC14 ethics guidance documents as a starting point for discussing how ethical considerations may differ. participants met in small groups to discuss pre-developed case studies addressing the topics of non-pharmaceutical interventions, obligations of healthcare workers, and equitable access to treatment and prophylaxis. results For each of the organizing topics below, we first present some common themes discussed at the four meetings. participants at all meetings affirmed that their cultures do not tolerate corruption and indicated that a lack of transparency raises suspicions of corrupt dealings. participants at all meetings affirmed that their cultures do not tolerate corruption. participants agreed that traditional cultures expect leaders to seek input from those they lead, through elder councils and similar institutions. participants noted that traditional healers include traditional healers who serve as both recipients of and conduits for information. participants stressed that community participation and cooperation will be crucial during a pandemic influenza response, particularly for migrants or minorities who are already stigmatized. participants discussed the need to establish a clear understanding of who will make what decisions during an emergency, how guidelines will be established, and the importance of considering multiple perspectives. participants agreed that because of the cultural and regional variations, a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to any planning and response activity is unlikely to be optimal and should be questioned and challenged. each of the countries represented in the Asian meeting had a pandemic flu preparedness plan that addressed allocation issues and maintained a national stockpile of antiviral drugs. in most cases, biological vulnerability determined priority; thus, the very young or very old, pregnant women, and immune-compromised individuals tended to be prioritized to receive antiviral drugs. as Asian cultures exhibit more hierarchy than those in the west, more honor is granted to the elderly, senior staff, royalty, and public service personnel. participants at the Asian meeting questioned whether their country plans address the challenges that certain geographical conditions may place on the equitable distribution of resources. they emphasized the importance of including all sectors of society, including the private sectors, migrants, and minorities in public health decision-making process. participants stressed isolation and quarantine measures will be more difficult to enforce in rural compared to urban areas in africa. participants noted that these public health measures have been successfully employed in rural areas in prior epidemics in Africa. participants at the Latin American and Eastern Mediterranean meetings reflected on the long history of human rights abuses in their countries. this made them more likely to view use of social distancing measures as something that should be considered with great caution. participants at the Asian meeting discussed the role of healthcare workers during a pandemic. participants agreed that healthcare facilities and governments had an ethical obligation to adequately and equitably provide personal protective equipment to their employees. some participants believed that healthcare workers have the right to refuse treatment to patients if the provider fears exposing their own family. participants pointed out that no country, developed or undeveloped, has eliminated poverty. prevalence of poverty affects not only individuals, but institutions and systems. participants thought it is in the best interest of resource rich countries to help build capacity of poorer countries to conduct surveillance and disease control. participants at the eastern Mediterranean meeting affirmed that their cultures do not tolerate corruption and indicated that a lack of transparency raises suspicions of corrupt dealings. participants at all meetings affirmed that their cultures do not tolerate corruption and indicated that a lack of transparency raises suspicions of corrupt dealings. participants agreed that traditional cultures expect leaders to seek input from those they lead, through elder councils and similar institutions. a wide variety of local and international non-governmental organizations are active in resource poor countries in africa seeking to meet the populations\u2019 most basic needs. participants at the Latin American meeting stressed that community participation and cooperation will be crucial during a pandemic influenza response. participants stressed the importance of the media and health authorities in communicating health information and avoiding panic. participants also stressed the importance of the media and health authorities in communicating health information and avoiding panic. a pandemic flu preparedness plan addressed allocation issues and maintained a national stockpile of antiviral drugs. the ethical imperative to respond to pandemic influenza may fall below that of addressing hyperendemic fatal diseases. in many Asian contexts, such prioritization is viewed as a social obligation. one participant described a shortage of N95 face masks during the SARS epidemic. participants felt the government had a duty to enforce price controls in order to ensure an adequate supply. one government instituted licensing for antiretroviral distribution to put a ceiling on the costs of the medications. some Asian perspectives on ethical distribution differed by religion. social distancing was widely accepted as an important tool in a pandemic influenza response. but participants warned of the many factors and challenges that complicate this traditional public health measure. these include socio-economic factors (eg, densely populated settings), and cultural factors (eg, family duty, funeral rituals) isolation wards do not have security guards, and nursing staff are not able to add policing to their already heavy workload. participants at the african meeting reflected on the long history of human rights abuses in their countries. participants discussed challenges related to displacement of health workers during post-election conflict, traditional or cultural practices that may increase the risk of disease spread. a complicating factor in many african countries is the presence of large numbers of health-care-related NGOs from a variety of countries. host governments have little authority to demand their assistance. some participants believed that healthcare workers have the right to refuse treatment to patients if the provider fears exposing their own family. others felt that doctors do not have the right to refuse treatment because of their oaths and duties as physicians. participants agreed that during a pandemic, collaboration is critical, because diseases respect no boundary. the Asian meeting participants expressed concern about specimen sharing. During outbreaks of SARS and H5N1 influenza, for example, china shared its specimens with countries around the world for research and vaccine development. participants said collaboration and communication about disease transmission requires a transparency that can be at odds with the cultural value of 'protecting honor' participants from these four distinct regions reaffirmed the importance of the five key ethical issues framed by WHO. participants acknowledged the importance of social distancing as a tool to limit disease transmission, but also recognized the difficulties associated with this measure. addressing procedural ethics according to established international norms can assist with overcoming cultural differences within the context of global disease pandemic, political organization or local context. addressing procedural ethics according to established international norms can assist with overcoming cultural differences. a more compelling explanation lies in a cross-cultural continuity regarding the importance of combating the health threats that would result from a pandemic event. a simpler and more compelling explanation lies in a cross-cultural continuity regarding the importance of combating the health threats that would result from a pandemic event. health in this view and as a matter of common human understanding is seen as a gateway, if not precondition, for developing other human functions and capabilities. it is a matter, then, not only of ethical theory but also of practical human life that pandemics could be expected to elicit similar responses across cultures. the same applies to the discussions generated by the regional meetings described in this document. they affirm the notion that cultural differences notwithstanding, people and countries will come together to combat the health threat a pandemic influenza poses to all. funding was used for travel-related expenses of all participants to participate in one or more of the meetings. the meetings were considered routine public health practice and not research per se. pandemics create a global predicament that can unite countries around the shared value of health, rather than divide on the basis of cultural differences."}
