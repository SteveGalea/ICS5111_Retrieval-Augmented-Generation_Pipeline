{"summary": "the causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that belongs to the family Arteriviridae. there are two known PRRSV genotypes, European (type I) and North American (type II), with varying inter- and intragenotypic, genetic, and antigenic diversity. inactivated virus does not downregulate secretion of the important innate cytokine interferon (IFN); such an inactivation procedure preserves the viral neutralizing epitopes. however, the delivery of inactivated virus alone in a vaccine formulation is not efficacious, and it needs coupling with a potent adjuvant/s. soluble vaccine antigens entrapped in PLGA NPs of up to 5 m in size have been shown to protect encased antigen/drug from enzymatic or ionic degradation in vivo. a single-dose of NP-entrapped inactivated PRRSV vaccine delivered intranasally to pigs elicits anti-PRRSV immune responses. PRRSV strain VR23322 was used in vaccine preparation. preparation of vaccine antigens and PLGA nanoparticle-based vaccine formulations PRRSV strain VR23322 was grown and UV-killed/inactivated. emulsion was divided into two tubes. 11.5 mL of 2% polyvinyl alcohol and 1 mL of 12.5% poloxamer 188 solution were added. NPs were suspended in 5 mL of 5% sucrose solution and freeze-dried for 18\u201320 hours. the pellet containing NP-KAg was resuspended in 1 mL PBS. the harvested supernatants were collected at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 days. the remaining NP-KAg was lysed using lysis buffer to recover the protein. pigs were randomly divided into one of the ten groups (three pigs/group) each dose of PRRSV vaccine had either 100 (low) or 500 (high) mg of semipurified viral protein equivalent to approximately 0.5106 or 2.5106 50% tissue-culture infective dose (TCID50) of killed PRRSV respectively, and adjuvant M tb WCL (1 mg/dose/pig) 500 g of KAg + M. tb WCL 5 100 g of KAg + NP-M. tb WCL 5 100 g of NP-KAg + NP-M. tb WCL 6 100 g of NP-KAg + M. tb WCL 6 100 g of NP-KAg + M. tb WCL 6 100 g of NP-KAg + M. tb WCL 6 100 g plasma samples were coated with preitrated semipurified MN184 Ags (5 g/mL) or with PRRSV-recombinant N, M, or GP5 proteins (5 g/mL) a mean optical density (OD) value of 30 tenfold-diluted PRRSV-negative plasma samples plus twice the standard deviation was considered the positive-negative cutoff. the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the plasma sample that showed an OD value above the cutoff OD the plate-bound virus-specific IgG1 and IgG2 were detected using mouse antipig IgG1 and IgG2 (AbD Serotec; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) the reaction was developed using 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate and stopped using 1 M phosphoric acid. PBMCs were first surface-labeled using pig lymphocyte-specific mAbs. cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with a cell-permeabilization buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. cells were washed and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated pig IFN. twofold serially diluted plasma samples were incubated with one of the PRRSV strains: MN184 (250 TCID50), PRRSV 1-4-4 (accession #10-16734)40 (100 TCID50), or SD03-1541 (200 TCID50). statistical analysis Data are expressed as means standard error of mean of three pigs. PRRSV strain VR23322 was grown and UV-killed/inactivated. 13,30 PLGA NPs entrapping KAg (NP-KAg) or M. tb WCL (NP-M. tb WCL) were prepared using a double-emulsion method (w/o/w) as previously described. the pellet containing the NPs was washed in sterile distilled water for 30 minutes three times. NPs were suspended in 5 mL of 5% sucrose solution and freeze-dried for 18\u201320 hours. the lyophilized powder was stored at 20\u00b0C. a total of 30 pigs were randomly divided into one of the ten groups. every dose of PRRSV vaccine had either 100 (low) or 500 (high) mg of semipurified viral protein equivalent to approximately 0.5106 or 2.5106. 106 50% tissue-culture infective dose (TCID50) of killed PRRSV respectively, and adjuvant M tb WCL (1 mg/dose/pig) except pigs in group 1, all other groups were challenged on postvaccination day 28 with the virulent heterologous North American PRRSV (type II) strain MN184 (5 105 TCID50/pig) 500 g of NP-KAg + NP-M. tb WCL 6 100 g of NP-KAg + M. tb WCL 6 100 g of NP-KAg + M. tb WCL 6 100 g of NP-KAg + M. tb WCL 6 100 g of NP-KAg + M. tb WCL 6 100 g of NP-KAg + M. tb WCL 6 100 PRRSV-specific IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies in the plasma samples were analyzed as described previously. plasma samples (1:100) were added to PRRSV Ags-coated ELISA plates and incubated. plates were washed four times, serially twofold diluted in NH4CN (5\u20130.313 M), and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. the reaction was developed using 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate. the reaction was stopped using 1 M phosphoric acid and read at OD450. 4106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with semipurified killed PRRSV Ags (10 g/mL) immunostained cells were washed and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated pig IFN or its isotype control mAb. cells were washed and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated pig IFN or its isotype control mAb in 0.1% saponin containing fluorescence-activated cell-sorting buffer. a group 2 versus group 3; b group 2 versus group 4; c group 2 versus group 5; d group 2 versus group 6; e group 3 versus group 5; f group 3 versus group 5; g group 3 versus group 6; h group 4 versus group 5; i group 4 versus group 6; and j group 5 versus group 6. differential surface charges of entrapped proteins did not influence electrostatic potential of finally formed different NPs. in freshly prepared NP-KAg, the burst release was 9.5%, and after 24 hours of reconstitution, 30.5% of protein was released. after 30 days, 61% of entrapped vaccine protein was released. in stored NP-KAg (1 year old), 13.6% burst release and 76% of released proteins at 30 days were detected. this suggests that PLGA NPs stably retain the entrapped vaccine proteins for more than 1 year. this suggests that PLGA NPs stably retain the entrapped vaccine proteins for more than 1 year. group 6 pigs had significantly higher virus-specific IgG titer compared to group 2 at all the tested PC days. we evaluated PRRSV-specific IgG response against recombinant structural proteins, and found comparable levels of IgG titers in all the pig groups against viral surface glycoproteins. NP-KAg induced a balanced Th1 and Th2 response. in pigs, higher levels of IgG subisotypes IgG1 and IgG2 indicate a Th2- and Th1-biased response. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination and challenged with PRRSV MN184. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination. high-avidity PRRSV-specific antibodies were produced in pigs vaccinated with adjuvanted NP-KAg. plasma samples collected from pigs of 100 g per pig vaccine dose (A\u2013C) or 500 g dose category (E\u2013G) followed by PC 6 and PC 15 (day of necropsy) cross-protective PRRSV-neutralization response was elicited by adjuvanted NP-KAg Neutralizing antibodies may play an important role in the clearance of PRRSV infection. a few reports have debated the importance of VN antibodies in PRRSV clearance due to the absence of viremia in some pigs prior to detection of VN antibodies in serum. in group 6 pigs, the high-dose vaccine elicited a steady increase in VN secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 by restimulated PBMCs of the high-dose group 6 pigs was significantly reduced compared to group 2 animals. pigs were vaccinated (100 or 500 g per pig dose) or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination and challenged with PRRSV MN184. PBMCs isolated from vaccinated, virus-challenged pigs were immunostained and analyzed to determine the frequency of lymphoid and myeloid immune cells. PRRSV antigen-specific recall IFN response was not detectable in the CD4+ lymphocyte subset. 4+CD8+ cells were significantly higher in group 6 pigs compared to groups 3 and 5. an increased frequency of activated T cells was detected compared to group 2 pigs. similar trends in IFN+ cells were observed in the low-dose pigs. each bar indicates the average frequency of indicated cells from three pigs + SEM. the unpaired t-test was applied to compare the data of only A\u2013C. indicated activated (CD25+) lymphocyte subsets were analyzed in the PBMCs on the day of necropsy. each number is an average percentage of indicated immune cell frequency of three pigs. the dendritic cell (DC)-rich population was significantly higher only in group 6 pigs that received a high dose of vaccine compared to other tested groups. in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs, detectable replicating PRRSV was completely absent in the blood of virus-challenged pigs. sham- and entrapped NPs were circular in shape. 85% of sham NPs, 92% of NP-M. tb WCL, and 78% of NP-KAg were in size range of 400\u2013700 nm. in vitro characterization of (PRRSV) KAg-entrapped poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles. image taken with Philips XL30-FEG SEM at 20 kV with 30,000 magnification. NP-KAg (1 year old), 13.6% burst release and 76% of released proteins at 30 days were detected. this suggests that PLGA NPs stably retain the entrapped vaccine proteins for more than 1 year. PRRSV infects only pigs, and the virus mainly infects PAM. group 6 pigs had significantly higher virus-specific IgG titer compared to group 2 at all the tested PC days. PRRSV nucleocapsid (N)-protein specific IgG antibodies, however, were significantly higher in group 6 pigs compared to other tested groups. ocapsid protein, KAg, killed/inactivated antigen; NP-KAg, nanoparticle-entrapped inactivated PRRSV vaccine; PC, postchallenge; IgG, immunoglobulin G; ELISA, standard error of mean; chal, challenge; vaccin, vaccination; WCL, whole-cell lysate (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) adjuvanted NP-KAg elicited Th1 and Th2-balanced immune response in pigs. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination and challenged with PRRSV MN184. plasma samples collected from pigs of 100 g per pig vaccine dose (A\u2013C) or 500 g dose category (E\u2013G) followed by PC 6 and PC 15 (day of necropsy) were analyzed for avidity of PRRSV-specific IgG by ELISA. cross-protective PRRSV-neutralization response was elicited by adjuvanted NP-KAg Neutralizing antibodies may play an important role in the clearance of PRRSV infection. a few reports have debated the importance of VN antibodies in PRRSV clearance due to the absence of viremia in some pigs prior to detection of VN antibodies in serum. IL-6 by restimulated PBMCs of the high-dose group 6 pigs was significantly reduced compared to group 2 animals. secretion of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 in a recall response was significantly reduced in group 6 pigs, compared to groups 2 and 3 at either vaccine dose. pigs were immunostained and analyzed to determine the frequency of lymphoid and myeloid immune cells, and IFN+ lymphocyte subsets. PRRSV antigen-specific recall IFN response was not detectable in the CD4+ lymphocyte subset. significantly increased IFN+ T-cell population in group 6 pigs was detected compared to other groups. similar trends in IFN+ cells were observed in the low-dose pigs. populations \u2013 macrophages-rich population (CD172+CD163+SLA-II+) (L and T), and DC-rich population (CD172+CD11c+SLA-II+) (M and U) were analyzed. each bar indicates the average frequency of indicated cells from three pigs + SEM. pigs were vaccinated or unvaccinated with indicated vaccine and adjuvant combination and challenged with PRRSV MN184. each number is an average percentage of indicated immune cell frequency of three pigs. the dendritic cell (DC)-rich population (CD172+CD11c+SLAII+) was significantly higher only in group 6 pigs that received a high dose of vaccine compared to all other tested groups. in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs, detectable replicating PRRSV (but not viral RNA) was absent. lowercase letters indicate statistically significant differences between the two indicated groups of pigs. PRRSV, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus; KAg, killed/inactivated antigen; NP-KAg, nanoparticle-entrapped inactivated PRRSV vaccine; RNA, ribonucleic acid; PC, postchallenge; qRT-PCR. the size range of NP-KAg was 400\u2013700 nm in diameter. this is ideal for uptake by mucosal M cells and APCs. a similar modified NP vaccine containing human immunodeficiency peptides elicits enhanced and prolonged IgG and IgA antibody responses. rapid uptake of NP-KAg vaccine by PLGA NPs was noticed suggesting the ability of PLGA NPs to deliver vaccine Ags rapidly and efficiently to target cells. only mock and KAg vaccinated pigs had irregular fever with reduced feed intake during the first 2 weeks postchallenge. absence of detectable replicating PRRSV from PC day 6 associated with a threefold reduction in viral RNA load. increased levels of PRRSV VN titers, associated with increased virus-specific antibody response and enhanced antibody avidity with time. in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs, VN titers were detectable by 1 week postchallenge and later steadily increased. NP-based vaccines have been shown to drive either Th1\u2013Th2-balanced or Th1-biased responses. incomplete virus clearance and inadequate immune response were detected in pigs coadministered with both vaccine Ags and adjuvant-entrapped NPs. a dose of PLGA NP-based vaccine could be reduced by as much as 63 times compared to administration of a Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant emulsified vaccine. a recent study has estimated that a dose of PLGA NP-based vaccine could be reduced by as much as 63 times compared to challenge PRRSV in lymphoid tissues. fractionation of M. tb WCL to identify important component/s."}
