{"summary": "mechanically ventilated SARS patients were sedated and received mechanical ventilation in the isolation intensive care unit (ICU) they were divided into two groups either with or without pneumothorax. the mortality rate was similar between the groups. peiris et al. identified a high incidence of pneumomediastinum (12%) in a general population of SARS patients. lew and Fowler also observed a high incidence of pneumothorax (20 to 34%) in mechanically ventilated SARS patients. patients with pre-existing pneumothorax or chest tube thoracostomy excluded. primary study outcome variable defined as radiographic evidence of new-onset pneumothorax at 30 days after ventilator use. patients were censored at the first pneumothorax event, at the time of death, liberation from mechanical ventilation or discharge from the SARS ICU. non-parametric tests were chosen because of the small sample size in the pneumothorax group. p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. 1.59 1.10 2.51 0.29 0.09 Highest respiratory rate 34.65 5.19 40.80 7.08 0.06 Lowest PaO2/FiO2 ratio 210.1 123.8 65.8 24.3 0.02 Highest PaCO2 49.9 17.4 80.1 12.3 0.004 ALI/ARDS (%) 24 (66%) 4 (80%) 1 Liberation from ventilator (%) at 30 days 11(31) 0 0.29 Data are presented as mean standard deviation. the overall survival rate was 59% at 30 days after mechanical ventilation. there were no significant differences in pressure, volume and mortality rate between the patients without and with pneumothorax. the presence of ARDS is the major independent risk factor of barotraumas. this may explain the lower incidence of pneumothorax in our study. this may explain the lower incidence of pneumothorax in our study. a thin-section computed tomographic study was done by Joynt and colleagues on the late stage of ARDS (more than 2 weeks after onset) caused by SARS. patients with pneumothorax were also associated with a more pronounced hypoxemia, with lower PaO2/FiO2 during hospitalization compared with those without pneumothorax (65.8 versus 210.1) a study with a larger sample size may demonstrate statistical significance. the correlation between clinical characteristics and pneumothorax may be considered as a deterioration of respiratory function in mechanically ventilated SARS patients developing pneumothorax. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors thank all health care workers of isolation SARS ICU in the veterans general hospital."}
