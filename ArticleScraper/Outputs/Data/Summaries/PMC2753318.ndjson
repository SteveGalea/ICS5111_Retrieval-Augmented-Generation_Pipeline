{"summary": "BDV G is an extensively glycosylated protein that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 84,000 to 94,000 kilodaltons (kDa) it is post-translationally cleaved by the cellular subtilisin-like protease furin into two subunits, a 41 kDa amino terminal protein GP1 and a 43 kDa carboxyl terminal protein GP2. studies demonstrate existence of avian reservoir of diverse bornaviruses. it is yet to be established whether bornaviruses cause overt disease in humans. correlative evidence exists linking BDV infection with neuropsychiatric disorders. a peptide-generated antibody was used to demonstrate the presence of GP1 in virions. the uncleaved product G accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear region. there are conflicting results as to the presence of uncleaved G in virions. class I viral fusion proteins have an aromatic amino acid (aa) rich pre-membrane domain. the post-fusion forms of class I viral fusion proteins have an extended amino terminal helix (N-helix, HR1) and a carboxyl terminal helix (C-helix, HR2) that mediate trimerization. extended helices in post-fusion forms of rhabdovirus G and herpesvirus gB are involved in trimerization. fusion proteins of group I nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV) of the Baculoviridae and members of the Thogotovirus genus of the Orthomyxoviridae together form the GP64 superfamily. al fever virus structural G (P32595) and nonstructural G (P32596), novirhabdovirus: infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (CAA61498), novirhabdovirus: lettuce necrosis yellows virus glycoprotein (LYP425091); rhabdovirus: rice yellow stunt virus (AB011257) and rhabdovirus: Taastrup virus. figures were drawn using Freehand (Macromedia) Sequences Sequence and structural comparisons were performed for Borna disease virus strain V glycoprotein isolated from a horse. additional bornavirus G sequences used in the analyses included ABH03174, CAC70658 (horse), AAL49985 (sheep), ABH03169 (rabbit), and AAA91195 (human). TMpred is based on a statistical analysis of TMbase, a database of naturally occurring transmembrane glycoproteins. results Similar sequences and common structural/functional motifs are located collinearly in VSV and BDV G. the PHD algorithm predicts protein secondary structure from multiple sequence alignments by a system of neural networks. this algorithm predicts that there is a region that forms an extended -helix in BVD G and other bornaviruses. a prominent feature of class III VFPs is an extended -helix beginning near the carboxyl terminal third of the ectodomain (helix F in domain III, Fig 1). a class III nomenclature is used here that can apply to both class II and III VFPs. the current class III VFP numbering also combines two interacting domains into domain III. UA represents \"hinge\" aa not assigned to domains in the prior scheme. a region in bornavirus G (BVD aa 66-183) with 12 cysteine residues is likely to represent the fusion domain of BDV G. a region in bornavirus G (BVD aa 66-183) with 12 cysteine residues, plus 2 sequences with positive WWIHS scores is likely to represent the fusion domain of BDV G. the proposed domains of bornavirus G are collinear with analogous domains of herpesvirus gB, the other - albeit much longer - prototypic class III VFP. similar arrangement of putative domain structures of BDV G, VSV G, THOV GP and AcMNPV GP64 and herpesvirus gB is as in Fig. 1. a high level of glycosylation does not preclude the possibility that BDV G is a class III VFP. most beta and gamma-herpesviruses, including CMV and EBV, have a furin cleavage site prior to the extended helix. putative structures in BDV G are depicted as in VSV G. dicysteine linkages are modeled so that all cysteine bonding occurs between the putative domains as occurs in both class II and III VFP. the structural model presented here is not intended as a definitive structural prediction. it is possible that in a minor subset of G may be cross-linked via cysteine binding such that the GP1 and 2 subunits are covalently bound. the modeling does establish that feasible structures exist that are consistent with the secondary structure predictions and with the assignment of BDV G as a class III VFP. two shorter helices corresponding to helices G and H of VSV G are also predicted by the PHD algorithm in BVD G. -helices predicted by PHD are indicated by dashed boxes and predicted -sheets are identified with dashed arrows. the current class III VFP numbering combines two interacting domains into domain III. UA represents \"hinge\" aa not assigned to domains in VSV G in the prior scheme. another domain identifiable with computational tools in BVD G is the carboxyl terminal transmembrane anchor. class II or III VFP contain 1 or 2 fusion loops, which give significant scores on the WWIHS. a region in bornavirus G (BVD aa 66-183) with 12 cysteine residues, plus 2 sequences with positive WWIHS scores is likely to represent the fusion domain of BDV G. the proposed domains of bornavirus G are collinear with analogous domains of herpesvirus gB. solid lines represent cysteine bonding in VSV G, AcMNPV GP64, and HSV-1 and EBV gB [30,32,34,43]. black boxes represent hydrophobic regions, with violet representing the transmembrane anchor (TM). dashed lines represent potential cysteine bonding in BDV G, THOV GP and CMV gB. most beta and gamma-herpesviruses, including CMV and EBV, have a furin cleavage site prior to the extended -helix. possession of a furin cleavage site does not preclude the possibility that BDV GP is a class III VFP. cysteines of class III (and class II) VFPs determined by X-ray crystallography are arranged so that disulfide bonds are formed between cysteine residue not modeled any dicysteine linkages between the GP1 and GP2 subunits. the predicted structures of BDV G were fit to the post-fusion structure of VSV G. fusion domains of BVD G appear to be stabilized by cysteine bonds. differences between VSV and BVD G include furin cleavage site and higher number of N-glycosylation sites in BDV G. no structural prediction of prefusion configurations of BVD GP is possible. bornavirus G is not a class I VFP, and does not corroborate the existence of a \"fusion peptide\" in GP2. GP1 sequences are capable of mediating attachment and entry in VSV pseudoparticles in the absence of GP2 [15]. GP2 is the only membrane-anchored BDV glycoprotein found on the plasma membrane. an analogous situation may exist for hepatitis C virus (HCV) flaviviridae, togaviridae, and Bunyaviridae family members are known or appear to have members that encode class II VFP [24,27-29] if the current analyses are correct, BDV G joins rhabdovirus G, herpeviruses gB, thogotovirus G and baculovirus GP64 and as a class III VFP. support for this hypothesis comes from the remarkable similarities in the post-fusion mononegavirales evolution can be depicted as a \"rooted\" tree with the ancestral mononegavirus possessing a progenitor of class I, III and likely II VFP. this case can be depicted as an unrooted tree, in which glycoproteins were acquired after divergent of paramyxoviruses from rhabdovirus and bornaviruses. several potent HIV-1 entry inhibitors were developed [46,47] based on the Gallaher HIV-1 TM fusion protein model [17]. peptides corresponding to a portion of the carboxyl terminal helix and the pre-anchor domain in this class I VFP have also been developed.
