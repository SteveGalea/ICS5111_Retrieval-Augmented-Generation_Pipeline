{"summary": "the growth potential of the tumor-like Echinococcus multilocularis metacestode is directly linked to the nature/function of the periparasitic host immune-mediated processes. we previously showed that Fibrinogen-like-protein 2 (FGL2), a novel CD4+CD25+ Treg effector molecule, was over-expressed in the liver of mice experimentally infected with E. multilocularis. AE-fgl2-/- mice showed lower parasite load with reduced proliferation activity. increased T cell proliferative response to ConA, reduced Treg numbers and function. targeting FGL2 could be an option to develop an immunotherapy against AE. IL-12, IFN- and IL-4 at the very early stage of E. multilocularis infection are associated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the periparasitic granuloma. it has been previously reported that CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) play a critical role in human AE by blunting immune responses to specific antigens. FGL2 has been propagated as a novel cancer biomarker. it was shown to be involved in pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders such as allo- and xenograft rejection [12,18\u201322] and cytokine-induced fetal loss [23], as well as in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, such as viral hepatitis. the protocol was approved by the Commission for Animal Experimentation of the Canton of Bern. mice, parasites and infection 8-week-old female C57/BL6 (wild type [WT]) and C57/BL6 fgl2 -/- mice [24] were bred and housed in specific-pathogen-free facilities. each experimental group included 6 animals unless otherwise stated. of 20 L containing 2 L cDNA and 10 pM of each primer. fluorescence was measured in every cycle. em14-3-3 mRNA levels were quantified relative to mRNA level of a parasite housekeeping gene. cell proliferation was assayed using the colorimetric BrdU cell proliferation ELISA kit. cells were cultured at a density of 2106 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 +10%FCS. negative control reactions were performed without rFGL2 or without anti-FGL2-MAb. mL rIL-17A or 1 g/mL anti-IL-17A for 48h. negative control reactions performed without rIL-17A or anti-IL-17A antibodies. FlowJo software (Tree Star, OR, USA), employing the gating strategy shown in S1 Fig. All antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (Palo Alto, USA) the results are presented as means SD. qRT-PCR was carried out on a Rotor-Gene 6000 qPCR detection system. cDNA was synthesized using the Omniscript Reverse Transcription kit. qRT-PCR cycling was performed in triplicates. peritoneal rinsing or grinding in 5 mL RPMI-1640 +20%FCS in a petridish for 2 h at 37\u00b0C 5%CO2. the non-adherent cells were collected, and highly (N99%) enriched iTreg cells were obtained by MACS (magnetic cell-separation) using the mouse CD4+CD25+ T cell Isolation-Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, rFGL2 or anti-FGL2 monoclonal antibodies were incubated with 1 and 5 g/mL rFGL2 or 1 g/mL anti-FGL2-MAb. negative control reactions were performed without rFGL2 or without anti-FGL2-MAb. the cells were first incubated with Inside-Fix (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) for 20 min at room temperature then stained with PE-labeled anti-IFN-r, anti-IL-4, anti-IL-17A, anti-IL-2, anti-IL-10 and anti-Foxp3. for each sample, a minimum of 500,000 cells were acquired using a FACS LSRII flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software spleen cells from non-infected WT-mice were co-cultured either with recombinant IL-17A (rIL-17A) as an external stimulus, or with anti-IL-17A antibodies. addition of rIL-17A led to increased FGL2-secretion in a dose-dependent manner, while the addition of anti-IL-17A had no effect. representative images of E. multilocularis infection in AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice at 4 months p.i. arrows point at intraperitoneal metacestode tissue/lesions. fgl2 -/- mice showed a significantly lower parasite load compared to AE-wT mice. 14-3-3 expression levels in AE-fgl2 -/- mice were significantly lower. parasite invaded the liver (a marker of pathogenicity) in only 33.3% of the AE-fgl2 -/- mice. spleen was taken from non-infected WT and AE-WT mice, CD4+ Teffs, CD8+ T cells, CD4+CD25+ Tregs and APCs were isolated by FACS cell sorting, fgl2 mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR. the two cell populations were co-cultured at a ratio of 1:1 (suppressor: responder) in the presence of APCs and ConA (2 g/mL), rFGL2 (1 g/mL), ConA (2 g/mL) + rFGL2 (1 g/mL), or anti-FGL2-MAb (1 g/mL); cell proliferation was measured using BrdU ELISA. at 4 months p.i., an increased frequency of Foxp3+/CD4+ CD25+ cells could be observed in PECs as well as spleen cells from AE-WT mice. expression levels of Foxp3 and IL-10-transcripts were significantly increased in PECs from AE-WT mice. purified splenic CD4+ T cells from AE-fgl2 -/-mice showed increased proliferation in response to ConA. splenic CD4+ T cells from AE-wT mice were cultured in the presence and absence of rFGL2. spleen cells from AE-fgl2 -/- mice showed a pronounced proliferation in response to ConA stimulation.

CD80 frequency within CD11b+ DCs in spleen cells of AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice. CD80 frequency within CD11c+ DCs in spleen cells of AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice normalized with their corresponding non-infected controls. data represent meanSD of three independent experiments of a total of 15\u201318 mice in each group. no difference in expression of IFN-, IL-4 or IL-17A between CD4+ cells from AE-fgl2 -/- mice and AE-WT mice. spleen cells from AE-WT mice and non-infected controls were cultured in the presence of VF (10 g/mL) no differences in FGL2 levels in supernatants could be detected in response to VF. data represent meanSD of three independent experiments of a total of 15\u201318 mice in each group (5\u20136 mice per group in each independent experiment) comparison between groups was performed using a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparison post-test. expression of CD62L, a cell adhesion molecule that is abundant on nave lymphocytes, was found to be increased on CD4+ T cells in the presence of rFGL2 (1 g/mL), but decreased in the presence of anti-FGL2 antibodies. however, this was not the case upon analysis of total spleen cell populations (S5 Fig), which indicated that FGL2 might play an important role in down-regulating lymphocyte co-stimulation. expression of CD86 on CD11b+ DCs showed the opposite. levels of FGL2 expression in sera of E. multilocularis infected (AE-WT) mice were significantly higher. spleen cells from non-infected WT-mice were co-cultured. AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice assessed by wet weight measurement at 1 month and 4 months post-infection. arrows point at intraperitoneal metacestode tissue/lesions. fgl2 -/- mice and control WT littermates were analyzed after 1 and 4 months p.i. with respect to parasite weight and expression of em14-3-3 as a marker for cellular proliferation activity. at the late stage of infection (4 months- p.i.), fgl2 -/- mice exhibited a significantly lower parasite load compared to WT mice. AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice compared to those in non-infected mice. Treg secretion and function in both AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice. fgl2 mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR. the two cell populations were co-cultured at a ratio of 1:1 (suppressor: responder) in the presence of APCs and ConA (2 g/mL), rFGL2 (1 g/mL), ConA (2 g/mL) + rFGL2 (1 g/mL), or anti-FGL2-MAb (1 g/mL). expression of Foxp3+/CD4+CD25+ was normalized with negative control. the contribution of FGL2 in the generation and maintenance of Tregs in AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice was analyzed ex vivo. at 4 months p.i., an increased frequency of Foxp3+/CD4+ CD25+ cells could be observed in PECs as well as spleen cells from AE-WT mice. rFGL2, Tregs from AE-WT mice inhibited CD4+ Teff proliferation. the same Tregs were not able to inhibit CD4+ Teff proliferation in the presence of anti-FGL2-MAbs. T cell functions are less affected in fgl2 -/- mice at the late stage of infection. expression levels of IL-17A and IL-2 were significantly higher in CD4+ T cells in spleen cell cultures obtained from AE-fgl2 -/- mice at 4 months p.i. expression levels of IL-17A and IL-2 were significantly higher in CD4+ T cells in both AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice at 1 months and 4 months post-infection. data represent meanSD of three independent experiments of a total of 15\u201318 mice in each group (5\u20136 mice per group in each independent experiment) comparison between groups was performed using a one-way ANOVA. CD80 frequency, not CD86, in both DC subpopulations from AE-fgl2 -/- mice at 4 months p.i. was significantly higher than in those from AE-WT mice at 1 month and 4 months post-infection. CD80 frequency within CD11b+ DCs in spleen cells from AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice normalized with their corresponding non-infected controls. corresponding isotype control antibodies were identically labeled for use as staining controls. data represent meanSD of three independent experiments of a total of 15\u201318 mice in each group (5\u20136 mice per group in each independent experiment. spleen cells from AE-fgl2 -/- mice and non-infected WT controls were cultured in the presence of VF (10 g/mL) no differences in FGL2 levels in the supernatants could be detected in response to VF compared to cultures from non-infected animals. spleen cells from infected AE-WT and AE-fgl2 -/- mice normalized using cells from non-infected controls. data represent meanSD of three independent experiments of a total of 15\u201318 mice in each group (5\u20136 mice per group in each independent experiment) mice were cultured in the presence or absence of rFGL2 or anti-FGL2-MAbs. iFN- expression was specifically increased in response to VF in the presence of anti-FGL2 MAbs. expression of CD62L, a cell adhesion molecule that is abundant on nave lymphocytes, was found to be increased on CD4+ T cells. the expression of CD86 on CD11c+ DCs was decreased in the presence of rFGL2 but increased in the presence of anti-FGL2 MAbs. this characteristic becomes more pronounced at the later stage of chronic disease in both humans and in experimentally infected mice. AE-WT mice showed a significantly higher parasite load as compared to AE-fgl2 -/- mice. the parasite proliferation potential was significantly higher in AE-WT mice. AE-WT-mice also showed higher FGL2-levels in the serum compared to non-infected mice. different pathogens may target different regulative pathways of the host immune response, such as Th2, Tregs or Th17. it is known that the regulation of such pathways is not dependent on single genes or molecules. a complex immuno-network is usually involved, which requires a sophisticated modulatory process via specific modulatory molecules from E. multilocularis to become effective. in AE, the expression of both cytokines appears up-regulated in mice. these include cell-to-cell contact-dependent suppression, cytotoxicity, and immunoregulatory cytokine secretion such as IL-10 and TGF-. the importance of these cytokines remains controversial, as several reports have demonstrated that antibodies against IL-10 and TGF- failed to block Treg suppressive function. in fgl2 -/-mice, Th1 cytokine levels and activity of DCs and T cells were all increased when compared to WT-animals. increased serum levels of IL-17A correlated with high serum levels. recombinant IL-17A promoted the production of FGL2 in spleen cells. y FcRIIB receptor (CD32) expressed primarily on APCs. both ligands are found on APCs and are known to provide efficient costimulation. however, in our experiments, distinct functions may be attributed to CD80 and CD86. the differential functions of these molecules have already been the subject of considerable studies. some parasite's specific molecules may be involved in the modulation of FGL2. this will lead to a periparasitic immune suppressed (anergic) status. direct inhibition of macrophage and/or mast cell functions could also be induced by this interaction. FGL2 may be proposed as a serum marker indicative for progression of AE. it may be useful to assess clinical status of AE-patients and the course and outcome of AE-patients. cells were co-cultured at different suppressor: responder ratios in the presence of syngeneic APCs and anti-CD3 antibody (0.5 g/mL) cell proliferation was measured using BrdU ELISA. experiments include WT and fgl2 -/- mice at 4 months post E. multilocularis infection. data represent meanSD of three independent experiments of a total of 15\u201318 mice for each group."}
