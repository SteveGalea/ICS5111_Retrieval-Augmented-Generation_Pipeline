{"summary": "pcDNA-env_DF1 cell line expressing ALV-J Env protein was previously constructed and shown to be resistant to ALV-J infection18. we first extracted the membrane proteins from the pcDNA-env_DF1 cells and then performed immunoprecipitation with the single monoclonal antibody JE-9. rabbit IgG blot assay for co-immunoprecipitation using mAb JE9. lane 1, 293T cell transfected with pcDNA3.1-EnvJ were analyzed with JE9. lane 3, 293T cell lysates transfected with chANXA2 were immunoprecipitated with JE9. chANXA2 is identified as a novel binding protein to ALV-J Env. antibody or siRNA to chANXA2 significantly inhibiting ALV-J infection. we performed blocking assays to evaluate the effects of chANXA2 on ALV-J infection in DF1 cells. blocking chANXA2 with a specific antibody can effectively and specially inhibit the infection/replication of ALV-J. the DF1 cells that had been pre-treated with antibodies against ANXA2 were infected with ALV-J or ALV-A. DF1 cells were transfected with siRNA (50 pmol) against chANXA2 for 6 hr. the cells were then infected with ALV-J at an MOI of 1 for 72 hr. the siRNA effects on chANXA2 was detected with real-time PCR. chANXA2 was over-expressing in the transfected 293T or GEF cells. after 48 h, the transfected GEFs were infected with ALV-J. the mixture of GEF cells and supernatants were inoculated into fresh DF1 cells. we first extracted the membrane proteins from the pcDNA-env_DF1 cells. then performed immunoprecipitation with the single monoclonal antibody (mAb) JE-9. one of these bands was chicken Annexin A2 (chANXA2). lane 2, 293T cell transfected with chANXA2 were analysed with anti-chANXA2. lane 3, 293T cell lysates transfected with chANXA2 were immunoprecipitated with JE9. lane 4, 293T cell co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-EnvJ and chANXA2 were analyzed with anti-chANXA2 (C-16) we used antibodies against chANXA2 to perform blocking assays to evaluate the effects of chANXA2 on ALV-J infection in DF1 cells. the viral infection/replication of chANXA2 was significantly inhibited in groups that had been treated with anti-ANXA2 in the IFA. however, only a few positive cells were found among the cells that were treated with the control IgG. the DF1 cells treated with antibodies against ANXA2 were infected with ALV-J or ALV-A. the replications of ALV-J and ALV-A in the treated cells were analysed. DF1 cells DF1 cells were transfected with siRNA (50 pmol) against chANXA2 for 6 hr. then the cells were infected with ALV-J at an MOI of 1 for 72 hr. real-time PCR revealed that the relative expression of the ALV-J envelope gene was increased in the 293T cells that were transfected with chANXA2. after 48 h, the transfected GEFs were infected with ALV-J. the mixture of GEF cells and supernatants were inoculated into fresh DF1 cells. the over-expression of chANXA2 in 293T or GEF cells can support ALV-J entry into these non-permissible cells. chANXA2 is a novel functional receptor for ALV-J entry. the isolation of chANXA2 was confirmed using fusion protein SUJ-rIgGFc. the interaction between chANXA2 and chANXA2 was confirmed using co-IP. chNHE1 requires chANXA2 or chANXA2 when they as ALV-J receptors need to be further tested. the over-expression of chANXA2 could permit the entry of ALV-J into non-permissible cells further supports the conclusion of chANXA2 as a novel functional receptor for ALV-J infection. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. the virus was titrated in DF1 cells to determine the TCID50 by the Reed and Muench method32. adenovirus plasmid pAD-SUJ-rIgGFc containing a 1.8-kilobase fragment was constructed. adenovirus rAd-SUJ-rIgGFc expressed fusion protein SUJ-rIgGFc. membrane proteins from DF1 cells were precipitated with agarose. precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with a Silver Stain Kit. lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAb JE9 at 4\u00b0C overnight. then incubated with protein A agarose for 1 hr. DF1 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of anti-ANXA2. the cells were infected with ALV-J or ALV-A at an MOI of 5. RT-PCR ALV-J gp37 was analysed with IFA and real-time PCR at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-infection. transfected cells were infected with ALV-J at an MOI of 5 (5 TCID50/cell based on the titer obtained from DF1 cells) for 48 h. EF cells, the cells and supernatants were homogenised and inoculated into the DF1 cells. real-time PCR RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. chicken 18S and human -actin were used as an internal control in this assay. DF-1 and pcDNA-env_DF1 cells18 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. the virus was titrated in DF1 cells to determine the TCID50 by the Reed and Muench method32. intact cells and nuclei in the resulting extract were sedimented by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 5 min at 6000 g. the membrane proteins from the DF1 cells were precipitated with the purified protein SUJ-rIgGFc and protein A agarose (Beyotime, China) DF1 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of anti-ANXA2 (C-16, Santa Cruz) for 2 h and then the cells were infected with ALV-J or ALV-A at an MOI of 5. the cells were maintained in DMEM with 1% fetal bovine serum and different concentrations of antibodies. chANXA2-transfected cells 293T or geese embryo fibroblasts (GEF cells) were transfected with chANXA2 for 48 h. the transfected cells were infected with ALV-J at an MOI of 5 (5 TCID50/cell based on the titer obtained from DF1 cells) after further three washes with PBS, the 293T and GEF cells were maintained in DMEM with the RNA was reverse-transcribed using PrimerScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara) with primers specific to the ALV-J gp37 and ANXA2 gene. chicken 18S and human -actin were used as an internal control in this assay. all authors reviewed the manuscript."}
