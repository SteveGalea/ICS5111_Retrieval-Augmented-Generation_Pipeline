{"summary": "the PDCoV genome is approximately 25-kb long, containing a 5\u2032 untranslated coding region (UTR), replication-associated genes (1a, 1b), a spike (s) gene, an envelope (e) gene, a matrix (m) gene, two nonstructural genes (ns6, ns7), and a 3\u2032UTR gene. in pigs infected with PDCoV, watery diarrhea was the most common clinical symptom. used serological assays included virus neutralization (VN) test, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) are the most commonly used virological methods for the detection of nucleic acid. porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain JXA1 was purchased from china animal disease control center, Beijing, China. PCR product was purified and amplification of the whole n gene. one microgram of the plasmid, which was verified by sequencing, was linearized and transcribed in vitro by following the manufacturer's instructions provided in RiboMAXTM Large Scale RNA Production Systems (Promega, Madison, US) the transcribed RNA was pretreated with DNase (Promega, Madison, US) then, it was purified with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, US). RT-qPCR The synthesized cDNA was used in RT-qPCR assay. amplification was performed with an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, US) diluted RNA standards were tested by conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR techniques. PDCoV and other swine pathogens were tested individually by RT-PCR and RT-qPCR techniques. the genome of these viruses was extracted by the above procedure. PDCoV strain CHN-GD16-03 and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) were purchased from china animal disease control center, Beijing, China. PCR primers (N-F and N-R) were used for the amplification of specific n gene. the PCR product was purified and ligated into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, US) one microgram of the plasmid, which was verified by sequencing, was linearized and transcribed in vitro. the transcribed RNA was pretreated with DNase (Promega, Madison, US), then purified with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, US). the copy number of the RNA standard was calculated by using routine RT-PCR After isolating total RNA from samples, it was reverse transcribed into cDNA by following manufacturer's instructions in PrimeScriptTM 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) PCR assay was performed under the following conditions: 1 L each primer (10 m), 25 L premix, 1 L cDNA, and 22 L distilled water. the RNA molecular standard was tenfold diluted. the diluted RNA standards were tested by conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR techniques. the genome of these viruses was extracted by the aforementioned procedure. RT-qPCR was designated as one-step RT-PCR in order to distinguish it from conventional RT-PCR developed in present study. a previously described RT-PCR method was also used to detect the samples [11]. RT-PCR and RT-qPCR assays had specificity for PDCoV detection. only PDCoV target gene was amplified by RT-PCR and visualized by agarose electrophoresis. tests were performed on three different days to evaluate the reproducibility of RT-PCR. both intra- and interassay variability were below 5%. this indicates that real-time RT-PCR had good reproducibility. one-step RT-PCR, conventional RT-PCR, and SYBR green-based real-time RT-PCR were significantly less sensitive than the other two assays. amplification of 10-fold dilutions of standard RNA was achieved by conventional RT-PCR technique in three different days. RT-qPCR was generated by plotting mean Ct values versus 10-fold dilutions of RNA standard in triplicates. we could detect as few as 2 101 copies of molecular RNA. the same melting temperature (Tm) was 86.0\u00b0C (Figure 1(c)) PDCoV was found to have a strong fluorescence signal under RT-qPCR. the Ct values of negative samples were greater than 35. a total of 84 clinical samples were simultaneously detected by conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. both conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR techniques showed an equally positive percentage for PDCoV. however, when these samples were tested by one-step RT-PCR, the overall positive rate was only 26.2% for PDCoV. this indicates that one-step RT-PCR was significantly less sensitive than the other two assays. conventional RT-PCR and SYBR green-based RT-qPCR methods have high sensitivity for PDCoV detection. the sensitivity of developed conventional RT-PCR is same as that of conventional RT-qPCR. the n gene was selected to be the target gene of RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. the sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR was significantly improved. the sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR was significantly improved in resource-limiting settings. fecal swab specimens, 30 feces specimens, and 30 intestine specimens were simultaneously tested by conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. the positive rates detected by conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR were both 41.7%. however, when the samples were tested by one-step RT-PCR, the positive rate was only 26.2%."}
