{"summary": "PEDV has spread rapidly through the pig population and is present in 30 U.S. states, Canada and Mexico as of May 2014. spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) is a common feed additive to nursery pig diets to promote growth. the use of SDPP improved average daily weight gain and decreased severity of enteric disease in piglets challenged with pathogenic Escherichia coli [9], [10] a reduction of the negative effects associated with PEDV due to SDPP appeared reasonable. the experimental protocol was approved by the Iowa State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. the moisture of the product during the run was 7.350.7%. the product was within normal production conditions and can be considered typical of commercial SDPP protein. three different SDPP samples were collected; from the beginning, the middle, and at the end of the batch production cycle. the negative control diet used for treatments 1, 2 and 5 did not contain any blood-derived protein. pigs were inoculated orally with 10 ml of a cell-culture propagated PEDV inoculum. dpi 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. fecal swabs were collected using polyester swabs (Fisher Scientific, Inc.) all pigs were weighed at -4 dpi and at dpi 28. SDPP (5%), PEDV-positive control feed Pigs in the SDPP-PEDV group were fed the 5% SDPP diet from dpi -4 through 28. pigs in the SDPP-PEDV group received the SDPP diet from dpi 0 until 28. microtiter plates were coated with the S1 polypeptide diluted in carbonate coating buffer and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. plates were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 22\u00b0C and incubated with samples diluted 1100 in PBS containing 10% goat serum for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. quantitative PEDV real-time RT-PCR for PEDV. a pair of PEDV detection primers and a TaqMan probe were designed to cover 149 nucleotides. PEDV genomic loads per fecal swab were calculated by multiplying the individual results from the quantitative real-time RT-PCR by 166.7. to obtain standards, the PCR products with primers PEDVDF/DR were purified and cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega) the confirmed plasmids were used as standards in the real-time RT-PCR assay to determine assay sensitivity and to quantify viral loads in the ine respiratory coronavirus, porcine deltacoronavirus, porcine astrovirus and swine hepatitis E virus were euthanized by pentobarbital overdose. no cross-amplification was observed, indicating that this real-time RT-PCR assay allowed specific, efficient and sensitive detection of PEDV. six sections of small intestines, three sections of large intestines, and one section of lung were collected at necropsy and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. intestinal content was collected from the cecum of each animal and stored in individual 50 ml plastic centrifuge tubes. sections of small and large intestines were also collected fresh and stored at 80\u00b0C. non-repeated nominal data were assessed using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA. if there was a significant difference, pairwise Wilcoxon tests were used to evaluate differences among groups. the moisture of the product during the run was 7.350.7%. the product was within normal production conditions and can be considered typical of commercial SDPP protein. three different SDPP samples were collected from the beginning, the middle, and at the end of the batch production cycle. treatment 2, 4 and 5 pigs were inoculated orally with 10 ml of a cell-culture propagated PEDV inoculum by slowly dripping the inoculum into the oral cavity of the pig. the negative control diet used for treatments 1, 2 and 5 did not contain any blood-derived protein. fecal swabs were collected using polyester swabs (Fisher Scientific, Inc.) all pigs were weighed at -4 dpi and at dpi 28. all pigs were weighed at -4 dpi. SDPP (5%), PEDV-positive control feed Pigs in the SDPP-PEDV group were fed the 5% SDPP diet from dpi -4 through 28. pigs in the SDPP-CONTROL group received the SDPP diet from dpi 0 until 28. anti-PEDV globulin A liquid egg protein formulation was obtained from a commercial source. LS 60030614-1) was obtained from a commercial source and was administered daily in a 5 ml volume orally from dpi -4 to dpi 6. the product was tested for anti-coronavirus antibodies and had an OD value of 1.0 based on incubating the liquid egg protein formulation diluted 110 in PBS. samples with OD values greater than 0.2 were considered positive. the peroxidase reaction was visualized by using tetramethylbenzidine-hydrogen peroxide solution as the substrate for 10 min at room temperature and stopped by adding 50 l of 2.5 M sulfuric acid to each well. samples with an OD value greater than 0.3 were considered positive, and samples with OD values below 0.2 were considered indeterminate. ORF1b gene was labeled with 6-Carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5\u2032 end and Black Hole Quencher (BHQ) at the 3\u2032 end. real-time RT-PCR was carried out in 96-well plates. each reaction consisting of a total volume of 25 l. the plasmids were extracted using a QIAprep Spin Minipreps Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, quantified using a spectrophotometer and sequenced. the confirmed plasmids were used as standards in the real-time RT-PCR assay to determine assay sensitivity and quantify viral loads in the fecal swabs. the PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' directions and sequenced at the Iowa State University DNA facility. the sequences were aligned with published data using BLAST. sections of small and large intestines were evaluated for presence of inflammation, villus atrophy, and necrosis. the amount of PEDV-specific antigen was scored by a pathologist blinded to treatment status. PEDV-infected pigs were lethargic and had moderate amounts of greyish diarrhea. between dpi 6 to 9 the degree of clinical signs appeared less severe in SDPP-PEDV pigs compared to EGG-PEDV and PEDV-CONTROL pigs. PEDV-antibodies were not detected in any of the pigs or the SDPP-PEDV pigs throughout the study. dpi 14, 21 and 28 pigs were shedding PEDV RNA in feces. group mean PEDV RNA levels were determined in fecal samples. PEDV viremia PEDV RNA was detected in low amounts in individual PEDV-infected pigs at dpi 3 and 7 but not at dpi 14, 21, or 28. pigs and 4/8 EGG-PEDV pigs were positive for PEDV RNA on dpi 3 and 1/5 positive controls, 2/5 SDPP-PEDV pigs and 1/5 EGG-PEDV pigs were RT-PCR positive on dpi 7. the PEDV load in positive serum samples ranged from 2.2 to 3.2 log10 genomic equivalent copies per ml. the majority of the PEDV-infected pigs had segmental, mild to severe villous atrophy and fusion in the small intestines. PEDV antigen staining was also observed in isolated cells in the lamina propria and Peyer's patches. clinical signs were characterized by mild diarrhea defined by semi-solid to fluid feces around dpi 2 in PEDV-infected groups. between dpi 6 to 9 the degree of clinical signs appeared less severe in SDPP-PEDV pigs compared to EGG-PEDV and PEDV-CONTROL. EGG-PEDV pigs had lower anti-PEDV OD values compared to dpi 14, 21 and 28. PEDV-antibodies were not detected in any of the NEG-CONTROL or the SDPP-CONTROL pigs. group mean PEDV RNA levels were determined in fecal samples. PEDV viremia PEDV RNA was detected in low amounts in individual pigs at dpi 3 and 7 but not at dpi 14, 21, or 28. 2/8 PEDV-CONTROL pigs, 1/8 SDPP-PEDV pigs and 4/8 EGG-PEDV pigs were positive for PEDV RNA on dpi 3. 1/5 positive controls, 2/5 SDPP-PEDV pigs and 1/5 EGG-PEDV pigs were positive for PEDV RNA on dpi 7. the majority of the PEDV-infected pigs had segmental, mild to severe villous atrophy and fusion in the small intestines. PEDV antigen staining was also observed in isolated cells in the lamina propria and Peyer's patches. PEDV-negative pigs were divided into five groups and four rooms. they were fed either a diet containing 5% SDPP confirmed positive for PEDV RNA or a control diet. the pigs had diarrhea from dpi 2 through dpi 10 and shed PEDV RNA. PEDV viremia has been reported in gnotobiotic pigs experimentally infected with PEDV genogroup 2. viremia was short and of low magnitude (low numbers of PEDV genomic copies in real-time RT-PCR positive pigs at single time points) it appears unlikely that PEDV viremia is a main source of PEDV contamination of SDPP. TGEV was administered orally for 10 consecutive days to the EGG-PEDV group starting at 4 days prior to PEDV challenge. there was no significant clinical improvement and except for dpi 14 there was no significant reduction in PEDV shedding in treated (EGG-PEDV) versus untreated pigs. at dpi 14 there was significantly reduced PEDV shedding in the SDPP-PEDV group versus the EGG-PEDV group. this is longer than SDPP is typically fed in the field. however, it was done in this experiment to mimic the SDPP-CONTROL group which received the SDPP diet from challenge to dpi 28."}
