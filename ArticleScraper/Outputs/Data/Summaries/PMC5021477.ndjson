{"summary": "children and infants are one of the most vulnerable groups of the population. ARIs are the most common cause of children's hospitalization worldwide. most respiratory virus infections in early childhood are confined to the upper respiratory tract. 134 children with ARI admitted to children's hospital in two winter seasons in 2010 and 2015 with symptoms of ARI and suspected for viral etiology. URTI was defined by symptoms of the common cold, coryza, cough, and hoarseness often accompanied with fever. LRTI was defined according to clinical symptoms of tachypnea, wheeze, severe cough, breathlessness, and respiratory distress. patients' underlying conditions data were collected retrospectively from medical charts. most common underlying diseases were asthma, anamnestic wheezing episodes, neurological disorders, prematurity, and anemia. written consent was obtained from the children's parents or caretakers. thermal cycler GeneAmp\u00ae 9700 PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) followed by microchip electrophoresis detection on MCE\u00ae-202 MultiNA device. software analysis displays result in form of electropherogram and virtual gel. patients were categorized into three groups according to age (1, 1\u20133, and 4 years of age) and two groups according to the localization of infection in those with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) patients were categorized into three groups according to age (1, 1\u20133, and 4 years of age) clinical syndromes of bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia included in LRTI category. chest radiographs were taken only for some patients to exclude or confirm bacterial pneumonia. most common diseases were asthma, anamnestic recurrent wheezing episodes, neurological disorders, prematurity, and anemia. cDNA synthesis was performed in one-step reaction using thermal cycler GeneAmp\u00ae 9700 PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) followed by microchip electrophoresis detection on MCE\u00ae-202 MultiNA device (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) software analysis displays result in form of electropherogram and virtual gel. results There were 62 patients examined and tested in 2010 and 72 in 2015, respectively. patients were one month to 16 years of age with median age 3 3.34 years in 2010 and 3 3.39 years in 2015. a single virus was diagnosed in 61.3% (65/109) of the patients, coinfection with two viruses in 27.6% (30/109) of the patients. there were two cases of concurrent detection of four viruses (1.8%) one in each of the investigated seasons. the most commonly diagnosed virus in both seasons was RSV (28.6%; 48/168), followed by PIVs types 1\u20133 (PIV-3 12.5%, 21/168; PIV-3 12.5%, 21/168; PIV-3 12.5%, 21/168). -1 3.6%, 6/168; and PIV-2 2.3%, 4/168; HRV (14.3%, 24/168), HMPV (10.1%, 17/168), AdV (7.1%, 12/168), Flu A+B (4.8%, 8/168), and HCoV (4.2%, 7/168). there were no Flu viruses detected in 2010 and eight of them were detected in 2015 (P = 0.0014) ARIs etiology based on symptoms, clinical findings, and biochemical tests without adequate laboratory testing is not possible because pathogen-specific clinical symptoms are lacking. the current gold standard for detecting conventional respiratory viruses such as flu, RSV, AdV, and PIVs types 1\u20133 will be challenged and eventually replaced by the nucleic acid amplification techniques. the characteristics and limitations of the assay used in this study were the relatively low sensitivity of 54.17%, but excellent specificity of 98.41, accuracy of 0.96, and agreement with kappa coefficient of 0.81. the limitations of this observational study also should be noted. in this study, HMPV was detected in 10.1% in both seasons combined, with no difference between the seasons. this study did not find a difference between HMPV detection rates according to the localization of infection. it seems that HRV and respiratory HEV are leading causes of upper respiratory tract infections, but molecular diagnostic techniques have revealed the presence of HRV. coinfection detection rate of 40.4% infections in both seasons combined. no significant differences between single and multiple virus infection regarding patient's age, localization of infection, and severity of disease. flu, PIVs, or RSV in respiratory specimens enable conclusions about the causative pathogen. but a clinical evaluation is needed to distinguish acute infections from subclinical events with nucleic acid persistence. several studies indicated that symptomatic infections are associated with higher viral load."}
