{"summary": "PERCH is a case-control study in 7 countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. cases were children aged 1\u201359 months hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia. cal colonization density >6.9 log10 copies/mL was strongly associated with MCPP and could be used to improve estimates of pneumococcal pneumonia prevalence in childhood pneumonia studies. PERCH study is a multicountry, standardized case-control evaluation of the etiologic agents causing severe and very severe pneumonia among children. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was in use for the entire enrollment period in the Gambia, Kenya, Mali, and south africa. in Bangladesh and Thailand, PCV was available only on the private market during the study period with almost no usage in the study areas. pleural fluid was collected from children with consolidation on chest radiographs. pleural fluid was also tested for pneumococcal antigen. a control was considered to have a respiratory tract illness. density was compared across groups with the Kruskal-Wallis test. the optimal density threshold was also calculated for MCPP cases versus the subset of controls without RTI (non-RTI controls), and among children who were HIV negative. PERCH study is a multicountry, standardized case-control evaluation of the etiologic agents causing severe and very severe pneumonia among children in developing countries. cases were hospitalized children aged 1\u201359 months with severe or very severe pneumonia. controls were randomly selected children from the community without severe or very severe pneumonia, were enrolled year round. a flocked NP swab (flexible minitip; Copan) and a rayon oropharyngeal (OP) swab specimen were collected from each case and control and were placed into the same vial. a second NP specimen for S. pneumoniae culture was collected simultaneously with the first swab specimen. antibiotic pre-exposure was defined as either a positive serum bioassay result (cases and controls) or documentation of antibiotics administered at the referral or study hospital before specimen collection. a control was considered to have a respiratory tract illness (RTI) if cough or runny nose were reported. the optimal density threshold was also calculated for MCPP cases versus the subset of controls without RTI (non-RTI controls), and among children who were HIV negative. to characterize a potential trend in risk associated with increasing pneumococcal density, we used logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and site. an additional 3 MCPP cases, 82 non-MCPP cases, 11 cases with unknown MCPP status, and 137 controls did not have analyzable NP/OP PCR results. a higher proportion of non-MCPP cases (41%) were aged 6 months compared with MCPP cases (21%). 0.60 1226 998 (81.4) 0.85 3962 2977 (75.2) 0.53 Age, mo 1\u20135 12 11 (91.7) 22.27 1660 1129 (68.0) 0.98 1619 1141 (70.5) 0.95 304 236 (77.6) 1.29 1315 905 (68.8) 0.86 6\u201311 13 13 (100.0) 9.11 920 684 (74.3) 0.69 1240 1001 (80.7) 0.55 319 266 (83.4) 0.74 921 735 12 11 (91.7) 32 608 402 (66.1) 1.87 482 341 (70.7) 0.8 127 109 (85.8) 1.69 355 232 (85.8) 0.6 Prior antibiotic use Yes 16 16 (100.0) 1.69 1861 1294 (69.5) 0.33 114 69 (60.5) 0.33 32 23 (71.9) 0.77 82 46 (56.1) 0.3 No 38 37 (97.4) 20.38 2038 1501 (73.7) 1.62 4648 3590 (77.2 aMCPP cases were confirmed by >1 test. bControls were matched for HIV status at the 2 sites (South Africa and Zambia) with high HIV prevalence. cPCV vaccinated was defined as 1 dose (restricted to Kenya, Gambia, Mali, and South Africa) MCPP cases were more likely to be colonized with S. pneumoniae (by culture or PCR, 100% [56 of 56]) compared with non-MCPP cases (75.7% [3055 of 4035]), all controls (81.4% [4224 of 5188]), controls with RTI (85.5% [1048 of 1226]), and median density differed by >100-fold between the site with the highest density, Mali (35.81 106 copies/mL), and the sites with the lowest density, Kenya and South Africa (3.6%). median density differed by >100-fold between the site with the highest density, Mali (35.81 106 copies/mL), and the sites with the lowest density, Kenya and South Africa (0.35 and 0.25 106 copies/mL), both with 5 MCPP cases (0.2 the optimal colonization density threshold for discriminating MCPP cases from controls was >6.9 log10 copies/mL (sensitivity, 64.3%; specificity, 92.2%; age-, sex-, and site-adjusted odds ratio, 17.9. the threshold was unchanged when restricted to controls without RTI and when limiting the comparison to HIV-negative children. the proportion of cases and controls with densities >6.9 log10 copies/mL among those positive varied by proportion of controls with density >6.9 log10 copies/mL ranged from 1.2% in Thailand to 15.6% in Mali. percentage of children with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal pneumococcal colonization density >6.9 log10 copies/mL among positives. 7.4) 319 34 (10.7) 921 58 (6.3) 12\u201323 17 12 (70.6) 894 123 (13.8) 1268 87 (6.9) 345 25 (7.2) 923 62 (6.7) 24\u201359 14 7 (50.0) 561 58 (10.3) 1061 87 (8.2) 258 28 (10.9) 803 59 (7.3) Sex Male 29 17 (58.6) 2311 265 (11.5)b 2602 193 (7.4) 617 aPneumococcal colonization density calculated by PCR for the lytA gene performed on NP/OP specimens in PCR-positive children. cPCV vaccinated was defined as 1 dose (restricted to Kenya, Gambia, Mali, and South Africa) coinfection were all associated with density >6.9 log10 copies/mL, but without clear evidence of increasing strength of association with increasing densities.

MCPP cases are limited to those for which the serotype of the invasive isolate was the same as that of the colonizing isolate. shaded areas indicate areas outside the linear range of the assay for calculation of pneumococcal density. high pneumococcal colonization density was associated with virus detection in the upper respiratory tract. this finding was explained in part by respiratory syncytial virus coinfection. this finding may indicate that upper respiratory infection with viral pathogens enhanced the density of pneumococcal colonization. invasive pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with increased colonization density. cases with density >1000 copies/mL had 18 times greater odds of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia than colonized cases with density 1000 copies/mL [10] the south africa study defined invasive pneumococcal pneumonia by detection of S. pneumoniae by PCR in the blood. the sensitivity of the 6.9 log10 copies/mL threshold for detecting pneumococcal pneumonia may be lower than we estimated. the sensitivity of the 6.9 log10 copies/mL threshold for detecting pneumococcal pneumonia may be lower than we estimated based on the MCPP cases.
