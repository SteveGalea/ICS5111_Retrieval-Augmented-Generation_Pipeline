{"summary": "avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) of the H9N2 subtype were first detected in turkeys in the united states in 1966. they have been circulating worldwide in multiple avian species and endemic in poultry populations across Eurasia. the virus could cause death in three and two of the eight tested mice at a dose of 106 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) in mice. but none of the viruses are highly pathogenic for mice according to criteria that a highly pathogenic virus has a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) value less than 103.0 EID50. several molecular determinants have been identified that govern pathogenicity of avian influenza virus for mammals. mutations involved in the ability of NS1 proteins to restrict the induction of the host interferon response. pathogenic mechanism of H9N2 viruses for mammals is poorly understood. two H9N2 AIVs, NJ06 and NJ01, were isolated from ducks in china. the virus was highly pathogenic for mice and induced severe lung lesions and excessive cytokine responses. however, there were only twelve amino acid differences between the two viruses, which might contribute to the high virulence in mice. in-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium. mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital natricum and inoculated intranasally with 10-fold serial dilutions of viruses in 30 l PBS or mock inoculated with PBS to serve as controls. body weight and survival of mice were recorded daily for 14 days. mouse lungs were surgically dissected, blotted dry, dried in an oven at 80\u00b0C for 72 h. the lung wet/dry weight ratios were calculated for each animal to assess tissue edema. throcyte hemolysis and the number of leukocytes in BAL fluid were counted with a haemocytometer. the remaining fluid was centrifuged for 10 min at 300 g. each slide was counted twice by different observers blinded to status of the animal. cDNA was extracted from infected allantoic fluid using the Body Fluid Viral DNA/RNA Kit (Axygen) the nucleotide sequences were initially aligned using the Clustal V alignment algorithm of the Megalign program (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA) Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics software. results were expressed as means standard deviation (SD) body weight and survival of mice were recorded daily for 14 days. mice that showed severe symptoms or lost more than 25% of their body weight were euthanized and scored as dead. titers in supernatants were determined as the number of 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) per ml in MDCK cells at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post inoculation (hpi) differential leukocyte Counts and Cytokine expression analysis Inflammatory response in mouse lungs was assessed by testing differential leukocyte counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. total RNA was isolated from lungs using TRIzol reagent. one microgram of total RNA per sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA. expression of each cytokine gene relative to that of the -actin was calculated. Sequence Analysis Viral RNA was extracted from infected allantoic fluid using the Body Fluid Viral DNA/RNA Kit (Axygen) the results were phylogenetically analyzed with the representative strains available in GenBank. the nucleotide sequences were initially aligned using the Clustal V alignment algorithm of the Megalign program. NJ06-infected mice showed obvious signs of illness, including decreased activity, huddling, ruffled fur, heavy/labored breathing, and hunched posture. mice in the NJ06-infected group showed obvious weight loss and died by 5 dpi at a dose of 106.0 EID50, and by 10 dpi at a dose of 104.0 EID50. mice infected with NJ06 (A) and NJ01 (D) were examined by measuring the percent survival. no infectious virus was detected in the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, brain from any of the NJ06- or NJ01-infected mice. the virus replicated to a high titer that was 101.4-fold higher than the NJ01 virus as early as 1 dpi. the virus grew to significantly higher titers than NJ01 in either MDCK or A549 cells at each time point. the virus reached a peak titer of 107.8 TCID50/ml at 48 hpi. the peak viral titer of NJ06 virus was also observed on 48 hpi. NJ06 induced severe pneumonia with inflammatory cellular infiltration and hemorrhage, alveolar wall edema and thickening, and deciduous epithelium mucosae and inflammatory cells in the bronchioles. however, only mild and limited alveolitis was observed in the lungs of NJ01-infected mice. the total number of BAL cells was markedly increased in mice infected with NJ06 virus compared to the NJ01 virus or mock infection group. cellular infiltration in the BAL samples during NJ06 virus infection was associated with an increase in the percentage of neutrophils and lymphocytes compared with that for NJ01-infected mice. the levels of all cytokines were substantially greater than constitutive levels in the lungs of NJ06- or NJ01-infected mice by 1 dpi. however, NJ06 virus induced significantly higher levels of TNF- and CXCL 10 expression than did NJ01 at all time points. IL-17a was also detected at higher levels of expression in NJ06-infected mice than in NJ01-infected mice. -1, IL-8, and IL-10, were measured in the mouse lungs at the indicated times by Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) each cytokine expression was normalized to the expression of -actin, and is presented as the fold change relative to the level of the mock group. the mean fold change of each group is shown, with error bars representing the SD.

NJ06 Virus Elicits Significantly High levels of Cytokine response in mouse Lungs. groups of five mice were intranasally inoculated with 105 ELD50 of NJ06 or NJ01 virus. expression of these cytokines, TNF-, IL-1, IL-8, and IL-10, was measured in the mouse lungs at the indicated times by Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) each cytokine expression was normalized to the expression of -actin, and is presented as the fold change relative to the level of the mock the NS and ribonucleoprotein (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) complex genes of the two viruses fell into the DK/HK/Y439/97-like and Ck/SH/F/98-like. the NS and ribonucleoprotein (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP) complex genes of the two viruses fell into the DK/HK/Y439/97-like. the tree was generated by the distance-based neighbor-joining method using software MEGA 6.06. the reliability of the tree was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. most avian, swine, and human isolates share the same amino acid as NJ06. no isolates was found to contain the residues PB2-149, PA-548 and -550, and NP-127 as NJ01 virus. some studies have suggested that H9N2 AIVs could jump to humans easily. the ferret is well established as an animal model to study human influenza virus pathogenesis and transmission. no animal model is perfect and the use of ferrets for influenza studies has been limited by the lack of availability of inbred and specific pathogen\u2013free animals. lung lesions characterized by massive edema, diffuse alveolar damage, and excessive inflammatory cell infiltration are involved in the severe influenza in humans and animal models. the NJ06 infection could result in severe edema and alveolar damage, and elevated inflammatory cell infiltration in mouse lungs. IL-17a acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that induces the expansion and accumulation of neutrophils of the innate immune system. IL-17a is a potent chemoattractant for activated Th1 lymphocytes and natural killer cells. the high levels of TNF- and CXCL10 have been linked to the persistent severe viral disease. PB2 627K is not a sole determinant factor for mammalian adaptation by avian influenza viruses or its contribution to virulence need to interact with residue at other positions or genes. all other ten differences, except for NA-K435R, were located in recognized functional regions that are involved in interaction of viral proteins or between the virus and host factors.
