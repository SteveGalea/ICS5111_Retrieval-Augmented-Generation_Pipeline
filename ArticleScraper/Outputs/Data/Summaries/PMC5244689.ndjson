{"summary": "central africa and sub-saharan africa are the most badly affected localities and constitute the source of world epidemics possibly due to human infections from the forest bats Zaire Ebola virus caused the largest reported outbreak of Ebola in 2014 in the west africa. this virus was transmitted to human through infected fruit bats, monkeys, apes, and pigs. filoviruses are large viruses that may reach 1400 nm in diameter Figure 2. emergence of Reston Ebola virus in pigs increases concern of health authorities. transmission occurs when man consumes flesh of fruit bats, flesh of animals fed on infected fruit bats or touching any contaminated matter with the virus EBOLA TRANSMISSION. understanding the infectious routes and cycles through which Ebola virus can be transmitted seems critical to break the chain of transmission. intact skin represents an immunological defense against infection with Ebola. the virus was reported to enter the body through skin abrasions, mucosal surface breaks, and through contaminated water for parenteral injection. hemorrhagic fever is a descriptive pathological term for Ebola virus infection. the relatively large size of Ebola viruses may suggest a traumatic vascular injury to explain the origin of Ebola-induced hemorrhagic fever. however, this possibility was reported to be excluded upon vascular histological analysis of different tissues during autopsy. coagulopathy-induced hemorrhages are not large enough to be the underlying cause of death. adrenal cortex may be the second affected tissue with Ebola virus. lymphoid depletion and necrosis were reported in the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes of patients with fatal disease. fected with Zaire Ebola virus where the lymphocyte loss seemed to be greatest in T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells. same INF inhibition was reported forVP24 of the Ebola virus that interferes with type-1 INF signaling. the newest member of filoviruses (Lloviucuevavirus) was discovered in 2010 in Spain. a close relationship between the dry conditions at the end of the rainy season was found to correlate with the onset of epidemics. a maculopapular rash is a diagnostic sign that later desquamates (at days 5\u20137) in survivors. nonspecific symptoms may make the diagnosis difficult, especially at primary health centers. nonspecific symptoms should be taken seriously in patients living in endemic areas. preliminary investigative markers include leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia, transaminitis (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase [ALT]) and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen. laboratory diagnosis is usually made through virus enumeration, serology, nucleic acid tests, or, rarely, viral culture. RT-PCR surveillance of blood, sputum/saliva/throat swabs, conjunctival swabs, stool, urine, semen, and sweat has been reported. urine and sweat samples have been reported to remain positive for viral RNA up to 30\u201340 days and semen for 3 months. whole blood transfusions from convalescent patients are needed for the treatment of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. the treatment of complications, for example, hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, refractory shock, hypoxia, hemorrhage, septic shock, multiorgan failure, and DIC is critical and life-saving. NS was reported to exert potent antiviral effects against many viruses, for example, viral hepatitis, coronavirus, and others. it was reported to have activity against some RNA viruses, for example, influenza viruses. NS was reported to exert many hepatoprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury. NS treatment restored serum level of liver enzymes (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase), reduced oxidative stress index. conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest. parts in the body of the article approved the submission. names of the authors are enlisted in the author list section."}
