{"summary": "animals were maintained on standard laboratory chow and water ad libitum. infectious disease status of the colony was monitored serologically. a sonicated emulsion of 200 g MOG35\u201355 contained 200 g M. tuberculosis H37RA. each animal received 200 ng PTX by intravenous injection. and TNF- in culture supernatants were quantified by bio-Plex multiplex assay. IL-17 and IFN- levels were analyzed by ELISA as previously described. animals were either purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. emulsion of 100 g MOG35\u201355 and an equal volume of CFA contained 200 g M. tuberculosis H37RA. mice were immunized using the 1 MOG35\u201355 + CFA + PTX single-inoculation protocol. each animal received 200 ng PTX by intravenous injection. IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12(p40), IL-12 (p70), IL-13, G-CSF, GM-CSF, Eotaxin/CCL11, KC/CXCL1 (murine IL-8 homolog), MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1/CCL3, MIP-1/CCL4, RANTES/CCL compared with 2 MOG35-55 + CFA immunized mice, the severity of clinical disease course was significantly greater in 1 MOG35-55 + CFA + PTX immunized mice. PTX was elicited in B6/J mice by using a 1 MOG35-55 + CFA + PTX or 2 MOG35-55 + CFA\u2013immunization protocol. a significant effect of M-SOB was not detected for 1 mice born in January, February, July, August, August, September, November, and December. a significant effect of M-SOB was not detected for 1 MOG35-55 + CFA + PTX\u2013immunized B6/J mice. 0.05; **P 0.01; **P 0.01; ****P 0.0001; ****P 0.0001. matched cohorts of B6/J mice were immunized using the 1 and 2 protocols. for the 1 protocol, seventy-one 6- to 12-wk-old mice were studied. 65% of the cytokines/chemokines measured in the 2-immunized mice showed a significant M-SOB effect. greater production of IL-1, IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, KC/CXCL1 and MIP-1/CCL3 was not observed at P 0.001 IL-1 43.9 3.2 60.4 3.2 64.9 2.3 18.4 0.9 0.0001 IL-2 409.0 31.7 386.6 18.8 204.4 22.9 128.0 9.2 IL-3 723.5 77.3 823.0 69.4 674.8 54.4 270.8 25.6 0.0001 IL-4 20.4 2.1 17.6 1.3 14.3 0.9 9.8 0.9 0.0006 IL-5 46.4 7.7 41.2 4.6 35.5 3.2 10.3 1.0 0.0001 714.5 385.7 TNF- 39.6 4.2 47.1 3.3 32.3 1.9 75.8 4.9 0.0001 GM-CSF 26.2 2.9 27.0 1.6 74.7 7.4 16.5 1.9 0.0001 GM-CSF 1175.0 50.9 2879.0 214.8 0.0001 1867.7 168.2 959.4 127.0 0.0001 Eotaxin/CCL11 1336.0 98.4 510.2 35.6 0.0001 131 seasonal variability in birth rates is observed in human populations. compared birth rates of B6/J mice with the M-SOB effect on EAE susceptibility. when stratified by month of birth, fewer pups are born in February, March, April, and May. monthly number of B6/J mice born per litter differs significant across the year. a 3-mo running average for the percent total B6/J mice weaned per month in the southern hemisphere. born per litter per month in the northern hemisphere was detected (F = 56.2; P 0.0001). regressed incidence, severity of clinical disease course, cumulative disease score, peak score, and severity index. a highly significant positive association between all EAE quantitative trait variables and birth rate variables was detected. disease course was quantified by averaging the area under the curve of each immunized mouse. peak score is the average of the highest score attained across the 30-d observation. 925 mice were immunized during the year from 2004 to 2013. the clinical disease course fits a variable slope sigmoid dose-response curve. number in parentheses is the number of animals per immunization cohort. a significant effect of M-SOB was not detected for 1 MOG35-55 + CFA + PTX\u2013immunized B6/J mice. SOB influences EAE susceptibility of 2 MOG35-55 + CFA\u2013immunized B6/J mice. A, C) 2- and 1-immunized mice were stratified by month of birth (MOB) numbers in parentheses indicate number of animals. eighty-eight 6- to 12-wk-old mice were studied for the 2 protocol. 22 females and 22 males born in December and January immunized in February. 22 females and 22 males born in December and January immunized in June. an M-SOB effect on the production of IL-2, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IFN, Eotaxin, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1/CCL4 and RANTES/CCL5 was not observed at P 0.001. the production of many of the cytokines/chemokines influenced by M-SOB in 2-immunized mice have been implicated in EAE and/or MS pathogenesis.
