{"summary": "AGE is one of the prevailing cause leading to high mortality and morbidity worldwide. between three and five billion cases and 1.5\u20132.5 million deaths occur every year due to gastroenteritis in children 5 years of age. rotavirus, norovirus, astrovirus and adenovirus largely affect children causing gastroenteritis episodes. an RV strain is to be designated as Gx-P[x]-Ix-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Tx-Ex-Hx for the VP7, VP4,VP6, VP1, VP2, VP3, NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4 and NSP5 genes. the genotyping method based on nucleotide sequence identity cut-off values of all 11 genome segments, as has been adopted for RVA, is a few antigen-based immunoassays are in use for the detection of RVC infection. VP6 gene-specific RT-PCR assays are used for the group-specific detection of RVCs. the exact epidemiological blueprint is yet to be determined for India. 119 fecal samples were screened for RVC from Haldwani, Uttarakhand. a mixed urban and rural culture of various religions with diverse living systems. a 10% (w/v) fecal suspension was prepared with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and supernatants were used for the viral RNA extraction. diagnostic VP6 Gene-Specific RT-PCR Assay Presence of RVC in diarrheic stool samples was detected by using the RT-PCR assay targeting the VP6 gene with primers RVC-VP6-DF; 5\u2032-ARTCHGTTCTATGYGATTC-3\u2032 [14] and BMJ44; 5\u2032-AGCCACATAG TTCACATTTC-3\u2032 [20] PCR conditions were optimized as described previously [14] with SapphireAmpFa positive recombinant clones were sequenced by the Bigdye terminator Sanger sequencing method in an ABI 3730 x l sequencer. sequences were deposited in geneBank with Accession Numbers MG553198 (NSP4 gene), MG553199 (VP4 gene) and MG553200 (VP6 gene). protein model tool available in MEGA 6 (v 6.06), confirmed with the FindModel online tool. 2.6. Determination of N-glycosylation sites on the VP6, VP4 and NSP4 proteins of the HuRVC/H28/2013/India strain were predicted by using a NetNGlyc 1.0 server. 119 fecal samples were screened for RVC from Haldwani (state of Uttarakhand, India) diagnostic VP6 Gene-Specific RT-PCR Assay Presence of RVC in diarrheic stool samples was detected by using the RT-PCR assay targeting the VP6 gene with primers RVC-VP6-DF; 5\u2032-ARTCHGTTCTATGYGATTC-3\u2032 [14] and BMJ44. the diagnostic primers were expected to amplify a 340-bp amplicon. recombinant clones were deposited in geneBank with Accession Numbers MG553198 (NSP4 gene), MG553199 (VP4 gene) and MG553200 (VP6 gene). the abbreviations refer as RE sites\u2014restriction enzyme sites, f1- origin of replication. the suitable dendrogram analysis model was identified using the find best DNA/protein model tool available in MEGA 6 (v 6.06), confirmed with the FindModel online tool [57]. 2.6. Determination of N-glycosylation sites on the VP6, VP4 and NSP4 proteins of the HuRVC/H28/2013/India strain were predicted by using a NetNGlyc 1.0 server [58] of the total 119 samples, 38 (31.93%) were found positive for RVC in none of the sample detected as positive for RVC showed co-infection with screened viruses (calicivirus, astrovirus and picobirnavirus) none of the sample detected as positive for RVC showed co-infection with screened viruses (calicivirus, astrovirus and picobirnavirus) the phylogenetic tree (n = 47) of the VP6 gene consisted of two major clades. one contained bovine, ferret and canine RVCs. the other consisted of porcine, human and human-like porcine RVCs. the presence of a similar VP6 gene in porcine and human RVC strains could suggest that the gene may have been reasserted. the current study isolate clustered with Indian and Bangladeshi RVC isolates, showing a percent of identity of 97.7\u201398.5%. the Tamura-3+G algorithm was identified using the find best DNA/protein model tool available in MEGA 6. numbers on branches indicate the percentages of bootstrap support from 1000 replicates. VP6 gene-based I typing of RVC is denoted along with clusters. study sequence showed the least sequence identity (nt: 94.3%, aa: 95.6%) with the Japanese isolate (LC129057) and highest (nt: 97%, aa: 97.6%) with the Bangladeshi isolate (HQ185635) VP4 gene sequences from india are not in accordance with the observation by the former report. the current study strain shows quite high similarity (95.6\u201397.6%) at the amino acid level with other human RVCs as compared to animal RVCs. the isolate of the current study is denoted by the solid dot. the scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. six mutations were noticed at positions 31, 73, 124, 141, 146 and 192. the study strain showed higher genetic relatedness to Eurasian RVC strains than to more geographically-close Chinese RVC strains. the amino acid sequence analysis of the NSP4 gene from HuRVC/H28/2013/India showed point mutations like D2E, H75N, H100Q, I120M and H133Y. phylogenetic analysis of species C rotavirus based on NSP4 genes (450 nt) of human, swine and cattle origin at the nucleotide level. numbers on branches indicate percentages of bootstrap support from 1000 replicates. predicted deletion in glycosylation (N192S) may alter virus attachment and entry into host cell. this study provides a preliminary addition to the available knowledge. it is lacking with respect to Indian RVC isolates. preceding reports from different Asian countries showed both sporadic and outbreak cases with comparatively less prevalence of RVC. the percentage molecular detection of RVC by RT-PCR was 8.6% (in the outbreak cases) and 0.7% (sporadic cases) from western India and 3.33% from Delhi. the VP6 and VP4 genes and the complete CDS region for the NSP4 gene using the reported primers. the absence of intact virus particles or degraded viral RNA may be a cause for the inability to amplify full-length VP6 and VP4 gene of the virus with otherwise well-established primers. cross-priming or primer-binding failures at the 3\u2032 end of the primer may also cause the inability to obtain the full-length genome sequence. some of the Indian human RVC sequences reported recently from the Delhi region, Northern India (KY886474-79; [37]) showed comparatively distant phylogenetic relatedness with all other previously-reported Indian RVC sequences. a similar VP6 gene in porcine and human RVC strains could suggest that the gene may have been reasserted. the current study isolate shows high sequence similarity with other human RVCs at the nucleotide and amino acid level. the percent similarity was low with animal-origin VP6 sequences (bovine, ferret and canine, 90%) human, porcine, bovine, canine and ferret origin RVC strains clustered with human, porcine, canine and ferret origin RVCs. the study sequence showed the least sequence identity. the current study strain showed a higher sequence identity (96.4\u201396.9%) with other RVC VP4 gene sequences from india. the current study strain showed quite high similarity (95.6\u201397.6%) at the amino acid sequence of the current study isolate. human RVCs as compared to animal RVCs (60.4\u201368.7%) divergence in outer capsid protein VP4 gene in comparison to inner capsid protein VP6 among Indian RVC isolates proves the rapid evolving nature to escape selection pressure. the study isolate had 91.4\u201396% and 90.2\u201395.1% identity, respectively, with the available human RVC sequences. the highest sequence identity was observed with Russian isolates (KP735977 and JN969079) the changes at position 120 and 133 might affect the functional property of the NSP4 gene. the amino acid sequence from 114 to 135 is considered responsible for enterotoxin activity and the binding capability of virus with caveolin. these two point mutations lie in the well-described VP4 binding domain (described for RVA strains) the scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. the dots represent the identical amino acids, and five changes were noticed at positions 2, 75, 100, 120, 133 in the current study\u2019s RVC isolate. some of the Indian human RVC sequences reported recently from the Delhi region, Northern India. the HuRVC/H28/2013/India strain showed the highest sequence similarity with recently-isolated Indian human-like porcine RVC from Assam, PoRVC/ASM140/2013/India. the current study isolate shows high sequence similarity with other human RVCs at the nucleotide and amino acid level. the percent similarity was low with animal-origin VP6 sequences (bovine, ferret and canine, 90%) the scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. the scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. human, porcine, bovine, canine and ferret origin RVC strains. the study sequence showed the least sequence identity (nt: 94.3%, aa: 95.6%) with the Japanese isolate (LC129057) and highest (nt: 97%, aa: 97.6%) with the Bangladeshi isolate (HQ185635) the current study strain shows quite high similarity (95.6\u201397.6%) at the amino acid level with other human RVCs compared to animal RVCs (60.4\u201368.7%) divergence in the outer capsid protein VP4 gene in comparison to inner capsid protein VP6 among Indian RVC isolates proves the rapid evolving nature to escape selection pressure. a change was linked with the N-glycosylation site at position 192 (N192S) in the study strain. the study isolate had 91.4\u201396% and 90.2\u201395.1% identity. the highest sequence identity was observed with Russian isolates. the amino acid sequence analysis of the NSP4 gene from an Indian human RVC showed point mutations like D2E, H75N, H100Q, I120M and H133Y. the changes at position 120 and 133 might affect the functional property of the NSP4 gene. the amino acid sequence from 114 to 135 is considered responsible for enterotoxin activity and the binding capability of virus with caveolin. isolate of the current study is denoted by the solid dot. deduced amino acid sequence alignment of the NSP4 genes of the current study HuRVC strain with that of previously-described HuRVC strains. the predicted deletion in glycosylation (N192S) may alter the virus attachment and entry into the host cell, but needs further studies in this context. the NSP4 in RVs is a heavily glycosylated viral protein [62], which was also observed during the current analysis of available human RVC NPS4 sequences. the studies have used the classification critterion adopted for RVA. they need approval of the RCWG before their global acceptance."}
