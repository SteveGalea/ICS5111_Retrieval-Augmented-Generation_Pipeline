{"summary": "the pathogenesis of BOOP is still incompletely understood. postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is considered as the essential infection of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) it affects nursing and fattening pigs in almost all farms. MMP-2 (gelatinase A) is synthesized by a wide variety of mesenchymal cells. it is produced mainly by inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. in vitro experiments demonstrate that OPN is both chemotactic and mitogenic. four serial sections (5\u201310 mm) were drawn from postweaned pigs to grower-finisher pigs. four serial sections (5\u201310 mm) were made in each pulmonary lobe. two aliquots of each lobe were frozen in 80\u00b0C until used.

PVDF membrane was then washed and incubated with a 1 : 2,000 dilution of mouse anti--SMA antibody (Biogenex) bands were visualized by the Amersham ECL-Plus detection regents (Amersham) and were quantitated by Image Analysis with a Gel-pro Analyzer. descriptive statistic was first used for analysis of normality. pigs, purchased from animal technology institute Taiwan, were euthanised and necropsied. fresh samples were stored in 80\u00b0C until used. PCR method used to detect pathogens. 5\u2032-GCA GTA CCA ATT CAT CTT CT-3\u2032 Reverse primer: 5\u2032-ACC GTC TGA TCT TCT TCT GTG GTA GG-3\u2032 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) gB, forward primer: 5\u2032-ACC GTC TGA AGA AGA CTG AAC TTC TCT GAC AC-3\u2032 Porcine enterovirus (PEV) Talfan-3D, forward primer: 5\u2032-ACC GTC TGA AGA serial sections (4\u20136 m) of paraffin-embedded samples were deparaffinized and rehydrated. three of them were stained by haematoxylin and eosin stain and followed by special stains, picro-sirius red stain [22] and orcein-picroIndigocarmine stain [23] for total collagen and elastic fiber determination. Western Blot MFBs quantification was analyzed by western blot [26]. bands were visualized by the amersham ECL-Plus detection regents (Amersham) t-test or Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was used to check if the data normality value is within accepted range. the mean values were considered significantly different if *P.05, **P.01, or ***P.001. PCV 2 antigen signals appeared strong positive in foamy alveolar macrophages ((a)-(b), arrow head) and intraluminal plugs of two representing BOOP lesions. other lung sections in five individual BOOP pigs revealed similar results. alveolar septa appeared widened with proliferation of type II pneumocytes and mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates. positive cells were identified as -SMA positive MFBs (d) and OPN positive cells (e) the proliferative cells of the intraluminal plugs and alveolar septa were identified as -SMA positive MFBs (d) the activities of proMMP-9, MMP-9, proMMP-2, and MMP-2 were all significantly increased in BOOP group (b), P.05) the quantitative data were assayed from five cases (six lung sections in each case) the common culture for bacteria such as Pastuella multocida, Streptococcus sp., Salmonella sp., and Actionbacillus pleuroneumoniae was negative. the results of PCR detections, PRRSV, PRV, CSFV, PPV, CMV, PEV, PCV1, M. hyopneumoniae, Porcine coronavirus, and SIV were all negative. the features of chronic pulmonary fibrosis showed grey hepatization. the features of chronic pulmonary fibrosis showed grey hepatization. the features of chronic pulmonary fibrosis showed grey hepatization. the intraluminal plugs of loose connective tissue occlude bronchioles in H&E stain (a) a large mount accumulation of collagen matrix was sawn cherry in picrosirius red stain (b) and strongly blue in OPIC stain (c) at the evaginated BOOP lesion. the gelatin zymography revealed MMP activity from three representative BOOP and normal pigs (a) for each individual BOOP or normal pig, six sample lung sections were evaluated for MMP activity and averaged. the averages from the BOOP and normal animals were pooled from the five different pigs to generate the data presented (b) etiologies associated with human BOOP include bronchiolitis obliterans, fibrinous exudates, alveolar accumulations of foamy macrophages, and evenly spaced, rounded balls of myxomatous connective tissue. etiologies have also implicated in the pathogenesis of human BOOP. pigs showed copious coughing, dyspnea, and crackle for approximately four weeks. they were empiricly treated with amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole for 10 days upon the onset of symptoms. however, there was no symptomatic relief. pigs with chronic respiratory syndrome may show moderate to marked multifocal peribronchial and peribronchiolar fibrosis. pigs with PCV2 and other coexisting pathogens may show moderate to marked multifocal peribronchial and peribronchiolar fibrosis and often extend into the airway lamina propria. pigs with chronic bronchiopneumonia are usually obsolete from the economic aspect, thus these histopathological changes in lung were neglected. a future study is needed to elucidate the cytokine effects by which the PCV2 induces BOOP. abundant MFBs presented as activated type (-SMA positive) which invaded and migrated into bronchial lumen to form intraluminal plugs. expression level of -SMA was also elevated significantly compared to control by Western blot. fibrosis and OPN promote significant migration and proliferation in both epithelium and fibroblast/MFB in the fibrotic process. induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 promote the migration of fibroblast/MFB. meanwhile, MMP-2 activating MMP-9 increases fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis."}
