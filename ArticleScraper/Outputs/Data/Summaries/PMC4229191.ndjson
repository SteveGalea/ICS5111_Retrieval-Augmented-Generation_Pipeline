{"summary": "bats have evolved a range of characteristics that allow them to adapt to changing environmental conditions. most bat species undergo torpor to conserve energy and species that inhabit high northern latitudes hibernate for up to eight months with body temperatures below 10\u00b0C. bats have been implicated as reservoirs for human bacterial [3]\u2013[5] and viral pathogens. fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (formerly known as Geomyces destructans) is a cold-adapted saprophytic fungus that targets hibernating bats. it appears to be a recent introduction to the northern Americas. in recent years, it has been responsible for the death of an estimated 6 million bats and the potential regional extinction of some species [22], [23] bats in groups of 18 were either sham inoculated or inoculated with N. american or European isolates of P. destructans. bats were housed at 7\u00b0C and greater than 97% humidity with ad libitum water. samples were preserved in RNALater or in formalin. RNA Extraction Tissues were homogenized in 2 ml sealed vials with a 5 mm steel bead, 0.1 g of 0.1 mm zirconium silica beads, 350 L of RLT buffer (with -mercaptoethanol) cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 g of RNA per reaction using the Quantitect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, 205313) Target Direction Sequencea Refb Reference Sequencec Reference Organismd Cathelicidin Forward CGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCGCG qRT-PCR primers for reference organismsd were identified by scanning the Myotis genome for sequences that matched those of well-characterized reference organismsd. myotis-specific substitutions in these primers are in bolda. primer, 2 L (1 M) of diluted reverse primer, 12.5 L of SYBR Green Master Mix, and 8.5 L of cDNA were used. the thermal profile used was as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes for initiation, then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for denaturing for 10 seconds. a no template control (NTC) was used in every sample tested. Tissue Samples Fifty four Male M. lucifugus bats were collected from a WNS-free cave in Manitoba, Canada. protocols for collecting and transporting bats, infection with P. destructans, maintenance of bats in hibernation and sample collection have been described previously [24], [25] cDNA samples were either stored at 4\u00b0C if proceeding to use in qRT-PCR, or stored at 80\u00b0C until they were needed. cDNA samples were either stored at 4\u00b0C if proceeding to use in qRT-PCR. primers were designed from the sequence of corresponding M. lucifugus genes. for mRNAs where such information was not available we designed primers to optimize for annealing temperature and specificity, and to minimize dimer formation. myotis-specific primers were designed from potential Myotis exon sequences using parameters for optimal use in PCR reactions. qRT-PCR primers for reference organismsd were validated in the literatureb,c. quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Stratagene's MX3005P PCR Cycler was used in conjunction with QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, 204056) for each sample tested, 2 L (1 M, final concentration) of diluted forward primer, 2 L (1 M) of diluted reverse primer, 12.5 L of SYBR Green Master Mix, and 8.5 L of cDNA was used. the significance of differences of mean values of Ct between infected and mock-infected (control) bats was determined using a student T-test. a lower Ct of one indicates approximately a two-fold higher concentration of RNA. each square represents the value from a bat. the relative levels of a transcript for each bat are depicted as Cycle threshold (Ct) normalized separately (Ct) for levels of transcripts for two \u201chouse-keeping genes\u201d. the horizontal bar represents the mean while the vertical bar indicates standard deviation from the mean. some infected bats have levels comparable to (or lower than those of uninfected animals) transcript levels correlated with scores for fungal infection, fungal hyphae and bacterial infection in wings and neutrophil accumulation in lungs. the correlation coefficients are therefore negative. n = number of samples with usable Ct values. NS = not significant. hibernating M. lucifugus are capable of inducing the expression of genes for cytokines. we observed mild to moderate levels of interstitial neutrophils in the lung of infected bats. on average, the lungs contained 8 to 20 times more transcripts for the anti-microbial peptide Cathelicidin as well as for the immune modulators TNF and IL 10 and 23. interleukin 10 is also known as cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF) because of its role in modulating the inflammatory response. its effect is to suppress Th1 responses and stimulate Th2 responses leading to B-cell survival and proliferation and antibody synthesis. hibernating mammals show marked leukopenia [20] raising the possibility that circulating leukocytes are sequestered in some organ, possibly the lungs. the infected animals responded to inflammation in the wings with an increase in neutrophils, which then migrated to the lungs. this suggests that bats are capable of suppressing a lung or systemic infection by P. destructans. 10 and TNF may be indirectly related or may represent a non-specific response to the stress of infection."}
