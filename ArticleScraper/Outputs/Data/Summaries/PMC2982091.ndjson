{"summary": "the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped virus with a positive single strand RNA genome. it has emerged in the human population during winter 2002\u20132003 causing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infections with a 10% mortality rate. the reasons for the severity of illness in SARS-CoV infected patients are not clearly understood. in vitro studies on monolayers of human airway epithelial cells have shown that morphology of cells was affected at late time points following infection (72 and 120 h) cell polarity is maintained by three protein complexes, the CRB, PAR, and SCRIB complexes. apical polarity complex plays a major role in establishment, regulation, and maintenance of apical polarity in epithelial cells. apical polarity complex plays a major role in establishment, regulation, and maintenance of apical polarity in epithelial cells. the CT of the SARS-CoV envelope protein E binds the human TJ protein PALS1 in human epithelial cells. in transfected and infected cells, it is known that E localizes at the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and golgi apparatus, where virus assembly occurs. cDNA coding for the CT domain of SARS-CoV E was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pB27 vector enabling fusion with the LexA binding domain. the bait construct was checked by sequencing the entire insert and was introduced into the Y187 yeast strain. 146 positive clones were picked, and the corresponding prey fragments were then filtered and contiged as described previously. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 95% O2/5% CO2 atmosphere. well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (wd-NHBE) cells were cultured. the total RNA was retro-transcribed to generate single-stranded cDNAs using random hexamer oligonucleotides and the ThermoScript RT-PCR system. the cDNAs were further amplified by PCR using specific sense and antisense primers. the pcDNA plasmids containing either the wild-type HA-E (wt) or a truncated mutant with a deletion of the for production of the MDCKII stable cell line expressing eGFP-PALS1, the PALS1 cDNA was introduced into the EGFP fusion retroviral vector pLEGFP-C1. retroviral constructs were generated by inserting full length (wt) or truncated (PBM) E nucleotide sequences, excised from pcDNA by digestion with BamHI and XhoI, into the pCHMWS the rabbit polyclonal PALS1 and CRB3 antisera were produced as described. the antibodies anti-Calnexin and Golgin-97 were mouse monoclonal antibodies from abnova (Taipei City, Taiwan) and Invitrogen. a single colony of transformed BL21 bacteria was amplified according to standard procedures. expression of GST-fusion proteins was induced by addition of 1\u20132 mM isopropyl--d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) five microliters of each purified GST fusion protein were run on 4\u201312% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. gels were stained with Coomassie blue, and the protein concentration, ranging between 0.08\u20130.40 g/l, was estimated in comparison to the band intensity of the BSA control. proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting. peptides were purchased from Peptide 2.0 (Chantilly, VA) and dissolved in 4% dimethyl sulfoxide. membranes were blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in 10% skimmed milk prepared in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Tween-20. membranes were hybridized with mouse IgG1 monoclonal anti-Flag M2 HRP-conjugated antibody. 8 g of pCMDR8.91 and pCI-VSV-G were mixed with 6 g of either pCHMWS-HA-E (wt)-Hygro, pCHMWS-HA-E (PBM)-Hygro, or pCHMWS-HA-E (PBM)-Hygro, followed by transfection of HEK 293T cells. cells were maintained in medium supplemented with both 600 g/ml G418 and 200 g/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen) expression of EGFP-PALS1, HA-E (wt), HA-E (PBM), and HcRed fluorescent proteins were verified by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. cell culture medium was changed every 2\u20133 d to allow individual MDCKII cells to grow into cysts. the monolayers were washed three times with 1X PBS. the monolayers were washed three times with 1X PBS. primary and secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Texas Red (TxRed) were prepared in 0.2% Tween-20, 1X PBS. cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with primary antibodies, washed three times, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for an additional 30-min period. xiovert 200M inverted confocal microscope (Core Imaging Facility of The University of Hong Kong) and Olympus Fluoview FV500 confocal microscope system were analyzed. 21 chambers from three independent experiments were analyzed. a total of 870\u2013885 cysts were counted, and the observed phenotype was scored. cher et al., 2005, compared with the latest release of the GenBank database using BLASTN. a Predicted Biological Score (PBS) was attributed to assess the reliability of each interaction. the pcDNA-Flag-PALS1 construct was generated by cloning the full-length human PALS1 cDNA derived from purified RNA of wd-NHBE cells. total RNA was retro-transcribed to generate single-stranded cDNAs using random hexamer oligonucleotides and thermoScript RT-PCR system. specific sense and antisense primers, and hemagglutinin (HA) tag were introduced in frame upstream of E sequences. for expression of GST-PALS1 fusion proteins, PALS1 cDNA inserts were subcloned into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) s were transformed into BL21-Gold (DE3) pLys bacteria strain. all constructs were sequenced at the Genome Research Centre of the university of Hong Kong to verify that the procedures had not generated unwanted mutations. goat anti-rabbit FITC, donkey anti-mouse Texas Red (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), goat anti-mouse FITC (ZyMax, Invitrogen), goat anti-mouse Texas Red (Oncogene-Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ), Alexa Fluor-647 goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rat, and Alexa Fluor\u00ae-488 goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse were 100 g/ml lysozyme (Roche Diagnostic GmbH), 0.6 mM PMSF (Sigma Aldrich) and 1X Complete Protease Cocktail inhibitor were purified by overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. cells were lysed with 0.5\u20131 ml of cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 1X Complete Protease Cocktail inhibitor) 400 l of cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with purified GST fusion proteins of PALS1. anti-Flag M2 affinity gel suspension washed four times in Tris-buffered saline buffer (TBS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4) for precipitation of Flag-PALS1 protein, 40 l agarose beads were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 600 l of cell lysate, centrifuged, washed five times with TBS buffer. electrophoresis and immuno HEK 293T cells were used as packaging cells to produce replication-defective retroviral particles. for production of the particles pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope glycoprotein as vectors for eGFP-PALS1 or eGFP expression. early passage MDCKII cells were seeded into six-well plates and grown to 30\u201340% confluence before infection by VSV-Gpp-eGFP-C1 and VSV-Gpp-eGFP-PALS1. cells were replated into culture media supplemented by 600 g/ml G418 (Sigma-Aldrich) for selection. after 10\u201312 d of antibiotic selection, the surviving clones were propagated in 25- cell lines at 80\u201390% confluence were detached with trypsin-EDTA. the cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing with 200 g/ml Hygromycin B, 600 g/ml G418, and 4% GelTrex. on the following day, the low calcium medium was replaced with prewarmed. normal medium (1.8 mM calcium) and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) were measured at the specified time points post-calcium switch (t = 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 17, 24, 120 h) TER was determined as described previously using a millicell-ERS volt-ohm meter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) immunostained cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Tween-20 in 1X PBS. MDCKII cysts were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 2% NGS, 1X PBS, 0.02% sodium azide for 48 h and extensively washed (3) in the same medium. cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained as described above with minor modifications. clones 67 and 131 constituted the smallest and largest PALS1 cDNA fragments. clone 131 was a shorter form of PALS1 with truncations at both N- and C-terminal ends. clone 131 was a shorter form of PALS1 with truncations at both N- and C-terminal ends. #67 (panel a) and #131 (panel b) encoded the smallest and largest PALS1 cDNA fragments. numbers indicate amino acid position. flag-PALS1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Flag M2-conjugated agarose resin and coimmunoprecipitation of Flag-PALS1 and E. the E protein was only found in immunoprecipitates from cells transiently expressing both Flag-PALS1 and E. the longest PALS1 cDNA clone identified through the yeast-two-hybrid screen. the GST-PALS1 (L27, PDZ) fusion protein could pull down detectable levels of E only when 1.0 g of fusion protein was used for the assay. however, the GST-fusion proteins consisting only of either the L27 or the SH3 domain could not precipitate the E protein (Figure 2B, panels c and d, lanes 3\u20134) the molecular mass (in kDa) and migration of protein standards are indicated on the left edge of each gel. SARS-E was pulled down only by beads linked to constructs containing the PDZ domain of PALS1. PALS1 was present at cell-cell contacts (panels d\u2013f, red arrows) and at the ERGIC (panel f, white arrowhead), where it colocalized with S protein (arrowheads in panels d and e) in infected cells. cytoplasmic distribution of PALS1 was conspicuously absent from cells expressing little or no SARS-S. colabeling of PALS1 and ERGIC-53 in infected samples indicated the presence of PALS1 in this later compartment. these data suggest that PALS1 is retained at the virus-assembly site in SARS-CoV\u2013infected cells where it may interact with E. we then investigated whether another TJ protein, the ZO-1 protein, could also be relocalized to the virus assembly site. e that E binds to the PDZ domain of PALS1 and that PALS1 is redistributed to the ERGIC and Golgi region in infected and transfected cells. we reasoned that E should contain a PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) likely located at its carboxy-terminal tail. GST-PALS1 fusion proteins (clone 131 and PDZ) efficiently pulled down HA-E (wt) but not HA-E (PBM) we also did not observe nonspecific binding with beads, GST protein (data not shown), and GST-PALS1 (SH3) fusion protein (Figure 4A, panels a and b, lanes 7\u20138), which were included as negative controls. deletion of PBM abolished interaction with PALS1. cells were transfected with combination of plasmids as indicated on top. cells were lysed and proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 antibodies conjugated to agarose resin. coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with lysates of HEK 293T cells transfected with the appropriate combination of plasmid vectors pcDNA-Flag-PALS1, pcDNA-HA-E (wt) and pcDNA-HA-E (PBM) the cells were mock-transfected and individually transfected with these plasmids. two peptides corresponding to the CT tails of E (amino acids 34-76) and CRB3 (amino acids 80-120) tested their capacity to interfere with the interaction between CRB3 and PALS1 PDZ domain in a GST-pull down assay. the peptides were incubated with 1 g of GST-PDZ fusion protein for six hours at 4\u00b0C. proteins were determined by immunoblotting using a rabbit anti-CRB3 serum (Figure 4C, panel a) and a mouse IgG1 monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Figure 4C, panel b), respectively. both the myc-CRB3 and the HA-E (wt) proteins were pulled down by GST-PDZ in absence of peptide. by contrast, the CT peptide of E drastically inhibited the interaction of myc-CRB3 but expression of E causes defect in morphogenesis of MDCKII Cysts. to investigate functional consequences of E expression on epithelial cell morphogenesis, we chose to use the MDCKII cysts model. the model has been widely used to establish molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate epithelial polarity and morphogenesis. control cells expressing either eGFP or eGFP-PALS1 and HcRed fluorescent protein showed a similar percentage of cysts with single lumens and maintained polarity. eGFP-PALS1 was found on apical membranes of the cysts, facing the internal lumen and present at TJ as indicated by its colocalization with the tight junction associated protein ZO-1. the number of single lumen cysts with preserved polarity is expressed as percentage of total count of cysts scored. for each cell line, we have counted total of 870\u2013885 cysts. ectopic expression of HA-E protein in MDCKII eGFP-PALS1 cells was associated with formation of either two or multiple lumens. the defect of cyst morphogenesis observed in MDCKII cells expressing HA-E mutant protein suggests that the DLLV motif is not involved in this phenomenon. the same set of experiments was performed on MDCKII cells expressing either form of E on an endogenous PALS1 background. ectopic expression of HA-E protein led to a significant delay in TJ formation, which started only 4 h post-calcium switch. however, monolayer cells of the MDCKII eGFP-PALS1 expressing HA-E (PBM) reached maximum TER 2 h post-calcium switch with a maximum of 700 /cm2. cells expressing SARS-E (wt) significantly perturbed the establishment of TJ. the maximum TER value was reached two hours post-calcium switch for both control and SARS-E (PBM) cells. eGFP-PALS1 was present at cell\u2013cell contacts in apical regions. both proteins were present at TJ (Figure 7A, panel b, black arrowheads) the GP135 marker was found on apical surface of the cells. e-cadherin protein was present at cell\u2013cell junctions on lateral membranes. PALS1 is localized at the tight junction, as confirmed by colocalization of ZO-1 (panel b, black color arrowhead). e-cadherin is at the lateral membrane of two adjacent cells, which marks the adherens junction. in these cells, PALS1 is partially localized at the cell\u2013cell periphery, with little overlap with ZO-1 (panel b) GP135 localized diffusely to the cell cytoplasm. eGFP-PALS1 and HA-E (wt) protein was expressed in a perinuclear compartment. a partial colocalization of eGFP-PALS1 and eGFP-PALS1 was observed. TER measurement and confocal microscopy analysis were conducted in parallel from 0 to 120 h post-calcium switch. control, HA-E (PBM) and HcRed (data not shown) showed a peak of TER at 3 h post-calcium switch. a delay was observed for the HA-E (wt) expressing cells. cells expressing SARS-E (wt) perturbed the establishment of TJ. maximum TER value was reached 3 h post-calcium switch for both control and SARS-E (wt) cells. TER values had stabilized at low levels for all cell lines. round cells showed a higher expression of E (wt) and a portion of eGFP-PALS1 colocalized with E (white arrowhead) at 24 h, round cells frequently showed a higher expression of E (wt) and a portion of eGFP-PALS1 colocalized with E (white arrowhead). EGFP-PALS1 was predominantly at apical cell-cell contacts in MDCKII eGFP-PALS1 HA HA-E (wt) partially colocalized with the Golgi markers. HA-E (pBM) did not but was present in the apical region of the cytoplasm. round cells expressed PALS1 in the cytoplasm and had lost structure of polarized cells were observed at all time points. more round cells with higher expression of E (wt) and cytoplasmic localization of PALS1 were seen. apical cell\u2013cell contacts in MDCKII eGFP-PALS1 HA-E (PBM) cells had irregular shape. this irregular shape was also observed in both cell lines at 120 h post-calcium switch. clone 131 was shorter form of PALS1 with truncations at both N- and C-terminal ends (amino acids 95-514, including domains L27, PDZ, SH3, band 4.1, and a truncated GuK) clone 131 was a shorter form of PALS1 with truncations at both N- and C-terminal ends (amino acids 95-514, including domains L27, PD plasmid vectors encoding Flag-PALS1 or E were cotransfected into vero E6 epithelial cells. flag-PALS1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Flag M2-conjugated agarose resin. flag-PALS1 was efficiently immunoprecipitated from cells transiently expressing both Flag-PALS1 and E. clone 131 performed a GST pull-down assays with the longest PALS1 cDNA clone identified through the yeast-two-hybrid screen. purified GST-PALS1 fusion proteins (0.5 g and 1.0 g) were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with cell lysate from vero E6 cells transiently expressing the E protein. PALS1 clone 131 and truncation mutants fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) at the N-terminus. functional domains are depicted by different shapes as in Figure 1B. infection with SARS-CoV causes redistribution of PALS1 proteins to the ERGIC/Golgi region in vero E6 cells. images were acquired with a ZEISS Axiovert 200M confocal microscope. ER colocalized with Golgin-97 (panel b, white arrows) whereas ZO-1 remained at cell contacts (panel c, white arrowhead) and did not colocalize with the cytoplasmic accumulated PALS1 (panel c, white arrows) PALS1 was present in an intracellular compartment, whereas ZO-1 was exclusively found at cell-cell contact zones. this indicates that PALS1 is specifically recruited to the virus budding compartment (ERGIC/Golgi region) in infected cells. both sequences start with an acidic amino acid and end with two hydrophobic residues ([E,D]-X--) the four carboxy-terminal amino acids of E have characteristics of PDZ domain ligands. to verify this hypothesis, we prepared a mutant in which these four amino acids were deleted and performed GST-pull down assays. purified GST-PALS1 fusion proteins (clone 131, PDZ and SH3 domains) were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with lysates of HEK 293T human epithelial cells that transiently expressed either full-length (wt) or a truncated (PBM) SARS-E protein containing a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminal position. 1 g of purified GST-PDZ fusion protein linked to sepharose beads was preincubated for 6 h at 4\u00b0C with DMSO, E, or CRB3 CT peptides in DMSO (200 M and 1 mM concentrations) a rabbit anti-CRB3 serum (panel a) and a mAb anti-HA (panel b) could interfere with CRB3 protein interaction with GST-PDZ (cf. lanes 4\u20137 proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Flag M2 agarose resin. membranes were hybridized with either the mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2 HRP-conjugated or anti-HA tag antibody. the HA-E (wt) protein was efficiently coprecipitated with Flag-PALS1. the peptides (0.2\u20131 mM in DMSO) were incubated with 1 g of GST-PDZ fusion protein for six hours at 4\u00b0C. as control, GST-PDZ fusion proteins were incubated with DMSO in absence of peptide. both myc-CRB3 and HA-E (wt) proteins were pulled down by GST-PDZ in absence of peptide. our data indicate that the carboxy-terminal of E can compete out the interaction of CRB3 with the PDZ domain of PALS1 in vitro. however, one has to consider that in infected cells E expression levels are high and thus E might be able to compete out CRB3 binding to PALS1 or at least to retain significant levels of PALS1 in the secretory pathway. phenotypes were categorized into cysts with either a single apical lumen or multiple lumens. the majority (61%) of MDCKII-eGFP-PALS1 cells (540/885) formed single lumen cysts with distinct apicobasal polarity (Figure 5, A and C) single MDCKII, eGFP-PALS1 cells were embedded into cell culture medium supplemented with 4% GelTrex matrix. incubated at 37\u00b0C for five days until cysts developed. images were acquired with an inverted confocal microscope. ectopic expression of HA-E protein in MDCKII eGFP-PALS1 cells was associated with formation of cysts with either two or multiple lumens. the defect of cyst morphogenesis observed in MDCKII cells expressing HA-E mutant protein suggests that the DLLV motif is not involved in this phenomenon. MDCKII eGFP-PALS1 cells could rapidly form TJ. a maximum TER value of 400 /cm2 reached at 2 h post-calcium switch. at later time points, TJ were gradually loosing strength. at later time points, TJ were gradually loosing strength. a similar pattern was observed for clones of MDCKII cells expressing E (wt) or E (PBM) on an endogenous PALS1 background. a similar pattern was observed for clones of MDCKII cells expressing E (wt) or E (PBM) monolayers of MDCKII eGFP-PALS1, eGFP-PALS1, HA-E (wt) and eGFP-PALS1, HA-E (PBM) were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with appropriate antibodies to study subcellular distribution of GP135 (apical marker), AJ protein, ZO-1 (TJ marker), and HA-E wt and truncated proteins. eGFP-PALS1 cells grown to confluence on polyester membrane filter were transferred into low calcium medium (5 M) for twenty-four hours to disrupt cell\u2013cell junctions and then switched to normal growth medium (1.8 mM Ca2+) cells were fixed at different time points (t = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 h) post-calcium switch. images were acquired with a ZEISS LSM 510 Axiovert 200M confocal microscope. HA-E (PBM) mutant protein is diffused in the cytoplasm and localized at the subapical region (underneath GP135) this mutant protein did not colocalize with PALS1 in any subcellular compartment. a partial colocalization of eGFP-PALS1 and HA-E (wt) was observed in some cells. eGFP-PALS1 and ZO-1 were found at the TJ, whereas GP135 was enriched at the apical surfaces. the DLLV motif of E plays a major role in alteration of polarity in monolayers of MDCKII cells. this result also demonstrates that the DLLV motif of E plays a major role in alteration of polarity in monolayers of MDCKII cells. MDCKII HA-E (wt) cells showed higher TER values than control cells. the maximum recorded value of TER was at 8 h post-calcium switch (400 /cm2). it is possible that resistance had risen further between the 8\u201324 h interval. round cells were observed in HA-E (wt) but not HA-E (PBM) expressing cells (red arrows). at all time points and for both cell lines, a significant fraction of eGFP-PALS1 was observed at cell\u2013cell contact, except in E (wt) expressing rounding cells. to monitor the differential changes of structure of monolayers expressing either HA-E (wt) or HA-E (PBM) we have fixed cells at 2, 8, 24, and 120 h after calcium switch. we permeabilized and labeled them with specific antibodies against the HA tag and either the Giantin (cis/median Golgi) or the Golgin-97 (trans Golgi) cellular proteins. at 2 h post-calcium switch, in HA-E (wt) monolayers, PALS1 appeared in confocal sections as a discontinuous line around cells. Conversely, in HA-E (PBM) cells PALS1 was uniformly present at cell-cell contacts. at 8 and 24 h, gaps between cells were occasionally observed close to round cells with high cytoplasmic PALS1 expression. the interaction was identified in a yeast-two-hybrid screen. we have verified the interaction in mammalian epithelial cell by coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro by GST-pull down assays. a CT peptide of E but not E competes against CRB3 interaction with the PDZ domain of PALS1 in vitro. this latter finding suggests that E-PALS1 association could affect the interaction of PALS1 with CRB morphogenesis of MDCKII cysts is significantly disrupted when E is expressed. similar findings were observed when E (PBM) was expressed. but not a control HcRed protein. expression of E (wt), but not E (PBM), delayed TJ formation in MDCKII cells. expression of E (wt) expressing cells present a strong defect of polarity with a mis-location of polarity markers. expression of E (wt) expressing cells present a strong defect of polarity with a mis-location of polarity markers. expressing cells, witch are most likely back to a steady state with low TER values. however, round cells were still present in E (wt) expressing cells. a molecular mechanism that contributes to the destruction of the alveolar walls remains unclear. it is intriguing to speculate that upon infection E participates in SARS-CoV\u2013induced pathogenesis and destruction of the epithelial barrier. we hypothesize that E binds to PALS1 and alters its localization in infected cells in vivo. loss of PALS1 at TJ could cause TJ and AJ disruption. virions attach to ACE2 receptors, which are localized at the apical surface. the viral RNA (vRNA) is released into the cytoplasm and is transcribed to a set of subgenomic (sgmRNA) strands that encode for structural proteins S, M, N, E, and other accessory proteins. SARS-E could disrupt its trafficking to TJ. interaction was identified in a yeast-two-hybrid screen (Figure 1A-B) we have verified the E\u2013PALS1 interaction in mammalian epithelial cell by coimmunoprecipitation (Figure 1C) and in vitro by GST-pull down assays (Figure 2B). a CT peptide of E but not E (PBM) competes against CRB3 interaction with the PDZ domain of PALS1 in vitro. this morphogenesis of MDCKII cysts is significantly disrupted when E is expressed. similar findings were observed when E (PBM) was expressed, but not a control HcRed protein. expression of E (wt), but not E (PBM), delayed TJ formation in MDCKII cells in calcium switch assays. expression of E (wt) expressing cells present a strong defect of polarity with a mis-location of polarity markers, whereas control cells and E (PBM) expressing cells are polarized. round cells were still present in E (wt) expressing cells. however, round cells were still present in E (wt) expressing cells. a molecular mechanism that contributes to the destruction of the alveolar walls remains unclear. we have verified that PALS1 and CRB3 are expressed in pneumocytes. hypothesize that E binds to PALS1 and alters its localization in infected cells in vivo. loss of PALS1 at TJ could cause disruption and contribute to desquamation of alveolar wall. virions are internalized into endosomes where acidic pH triggers envelope fusion. the viral RNA (vRNA) is released into the cytoplasm and is transcribed to a set of subgenomic (sgmRNA) strands that encode for structural proteins S, M, N, E, and other accessory proteins. at this stage, SARS-E could disrupt its trafficking to TJ."}
