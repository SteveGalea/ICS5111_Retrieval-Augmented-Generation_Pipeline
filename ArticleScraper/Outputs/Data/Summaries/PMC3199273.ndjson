{"summary": "AHI is an industry-led, not-for-profit partnership between livestock producers, processors, veterinary surgeons, animal health advisers and government. it includes diseases and conditions of livestock which are endemic in Ireland, but are not currently subject to regulation and coordinated programs of control. the agri-food and drink sector accounts for 9% of Ireland's economy-wide GVA or about 16% of total industrial sector output. 10.5% of Ireland's exports and 8.2% of total employment. relative importance of agriculture to the economy has increased since decline. study attributed these costs to immunosuppression of calves (7%), congenital defects/growth retardation (5%), persistently infected (PI) calves (19%), persistently infected cows and heifers (16%), abortions (9%) and other reproductive loss in cows and heifers (44%). BVD control is well advanced in Austria and Switzerland. beef cattle has calculated the cost of BVD in a suckler herd to be \u00a337 (\u20ac40 - \u20ac44, depending on exchange rate) per cow per annum. it was assumed there was no BVD control in the herd and no re-introduction of infection. however, in a field where there is no systematic approach to BVD control, the re-introduction of BVD is always a potential risk. BVD has several characteristics that facilitate its eradication. direct animal to animal transmission Cattle can become persistently infected with the virus if they are infected as unborn calves in the uterus in early pregnancy. such PI animals excrete BVD virus in all their secretions and excretions through out their lives. transient infection is caused when an immunologically naive non-PI animal is exposed to the BVD virus after birth. clinical signs can vary considerably from virtually none to severe disease. immunity to further BVD infection develops. BVDV is the most common contaminant of bovine foetal serum due to the capacity of the virus to spread transplacentally. BVDV is the most common contaminant of bovine foetal serum due to the capacity of the virus to spread transplacentally and subsequently establish a persistent infection in the immunologically immature foetus [19]. BVDV is the most common contaminant of bovine foetal serum. BVDV is the most common contaminant of bovine foetal serum. PI animals excrete BVD virus in all their secretions and excretions through out their lives. BVD serology provides a convenient means of monitoring for BVD re-infection in herds that have achieved BVD freedom. transient infection can result in the circulation of virus in herds for prolonged periods, without the presence of a PI animal. PI animals of 0.8% (UK), 0.75% (Belgium), 1.1-1.4% (Denmark), 0.9% (Germany) and 0.9% (Poland) the maximum national prevalence of BVD virus is likely not to exceed 2% [27] BVDV is the most common contaminant of bovine foetal serum. it is the most common contaminant of bovine foetal serum due to the capacity of the virus to spread transplacen. general model of BVDV control BVDV control programmes are based on the three pillars of (i) biosecurity, (ii) virus elimination and (iii) monitoring. this involves monitoring the effectiveness of virus elimination in infected herds and detecting new infections in previously BVD-free herds. for economic reasons, this should be targeted at immunologically nave animals. systematic control involves a widespread reduction in the prevalence of BVD virus and PI animals, typically on a sectoral, regional or national basis. progress needs to be monitored and evaluated. s into herds that had gained freedom were often traced back to non-compliance to scheme rules. measures perceived to be of importance in successfully progressing the programme were subsidised testing, gradual introduction of regulations to control contacts between herds and prevention of indirect transmission. support from industry stakeholders was considered crucial for the success of the programme, particularly in achieving involvement of all beef herds. the legislation requires all PI cattle be destroyed within seven days of confirmation. only animals that have been tested as BVD free can be traded. there is no federal compensation, however, some states have a semi-state insurance fund. the prevalence of PI calves at birth has fallen from 1.5% in 2008 to less than 0.2% in 2010 [49]. farmers are paid compensation for the removal of PI cattle (300 CHF per persistently infected animal per number of newborns per year), buying-in stock, using communal summer grazing. voluntary BVD eradication programmes operated under the auspices of CHeCS have been available in Scotland for several years. from 22 September 2010 until 31 March 2011, all identified PI cattle will be required to be slaughtered or housed in secure facilities. from September 2012, all identified PI cattle will be required to be slaughtered or housed in secure facilities. improved calf health was the primary motivator among farmers for BVD control. this improvement resulted along with reduced medicine usage and enhanced welfare. it proved difficult to motivate those farmers to be interested in regions of Sweden where there was a low prevalence of disease. a mandatory BVD control programme was introduced in all german states. the federal government in Bonn has set baseline requirements for BVD control. they are free to go beyond the baseline requirements, but must comply with the minimal requirements. the legislation requires all PI cattle be destroyed within seven days of confirmation. the programme was originally planned to start in 2007, but this was postponed until 2008 to ensure it would run smoothly. all young bovine animals tested before being moved to summer pastures. all cattle not yet tested were now to be tested with exception of farms that have only cattle destined for direct slaughter (fattening farms) BVD was successfully eradicated from the Shetland Islands in the mid 1990s. it was reintroduced to the islands through purchase of a PI animal. despite good initial progress this has stalled due to incomplete participation by the farming population. a herd-based study of randomly selected Irish herds found a herd-level seroprevalence of 98.7% [54] there was no significant difference between dairy and beef herds (98.5% versus 98.8%, respectively) the maximum national prevalence of PI cattle is not likely to exceed 2% [27] a prohibition on the sale of PI cattle and pregnant cattle from infected herds must ultimately be put in place to address the herd-to-herd spread of BVD. a prohibition on the sale of PI cattle and pregnant cattle from infected herds must ultimately be put in place. a pan-European study of attitudes toward BVD control and eradication cited low farmer motivation as a major obstacle to controlling the disease. in the same study, respondents identified the need for a systematic, well coordinated approach as crucial for programme success. a baseline survey of dairy herds using bulk antibodies was carried out in Sweden six months prior to the launch of the programme. motivation of farmers to control BVD has been the primary motivator for dealing with BVD in the various countries where control programmes have been instigated. it is difficult to maintain farmer enthusiasm with prolonged eradication programmes. this creates a sense of fatigue and reduces enthusiasm. trade between northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is one such political factor. in 2009, 12,700 were imported into Ireland, with half coming from the UK. if one country decides to move forward on BVD control, then animals would need to be tested free of BVD. the antibodies test is currently based on antibody and virus detection. modern virus detection techniques are much more cost effective than heretofore. combining virus isolation tests with antibody serology in juvenile animals can be used to monitor the effectiveness of the virus elimination tests. a baseline survey of dairy herds using bulk antibody tests was carried out in Sweden six months prior to the launch of the programme. it categorised herds into those likely to be free of disease, and herds likely to have current or recent infection. in this way, resources could be targeted at those herds more likely to be infected and those herds that are likely to be free of disease could be advised on remaining free of disease. a survey of BVD experts, private veterinary practitioners, the farming press and farm advisers was considered the three most effectives conduits for increasing farmers' awareness and understanding of BVD. this means the various stakeholders agree on the message and farmers receive this single message from all players in the eradication programme. the border are considering BVD control. but if one country decides to move forward on BVD control, then animals being traded would need to be tested free of BVD. the need for central coordination includes a central database. BVD is considered by farmers and veterinary surgeons as one of the most significant infectious diseases affecting cattle. BVD is considered by farmers and veterinary surgeons as one of the most significant infectious diseases affecting cattle. many countries have successfully and others are embarking on eradication. well coordinated programmes have the most success, while voluntary programmes can make good initial progress they ultimately fail. the farming community must buy into any proposed programme, and without their support failure is likely. a large majority of farmers must be supportive for the programme to succeed."}
