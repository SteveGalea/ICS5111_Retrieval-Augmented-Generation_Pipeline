{"summary": "the expression \u201coxidative stress\u201d appears in the scientific literature in the 1970s. it implies that in aerobic organisms can molecular oxygen (O2) be reduced to water in the biochemical process known as respiration, which requires 4 electrons, but O2 can also be reduced to other intermediate species, between O2 and water. oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases and conditions, from aging to inflammation and carcinogenesis. small molecules also act as ROS scavengers. scavenger must be an easily oxidizable target for ROS. it must be present at concentrations high enough that the probability that a ROS reacts with the scavenger is higher than that of reacting with another target. ases that facilitate the inactivation of a wide range of peroxides. the key role of GSH as an antioxidant is demonstrated by many studies showing that experimental depletion of GSH levels has a worsening effect in many disease models. many noninfectious diseases of the respiratory system, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and oxygen toxicity, have an inflammatory component. inflammation is also implicated in the lung toxicity of ozone, asbestos, silica, cigarette smoke, and particulate matter. oxidative stress is implicated in pathogenesis of several diseases and conditions, from aging to inflammation and carcinogenesis. oxidative stress is demonstrated by the existence of several antioxidant enzymes devoted to ROS detoxification, such as peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxins. a scavenger, including any thiol antioxidant, would normally act as a suicidal decoy, being oxidized and thus becoming useless. when GSH is oxidized, it forms GSH disulfide (GSSG) and this can be re-reduced by a specific enzyme, glutathione reductase. innate immunity is a complex set of responses triggered when specific cells recognize even a yet unknown pathogen by characteristics common to most pathogens. this activates a response that involves production of ROS, a major bactericidal mechanism, and of soluble mediators (cytokines) the same mechanisms and mediators of host defense are implicated in the pathogenesis of (noninfectious) inflammatory diseases. glutathione synthetase (GS) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting about 70 patients in the world. patients with severe GS deficiency show an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. the use of stable radioisotopes allowed the characterization of cysteine metabolism and GSH synthesis in septic patients. this study showed that sepsis decreases blood GSH synthesis by 60%. glutathione synthetase (GS) deficiency (oxoprolinuria) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting about 70 patients in the world. patients with severe GS deficiency show increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. a decrease in gamma-cystathionase activity in the liver was reported. in AIDS patients, a decrease in gamma-cystathionase activity in the liver was reported. this study showed that sepsis decreases blood GSH synthesis by 60%. a protective role of GSH against inflammatory pathologies of the lung has been demonstrated by the protective effect of different GSH-precursors in various animal models. this includes chemically induced pulmonary edema,21 cigarette smoke,31 carrageenan-induced pleurisy rat NAC. an increased susceptibility to sepsis-induced ARDS and lethality34 was observed in mice lacking the transcription factor Nrf2. patients with IPF have a 4-fold lower GSH concentration in the epithelial lining fluid of the normal lower respiratory tract. in antigen degradation and processing is the reduction of disulfide bonds,42 which requires GSH. it is required to maintain an adequate interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by dendritic cells. this essential role of GSH in immunity might explain why in many diseases, not only AIDS, decreased GSH levels are associated with an increased susceptibility to infection. pleurisy rat NAC Decreased inflammation and oxidative stress. depleting endogenous GSH with BSO had a worsening effect in some of the models above. gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase.35 is an example of lung disease in which normalizing the GSH deficit has positive effects. patients with IPF have a 4-fold lower GSH concentration in the epithelial lining fluid of the normal lower respiratory tract. the administration of the GSH precursor NAC restores GSH levels37. many diseases, not only AIDS, are associated with increased susceptibility to infection. these include COPD,46 cystic fibrosis,47,48 influenza infection,49 and alcoholism,50,51 as ethanol impairs Th1/Th2 balance via GSH depletion. AIDS patients have a deficit in the enzyme gamma cystathionase. AIDS causes a decrease in intracellular GSH in CD4 T cells. lower GSH levels in AIDS patients could have various consequences. a parallel decrease in GSH suggests that GSH reacts with NO to form S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) under these experimental conditions, GSH depletion with BSO inhibited the microbicidal activity of macrophages while its precursor NAC increased intracellular killing of mycobacteria. ARDS is one of the most serious complications in critically ill septic patients. many studies have pointed out a role for oxidative stress in ARDS. many studies have pointed out a role for oxidative stress in ARDS. a realistic animal model is that puncturing the cecum causes the release of fecal material in the peritoneum that results in a polymicrobial peritoneal sepsis. we have used this model to study the role of endogenous GSH in sepsis.86 In this model, CLP induced PMN infiltration in the peritoneal cavity. the role of oxidative stress in the pulmonary damage by influenza virus is well characterized in the mouse model. mice show pulmonary damage associated with a dramatic decrease in pulmonary GSH levels as well as an increase of oxidative stress markers such as oxidized glutathione (GSSG) AIDS patients have a deficit in the enzyme gamma cystathionase. AIDS causes a decrease in intracellular GSH in CD4 T cells. lower GSH levels in AIDS patients could have various consequences. the trans-sulfuration pathway converts methionine into cysteine and has a key role in maintaining cysteine, and hence GSH levels, is essential for mycobacterial killing. in vitro, both GSH and GSNO have direct bactericidal activity against these pathogens. many studies have pointed out a role for oxidative stress in ARDS. many studies have shown a protective effect of GSH precursors. most of the studies of ARDS in animal models are based on the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin. a concomitant decrease in endogenous GSH worsened the clinical settings. lowering GSH with BSO had the opposite effect of reducing PMN infiltration to the lung. as a result we had more inflammation and less immunity, and survival was dramatically decreased. the molecular mechanisms of GSH-mediated redox regulation are being investigated. the molecular mechanisms of GSH-mediated redox regulation are being investigated."}
