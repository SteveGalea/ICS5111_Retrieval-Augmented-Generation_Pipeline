{"summary": "the swine flu outbreak was the first pandemic in more than 40 years. for many, their first encounter with a major influenza outbreak. the swine flu outbreak was the first pandemic in more than 40 years. the world health organisation (WHO) had encouraged governments to coordinate a strategic public health response for dealing with such an event. in the spring of 2009, a public awareness campaign was launched to slow the potential spread of swine flu. scientists identified key differences between swine flu and seasonal influenza. mortality data showed that swine flu had been less lethal than first feared and case fatality rates compared favourably with previous influenza pandemics, [9] accounting for less than 500 deaths in the UK [10] and 18,000 worldwide. up until this pandemic the UK population had been relatively unaffected by SARS and avian flu, and the government had little experience planning for a pandemic. this study aims to gain new insights into public understandings of the role of key players in the recent pandemic. aims to explore how people deciphered the threat and perceived whether they could control the risks. a topic guide for the discussions was developed from a rigorous review of the literature. participants completed a demographic questionnaire recording information on age, whether they had children, any health issues, and if offered, would accept or reject swine flu vaccination. each group was audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. focus group methods can generate rich and dynamic data by encouraging discussion between group members. but sometimes the chaotic nature of focus group conversation can make it difficult to identify all the individuals. this was particularly challenging in this study. group discussions were facilitated by ES and lasted between one and two hours. each transcript was checked and imported into NVivo 7. each transcript was repeatedly re-examined and cross-compared to identify common themes and underlying reasoning. participants were aged between 16 years of age and 60. thirty six believed they would accept swine flu vaccination for themselves or their children if offered. focus group participants group Pseudonym (age) had SF children accept vaccine greater risk from SF.

I think my immune system is working well\" information sources to assess the threat Participants identified two key sources as providing information to help them assess the threat from swine flu. participants also judged that since the summer of 2009 there had been a decline in media interest. participants often expressed concern with how the media deliberately tried to induce unnecessary panic. participants in another group assessed the media's role as an information source. the media also criticized for covering swine flu at the expense of more serious diseases which pose a greater threat to lives. one participant explained her frustration and questioned: \"can you actually rely on the media to give you the proper information\"\" focus group 13: Craig: they did what I would expect them to have done. they reacted in proportion to the people's expectations, he says. participants expressed the view that they felt reassured by the government. participants were asked about their views on the development of a swine flu vaccine. the key concerns were about the speed of its development and whether it had been sufficiently trialled. one participant said: \"they haven't tested the implications on your body in five years time or ten years time\" participants discussed weighing up the risks and benefits of swine flu vaccination if offered. they were split between accepting, refusing vaccination and being undecided. participants expressed concern over the safety of the vaccine. one woman said: \"it worries me, but not enough not to get the vaccination\" participants were unsure whether they could trust the advice to vaccinate. one mother questioned: \"do they know how much of the vaccine to put into his body\" another mother weighed up the risks and considered: \"i wouldn't do it [vaccinate] because I don't think the risk of swine flu is great enough for my children\" a pandemic in this century would be unlike past pandemics. participants across all the groups spoke about how they felt the threat had changed over the months since it first emerged in Mexico. but once cases were confirmed in the UK and public health officials appeared unable to contain it they viewed it as more threatening. people in Britain had become more familiar with swine flu and less fearful of it. a typical view was that: \"At first, it was like we're all going to die...but before long we knew we weren't and it was just no big deal\" but now so many people have had it it's not really that big a deal, it's just the flu. participants who deemed themselves healthy assessed swine flu as less of a threat. those with underlying health problems or who considered themselves to be in an 'at risk' group felt most threatened by swine flu. mothers who were caring for young children with health problems seemed especially anxious. pregnant women also showed greater levels of concern. participants identified two key sources to assess the threat from swine flu. media coverage of swine flu was described as'scaremongering' in three groups the media were also criticized for covering swine flu at the expense of more serious diseases which pose a greater threat to lives. only 8 participants believed that they had increased hand washing or use of tissues since the campaign. but the government were generally viewed as having handled the swine flu situation reasonably well. focus group 13: Craig: \"they did what I would expect them to have done\" participants were asked about their views on the development of a swine flu vaccine. the issue of vaccine safety cropped up in all the groups. one participant said: \"they haven't tested the implications on your body in five years time or ten years\" swine flu is H1N1, swine flu is H1N1, and swine flu is H1N1. participants also knew little about seasonal influenza vaccines and wondered if they would be effective against swine flu. participants were split between accepting, refusing vaccination and being undecided. participants expressed concerns about vaccine safety. one mother weighed up risks and considered: \"i wouldn't do it [vaccinate] because I don't think the risk of swine flu is great enough for my children\" one mother whose son had asthma believed her son was prone to illnesses and chest infections. the aim of this study was to conduct an in-depth exploration of public perceptions and concerns during the swine flu pandemic. the study was to gain insights into how people deciphered the threat and perceived they could control the risks. there were more women than men who took part in this study (almost a ratio of 5:1) despite believing there was a high likelihood of contracting swine flu, there was little evidence that participants assessed swine flu as life threatening for healthy people. this finding adds further weight to the notion that even during the period when there were more swine flu cases, the public were not unduly anxious [22] participants were well informed about the government's public awareness campaign, 'Catch it, bin it, kill it', and how swine flu could be transmitted from person to person. but few indicated that they had changed their behaviours, a finding consistent with a large survey examining behaviours during the early phase of swine flu pandemic. a systematic analysis of newsprint media coverage has found no evidence of exaggerating the content of reporting. participants also assessed that the media purposefully tried to induce worry which in turn increased their scepticism about the 'true' threat. however, people also judged that exaggerative journalism tended to have a greater influence on others than on oneself. public awareness campaign appeared to confirm what people already thought they knew but failed to challenge them to consider their own behaviour. there was general support for the government's handling of the pandemic and for the media as a useful information source."}
