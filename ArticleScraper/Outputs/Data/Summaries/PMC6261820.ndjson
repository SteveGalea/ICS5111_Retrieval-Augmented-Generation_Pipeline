{"summary": "PK-15 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated newborn bovine serum (Gibco BRL, Now York, MD, U.S.A.), at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 chamber. the antibody against TGEV N protein was prepared by our laboratory. samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) second antibody (Rhodamine-conjugated IgG) was incubated for 1 hr in the dark. then, 4\u2019, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were used to counterstain cell nuclei for 10 min. RNA analysis by qRT-PCR RNA extraction and qRT-PCR were performed as previously the positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using Beckman CytoFLEX FCM (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, U.S.A.) the positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using Beckman CytoFLEX FCM. fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC), Rhodamine and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from the Thermo Scientific Pierce (Pierce, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.) the antibody against TGEV N protein was prepared by our laboratory. RNA analysis by qRT-PCR RNA extraction and qRT-PCR were performed as our previously described [7]. a total of 10,000 cells were examined after incubation for 30 min. annealed fragments of gRNA were cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid. psPAX2 packaging plasmid co-transfected into HEK293T cells to generate the lentivirus. RESULTS TGEV infection induced AIF translocation to the nucleus. in the mitochondria and nucleus was calculated by densitometry of the bands after normalization to Cox4 and histone respectively. results are expressed as means SD from three independent experiments. NP partly abrogated TGEV-induced apoptosis. results suggest that AIF pathway might be involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis. PK-15 cells were incubated with 20 M ABT-888 for 1 hr. cells were then infected with TGEV for 36 hr. PDTC significantly attenuated the cleavage of PARP-1. the results indicated that ROS may play a vital role in TGEV-induced AIF activation. the effect of PDTC on the activation of PARP-1 was calculated by densitometry of the corresponding bands after normalization to actin. p53 mediated AIF mRNA expression and AIF translocation. the effect of PFT- on the mRNA expression of AIF. cells were pretreated with 20 M of PFT- for 1 hr. the total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and analyzed. p53 protein was completely eliminated by the gRNA-generated clone. wild-type PK15 cells (WT) and PK15 p53 knockout cells (PK15p53/) were infected with TGEV. mRNA expression and translocation of AIF were reduced markedly in absence of p53. caspase inhibitors of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathway blocked TGEV-induced apoptosis. cells were infected with TGEV for 36 hr, subsequently cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. the protein expression of AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus was calculated by densitometry of the corresponding bands after normalization to Cox4 and histone. results are expressed as means SD from three independent experiments. NP partly abrogated TGEV-induced apoptosis. results suggest that AIF pathway might be involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis. PK-15 cells were incubated with 20 M ABT-888 for 1 hr. they were then infected with TGEV for 36 hr. the total protein and cleaved protein levels of PARP-1 were calculated. PK-15 cells were treated with PDTC (100 M) and infected with TGEV for 36 hr. the effect of PDTC on the activation of PARP-1 was calculated by densitometry of the bands after normalization to actin. p53 mediated AIF mRNA expression and AIF translocation. cells were pretreated with 20 M of PFT- for 1 hr. total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, and analyzed by qRT-PCR. cells were treated as in (D), then the lysates were analyzed by Western blot. to rule out the contribution of the PFT- inhibitor, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to mutate the p53 gene. combining inhibitors of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathway blocked TGEV-induced apoptosis. cells were infected with TGEV for 36 hr, then subjected to flow cytometric analysis. PARP-1 inhibition could reduce redistribution of AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus. but the total protein levels of PARP-1 were not absolutely inhibited in TGEV-infected cells. this suggests that TGEV might activate PARP-1 to induce AIF translocation. p53 takes effects on caspase-dependent apoptosis [2, 22], but also drives the efficient activation of AIF through regulating AIF gene expression, to mediate a caspase-independent death pathway [25]. similar results were found in TGEV-infected p53/ cells."}
