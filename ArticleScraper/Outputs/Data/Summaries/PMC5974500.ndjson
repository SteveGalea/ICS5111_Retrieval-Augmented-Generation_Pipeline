{"summary": "the subfamily Coronavirinae of the family Coronaviridae is classified into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (1). most of the gammacoronaviruses (GammaCoVs) have been identified in avian species, whereas bats are considered the original host for the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus. PDCoV is closely related to the sparrow CoV-HKU17 (more than 90% amino acid identities in all seven domains in ORF1a/1b) they are believed to be subspecies of the same species. identification of cellular receptors used by CoV for binding and entry into host cells is critical to understanding pathogenesis. a cross-genus coV functional receptor for both porcine DeltaCoV (PDCoV) and AlphaCoV (TGEV) based on three lines of evidence. a soluble S1-Fc fusion protein of PDCoV bound to the surface of target cell lines known to express pAPN as efficiently as TGEV-S1-Fc. both PDCoV-S1 and TGEV-S1 interacted with pAPN. soluble TGEV-S1-hFc bound to target LLC-PK1 and ST cells. soluble PDCoV-S1 bound to nonsusceptible Vero or BHK-21 cells. soluble PDCoV-S1 binding was not detected in vero or BHK-21 cells. both LLC-PK1 and ST cells had endogenous expression of pAPN. vero and BHK-21 cells lacked corresponding APN expression. expression of pAPN was detected in vero-pAPN cells. expression of transfected Fc-tagged proteins and pAPN was confirmed in whole-cell lysates by WB with anti-Fc Ab and anti-Myc Ab. transfected BHK-21 cells were then immunoprecipitated with Fc tag preadsorbed onto protein A-conjugated agarose beads. expression level of pAPN-Myc is more abundant in lane 4 than in lane 6. BHK-21 cells were transfected with equal amounts (2 g) of the empty vector pFUSE-Fc alone, pFUSE-Fc and pAPN-Myc. whole-cell lysate was preadsorbed onto protein A-conjugated agarose beads prior to SDS-PAGE for co-IP analysis. pAPN-mFc bound to neither pAPN-mFc nor mFc. the soluble pAPN-mFc or mFc was preincubated with TGEV-S1-hFc, PDCoV-S1-hFc, or hFc. the LLC-PK1 or ST cells were then subjected to flow cytometry analysis. TGEV-S1-hFc and PDCoV-S1-hFc bound to BHK-21 or Vero cells stably expressing pAPN (bHK-pAPN and Vero-pAPN, respectively; red histograms) pAPN-mFc preincubation was able to block pAPN and PDCoV-S1-hFc binding to BHK-21 or Vero cells expressing ACE2 cells (blu 1-hFc could be blocked by soluble pAPN-mFc pretreatment. the two S1-hFc soluble proteins did not bind to the parental cell lines. exogenous expression of pAPN in refractory Vero or BHK-21 cells conferred specific susceptibility to PDCoV and TGEV infection. rabbit or anti-mouse IgG was costained for secondary antibody detection. evidence of PDCoV infection in vero-pAPN cells showed cytopathic effects. exogenous pAPN expression allows refractory cell lines to support PDCoV efficient replication and productive infection. PDCoV replication competency, vero-pAPN or PDCoV target LLC-PK1 cells were inoculated with PDCoV (MOI of 0.1) with or without soluble pAPN preincubation. soluble pAPN preincubation with PDCoV blocked viral replication at the early stage (2 and 8 hpi), indicating that replication-competent PDCoV utilizes pAPN as an entry receptor. extracellular PDCoV infectious titers were assessed on fresh LLC-PK1 cells. progeny PDCoV infection of fresh LLC-PK1 cells was also validated by an anti-PDCoV-N Ab. PDCoV N protein was detected by staining with anti-PDCoV-N MAb and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Ab (middle panel) the growth kinetics of TGEV secreted from vero-pAPN cells on fresh LLC-PK1 cells were consistent with the distinct expression levels of N proteins between TGEV and PDCoV. soluble TGEV-S1-hFc bound to target LLC-PK1 and ST cells. soluble PDCoV-s1-hFc bound to target nonsusceptible Vero or BHK-21 cells. soluble PDCoV-s1-hFc bound to target LLC-PK1 and ST cells. cell surface binding was detected by an FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc. soluble PDCoV S1 to LLC-PK1, ST, vero, or BHK-21 cells. pAPN expression was detected on vero-pAPN or pAPN stable cells. pAPN-Myc bound specifically to both PDCoV-S1-hFc and TGEV-S1-hFc. pAPN-Myc did not bind to the control hFc protein. pAPN-Myc did not bind to the control hFc protein. expression level of pAPN-Myc is more abundant in lane 4 than in lane 6. equal amounts of plasmid DNA of PDCoV-S1-hFc and TGEV-S1-hFc served as input. IP result suggests that PDCoV-S1 may have a lower pAPN-binding affinity than TGEV-S1. ine IgG1 Fc (pAPN-mFc) or mFc spotted on nitrocellulose membrane. binding of S1-hFc proteins to pAPN was detected by using an HRP-conjugated anti-human Fc Ab. both PDCoV-S1 and TGEV-S1 physically recognized and interacted with pAPN. soluble pAPN-mFc (10 g/ml) preincubation was able to block TGEV-S1-hFc and PDCoV-S1-hFc binding to permissive LLC-PK1 and ST cells. preincubation with soluble mFc (10 g/ml) did not block TGEV-S1-hFc or PDCoV-S1-hFc binding (black-filled hist full-length cDNA encoding pAPN fused with a Myc tag (pAPN-Myc) was stably expressed by puromycin selection in vero or BHK-21 cell lines. surface expression of pAPN on vero-pAPN or BHK-pAPN cells was validated by flow cytometry of efficient binding of TGEV-S1-hFc and PDCoV-S1-hFc. at 36 h postchallenge, TGEV-challenged cells were costained with a rabbit anti-TGEV-N pAb and a mouse anti-Myc MAb. PDCoV-challenged cells were costained with a mouse anti-PDCoV-N MAb and a rabbit anti-APN pAb. a slightly lower infection efficiency of PDCoV than that of TGEV could be accounted for by the possibly lower pAPN-binding affinity of PDCoV-S1. development of cytopathic effects (CPEs) characterized by cell rounding, aggregation, and subsequent detachment in PDCoV-infected vero-pAPN cells was observed. the progressive PDCoV release into the cultured medium (extracellular) was determined by dynamic viral RNA synthesis and virus titers. both extracellular and intracellular PDCoV RNA and extracellular virus titers could be detected in the supernatants of vero-pAPN and the control LLC-PK1 cells but not in the supernatants of vero cells. TGEV released into the supernatant of inoculated vero-pAPN, vero, or LLC-PK1 cells was determined in triplicate on fresh LLC-PK1 cells. samples of supernatants and cells were collected at intervals between 2 and 72 h postinoculation. PDCoV in the newly defined deltacoronavirus genus engages the same pAPN receptor to infect the same target cells as TGEV (9), likely leading to induction of clinical signs of diarrhea in piglets. pAPN, human APN (hAPN) and green monkey APN are not functional receptors for PEDV in cultured porcine, human, or vero cells. pAPN cells were susceptible to TGEV and PDCoV but not PEDV infection. the results provide additional evidence of the exclusive engagement of pAPN with PDCoV and TGEV. a related human AlphaCoV, HCoV-229E, uses pAPN but not pAPN. a nearly atomic-level resolution of the structure of the PDCoV S glycoprotein trimer has revealed that the PDCoV RBD displays a -sandwich fold reminiscent of that of AlphaCoVs. however, since PDCoV can also infect some human cell lines, such as Huh-7 expressing hAPN in vitro and calves in vivo, we hypothesize that PDCoV can utilize APNs from other mammalian species as PDCoV-S1 may be different from the VBM1 of HCoV-229E or VBM2 recognized by TGEV. the structural basis for this APN binding by cross-genus CoVs is totally distinct from what has been known for ACE2 binding by SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63. a porcine kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1 (ATCC CL-101), a swine testis cell line, ST (ATCC CRL-1746), a baby hamster kidney fibroblast cell line, BHK-21 (ATCC CCL-10), and an African green monkey kidney epithelial vero cell line (ATCC CCL-81) were individually grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% anti-PDCoV-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibody (MAb) was purchased from Medgene Labs. anti-TGEV-N polyclonal antibody (pAb) was generated in-house. full-length N protein of TGEV with a six-histidine tag expressed in Escherichia coli was purified. pAPN-expressing construct harboring full-length pAPN cDNA fused with a Myc tag at the C terminus was engineered between XhoI and HpaI restriction sites in the lentiviral vector pLV-CMV-PURO. for construction of soluble human IgG1 Fc (hFc) fusion proteins, TGEV-S1 (aa 1 to 832) and PDCoV-S1 (aa 1 soluble hFc and mFc fusion proteins (TGEV-S1-hFc, PDCoV-S1-hFc, hFc, mFc, and pAPN-mFc) were transiently expressed in 293T cells. analysis of purified proteins was performed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to ensure purity and quality. cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with acetone. cells were then incubated with the primary Ab followed by diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. PDCoV RNA titer was monitored by one-step qRT-PCR targeting the membrane (M) gene with the primers 5\u2032-ATCGACCACATGGCTCCAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAGCTCTTGCCCATGTAGCTT-3\u2032 and the probe FAM-CACACCAGTCGTTAAGCT-BHQ. samples with a cycle threshold value of 35 were considered positive based upon validation data using the standard RNA. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after 2 h of incubation, viruses were added to each flask. cells were observed daily to check for any cytopathic effect (CPE) whole-cell cultures were harvested and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles prior to removal of cell debris by centrifugation. expression of pAPN protein in vitro confirmed by transient transfection. pAPN ectodomain encoding amino acids (aa) 62 to 963 (27) amplified from pCI-pAPN and inserted into pFUSE-mIgG1-Fc2 vector. expression plasmid harboring full-length pAPN cDNA fused with a Myc tag at the C terminus. receptor ACE2, pCMV3-Flag-ACE2 (HG10108-NF) was purchased from Sino Biological, Inc. (Beijing, China) two stable cell lines, vero-pAPN and BHK-pAPN, were established in vero and BHK-21 cells by transfection with the construct pAPN-Myc followed by selection with 10 g/ml of puromycin. expression of the pAPN-Myc fusion protein was confirmed by blocking of S1-hFc was performed by preincubation with soluble pAPN-mFc or mFc for 2 h prior to performance of a surface binding assay. transfected cells were cultured for 36 to 72 h and then subjected to immunofluorescence assay, co-IP, or Western blotting to detect protein expression or interaction. proteins were detected using the primary Ab followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary Ab. total RNA was extracted from supernatant medium and cell lysates of PDCoV-inoculated cells at different time points."}
