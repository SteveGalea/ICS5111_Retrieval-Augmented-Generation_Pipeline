Agricultural Defense Branch in DHS's Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) has taken steps to reduce FMD virus vulnerabilities starting with an FMD vaccine program that was initiated in 2005. the program continues to work on developing vaccines for other foreign animal diseases, other novel vaccine platforms, and improved vaccines. a staff of 170 people contributed to aniBioThreat from the law enforcement and animal and public health communities. the project led to improved interoperability, updated contingency plans for animal threats (including animal botulism and anthrax), training events, formal exercises, a course for practitioners on early warning and strategic analysis. multidisciplinary approaches are needed at the local, national, and global levels to prevent and mitigate crises at the interface between humans, animals, and the environment. veterinary, human, and environmental health disciplines have in large part remained separate in their work and professional training."}
