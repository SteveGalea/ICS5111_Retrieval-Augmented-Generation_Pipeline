{"summary": "PEDV-associated diarrhoea has been widely detected in Europe. it was first recognized as an enteric disease in 1971 by the British veterinarian. subsequently, it was isolated by Pensaert and de Bouck at Ghent University in Belgium. NA infects the villi by binding to aminopeptidase N (APN) on epithelial cells. a similar process occurs during infection by TGEV [12]. porcine respiratory coronavirus loses its ability to infect the host intestine due to mutation and deletion of the S-protein genomic region occur [16] GE can be simultaneously conducted on multiple sites or genes with the same Cas9 to achieve different targeting purposes. GE can be simultaneously conducted on multiple sites or genes with the same Cas9 to achieve different targeting purposes or reduce the risks of off-targeting [23\u201325]. the animals were fed a restricted (4% body weight) commercial diet formulated to meet the requirements recommended by the National Research Council [29] and had ad libitum access to water. all animals were managed and treated with permission from the Agricultural Technology Research Institute. treatment of donors and recipients Six donors were synchronized and induced to super-ovulate by being fed a ration supplemented with Regumate. after hCG injection, the animals were artificially inseminated and sacrificed 30 to 36 h or 54 to 56 h later, and fertilized eggs were harvested from their oviducts. a mixture of single-guide RNA directed against two sites (sgRNA, 10 ng/L each) and Cas9 RNA (70 ng/L) was microinjected into the cytoplasm near the pronucleus using a capillary needle with steady flow. the female founders were then artificially inseminated with fresh extended semen collected from the male littermate founder to generate homozygous offspring for the study. pT7-Flag2-NLS1-Cas9-NL-S2-3\u2019pA, pSP6-(CMAH ex2)-sgRNA and pSP6-(CMAH in2)-sgRNA were constructed for in vitro transcription. all of the transcribed RNA products were further purified by the MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up Kit (Ambion, AM1908, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for microinjection. primer pairs used to construct sgRNA expression vectors. pCMAH exon 2F CGTC GAAGCTGCCAATCTCAAGGA GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAAT pCMAH intron 2R TGCTATTTCTAGAAAC TCCTTTTCTCTCCCTGGCGATC. NGNA/NANA samples were cut into small pieces in MQ water. 0.5 M H2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 25 mM. mixtures were incubated at 80\u00b0C for 1 h to label the sialic acids. the control piglets were non-gene-edited piglets that were concurrently delivered from wild-type sows at the same farm. all piglets were oral inoculated with PEDV, which diluted in commercial baby formula that had been reconstituted with warm drinking water. all neonatal piglets were nursed for approximately 20 h to permit intake of colostrum and then delivered to a negatively air-conditioned facility. one D/D type and one wild-type piglet without virus treatment served as controls; the latter were not housed with the infected piglets. from 24 hpi to 72 hpi, 20 mL of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution supplemented with 5% glucose was fed to each piglet every 4 h. the piglets were randomly allocated to sacrifice at 24 hpi (3 piglets), 48 hpi (3 piglets), or 72 hpi (6 piglets), and the small intestines were sampled. three small fragments of intestine were subjected to paraffin-embedded tissue sectioning and IHC to confirm the presence of PEDV in intestinal epithelial cells. TCID50 was used according to standard virological methods to determine the viral content of the Jimei PEDV virus preparation used in the challenge study. the entire sample was immersed in 15 mL 10% formalin and fixed for at least 24 hours. the sections were placed on slides, de-waxed in xylene and treated with 100%, 95%, 80% and 70% ethanol. for IF staining, the slides were de-waxed in xylene and heated in boiling TAE buffer for 3 min to activate the antigen. the severity of PEDV infection is better judged by the degree of villar atrophy. infected cells often defoliate from the mucosa and IF may not reveal the cells. the scores combined the results of both IF staining and histopathological inspection. the gilts or sows were housed indoors on concrete floors. the accommodation was artificially lit (450\u2013600 lux for 9 hours a day) all animals were managed and treated with permission from the Agricultural Technology Research Institute (ATRI) treatment of donors and recipients Six donors were synchronized and induced to super-ovulate by being fed a ration supplemented with Regumate. after hCG injection, the animals were artificially inseminated and sacrificed 30 to 36 h or 54 to 56 h later, and fertilized eggs were harvested from their oviducts. the micro-manipulation was conducted under an inverted DIC microscope. each embryo was held in the proper position to reveal the pronucleus. a mixture of single-guide RNA directed against two sites (sgRNA, 10 ng/L each) and Cas9 RNA (70 ng/L) was microinjected into the cytoplasm near the pronucleus using a capillary needle with steady flow. ppU6-(CMAH ex2)-sgRNA and ppU6-(CMAH in2)-sgRNA were constructed. pT7-Flag2-NLS1-Cas9-NLS2-3\u2019pA, pSP6-(CMAH ex2)-sgRNA and pSP6-(CMAH in2)-sgRNA were constructed for in vitro transcription. the sequences underlined in black are PCR primers (CMAH Ex2 F and CMAH Ex2 R) the blue arrows indicate the gene editing sites. primer pairs used to construct sgRNA expression vectors. direct sequencing (PDS) and PCR product/TA cloning/sequencing (PTS) were conducted by mission biotech Ltd. (Taipei, Taiwan) at least 6 colonies were picked and sequenced from the latter. escence detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 373 nm and an emission wavelength of 448 nm. all CMAH KO neonatal piglets were delivered from three female founders that were served by the male F0 founder. all founders were biallelic CMAH mutants carrying a biallelic 161-bp deletion (D/D type) or one allele deleted. all neonatal piglets were nursed for approximately 44 h to permit intake of colostrum and dam\u2019s milk. the detailed conditions of the PEDV challenge were the same as those used in experiment I and II. the piglets were fed 20 mL of sow\u2019s milk by hand every 4 h. whole milk was fed at 4 and 8 hpi, and skim milk was fed from 12 to 24 hpi. the piglets were randomly allocated to sacrifice at 24 hpi (3 piglets), 48 hpi (3 piglets), or 72 hpi (6 piglets), and the small intestines were sampled. all neonatal piglets were nursed for approximately 20 h to allow intake of colostrum and then delivered to a negatively air-conditioned facility. the detailed conditions of the PEDV challenge were the same as those used in experiment I and II. piglets were fed 20 mL of sow\u2019s milk by hand every 4 h. from 24 hpi to 72 hpi, 20 mL of lactated Ringer\u2019s solution supplemented with 5% glucose was fed to each piglet every 4 h. piglets were randomly allocated to sacrifice at 24 hpi (3 piglets), 48 hpi (3 piglets), or 72 hpi (6 piglets), and the small the nv-PEDV used in the challenge was prepared by oral inoculation of new born piglets that had not received colostrum. the piglets were sacrificed 16\u201324 h after the observation of diarrhoea symptoms. the small intestinal content was collected by injection of 50 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10x P/S into the lumen. CMAH mutant and wild-type piglets were inoculated with 103 TCID50/10 mL PEDV orally by hand using a syringe. when the piglets died or at the end of the experiment, their body weights were recorded, and they were necropsied on the same day. the samples of intestine obtained from the piglets were sliced, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 3 to 4 m thickness. the sections were placed on slides, de-waxed in xylene and 100% ethanol. for IF staining, the slides were de-waxed in xylene and then heated in boiling TAE buffer for 3 min to activate the antigen. the scores combined the results of both IF staining and histopathological inspection. IF is scored as G1 to G4 based on the relative intensity of staining. the yellow bars represent 200 m. KO revealed that 1 male (L667-02) and 3 females (L667-10, -11, and -12) carried 161-bp deletion mutations. further analysis by PCR-directive sequencing (PDS) showed that the 4 live piglets and the stillborn piglet were biallelic CMAH mutants. KO was 7.5% based on the number of manipulated embryos and 83.3% based on the number of delivered piglets. four lines of CMAH gene-edited piglets were obtained. the amplicons were produced a 161-pb deleted band. the amplicons were produced a deleted band when two sites editing occurred simultaneously. all founders and their offspring are biallelic mutants that fail to express CMAH and produce no NGNA in their tissues. results show that all founders and their offspring are biallelic mutants that fail to express CMAH. genetypes: D indicates deleted and M refers to a site I mutation in exon 2 and null CMAH expression. +1 indicates the indel with a 161-bp deletion and a 1-bp insertion. -5 indicates the presence of a 161-bp deletion with simultaneous deletion of 5 additional bp (-5 bp). neonatal piglets challenged with nv-PEDV Exp showed clinical signs of vomiting and diarrhoea at 12 hours post-inoculation. a second animal died at 52 hpi, a third at 68 hpi, and the remaining three animals were moribund and nearly dead at 72 hpi. no. of neonatal piglets with viability and clinical signs: viability\u2014A is normal, B indicates decreased activity, C is moribund, and v is vomiting. 3-day-old neonatal piglets\u2019 survival curve after inoculation with nv-PEDV. three moribund piglets are classified as dead piglets. body weights changes 72 h after inoculation with nv-PEDV. KO and WT are knockout treated and wild-type treated animals. neonatal piglets were fed sows\u2019 milk and skim milk every 4 hours for 24 hours. the piglets were replaced by Ringer\u2019s lactate solution supplemented with 5% glucose. the results show that until 12 hpi both the CMAH KO and WT piglets appeared normally active. 1C/ 3B/ - - - - 3n 2n1v 3d 1v2d 3d 48 2# 2A/ 2A/ 2B/ 2B/ 2B/ 2B/ 1B1C/ 2B/ 2B/ 2B/ 2B/ 1B1C/ 2B/ - - - - 2n 1n1v 2d 2d 1n1d 1n1d 72 6 6A/ 6A/ 6B/ 6B ized piglets were necropsied, and their intestines were sampled for pathological examination. the PEDV induced histopathologic changes, including enterocyte necrosis, degeneration, and exfoliation, were noted in all challenged piglets. however, these lesions varied from mild to severe, and the lesions were more severe in the moribund WT piglets than in the CMAH KO piglets. most piglets seemed to improve compared with those at 24 and 48 hpi. panels indicate wild-type and knockout piglets, respectively, after PEDV oral inoculation. the immunofluorescence and histopathological score of piglet small intestine at 72 h after oral Inoculation of 2 (I)- or 3 (II)-day old neonates with PEDV. hpi1 Genotype2 No. of piglets Jejunum Ileum. PCR analysis of CMAH KO revealed that 1 male (L667-02) and 3 females (L667-10, -11, and -12) carried 161-bp deletion mutations. KO was 7.5% based on the number of manipulated embryos and 83.3% based on the number of delivered piglets. four lines of CMAH gene-edited piglets were obtained. the amplicons were produced a 161-pb deleted band when two sites editing occurred simultaneously. the mutation occurred at site I of exon II of the CMAH gene. in exps. II and III, the D/D piglets were supplemented with 1 and 3 D/M type piglets, respectively. the null expression of the CMAH gene was analysed based on the detection of NGNA/NANA. the results show that all founders and their offspring are biallelic mutants that fail to express CMAH and produce no NGNA in their tissues. genetypes: D indicates deleted and M refers a site I mutation in exon 2 and null CMAH expression. +1 indicates the indel with a 161-bp deletion and a 1-bp insertion. the mutation occurred at two sites simultaneously and resulted in a 161-bp deletion, whereas M is site I-mutated, on codon region and null CMAH expression. the controls are wild-type piglets. no. of neonatal piglets with viability and clinical signs: viability\u2014A is normal, B indicates decreased activity, C is moribund, and v is vomiting. the 3-day-old neonatal piglets were examined as in exp. I. two piglets were lost at 48 hpi, 4 piglets died at 56 hpi. piglets were fed sows\u2019 milk and skim milk every 4 hours for 24 hours. they were then replaced by Ringer\u2019s lactate solution supplemented with 5% glucose. results show that until 12 hpi both piglets appeared normally active. only 3/11 CMAH KO piglets did not show diarrhoea or vomiting. piglets with viability and clinical signs: viability\u2014A is normal, B indicates decreased ability, C is morib. neonatal piglets challenged with nv-PEDV were necropsied after 72 hpi. all of the dead and euthanized piglets were necropsied and their intestines were sampled for pathological examination. if the epithelial cells were defoliated from the villi, no positive signals would be expected. the severity of the intestinal lesions in KO piglets (3.70.3 to 4.20.2) less than those in WT piglets (4.80.2) in exp. II. there were no significant difference in I/H scores of WT and CMAH KO piglets (p>0.05) in exp. III. KO3 (B) shows a sample from a wild-type piglet. panels are fluorescent stained with nv-PEDV antibody and DAPI. the yellow bars indicate 200 m. KO = CMAH gene knockout by gene editing; WT = wild-type piglets. one convincing report showed that CD163 gene-edited pigs generated by CRISPR/Cas9 showed little vulnerability to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection either in vitro or in vivo. NGNA present in cow\u2019s milk-based formula would enable the virus to infect the CMAH KO piglets. at least 3 of the 11 CMAH KO piglets showed normal activity and no clinical signs (no vomiting or diarrhoea) at 12 hpi, while the WT piglets displayed vomiting and/or diarrhoea. CMAH KO piglets exhibited delayed infection and minor symptoms after oral PEDV inoculation. it is known that PEDV causes severe enteric disease in suckling piglets [44,45] and less severe disease in older weaned pigs [46]. in exp. III, the clinical symptoms of 2-day-old piglets were similar to those of the 3-day-old piglets in exp. II. the epithelial cells of the villi showed less damage and/or increased recovery of epithelial cells from the crypts. this benefit of oral rehydration therapy in acute viral diarrhoea could be attributed to glucose-facilitated sodium absorption. s generated by gene editing could be a new breed with less susceptibility to PEDV, a source animal for medical materials and xenografts. pT7-Flag2-NLS1-Cas9-NLS2-3\u2019pA and pSP6-CMAH-sgRNA vectors are used for in vitro transcription Cas9 mRNA and CMAH-sgRNA, respectively. CMAH gene-edited offspring from the second parity were further subcloned into the TA vector for colony purification and sequencing. the PCR products that revealed more than one band were further subcloned into the TA vector for colony purification and sequencing. the blue line show a non-specific peak with retention time (RT) at 9.51\u20139.52 min. the RT of NGNA peak are 9.671\u20139.737 min near the non-specific peak."}
