{"summary": "method A GeXP-based multiplex RT-PCR assay (GeXP assay) was developed to detect simultaneously sixteen different respiratory virus types/subtypes. seventeen sets of chimeric primers were used to initiate the RT-PCR, and one pair of universal primers was used for the subsequent cycles of the RT-PCR. viral culture is time-consuming and has low sensitivity for the detection of some respiratory viruses that have fastidious growth requirements. the traditional assays used to diagnose respiratory viruses are viral culture and immunofluorescent staining. new multitarget, high-throughput detection platform integrates reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and labeled amplified products in a multiplex PCR assay followed by fluorescence capillary electrophoresis separation based on the size of the amplified products. system has been used previously in identifying rapidly gene expression prostate cancer biomarker signatures in biological samples. a total of 126 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children under two years of age. a total volume of 0.5 ml of nasopharyngeal aspirates was collected from children under two years of age. chimeric primers, one pair of internal control primers and one pair of universal primers designed for the RT-PCR. the chimeric primers consisted of a gene-specific sequence fused at the 5\u2019 end to the universal sequence. the specific sequences were selected by alignment of all sequences available for each virus from the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) GenBank Database. 4 PIV2 R GTACGACTCACTATAGGGACCCCTAAAAGAGATGAGCCC PIV3 F AGGTGACACTATAGAATATTGTCAATTATGATGATGGYTCAATCT HA 230 PIV3 R GTACGACTCACTATAGAATGAGAATGAGATGGGGYTCAATCT HA 230 PIV3 R GTACGACTCACTATAGAATGTCAATTATGATGGYTCAATCT HA extracts were eluted in 50 l of DNase- and RNase-free water and stored at 80\u00b0C. RT-PCR was performed with a One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the RT-PCR mixture was subjected to the following amplification conditions: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 10 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s, 20 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 48\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and a final incubation of 72\u00b0C for 3 min. the sensitivity of the assay was also examined by using 16 pre-mixed quantitative viral targets. the RNA/DNA extracted from 126 clinical specimens was tested using the RVP Fast assay in a 96-well plate format. the plasmid DNA was extracted with an E.Z.N.A. Plasmid Mini Kit I. the RNA copy number was calculated after measuring the concentration of the RNA transcribed in vitro using a T7 Large Scale RNA Production System. for the DNA viruses Adv and HBoV, the in vitro transcription was omitted.

Figure 1. all of the 16 pre-mixed viral targets could be detected at the level of 1000 copies of each virus per reaction. detection sensitivity of all pre-mixed viral targets was 1000 copies per reaction in the multiplex assay. results from both assays showed that HRV was found most frequently (68/126), followed by RSVB (46/126) and PIV3 (21/126) in the 126 specimens. 66 specimens with co-infections were detected by the RVP Fast assay. sensitivity, specificity, negative prediction value (NPV) and positive prediction value (PPV) were calculated for the GeXP assay in Table 2. Detection of 16 respiratory viruses in 126 specimens Virus No. of specimens. the sensitivity (True positives, TP), specificity (True negatives, TN), PPV (TP/TP + false positives) and NPV (TN/TN/TN + false negatives) for each target are calculated using the RVP Fast assay as the reference for comparison. the one-step RT-PCR kit from Qiagen revealed the best amplification to perform under our current protocol. the temperature switch PCR (TSP) strategy was adopted to optimize the amplification parameters. the optimal settings for three different denaturation temperatures and the amplification cycle conditions were determined in the current protocol. each virus was 20\u2013200 copies per reaction when the assay was performed separately for each virus. the detection sensitivity for each virus was slightly lower than that for a single type of virus. the detection sensitivity for each virus was similar to that of real-time PCR assays reported in recent years. the detection of coronaviruses (CoV HKU1, CoV NL63, CoV 229E and CoV OC43) by both assays was completely consistent between assays. the detection rate for infections involving two or more viruses was similar for the GeXP assay (68/126) and the RVP Fast assay (66/126). the authors declare that they have no competing interests. a Chinese patent has been filed for the combination of all of the primers specific to the 16 respiratory tract viruses listed in this study. 4-101, 2012ZX10004-215)."}
