{"summary": "direct interactions have been observed between bacteria and influenza A virus (IAV) [1, 2] as well as several enteric viruses. the viral factors involved in the interaction between bacteria and viruses are largely undefined. binding of viruses to bacteria is mediated through bacterial envelope components lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the main component of the gram-negative bacterial envelope, and peptidoglycan (PG) eukaryotic cells use carbohydrate binding sites to recognize multiple receptor molecules. bacterial envelope contains other molecules beyond carbohydrates, including proteins. poliovirus VP1 intimately interacts with other capsid proteins. virus 1 is a fibrous protein that protrudes up to 40 nm from the virion surface. the virion needs to be stable enough to protect the viral genome from environmental exposure during transmission but malleable enough to allow disassembly. attachment fiber 1 undergoes conformational changes following binding to sialic acid. interaction with bacteria or bacterial components may promote a more thermostable 1 conformation. poliovirus gains higher thermostability during transmission from its interaction with bacteria. noV infection in the gut is modulated by bile acids, which are modified by the intestinal microbiota to secondary bile acids. bile acids directly bind HNoV [32] and enhance MNoV cell attachment by promoting engagement of its receptor CD300lf [33] by regulation of capsid conformational changes. caliciviruses have evolved distinct mechanisms to utilize bacteria, bacterial components, or bacterial-modified components to enhance infectivity. respiratory syncytial virus directly binds S. pneumoniae via penicillin-binding protein 1a on the bacterial cell. this binding results in increased bacterial adherence to epithelial cells in vitro and in a small animal model. viruses can use the microbiota and microbial components to modulate the innate immune response to infection. coadministration of inactivated IAV and pneumococcal vaccines enhances pneumococcal- and IAV-specific immune responses in the lung. despite these efforts, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of how bacteria and bacterial components influence viral stability, infectivity, and pathogenesis."}
