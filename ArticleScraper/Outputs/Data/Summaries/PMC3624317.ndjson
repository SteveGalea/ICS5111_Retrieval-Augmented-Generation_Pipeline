{"summary": "in humans, infection results in febrile illness and a subset of patients experience retinitis, hepatitis, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, or death. in humans, infection results in febrile illness and a subset of patients experience spontaneous abortion in pregnant animals. LRs, toll-like receptors (TLRs), nod-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate signaling that can lead to an inflammatory or viral replication-interfering state within the host. RVFV is a negative sense ssRNA virus. TLR3, TLR7, or TLR8 could contribute to recognition and antiviral signaling. RIG-I recognizes shorter blunt-end dsRNA intermediates (23). treatment of isolated clone 13 RNA with shrimp alkaline phosphatase greatly reduced IFN- stimulation (31), suggesting that the 5\u2032-triphosphate moiety was responsible for activation through RIG-I. innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells, will be the major sources of IFN during active RVFV infection. attenuated RVFV strains rMP-12 and NSs del were a gift from Shinji Makino. the NSs del strain was derived from rMP-12 and lacks virulence factor NSs. the samples were handled under biosafety level 2 conditions unless previously inactivated. marrow-derived macrophages were generated by culturing total bone marrow. cells were cultured for 5 days, after which the media and nonadherent cells were removed. differentiated cells were counted, plated, and stimulated at 105 cells per well in a 96-well plate. cells were stimulated with RVFV NSs del at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 2 h to allow for adsorption. the viral load in the supernatant was determined via plaque assay. purity of dendritic cells and macrophages was confirmed with flow cytometry. the dominant-negative constructs RIG-I Dn (RIG-I helicase domain) and MyD88 Dn (TIR domain only) were transfected at the quantities described previously (30, 40) the total DNA in each well was adjusted to 140 ng with pcDNA 3.1. the cells were stimulated with media, RVFV, or control ligands Sendai (SV), Gardiquimod (InvivoGen), R848 (InvivoGen), or mice were infected with 3.5 103 or 3.5 104 PFU of RVFV rMP-12. intranasal challenges were performed by administering 10 l of virus into the noses of anesthetized animals. mortality was recorded throughout the experiment. dilutions were prepared in 1 MEM (Sigma Chemicals) with sodium bicarbonate and 2% FBS. after 1 h of adsorption, viral dilutions were carefully removed and replaced with a 1:1 dilution of 1% agarose. sera from WT and KO mice were assessed for alanine transaminase (ALT) levels for each mouse on the day of harvest using a color endpoint assay. BMDMs or cDCs were plated at 106 cells per well in six-well plates and then mock infected or infected with rMP-12 or NSs del. total RNA was isolated at 6 h postinfection using an RNeasy minikit (Qia TRIF were generated by Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) MDA5-deficient mice were provided by Marco Colonna (Washington University) wild-type controls from the same generation were used in MAVS animal experiments. mice were maintained in filter-top microisolator cages in ventilated racks. l bovine serum (FBS), 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM penicillin-streptomycin, and 1/30 total volume addition of J558L supernatant. more than 80% of the cDC population was CD11b+ and CD11c+ as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. differentiated cells were counted, plated, and stimulated at 105 cells in 200 l (total volume) per well in a 96-well plate. cells were stimulated with media only control, poly(IC) (Imgenex), Pam3Cysk4 (InvivoGen), 5\u2032 triphosphate RNA (InvivoGen), Gardiquimod (InvivoGen), R848 (InvivoGen), sendai virus (Charles River hek293XL cells and HEK293XL cells stably transfected with TLR7 or TLR8 were purchased from InvivoGen. total DNA in each well was adjusted to 140 ng with pcDNA 3.1. cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and a protease inhibitor cocktail. protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4% bisacrylamide stacking and 15% bisacrylamide resolving gels. a cell-free sample from 105 cells per well was harvested and inactivated. the cytokine levels were assessed using ELISA. viral dilutions were prepared in 1 MEM (Sigma Chemicals) with sodium bicarbonate and 2% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) after 1 h of adsorption, viral dilutions were carefully removed and replaced with a 1:1 dilution of 1% agarose (Promega) and 2 MEM with 4% FBS. data were analyzed using commercial software (GraphPad) ELISA and cultured macrophage and DC virus load were analyzed using a Student independent t test. comparison of survival curves was performed using a log-rank test. HEK293XL cells were transfected with 0, 10, 50, or 100 ng of RIG-I dominant-negative construct (RIG-I Dn) and stimulated with medium (M) or NSs del at an MOI of 5 for 18 h. expression of the RIG-I-mediated IFN- activation by Sendai virus was confirmed by Western blotting. controls were performed using the NF-B luciferase reporter and the TLR7-specific ligand Gardiquimod (C) or the TLR7/8 ligand R848 (D) for 18 h. the data represent mean values the standard deviations based on triplicate wells. each experiment was performed at least three times. myD88 is an adaptor molecule that can be used by all TLRs except for TLR3 during signaling (9). Activation of the IFN- reporter was not affected by the addition of dominant-negative mutant MyD88 Dn (TIR domain only), suggesting that TLR7 and -8 do not contribute to IFN- promoter activation by RVFV. the dependence of type I IFN production on innate adaptor molecule MAVS was assessed in cDCs (A), macrophages (B), and FLT3L-derived mixed pDCs and cDCs (C) each experiment was performed at least three times. the data represent mean values the standard deviations based on triplicate wells. each experiment was performed at least three times. NS (not significant), P > 0.05. BLD, below the limit of detection. cDCs from Mavs/ mice showed a significantly increased viral burden after infection with either RVFV rMP-12 (Fig. 4A) or NSs del (Fig. 4D) compared to cDCs derived from WT cells. macrophages from Mavs/ mice did not show a significant difference in viral load. cDCs were generated from WT and Mavs/ or Myd88/Trif/ mice. were stimulated with rMP-12 and NSs del at an MOI of 1 for 6, 12, or 24 h. absence of TLR signaling in cDCs did not impact IFN- production at early or late time points. the virus titer was determined in supernatant collected from infected cDCs (C and D) or macrophages (E and F) by plaque assay. the mean levels of IFN- the standard deviation from three experiments are shown. a multiplex gene expression analysis platform (Nanostring nCounter) examined the role of MAVS in transcriptional regulation of a panel of type I IFN-inducible genes in RVFV-infected cells. MAVS is a central regulator of the transcriptional response to RVFV. the data are shown as the log10 fold change in infected cells compared to uninfected cells. mice infected with 3.5 104 PFU of virus intranasally experienced higher mortality compared to mice infected subcutaneously with the same dose of rMP-12. survival following RVFV infection is dependent on the route of infection and MAVS. mice sacrificed on day 8 had a pale ischemic liver and necrotic bowel compared to uninfected control mice. mice requiring humane sacrifice deteriorated quickly, transitioning from apparently healthy to moribund within a matter of hours. no neurological symptoms in infected mice were observed during the course of infection. the mean liver titer during the middle period of infection was 8.5 105 PFU/g. in correlation with elevated viral loads in the liver, Mavs/ mice showed undetectable levels of virus in the lungs. despite a deficiency in type I IFN and ISG production, Mavs/ mice showed a robust inflammatory response throughout infection. the levels of IL-3 and IL-12p40 were below the limit of detection in serum samples from both mouse groups on day 8. of the 32 cytokines and chemokines tested, CXCL5 (LIX) was the only protein measured that was higher in WT mice and decreased in Mavs/ mice. the average cytokine levels were measured in serum samples from infected animals in Mavs/mice compared to wild-type mice on day 8. the average cytokine levels were measured in serum samples from infected animals in Mavs/mice compared to wild-type mice. IFN- responses of cDCs generated from WT, Rig-I/ and Mda5/ mice were measured after infection with rMP-12 or NSs del for 6, 12, or 24 h. cDCs from Mda5/ mice also showed significantly reduced levels of IFN- at 6 and 12 h compared to cDCs from WT mice. HEK293XL cells were stimulated with rMP-12 and NSs del strains. rMP-12 expresses the virulence factor NSs which inhibits IFN- transcription. inhibition of RIG-I resulted in a dose dependent reduction in IFN- activation after stimulation with NSs del. cells were stimulated with control ligands Sendai virus (SV) and 400 ng of transfected poly(IC) for 18 h with or without the addition of RIG-I dominant-negative construct. the cells were transfected with TLR7 (C) or TLR8 (D) and transfected with myD88 dominant-negative construct (MyD88 Dn) at 0, 10, 50, or 100 ng. RVFV-induced activation of IFN- is independent of endosomal TLRs. hek293XL cells overexpressing TLR7 or TLR8 were transfected with the IFN- luciferase reporter. rMP-12 did not induce IFN- promoter activation. bone marrow cells from mice lacking specific innate immune receptors were differentiated into macrophages, cDCs, or FLT3L-derived mixed pDCs/cDCs. the absence of MAVS signaling also reduced IFN- levels to below the level of detection when mixed pDCs/cDCs were stimulated with NSs del at an MOI of 1. the role of MyD88 was assessed in cDCs and macrophages. absence of MyD88 did not impact robust type I IFN production in cDCs or in macrophages. RVFV-induced type I IFN production is primarily dependent on RNA helicase adaptor MAVS in immune cells. the absence of MAVS results in increased viral load in cDCs. cDCs from Mavs/ mice showed a significantly increased viral burden. mice were infected with rMP-12 (A, C, and E) and NSs del (B, D, and F) at various MOIs. total viral load was determined by plaque assay after 24 h of infection in cDCs (A and B) and macrophages (C, D, E, and F) supernatants were collected after 6, 12, or 24 h of infection. virus titer was determined in supernatant collected from infected cDCs. no detectable difference between cDCs and macrophages. BMDMs and cDCs from mice infected with rMP-12 showed upregulated expression of a panel of 42 genes. they included Ifnb, Ifna4, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). gene expression profiles in cDCs were compared after infection with rMP-12 or NSs del virus. mice were challenged either intranasally or subcutaneously to mimic these natural routes of exposure. mice infected with 3.5 103 PFU of virus experienced higher mortality compared to mice infected subcutaneously with the same dose of rMP-12. survival following RVFV infection is dependent on the route of infection and MAVS. intranasal inoculation with rMP-12 was performed using WT and Mavs/ mice. survival was monitored for 28 days. in order to determine whether MAVS had an impact on early innate immune responses and morbidity, intranasally infected mice were sacrificed every other day. serum viral loads for the positive mice were 1.3 105 PFU/ml in the middle period and 1.2 103 PFU/ml in the late period. the viral burden was determined by plaque assay in serum (A), liver (B), and lung (C) in Mavs/ mice () compared to WT mice () during intranasal infection. in mice humanely sacrificed on day 5, cytokines with the overall highest induction in Mavs/ mice included IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, and MIG. other cytokines that had a notable (>4-fold) induction in Mavs/ compared to wild-type on day 8 of infection included GM-CSF, IFN-, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-12p70, IL-17, MIP cytokine responses at peak of rMP-12 RVFV infection Cytokine or chemokine Avg level (pg/ml) SDa: WT mice Mavs/ mice MIP-1 4 8 264 229 66.0 IL-2 3 6 164 260 54.7 MIP-1 39 62 1,369 1,673 35.1 MCP-1 25 34 687 539* 27.5 IL-17 3 6 63 90 21.0 GM-CSF 21 36 3 the average cytokine levels were measured in serum samples from infected animals in Mavs/mice compared to wild-type mice on day 8. the average cytokine levels were measured in serum samples from infected animals in Mavs/mice compared to wild-type mice. cDCs from wild-type or mice deficient in RIG-I (A) or MDA5 (B) were infected with rMP-12 or NSs del at an MOI of 1 for 6, 12, or 24 h. all results are means the standard deviation (n = 3) LR8 that have potential for the recognition of single-stranded viral genomic RNA did not have enhanced IFN- signaling compared to basal HEK293 cells. the addition of a dominant-negative construct targeting MyD88 did not impact IFN- promoter activation. initial studies performed in HEK293 cells to determine key PRRs were confirmed using primary immune cells from WT and genetically deficient mice. cDCs produce higher levels of type I IFN compared to macrophages. in contrast, lack of MAVS signaling or myD88-dependent TLR signaling did not alter viral replication in macrophages. this was an unexpected finding, since MAVS was shown to be necessary for type I IFN production in primary immune cells. we used two strains of attenuated RVFV for in vitro studies. the NSs del strain offers insight into which receptors can be activated by the virus. some type I IFN was generated in response to the rMP-12 strain. high mortality in Mavs/ mice after intranasal challenge with rMP-12 was expected because of the deficit seen in the production of immune cells from these mice in vitro. we have observed that the route of infection largely impacts virulence, with significantly less virulence observed with subcutaneous challenge than with intranasal challenge. this may be due to a difference in which cells and organs first come into contact with the virus based on the route of virus introduction, leading to different profiles the cytokines IL-10 and MCP-1 were shown to be significantly different between WT and MAVS-deficient mice. IL-10 can inhibit antigen presentation and the production of inflammatory cytokines. despite recognizing distinct substrates, both RIG-I and MDA5 have also been shown to contribute to recognition of west Nile virus and dengue virus (67, 68). this also demonstrated a redundant role for these molecules in the induction of type I IFN responses by RVFV."}
