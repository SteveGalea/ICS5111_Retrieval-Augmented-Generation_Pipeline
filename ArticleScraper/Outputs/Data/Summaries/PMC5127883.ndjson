{"summary": "plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are important sensors of non-self-nucleic acids derived from bacteria or viruses. they are crucial mediators of innate anti-microbial responses through the production of inflammatory cytokines and type-I IFNs. pDCs have been implicated in several autoimmune diseases, including lupus, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis. pro-pathogenic Ag-presenting pDCs were described in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. BST-2 mediated specific Ag delivery to CpG-activated pDCs led to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and Th1 cell differentiation and triggered protective immunity against viral infection and tumor growth. IDO enzymatic functions in tumor dLN-sorted pDCs have been correlated to in vitro Treg differentiation and suppressive functions. it is so far unknown whether IDO expression in nave pDCs pre-exists. mice had a pure C57BL/6 background and were bred and maintained at Geneva medical school animal facility. all procedures were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the animal research committee of Geneva or of the NIH. active EAE was induced by immunizing mice, subcutaneously in both flanks, with 100 g of MOG35\u201355 peptide emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. at the time of immunization and 48 h later, mice also received 300 ng of pertussis toxin (Sigma-Aldrich) into the tail vein. EAE was induced by active immunization the day after Treg transfer. in some experiments, CD45.1 mice were used as recipients. pDCs loaded with 10 g/mL of MOG35\u201355 were injected into tail vein. in vitro BM derived DC generation pDCs were generated from BM of WT, pIII + IV/ and IDO/ mice. BM cells were recovered from tibia and femurs of mice and cultured, after red cell lysis, for 7 days in complete RPMI medium. cDCs were recovered from scratched total skin LNs of 2D2 mice. pDCs were loaded or not with MOG35\u201355 peptide (10 g/mL) 300 000 pDCs were seeded in 48 well plates with 200 000 2D2 CD4+ T cells. cell purity was assessed by flow cytometry using a CyanTM ADP. dLNs and 17 000 cells were incubated with 50 000 proliferation dye-labeled 2D2 CD4+ T cells (Treg:2D2, ratio 1:3) and 50 000 LPS activated, MOG35\u201355 loaded, BM derived cDCs for 5 days. percentage of Treg-mediated suppression was related to 0% of proliferation. cell proliferation was assessed using the Fixable Viability Dye eFluor\u00ae 780 (eBioscience) for flow cytometry analysis, single cell suspensions were incubated with FcBlock (anti-CD16/32 FcRII-RIII) for 10 min, at 4 \u00b0C and stained with antibodies. PCR were performed with CFX Connect Real-time System (Bio rad) and iQ SYBR green Super-mix (Bio-Rad Labolatories) mRNA was used for normalization. BM cells were recovered from tibia and femurs of donor mice. 5 to 7 106 cells were injected intravenously into sub-lethally irradiated recipient mice. mice were monitored daily for disease clinical symptoms. passive EAE induction, encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells were generated in vitro from LN and spleen cells of 2D2 mice. Mice received 67 ng of pertussis toxin at the day of cell injection and 48 h later. dLNs were scratched and LN cells were subjected to CD4+ T cell enrichment. pDCs, cDCs, B cells and macrophages were recovered from LN. BM cells were recovered from tibia and femurs of mice. cDCs were generated as pDCs from BM of WT mice. pDCs were activated for 24 h with 5 ng/ml LPS. co-cultures CD4+ T cells were recovered from scratched total skin LNs of 2D2 mice. 500 000 pDCs were seeded in 24 well plates with 300 000 2D2 CD4+ T cells or 300 000 pDCs were seeded in 48 well plates with 100 000 2D2 CD4+ T cells. cells were co-cultured in complete RPMI medium for 16 h and pDCs were isolated again using the Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell isolation kit II. cell proliferation was assessed using the Fixable Viability Dye eFluor\u00ae 780 (eBioscience) cell proliferation was assessed using the Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilisation buffer set (eBioscience) cDCs were defined as CD11chiPDCA-1- and pDCs as CD11cintPDCA-1+ or CD11cintSiglec-H+. cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) mRNA was used for normalization. all statistical analyses were done using Prism 5.0 software. IDO expression by pDCs in steady-state LN is dependent on MHCII restricted Ag-specific interactions with Treg. IDO expression was significantly reduced and was comparable to what was seen in Rag2/ mice. OT-II transgenic CD4+ T cells were insufficient at inducing IDO in pDCs. pDCs expressing a monoclonal population of CD4+ T cells. vivo pDCs sorted from skin LN of 3wk-old WT, pIII + IV/ and Scurfy mice. IDO mRNA levels of ex vivo WT pDCs and WT BM derived pDCs loaded or not with MOG35\u201355. results are representative of at least 2 independent experiments. IDO expression was reduced in LN pDCs isolated from all TCR transgenic Rag/ mice compared to WT mice. pDCs exhibit significant restoration of IDO expression when co-cultured with 2D2 TCR tg CD4+ T cells. pDCs exhibit significant restoration of IDO expression compared to WT pDCs. 2D2 TCR tg CD4+CD25neg cells were incompetent at inducing IDO. 2D2 TCR tg CD4+CD25hi cells significantly enhanced IDO mRNA levels in pDCs loaded with MOG35\u201355 peptide. pDCs co-cultured with total 2D2 TCR tg CD4+ CD25hi cells exhibit a slight, but not significant increase in IDO mRNA levels absence of pIV leads to MHCII abrogation on cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) to restore CD4+ T cell thymic positive selection by MHCII competent cTECs. pIII + IV/ mice exhibiting genetic deficiencies compared to WT WT controls. we observed a similar reduction of IDO mRNA in pDCs isolated from H2-Db/ mice. pDCs is dependent on MHCII-tCR interactions. pDCs are the major expressors of IDO in steady-state LNs. IDO was expressed by pDCs compared to other LN cells. pDCs and cDCs were sorted from draining LNs of WT and pIII + IV/ WT mice 10 days after EAE induction. IDO expression was significantly impaired in MHCII deficient compared to pDCs isolated from LN of EAE mice. decreased IDO expression in absence of MHCII expression by pDCs was not related to different cytokine expression profiles between WT WT and pIII + IV/ WT chimeras. EAE induction based on CD45.2, CD11c, PDCA1 and GFP markers. results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post Hoc test was used. pDC-instructed Tregs inhibit the priming of encephalitogenic T cells during EAE. pDCs exhibit impaired IDO expression both in steady-state and during EAE. disease was exacerbated in mice lacking MHCII on pDCs. IFN- and IL-17 producing encephalitogenic CD4+ T cell frequencies were observed in LNs of IDO deficient mice (IDO/ WT) and mice lacking MHCII expression by pDCs (pIII + IV/ WT) pDCs showed that MHCII-mediated Ag presentation, but not IDO expression by pDCs, promoted Foxp3+ Treg proliferation. IDO deficiency in MOG35\u201355-presenting pDCs leads to EAE exacerbation. results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments with 8 mice per group. results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments with 8 mice per group. MOG35\u201355 loaded BM-derived pDCs from WT and IDO/ pDCs were transferred into BDCA-2 DTR WT chimeras one day prior to EAE induction. only WT, but not IDO/ pDCs significantly inhibited disease development. Frequencies of (B) CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+ Treg cells are represented at d10 after EAE immunization (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) results are representative of at least 2 independent experiments with 6\u20138 mice per group. Tregs primed in IDO deficient mice were significantly less efficient at suppressing MOG35\u201355 loaded DC induced 2D2 CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro. however, neither Tregs isolated from nave WT, nor Tregs isolated from nave or immunized IDO/ mice conferred any protection upon transfer into EAE mice. results are representative of at least 2 independent experiments. Error bars depict mean SEM. one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post Hoc test was used. pIII + IV/ WT (pIII + IV/ Tregs) and IDO/ WT (IDO/ Tregs) BM chimeras 10 days after EAE induction. mRNA was expressed to far greater levels (>5 fold) by pDCs (CD11cintPDCA-1+), than by cDCs (CD11chiPDCA-1+), and macrophages (CD11cCD19+) IDO expression by pDCs was shown to be induced by T-cell produced cytokines. pDCs from steady-state LNs of Rag2/ showed a significant reduction of IDO mRNA, which was in fine comparable to levels obtained in IDO/ pDCs. IDO mRNA levels in ex-vivo pDCs sorted from skin LN of 3wk-old WT, pIII + IV/ and Scurfy mice. IDO mRNA levels of ex vivo WT pDCs and WT BM derived pDCs loaded or not with MOG35\u201355. results are representative of at least 2 independent experiments. two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used to test the possibility that distinct TCR self-reactivity would exhibit differential ability to induce IDO expression in pDCs. we isolated pDCs from different CD4+ TCR transgenic Rag1/ mice that express distinct levels of CD5. p3+ Tregs showed significant reduction of IDO mRNA expression compared to WT pDCs. pDCs co-cultured with 2D2 TCR tg CD4+ T cells. pDCs loaded with MOG35\u201355 peptide significantly enhanced IDO mRNA levels in pDCs. total 2D2 TCR tg CD4+ CD25hi cells exhibit a slight, but not significant increase in IDO mRNA levels compared to pDCs co-cultured with 2D2 TCR tg CD4+CD25hi cells. this suggests that although Tregs are required to promote IDO, non-Treg CD4+ T cells might also contribute to this process. we used genetically deficient mice that selectively lack MHCII expression by BM cells from Ubi-eGFP WT and pIII + IV/ mice were co-injected into irradiated recipient mice expressing the congenic marker CD45.1. cDCs expressed little IDO mRNA compared to MHCII competent pDCs in mixed BM chimeric mice. pDCs and pDCs were sorted from total skin LN of nave mice. results are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post Hoc test was used. differential IDO expression by MHCII competent and MHCII deficient pDCs might be explained by distinct inflammatory cytokinic environments in WT and pIII + IV/ WT mice. we performed mixed BM chimeric mice using as before BM cells from Ubi-eGFP WT and pIII + IV/ mice. cDCs, pDCs and macrophages sorted from dLNs 10 days after immunization. mixed BM chimeric mice were generated by co-transferring (1:1) CD45.2 GFP+ WT and CD45.2 pIII + IV/ BM cells in lethally irradiated CD45.1. pDCs did not express MHCII in untreated mice. disease was exacerbated in DEREG WT treated with DT and DEREGxpIII + IV/ WT chimeras injected or not with DT. mice deficient for IDO (IDO/ WT) developed aggravated EAE compared to controls. clinical scores of IDO/ WT were comparable to mice lacking MHCII on pDCs. the frequency of IL-10 expressing Foxp3+ Tregs was significantly decreased in LNs from both pIII + IV/ WT and IDO/ WT compared to WT mice. results identify a new role for IDO in impacting ability of Tregs to suppress encephalitogenic T cells. we used BDCA-2 DTR mice in which endogenous pDCs were depleted following DT injection [54]. it has been demonstrated that active immunization induces DT toxicity. it may therefore confound experiments in DTR transgenic mice for neuroinflammatory models. CD69 was significantly reduced in LN from BDCA-2 DTR WT EAE mice transferred with IDO/ pDCs compared to WT pDCs. results demonstrate that during EAE, IDO expression by pDCs is required to elicit pDC-mediated suppressive Tregs. purified CD4+CD25+ cells were transferred into WT hosts one day prior to EAE induction. Tregs primed in mice lacking MHCII expression by pDCs did not exhibit any suppressive activity. Tregs primed by IDO+pDCs are suppressive in vivo and control EAE development. CD4+CD25hi cells were purified from dLNs of WT WT, pIII + IV/ WT and IDO/ WT BM chimeras 10 days after EAE induction. results are representative of at least 2 independent experiments. cytometry histograms represent the percentages of Treg-mediated suppression (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). results are representative of 2 independent experiments. Error bars represent mean SEM. one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post Hoc test was used. pDCs exhibit tolerogenic or immunogenic APC functions in different immunogical contexts. pDCs are the major expressors of IDO in LNs. pDCs are the major expressors of IDO in LNs. a role for IL-10 producing Tregs has been demonstrated in IDO expression stabilization. it is possible that a particular Treg subpopulation would be specifically involved in this crosstalk with pDCs to induce IDO up-regulation. mice lacking MHCII on pDCs developed exacerbated disease. neither IFN-, nor TGF-, was sufficient to induce IDO in absence of MHCII expression by pDCs. pDCs tolerogenicity in EAE context is dependent on their expression. Ag-presenting IDO+ pDCs promote suppressive Tregs that inhibit the priming of encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells and dampen CNS autoimmunity."}
