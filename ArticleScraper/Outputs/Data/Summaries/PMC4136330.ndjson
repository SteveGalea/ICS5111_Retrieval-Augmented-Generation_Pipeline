{"summary": "central nervous system (CNS) immune responses are tightly controlled. antibodies, complement, proinflammatory cytokines, leukocytes, and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression are generally absent. the apparent immunosuppressive nature of the CNS is maintained by a sophisticated series of mechanisms that prevent the unwanted access of plasma components and bone marrow-derived leukocytes. the function and hierarchical relevance of these chemokines in attracting relevant antiviral leukocyte subsets has yet to be fully elucidated. the final outcome of encephalitis will depend on the infecting pathogen, such as viruses, and a range of host factors, including age and immune status. a putative role for CCR5 in host defense has been suggested in the context of effective immune responses to WNV. mouse models of viral encephalitis define the form and magnitude of the chemotactic cues expressed by the virus-infected brain and the kinetics of entry of distinct leukocyte populations. this comprehensive analysis identifies the CXCR3 axis as being the key instigator of CNS inflammation in response to alphavirus infection. SFV strain A7(74) or 2 105 PFU of SFV strain L10 suspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.75% bovine serum albumin (PBSA) or PBSA only (mock infected) mice were sampled on postinfection days (PID) 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. samples were tested in triplicate using cDNA (1 g total RNA transcribed), 2 PerfeCTa SYBR green fast mix (Quanta Bioscience), 500 M forward and reverse primer mix, and RNase-free water according to the manufacturer's protocol. the samples were run on a 7900HT real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) for 40 cycles. data are expressed as relative fold changes in healthy control mouse brains. correlation between copy number of SFV nsp3 transcripts as detected by QPCR and PFU. each sample was tested in triplicate with 4 to 7 mice per time point. rinsing buffer containing HBSS, 0.5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 mM EDTA. brain cells were washed twice with rinsing buffer and resuspended in Percoll and HBSS to obtain a 30% Percoll solution. the 30% solution was then layered over 70% Percoll and spun down at 2,000 g for 20 min at room temperature. dye-APC-Cy7 (eBioscience) for fixed cells was used for live/dead cell exclusion. analysis was performed using FlowJo version 8.8.7 (Tree Star Inc., USA) a total of 1 106 to 5 106 events were captured for each analysis. the rabbit anti-mouse CD3 antibody was visualized for 30 min at room temperature. the secondary antibody was then visualized by incubating sections with fluorescein or Texas Red avidin D. selective for CCR5 and does not inhibit ligand binding to CCR1 or CXCR4. the treatment of mice with all the blockers started on PID 3. mice were mock treated with vehicle control. with 5 103 PFU of SFV strain A7(74) or 2 105 PFU of SFV strain L10 suspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.75% bovine serum albumin (PBSA) or PBSA only (mock infected) the virus was provided by the Pirbright Institute, Pirbright, United Kingdom. real-time PCR was performed as described previously (24, 25) samples were tested in triplicate using cDNA (1 g total RNA transcribed), 2 PerfeCTa SYBR green fast mix, 500 M forward and reverse primer mix, and RNase-free water according to the manufacturer's protocol. samples were run on a 7900HT real-time PCR machine for 40 cycles. inflammatory CC (i) and CXC chemokine (ii) expression in the brains of mice displaying or not displaying symptoms postinfection with the virulent L10 strain of SFV. each sample was tested in triplicate with 4 to 7 mice per time point. brain cells were washed twice with rinsing buffer containing HBSS, 0.5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 mM EDTA (Sigma) the subsequent homogenate was passed through a 70-m cell strainer. the 30% solution was then layered over 70% Percoll and spun down at 2,000 g for 20 min at room temperature. analysis was performed using FlowJo version 8.8.7 (Tree Star Inc., USA) half mouse brains were removed from the skull and immediately fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution (Santa Cruz) for 24 h at 4\u00b0C. rat IgG or IgM antibodies (Southern Biotech) for 30 min at room temperature. the secondary antibody was visualized by incubating sections with fluorescein or Texas Red avidin D. chemokine antagonists to CCR2, CCR5 and CXCR3 were administered to mice. this antagonist has been shown to be selective for CCR5. it displays an IC50 of 55 pM (35) and a compartment half-life of 6 to 7 h (36). the treatment of mice started on PID 3 and was administered until mice became ill. SFV infection of the brain led to a rapid induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transcripts and of interferon (IFN)-inducible genes from PID 3 onwards. a cumulative increase in the panleukocyte marker, CD45 transcript, was also seen, suggesting leukocyte entry into the infected brain. inflammatory chemokines were upregulated, and no enhancement of CCL11 expression was seen. by PID 7, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were the most upregulated chemokine transcripts. modest induction of CXCL16 was also noted at later time points. not all inflammatory chemokines were upregulated, suggesting specificity to the chemokine expression. the magnitude of upregulation was much higher in L10-infected brains. inflammatory chemokines are highly upregulated in the brain during infection with SFV. the response was comparable to that seen with the virulent SFV strain NY99. a previous report indicated a specific reduction in expression of the CXCL12 isoform during WNV encephalitis (37) the primer set used in our study does not discriminate between the and isoforms and therefore reports total CXCL12 expression. chemokines, cytokines, and interferon-stimulated genes were rapidly upregulated during WNV encephalitis. healthy control mouse brains contained only a small number of leukocytes (CD45hi cells) following infection, CNS-infiltrating leukocytes were significantly increased from PID 5 onwards. numbers peaked at PID 10 (Fig. 3Ai and Aii) small numbers of NK cells entered the brain first with NK cell numbers peaking at PID 10 (Fig. 3Bi) small numbers of CD11b+ cells rapidly entered the CNS following viral infection. between PID 5 and PID 7, we observed a significant shift from CD11b+Ly6C cells to CD11b+Ly6Chi monocytes/macrophages. the Ly6Chi cell fraction was further analyzed for the expression of MHC-II molecules. a shift from MHC-II-negative to MHC-II-positive cells could be observed on PID 7 and 10 (Fig. 3Dii) neutrophils, which are CD11b+ Ly6G+ Ly6C, were not detected in the brain by either flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry at any time point. SFV A7(74) infection induces the early infiltration of NK cells, followed by CD11b+ myeloid leukocytes and then B cells into the brain parenchyma. the ratio of CD4+ T cells was similar to that in control brains over time course of infection. 80% of all infiltrating CD3+ T cells were effector T cells showing a high expression of CD44 and low expression of L-selectin (CD62L) the number of effector T cells was significantly increased by PID 7 and 10. number of CD44+CD62L+ cells (E), CCR5+ cells (F) and CXCR3+ cells (G) per 104 brain cells in control and infected brain samples at indicated time points following viral inoculation. for all flow cytometric data, 5 to 10 pooled mouse brains per time point from 3 individual experiments were used. individual leukocyte subtypes were reduced by CCR5 blockade. notably, none of these reductions were statistically significant. this does not lead to alterations in viral titer. ligands CCL2 and CCL7 were also upregulated during viral encephalitis. blocking CCR2 would lead to a selective reduction of monocyte infiltration. we first sought to define the kinetics of monocyte mobilization into the blood. mice compared to untreated wild-type mice at PID 7. compared to untreated wild-type mice, mice treated with SFV blocker. the accumulation of CD45hi leukocytes was significantly reduced by up to 57% in mice treated with the CCR2 blocker. we also used CCR2/ mice, in which leukocyte infiltration was markedly reduced to a level similar to that observed in mice treated with RS504393. we also analyzed the number of CD11b+ cells in untreated and CCR2/ mice. the proportion of circulating monocytes, of both CD11b+Ly6C+CCR2+ and CD11b+Ly6C phenotypes, was not significantly reduced during the treatment with the CCR2 blocker. therefore, CCR2 plays a critical role in the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and T cells in the brain but has no significant effect on viral titer. the overall number of CD45hi CD11b+ cells in the brains of treated and untreated mice was also dramatically reduced. despite the significant reduction in leukocyte entry, the number of SFV E1 transcripts in the brain was unaffected by CXCR3 blockade. chemokine receptor blockade is therapeutically efficacious in mice treated with virulent SFV. we infected mice with the virulent strain L10 and treated mice with appropriate antagonists starting on PID 3. despite its ability to significantly reduce leukocyte entry into the CNS during infection with SFV A7(74), we found no survival benefit in L10-infected mice treated with the CXCR3 antagonist. titers are expressed as fold changes relative to expression in one of the blocker-treated brain samples. coblockade of CCR2 and CXCR3 (gray bars) is associated with reduced levels of transcripts for CXCL2, TNF, and iNOS but unaltered expression of GFAP compared to vehicle-treated mice. analysis of chemokines during encephalitis will provide important insights into the nature of leukocyte infiltration during viral encephalitis. avirulent semliki forest virus strain was injected i.p. after an initial high titer of SFV in the blood was cleared from the periphery and replicated to a high titer in the CNS. a cumulative increase in the panleukocyte marker, CD45 transcript, was also seen, suggesting leukocyte entry into the infected brain. this model of virus infection induces a consistent sequence of infection and cytokine production in the CNS. X3CL1 did not change transcript levels in the brain during SFV infection compared to healthy mice. inflammatory chemokines are highly upregulated in the brain during infection with SFV. we also defined expression following a virulent and highly pathogenic virus. all mice died by PID 6 to 7 and exhibited a high CNS viral titer. i.n. infection resulted in a more-rapid, broader-based, and higher-level induction of inflammatory cytokines than avirulent SFV A7(74), suggesting a more aggressive CNS response to the virus. copies of the viral NS1 transcript are expressed per 103 copies of the housekeeping TBP gene. data are expressed as fold changes in expression relative to healthy control mouse brains. each sample was tested in triplicate with 4 to 5 mice per time point. 45+ leukocytes into the brains of control and infected mice. cells were gated on live cells, and doublet exclusion was performed. influx of NK cells into the hypothalamus of virally infected mice. small numbers of NK cells (NK1.1+ and Nkp46+) entered the brain first with NK cell numbers peaking at PID 10 (Fig. 3Bi) small numbers of CD11b+ cells rapidly entered the CNS following viral infection. few cells could be detected in SFV A7(74)-infected murine brain samples. those cells were located in the meninges that line the cortex and the lateral sulcus. together, only few macrophages are detectable in the SFV-infected CNS. this suggests that most of the CD19+ cells were monocytes rather than macrophages. the most prominent leukocyte subtype entering the CNS between PID 7 and PID 10 was CD3+ T cells. 20% of CD45hi cells are T cells, and this percentage increased significantly by PID 7 and PID 10 to almost 60%. in healthy control brains, the ratio of CD8+ and CD4+ was equal to 1. T cells, predominantly CD8+, expressing CD44, CXCR3 and CCR5 accumulate in the brain on, or after, PID 7 and are localized throughout the brain parenchyma. the number was significantly increased at these time points postinfection (P 0.05 and P 0.01, respectively) key's posttest (F and G), and two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's posttest (D); *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; **, P 0.001. blockade with the CCR5 blocker DAPTA resulted in a modest, but not significant reduction in leukocyte recruitment into the CNS. flow cytometric data demonstrating a significant reduction in the percentage of CCR5+ leukocytes in the virally infected brains of SFV-infected mice treated with either CCR5 blocker or vehicle control. n = 4 to 6 pooled mouse brains from 2 individual experiments (Student's t test; P > 0.05) number of CD11b+ cells decreased significantly after 48 h postinfection. proportion of CD11b+ cells decreased significantly after 48 h postinfection. both results are expressed as percentages of total cells counted. circulating CCR2+ monocytes (i) and Ly6C+ cells (ii) in mice treated with the CCR2 blocker at the indicated time points. all data represent at least 2 replicate experiments and were acquired by flow cytometry. b+CCR2+ monocytes were reduced to almost zero (Fig. 6Ci, Cii, and Ciii) both CD3+ T-cell and NK cell numbers were significantly reduced after genetic or pharmacological blockade of CCR2. despite inducing a significant and robust reduction in leukocyte entry, CCR2 blockade was not associated with altered SFV brain titers. XCR3 blockade was administered to SFV-infected mice from PID 3 until PID 7. the blocker was administered to SFV-infected mice from PID 3 until PID 7. accumulation of CD45hi leukocytes was dramatically reduced (P 0.01) in the mice treated with the CXCR3 blocker. Flow cytometric (i) and quantitative (ii) analysis of the effects of CXCR3 blockade on the accumulation of leukocytes at PID 7 in the brains of SFV-infected mice. quantitative analysis of the effects of CXCR3 blockade on the recruitment, at PID 7, of CXCR3+ cells (C) and CD11b+ (Di) and NK cells (Dii) into the CNS. despite its ability to significantly reduce leukocyte entry into the CNS during infection with SFV A7(74), we found no survival benefit in L10-infected mice treated with the virulent SFV strain L10. survival curves showing no effect of CCR2 (A), CCR5 (B) or CXCR3 (C) blockade on their own on survival of mice following inoculation with strain L10 of SFV. coblockade of CCR2 and CXCR3 results in a reduction in leukocyte accumulation similar in magnitude to that seen with CXCR3 blockade alone. however, coblockade of the two receptors resulted in a profound and significant reduction in viral titers in the brains of infected mice. this was associated with reduced transcript levels of key inflammatory mediators, including CXCL2 and TNF. this was associated with reduced transcript levels of key inflammatory we have used virulent and avirulent strains of SFV and WNV as models for viral encephalitis. the chemokine expression patterns during viral encephalitis are similar regardless of the pathogen used. patitis virus has shown that many T cells and monocytes accumulate in the brain during MHV infection, in which they exert antiviral functions and reduce mortality. blocking chemokine receptors with specific antagonists leads to a reduction in the numbers of leukocytes infiltrating the brain during MHV infection. a temporary blockade of CCR2 did not result in a decrease in circulating monocytes but did block their CNS entry. this suggests that leukocytes do use this chemokine axis to enter the virus-infected CNS and that this is not an indirect consequence of monocytopenia. influx through the use of chemokine receptor antagonists does not affect virus titers and instead promotes survival to an otherwise overwhelming encephalitis. this finding is in contrast to studies using WNV as a model of infection (19) levels of leukocyte-induced damage may limit viral entry into the brains. this is at odds with previous reports implicating CXCR3 in the recruitment of antiviral T cells to the encephalitic brain."}
