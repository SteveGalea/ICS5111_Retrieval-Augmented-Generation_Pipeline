{"summary": "epitope mapping from affinity-selected peptides has been proven to be a useful approach in identifying native epitopes for immunological applications in recent years [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Graph search methods are among the most efficient ways in epitope mapping demonstrated in many recent publications. pepSurf and mapitope combined as a web tool for epitope-peptide mapping. each peptide is first deconvoluted to amino acid pairs. peptides are then clustered into a patch, from which the epitope location is inferred. if no single experimentally derived peptide is related to any region on the antigen, it only indicates that this method is not applicable for the case through the mapping. if more mapping methods can be combined for exploring as many associated peptides as possible through the mapping, the likelihood of finding a genuine epitopic region on the antigen should be enhanced. PepMapper identifies all the surface residues and creates a surface graph using those residues. each matched path is then rated by its P-value score. the process of Pep-3D-Search has two unique features. a patch-based complete graph search algorithm is used to find the best alignment for each mimotope sequence in each graph. the patch with the highest score is selected as a potential candidate for the native epitope. a compactness factor is introduced to make sure all resultant graphs share a uniform compactness. PepMapper executes both MimoPro and Pep-3D-Search concurrently without mutual interference. the user can access the normal result of either MimoPro or Pep-3D-Search as each works alone. intersection creates a new set that consists of only the common epitopic amino acids in both A and B. Ideally if both methods produce exactly the same epitopic amino acids, both intersection and Union should return the same set. pepMapper is currently deployed on Linux using tomcat server 6.0. users can choose three options, MimoPro, Pep-3D-Search, and their combination. the original Web tool of PepMapper was implemented using VB.NET. text/table format is used to list all potential amino acids. results can also be presented in Rasmol script that can be downloaded by clicking link provided. the performance of MimoPro [16] seems to be above the average level. a patch-based complete graph search algorithm is used to find the best alignment for each mimotope sequence in each graph. PepMapper provides users with a united platform to conduct peptide-epitope mapping through either MimoPro or Pep-3D-Search or both for different purposes. the user can access the normal result of either MimoPro or Pep-3D-Search as each works alone. the candidate epitopes of 3IU3 are shown in the shape of spacefill and cpk color format. the bottom one is the result from Union of PepMapper. the combined operations of Union and Intersection are defined as (1) (2) where A and B are two sets of epitopic amino acids predicted by MimoPro and Pep-3D-Search respectively. consistency of epitope prediction from the two methods falls between 0 and 1. it is an indirect indication that a genuine epitope is more likely to be found around the overlapped area on the antigen surface under study. the user needs to specify at least one peptide in the box labeled as Mimotopes. the peptides should be grouped in the FASTA format or just in separated lines of sequences. the result from PepMapper is a candidate epitope along with the alignment for each peptide sequence. test cases with antigen smaller than 80 amino acids are excluded because they are too small to reflect the performance. the final dataset was constructed by 27 test cases. n SH3 domain Nef Bovine 811, 1012 1HX1 Hsc70 Bag chaperone regulator 815 1SQ0 Platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha chain von Willebrand factor (vWF) 311 1MQ8 ICAM-1 Integrin alpha-L beta-2 114 1II4 FGFR-2 HBGF-2 307 1WLP NCF-1 Cytochrome b-245 309, 38 2GRX Ferrichrome-iron receptor Protein FN is the number of predicted non-epitopic amino acids proven to be the true epitopic amino acids. we use PE to denote the number of predicted non-epitopic amino acids. results from MimoPro and Pep-3D-Search were run separately.

PepMapper is a collaborative web platform on which users can conveniently conduct peptide-epitope mappings. the intersection operation of PepMapper realizes the concept of mutual verification by the two methods and thus increases the likelihood of locating the genuine epitopic region on a given antigen. the final dataset was constructed by 27 test cases. the task of epitope prediction based on the peptide set is to map it back to the epitopic region on an antigen that interacts with the target molecule. leukin-2 receptor subunit alpha anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody basiliximab 69 2NY7 Anti-gp120 monoclonalantibody b12 Surface protein gp120 (SU) 112 115 1AVZ Fyn SH3 domain Nef Bovine 811, 1012 1HX1 Hsc70 Bag chaperone regulator 815 1SQ0 Platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha chain von Willebrand factor (vWF) 311 expressions, TP is the number of predicted epitopic amino acids proven not to be the true epitopic amino acids.
