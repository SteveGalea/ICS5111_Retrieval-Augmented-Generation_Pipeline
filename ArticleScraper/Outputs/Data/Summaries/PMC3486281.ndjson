{"summary": "the virus is transmitted almost exclusively by the parenteral route. acute infections progress to chronicity in about 70% of cases. prevalence of the virus among young adults has not declined. a major hurdle in the development of an effective HCV vaccine is the lack of an immunization strategy to elicit broadly protective antibodies. neutralizing immunity and functional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses induced early in HCV infection correlate with clearance or viral control in patients (7, 37, 51). MV-CE1E2 and MV-E1/Ft-E2-Ft elicited neutralizing antibodies against homologous envelope proteins. MV-CE1E2 vector also induced cross-neutralizing immune responses to heterologous virus envelopes. infected cells and supernatants were collected and lysed by one cycle of freeze and thaw at different times postinfection. the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was determined on Vero/hSLAM cells using the Spearman-K\u00e4rber method (34). the MV genome in this plasmid has complete coding identity with the Moraten/Schwartz vaccine strain genomes and contains an additional transcription unit (ATU, a duplicated N/P inter glu is amino acid 717 of the HCV polyprotein (335 of the E2 protein ectodomain) and Gly is the first amino acid of the transmembrane region of the MV F protein (56). recombinant MVs were then generated and named MV-CE1E2 and MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft, respectively. signals were detected with the SuperSignal West Femto maximum detection system (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for analysis of E1 and E2 protein conformation, vero/hSLAM cells were seeded and infected as described above. twenty hours after infection, the cells were starved for 15 min and labeled with 100 Ci/ml of Express protein labeling Mix 35S label. protein material was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-H- or anti-E1-specific antibodies. infected Vero/hSLAM cells were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml of Sulfo-NHS-LC biotin. cells were lysed with RSB\u2013NP-40 buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. purification of soluble homologous ectodomain was performed as previously described (71). HEK293T cells were transfected with an E2 expression plasmid under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (pcDNA3.1) the construct included an amino-terminal prolactin signal sequence and a carboxyl-terminal Fc tag for affinity purification. ers were determined in a plaque reduction assay by incubating heat-inactivated serum dilutions with 100 PFU of a green fluorescence protein-expressing virus. Titers were expressed as 90% plaque reduction fluorescence-forming units at 72 h postinfection. encoding an HIV provirus expressing secretable Gaussia luciferase (pNL4-3-.Gluc.R-E-) was generated by electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA from full-length genomes (H77, Bi-Gluc-H77C/JFH; J6, Bi-Gluc-J6/JFH; and Con1, Bi-Gluc-Con1/Jc1) into Huh-7.5 cells. gaussia luciferase secreted within the supernatants was quantified using the Gaussia luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) luciferase readings for preimmune and post-protein boost status were considered positive (with HCV neutralization potential) pB(+)MVvac2-HCV(E1/Ft-E2/Ft)P was obtained from pBRTM/HCV1-809con (36) as an MluI-AatII restriction fragment. for E1/Ft, the junction was Glu/Gly, where Glu is amino acid 717 of the HCV polyprotein (335 of the E2 protein ectodomain) and Gly is the first amino acid of the transmembrane region of lysates were subjected to 4 to 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. immunoblotting was performed using anti-C (MA1-080; Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) and anti-E1 (catalog no. 1879) and anti-E2 (catalog no. 1876) the antigenic material was immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) using 10 l of each of the following monoclonal antibodies. anti-measles virus H clone 55 (27) and conformation-dependent anti-E2 antibodies H35, H53, and H60 (16) were also used. supernatants of 7 106 infected Vero/hSLAM cells were clarified by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 30 min in an SLA600TC rotor. viral particles were then concentrated at the interphase of 20 and 60% sucrose layers in TNE buffer. expression and purification of soluble homologous E2 ectodomain was performed as previously described (71). MV-susceptible Ifnarko-CD46Ge mice (49) were used as hosts. five to eight mice per group were inoculated twice by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. serum was separated and stored at 20\u00b0C until use. 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2% skim milk, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. antibody diluent (PBS with 5% BSA, 2% sheep serum, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min at RT. reaction developed with addition of goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody. ants were harvested, pooled, and filtered in DMEM containing 2% FBS, 0.1 mM NEAA, 20 mM HEPES, and 4 g/ml Polybrene. antibody-serum mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, transferred to Huh-7.5 cells seeded in 96-well plates. luciferase readings for preimmune and post-protein boost status were averaged for each HCV set. both CD81 and E2 were compared against the untreated control (HCVcc virus alone) MV proteins are indicated by dark gray arrows, HCV proteins by inserts of light gray arrows. the names of the recombinant MVs are indicated above the genome diagram. the 60- to 70-kDa band may correspond to E2 and the two smaller bands to glycosylated isoforms of E1. a protein of approximately 72 kDa was the most prominent signal in lysates of MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft-infected cells. the asterisk beside E1 indicates an endoglycosidase H-resistant form. cells were infected with MVvac2, MV-CE1E2 or MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft at an MOI of 0.1. cells were labeled with biotin and lysed. to characterize intracellular transport of the vector-expressed proteins, we analyzed the susceptibility of E1 and MV H proteins to digestion with endoglycosidase H (endo-H) this enzyme cleaves only high-mannose oligosaccharides; endo-H insensitivity would indicate that Golgi enzymes have modified the glycoprotein. as expected, MV H protein was partially resistant to endo-H, indicating transport to the medial Gol hybrid proteins express the MV F transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. they have the potential to be incorporated into chimeric MV virions. hybrid proteins are not incorporated into virions. groups of 7 mice were inoculated twice, at time zero and 4 weeks after the first infection, by the intraperitoneal route with MVvac2, MV-CE1E2 or MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft. MV-neutralizing titers, E2-specific reactivity, and neutralization against HCV pseudotyped particles expressing a homologous luciferase. sera were obtained 4 weeks after the initial infection (4w) or 2 weeks after repeat infection (6w) all sera were assayed for MV neutralization (A; reciprocals of the titer), for reactivity against HCV E2 by ELISA (B; optical density at 450 nm), or for HCV neutralization using an H77-pseudotyped luciferase-expressing retrovirus (C; percent neutralization) the protein boost increased reactivity for all three experimental groups. four weeks after inoculation of vectored MV, HCV neutralization was about 20% or 10% in MV-CE1E2- or MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft-inoculated mice. however, two MV-CE1E2- and four MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft-inoculated mice failed to develop HCV-neutralizing antibodies. reactivity against HCV by ELISA (B; optical density at 450 nm), or neutralization using an H77-pseudotyped luciferase-expressing retrovirus (C; percentage of neutralization normalized by MVvac2 readings) reactivity against HCV E2 by ELISA (C; percentage of neutralization normalized by MVvac2 readings) sera from mice primed with MV-CE1E2 showed significantly higher homologous neutralization than sera from mice primed with MV-CE1E2. sera from mice primed with MV-CE1E2 showed significantly higher homologous neutralization than sera from mice primed with MV-CE1E2. MV-CE1E2 vector expresses both HCV glycoprotein ectodomains fused to the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail of the MV F protein. cytoplasmic tail of the MV F protein has been previously shown to enhance the incorporation of foreign glycoproteins into MV particles. titers indicate time course of cell-associated (top) and cell-free virus production in vero/hSLAM cells infected with MVvac2 (circles), MV-CE1E2 (squares), or MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft (triangles). titers were measured at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h postinfection. no HCV proteins were detected in lysates of MVvac2-infected cells. extracts from mock-, MVvac2-, MV-CE1E2-, or MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft-infected cells were analyzed. a weak signal around 72 kDa was observed in the extracts of MV-CE1E2 infected cells. a weak signal around 72 kDa was observed in the extracts of MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft-infected cells. peptidyl-N glycosidase-F (PNGase-F) cleaves all N-linked carbohydrates (i.e., high mannose, hybrid, and bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary), or left the proteins undigested. MV H protein was partially resistant to endo-H, indicating transport to the medial Golgi or a subsequent compartment. the hybrid proteins express the MV F transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail and are expressed at the cell surface. they have the potential to be incorporated into chimeric MV virions. we inoculated each virus into MV-susceptible Ifnarko-CD46Ge mice. the MV average neutralization titers were in the range of 1:300 to 1:500 4 weeks after the first inoculation and between 1:800 and 1:1,500 2 weeks later. the average optical densities at 450 nm were about 1.6 and 1.0 6 weeks after infection with MV-CE1E2 and MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft. in panel B, average readings for background and monoclonal antibody anti-E2 (+) are shown with gray and black bars, respectively. one and three animals in the MV-CE1E2 and MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft groups had background level values. a prime-boost strategy was tested to enhance the neutralizing antibody response elicited by MV vectors. two MV-CE1E2- and four MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft-inoculated mice failed to develop HCV-neutralizing antibodies. four weeks after protein boost, 90% or 70% of neutralization was observed in highly diluted (up to 1:12,800) post-protein boost samples from animals primed with vectored MV still showed 45 to 50% neutralization. antibody targeting the genotype 1a glycoprotein (anti-E2) neutralized about 61% of the infectivity of the homologous genotype H77, 30% of Con1 (genotype 1b) and 16% of J6 (genotype 2a) two out of five animals showed neutralization of at least 30% of the infectivity of 1a and 2a genotypes. sera from mice primed with MV-CE1E2 showed significantly higher homologous neutralization than sera from mice primed with MV-CE1E2. MV-CE1E2 and MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft replicated in cultured cells. MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft expresses both glycoprotein ectodomains fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the MV F protein. this modification was expected to have two effects: counteract retention of the HCV glycoproteins in the ER (16) and enhance their incorporation in MV particles (60). neutralizing antibodies over long-term infection (68); association of virus particles with very-low-density lipoproteins that mediate their uptake through low-density lipoproteins. a recombinant form of the E1E2 (genotype 1a) heterodimer can induce protective immunity against homologous challenge in a chimpanzee model (15) despite control of acute-phase viremia after homologous challenge, three animals developed chronic, persistent infection. no neutralizing activity was detected against an HCV pseudotype recreating the envelope of the virus used for challenge. however, soluble E1 expressed alone from an MV vector failed to prime a cross-neutralizing response. MV-CE1E2 is a better vaccine candidate than MV-E1/Ft-E2/Ft. the two vectors showed equivalent potentials for eliciting neutralizing antibodies against homologous pseudoparticles. neutralization of heterologous HCV was enhanced with MV-CE1E2. the current pediatric MV immunization schedule could be adapted to accommodate two doses of a divalent MV-HCV vaccine. the current pediatric MV immunization schedule could be adapted to accommodate two doses of a divalent MV-HCV vaccine."}
