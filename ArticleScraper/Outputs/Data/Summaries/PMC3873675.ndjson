{"summary": "some viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, can evade the immune system and thus impede the effectiveness of vaccines for those viruses. antiviral small molecule inhibitors that inhibit critical steps in the virus lifecycle in infected individuals are critically needed in the battle against virus infections. ideally, these antiviral agents should completely eradicate viruses from the body without affecting normal cellular metabolism. treatment with zidovudine delays the progression of AIDS, but does not clear the virus because drug resistant mutants usually arise. long-term, high dose treatment with zidovudine can cause serious complications, such as anemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy and myopathy. aptamers are single-stranded non-coding nucleic acids screened by SELEX to perform a defined function by forming a complex structure complementary to their targets. aptamers have many advantages over small molecules and biologics for therapeutic applications, particularly as antiviral therapeutics. HCV protease inhibitors and HIV integrase inhibitors fit into crevices on protein surfaces. aptamers can also form clefts that bind protruding parts of protein. aptamers can bind more specifically and tightly because they extend surface contact with their targets. potent aptamers can be identified through the iterative SELEX process and evolved in a test tube within a month. many aptamers were developed against viral proteins (e.g., HIV reverse transcriptase and HCV NS3), nucleic acid elements (e.g., HIV TAR, HCV IRES), as well as the entire viruses (e.g., influenza A virus) merase activity; 95% reduction of HIV particle formation by transient expression of aptamers [42,63,64] HIV Drug resistant Reverse transcriptase mutant 3 M302; N-methyl-isatoicanhydride modified RNA 30 nM No inhibition of polymerase and polymerase activities with IC50 = 500 nM. inhibition of cell fusion with IC50 100 nM [76] HIV DP6 truncated Gag lacking p6 and the DP6-22.

RT catalyzes conversion of the single stranded genomic viral RNA into double stranded proviral DNA. single stranded DNA aptamers (ODN112) with high affinity for the RNase H domain of HIV-1 RT were isolated by using recombinant RTs. aptamers against wild-type (WT) HIV-1 RT, mutant 3 (M3) have been isolated. HIV-1 Integrase HIV-1 integrase catalyzes the insertion of proviral DNA into the host-cell genome. the retrovirus encoded enzyme catalyzes the insertion of proviral DNA into the host-cell genome. it is a promising target for development of antiretroviral drugs. HIV-1 Gag Protein Gag polyprotein is a major HIV-1 structural protein. it is synthesized in the cytoplasm of infected cells and orchestrates the assembly and release of HIV-1 particles. mutations in any domain of Gag lead to defects in particle assembly and loss of infectivity. the NC protein of HIV-1 plays an important role in encapsidating viral RNA. it selectively encapsidates the viral RNA among different cellular RNA pools. the NC is highly conserved and therefore is an excellent target for anti-viral therapy. aptamers block the interaction of gp120 and CD4. the aptamers suppressed the infectivity of gp120 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. they also neutralize HIV-1 infectivity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. the anti-HIV-1 gp120 aptamers effectively inhibited the replication of CXCR4-tropic (NL4-3 and IIIB) and CCR5-tropic (BaL and JRFL) HIV-1. the gp120 binding properties of an anti-gp120 aptamer, A-1, were specifically internalized by cells that expressed HIV-1 gp120. in the chimera approach, we made two designs of gp120 aptamer- the chimera significantly reduced the plasma viral load and maintained CD4 levels equivalent to those of uninfected control mice. a single gp120 aptamer was used in combination with three different siRNAs targeting HIV-1 tat/rev transcripts and HIV-1 host dependency factors. the advantage of the stick design facilitated the effective interchange of different siRNAs with a single aptamer. the aptamer consists of 16 nt appended to the 3' end of the gp120 aptamer. the aptamer consists of 86 amino acids, binds to specific regulatory elements in the HIV-1 long-terminal repeats (TAR) and regulates viral transcription. a 37-mer RNA aptamer, RNATat, was isolated through in vitro selection procedure. two major regions of the RNA aptamers were responsible for interacting with the Rev protein. these regions might provide a starting point for developing therapeutic nucleic acids for HIV-1 therapy. aptamers were constructed with the RSV and CMV promoters. aptamers were shortened to a 19-mer DNA and had a dissociation constant of 50 nM. but their inhibitory capabilities were not significantly altered. aptamers against TAR have also been developed. lentiviral gene transduction of CD34+ progenitor cells produced. lentiviral construct composed of a U6-driven TAR RNA decoy, a U6-promoted HIV-1 tat/rev shRNA, and a VA1-promoted anti-CCR5 trans-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme effectively transduced human progenitor cells. HCV is a 9.6 kb enveloped virus with a positive linear, single stranded sense RNA genome that contains a 5' non-translated region (NTR), protein coding region and 3' NTR for viral replication. some of these proteins are considered important for viral replication and proliferation, but they are prime targets for the development of antiviral therapies. aptamers, G6-16, inhibited protease activity in a mixed (competitive and non-competitive) fashion with respect to the substrate. aptamers moderately inhibited the helicase activity of NS3. inhibitory concentrations were high (Ki = 3 M) and appear to be significantly higher than those of other aptamers. the aptamer was inserted into the non-functional stem IV region of the HDV ribozyme so that the aptamer would be protected from exonuclease degradation. the chimera was attached with a nuclear export signal (CTE-M45) and arrayed as a tandem repeat in the expression plasmid in order to increase its cytoplasmic level in cells. aptamer 5 most strongly inhibited helicase activity in vitro (IC50 of 50 nM) after 8 rounds of selection, aptamer 5 most strongly inhibited helicase activity in vitro (IC50 of 50 nM) aptamer 5 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for transcribing the full length of the HCV genome. Biroccio et al. isolated an RNA aptamer against a truncated NS5B protein that lacked the C-terminal membrane localization signal (NS5B-C55) aptamers shared a consensus sequence that can fold into a stem-loop structure. one aptamer, B.2, bound to the NS5B protein with high affinity and non-competitively inhibited the activity of NS5B polymerase with internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is a highly conserved and complex RNA structure located at the 5' non-translated region of the HCV genome. the HCV IRES is associated with the host cell small ribosomal unit (40S) and eif3 to mediate translation initiation of the HCV genome in a 5' cap independent manner. the 3-07 aptamer strongly inhibited the IRES-dependent translation of firefly-luciferase mRNA in mammalian cells. conjugates of domain II-specific 2-02 aptamers and 3-07 aptamers also inhibited IRES-dependent translation about 10 times as efficiently as the 3-07 aptamer. the aptamer domain bound to domain IV of IRES interfered with formation of a productive 80S ribosomal complex. the ribozyme domain reduced the HCV RNA levels in a subgenomic replicon system by cleaving the viral genome. the viral genome encodes four open reading frames, core proteins, viral reverse DNA polymerase (P), surface antigen (S) and X protein (HBx) HBsAg is overexpressed on the surface of HBsAg+ hepatocytes. the aptamer was shown to bind specifically to the HBsAg+ hepatoma cell line HepG2.2.15, but not to HBsAg-devoid HepG2 cells. the aptamer showed higher binding to truncated P protein than wild-type RNA. cotransfection of the S9 RNA vector with an HBV expression plasmid reduced the amount of viral replicative DNA intermediates by 80%\u201385%. no sign of cytotoxicity in S9 aptamer-transfected cells. two studies independently isolated potent nucleic acid aptamers against the helicase. the aptamers showed sub-nanomolar IC50 values against the helicase. the helicase contains a functional domain with double-stranded nucleic acid unwinding and ATPase activities. there are three major genetically distinct influenza viruses (types A, B and C) no sustained person-to-person spread of these viruses has been confirmed to date. influenza B and C, which usually cause relatively mild illnesses, are of less concerns. the aptamer was found to be the most efficient at blocking hemagglutination of various H3N2 strains. intranasal administration of the aptamer into influenza-infected mice reduced the virus burden by 95%. this is comparable to the amount of inhibition seen in mice after treatment with NA-based drugs currently available. aptamers specifically targeted the HA protein of H1N1 viruses. one aptamer, D26, was further optimized and displayed strong binding affinities. this aptamer could distinguish the HA of H1N1 from other subtypes and interfere with HA-glycan interactions. aptamers were isolated through 35 iterative rounds of selection. the library was first incubated with rabies virus-infected BHK-21 cells. this process identified five aptamers that inhibited replication of RABV. this led the group to use the same cell-SELEX approach. HPV45 (30% of cases) is strongly connected to the cause of cervical cancer [197,198], which is the second most common cancer in women. HPV18 is commonly found in patients with head and neck cancer [199]. recent progresses in HPV vaccines are effective means to prevent infection with certain types of HPV, but are ineffective at treating those already infected. anti-HSV aptamers were evolved against a glycoprotein D (gd) of HSV-1 and HSV-2. the gd protein is an essential viral surface protein that is required for binding to the host cell receptors for viral entry and fusion. aptamers were selected against the gD protein and counter-selected against IgG to remove non-specific binders. one effective aptamer, G7a, inhibited HSV-2 infection in Vero cells with an IC50 of 20 nM. the aptamer is proposed to be incorporated into a microbicide to reduce the spread of HSV-1 as well as HIV-1. many patients do not tolerate cART because of its severe side effects. HIV-1 RT catalyzes conversion of single stranded genomic viral RNA into double stranded proviral DNA, which in turn is integrated into the host genome. many nucleoside inhibitors and non-nucleoside inhibitors are currently used in patients. aptamers against wild-type (WT) HIV-1 RT, mutant 3 (M3) have been isolated. anti-RT aptamers have been expressed together with flanking, self-cleaving ribozymes to generate aptamer RNA transcripts. aptamers also effectively suppressed drug-resistant variants and other HIV subtypes. truncated version of DNA aptamers against HIV-1 RT RNase H (ODN93del and ODN112del) could strongly inhibit the RNase H activity associated with HIV-1 RT. aptamers effectively blocked the processing and strand transfer activity of HIV-1 IN when used at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. the ability of RNA aptamers specific to the Gag polyprotein to inhibit HIV-1 replication have been explored. the NC protein of HIV-1 plays an important role in encapsidating viral RNA and assembling viral particles. an anti-NC RNA aptamer (N70-13) abolished NC binding to the stable trans-activation response hairpin and psi RNA stem-loops of HIV-1 RNA. aptamers that bind the HIV-1 gp120 protein have been shown to neutralize HIV-1. the researchers conducted a detailed characterization of one neutralizing aptamer, B40 (117-nt) they found the minimal region of the aptamer essential for binding gp120 comprises a three-way junction linking two helix-loops and a closing helix [141] UCLA1 tightly bound to a consensus HIV-1 subtype C gp120 and neutralized isolates of the same subtype with 50% inhibitory concentrations. mer, A-1, tested the concept of using the gp120 aptamer to deliver anti-HIV-1 small interfering (si)RNAs into HIV-1 infected cells. a covalent aptamer-siRNA chimera and a non-covalent aptamer-stick-siRNA chimera were used. the chimera significantly reduced the plasma viral load and maintained CD4 levels equivalent to those of uninfected control mice. the advantage of the stick design facilitated the effective interchange of different siRNAs with a single aptamer. the aptamer-cocktail DsiRNA conjugates after viral rebound resulted in complete, long-term suppression of HIV-1 viral loads. a follow-up treatment with the aptamer-cocktail DsiRNA conjugates after viral rebound resulted in complete, long-term suppression of viral loads. a 37-mer RNA aptamer, RNATat that bound efficiently to the Tat protein of HIV-1, was isolated through in vitro selection procedure [84] compared to authentic TAR RNA, the dissociation constant of RNATat to Tat was 133-times higher. the results demonstrated that the RNATat aptamers could specifically prevent Tat-dependent trans-activation both in vitro and in vivo. the 59-nt-long stem loop present at the 5' end of HIV-1 RNA mediates the trans-activation of transcription through binding of the viral protein Tat. the interaction between TAR RNA and Tat protein increases the processivity of the RNA polymerase, allowing high yield synthesis of the full-length retroviral genome. the selected sequences (R0624) folded into imperfect hairpins and displayed a consensus motif (5'-GUCCCAGA-3') that was complementary to the entire TAR loop. the lower nanomolar dissociation constant (KD = 30 nM at 3 mM magnesium) of the selected RNA aptamers was attributed to closing of the aptamer loop by the consensus G and A residues. lentivirally transduced cells successfully engrafted in all four infused patients by day 11. no unexpected infusion-related toxicities were seen. HIV-1 RT catalyzes conversion of single stranded genomic viral RNA into double stranded proviral DNA, which in turn is integrated into the host genome. the selected anti-RT aptamer contained a consensus sequence that resulted in the formation of an RNA pseudoknot. this RNA pseudoknot was reported to bind to HIV-1 RT in the picomolar range [63] and had an inhibitory effect on HIV-1 replication. several RNA aptamers targeting a drug-resistant HIV-1 RT have been isolated. HIV-1 infected cell led to encapsidation of the aptamer in the virion particles, which subsequently blocked the HIV-1 replication. these aptamers effectively suppressed drug-resistant variants and other HIV subtypes. a docking-based model of the OND93del-IN complex suggested that the DNA aptamer was located within a channel of the tetrameric integrase. the binding site of the aptamer may contribute to its anti-HIV-1 activity. various G-quadruplex aptamers (e.g., T30695 and AID-1) have proven effective for inhibiting HIV-1 IN in vitro. the selected aptamers (DP6-22) showed strong binding affinity to the MA, NC or entire Gag protein. the \u201cNC-binder\u201d could specifically compete with the packaging signal () of HIV-1 for binding to DP6-Gag. RNA aptamers that bind the HIV-1 gp120 protein have been shown to neutralize HIV-1. this interaction leads to fusion of the viral membrane with the target cell membrane. this interaction suggests HIV-1 gp120 as another potential therapeutic target to block HIV-1 infection. anti-HIV-1 gp120 aptamers effectively inhibited the replication of CXCR4-tropic (NL4-3 and IIIB) and CCR5-tropic (BaL and JRFL) HIV-1, as well as several clinical HIV-1 isolates [50], and were specifically internalized by cells that expressed HIV-1 gp120. a covalent aptamer-siRNA chimera and a non-covalent aptamer-siRNA chim the anti-gp120 aptamer-siRNA chimera provided HIV-1 neutralizing activity. the chimera significantly reduced the plasma viral load and maintained CD4 levels equivalent to those of uninfected control mice. a single gp120 aptamer was used in combination with three different siRNAs that targeted HIV-1 tat/rev transcripts and HIV-1 host dependency factors. a 4-nt linker was inserted between the aptamer and siRNA portions. the antisense of the siRNA is linked to the aptamer portion by the stick sequence. the aptamer consists of 16 nt appended to the 3' end of the gp120. RNA aptamers have been raised against the HIV-1 Rev protein through in vitro evolution. two major regions of the RNA aptamers were responsible for interacting with the Rev protein. aptamers produce a stable transcript and localize the transcript within the cytoplasmic compartment. the selected DNA aptamers (IV04) could fold into imperfect stem-loop structures and presented a consensus motif (5'-ACTCCCAT-3') the six central bases of the consensus were complementary to the TAR apical region, allowing the formation of RNA-DNA kissing complexes in the presence of 10 mM magnesium. lentiviral gene transduction of CD34+ progenitor cells has been produced by lentiviral gene transduction. lentiviral gene transduction of CD34+ progenitor cells has increased suppression of HIV-1 over 42 days compared to cells that received single anti-tat/rev shRNA or double combinations of shRNA/ribozyme. hepatitis C infection is a serious public health problem that chronically affects 170 million people worldwide. infection with hepatitis C virus places individuals at high risk for scarring of the liver and ultimately leads to cirrhosis and liver cancer. there is a need for new therapies, including a combination therapy of PEGylated interferon- and ribavirin. many aptamers have been evolved against NS3 as potential anti-HCV agents. the selected aptamers, G6-16, bound specifically to the protease domain of NS3 and inhibited its activity in vitro. the aptamers moderately inhibited the protease activity of NS3. protease activity of both truncated NS3 and entire NS3 in non-competitive manner was in stem I, stem III and loop III of the aptamers. aptamer expression system was designed that combined the G9-1 aptamer with cis-acting genomic human hepatitis delta virus ribozymes to construct a chimeric HDV-ribozyme-G9-aptamer [162]. the poly U tail had only a moderate IC50 (1 M) for inhibiting the NS3 helicase. after 8 rounds of selection, aptamer 5 most strongly inhibited helicase activity in vitro. NS5B viral polymerase of HCV is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is essential for transcribing the full length of the HCV genome. NS5B synthesizes a negative strand RNA that serves as a template for the synthesis of new positive RNA strands. this role of NS5B in the HCV life cycle has made it attractive for the development of anti-HCV agents. the 27v aptamer could inhibit viral RNA synthesis and interfere with viral particle production in HCV JFH1 infected Huh7 cells. other aptamers include 2' F modified aptamers evolved by Lee et al. aptamer-ribozyme chimera was targeted to domain IV of the IRES and a hammerhead ribozyme that targeted the HCV genome. a 25-nt long randomized region was attached at the 3' end of the ribozyme. a chimeric molecule (HH363-50) composed of two inhibitors was identified. the aptamer domain bound to domain IV of IRES interfered with formation of a productive 80S ribosomal complex. the ribozyme domain reduced the HCV RNA levels in a subgenomic replicon system by cleaving the viral genome. amers, G6-16, inhibited protease activity in a mixed (competitive and non-competitive) fashion with respect to the substrate. aptamers moderately inhibited the helicase activity of NS3. aptamers have potential to serve as a dual-function inhibitor. expression system was designed that combined the G9-1 aptamer with cis-acting genomic human hepatitis delta virus ribozymes to construct a chimeric HDV-ribozyme-G9-aptamer. the aptamer was inserted into the non-functional stem IV region of the HDV ribozyme so that the aptamer would be protected from exonuclease degradation in the presence of the tightly packed structure of the HD aptamer 5 most strongly inhibited helicase activity in vitro. helicase activity of the protein was inhibited by the aptamer 5, suggesting that the aptamer may bind to the nucleic acid binding site of the helicase to block the unwinding activity. Biroccio et al. isolated an RNA aptamer against a truncated NS5B protein that lacked the C-terminal membrane localization signal (NS5B-C55) aptamers shared a consensus sequence that can fold into a stem-loop structure. one aptamer, B.2, bound to the NS5B protein with high affinity and non-competitively inhibited the activity of NS5B polymerase with internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is a highly conserved and complex RNA structure located at the 5' non-translated region of the HCV genome. the HCV IRES is associated with the host cell small ribosomal unit (40S) and eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) to mediate translation initiation of the HCV genome in a 5' cap independent manner. the 3-07 aptamer strongly inhibited the IRES-dependent translation of firefly-luciferase mRNA in mammalian cells. conjugates of domain II-specific 2-02 aptamers and 3-07 aptamers also inhibited IRES-dependent translation about 10 times as efficiently as the 3-07 aptamer. the aptamer domain bound to domain IV of IRES interfered with formation of a productive 80S ribosomal complex. the ribozyme domain reduced the HCV RNA levels in a subgenomic replicon system by cleaving the viral genome. it is estimated that HBV infection affects approximately 350 million people worldwide. HBsAg is overexpressed on the surface of HBsAg+ hepatocytes. the aptamer was shown to bind specifically to the HBsAg+ hepatoma cell line HepG2.2.15, but not to HBsAg-devoid HepG2 cells. the aptamer showed higher binding to truncated P protein than did wild-type RNA. cotransfection of the S9 RNA vector with an HBV expression plasmid reduced the amount of viral replicative DNA intermediates by 80%\u201385%. there was no sign of cytotoxicity in HBsAg-transfected cells. protein and the RNA stem-loop at the 5' end of the HBV pregenomic (pg) RNA are a unique characteristic of HBV replication. these interactions are required for the assembly of replication-competent capsids. formation of the P- complex is necessary for protein-primed reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. the causative agent of SARS is the SARS coronavirus (SCoV) the virus is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of 30 kb. it encodes two large replicative polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, and structural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. there is still no effective therapeutic regimen against the virus. both MERS-CoV and SCoV belong to the genus beta-coronavirus. however, they are genetically distinct and their replicase domains only have less than 50% amino acid identity. influenza B and C, which usually cause relatively mild illnesses, are of less concerns. the HA antigen is ubiquitously expressed (900 copies per virus) on the surface of each viral particle and is required for binding and membrane fusion with host cells to mediate the early stage of viral infection. eight aptamers against influenza viruses have been developed for therapeutic purposes, and all of these aptamers target HA. the isolated aptamers were identified as blocking viral-cell interactions by binding to the HA of the target strains and failing to recognize other influenza A subtypes. this study clearly demonstrated that the isolated aptamers displayed different molecular recognition mechanisms and had >15-fold higher binding affinity to the HA in comparison with the commercially available anti-HA monoclonal antibody [107]. a cell-SELEX approach was used to isolate DNA aptamers against RABV. this process identified five aptamers that inhibited replication of RABV. the aptamer, FO21, inhibited significantly the replication of RABV but not other related viruses. almost all mice died when they were challenged with RABV prior to treatment with aptamers. RABV replicates rapidly and produces a large amount of infectious particles once it enters the brain, making the aptamer ineffective. 440 million infections and 288,000 deaths worldwide. HPV16 E7 Several groups have selected nucleic acid to HPV16 E7 proteins and demonstrated similar results. the roles of E7 in the cell are well-characterized. the proteins interact with the cell cycle control protein pRb, inhibiting its binding with E2F transcription factors. anti-HSV aptamers were evolved against a glycoprotein D (gd) of HSV-1 and HSV-2. the gd protein is an essential viral surface protein that is required for binding to the host cell receptors for viral entry and fusion. the gd protein is an essential viral surface protein that is required for binding to the host cell receptors for viral entry and fusion. aptamer-siRNA chimeras, aptamer-ribozyme chimeras and aptamer-aptamer chimeras have been shown to neutralize HSV-2 infection dependent on two entry receptors, Nectin 1 and HVEM. one effective aptamer, G7a, inhibited HSV-2 infection in vero cells with an IC50 of 20 nM and its inhibition required the ACCCA motif for binding and function aptamers are hydrophilic and therefore cannot pass through epithelia and the hydrophobic plasma membrane. aptamers could be used in the clinic because they are hydrophilic. aptamers could be used to block respiratory virus infections by using an aerosol. aptamers can degrade nucleic acid aptamers, even the 2' F modified ones, in minutes. zinc ions can be incorporated into the formulation because nucleases are sensitive to inhibition by zinc ions. aptamer-siRNA chimeras were stabilized and formulated in a hydroxyethyl cellulose gel."}
