{"summary": "the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most common viral infections in the world, leading to many deaths each year from associated liver diseases [1,2]. hepatitis B is also an important public health issue in china [2,2], as national surveys conducted since the 1970s have repeatedly showed high morbidity from HBV infections in the general population [2,4]. spatial epidemiology uses spatial information to describe and analyze human diseases. disease mapping and disease clustering analysis are relatively mature. compared with other infectious diseases such as schistosomiasis [19,20], most respiratory system diseases [21] and cardiovascular diseases [8], the spatial risk factors for hepatitis B are less obvious. study area shenzhen is a coastal city located in the south of china. the total area of Shenzhen is approximately 1952.84 km2. planning Commission of Shenzhen Municipality obtained data from hospitalized patients\u2019 medical records. they obtained data from the shenzhen centre for health information with addresses and service levels for most hospitals.

approximately 1952.84 km2 [27] data for all 57 different sub-district administrative regions were obtained from the 6th national population census [28]. data from the shenzhen centre for health information (SCHI), an institute directly administered by the health, population and family planning Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, were obtained from hospitalized patients\u2019 medical records. kriging is the best interpolation method, when the statistical data satisfies the hypothesis. kriging uses variograms which are widely used to describe regionalised variables. the nugget is a random value reflected by spatial variability and measurement error. when the distance between sample points is approximately equal to zero, random error leads to variations in the variogram values. range refers to the sample points within the range of spatial dependence. the interpretation of the Pearson correlation coefficient put forward by some scholars is as follows [34,35] however, all of these criteria are, to a certain extent, arbitrary rather than strict. the criteria in the table can be considered reliable and reasonable. the improved two-step floating catchment area method is based on the method proposed by Radke and Mu. the improved method considers the effect of distance decay in the search scope. the improved method offers an effective way to set the search radius for each hospital. a weight that is inversely proportional to the distance can be calculated according to the distance between residential areas and hospitals. the spatial access in each study unit, A k, can be indicated by the following formula: A k = k d k j D r R j l 1 d k j ( l = A, B, C ) (5) where l is the hospital level, j is the number of hospitals at that same level, k is the number of

and is the hospital the raw statistical data based on the regional administrative units indicated the number of hepatitis B cases. the morbidity from this calculation could be more accurate, and with a smaller population, the morbidity might be less accurate. hepatitis B morbidity t i obtained by calculation is only one instance of satisfying the normal distribution N ( i, i 2 ). hepatitis B morbidity t i obtained by calculation is only one instance of satisfying the normal distribution N ( i, i 2 ). i and i 2 can be calculated using the number of new hepatitis B cases and the total population in each sub-district. table 3 shows the adjusted hepatitis B morbidity in each sub-district. isha 1.56 Qingshuihe 0.85 Shahe 1.70 Yantian 1.59 Donghu 4.06 Nantou 88.40 Shatou 0.65 Dapeng

hepatitis B morbidity. kriging interpolation results show some risk factors may have had an effect on this high morbidity. figure 6 shows the spatial distribution density of each type of service facility in each sub-district. highest was observed in the south and southwest of shenzhen. the correlation between these two factors could be measured accurately by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. 139 hospitals in shenzhen in 2010 and 65 hospitals with level certificates were related to the prevention and control of liver diseases. in terms of the number of hospitals, most hospitals were located in the southwest or south of Shenzhen. most of the hospitals with high service ability are located in the southwest or south of Shenzhen. a group of gradient search radius values was set for the same hospital levels. for the level-A hospitals, the gradient search radius values were 6, 9 and 12 km. for the level-B hospitals, they were 3, 4 and 5 km and for the level-C hospitals, they were 1.7, 2 and 2.3 km. this would indicate that no services could be obtained for these sub-districts, which was highly unlikely. to resolve this challenge, we selected the nearest hospital to the sub-district and calculated its spatial access using the same process. the distribution of Spatial Access Figure 8a\u2013c shows the spatial access in each sub-district, without interpolation. the search radius values were 6, 3 and 1.7 km, corresponding to hospital levels A, B, and C. values in Figure 8b,c were 9, 4, 2 km and 12, 5, 2.3 km. the locations of high and low spatial access were approximately the same. the distribution of access was uneven as well. in sub-districts with high hepatitis B morbidity, the spatial access index was generally higher; in sub-districts with low morbidity, the spatial access index was generally lower. this result indicated hospitals were able to provide sufficient medical services for neighbouring hepatitis B patients. in general, the allocation and spatial distribution of medical resources for hepatitis B were adequate. the number of hepatitis B cases in each sub-district was expressed as: M = N c P (6) where M is the morbidity, N c is the number of new cases, and P is the exposed population. the hepatitis B morbidity t i obtained by calculation is only one instance of satisfying the normal distribution N ( i, i 2 ). the results will be a linear combination of t i and i. i and i 2 can be calculated using the mathematical expectation i and variance i 2 of the normal distribution in each sub-district. i = = y i / n i (9) i 2 = n i ( t i) 2 n i n (10) where and n represents the mean value of hepatitis B morbidity and population in the study area. the highest morbidity was observed in the southwest of shenzhen. Nantou and its vicinity exhibited the most hepatitis B infections. ing, Pingdi, Shiyan, Pingshan, Lianhua, Donghu, Nan\u2019ao, Shekou (S) and their respective vicinities represented the other high-morbidity areas in Shenzhen in 2010. Figure 5a shows a statistical map of grade, whereas Figure 5 shows a contour map that weakens the influence of administrative boundaries on the spatial distribution of hepatitis B morbidity. the

results will be a linear combination of t i and i. i and i 2 can be calculated using the number of new hepatitis B cases and the total population in each sub-district. table 3 shows the adjusted hepatitis B morbidity in each sub-district, which was used for kriging interpolation after preprocessing. ang 1.40 Zhaoshang 2.05 Shatoujiao 3.13 Dongxiao 0.67 Nanshan 0.64 Meisha 1.56 Qingshuihe 0.85

grade, whereas figure 5 shows a contour map that weakens the influence of administrative boundaries on the spatial distribution of hepatitis B morbidity. the population often flows constantly from one district to another. distribution density in each sub-district could be calculated with the following formula: D f = N f S (11) where D f is the density of the facilities in each sub-district. highest was observed in the south and southwest of shenzhen. coefficients in this table are considered reasonable and reliable. each of the four types of service facilities showed a positive correlation with hepatitis B morbidity in shenzhen in 2010. these four types of service establishments can be easily regarded as dangerous sources of HBV infection. figure 6 shows the spatial distribution density of each type of service facility in each sub-district. highest was observed in the south and southwest of shenzhen. each of the four types of service facilities showed a positive correlation with hepatitis B morbidity in shenzhen in 2010. these four types of facilities to an extent can make people\u2019s life convenient and drive local economic development. they greatly increase the risk of hepatitis B infection. based on the mean population density of Shenzhen, the search radius values were calculated. for the level-A hospitals, the gradient search radius values were 6, 9 and 12 km. for the level-B hospitals, they were 3, 4 and 5 km and for the level-C hospitals, they were 1.7, 2 and 2.3 km. to resolve this challenge, we selected the nearest hospital to the sub-district and calculated its spatial access using Equation (5). this would indicate that no services could be obtained for these sub-districts, which was highly unlikely. hu 7.82 14.52 19.33 Lianhua 30.58 31.72

lower. this result indicated hospitals were able to provide sufficient medical services for neighbouring hepatitis B patients. setting the value of the search radius Based on the mean population density of Shenzhen. the result indicated that the level-A hospital search radius was 6 km, the level-B hospital search radius was 3 km, and the level-C hospital search radius was 1.7 km. a group of gradient search radius values was set for the same hospital levels. spatial access to hospitals in each sub-district could be calculated using Equation (5). this would indicate that no services could be obtained for these sub-districts, which was highly unlikely. we selected the nearest hospital to the sub-district. uan 20.63 24.50 25.40 Huaqiang North 51.10 58.86 60.84 Xiangmihu 7.82 14.52 19.33

higher. in sub-districts with low morbidity, the spatial access index was generally lower. spatial distribution of medical resources for hepatitis B was adequate. measures must be taken to strengthen prevention and control of hepatitis B."}
