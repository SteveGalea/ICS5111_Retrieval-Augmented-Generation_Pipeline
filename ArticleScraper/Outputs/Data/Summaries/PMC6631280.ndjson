{"summary": "picobirnaviruses (PBVs) are small non-enveloped bi-segmented double-stranded RNA viruses. they have been reported in other terrestrial and marine mammals, birds, invertebrates and environmental water samples. we have described the first discovery and a high diversity of PBVs in California sea lions from an oceanarium in Hong Kong. a recent study on PBV detected in a marmot of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau found that segmentation-associated motifs were identified in both bi-segmented and unsegmented PBVs. unsegmented PBVs may undergo genome segmentation at the motif region and convert to segmented PBVs. this represents a unique segmentation mechanism, which represents a unique segmentation mechanism. all respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs in cattle, dogs, cats, and horses; throat swabs in monkeys; mouth swabs in bats; and tracheal swabs in chickens) were collected with the help of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. 157 bats, 52 monkeys, 50 dogs, 50 cats, 116 horses, 51 cattle, and 100 chickens have been tested. RNA was eluted in 60 L of AVE buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used as the template for RT-PCR. RT-PCR for PBVs and DNA Sequencing PBV screening was performed by PCR amplification of a 205-bp (nucleotide position 967\u20131171) of the RdRp gene of genogroup I and genogroup II PBVs. s were incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 50 \u00b0C for 60 min. mixture contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2), 200 M of each dNTP, 10 M of each primer, and 1.0 U Taq polymerase. sequences of the PCR products or the clones were compared with known sequences of the RdRp of PBVs in the GenBank database. RNA extracted from the original respiratory and alimentary specimens, using the EZ1 virus mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used as the template for RT-PCR and sequencing. nucleotide sequences of genome segment 2 and the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) were compared to those of other PBVs. clade is defined as two or more PBVs sharing >99% amino acid identities in their complete or near-complete RdRp sequences. all respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs in cattle, dogs, cats, and horses; throat swabs in monkeys; mouth swabs in bats; and tracheal swabs in chickens) were collected using procedures described previously. a total of 576 samples collected over an 83-month period in Hong Kong from 157 bats, 52 monkeys, 50 dogs, 50 cats, 116 horses, 51 cattle, and 100 chickens have been monkeys found in our locality are considered hybrids of macaca fascicularis and macaca fascicularis. 2 Species included Hipposideros pomona (n = 103), Rhinolophus affinis (n = 14), and Rhinolophus sinicus (n = 40) the mixtures were incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 50 \u00b0C for 60 min and 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. the mixture contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2), 200 M of each dNTP, 10 M of each primer, and 1.0 U Taq polymerase. sequences of the PCR products or the clones were compared with known sequences of the RdRp of PBVs in the GenBank database. the sequences of the PCR products or the clones were compared with known sequences of the RdRp of PBVs in the GenBank database. clones were sequenced using an ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer. sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce the final sequences. nucleotide sequences of genome segment 2 and the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) were compared to those of other PBVs. RT-PCR for a 205-bp fragment in the RdRp of a genogroup I PBV was positive in respiratory samples collected from three cattle and three monkeys. there were 63 (31.3%) to 73 (35.8%) nucleotide differences between 11T-1 and 11T-2. one hundred and ninety-one nucleotide positions were included in the analysis. all PBV strains detected in the same host species were highlighted in the same color, with the highlights in bold representing the PBVs discovered in respiratory specimens. s were successfully sequenced and assembled for the three positive alimentary samples from cattle. each of them contained two sequence types (C343R-1 and C343R-2, C369R-1 and C369R-2, and C374R-1 and C374R-2, respectively) the sequenced segments 2 samples ranged from 1613 to 1736 bases in length. putative RdRp sequences shared 43.0 to 80.0% amino acid identities. most closely related to dromedary picobirnavirus (GenBank number BBC20590.1), human PBV HuPBV-E-CDC16 (Genbank number KJ663816), human PBV GPBV6C1 (Genbank number AB517731), human PBV VS10 (Genbank number GU968924), and fox PBV F5-1 (Genbank number 2 1696 43.63 RdRp 58-1650 1593 530 +1 57 24.56 GTAAA 46 50.00 CTGC Reference genogroup II PBV segment 2 sequence Human 3 1674 43.91 RdRp 88-1641 1554 517 +1 87 16.09 GTAAA 33 57.58 CTC Genogroup I PBVs detected in this study PBVs (Clade) GenBank accession no.
