{"summary": "the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein is responsible for binding to sialic acid residues on the host cells. virions with uncleaved HA (HA0) are non-infectious. cell-free NLF from HVs and AAs was used to characterize the differences in protease/antiprotease expression, influenza HA cleavage, and viral replication. immunoblotting revealed that compared to HVs, SLPI expression is decreased and levels of the protease TMPRSS2 are increased, in AAs. densitometric analysis was used to quantitate the amounts of secreted TMPRSS2 and SLPI. data were expressed as levels of SLPI: TMPRSS2 ratio for each subject. numbers represent relative levels of HA2 in each sample. NLF from AAs has a disruption in the secreted protease/antiprotease balance. this is the first study to demonstrate that secreted proteases in NLF from humans can proteolytically activate influenza virions. this is a plausible risk-factor for increased susceptibility of these individuals to influenza infection. MH contributed in the clinical characterization and recruitment of the subject population. IJ contributed to the design, oversaw the coordination of the overall study, and finalized the manuscript."}
