{"summary": "influenza pneumonia was defined as laboratory-confirmed influenza plus radiographic pneumonia. patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia or non-mycoplasma bacterial coinfection were excluded. mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is a common bacterial pathogen associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recently, this bacterium has been suggested as a potential cofactor for influenza pneumonia (6). influenza pneumonia was defined as laboratory-confirmed influenza plus radiographic pneumonia (peribronchial infiltration, consolidation or pleural effusion) patients with viral coinfection were excluded due to the little impact on outcome among critically ill patients with influenza A (10. data collection Clinical findings included age (years), gender, ED visits during the influenza seasons, respiratory distress [age-adjusted tachypnea (7), chest retraction, and oxyhemoglobin saturation 90%], temperature, abnormal breathing sounds (crackle and wheezing) and comorbidity (pulmonary, hemato-oncologic, cardiac, renal, neurologic, hepatic, and immunosuppressive diseases) Statistical analysis Data are presented as the mean with standard deviation or median with the interquartile range for continuous variables. chi-square tests or Fisher\u2019s exact tests were for categorical variables. multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with M. pneumoniae coinfection. patients who underwent M. pneumoniae testing included in the current study. we excluded patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia and non-mycoplasma bacterial coinfection. data collection Clinical findings included age (years), gender, ED visits during the influenza seasons, respiratory distress [age-adjusted tachypnea (7), chest retraction, and oxyhemoglobin saturation 90%] temperature, abnormal breathing sounds (crackle and wheezing), and comorbidity (pulmonary, hemato-oncologic, cardiac, renal, neurologic, hepatic, and immunosuppressive diseases) Statistical analysis Data are presented as the mean with standard deviation or median with the interquartile range for continuous variables. chi-square tests or Fisher\u2019s exact tests were for categorical variables. multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with M. pneumoniae coinfection. non-mycoplasma bacterial copathogens detected in excluded patients (n=61) influenza pneumoniae coinfection was most frequent in the patients aged 10 years or younger (Figure 3). the temporal distribution of influenza pneumonia mirrored the influenza seasons in Korea (horizontal, stippled bars) endemic M. pneumoniae infections occurred outside the 2 recent epidemics in Korea (horizontal, white bars). the predominant strains of influenza A in the united states and Korea from 2009 through 2017. without M. pneumoniae coinfection Tables 1 and 2 outline the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings. the patients with the coinfection were younger (usually 10 years or younger), with a higher frequency of age of 5\u201314 years. this variable was regarded as the age of 5\u201310 years due to the absence of patients aged 11\u201314 years in this population. 43 (21.2) 0.340 Cardiac 42 (17.2) 2 (4.9) 40 (19.7) 0.022 Renal 24 (9.8) 0 (0) 24 (11.8) 0.018 Neurologic 16 (6.6) 2 (4.9) 14 (6.9) >0.999 Hepatic 8 (3.3) 1 (2.4) 7 (3.4) >0.999 Immunosuppressive 7 (2.9) 0 (0) 7 (3.4) 0.605 The values are expressed as the median (interquartile range) or number ( 0.796 The values are expressed as the mean standard deviation, median (interquartile range) or number (%).
