{"summary": "seasonal influenza viruses display distinct seasonal patterns in temperate climates with peak infection rates occurring in the winter months. the same seasonal trends do not necessarily apply to regions in tropic and subtropic climates where influenza virus activity can be detected year round. there are three generally accepted modes of influenza virus transmission. studies in human volunteers support a role for aerosols in influenza virus transmission. temperature and humidity are inextricably linked when considering their effects on evaporation rates and on infectious particle dynamics. ferret model has become an invaluable tool for evaluating virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses. influenza viruses exhaled by infected ferrets are influenced by the temperature and humidity in which the animals are housed. findings draw attention to the importance of climatic effects on influenza virus transmission and the potential for temperature and humidity to play a role. \u00b0C/70%RH (4.8 g/m3 AH); 23\u00b0C/50%RH (6.2 g/m3 AH) and 23\u00b0C/70%RH (14.4 g/m3 AH) prior to inoculation, ferrets were allowed to acclimatize inside the chamber for at least four days. one day post inoculation a nave ferret was placed in a cage adjacent to each inoculated animal. nasal washes (NW) were collected every other day for up to 11 dpi or days post contact (dpc) [22] for virus titration. clinical signs of infection including weight loss, fever and activity levels were recorded daily for inoculated and contact animals. aerosols were collected from ferrets immediately after exhalation for 15 minutes of normal breathing and 5 minutes of sneezing. they were separated onto two stages by size (>4.7 m or 0.65\u20134.7 m) the effects of the aerosol collection procedure on influenza virus recovery was evaluated in duplicate by applying a known amount of virus directly on prepared impactor plates. an interaction term was also included in the model to evaluate if aerosol volume data varied based on virus, ferret housing condition, exhaled aerosol sample size. a Poisson regression model was used to estimate the means and differences in means for aerosol virus count data. ferrets were allowed to acclimatize inside the chamber for at least four days. for each virus, three ferrets were sedated with a ketamine/zylazine/atropine hydrochloride cocktail injection. one day post inoculation a nave ferret was placed in a cage adjacent to each inoculated animal. nasal washes (NW) were collected every other day for up to 11 dpi or days post contact (dpc) [22] for virus titration by standard plaque assay in MDCK cells. clinical signs of infection including weight loss, fever and activity levels were recorded daily for inoculated and contact animals. aerosols were collected from ferrets immediately after exhalation for 15 minutes of normal breathing and 5 minutes of sneezing. RNA copy numbers were extrapolated using a standard curve based on samples of known virus titer (pfu/mL) aerosol collection media was harvested and processed as described for ferret sample collection to determine the percentage of RNA and infectious virus recovered. the independent parameters included: virus, ferret housing condition, and exhaled aerosol sample size. an interaction term was also included in the model to evaluate whether aerosol volume data varied based on virus, ferret housing condition and exhaled aerosol sample size. dpc to establish differences in morbidity in ferrets housed under each environmental condition. inoculated contacts b Environmental Condition (\u00b0C/%RH) Absolute Humidity (g/m3) Presented Dose (log10 pfu) Peak Temp Change e (day) d Peak % Weight Loss (day) d Peak NW c Titer (day) d Peak % Weight Loss (day) d Peak NW c dDay post inoculation or post contact the peak was observed is shown in parentheses. fRDT, Respiratory droplet transmission frequency and the day post-exposure that virus was first detected in contact animals is shown in parentheses. peak temperatures were detected 2\u20133 dpi in inoculated animals. weight loss observed in animals infected after exposure to inoculated animals was not as severe, with mean maximum values 8.7% for all groups. uninfected animals from the transmission experiments showed minimal weight loss regardless of housing condition. RD transmission experiments were performed at each environmental setting to assess the ability of PN99 and IN11 viruses to transmit through the air among ferrets housed under different environmental conditions. successful transmission was noted when virus was detected in nasal wash samples within 11 dpc and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers against homologous virus were detected in convalescent serum collected after 18 dpc. three ferrets each were housed under designated environmental conditions. they were presented with 103.8\u2013105.5 pfu of PN99 (A) or IN11 (B) virus by aerosol inhalation. one day later, a nave, contact ferret was placed in a cage adjacent to each inoculated animal. transmission was detected by 3 dpc in 2 of 3 ferret pairs at 23\u00b0C/70%RH in both the PN99 and IN11 virus groups. a single ferret housed at 23\u00b0C/70%RH had >105 pfu/mL of IN11 virus in the NW sample for that day. particle counts were lowest at lowest RH condition (23\u00b0C/30%RH). greater proportion of aerosol particles are 0.5 m, below the detection limit of the APS. kinetics of increased aerosol shedding cannot be linked to the time point at which transmission was observed for each animal. volume data from inoculated animals at all time-points after inoculation were normalized to each ferret\u2019s nave level of aerosol shedding at each environmental setting. normal breathing sampling showed similar volumes of exhaled aerosols between PN99 and IN11 viruses with exception of IN11 virus-inoculated ferrets housed at 5\u00b0C/70%RH. aerosols were collected for 15 minutes of normal breathing and 5 minutes of sneezing. comparisons were made among the amounts of infectious virus exhaled by infected ferrets housed under controlled environmental conditions. aerosol samples were presented with 103.8\u2013105.5 pfu of PN99 (green) or IN11 (orange) virus by aerosol inhalation. on 1, 3 and 5 dpi, aerosol samples were collected from ferrets for 15 minutes of normal breathing (A) and 5 minutes of sneezing stimulation (B) and were segregated based on size (0.65\u20134.7 m or >4.7 m) RNA recovery was 47 to 81% for PN99 virus and 11 to 37% for IN11 virus. the total amounts of infectious virus exhaled by individual animals during 15 minutes of normal breathing peaked between 7 and 42 pfu for PN99 virus and between 50 and 73 pfu for IN11 virus for all of the environmental conditions tested. influenza virus in aerosol samples exhaled by infected ferrets based on recovery rates. three ferrets each were housed under the designated environmental conditions. each dot represents a single animal at a single time point. chamber set to one of four experimental conditions (5\u00b0C/70%RH, 23\u00b0C/30%RH, 23\u00b0C/50%RH, or 23\u00b0C/70%RH) for each condition, three ferrets were inoculated by aerosol inhalation with 103.8\u2013105.5 pfu of PN99 or IN11 virus. aData shown represent the mean of 3 inoculated animals. cNW, Nasal wash titer (log10 pfu/mL) SD is shown. dDay post inoculation or post contact the peak was observed is shown in parentheses. peak temperatures were detected 2\u20133 dpi in inoculated animals. MV of respiration was measured by plethysmography at 0, 2, 4 and 6 dpi for each inoculated animal. largest change in respiration of ferrets in the IN11 virus group housed at 23\u00b0C/30%RH. three ferrets each were presented with 103.8\u2013105.5 pfu of PN99 or IN11 virus by aerosol inhalation and contact ferrets, n = 3, were placed in adjacent cages one day later. both infected (C) and uninfected (D) contact animals were monitored for weight loss. any contact animal shedding detectable virus in nasal washes was considered infected. all PN99 virus-inoculated animals except for one ferret housed at 23\u00b0C/30%RH and by 9 dpi in all but one ferret in the IN11 virus group housed at 23\u00b0C/70%RH. levels of virus shedding in NW samples were higher in the IN11 virus-inoculated animals compared to PN99 virus. at 5\u00b0C/70%RH, transmission occurred in 1 of 3 ferrets exposed to PN99 virus-infected animals by 3 dpc. no transmission occurred in the IN11 virus contact group. frequency of transmission events at 23\u00b0C/30%RH was greatest with 2 of 3 ferrets for PN99 virus by 3\u20135 dpc. aerosol particles in exhaled breath were highly variable among ferrets. significance at this time point was found among all ferret groups. particle counts were lowest at lowest RH condition (23\u00b0C/30%RH) aerosol particle counts were measured for individual ferrets, n = 3, collected during 15 minutes of normal breathing (A) or 5 minutes of sneezing stimulation (B) on 2, 4 and 6 dpi. aerosol volumes were measured from ferrets during 15 minutes of normal breathing (NB) or 5 minutes of sneezing stimulation (SZ) data collected from nave animals, n = 6 (A) and data collected from inoculated animals were combined and compared. the overall normal breathing grand mean values were lowest at 23\u00b0C/50%RH. other conditions were similar but slightly higher, and little difference was observed between the two size ranges. in most cases, IN11 virus RNA levels were higher in these samples compared to PN99 virus at the respective housing conditions. on 1, 3 and 5 dpi, aerosol samples were collected from ferrets for 15 minutes of normal breathing (A) and 5 minutes of sneezing stimulation (B) the impact of the aerosol collection procedure on virus recovery was tested for each controlled environmental condition by spiking the collection medium on each impactor stage. PN99 virus RNA recovery from either stage ranged from 54 to 79%, similar to IN11 virus RNA recovery which was 47 to 81%. the levels of infectious influenza virus were significantly lower at 23\u00b0C/50%RH compared to all other groups (p0.0001) and 23\u00b0C/30%RH was significantly higher than all other groups (p0.01) these findings support those derived from NW titer comparisons. aerosol samples were collected from ferrets on 1, 3, and 5 dpi for 15 minutes of normal breathing (A) and 5 minutes of sneezing stimulation (B) total plaque forming units (pfu) exhaled by infected ferrets in both size ranges combined and at each time point are presented. each dot represents a single animal at a single time point. the viruses chosen for this study were selected because one represents a seasonal H3N2 strain (PN99 virus), the other is a swine-origin H3N2 variant strain (IN11 virus) responsible for a summertime infection [7,25] both were previously shown to be highly transmissible in the ferret model under normal laboratory conditions. in the years preceding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, swine-origin H1N1 viruses also caused ferrets exhaled by ferrets housed at 23\u00b0C/70%RH compared to the seasonal H3N2 virus (PN99) no difference in the frequency of transmission was observed for the virus pair, indicating that this virus has no enhanced ability to transmit under these conditions. pigs revealed reduced RD transmission capabilities of influenza virus at 50%RH. RD transmission was also observed (down to 17% with both virus groups combined) at 50%RH. lower levels of infectious virus present in aerosols exhaled by infected animals. guinea pig and ferret studies concur that RD transmission is most efficient in low RH environments. evaporation is minimal, but at low humidity environments, below the efflorescence RH (50%RH), the solute components crystallize rendering the virus intact and viable. the levels of influenza virus measured at each condition during sneezing sessions were not consistent with the frequency of transmission events. it has been suggested that the virus released during normal breathing may be more instrumental in influenza transmission through the air. despite these challenges, increased sneezing is routinely reported in ferrets infected by influenza viruses. increasing collection times often compromise collection efficiency and the preservation of virus infectivity. virological and aerobiological techniques will ultimately further our understanding of influenza virus infection and transmission in the diverse environmental conditions experienced throughout the year."}
