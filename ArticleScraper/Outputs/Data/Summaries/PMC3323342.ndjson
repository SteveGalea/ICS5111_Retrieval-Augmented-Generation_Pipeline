{"summary": "the need was agreed on for controls to isolate SARS patients. a four-phase environmental approach was developed. a needs assessment for healthcare facilities was conducted to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of SARS in hospitals. the first 10 hospitals and 2 fever clinics were visited from April 29, 2003, through May 13, 2003, in and around Taipei and Kaoshiung, Taiwan. Table 1 describes the first 10 hospitals and 2 fever clinics that were visited from April 29, 2003, through May 13, 2003. hospitals listed strongly suggested (or required) wearing filtering face-piece respirators when entering the hospital. people entering these facilities were screened for fever before entering the facility. eIRs planned ranged from simple (standard bathroom exhaust fans, without HEPA or UV treatment of exhaust air) to well-designed single-pass exhaust air systems. guidelines for the Integrity and Inspection of SARS Isolation Wards were to be used to construct permanent infrastructure. the information included the appropriate layout of a SARS treatment room and ward, ventilation design for sufficient negative pressure in AIIRs, and filtration and treatment of exhausted air. the document also included measures to enhance infection control and protect healthcare workers during maintenance of the isolation room and ventilation system. mechanical drawings, blueprints, and ventilation testing reports were reviewed. air handling units, HEPA filters, outside air intakes, and rooftop exhaust ductwork were inspected. standard versus simple negative-pressure isolation rooms were observed. health workers, hospital staff, and visitors all wore filtering face-piece surgical masks or respirators of varying brands and efficiencies. in many nurses' stations, posters describing standard operating procedures for SARS protective equipment were present. environmental findings were discussed at a closing meeting. bPressure monitors were digital or analog manometers installed outside patient room. f32% isolation rooms were not negatively pressurized, no ICU, not recommended for SARS patients. jModify 2-way switches in simple isolation rooms so that fans cannot operate in reverse. two proposals for the construction of specialized SARS screening and isolation facilities in southern Taiwan were reviewed by NIOSH and Taiwanese environmental specialists. one proposal considered configuring arrays of shipping containers into patient AIIRs linked in hub-and-spoke fashion by a central nurses' station. the second proposal was to convert vacated military barracks into a patient\u2013screening facility. 11 dedicated SARS hospitals and medical centers were geographically dispersed throughout Taiwan. hospitals completed the conversion (start of construction to patient acceptance) after the design phase, hospitals completed the conversion on an average of 13 days. from may 31 through June 10, 2003, 11 dedicated SARS hospitals were evaluated to assess AIIRs and wards, infection control practices, healthcare worker and patient entrance and egress pathways. a walkthrough of the patient and healthcare worker pathway was conducted, including an inspection of the various isolation gradients (nurses' stations, change rooms, change rooms, and AIIRs) design criteria included specifications from existing CDC tuberculosis guidelines (3), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers Design Manual for Hospitals and Clinics (4), and the American Institute of Architects Guidelines for Hospitals and Health Care Facilities (5). massive infrastructure modifications were necessary to achieve the desired objectives of increased capacity to triage and treat seriously ill patients. work shifts in some hospitals were reduced to 3 or 4 hours. all hospitals had an established infection control department and an infection control plan. summary of key design features of dedicated SARS hospitals. cNumber of isolation rooms (IR) constructed and number of patient rooms previously at the hospital. dPersonnel exiting the isolation ward are required to shower. eFacility has completed a test and balance (T&B) of the ventilation system to verify proper function. industrial hygiene specialists will be faced with similar circumstances. the standard industrial hygiene rubrics of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control remain useful. more inventive approaches to risk and hazard assessment will be necessary."}
