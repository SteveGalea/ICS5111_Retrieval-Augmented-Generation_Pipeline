{"summary": "157 of the 981 nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for HCoVs. the species detected were 229E (96 cases, 9.8%), OC43 (42 cases, 4.3%), HKU1 (16 cases, 1.6%) and NL63 (11 cases, 1.1%). 48 of 157 patients were co-infected with HCoVs. human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are enveloped viruses with a single-strand RNA genome. HCoVs are associated with respiratory syndromes ranging from mild upper to severe lower respiratory tract infections. 981 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected continuously from adults with URTI in Beijing between March 2009 and February 2011. HCoVs infections were detected by real-time RT-PCR with excellent specifity and sensitivity [19], [23], [26], and other 11 respiratory viruses infection among all specimens were also detected. a set of criteria included respiratory symptoms, a body temperature above 37.5\u00b0C, and a normal or low leukocyte count(1010/L), but not LRTI identified by pulmonary abnormalities on radiography and clinical descriptions. all swabs were collected into viral transport medium and transported for immediate testing to the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (NIVDC) cDNA was synthesized with AMV reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers. assays andViruses detected Primer* and probe Target genes Ref Real-time rtPCR HCoV-OC43 OC43-F GCTCAGGTCTGCTCC N 19 OC43-R TCCTGCACTAGAGGCTCTCTGC OC43-P FAM \u2013TTCCAGATCTCTACTTCGCGCACATCC-TAMRA HCoV-229E 229E-F CGCAAGAATTCAGAACCAGAGAGAG GCACATC Hexon AD-1R CAGCACGCCGCGTGTCAAAGT AD-2R TTGTACGCGGTATCCTCGCGGTC AD-2F9 CMGASACSTACTTCAGYMTG AD-2R9 GTASGYRKTRTCYTCSCGGTC Mix2 hRSV RS-1F TGGGAGARGTRGCTCCAGAATACAGGC N 26 RS-1R ARCATYACTTGCCCTGMACCATAGGC RS-2F gel-based RT-PCR for Detection of non-HCoV Respiratory Viruses Specimens were also screened for influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), picornaviruses (including enteroviruses and rhinoviruses) patients and Specimens Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from adults presenting with URTI to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China, between March 2009 and February 2011. cDNA was synthesized with AMV reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers. real-time RT-PCR for HCoV Detection Real-time RT-PCR amplification was performed using TaqMan\u00ae One-Step RT- a real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR technique was used to screen for each of the 4 non-SARS HCoVs. the lower limit of detection of each HCoV real-time RT-PCR assay was 50\u2013100 copies/25uL. the lower limit of detection of each HCoV real-time RT-PCR assay was 50\u2013100 copies/25uL.

HCoV-OC43 detections peaked in April 2009. there were no statistically significant differences in the clinical symptoms between species-specific HCoVs except for rhinorrhea. there were no statistically significant differences in the clinical symptoms between species-specific HCoVs except for rhinorrhea, which was observed less in 229E-infected patients than in the other cases (P = 0.025). of the 157 HCoV positive patients, 48 (30.57%) were co-infected. most HCoV-associated co-infections involved human rhinoviruses (all picornaviruses positive samples were confirmed to be rhinoviruses by DNA sequencing) compared to single HCoV infections, there was no evidence to indicate patients had more serious illnesses. HCoVs were detected by real-time RT-PCR in 157 (16.0%) of the 981 specimens: 229E in 96 (9.8%), OC43 in 42 (4.3%), HKU1 in 16 (1.6%) and NL63 in 11(1.1%) HCoV-229E was the most common species, appearing in most months and without an obvious seasonal distribution. peaks in 229E detections occurred in May 2009, December 2009 and August 2010, corresponding with spring, winter and summer, respectively, in Beijing.

URTI occurs commonly in children and adults and is a major cause of mild morbidity which have a high cost to society. URTI among adults are responsible for missed work and unnecessary medical care. four non-SARS HCoVs (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) are regularly associated with URTI in adult patients in china. this is the first comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of four non-SARS HCoVs as causes of URTI in adults admitted to hospital in china."}
