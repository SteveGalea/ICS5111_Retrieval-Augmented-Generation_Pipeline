{"summary": "the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of many positive-stranded RNA viruses contain key cis-acting regulatory sequences, as well as high-order structural elements. we investigated the roles of a conserved stem-loop 2 (SL2) that resides in the 5'UTR of the genome of a type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. RNA shares the common genomic 5' leader sequence, the whole 5' untranslated region (UTR) for PRRSV. the key control elements for the fusion of leader and bodies are the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) that are present at the 3' end of the leader sequence (leader TRS) and the 5' end of the coding sequence for each ORF (body TRSs) the 5' UTRs between different groups of coronaviruses have conserved stem-loops. these structural elements may facilitate the presentation of the consensus leader TRS sequence accessible for discontinuous RNA transcription. a pseudoknot structure formed by RNA-RNA tertiary interaction between two stem-loops in the 5'-terminal genomic region is crucial for negative-strand RNA synthesis for Aichi viruses [16,17]. six stem-loop structures were predicted for the 5'-proximal region for type I (nt 1-280) and type II (1-246) PRRSV. one of the stem-loops is the leader TRS-containing hairpin (LTH), first identified in the 5' proximal region of the prototypic equine arteritis virus (EAV) serial base-pair deletions in the stem region confirmed that N-SL2 could be linked with the viral sg mRNA transcription level. genome sequences of type II PRRSV 5' UTRs retrieved from GenBank. a shuttle plasmid pCBSA was generated by truncating the genomic sequences in the full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS. the desired mutations were introduced into pCBSA by the Quik-Change site-directed PCR mutagenesis method. the primers used for PCR mutagenesis are listed in Table 1. the full-length clone was designated as mutant L-LL. mutant L-RR was generated by replacing two nucleotides U56C57 with A56G57. the 3-nt loop and the one nucleotide (A55) budge were restored.

RT-PCR of RNAs extracted from pAS and WT transfected cells at 24 hours after transfection. DNase I and RNase A were used to omit template DNA and the reverse transcriptase. the stained cell monolayer was visualized under an inverted fluorescence microscope. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour with goat anti-mouse IgG (1:800 diluted, Invitrogen) the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour with an inverted fluorescence microscope. plaque was reversely placed in incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. at 4 days post infection, the plaque was visualized by crystal violet staining. total cellular RNAs were isolated from the tranfected cells at 24 hpt. RNAs were suspended in DNase/RNase-free water, and quantified by nanoDrop\u00ae ND-1000. RT-PCR was employed to detect (-) gRNAs and sg mRNAs. PCR with internal primer pair F-12 (nt 12-32) and R-343 (complementary to nt 323-343) were performed using 2 l of 1000-fold diluted primary PCR products. the cDNA was synthesized by RT primer Qst (Figure 2A right panel, Table 1). consensus primary sequences were generated for the 5'-proximal 246 nt and 280 nt of type I PRRSV of type I PRRSV, respectively. the high order structures of the two types of PRRSV 5'-proximal region were strikingly similar and characterized by six major putative helical stem-loops. it should be noted that E-SL1 in type I PRRSV could be separated into two minor stem-loops, named E-SL a \"ternary-turn loop\" is located at the top of the SL2. the stem consists of G-C rich base pairs (9/11 in E-SL2 and 8/10 in N-SL2) there were two single-nucleotide bulges in both SL2s. the loop size of N-SL2 is irrelevant to PRRSV replication. the plasmids were transfected into BHK-21 cells as described in the Materials and Methods section. total RNAs of the transfected cells were isolated by TRIzol\u00ae Reagent at 24 hpt. RT-PCR methods were used to eliminate interferences from the input DNA and the RNA transcript generated by the CMV promoter. the nested PCR with internal primer pair F-12 and R-343 revealed the presence of (-) gRNA from the transfected cells by L-LL, L-RR, and L-RL. these results suggested that the loop size can be variable from 3 nt to 8 nt without deleterious effect on (-) gRNA synthesis. mutant RNAs isolated at 48 hours post transfection were visualized by immunofluorescence staining with anti-N antibody at 24 hours post-transfection. the plaques were visualized at 5 days post infection by crystal violet staining. the average diameter of the WT viral plaque was 2.4 mm. the recovered mutant viruses displayed virtually the same size. we further assessed the multi-step growth kinetics of the recovered mutant viruses in P1 and compared them with those of the parental WT virus. gRNA synthesis was not significantly affected by structural alteration in S-LL, S-RR and S-RL. however, both (-) and (+) sg mRNA7 synthesis were abolished in S-LL and S-RR. sg mRNA7 in S-RL was undetectable using the described RT-PCR procedure. the stem restored mutant S-RL showed a lower viral titer at every time point of infection. the peak titer of 4.42 log10 PFU/ml was delayed by 12 hours compared with WT. this results suggest that the N-SL2 stem mutation rendered the virus replication in the cultured cells less fit, but nonetheless was crucial for virus viability. transfected supernatant was inoculated into fresh MARC-145 cells. the total RNAs were extracted for northern blot analysis. the substitution of SL2 actually produced more sg mRNAs. however, the substitution of E-SL2 did restore viral RNA synthesis. mutant D1-D4 contained an overall N-SL2 structure, except that the stem was gradually shortened by the increasing number of base-pair deletions. however, mutant D5 created a predicted new stem-loop 2 (N-SL2', Figure 4A ii) by reconfiguration of the upstream sequences of N-SL1. mutants D1-D6 produced (-) gRNA as the WT virus. mutants D1 and D2 produced similar levels of (+) sg mRNA7 and (-) sg mRNA7. however, in mutants D4 transfected cells, neither sense nor antisense sg mRNA7 was detectable. mutant D5 restored the expression of N protein, albeit the positive numbers were significantly lower than for the WT, D1, D2 and D3 mutant viruses. the stem integrality of N-SL2 played a key role in the process of the discontinuous sg mRNA transcription. mutant D5 reached peak titer of 4.57 log10 PFU/ml at 60 hpi. deletion at the N-SL2 stem bottom significantly decreased the growth level. genetic stability of the mutant viruses during subsequent passages in MARC-145 cells. consensus primary sequences were generated for the 5'-proximal 246 nt and 280 nt of type I PRRSV of type I PRRSV, respectively. the high order structures of the two types of PRRSV 5'-proximal region were strikingly similar and characterized by six major putative helical stem-loops. it should be noted that E-SL1 in type I PRRSV could be separated into two minor stem-loops, named E-SL a \"ternary-turn loop\" is located at the top of the SL2. the stem consists of G-C rich base pairs (9/11 in E-SL2 and 8/10 in N-SL2) there were two single-nucleotide bulges in both SL2s. the loop size of N-SL2 is irrelevant to PRRSV replication. the size of the loop was restored in mutant L-RL by combining these two mutations in both sides of the loop. total RNAs of the plasmids transfected cells were isolated by TRIzol\u00ae Reagent at 24 hpt. the nested PCR with internal primer pair F-12 and R-343 revealed the presence of (-) gRNA from the transfected cells by L-LL, L-RR, and L-RL. these results suggested that the loop size can be variable from 3 nt to 8 nt without deleterious effect on (-) gRNA synthesis. mutant RNAs isolated at 48 hours post transfection were visualized by immunofluorescence staining with anti-N antibody at 24 hours post-transfection. the plaques were visualized at 5 days post infection by crystal violet staining. the average diameter of the WT viral plaque was 2.4 mm. the recovered mutant viruses displayed virtually the same size. we further assessed the multi-step growth kinetics of the recovered mutant viruses in P1. the gRNA synthesis was not significantly affected by structural alteration in S-LL, S-RR and S-RL. however, both (-) and (+) sg mRNA7 synthesis were abolished in S-LL and S-RR (Figure 2D) the sg mRNA7 in S-RL was undetectable using the described RT-PCR procedure. the stem restored mutant S-RL showed a lower viral titer at every time point of infection. the peak titer of 4.42 log10 PFU/ml was delayed by 12 hours compared with WT. this suggests that the N-SL2 stem mutation rendered the virus replication in the cultured cells less fit, but nonetheless was crucial for virus viability. s synthesis were not markedly affected by the substitution of SL2. the transfected supernatant was inoculated into fresh MARC-145 cells. the total RNAs were extracted for northern blot analysis. we are not sure whether the observed abundance discrepancy between sg mRNAs and gRNAs was caused by imbalanced membrane transfer. mutant D1-D4 contained an overall N-SL2 structure, except that the stem was gradually shortened by the increasing number of base-pair deletions. however, mutant D5 created a predicted new stem-loop 2 (N-SL2', Figure 4A ii) by reconfiguration of the upstream sequences of N-SL1. mutants D1-D6 produced (-) gRNA as the WT virus. mutants D1 and D2 produced similar levels of (+) sg mRNA7 and (-) sg mRNA7. however, in mutants D4 transfected cells, neither sense nor antisense sg mRNA7 was detectable. mutant D5 restored the expression of N protein, albeit the positive numbers of cells were significantly lower than for the WT, D1, D2 and D3 mutant viruses. the stem integrality of N-SL2 played a key role in the process of the discontinuous sg mRNA transcription. mutant D5 reached peak titer of 4.57 log10 PFU/ml at 60 hpi. deletion at the N-SL2 stem bottom significantly decreased the growth level. genetic stability of the mutant viruses during subsequent passages in MARC-145 cells. we present genetic evidence to support that the predicted N-SL2 stem-loop structure PRRSV type II 5' UTR is essential for viral replication, particularly sg mRNA synthesis. we further demonstrated that the N-SL2 functional domain resided in its stem structure rather than the ternary-loop. this results may lead to further investigation and better understanding of the life cycle of PRRSV. similar structures can be predicted from arteriviruses and coronaviruses. similar RNA secondary structure can be predicted from arteriviruses and coronaviruses. mutant D6 was completely destroyed and changed to linear nucleotides. mutant D6 could not recreate an alternative stem-loop 2 in the same way as mutant D5. mutant D6 was completely destroyed and changed to linear nucleotides. arterivirus replication cycle starts with uncoating the translational of the nonstructural proteins that ultimately assemble into replication and transcription complex (RTC) the translated structural proteins are then assembled into virions, starting with encapsidation of progeny genome by encapsidation by encapsidation of progeny genome by encapsidation. both PRRSV and SHFV 3' UTR interact with host cell proteins. the genome packaging signals (Ps) of arteriviruses are unknown. it is reasonable to speculate that the SL2 mutation could produce similar intracellular viral RNAs. HZ helped to carry out the RT-PCR and helped to analyze the results."}
