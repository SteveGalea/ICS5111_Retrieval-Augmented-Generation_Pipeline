{"summary": "earliest, most varied and most widely studied inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synthesis are those that target the elongation step of mRNA translation. most of them act either by impairing peptidyl transferase function, impeding translocation, or interfering with aminoacyl-tRNA (transfer RNA) binding or accommodation. new interest in using translation elongation inhibitors as antineoplastics. the current trend in the development of therapeutic agents that disrupt translation has thus drifted away from inhibitors of elongation to those that target initiation. eIF4F is a heterotrimeric complex composed of eIF4E, the m7GpppN cap-binding protein that anchors the complex to the 5\u2032-end of the mRNA. eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein that bridges eIF4F to the 43S ribosom complex to the mRNA by eIF4F is thought to be rate limiting for translation initiation. the interaction of eIF4F with the cap structure is affected by mRNA proximal secondary structure with increased structure diminishing the efficiency of the eIF4E-cap interaction. increasing the amounts of eIF4E can thus disproportionately stimulate the expression of messages that were once outcompeted by unstructured mRNAs, encoding proteins that are often progrowth and pro mTOR is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIKK) -related protein kinase (PIKK) family. mTORC1 serves as a regulator of eIF4F assembly and translation initiation. mTOR signals the degradation of PDCD4 which interferes with the eIF4A/eIF4G interaction. rapamycin possesses antiproliferative activity against a number of cancer cell lines. the rapalogs temsirolimus and everolimus have been clinically approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. rapalogs are under investigation as cancer therapies in numerous clinical trials. the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway can be activated upon mTORC1 inhibition via the p70S6K /PI3K/Ras pathway. MAPK activation has been noted in human tumors following RAD001 treatment. if4ERx Eli Lilly/ISIS Phase II Pateamine A N/A Active in preclinical models Hippuristanol N/A Active in preclinical models Rocaglamides (Silvestrol) N/A Active in preclinical models Rocaglamides (Silvestrol) N/A Active in preclinical models. increased levels of eIF4E can circumvent effects on cell proliferation and cell survival (in gray box) mediated by inhibition of in vitro kinase assays with mTORC1 have shown that prolonged incubation with rapamycin is necessary to inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. this is recapitulated in vivo, where rapamycin fully suppresses p70S6K phosphorylation but fails to completely dephosphorylate 4E-BP1. the molecular basis responsible for these different phosphorylation kinetics is not well understood. the TOR-KIs are superior to rapalogs in their ability to suppress growth, proliferation, and protein synthesis. at least two TOR-KIs, Torin1 and PP242, more potently inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation than do the rapalogs. rapamycin fails to block the phosphorylation of these sites in vivo. TOR-KIs rapidly and fully inhibit mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of both 4E-BP1 and p70S6K. fully dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 is much better at inhibiting eIF4E function and translation initiation than its partially dephosphorylated variants. eIF4E and c-MYC levels can lead to PI3K/TOR-KI resistance. a chemical genetics screen validated c-MYC activation as a means to overcome the proliferative block induced by PI3K/TOR-KIs. more than 75 analogs have been synthesized and extensively tested in vitro. the best compounds that bind to eIF4E are those that model the natural mRNA cap residue. the best compounds that bind to eIF4E are, not surprisingly, those that model the natural mRNA cap residue. one study focused primarily on altering the, and phosphate groups to prevent hydrolysis by the decapping enzymes DcpS and/or Dcp1/2. a phosphoborate moiety introduced at the position supported translation efficiencies similar to that of the parent m2 7,2\u2032GpppG compound. a combined effect of protection from decapping by association with eIF4E and increased resistance to endogenous Dcp1/2 degradation. both classes of cap derivatives appear unable to cross phospholipid bilayers (requiring either lipofection or ectopic injection) the use of cap analogs could influence cellular physiology more broadly than just via eIF4E-dependent protein synthesis. a 4E-BP-like peptide coupled to a gonadotropin-receptor agonist dramatically decreased tumor burden following intraperitoneal injection in an ovarian cell xenograft mouse model. the most potent hit, called 4EGI-1, was evaluated further and found to inhibit cap-dependent translation. 4E1RCat blocked cap-dependent but not hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) -dependent translation of a bicistronic dual-luciferase reporter mRNA with an IC50 of 25 M. unlike 4EGI-1, it also blocked 4E-BP1 binding with nearly the same efficacy. second generation ASOs targeting eIF4E have been made. inhibition of known eIF4E-specific progrowth and prosurvival genes decreased in a dose-dependent manner. inhibition of known eIF4E-specific progrowth and prosurvival genes decreased in a dose-dependent manner. pateamine A (Pat A), hippuristanol, and silvestrol have been characterized extensively as inhibitors of eIF4A. all of these compounds were originally discovered and purified from natural sources. all of these compounds were initially characterized as having strong tumor cell-line-specific cytotoxic properties. eIF4 (eIF4Af) and eIF4F complex bound eIF4A (eIF4Ac) from binding RNA inhibit eIF4A helicase and ATPase activities. ribosome loading on exogenous transcripts is greatly reduced as eIF4F activity is greatly reduced. a recently characterized bacterial toxin, BPSL1549, was shown to deamidate Gln339 of eIF4A, a conserved residue in motifs V and VI within a loop flanking eIF4A\u2019s ATP- and RNA-binding sites. the Gln339 modification appeared to transform endogenous eIF4A into a dominant-negative mutant, robustly blocking cellular protein synthesis while inhibiting eIF4A silvestrol has been tested in multiple settings, from cancer cell line xenografts to oncogene-derived genetic mouse models. it has been tested in xenografts of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (697 ALL), prostate (PC-3), and breast (MDA-MBA-231) cancer lines. combination therapy was even effective against eIF4E-driven E-Myc lymphomas. silvestrol synergizes with the standard-of-care drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine. further improvement of silvestrol\u2019s pharmacology is becoming more feasible. phosphate residue alters eIF4E activity is not well understood. phospho-eIF4E phosphorylation appears to be important in cancer. eIF4E phosphorylation appears to be important in cancer. treatment reduced tumor progression and incidence only modestly, probably reflecting the rebound in eIF4E phosphorylation seen after >4 h treatment in mouse tissues. eIF2 can be phosphorylated by four different intracellular kinases (PERK, PKR, GCN2 and HRI), which respond to a variety of cellular stress conditions. a group of novel activators of HRI was discovered in a recent screen aimed to ferret out such chemicals. these similarly structured N,N\u2032-diarylurea compounds were able to specifically activate eIF2 phosphorylation and downstream stress-associated pathways in a variety of conditions. BTdCPU inhibited the growth of tumor cell lines, both in culture and in xenografts in nude mice. eIF4F is a heterotrimeric complex composed of eIF4E, the m7GpppN cap-binding protein that anchors the complex to the 5\u2032-end of the mRNA. eIF4A is an RNA DEAD box helicase that is thought to unwind RNA secondary structure surrounding the cap. eIF4G is a large scaffolding protein that bridges eIF4F to the 43S ribosomal complex. mTOR is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIKK) -related protein kinase (PIKK) family. mTORC1 serves as a regulator of eIF4F assembly and translation initiation. mTORC1 is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIKK) -related protein kinase. mTOR stimulates eIF4F formation through two mechanisms: (1) it phosphorylates eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs; of which there are three, the most prominent being 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2) mTOR signals the degradation of PDCD4 which interferes with the eIF4A/eIF4G interaction. rapamycin possesses antiproliferative activity against a number of cancer cell lines. mTOR substrate p70S6K suppresses PI3K signaling by inactivating IRS-1 as well as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and uncoupling PI3K from upstream growth factor signals. exposure of tumor cells to rapamycin leads to inhibition of p70S6K activity and subsequent stimulation of upstream PI3K signaling. ex vivo cell culture NVPBEZ235 Novartis Phase I/II SF1126 Semafore Phase I GSK2126458 Glaxo Smith Kline Phase I XL765 Exelixis Phase I/II BGT226 Novartis Phase I/II GDC0980 Genetech Phase I PF04691502 Pfizer Phase I PKI587 Pfizer Phase I eIF4F Cap analogs N/A In vitro studies 4 eIF4E expression levels should be assessed as a potential marker to inform on rapamycin resistance. the results suggest that direct inhibitors of eIF4E (and eIF4F) may synergize with rapamycin to diminish resistance. mTOR exert more profound effects on mTOR-p70S6K association than p70S6K. raptor binds 4E-BP1 more efficiently than p70S6K. mTOR-KIs are superior to rapalogs in their ability to suppress growth, proliferation, and protein synthesis. in vitro, mTORC1 can phosphorylate 4E-BP1 on Thr37/46. however, rapamycin fails to block the phosphorylation of these sites in vivo. rapamycin is very effective at allowing dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on Ser 65 and Thr 70 in vivo. mTOR inhibitors have potential to block reactivated PI3K following p70S6K inhibition. some of these drugs have off-target inhibitory effects for related PIKK family members owing to shared structural overlap. mTORC1 is the catalytic subunit of two functionally distinct complexes. phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIKK) -related protein kinase (PIKK) family. mTORC1 is a regulator of eIF4F assembly and translation initiation. rapalogs temsirolimus and everolimus have been clinically approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. temsirolimus has also been approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. there are limitations to rapamycin-based therapies. Pfizer FDA approved RAD001 (Everolimus) Novartis FDA approved CCI-779 (Temsirolimus) Pfizer FDA approved AP23573 (Ridaforolimus) Merck/ARIAD Accepted for FDA approval TOR-KI Torin1 N/A Ex vivo cell culture INK128 Intellikine Phase I AZD8055 AstraZeneca Phase I/II AZD2014 Phase I OSI027 increased levels of eIF4E can circumvent effects on cell proliferation and cell survival (in gray box) mediated by inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin. eIF4E expression levels should be assessed as a potential marker to inform on rapamycin resistance. prolonged incubation with rapamycin is necessary to inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. this is recapitulated in vivo, where rapamycin fully suppresses p70S6K phosphorylation but fails to completely dephosphorylate 4E-BP1. rapamycin binds 4E-BP1 more efficiently than p70S6K. at least two TOR-KIs, Torin1 and PP242, potently inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation than do the rapalogs. rapamycin fails to block the phosphorylation of these sites in vivo. rapamycin is very effective at allowing dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on Ser 65 and Thr 70 in vivo. inhibition of mTORC1 with TOR-KIs suppresses cell proliferation in an mTORC1/4E-BP1/2-dependent manner. cell growth inhibition is mediated by mTORC1/p70S6K. rapamycin can still mediate a partial block of cell proliferation suggesting that rapalogs influence mTOR activity. MYC and eIF4E levels expected to increase eIF4F formation independent of mTOR. eIF4F inhibition may be prominent mechanism by which PI3K/TOR-KIs exert their effects. the best compounds that bind to eIF4E are those that model the natural mRNA cap residue\u2014minimally, a m7GpppN-like molecule\u2014preserving the contacts between the - electron stacking of the eIF4E tryptophan residues (R122, R157, and K162) and the 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge. two recent synthetic routes have been developed to circumvent such limitations. phosphoborate moiety introduced at the 5\u2032 end of a luciferase-driven construct supported translation efficiencies similar to that of the parent m2 7,2\u2032GpppG compound. the latter attributed to a combined effect of protection from decapping by association with eIF4E (Schwartz and Parker 2000) and increased resistance to endogenous Dcp1/2 (and probably DcpS as well) degradation. a majority of the driver mutations in cancers up-regulate mTOR signaling. a majority of the driver mutations in cancers up-regulate mTOR signaling. reverting this dysregulation using nonphosphorylatable 4E-BP constructs often halts tumor cell proliferation. eIF4E-eIF4G interaction was monitored using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. the most potent hit, called 4EGI-1, was evaluated further. the most potent hit, called 4EGI-1, was found to inhibit cap-dependent translation. 4E1RCat was also pharmacologically active in cells and in mice. it decreased the rate of overall protein synthesis by 30%. this synergy was probably due to 4E1RCat\u2019s ability to lower Mcl-1 levels. administration of the most potent eIF4E ASO (4E-ASO4) showed pronounced in vivo activity in breast and prostate xenograft models. targeting eIF4E expression directly might prove to be more sensitive and selective toward tumors through specific down-regulation of oncogenes under eIF4F translational control. all three compounds were identified in a screen designed to identify compounds that could differentially distinguish cap-driven versus IRES-driven translation in Krebs II ascites cell extracts. they were all able to inhibit the expression of the first cap-dependent luciferase cistron (as part of a dual-luciferase bicistronic capped mRNA transcript) eIF4A and silvestrol promote binding of recombinant eIF4A to RNA. they stimulate by several fold the ATP hydrolysis activity of eIF4A. both are as efficient in blocking ribosome loading as hippuristanol. hippuristanol was able to selectively inhibit proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cell leukemia cells. in one study, a desmethyl desamino analog of Pat A showed single-agent activity against several human cancer cell xenografts in nude mice. silvestrol is at present the best-studied eIF4A inhibitor. it has been tested in xenografts of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (697 ALL), prostate (PC-3), and breast (MDA-MBA-231) cancer lines as well as the E-Tcl-1 (CLL) and E-Myc lymphoma mouse models. silvestrol administration as single-agent chemotherapy elicited apoptosis and caused tumor regression. silvestrol synergizes with the standard-of-care drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine. further improvement of silvestrol\u2019s pharmacology is becoming more feasible. new synthetic routes are helping uncover which structural features determine the activity of rocaglamides. eIF4E phosphorylation appears to be important in cancer. overexpression of eIF4E mutant profoundly blunts tumor formation. small-molecule inhibitors of the Mnk kinases might yield novel anti-cancer agents. more than 75 analogs have been synthesized and extensively tested in vitro. the best compounds that bind to eIF4E are those that model the natural mRNA cap residue. the best compounds that bind to eIF4E are those that model the natural mRNA cap residue. two recent synthetic routes have been developed to circumvent such limitations. one study focused on altering the, and phosphate groups to prevent hydrolysis by decapping enzymes DcpS and/or Dcp1/2. both classes of cap derivatives appear unable to cross phospholipid bilayers (requiring either lipofection or ectopic injection) the use of cap analogs could influence cellular physiology more broadly than just via eIF4E-dependent protein synthesis. a 4E-BP-like peptide coupled to a gonadotropin-receptor agonist dramatically decreased tumor burden following intraperitoneal injection in an ovarian cell xenograft mouse model. the most potent hit, called 4EGI-1, was evaluated further and found to inhibit cap-dependent translation. eIF4E-eIF4G interaction was monitored using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. 4E1RCat blocked cap-dependent but not hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) -dependent translation of a bicistronic dual-luciferase reporter mRNA. second generation ASOs against eIF4E have been made and results are encouraging. inhibition of known eIF4E-specific progrowth decreased in a dose-dependent manner, halting proliferation and eliciting apoptosis. three small-molecule inhibitors, pateamine A (Pat A), hippuristanol, and silvestrol (and related rocaglamide family members) have been characterized extensively as inhibitors of eIF4A and are currently being explored as potential chemotherapies. all of these compounds were originally discovered and purified from natural sources. hippuristanol is an allosteric inhibitor of eIF4A. it prevents both free eIF4 (eIF4Af) and eIF4F complex bound eIF4A (eIF4Ac) from binding RNA. ribosome loading on exogenous transcripts is greatly reduced. mutational analysis of eIF4A indicates that it requires the amino-terminal ATP-binding domain of eIF4A for its activity. a recently characterized bacterial toxin, BPSL1549, was shown to deamidate Gln339 of eIF4A, a conserved residue in motifs V and VI within a loop flanking eIF4A\u2019s ATP- and RNA-binding sites. a desmethyl desamino analog of Pat A (DMDA-Pat A) showed single-agent activity against several human cancer cell xenografts in nude mice. silvestrol is at present the best-studied eIF4A inhibitor, mostly owing to good pharmacological tolerance and little apparent nonspecific toxicity in animals. silvestrol treatment of Pten+/E-Myc-derived tumors had minimal effect when used alone. this combination therapy was even effective against eIF4E-driven E-Myc lymphomas, which do not respond to monotherapy or combination chemotherapy treatment. eIF4E phosphorylation seems vital for organismal development, yet in mouse models loss of eIF4E phosphorylation has no noticeable phenotype. eIF4E phosphorylation appears to be important in cancer. is orally bioavailable, acting on tissues (e.g., liver) within 30 min after administration. compound was found to inhibit eIF4E phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, block cellular proliferation, and engage apoptosis. treatment reduced tumor progression and incidence only modestly. a group of novel activators of HRI was discovered in a recent screen aimed to ferret out such chemicals. the most potent being BTdCPU was able to specifically activate eIF2 phosphorylation and downstream stress-associated pathways in a variety of conditions. eif2 phosphorylation in cell culture could yield therapeutic benefit. more direct and specific inhibitors of ternary complex formation will be able to target a more diverse set of tumor cell types. the need for assays and biomarkers to reliably gauge drug efficacy becomes most pressing. biomarker readouts for eIF4F activity are less obvious. mammalian genetic screens using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) libraries will tease out the unique oncogene and non-oncogene exploitable dependencies of mRNA translation factors and regulators. these screens will need to be accomplished in more clinically relevant in vivo models that better replicate the natural tumor microenvironment and non-cell-autonomous interactions."}
