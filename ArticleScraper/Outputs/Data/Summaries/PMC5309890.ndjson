{"summary": "results Design of PCLSR The PCLSR method relies on isothermal amplification of targeted DNA using DNA polymerase. the primer design was similar to those applied in other isothermal methods but included 2 outer-spiral primers with 5\u2032 terminal ExF and ExR sequences reverse complementary to DNA of black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) alpha-latrotoxin (position 180\u2013199) the polymerase extends the product from 5\u2032 to the 3\u2032 end of the structure. the same process occurs on the opposite 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 strand of p72 gene. the outer primers ligate with their 3\u2032 ends (Int-F and Int-R) to the complementary external sequences of the targeted region. sensitivity test showed the presence of ladder-like pattern of bands in serial 10-fold dilutions of a standard ASFV plasmid with p72 gene fragment. the obtained limit of detection reached 7.2 102 copies l1 (Fig. 3B, lane 6). SR products showed the presence of 3 distinct products of 115, 165 and 185 bp long (Fig. 3D, lane 1). these results indicate the presence of 3 prerequisite sequences for further amplification of cross-linked spiral products. the obtained bands were cut off from the gel, purified and sequenced. the limit of detection (LoD) reached 7.2 102 copies, l1 (lane #6). the first presence of specific \u201cladder-like\u201d products is observed after 45 min. testing of matrices from infected animals. bone marrow diluted 1:10 w/v, 2 \u2013 bone marrow concentrated. cDNA extracted from a classical swine fever virus (CSFV) strain Alfort/187. the developed assay was used for amplification of ASFV DNA extracted from blood of wild boars and pigs. this stage of study was conducted for examination of possible application of PCLSR as a simple method for ASFV surveillance. a set of negative controls represented by cDNA of CSFV and PRRS was applied to test the specificity of the developed assay. additional tests using LAMP and CPA on field samples from 17 ASF cases in wild boar and 3 outbreaks in pigs showed that samples #5 and #12 were negative in LAMP. in case of CPA in spite of remarkable fluorescence the ladder-like products were are weak or invisible in case of samples #3\u20136, 12 and 20. y Biaystok 20.05.2015 D/spleen C64 Planty Biaystok 25.06.2015 D/bone C69 Zauki Biaystok 02.07.2015 D/bone C72 Szudziaowo Sok\u00f3ka 14.07.2015 D/bone O1 Zielona Biaystok 19.07.2014 D/spleen O3 Puciki Sok\u00f3ka 27.01.2015 D/spleen The number of case (C panel (E) PCR was conducted with application of outer-spiral primers. field samples from 17 ASF cases in wild boar and 3 outbreaks in pigs. the primer design was similar to those applied in other isothermal methods. included 2 outer-spiral primers with 5\u2032 terminal ExF and ExR sequences reverse complementary to DNA of black widow (Latrodectus hesperus) alpha-latrotoxin. the 3\u2032 sequence of outer-spiral primers (IntF and IntR) were complementary to the p72 gene sequence of ASFV. the same process occurs on the opposite 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 strand of p72 gene. the outer primers ligate with their 3\u2032 ends (Int-F and Int-R) to the complementary external sequences of the targeted region. amplification results in displacement of the newly synthesized products. 115 bp, 165 bp and 185 bp are synthesized (Structures 3, 4) the remaining 5\u2032 ends of the products are reverse-complementary ligate to each other. the remaining 5\u2032 ends of the products are reverse-complementary ligate to each other and form complex cross-linked spiral structures (Structure 5). these results indicate the presence of 3 prerequisite sequences for further amplification of cross-linked spiral products. the obtained bands were cut off from the gel, purified and sequenced. all three bands showed 100% identity to the p72 gene of Georgia 2007/1 strain of ASFV. incubation of reaction mixtures in time from 30 min. up to 90 min. first presence of specific \u201cladder-like\u201d products is observed after 45 min. testing of matrices from infected wild boars and pigs Next, the developed as. say was used for amplification of ASFV DNA extracted from blood of wild boars and pigs originating from 17 cases and 3 outbreaks. a set of negative controls represented by cDNA of CSFV and PRRS was applied to test the specificity of the developed assay. a melting curve analysis showed the common temperature of products for all examined samples reached 85.3 \u00b0C. from 17 ASF cases in wild boar and 3 outbreaks in pigs showed that samples #5 and #12 were negative in LAMP. in case of CPA the ladder-like products were weak or invisible in case of samples #3\u20136, 12 and 20. panel (A) fluorescent curves observed after PCLSR in MX3005 P real-time PCR system (Stratagene) the presence of relative fluorescence increase (\u2018R\u2019-T) during following minutes of the reaction was considered as positive result. the number of case (C) or outbreak (O) has been presented. panel (E) PCR was conducted with application of outer-spiral primers. field samples from 17 ASF cases in wild boar and 3 outbreaks in pigs. 21 \u2013 blood collected from a non-infected pig. the developed PCLSR is a novel technique of isothermal amplification. it puts together the advantage of traditional PCR or real-time PCR. the cost of all isothermal methods is comparable and reaches approximately 2 EURO per sample. the isothermal methods including PCLSR seem to be a future alternative for PCR and real-time PCR assays but are not recommended by OIE yet. Hopefully, future application of PCLSR may assist in development of better biosecurity measures in terms of transportation, destruction of ASFV infectious material storage. panel of cDNA extracted from classical swine fever virus (CSFV) strain Alfort/187, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (genotype I) strain Lelystad (genotype I) and field porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV-NVRI2015) were used. panel of different matrices represented by bone marrow, blood of pig, serum of pig, blood of wild boar, spleen, kidneys, lymph nodes, tonsi 1 l of a 1:10 stock dilution of 10,000 x DMSO concentrated SYBR Green I dye was added to each reaction tube. the results were read under UV illumination. the presence of greenish fluorescence in positive samples indicated the presence of ASFV DNA. the extracted DNA was stored at 20 \u00b0C for further testing. PCR The PCR for PCLSR results verification was performed in 25 l final volume using outer PCLSR primers accordingly to the procedure of myTaq HS DNA Polymerase kit. dilution of 10,000 x DMSO concentrated SYBR Green I dye (Invitrogen) was added to the reaction vessel. reaction was conducted at 56.2 \u00b0C for 45 min. final CPA assay volume was 15 l. the samples were collected between February 2014 and December 2016. all samples were first tested using OIE and European Reference Laboratory (EURL) recommended techniques including ELISA or a confirmatory immunoperoxidase test. PCLSR optimization The PCLSR temperature and duration was optimized at various temperatures, ranging from 55.0 \u00b0C to 66.0 \u00b0C and from 30 to 90 min respectively. the assay volume was 15 l, which contained, 7.5 l of Isothermal Mastermix (OptiGene, Horsham, West Sussex, United Kingdom) 10\u201340 pmol of each outer primers, 1 l of a 1:10 stock dilution of 10,000 x DMSO concentrated SY gel and PCR Clean up (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) sequenced in both forward and backward directions on GS FLX/Titanium sequencer (Roche, Branford, Connecticut, USA) sequences were compared with reference records as Georgia 2007/1 (Accession number: FR682468.1) and Odintsovo 2/2014 (Accession number: KP843857.1) DNA extraction The extracted DNA was stored at 20 \u00b0C for further testing 7.5 l of Isothermal Mastermix 50 pmol of forward and backward inner primer (FIP and BIP), 10 pmol of outer primers (F3 and B3) and 25 pmol of loop primers (LF and LB), 1 l of standard plasmid, containing a p72 gene. results were registered under UV illumination, to detect fluorescence."}
