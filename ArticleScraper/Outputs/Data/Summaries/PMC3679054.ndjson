{"summary": "highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically decreased morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV-1. several HIV-1 entry inhibitors including the fusion inhibitor T20 (Enfuvirtide, Fuzeon) and the coreceptor CCR5 antagonist Maraviroc (Selzentry) have also been approved by the US FDA and are used especially in those patients who fail to respond to HAART [1]. antibodies include VRC01 and VRC02 [10], which target the CD4-binding site (CD4bs), PG9 and PG16 [11], which are directed against the conserved regions of variable loops of gp120 preferentially expressed on trimeric Envs. they are on average more potent and broadly neutralizing than b12, 2G12, 2F5, and 4E10 in vitro, and therefore could be more promising for HIV-1 prevention or therapy. m36 was able to enhance binding of CD4bs broadly neutralizing mAbs to recombinant HIV-1 gp120s, suggesting that m36-gp120 fusion proteins could be a novel type of candidate HIV-1 vaccine immunogens possibly better than gp120s alone[17]. a total of 49 positive phage clones were isolated after three rounds of biopanning. the DNA sequencing of their inserts identified 13 different peptide mimotopes. m36 epitope is mostly exposed/formed after gp120 binding to CD4. the selected 12-mer peptides were analyzed against a range of D values (8 to 13) only one cluster was predicted. a total of 25 gp120 residues for the cluster were predicted. 87.5% of m36 amino acid residues are found in the allowed regions. profile 3D verify score for the final VH model was 64.36, higher than the Verify expected high score (52.84). the residues in the poses 575 and 1955 are not included in the binding sites of receptors or CD4i antibodies, implying that they might not participate in the interaction with m36. we selected the pose 1734 for docking with m36 and further characterization. m36 targets the CD4-binding face of the bridging sheet (red) while 17b (purple) and X5 (green) bind to the opposite face. diagram was generated with Accelrys Discovery studio 3.5. identification of gp120 residues critical for m36 binding by point-mutagenesis. m36 bound to the wild-type gp120 and the gp120s with S209A, T297A, P369A, V372A, T373A or F382A substitution comparably. mutation of the other six residues, including all four residues from the sites C1 and C4 and two residues (Glu370, Ile371) from the C3 site, largely reduced the reactivity of m36. 37 in the CDR1 and Gly115 in the CDR3 of m36 create two hydrogen bonds against the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Met426 (distance, 2.39 ) and Pro124 (distance, 1.99 ). m36 targets a highly conserved CD4-induced structure. its binding motifs and residues have not been characterized. mapitope predicts potential binding residues of m36 by comparing the point of \u201cquantum jump\u201d which is defined as the \u201cQ point\u201d. a significant increase in the number of amino acids beyond the Q point may be resulted from the merging of adjacent clusters or recruitment of peripheral or underlying irrelevant amino acids. m36 has amino acid sequence similarity with three PDB entries (2GCY, 3E0T and 2NZ9) with 2GCY having the highest similarity. 87.5% of m36 amino acid residues are found in the allowed regions. the top 100 complexes obtained were grouped into clusters according to their interactions. 88 models of the m36-gp120 complex with Zdock Scores above 11 were refined and re-ranked with the RDOCK program. pose 1734 has the lowest E_Rdock score (\u20138.84) the interface sequence of the three top-score poses (575, 1734, 1955) the residues predicted by both Mapitope and molecular docking methods are underlined. we analyzed the potential importance of these residues by site-directed mutagenesis (alanine scanning) three other residues (Ser209, Thr297, Phe382) mapped by the Mapitope alone were also included. we tested the gp120 proteins for binding to m36 in the absence of sCD4. m36-gp120 interactions were determined by the program \"Protein Interface Analysis\" the interactions between m36 and the defined six gp120 residues were further determined by the program \"Protein Interface Analysis\" m36 is mediated by its trimeric Env complex composed of surface subunit gp120 and transmembrane subunit gp41[23]\u2013[26]. fusion machinery of gp41 activated thus bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion[27]\u2013[28]. gG1) and scFvs (20\u201330 kDa) could be more potent than their Fab formats. it was proposed that size-dependent neutralization could be due to steric restriction for antibody access to CD4i epitopes or the available space between the virus and the target cell surface after CD4 binding is not enough. m36-binding residues in gp120 are highly conserved among all HIV-1 isolates. the molecular architecture of HIV-1 Env \u201cspike\u201d and the associated conformational changes upon the binding of CD4 or antibodies. m36 targets the face of the bridging sheet critical for CD4 binding. the epitopes for 17b and X5 reside on the opposite face of the bridging sheet. however, it was not surprised by the identification of the receptor CD4-binding residues in gp120. the bacterial pellet was collected after centrifugation at 5,000 g for 10min. the supernatant was used for purification of m36 by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. the complex of the library is estimated to be 2109 which is sufficient to encode most peptide sequences. the eluted phages were amplified by infecting log-phage E. coli ER2738. the phages were then concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation. a 96-well microtiter plate was coated with m36 at 100 ng/well. mapitope is based on the assumption that the epitope is separated into several amino acid pairs (AAP) contributing for the binding to the antibodies. the entire set of peptides is enriched with AAP which mimic the genuine epitope. the algorithm searches for patches on the surface that are enriched with these pairs. the ligand poses with ZDOCK score above 11 were refined and analyzed using Rdock in DS 3.5. the top ranked ligand poses for gp120 were used for further study. the wild-type or mutated gp120, 293T cells were transfected by a specific plasmid. the cells were then cultivated for 12 h in Optim-DMEM medium. the 96-well microtiter wells were coated with 100 L of culture supernatant overnight and blocked for 2 h. the supernatant was used for purification of m36 by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. the complex library is estimated to be 2109 which is sufficient to encode most peptide sequences. the phage library (11011) was added into the coated wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. the selected phage clones were identified by single-strand DNA sequencing. the encoded peptide sequence (mimotope) were deduced. a 96-well microtiter plate was coated with m36 at 100 ng/well. mapitope then searches for patches on the surface that are enriched with these pairs. the algorithm seeks the pairs for a selected distance (D) value on the surface of the antigen and attempts to link them into clusters. the ligand poses with ZDOCK score above 11 were refined and analyzed using Rdock in DS 3.5. the top ranked ligand poses for gp120 were used for further study. wells were coated with 100 L of culture supernatant overnight and blocked for 2 h with 5% BSA in PBS, followed by five washes with PBS-T. the reactivity of soluble CD4 (2 g/mL) or HIVIG (1 g/mL) was then tested in the presence or absence of sCD4."}
