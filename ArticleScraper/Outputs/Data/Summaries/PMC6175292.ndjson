{"summary": "results show that data-informed models provided more precise forecasts of elimination timelines in each site compared to model-only simulations. data streams that included year 5 post-MDA microfilariae (mf) survey data reduced each model\u2019s uncertainty most compared to data streams containing only baseline and/or post-MDA 3 or longer-term mf survey data. the results further pinpoint the crucial need for longitudinal infection surveillance data for enhancing the precision and accuracy of model predictions of the intervention durations required to achieve parasite elimination in an endemic location. the power of these numerical simulation tools is based uniquely on their ability to appropriately incorporate the underlying nonlinear and multivariate processes of pathogen transmission in order to facilitate plausible predictions. sensitivity to forcing conditions and use of parameter estimates from settings that are different from the dynamical environment in which a model will be used for simulation imply strong limits will be imposed on the realized predictability of any given model for an application. if such uncertainties are ignored, the ability of parasite transmission models to form the scientific basis for management decisions can be severely undermined. new developments in longitudinal data assimilation can mitigate this problem of potential time variation of parameters via the recursive adjustment of the model. such sequential model calibration with time-varying data can also be useful for quantifying the utility of the next measurement in maximizing the information gained from all measurements together. a framework to investigate the value of using longitudinal LF infection data for improving predictions of the durations of drug interventions required for achieving LF elimination. we evaluated the usefulness of infection data collected in these sites at the time points proposed by the WHO monitoring framework in carrying out the present assessment. each site also provided these infection and MDA data at the time points pertinent to the existing WHO guidelines for conducting LF monitoring surveys during a MDA programme [44] each site also provided these infection and MDA data at the time points pertinent to the existing WHO guidelines for conducting LF monitoring surveys during a MDA programme. aDrug efficacy assumptions are listed as instantaneous mf kill rate/duration of sterilization in months [1] bTransmission in Kirare is by both Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes. models based on dominant species (Anopheles) were used in this study. the three existing LF models employed for this study included EPIFIL, a deterministic Monte Carlo population-based model, and LYMFASIM and TRANSFIL. all three models simulate LF transmission in a population by accounting for key biological and intervention processes such as impacts of vector density, the life cycle of the parasite. four data streams considered for investigating the value of information gained from each survey were respectively. scenario 1\u2014baseline mf prevalence data only, scenario 2\u2014baseline and post-MDA 3 mf prevalence data, and scenario 4\u2014baseline and post-MDA 5 mf prevalence data. a fifth model-only scenario was also considered where no site-specific data was introduced. lyMFASIM and TRANSFIL, by contrast, included all the data in each investigated stream together for selecting the best-fitting models for each time series. the posterior probability of each model is fixed for the whole simulation period, unlike the case in sequential data assimilation. intervention modelling Interventions were modelled by using the updated parameter vectors or models selected from each scenario for simulating the impact of the reported as well as hypothetical future MDA rounds. the observed MDA times, regimens, and coverages followed in each site were used (Table 1). data scenario or stream were compared in a site to infer which survey data are most useful for reducing model uncertainty. a permutation test using the differential Shannon entropy (DSE) was performed to statistically compare two entropy values. the weighted variance of the distributions of predicted timelines to achieve 1% mf prevalence was calculated to provide a measure of the precision of model predictions. a similar weighting scheme was also used to pool the timeline predictions of all three models for each data scenario. EPIFIL was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis investigating whether the trend in relative information gained by coupling the model with longitudinal data was dependent on the interventions simulated. the same series of simulations were completed with the extended MDA coverage beyond the observations given in Table 1 set here at 80% instead of 65% to represent an optimal control strategy. Statistical analyses Differences in predicted medians, weighted variances and entropy values between data scenarios, models and sites were statistically evaluated using Kruskall-Wallis tests for equal medians, F-tests for equality of variance, and DSE permutation tests. data from representative sites located in each of these major extant LF regions were assembled from the published literature for use in constraining the LF models employed in this study. bTransmission in Kirare is by both Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes. bTransmission in Kirare is by both Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes. models based on dominant species (Anopheles) were used in this study. the average total population coverage calculated as [average coverage]x[proportion of the population eligible for treatment] based on figures given in [46]. the three models structurally follow a basic coupled immigration-death model formulation. they differ in implementation (e.g. from individual to population-based) the total number of parameters included, and the way biological and intervention processes are mathematically incorporated and parameterized. a fifth model-only scenario (scenario 0) was also considered where no site-specific data was introduced. the first step for all models during the data assimilation exercises was to initially simulate the baseline infection conditions in each site. the number of parameters which were left free to be fitted to these data by each model range from 3 (LYMFASIM and TRANSFIL) to 21 (EPIFIL) each data series was based on using all relevant observations simultaneously in the fitting process [30, 53, 54]. the posterior probability of each model is fixed for the whole simulation period, unlike the case in sequential data assimilation. the final updated parameter estimates from each data stream were used to simulate the impact of observed MDA rounds. the observed MDA times, regimens, and coverages followed in each site were used. MDA simulations were extended for a total of 50 annual rounds in each site at an assumed coverage of 65%. the drug-induced mf kill rate and the duration of adult worm sterilization were fixed among the models. DSE is defined as |H1\u2014H2| where H1 was calculated from the distribution of timelines to achieve 1% mf for a given scenario, y1, and H2 was calculated from the distribution of timelines to achieve 1% mf for a different scenario, y2. the list of elements in y1 and y2 were combined into a single list of size y1 + y2 and the list was permuted 20,000 times. weighted variance of distributions of predicted timelines to achieve 1% mf prevalence was calculated to provide a measure of the precision of model predictions in addition to the entropy measure, H. a similar weighting scheme was also used to pool the timeline predictions of all three models for each data scenario. analyses EPIFIL was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine if the trend in relative information gained by coupling the model with longitudinal data was dependent on the interventions simulated. timelines to reach 1% mf prevalence in each fitting scenario were calculated and used to determine which data stream provided the model with the greatest gain of information. results Assessing the benefit of longitudinal monitoring data for modelling LF elimination Here, our goal was twofold. first, to determine if data are required to improve predictability of intervention forecasts by the present LF models in comparison with the use of theoretical models only. second, to evaluate the benefit of using different longitudinal streams of mf survey data for calibrating the three models in order to determine which data stream was most informative. as much as 92% to 96% reductions in prediction variance were achieved by these scenarios in comparison to model-only predictions between the three models. the best constraining data stream for each combination of site and model also produced the lowest range in predictions of the numbers of years of annual MDA required to achieve the 1% mf prevalence in each site. weighted variance (significance*) Entropy (significance*) Relative information gained by data (%)+ EPIFIL Kirare 0 865 9 (6\u201319)1,2,3,4 14.711,2,3,4 3.511,2,3,4 - 1 829 8 (6\u201317)0,2,3,4 10.370,3,4 3.130,2,3,4 12.06 2 117 14 (11\u201321)0,1,1,2,3,4 3.130,2,3,4 12.06 2 LYMFASIM Kirare 0 6471 11 (7\u201328)1,2 35.311,2,3,4 4.192,3,4 - 1 901 10 (6\u201334)0,2 50.910,2,3,4 4.202,3,4 -0.24 2 363 13 (10\u201320)0,1,3,4 9.500,3,4 3.310,1,3,4 21.00 3 224 11 (9\u201314)2 1.870,1,2 2.390,1,2 42.96 4 245 11 3,4 14.16 2 6414 13 (10\u201326)0,1,3,4 22.260,1,3,4 3.500,1,3,4 24.89 3 2108 11 (9\u201315)2 3.190,1,2,4 2.560,1,2,4 45.06 4 5405 11 (9\u201315)2 2.830,1,2,3 2.540.1,2,3 45.49 Alagramam 0 9666 15 (9\u201342)2,3,4 72.861,2,3,4 4.601,2,3,4 scenario 3: baseline + post-MDA 3 + post-MDA 5 data; scenario 4: baseline + post-MDA 5 data; scenario 4: baseline + post-MDA 5 data; scenario 4: baseline + post-MDA 5 data *For each pair of scenarios, pairwise F-tests for equality of variance were performed to compare the weighted variance. pairwise Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for equal distributions were performed on the results from each model to evaluate whether updating the models with sequential data changed the distribution of predictions.

Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison tests were performed to compare medians. model-only predictions made in the absence of data (scenario 0) showed the highest prediction uncertainty, highlighting the need for data to improve the predictive performance of the present models. the results also show that data streams including post-MDA 5 mf survey data (scenarios 3 and 4) reduced model uncertainty most compared to data streams containing only baseline and post-MDA 3 mf survey data (scenarios 1 and 2). the best constraining data stream for each combination of site and model also produced as expected the lowest range in predictions of the numbers of years of annual MDA required to achieve 1% mf prevalence in each site. the widest ranges estimated for model-only predictions (scenario 0) and the shorter data streams (scenario 1).

LF models constrained by coupling to year 5 post-MDA data can provide the best predictions of timelines for meeting the 1% mf prevalence threshold in a site. we expect that data useful for performing these studies at scale may be available at the sentinel site level in the countries carrying out the current WHO-led monitoring programme."}
