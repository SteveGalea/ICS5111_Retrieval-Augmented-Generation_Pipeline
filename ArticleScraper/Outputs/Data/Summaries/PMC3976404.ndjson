{"summary": "chemokines regulate a wide range of biological processes by recruiting leukocytes to the site of injury and infection to embryogenesis, wound healing, metastasis, innate immunity and angiogenesis. in humans, two types of high-affinity chemokines receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, belonging to the GPCR superfamily, have been identified to interact with the chemokine CXCL-8. the effect of charge-charge interaction plays a crucial role in the binding of CXCL-8 with CXCR1 [12]\u2013[15]. mutagenesis studies on CXCR1 have demonstrated that charged residues near the third and fourth extracellular loops are crucial for association [13], [15], [16]. the structure of the chemokine receptor CXCR1 (residues 29324) has been recently determined by Opella et al. but the structure of the N-terminal region of CXCR1 is still not resolved. the reason for increased binding affinity as a monomer is not known. bovine rhodopsin structure was used as a template for homology modeling the receptor CXCR1 or CXCR2 [14], [28]. previous studies from Opella et al. also showed that as CXCL-8 comes closer to bind with CXCR1, the N-terminal domain of CXCR1 is translated to extracellular loops of CXCR1. ligands (monomeric and dimeric CXCL-8) binding to receptor CXCR1 (wild-type and mutated) were determined by using the \u2018dock proteins protocol\u2019 from Discovery Studio 3.0 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) the 'dock proteins protocol' was used to conduct the rigid-body docking of two protein structures as well as clustering the poses according to the ligand position. the obtained complex configurations were ranked based on a linear-weighted sum of van der Waals energies, electrostatics and desolvation energies. each ZDOCK run generates 3600 poses and are clustered into a maximum of 50 groups. each ZDOCK run generates 3600 poses, and are clustered into a maximum of 50 groups. three independent replicates of each system starting from different initial random numbers are performed to confirm the simulation results. ligands, receptor, complex atoms, POPC lipids and total atoms of the simulation box are listed herein. the temperature was gradually increased from 100 K to 200 K and 310 K. at 310 K the restraints kept on the complex structure via the force constant k, were released in 3 steps. each step was run for 2.0 ns. structure modeling Since the N- and C-terminal domains of rhodopsin-like GPCRs are known to be highly flexible, only the bovine rhodopsin structure was resolved. some, such as CXCR1 (PDB code: 2LNL), 2AR (PDB code: 2RH1), A2AR (PDB code: 3EML) and CXCR4 (PDB code: 3ODU) lacked N- or C-termin lipid bilayer (160181 diester PC, 1-palmitory-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-chloine) for 50 ns MD simulation. initial favorable sites for ligands (monomeric and dimeric CXCL-8) binding were determined by using the \u2018dock proteins protocol\u2019 from Discovery Studio 3.0 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) each ZDOCK run generates 3600 poses, and are clustered into a maximum of 50 groups. each ZDOCK run generates 3600 poses and are clustered into a maximum of 50 groups. 61 Na+ and 75 Cl ions were added to neutralize the whole system. the patches consisted of the complex structure (4305 atoms), 238 POPC lipids, and 20987 SPC-water molecules. all simulations are run for 300 ns. mesh Ewald (PME) summation algorithm with grid dimensions of 0.12 nm and interpolation order 4. lennard-Jones and short-range Coulomb interactions were cut off at 1.4 and 1.0 nm respectively. the system was run for 500 ps for each temperature. sequences of the N-terminal part (residue 228) and the C-terminal part (residue 325347) of human receptor CXCR1 and bovine rhodopsin (PDB: 1U19) are 18.7% identical and 41.8% similar. both, the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of CXCR1 are long loops in random coil conformations with more negatively charged residues. the RMSF values fluctuate between 0.39 and 0.80 nm in the N-terminal loop due to exposure to the solvent outside the membrane. the average RMSD values of three replicates fluctuate in the range of 0.41 nm to 0.53 nm when leveling off after 150 ns. all RMSD values for CXCR1 are leveling off after 200 ns at 0.32 to 0.42 nm. RMSD and RMSF values of CXCL-8 at various ligands binding systems during MD simulations. IC-loops of CXCR1 fluctuate higher than 0.3 nm due to the exposure to the membrane exterior. the RMSF values of C-terminal domain (residues 238) of CXCR1 for the CXCR1_mut system are much higher than those for other simulations. initial binding position is near the N-loop and the C-terminal -helix of CXCL-8. binding orientation of CXCL-8 changes and moves away from the receptor CXCR1_mut during the simulation. this finding implies that CXCL-8 does not prefer binding with CXCR1_mut. the orientation of CXCL-8 binding to mutated CXCR1 fluctuates and decreases from 126.48\u00b07.79 (0\u201350 ns) to 109.57\u00b05.32 (250\u2013300 ns) the orientation angle distribution of ligands binding with the receptor is defined as the angle between the unit vector normal to the membrane and the unit vector along the dipole of ligand. surface charge distribution of the binding complex structures is shown in Figure 5A. only one simulation of each system is taken to analyze surface charge and lipophilicity distribution. the flexible N-terminal domain of CXCR1 forming a negatively charged pocket and EC-loops of CXCR1 forming a positively charged region stabilize the binding. the complex structure is represented as ribbon structure with the N-loop of the ligand colored green, the N-terminus of receptor colored pink, and the EC-loops colored yellow. the rotation and translation of dimeric CXCL-8 allow the hydrophobic and positively charged regions to be exposed to the N-terminal domain of the receptor. the ELR motif of the N-terminus of dimeric CXCL-8 also turns to approach the N-terminal domain of CXCR1. the CXCR1_mut shows less positively charged at the EC-loops compare to that of the wild-type CXCR1 at the initial simulation time. the hydrophobic interaction between the N-terminal domain of CXCR1 and the N-loop of CXCL-8 may play an important role in the binding process. the complex structure is represented as ribbon structure with the N-loop of the ligand colored green, the N-terminus of receptor colored pink, and the EC-loops colored yellow. the hydrophobic region of N-terminal domain of CXCR1_mut contacts with the hydrophilic part of CXCL-8 (between the N-loop and C-terminal helix), instead of with the hydrophobic pocket of CXCL-8 found in wild-type CXCR1. less hydrophobic contact between them suggests that hydrophobic interaction may be not crucial in process of CXCL-8 binding with CXCR1_mut. the distances for R47-D14, K64-E35, and R60-E275 also vibrate and gradually approach the binding site of CXCR1 from 0.65 nm to 0.59 nm, 0.51 nm to 0.34 nm, and 1.59 nm to 0.88 nm respectively. the distances between the charged groups of ligand and receptor forming electrostatic interactions are shown in Figure 7B. human receptor CXCR1 and bovine rhodopsin (PDB: 1U19) are 18.7% identical and 41.8% similar. the modeled full-length receptor CXCR1 composed of the structure from the NMR experiment (residues 29324) [27], the N-terminal (residues 228) and C-terminal (residues 325347) domains from homology modeling embedded into a POPC lipid bi the modeled full-length receptor CXCR1 is embedded into a POPC lipid bilayer for 50 ns MD simulations. the structure is composed of the structure from the NMR experiment (residues 29324, red color), the N-terminal (residues 228) and C-terminal (residues 325347) domains. the locations of the N-loop, 30s-loop, 3, -helix, and C-terminus are marked in the figure. the values of the N-loop (residues 120) of both, the monomeric and dimeric CXCL-8 interacting with wild-type CXCR1 are higher RMSF (over 0.7 nm) than those for the protein interaction with mutated CXCR1. XCR1_mut system are much higher than those for the other two simulations. Orientation of ligands binding with CXCR1 receptor All the binding orientations of replicates for the various simulations are shown in Figure 3 and S3. ligands are colored with green, receptors are colored with red, and phosphorous and nitrogen atoms are colored with pink and blue. the direction of dipole moment of ligand is represented as blue arrow. the distance between the two layers is represented as the thickness of the membrane. the orientation angle of the bound ligand is defined as the angle between the unit vector normal to the membrane and the unit vector along the dipole of ligand. error bars of the curves are omitted for figure clarity. the end region of N-loop (residues 1420) of CXCL-8 binds with the groove region of N-terminal domain (residues 2127) of CXCR1. positively charged residues of CXCL-8, such as K15, K20, R60, and K64, form a positive electrostatic field near the binding groove. negatively charged residues of CXCR1 form a strong negative electrostatic field around the binding groove monomeric CXCL-8 binding with CXCR1 at the initial time. the groove of N-terminal domain of dimeric CXCL-8 is negatively charged to attract the positively charged N-loop and the C-terminal helix of dimeric CXCL-8. mut shows less positively charged at the EC-loops compared to that of the wild-type CXCR1 at the initial simulation time. CXCL-8 does not prefer to bind to the groove of the N-terminal domain of CXCR1_mut. after the 300 ns, the N-terminal domain of CXCR1_mut becomes more negatively charged than that at the initial simulation time. XCR1 and the N-loop of CXCL-8 may play an important role in the binding process. the complex structure is represented as ribbon structure with the N-loop of the ligand colored green, the N-terminus of receptor colored pink, and the EC-loops colored yellow. blue color represents the hydrophilic part while green color represents the hydrophobic part. less hydrophobic contact between the charge groups suggests that hydrophobic interaction may be not crucial in the process of CXCL-8 binding with CXCR1_mut. the average distance between the charged groups of selected acidic and basic residues of CXCL-8 and CXCR1 forming electrostatic interaction for the three replicates of each system is calculated with a function of time shown in Figure 7. some positively charged residues of the N-loop of CXCL-8 approach to the negatively charged residues of the N-terminus of CXCR1 by electrostatic interactions. distances are the average values with the function of time for three replicates of the system monomeric CXCL-8 binding to CXCR1. the RMSD seemed to develop slightly different, which is very minor to the simulations. the enough long time MD simulations are able to represent statistical significance. the predicted initial binding site is consistent with previous experimental results. hydrophobic interaction mediate binding of CXCL-8 to the receptor N-terminal domain of CXCR1. the binding site for CXCL-8 with CXCR1 seems highly conserved among different chemokines. only three of them, R199A, R203A, and D265A (CXCR1_mut), showed total loss of Ca2+ flux compared to wild-type CXCR1. the remaining three, R269A, E275A, and R280A, showed reduced Ca2+ flux compared to wild-type CXCR1. a two-site mechanism of CXCL-8 interaction with CXCR1 has been proposed that CXCR1 binding involves two interactions. in the first step, the N-loop residues of CXCL-8 bind to the N-terminal domain of receptor CXCR1 leading to Site-I binding, dominated by electrostatic interactions. the N-loop residues of CXCL-8 bind to the N-terminus of receptor CXCR1 leading to Site-I binding. the site-I binding is dominated mainly by the electrostatic interactions. the locations of the N-loop, 30s-loop, 3, -helix, and C-terminus are marked in the figure. the location of the terminus (N-ter, C-ter), TM1, IC-loops, and EC-loops are marked in the figure. the complex structure is represented as ribbon structure with the N-loop of the ligand colored green, the N-terminus of receptor colored pink, and the EC-loops colored yellow. the complex structure is represented as ribbon structure with the ligand colored green, the N-terminus of receptor colored pink, and the EC-loops colored yellow. as sticks; black font is for receptor, while red font is for ligand."}
