{"summary": "all suspected cases of influenza A (H5N1) are reported through a national surveillance system to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). the study was part of an ongoing public health outbreak investigation and determined by the ministry of health to be exempt from institutional review board assessment. the study was part of an ongoing public health outbreak investigation. the 6 urban cases were distributed sporadically in 6 large cities of 5 provinces. none was associated with confirmed H5N1 subtype poultry outbreaks or sick and dead poultry. ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a life-threatening condition in which inflammation of the lungs and accumulation of fluid in the air sacs lead to low blood oxygen levels. five of the 6 urban case-patients had no direct contact with poultry. one patient prepared freshly slaughtered chicken that she purchased for cooking at a live (wet) poultry market. 3 32-year-old man, previously healthy, quit his job 1 mo before illness onset. he spent most of his time in a sauce store that was 5 m away from stalls where poultry were slaughtered and sold. no poultry were kept in his home or neighborhood. all 6 patients had no known contact with other confirmed influenza A (H5N1) patients. 640 people were followed up for medical observation for 2 weeks. none of the 6 cases-patients had known direct contact with poultry. case-patient 6 could have been exposed to the virus at home when his wife prepared a freshly slaughtered chicken. no epidemiologic evidence suggested human-to-human transmission of influenza A (H5N1) associated with urban patients. the most statistically significant influenza risk factor was visiting a live poultry market the week before illness onset. tracheal, cloacal, and blood specimens from poultry should be tested. swabs of fecal material, cages, and other potentially contaminated surfaces should be tested."}
