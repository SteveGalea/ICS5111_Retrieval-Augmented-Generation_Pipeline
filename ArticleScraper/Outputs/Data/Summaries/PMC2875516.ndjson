{"summary": "the human host immune response to nvH1N1 infection is unknown at this time. nvH1N1 infection induces a typical innate response in both mild and severe cases. but severe infections with respiratory involvement are characterized by an early secretion of Th17 and Th1 cytokines. authors found IL-15, IL-12p70, and IL-6 to be particularly elevated following severe nvH1N1 infection. these three cytokines mediate both antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses. previous studies had already reported high levels of specific proinflammatory cytokines in severe SARS coronavirus, H5N1 and respiratory syncytial virus infections. the authors correctly bring up the fact that a better understanding of the immune response to the new H1N1 virus could contribute to the design of more effective therapies. the results of this study reinforce the importance of early treatment with antivirals in those patients with high risk factors, such as pregnancy, asthma, and obesity. /00101)"}
