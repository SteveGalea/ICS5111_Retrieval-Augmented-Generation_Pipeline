{"summary": "platelets are sentinel markers of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. experiments were designed to evaluate time course and mechanism of direct interactions between platelets and leukocytes following acute activation of TLR4 by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. acute and chronic infection is associated with increased risk of thrombosis and atherosclerotic disease. acute and chronic infection, especially that induced by Gram-negative bacteria, is associated with increased risk of thrombosis. platelets may represent one of the first blood borne elements to react to LPS stimulation. platelet reactivity via TLR4 seems to occur prior to sustained changes in circulating levels of cytokines. MV are cell membrane-derived vesicles ranging in size from 0.1 to 1 micron in diameter. the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that acute exposure to a sentinel dose of LPS would induce MV production and exchange of specific proteins/receptors between platelets and leukocytes via TLR4 activation. MV derived from platelets and/or leukocytes were distinguished by cell specific fluorescein conjugated antigen staining. mouse thrombin and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA. cellular origin of antigens was determined using platelet (rat anti-mouse CD41 antibody) and total leukocyte (rat anti-mouse CD45 antibody) membrane specific fluorescein conjugated Phycoerythrin (PE)- or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- antibodies. whole blood from each aliquot was diluted into 990 L (1100) HEPES/HANKS' buffer. the remaining blood was used to prepare platelet free plasma for MV analysis. blood was collected seven days after the injection. percentages of positive events were calculated above the set threshold from isotype control antibody. a blood sample from each mouse was divided into two 100 l aliquots. one was diluted with 100 l saline (control), the other with 100 l saline containing LPS (500 ng/ml final concentration). diluted (1100) whole blood (100 L) was incubated with PE-conjugated platelet- and leukocyte-specific antibodies (CD41 and CD45, respectively), or separately with annexin V-FITC (binding to phosphatidylserine) for 30 min, after which 1% paraformaldehyde (400 L) was added. MV were defined as events of 1 m in diameter using size calibration beads. analysis of TLR4 intracellular signaling pathway LPS stimulated TLR4 signaling was analyzed by introducing myD88 or TRIF inhibitory peptides. pinh-TRIF (100 M which binds to TRIF to block TLR4 stimulated TRIF signaling) aliquot was diluted for analysis by flow cytometry to measure cellular origin of MV and platelet positive leukocyte antigen. data analyses Data are presented as percentage or fold increase from the paired vehicle and LPS treated blood samples at each time point. mouse thrombin and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA. cellular origin of antigens was determined using platelet (rat anti-mouse CD41 antibody) and total leukocyte (rat anti-mouse CD45 antibody) membrane specific fluorescein conjugated Phycoerythrin (PE)- or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- antibodies by flow cytometry. blood was used to prepare platelet free plasma (PFP) for MV analysis. male mice (8 month of age) received a single injection of LPS. flow cytometry was triggered with total leukocyte marker CD45-conjugated with allophycocyanin (CD45-APC) a 20 l aliquot was removed from each sample, diluted in 20 l 2% paraformaldehyde and incubated for an additional 30 min. each sample was then diluted in 250 l PBS (0.1 m pore membrane-filtered) and centrifuged at 45g for 12 min. plates were then imaged in dark-field mode using a light microscope. interactions between cell (platelets or leukocytes) and cell-derived MV and PS expression on both platelets and leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. plates were identified by forward and side scatter and with fluorescein conjugated CD41 antibody until 20,000 events gated for each sample. MV were defined as events of 1 m in diameter using size calibration beads and positive for annexin-V and platelet- and leukocyte-specific markers. analysis of TLR4 intracellular signaling pathway LPS stimulated TLR4 signaling was analyzed by introducing myD88 or TRIF inhibitory peptides. aliquot was diluted for analysis by flow cytometry to measure cellular origin of MV and platelet positive leukocyte antigen. all data are presented as mean SEM; n = number of animals used in each experiment. paired or unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. plasma MV (counts/ L plasma) WT Platelet 4.161.54 (n = 7) 33.4210.24 (n = 7) 2.511.01 (n = 4) 49.6412.27 (n = 6) WT Leukocyte 0.100.05 (n = 7)* 22.212.64 (n = 7) 0.080.05 (n = 4)* 27.142.81 (n = 4) dTLR4 Platelet 3.500.87 (n = 7) 25.0 numbers of leukocytes positive for platelet-specific antigen did not increase significantly in either WT or dTLR4 mice. in blood from WT mice, the percentage of platelets positive for leukocyte antigen (CD45) was reduced significantly and to the same extent by MyD88 and TRIF. sub-classes of leukocytes and apoptotic bodies expressing platelet antigen derived from blood of male mice 7 days after a single intravenous injection of LPS (25 ng/gm body weight) apoptotic bodies stained positive for platelet antigen. platelets were incubated with LPS (bottom panels, inset shows platelets with pseudopodia) each bar represents 5 m. similar results were observed with blood from two additional animals. number of platelets positive for leukocyte-specific antigen (CD45-APC) increased significantly in blood of WT mice, but not dTLR4 mice. percentage of platelets positive for leukocyte antigen (CD45) was reduced significantly and to the same extent by MyD88 and TRIF. granulocytes and monocytes were significantly positive for platelet antigen seven days after a single intravenous injection of a sentinel dose of LPS. compared to leukocytes obtained from animals treated with vehicle or a week before LPS injection in the same mouse, granulocytes and monocytes were significantly positive for platelet antigen. MV derived from neutrophils induced platelet activation by binding to platelets GP1b via activated M2 on MV. platelet-derived MV mediate leukocyte-leukocyte aggregation, activate leukocyte phagocytic properties and amplify leukocyte-mediated tissue injury in thrombotic and inflammatory disorders. leukocyte antigen expression on platelet was reduced by inhibition of myD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways alone or in combination. a single TLR4 sentinel dose injection of LPS shortened platelet half-life and increased platelet production without increases in cytokine production within 3 hours of stimulation. MV/exchange of cell-specific antigens in cells derived from whole blood incubated with LPS. diluted blood increased the number of MV from platelets and those positive for tissue factor but only after four hours of incubation. no evaluation was performed relative to interaction with leukocytes. platelet-leukocyte interactions require leukocyte antigen. peptide inhibitors of TLR4 signaling molecules blocked the interaction. effects of LPS stimulation are sustained at least 7 days past the initial LPS exposure."}
