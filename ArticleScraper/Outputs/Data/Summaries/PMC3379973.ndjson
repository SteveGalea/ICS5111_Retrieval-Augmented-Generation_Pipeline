{"summary": "the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) has caused numerous cases of severe disease and death in humans [2]\u2013[5] an influenza pandemic could ensue if this virus developed the capacity to spread easily among humans [3]\u2013[5]. only two epitopes from the virus are included in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resources (IEDB) peptides that bind to MHC class I molecules are usually octamers or nonamers, where only one or a few residues can interact with polymorphic residues in the groove. these residues are known as anchor residues when they are found in an anchoring position [12]\u2013[15]. peptide-binding motifs can be used to predict antigen peptides presented by chicken MHC class I molecules. no T cell epitope of H5N1 AIV NP has yet been identified in the chicken. NP89\u201397 and NP198\u2013206 were shown to be T cell epitopes of H5 AIV NP by analysing the CD8+ T cell proliferation and the interferon expression. chicken lymphocytes collected from immunized chickens were housed in HEPA-filtered isolators. ethical statement chicken lymphocytes were housed in HEPA-filtered isolators. 64\u201371 (ERMVLSAF), and the unrelated peptide N71\u201378 (WRRQARYK) [26]. predicted T cell epitopes in H5N1 AIV NP for four chicken haplotypes. peptides in bold font were synthesized to test their T cell responses in vitro. peptides 9 of 25 were synthesized and used to stimulate splenic lymphocytes collected from NP DNA vaccine-immunized SPF chickens. chicken MHC class I molecule-restricted potential T-cell epitopes were confirmed by detecting of CD8+ T cell proliferation and interferon (IFN-) expression. the amino acid sequences of chicken MHC class I molecules belonging to the B4, B12, B15, and B19 haplotypes were obtained from GenBank (B4, GenBankID: CAK54654.1; B12, GenBankID: BAG69386.1; and B19, GenBankID: the NP protein sequence of H5N1 isolate A/Goose/Gongdong/1/96 (H5N1) was downloaded from the UniProt database (UniProtID: NCAP_I96A0) and automatically parsed as octapeptides or nonapeptides using a computer program. the structures of the octapeptides and nonapeptides were modelled using DS2.5. the RMSD was calculated for each modelled pair and crystal structure pair. the docking program was used to dock the octapeptides and nonapeptides to their corresponding MHC class I molecule receptors. extinctions measured at 490 nm with a micro ELISA reader. all eight pCAGGS-NP immunized chickens were killed by cardiac puncture blood collection. cell suspensions were overlaid onto histopaque 1077 density gradient medium. Detection of chicken IFN- Splenic lymphocytes collected form the 8 vaccinated chickens were plated at 106 well\u20131 in 24-well plates with RPMI 1640 medium. cell culture supernatants were then analysed to determine the chicken IFN- using chicken IFN- CytoSetsTM. pCAGGS-NP was cloned into the plasmid vector pCAGGS. the synthetic optiNP was cloned into the plasmid vector pCAGGS. expression of NP protein from the plasmid was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay. xxxxExxE 7\u201314 KRSYEQME 11.73 134.66178 xExxExxx 10\u201317 YEQMETGG 12.63 124.61178 xxxxxxxxxE 66\u201373 MVLSAFDE 16.23 127.08578 xxxxDxxx 124\u2013131 NNGEDATA 12.46 131.64478 xExxxxxxx 126\u2013133 GEDATAGL 11.11 132.12278 xDxxxxxx 127 the peptides in bold font were synthesized to test their T cell responses in vitro. peptides 9 of 25 were synthesized and used to stimulate splenic lymphocytes collected from NP DNA vaccine-immunized SPF chickens. BLASTP was performed to search for homologous proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the BlOSUM62 Scoring Matrix optimized with a gap penalty of 11 and a gap extension penalty of 1. the MODELER [27] program was then executed in DS2.5 to construct the 3D structures of chicken MHC class I molecules for the four haplotypes. a computer program was developed in our laboratory based on the peptide-binding motifs of chicken MHC class I molecules belonging to the B4, B12, B15, and B19 haplotypes. the motifs were as follows: B4: x-(D or E)-x-x-x-x-E; B12: x-x-x-x-V and x-x-x-X-V. the parameters of the threshold and bloat values of the program were optimized to 0.51 and 1. Peptides with a higher docking score and rational conformation were predicted as candidate T cell epitopes for each haplotype. 13 three-week-old SPF chickens were separated into two groups, eight were immunized twice with 100 g of pCAGGS-NP in their leg muscle at three-week intervals. all eight pCAGGS-NP immunized chickens were killed by cardiac puncture blood collection. cell suspensions were overlaid onto histopaque 1077 density gradient medium. cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 20 min at 18\u00b0C. the extinctions were measured at 450 nm with a micro ELISA reader. for each peptide, two copies of splenic lymphocytes from one chicken were treated and analysed simultaneously. 3BEV has been crystallized to a high resolution of 2.1. it was selected as the template for modelling the four protein structures. the initial crude homology models were built using MODELLER. the pairwise root mean-square differences between the structures of 3BEV and the structures of the B4, B12, B15, and B19 haplotypes are very small (0.23, 0.20, 0.24, and 0.30 respectively). specific residues in the binding groove have an essential role in peptide binding. the presence of Glu8 or Asp8 as major residues in the C-terminal position of the B4 motif is unprecedented. there are no previous mammalian examples of negatively-charged residues in the C-terminal anchor position. maps and data were generated using SYBYL 8.1. the maps and data were generated using SYBYL 8.1. the maps and data were generated using SYBYL 8.1. all the peptides were extracted from the complexes, before they were re-docked to the corresponding MHC molecules using Surflex-Dock. the docking scores were all greater than 8.0 (Table 2).

CD8+ T cell proliferation in cells stimulated with NP89\u201397 and NP198\u2013206 was significant higher than cells stimulated with unrelated peptide N71\u201378. the control was spleen cells that received no peptide stimulation. 3BEV has been crystallized to a high resolution of 2.1. it was selected as the template for modelling the four protein structures. the initial crude homology models were built using MODELLER and refined using modules for loop refinement. mean-square differences between the C positions of 3BEV and the structures of the B4, B12, B15, and B19 haplotypes are very small (0.23, 0.20, 0.24, and 0.30 respectively). specific residues in the binding groove have an essential role in peptide binding. the presence of Glu8 or Asp8 as major residues in the C-terminal anchor position of the B4 motif is unprecedented. there is an anchor residue in the central cavity region corresponding to pocket C in B12 and B4. the peptide-binding grooves of the B4 haplotype are highly lipophilic in all models. the B pockets of the peptide-binding grooves are more flexible than the F pockets in all structures. the deep blue colour represents the most negative potential, whereas the deep brown colour represents the most positive potential. compared with the initial complexes, the average RMSD was 1.8 and the docking scores were all greater than 8.0 (Table 2). Docking was performed with v-src C-tail peptide517\u2013524 (LPACVLEV) and an identified T cell epitope [23] to the modelled B12 MHC class I molecule. 1LK2 19.73 1.036 H-2Kb 1NAM 21.5 1.108 H-2Kb 1MO5 25 0.796 HLA-B*0801 1Q94 18.27 1.447 HLA-A*1101 1RKO 15.42 0.892 H-2Kb 1UXW 24.99 1.63 HLA-B*2709 1QEW 21.86 1.195 HLA-B*3501 1WBY 17.87 2.596 H-2Db 1WBZ 15.08 a total of 25 potential T cell epitope peptides were predicted (eight for B4, six for B12, two for B15, and seven for B19) nine peptides, which marked in bold in table 1, were selected to test their T cell responses in vitro. a significant NP antibody increase was detected two weeks post-immunization in chickens immunized with pCAGGS-NP compared to chickens in control group. ten synthetic peptides (Top nine of the 25 predicted peptides from NP and one unrelated peptide) were incubated with sensitized splenic lymphocytes for 5 d.

NP89\u201397 and NP198\u2013206 are the first two T cell epitopes to be identified in the H5 AIV NP in chickens of certain haplotypes. the only chicken MHC class I molecule structure that has been solved is the B21 haplotype [18]. therefore, there is little information available on the structure and function of chicken MHC class I molecules. RRSGAAGAAVK are derived from the H3N2, H3N2, and H1N1 respectively. NP89\u201397 (PKKTGGPIY) and NP362\u2013369 (GVQIASNE) are completely conserved in all influenza virus strains. some potential epitopes were also shared by several haplotypes. NP89\u201397 (PKKTGGPIY) and NP198\u2013206 (KRGINDRNF) induced significant T cell responses in splenic lymphocytes. NP89\u201397 was predicted to be a T cell epitope for both B15 and B19. NP198\u2013206 also belonged to the B19 haplotype. this further verifies the significance of this epitope."}
