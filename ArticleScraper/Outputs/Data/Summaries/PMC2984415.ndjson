{"summary": "WNV-associated encephalitis (WNVE) is characterized by increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators, glial cells activation and eventual loss of neurons. the role of neurons and pathological consequences of pro-inflammatory cytokines released as a result of WNV infection is unclear. cytokines released from neurons also mediate the activation of astrocytes. west Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes lethal encephalitis has emerged as a significant cause of viral encephalitis in the united states. neuronal death in WNV is a complex process and involves activation of caspase3/9 dependent apoptosis via both, extrinsic as well as the intrinsic pathways. it is proposed that apoptotic neuronal death can be a result of both, direct virus infection or bystander injury caused by cytotoxic factors released by non-neuronal cells. the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF- in neuropathogenesis following WNV infection remains obscure. microglia and astrocytes are classically believed to serve as the predominant source of these cytokines in the CNS. this may act as a central processor of inflammation by releasing pro-inflammatory molecules. the virus was adsorbed for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after incubation, the virus was removed by washing twice with PBS. the supernatant and cells were collected at 2 h and from days 1 to 4. WNV-infected human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH, with specific neutralizing antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines. the cells were replenished with either fresh media only or media containing specific neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 (Sigma), -6, -8 or TNF- (R&D Systems) the concentration of IL and TNF- antibodies employed in this study was 4 and 10 g/mL, respectively. HBCA cells grown in 96-well plates were treated as above. ELISA measured levels of IL-1, -6, -8 and TNF- in the cell supernatant. the TUNEL-positive cells for each group were obtained by counting total 2,500 to 3,500 cells from nine different fields for each coverslip from three independent experiments. ocal Pascal equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope, equipped with appropriate fluorescence filters and objectives. unpaired student t-test using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad software) was used to calculate p values. differences of P 0.05 were considered significant. cells were replenished with either fresh media only or media containing specific neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 (Sigma), -6, -8 or TNF- (R&D Systems) the concentration of IL and TNF- antibodies employed in this study was 4 and 10 g/mL, respectively. cell viability was assessed at days 1 to 3 after infection using cellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay. cytotoxicity assay Supernatant derived from SK-N-SH cells cultured for 48 h was UV-inactivated in order to inactivate WNV. HBCA cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated for 6 h with 500 L of the above UV-inactivated supernatant from mock- or WNV (MOI-1) -infected SK-N-SH cells. after 6 h of treatment with UV-inactivated superna apoptosis was detected by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Confocal Pascal. cells were washed twice with 1 PBS and then counterstained with bisbenzidine (1 ng/mL) for negative control, cells were processed using a reaction mixture that did not contain TdT. cells were triedpsinized at 48 h and washed twice with cold PBS. cells were then incubated first with monoclonal human anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:1000, DakoCytomation) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and then with Alexa Fluor 546 conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000, Invitrogen) for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in dark. WNV can infect and induce apoptosis in human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH. the kinetics of virus replication was similar to previously observed. at day 1 there was no change in the cell viability of WNV-infected cells. at day 2 after infection, the cell death increased to 14%, 25%, 26%, and 49% respectively. this drastic increase in the cell death correlates well with the sharp increase in virus titers at same time points. IL-18 expression did not change at any time point. a robust up-regulation was detected in the expressions of IL-1, -6, -8, and TNF- at days 2 and 3 after infection with both MOI-1 and -5 of WNV. maximum increase in the expression of IL-1, -6 and TNF- mRNA was detected at day 2 in both MOI-1- and -5-infected cells. levels of IL-1, -6, -8, and TNF- in culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. the data expressed are the mean concentration (pg/ml) SD of the amount of IL-1, -6, -8 or TNF- in the supernatant. incubation of cells with IL-1-neutralizing antibody resulted in significant (p 0.05) reduction of neurotoxic effects of WNV infection. cell toxicity decreased by 50% at day 2 after infection in SK-N-SH cells. apoptosis induced by WNV was significantly attenuated in the presence of anti-IL-1 (iii) and anti-TNF- (v). apoptosis induced by WNV was significantly attenuated in the presence of anti-IL-1 (iii) and anti-TNF- (v). TUNEL-positive cells reduced significantly in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 and TNF- (13.5%) at day 2 after infection. the intensity of GFAP fluorescence increased significantly (p 0.05) in HBCA cells treated with SK-N-SH. UV-inactivated infected SK-N-SH cells supernatant (68.1%) compared to those treated with UV-inactivated mock-infected SK-N-SH cells supernatant (46.9%) at 48 h after treatment. cytokines released in nave HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant from SK-N-SH cells were not significantly high at 24 hr after infection and a sharp increase occurred only at 48 UV-inactivated supernatant from SK-N-SH activates astrocytes and induces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. GFAP expression increased significantly in HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant from infected SK-N-SH cells. Nave HBCA cells were either mock-treated or infected with UV-inactivated WNV or WNV at MOI-1 or treated with UV-inactivated supernatant. levels of IL-1, -6, -8, and TNF- in treated HBCA culture supernatants significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines within 24 h. at day 3, virus titer reached its peak of nine-log10 PFU/mL in MOI-5 infected cells, which declined slightly at day 4. kinetics of virus replication was similar to previously observed WNV infection of primary neurons and cell lines such as LAN-2. treated cells were used as positive control (v). the images depict representative results of three independent experiments. WNV induces apoptosis of human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH WNV is known to induce neuronal cell death. at day 1 after infection no significant increase was observed in mRNA expression of any pro-inflammatory cytokines in both MOI-1 and -5 infected cells. a robust up-regulation was detected in the expressions of IL-1, -6, -8, and TNF- at days 2 and 3 after infection with both MOI-1 and -5 of WNV. maximum increase in the expression of IL-1, -6 and TNF- mRNA was in the range of 60- to 120 cDNA templates from mock- and WNV-infected SK-N-SH cells from days 1 to 3 after infection were used to determine the fold-change of IL-1, -6, -8, and TNF- by qRT-PCR. levels of IL-1, -6, -8, and TNF- in culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. neutralization of IL-1 and TNF- protects human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH, cell death. incubation of cells with IL-1-neutralizing antibody resulted in significant (p 0.05) reduction of neurotoxic effects of WNV infection. apoptosis induced by WNV was significantly attenuated in the presence of anti-IL-1 (iii) and anti-TNF- (v). apoptosis was significantly attenuated in the presence of anti-IL-1 (iii) and anti-TNF- (v). the specificity of neutralizing antibodies in protecting cell death was further confirmed using flow cytometry. SK-N-SH cells apoptosis was significantly suppressed in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 and TNF- at day 2 after infection. the intensity of GFAP fluorescence increased significantly (p 0.05) in HBCA cells treated with UV-inactivated infected SK-N-SH cells supernatant (68.1%) compared to those treated with UV-inactivated mock-infected SK-N-SH cells supernatant (46.9%) at 48 h after treatment. astrocytes with only UV-inactivated WNV (MOI-1) did not induce the expression of aforementioned cytokines at any time point. a sharp increase occurred only at 48 h after infection. cDNA templates synthesized from RNA extracted from HBCA cells were used to determine fold-change of IL-1, -6, -8, and TNF- by qRT-PCR. SK-N-SH cells were mock-treated or infected with UV-inactivated supernatant. levels of IL-1, -6, -8, and TNF- in treated or infected HBCA culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. the relative contribution of resident CNS cells, specifically neurons as a mediator of this inflammation is unknown. the relative contribution of resident CNS cells, specifically neurons as a mediator of this inflammation is unknown. neurons as one of the potential sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain increase production of cytokines in the brain. neurons secrete several cytokines under various brain insults. in the normal intact CNS, neurons are the only cell type known to produce low levels of TNF-. IL-6 mRNA has been described within hippocampal and cerebellar neurons of the adult mammalian brain [46,47] neurons-derived cytokines contribute to neuronal death by apoptosis. pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF- have been proposed as potent mediators of neuronal death in several neurodegenerative diseases. IL-1 is the key mediator of caspase-1-dependent apoptosis of neurons. studies also support that IL-1 is the key mediator of caspase-1-dependent apoptosis of neurons. cytokines released from infected neurons may be the initiator of glial cells activation. the production of inflammatory cytokines is significantly up-regulated in nave astrocytes treated with UV-inactivated supernatant from only infected SK-N-SH cell line. this is not the effect of WNV present in UV-inactivated supernatant. in astrocytes treated with UV-inactivated infected supernatant from SK-N-SH cells cytokines were produced at early time point, 24 h after treatment. fold-change of cytokine gene expressions decreased at 48 h after treatment. cytokines and chemokines released from injured neurons have been shown to activate non-neuronal CNS resident cells. neurons-mediated activation of astrocytes may result in downstream pathological events such as bystander death of neurons, increased expression of cell adhesion molecules and disruption of the BBB. neurons as one of the potential sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain Increased production of cytokines in the brain is a common event observed during infection. qRT-PCR and ELISA coincide with peak virus replication in SK-N-SH cells. this suggests that active virus replication in these cells is a main determinant of cytokines up-regulation. in the normal intact CNS, neurons are the only cell type known to produce low levels of TNF- [44,45] neurons-derived cytokines contribute to neuronal death by apoptosis. pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF- have been proposed as potent mediators of neuronal death in several neurodegenerative diseases. IL-1 is the key mediator of caspase-1-dependent apoptosis of neurons. studies also support that IL-1 is the key mediator of caspase-1-dependent apoptosis of neurons. cytokines secreted by WNV-infected neurons activate astrocytes. cytokines released from infected neurons may be the trigger of glial cells activation. the production of inflammatory cytokines is significantly up-regulated in nave astrocytes treated with UV-inactivated supernatant from only infected SK-N-SH cell line. this is not the effect of WNV present in UV-inactivated supernatant. in astrocytes treated with UV-inactivated infected supernatant from SK-N-SH cells cytokines were produced at early time point, 24 h after treatment. fold-change of cytokine gene expressions decreased at 48 h after treatment. cytokines and chemokines released from injured neurons have been shown to activate non-neuronal CNS resident cells. JEV infection resulted in abrogation of neuronal death as well as bystander death mediated by activated microglia [51]. in vivo studies have established that attenuating the cytokine production in brain directly correlates to improved disease outcome in virus infection. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
