{"summary": "to test the hypothesis that toxoplasma\u2013CNS host cell interactions occur during acute toxoplasmosis, initial studies were carried out to detect encephalitis in brain tissues. necrosis and inflammation were present around Toxoplasma cysts. analyses of immunofluorescent staining of ROP18 and active caspase-3 showed a high degree of neural apoptosis was present in the cortex of immunosuppressed mice compared with the control. mice infected with the ROP 18-WT RH significantly increased. the specificity of the staining was confirmed by negative control. neuronal damage was then examined using immunofluorescent staining of NeuN. the cerebral cortex region was double-stained with ROP18 (green) and active caspase-3 (red) DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nuclei. to distinguish putative ROP18-binding proteins from nonspecific binding, we conducted proteomic screening. to demonstrate a direct interaction between ROP18 and RTN1-C, we performed yeast two-hybrid cotransformation and GST pulldown assays. the results indicated that human RTN1-C is a binding partner for ROP18 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). RTN1-C was recruited around the parasites and codistributed with ROP18. this suggests the colocalization of ROP18 with RTN1-C in the cytosol of the infectious primary neuron cells. the results indicated that the host RTN1-C directly binds to ROP18 both in vitro and in vivo. neuro2a cells were transfected with ROP18-GFP or control GFP vector for 24 h. starting fractions (Input) and immunoprecipitates (IP) were analyzed by SDS/PAGE. neuro2a cells were cotransfected with ROP18-WT-GFP or ROP18-KD-GFP and FLAG-tagged RTN1-C for 24 h. the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibodies. whole-cell extracts were transiently coexpressed with ROP18-WT-GFP or ROP18-KD-GFP in Neuro2a cells for 24 h. we overexpressed RTN1-C with FLAG-tagged RTN1-C in neuro2a cells. the wild-type ROP18 phosphorylated RTN1-C at Ser/Thr residues. recombinant wild-type RTN1-C or its mutant proteins were incubated with eukaryotically expressed ROP18. results revealed 32P failed to be incorporated into the RTN1-C-5A mutant proteins in which both Ser7/134 and Thr4/8/118 were replaced with alanine. phosphorylation of the mutant proteins by ROP18 was significantly reduced. acids at the N terminus of RTN1-C eliminated its phosphorylation by ROP18. results strongly indicated that the interaction of RTN1-C with ROP18 mediates its phosphorylation by ROP18 at Ser7/134 and Thr4/8/118 residues. plasmids expressing wild-type nonphosphorylatable RTN1-C-5A or phospho-mimicking RTN1-C (RTN1-C-5D) were transfected into neuro2a cells. apoptosis level of nonphosphorylatable RTN1-C-5A\u2013overexpressing cells was significantly decreased compared with RTN1-C-5D\u2013overexpressing cells. the absence of the 20 amino acids at the N terminus of RTN1-C eliminated ROP18-dependent ER stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis. the results provided evidence that ROP18-dependent RTN1-C phosphorylation at Ser7/134 and Thr4/8/118 sites promoted ER stress-associated apoptosis of Neuro2a cells. phosphorylated RTN1-C phosphorylation induces ER stress-associated apoptosis. phospho-mimicking RTN1-C-5D reduced HDAC activity and nonphosphorylatable RTN1-C-5A abolished the inhibition of HDAC activity. phospho-mimicking RTN1-C-5D overexpression compared with wild-type RTN1-C and control was found to lead to significant GRP78 acetylation. phospho-mimicking RTN1-C-5D overexpression compared with wild-type RTN1-C and control was found to lead to significant GRP78 acetylation. phosphorylated RTN1-C\u2013mediated apoptosis is a consequence of GRP78 acetylation. when cells are pretreated with AA, the phosphorylated RTN-1C protein did not induce apparent apoptosis compared with the untreated phosphorylated RTN-1C group (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 B and C) RTN1-C\u2013deficient Neuro2a cells are resistant, at least in part, to apoptosis induced by ROP18. to test this possibility, we knocked out RTN1-C in Neuro2a cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (SI Appendix, Fig. S7) annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE)/7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining. the plots are obtained from a representative measurement. initial studies were carried out to detect encephalitis in brain tissues. active caspase-3 staining was more pronounced in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of mice infected with the ROP18-WT RH. the specificity of the staining was confirmed by negative control with IgG and baseline weak staining in the normal brain. kinase activity is required for neural apoptosis. immunohistochemical staining of ROP18 in brain sections of mice. used as an affinity matrix to isolate proteins interacting with active ROP18 from human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line extracts. Known members of the ROP18 complex were detected, including the transcription factor of the NF-B family, p65 (RelA), thereby validating this approach (17). the results indicated that the host RTN1-C directly binds to RTN1-C during infection with the virulent type I strain. the results indicated that the host RTN1-C directly binds to RTN1-C both in vitro and in vivo. ROP18-GST bound to glutathione beads was used as an affinity matrix to absorb FLAG-tagged full-length RTN1-C and its truncate 20-RTN1-C\u2013expressed Neuro2a cells. IB, immunoblot. (C) Verifying the interaction of RTN1-C with ROP18 through immunoprecipitation. at 12 h after infection, immunoprecipitation (IP) of RTN-1C from infected cell lysates was detected with rabbit polyclonal ROP18 antibody. the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with FLAG antibodies. wild-type or mutant FLAG-tagged RTN1-C-5A was transiently coexpressed with ROP18-GFP in neuro2a cells for 24 h. whole-cell extracts were immunoblotted with phospho-Ser/Thr antibody and indicated antibodies. ser7/134 and Thr4/8/118 of RTN1-C are the main substrates of RTN1-C. 32P failed to be incorporated into the RTN1-C-5A mutant proteins. phosphorylation of the mutant proteins by ROP18 was reduced. the absence of the 20 amino acids at the N terminus of RTN1-C eliminated its phosphorylation by ROP18. the interaction of RTN1-C with ROP18 mediates its phosphorylation by ROP18 at Ser7/134 and Thr4/8/118 residues. additional experiments employing the ROP18-WT strain or ROP18-KD RH strain consistently revealed that the ROP18-WT-RH strain significantly induced high levels of these related proteins in the ER stress-mediated apoptosis pathway. this data confirmed in vivo that ROP18 kinase activity is required for ER stress-associated apoptosis. the levels of cleaved caspase-12, CHOP, and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly decreased in transfected cells. the absence of the 20 amino acids at the N terminus of RTN1-C eliminated ROP18-dependent ER stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis. neurons were transfected with FLAG-tagged RTN1-C-WT, RTN1-C-5A, or RTN1-C-5D for 24 h. apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry after annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE)/7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining. phospho-mimicking RTN1-C-5D reduced HDAC activity. nonphosphorylatable RTN1-C-5A abolished the inhibition of HDAC activity. inhibition of HDACs led to GRP78 acetylation, which dissociated GRP78 from PERK. the onset of ER stress and initiation of the UPR have evolved for normal ER function. however, following prolonged ER stress or when adaptive response fails, UPR-mediated signals can elicit apoptosis. therefore, we hypothesized that ER stress-associated apoptosis induced by ROP18-phosphorylated RTN1-C is a consequence of GRP78 acetylation. neuro2a cells were transfected with wild-type RTN1-C or its mutants for 24 h. then, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for GRP78, and immunoblotting was performed for acetyl-lysine and the indicated antibodies. to test this possibility, we knocked out RTN1-C in Neuro2a cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry after annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE)/7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining. the plots are obtained from a representative measurement. the mechanism of TE is still a mystery despite a variety of hypotheses that have been proposed. it is essential to explore the reasons for the preferential tropism of Toxoplasma parasites to these tissues and the mechanisms underlying neuropathology. RTNs are a group of membrane proteins localized on the ER that regulate ER structure and functions. these proteins have also been implicated in different signaling pathways and are associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. the molecular mechanisms by which Toxoplasma effectors initiate the ER stress-associated pathway remain unexplored. we also demonstrate that RTN1-C is phosphorylated at Ser7/134 and Thr4/8/118 by ROP18 kinase, leading to the activation of ER stress-mediated apoptosis in neural cells. the injured cells may spiral into the process of apoptosis (32) if the ER stress is not relieved, the injured cells may spiral into the process of apoptosis. the function of HDAC was primarily associated with transcriptional regulation through deacetylation of histones. i type I strains are involved in ER stress-associated apoptosis in neural cells. TE causes complex neuropathogenesis, including inflammation, apoptosis, and necrosis (1, 2, 8\u201311, 21). i type I strains are involved in ER stress-associated apoptosis. the mouse model of TE was established as previously described (11) Parasites. the wild-type ROP18-Ty1-HXGPRT 3\u2032-UTR fragment or the 5\u2032-UTR TUB promoter kinase-deficient ROP18-Ty1-HXGPRT 3\u2032-UTR fragment was transfected into the ku80hxgprt RH parasites. the IRB of the Anhui Medical University approved both animal and human protocols. all experimental procedures were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health. all parasite strains and cell lines were routinely assessed for mycoplasma contamination, and no contamination was detected. the IRB of the anhui medical university approved both animal and human protocols."}{"summary": "to test the hypothesis that toxoplasma\u2013CNS host cell interactions occur during acute toxoplasmosis, initial studies were carried out to detect encephalitis in brain tissues. necrosis and inflammation were present around Toxoplasma cysts. analyses of immunofluorescent staining of ROP18 and active caspase-3 showed a high degree of neural apoptosis was present in the cortex of immunosuppressed mice compared with the control. mice infected with the ROP 18-WT RH significantly increased. the specificity of the staining was confirmed by negative control. neuronal damage was then examined using immunofluorescent staining of NeuN. the cerebral cortex region was double-stained with ROP18 (green) and active caspase-3 (red) DAPI (blue) was used to stain the nuclei. to distinguish putative ROP18-binding proteins from nonspecific binding, we conducted proteomic screening. to demonstrate a direct interaction between ROP18 and RTN1-C, we performed yeast two-hybrid cotransformation and GST pulldown assays. the results indicated that human RTN1-C is a binding partner for ROP18 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
