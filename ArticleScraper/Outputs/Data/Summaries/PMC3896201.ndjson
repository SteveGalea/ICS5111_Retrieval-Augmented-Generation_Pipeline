{"summary": "inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of confirmed H7N9 cases are predictive of severe clinical outcomes. most consistently elevated were IL-6 and IL-8, whereas IL-10, MIP-1, and IFN- were increased at intermediate levels. admission, pg/mL CRP**, mg/L Clinical outcome (discharged after days of onset or death) Cytokines/chemokines Initiation of oseltamivir First methylprednisolone treatment Admission IL-10* IL-6** IL-8** MIP-1* Group A (recovery outcome), a73 M 53 None 5 5 6 2.82 2.4 9.4 7.6 4.4 24.4 14 a107 M 47 coronary heart disease (NYHA IV), chronic bronchitis, primary biliary cirrhosis 6 6 8 4.75 16.9 88.6 110.7 84.6 82.5 Death a22 M 58 Hypertension 9 8 12 2 9.3 122 40.4 23 80.5 a33 M 56 None 3 7 8 26.2 146.9 42 31.7 115 a118 M 88 Hypertension III, diabetes II, chronic bronchitis 7 8 9 5.67 46.3 516 cytokine and chemokines were measured with cytometric bead array (CBA) kits. no bacterial infections during the early hypercytokinemia were identified by clinical laboratory tests. however, bacteria infection occurred in patients who showed a huge blimp of inflammatory cytokines in their plasma. cytokines and chemokines at the site of infection (BAL) were very similar. compared with plasma, measured for three individual patients (a33, a22, and a118) olar damage with extensive lymphocyte infiltration and hyaline membrane formation is consistent with the idea that secreted inflammatory mediators are involved in lesion pathogenesis. all these data are supportive of the idea that greatly elevated cytokine/chemokine levels are associated with the severe lung damage and airway compromise. this pattern was also apparent for the first oseltamivir treatment. intervals were 5.5 d for the C/C patients and increased to 9 d for the T/T patients. a similar trend was observed in mortality rates. the rs-12252-C/C group with higher influenza viral loads (quantified by real-time RT-PCR on days 8\u201313 after disease onset) (B), shorter time (days) from disease onset to oseltamivir treatment (C), shorter time to first methylprednisolone treatment (D), greater use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or mechanical respiratory ventilation (E), increased mortality rates (F) and elevated cytokines/chemokines in plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1 were generally higher in the C/C group vs. the T/C and T/T groups. four of six of the C/C cases had total cytokine levels >150 pg/mL. s >80 pg/mL and 40 pg/mL for IL-6 and IL-8 respectively (10-fold higher than normal), a profile found for only 1 (8.3%) of 12 patients in group A. the differences between groups A and B were less dramatic than for IL-6 and IL-8. 78 M 74 None 8 12 10 2 5.4 39.5 19 5.9 24.8 22 a20 F 81 Arrhythmia 5 6 6 3.49 15.7 134.6 47 26.6 131 23 a9 M 67 None 5 4 9 NA 7.6 76 20.3 25.4 45.1 23 a130 M 67 Diabetes II 11 9 9 NA 2.6 23.7 7.5 0 84 27 a79 M 78 Hypertension II 11 15 10 2.36 2.9 25.9 28.1 25.4 levels of IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1 in plasma correlate with fatal clinical outcomes. patients who recovered and were discharged within 35 d were assigned to group A (survival group), and those died from infection comprise group B. IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, MIP-1, and MIP-1 were substantially elevated for contemporary plasma and BAL samples. the BAL concentrations were 100-fold (MIP-1 and MIP-1) to 1,000-fold (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) higher and TNF- being only detected in the BAL samples. IFN- is at equivalent concentrations in the BAL and plasma for two of these three cases. this could also indicate that IFN- is being effectively consumed/used in the infected lung or that it is produced in the lymphoid tissue. the proportions of C/C and T/C individuals in our H7N9-hospitalized patients were thus selectively increased relative to prevalence rates of 26.5% (C/C), 36.5% (T/C) and 37% (T/T) in the normal (data obtained from the 1,000 genome project) healthy Chinese population. rs-12252-C association with disease severity in patients hospitalized with a H7N9 influenza virus. also shown are association of the rs-12252-C group with higher influenza viral loads (quantified by real-time RT-PCR) in normal Chinese population. iliter, determined by real-time PCR for cDNA copies from throat swabs in viral transport medium, showed that the C/C genotype patients were less able to control H7N9 virus production. that was true for only one of five T/C genotype patients and none of the T/T genotype group. difference between mean value for C/C (103.9) and T/T (103.0) genotypes in the trachea may be even more striking for the deeper high levels of plasma inflammatory cytokines/chemokines early in the course of the H7N9 infection are correlated with severe clinical outcomes. IL-6 and IL-8 are of particular interest, with the concentrations even higher than those recorded earlier for H5N1-infected patients (8). more studies are needed to compare viral titers and cytokine levels in patients with milder influenza infections or severe seasonal influenza disease. the respiratory tract represents an independent mucosal compartment, with innate and adaptive immune profiles that can be distinct from those occurring at other organs or sites. the rs12252-C allele is found at an incidence of 25.8% in the Beijing Chinese population, 27% in the southern Chinese population, and 38.2% in the Japanese population. a thorough assessment of the relative risk of vaccination, as well as its protective efficacy in the C/C group, needs to be determined. inflammatory immune responses linked to the IFITM3 genotype during H7N9 infection play an important role in the pathogenesis of the influenza disease. a total of 18 patients with H7H9 infection confirmed by real-time PCR were admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SHAPHC) the amplification was performed using the following forward and reverse primers. the PCR products were purified and then sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer. a parametric independent t test was used to calculate P values for descriptive variables based on the assumptions of normal distribution and homogeneity of variance. chemokine capture beads followed by PE detection beads. rs12252 was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 3 h. amplification was performed using the following forward and reverse primers."}
