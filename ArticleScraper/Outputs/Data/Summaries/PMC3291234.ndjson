{"summary": "duty of care is often invoked as a sort of quasi-biblical commandment, akin to \"do not lie\" or \"do not murder\" the term \"duty of care\" is, at best, too vague and ethically dangerous, authors say. the term duty of care can therefore be ethically dangerous by giving the illusion of legitimate moral justification. the answer, surely, is no. doctors are under no moral obligation to donate one of their kidneys to one of their patients, for example. the limit of the duty of care should be a function of the normal risk level. the outer limit of acceptable personal risk will fall further along the continuum of risk for some specialists (e.g., infectious disease physicians) the outer limit of acceptable personal risk will fall further along the continuum of risk for some specialists (e.g., infectious disease physicians) than for others (e.g., dermatologists or rheumatologists) hospitals may want to inform prospective staff members of what is expected in crisis situations before, rather than in the midst of an emergency. the outer limit of acceptable personal risk will fall further along the continuum of risk for some specialists than for others (e.g., dermatologists or rheumatologists) a gynecologist may examine intimate parts of his or her patient but cannot drive beyond the speed limit. a doctor agrees to relinquish certain rights enjoyed by others. in times of crisis, the duties deriving from doctors' multiple roles may come into conflict. the virtue of tolerance should also require patients to acknowledge healthcare workers' plurality of roles, as well as their fears and concerns in the face of severe risk. the virtue of tolerance should also require patients to acknowledge their plurality of roles, as well as their fears and concerns in the face of severe risk. the general public should be involved in setting limits to duty. some form of dialogue between the public and the medical profession could help establish a mutually acceptable set of limits. if a swimmer starts to drown 50 meters from the shore, the lifeguard may reasonably be expected to attempt a rescue. avian influenza outbreaks have highlighted the need for a more precise account of duties and obligations of healthcare professionals. the concept of duty of care, in its bare form, is too vague to be helpful. empirical research should be conducted to illuminate the views and reasoning of physicians, patients, and members of the public on the limits of the duty of care."}
