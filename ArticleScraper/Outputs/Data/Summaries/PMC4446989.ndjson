{"summary": "dengue virus is one of four closely related viruses known as dengue serotypes 1\u20134. primary (1\u00b0) infection with one serotype provides life-long immunity to that serotype but does not protect against the other three serotypes. most patients who present to the hospital with dengue infections live in endemic areas. human studies and animal models are essential to determine how B-cell responses and Abs generated in response to DENV infection differ in primary versus secondary cases or mild versus severe disease. studies with human monoclonal anti-DENV antibodies (hmAbs) have highlighted both similarities and major differences between the behavior of sera from convalescent DENV patients. experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. animals were bred at The Jackson Laboratory and surgically implanted together under the same kidney capsule with 1 mm3 fragments of human fetal thymus and liver. mice were inoculated with a low-passaged clinical DENV-2 strain, C0576/94 (106 PFU) by the intravenous route. RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and amplification using the quantitative real-time RT-PCR-based TaqMan system. deNV-2 viral RNA was used as control RNA for quantification. all assays were carried out in triplicate. cells were counted and plated at 100 cells/well. Flow cytometry Splenocytes were washed and rested in RPMI/10% FBS at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. cells were washed and rested in RPMI/10% FBS at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. 96-well plates were coated with concanavalin A (ConA;Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) at 25 g/mL in 0.01 M HEPES (Gibco) in a total volume of 100 L/well for 1 h. the plates were washed and 50 L serum-free DENV preparations was added for 18 h. two sets of 96-well microplates were coated overnight with a 1:40 dilution of DENV inactivated lysate or 50 L of Con A immobilized DENV. plates were incubated with 100 L serially diluted supernatants from hAbs in duplicate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the percent neutralization was calculated for each dilution using formula 100-[(frequency of infected cells in the presence of antibody 100)/frequency of infected cells in the absence of antibody] 1Wjll/SzJmice (NSG-Type 1 IFNR KO) and NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjll Ifnar1tm1Agt/SzJ mice (NSG-Type 1 IFNR KO) mice at 6\u20138 weeks of age were irradiated (200 cGy) and surgically implanted together under same kidney capsule. mice were inoculated with a low-passaged clinical DENV-2 strain, C0576/94 (106 PFU) for challenge studies. mice were inoculated with a low-passaged clinical DENV-2 strain, C0576/94 (106 PFU) mice were immortalized with EBV in the presence of 2.5 g/mL CpG (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA, USA), 1000 U/mL rhIL-2, and 30 g/mL holo-transferrin (Sigma Biochemicals, St. Louis, MO, USA) after two weeks, cells were counted and were plated at 100 cells/well in 96-well plates. supernatants were collected every two weeks and Flow cytometry Splenocytes were washed and rested in RPMI/10% FBS at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. cells were washed with FACS buffer (PBS/2% FBS/0.1% sodium azide) and incubated with a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies. 96-well microplates were coated overnight with a 1:40 dilution of DENV-2 inactivated lysate or 50 L Con A immobilized virions. the plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 90 min. one set of plates was incubated with 8 M urea for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. both sets of plates were washed and incubated with anti-human IgM-HRP. both sets of plates were incubated with anti-human IgM-HRP. blood was collected via cardiac puncture, allowed to clot, and then serum was removed and pooled. initial validation studies were performed in NSG-Type 1 IFNR KO mice using the DENV-2 strain 16681. phenotype of human B cells by multiparametric flow cytometry analyses in the spleen and bone marrow of acutely infected (d7 post-DENV infection) mice to nave and immune (d45 post-DENV infection) mice using the gating strategy. CD5 is a marker associated with a subset of B cells called B-1 B cells predominantly of the IgM subclass34. we found significant expression of CD10 on CD19 + CD20 + and CD19 + CD20-B cells isolated \u201cex vivo\u201d from the spleens of BLT-NSG mice. Symbols represent individual mice that were nave (open triangles; n = 3), infected 7 days (acute; open squares; n = 6) or 45 days prior (immune; filled triangles; n = 2) with 108 PFU DENV-2 S16803. inactivated DENV lysates from all four serotypes of dengue were immobilized on ELISA plates. a 1:10 dilution of sera from immune or nave BLT NSG mice was tested for cross-reactivity to DENV lysates. hAbs are serotype cross-reactive and recognize epitopes on the envelope protein and intact virions. we used vero cell-derived DENV lysates, soluble recombinant E protein, and Con A immobilized intact virions to identify the antigens recognized by hAbs. the majority (14/16) of Abs secreted by B cells obtained from acutely infected mice bound inactivated DENV lysates. 4/8 hAbs isolated from immune mice bound the rE protein. supernatants were tested for binding to uninfected vero cell lysates. hAbs isolated at d7 and d45 recognize DENV-2 inactivated lysates and intact DENV virions. they were found to be cross-reactive and able to bind more than one serotype of intact DENV virions and inactivated DENV lysates. hAbs isolated during acute infection and in immune mice were tested using a modified ELISA. the avidity index was calculated as the ratio of the O.D. with urea to the O.D. without urea multiplied by 100. hAbs generated in immune mice have a higher avidity index compared to hAbs isolated during acute infection. hAbs generated in immune mice had a higher avidity index to DENV antigens. the increase in avidity between day 7 and day 45 may indicate affinity maturation of the antibodies at day 45. hAbs were isolated during acute infection. RNA was isolated from serum and subjected to one-step RT-PCR. values represent copy number of viral RNA present per g serum RNA detected by quantitative RT-PCR. we pre-incubated pooled immune sera from BLT-NSG mice with DENV-2. there was a significant decrease in viral replication in the presence of immune sera five days post-infection. B cells were identified using the phenotypic markers CD19 and CD20 on the CD3 negative population within the human CD45+ lymphocyte gate. values on the Y-axis represent frequencies of hCD19+CD20+ and CD19+CD20 cells within the human CD45+ lymphocyte gate. 34 and CD10 expression is a marker associated with immature B cells. we compared the intensity of CD10 expression (hi, lo and negative) on major B cell populations in the spleen and bone marrow cells of nave, acutely infected, and immune BLT-NSG mice. s represent individual mice that were nave (open triangles; n = 3), infected 7 days (acute; open squares; n = 6) or 45 days prior (immune; filled triangles; n = 2) with 108 PFU DENV-2 S16803. the majority of the CD10hi cells were IgM + IgD-CD27-CD38hi. Splenocytes from mice infected 7 or 45 days prior with 108 PFU DENV-2 S16803 were stimulated with CpG + IL-2 and EBV. culture supernatants obtained 14 days later were used as a source of antibodies to perform an ELISA. we wanted to isolate hAbs from BLT-NSG mice to determine whether they have characteristics similar to Ab responses detected in humans after natural dengue infection. enocytes from the bulk cultures were seeded at 100 cells/well in 96-well plates. deNV-specific IgM Abs were detected in 132/960 (13%) wells from acutely infected mice and 43/960 (4.4%) wells in immune mice. we selected 16 wells from acutely infected mice and 8 wells from immune mice with O.D. values 5 times above background for further analysis. hAbs isolated during acute DENV infection in BLT-NSG mice bind intact virions. the majority of hAbs isolated at d7or (b) d45 recognize DENV-2 inactivated lysates. supernatants from hAbs isolated from splenocytes at (a) d7 or (b) d45 post-DENV infection were tested by ELISA. supernatants from hAbs isolated from splenocytes at (a) d7 or (b) d45 post-DENV infection were tested using a modified ELISA. avidity index was calculated as the ratio of the O.D. with urea to the O.D. without urea multiplied by 100. hAbs generated in immune mice had a higher avidity index compared to hAbs isolated during acute infection reflecting affinity maturation of the antibodies over time. the antibody genes of several day 45 cultures were sequenced. no SHM had taken place, nor was it responsible for the avidity increase. deNV-immunized BLT-NSG mice have decreased viral titers. RNA was isolated from serum and subjected to one-step RT-PCR and quantitative PCR. values represent copy number of viral RNA present per g serum RNA detected by quantitative RT-PCR. two separate experiments were performed (open and closed symbols) the suppression of viral replication was weaker in one of the experiments performed when diluted immune serum from BLT-NSG mice was used. the results indicate that DENV-immunized mice have decreased viral titers when challenged with a clinical strain of DENV. humans develop Abs that cross-react with all four serotypes. but mainly neutralize the homologous serotype responsible for the infection. a large number of B-cells in the periphery of BLT-NSG mice are immature. malaria and HIV are known to cause a flux of CD10hi cells in the periphery. first, malaria and HIV are known to cause a flux of CD10hi cells in the periphery. it is unclear whether deNV also induces CD10hi B cells to be recruited into the periphery or whether blunted B cell differentiation results in the expansion of CD10hi cells. we previously showed that hAbs isolated in immune BLT-NSG mice have a higher avidity and better neutralization capacity compared to Abs isolated during acute dengue infection. the data suggest that B cells present after resolution of infection in BLT-NSG mice may be functionally more mature and perhaps have undergone some form of affinity maturation. the absence of DENV-specific IgG is a significant limitation of this model. we are actively looking at novel humanized models with improved engraftment and increased expression of cytokines critical for B and T cell maturation. author contributions SJ, AR, KS, MW, and PP performed the experiments.
