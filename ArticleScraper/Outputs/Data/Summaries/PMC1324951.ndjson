{"summary": "cellular localization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the lungs of patients with SARS is important in confirming the etiological association of the virus with disease. there have been no comprehensive studies investigating viral infection at the cellular level in humans. a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is genetically distinct from any previously identified coronavirus known to cause disease in animals or humans. the disease was associated with an unusually high morbidity and mortality; 20%\u201330% of patients developed severe respiratory symptoms requiring intensive care support. the disease was associated with an unusually high morbidity and mortality. a single-case publication on the immunohistochemical detection of SARS highlighted the need for more cases of SARS to be studied. the first purpose was to determine the cellular distribution of SARS within the lung. the third purpose was to examine extrapulmonary tissues of patients who died of SARS. HK case 1 was a patient who died in the quarantine period for SARS exposure during hospitalization for congestive heart failure. PCR of a throat swab was positive on the fifth day after symptom onset. all other patients died of SARS with progressive deterioration in lung function. monoclonal antibodies (4D11 and 3E4) were purified from the ascitic fluid by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate. monoclonal antibodies (4D11 and 3E4) were then injected intraperitoneally into mineral oil-primed mice for the production of ascitic fluid. antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving sections in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min and incubating with 1:200 4D11 antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight. sections were microwaved in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum for 10 min at room temperature, then incubated with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody. the FITC-conjugated 4D11 antibody was incubated at 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by counterstaining of the nuclei with DAPI for 4 min and mounting with DAKO fluorescence mount. the hybridization buffer was mixed with the probes and hybridized overnight at 50\u00b0C. RT-PCR was completed on fresh (HK cases 1 and 10\u201313), fixed (HK cases 2\u20139), and snap-frozen (all TO cases) lung tissues from all patients. total RNA was extracted by standard methods and reverse transcribed to cDNA with reverse transcriptase. PCR was performed with initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 8 min. HK case 13 was a patient who died unexpectedly during convalescence. all other patients died of SARS with progressive deterioration in lung function. pulmonary histopathological features of six of the HK cases have been previously reported. monoclonal antibodies (4D11 and 3E4) were purified from the ascitic fluid by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate and subcloned to ensure monoclonality. transfected cells were harvested and washed with PBS, then centrifuged at 1,600 rpm for 10 min. antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving sections in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min and incubating with 1:200 4D11 antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight. FITC-conjugated 4D11 antibody was incubated at 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by counterstaining of nuclei with DAPI. in Situ Hybridization We produced digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobes specific for the N, E, and S genes of SARS-CoV. these were pooled and hybridized with 30 g/ml proteinase K-treated lung sections for 30 min at room temperature. the hybridization buffer (250 g/ml salmon sperm DNA, 125 g/ml rat total RNA, 200 mg/ml yeast t RT-PCR was completed using realArt HPA-Coronavirus LC-RT assay. HK patients 2\u201312 showed established changes indicating diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) at different phases of disease progression that affected the lungs to varying extents. transfected cells showed strong cytoplasmic staining for transfectants containing the N gene with no staining on the M or S gene transfectants. the control sections of FRhK4 cells showed cytoplasmic staining that was focal at 8 h and diffuse at 24 h. staining of the alveolar macrophages was diffusely cytoplasmic. the staining of the pneumocytes was coarsely granular. for all patients who died beyond 14 d after symptom onset, only scattered single positive cells were seen in lung sections. infected cells were positive for EMA (anti-epithelial) and CD68 (anti-macrophage) the number of infected cells was greatest in TO case 1 and HK case 1. no staining was seen in chromogranin-positive or DC-SIGN-positive cells. HK case 1 shows FITC staining within the cytoplasm of CD68-positive cells (E) the same four cases that showed positive staining for N protein by IHC were also positive by ISH for the pooled S, E, and N SARS-CoV genes. HK patient 1, who died 5 d after symptom onset during quarantine for SARS contact, showed moderate interstitial and alveolar edema with occasional epithelial desquamation and regeneration. features of aspiration pneumonia were present, involving small bronchi and adjacent parenchyma in all lobes of the lung. immunohistochemical staining of 293T cells transfected with spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope genes of SARS-CoV. four cases showed positive staining for N protein by IHC (HK case 1 and TO cases 1, 4 and 5). positive elongated cells as well as rounded mononuclear cells were identified in this thrombus. no staining for N protein is present in the bronchus of HK case 1 (A) but there is focal positive staining of bronchiolar epithelium in this case (B) macrophages showed positive coarse granular staining in HK case 1 and TO cases 4 and 5 who died 11 and 14 d after symptom onset. no staining was seen in chromogranin-positive or DC-SIGN-positive cells. no colocalization with TTF1 (a marker for type 2 pneumocytes) was seen. autopsy lung samples from all but three HK cases were positive for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. no signals were detected in endothelial or stromal cells. a few SARS-CoV infected cells were also detected by ISH and IHC. RNA were also detected in an open lung biopsy from a patient on day 5 after symptom onset (before death), but not in the same patient's autopsy lung specimen collected on day 20 after symptom onset. only scattered positive cells were identified in the bronchiolar epithelium, and no significant staining of the bronchial epithelium was observed. hyaline membrane or in lungs showing heterogeneous morphological progression. there is a decrease of SARS-CoV replication and a decrease in intracellular viral copy numbers in lung tissue after the first two weeks of disease. the identification of the cells infected in humans has yielded contradictory findings. to et al. and Chow et al. found epithelial staining but also definite macrophage dual staining. the presence of viral RNA in macrophages represents either phagocytosis or low-level replication in these cells. the material used for the study came from early cases. the spectrum of pulmonary lesions in the cases described in this study is characteristic of the acute and resolving stages of acute lung injuries. the spectrum of pulmonary lesions in the cases described in this study is characteristic of the acute and resolving stages of acute lung injuries. blood in tissues may lead to false-positive PCR results due to viremia. lower viral loads may reflect a small amount of residual genome from a previous infection. this is a possible explanation for the low level of RT-PCR positivity in the lung tissues. only four positive cases by ISH and IHC were in patients who died within the first 2-wk period. lack of IHC and ISH staining of extrapulmonary tissues suggest viral involvement of major organs may not be as widespread as data based on RT-PCR results have previously suggested. findings have important implications on clinical and therapeutic management of SARS should it return in the future. the researchers studied the organs of 32 patients who had died from SARS. they found the virus in the lungs of most patients who died within two weeks of falling ill. the results suggest that the virus causes illness and death by attacking cells in the alveolar epithelium. most of the patients in this study died more than two weeks after they became ill. the study suggests death from SARS is not due to the virus multiplying outside of the lungs. the study also suggests that death from SARS is not due to the virus multiplying outside of the lungs. the first SARS outbreak started in November 2002 in china, and over the next five months spread to a number of other cities around the world. the researchers studied the organs of 32 patients who had died from SARS. they had detailed clinical information on each of them. some had died less than a week after they became ill, others had died after more than a month. 25 out of 32 people died more than two weeks after they became ill. the initial damage to the lungs is so severe that they cannot recover. death from SARS is not due to the virus multiplying outside the lungs. researchers studied the organs of 32 patients who had died from SARS. they found the virus in the lungs of most patients who died within two weeks of falling ill, but not in the lungs of any of the patients who died after more than two weeks of illness. they also examined other organs from two of the patients whose lungs tested positive for the virus and three others who showed no sign of virus in the lungs. most of the patients in this study (25 out of 32) died more than two weeks after they became ill and without signs that the virus was still multiplying in their body. this suggests that death from SARS is not due to the virus multiplying outside of the lungs."}
