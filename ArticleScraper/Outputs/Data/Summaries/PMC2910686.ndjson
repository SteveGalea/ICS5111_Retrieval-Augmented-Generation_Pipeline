{"summary": "Background M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MP) has been reported in 10-40% of community-acquired pneumonia cases. a total of 191 children with MP were grouped by age: 2 years of age (29 patients), 3-5 years of age (81 patients), and 6 years of age (81 patients). in the most recent epidemics, the peak age was younger than that seen previously [6], but few studies have attempted a clinical comparison of MP according to age [4,5]. in some patients, the diagnostic antibodies are not detected in the early stage of M. pneumoniae infection [1]. a total of 1,083 patients with pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infections were admitted during this period. subjects were selected for inclusion in the study if seroconversion was shown on both assays during admission. patients who tested positive were excluded from the study. the chest radiographic findings were reviewed and classified independently by two pediatricians and one pediatric radiologist. we divided the 191 children with MP into three groups according to age. the bronchopneumonia group (25 patients), the mild segmental/lobar group (33 patients), and the severe segmental/lobar group (23 patients). median titers of MAA and cold agglutinins in seroconverters at discharge were 1:160 (range, 1:40-1:2,560) and 1:32 (range, 1:16-1:512) at discharge. no patient showed blood culture positive for bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae. the same 129 patients revealed that 2 patients were co-infected with respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus A) extrapulmonary manifestations of M. pneumoniae were observed as 19 cases of skin rash, 9 cases of abnormal hepatic enzymes (AST and ALT), and 1 case of encephalopathy. we observed significant differences in certain parameters among the three age groups. 2.3 3.6 2.8 4.2 2.3 0.09 Total duration 4.8 2.9 5.4 3.3 6.1 2.9* 0.1 Cases of 7 d (n,%) 9 (31) 29 (36) 40 (49) 0.04 Hospitalization (d) 6.9 1.8 6.9 2.3 6.8 2.1 0.9 Pneumonia (n,%) Bronchopneumonia 23 (79) 48 (59) 25 (31) 0.001 Segmental/lobar 6 (21) 33 (41) 56 (69) bronchopneumonia group was 4.6 2.5 years, significantly younger than that of the segmental/lobar group (6.6 3.0 years;

p = 0.001), total IgG (921 vs. 893 mg/dL, respectively; p = 0.01) and platelet count (371,000/L vs. 262,000/L, respectively; p 0.001) compared with at discharge the MP patients had significantly increased levels of lymphocyte differential. the mean age of the bronchopneumonia group was 4.6 2.5 years, significantly younger than that of the segmental/lobar group. the total duration of fever (p = 0.02) and the length of hospitalization (p = 0.001) were longer in the segmental/lobar group than in the bronchopneumonia group. we analyzed the clinical and laboratory parameters of the subgroup of 81 older children aged 6 years of age. patients with more severe pulmonary lesions showed higher CRP levels (p = 0.02) and a higher proportion of seroconverters (p = 0.001). a group and the severe segmental/lobar pneumonia group (2 test and independent sample t-test) were evaluated according to the severity of the pulmonary lesions in the school-aged children (6-14 years of age) the proportion of seroconverters tended to be higher in patients who had more severe pneumonia (n = 86) indices except for platelet count (240,000 84,000/L vs. 289,000 90,000/L, respectively; p 0.001). age distribution of all patients with MP in the present study was between 9 months and 14 years, with peak incidence at 4-6 years of age. compared with younger children, older children had a more severe clinical course, manifested by longer total duration of fever, higher CRP, and a more severe pneumonia pattern. 45% of patients in the present study were seroconverters. absence of diagnostic IgM antibodies in the early stage of systemic infections has been well documented in previous studies of adults and children with MP. the detection of cold agglutinins (IgM) is nonspecific for M. pneumoniae infections. the titer of cold agglutinins in other systemic infections is rarely 1:64, except in M. pneumoniae infections. all children in this study were treated with amoxicillin with clavulanate and a macrolide (clarithromycin or roxithromycin) 75% of the patients defervesced within 2 days and 83% of patients defervesced within 3 days after initiation of antibiotic treatment. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions All authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
