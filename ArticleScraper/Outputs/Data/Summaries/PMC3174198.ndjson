{"summary": "eukaryotic mRNAs undergo a series of essential modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm where they are translated into proteins. the RNA cap structure found at the 5\u2032 end of mRNAs is critical for the splicing of the cap-proximal intron, the transport of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for both the stability and translation of mRNAs. pathogenic cap-forming enzymes are potential targets for anti-microbial drugs. RNA triphosphatase and RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (N7-MTase) components of the RNA capping machinery have been major targets for the development of drugs directed against RNA cap synthesis [11], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. mechanistic pathway used by RNA guanylyltransferases. mechanism for phosphoryltransfer involves conformational changes between open and closed form of the enzyme. hydrolysis of GTP disrupts interactions between bound guanylate and OB fold domain. biochemical studies have shown that ribavirin triphosphate can actually be used as a substrate by the vaccinia virus GTase to form a covalent enzyme-ribavirin monophosphate intermediate reminiscent of the covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. however, RNA transcripts blocked with ribavirin are not recognized efficiently by the cap-binding protein eIF4E, and are not translated into proteins [26] compounds displaying at least 80% of structural similarity to GTP or ATP (>25,000 compounds) were screened for the binding to the four GTases. the compounds were then ranked according to their binding affinities as estimated by X-SCORE. the extent of covalent complex formation was quantitated by scanning the gel. RNA substrate of 81 nucleotides was synthesized using the MAXIscript kit (Ambion) the RNA transcript was synthesized from the pBS-KSII+ plasmid (Stratagene) that had been linearized with HindIII. Docking calculations were carried out using the Chlorella virus and Candida albicans RNA guanylyltransferase crystal structures. essential hydrogen atoms, Kollman united atom type charges and solvation parameters were added with the aid of Autogrid tools. autogrid maps of 202020 grid points and 0.375 spacing were generated using the Autogrid program. the crosslink mixture was denatured (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5% sucrose, 5% b-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) and separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE. the gel was analyzed by phosphorimaging. total RNA was extracted form S. cerevisiae cells that were grown in the presence or absence of 500 g/ml MPA for 3 h at 30\u00b0C. the primer extension reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea in TBE. the crystal structures of various GTases were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank. the ATP-dependent ligase DNA ligase from Chlorella virus (ChVLig) was expressed and purified as described before [24], [25], [30], [31]. assay for enzyme-GMP complex formation was performed by incubating the enzyme (0.1 M) with 10 M [-32P]GTP. reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 10 mM and SDS to 1%. the purified 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNA was processed to obtain a diphosphorylated 5\u2032 end using the S. cerevisiae RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase (Cet1) which was expressed and purified as described before. the diphosphorylated RNA was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended, quantitated by spectrophotometry, and stored at 20\u00b0C. UV-crosslinking experiments were performed in a crosslink buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2) the protein (12 M) was incubated with GTP (1 mM) and different concentrations of MPA for 10 minutes at 30\u00b0C. -HCl, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, nicked duplex substrate and the Chlorella virus DNA ligase were incubated at 22\u00b0C for 15 min. the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 l 0.5 M EDTA and 5 l formamide. ligands were docked and ranked according to their respective docking scores. mycophenolic acid is a well-known inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a key cellular enzyme required for biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides. MPA has been used both in cancer and immunosuppressive chemotherapy as wll as in antiviral and antifungal therapy. formation of the enzyme-GMP covalent intermediate was monitored by incubating the purified enzyme (1 M) in the presence of [alpha-32P]GTP and increasing concentrations of MPA. the radiolabeled covalent enzyme-GMP complex was then visualized by autoradiography following electrophoresis on a denaturing 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. the second step of the reaction is inhibited by MPA. the complete GTase reaction was monitored using a standard GTase assay. the purified enzyme was incubated with [alpha-32P]GTP and a 5\u2032-diphosphate acceptor RNA. the reaction products were then analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. MPA inhibited the overall GTase activity by 50% at 360 M. MPA is not a substrate for the RNA guanylyltransferase. the nucleophilic attack on the -phosphate of GTP results in the formation of a covalent intermediate in which GMP is linked via a phosphoamide bond to a lysine residue of the enzyme. this was tested by incubating the enzyme with an RNA substrate (81 nt) synthesized in the presence of [alpha-32P]GTP. this RNA substrate harbored a radiolabelled diphosphate 5\u2032-end (5\u2032 ppG-RNA 3\u2032) and 27 internally labelled guanosine residues. the RNA was then incubated with the GTase in the presence of MPA. reaction mixtures contained 1 g of purified enzyme, 23 pmol of radiolabelled 5\u2032 diphosphate-terminated RNA and either 1 mM GTP or 1 mM MPA. reactions were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by ethanol precipitation. computational docking and structure optimizations generated models of MPA bound to the closed form enzyme\u2013GMP complex of the Chlorella virus GTase. the models underwent 150 rounds of steepest descent energy minimization. Ile86 (N-terminal) is predicted to make a hydrophobic interaction with MPA. molecular docking analyses suggest that MPA only binds to the closed form of the enzyme. it is tempting to speculate that the opening of the active site of the enzyme that is normally observed following the formation of the GMP adduct is inhibited by MPA. IC50 value of 410 M could be estimated from inhibition assays. the presence of MPA inhibits the binding of the enzyme-GMP complex to RNA. the enzyme-GMP complex was incubated with a radiolabeled RNA substrate (3 M) of 81 nucleotides in the presence of increasing concentrations of MPA. MPA inhibits all these GTases to the same extent as the S. cerevisiae homolog. IC50 values similar to those obtained for both the first (3 mM) and second step (620 M) of the GTase reaction were observed. inhibition of DNA ligase GTases are members of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily, which also includes DNA and RNA ligases [21] it is tempting to speculate that MPA might also be an inhibitor of DNA/RNA ligases. the presence of increasing concentrations of MPA significanlty decreased strand joining by the Chlorella virus DNA ligase. the first step of the reaction was monitored by incubating the purified enzyme in the presence of [alpha-32P]ATP. the radiolabeled covalent enzyme-AMP complex was then visualized by autoradiography following electrophoresis on a denaturant polyacrylamide gel. a 1-nt gap between the reactive 3\u2032-OH and 5\u2032-phosphate strands resulted in the conversion of the 5\u2032-radiolabeled 18-mer into an adenylated species (AppDNA) the ability of MPA to inhibit this second step of the ligase reaction was investigated by pre-incubating the enzyme with ATP to ensure formation of the covalent enzyme-AMP complex. an autoradiogram of the gel is shown. the positions of the input 5\u2032-monophosphate 18-mer strand (pDNA) and the 36-mer ligation product are indicated. the radiolabeled ligated product was then quantified by phosphorimaging (right side of the panel) primer extension assays were performed with a 5\u2032 P32-labeled 18-mer oligonucleotide complementary to the 5\u2032 region of the SSA1 mRNA. the oligonucleotide was annealed to total mRNAs extracted from cells that were grown in the absence of 500 g/ml MPA for 3 h. RNA transcripts of 74 (C1) and 73 (C2) nucleotides were run in parallel. the positions and sizes of the size markers are indicated on the left. MPA inhibits the RNA guanylyltransferase reaction by preventing the catalytic transfer of the GMP moiety onto an acceptor RNA. a number of MPA derivatives have been developed in recent years. they could shed light on the chemistry of the RNA capping reaction. a decrease in GTP concentrations could have a negative effect on the capping of mRNAs. mycophenolic acid is a well-known inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a key cellular enzyme required for biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides. both compounds lead to a reduction of the de novo synthesis of GTP through IMPDH inhibition, and both molecules can inhibit RNA capping. mycophenolic acid inhibits the RNA guanylyltransferase activity. a standard GTase assay in which the purified enzyme (1 M) was incubated with both [alpha-32P]GTP and a 5\u2032-diphosphate acceptor RNA was performed. MPA inhibits the RNA guanylyltransferase activity. the ability of MPA to inhibit the GTase of the model organism was then investigated. a concentration of 3 mM of MPA is required to inhibit the first step of the reaction by 50%, a concentration that corresponds to 8-times the amount required to inhibit the overall GTase reaction. the effect of MPA on the second step of the RNA reaction was then evaluated by pre-incubating the enzyme with GTP to ensure formation of the covalent enzyme-GMP complex. the appearance of a slower migrating protein species is observed on electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel. this slower migrating species corresponds to the enzyme with covalently bound GMP. however, this was not observed when the enzyme was incubated with MPA. the transfer of MPA to RNA was confirmed by demonstrating the release of a GpppG structure following digestion of the RNA samples with both nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase. however, the transfer of MPA to the acceptor RNA could not be detected when the enzyme was incubated in the presence of MPA. the reaction products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate developed with 0.5 M LiCl and 1 M formic acid. an autoradiogram of the plate is shown. the positions of the chromatographic origin (ori), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and GpppG are indicated. molecular docking model predicts that MPA binds in the cleft created by the closure of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Arg106 and Asp213 of the N-terminal NT domain and Lys234, Asp244, Gln293, Arg295, Asp297, and Glu281 of the OB fold domain would be involved in the coordination of the MPA through hydrogen-bonding. the presence of multiple interactions between MPA and residues of both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the enzyme likely inhibits this critical conformational change. cross-linking assays were performed to monitor the binding of radiolabelled RNA to the enzyme-GMP complex. an apparent K d of 30 M could be estimated for the binding of the RNA to the enzyme-GMP complex. the NT domain (aa 1\u2013243) of the C. albicans GTase aligns to the Chlorella virus GTase enzyme with 1.9 rmsd over 210 amino acids. MPA inhibits all these GTases to the same extent as the S. cerevisiae homolog. members of the RNA/DNA nucleotidyltransferase superfamily harbor a similar three-dimensional architecture consisting of an N-terminal NT domain and a C-terminal OB fold domain. the structures of the S. cerevisiae GTase (PDB: 3KYH), C. albicans GTase (PDB: 1P16), Chlorella virus GTase (PDB: 1CKN), and dyl transfer steps are mechanistically related to the GTase reaction. in the first step of the ligation reaction, nucleophilic attack on the -phosphorus of ATP by ligase results in the formation of a covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate. in the second step, AMP is transferred to the 5\u2032-end of the 5\u2032-phosphate-terminated DNA strand to form a DNA-adenylate complex. a concentration of 3.0 mM of MPA is required to inhibit the first step of the ligase reaction by 50%, a concentration that corresponds to 4-times the amount required to inhibit the overall reaction. the effect of MPA on the second step of the ligation reaction was next evaluated. MPA inhibits the second step of the reaction, i.e. catalytic transfer of the AMP moiety onto the 5\u2032-phosphate terminus of the nicked DNA substrate. MPA inhibits the strand-joining activity of DNA ligase. the transfer of the AMP moiety onto a radiolabeled 5\u2032-32P-labeled 18-mer strand (pDNA) was evaluated by pre-incubating the enzyme with ATP to ensure formation of the covalent enzyme-AMP complex. the formation of the radiolabeled apppDNA was quantified by phosphorimaging on a denaturant polyacrylamide gel. quantitative analysis indicate that cap formation was reduced by 50% in the presence of 500 g/ml MPA. MPA inhibits RNA capping in S. cerevisiae cells. RNA guanylyltransferase inhibitors target the formation of the enzyme-GMP complex. a number of MPA derivatives have been developed in recent years. a decrease in GTP concentrations could have a negative effect on the capping of mRNAs. bis virus and the Borna disease virus showed that the viruses cannot replicate in cultured cells treated with ribavirin because the level of GTP falls too low to permit the capping of viral RNAs. however, mounting evidence indicates that the antiproliferative/antimicrobial effect of MPA is not mediated entirely through the reduction of the intracellular GTP pool."}
