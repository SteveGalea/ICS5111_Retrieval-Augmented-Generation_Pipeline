{"summary": "coronaviruses are positive-strand, enveloped RNA viruses that infect vertebrates. they are associated mainly with respiratory and enteric disease. a coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of SARS. d (replicase proteins), shaded (accessory proteins), and heavily shaded (structural proteins) the ORFs are defined by the genomic sequence of MHV-A59. hatched box represents the common 5\u2032 leader sequence and the hatched circle represents the programmed (1) frameshifting element. MHV-A59 replicase-transcriptase complex amplifies genomic RNA and synthesizes subgenomic mRNAs. nsp1\u2013nsp11 encoded in ORF1a and nsp12\u201316 encoded in ORF1b. nsp1\u2013nsp11 encoded in ORF1a and nsp12\u201316 encoded in ORF1b. cis-acting RNA elements involved in different phases of MHV RNA synthesis have been studied extensively. studies on MHV, and other nidoviruses, have shown the critical role of the so-called transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) element in the discontinuous phase of the transcription process. however, there is still very little known about the structure, functions, and interactions of viral and cellular proteins in the replicase-transcriptase complex. a detailed analysis of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of MHV-A59. they are unable to synthesize viral RNA when the infection is initiated and maintained at the non-permissive temperature. these mutants may also be used in a cis\u2013trans test to define the number of complementation groups that contribute to a specific phenotype. ts mutants failed to form plaques or synthesize viral RNA. other mutants formed plaques at 37 \u00b0C and were considered leaky. ts defects responsible for their RNA-negative phenotype appeared to be caused by a single point mutation. ts mutants did not produce revertant viruses (e.g., LA ts3, Alb ts19) or produced revertant viruses that were markedly different from the parental MHV-A59 virus. complementation analyses began using Alb ts16, LA ts6 and alb ts22 because they each had a distinct ts viral RNA synthesis phenotype. the titers determined at 30 \u00b0C were not corrected for the presence of revertants (or recombinants) as was done by others [39,44]. we found it unnecessary to make this correction because it did not significantly change the CI value (at most a decrease of one tenth) values for the CI were always less than two or more than five. but from the results we obtained, it was clear that recombination did occur when there was complementation. the EOP of the virus harvested from cells co-infected with two complementing viruses was usually 102, and not the EOP of the individual ts mutants, which was 104\u2013108. the data show that at 40 \u00b0C, the mutants Alb ts6, Alb ts16, and LA ts6 were not able to rescue the RNA-negative phenotype of each other. in contrast, Alb ts22 was able to rescue the RNA-negative phenotype of each other and thus, was the sole member of a separate complementation group. mutants Alb ts17, Wu ts36, Wu ts38, and Wu ts38 define not one but two additional complementation groups. mutants Alb ts17, Wu ts36, Wu ts38, and ts38 belong to the same complementation group based on failure to complement each other's defects. a value less than zero means the 3H-uridine incorporation was less than that obtained from mock-infected cells. it was possible to assign a further ten mutants to the same complementation group as Alb ts6, Alb ts16, and LA ts6. this numbering scheme leaves open the possibility of finding two additional complementation groups that would represent gene products of ORF1b. a single nucleotide change was identified as the mutation responsible for the ts mutant phenotype. in each case, a single nucleotide change was identified as the mutation responsible for the ts mutant phenotype. the entire coding region of the replicase genes was sequenced for each of eight ts mutant/revertant pairs. nucleotide changes are numbered according to the sequence of the infectious cDNA clone of MHV-A59. the amino acids are numbered from the amino-terminus to the carboxyl-terminus of each of the non-structural proteins. conservative substitutions were identified in nsp4 and nsp10 of the Alb ts16 and LA ts6 mutants, respectively. radical substitutions were identified in nsp14 of the Alb the MHV-A59 ts mutants were genotyped and measured viral RNA synthesis in infected cells prior to and following shift from the permissive to the non-permissive temperature. the phenotypic analysis was done after 8 h of incubation at 30 \u00b0C at 30 \u00b0C. mutants were labeled for 1 h with 3H-uridine in the presence of 10 g per ml of cycloheximide (CH) to monitor the replicase-transcriptase activity at the time of shift. mutants had about the same level of viral RNA synthesis at both temperatures. mutations in replicase proteins encoded in ORF1a appeared to confer temperature-sensitivity to the viral replicase-transcriptase complex. actinomycin and cycloheximide were given to wt MHV-A59 and ts mutant virus-infected cells at 8 hpi. the amount of incorporated 3H-uridine at 40 \u00b0C was divided by that at 30 \u00b0C and 1.0 was subtracted. phenotype described above for group II, IV, and VI mutants would be consistent with a defect in any stage of positive-strand RNA synthesis. gel electrophoresis of the species of positive-strand RNA made in Alb ts22-infected cells at 30 \u00b0C showed the typical pattern of seven RNAs. the six subgenomic mRNAs were reduced equally in amount relative to the genome RNA when compared to wt MHV-A59 and Alb 22R infected cells. the results show that a shift to 40 \u00b0C led to the rapid loss of RNA synthesis by Alb ts22 but not by wt MHV-A59 or Alb 22R. the results show that a shift to 40 \u00b0C led to the rapid loss of RNA synthesis by Alb ts22. wt MHV-A59 changed incubation temperature from 30 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C at 8 hpi. RNA synthesis increased rapidly within the first 60 min after temperature shift. negative-strand synthesis in MHV-A59-infected cells is short-lived and stops within 30 min of the inhibition of protein synthesis. replicase-transcriptase complexes assembled at 30 \u00b0C continued to function at 40 \u00b0C in the synthesis of positive-strand RNA. however, the group I mutants did not increase their rates of RNA synthesis after shift to non-permissive temperature. at least two possibilities could account for a failure of group I mutants to form fully competent replicase-transcriptase complexes at the non-permissive temperature. viral negative-strand templates in replicating and transcribing structures were purified free of single-stranded RNA. if 40%\u201350% of the total incorporation in the core RNA is found in negative strands, it means that 40%\u201350% of the total incorporation in the core RNA is found in negative strands. negative-strand synthesis continues following a shift from 30 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C at a time when the amount of viral RNA synthesis is 20% ts mutants failed to form plaques or synthesize viral RNA. other mutants formed plaques at 37 \u00b0C and were considered leaky. ts defects responsible for their RNA-negative phenotype appeared to be caused by single point mutation. revertant virus obtained from plaques formed at the non-permissive temperature had properties identical to wt MHV-A59. one exception was Alb ts17, which produced equal numbers of revertant viruses with noticeably smaller plaques. some of the ts mutants did not produce revertant viruses (e.g., LA ts3, Alb ts19) or produced revertant viruses that were markedly different from the parental MHV-A the results of six individual crosses between Alb ts16 and LA ts6 are shown in Table 1. all of these crosses failed to show complementation. the average CI value was 0.5 (0.5 0.18 SD), which is the theoretical value for two mutants with mutations in the same cistron. we found that W\u00fc ts18, W\u00fc ts36, and W\u00fc ts38 were in a different complementation group from that of either Alb ts16 or LA ts22. these mutants defined at least a third complementation group. we devised a method to determine complementation for MHV-A59 mutants. infected cells were incubated until 7\u20138 hpi at 39 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C. RNA synthesis was measured by the incorporation of 3H-uridine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. at 40 \u00b0C, the mutants Alb ts6, Alb ts16, and LA ts6 were not able to rescue the RNA-negative phenotype of each other. cells were infected with: M, mock-infected; A59, MHV-A59; A6, Alb ts6; A22, Alb ts16; A22, Alb ts17; L6, LA ts6; W18, W\u00fc ts18; W38, W\u00fc ts38; A6xA16, Alb ts16 and LA ts6; A16xA22, Alb ts16 and Alb t mutants Alb ts17, Wu ts36, Wu ts38, and Wu ts18 define not one but two additional complementation groups. both mutants complemented W\u00fc ts36 and W\u00fc ts18, which did not complement each other's defects. the entire collection of 19 ts mutants of MHV was assigned to one of four complementation groups based on the locations identified for their causal point mutations. this numbering scheme leaves open the possibility of finding two additional complementation groups in the future that would represent gene products of ORF1b. the revertant was a pseudorevertant in that the nucleotide at position 19288 had reverted from A C, which resulted in a radical substitution of Tyr with Arg. this radical substitution was reflected in a small plaque phenotype (Figure S1). a comparison of predicted replicase protein sequences from different coronaviruses showed that there was conservation of amino acids that were substituted in the proteins with a ts phenotype. the Gln65 residue of nsp10, the His868 residue of nsp12, and the Cys408 residue of nsp14 appear to be well conserved in Group I, II (including SARSCoV), and III coronaviruses. phenotypic analysis was done after 8 h of incubation at 30 \u00b0C. mutants were labeled for 1 h with 3H-uridine in the presence of 10 g per ml of cycloheximide to monitor the replicase-transcriptase activity at the time of shift. nsp12, nsp14, and nsp16 appeared to affect the positive-strand synthetic activity of already-formed replicase-transcriptase complexes. RNA synthesis was determined using a 1 h pulse label with 3H-uridine in the presence of dactinomycin and cycloheximide. at 40 \u00b0C, Alb ts22-infected cells incorporated only mock levels of 3H-uridine, as expected for an RNA-negative ts mutant. at 30 \u00b0C, the plaques formed by Alb ts22 were smaller than those formed by wt MHV-A59 or Alb 22R. a shift to 40 \u00b0C led to the rapid loss of RNA synthesis by Alb ts22. this result is consistent with a failure of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to continue transcription at the non-permissive temperature. both Alb ts16 and LA ts6 are unable to synthesize negative-strand RNA at the non-permissive temperature. the data shown in Figure 4 suggests that they are not significantly impaired in their ability to synthesize positive-strand RNA at this temperature. complementation group I ts mutants are defective in their ability to form active replicase-transcriptase complexes at 40 \u00b0C but retain the positive-strand synthesis activity of the complexes formed at the permissive temperature. the complementation group I mutants are defective in their ability to form active replicase-transcriptase complexes at 40 \u00b0C. mutants infected with wt MHV-A59, Alb ts16, and LA ts6 were shifted from 30 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C at 8 h (Alb ts16) or 9 h (LA ts6) post-infection and were pulse-labeled with 3H uridine at 40 \u00b0C. if 40%\u201350% of the total incorporation in the core RNA is found in negative strands, it means that RF RNA being in negative strands for successive 30 min pulse-periods in the absence of CH. in the case of LA ts6, the percentage of 3H-uridine incorporated in negative strands declined abruptly after shifting to 40 \u00b0C. this decline was the same in the absence or the presence of CH. in the case of MHV-A59, negative-strand synthesis continued at 40 \u00b0C. dactinomycin was given between 1\u20136 hpi at 40 \u00b0C or between 5\u201314 hpi at 30 \u00b0C. at 30 \u00b0C, the plaques formed by Alb ts22 were smaller than those formed by wt MHV-A59 or Alb 22R. dactinomycin was given between 1\u20136 hpi at 40 \u00b0C. a shift to 40 \u00b0C led to the rapid loss of RNA synthesis by Alb ts22. this result is consistent with a failure of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to continue transcription at the non-permissive temperature. both Alb ts16 and LA ts6 are unable to synthesize negative-strand RNA at the non-permissive temperature. the data shown in Figure 4 suggests that they are not significantly impaired in their ability to synthesize positive-strand RNA at this temperature. complementation group I ts mutants are defective in their ability to form active replicase-transcriptase complexes at 40 \u00b0C but retain the positive-strand synthesis activity of the complexes formed at the permissive temperature. the complementation group I mutants are defective in their ability to form active replicase-transcriptase complexes at 40 \u00b0C. mutants infected with wt MHV-A59, Alb ts16, and LA ts6 were shifted from 30 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C at 8 h (Alb ts16) or 9 h (LA ts6) post-infection and were pulse-labeled with 3H uridine at 40 \u00b0C. mutants that continued to make negative strands would be designated as conversion-defective mutants. this is seen by the similar high values of 20%\u201325% of the labeled RF RNA being in negative strands for successive 30 min pulse-periods in the absence of CH. continued negative-strand synthesis in MHV-A59-infected cells is dependent on continued translation and abruptly decline in the presence of CH. a large proportion of nsp1\u2013nsp11 proteins function as a polyprotein, if only initially or transiently, or they associate as a cis-acting complex before they are proteolytically processed. we favor a model in which a pp1a-related polyprotein represents a large modular scaffolding protein that displays binding sites for ORF1b-encoded pp1ab processing products. the idea that the MHV-A59 ORF1b-encoded replicase proteins function in trans is consistent with the results of Brockway et al., who have shown that a green fluorescent protein\u2013tagged MHV-A59 nsp12 is able to diffuse into the replicase-transcriptase complex if expressed individually in virus-infected cells. nsp5, the 3C-like cysteine proteinase, and nsp12 are essential for the assembly of a functional replicase-transcriptase complex. nsp14, the putative MHV exonuclease, nsp16, the putative MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase, nsp4 and nsp10 are essential for the assembly of a functional replicase- coronavirus replicase-transcriptase complex ages, losing both its negative-strand templates and its activity. this interpretation fits well with our genetic analysis of the mutants LA ts6, Alb ts16, and Alb ts6. it is consistent with our proposal that replicase proteins encoded in ORF1a are expressed and function as a polyprotein. the causal mutation in LA ts6 would substitute a Glu for the Gln65 residue of wt nsp10. this would prevent the proper folding of pp1a into a conformation. this would prevent the proper folding of pp1a into a conformation. this would prevent the proper folding of pp1a into a conformation. we speculate that Alb ts16 has a ts defect in the conversion of the replicase-transcriptase complex from one able to synthesize negative strands to one able to synthesize positive strands. but it has yet to be determined if this mutation affects the activity of the proteinase, or if it affects the folding of pp1a or pp1ab, or if the nsp5 C-terminal domain itself nsp14 and nsp16 dissociate or become less tightly associated with the replicase-transcriptase complex after shifting to the non-permissive temperature. another possibility is that the enzymatic activities associated with nsp14 and nsp16 are altered in the group IV and group VI mutants. further studies will be required to explain this phenotype. model proposes that the replicase-transcriptase complex forms initially and creates a negative-strand template. it is then converted to utilize the negative strand as a template for positive-strand synthesis. it is also proposed that proteolytic processing of the replicase polyproteins plays a role in regulation of this pathway. the A59 strain of MHV and a set of ts mutants derived from MHV-A59 (Alb prefix) were originally obtained from the laboratory of
