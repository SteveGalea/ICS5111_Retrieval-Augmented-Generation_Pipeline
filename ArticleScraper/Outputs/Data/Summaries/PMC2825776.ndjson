{"summary": "novel human infections have zoonotic origins (Morens et al. 2004; Wolfe et al. 2007; Jones et al. 2008); HIV was acquired from africa primates (Rambaut et al. 2004; Keele et al. 2006); and SARS coronavirus has been linked to both bats (Guan et al. 2003); and a recent new arenavirus which killed four out of five cases in southern Africa is probably derived we approach these questions using simple mathematical models of within-host evolution and between-host transmission. we approach these questions using simple mathematical models of within-host evolution and between-host transmission. 0.9 is capable of causing much larger outbreaks than one with R0 = 0.1. the mean outbreak size for fixed R0 is given by 1/(1 R0) we label each adaptive stage with i, where i = 0 is the wild-type stage and i = n is the adapted stage. if infection within a host develops an adaptation, it goes to fixation in that host and is thus the only \u2018type\u2019 that can be subsequently transmitted. warning signs of adaptation We consider how ongoing pathogen adaptation could be signalled by outbreak sizes. in the first, \u2018punctuated\u2019 scenario, all adaptations are required together for any increase in reproductive fitness. relative to the wild-type stage, there is little fitness advantage in partial adaptation, and only the adapted stage has significantly increased fitness. insets show distributions for a 10-fold-reduced mutation rate. the gradual scenario causes only small clusters, rarely more than four cases large. the gradual scenario shows a broader range of cluster sizes. a pathogen with gradually increasing fitness and an adaptive stage marginally below emergence capability is most likely to signal ongoing adaptation by causing large but self-limiting outbreaks. a pathogen with gradually increasing fitness and an adaptive stage marginally below emergence capability is most likely to signal ongoing adaptation by causing large but self-limiting outbreaks. inset of figure 5 plots the percentage drop from U(N) to U(N+1) as a function of the number of cases N. sporadic human cases subsequent to that date teach us very little more about whether the virus may ultimately adapt to humans. an outbreak in progress is given a 'rarity score', with respect to past outcomes. for an outbreak in progress, a record is kept of the total outbreak size from every introduction. when this exceeds a given threshold, the alarm is triggered. a rarity score is calculated, in real time, for an outbreak in progress. the \u2018single\u2019 method monitors outbreak size, raising an alarm if a threshold with respect to past outbreak sizes is exceeded. the \u2018double\u2019 method additionally monitors daily incidence. there are many possible refinements to the simple model of transmission presented here. one shortfall in the model is where large numbers of infection are predicted. large outbreaks will tend to be limited by local depletion of susceptibles, as well as being likely to trigger spontaneous social distancing."}
