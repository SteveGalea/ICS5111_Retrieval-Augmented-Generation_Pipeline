{"summary": "the placenta supports the growth and development of the fetus and is paramount to a successful pregnancy. a critical stage of early placental development is the proliferation and differentiation of cytotrophoblasts into extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) the maternal decidua maintains tight control over EVT migration through paracrine signaling. in STs, BCRP prevents the transfer of a number of drugs from the maternal to the fetal circulation. the placenta from preterm pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis exhibited increased ABCG2 and BCRP expression. this indicates that the nature and timing of infection/inflammation determines the positive or negative effects on the regulation of BCRP expression. bacterial (mimicked by LPS) or viral (mimicked by single stranded RNA, ssRNA) infection on these processes. no studies have tested this hypothesis. explants were photographed overnight (37 \u00b0C, 3% O2 and 5% CO2). only explants exhibiting EVT sprouting were included in the study. the slides were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies. anti-mouse BCRP (1:200, BXP-21, ab3380, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), anti-mouse HLA-G (1:300, 4H84, Exbio, Burlington, ON, Canada) after incubation, the slides were washed and incubated with the corresponding biotinylated secondary antibody (1:300, 1 h, Da fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Wisent, St Bruno, QC, Canada), 100 IU/mL of penicillin, and 100 IU/mL of streptomycin at 20% O2 (5% CO2, 37 \u00b0C) cells were seeded (380,000 per well, respectively) in 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h at 20% O2 (5% CO2, 37 \u00b0C) and were then treated with LPS (0.1 380 Real-Time system C1000 TM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) with following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C (2 min) followed by 39 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C (5 s), combined annealing and extension at 60 \u00b0C (20 s) gene expression was normalized to the geometric mean of selected reference genes including TATA-binding protein (TBP) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransfer western blot analysis was conducted as previously described. protein isolated from cultured cells was extracted by sonication using lysis buffer. protein-antibody complexes were detected by incubating (for 5 min) the PVDF membranes with Laminate Crescendo Western HRP Substrate (Millipore, Oak Drive, CA, USA) chemiluminescence was detected under UV by using the ChemiDocTM MP Imaging system (Bio-Rad) the protein band intensity was quantified using image LabTM software. cells were transfected with 50nM pooled ABCG2-siRNAs (siABCG2-1 + siABCG2-2 + siABCG2-3) or scrambled control. cells were then replenished with the serum-reduced medium (Opti-MEM), incubated in the IncuCyte\u00ae S3 system (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) the effect of pharmacological inhibition of BCRP on cell migration was assessed using the specific inhibitor Ko143 (Sigma-Aldrich) cells were seeded at a density of 22,000 cells per well in imagelock plates and treated with Ko143 (1 M) or its diluent (0.001% ethanol) as the vehicle for 2 h before they were wounded. cells were wounded, washed, and imaged as described above. cell proliferation was determined as the percent confluence by the IncuCyteTM software from the data gained every 2 h through the 60 h. cell proliferation was determined as the percent confluence by the IncuCyteTM software from the data gained every 2 h through the 60 h. human placentae from singleton pregnancies used to set up extravillous explant culture. small clusters of 2 to 3 column cytotrophoblasts (CCT) villi presenting high vascularization and clear white tips were excised under the dissecting microscope. photos were taken after 24 h (T24) and 48 h (T48) post transfection. the area of outgrowth at T0, T24, and T48 was analyzed using imageJ software. each experiment was performed in triplicate with a total of N = 3 first trimester human placentae. cell line was developed using first trimester EVTs infected with simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40) cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h at 20% O2 (5% CO2, 37 \u00b0C) and were then treated with LPS (0.1 or 1 g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) RNA concentration and purity were assessed with a nanodrop1000 Spectrophotometer. RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix. qPCR was performed using the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix. the primer sequences of all the assessed genes are shown in Table 1 [28]. the primer sequences of all the assessed genes are shown in Table 1 [28]. pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol with added protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. proteins were separated by electrophoresis (30 g 100 V, 1 h) using SDS polyacrylamide gels. membranes were blocked with skim milk (5%; 1 h at room temperature) the cells were seeded at a density of 13,000 cells/well in 96-well imagelock microplates. the following day, the cells were transfected using lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (2 L/mL) the cells were harvested 24 h post transfection for RNA analysis and 48 h for protein or migration analysis. 13,000 cells were seeded in 96-well imagelock plates. cells were transfected with 50nM pooled ABCG2-siRNAs. cells were incubated for 48 h for effective knockdown on endogenous ABCG2. the effect of the infection challenges on HTR8/SVneo cell migration was assessed by seeding 22,000 cells per well in 96-well imagelock culture plates. the following day, the cells were treated with LPS (0.1 or 1 g/mL) or its vehicle (water) for 24 h. the treatments were replenished after the wounded cells were washed and then they were imaged and analyzed by the incuCyte\u00ae S3 system over the next 36 h pharmacological inhibition of BCRP and the effect of bacterial and viral infective challenges on cell proliferation were similarly assessed. we transfected/treated the HTR8/SVneo cells as described in previous section for 24 h. then incubated them in complete medium (with 10% FBS) and assessed cell proliferation through the incuCyte system. paired serial tissue sections stained with cytokeratin 7 to identify CT, CCT, and ST. respective IgG controls showed no immunostaining (Figure 1G,H) the siRNA sequences were with unique specificity against ABCG2 mRNA. we did not find off-target effects of siABCG2 at the dose and duration of our experiments. BCRP protein was downregulated 48 h post siABCG2 transfection. ABCA6 protein remain unaffected in siRNA transfected cells. Statistical differences were tested by unpaired t-test. data are expressed as means SEM, n = 6 per group. high dose ssRNA treatment increased levels of IL-6 (Figure 4D) and IL-8 mRNA (Figure 4F) at the high dose. CCL2 mRNA expression (Figure 4H) remained unchanged after treatment. cells treated with LPS (0.1 or 1 g/mL) or ssRNA (1 or 2.5 g/mL) or their vehicle control (VEH) for 12 h. secreted IL-6 (C,D) and IL-8 (E,F) protein levels were measured from HTR8/SVneo cell culture supernatants. a wound was made on the cell monolayer using 96-well Wound Maker. a wound was made on the cell monolayer using 96-well plates. cells were imaged with IncuCyteTM every 2 h for 36 h post treatment. ABCG2 knockdown stimulated EVT cell migration in placental explants. villi with visible signs of EVT outgrowths were treated with siABCG2 or control oligos. villi were assessed at the time of transfection (T0), at 24 h (T24) and 48 h (T48) post-transfection. immunohistochemistry images from tissue sections of first trimester human placental explants cultured on Matrigel. showed downregulation of BCRP in the siABCG2 tissue versus the control. expression of BCRP Is Enriched in Column Cytotrophoblasts (CCT) and Extravillous Trophoblasts (EVTs) in Placental Explants Previously, we reported that BCRP is primarily localized to ST in the apical membrane of representative immunohistochemistry (IHC) images from tissue sections of first trimester human placental explants cultured on Matrigel (n = 6), showing: (A,B) cytokeratin 7 (CK7) expression (a trophoblast marker) in cytotrophoblast (CT), column cytotrophoblast (CCT), syncytiotrophoblast (ST), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT); (C,D) HLA we did not find differences in protein expression of another trophoblast-enriched ABC transporter, ABCA6 [29]. we found a significant (p 0.001) increase in HTR8/SVneo cell migration in siABCG2 transfected cells compared to the scrambled control. inhibition of BCRP function using a BCRP specific inhibitor, Ko143, resulted in a similar significant increase (p 0.05) in trophoblast migration. western blot analysis of cells post siRNA transfection. BCRP protein downregulated 48 h post siABCG2 transfection. ABCA6 protein remain unaffected. time lapse imaging was performed by incuCyteTM every 4 h for 60 h. no differences were found between the treatments versus the vehicle control. cytokine and chemokine release is the primary systemic response after bacterial or viral infection. mRNA expression was assessed by qPCR and the geometric mean of the two reference genes: HPRT and TBP were used for normalization. mRNA expression was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. secreted IL-6 (C,D) and IL-8 (E,F) protein levels were measured from HTR8/SVneo cell culture supernatants 12 h post treatment with 1 g/mL LPS (C,E) or 2.5 g/mL ssRNA (D,F) or with VEH. cells were treated with LPS (0.1 or 1 g/mL) or ssRNA (1 or 2.5 g/mL) or their vehicle control (VEH) for 24 h. time lapse imaging was performed by IncuCyteTM every 2 h for 72 h. villi with visible signs of EVT outgrowths were treated with siABCG2 or control oligos. they were assessed at the time of transfection (T0), at 24 h (T24) and 48 h (T48) post-transfection. there was a substantial reduction of BCRP expression in the placental villi of siABCG2 treated explants compared to the controls. CK-7) staining is shown as a marker of trophoblasts (including CCT, CT, STB, and EVT) and HLA-G as a marker of EVTs. study provides new insights into the regulation of EVT migration during early placental development. contrasting actions of BCRP and P-gp in early placentation require further investigation. it is attractive to speculate that P-gp drives placentation by enhancing EVT migration/invasion, while BCRP likely controls the extent of EVT penetration within the decidua. the STRING database of protein\u2013protein interaction indicates interaction between CD44 and BCRP. it is possible to speculate that BCRP competes with P-gp for CD44 binding, interferes with the CD44/HA mediated adhesion properties of EVTs. this possibility requires further investigation. there are no previous reports of ssRNA modulating placental BCRP expression. poly (I:C) inhibited P-gp activity in the fetal mouse blood\u2013brain barrier, but did not alter placental P-gp function. dsRNA viral infection may disrupt normal EVT migration. human placentae infected by ZIKV exhibit villous immaturity. this provides pathological evidence of uteroplacental malperfusion. ssRNA increased HTR-8/SVneo migration. no previous studies have investigated the impact of ssRNA on trophoblast migration. the present study has demonstrated that EVTs express ABCG2 and BCRP and that BCRP limits EVT migration. this suggests that BCRP plays a role in infection-related alterations in EVT function."}
