{"summary": "CDC technical staff commenced working with ministries of health and other partners to assess baseline capacities related to 11 GHSA technical areas. by June 2015, annual country work plans had been developed. the level and nature of CDC support varied across activities depending on technical assistance needs, inputs from other collaborators, and host country and donor financing. completed activities were summarized by using common terminology for similar major accomplishments achieved by countries with CDC support. evaluators provided CDC headquarters and field staff with lists of countries that had achieved each major accomplishment. in November 2016, this process was repeated for completed activities in all 11 technical areas, resulting in a final list that integrated all accomplishments organized into 4 categories. ed surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance to include additional pathogens or broader geographic coverage P.3.2, D.2.1 7 Strategic planning and assessment Developed plans to improve the flow and timing of surveillance information and reporting D.2.2, D.2.3, D.3.1, D.3.2 10 Assessed immunization surveillance, case management, and reporting systems D.2.2 11 Assessed antimicrobial resistance and drug-resistant tuberculosis surveillance and reporting capacity P.3.2, D.3.2 9 Training Particip national surveillance plan D.2.2, D.3.1, D.3.2 10 Documented gaps in surveillance data collection, analysis, and interpretation capabilities D.2.3 12 Developed plan for interoperable information systems supporting indicator- or event-based surveillance and data exchange and integration for priority diseases D.2.1, D.2.2 8 Training Developed training curriculum for health systems personnel in surveillance methods and data use D.2.1, D.2.2, D.2.3, D.2.4 16 Trained surveillance staff to ensure best practices according to international health regulations standards D. standard operating procedures R.2.2, R.2.4 15 Multisectoral coordination Operationalized multisectoral One Health mechanisms to limit animal-to-human spillover of zoonotic diseases P.4.3, P.2.1 9 Initiated activities to strengthen response coordination (e.g., through MOUs) across public health, animal health, law enforcement, and other sectors R.3.1, R.1.1, P.2.1, P.4.3, P.2.1, P.4.3, PoE. CDC supported 675 accomplishments across all 11 GHSA technical areas in 17 Phase I countries. Eleven countries each achieved >40 of these accomplishments. each of the 17 countries achieved >18 of these accomplishments. countries conducted specialized assessments for immunization surveillance and 9 for antimicrobial resistance (e.g., drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis) surveillance. CDC assisted 9 countries in establishing new systems for transporting specimen samples to national reference laboratories. GHSA target and CDC-supported accomplishments. 1.4 9 Assessed antimicrobial resistance and drug-resistant tuberculosis laboratory capacity P.3.1 10 Diagnostics Acquired new diagnostic equipment and capabilities (e.g., specimen test kits) to detect priority pathogens. CDC helped 15 countries train technical and administrative staff on biosafety and biosecurity. eight countries identified staff responsible for inspecting and certifying laboratories for biosafety and biosecurity compliance (Table 2). Workforce Development Field Epidemiology Training Programs All 17 Phase I countries now participate in basic-level frontline (3-month training), intermediate (6- to 9-month training), or advanced (2-year training) training programs train members of a nation\u2019s health workforce to become disease detectives at national and subnational levels. FETP-Frontline D.4.2 15 Conducted intermediate or FETP-Advanced (6 months\u20132 years) D.4.2 6 Provided FETP to >1 staff member from >50% of subnational jurisdictions D.4.1, D.4.2 6 Integrated FETP trainees into core public health functions D.4.1, D.2.3 15 Other training Conducted public health multidisciplinary (e.g., one health) trainings P.4.2 13 Trained laboratory technicians D.1.1, D.1.3 in 14 countries, CDC worked with MOHs to train community leaders in event-based surveillance. in 7 countries, CDC provided trainings and developed infection prevention and control programs for healthcare facilities to combat antimicrobial resistance. in 13 countries, CDC led multidisciplinary and multisectoral public health trainings. 16 countries established real-time surveillance systems and mechanisms for detecting potential public health events at the national or subnational level. surveillance systems were improved for zoonotic diseases (13 countries), vaccine-preventable diseases (10 countries), and antimicrobial resistance (7 countries). in 11 countries, CDC helped countries expand and enhance previously established indicator-based surveillance systems to capture potential threats from larger geographic areas. real-time surveillance systems were improved for zoonotic diseases (13 countries), vaccine-preventable diseases (10 countries), and antimicrobial resistance (7 countries). CDC helped countries expand and enhance previously established indicator-based surveillance systems to capture potential threats from larger geographic areas. CDC worked with 9 countries to assess diagnostic capabilities for priority pathogens. CDC assisted 9 countries in establishing new systems for transporting specimen samples to national reference laboratories. GHSA target and CDC-supported accomplishments Related JEE indicators (12) No. countries Real-time biosurveillance with a national laboratory system. biosafety and biosecurity CDC helped 15 countries train technical and administrative staff on biosafety and biosecurity. eight countries identified staff responsible for inspecting and certifying laboratories for biosafety and biosecurity compliance. CDC assisted 9 countries in establishing new systems for transporting specimen samples to national reference laboratories. GHSA target and CDC-supported accomplishments Related JEE indicators (12) No. countries Real-time biosurveillance with a national laboratory system Strategic planning and assessment Identified national policies, legal authorities, and gaps for the conduct of a national laboratory system. 16 whole-of-government national biosafety and biosecurity system is in place, ensuring that especially dangerous pathogens are identified, held, secured, and monitored in a minimal number of facilities according to best practices. biologic risk management training and educational outreach are conducted to promote a shared culture of responsibility. since April 2015, CDC has established 14 new frontline and 2 new FETP-Advanced in Phase I countries. trains from all countries investigated real or potential outbreaks as part of their training. nearly half of trainees were frontline surveillance officers (16). disciplinary trainings P.4.2 13 Trained laboratory technicians D.1.1, D.1.3 17 Trained staff on biosafety and biosecurity P.6.2 15 Developed infection prevention and control training programs. in 7 countries, CDC provided trainings and developed infection prevention and control training programs. workforce strategic planning CDC supported 16 countries in strategic planning related to the national public and animal health workforce. CDC assisted 6 of these countries in creating national multisectoral workforce development strategic plans based on assessments of existing public health training programs, educational systems, and gaps in the national public health workforce. health emergency management staff R.2.1, D.4.1, R.1.1 15 Assessed laboratory staff performance D.1.4 9 Identified staff in ministries of health, agriculture, and defense responsible for inspection or certification of laboratories for compliance with biosafety and biosecurity requirements P.6.1 8 FETP Conducted 3-month FETP-Frontline D.4.2 15 Participated in FETP-Intermediate or FETP-Advanced run by another country D.4.2 6 Provided FETP to >1 in 14 countries, CDC worked with MOHs to train community leaders in event-based surveillance. in 13 countries, CDC led multidisciplinary and multisectoral public health trainings. one health trainings for preventing zoonotic disease spillover from animals to humans. CDC worked with 13 countries to assess baseline capacities of agencies to respond to biologic threats across public health, animal health, law enforcement, and other sectors. CDC initiated activities to strengthen response coordination across multiple sectors in 12 countries and identified points of contact for multisectoral information-sharing in 10 countries. CDC worked with health, agriculture, defense, and other ministries to broaden the types of pathogens and syndromes that can be detected by improved surveillance systems. countries that previously had systems to monitor a limited range of potential public health threats are now better able to detect animal-to-human disease spillover and healthcare-associated infections. community-level disease monitoring has been shown to influence intervention efforts. community health workers in west africa used surveillance data to target immunizations and reduce the number of cases of vaccine-preventable meningococcal disease by half (23,24) these efforts aim to prevent outbreaks at the source before spreading rapidly within large cities or other countries. national laboratory systems are integral for assessing public health threats and targeting outbreak response efforts. disease detectives performed contact tracing on 894 contacts of EVD case-patients in Lagos, Nigeria. only 11 deaths in Nigeria resulted from this EVD outbreak. CDC established new FETPs in 16 Phase I countries to rapidly train disease detectives. 58 countries, including 14 Phase I countries, completed the JEE with CDC support, identifying countries\u2019 IHR 2005 capabilities. evaluators determined some accomplishments had been achieved by 6 Phase I countries and thus omitted these from the list provided to CDC field staff for validation. however, >6 countries might have achieved some of these by March 2017. GHSA was launched with a goal of making the world safer from infectious disease threats by improving countries\u2019 IHR 2005 core capacities. initial accomplishments have laid the groundwork for further GHSA advancement in these 17 countries. lessons learned might improve the efficiency of GHSA implementation in additional countries."}
