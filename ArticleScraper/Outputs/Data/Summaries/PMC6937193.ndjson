{"summary": "adenoid pad located between the orifice of the Eustachian tube (ET) and posterior nasal cavity can affect the development of otitis media with effusion (OME) because of its anatomical location. the study was to evaluate adenoid microbial colonization through 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) pyrosequencing. host factors of OME are associated with age, sex, Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction, allergies, abnormalities of the systemic mucosal immune system for the inflammatory response, and breastfeeding. microorganisms in the adenoids are potential sources of infection and may spread infection to the adjacent middle ear. the human microbiome has been linked to various diseases, including infectious and immune diseases and cancer. several studies have reported that the microbiome is associated with infectious and inflammatory diseases and non-infectious diseases such as obesity and diabetes. ventilation tube insertion is necessary even if the duration of OME is less than 3 months. children who had a history of previous ventilation tube insertion with recurrent OME had radiologic or physical evidence of adenoid vegetation. adenoidectomy was performed with ventilation tube insertion or tonsillectomy. the concentration and purity of DNA were measured using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Quawell, San Jose, CA, USA) the extracted DNA was stored at 70 \u00b0C until sequencing. PCR Amplification of the 16S rRNA Gene and Sequencing Each sequenced sample was prepared according to the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library protocol. samples were sequenced using the MiSeqTM platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) samples were clustered among sequences with more than 97% sequence similarity. a representative sequence of each OTU was obtained for taxonomic assignment using a reference database (NCBI 16S) ventilation tube insertion is necessary even if the duration of OME is less than 3 months. children who had a history of previous ventilation tube insertion with recurrent OME had radiologic or physical evidence of adenoid vegetation. adenoidectomy was performed with ventilation tube insertion. total DNA from all collected samples was extracted using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Quawell, San Jose, CA, USA) the extracted DNA was stored at 70 \u00b0C until sequencing. PCR Amplification of the 16S rRNA Gene and Sequencing Each sequenced sample was prepared according to the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library protocol. samples were sequenced using the MiSeqTM platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) samples were clustered among sequences with more than 97% sequence similarity. a representative sequence of each OTU was obtained for taxonomic assignment using a reference database (NCBI 16S) patients with tonsillitis more than four times per year and symptoms of an upper respiratory infection within 4 weeks before surgery were excluded. a total of 1,367,587 high-quality reads were obtained after excluding low-quality reads (657,313), chimeric reads (167,142), ambiguous reads (81,498), and other errors (2,583,793) the average read count was 42,737, and the gamma diversity (alpha+beta diversity) proteobacteria (45.06%), Cyanobacteria (13.81%), Bacteroidetes (12.85%), and Firmicutes (77.23%) were frequently detected in the control group. Proteobacteria (55.11%), Firmicutes (15.20%), Bacteroidetes (15.06%), and Actinobacteria (5.75%) were frequently detected in the control group. in the control group, Loriellopsis (p=0.000), Burkholderia (p=0.000), Pantoea (p=0.000), Chlamydia (p=0.000), Pseudomonas (p=0.023), and Xanthomonas (p=0.006) were significantly higher than those in the control group. the 51 species that were significantly higher in the control group were Dolosigranulum pigrum (p=0.035), Megasphaera micronuciformis (p=0.004), Clostridium disporicum (p=0.039) and Stomatobaculum longum (p=0.019) of the 51 species that were significantly higher in the control group, five had more than 1% of the species on average. a three-dimensional PCoA based on the weighted UniFrac distance matrix can explain 67% of the variance among samples. the similarity difference between the two groups can be seen on the PC2 axis, but they did not form completely separate clusters. two patients were recruited for this study. their ages ranged from 19 months to 15 years. the mean duration of disease in the group was 12.5 weeks. taxonomic analysis revealed that Proteobacteria was the most common phylum in both groups. Proteobacteria (45.06%), Cyanobacteria (13.81%), Bacteroidetes (12.85%), and Firmicutes (77.23%) were frequently detected in the control group. in the control group, 13 taxa with more than 1% were detected. haemophilus, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Delftia, Corynebacterium, Veillonella, Niastella, and Streptobacillus were significantly higher than those in the control group. faciens (13.7%) and Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae (6.4%) were the most abundant in the OME group. Haemophilus aegyptius (13.0%), Loriellopsis cavernicola (12.3%) and Burkholderia plantarii (10.2%) were the most abundant in the control group. nicola, burkholderia plantarii, Pantoea deleyi, Curtobacterium albidum, and Xanthomonas theicola showed more than 1% composition on average (*p0.05, **p0.01) the diversity and association of bacterial composition between the OME and control groups were reconstructed by various methods. adenoid microbiomes were more complex and diverse than culture-based reports known to date. a culture-based microbial analysis of adenoid samples showed that Haemophilus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus were the most abundant. the diversity of the fecal microbiome in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis is lower than that in healthy controls. nasopharyngeal microbial diversity in children with AOM is lower than non-infectious nasopharyngeal microbiomes. a small percentage of Cyanobacteria has been identified in previous adenoid microbiome studies, but not as much as in this study. the four dominant species in the OME group were strains that were rarely cultured in a traditional culture-based study of adenoids. corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum are significantly higher in the control group than in patients with recurrent AOM. the composition of the dominant adenoid microbiome in the control group was similar to those seen in other countries and on other races. however, the non-dominant microbiomes detected in the control group varied from study to study. we identified a difference in bacterial diversity and microbial composition. results provide basic data for identifying a new pathologic mechanism."}
