{"summary": "the fusion protein obtained, YFP-p1, was shown to be functional as revealed by complementation experiments with the phage gene 1 cloned at the chromosomal amyE locus. the fusion protein was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy in B. subtilis\u2013infected cells and analyzed the subcellular localization of the protein by immunofluorescence techniques. phage 29 protein p1 was present in a midcell location at divisome and constriction sites. it was present in a midcell location at divisome (see arrow and Fig. 1E, middle part), revealing its distribution is independent of other 29-encoded proteins. fusion proteins analyzed 30 min after xylose and IPTG addition. for clarity, YFP and CFP are false-colored green and red. a strain with IPTG-conditional synthesis of FtsZ (1801) (21) was genetically modified to express YFP-p1 in a xylose-dependent manner (DBP-003) in the absence of FtsZ, B. subtilis cells exhibited a filamentous morphology as a consequence of a failure in septum formation and cell division. oglycan synthesis and depletion of PBP2B blocks cell division. protein p1 was detected in a portion of the cells where the cytoplasmic membrane was not yet invaginated. to determine whether septal wall synthesis is required for protein p1 recruitment at midcell locations, we made use of strain 804 (22), in which pbpB expression is regulated by the IPTG promoter. vivo cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde, and FtsZ complexes were purified. proteins p1 and p1 oligomers were detected in whole cell lysates. protein p1 was only detected in the eluted fraction corresponding to purified His-tagged FtsZ complexes. protein p1C11 (8.8 kDa) was incubated with B. subtilis protein FtsZ (40 kDa) in the presence of 5 mM MgSO4. the absence of protein p1 impairs 29 DNA synthesis in B. subtilis (5), but little was known about its biological function. pac promoter (DBP-005) analyzed the bacterial morphology by using the N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino) phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide (FM 4-64) membrane dye. bacterial cells showed a normal size with a mean cell length of 3.82 m. cells were stained with FM 4-64 and photographed. half of the culture was not induced with IPTG. as controls, half of the culture was not induced with IPTG. strains DBP-007 and DBP-006 are infected similarly by phage 29. the intracellular accumulated 29 DNA increased 35% and 31% at 40 and 50 min, respectively, in the ezrA(R510D) mutant compared with the WT strain. this results establishes a direct correlation between cellular length and 29 DNA accumulation. fusion protein obtained, YFP-p1, was shown to be functional as revealed by complementation experiments with the 29 mutant phage sus1(629). localization of YFP-p1 was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy in B. subtilis\u2013infected cells. arrow and Fig. 1E reveal that its distribution is independent of other 29-encoded proteins. YFP, membrane staining, and merged images of typical B. subtilis cells expressing xylose-induced YFP-p1 fusion protein after 29 infection at a MOI of 5. 29 protein p1 localizes at the bacterial divisome assembling site. we constructed a B. subtilis strain (DBP-002) simultaneously expressing functional FtsZ-CFP and YFP-p1 fusions from isopropyl--d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and xylose-inducible promoters. the results show that both proteins colocalize. subcellular localization of phage 29 protein p1 in absence of the divisome proteins FtsZ or PBP2B. YFP, membrane staining, and merged images of B. subtilis strains DBP-003 (A) and DBP-004 (B) were acquired 30 min after xylose addition. pbpB expression is regulated by the IPTG promoter. strain 804 exhibits impaired septum formation and cell division. yFP-p1 remains assembled into bands regularly positioned along the filament. protein p1 may be associated to the Z ring, either directly or indirectly. protein p1 and p1 oligomers were detected in whole cell lysates of infected cells expressing both FtsZ and His-tagged FtsZ. protein p1 was only detected in the eluted fraction corresponding to the purified His-tagged FtsZ complexes. protein p1 has an amphiphilic nature (12) and therefore deleted 11 C-terminal residues spanning Val75 to Lys85 to obtain a soluble variant of the protein (p1C11) after disuccinimidyl suberate treatment, products corresponding to the expected size for FtsZ\u2013p1C11 complexes were detected. bacterial cells showed a normal size with a mean cell length of 3.78 m. expression of CFP gave a mean value of 3.82 m in cellular length. but when protein p1 was synthesized, the mean value in cellular length increased to 5.55 m, which means an enlargement of about 1.5 times in bacterial length. subtilis strain 168spo0A cells were grown to exponential phase and infected with 29 sus14(1242) after 50 min, cells were stained with FM 4-64 and photographed. as control, half of the culture was not infected. strains DBP-006 and DBP-007 are infected similarly by phage 29. the intracellular accumulated 29 DNA increased 35% and 31% at 40 and 50 min. this result establishes a direct correlation between cellular length and 29 DNA accumulation. the intracellular concentration of protein p1 has been determined to increase along the infection cycle, reaching levels about 60-fold higher than those of the phage DNA polymerase (5). the viral genome is recruited to the bacterial nucleoid by means of the DNA binding domain of the parental TP. the bacterial nucleoid provides an appropriate environment for both 29 DNA replication and transcription. protein p1 localization is not altered in cells lacking PBP2B. protein p1 is synthesized from the beginning of the 29 infection cycle. phage 29 DNA replication machinery is redistributed in a helix-like configuration. protein p1 remains associated to the future poles of the enlarged daughter cells. assembly occurs by a two-step mechanism in B. subtilis. early-assembling proteins are directly recruited to the Z ring. eukaryotic viruses have developed the capacity to take advantage of actin and tubulin cytoskeleton components. bacterial cytokinesis is organized by the tubulin homolog FtsZ, the eukaryotic contractile ring is formed by actin. adenoviruses move their capsids in a microtubule-dependent fashion toward and away from the microtubule-organizing center to target the cell nucleus. bacteriophage 2012-1 synthesizes a tubulin-like protein, PhuZ, which forms dynamic filaments in vivo that are required for positioning phage DNA within the bacterial cell. transformed E. coli cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 g/mL ampicillin. spo0A deletion strains were used when experiments required phage infection. mutation in gene 14 has no effect on phage DNA replication or phage morphogenesis. the expression of YFP-p1 was induced by the addition of xylose to a final concentration of 0.5% (wt/vol) to express FtsZ-CFP, 1 mM of IPTG was used. all fluorescent microscopy images were acquired with a laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM710 coupled to an inverted AxioObserver) overnight cultures were diluted 1:200 in the same fresh medium and grown at 37 \u00b0C. each culture was infected with WT phage 29 at a multiplicity of infection. each culture was harvested at the indicated times after infection. LB medium was supplemented with the required antibiotics. overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in the same fresh medium. expression of YFP-p1 was induced by the addition of xylose. a laser scanning multiphoton microscope (Zeiss LSM710 coupled to an inverted AxioObserver and Zeiss LSM510 coupled to a vertical AxioImager M1) cellular length was measured with the FIJI software. data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism."}
