{"summary": "the mammalian intestine harbors trillions of microbes (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) these microbes play vital roles in the maintenance of gut homeostasis and host health. antibiotics-induced resistance and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens have emerged as serious problems worldwide. fecal microbiota transplantation refers to the engraftment of fecal suspension from a healthy donor into the recipient\u2019s intestinal tract to restore the community and function of intestinal microbiota. the first use of donor feces as a therapeutic agent for food poisoning and diarrhea was recorded by a Chinese, Hong Ge, in the 4th century. pigs encounter multiple stressors and overuse of antibiotics. the use of antibiotics in livestock farming was gradually banned. finding alternatives to antibiotics is important to livestock farming and food safety. porcine FMT is used in the pig industry to prevent and treat intestinal disorders. donor feces may carry pathogenic and conditional pathogenic microbes. potential donors should be selected using strict exclusion criteria. donor screening in porcine FMT is based on studies related to human donors screening and pig production. studies have revealed that maternal-line first-degree relatives or intimate contacts can share environmental risk factors. recipients are more tolerant to gut microbiota from donors who are immediate family members. serological testing and stool testing should be performed to monitor potentially infectious pathogens. common infectious diseases-related pathogens in the pig industry are as follows. porcine circovirus type 2, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, rotavirus, bocavirus, corona virus, and porcine enterovirus. serological tests are widely used to detect infectious diseases-associated pathogens based on the antigen\u2013antibody binding reactions in vitro. RNA-virus pathogens could be detected using a combined method of the fecal RNA extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ELISA test could also be used to detect pathogens-associated antigens in feces directly to confirm whether corresponding pathogens are present. a recent study showed that Lactobacillus johnsonii may have the potential efficacy to reduce Salmonella invasion of intestinal epithelium in pigs. we should select optimal donor pigs which have high-abundance \u201cfunctional microbes\u201d according to the results of fecal microbial compositions and functions analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing and metagenomics in porcine FMT. 30 g fecal samples are diluted with 150 ml sterile saline and homogenized in a standard blender. the fecal suspension could be centrifuged at 6,000 g for 15 min. the precipitate, without the supernatant, is re-suspended in fresh sterile saline. the suspension should be transferred to the recipients directly. frozen fecal suspension should be thawed at 37\u00b0C (water bath) when there is the need for porcine FMT, the suspension should be thawed at 37\u00b0C (water bath) frozen fecal material should be labeled accurately and then stored at -80\u00b0C. fecal samples are diluted with 150 ml sterile saline and homogenized in a standard blender. the fecal suspension could be centrifuged at 6,000 g for 15 min. reducing time of oxygen exposure in fecal material preparation is crucial. feces from healthy donor pigs were homogenized with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) in blender. the suspension should be thawed at 37\u00b0C (water bath) when there is the need for porcine FMT, the frozen fecal suspension should be thawed at 37\u00b0C. sterile saline solution can be added to obtain a required concentration. infusion of fecal suspension should be implemented as soon as possible at room temperature. oral gavage and cohousing are used to transfer the fecal microbiota from donor mice to recipient mice. the frequency of fecal material transfer could also be adjusted according to practical situations in pig industry. the transfer of fecal material should be performed as soon as possible because the microbial cells are fragile and sensitive. patients with CDI should be treated with vancomycin at least for 3 days and then discontinue antibiotic for 12\u201348 h before FMT. establishment of stool bank saves time for FMT, but also reduces cost. stool banks retain information about donors, thereby ensuring traceability. most clinical experiences that focused on the use of FMT have shown that FMT is safe in humans. pork is the main meat food for human, we should carefully reflect on the potential effects of porcine FMT on pork food safety. strict donor screening is essential for reducing the risks of pathogen transmission during porcine FMT. potential antibiotics and drugs residues in pork of recipient pigs should be avoided via strict donor selection. there is no diet requirement for donors and recipients in human FMT. the process of fecal material preparation will directly affect the efficacy of porcine FMT. it is important to shorten the time for fecal material preparation and transfer. characterization of porcine intestinal microbial functions via FMT is of great significance and requires further investigation. characterization of porcine intestinal microbial functions via FMT is of great significance and requires further investigation. author contributions JH and LC wrote the paper with the help of all authors. all authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
