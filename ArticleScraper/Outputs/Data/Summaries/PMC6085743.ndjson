{"summary": "one thousand and fifty nine samples of patients presenting influenza Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) symptoms were tested for other respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR assays targeting 10 respiratory viruses. the proportion of children infected with at least one virus was 29.8% (273/917) in ILI cases and 23.9% (34/142) in SARI cases. 2.2 million children worldwide die each year of ARI. nearly 40% of these deaths occur in Africa because of limited diagnostic capacities. viral infections play a major role in the occurrence of ARI in developed countries. the control of children morbidity and mortality is based on a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. a sentinel surveillance system for influenza viruses was established in 2003 at the initiative of the Institut Pasteur of Cote d\u2019Ivoire. this surveillance has helped to identify and characterize circulating seasonal influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1) pdm09 and influenza B viruses. the influenza sentinel surveillance network is composed of 9 sentinel sites. each day, doctors, nurses and other trained healthcare staff identified children meeting the ILI or SARI case definition. a SARI case was defined as any patient with acute respiratory infection with a history of fever or fever with a temperature 38\u00b0C. geal swabs were placed in a viral transport medium, VTM (MEM, Gibco-BRL, life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland, Penicillin 200 U / ml, streptomycin 200 mg / ml, BioWhittaker, MA; mycostatin 200U/ml, Sigma, bovine serum albumin 0.25%, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) Once collected, samples were placed in coolers and transported immediatly to the national m09) subtyping panel (RUO) and CDC influenza B Lineage genotyping panel (RUO) negative specimens were tested for other respiratory viruses. the multiplex 1-targeted human hRSV andhMPV. list of primers for respiratory virus detection Virus Primers Sequence (5\u20193\u2019) RT-PCR hRSV vrs P1 GGA ACA AGT TGT TGA TTA TGA ATA TGC vrs P2 CTT CTG CTG TCA AGT CTA GTA CAC TGT AGT hMPV hmpv 1 CCC TTT GTT TCA ACA GTA GCT G SEMI-NESTED hRSV vr enza virus 2c CTA GCT GAA CTG AGA CTT G parainfluenza virus 3 Para 3i GCT TGA TTC C parainfluenza virus 4 Pi4i GTC TGA TCC CAT AAG CAG C PRIMERS MULTIPLEX 3 Virus Primers Sequence(5\u20193\u20193) RT-PCR hRV/HEnV SRHI1 GCA TCI GGY ARY TTC CAC CAC CA influenza sentinel surveillance network is composed of 9 sentinel sites. each day, doctors, nurses and other trained healthcare staff identified children meeting the ILI or SARI case definition. patients who did not meet the case definition were excluded from the study. samples from each patient included in the study were collected using sterile nasopharyngeal swabs that were then placed in a viral transport medium, VTM. samples were placed into coolers and transported immediatly to the national influenza center (NIC) the maximum storage period at each site did not exceed 3 days. three different amplification kits were used for the detection of viruses mentioned.
