{"summary": "tannins have been officially recognized as a discrete group of different molecules based on gallic acid content. the great growth of the tannin extraction industry began in the years around 1850 in Lyon, where tannin was used as iron tannate for the black coloring of silk for women\u2019s blouses. factories were opened in distant countries to satisfy the growing demand. tannins are natural products found in most higher plants. they are produced in almost all parts of the plant, namely seeds, roots, bark, wood, and leaves. hydrolysable tannins such as gallo-tannins and ellagi-tannins are stable. most gallo-tannins isolated from plants contain a polyol residue derived from D-glucose. ellagi-tannins contain additional binding motifs that arise from additional oxidative coupling reactions between the galloyl fragments. condensed tannin extracts consist of flavonoid oligomers of different average degrees of polymerisation. small proportions of flavan-3-ols, flavan-3,4-diols, and other flavonoid analogs are also present. most gallo-tannins isolated from plants contain a polyol residue derived from D-glucose. two other categories, gallo-tannins of tara and caffe-tannins also occur. the second step consists essentially of dimerization after a second enzyme-mediated specific oxidation of hexahydroxydiphenoyl group of the ellagi-tannin with the galloyl group of another tannin to form a valoneyl group-containing dimer. these reactions continue to form higher oligomers. condensed tannin extracts consist of flavonoid oligomers of different average degrees of polymerisation. small proportions of flavan-3-ols, flavan-3,4-diols, and other flavonoid analogs are also present. oligomers derived from hydrolysed hemicelluloses are often present in sufficient quantities. tannins exfiltrated wood chips and slowly impregnated more of each skin. tannins were used to produce good quality leather but it took several months. the tannin extraction industry was in a desperate position because of the change in fashion. research on vegetable tanned leather has evolved for vegetable tanning. rotary drums allows vegetable tanning to be finalized in about 24 h. rebirth of the use of plant tannins for other application areas appears to take place. the development and industrialization of zinc salts to accelerate the hardening of non-fortified tannin adhesives for plywood. the development of isocyanate/tannin copolymers as difficult-to-bond hardwood adhesives and for plywood and other applications. tannin-furfuryl alcohol adhesive formulations are a bio-based material. the second constraint is the demand of most companies to eliminate formaldehyde emissions from tannin adhesive. the quest has taken two approaches: total elimination of formaldehyde by substituting it with aldehydes and non-volatile. tannin-based pharmaceuticals to cure intestine infections have long-time been marketed. they react with proteins irreversibly, thus complexing within bacterial membranes, neutralizing their activity. their antiviral effectiveness is also well documented by in vitro screening for 12 different hydrolysable and condensed tannins. acutissimin A is a bound flavonoid with an ellagi-tannin. it is formed by the interaction of a wine flavonoid with the vescalagin generated by the barrel\u2019s oak tannin. it has been found to present an effectiveness 250 times higher to stop tumors growth than the drug Etoposide. tannins in wines, some beers, and several fruit juices contain too low a concentration of tannin. addition of tannin or tannin-rich wood chips directly to wine to enhance its taste was strictly forbidden in most european countries. tannin-rich oak wood chips are now legal in the u.s. and europe. it is the antioxidant property of the polyphenolic groups of the tannin. tannins are on sale in north America. foams have been developed based on the reaction of a modified tannin either by benzoylation or by oxypropylation to make it more susceptible as polyol to the reaction with polymeric isocyanates [62,63,64,65]. this is a traditional approach where tannin only functions as a polyol. mixed species formed by mixed co-reaction of two, three, and four different reagents in the mix were identified. examples of mixed species obtained by the reaction of tannin\u2013furfuryl alcohol\u2013glyoxal mixes with polymeric diphenyl methane isocyanate (PMDI) tests on a continuous production line have yielded positive results. a number of applications have been developed for these foams. open-cell foams have been used for a number of different applications. open-cell foams have been used for very good acoustic insulation. macro-PTSDP scaffolds with defined geometry, porosity, and mechanical properties were made by mixing PTSDP and hydroxyapatite (Ca10 (PO4) 6 (OH)2. the scaffolds developed in this work support the attachment, long-term viability, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. the problem of purification of wastewater by heavy metal ions is more and more considered because there is a growing sensitivity around their environmental pollution. the idea of using a tannin in powder form, or as a rigid foams, connects the natural ability of polyphenols to entrap metal ions with the easy removal system. tannins can be used as anticorrosive metal primers, as they can oxidize phenolic groups (antioxidant) and complex the metal substrate by forming of orthodiphenol metal complexes. tannins can be used as anticorrosive metal primers, as they can potentially oxidize phenolic groups (antioxidant) flavonoid tannins are traditionally coated with metal-containing anti-fouling paints. such formulations were able to reduce copper consumption by 40-fold compared to copper-based paints. tannate-based inks still used in school in the first half of the 20th century. the properties of drilling fluids are often defined by the well program. lithology is one of the factors to be considered. the selection of a drilling fluid becomes more stringent due to the needs of thermal stability of the drilling fluid system. calcium lignosulfonate (CaLS) is dissolved in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid for decalcification. the mixture is frequently stirred for 10 min and sodium hydroxide is then added to adjust the pH of the solution to between 3 and 4. the solution is then stirred continuously for 2 h. the reaction takes place at temperatures around 180 \u00b0C. it leads to hard solid finishes and films particularly suitable for attachment to aluminum and stainless steel. the reactions are temperature-dependent. tannin\u2013furanic foam (black) compared to synthetic phenol\u2013formaldehyde/furanic foam (green) vermiculite and dolomite are added as well. the inclusion of antifungal compounds and nutrients in the foam composition is also beneficial. a high yield of urethane linkages was obtained by reacting hydroxyl-rich chestnut hydrolysable tannin with dimethyl carbonate followed by hexamethylenediamine [118] polyurethanes prepared in this way are of interest as toxic isocyanates. the same approach has been applied to condensed tannins. polyurethanes formed yielded a hard film [120], indicating non-isocyanate polyurethanes can be synthesized just from carbohydrates. the compounds formed were identified by several instrumental analytical techniques. species as shown in Figure 12 were identified. glucose NIPUs gave good results as a surface coating curing at 103 \u00b0C. sucrose NIPUs performed well only at a much higher curing temperature. NIPU resins derived from saccharides have also been used as wood panel adhesives. tannin/furan thermosetting plastics were prepared by copolymerization and characterized [122]. this new material is synthesized by the reaction of tannin and furfuryl alcohol, two inexpensive vegetable chemicals. the co-polymerization processes of both were investigated by 13C NMR and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight. steel bar cutting times with these green experimental disks compared well to those of commercial synthetic resin-bonded disks. they stood up well to heavy braking and strong stresses such as emergency braking at 50 km/h (31 mph) to a complete stop. GET was the starting material for preparing the tannin epoxy acrylate resin by reacting it with acrylic acid with a catalyst and adding hydroquinone. the reaction proceeds in two steps: first, the epoxidization of the flavonoid tannin, and second, its reaction with acrylic acid catalyzed by hydroquinone. bio-sourced resin matrices were impregnated with renewable bio-sourced resin matrices to yield both high and low density composites of good performance. the matrices based on mixed tannin and lignin gave composites with a thermoplastic behavior after just the first hotpressing. they were thus thermoformable as they could be shaped. composites of 50% matrix resin/50% natural fibers showed good tensile strength, water swelling, and Young\u2019s modulus. best results were achieved at a slow curing low temperature (130 \u00b0C, 35 min) at a 20% moisture content. a higher moisture content yielded a lighter color of mimosa tannin impregnated papers. impregnated surfaces with tannin/furan resin impregnated paper are too dark for decorative applications, but may be useful for the manufacture of cement formwork panels. yl alcohol with flavonoid A-rings and the simultaneous self-condensation of furfuryl alcohol linked to reactive flavonoid tannin sites. methylene ether bridges were formed between furan and furan reactive sites. the latter reacted with both the flavonoid and furan reactive sites to give \u2013CH2OH and \u2013CH2+ groups and further methylene bridges. polyflavonoid tannins are attractive as dispersants/superplasticizers for cement. extracts of sulphited mimosa, quebracho, and pine tannin behave very well. a dosage of 0.25 to 0.5% by weight on the cement has a significant effect of fluidification. metal salts (iron or copper sulfate) are added to the tannic material (the gall nut) it gives the black hue, most often dark violet before aging. it is the action of metal salts (iron or copper sulfate) which, added to the tannic material (the gall nut), gives the black hue. leather is still the largest use of tannins of vegetable origin. the manufacture of leather is still the largest use of tannins of vegetable origin. the tannin extraction industry was in a desperate position because of the change in fashion. research on vegetable tanned leather has been able to produce much more supple leather through the inclusion of oils and other techniques. research on vegetable tanning has been able to produce much more supple leather through the inclusion of oils and other techniques. fast-setting \u201choneymoon\u201d separate application cold-setting adhesives for glulam and fingerjoints. development of strength visualized through rapid increase in percentage wood failure. development of zinc salts to accelerate hardening of non-fortified tannin adhesives for plywood. the second approach to extend the tannin with another abundant and natural material has led to the preparation of adhesives based on in situ copolymers of tannins and lignin [37] or copolymers of tannin and protein or soy flour [38], and the use of tannin\u2013furfuryl alcohol adhesive formulations. the second new constraint is the demand of most companies to eliminate formaldehyde emissions from tannin adhesive. tannin-based pharmaceuticals to cure intestine infections have long-time been marketed. they react with proteins irreversibly, thus neutralizing their activity. tannin\u2019s minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to reduce by 50% the cytopathogenicity induced by a number of viruses was used as an evaluation of their effectiveness. a number of commercially available tannins have been tested. it is the same reaction used in leather tannins and in their association with carbohydrates. it is the same reaction used in leather tannins and in their association with carbohydrates. hnodendron rotundifolium and other tannins have proven their effectiveness against ulcers by functioning as a protective coating of the gastrointestinal tract. wine, beer, and fruit juices naturally contain tannins. too low an amount of tannin and the beverage will be insipid and with no taste. tannin added to the wine, but it is considered particularly beneficial to do it. it is the antioxidant property of the polyphenolic groups of the tannin which gives to it the powerful anticardiovascular effect. addition of tannin as well as addition of tannin-rich oak wood chips to wine is now completely legal in Europe. the slower the radical decay the lesser the radical degradation of the material to which tannin is added, hence the better the antioxidant properties of the tannin. furfural preferred to form methylene bridges with the flavonoids A ring. a number of mixed species bound by both types of linkages were formed. species formed by mixed co-reaction of two, three, and four different reagents in the mix were identified. foams with the most reactive tannins of the procyanidin type, such as pine tannin, have been tested and are totally fire resistant. a number of applications have been developed for these foams. open-cell foams have been used for very good acoustic insulation. bone tissue engineering relies on conformal biomaterial scaffolds, osteocompetent cells, and biologically active agents. porous tannin spray dried powder (PTSDP) has been approved for human use. PTSDP scaffolds with defined geometry, porosity, and mechanical properties were made by mixing PTSDP and hydroxyapatite (PO4) 6 (OH) 2. tannins are able to adsorb copper (12.5%) and lead (20.1%) ions in their structures. tannins are able to adsorb copper (12.5%) and lead (20.1%) ions in their structures. ethanolamine and mimosa tannins are water soluble. anpho-tannins used as industrial flocculants for clay suspensions in municipal water treatment. tannins are used as coagulants of particles in polluted waters. anticorrosive coatings are a practical way of prevention. tannins can be used as anticorrosive metal primers. the reason for the coupling of tannins with metals is, for example, the formation of orthodiphenol hydroxyl groups on the B rings of a flavonoid tannin. these coordinate complexes are due, for example, to the orthodiphenol hydroxyl groups on the B rings of a flavonoid tannin. lithology is one of the factors to be considered. the selection of a drilling fluid is more stringent due to the needs of thermal stability of the drilling fluid system. high temperatures can cause chemical alterations of various drilling fluid components. zinc lignosulfonate (CaLS) is dissolved in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid for decalcification. the amount of CaLS added to the solution depends on the weight ratio between CaLS and the desired tannin. the solution is dried in a vacuum oven at a temperature of 60 \u00b0C for 48 h. condensation and crosslinking reaction of mimosa tannin extract and a flavonoid monomer model with triethyl phosphate has been studied. reaction occurs at the C3 of the flavonoid heterocycle and the flavonoid B-ring\u2019s aromatic carbons, but not on the flavonoid B-ring\u2019s C4 and C5 aromatic carbons. densities were in the 0.048 to 0.066 g/cm3 range and compression strengths in the 0.07 to 0.09 MPa range. they present open pores with average cell sizes in the 125 to 250 m range, peak water absorption up to 98% by volume, and a residual pH of 5. they do not present phytotoxicity for preserving freshly cut flowers. the wattle extract powder should be added at level of 4 to 5% of the total starch content of the mix. successful results can be achieved in the range of 2 to 12% of the total starch content. the final level is determined by the degree of water hardness and desired bond quality. pre-aminated mimosa tannin extract was reacted with a mimosa tannin extract. this reaction proceeded easily at room temperature. oligomers generated isocyanate-free polyurethane linkages with aminated tannin. glucose-based NIPUs cured at a noticeably lower temperature. glucose NIPUs gave good results as a surface coating curing at 103 \u00b0C. sucrose NIPUs performed well only at a much higher curing temperature. tannin-based polyurethanes are obtained by this route, but other natural polyols do exist that are much more adapted to the formation of polyurethanes by reaction with isocyanates. new material is synthesized by the reaction of tannin and furfuryl alcohol, two inexpensive vegetable chemicals. the same bio-sourced tannin\u2013furanic thermosetting resin has been used as a resin matrix for angle grinder disks. a fiberglass mesh support was used for the abrasive powder and the green resin matrix yielded a rather easy manufacturing process. aluminum dioxide was the abrasive used. analysis of reaction products shows the presence of a by-product of the benzodioxane group, which then decreases the average epoxy functionality. more recent work has appeared on the preparation and characterization of condensed tannin epoxies [128,129]. the synthesis conditions of gallic tetra epoxy acid has been recently published. only resins with only two or three groups were reported before. this work established a relationship between different phenol monomer chemical structures and their reactivity with epichlorhydrin. composites were tested for different characteristics, such as surface hardness, water contact angles, influence of fiber morphology, and others, always yielding good results. a nonwoven web of hemp fibers and the composite obtained by impregnation with a tannin\u2013furanic resin influenced the composite characteristics. oligomers formed were determined by the tannin\u2013furanic impregnated papers. abrasion resistance was influenced for both types of coatings by the impregnated papers moisture content. ten-layer high pressure paper laminates of this type improved the dry shear strength of plywood to which they were applied as a surface coating. oligomers produced by amination of a flavonoid tannin and simultaneous self-condensation of furfuryl alcohol have been shown to be linked to reactive flavonoid tannin sites. methylene\u2013furanic linear chains have also been shown to be linked to reactive flavonoid tannin sites. polyflavonoid tannins have the ability to complex Fe2+/Fe3+ and aluminum ions in cement by the ortho-diphenol hydroxyls on their B-rings. these characteristics make polyflavonoid tannins attractive as dispersants/superplasticizers for cement, composed mostly of Ca and Fe silicates and aluminates. black ink, emblematic of the monastic scriptorium, was the most used in Europe between the twelfth and nineteenth centuries. the particularity of this ink lies in its absence of pigment or dye. it is the action of metal salts (iron or copper sulfate) which, added to the tannic material (the gall nut), gives the black hue, most often dark violet before aging. vegetable tanning is still the main industrial use of vegetable tannins. it has regained some interest for soft leathers either in combination with oils or with synthetic resins. however, the potential for future expansion is rather limited. a few new tannin extraction factories have been created in the last decade. competition with other bio-sourced materials already available as waste or obtained by other already existing production sources is rather intense at present. medical and pharmaceutical applications are one of the more interesting and active fields of research at present for the evaluation of vegetable tannins. corrugated cardboard adhesives are used in a few developing countries for a niche industrial market. they are used for moisture proofing of starch-bonded corrugated cardboard boxes for fruit exports having to pass through humid conditions, such as in the tropics. patents on the subject have been created."}
