{"summary": "acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults is a consequence of lung damage caused by either pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease. Survivors often suffer from an impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL), mental and physical impairments, and persistent inability to work. interventional studies, which often have highly selected populations, were excluded. the examined population had to consist of survivors of ARDS or acute lung injury (ALI) determinants, and HRQoL and/or RtW, in survivors of ARDS or ALI had to be reported. an instrument was developed by three authors (FDS, SuB, and CA) based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, for cohort and case-control studies (e5) each study was evaluated independently by two persons. selection bias Description of the study population: Sufficient specifications about the inclusion and exclusion criteria. the entire cohort/sample was not drawn randomly from the population of interest Unclear Loss to follow-up in the cohort In the case of a longitudinal study with several (>2) follow-ups, assessment of adequacy should only consider and evaluate the last follow-up. if this number is not documented, the 80%\u2013rule still applies. protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO (CRD42014014335) (e2) Inclusion criteria To ensure the highest possible external validity of the results found in the studies, only observational studies were excluded. interventional studies, which often have highly selected populations, were excluded. underlying diagnostic criteria of ARDS/ALI, sex, and age were recorded. effect sizes and significance of the investigated determinants were recorded whenever this had been documented or could be calculated from the indicated statistical values. for each case, it must be determined whether sampling was random. if inclusion started at ARDS diagnosis, yet the statements are only given for follow-up of survivors from this sample at 6 months, the category \u201eunclear\u201c must be selected. the same applies to the absence of specifications about the total population for which the studied cohort/sample should be representative. results The electronic search revealed 4559 studies. the size of the investigated cohorts/samples ranged from N = 15 to N = 152. cross-sectional study designs (19 studies) outweighed designs with prospective and retrospective data collection approaches. cross-sectional Canada AECC SF-36 48 Md = 48 IQR = 39\u201361 Adhikari et al.
