{"summary": "enteric fever is an all encompassing term for the disease caused by several serovars of Salmonella enterica including (S.) Typhi and (S.)Paratyphi A. typhoid causes a greater disease burden and there is a superior level of understanding of this organism. typhoid infections S. Typhi causes typhoid, a fecal-oral infection leading to systemic disease. tissue invasion drives a potentially close encounter with the immune system. tissue invasion drives a close encounter with the immune system. surrogate hosts and S. enterica serotypes (e.g. S. Typhimurium) suggest tissue invasion occurs predominantly through M cells on Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum. infection eventually localizes to the bone marrow and ultimately the gall bladder where the internal transmission cycle is completed. the genetic basis of the switch from an enteric to a systemic lifestyle is imprinted in its genetic makeup. many genes associated with intestinal persistence (e.g. shdA, ratB) are inactivated, limiting potential mechanisms for colonizing within and between hosts. invading S. Typhi may follow a simple default pathway favoring limiting activation of the inflammatory response. the lack of immune selection on the organism suggests that S. Typhi predominantly occupies an privileged niche within the host. many systemic pathogens exhibit the ability to undergo antigenic variation, thus allowing the organism to divert the immune response. the lack of immune protection in typhoid patients to re-infection further supports a dampening of immunity. typhoid endemic areas many individuals who have never reported typhoid exhibit serological evidence that they have been infected by the pathogen. typhoid diagnosis is limiting factor to typhoid diagnosis. it is worth speculating that alternative culture systems could encourage more facilities to be established in poorer regions. it is also worth noting that in a single tropical setting blood infections may be caused by other gram negative and gram positive organisms. diagnostic, the Widal test, was developed in 1896. the method is dependent on agglutination; S. Typhi cells are used to detect antibodies in blood. this crude assay is a visual test that monitors agglutinating antibodies. antibodies even though they have no clinical record of typhoid. such raised antibody levels frequently cannot be detected in patients with culture confirmed typhoid. problems have been encountered during the testing of commercial serological tests. many PCR-based assays have targeted the fliC gene. there is an additional sensitivity benefit of PCR, in that it can theoretically amplify DNA from dead or unculturable bacteria. however, we believe PCR offers only limited potential for typhoid diagnostics. typhoid patients may have between a 1,000 to 45,000 times more dead bacteria than live bacteria in the blood. we recently found disappointingly poor PCR sensitivity using a three color real-time PCR assay that was capable of detecting S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A and an incorporated internal control. an expansive, yet costly option would be to take an approach based on human microarrays. analysis of RNA extracted from the blood of typhoid patients could be performed to identify specific genes, pathways, interactions or transcriptional regulatory hubs that are activated in the host during infection. surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy has also been used in studying SARS protein biomarkers. some early studies focused on the detection of S. Typhi antigens such as Vi in the urine of patients. developing countries with typhoid should be prepared to evaluate new diagnostics as they evolve. it may be prudent to investigate specialized growth media that favor the regeneration of S. Typhi from blood. advances in this field would require the capture and amplification from a smaller number from blood or other bodily fluids. authors' contributions SB, MF and GD were responsible for the concept, the content and the writing of the manuscript. all authors have read and approved this manuscript."}
