{"summary": "the WHO requested a systematic review of the literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients. in total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria. 8,000 cases and 774 deaths occurred worldwide in 2003. the best way to treat this new disease was unknown. not many drugs are effective against viruses, and all doctors can do with a viral disease is to treat specific symptoms. the WHO group wanted to know how these treatments affected the virus outside the body and whether it helped the condition of patients and reduced the death rate. they did no new work with patients or in the laboratory. they conducted a comprehensive search of the scientific and medical literature for published studies that fitted their carefully predefined selection criteria. a global outbreak of SARS between March 2003 and July 2003 caused over 8,000 probable or confirmed cases and 774 deaths. the causative organism has been identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2\u20134] the overall mortality during the outbreak was estimated at 9.6% [5,6]. ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), corticosteroids, type I IFN, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or convalescent plasma. the types of study we included were: (1) in vitro studies, in which the authors examined inhibition of SARS-CoV viral replication, and data from an assay in human or animal cell line. the level of evidence was independently classified by two authors. a control group was considered a likely source of bias. a control group was considered a likely source of bias. \u201cDefinite harm\u201d if a study contained statistically significant evidence of harm demonstrated in a double-blind randomized trial. a control group was considered a likely source of bias if there were differences in co-morbidities, sex, age and markers of severe disease compared to the treatment group. a control group was considered valid if randomized, or if patient characteristics and illness severity were comparable to the treatment group. clinical evidence of SARS treatment in humans was reported in 54 studies (37 in English, 17 in Chinese) three studies addressed treatment of ARDS (Figure 1). in the Chinese literature six additional reports described patients with SARS treated with ribavirin (often with steroids) these six reports were determined to be inconclusive in the evaluation of treatment for SARS. lopinavir inhibits cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in fetal rhesus monkey kidney cells. no studies were found on the cytopathic effect of corticosteroids alone against SARS-CoV. corticosteroids act as immunomodulatory agents. studies to measure direct antiviral effects in vitro were not expected. three clinical trials examined the effect of corticosteroids on mortality in patients with established ARDS. high-dose methylprednisolone given for approximately 2 d was not effective for early ARDS [25,26] one small RCT that used a regimen of lower dose methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg per day) showed possible evidence of ARDS improvement. in the Chinese literature, one additional study reported the use of IFN- as part of a regimen that included ribavirin and steroids. a variety of treatments given masked the effect of IFN- alone. Convalescent plasma and IVIG act as immunomodulatory agents. studies to measure direct antiviral effects in vitro were not expected. formal assessment classified 20 studies as \u201cinconclusive\u201d due to study design or because the effect of ribavirin could not be distinguished from the effects of other treatments (such as steroids and antiviral drugs) four publications presented evidence of possible harm (14\u201317) three of these studies documented a fall in haemoglobin levels after ribavirin treatment when compared to levels in patients before treatment. four publications presented evidence of possible harm (14\u201317) three of these studies documented a fall in haemoglobin levels after ribavirin treatment compared to levels in patients before treatment. one study noted that over 29% of SARS patients had some degree of liver dysfunction indicated by ALT levels higher than normal. LPV/r use was compared among three groups of patients. patients also received ribavirin and corticosteroids. death rate was lower than among those who received ribavirin and corticosteroids. LPV/r was added as an initial treatment to ribavirin and corticosteroid therapy. the death rate was lower than among those who received ribavirin and corticosteroids. a second study of this regimen reported fewer episodes of ARDS or death compared with historical controls who had not received LPV/r. no additional studies were identified from the Chinese literature. corticosteroid use within the first week of illness was associated with delayed viral clearance. the other study, which was case-controlled, found that patients with psychosis received higher cumulative doses of steroids than patients without psychosis. twelve studies were inconclusive and two showed possible harm. 107 patients treated with high-dose methylprednisolone (0.5\u20131 mg/kg prednisolone on day 3 of illness) followed by hydrocortisolone 100 mg every 8 h, and pulse-doses of methylprednisolone 0.5 g IV for 3 d. two studies contained evidence of possible harm from corticosteroids [21,22] antiviral effects have been demonstrated in monkey (Vero; Vero-E6), fetal rhesus monkey kidney (fRhK-4), and human (Caco2, CL14, and HPEK) cell lines. three reports presented evidence that IFN- was superior against SARS-CoV compared to IFN- and found rIFN-2 virtually ineffective against SARS-CoV compared to other IFNs [28]. three reports presented evidence that IFN- was superior against SARS-CoV compared to IFN- and found rIFN-2 virtually ineffective against SARS-CoV compared to other IFNs [28]. synergistic effects were reported for leukocytic IFN- with ribavirin [13], IFN- with ribavirin [12,13] and IFN- with IFN- [28,29]. in the Chinese literature, two additional studies reported evidence on the effect of convalescent plasma as a treatment for SARS [30,31]. these studies were inconclusive. no studies were found on the cytopathic effect of this treatment on SARS-CoV. corticosteroids were commonly prescribed to SARS patients with worsening pulmonary disease or progressing abnormalities on chest X-rays. it is difficult to make a clear recommendation about whether corticosteroids should be used to treat SARS-associated lung injury in any stage of illness. the inclusion of patients without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection in this review could cause an underestimate of any true effect on SARS. the variation in treatment regimens\u2014particularly the wide range in doses, duration of therapy, and route of administration of ribavirin and corticosteroids\u2014is a major obstacle to a clear interpretation.
