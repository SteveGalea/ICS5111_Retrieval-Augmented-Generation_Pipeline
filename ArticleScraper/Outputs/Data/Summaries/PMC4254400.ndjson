{"summary": "dietary zinc oxide supplementation has shown antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo. results suggest higher levels of dietary ZnO do not have the potential to stimulate or modulate systemic immune responses after vaccination. results are shown as average frequencies of virus-specific IFN-gamma-SC per 2.5 105 PBMC. empty symbols indicate results obtained after in vitro restimulation with the same PRRSV used for infections."}
