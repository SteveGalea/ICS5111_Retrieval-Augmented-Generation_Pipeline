{"summary": "the poliovirus genome is encapsidated in a non-enveloped icosahedral virion. the virion attaches to human cells via the receptor CD155 [2], and binding initiates an irreversible conformational change in the capsid [3,4] a recent review by Paul and Wimmer includes details on the process of poliovirus replication after cell entry. microscopy of poliovirus-infected cells began 60 years ago to document the wide-ranging morphological changes that occur within infected cells. report detailed the first visible cellular changes, appearing by three hours post infection (hpi), using phase light microscopy at 100 magnification [17]. in 1958, electron microscopy was first used to visualize details of cytopathic effects and ultrastructure changes in poliovirus-infected cells. poliovirus replication and virally induced lipid biosynthesis are coupled. poliovirus replication and virally induced lipid biosynthesis are coupled. fluorescence correlation spectroscopy [38] Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching [38] Cholesterol may counter over-fluidity caused by PI4P a,b Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy [39] Poliovirus protein 2BC Activates PI4KIII to generate more PI4P a,b Stimulates host OSBP activity [40] Poliovirus protein 3A Recruits clathrin-mediated cholesterol-rich endosome PI4P and cholesterol are enriched in the newly synthesized membrane structures. phospholipid-modifying enzyme PI4KIII is recruited to the replication site by poliovirus 3A. this resulting in a local elevation of its catalyzed product PI4P. membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids in poliovirus-infected cells. observed non-uniform distribution of free cholesterol, segregated into patches, in poliovirus-infected cells [41] strongly suggests lipid rafts play a similar role in poliovirus replication. ER membrane structures have been proposed to be, at least partially, the origin of poliovirus-induced vesicles [30,49] it has also been shown that an individual viral protein is capable of invaginating liposomes [51], suggesting viral proteins directly, in the absence of cellular proteins, are sufficient for membrane remodeling. poliovirus-induced blebbing from the ER membrane is observed by electron microscopy at 3\u20133.5 hpi vesicles appear within the cytoplasm [52,53,54,55]. vesicles become more numerous over the course of infection, until the cytoplasm is vesicle-filled, as seen by electron microscopy of thin-sectioned cells [18,53,54]. infected cells are marked as nuclear membrane (blue), mitochondria (red), vacuoles (orange) lines denote cytoplasm, and dots represent viroplasm. first morphological changes within the infected cell are apparent in the ER at 2.5 hpi. the lumenal space in the endoplasmic reticulum is enlarged, forming structures described as \u201cnuclear extrusions\u201d by Mattern and Daniel [57]. these extended, altered endoplasmic reticulum-derived structures appear adjacent to newly formed perinuclear membranous structures. poliovirus-induced vesicles derive from such nuclear extrusions. at 5 hpi vesicles range in size from 100\u2013200 nm in diameter. by 7 hpi, there are more double membrane vesicles, as well as fewer single membrane vesicles. poliovirus capsids are visible dispersed through the vesicle clusters. morphology of poliovirus-induced vesicles has been investigated for nearly 60 years. the morphology of poliovirus-induced vesicles has been investigated for nearly 60 years. diagram of an uninfected HeLa cell, schematized from Schlegel et al., 1996, provides a point of reference for cell morphology changes that are visible in poliovirus-infected cells. results from different groups show similar features and are consistent with what we describe here. belov et al. [55] collected three-dimensional data and have shown that what appeared to be vesicles in two dimensions are, in fact, inter-connected branching tubular structures. the endoplasmic reticulum itself has undergone a transformation by 3 hpi. poliovirus-induced vesicles derive from such nuclear extrusions. at 5 hpi vesicles range in size from 100\u2013200 nm in diameter. clusters of vesicles are on the order of 1\u20132 m across. by 7 hpi, there are more double membrane vesicles, as well as fewer single membrane vesicles. more oval structures appear to be better separated, and less convoluted, with larger interior regions than the membranous structures visible at 3 and 4 hpi. some of these double membrane structures have gated lumenal areas, with a roughly round central lumen of diameter 250 nm and a gate opening of 20 nm. fractionation successfully separates RNA replication factories from virions. vesicles associated with replication are distinct from those associated with protein translation or virion packaging. morphology of rosette isolated from poliovirus-infected cells appears to be conserved. if there are independent membrane formation paths for different viral roles, this could explain the observed presence in replication factories of markers from different cellular origins. vesicles are invaginated from tubules into vesicles, and U-bodies. only a fraction of the membranous structures are involved in active RNA replication within lumenal spaces. for virus assembly, (+) RNA interacts with membrane-associated capsid protein pentamers on membranes that are distinct from replication factory membranes. poliovirus morphology and other (+) RNA viruses all appear to produce single membrane tubular structures. RNA replication occurs within vesicle lumenal regions for multiple (+) RNA viruses (e.g., [79,80,81,82]. the complex cellular changes that occur throughout infection require specialized phospholipid biosynthesis that evolves over the time of infection. each vesicle population serves specialized roles that support the poliovirus replication processes."}
