{"summary": "the only hospital that remained open on the peninsula reported a 40% increase in emergency department visits during the immediate aftermath of the storm. the Rockaways were profoundly affected by the storm, but did not receive the immediate influx of recovery efforts that other areas of NYC (e.g., Manhattan) received. each cluster was defined as a 10-block region covering roughly half of the peninsula, including 7 of its 11 neighborhoods. teams were assigned to 10-block clusters with a goal of completing 7 to 10 well-spaced, random household interviews per cluster. each team began at a randomly selected location within their 10-block radius. the survey was administered 3 weeks after hurricane sandy over a 3-day period from November 17\u201319, 2012. immediate needs were relayed to local medical and service volunteer groups as well as the NYC Department of Health. if emergent medical need was identified, teams were instructed to call 911. questionnaire was developed from selected questions from the CDC\u2019s CASPER toolkit. questions included demographics, type of housing unit, current source of heat and electricity, and basic health information. questions included transportation and health. Enumerators visited 208 households on the Rockaway Peninsula. Approximately 40% of households approached did not answer the door. ten percent of households refused to participate in the study.

P =.024) poor lighting in previous studies and can be attributed to the persistent loss of electricity. this may partly be attributed to the seasonality of pathogens in the northeastern united states in November. many respondents had difficulty acquiring prescription medications, and one third reported that if help were needed they would have to venture outside the Rockaways. hurricane sandy caused significant and uniform disruption in infrastructure to all areas regardless of SES. but 2 associations with SES were found to be significant. a trend for those from a lower SES to have increased significant psychological stress. rapid needs assessment tools are limited by temporal constraints, and the disaster itself, because of areas that were difficult to access, lack of electricity, and security measures. the strengths of this study include an established systematic post-hurricane survey methodology, fairly comprehensive coverage of an urban oceanfront peninsula that was severely affected. public health officials should consider focusing on intensive public health education and preparedness. health care recovery efforts should assist those who may have difficulty accessing care, such as the elderly and the debilitated. enumerators were selected from volunteers trained on site, possibly leading to different methods of ascertaining information. this could lead to artificially increased variability in respondent answers or inaccuracy in our measurements of some questions. this bias could diminish the power of logistic regression analysis. our small sample size may contribute to bias, but this is an inherent limitation of a needs assessment tool conducted after a natural disaster. the absence of police presence and light led to a heightened sense of insecurity, which may be ameliorated by rapid deployment of floodlighting."}
