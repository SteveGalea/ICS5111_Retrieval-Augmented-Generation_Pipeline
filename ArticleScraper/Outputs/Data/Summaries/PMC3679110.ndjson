{"summary": "duck enteritis virus (DEV), a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of the order anseriformes, is an acute, contagious virus infection that naturally occurs in ducks, geese and swans. in susceptible flocks, this disease can be transmitted by direct contact or indirectly through environmental contamination. it causes significant economic losses in domestic and wild waterfowl as a result of mortality, and decreased egg production. resveratrol was tested for antiviral activity against DEV. it is also a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of the herpesviridae. this paper aims to evaluate the antiviral properties of resveratrol. the cytotoxic effect of resveratrol on DEFs monolayers was determined by quantifying the cell viability using an MTT (3-[4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Sigma, USA) assay. dilution medium without the sample was used as control. the unabsorbed virus washed with PBS and medium only with dilutions of the test samples were added to the plates respectively. the concentrations of the test samples were equal or less than MNCC. the virus-infected cells without drug treatment and the un-infected cells were used as the controls. the primers and probe were designed using the Primer software. the upstream and downstream primer sequences were 5\u2032-CCCAAACACGAAACATGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- TGTCCGGTTACAATATCGTT -3\u2032 respectively. the probe was synthesized by Invitrogen Trading CO., LTD. (Shanghai China) equal volumes of resveratrol solution and a concentrated virus suspension were placed in a tube for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. mixture without the test sample was used as control. the infectious virus that remained in the drug was diluted 100-fold (MOI = 0.1) then added in cell monolayers, incubating for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. DNA was extracted from DEV infected DEFs at an MOI of 0.1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then washed with PBS and overlaid with resveratrol solutions. wells overlaid with MEM without test sample were used as the control. ultrathin (100 nm, Leica UC6), longitudinal sections were then cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. indirect immunofluorescence assay The cells grown in coverslips infected with DEV (MOI = 0.1) were incubated in the presence or absence of resveratrol. FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody was obtained from Boster (Wuhan, P.R. China). cells and virus Duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) were propagated in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) the 50% half cell toxicity (CC50) value was calculated as the extract concentration necessary to reduce cell viability by 50%. the maximum non-cytotoxic concentration was defined as the maximum concentration of the sample that did not exert a significant cytotoxic effect (P0.01) based on the OD values. TCID50 of the cell supernatant of each well was determined in DEFs with 10-fold serially diluted virus incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. titers in TCID50/50 L were determined according to the Reed and Muench method [18]. data analysis was performed using bio-Rad CFX96TM Manager software. the number of target copies in the reaction was deduced from the threshold cycle (C T) values corresponding to the C T values of the serial 10-fold dilutions of standard DNA samples. the total DNA was extracted from DEV-infected DEFs at the indicated time points (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection [p.i.] MEM supplemented with 2% CS was added to the cultures after removal of virus inoculums. pre-treatment assay Resveratrol solutions were added in cell monolayers and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. copies of DEV were detected by real-time FQ-PCR assay. incubation for 48 h, total DNA was extracted from DEV infected DEFs. copies of DEV were detected by the real-time FQ-PCR assay. DEFs grown in coverslips infected with DEV (MOI = 0.1) were incubated in the presence or absence of resveratrol according to the method used for the antiviral activity assay. at 48 h p.i., the monolayers were washed and scraped away by using a cell scraper. the cells were washed and incubated with 10% goat anti-rabbit antibody overnight at 37\u00b0C. after washing, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed and directly observed using a fluorescence microscope. DEFs were infected with DEV (TCID50) and then treated with resveratrol. after incubation for 72 h, the supernatants were collected and analyzed. DEV proliferated in the DEFs in the presence or absence of reveratrol within 72 h. total DNA was extracted at the indicated time points (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i.) copies of DEV were detected by the real-time FQ-PCR assay. total DNA was extracted at the indicated time points (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i.) copies of DEV were detected via real-time FQ-PCR assay. resveratrol was added to the DEFs in various ways. DEFs infected with DEV (MOI = 0.1) were treated with resveratrol in various mode of actions. the virus and drug mixture was then added to cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the media was removed and replaced with drug-free media. when resveratrol was added to DEFs at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h p.i., the viral titers were dramatically decreased compared with the control group. the viral titer also decreased when the administration time was 8 h p.i., but virus vitality was significantly higher than the other administration time. resveratrol was added to the cells after inoculums removal. at 48 h p.i., the cells were collected and studied by TEM. the typical signs of DEV infection are as follows. DEFs were exposed to resveratrol followed by incubation with DEV. at 24 h p.i., antigen expression was detected via immunostaining with anti-DEV antibodies. DEFs were infected with DEV (MOI = 0.1) in the absence (A) or presence (C) of 31.25 g/mL resveratrol. DEFs without any treatment was used as control (B) c CC50(g/mL)c SId Resveratrol 3.850.08 61.070.24 15.86 a inhibition effects on DEV were evaluated by MTT assay. c Cytotoxic concentration 50% (CC50) concentration required to reduce cell viability by 50%. the DEV proliferated in the DEFs in the presence or absence of reveratrol. total DNA was extracted at the indicated time points (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i.) copies of DEV were detected by the real-time FQ-PCR assay. the total DNA was extracted at the indicated time points (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h p.i.) copies of DEV were detected via real-time FQ-PCR assay. resveratrol proliferated in the DEFs in the presence or absence of reveratrol. DEFs infected with DEV were treated with resveratrol for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the virus and drug mixture was then added to cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the media was removed and replaced with drug-free media. resveratrol was added to DEFs at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h p.i. the viral titer decreased when the administration time was 8 h p.i., but virus vitality was significantly higher than the other administration time. only a slight difference in the inhibitory effect was observed when resveratrol was added at different p.i. time points within 6 h (0, 2, 4, and 6 h p.i.) resveratrol was added to the infected cells after inoculums removal. at 48 h p.i., the cells were collected and studied by TEM. DEFs were exposed to resveratrol followed by incubation with DEV. at 24 h p.i., antigen expression was detected via immunostaining with anti-DEV antibodies. DEFs were infected with DEV (MOI = 0.1) in the absence (A) or presence (C) of 31.25 g/mL resveratrol. DEFs without any treatment was used as control (B) resveratrol was widely studied for its anti-proliferative mechanisms by inducing reactive oxygen species production and disrupting the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial membrane. in traditional antiviral research, the antiviral activities of test samples were confirmed mainly based on their capability to reduce virus titer. resveratrol affected the early stage of the DEV replication cycle. a host nuclear transcription factor activated by HSV infection was suppressed by resveratrol. the synthesis of viral DNA was impaired by resveratrol. resveratrol could inhibit DNA of ASFV replication, late viral protein synthesis and viral factory formation. resveratrol could effectively inhibit DEV in host cells. resveratrol does not inactivate the virus in an extracellular manner."}
