{"summary": "endothelium provides a barrier, regulates vascular tension, and is involved in angiogenesis and haemostasis. local and systemic inflammation, however, can impair endothelial function and can lead to cellular damage increasing endothelial permeability and loss of epithelial barrier function. a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in the ECs occurs through Ca2+ influx or by release from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum. the ca2+ stores are refilled by the SER-membrane-located sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) [28] SERCA plays an important role in the Ca2+ homeostasis [24], [30], [ poly I:C was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia, -DNA from Fermentas (SD0021), LY-294002 and 2,5-Di-t-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) was received from Sigma. all chemicals were dissolved and diluted to the desired concentration. measurements were carried out at 37\u00b0C. hPAECs were grown until confluence on semi-permeable inserts. FITC-labelled dextran was added to upper compartment of the insert. PCR amplifications were performed by AB7900 (Applied Biosystems) using the following primers: Hs_GAPDH_2_SG (QT01192646) - GAPDH, Hs_ATP2A3_1_SG (QT00087220) - SERCA3; and the SYBR Green I Master Mix (Qiagen) the cells were blocked for 30 min with 3% BSA in PBS at RT. the cells were incubated for 35 min with goat anti-mouse antibody. the cells were counterstained with DAPI to identify the nuclear DNA. blots were incubated overnight with 11000 diluted primary antibody at 4\u00b0C. cells were cultured on gelatine coated, 25 mm glass cover slips. after reaching confluence, they were treated for 24 h with 25 g/mL poly I:C, 25 g/mL dsRNA, 2.5 g/mL -DNA, 2.5 g/mL total RNA or left untreated. [Ca2+]i was calculated as described by Grynkiewicz et al. [36]. cells were treated with 1 mol/L ionomycin (maximal ratio) and then chelated all free Ca2+ with 10 mmol/L EGTA (minimal ratio) cells that did not respond to ionomycin were discarded. cell growth and proliferation assays Cells were plated at a density of 104 cells/well in 2%FBS/Medium in 96-well plates. the concentration- dependent effect of 24 h incubation with poly I:C, dsRNA, totalRNA, -DNA, LY-294002 or BHQ on growth and proliferation of hPAECs was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation as an index of DNA synthesis. non-silencing RNA (siCTL, Control siRNA-A, sc-37007, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was mixed with 500.000 hPAECs and 100 l of Basic Nucleofector Solution from Basic Endothelial Cells Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) this mixture was electroporated according to the manufacturers\u2019 instruction. cell culture Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs) were obtained from Lonza (allendale, New Jersey) the endothelial specific media (VascuLife, Lifeline) was changed every third day. solutions and Chemicals Poly I:C was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia. hPAECs were grown until confluence on semi-permeable inserts. the TEER values were recorded every 30 min for the first 5 hours. the measurements were carried out at 37\u00b0C. total cellular RNA from hPAECs was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen. the protocol for purification of total RNA from cells using spin technology was followed (Cat. No./ID: 74104). the cells were fixed with a buffer containing 100 mL phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) pH 7, 650 mg Na2HPO4, 400 mg NaH2PO4, 1.5 mL Methanol, 10 mL 4% Formaldehyde. slides were washed with pre-warmed Hepes buffered saline solution (HBSS) for 20 min at room temperature. 35 min washing steps with PBS were performed and followed by the coverslips were incubated with Alexa488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) the distribution of the signal was imaged using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U photomicroscope with epifluorescent capabilities connected to a digital camera (Spot RT KE) the single glass cover slip was mounted on the stage of a Zeiss 200 M inverted epifluorescence microscope coupled to a polyChrome V monochromator. the emitted light was collected at 510 nm by an air-cooled Andor Ixon camera. the acquired images were stored and processed offline with TillVision software. the driver program MFP Xop was written in IGOR Pro software. the cells were cultured on gelatine-coated 15 mm diameter glass cover slips. the cells were treated with 25 g/mL Poly I:C or left untreated. the cells were triedpsinized, centrifuged for 5 min at 220g at 4\u00b0C, and then washed with 10 ml PBS. the pellet was re-suspended and again centrifuged for 5 min at 220g at 4\u00b0C and dissolved in 500 l PBS. the basal level of Ca2+ was determined as an average value of the first 50 seconds of the curve. the plateau duration is the time from the maximum Ca2+ peak height until the intracellular Ca2+ declines to the basal level. concentration\u2013inhibition curves were constructed from the FCS-induced proliferation in the absence of Poly I:C. 24 h incubation with -DNA had no significant effect (9815% of control) double-stranded RNA decreased transendothelial electric resistance and increased FITC-dextran permeability through hPAECs monolayers. an elongation of the poly I:C treated cells and the appearance of rearranged fiber structures was observed on the actin staining (Figure 2A, B) the amplitude image of the control hPAECs showed a regular cell shape as seen in Figure 2C. the poly I:C treatment was also associated with a time dependent stiffening of the cells (Figure 2E). the continuous membrane staining for both VE-cadherin and ZO-1 caused disruption of the endothelial barrier integrity. the VE-cadherin and ZO-1 membrane staining either disappeared or became discontinuous. stainings showed a cumulative effect of poly I:C and LY-294002 (PI3-Kinase blocker) with a total disappearance of both proteins from the cell membrane. the FITC-labelled dextran traffic was significantly increased by 24 hours of LY-294002 (152.1024.18%) this effect was additive with the Poly I:C effect, leading to a 501.808.27% increase in the amount of transmitted fluorescent dextran molecules. dsRNA incubation significantly prolonged the 100 M histamine-induced Ca2+ signal in the absence of extracellular calcium. dsRNA treatment caused a delay in the clearance of cytoplasmic Ca2+, which is necessary for replication. protocol baseline(nM Ca) SD Nr. of cells Ca2+ control 128.21 75.89 41 Ca2+-free control 134.13 90.84 59 Ca2+-free Poly I:C 108.43 77.90 44 Ca2+ Poly I:C 110.72 110.92 29 Table 2. Prolonged histamine-induced Ca2+ plateau in hPAECs after Poly I:C incubation accompanied by SERCA downregulation and phospholamban de arco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump results are from 3 independent experiments each performed in triplicates. results are from 3 independent western blot experiments each performed in triplicates. results are from 3 independent experiments each performed in triplicates. the effect was similar to that of dsRNA or Poly I:C. BHQ treatment led to disruption of the VE-cadherin staining. this effect was accompanied by increase in the endothelial permeability. siRNA treatment against SERCA3 protects the hPAECs from poly I:C induced permeability and junctional changes. silencing of SERCA3 abolished the FITC-dextran permeability increase of hPAECs caused by Poly I:C. -DNA, which is not a toll-like receptor 3 ligand [8], was used as a control. dsRNA and poly I:C disrupted the integrity of the endothelial monolayer. incubation with -DNA had no significant effect (9815% of control) results were obtained after poly I:C and total RNA treatment, but not with -DNA. an elongation of the poly I:C treated cells and the appearance of rearranged fiber structures was observed on the actin staining (Figure 2A, B) elongated cells were detected on the live cell atomic force microscopy images. vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) and Zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) staining caused disruption of endothelial barrier integrity. 24 h of poly I:C treatment caused disruption of the endothelial barrier integrity. poly I:C treatment resulted in a 35-fold upregulation of TLR-3 in hPAECs. however, both VE-cadherin and ZO-1 stainings showed a cumulative effect of Poly I:C and LY-294002 (PI3-Kinase blocker) with a total disappearance of both proteins from the cell membrane. poly I:C treatment, double-stranded RNA and -DNA treatment. the graph represents 3 independent experiments, each performed in triplicates. dsRNA incubation significantly prolonged the 100 M histamine-induced Ca2+ signal in the absence. histamine induced intracellular Ca2+ plateau in hPAECs after poly I:C incubation accompanied by SERCA downregulation and phospholamban dephosphorylation. traces of 100 M histamine induced intracellular Ca2+ rise under Ca2+-free (A) and Ca2+ (C) conditions showed a prolonged decay of intracellular Ca2+ level in hPAECs. bar graphs show expression of SERCA3 (E) and SERCA2b (F) isoform of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump. results are from 3 independent experiments each performed in triplicates. the phosphorylation of phospholamban, an endogenous inhibitor of SERCA, was assessed. after 24 h treatment a significant decrease in the phospholamban phosphorylation was observed. the inhibitory effect of dsRNA on the SERCA pump was expected. confocal microscopic images reveal that siSERCA3 treated hPAECs respond with less VE-cadherin signal loss compared to control. siRNA treatment against SERCA3 protects the hPAECs from poly I:C induced permeability. the precise mechanism by which circulating RNA induces endothelial barrier disruption in the lung has not been completely understood yet. our data showed that natural dsRNA treatment significantly decreased electric resistance indicating disruption in the hPAEC monolayer integrity. poly I:C treated cells presented with an intense peripheral actin staining accompanied by cellular shape changes visible on the immunofluorescent pictures. similar cytoskeletal rearrangement was shown to be induced by 6 h bluetongue virus infection in primary human microvascular endothelial cells. this could be explained by the differences between the human lung microvascular and arterial endothelial cells. the effect of PI3-kinase on SERCA expression was additive pointing to a PI3-kinase independent mechanism of action. the effect on downregulation of both isoforms was additive pointing to a PI3-Kinase independent mechanism of action. the key player of the Ca2+ store refilling is the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) [28] and its proper regulation is vital for normal cell function. an inhibitory effect of Poly I:C on SERCA is suggested by the increased duration of the phospholamban phosphorylation upon poly I:C treatment. a decrease in SERCA activity resulted in a delayed G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle. however, the expression of SERCA decreased upon poly I:C treatment, which could result in disturbance of cell cycle regulation. a dose and time-dependent accumulation of hPAECs in the G1-phase was observed.
