{"summary": "qualitative research team conducted 48 hours of observation in six wards from three government hospitals in 2007. they recorded environmental contamination with body secretions and excretions and medical waste. they recorded number of persons, number of open doors and windows, and use of fans. ward occupant handwashing and use of personal protective equipment. studies have shown that hospital-acquired respiratory infections occur at an incidence rate of 6.1 cases per 1000 patient-days [5], and diarrhea with an incidence rate of 3.9 cases among pediatric patients and 2.7 cases among adults per 1000 patient-days [6]. international infection control guidelines exist [7], [9], but assume a level of basic infrastructure. the study protocol was approved by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. sessions were held during three non-overlapping periods, three hours from 900 am\u2013230 pm, three hours from 330 pm\u2013900 pm and one hour from 1000 pm\u20131230 am. they recorded number of ward occupants-including patients, family caregivers, visitors and healthcare workers, use of fans and number of open doors and windows at the beginning and end of each session. study protocol approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the international Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. team collected data from one pediatric and one adult male medicine ward from each of three public tertiary teaching hospitals. conducted 48 hours of observation in 22 sessions. observing the disposal of waste, the reuse of medical equipment, and the soiling with body secretions. they also noted the presence of animals inside wards and waste disposal outside wards. each discussion included six to 11 participants and lasted 45 to 80 minutes. 2 2 8 For patients, visitors and support staff 3 1 4 2 4 2 Number of functioning bathrooms For patients, visitors and support staff 2 2 2 0 2 0 Number of functioning urinals For patients, visitors and support staff 2 2 2 0 2 0 Number of handwashing stations For doctors and nurses 1 0 1 2 4 6 For patients, visitors and support staff 0 0 0 2 0 Average number of persons per functioning toilet Doctors and nurses 5 \u2013 5 2 3 1 Patients, visitors and support median of 3.7 ward occupants were present per 10 m2 of floor space. pediatric wards were more crowded than adult wards. patients with potentially infectious diseases, such as diarrhea and encephalitis, were hospitalized in the same ward. median people present per 10 m2 by type of ward of the three hospitals, 2007. Since the hospitals were also teaching facilities, medical students accompanied senior physicians on their rounds. on one ward, 37 students accompanied two doctors for almost an hour. the team observed children crawling on the floor and playing with used syringes. only hospital C had separate cardboard boxes beside the nursing stations to discard used sharps. the team also observed mosquitoes in the wards. no persons were observed to wash hands after coughing or sneezing. only one family caregiver used a cloth mask while caring for the patient. floors were soiled 125 times in 48 hours. izers were used 14 times and no disinfectant was observed before or after use. ward occupants blew noses, coughed, sneezed, or vomited, and before ward occupants consumed food. handwashing with soap was observed on only 32 (1% of the 273 observed handwashing events) occasions. staff reported inadequate supplies of cleaning and disinfection products, bed sheets, soap and hand sanitizer. nurses and support staff reported using antiseptic liquid or saline to wash hands on some occasions when soap was not available. the wards had either an open floor plan or cubicles with four-foot high walls. most of the windows in Hospital A could not be opened, while Hospitals B and C were ventilated with ceiling fans, windows that could be opened and doors on opposite sides of the rooms to allow cross-ventilation. nurses 5 \u2013 5 2 3 1 Patients, visitors and support staff 17 48 25 27 14 63 Average number of persons per functioning handwashing station Doctors and nurses 5 \u2013 5 2 1 1 Patients, visitors and support staff \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 28. pediatric wards were more crowded than adult wards. patients with potentially infectious diseases, such as diarrhea and encephalitis, were hospitalized in the same ward with newborn babies and patients receiving chemotherapy. a median of 2.1 caregivers per 10 m2, compared to 1.3 patients and 0.2 healthcare workers. the team observed children crawling on the floor and playing with used syringes with needles. animals and insects Feral cats were commonly observed in all wards. all patients used mosquito nets at night in Hospitals A and C. most of the windows in Hospital A could not be opened, while Hospitals B and C were ventilated with ceiling fans. 0 0 0 2 0 Average number of persons per functioning toilet Doctors and nurses 5 \u2013 5 2 3 1 Patients, visitors and support staff 17 48 25 27 14 63 Average number of persons per functioning handwashing station Doctors and nurses 5 \u2013 5 2 3 1 1 Patients, visitors and support staff 17 48 25 27 14 63 Average number of persons per functioning handwashing station. s B and C had an average of 1.2 times more patients than beds. in hospitals B and C, two or three patients shared one bed. in hospital B, newborn babies were kept in the same ward with older children. a median of 2.1 caregivers per 10 m2, compared to 1.3 patients and 0.2 healthcare workers. in hospitals A and C, vendors moved from ward to ward selling tea, water or snacks. the team observed 6,033 coughs and 75 sneezes in 48 hours of observation. only 60 coughs and 20 sneezes were covered; four coughs were covered by a cloth and the rest by the cougher\u2019s or sneezer\u2019s hands. cleaners in all hospitals reported wet mopping wards two to three times daily. staff observed daily wet mopping only in Hospital A and weekly sweeping with water in hospital B. handwashing with soap was observed on only 32 (1% of the 273 observed handwashing events) occasions. handwashing with soap was observed on only 32 (1% of the 273 observed handwashing events) occasions. the team observed 6,033 coughs and 75 sneezes in 48 hours of observation. only 60 coughs and 20 sneezes were covered; four coughs were covered by a cloth and the rest by the cougher\u2019s or sneezer\u2019s hands. the team observed seven pediatric patients urinate on the floor near the entrance of the toilet area at night. stethoscopes, sphygmomanometers and clinical hammers were used 14 times. no disinfectant was observed before or after use. handwashing opportunities observed in three hospitals, 2007. During patient care Before giving food, drinks, or medicine either orally or through a nasogastric tube, before administering eye or ear drops, or before breastfeeding 552 Before and after giving injections, placing or removing canula or IV. nurses reported using antiseptic liquid or saline to wash hands on some occasions when soap was not available. nurses reported using surgical masks while making patient beds, which the team never observed. staff reported using gloves when caring for patients with infectious diseases. a cross-sectional study in surgical wards in a tertiary hospital reported transmission of Nipah encephalitis from a patient to a caregiver while sharing a bed. a number of diseases, such as SARS, Nipah virus, tuberculosis, measles, influenza, chickenpox, meningitis, mumps and aspergillosis can be spread by airborne or droplet transmission from coughing, hand hygiene is considered to be the single most effective measure of infection control [26] bacilli, coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) most hospital infections are acquired via direct contact [8], and hand contact is a major route of acquisition. lack of functioning and accessible handwashing stations in study wards is one reason that handwashing with soap was infrequent. this study was conducted in only three public tertiary hospitals that were not randomly chosen. the findings are consistent with other studies in Bangladeshi tertiary hospitals that have reported crowding in wards [38], improper waste disposal [34] and poor hygiene and sanitation facilities. edward et al."}
