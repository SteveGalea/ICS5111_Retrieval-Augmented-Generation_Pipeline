{"summary": "lentiviral gene therapy is an attractive therapeutic option for human glioblastoma. lentiviral vectors transduced cancer stem-like cells characterized by their CD133-, nestin- and SOX2-expression. lentiviral vectors transduced cancer stem-like cells characterized by their CD133-, nestin- and SOX2-expression. lentiviral pseudotyped vectors are promising candidates for gene therapy of glioma in patients. despite advances in neurosurgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the prognosis of patients remains poor with a median survival of 14 months. gammaretroviral vectors derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) have been the most frequently used retroviruses for gene therapy of brain tumors [7]\u2013[10]. however, clinical trials using retroviral vector supernatants or retroviral packaging cells have failed [11]\u2013[13]. VSV-G and LCMV-GP pseudotyped lentiviruses efficiently transduced human glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. lentiviruses also transduced host brain cells in invasive areas. lentiviral vectors targeted CD133-positive as well as CD133-negative cancer cells. Tissue culture Tumor fragments from glioblastoma multiforme patients were obtained during surgery. samples were taken from viable tumor areas that corresponded to regions with contrast enhancement on preoperative MRI-scans. the same method was applied for tumor material passaged in nude rats. doublets were discriminated using a forward light scatter (FSC) versus pulse width. FSC and side light scatter (SSC) signals were detected and shown in linear mode. cells were defined on SSC versus FL1 (in logarithmic mode) dot plot. immunofluorescence staining of spheroids/adherent cells Spheroids/adherent cells were stained with human-specific mouse-anti-nestin antibodies (Millipore, Billerica, MA), goat-anti-SOX2 antibodies (R&D), mouse-anti-tubulinIII (Millipore) antibodies. primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. 293T cells were transfected with 7.5 g of pMP71-eGFP-pre, 12.5 g of pSV-Mo-MLVgagpol and 2 g of the envelope expression plasmid pHCMV-LCMV-GP or pCMV-G [23] for the production of retroviral vectors. the animals were anesthetized and prepared for vector injection. rat gliomas Rats bearing glioblastoma xenografts were treated by daily i.p. injections of 50 mg/kg ganciclovir (GCV, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) brains were removed, suspended in 30% sucrose for three days, and then snap frozen in isopentane chilled with dry ice. the transduction volume was calculated using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) with an automated stage using 10magnification. the transduction volume was calculated using the Nikon Lucia imaging software. log-rank test based on the Kaplan-Meier test using SPSS software. differences between pairs of groups were determined by the Student's t-test. ethics statement The collection of human biopsy tissue was approved. Flow cytometric analysis and cell sorting Cells were analyzed and sorted on a moFlo cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, USA; former Cytomation, USA), equipped with a coherent Enterprise 621 argon-ion laser tuned to 488 nm (used at 180 mW) two g/ml propidium iodide \u2013 PI (Molecular Probes) were added to the samples before flow sorting. sorted cells were cultured in neurobasal medium (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with B27 supplement (20 l/ml; Invitrogen), Glutamax (10 l/ml; Invitrogen), fibroblast growth factor 2 (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), epidermal growth factor 2 (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) Immunofluorescence staining of spheroids/ the lentiviral vector plasmid pRRL.sinCMVeGFPpre has been described previously. the retroviral vector pRRL.sinCMVeGFP-pre has been described previously. the skin was withdrawn to reveal the location of the craniotomy. 2 times 10 L of vector stocks were delivered into the centre of the tumors. the injection coordinates were estimated after analyzing MRI images for each individual lesion. primary antibodies (dilution 1200) were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. biotinylated goat-anti-mouse and goat\u2013anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories) were used as secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. sections were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) axial T2-weighted RARE sequences were acquired. animals were kept under anesthesia with 1.5% isofluorane (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) mixed with 50% air and 50% O2. retroviral vectors transduced only a few single cells in high generation spheroids. in contrast, retroviral vectors failed to transduce patient spheroids in vitro. both vectors are much more efficient in transducing human glioblastoma spheroids in vitro than retroviral vectors. the injection coordinates were estimated after analyzing MRI images for each individual lesion. the injection volume applied was 210 l and the vector titre 1107/ml for all vectors. higher magnification of the patient (C) and xenograft tumor (D) demonstrate similar tumor cell morphology with polymorphic nuclei in the vicinity of a tumor necrosis. single tumor cell infiltration into the white matter is observed in the xenograft tumor (F). LCMV transduced tumors (n = 3) showed a higher transduction volume than VSV transduced tumors (n = 3), however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.269). LCMV-GP pseudotyped lentiviral vectors exclusively transduced tumor cells in all invasive areas. cells in some invasive areas (D-F), but also transduction of single normal brain cells in others (G,H; arrows). transduced normal brain cells were mostly detected by morphologic criteria (more processes), as the staining (GFAP or NeuN) not always matched with the transduced cells. LCMV-GP (B) and VSV-G (E) transduced cells form spheroids upon culture in serum-free neural basal medium supplemented with EGF and bFGF. transduced spheroids express the stem cell markers nestin (C,F) and SOX2 (D,G) the cells continued to show significant expression of the stem cell markers nestin and SOX2 but also of the differentiation markers GFAP and -tubulinIII. lentiviral pseudotyoped vectors expressing the suicide gene HSV-1-tk fused to eGFP mediate an efficient therapeutic effect in vivo. intracranial gliomas were injected with LCMV-GP or VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors expressing HSV-1-tk fused to eGFP 3 weeks after tumor implantation. survival benefit for both treatment groups compared to control groups was statistically significant. the recurrent tumor is growing from the contralateral hemisphere over the corpus callosum to the ipsilateral hemisphere (arrows) the recurrent tumor is growing from the contralateral hemisphere over the corpus callosum to the ipsilateral hemisphere. the surviving cells were found in invasive areas (Figure 7F,G), the corpus callosum region (Figure 7H) and in some regions of distant recurrences. in the LCMV group, most GFP-positive cells were found in the ipsilateral hemisphere, in solid and invasive tumor areas (Figure 7J,K,L) both lentiviral vectors transduced patient spheroids and high generation spheroids very efficiently. in contrast, retroviral vectors transduced only a few single cells in high generation spheroids. both lentiviral vectors are much more efficient in transducing human glioblastoma spheroids in vitro than retroviral vectors. the vectors were injected into the center of growing lesions using stereotactic infusion. the injection volume applied was 210 l and the vector titre 1107/ml for all vectors. transduction efficiency was evaluated 7 days after vector injection. both lentiviral pseudotyped vectors showed very efficient transduction of the tumors. patient tumor (A) and xenograft tumor (B) show angiogenic features of human glioblastoma with palisading necrosis (arrow) and vascular proliferates (arrowheads) higher magnification of the patient (C) and xenograft tumor (D) demonstrate similar tumor cell morphology with polymorphic nuclei in the vicinity of a tumor necrosis. single tumor cell infiltration into the white matter is observed LCMV transduced tumors (n = 3) showed a higher transduction volume than VSV transduced tumors (n = 3), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.269). lentiviral vectors exclusively transduced tumor cells in all invasive areas. LCMV-G pseudotyped vectors specifically transduced invasive glioma cells (A-C) transduced normal brain cells were mostly detected by morphologic criteria. transduced tumors were enzymatically dissociated and CD133 expression was measured by flow cytometry. the fraction of transduced (GFP-positive) cells is slightly higher in CD133 positive cells compared to CD133 negative cells (middle column). LCMV-GP (B) and VSV-G (E) transduced cells form spheroids upon culture in serum-free neural basal medium supplemented with EGF and bFGF. d tumor cells from both vectors were able to form spheroids. lentiviral pseudotyped vectors expressing the suicide gene HSV-1-tk fused to eGFP mediate an efficient therapeutic effect in vivo. lentiviral LCMV-GP vectors without ganciclovir treatment. lentiviral LCMV-GP vectors without ganciclovir treatment. sections of recurrent tumors were stained with antibodies against human-specific nestin. images show overlay of nestin (red) and eGFP transgene (green) recurrent tumors of animals treated with VSV-G pseudotyped vectors. LCMV-pseudotyped vector-treated animals had more contralateral recurrences, whereas VSV-G pseudotyped vector-treated animals had more local recurrences. the surviving cells were found in invasive areas (Figure 7F,G), the corpus callosum region (Figure 7H) and also in some regions of distant recurrences. lentiviral vectors transduced spheroids derived from low and high generation tumors very efficiently. retroviral vectors transduced only high generation spheroids. this difference can only be attributed to the vector backbone, as the glycoprotein responsible for virus entry into the cell was the same for retroviral and one of the lentivral vectors applied. in vivo experiments, we selected a high generation xenograft that showed both angiogenic and invasive features and recapitulated the histology of the patient lesion. this xenograft showed a high level of nestin expression similar to the patient material. in translational research it is crucial to ensure that the experimental tumors truly reflect the corresponding patient's tumor properties to avoid using non-relevant animal models. pseudotyped vectors transduced normal brain cells at a much higher frequency than in this study. this can be explained by the mode of vector delivery because it results in a high distribution volume of drug and vector. the tumor model we apply here is highly invasive and lacks a sharply demarcated brain tumor/normal brain interface. sorted cells from tumors transduced either by lentiviral LCMV-GP or VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors had the ability to form spheroids upon culturing in neural basal medium supplemented with EGF and bFGF. these properties have been described for neural progenitor cells [40] as well as for cancer stem-like cells in human glioblastoma [26]. experimental human glioblastoma was detected after one cycle (30 days) of ganciclovir administration in treated animals. this showed that vector-transduced tumor cells retain the ability to invade brain tissue."}
