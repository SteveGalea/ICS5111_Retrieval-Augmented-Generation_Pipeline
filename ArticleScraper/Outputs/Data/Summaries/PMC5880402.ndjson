{"summary": "xenosurveillance is a technique that makes use of blood collected by hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. xenosurveillance is a technique that makes use of blood collected by hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. despite this, the burden of infectious disease in SSA is likely underestimated due to misdiagnoses stemming from inadequate healthcare infrastructure with limited availability of diagnostic tests, procedures, and surveillance. this is highlighted by the recent outbreak of Ebola virus in west africa [8, 9], and demonstrates the need for an improved diagnostic and surveillance framework in SSA. xenosurveillance is a surveillance technique that makes use of the hematophagous behavior of some arthropods to survey vertebrates for the presence of pathogens. pathogens were detected by NGS in pooled xenosurveillance samples and then confirmed with qPCR and qRT-PCR to make prevalence estimates in the two sample types. xenosurveillance and finger-stick methods detect pathogens from a field setting in rural west africa. a local public health worker explained the details of the study and acquired signatures or thumb prints from individuals providing consent. the IRB protocol allowed for thumb prints to be used as informed consent for illiterate individuals. bloodspots (H-DBS) was pipetted onto CloneSaver FTA cards. soaked in 25L of RNAlater to facilitate diffusion of blood into the card. body temperature was collected upon enrollment, however enrollment was not contingent upon presenting as febrile. RNA NGS was performed on H/M-DBS samples from a single household in village A. RNA NGS samples were separated into two pools by location and sample type. 2nd strand cDNA synthesis was conducted immediately following 1st strand synthesis using a Klenow Fragment (3\u201d-5\u201dexo-) for DNA NGS, 10L of total DNA for H and M-DBS were pooled by sample type. cDNA created from RNA NGS pools was not quantifiable using a Quibit due to low concentration. high level taxonomic assessment of individual reads was initially performed using BLASTn- megablast tool against the nt database with evalue = 1e-8 [36] to determine the composition of sequencing pools. an in-house script was used to count the number of reads aligning to eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses. reference FASTA files were indexed using the\u2013build option in Bowtie2. paired (DNA Seq) or single (RNA Seq) end reads were aligned to indexed reference files using\u2013x and\u2013very-sensitive options in Bowtie2. chroomatogram files were then aligned to the reference genome in Geneious 10.2.2. the presence of HBV was determined from individual DBS using the iTaq Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (Bio-Rad, USA) positive samples were sequenced and confirmation analysis was performed as stated above. parents and guardians provided consent on behalf of children within the household. all febrile patients were offered a SD bioline malaria antigen rapid diagnostic test. patients with a positive test were offered treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy by a nurse and public health worker. a total of 23 households from Village A and 20 households from Village B were enrolled in the study. villages were visited every other day for up to two weeks to collect engorged female mosquitoes. aspiration collections were sorted by date and location. total nucleic acid extraction on H/M-DBS was performed using the Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA kit (Omega Bio-tek, USA) the pool was composed of 25L of total RNA from each H-DBS. the M-DBS pool was composed of 10L of total RNA from each M-DBS. RNA NGS samples were sequenced using a 600 cycle (2x300 reads) miSeq reagent kit at the CSU NGS facility. the sequencing analysis was to search for reads and contigs aligning to human derived pathogens. contiguous sequences (contigs) that produced quality alignments of interest were viewed in Geneious 10.2.2 [37] following the taxonomic assessment pipeline, multiple contigs aligning to pathogens were discovered. q) end reads were aligned to indexed reference files using\u2013x and\u2013very-sensitive options in Bowtie2. individual reads that aligned were then assessed visually and with the BLASTn -megablast tool under previously listed parameters. all sequencing samples have been de-identified. NGS reads aligning to GBV-C and HBV were mapped to their appropriate alignment. the longest contig from each data set, a 491 nt segment aligning to the NS5B region of GBV-C and a 542 nt segment spanning the C and P gene of HBV, were used for the analysis. mosquitoes were collected from households in Village A (Table 1). 98 H-DBS were pooled separately from the remaining 127 M-DBS. previous experience aspirating mosquitoes from inside houses implied this was an unexpectedly low number. the most common reads from H-DBS were human derived, while the most common reads from M-DBS were derived from human and An. gambiae. reads of bacterial, viral, and parasitic origins were identified. RNA sequencing revealed multiple reads from pools of both H and M-DBS spanning the GB virus C genome. RNA sequencing revealed multiple reads from pools of both H and M-DBS spanning the GB virus C genome. a single contig from our H-DBS DNA sequencing dataset produced an alignment to an African strain of HBV. reads from both datasets aligned with up to 99% percent pairwise nucleotide identify and combined to cover 25% of the genome. reads from both datasets aligned with up to 99% percent pairwise nucleotide identify and combined to cover 25% of the genome. phylogenetic analysis using the 542 n.t. sequence correctly placed each virus in their appropriate phenotypic group. the longest contig assembled to HBV was a 542 n.t. segment. this was used as input to create a phylogenetic tree using a neighbor-joining method. prevalence Virus-specific RT-PCR and qPCR was employed to determine the prevalence of GBV-C and HBV from individual H-DBS and M-DBS that made up the NGS pools. a total of 34 M-DBS, three were deemed positive, resulting in a prevalence of 8.8% in M-DBS collected from the same household. e sensu lato was the most commonly collected species of mosquito from within households in both villages. the vast majority of an. gambiae mosquitoes collected contained a full blood meal, indicating they fed the previous night. a greater number of blood fed An. gambiae mosquitoes were collected from households in Village A. an average of 50,000 reads remained per H-DBS and 11,000 per M-DBS. 98 H-DBS were pooled separately from the remaining 127 M-DBS. the most common reads from H-DBS were human derived. the most reads in H-DBS aligned to human nucleic acid. reads from M-DBS aligned to both human and mosquito nucleic acid. individual reads from both H-DBS and M-DBS sequencing datasets were aligned. reads from both H and M-DBS were comparable in quantity and quality to reads from H-DBS. reads from M-DBS were comparable in quantity and quality to reads from H-DBS. reads from both datasets aligned with up to 99% percent pairwise nucleotide identify and combined to cover 25% of the genome. overlapping reads/contigs from M-DBS and H-DBS shared 100% pairwise nt identity. 426 reads produced a quality alignment to multiple genes across all chromosomes of the P. falciparum genome (S2 File), and no nematode parasite reads/contigs were deemed legitimate. the vast majority of reads/contigs that were aligned to the worm index file were removed following a Blastn search. hematophagous arthropods have been used to survey wildlife populations for pathogen circulation. human pathogens have been detected in blood meals of these arthropods. a comparison between the two has never been made. non-invasive technique facilitates more frequent sampling, resulting in more blood samples collected. storing blood spots on FTA cards with RNA Later allows for bypassing cold chain, ensures deactivation of potential pathogens in samples [50]. more unique reads were produced from DNA sequencing libraries. reads aligned to P. falciparum were identified in all sequencing pools. xenosurveillance is intended to identify human pathogens present in peripheral blood. xenosurveillance can be conducted using other hematophagous arthropods. reads from two viruses, GBV-C and HBV, were identified using bioinformatics and molecular methods. infection with this virus is associated with an increased rate of survival in patients co-infected with either HIV or Ebola virus. xenosurveillance is a viable alternative for collecting human blood samples. xenosurveillance is less invasive and logistically challenging compared to traditional sampling methods. zoonotic, viral pathogens are disproportionately disproportionate. routine xenosurveillance could provide early warnings by detecting emerging pathogens circulating at low levels in vulnerable populations. xenosurveillance can be targeted to support epidemiological services by collecting engorged mosquitoes in areas where suspected pathogen transmission is occurring. large scale sequencing projects are becoming more universal as cost of high throughput NGS continues to decrease.
