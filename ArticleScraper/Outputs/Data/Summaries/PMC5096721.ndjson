{"summary": "Rhizoctonia solani K\u00fchn represents an important species complex of known plant pathogens. the pathogen is difficult to control by conventional agronomic measures like fungicides, crop rotation or plant resistance. the interaction of the fungus with its environment and, in particular, the microflora has been studied by many researchers. mycoviral infections are cryptic [10, 11] and only little is known about the interaction of these pathogens with their hosts [12]. successful examples, like the biocontrol of chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) caused by hypoviruses, raises hope to exploit other mycoviruses. the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene is the only gene that is universally conserved among RNA viruses and represents the key for the identification of evolutionary relationships between the respective viruses. phylogenetic analysis of the conserved RdRp domain within these superfamilies enables a classification of RNA viruses on family level. the fungal strain DC17, originally isolated from sugar beet, was derived from the IRS (Institute of Sugar Beet Research, Netherlands) the strain showed unusual light pigmentation, slow growth on PDA and hypovirulence in a damping-off assay with sugar beet. the isolate showed unusual light pigmentation, slow growth on PDA and hypovirulence in a damping-off assay with sugar beet. cellulose was resuspended in 20 mL STE16 and transferred to Econo-Columns. dsRNA was eluted by the addition of 10 mL 2xSTE. extract was supplemented with EtOH to a final concentration of 16% and 0.5 M EDTA. the cDNA was purified using the NucleoSpin, PCR clean-up, gel extraction kit. it was mixed with 100 pmol of Primer-dN6, incubated for 2 min at 99\u00b0C. the generated dscDNA was again purified and 5 L were used for amplification. on the Illumina MiSeq system and sequence analysis DNA quality was assessed by gel-electrophoresis. the quantity was estimated by a fluorescence-based method using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA kit (Invitrogen) and the Tecan Infinite 200 Microplate Reader (Tecan Deutschland GmbH) cloned using the pJet1.2 cloning Kit (Fermentas) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. resulting clones were sequenced with specific primers by standard Sanger-sequencing (Seqlab) Specific primers were designed according to the results of the Illumina sequencing. the isolate showed unusual light pigmentation, slow growth on PDA and hypovirulence in a damping-off assay with sugar beet. the strain was stored at -80\u00b0C on PDA. for extraction of DNA, RNA and dsRNA, mycelium was grown in PDB at 24\u00b0C. dsRNA was eluted by the addition of 10 mL 2xSTE. to remove contaminating genomic DNA and RNA, the eluate was treated with T1-RNase (Roche) (30 min, 37\u00b0C) followed by the addition of 3.3% 1 M MgCl2 and a treatment with DNase I (Roche) (2 U/mL) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C each. the extract was supplemented with EtOH to a final concentration of the purified cDNA (25 L) was mixed with 100 pmol of Primer-dN6. the mixture contained 3.125 mM dNTPs, 5 U Klenow-fragment and 5 L of 10x Klenow-buffer in a total volume of 24 L. the generated dscDNA was again purified and 5 L were used for amplification. cDNA was synthesized using a sequence specific primer based on known sequence information targeting the whole RdRp domain (S1 Table) the fragments were cloned using the pJet1.2 cloning Kit (Fermentas) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. sequence assembly results Specific primers were designed according to the results of the Illumina sequencing. cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were done using 2 L cDNA. PCR products were gel purified and sequenced. dsRNA extracted from a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide showed several dsRNA fragments ranging from approx. 0.85 to 12 kb in size compared to a size marker of a PstI digested lambda DNA (M). a total of 930,558 paired-end reads yielded 279 Mb sequence information. the family is divided into the two genera Narnavirus and Mitovirus. the members of the Narnaviridae are only distantly related to other RNA viruses infecting eukaryotes and share higher sequence similarity to bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae. conserved motifs A-F in the RdRp domain of the genus Mitovirus were aligned using MEGA 6.06 and the sequence alignment algorithm MUSCLE [47] the conserved motifs A-F were marked according to Bruenn 2003. an unrooted phylogenetic tree of the Narnaviridae was calculated based on the alignment of the RdRp domain spanning the conserved motifs A to F. the scale represents a genetic distance of 0.1 amino acid substitutions per site. onia solani mitovirus 4 (ALD89123.1); RsMV-5, Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 5 (ALD89124.1); RsMV-6, Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 6 (ALD89125.1); RsMV-7, Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 7 (ALD89126.1); RsMV-8, Rhizoctonia solani mitovirus 8 (ALD89127.1); RsMV-10, Rhizoctonia sol e identified in the family Endornaviridae are found in algae, plants and fungi. they have a non-segmented genome of 14 to 17 kb which codes for a single large polyprotein. the polyprotein always carries a conserved RdRp domain (pfam00978), specifying its affiliation to the alphavirus-like superfamily. three mycoviruses belonging to the family of the Endornaviridae were described to infect the genus Rhizoctonia. a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved RdRp domain showed that RsEV-3 and RsEV-1 possess 44.2% amino acid homology across the conserved RdRp domain. both viruses share 63.2% sequence identity within the RDRP domain. similarities between different members of the Endornaviridae can also be high. the order Tymovirales comprises four viral families. the novel viruses were named Rhizoctonia solani flexivirus 1 (RsFV-1) and Rhizoctonia solani flexivirus 2 (RSFV-2). the type species of all genera within the order Tymovirales were aligned using the sequence alignment algorithm. an unrooted phylogenetic tree of the alphavirus-like superfamily was calculated based on the alignment of the RdRp domain with 1000 bootstrap replicates. the scale represents a genetic distance of 0.1 amino acid substitutions per site. rotinia sclerotiorum RNA virus L (ACE88957.1); aCLSV, apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ABY71563.1); AcLV, Aconitum latent virus (NP_116487.1); ASGV, apple stem grooving virus (BAA98054.1); botV-F, Botrytis virus F (NP_068549.1); BotV-X, Botrytis virus X (NP_932306.1); the search for conserved RdRp domains in the R. solani DC17 virome also revealed the presence of three domains representing the pfam00978 group that were closely rated to each other. a phylogenetic analysis of this region showed that the three viruses found in R. solani DC17 form a separate clade together with SsRV-L. two of the three RdRp domains within this group share a very high sequence similarity of 93%.
