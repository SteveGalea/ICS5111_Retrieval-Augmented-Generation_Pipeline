{"summary": "in 2004, another alphacoronavirus, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a seven-month-old child in the Netherlands suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. in 2005, Woo and coworkers discovered the novel betacoronavirus Human coronavirus HKU1 in patients with severe acute respiratory-tract infections in the Middle East. the N protein of MERS-CoV, with a molecular weight of 45.6 kDa and a pI of 10.05, is highly basic and hydrophilic. previous studies revealed that the N-terminal domain of CoV (NP-NTD) contains mostly positively charged residues. the C-terminal domain (NP-CTD) acts as an oligomerization module to form a capsid. n-terminal domain of MERS-CoV spanning residues 39\u2013165 shares 58% identity to NP-NTD of SARS-CoV. results presented in this paper concern the crystallization and preliminary X-ray structural analysis of MERS-CoV NP-NTD. NP-NTD carrying an N-terminal His6 tag fused to a SSGLVPRGSHM linker sequence was purified using an Ni\u2013NTA column (Novagen) and eluted with a buffered imidazole gradient of 15\u2013250 mM. the purified NP-NTD was further concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units. expression vector pET-28a (Novagen) Expression host Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS Complete amino-acid sequence of the construct produced HHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMNTVSWYTGLTQHGKVPLTFPPGQGVPLNANSTPAQNAGYWRRQDRKINTGNGIKQLAPRWYFYTGTGPEAALPFRAVKDGIVWVHEDGATDAPSTFGTRNPN the largest crystals in the needle clusters are approximately 300 20 10 m in size. method Vapour diffusion Plate type 24-well sitting-drop plate (Hampton Research) Temperature (K) 293 Protein concentration (mgml1) 10 Buffer composition of protein solution 50mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 75mM NaCl Composition of reservoir solution 2mM NaBr, 75mM ammonium sulfate, 29% PEG 3350 Volume and ratio of drop 1:1 macromolecule production The templates for the MERS-CoV NP-NTD were purchased from AllBio Science Incorporated, Taichung, Taiwan. PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the DNA fragments were cloned into pET-28a (Novagen) using different primers. s containing pure protein were collected at 150 mM imidazole and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-buffered solution at pH 7.5. the purified NP-NTD was further concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units and centrifuged at 3500g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C several times. crystals were grown from a well solution using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method. the largest crystal in the needle clusters grew to dimensions of 300 20 10 m. crystals appeared within two weeks and the largest in the needle clusters grew to dimensions of approximately 300 20 10 m. 2l reservoir solution was mixed with 2l purified protein solution Volume of reservoir (l) 300 2.3. data collected using synchrotron radiation with a crystal-to-detector distance of 350 mm. oscillation width and exposure time for each frame were 1\u00b0 and 20 s. a homology search for the MERS-CoV NP-NTD structure was performed using the BLAST server (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) the model-selection criterion was based on the E-value and the estimated precision value. a total of 116 residues were modelled. single and unambiguous solutions for four NP-NTD molecules in one asymmetric unit were obtained in the rotation and translation functions. Structural refinement of MERS-CoV NP-NTD is currently in progress."}
