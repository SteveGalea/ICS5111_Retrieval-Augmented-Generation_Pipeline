{"summary": "the purpose of this study was to analyze descriptive epidemiological characteristics of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) cases imported to Korea. the first set comprised daily reported cases of H1N1 obtained from local cities. the second set, including 372 confirmed imported H1N1 cases, identified from 13 national quarantine stations in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from May 24 to December 31, 2009. the number of overseas travelers to Korea has increased since the overseas travel was liberalized in 1989. about 9,494,000 people traveled to foreign countries in 2009 [1]. it is worth noting that airplanes carried more than one billion travelers worldwide [2,3], who have been the main carriers of infectious diseases from foreign countries each year [4] imported H1N1 cases identified by the quarantine process of 13 National Quarantine Stations. subjects of this study were all confirmed H1N1 patients. only imported H1N1 patients (incoming travelers) confirmed. RESULTS Trends in the occurrence of total imported influenza A (H1N1) cases From the data collected by local cities from May 1 to August 19, 2009, it was estimated that the number of imported H1N1 cases was from a minimum of 1,098 to a maximum of 1,291. the total number of H1N1 cases was at least 2,409 and a maximum of 2,580. the number of male patients was 186 and that of female patients was 181 out of 367 patients, which accounts for all but 5 who omitted their sex from the health questionnaire. the main age distribution was from 20 to 29 years old (37.9%). the number of patients 60 years old and above was 3, comprising 0.8% of the total. the ratio of influenza-like-illness (ILI) in Korea had rapidly increased from the 41st week and reached its peak, 44.96 cases out of 1,000, at the 44th week. this corresponds with the H1N1 trend of quarantine numbers during the winter. the percentages of imported H1N1 cases were estimated to be 91.7% (22 cases) in May, 84.9% (180 cases) in June, 54.6% (719 cases) in July, and 36.1% (370 cases) from August 1 to 19. the number of putative community-acquired H1N1 cases had exceeded that of imported cases. the number of countries visited by the 361 H1N1 patients was 328 (89.4%) and the number of non-Koreans was 31 (8.4%). the status of countries visited The country with the highest ratio of H1N1 cases per 1,000 entrants among the countries visited was Guam, followed by Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia, and the Philippines. the number of male patients was 186 and that of female patients was 181 out of 367 patients. the main age distribution was from 20 to 29 years old (37.9%) the number of patients 60 years old and above was 3, comprising 0.8% of the total. H1N1 cases were found first in travelers from the united states and Japan in the 22nd week. the ratio of influenza-like-illness (ILI) in Korea had rapidly increased from the 41st week and reached its peak, 44.96 cases out of 1,000, at the 44th week. this corresponds with the H1N1 trend of quarantine numbers during the winter. the number of putative community-acquired H1N1 cases exceeded that of imported cases on July 28, 2009 [15], with a trend similar to that of Korea. in china, the number of putative community-acquired H1N1 cases exceeded that of imported cases on July 28, 2009. the ratio of H1N1 cases per 100,000 people in Japan was three times higher, at 0.29 patients, than the ratio in Korea, with 0.09 patients at the end of may 2009. by august 9, 2009, the ratio of H1N1 cases per 100,000 people was lower in Japan (3.89 cases) than Korea (4.02 cases) a prompt visit to the doctor's office was recommended to those with symptoms. the distribution by sex was similar, 50.7% of the cases were male and 49.3% were female. the adults aged 20 to 59 years old comprised 61.5%, and the ones 60 years old and above comprised 0.8%. among adults 18 to 64 years old, 6-9% had the cross-reaction antibody for H1N1. the number of cases from the northern Hemisphere including china and Japan was 93 out of 372, from tropical regions including Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippine, Singapore, and Vietnam was 104. by these data, the monthly data for H1N1 were similar, and the order of peaking was the Southern Hemisphere, the Tropics, and the Northern Hemisphere in the Western Pacific Region. this data suggests countries that should be priorities for strict border control measure when new pandemics occur. were confirmed by quarantine and daily report data from local cities for a certain period. were detected from 13 National Quarantine Stations by geographic and climate area."}
