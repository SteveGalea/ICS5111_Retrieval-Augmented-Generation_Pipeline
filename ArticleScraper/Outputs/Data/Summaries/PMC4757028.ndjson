{"summary": "the incubation period is the delay from infection until onset of symptoms, and varies from person to person. we analyzed data of period of exposure on 395 human cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in a Bayesian framework. fatal cases of sARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus had shorter incubation periods when compared with non-fatal cases. underlying diseases that predispose to adverse clinical outcome may also impact the incubation period and subsequent disease severity. the nhs commission determined that the collection of data from A(H7N9) cases was part of a continuing public health investigation of a notifiable infectious disease. a simple approach to estimate the incubation period distribution from interval-censored data is to impute the midpoint of the exposure interval for each patient. however, this approach is likely to overestimate incubation period distributions which tend to be right-skewed [2] logistic regression model where death was the binary response variable. predictors included age, sex, geographical location, underlying conditions and the incubation time Ti of each patient. f and F be the pdf and cdf of the incubation period. i q i d i ( 1 q i ) 1 d i (2) where di = 1 if case i died from the disease and 0 otherwise; (kfc, fc) and (knfc, nfc) are the couple of parameters of the Weibull distribution for the fatal and non-fatal cases, respectively. we drew 10,000 samples from the posterior distributions after a burn-in of 5,000 iterations. we fitted a Weibull distribution allowing for interval censoring [2], estimating the shape and scale parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo in a Bayesian framework [5] to estimate the incubation period distribution. to determine the association between the incubation period and the severity of disease, we first estimated the difference in mean incubation period between fatal and non-fatal cases. logistic regression model used incubation times resampled from 10,000 posterior samples. f and F were the pdf and cdf of the incubation period, assumed to follow a Weibull distribution with parameters k and and stratified by clinical outcome (fatal and non-fatal cases) qi = P(gi, si, xi) as defined in (1); kfc, fc and nfc are the couple of parameters of the Weibull distribution for the fatal and non-fatal cases. in this analysis and the analyses described below, we specified flat priors for each parameter. we drew 10,000 samples from the posterior distributions after a burn-in of 5,000 iterations. meanSD 63.0 15.5 54.5 16.6 58.2 16.6 0.01 Male, n (%) 124 (72%) 156 (70%) 280 (71%) 0.85 Location, n (%) 0.87 Capital cities 48 (28%) 69 (31%) 117 (30%) Non-capital cities 66 (38%) 73 (33%) 139 (35%) Rural areas 59 (34%) 80 (36%) 139 (35%) Underlying conditions1, n (%) 101 ( a longer incubation period was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of death (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 1.70 per day increase in incubation period; 95% credibility interval, CrI: 1.47\u20131.97). the parameters of the weibull distribution were estimated with the MCMC approach. the estimates are for fatal cases: k = 2.30 (95% CrI: 1.80, 2.89) and = 4.21 (95% CrI: 3.62, 4.85) and for non-fatal cases: k = 2.03 (95% CrI: 1.62, 2.52) and = 3.74 (95% CrI: 3.20, 4.36) 2 10,000 samples of the incubation periods T for each patient were drawn using MCMC 3 the tertiles were 2.5 and 4.1 days for all patients and 2.5 and 4.2 days for patients with exact exposure dates. aOR = 1.57 per day increase in incubation period; 95% CrI: 1.25\u20131.99) we categorized incubation times into tertiles and found similar results. we also found a similar association when stratifying by age group. point estimates of 1.35 and 2.13 in persons 0-59y and 60y with 95% credibility intervals. studies show that H7N9 induces a lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared with the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d induced by H5N1 virus and SARS coronavirus. mortality for H7N9 cases is correlated with a wider distribution of viral antigens in the lungs. we reported a mean length of H7N9 incubation period of 3.5 days. this is close to the mean incubation period estimated for H5N1 in other studies, with a mean length of 3.3 days. this could reflect differences regarding pathogenesis between these different virus strains. we found a significant association between a longer incubation period and a greater risk of death among human H7N9 cases."}
