{"summary": "nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from 2,230 cases of pneumonia in children 2 to 35 months old recruited in a randomized trial of zinc supplementation. the specimens were examined for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus type A (InfA) and B (InfB), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV3) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 40% of CAP cases in our study, the most commonly isolated viruses were RSV, InfA, and PIV3. the most common cause of viral LRTI is RNA viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus, and human metapneumovirus. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a novel, but widely applied method for the detection of respiratory viruses from clinical samples. PCR has significantly increased sensitivity for respiratory viral diagnosis [13,14] and has also demonstrated high specificity [15,16] no such studies have to our knowledge been conducted over several years. children aged 2 to 35 months presenting at our study clinic were screened for fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing. children with audible or auscultatory wheeze were given 2 doses of 2.5 mg nebulized salbutamol administered 15 min apart. all included children were randomized to receive either 10 to 20 mg elemental zinc dispersed in water or placebo tablets daily for 14 days. cases with very severe pneumonia/disease, that is, cough or difficult breathing with stridor when calm or any general danger signs were not included in the study. children could not participate in the study again until after 6 months due to the 6-month follow-up scheme of the clinical trial. the test had a measurement range of 8 to 160 mg/L and values outside the measurement range were indicated as 8 or >160 mg/L. sterile, disposable suction catheter was inserted through the nostril to a distance equivalent to that between the patient's earlobe and nostril. no significant differences in proportion detected between the two alternative storage temperatures for up to three months. one aliquot was immediately frozen at -70\u00b0C and transported to Norway on dry ice and stored at -70\u00b0C in case there should be a need for reanalysis. two cycles at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 45 sec. then 38 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 30 sec, followed by an additional 7 min at 72\u00b0C and immediate cooling to 4\u00b0C. 133 NPA aliquots were stored beyond 3 months at 2 to 8\u00b0C before analysis in Nepal. negative and positive processing controls were extracted from 400 l of sample, negative and positive processing controls and amplification control. an OD450 0.300 with an OD450 of the internal control >2.00 indicated a negative test. a reading from 0.300 to 0.399 was interpreted as indeterminate and the sample examined again. study participants recruited from district of Bhaktapur in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. a total of 1,913 (86.2%) of the 2,219 cases were recruited from within Bhaktapur municipality, a semi-urban agricultural based town with a population of approximately 80,000. children aged 2 to 35 months presenting at our study clinic were screened for fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing (LCI). children with audible or auscultatory wheeze were given 2 doses of 2.5 mg nebulized salbutamol administered 15 min apart. all included children were randomized to receive either 10 to 20 mg elemental zinc dispersed in water or placebo tablets daily for 14 days. cases with very severe pneumonia/disease, that is, cough or difficult breathing with stridor when calm or any general danger signs were not included in the study. children could not participate in the study again until after 6 months due to the 6-month follow-up scheme of the clinical trial. the test had a measurement range of 8 to 160 mg/L and values outside the measurement range were indicated as 8 or >160 mg/L. sterile, disposable suction catheter was inserted through the nostril to a distance equivalent to that between the patient's earlobe and nostril. one aliquot was immediately frozen at -70\u00b0C and transported to Norway on dry ice and again stored at -70\u00b0C. cDNA was produced by reverse transcription using random hexamers, murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (ABI), RNase inhibitor (ABI) and 3 l of extracted viral RNA. hemagglutinin neuraminidase gene of PIV types 1, 2 and 3. hemagglutinin neuraminidase gene of InfA, NS1 and NS2 genes of InfB, NS1 and NS2 genes of RSV and the nucleocapsid gene of hMPV. after amplification, the PCR products were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit an OD450 0.300 with an OD450 of the internal control >2.00 indicated a negative test. a reading from 0.300 to 0.399 was interpreted as indeterminate. if the same result was obtained on repeated testing, the NPA was tested again. we estimated the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient to describe the association between the monthly number of infections with each virus and meteorological factors. the study had ethical clearance from the Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Medicine at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu. 87.7) Boys (%) 2,219 1,263 (56.9) Mean birth weight in grams (SD)a 1,585 2,856 (464) Hospital delivery (%) 2,216 1,718

Agriculture 222 (10.0 the most common double infection was PIV3 in combination with hMPV, which was found in nine cases. the most common double infection was PIV3 in combination with hMPV. in each of the three years, we observed a sharp increase in the occurrence of pneumonia at the end of the monsoon season in august to September. there were also significant CAP epidemics during winter, the first year peaking in February and the second year in December. there were also smaller peaks of CAP in spring. hMPV was positively associated with temperature and rainfall, and not with relative humidity. infA did not correlate with any of these meteorological factors. we isolated at least one viral pathogen using PCR from 40% of children during the 3-year study period. the literature reveals few studies based on molecular diagnosis from similar resource-poor settings. most previous studies in developing countries have not used PCR for virus detection. hMPV was detected in 4.2% of pneumonia cases in new Delhi. it is estimated that MPV worldwide accounts for 5 to 7% of ARI in young children requiring hospitalization. in india, hMPV was detected in 3.2% of 662 children hospitalized for ARI. influenza is detectable for a greater part of the year in tropical and sub-tropical regions and the timing of outbreaks is less predictable. hMPV epidemic peaked between December 2004 and January 2005 and comprised 70% of the hMPV isolates detected during the entire 3-year study period. RSV infections peaked towards the end of the rainy season during the first and third year of our study. we explored whether there could be an association between preceding rainfall and RSV infections, and by introducing a 2-month lag after peak precipitation, such an association could indeed be identified. a strong association with relative humidity was also found for hMPV infections. we detected more than one virus in 3.3% of the virus-positive NPA specimens. this is similar to what is reported using molecular methods detecting the same viruses as in our study. the frequency of viral co-detections varies widely and depends on the number of diagnostic methods applied [59] and the number of pathogens tested for [58] despite the high sensitivity and specificity of the Hexaplex Plus assay, we may have underestimated the number of viral infections. we observed a large month-to-month variation in the proportion of CAP cases from whom we identified a respiratory RNA virus. pneumoniae has been suggested to play a role in the development of virus-associated pneumonia in children in hospital. the monthly number of cases where we did not identify any virus was particularly pronounced in the CAP epidemic. there is abundant evidence that infection with influenza viruses predisposes for pneumococcal disease. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions MM participated in the protocol design, planning, field implementation, microbiological analyses, data management and analysis. the authors of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. the authors had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report."}
