{"summary": "BAL fluid cellular analysis was evaluated in 47 adult patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL following less than 24 hours of antimicrobial agent exposure. results Bacterial pneumonia (n = 24) and viral pneumonia (n = 23) were frequently associated with neutrophilic pleocytosis in BAL fluid. bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been established as a useful technique for collecting lower respiratory tract specimens from the alveolar level. a conventional culture usually takes at least a few days, and microbiological yield is often compromised by prior empirical usage of antimicrobial agents. prospectively collected data included demographics, underlying diseases or conditions, illness severity scores, type of pneumonia, laboratory data including microbiological tests, length of ICU stay, and outcome. prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed. pneumonia was categorized as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), as defined previously [16], [17]. bronchoscopy with BAL was performed following a standardized protocol as previously described. PCR to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila were also performed. a urinary antigen test to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae and L. pneumophilia serogroup 1 species were also performed. prospectively collected data included demographics, underlying diseases or conditions, illness severity scores, type of pneumonia, laboratory data including microbiological tests, length of ICU stay, and outcome. prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed. cquired pneumonia was performed by instillation of three consecutive aliquots of sterile saline solution (20\u201330\u201330 ml) into the bronchial tree at the area that was most abnormal on the chest radiography. the right middle lobe or lingual segment was chosen in patients with bilateral diffuse infiltration. youden\u2019s Index (sensitivity + specificity-1) was used to select the optimal cutoff points of the ROC curve. sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were calculated. prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in severe pneumonia patients was assumed to be 35.9%. ten patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, 5 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and 3 patients with mycobacterial pneumonia were excluded. the characteristics of the 47 patients are shown in Table 1. 3 (12.5) 1 (4.2) 0 Destroyed lung due to tuberculosis 1 (2.1) 1 (4.2) 0 Diabetes mellitus 9 (19.0) 3 (12.5) 6 (26.1) 0.29 Hematologic malignancy 6 (12.8) 2 (8.3) 4 (17.4) 0.42 Solid cancer 6 (12.8) 5 (20.8) 1 (4.3) 0.19 Stem cell transplantation 5 (10.6) 2 (8.3) 0 0.49 Alcoholism 2 (4.3) 2 twenty-eight bacterial pathogens were identified in 24 patients. in 4 patients, two different bacteria were identified.
