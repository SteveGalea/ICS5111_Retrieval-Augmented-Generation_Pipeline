{"summary": "porcine APN (pAPN) forms crystals suitable for structure determination. pAPN is a class-II membrane protein comprised of a short intracellular tail, a transmembrane anchor, a small extracellular stalk, and a large ectodomain. the general architecture of pAPN ectodomain can be described as seahorse-shaped. the head domain (residues 632\u2013963) contains a 16 -helical superhelix. the tail domain (residues 370\u2013542) adopts a 15-stranded -barrel fold. pAPN is surrounded by its four domains and has a dimension of 50 (width), 40 (depth), 30 (height) and 20 (openings) the active sites of other metalloenzymes are all located in a small and gated compartment. two pAPN molecules from adjacent asymmetric units form a strong head-to-head dimer by burying 2,000 2 surface area. pAPN exists as a dimer in solution as revealed by dynamic light scattering analysis. pAPN is unique for M1-family metalloenzymes because all other enzymes with known structures are monomers (3\u20138) the structure of substance P shows an extended conformation similar to Ala7. the binding paths of substance P overlap, except that substance P is longer. peptide-binding channel spans 13 amino acids when peptides are in extended conformations. ligands include: alanine (Ala) bound to wild-type pAPN; poly-alanine (Ala7) bound to wild-type pAPN; (D) substance P bound to wild-type pAPN; (E) Ala7 bound to wild-type pAPN where Ala7 has been degraded in the crystal. glu384 (magenta) from wild-type pAPN was grafted here to illustrate the catalytic mechanism of APN. pAPN is in the closed and catalytically active conformation based on its active site arrangement. mutagenesis and biochemical assays were performed. the results show that APN functions best at neutral or slightly basic pH, consistent with the pH of APN-expressing tissues, such as the nervous system or the intestines. APN activity becomes very low at further increased pH, likely because of deprotonation of catalytic and substrate-binding tyrosines (e.g., Tyr472) the conformation of the peptide was catalytically inactive because the free N-terminal amine group of the peptide displaces catalytic water. understanding the catalytic mechanisms of metalloenzymes can help develop inhibitors against these physiologically and medically important enzymes. both porcine and human APNs have significantly higher affinity for TNF than for GST. the exposed N terminus of proteins can bind to APN in the same way as peptides do. the length of the exposed N terminus of proteins appears to be a limiting factor. the pAPN structure captured in this study is in a closed conformation. but can switch to an open conformation to interact with the N terminus of proteins. signal transduction has been proposed as a function of APN. the intracellular tail of APN is short and does not contain any known signaling motif. coronaviruses have evolved a mechanism to use APN as their cell entry receptor without interfering with the physiological functions of this important host enzyme. we have determined crystal structures of porcine APN and its complexes with a variety of APN-targeting ligands. many of the currently available APN-targeting inhibitors can inhibit other M1-family metalloenzymes. lack of specificity causes adverse side effects (42) the second study did not address detailed catalytic mechanism of APN. first, all of the crystallizations were done at pH 5.0, under which APN has no enzymatic activities. second, the peptide-bound APN was depleted of zinc before crystallization. complexes with APN-targeting ligands were prepared by soaking each ligand into pAPN crystals. all amino acids of the pAPN ectodomain could be modeled into electron density. glycans that are N-linked to 11 glycosylation sites on pAPN also included in the model. the tail domain (residues 62\u2013280) adopts a 15-stranded -barrel fold. pAPN matches well with other M1-family metalloenzymes. pAPN is surrounded by its four domains and has a dimension of 50 (width), 40 (depth), 30 (height) and 20 (openings) the wide openings of the active-site cavity in pAPN can allow easy access to peptides and other APN-targeting ligands. the active sites of other M1-family metalloenzymes are all located in a small and gated compartment. pAPN is a cell-surface-anchored ectoenzyme. metalloenzymes are known to take two distinct conformations, closed and open. the dimer arrangement of pAPN and the flexibility of the ectodomain/stalk junction appear to facilitate potential conformational changes of APN. met349 from pAPN forms hydrophobic interaction with C of the N-terminal amino acid of peptides. despite extensive interactions with the N-terminal residue of peptides, APN binds the rest of the peptides mainly through hydrogen bonds with peptide main-chain groups. pAPN is chelated by three residues Glu406, His383, and His387. a catalytic water is activated by zinc, is positioned by Glu350, and is ready to transfer a proton to Glu384. pAPN is in the closed and catalytically active conformation based on its active site arrangement. pAPN (in magenta), ERAP1 in an open and catalytically inactive conformation (in cyan; PDB ID code 3QNF), and ERAP1 in a closed and catalytically active conformation (in green; PDB ID code 2YD0). to support the above proposed catalytic mechanism of APN, mutagenesis and biochemical assays were performed. our study on pAPN has implications for other M1-family metalloenzymes. first, it readily explains the mechanism of inhibition of bestatin on M1-family metalloenzymes. second, it explains why peptides with a proline in the second position to the N terminus cannot be easily degraded. pAPN cannot switch to the open conformation or rearrange its catalytic residues. product alanine from the first cycle of aminopeptidase reaction is trapped in the active site by catalytic residues including Tyr472. this prevents the next cycle of aminopeptidase reaction from happening. the length of the peptide-binding channel of APN is roughly 13 residues. TNF does not fit into the pAPN structure in the closed conformation. this suggests that cell surface-anchored APN has the potential to interact with the exposed N terminus of some extracellular matrix proteins and cell-surface proteins. coronavirus-binding sites cluster into three regions. VBM1 (residues 283\u2013292) is a -strand turn in the body domain. HCoV-229E recognizes VBM1, TGEV recognizes VBM2 and CCoV recognize both VBM2 and VBM3. the active site anchors the N-terminal neutral residue of peptides. the peptide-binding channel binds the remainder of the peptides in a sequence-independent fashion. this means that APN functions ubiquitously in peptide metabolism, degrading a wide spectrum of peptides. our study provides a structural framework for development of APN-targeting inhibitors or antibodies to treat or cure APN-related diseases. one study described the structure of coronavirus-RBD\u2013bound pAPN (43) the second study did not address detailed catalytic mechanism of APN. pAPN was concentrated to 10 mg/mL in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.2 and 200 mM NaCl. crystals of pAPN were grown at 4 \u00b0C. the heavy atom (EthylHgPO4 or K2PtCl6) was first dissolved in water to make 100-mM stock solution. then diluted in the crystal freezing buffer containing 20% ethylene glycol, 25% PEG3350, 200 mM Li2SO4 and 100 mM Hepes pH 7.2. ELISA was used to characterize the binding of GST and TNF to porcine and human APNs as previously described (35). pAPN was concentrated to 10 mg/mL in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.2 and 200 mM NaCl. crystals of pAPN were soaked for 2 d in soaking buffer containing 1 mM heavy atom or 5 mM ligand, 20% (vol/vol) ethylene glycol, 25% PEG3350, 200 mM Li2SO4 and 100 mM Hepes pH 7.2. the crystals were then flash-frozen in liquid N2 and used for data collection. activity was determined at 1 nM enzyme concentration in 100 L 60 mM KH2PO4 buffer at pH 7.2. alanine-p-nitroanilide (Sigma-Aldrich) as substrate in gradient concentrations from 100 M to 10 mM."}
