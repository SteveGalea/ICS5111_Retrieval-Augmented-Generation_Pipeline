{"summary": "METHODS: Retrospective review of all patients with laboratory-confirmed NVG at the hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Ontario), from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005. the median age was two years; 42% were 1 year of age and 41% were immunocompromised. most cases were epidemiologically linked, and a significant reduction in cases occurred after the institution of enhanced infection control practices following an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. a cluster was defined as two or more cases of NVG with an epidemiological link. an outbreak was defined as three or more cases of the same etiology on a given ward within a period of one month. 142 episodes of microbiologically confirmed NVG were documented among 133 patients between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. there was no difference in the prevalence of bloody diarrhea between immunocompromised and immunocompetent children. rate of torovirus infection decreased markedly from 0.44 per 100 admissions (0.61 per 1000 patient days) through March 2005 to 0.11 per 100 admissions (0.15 per 1000 patient days) after March 2005. rate of rotavirus infection was not significantly different during the two time periods. in total, 75 (53%) of the cases were epidemiologically linked in 32 clusters. ten outbreaks (eight torovirus, two adenovirus) of NVG involving 31 patients were detected during the study period. in the 1985 study of NVG, a pathogen was identified in 95% of cases of NVG; the 1997 to 1999 and the current (2004 to 2005) studies described microbiologically confirmed cases of NVG; Reference 6; Reference 9; Clostridium difficile was detected in 10 (15%) of the 69 children tested for this pathogen DISCUSSION. more than one-half of the cases of NVG reported in the present study had a clear epidemiological link. rotavirus was the cause of nosocomial gastroenteritis in 78.5% of 163 episodes. many still consider the role of torovirus as a cause of viral gastroenteritis dubious. torovirus accounted for 54% of laboratory-confirmed NVG at HSC during 1997 to 1999, and increased to 67% during 2004 to 2005 (9). there is no firm evidence to date to suggest that torovirus plays an etiological role in necrotizing enterocolitis. the rate in the persent study was markedly lower than that documented in previous studies of NVG at HSC (Table 2). Possible reasons for the falling rate of NVG include enhanced infection control education and practice, an increase in single patient rooms to 85% of all rooms following renovations in 1992. this education resulted in an increased awareness of the need for hand hygiene, improved contact precautions through use of personal protective equipment. the present study has documented the dramatic reduction in NVG over the past 20 years at HSC. this is most likely a direct result of the evolution of infection control as a discipline in health care."}
