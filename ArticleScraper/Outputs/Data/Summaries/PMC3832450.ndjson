{"summary": "emergence of new infectious diseases is a major threat to human, animal and plant health and agriculture. RNA viruses demonstrate remarkable capacity to evolve due to large population size, short generation times and high mutation and recombination rates. many are also vector-borne, potentially increasing prevalence and range of a given virus in natural ecosystems. studies in RNAi-deficient Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes showed increased viral dissemination rates and titres of inoculated O\u2019nyong-nyong virus [14]. the vast majority of flaviviruses discovered to date have been isolated from culicine mosquito species (subfamily Culicinae, for example An. gambiae, a major vector for malarial parasites) CDC fan-augmented light traps were supplemented with dry ice for 8-hour trapping periods between dusk and dawn. modified backpack aspirators and hand-held aspirators were used to sample resting specimens throughout the day. collection of immature stages were made from standing water in the three ecological communities. twelve tagged small-enriched RNA libraries were prepared for single read sequencing using the HiSeq 2000 platform. acrylamide gel purification of RNA bands corresponding to size range 20\u201330 nt was conducted. adapted sequences were added so that the libraries could be multiplexed. reads were compared to a database comprising all NCBI RNA virus RefSeq proteins. long contigs (> 600 nt) with blastx e-values 0.01 were extracted. the remaining contigs were inspected manually and selected contigs. contig length (nt) cova CDS(s) SNPsb syn/non closest acc# in NCBI e-value query % coverage max % identity taxonomic identification of closest acc# in NCBI host / source of closest acc# in NCBI.

Multiple sequence alignment was performed via MUSCLE [21]. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were estimated via the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in MrBayes. pVP2-VP4-VP3-frame alignment codon column shuffling was assessed via pVP2-VP4-VP3-frame alignment codon column shuffling. collections were made within and around an ornithological park, a rice farm and a rural farmhouse and stables. modified backpack aspirators and hand-held aspirators were used to sample resting specimens throughout the day. 0.5 g of flies using the Ambion mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit. all RNA extractions were stored at -80\u00b0C and evaluated on a Bioanalyzer. twelve tagged small-enriched RNA libraries were prepared for single read sequencing. reads were trimmed using the FASTX-Toolkit. first using fastq_quality_trimmer to trim sequences back to the first position with a quality score greater than or equal to 28. then using fastq_quality_filter to remove any reads with greater than 10% of positions having a quality score 20. reads were then assembled using Velvet [16] with k-mer values ranging from 19 to 29. novel virus-related computationally assembled sequences have been deposited in Genbank. the raw Illumina reads have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. 0/1 GU979419 1 x 10-10 29% 23% Spissistilus festinus virus 1 Spissistilus festinus (Insecta) KF298269l 1503 98.0 34..1452 0/0 D55668 3 x 10-41 77% 30% Mycovirus FusoV (Partitiviridae) Fusarium solani (Fungi) KF298270l 2550 21.9 386. e Hit to AB018086 (Chuzan orbivirus segment 1) has a slightly lower e-value (6 x 10-47) but greater coverage (83% coverage; 24% identity) i Hit to D10759 (Uukuniemi phlebovirus L segment; Bunyaviridae) has a slightly lower e-value (4 x 10-122) but greater coverage (77% coverage; 24% identity). j Predicted to be expressed as a fusion with the ORF 742.3378 via 1 ribosomal frameshifting on G_GAA_AAC. all 14 contigs were supported by between 19 (KF298270) and 140,000 (KF298271) reads. individual reads were mapped back onto assemblies using un-gapped blastn. reads with full-length matches (or at most 3 nt of terminal mismatch) to virus assemblies. PCR products were cloned into the TA vector \u2013 pGemT-easy (Promega, Madison U.S.A.), followed by transformation into DH5 cells. Plasmid DNA were extracted by Plasmid DNA miniprep kit (NBS Biologicals Ltd. Cambridge U.K.) and sequenced with both M13F and M13R primers as well as internal primers when necessary. conservation at synonymous sites was analysed as described previously. the probability of the conserved absence of stop codons in the entomobirnavirus X ORF occurring by chance was assessed via pVP2-VP4-VP3-frame alignment codon shuffling. RNA2 lacks a homolog of the CBPV ORF1 and has a shorter 3' UTR than CBPV. the new sequences have a CBPV-like rather than LSV-like genome organization. good coverage was obtained for both RNA1 and RNA2. the presence of common 5' motifs suggests that the AACV assemblies are nearly complete at their 3' ends. however, alignment of AACV RNA1 with CBPV RNA1 suggests that only of order 10 codons are missing from the 5' end of ORF1. the addition of these new sequences facilitates comparative genomic analysis of CBPV. it is supported by the conserved absence of stop codons between CBPV and AACV. however, it is unlikely that a potential ORF4 previously identified in CBPV RNA2 [28] is utilised since it is not conserved in AACV and, furthermore, is not easily accessible via leaky scanning. phylogenetic trees constructed using alignments from either MUSCLE or COBALT were similar. +1 frameshifting for RdRp expression is predicted to occur on a conserved U_UUU_CGU motif. this may be further supplemented by some level of tandem P- and A-site -1 slippage on U_CCU_UU (ESV, CYV, MXV, CAZV) or A_AAU_UU (DXV) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by mapping raw trimmed reads onto assembled contigs. nucleotide variations with a frequency in the mapped reads of at least 20% of the most common nucleotide present at that position are reported in Figure 1. preference for synonymous substitutions over non-synonymous substitutions occurred in the region where ORF3 and ORF2 overlap. the genus Entomobirnavirus is a member of the family Birnaviridae. members of the family have double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes with two segments. one encodes the RdRp (Viral Protein 1, VP1) that is packaged with the viral genomic RNA. the other segment encodes structural proteins pVP2, VP4 and VP3. mosquito X virus (MXV) from anopheles sinensis mosquitoes from china. the new virus, CAZV, is more divergent (90% amino acid identity to MXV) but DXV is even more divergent (67% amino acid identity to MXV) entomobirnavirus 5' and 3' UTR sequences are nearly complete. initiation and termination codons are highlighted in green and red respectively. a 245- to 268-codon X ORF is conserved in all known sequences. the X ORF may be translated via ribosomal -1 frameshifting. evidence for a frameshift expression mechanism includes the presence of a conserved U_UUU_UUA shift site at the 5' end of the X ORF. entomobirnavirus sequences actually have tandem shift-prone heptanucleotides. many flaviviruses infect vertebrates and are transmitted by and replicate within haematophagous arthropods such as mosquitoes and ticks. other flaviviruses \u2013 the insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) \u2013 appear to infect only insects. V and cell-fusing agent virus, have an overlapping ORF (fifo) in the NS2A/2B-encoding region that is translated via ribosomal frameshifting. this ORF (2...355) is in the -1 frame relative to the polyprotein ORF. this ORF (2...355) is in the -1 frame relative to the polyprotein ORF. a bunyavirus-like sequence was assembled from sample 9 (adult female Ochlerotatus caspius and Oc. detritus mosquitoes from a rice field) the family includes the genera Hantavirus, Nairovirus, Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus and Tospovirus. the 5' and 3' termini of KF298274 were complementary (5'-GCAAAACA... UGUUUUGC-3') but different from the 5' and 3' termini of phleboviruses and GOUV. the 5'-3' complementarity suggests that our assembly represents a genome segment. the tree is midpoint-rooted and, for clarity, only posterior probability values >80% are shown. orbivirus-like sequences form a genus in the family Reoviridae. members of the family have a segmented dsRNA genome. nt contained an internal stop codon within the VP1 ORF, and just one (nonsynonymous) SNP, consistent with a transcribed genome-integrated sequence. 23 synonymous and just 3 nonsynonymous SNPs were detected within the VP1 ORF of the orbivirus-like sequence detected. SpFV1 and CiTV1 are dsRNA viruses with monopartite genomes of around 8 kb. their genomes contain two long terminally overlapping ORFs. the 3' ORF encodes the RdRp and is believed to be translated as a fusion with the 5' ORF. a large number of SNPs were identified in both ORFs. 184 synonymous, 32 nonsynonymous in ORF1; 172 synonymous, 40 nonsynonymous in ORF2. genome integration of related viruses appears to occur. a number of related viral sequences were also identified. phylogenetic trees were not estimated for the sequences related to narnavirus. ourmiaviruses are not grouped with the Narnaviridae because they have tripartite genomes. the other two genome segments are believed to have a separate origin via inter-genus/family reassortment. the sequences are highly divergent from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 20S and 23S RNA narnaviruses. KF298275 had a mean coverage of 17.8-fold and only one SNP was identified. 147 SNPs were predominantly synonymous with respect to the RdRp amino acid sequence. the large number of SNPs suggest that KF298276 derives from a bona fide virus rather than a genome-integrated sequence. the reverse direction ORF is in-frame with the forward direction RdRp ORF. selection in the RdRp ORF acts strongly against usage of the codons UUA, UCA and UAG. this might occur if the virus infects an organism in which these codons are rarely or never used. these four sequences form a phylogenetic clade distinct from the sequences without the reverse-direction ORF. this suggests that the long reverse-frame ORF is not an artefact of codon usage in the RdRp ORF. the extreme divergence between these sequences suggests that the reverse-frame ORF may represent a bona fide protein-coding sequence. partitiviruses (family Partitiviridae) infect fungi and plants. they have bipartite dsRNA genomes with one segment encoding the RdRp and the other segment encoding a capsid protein. despite relatively high coverage, no SNPs were detected for this contig. phylogenetic trees were not estimated for the mitovirus-like or partitivirus-like sequences. sequences related to RNA1 and RNA2 of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) were assembled from sample 1. AACV RNA2 lacks a homolog of the CBPV ORF1 and has a shorter 3' UTR than CBPV. the new sequences have a CBPV-like rather than LSV-like genome organization. the presence of common 5' motifs in the 3' UTRs suggests that the AACV assemblies are nearly complete at their 3' ends. alignment of AACV RNA1 with CBPV RNA1 suggests that only of order 10 codons are missing from the 5' end of ORF1. overlapping RNA1 ORF2 and RNA2 ORF3 supported by conserved absence of stop codons between CBPV and AACV. a potential ORF4 previously identified in CBPV RNA2 [28] is not utilised. this is in contrast to CBPV RNA2 ORFs 1, 2 and 3, which begin, respectively, at the first, second and third AUGs on the message. in entomobirnaviruses, +1 frameshifting for VP4N-X expression is predicted to occur on a conserved U_UUU_UUA motif. this may be further supplemented by some level of tandem P- and A-site -1 slippage on U_CCU_UU (ESV, CYV, MXV, CAZV) or A_AAU_UU (DXV) (grey and orange highlighting) the three SNPs detected in RNA1 ORF3 are synonymous with respect to the encoded amino acid. preference for synonymous substitutions over non-synonymous substitutions occurred in the region where ORF3 and ORF2 overlap. the presence of both virus segments, the high coverage, the presence of common 5' and 3' terminal motifs and the presence of multiple well-supported SNPs that are generally synonymous. the genus Entomobirnavirus is a member of the family Birnaviridae. the genus contains two segments, one encodes the viral genomic RNA. the other encodes structural proteins pVP2, VP4 and VP3. CYV and MXV viruses are closely related (>97% amino acid identity) whereas the new virus, CAZV, is more divergent (97% amino acid identity to MXV) however, DXV is even more divergent (67% amino acid identity to MXV). initiation and termination codons are highlighted in green and red respectively. both entomobirnavirus segments have upstream AUG codons. it is not known whether these are utilised. entomobirnavirus sequences have tandem shift-prone heptanucleotides. flaviviruses have non-segmented single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes of around 11 kb. flavivirus genome contains a long ORF that is translated as a polyprotein. flavivirus-related fragment, KF298267, contains a single long ORF (3...>6566) translation of which showed greatest similarity to Culex flavivirus (CxFV; 35% amino acid identity; 86% coverage) 67 does not extend to the 5' end of the NS2A-encoding region. however, the 5' end of KF298267 does contain a long overlapping ORF. this ORF (2...355) is in the -1 frame relative to the polyprotein ORF. bunyaviruses have negative-sense RNA genomes with three segments L (large), M (medium) and S (small) the family includes the genera Hantavirus, Nairovirus, Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus and Tospovirus. bunyavirus mRNAs typically contain 10-18 non-templated nucleotides at the 5' end. chimeric reads were not observed for viruses with capped mRNAs. coverage of the 5' end is likely to come largely from the negative strand (or uncapped forms of the positive strand) orbivirus-like sequences form a genus in the family Reoviridae. members of the family have a segmented dsRNA genome, with typically 9-12 segments (10 in the case of orbiviruses; [48,49]) orbiviruses infect vertebrates and are transmitted by, and replicate in, arthropods such as gnats, mosquitoes and phlebotomine flies. 23 synonymous and just 3 nonsynonymous SNPs were detected within the VP1 ORF of the orbivirus-like sequence detected in sample 1. it is not clear whether such sequences derive from cellular transcripts or from infecting viruses. isilus festinus virus 1 (SpFV1) and Circulifer tenellus virus 1 (CiTV1) are dsRNA viruses with monopartite genomes of around 8 kb. their genomes contain two long terminally overlapping ORFs. the 3' ORF encodes the RdRp and is believed to be translated as a fusion with the 5' ORF via -1 ribosomal frameshifting at a G_GGA a large number of SNPs were identified in both ORFs (184 synonymous, 32 nonsynonymous in ORF1; 172 synonymous, 40 nonsynonymous in ORF2). a large number of SNPs were identified in both. sequences were also identified in searches of the NCBI transcriptome shotgun assembly database. they include JP306102 from lepeophtheirus salmonis (salmon louse, an arthropod), JP089782 from Mengenilla moldrzyki (a strepsipteran insect), EZ959541, HP663044, EZ941741, EZ958863 and HP643964 from Bemisia tabaci (silverle contigs KF298275 (2507 nt) and KF298276 (3074 nt) each have about 40% amino acid identity. the sequences are highly divergent from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 20S and 23S RNA narnaviruses, with amino acid identities averaged over the whole ORF of just 12\u201315%. 147 SNPs were predominantly synonymous (120 SNPs) with respect to the RdRp amino acid sequence. the large number of SNPs suggest that KF298276 derives from a bona fide virus rather than a transcribed genome-integrated sequence. a long reverse-direction ORF is not present in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 20S and 23S RNA narnaviruses. a long reverse-direction ORF is not present in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 20S and 23S RNA narnaviruses. reverse-frame ORF may represent a bona fide protein-coding sequence. narnavirus-like KF298275 and KF298276 and related sequences have been collapsed. sequences similar to other RNA viruses of fungi and plants infect mitochondria of fungi. i and plants have bipartite dsRNA genomes with one segment encoding the RdRp and the other segment encoding a capsid protein. despite relatively high coverage (98-fold), no SNPs were detected for this contig. a nearly complete entomobirnavirus genome was assembled from adult culicine mosquitoes. a partial flavivirus-related sequence was most closely related to Culex flavivirus and other ISFs. further ISFs have been isolated from mosquitoes: Aedes flavivirus (AeFV) from chironomids in japan [65], Quang Binh virus (QBV) from Culex tritaeniorhynchus in Vietnam [66] and Nakiwogo virus (NAKV) from mansonia africana nigerrima in Uganda [63]. flavivirus RNA has recently been discovered in phlebotomine we may hypothesise a common source of virus association or infection for all three dipteran groups (mosquitoes, phlebotomines, chironomids), potentially related to a shared environment and/or transmission and maintenance cycles. phlebotomine females are blood feeders, using food sources that include nectar and honeydew. future study includes field testing of dipteran eggs versus larval and adult specimens with complementary experimental infection studies. the potential involvement of shared microparasites, e.g. mites, in ISF and other related viral transmission cycles has never been addressed. the detection of novel orbivirus sequences in both culicine and anopheline mosquitoes may warrant further study. we also identified sequences related to Spissistilus festinus virus 1 (SpFV1) and Circulifer tenellus virus 1 (CiTV1). the sequences identified in the present study are certainly of viral origin. our methods do not allow us to definitively distinguish sequences of bona fide viruses from RNA transcripts of genome-integrated virus sequences. a number of plant-virus-like sequences (not reported) were detected in samples 7 and 9. the viral RdRp tends to evolve more slowly than other regions of an RNA virus genome. this may be because the RdRp tends to evolve more slowly than other regions of an RNA virus genome. this is also true for integrated viruses based on blastp analysis. this strategy enabled the construction of two complete or nearly complete virus genomes. all exhibited low amino acid sequence identities (24-42%) to known viruses."}
