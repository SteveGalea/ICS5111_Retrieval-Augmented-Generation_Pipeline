{"summary": "PED is a serious health problem in suckling and nursing pigs. the mortality rate can be as high as 100% in 10-day-old or younger piglets. since late 2010, millions of piglets have been killed in china during PED outbreaks. a total of 70 rectal swab samples were collected from 70 piglets infected with PEDV from October 2010 to march 2012. the rectal swabs were soaked in PBS buffer supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. the supernatant fluids were stored at \u201380\u00b0C until used. RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). the supernatant (200 L) containing PEDV was mixed with 1 mL of TRIzol Reagent. the suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 g and dried. Primers Pairs of sense and antisense primers were designed and aligned based on the nt sequence of the S, M, ORF3 genes from the GenBank database. these primers were used to amplify the PEDV gene of interest. predenaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. RT-PCR products were visualized via electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. bands of the correct size were excised and purified using TaKaRa miniBEST Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit the rectal swabs were soaked in PBS buffer supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (2 mg/mL) and centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min to collect the supernatant fluids. the supernatant fluids were stored at \u201380\u00b0C until used. RNA Extraction RNA was extracted from the supernatant using TRIzol Reagent. the supernatant (200 L) containing PEDV was mixed with 1 mL of TRIzol Reagent. the suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 g. RT-PCR and Sequencing RT-PCR was performed using PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR Kit Ver. 2 (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) Primers S-F and S-R, ORF3-F and ORF3-R, and M-F and M-R, respectively, were used to amplify the partial S, ORF3 and M genes from PEDV. ified products were analyzed using the CLUSTALX v1.83, Bioedit v7.0.5.2 programs, and MegAlign software for alignment and sequence analysis. S, M, ORF3 nt and deduced aa sequences were compared with the PEDV reference strains listed in Table 2. a phylogenetic tree was generated based on the deduced aa sequences of the partial S gene. in all phylogenies, the reference aa sequences, observed in samples collected from previous outbreaks, tended to cluster near the root but had a poorly resolved branching structure. this was likely due to relatively low sequence divergence. aa mutations were detected at positions 44 (T S), 89 (G S), and 128 (Q E). the hydrophobicity of the deduced aa for these newly isolated strains was then analyzed. the mutation impact on the hydrophobicity of S protein was confirmed. phylogenetic analysis based on ORF3 aa; point mutations analysis of ORF3 aa; hydrophobic analysis of S aa. all of the newly isolated strains had intact ORFs that could regulate translation of a 224 aa residues. strains showed 97.8\u2013100% aa sequence homogeneity within the group. all newly isolated strains were placed into one subgroup. the other subgroup contained vaccine strains CV777 and early Chinese strains CH/S and LZC. a mutation at position 13 (E Q) altered the hydrophobicity of the N terminus of the M protein. the other aa mutations, such as those at position 42 (V A) and 214 (A S), did not influence hydrophobicity of the M protein. a phylogenetic tree was generated based on the deduced aa sequences. results analyzed using NJ method with bootstrap support indicated that viruses from more recent infections formed three well-supported lineages that tended to cluster far from the root. these lineages were denoted as groups I, II, and III in the S phylogenies. the newly isolated strains (96.1\u2013100%) was higher than that observed between the attenuated-type PEDVs and the newly isolated strains. the newly isolated strain DR13 showed higher homology (97.2\u201398.7% for nt and 96.7\u201399.4% for aa) than both attenuated DR13 (89.6\u201390.7% for nt and 91.1\u201393.3% for aa) and CV777 (89.9\u201391% for n cross asterisk indicated present isolates; triangle indicated attenuated strains; box indicated point mutations. mutations observed at aa positions 7 (Q X), 80 (V F) and 182 (H Q/Y) did not impact hydrophobicity. newly isolated strains showed 98.5\u2013100% nt sequence homogeneity within the group. all PEDV field strains isolated during recent outbreaks had a single ORF of 681 nt, which encoded a protein of 227 aa. compared to PEDV CV777, the new isolates had 11 nt mutations leading to 3 aa mutations leading to 3 aa mutations. partial S, ORF3, and M genes from 16 PEDV strains isolated from the current Chinese PEDV outbreak were amplified and sequenced. the new strains were highly homologous with each other but less similar to the vaccine strain CV777 or the virulent strain Chinju99 from Korea. previous studies showed that the S glycoprotein played an important role in viral attachment and penetration and was the neutralizing antibodies-inducing region due to the 2 B-cell linear epitopes. current strains showed a significant hydrophobic alternation. this change was induced by a 4\u20139 aa mutations in the neutralizing epitope region of the current isolates. current isolates shared 98.5\u2013100% and 97.8\u2013100% similarity in their nt and aa sequences. hydrophobicity analysis indicated there was only one mutation at aa 13 (E Q) that would have affected the hydrophobicity of the M protein. however, the function of this mutation requires further investigation."}
