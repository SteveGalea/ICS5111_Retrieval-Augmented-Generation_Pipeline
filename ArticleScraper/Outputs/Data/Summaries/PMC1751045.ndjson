{"summary": "a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation was independently associated with a virus-positive sample. a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation was independently associated with better survival. the number of studies that document the presence of viruses in respiratory samples of critically ill patients is currently growing in the literature [7-9] the number of studies that document the presence of viruses in respiratory samples of critically ill patients is currently growing in the literature. immunocompromised status defined as HIV infection, neoplasia, innate immunity deficit, cystic fibrosis, chronic use of steroids or immunosuppressive drugs. other comorbidities such as diabetes, COPD/asthma or cardiovascular diseases were also recorded at admission. antiviral drugs could be used during the study period for proven herpes simplex virus or cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompromised patients. Pneumonia was defined as any acute septic episode with respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum production, dyspnea, pleuretic chest pain or altered mental status) multivariable modeling is a tradeoff between model complexity and parcimony. we selected a level of alpha risk 0.25 to remain in the multivariable model [20] to avoid partial confusion bias. all tests were two-sided. tracheobronchial aspirates performed at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, indirect immunofluorescence assay or molecular methods (PCR or RT-PCR) tracheobronchial aspirates performed at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, by indirect immunofluorescence assay or by molecular methods (PCR or RT-PCR) cerbation of COPD was defined according to the NHLBI/WHO Workshop Summary [19]. Respiratory disorder was defined as respiratory distress alone or any other reasons for admission with associated respiratory symptoms. quantitative data were expressed as the mean standard deviation or as the median (range) and percentage (95% confidence interval), respectively. the prevalence of admitted patients with at least one virus-positive respiratory sample was 41/187 (22%; 95% confidence interval, 16\u201328) at the time of intubation. the main reason for admission was respiratory distress alone (77/187), including 46 cases of pneumonia, nine cases of acute COPD/asthma exacerbations, 11 cases of pulmonary edema. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation type II score 18.0 9.3 20.9 8.3 0.057 Simplified Acute Physiology score II 46.8 18.9 51.5 17.3 0.13 Logistic organ dysfunction system 6.8 3.9 7.8 3.8 0.14 Data are presented as the mean standard deviation or number (%), when appropriate. methods Diagnostic method Bacteria detected at enrolment 9 Yes Respiratory distress COPD/asthma exacerbation Enterovirus Yes RT-PCR No 14 Yes Coma Aspiration pneumonia Rhinovirus Yes RT-PCR No 16 No Septic shock No Rhinovirus Yes RT-PCR + culture No 21 Yes Respiratory distress COPD/asthma exacerbation Herpes simplex virus 1 No Culture No 30 Yes Hemorrhagic 78 No Septic shock Pneumonia Rhinovirus Yes RT-PCR Legionella 81 No Septic shock Pneumonia Rhinovirus Yes Culture No 82 Yes Respiratory distress COPD/asthma exacerbation Rhinovirus Yes Culture No 85 Yes Respiratory distress Pneumonia Herpes simplex virus 1 No Culture MSSA + serratia 94 No Acute hepatitis Pneumonia Rhinovirus Yes RT-PCR culture No 140 No Respiratory distress Pneumonia Rhinovirus Yes RT-PCR + culture No 141 No Respiratory distress Pulmonary edema Rhinovirus Yes RT-PCR No 142 No Respiratory distress Pneumonia Herpes simplex virus 1 No Culture Escherichia coli 143 No Respiratory distress Pneumonia Varicella zoster virus Yes RT-PCR No 144 No Respiratory distress Pneumonia Herpe a virus-positive sample did not predict the time to ventilator-associated pneumonia in group 1 or in group 2 or overall. a virus-positive sample did not predict the time to ventilator-associated pneumonia in group 1 or in group 2 or overall. a virus-positive sample did not predict the time to ventilator-associated pneumonia in group 1. 0.093 Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 1.015 (0.999\u20131.032) 0.072 1.012 (0.995\u20131.029) 0.16 Logistic organ dysfunction system 1.020 (0.948\u20131.098) 0.60 Admission for cardiogenic shock/cardiac arrest 2.588 (1.146\u20135.844) 0.022 2.106 (0.924\u20134.802) 0.08 Virus-positive sample 0. 233 (0.083\u20130.653) 0.003 0.273 (0.096\u2013 bronchial aspirate was taken for viral studies in 187 patients. the prevalence of admitted patients with at least one virus-positive respiratory sample was 41/187 (22%;
