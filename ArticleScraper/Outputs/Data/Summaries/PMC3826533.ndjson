{"summary": "rLa-EBOVGP is more resistant to NDV antiserum than the vector NDV. rLa-EBOVGP is moderately sensitive to EBOV GP antiserum. rLa-EBOVGP uses macropinocytosis as the major internalization pathway for cell entry. several recombinant GP-expressing viruses have been developed. replication-defective adenovirus-5 (rAd5) [13,14], replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus [15,16], Newcastle diseases virus (NDV)[17], rabies virus (RV) [18] and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPAIV) a recombinant lentogenic NDV expressing EBOV GP was immunogenic. it was incorporated into the recombinant NDV particles, which raised a serious question. the safety and efficacy of EBOV GP has been demonstrated in mice. expression of EBOV GP does not increase the pathogenicity of the NDV vector in poultry or mice. rLa-EBOVGP-infected BHK-21 cells were stained with mouse anti-EBOV GP antiserum. rLa-EBOVGP-infected BHK-21 cells were not stained with antiserum. rLa-EBOVGP showed similar growth properties to those of rLa. rLa-EBOVGP retained its low pathogenicity in eggs and chickens. rLa-EBOVGP retained its low pathogenicity in eggs and chickens. rLa-ZEBOVGP was expressed by rLa-EBOVGP and incorporated into the recombinant NDV particles. this indicates that the GP protein was expressed by rLa-EBOVGP and incorporated into the recombinant NDV particles. rLa depends on exogenous trypsin-like extracellular proteases. confluent cells were infected with rLa-cell, rLa-cell/TPCK, rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-ZEBOVGP-cell/TPCK, rLa-egg, or rLa-EBOVGP-egg at MOIs of 0.05. the cells were fixed at different time points and detected with chicken anti-NDV antiserum, then incubated with an FITC-conjugated rabbit anti- the anti-NDV antiserum and anti-EBOV GP antiserum reduced the infection with each rLa-EBOVGP virus by about 90% and 60%, respectively. infection with rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK, or rLa-EBOVGP-cell was completely blocked. rLa-EBOVGP uses macropinocytosis as the major internalization pathway for cell entry NVD envelope glycoproteins HN and F usually bind to receptor and induce virus-cell membrane fusion at neutral pH. a previous study reported that NDV can also partially enter the host cells by caveolae-mediated endocytosis [46,49] in a GP-dependent manner. infection by rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK, or rLa-EBOVGP-egg was not inhibited in cells pretreated with MCD. pretreatment with a combination of IPA3 and MCD almost completely blocked the infection of cells by rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK, and rLa-EBOVGP-egg. recombinant rLa-EBOVGP uses macropinocytosis as its major internalization pathway for cell entry, rather than the direct fusion at the cell plasma membrane at neutral pH like NDV. cells were washed and infected with 5 102 TCID50 of rLa-egg, rLa-EBOVGP-egg, rLa-cell/TPCK rLa-EBOVGP-cell, or rLa-EBOVGP-cell/ rLa-EBOVGP-infected cells were stained with mouse anti-EBOV GP antiserum. rLa-EBOVGP-infected BHK-21 cells were not stained with the antiserum. rLa-EBOVGP retained its low pathogenicity in eggs and chickens. mice were inoculated either intramuscularly (i.m.) or intranasally (i.n.) with a high dose of rLa-EBOVGP. showed no signs of sickness or death, and did not differ in weight gain. expression of EBOV GP does not increase pathogenicity of the NDV vector. rLa and rLa-EBOVGP were propagated in eggs (rLa-egg and rLa-EBOVGP-egg, respectively) and in BHK-21 cells with or without TPCK-trypsin (Sigma) in the medium. these prepared viruses were then used to infect BHK-21 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02\u20130.05 with no exogenous trypsin in the medium. rLa-EBOVGP is more resistant to NDV antiserum than vector NDV. rLa-EBOVGP is partially sensitive to EBOV antiserum. rLa-egg and rLa-cell were resistant to mouse anti-EBOV GP antiserum. rLa-cell/TPCK, rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-EBOVGP-cell, rLa-egg, and nave mouse serum were mixed individually with chicken anti-NDV antiserum. after incubation, the viruses were allowed to infect BHK-21 cells for 1 h. rLa-EBOV GP is incorporated into the vector NDV particles. it is necessary to determine whether the incorporation of the GP protein alters the endocytosis pattern of rLa-EBOVGP during infection. IPA3 inhibits the activation of PAK1 kinase, which is required for macropinocytosis [50,51] and MCD sequesters cholesterol from the cell membrane. rLa-EBOVGP-egg, rLa-EBOVGP-egg and rLa-EBOVGP-egg also inhibited the infection of cells by rLa-cell/TPCK and rLa-EBOVGP-egg. we use 800 mU/ml NA to treat cells with chemical inhibitors together with IPA3 or alone before infection. the NA + IPA3 treatment could block 90% of the recombinant viruses from infection. the cells were washed and infected with 5 102 TCID50 of rLa-egg, rLa-EBOVGP-egg, rLa-cell/TPCK rLa-EBOVGP-cell, or rLa-EBOVGP-cell/TPCK at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. at 7 h after infection, the cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with chicken anti-NDV antiserum limited replication in mammalian cells of low-pathogenic NDV is also determined by its trypsin-independent infectivity. the virus behaves like a velogenic NDV in mammalian host cells. the ability of foreign envelope proteins to function as new cell-entry proteins has also been demonstrated in other enveloped RNA viruses. the recombinant hPIV3 was more sensitive to neutralizing antibody directed against EBOV than to neutralizing antibody directed against hPIV3. the recombinant hPIV3 was prepared in BHK-21 cells in the absence of trypsin so the membrane fusion function of the F protein, essential for viral entry, was completely abolished. the recombinant hPIV3 particle independently mediated the cell entry of the recombinant NDV the inhibition of macropinocytosis abolished the infectivity of rLa-EBOVGP. the direct fusion between rLa-EBOVGP and the plasma membrane facilitated by F/HN may not allow viral entry into the cell. the exact mechanism underlying this predominance requires further investigation. the cDNA of the GP gene of Zaire EBOV was amplified from synthesized cDNA. the cDNA was flanked by the restriction site for endonuclease PmeI. the GP gene was digested with PmeI and then inserted into the P\u2013M intergenic region at nucleotide position 3165 of the NDV genome. aldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and then blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. cells were then incubated with mouse anti-EBOV GP antiserum or chicken anti-NDV antiserum for 1 h at room temperature. GP antiserum as the primary antibody and horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-chicken or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G as the secondary antibody. the bands were visualized with ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Health Science) on Kodak X-ray film. mice were monitored daily to detect any weight changes, signs of illness, or death. chemical inhibition of virus internalization pathways BHK-21 cells were pretreated with either the inhibitor 10 M IPA3 (Sigma) or 10 mM MCD (Sigma) alone or together at 37\u00b0C. another plate of BHK-21 cells were pretreated with 800 mU/ml bacterial neuraminadase (NA, Sigma N2876) alone or together. cells for virus rescue and the BHK-21 cells for virus growth and titration were maintained in complete Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) the NDV strains were propagated and titrated in 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs [44] or BHK-21 cells in the presence or absence of TPCK-trypsin. the resultant recombinant virus was designated rLa-EBOVGP. cells were grown in 24-well plates or plated on cover slips in dishes. the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-EBOV GP antiserum. Western blotting egg-propagated rLa and rLa-EBOVGP were purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. the total protein (5 g) of each purified virus was subjected to SDS\u2013PAGE under denaturing conditions. the target band was detected with chicken anti-NDV antiserum or mouse anti-EBOV GP antiserum as the primary antibody. two groups of 10 six-week-old female Balb/c mice were inoculated i.m. with 108 EID50 of rLa-EBOVGP or rLa. the third group of 10 mice was inoculated i.m. with 0.1 mL and 0.03 mL of PBS as the mock-infection control. rLa-EBOVGP were detected with immunofluorescence assay. the mean number of flurorecent possitive cells of a minimum of 5 fields of view were counted. the data was expressed as means and standard deviation."}
