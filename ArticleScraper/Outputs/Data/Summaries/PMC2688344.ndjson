{"summary": "colorectal cancer accounts for about 10% of cancer deaths annually. more will develop metastasis during follow-up. there are currently no suitable tumour markers for early diagnosis. prospective studies are needed in a more heterogeneous population of patients at risk. compared tissue protein profiles of different stages along the so-called adenoma-carcinoma sequence can provide knowledge on the extent of transformation that has occurred in different histologic subtypes of polyps. the study was approved by the local medical ethics committees of both institutes. a serum sample was collected from each participant either before colonoscopy or before treatment of a colorectal tumour. a second serum sample was collected from CRC patients at least 3 weeks after surgery if no adjuvant chemotherapy was given. lysates were thawed on ice, centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 5 min. the supernatant collected for protein profiling was determined using the 2D-Quant Kit. samples were randomly attributed to one of nine measurement series before analysis. patients included in two hospitals: the Slotervaart Hospital or the Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital. a serum sample was collected from each participant either before colonoscopy or before treatment of a colorectal tumour. a second serum sample was collected from CRC patients at least 3 weeks after surgery if no adjuvant chemotherapy was given. tissues were cut into smaller blocks, placed into a pre-cooled shaking flask with a stainless steel ball and then pulverised in three rounds of shaking (55s) and cooling in liquid nitrogen (3 min). 10 mg of frozen tissue powder was then added to 100 l of denaturation buffer consisting of 9 M urea, 2% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) and 1% di an average of 105 laser shots per spectrum at intensity 140 and detector sensitivity 6 was collected. the focus mass was set to 3000 Da. settings for tissue analysis were optimised independently. results Patients and samples In total, 731 patients with an indication for colonoscopy were asked for participation in this study. 41 were found ineligible according to the inclusion criteria, 21 did not give informed consent and 47 did not provide a serum sample for analysis. the total number of patients evaluable for serum protein profiling was 609. after previous AP 96 (13.1%) Altered bowel habits/movements 124 (17.0%) Family history of AP or CRC and rectal blood loss 14 (1.9%) Suspected malignancy (signs of bowel obstruction, suspect lesion by imaging) 21 (2.9%) FAP gene mutation carrier 3 (0.4%) At risk for HNPCC 33 (4.5%) Confirmed HNPCC mutation carrier 12 (1.6%) Other/unknown 36 (4.9%) Table 2a.
