{"summary": "an outbreak of chikungunya was reported in the village of Palpara in Tangail district, 100 km northwest of the capital, Dhaka. the outbreak investigation team visited every household in the outbreak village and interviewed 1,933 individuals from 460 households. a total of 364 (18%) individuals reported having suffered from symptoms consistent with chikungunya infection. females were 1.5 times more likely to get infected than males. children (defined as those under 16 y) were at similar risk to adults (relative risk of 0.9, 95% CI: 0.8\u20131.2) neighborhood transmission was the largest contributor to the effective reproductive number. we calculated the basic reproductive number for each individual based on where he or she lived and the individual characteristics of the community. we then mapped how the basic reproductive number differed over the study area. to assess model fit we simulated epidemics starting from day 80. we divided the outbreak area into 50 50-m grid cells. compared the mean proportion of individuals that lived in that cell with the observed proportion that were positive. to assess the impact of these undetected infections on our estimates, we simulated outbreaks based on the spatial structure of our study population. we randomly assigned 0% (to reflect outbreaks with no undetected infections), 20%, 40%, 60%, or 80% of cases as unobserved infections. we then estimated the parameters using only observed cases.

Parameters were estimated within a Bayesian MCMC framework. we observed only dates of symptom onset, not when infections occurred. there may have been uncertainty in the recollection of precise dates of symptom onset. dates of symptom onset and dates of infection were considered as augmented data (i.e. nuisance parameters) of the inferential framework. the joint posterior distribution of augmented data and model parameters is proportional to P ( z, | y ) P ( y | z ) P ( z | ) is the observation model. the error with which individuals estimated their date of symptom onset was normally distributed with mean zero and SD of 3 d. a separate field study was conducted in 52 randomly selected rural communities from across Bangladesh. the study was exempt from Institutional Review Board review. participants provided informed consent for participation. to confirm that the outbreak was due to chikungunya, infection was confirmed using IgM ELISA in a subset of 175 cases (SD BIOLINE) the model was used to estimate the role that the location and structure of households, sex, age, and antimosquito coils had on transmission dynamics. sex characterizes the role of sex on risk of infection. age characterizes the role of age on risk of infection. control characterizes whether the household reported daily use of antimosquito coils. Fig. S4. Generation time distribution with both an EIP of 2 d and an EIP of 5 d. we estimate both the timing (through a change-point parameter ) of a change and the magnitude (through parameter late) new tab The effective reproductive number R for individual j early in the epidemic is the sum of the terms: R j = i j ( x i, x j) Parameters were estimated within a Bayesian MCMC framework. we observed only dates of symptom onset, not when infections occurred. true dates of symptom onset and dates of infection were considered as augmented data. the joint posterior distribution of augmented data and model parameters is proportional to P ( z, | y ) P ( z | ) P ( z | ) is the observation model. the error with which individuals estimated their date of symptom onset was normally distributed with mean zero and SD of 3 d and (ii) the incubation period of chikungunya was exponentially distributed with a mean of 3 d (25). collected daily mean temperature and daily rainfall data for each 2-wk period. collected data from 52 randomly selected rural communities across the country. human incubation period (HI) used a truncated exponential distribution with a mean of 3 d (25) and a maximum time of 1 wk. it is during this time that humans can transmit to mosquitoes [human to mosquito transmission (HM)] during an outbreak in Reunion Island, 39% of patients were shown to still be viremic 3 d after symptom onset (26). values of MI less than 0 were considered unsuccessful onward infections. this approach assumes that mosquitoes have a constant probability of survival. individuals who are viremic for longer are more likely to infect mosquitoes. an individual that was a case, the contribution is P i = P ( c i = 1, t i, s i ) = h ( s i t i ) exp ( t = 0 t i 1 i ( t ) ) exp ( t = 0 t i 1 i ( t ) ) exp ( t = 0 t i ) exp ( t = 0 t for cases, the true onset day of symptoms was between the first reported onset day and the last day of the outbreak investigation. for all parameters except for the transmission kernel parameter, we used an exponential prior distribution with a log(mean) equal to zero and a log(variance) equal to one. at every iteration, all parameters were updated once. for adding cases, an individual is randomly selected from all candidates. a previously augmented case is randomly selected from all augmented cases. the case status is updated to reflect that it is no longer a case. we forward simulated outbreaks from the start of august. for each day from the start of august, for each pairwise infection, we calculated the probability of infecting each other individual in the community. the probability (p) for each pairwise infection was calculated using Eq. 1. ii) The probability of observing a case relative to observing anyone at different distances from an index case, using the tau function (29, 30) this captures the overall clustering of cases at different distances and has been used for dengue, chikungunya, and other infectious diseases (29\u201331). we randomly selected up to two individuals to wear an IgotU GPS logger for a period of 4 d. we repeated the process until we had at least one male and one female individual from each age group. the devices contain a motion detector that switches the device off if it is not being worn. the generation time distribution for chikungunya is not well understood. we used a truncated exponential distribution with a mean of 3 d (25) and a maximum time of 1 wk. human to mosquito transmission. Symptoms appear at the same time as individuals become viremic. we drew the age at which the mosquito became infected (MAI) using a random exponential distribution with mean of 2 d. the total period of MI was then equal to MLS MAI EIP. human incubation period is the time between infection and the time of symptom onset. for the human incubation period we used a truncated exponential distribution with a mean of 3 d (25) and a maximum time of 1 wk. human to mosquito transmission. Symptoms appear at the same time as individuals become viremic 3 d after symptom onset (26). we drew the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) for that mosquito as a random exponential distribution with mean of 2 d. the total period of MI was then equal to MLS MAI EIP. for an individual that was a case, the contribution is P i = P ( c i = 1, t i, s i ) = exp ( t = 0 T i ( t ). the second term is the probability to be infected on day ti. the final term is the probability of having escaped infection up to that point. the augmented datasets have the following characteristics: (i) Infection events in cases occur before symptom onset; (ii) for cases, the true onset day of symptoms was between the first reported onset day and the last day of the outbreak investigation. at every iteration, all parameters were updated once. the proportion of undetected cases was known. for every MCMC iteration, the model used the same MCMC sampling scheme. however, there is an additional step that adds and removes cases. the model used the same MCMC sampling scheme as above. however, there is an additional step that adds and removes cases. for adding cases, an individual is randomly selected from all candidates. parameter and the transmission kernel parameter were underestimated when 40% or more of the cases went undetected. this resulted in an underestimate of the proportion of transmission events that occurred at the within-household level and an overestimate of the mean transmission distance. in situations where RJ-MCMC is used, we repeated the same analysis but added a RJ-MCMC step. the probability (p) for each pairwise infection was calculated using Eq. 1. The probability of infecting previously infected individuals was 0. We drew from a Bernoulli distribution with probability p of success to decide whether an infection occurred or not. we overlaid a 50 50-m grid over the community and within each cell calculated the proportion of individuals that were infected. we then compared the mean proportion of infected individuals across all simulations with the observed proportion of infected individuals. the presence of undetected cases appeared to result in overestimation of the mean transmission kernel. the results of these simulations are shown in Fig. S2. larger mean transmission distances resulted in slightly larger epidemics. larger mean transmission distances also resulted in reduced clustering of cases. we compared the probability that a female participant was within 50 m of his or her home at any time point relative to the probability that a male participant was that distance from his or her home. ninety-five percent CIs were obtained from 500 bootstrap resamples where each participant was the resampling unit. the GPS tracker worn by the study participants logged the location of the individual every 2 min over a period of 4 d. the devices contain a motion detector that switches the device off if it is not being carried. the study team collected the units and downloaded all of the coordinate information."}
