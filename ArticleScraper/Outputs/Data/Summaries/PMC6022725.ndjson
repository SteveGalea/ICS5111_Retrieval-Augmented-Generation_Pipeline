{"summary": "internet search query data have been identified as a valuable source for the detection of emerging influenza epidemics. but the selection of the search queries and the adoption of prediction methods are crucial challenges when it comes to improving predictions. the results demonstrated the feasibility of using internet search query data as the complementary data source for influenza surveillance. there are about three to five million cases of severe illnesses, and about 2.9 to 6.5 million deaths each year caused by influenza epidemics. a national noticeable infectious disease reporting system has been established to continuously report the influenza cases in China. the system reports the flu activity one month before, putting the flu data lagged for a month. the application of SVM to classification and regression has been a hot topic recently. this article will construct a forecasting model for influenza based on the ensemble data integrating traditional influenza cases data. china has a vast territory that spans tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. it is a large challenge to establish an influenza prediction mechanism in the whole country. the feasibility of influenza prediction models based on internet search query data is still unknown. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to explore the correlation between influenza-related search queries and the reported number of influenza cases in Liaoning. the selection of maximum cross-correlation coefficient has been proposed in previous studies. the selection of maximum cross-correlation coefficient has been proposed in previous studies. root Mean Square Percentage Error, a measure of the percent difference between predicted and true values, is defined as: RMSE = 1 n i = 1 n ( y i y i y i ) 100 % (2) Mean Absolute Percentage Error, is the mean or average of the absolute percentage errors of forecasts and is defined as: MAPE = 1 n i = 1 n | y i y i y i | the influenza case surveillance data was divided into two parts, the fitting dataset and the validation dataset in SVM regression model. the rest 15 months\u2019 data from October 2014 to December 2015 was used as the test set for model prediction. three metrics were adopted to measure the performance of the SVM regression model. root Mean Square Percentage Error, a measure of the percent difference between predicted and true values, is defined as: RMSE = 1 n i = 1 n ( y i y i y i ) 100 % (2) Mean Absolute Percentage Error, is the mean or average of the absolute percentage errors of forecasts. there were 46 search terms left due to the available sequential data within one calendar year during the study period. the correlation coefficients were 0.672, 0.498 and 0.151 at the lag time of one month, two months and three months respectively. the reported number of influenza cases at the lag time of one month has shown the strongest correlation. 0.032 0.142 0.104 0.101 0.039 How to prevent flu 0.023 0.025 0.056 0.007 0.006 Viral flu 0.484** 0.339** 0.234 0.023 0.587** How to prevent flu 0.129 0.087 0.201 0.125 0.014 Spanish flu 0.459** 0.479** 0.409** 0.491** Flu prevention 0.178 0.012 0.092 0.133 0.380* Side effects of flu vaccine 0.084 0.379** 0.381** 0.200 Influenza transmission route 0.228 0.1 0.09 0.076 0.346 The route of transmission of flu 0.216 0.011 0.12 0.164 0.207 Treatment program of A type H1N1 flu 0.145 0.19 0.24 0.304* 0.102 Flu (space) symptom 0.147 0.042 0.068 0.157 0.358 H1N1 flu symptom 0.346** 0.196 0.141 0.064 0.260 Sheep flu 0.011 0.038 0.053 VM regression model The mathematical formula of SVM regression model is provided below:, * are Lagrangian operator.
