{"summary": "aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are increasingly being recognized as important sources for nosocomial transmission of emerging viruses. intubation was investigated as a possible cause of EBOV transmission among health-care workers (HCWs) in the united states. aerosols are particles suspended in air that can contain a variety of pathogens, including viruses. many divide aerosols into small droplets and large droplets. small droplets have the potential to desiccate and form droplet nuclei. small droplets can be inhaled into the LRT, while large droplets can splash into the eyes or mouth and deposit in the URT. some respiratory viruses, like EBOV, are believed to transmit between people by both small and large droplets. it is unknown whether certain AGMPs generate either small or large droplets, or both. AGMP How/Where Aerosols may be Generated Bronchoscopy * Induced cough, respiratory tract Cardiopulmonary resuscitation * Induced cough, respiratory tract Noninvasive ventilation * (BiPAP, CPAP, HFOV) both manual ventilation, using a bag-valve-mask, and other forms of noninvasive ventilation are associated with SARS-CoV nosocomial transmission. a tracheotomy was associated with SARS-CoV transmission. it is important to recognize the range of AGMPs and the circumstances under which they might be performed on infected patients. researchers need to test whether certain procedures generate aerosols with infectious virus, either through hospital sampling or laboratory procedures. we used the following criteria to assess which viruses are high risk for HCWs performing AGMPs. the viruses that pose the highest risk to HCWs performing AGMPs may be emerging zoonotic viruses that rarely infect humans compared to human-adapted viruses. we included viruses that fit at least two of the previously mentioned classifications. laboratory workers infected by inhaling aerosols [23] i, ii. Viral RNA in NHP oral and nasal swabs [24] ii. Virus isolated from human throat swabs [25] ii, iii. Nosocomial transmission [26,27] Lower respiratory: ii. CCHF virus ii. Hantaviruses iii. Rift valley fever virus i, virus isolated from lung and sputum [33,34] Filoviridae i. Ebolaviruses ii. Marburg virus i, ii. NHPs infected by aerosol administration [35] Upper respiratory: i. Isolated from human saliva [37] i. Nosocomial transmission [1] i. Possible association with AGMPs [1] Lower respiratory: i. Viral RNA in pharyngeal and viruses evolve within their hosts to maintain an optimal balance between transmission (consequently virulence) and persistence. most of these high-risk viruses are highly infectious and virulent, but are not as efficient at transmitting and persisting as true human respiratory viruses. we need further experimental and epidemiological evidence to assess the risk of particular viruses. arenaviruses are found in the respiratory tracts of humans or animal models. arenavirus aerosol transmission could theoretically occur when aerosols are mechanically generated through AGMPs. other hantaviruses were aerosol transmitted to humans, either accidentally aerosolizing the virus or through inhaling aerosolized rodent excreta. both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV cause respiratory disease in humans. but it is unknown whether small-droplet or large-droplet aerosols are the modes of transmission for these viruses. AGMPs could possibly amplify an already established route of infection for these viruses. some influenza A viruses are known to transmit between humans via aerosols. but there is variation in the efficiency of human-to-human aerosol transmission of different influenza A viruses. henipaviruses do not seem as contagious through the aerosol route between people as other viruses in their family. arenaviruses can cause viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in humans. arenaviruses are found in the respiratory tracts of humans or animal models. hantaviruses can cause respiratory disease in humans, as in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), and were found in the respiratory tract [31], they do not seem to efficiently transmit between humans like typical respiratory viruses. however, certain bunyaviruses found in human- or animal-model respiratory tracts, including CCHF virus, hantaviruses, and Rift valley fever virus, could gain the route of aerosol transmission. viruses belonging to other species of ebolaviruses that are pathogenic in humans, as well as another filovirus, Marburg virus, could share similar transmission properties. influenza viruses are not safe from novel influenza A virus subtypes emerging from animals, namely avian and swine influenza A viruses. henipaviruses do not seem to be as contagious through the aerosol route between people as other viruses in their family. henipaviruses do not seem to be as contagious through the aerosol route between people as other viruses in their family. bioaerosal samplers and stationary room samplers were used to detect influenza A virus RNA in an emergency department. this allowed the authors to determine which procedures were associated with a higher concentration of viral RNA in aerosols. bronchoscopy and intubation are performed on animal models of the high-risk viral diseases we identified. the CDC updated its guidelines regarding precautions to prevent the transmission of EBOV in health-care settings. the updated guidelines further emphasized proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation when performing AGMPs on patients with VHFs, SARS-CoV, and avian or pandemic influenza A viruses. ambiguity of which procedures and viruses require additional protective measures during AGMPs may lead to breaches in protocol. if we design proactive infection control guidelines, we must conduct collaborative clinical and scientific research on nosocomial virus transmission and AGMPs."}
