{"summary": "innate immune system uses adaptive immune system to mount a specific immune response in the aim of disease prevention. production of effective vaccines can be limited by genetic instability leading to reversion of an attenuated strain to a virulent strain with resultant infection in the vaccinated individual. mucosal surfaces serve as the entry sites for the majority of infectious pathogens, including respiratory viruses. TLRs are a family of PRRs that are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans. they consist of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat and a cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR) homolog domain. TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression and respond to different PAMPs. dsRNA interaction with RIG-I/MDA5 triggers IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) activation followed by type I IFN induction through the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS)/ IFN- promoter stimulator 1 adapter. double-stranded RNA is recognized in the cytosol by RIG-I or in the endosome by TLR3. cytokines through activation of TFs NF-B and activating protein 1 (AP-1) in the endosome, binding of ssRNA to TLR7 recruits MyD88 which can interact with TRAF6 or TRAF3. the TLR7, MyD88, TRAF6 pathway intersects with the TLR3 TRAF6 pathway to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. the more differentiated airway epithelial cells have increased resistance to rhinovirus infection suggests an important role for TLR3 in some respiratory tract infections [28]. all TLRs, except TLR3, share a common signalling pathway that depends on myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) TLR3 mediated apoptosis occurs through its interaction with TRIF. it can then interact with FADD and caspase-8, Fig. (1). this induction of apoptosis by TLR3 is an important contributor to host defence since it limits the spread of viral infection [24]. avian influenza A viruses with subtypes H5N1, H6N1 [37], H7N2 [38], H7N3 [38, 39], H7N7 [39-42] and H9N2 [39, 43] have caused outbreaks in poultry in africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America. fortunately the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 strain caused relatively mild disease in the majority of people infected. human DCs that capture dead cells containing influenza virus produce cytokines, undergo maturation and expand CD4(+) T helper cells but fail to elicit CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell responses against antigens from the dead cells. pulmonary cellular immunity may be very important in protecting nave natural hosts against lethal influenza viruses. there are significant differences in cytokine responses between H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses, primarily in relation to TNF-, IFN-, IL-6, IP-10 and RANTES. more recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) are more potent at inducing IP-10 [54-56]. IL-1, IFN- and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 in lung and lymphoid tissue were elevated in mice infected with either a lethal (A/Hong Kong/483/97) or nonlethal (A/Hong Kong/486/97) H5N1 influenza virus. it appears to possess the capacity to limit the induction of immune responses by targeting and destroying lymphocytes. cytokine storm, systemic viral dissemination and alveolar flooding contribute to the lethality of influenza H5N1 disease. cytokine storm, systemic viral dissemination and alveolar flooding due to inhibition of cellular sodium channels contribute to the lethality of influenza H5N1 disease. mice have shown that TLR2 and TLR6 signaling in leukocytes can activate innate immunity against RSV. induction of most IFN-, cytokine-, chemokine- and PRR-related genes was MAVS dependent and MyD88 independent. only wild type mice showed pulmonary dysfunction, possibly attributable to inflammatory cytokine responses that cause airway obstruction. SARS is a form of viral pneumonia where infection encompasses the lower respiratory tract. clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), headache, and hypoxemia. clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), headache, and hypoxemia. coronavirus strain MHV-A59 infects the liver and brain. high cytokine levels could be abrogated by addition of T cells. more differentiated airway epithelial cells have increased resistance to rhinovirus infection. targeting EGFR may provide a selective therapy that dampens neutrophil-driven inflammation without compromising essential antiviral pathways mediated by PRRs. poly (IC) is not always a good model for studying the biology of live viral infections. rhinovirus inhibits IPS-1 in order to evade this arm of the immune response. the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 strain caused relatively mild disease in the majority of people infected. IL-18 is involved in controlling influenza virus replication in the lung. IL-2 is involved in T cell dependent IFN- production by NK cells. human influenza viruses preferentially infect nonciliated epithelial cells. avian viruses, as well as egg-adapted human virus variant with avian virus-like receptor specificity, infect ciliated cells. cytokine storm may lead to lung injury and multiple organ failure. IL-6, IP-10 and RANTES are elevated post-infection (p.i.) in human type II pneumocytes. more recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) are more potent at inducing IP-10. inactivation of the virus by UV irradiation abolished cytokine induction suggesting that virus replication was required. IL-1, IFN- and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 in lung and lymphoid tissue were elevated in mice infected with either a lethal (A/Hong Kong/483/97) or nonlethal (A/Hong Kong/486/97) H5N1 influenza virus. IL-1, TNF-, IFN-, MIP-1 and MIP-2 levels were elevated in a similar manner. RSV infection increases responsiveness of airway epithelial cells to subsequent bacterial ligands. TLR3 induction by RSV is mediated by IFN-dependent IFN- secreted from infected airway epithelial cells. PKR does not play a role in primary RSV-induced inflammation. induction of most IFN-, cytokine-, chemokine- and PRR-related genes was MAVS dependent and MyD88 independent. only wild type mice showed pulmonary dysfunction, possibly attributable to inflammatory cytokine responses that cause airway obstruction. clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), headache, hypoxemia. symptoms include mildly elevated aminotransferase levels, indicative of liver damage. Rhinovirus is a non-sense RNA virus of the Picornaviridae family. it proliferates in the ciliated epithelium of the upper respiratory tract. more differentiated airway epithelial cells have increased resistance to rhinovirus infection. poly (IC) is not always a good model for studying the biology of live viral infections. the RIG-I/MDA-5 pathway is important in the induction of type I IFN following rhinovirus infection. rhinovirus inhibits IPS-1 in order to evade this arm of the immune response. poly (IC) induction of IFN-, - and \u2013 and \u2013 was dependent on IPS-1. IP-10 and RANTES were dependent on both IPS-1 and TRIF. IPS-1 KO mice had severe defects in poly (IC)-enhanced antibody production. TRIF KO mice displayed modestly reduced antibody production. poly (IC) has also been shown to eliminate the histological lesions of graft-versus-host disease in mice [104] poly (IC) may thus provide short-term prophylaxis against influenza as suggested by the multi-day window of protection. poly (ICLC) administered post-influenza virus exposure was also less effective than when administered prophylactically. a single post-exposure treatment was found to be almost completely ineffective [90] oid tissue, up-regulated IL-4 and IL-12p40, and induced IFN-, - and -. cross-protection, partial protection or no protection was observed in those immunized with various H1N1 virus vaccines (A/PR/8, A/Beijing, A/Yamagata), heterologous influenza A vaccines (A/Guizhou \u2013 H3N2) or influenza B vaccines (B/Ibaraki, intramuscular (i.m.), i.p., i.n. or i.v. administration results in variable levels of toxicity depending on the animal species and doses being used. patients receiving multiple therapeutic doses of poly (IC) showed serious toxic reactions including hypotension, fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, injection site inflammation. poly (IC) upregulated expression and activation in synovial fluid fibroblasts and stimulated proinflammatory gene expression. RNA released from necrotic cells might act as an endogenous TLR3 ligand in rheumatoid arthritis. the potential link between TLR up-regulation and autoimmunity emphasizes the need for caution. a low molecular weight poly (ICLC) induced high IFN responses. in rabbits, a low molecular weight poly (ICLC) induced high IFN responses. a low molecular weight poly (ICLC) induced high IFN responses. hypercytokinemia with uncontrolled production of IFN-, IP-10, RANTES, IL-6, TNF- and numerous chemokines in the lung. apoptosis of lymphocytes in the spleen and lung and detection of cytokines in the brain are associated with influenza H5N1 pathology. mice given one lethal dose 50 (LD50) of the virus had a 50% survival rate. survival of treated mice decreased to 63% whereas untreated mice succumbed to infection. non-specific immune stimulators may be effective prophylaxis against a pandemic strain of influenza. poly (ICLC) was able to effectively protect aged mice against lethal murine cytomegalovirus infection and effectively induced IFN. severe combined immunodeficient mice were almost completely protected against murine cytomegalovirus infection by poly (ICLC) poly (ICLC) was able to induce IFN and NK cell cytotoxicity in these mice [141]. is required."}
