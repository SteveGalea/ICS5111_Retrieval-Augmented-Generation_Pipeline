{"summary": "the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is one of the most widely used approaches in clinical diagnostics, food safety testing, and environmental monitoring. the technique is usually carried out in a 96-well microtiter plate and involves a series of tedious processes, including sample introduction, incubation and washing. the technique is often carried out in a 96-well microtiter plate and involves a series of tedious processes, including sample introduction, incubation and washing. a compact immunoassay could increase coating capacity, but also accelerate an assay. the compact immunoassay system shows considerable potential in terms of speed and high-sensitivity for on-site diagnosis and for rapidly monitoring a disease. the working substrate solution of Amplex\u00ae Red was prepared by mixing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH = 7.4) and H2O2 solution just before use. all solutions and buffers were prepared with deionized water purified by milli-Q system from Nihon Millipore (Tokyo, Japan) the microwell immune device was composed of a MCP and a PDMS slide. the PDMS slide was reversibly attached to the surface of the MCP. the device was placed onto a laboratory-made holder combined with an electromotive x-y stage for movement to the detection point. schematical illustration of compact immunoassay performed in microchannels on MCP. each microchannel with 20 m diameter is acted as a micro-reactor with short diffusion distance (c). 2.3. performance of ELISA Method 2. assay Protocol for ELISA Using the microarray Device A sandwich immunoassay was performed to detect h-IgA. a coating solution of the 1st Ab was pipetted into microwells at an amount of 2.0 L/well, followed by incubation in a humidity controlled cabinet at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. waste solutions were removed by touching the bottom of the MCP with a filter paper. 1st Ab solution (10 g/mL) was pipetted into a 96-well plate at 100 L/well. after washing three times with 200 L/well of PBST buffer, a BSA (1%, w/v) blocking buffer was introduced at 200 L/well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. each concentration of h-IgA was performed with three replicates. human IgA kit includes affinity purified goat anti-human IgA (1st Ab), a human reference serum solution and goat anti-human IgA HRP conjugated (2nd Ab) was obtained from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX, USA) a neutral detergent (TCN-5) used for plate cleaning was obtained from Tomisc Company (Tokyo, Japan) a 96-well plate reader (SpectraFluor Plus) was obtained from Tecan (Melbourne, Australia) an incubator (SN-M 40S) was used for the PDMS thermo-curing. escence signal was detected by a photomultiplier (PMT) the magnified analog signal was then converted to digital data by a 12-bit A/D converter. the antibody/antigen recognition reaction took place in the compact microchannels in the MCP. each microchannel acts as a micro reactor, as shown in Figure 1c. the PDMS slide was immersed into a 50% ethanol solution and then deionized water for ultrasonic cleaning for 30 min. it was then dried at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min, respectively. a coating solution of the 1st Ab was pipetted into MCP-constructed microwells at 2.0 L/well, followed by incubation in a humidity controlled cabinet at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. each microwell was washed 3 times with PBST buffer. the 2nd Ab solution was then introduced into microwells at a volume of 2 L/well. the unabsorbed antibodies were removed by washing five times with PBST buffer. Saliva samples were collected from six healthy volunteers at 10:30 in the morning. the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. the supernatant was then isolated, and diluted with PBS buffer. the saliva samples were also measured using the same dilutions as the reference. with 3.0 L/well, different concentrations of h-IgA solutions were introduced into each microwell. each microwell was washed 3 times with PBST buffer. the 2nd Ab solution was then introduced into microwells at a volume of 2 L/well. Saliva sample measurement Saliva samples were collected from six healthy volunteers at around 10:30 in the morning. the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. the supernatant was then isolated, and diluted with PBS buffer. the inserted schema illustrated focusing point moving up and down vertically to the surface of the MCP. MCP with uniform microchannels (20 m inner diameter, 50% open ratio) was used as the solid matrix for immobilizing the coating antibodies (1st Ab) the solution could be easily removed by touching a filter paper to the bottom of the MCP. this disrupted the balance between capillary force and gravity force. the solution could be easily removed by touching a filter paper to the bottom of the MCP. 0.5, 2.5 and 5 g/mL of the 2nd Ab solutions were investigated. a lower concentration of 2nd Ab resulted in lower signal intensity and a poor correlation. the higher concentration of the 2nd Ab generated a higher background signal and relative standard deviation. experimentally, bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein, and superBlock buffer were used to search for the best blocking option. 1% BSA solution was the most efficient, and was adopted in the following experiments. the method showed a better LOD than the traditional 96-well plate method. the proposed MCP-based microwell was superior to those for the traditional 96-well plate. the proposed microwell method showed a good relative analytical sensitivity and a good dilution tolerance in h-IgA measurements. h-IgA in six saliva samples at a 500-fold dilution were tested by the two methods and the results were highly correlated (r2 = 0.91) the reaction of amplex\u00ae Red with H2O2 catalyzed by HRP was used to investigate the effects of the detection point in the microwell. a slight lifting of the focus point resulted in an improved fluorescence recording for both signal intensity and reproducibility due to the increased excited surface area. surface area (mm2) 314 76.93 Volume (L) 1.57 100 Surface-to-volume (ratio) 200 0.7693 Diffusion distance from center (mm) 0.01 3.5 Diffusion time (s) 0.5 6.125 104 The other benefit of the microchannel in MCP was the shortened diffusion distance for the interaction of the antibody and antigen on the surface. the optimal incubation time was determined to be 10 min. as a result, the incubation time was greatly decreased from hours to minutes compared with that for the 96-well plate shown in Table 1. the ELISA performed in a microwell array on the ELISA. the signal intensity was increased with increasing concentration of substrate in the enzyme reaction, while for the present method, the optimum sensitivity was. h-IgA was measured by the present microwell immunoassay under optimal conditions. the microwell array and the 96-well plate method showed a better LOD than the traditional 96-well plate. h-IgA in saliva samples was measured by the 96-well plate method. h-IgA in six saliva samples at a 500-fold dilution were tested. the results were highly correlated (r2 = 0.91). sample h-IgA Addition (ng/mL) Detection (ng/mL) recovery 1 0 190.83 --- 25 214.25 93.7% 50 242.25 102.8% 2 0 218.83 --- 25 242.65 95.28% 50 274.93 112.2%. the proposed method could be greatly improved by using an on-line concentration method."}
