{"summary": "a total of 48 balb/c mice were used for cytokine quantification, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting. the same 24 mice plus 8 additional mice were used for pulmonary inflammation assessment, SAA and C-reactive protein quantification, and correlation with pulmonary inflammation. no airway response or inflammation was observed when mice received 0.4 ppm levels. differences in pulmonary response in mice vs. humans are attributed to pulmonary deposition. the second hemicortex was dissected immediately and frozen on dry ice for protein extraction. the medial lobe of the liver was also harvested and one half was preserved in RNA later. supernatants were centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Pellets were resuspended in cytoplasmic extraction buffer. both fractions were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR Hemicortices and livers that were preserved in RNA later were homogenized in Qiazol. superscript III first strand kit was used to convert 2 g of RNA template to cDNA in a 20-l reaction volume. sections were deparaffinized with histoclear and rehydrated with graded ethanols. endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2 in methanol. antigen unmasking was achieved with target retrieval solution. the kit detects mouse SAA1.1 and SAA2.1 in serum, with a limit of detection of 7.8 ng/ml. samples were diluted 1:3 in sample diluent provided in the kit. 10 micrograms of chloramine-T was added to protein in 0.25 M chloride-free sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for 1 min followed by the addition of 100 g of sodium metabisulfite to terminate the reaction. radioactively labeled SAA1.1 and SAA2.1 (I-SAA1.1/I-SAA2.1) and BSA (Tc-BSA) were purified on a column of Sephadex G-10 (Sigma-Aldrich in vivo stability of I-SAA1.1 or I-SAA2.1 in brain and blood Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 0.15 ml of 40% urethane. blood was allowed to clot, was centrifuged at 3500 g for 10 min. 50 l of the resulting serum was added to 250 l of LR-BSA. values for %Precip from biologic samples were corrected by dividing them by the processing control values and multiplying by 100. mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 0.15 ml of 40% urethane. blood from the carotid artery was collected at 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min after i.v. injection. the slope of the linear portion of the relation between brain/serum ratios and Texp equals Ki, the blood-to-brain unidirectional influx constant in microliters per gram-minute. y-intercepts (Vi) were calculated from plots of brain/serum ratios of I-SAA1.1 and I-SAA2.1 vs. exposure time over the first 15 min of study. 2.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaH2PO4, and 10 mM d-glucose were mixed with 26% dextran. the homogenate was centrifuged at 5400 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the pellet, which contained the capillaries, and the supernatant, which represented the brain parenchymal/interstitial fluid space, were separated. a total of 48 balb/c mice were used: 24 for cytokine quantification, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting. a total of 48 mice were used: 24 for cytokine quantification, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting. mice had access to food and water ad libitum and were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. protocols approved by the institutional animal care and use committees of the University of Pennsylvania and the Seattle Veteran\u2019s Affairs Medical Center. mice were deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine. blood samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min at room temperature. serum was collected, portioned into aliquots, and stored at 80\u00b0C until assay. brains were harvested by first severing only the spinal cord, leaving the trachea intact for bronchoalveolar lavage. total cell counts were determined from 1 aliquot of the cell suspension by using a cell counter. differential cell counts were performed on cytocentrifuge preparations stained with Kwick Diff. images of stained BAL cells were acquired at 40 magnification. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/Tris-buffered saline\u2013Tween 20. blots were either probed with actin or stained with Fast Green Stain. RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR Hemicortices and livers that were preserved in RNA later were homogenized in Qiazol. 10 ng of cDNA template was amplified in a total volume of 10 l using Fast SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) the following cycling conditions: 95\u00b0C for 20 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 3 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. whole-brain sections were imaged by using a 20 objective and stitched by using a Keyence BZ-X700. identically processed brain sections from mice that were infected with a neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus were used as positive controls for gliosis. tant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), M inflammatory proteins-1 (MIP-1a/CCL3), RANTES/CCL5 and TNF- were diluted 1:3 in sample diluent provided in the kit. cytokine values from brain extracts were normalized to total protein levels and expressed as picograms cytokine per milligram of total protein. radioactive labeling of proteins Ten or 5 g of SAA1.1 or SAA2.1 was label Technetium was precipitated with 30% trichloroacetic acid. all proteins were spiked in 1% BSA in lactated Ringer\u2019s solution. precipitated proteins were then centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min. pellets and supernatants were counted to estimate precipitable activity. resulting serum was added to 250 l of LR-BSA. this mixture was mixed, 300 l of acidified brine was added and mixed. resulting supernatant and precipitate were counted separately. blood from the carotid artery was collected at 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min after i.v. injection. mice were immediately decapitated and the whole brain was removed and weighed. each CPM reading for brain and blood was corrected to include only the proportion of precipitable activity. y-intercepts were calculated from plots of brain/serum ratios of I-SAA1.1 and I-SAA2.1 vs. exposure time over the first 15 min of study. subtraction of Vi from the ratio excludes the contribution of I-SAA1.1 or I-SAA2.1 that is present in the vascular space or that rapidly binds to the brain vasculature before crossing the BBB. blood was collected from the carotid artery of 4 mice after 15 min of circulation time and allowed to clot for 20 min at room temperature. blood was then centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 min, and 50 l was added to 100-kDa MW cutoff filters that contained room temperature 0.1% BSA in Zlokovic\u2019s buffer. no eosinophils or lymphocytes were detected at the time points studied. representative images of lavage preparations from mice at 24 h postexposure show that neutrophil trafficking occurs in O3-exposed mice. we screened for 2 acute-phase proteins that are common to mice and humans. IL-4, IL-9, and eotaxin/CCL11 levels were below the reliable range of detection. of 23 cytokines that were detected in-range, significant O3-induced changes were only observed for KC/CXCL1, a neutrophil chemokine in rodents that is functionally similar to human IL-8 (61), and IL-12(p40) there were no significant correlations between A-SAA blood levels and cell counts in BAL at 6 h post-O3 exposure. there were no significant correlations between A-SAA blood levels and cell counts in BAL at 6 h post-O3 exposure. mice, and A-SAA protein levels were significantly higher 24 h after exposure vs. 6 h. IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- are known to induce A-SAA expression. however, IL-6 and TNF- were undetectable and IL-1 was not significantly increased after O3 exposure. 23 cytokines measured, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12(p40), IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, IFN-, KC, MCP-1, MIP-1, and TNF- were detected within the reliable range. of these cytokines, significant O3-induced decreases were observed for IL-1 at 6 and 24 h post-O3 exposure. the ability of SAA to cross the intact BBB of unexposed mice has not been assessed. we determined whether the individual mouse isoforms of A-SAA, SAA1.1 and 2.1 could cross the intact BBB of unexposed mice. the presence of albumin in solution did not alter the retention time of either I-SAA species. the albumin Ki for both SAA1.1 and SAA2.1 did not significantly deviate from 0, and y-intercepts, which reflect the vascular space, were within a physiologic range (8\u201312 l/g) there was a significant difference in the Ki of I-SAA1.1 vs. I-SAA2.1 (P 0.001). data from these plots were used to calculate exposure time. brain uptake curves are plotted for SAA1.1 (open circles; A) and SAA2.1 (filled circles; B) recombinant I-SAA1.1 and -SAA2.1 i.v. injected circulates freely. recombinant I-SAA1.1 and -SAA2.1 i.v. injected binds the vast majority of endogenous circulating SAA and SAA2.1. in the blood-free control group, 72.15% of I-SAA2.1 was detected in the flow-through. 12.93% stuck to the filter and 14.92% was recovered as high-MW I-SAA2.1. 77.01 0.4604% of blood-recovered I-SAA2.1 partitioned as recovered high-MW species. serum components account for approximately 0.02% or 0.2 nl/g of total protein. we compared SAA levels by Western blot in 2 nl serum vs. 10 g brain homogenate from 2 O3-exposed mice in the 24-h group. we loaded 5 and 1 nl of serum to visualize a range of SAA protein levels greater or less than the predicted serum contribution to brain SAA. pulmonary inflammation was assessed by quantifying total cells, Ms, and neutrophils in BAL. no eosinophils or lymphocytes were detected at the time points studied. arrow in panel B indicates a neutrophil. we screened for 2 acute-phase proteins that are common to mice and humans. of 23 cytokines that were measured in the blood, IL-4, IL-9, and eotaxin/CCL11 levels were below the reliable range of detection. of cytokines that were detected in-range, significant O3-induced changes were only observed for KC/CXCL1. there were no significant correlations between A-SAA blood levels and cell counts in BAL at 6 h post-O3 exposure. there were no significant correlations between A-SAA blood levels and cell counts in BAL at 6 h post-O3 exposure. signal in FA-exposed mice was significantly higher 24 h after exposure vs. 6 h. IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- are known to induce A-SAA expression. but IL-6 and TNF- were undetectable and IL-1 was not significantly increased after O3 exposure. the same 23-cytokine panel used to analyze blood was also used to analyze cytokine and chemokine expression in soluble extracts from the cerebral cortex. of these cytokines, significant O3-induced decreases were observed for IL-1 at 6 and 24 h post-O3 exposure vs. FA, and for IL-13 at 24 h post-O3 exposure. iodinated SAA1.1 and SAA2.1 (I-SAA1.1 and I-SAA2.1) in solution were first analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. the presence of albumin in solution did not alter the retention time of either I-SAA species, which indicated no albumin binding occurred. the albumin Ki for both SAA1.1 and SAA2.1 did not significantly deviate from 0, and y-intercepts, which reflect the vascular space, were within a physiologic range (8\u201312 l/g) there was a significant difference in the Ki of I-SAA1.1 vs. I-SAA2.1. 1.6 54.4 106.6 15 66.0 97.1 60.0 94.3 30 57.6 89.1 56.9 75.1 Figure 7. Serum clearance of SAA1.1 and SAA2.1. data from these plots were used to calculate exposure time. recombinant I-SAA1.1 or -SAA2.1 i.v. injected circulates freely. the MW of HDL ranges from 170 to 360 kDa. the MW of HDL ranges from 170 to 360 kDa, whereas those for SAA2.1 are approximately 12 kDa. in the blood-free control group, 72.15% of I-SAA2.1 was detected in the flow-through. 12.93% stuck to the filter and 14.92% was recovered as high-MW I-SAA2.1. 77.01 0.4604% of blood-recovered I-SAA2.1 partitioned as recovered high-MW species. serum components account for approximately 0.02% or 0.2 nl/g of total protein. we compared SAA levels by Western blot in 2 nl serum vs. 10 g brain homogenate from 2 O3-exposed mice in the 24-h group. mRNA expression of acute phase SAA2.1 isoform was determined by quantitative PCR (n = 6/group) increased levels of IL-1, IL-8, and CRP in the blood have been observed in a human study of controlled acute O3 exposure (19), which suggests a potential role for systemic inflammation in the extrapulmonary effects of O3. however, other controlled human exposure studies failed to observe increases in proinflammatory cytokines. glucocorticoids may limit production of proinflammatory cytokines by O3. KC elevations in blood in our model are consistent with neutrophil chemotaxis observed in the lungs. IL-8, the predominant human neutrophil chemokine and functional homolog of KC, was also elevated in the blood at early time points after controlled human O3 exposure. recombinant human A-SAA was found to induce neutrophil recruitment in mouse lungs by an IL-17A\u2013dependent mechanism (74) recombinant human A-SAA was found to induce neutrophil recruitment in mouse lungs by an IL-17A\u2013dependent mechanism (74), suggesting there might be functional overlap of mouse SAA3 and human A-SAA. characterization of A-SAA functions in the lungs may have clinical relevance. we observed a modest transport rate for both SAA1.1 and SAA2.1 into the CNS in unexposed mice. this difference was unexpected, as murine SAA1.1 shares 93% identity with SAA2.1. we found that I-SAA1.1 has distinct properties compared with I-SAA2.1. we found that both I-SAA1.1 and I-SAA2.1 are exclusively monomeric in the presence and absence of albumin. however, the apparent retention of I-SAA1.1 was most likely a result of interactions with the filter. a more striking redistribution of I-SAA2.1 from low- to high-MW species was evident after recovery from blood. the different binding and partitioning properties of I-SAA1.1 vs. I-SAA2.1 indicate that there are biophysical differences between these proteins that could cause differences in their transport rates across the BBB. differences in transporter affinities could explain differences in kinetics of SAA1 vs. SAA2 transport. a recent study by Mumaw et al. (8) reported an observation of microgliosis in O3-exposed mice. mice that lack SAA3 express lower CNS levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, after LPS treatment (41), which indicates that endogenous mouse SAA3 has immunomodulatory functions. additional studies are necessary to determine whether endogenous SAA1 or SAA2 also have immunomodulatory functions in the CNS.
