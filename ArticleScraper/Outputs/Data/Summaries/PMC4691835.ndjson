{"summary": "polyadenylate [poly(A) tails contribute to regulation of mRNA transcription, transport, stability, and translation. poly(A) tail-dependent functions are mediated in large part via the association of one or more poly(A) binding proteins (PABPs) in mammals, there are six defined PABP isoforms; a single nuclear isoform, PABPN1 that impacts on the addition of poly(A) tails in the nucleus. redundancy of the mammalian cytoplasmic PABPs remains unexplored. the interaction of PABPC1 with poly(A) tails is well documented. corresponding functions of the PABPC1/poly(A) tail complex are mediated in pathways of mRNA stabilization and translation enhancement. the impact of Pab1 binding to the polyadenylation efficiency element in yeast remains undefined. the presence of such interactions could have broad implications to the understanding of post-transcriptional gene regulation. the immunoprecipitated PABPC1 RNP complexes were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel. complexes migrating in close proximity to the PABPC1 band were excised for analysis. RNA fragments were isolated from the PABPC1 RNP complexes. IP-seq tags per gene are plotted for three independent biological replicates. RPKM per gene is plotted for CLIP-seq and RNA-seq. mRNAs were binned into 100 evenly sized regions. a high level of reproducibility between replicates allowed us to merge the biological samples for subsequent analyses. the correlation between PABPC1 CLIP-seq and mRNA-seq data that we generated from MEL cells. visual inspection of specific mRNAs revealed numerous CLIP tags clustering along the 3\u2032 UTR with the most prominent peak occurring close to the 3\u2032 termini. together, these data indicate that PABPC1 binds to genomically encoded sequences in numerous mRNAs, that most binding events occur in the 3\u2032 UTR. CIMS analysis of PABPC1 CLIP tags reveals direct binding of PABPC1 to the cleavage and polyadenylation signal. position-specific coverage was calculated by parsing each region into 100 distinct bins and calculating CIMS coverage per bin. poly(A) addition sites are enriched for A/U-rich and A-rich motifs. binding sites are enriched for A/U-rich and A-rich motifs. uridine was the most commonly cross-linked base (position 11) a secondary search revealed a purely A-rich sequence derived from 170 CIMS sites. a preponderance of the PABPC1 CIMS sites mapped 20 to 25-nt upstream of the annotated 3\u2032 terminus of mRNAs. this location coincides with the approximate positioning of the PAS and argues against \u201cbleed-over\u201d from the poly(A) tail binding. mRNAs with the most CLIP tags were highly expressed mRNAs encoding the protein components of the ribosome and proteins that comprise the translation machinery. a number of replication-dependent histone mRNAs were represented among the top 1000 transcripts with highest CLIP tag density. the pattern of binding within the replication-dependent histone mRNAs at start codons was similar to that of polyadenylated mRNAs with short 5\u2032 UTRs. the pattern of binding within the replication-dependent mRNAs at start codons was similar to that of polyadenylated mRNAs with short 5\u2032 UTRs. screenshots from the UCSC genome browser for two representative histone genes showing CLIP tags proximal the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the CDS. green and red boxes indicate annotated start and stop codons, respectively. 5\u2032 UTRs are generally G\u2013C rich (Pesole et al. 1997). MEME analysis of PABPC1 5\u2032 UTR cluster sites revealed an A-rich sequence motif that mapped to 300 unique 5\u2032 UTR clusters. PABPC1 CLIP tags in 5\u2032 UTRs of transcripts containing the A-rich motif (B) and RNA-seq RPKM per gene values. gene ontology analysis of genes with A-rich motifs within CLIP-tag clusters in the 5\u2032 UTR. PABPC1 auto-regulates its expression by binding to an A-rich element in the 5\u2032 UTR of its mRNA. previously found to repress its own translation by binding to a 5\u2032 UTR A-rich determinant. to determine whether these clusters have overlapping or unique roles in regulation of PABPC1 expression we cloned the intact Pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR into a reporter plasmid. luciferase reporter assays suggest that the more 5\u2032 cluster mediates an autoregulatory control over PABPC1 protein expression. luciferase reporter assays suggest that the more 5\u2032 cluster mediates an autoregulatory control over PABPC1 protein expression. luciferase mRNA levels and luciferase enzymatic activity levels are proxy for protein abundance (luciferase assay; dark gray bars) luciferase enzymatic activity levels are a proxy for protein abundance (luciferase assay; dark gray bars) two guide RNAs (gRNAs) corresponding to sites flanking the Pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR binding clusters were cloned into separate vectors expressing the Cas9 nuclease. these two vectors were cotransfected into the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 and Puromycin-resistant clones containing a heterozygous deletion of this region. deletion of the Pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR clusters resulted PC1 inhibits synthesis of a subset of proteins by binding to 5\u2032 UTR A-rich determinants encoded in their mRNAs. three mRNAs with prominent PABPC1 binding clusters at A-rich sites within their 5\u2032 UTR were chosen for study. the full 5\u2032 UTR of each of these mRNAs was cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. PABPC1 binds in the 5\u2032 UTR of transcripts and negatively regulates translation. screenshots from the UCSC genome browser of PABPC1 CLIP tags in the 5\u2032 UTR for Safb (A), Amd1 (D), and Ccnd2 (G) mRNA. vivo UV-crosslinking followed by limited RNase I digestion, 32P-labeling of RNA in the complexes, and immunoprecipitation with an isotype-specific anti-PABPC1 antibody. complexes migrating in close proximity to the PABPC1 band were excised for analysis. RPKM per gene is plotted for CLIP-seq and RNA-seq. mRNAs were binned into 100 evenly sized regions. coverage at each bin was used to create a composite profile. we first examined the correlation of CLIP tags per gene between biological replicates and found a high level of reproducibility between experiments. this consistency between replicates allowed us to merge the biological samples for subsequent analyses. we also determined the correlation between PABPC1 CLIP-seq and mRNA-seq data that we generated from MEL cells. CIMS analysis of PABPC1 CLIP tags identified 11,907 significant (false discovery rate [FDR] 0.001) direct binding sites within the mouse genome. regions of mature mRNAs (5\u2032 UTR, CDS, and 3\u2032 UTR) were binned into 100 discrete units and CIMS coverage across each bin was calculated. CIMS analysis of PABPC1 CLIP tags reveals direct binding of PABPC1 to the cleavage and polyadenylation signal. position-specific coverage was calculated by parsing each region into 100 distinct bins and calculating CIMS coverage per bin. binding sites are enriched for A/U-rich and A-rich motifs. we anchored the analysis at CIMS sites and identified the base composition at each position 10 nt from the CIMS site. uridine was the most commonly cross-linked base (position 11) a secondary search revealed a purely A-rich sequence derived from 170 CIMS sites. a preponderance of the PABPC1 CIMS sites mapped 20 to 25-nt upstream of the annotated 3\u2032 terminus of mRNAs. alignment of the CIMS relative to the canonical PAS sequence (AAUAAA) revealed a sharp enrichment for CIMS sites at this element. mRNAs with the most CLIP tags were highly expressed mRNAs encoding the protein components of the ribosome and proteins that comprise the translation machinery. a number of replication-dependent histone mRNAs were represented among the top 1000 transcripts with highest CLIP tag density. the pattern of binding within the replication-dependent histone mRNAs at start codons was similar to that of polyadenylated mRNAs with short 5\u2032 UTRs. a similar enrichment over the start codon in genes with longer 5\u2032 UTRs, although to a lesser extent. a small subset of PABPC1 CLIP tags localized within 5\u2032 UTRs. a relatively low correlation between number of CLIP-seq tags in 5\u2032 UTRs and mRNA abundance (mRNA-seq) was insufficient to identify a 5\u2032-UTR-specific motif. MEME analysis of PABPC1 5\u2032 UTR cluster sites revealed an A-rich sequence motif that mapped to 300 unique 5\u2032 UTR clusters. we examined the correlation of CLIP tags from A-rich motif containing 5\u2032 UTRs with the mRNA-seq data set. this lower correlation coefficient suggests that PABPC1 interactions with A-rich motifs in the 5\u2032 UTR are further uncoupled from mRNA steady-state expression levels. PABPC1 CLIP tags in 5\u2032 UTRs of transcripts containing the A-rich motif (B) and RNA-seq RPKM per gene values. gene ontology analysis of genes with A-rich motifs within CLIP-tag clusters in the 5\u2032 UTR. PABPC1 auto-regulates its expression by binding to an A-rich element in the 5\u2032 UTR of its mRNA. previously found to repress its own translation by binding to a 5\u2032 UTR A-rich determinant. to determine whether these clusters have overlapping or unique roles in regulation of PABPC1 expression we cloned the intact Pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR into a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR (Mut1 versus C1-5\u2032UTR; P 0.001, two-tailed t-test) deletion of the more 3\u2032 located cluster had a statistically significant but marginal impact on protein output. luciferase reporter assays suggest that the more 5\u2032 cluster mediates an autoregulatory control over PABPC1 protein expression. luciferase enzymatic activity levels as a proxy for protein abundance. luciferase enzymatic activity levels as a proxy for protein abundance. luciferase assay shows pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR region for WT cells. two guide RNAs (gRNAs) corresponding to sites flanking the Pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR binding clusters were cloned into separate vectors expressing the Cas9 nuclease. these two vectors were cotransfected into the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 and Puromycin-resistant clones containing a heterozygous deletion of this region. deletion of the Pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR clusters resulted binding to 5\u2032 UTR A-rich elements mediated regulatory control over additional mRNAs. three mRNAs with prominent PABPC1 binding clusters at A-rich sites within their 5\u2032 UTR were chosen for study. the full 5\u2032 UTR of each mRNA was cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. PABPC1 binds in the 5\u2032 UTR of transcripts and negatively regulates translation. screenshots from the UCSC genome browser of PABPC1 CLIP tags in the 5\u2032 UTR for Safb (A), Amd1 (D), and Ccnd2 (G) mRNA. deletion of its single poly(A) binding protein, Pab1p, is incompatible with cell viability. homozygosity for P-element disruption of the cytoplasmic PABP gene results in embryonic lethality. in vitro studies suggest that PABPC1 can bind to mRNAs at sites other than the poly(A) tail. PABP's are well characterized for their strong association to mRNA poly(A) tails. it was necessary to demonstrate that the enrichment within 3\u2032 UTRs reflected direct binding rather than \u201cbleed over\u201d from binding to adjoining poly(A) tails. CPEB can also recruit proteins such as Maskin to regulate mRNA translation in Xenopus oocytes and mouse hippocampus. it is plausible that PABPC1 may also bind to the PAS without any functional significance. PABPC1 binds to a-rich sites within the 5\u2032 UTR of a restricted subset of mRNAs. this specificity is indicated by the lack of correspondence between mRNAs bound in this region by PABPC1 and overall mRNA representation in the transcriptome. the highest ranked PABPC1 binding target within this mRNA subset was Pabpc1 mRNA. this binding element within the 5\u2032 UTR may yet play a role in translation regulation not captured by the luciferase assay. we deleted the region of the Pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR spanning both of the PABPC1 CLIP-tag clusters via Crispr/Cas9 endonuclease targeting. this region acts to auto-regulate Pabpc1 translation. deletion of the 5\u2032 cluster (Mut 1) in the Pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR (Fig. 5C) also enhanced mRNA levels. these data highlight potential for the 5\u2032 UTR binding of PABPC1 to impact on a variety of mechanisms that repress gene expression. this includes both mRNA stability and translation regulation. a CIMS analysis unambiguously identified that PABPC1 binds directly within the mRNA 3\u2032 UTRs. the majority of these binding interactions are localized to the canonical cleavage and polyadenylation signal sequence (AAUAAA) this results suggest that this previous report did not reflect a technological bias introduced by PAR-CLIP preferentially crosslinking to U residues. PABPC1, once bound to the PAS, can recruit additional trans-acting factors that modulate mRNA stability and/or translation by impacting on the length and/or function of the poly(A) tail. Alternatively, PABPC1 may also bind to the PAS without any functional significance. the binding of PABPC1 within 5\u2032 UTRs appears to be limited to a highly restricted subset of mRNAs. this specificity is indicated by the lack of correspondence between mRNAs bound in this region by PABPC1 and overall mRNA representation in the transcriptome. the region of the Pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR may yet play a role in translation regulation not captured by the luciferase assay. we deleted the region spanning both of the PABPC1 CLIP-tag clusters via Crispr/Cas9 endonuclease targeting. this region acts to auto-regulate Pabpc1 translation. pabpc1 5\u2032 UTR also enhanced mRNA levels, although to a lesser extent than the corresponding protein expression. the intimate linkage of mRNA translation with mRNA stability makes a clear delineation of the primary mechanisms difficult using the luciferase assay. the relative importance of each of these pathways may reflect specifics of the binding site. immunoprecipitation was performed with protein A Dynabeads coated with PABPC1 antibody (Abcam) the beads were then washed, treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and the RNP complexes were eluted off of the beads. ninety percent of the eluate were used for autoradiography and the remainder was used for immunoblotting. CIMS analysis was applied to identify single-nucleotide RBP-RNA interactions sites. a negative binomial test was used to assess significance. mRNA-seq mRNA-seq was performed as previously described. a position weight matrix was created from the top 20 hexanucleotides. the prevalence of each hexanucleotide was calculated and compared with the abundance in 15-nt CIMS regions. purmomycin was added at 1 g/mL to colonies with targeted 5\u2032 UTR deletions were selected for genomic DNA PCR. ribosome profiling data from harringtonine-treated mouse embryonic stem cells were obtained from GSE30839. cell culture and CLIP-seq analysis MEL and NIH-3T3 cells were grown under standard conditions in minimal essential medium (MEM) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) were supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 antibiotic\u2013antimycotic (Invitrogen) cells were washed with HBSS and cross-linked with UV three times on ice. purified RNA was ligated to a 5\u2032 adaptor, amplified, and sequencing libraries were constructed. libraries generated from biological triplicates were individually bar coded, pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. reads from each replicate CLIP-seq experiment were collapsed and mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) with Novoalign (Novocraft, Selagnor, MYS) with the parameters \u2013t 85 \u2013l poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using oligo(dT) beads (Life Technologies). mRNA-seq libraries were then generated using the Illumina smRNA-seq kit (Illumina). reads were trimmed with Cutadapt, mapped with Tophat2, and gene expression was quantified using HTseq. custom scripts were used to create a position\u2013weight matrix. per million were considered bona fide poly(A) sites. luciferase assays 5\u2032 UTR or defined variants were cloned into a firefly luciferase vector. these constructs were transfected into NIH-3T3 cells in 12-well plate. reads were trimmed for adapter sequence (CTGTAGGCACCATCAATTCGTATGCTTCTGCTTGAA), filtered by mapping to mouse ribosomal RNA sequences. only mapped reads with no mismatches were used for further analysis."}
