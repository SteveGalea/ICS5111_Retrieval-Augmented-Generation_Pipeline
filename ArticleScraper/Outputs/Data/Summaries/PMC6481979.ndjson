{"summary": "the Gyeongju earthquake occurred on September 12, 2016 at a location 8 km south-southwest of Gyeongju City, Gyeongsangbuk-do, south Korea. the earthquake occurred at a location 8 km south-southwest of Gyeongju City, Gyeongsangbuk-do, south Korea (35\u00b0 46\u2032 12\u2032 N, 129\u00b0 11\u2032 24\u2032 E) the magnitude was 5.1 on the Richter scale at 7:44:32 this region suffered from the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan [7], 1999 Turkey Marmara earthquake [8], 2005 Pakistan Kashmir earthquake [6,9], and 2011 East Japan earthquake [10\u201313] these natural disasters are catastrophic to patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who need dialysis. this is especially important in countries with an aging population. about half of dialysis facilities in the affected area were closed for more than 10 days. patients on hemodialysis missed at least one dialysis session, and some missed three or more sessions. since then, the centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, healthcare provider community, and state have begun a voluntary rapid response system. at a magnitude of 5.4, it was the second strongest since 1978. the depth of the epicenter was 1 to 6 km, and it occurred at a shallower depth compared to the depth of the Gyeongju earthquake (11\u201316 km) 81.5% of the global casualties in 2012 occurred in the Asia-Pacific region, mainly due to the increasing number of earthquakes. hemodialysis (HD) patients have been educated on how to prepare for disasters. 320,448 dialysis patients in Japan in 2014, and 97.2% were receiving hemodialysis. the number of ESRD patients is increasing by about 10,000 every year. there were 4,330 dialysis facilities as of December 2014 in Japan [26] and 896 as of December 2016 in Korea [27] in 1995. 66 of 104 dialysis facilities were affected, forcing about 3,000 patients to be transported to other facilities to maintain dialysis. the NDMS is comprised of four components: disaster base hospital (DBH), emergency medical information system (EMIS), disaster medical assistance team (DMAT) and national aeromedical evacuation (AE) the NDMS was first put into practice for the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. a hemodialysis clinic in Pohang was located 4 km from the epicenter. the quake induced a power outage but fortunately did not damage the building. the clinic had a backup generator that supplies power to only the blood dialyzer. nephrologists and healthcare providers need a strong emergency contact network. they need to identify and report resources to maintain dialysis treatment. chief nephrologist should promote discussion of treatment details with nephrologists. available internet websites for hemodialysis units and dialysis patients as of May 2018 Proper situation Organization

http://www.kidney.org a large-scale blackout can have diverse effects on hemodialysis patients. a thunderstorm in the Midwest of the united states in 2012 caused a power outage in 30% of the area\u2019s dialysis facilities. dialysis staff need to know the capacity of their hemodialysis center and be aware of how much power reserve they have. different dialysis machines may activate different functions in case of power failure. display monitors, blood pump, arterial and venous pressure alarms, and air bubble detector functions often work during a power outage. hemodialysis water treatment can experience two major problems in disaster situations. the average time to recover the water treatment system was 12.8 days. the average time to recover the water treatment system was 12.8 days. the \u201cClamp and Cap\u201d uses tools (clamps and scissors) necessary for the emergency dialysis line separation procedure. vascular needles of dialysis access can be left in place without removal until patients reach a safe location. dialysis staff should be familiar with emergency power supply contacts. display monitors, blood pump, arterial and venous pressure alarms and air bubble detector functions often work during a power outage. hemodiafiltration and transmembrane pressure alarms often work during a power outage. hemodialysis water treatment can experience two major problems in disaster situations. the average time to recover the water treatment system was 12.8 days. the average time to recover the water treatment system was 12.8 days. patients should keep contact with their dialysis clinic and know the location and phone number of other dialysis hospitals near their dialysis clinic. dialysis patients should prepare spare potassium exchange resins as a useful way to recover after a disaster during early dialysis. the CDC presents a 3-day emergency diet plan [20,22]. a Korean emergency diet plan should be developed based on evidence. maintenance dialysis patients need to know about disaster preparedness. hemodialysis units or dialysis treatment are not available on time or immediately after a disaster. emergency dietary plans for dialysis patients are shown in \"Preparing for Emergencies: A guide for people on dialysis\" the CDC presents a 3-day emergency diet plan [20,22] regional coordination HD unit should be selected in advance. nephrology society, dialysis system manufacturers, dialysis patients must recognize the hospital management department, which places the highest priority on patient safety. long-term plans to improve preparedness for disaster situations in hemodialysis units need to begin as soon as possible. power consumption of individual machines from manufacturer manuals Status machine Nipro NCU-18 Formula Tx
