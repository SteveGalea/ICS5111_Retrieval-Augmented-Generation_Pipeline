{"summary": "the presence or absence of functional receptors on the cell surface is a major determinant of virus tropism. the presence or absence of functional receptors on the cell surface is a major determinant of virus tropism. the presence or absence of functional receptors on the cell surface is a major determinant of virus tropism. d example of glycosylation-blocked receptors involves those for the cat endogenous retrovirus RD114. the cat endogenous retrovirus is unable to enter NIH 3T3 mouse cells unless these cells have been treated with agents, including tunicamycin, that prevent the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. RD114 also uses a closely related human protein, ASCT2 (standard name SLC1 phosphatidylserine treatment can relieve the block to infection mediated by glycosylation-blocked receptors. this effect is not observed with other phospholipids, and is thought to occur through an enhancement of virus fusion [15]. PS treatment allows infection of cells expressing glycosylation-blocked retrovirus receptorsa Target cells Vector PS treatment Vector titer (AP+ FFU/ml) where indicated, cells were treated with 400 M PS for 24 h. NIH 3T3 cells that express HA-tagged human ASCT2 were treated with 400 M PS for 24 h. 293T cells were transfected with a myc-tagged murine ASCT1 expression plasmid. 400 M PS was added 24 h post-transfection. no detectable unglycosylated receptor present in the cells. the non-specific enhancement of infection by PS occurs rapidly. we undertook infections using RD114 vector on normally infectable NIH 3T3/ASCT2 cells given only a short exposure to PS. with only 1 h of PS treatment, virus infection was increased almost 4-fold. this experiment was repeated twice with the same results. there was a direct relationship between the amount of PS present in the membrane and infection of normally-infectable NIH 3T3/ASCT2 cells. there was a long delay in the increase in RD114 vector infection of NIH 3T3 cells following PS addition, with the major enhancement of virus infection occurring after 12 h. the reduced incorporation of PS had the result of increasing the delay of RD114 vector infection of NIH 3T3 cells from 12 to more than 16 h. cells were analyzed for cell-surface PS levels by using annexin-V or were infected with the RD114 vector. PS liposomes were generated and added to cells at concentrations of 0, 6.4, 32, 80, 240, 320, and 400 M. the entire experiment was repeated twice with very similar results. we will refer to this effect as \"non-specific enhancement\" of virus infection by PS. NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 400 M PS for 24 h. cells were treated with 400 M PS for 24 h. the effect was described in previous work as \"glycosylation-specific enhancement\" n-linked oligosaccharide modification of ASCT1 and ASCT2 was treated with 400 M PS for 24 h. 293T cells were transfected with a myc-tagged murine ASCT1 expression plasmid. 400 M PS was added 24 h post-transfection. the non-specific enhancement of infection by PS occurs rapidly. we undertook infections using RD114 vector on normally infectable NIH 3T3/ASCT2 cells given only a short exposure to PS. with only 1 h of PS treatment, virus infection was increased almost 4-fold. this experiment was repeated twice with the same results. we found a linear relationship between the time after PS addition and the amount of PS present in the outer leaflet of the membrane. there was a direct relationship between the amount of PS present in the membrane and infection of normally-infectable NIH 3T3/ASCT2 cells by the RD114 vector. the total amount of PS incorporated into the plasma membrane was reduced at each timepoint. the reduced incorporation of PS had the result of increasing the delay of RD114 vector infection of NIH 3T3 cells from 12 to more than 16 h. RD114 infection of NIH 3T3 cells was not detected until a higher concentration of PS was reached. RD114 vector infection of NIH 3T3 or NIH 3T3/ASCT2 cells was not detected until a higher concentration of PS was reached. vo protein synthesis is required for the glycosylation-specific effect of PS treatment. however, preliminary experiments have demonstrated that PS treatment combined with inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide is lethal to cells. however, we have not ruled out the possibility that PS might induce subtle changes in receptor glycosylation that might affect virus entry. exogenous PS has been shown to affect the curvature and stability of a lipid bilayer. it is possible that the glycosylation of the receptors prevents the membranes from coming in close enough contact to fuse. however, the destabilization of the plasma membrane by PS increases the distance at which this fusion can occur. a large batch of PS liposomes was produced on day 1. a large batch of PS liposomes was added to cells every 4 h from 0\u201324 h. at 24 h, cells were either infected as described above or prepared for annexin-V labeling. the mean fluorescence of 10,000 cells was obtained for the unlabeled and labeled cell populations. the mean of the unlabeled cells was subtracted from the mean of the labeled cells to determine the relative amount of cell-surface PS for each sample. treated and untreated samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 5% powdered milk, incubated with appropriate concentrations of anti-HA primary and secondary antibodies. analysis of ASCT1 was performed following transfection of 293T cells with a myc-tagged expression vector for murine ASCT1 [14] using the calcium phosphate method. virus (MoMLV)-based vector encodes human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) and neomycin phosphotransferase. all retroviral vectors used in these studies were harvested in medium exposed to producer cells. cells were plated at 5 104 cells/well in 6-well dishes. generation of liposomes L-phosphatidyl-L-serine was obtained as a 10 mg/ml solution in chloroform:methanol (95:5) phospholipid was dried in a glass tube under nitrogen, and resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 5 mM. liposomes were filtered through a 0.2 m pore-size syringe filter and were used immediately unless otherwise described. analysis of ASCT1 was performed following transfection of 293T cells with a myc-tagged expression vector for murine ASCT1 [14] using the calcium phosphate method [29] cell lysates were collected at 48 h post-transfection and were treated as described above. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
