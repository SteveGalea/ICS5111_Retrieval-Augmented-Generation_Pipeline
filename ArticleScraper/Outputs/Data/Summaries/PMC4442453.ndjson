{"summary": "MERS-CoV represents a novel betacoronavirus species closely related to clade 2c bat CoVs. the potential animal origin of MERS-CoV is consistent with in vitro studies showing that cells from different animal species, including bats, camels, goats, and nonhuman primates allow MERS-CoV infection. 16 female 6-month-old rabbits were inoculated with MERS-CoV (n = 12) or sham inoculated (n = 4) the rabbits were euthanized at 3, 4, or 21 days postinfection (dpi) the rabbits were inoculated both intranasally with 1 106 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) and intratracheally with 4 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV. in situ hybridization of rabbit lung tissue and kidney tissue slices cultured for 24 h in vitro. small fluctuations in mean body temperatures measured by intraperitoneal temperature loggers in four MERS-CoV-inoculated rabbits. temperatures are shown until 21 dpi. microscopically, however, focal mild to moderate rhinitis with heterophils in the epithelium and lamina propria and epithelial hyperplasia and hypertrophy related to regeneration were observed in the noses of MERS-CoV-inoculated rabbits at 3 and 4 dpi. immunehistochemistry and histopathology of the respiratory tract of rabbits inoculated with MERS-CoV at 4 dpi. MERS-CoV antigen was present in epithelial cells of the olfactory and respiratory part of the nose and in type I and II pneumocytes in alveoli, often centered around the terminal bronchioles. respiratory epithelium and olfactory epithelium colocalized with lesions at 4 dpi. antigen expression colocalized with peribronchiolar lesions. no antigen expression was seen in tracheal epithelial cells, bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue or nonrespiratory tissues. rabbits inoculated with MERS-CoV have a severe lower respiratory tract infection that may become fatal, while there is little involvement of the upper respiratory tract (3). mice, ferrets, and hamsters have been shown to resist MERS-CoV infection. rabbits may be used as a model to study pathogenesis of MERS. rabbits may be used to test intervention strategies aimed at inhibition of MERS-CoV replication in vivo."}
