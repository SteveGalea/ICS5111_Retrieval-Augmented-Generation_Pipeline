{"summary": "novel viruses with the ability to cause respiratory infections are of particular public health interest because of their pandemic potential and their ability of rapid spread via aerosol or droplet. fewer than 200 of these are viruses, but more than two new species of viruses infecting humans are reported worldwide every year. the mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRV) are non-fusogenic. the remaining members of the genus are fusogenic, including avian orthoreoviruses (ARV), baboon orthoreoviruses (BRV), reptilian orhtoreoviruses (RRV) and orthoreoviruses isolated from bats. this is the 4th isolate from human patients within a four-year period in the absence of a targeted surveillance program. it can be predicted more human cases will be detected if systematic surveillance is put in place for nations where fruit bats are present in significant numbers. throat swab samples in virus transport medium were gently vortexed after the addition of crystalline penicillin (500 I.U.), streptomycin (200 g) and amphoteracin (50 g) after incubation, the solution was inoculated onto monolayer of MDCK (ATCC, CCL-34), Vero (ATCC, CCL-81) and Hep-2 (ATCC, CCL-23) cells freshly cultured in JM cell culture tubes. a fully confluent monolayer of MDCK cells in a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask was washed twice with 5 ml of sterile PBS and treated with 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin containing 0.1% EDTA. a 5-ml aliquot of the cell suspension was transferred into each of 4 new 25-cm2 flasks and incubated at 37\u00b0C in an ambient of 5% CO2. at 24 l and subsequently 10 l of the final cell suspension was transferred into each well of the Teflon coated slides. the slides were allowed to air dry in a BSL-2 cabinet, irradiated by UV-light and fixed in cold acetone for later use. no identification of the subjects is to be revealed in any publication. a nation-wide influenza surveillance program in Malaysia was initiated in 2004 under the national influenza pandemic preparedness plan. l of sterile PBS and 10 l of the suspension cells were carefully layered onto each well of a 12-well Teflon coated slide. the slide was allowed to dry over a warm plate (42\u00b0C) placed in a BSC-II cabinet. initial identification of virus was made by indirect immunofluorescence test using a panel of commercial monoclonal antibodies. the volume of the mixed cell suspension was adjusted with sterile PBS to a cell concentration of approximately 1000 cells per 10 l. 10 l of the final cell suspension was transferred into each well of the Teflon coated slides. the slides were allowed to air dry in a BSL-2 cabinet, irradiated by UV-light and fixed in cold acetone for later use. a 46-year-old policeman developed a sudden onset of high fever with a sore throat and prostrating myalgia on 6 March 2010. the fever was associated with severe anteriorly throbbing headache and mild photophobia, but without blurring of vision. no neck stiffness, abnormal muscle movement, seizure or loss of consciousness. a throat swab was collected in viral transport medium and sent to the laboratory. he felt weak and lethargic with mild myalgia and poor appetite. he was given erythromycin and a higher dose of anti-pyretic. the patient's wife and 2nd son had IgM and IgG antibodies to PRV7S. none of them had ever experienced any febrile illness within a month of the onset of the patient's clinical symptoms. table 2 shows the status of their anti-PRV7S antibodies. va from patients infected with each of the three different PRVs all had high level of cross reactivity. this was further confirmed by micro-neutralization assay. titer was determined by immunofluorescence antibody test using fixed MDCK cells. # Sampling time, expressed as days after onset of symptoms, is indicated for each serum. Molecular and phylogenetic characterization Profiling of the genome segments for PRV7S on SDS-polyacrylamide gel indicated that its electropherotype is similar to those of other Malaysian PRVs, and is most closely related to that of PRV3M. PRV7S segment/protein (size in aa residues) of PRV7S proteins to those of PRV6XR, PRV5HK, PRV4K, PRV3M, PRV2P and PRV1NB. phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequence of the four S-class genome segments of orthoreoviruses. the percentage of replicate trees in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branching node. the patient developed a sudden onset of high fever with a sore throat and prostrating myalgia on 6 March 2010. the fever was associated with severe anteriorly throbbing headache and mild photophobia, but without blurring of vision. a throat swab was collected in viral transport medium and sent to the laboratory for virology investigation. he was given erythromycin and a higher dose of anti-pyretic. he still felt weak and lethargic with mild myalgia and poor appetite. the patient's wife, one son (2nd child) and two daughters (5th and 6th child) had IgM and IgG antibodies to PRV7S. none of them had ever experienced any febrile illness within a month of the onset of the patient's clinical symptoms. va from patients infected with three different PRV strains all had high level of cross reactivity. this was further confirmed by micro-neutralization assay. va from patients infected with each of the three different PRV strains also reacted with PRV2P. orescence antibody test using fixed MDCK cells infected with each of the four viruses; neutralizing titer was determined using the micro-neutralization test with 100 TCID50 for each of the four viruses. the genome segments were separated in a 10% SDS-polyarylamide gel. asterisk (*) indicates co-migrating bands and the open arrow (>) indicates cognate segments of the two viruses with a different mobility. phylogenetic trees based on all four S-class genome segments further confirmed that PRT7S is a member of the PRV species group. the percentage of replicate trees in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branching node. to date, there are four confirmed outbreaks of human respiratory illness caused by this group of viruses, three in Malaysia and one in Bali/Hong Kong. PRV1NB and PRV2P were isolated from bats in the same genus, Pteropus poliocephalus in australia. PRV2P was clustered closer to PRV6XR than to PRV2P. the viral genetic diversity is also reflected by the four viruses isolated from human patients. different bats in geographically separated locations have the potential to infect human and cause respiratory disease outbreaks. resulting clinical presentations vary with different individuals, from symptomless to severe respiratory illness to severe respiratory illness."}
