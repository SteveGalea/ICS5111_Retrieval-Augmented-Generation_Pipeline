{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic disease caused by the virus. it has been suspected that the virus is of bat origin. dromedaries serve as a reservoir and transmit the virus to humans primarily in Middle Eastern countries (2\u20135) mRNAs encode viral structural proteins and accessory proteins, including 3, 4a, 4b, and 5, but the latter are not essential for virus replication. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (bars) and viral open reading frames (boxes) are not drawn according to their length. the percentage of SG-positive cells was calculated by counting the number of SG-positive cells out of 25 to 34 N protein-positive cells per field. a total of 20 fields were counted for each sample. hpi, hours postinfection. assembly and subsequent accumulation of mRNAs associated with stalled ribosome complexes in cytoplasmic structures called stress granules (SGs) once translation activities are restored, SGs are disassembled and mRNAs that have been stored in the SGs can rapidly resume translation (27, 29, 30). SGs contain mRNAs bound to translation factors, such as eIF4A and eIF3, and the 40S ribosomal subunit, plus assemble SG by cleaving G3BP1 via the activity of the viral 3C proteinase (45) some viruses induce or modulate SG formation for their replication. for example, Newcastle disease virus triggers the stable formation of SGs, which benefit viral protein translation and virus replication by arresting cellular mRNAs. Rabouw et al. tested SG formation in MERS-CoV-infected vero cells. but they used HeLa cells to study 4a protein-induced SG formation. extent of the PKR-induced eIF2 phosphorylation caused by the MERS-CoV mutant in vero cells might have been too low for induction of SG formation. we inoculated MERS-CoV-WT or MERS-CoV-p4 into HeLa/CD26 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies specific for SG marker TIA-1, G3BP, or eIF4A, together with the MERS-CoV N protein. 5% of SG-positive cells were SG positive at 6 h p.i. and the number of SG-positive cells increased as infection progressed. 80% and 100% of cells were SG positive at 9 h p.i. and 12 h p.i. titers of MERS-CoV-WT were significantly higher than those of MERS-CoV-p4 at 18 and 24 h p.i. at an MOI of 0.01. in vero cells, both viruses replicated similarly at an MOI of 0.01, while the titers of MERS-CoV-WT were higher than those of MERS-CoV-p4 at 24, 36, and 48 h p.i. at an MOI of 3 the phosphorylation levels of PKR and eIF2 were clearly higher in HeLa/CD26 cells infected with MERS-CoV-p4 than in those infected with MERS-CoV-WT. the effects of 4a on PKR activation and eIF2 phosphorylation in infected cells are unknown. i. for HeLa/CD26 cells (A) and 24 h p.i. for Vero cells (B) were subjected to Western blot analysis to detect PKR, phosphorylated PKR (p-PKR), eIF2 (p-eIF2), the MERS-CoV 4a protein, the MERS-CoV 4b protein, and tubulin. cells were radiolabeled for 1 h with 100 Ci of Tran35S mRNAs 1 to 3 of MERS-CoV-p4 migrated faster than those of MERS-CoV-WT in the gel. mRNA 1 and mRNA 8 encoding N protein accumulated to similar levels in MERS-CoV-WT and MERS-CoV-p4-infected cells. the 28S and 18S rRNAs were detected by ethidium bromide staining (rRNA) the expression levels of mRNAs were normalized to the levels of 18S rRNA. PKR antagonistic function of 4a failed to show significant biological effects in vero cells. inhibition of viral translation, which was induced by phosphorylated eIF2, caused inefficient MERS-CoV-p4 replication in HeLa/CD26 cells. IFN-1, OAS, and interferon-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) mRNAs in infected HeLa/CD26 cells. sendai virus (SeV), a positive control, induced efficient expression of these mRNAs, while mock infection did not. no significant differences in expression levels of these mRNAs between MERS-CoV-WT and MERS-CoV-p4-infected cells. eIF4A showed a diffuse distribution in mock-infected cells and MERS-CoV-WT-infected cells. the absence of clear colocalization of viral mRNAs and eIF4A demonstrated that most of the viral mRNAs were not confined in the SGs. at 9 h p.i., viral mRNAs were detected by riboprobe binding to all viral mRNAs (green), and SGs were detected by anti-eIF4A antibody (red) samples were subjected to fluorescence microscopic examination. SG formation interferes with MERS-CoV replication. SG formation interferes with efficient MERS-CoV replication. cells were transfected with control siRNA (siCont) or siRNA targeting TIA-1 (siTIA-1) or G3BP1/2 (siG3BP1/2) at 9 h p.i., cells were fixed and stained for G3BP or TIA-1, together with N protein. each box represents the mean (standard deviation) for three wells. Asterisks represent statistically significant differences (P 0.05) at 24 h after siRNA transfection, cells were mock infected or infected. the effects of inefficient SG accumulation on translation activities were examined next. control siRNA-treated cells and TIA-1-depleted cells were first mock infected or infected with MERS-CoV-p4 or MERS-CoV-WT. translational activities were then examined by metabolic radiolabeling. the increased viral gene expression of MERS-CoV-p4 in cells depleted of TIA-1 or G3BP1/2 is not due to changes in eIF2 phosphorylation levels. these data are consistent with notion that SG formation prevents translation by sequestering various factors that are involved in translation to SGs. 2 occurred in MERS-CoV-4a-infected cells, establishing that the 4a protein alone was sufficient for inhibition of PKR-mediated eIF2 phosphorylation in infected cells. a combined effect of SG formation and efficient eIF2 phosphorylation causes strong translational suppression in MERS-CoV-4a-infected cells. V-4a were statistically significantly lower than those of MERS-CoV-WT at 36 h p.i. at an MOI of 3. these data support the notion that MERS-CoV-4a induced efficient PKR-mediated eIF2 phosphorylation and SG formation. both of which caused inhibition of viral and host translation. HeLa/CD26 cells were either mock infected (Mock) or infected with MERS-CoV-WT or MERS-CoV-4a (4a) at an MOI of 0.01 or 3. whole-cell lysates were prepared at 9 h p.i. and subjected to Western blot analysis to detect PKR, phosphorylated PKR (p-PKR), eIF2 (p-eIF2), the MERS- atants were collected at the indicated times p.i. each dot represents the mean virus titer (standard deviation) for three wells. asterisks represent statically significant differences in virus titers. 5% of SG-positive cells were SG positive at 6 h p.i. and the number of SG-positive cells increased as infection progressed. 80% and 100% of cells were SG positive at 9 h p.i. and 12 h p.i. growth kinetics of MERS-CoV-WT and MERS-CoV-p4 in HeLa/CD26 and vero cells. titers of MERS-CoV-WT were significantly higher than those of MERS-CoV-p4 at 18 and 24 h p.i. at an MOI of 0.01. differences in virus titers between the two viruses in vero cells were not due to SG formation. culture supernatants were collected at the indicated times p.i. each dot represents the mean virus titer (standard deviation) for three wells. phosphorylation levels of PKR and eIF2 were clearly higher in HeLa/CD26 cells. whole-cell lysates were prepared at 9 h p.i. for HeLa/CD26 cells (A) and 24 h p.i. for Vero cells (B) and subject to Western blot analysis to detect PKR, phosphorylated PKR (p-PKR), eIF2, phosphorylated eIF2 (p-eIF2), the MERS-CoV 4a protein, the MERS-CoV 4b protein, and tubul synthesis of virus-specific proteins was lower in MERS-CoV-p4-infected cells than in MERS-CoV-WT-infected cells after 9 h p.i. the levels of host protein synthesis were similar among mock-infected cells and MERS-CoV-WT-infected cells. HeLa/CD26 cells were mock infected (Mock) or infected with MERS-CoV-WT (WT) or MERS-CoV-p4 (p4) at an MOI of 3. at the indicated times p.i., total intracellular RNAs and proteins were prepared. 4a-mediated inhibition of PKR activation likely prevented efficient eIF2 phosphorylation, allowing viral and host translation and preventing SG formation. inhibition of viral translation, which was induced by phosphorylated eIF2, caused inefficient replication in HeLa/CD26 cells. antiviral proteins, e.g., PKR, 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L, are recruited to SGs and exert antiviral functions. SG formation could trigger innate immune responses by examining expression levels of the beta interferon (IFN-), IFN-1, OAS, and interferon-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) mRNAs in MERS-CoV- the expression levels of the genes were normalized to the expression levels of 18S rRNA. each bar represents the mean (standard deviation) for three independent samples. the absence of innate immune gene expression may be due to the possibility that the viral mRNAs are not confined in the SGs. the absence of clear colocalization of viral mRNAs and eIF4A demonstrated that most of the viral mRNAs were not confined in the SGs. the absence of clear colocalization of viral mRNAs and an SG marker, eIF4A, demonstrated that most of the viral mRNAs were not confined in the SGs. MERS-CoV-WT replicated less efficiently in cells depleted of TIA-1 or those depleted of G3BP1/2 than in control siRNA-treated cells. in contrast, MERS-CoV-p4 replicated more efficiently in TIA-1-depleted cells than in control siRNA-treated cells. inhibition of SG formation has effects on promoting virus replication more pronounced than the positive effects of TIA-1 or G3BP1/2 for virus replication. at 24 h after siRNA transfection, cells were infected with MERS-CoV-WT or MERS-CoV-p4 at an MOI of 3. total cell lysates and RNAs were prepared at 9 h p.i. Western blot analysis of viral S protein, M protein, N protein, and tubulin (E) at 24 h siRNA after transfection, cells were mock infected or infected with MERS-CoV-WT or MERS-CoV-p4. the effects of inefficient SG accumulation on translation activities were examined next. TIA-1 or G3BP1/2 did not affect the accumulation of viral mRNAs, mRNA 1 and mRNA 8. inhibition of SG formation by depletion of TIA-1 or G3BP1/2 would not affect the status of eIF2 phosphorylation in infected cells. accumulation of the 4b protein, but not that of the 4a protein, occurred in MERS-CoV-4a-infected cells. efficient phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2 occurred in infected cells. fected cells contributed to the lower level of 4b protein accumulation in MERS-CoV-4a-infected cells than in MERS-CoV-WT-infected cells. both viruses replicated to comparable levels with similar kinetics in Vero cells at both high and low MOIs. both viruses replicated to comparable levels with similar kinetics in Vero cells at both high and low MOIs. HeLa/CD26 cells were either mock infected (Mock) or infected with MERS-CoV-WT or MERS-CoV-4a (4a) at an MOI of 3. whole-cell lysates were prepared at 9 h p.i. and subjected to Western blot analysis to detect PKR, phosphorylated PKR, eIF2, phosphorylated eIF2 and tubulin. the 28S and 18S rRNAs were detected by ethidium bromide staining. Western blot analysis of intracellular accumulation of the MERS-CoV S, M, and N proteins and tubulin. each dot represents the mean virus titer (standard deviation) for three wells. this is the first report uncovering the biological role of SGs in coV infection. we observed cell type-dependent SG formation in infected cells. efficient eIF2 phosphorylation-mediated translational suppression induced by phosphorylated eIF2 triggers SG formation. replication of a herpes simplex virus 1 mutant activates PKR and induces eIF2 phosphorylation in HeLa cells but not in Vero cells. inefficient viral protein synthesis occurred in MERS-CoV-4a replication. similar levels of nsp3 to nsp16 and N proteins early in infection. if this is the case, it would result in similar levels of viral mRNA accumulation in cells infected with these three viruses. the absence of SG formation led Rabouw et al. to suspect that MERS-CoV encodes at least one other stress response antagonist. mERS-CoV-p4 infection did not induce the accumulation of IFN-, IFN-1, OAS, and ISG56 mRNAs in HeLa/CD26 cells. the poor accumulation of viral mRNAs in the SGs prevents the recognition of viral mRNAs by RLRs in the SGs. depletion of TIA-1 or G3BP1/2 inhibited replication of MERS-CoV-WT. inhibition of SG formation by depleting TIA-1 or G3BP1/2 is more pronounced. some viruses, e.g. flaviviruses and alphaviruses, inhibit SG accumulation. MERS-CoV-p4 and MERS-CoV-4a were rescued by using a reverse genetics system. a recombinant PCR procedure was used to delete both ORFs 4a and 4b or only ORF 4a in fragment F of the reverse genetics system of MERS-CoV. all experiments with infectious MERS-CoV were performed in an approved biosafety level 3 laboratory. cells were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 15 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) fected with virus at an MOI of 3 at 8 h p.i., medium was replaced with growth medium containing 100 g/ml CHX (Sigma) dissolved in DMSO. an equal volume of DMSO was added to the control medium. confluent cells were infected with MERS-CoV-WT, MERS-CoV-p4 or MERS-CoV-4a at an MOI of 0.01 or 3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with the appropriate medium. the secondary antibodies consisted of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) cells were mock infected with MERS-CoV-WT, MERS-CoV-p4 or MERS-CoV-4a at an MOI of 3. the purity of the amplified PCR products was confirmed by the dissociation melting curves obtained after each reaction. the primers for human IFN- mRNA were 5\u2032-AAGGCCAAGGAGTACAGTC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ATCTTCAGTTTVGGAGGTAA-3\u2032 (reverse) the primers for ISG56 mRNA were 5\u2032-CAGCAACCATGAGAAAT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ACCACAGAGTGT total cellular RNAs were extracted from mock-infected cells or infected cells. a DIG-labeled riboprobe was used to detect MERS-CoV mRNAs. cells were either mock infected or infected with the indicated siRNAs. MERS-CoV-p4 lacking ORFs 4a and 4b, and MERS-CoV-4a lacking ORF 4a were rescued by using a reverse genetics system. a recombinant PCR procedure was used to delete both ORFs 4a and 4b or only ORF 4a in fragment F of the MERS-CoV reverse genetics system (55). anti-MERS-CoV N protein antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide. at 8 h p.i., medium was replaced with growth medium containing 100 g/ml CHX (Sigma) dissolved in DMSO. cells were infected with anti-digoxigenin-fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-eIF4AI/II antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. the cells were washed in wash buffer III (8% formamide, 2% SSC) and incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies. anti-eIF2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-tubulin antibody (Calbiochem), anti-MERS-CoV N protein antibody, or antibodies for MERS-CoV proteins. secondary antibodies consisted of goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) cDNAs were synthesized using the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) and a Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) to specifically detect MERS-CoV mRNAs. qRT-PCR was performed using a bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR apparatus. the primers for 18S rRNA were 5\u2032-CCGGTACAGTGAAACTGCGAATG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ACCACAGAGTGGCACAGTTAG-3\u2032 (reverse) the primers for MERS-CoV mRNA 8 were 5\u2032-CTCGTTCTCTCTTGCAGAGAACTTTG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TGCCCAGGTGGAAAGGT-3\u2032 (reverse) statistical significance was defined as a P value of 0.05."}
