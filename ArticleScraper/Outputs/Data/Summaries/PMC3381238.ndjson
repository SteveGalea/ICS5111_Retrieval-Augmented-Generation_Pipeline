{"summary": "membrane rafts are small (10\u2013200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol, and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. the long, saturated acyl chains of sphingolipids allow tight packing thus juxtaposition with the unsaturated acyl chains of bulk membrane phospholipids leads to phase separation. raft localization can serve to facilitate or obstruct protein interactions. despite significant efforts in developing methodology and techniques for lipid raft research, there are still some shortcomings in precise determination of their size, structure and composition. 96 lipid rafts produce more reliable results. compared properties of both detergents in the same set of experiments. lipid rafts are preserved under physiological conditions by retaining the proteins associated with the intracellular part of the membrane. the best-characterized raft proteins include lipid-modified proteins containing saturated acyl chains, such as GPI-anchored proteins, and doubly acylated proteins. many other physiologically important proteins have been investigated for their possible raft localizations, including key proteins involved in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) caveolae are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and SM. they are the site of several important protein\u2013protein interactions. flotillins are palmitoylated and myristoylated proteins, anchored to the plasma membrane. tetraspanins are a large family of small membrane-spanning proteins. they are involved in a whole range of cellular processes. they include receptors, channels, recognition molecules, coupling factors and enzymes, facilitating their interaction and supporting signaling. lipid rafts have been suggested to be involved in cardiovascular disease, carcinogenesis, and immune system diseases. however, this review will focus on the role of lipid rafts in the pathogenesis of AD, a condition with which lipid rafts have multifarious links. sporadic AD is the dominant form. it exists in three isoforms (APP695, APP751, and APP770) exon 7 is homologous to protease inhibitors of the Kunitz type (KPI domain) exon 8 is related to MRC OX-2 antigen in thymocytes. cleavage occurs between Lys16 and Leu17, within the A region. the second pathway involves -secretase cleavage of APP. this is responsible in large part for the pathogenesis of AD. -secretase releases a soluble ectodomain sAPP and the C-terminal fragment CTF83. a complex of presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 had -secretase activity. a complex of presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 had -secretase activity. zinc metalloproteases of the disintegrin and metalloprotease family mediated cleavage. ADAM10 was found to be the dominant enzyme of APP processing in SH-SY5Y cells, given a lesser effect of ADAM17 knockdown. recent investigations have suggested that ADAM10 is the principal APP secretase in primary neurons. regulation of APP raft localization has been suggested to involve an interaction between the C-terminus of APP and flotillin-1 (Chen et al., 2006). a more recent study suggested that flotillin-2 may also act as a scaffolding protein, clustering APP in lipid rafts. tetraspanins regulate APP processing since -secretase ADAM10 is associated with TEMs. tetraspanins also regulate the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing. tetraspanins also regulate the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing. the acyl chains in lipid rafts are more able to pack together. APP (A region in maroon) is localized in raft and non-raft fractions. the -secretase is not raft-associated, while the - and -secretases predominate in rafts. the proteins of the -secretase complex, e.g., PS1, can induce lipid raft formation and decrease the membrane fluidity. a subset of proteins, in particular voltage-dependent anion channel 1 and contact in associated protein 1, are also associated with -secretase in lipid rafts. deletion of PrPc in HEK293 cells expression wild type reduced APP cleavage by BACE1. it is possible to suggest that age- and disease-dependent disruption of lipid rafts might be a cause of decreased ability of PrPc to control BACE1 activity. lserine suggests that the localization of NEP in different intracellular compartments may be involved in the metabolism of distinct pools of A. the endogenous targeting signal in wild-type NEP is well optimized for the overall neuronal clearance of A. some of the earliest work about subcellular localization of APP processing indicated that sAPP could be detected in neuronal NT2N cell lysates with the absence of sAPP or p3 fragments. this suggested an intracellular -secretase pathway with wild-type APP (wtAPP) and APP carrying the Swedish mutation. functional AICD is produced only via the amyloidogenic pathway and only from the APP695 isoform. this process was also shown to be neuronal cell specific and lipid raft dependent. APP regulates the transcription of several target genes, some better characterized than others. AICD regulates sphingolipid synthesis via serine-palmitoyl transferase. sphingomyelin is characteristic only for eukaryotic cells where it comprises about 10\u201315% of total phospholipids. SM is essential for the activity of some types of receptors, including the 7 nicotinic receptor (Col\u00f3n-S\u00e1ez and Yakel, 2011), NMDA receptors (Wheeler et al., 2009), neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (Trov et al., 2011), serotonin1A receptor (Jafurulla et al., 2008) and the urokinase receptor sphingomeylin is specific for the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. the pattern of individual species of sphingomeylin was also found to be different in various types of cells and even in cell compartments. lipid metabolism undergoes significant changes in the aging brain. Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids with one or more sialic acid residues. they are essential components of all animal cell membranes where they are anchored in the external leaflet by the hydrophobic ceramide part of their molecule. the oligosaccharide chain protrudes into the extracellular medium. link of gangliosides with AD pathology has been mostly related to their localization in lipid rafts. labeled A shows high affinity for GM1 containing membranes. it was suggested that cholesterol may facilitate GM1 clustering. ganglioside rich cells (C2C12) were able to induce A aggregation more potently than ganglioside-poor cells (HeLa and SK-N-MC) rafts isolated from brain tissue rich in gangliosides were able to increase A aggregation compared to rafts isolated from the liver with lower ganglioside content. GM3 was able to decrease production of A while GD3 was shown to increase its levels in COS7 cells. gangliosides are important for neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory response via maintenance of lipid rafts. in the PS/APP mice this was shown to reduce A accumulation in the brain. however, due to the antigenic properties of gangliosides this might provoke some side-effects. cholesterol is a key component of cellular membranes and of lipid rafts. cholesterol is integral to ordered lipid rafts. consequences of cholesterol depletion are widely regarded as effects of raft disruption. cholesterol content in membranes has an inversely proportional relationship with the membrane-perturbing effects of A oligomers. APP-derived species have been shown to impact on cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. cholesterol binds to APP at the -secretase cleavage sites and A itself can bind cholesterol and prevent its interaction with low-density lipoprotein. induced toxicity and slow down the process of formation of toxic aggregates of A with metal ions. this correlates with the data suggesting that cholesterol may have a protective effect against membrane disruption by amyloid species. statins are a class of drugs which inhibit HMG CoA reductase. a recent randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of simvastatin showed reduced A in treated patients, but no improvement in cognitive performance. the biochemical studies are fairly uniform in that cholesterol depletion results in reduction in key AD-related markers. however, the results of epidemiological research are unequivocal. some disease-related membrane proteins have a common SM-recognition site which underscores the role of lipid rafts in AD, HIV, and prion diseases. lipid raft biology was enhanced by the discovery of SM-specific probes, e.g., lysenin. Han and colleagues have compared levels of over 800 lipid species in control and AD brains. they demonstrated a significant decrease in SM and increases in ceramide levels in the affected brain. they hypothesized that this would impair functions of GLUT4, which was previously shown to be functionally linked to lipid rafts. osides are glycosphingolipids with one or more sialic acid residues. the oligosaccharide chain protrudes into the extracellular medium. gangliosides are particularly abundant in the plasma membranes of neuronal cells. gangliosides accumulate in senile plaques and may be involved in conversion of A to a neurotoxic oligomeric form. cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-cyclodextrin also did not have an effect on A oligomerization. rafts isolated from brain tissue rich in gangliosides were able to increase A aggregation compared to rafts isolated from the liver with lower ganglioside content. CHO-K1 cells genetically deficient in the synthesis of complex gangliosides had lower levels of A aggregation than the wild type cells. dependent and AD-related changes in brain ganglioside patterns and supports an essential role of APP in ganglioside homeostasis. GM3 was able to decrease production of A while GD3 was shown to increase its levels in COS7 cells. this might be related to changes in properties of lipid rafts containing different amounts of GM3 or GD3 ganglioside species. cholesterol is a key component of cellular membranes and of lipid rafts. the picture is by no means a simple one with cholesterol being ascribed both positive and negative roles. other diseases are also linked to cholesterol. cholesterol content in the membranes has an inversely proportional relationship with the membrane-perturbing effects of A oligomers. low cholesterol levels will lead to up-regulation of the activity of the -secretase, ADAM10. cholesterol depletion in cells by MCD was shown to affect APP-processing and formation of functionally active AICD. peptides modulate the metabolism of cholesterol, in particular its esterification rate, and of phospholipids in hepatocytes, neuronal cells, and in the entire brain. it was also found that A peptides alter vesicle trafficking and cholesterol homeostasis. rol supplemented SH-SY5Y cells showed reduced binding of ADDLs to the plasma membrane. oligomers increased in membrane presence after treatment with the cholesterol-depleting agent MCD. statins are a class of drugs which inhibit HMG CoA reductase. statin therapy had no effect on the prevention or treatment of dementia. however, it is very difficult to get a conclusive assessment of the accumulated data. lipid raft constituents, in this case sphingolipids, can affect AD processes in an APP-independent manner. accumulation and action of these lipid mediators promotes inflammation, a process characteristic of AD. cholinergic system and 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Lipid rafts have been implicated in regulating the clustering of. nAChRs via the myristoylated peripheral membrane protein, rapsyn. perturbation of the rafts impedes the interaction between rapsyn and nAChRs. cholesterol affects the properties, both structural and functional, of some acetylcholine receptors. the 7 nAChR regulates intracellular signaling effects of Ca2+. the receptor is closely linked to the signaling of cAMP (via adenylyl cyclase) AChE is found associated with amyloid plaques, leading to suggestion that AChE may promote A aggregation. monoclonal antibodies directed against the PAS inhibit fibril formation (Reyes et al., 1997). the associated enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and a synthetic peptide derived from the BuChE C terminus (BSP41) have also been shown to reduce amyloid fibril formation. the corresponding synthetic peptide, however, did not significantly affect A fibril formation. PrPc interacts with the NMDA receptor complex in a copper-dependent manner to allosterically reduce glycine affinity for the receptor. copper chelators or PrPc inactivation enhance the activity of glycine at the receptor resulting in steady-state NMDAR currents and neurotoxicity. lipid rafts are the site of formation of a complex between the ER, insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), Cav-1, and a voltage gated anion channel, VDAC. the formation of this signaling complex is neuroprotective but also lipid raft dependent. +-ATPase and Na+-K+ ATPase are enriched in lipid rafts. they are responsible for maintaining ionic gradients and modulating neuronal excitability. this study also found the post-synaptic density to be associated with lipid rafts. the cholinergic system and the 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Lipid rafts have been implicated in regulating the clustering of nAChRs via the myristoylated peripheral membrane protein, rapsyn. perturbation of the rafts impedes the interaction between rapsyn and nAChRs. vesicles imply that the partitioning of the nAChR into raft domains is not solely due to the intrinsic biophysical properties of the receptor but requires a signaling event to translocate the protein into specific membrane domains. cholesterol affects the properties, both structural and functional, of some acetylcholine receptors. disruption of lipid rafts with adenylyl cyclase has significant effects on receptor desensitization kinetics. additional interactions of the 7 nAChR have been assessed using a proteomic screen. it has been suggested promoting its activation via novel agonists may represent a new therapeutic approach in AD. in some brain regions with AD pathology, virtually all of the AChE is localized in these complexes. a direct interaction between A and AChE has been proposed. those inhibitors which occupy the PAS show the most significant reduction in fibril formation. PRiMA is a 20-kDa type I transmembrane protein which can be acylated. it contains a CRAC (cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus) motif which sequesters PRiMA into lipid rafts. it has been suggested that the lipid raft localization and shedding of AChE may have a certain role in the pathology of AD. it is possible for lipid rafts to modulate signaling in a general way by affecting the activities of signaling molecules involved in multiple pathways. this includes, for example, the pleiotropic src kinases (Arcaro et al., 2007) with effects on the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. lipid raft signaling complex is neuroprotective but also lipid raft dependent. 3xTg mice had a deficit in growth factor signaling and neurodevelopmental signaling. lipid rafts are linked to cell adhesion with cell-cell contact regions. lipid rafts represent dynamic structural components of cellular membranes integrating signaling events and regulating cell functioning. this review has concentrated on the links between lipid rafts and AD pathology since processing of AD-related APP and production of A peptide are clearly affected. lipid raft research may open new avenues in regulation of the proteolytic and signaling processes involved in AD pathology. the most recent discovery of the role of lipid raft disruption in decreased production of the functionally active transcriptional regulator AICD. the role of the lipid components in cell membrane functioning is extremely important for normal functioning of cells and organisms."}
