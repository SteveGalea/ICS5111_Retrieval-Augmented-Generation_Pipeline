{"summary": "west Nile virus (WNV), a plus-sense, single-stranded neurotropic flavivirus, has been a public health concern in north America for more than a decade. the virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle that involves mosquitoes and birds. infection in humans results from mosquito bites, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, breast feeding, and in utero or occupational exposure. NK cells are important for early immune reactions against viral infections and cancer. they are a subset of lymphocytes that provide innate effector mechanisms through secretion of cytokines and direct cytotoxic effects. NK cells are important for early immune reactions against viral infections and cancer. the role of NK cells during in vivo WNV infection remains controversial. the divergent phenotypic and functional features of NK cells are often influenced by organ-specific factors, including local microenvironment and unique cellular interactions. NK cell activation is regulated by the balance of activating and inhibitory receptors on its surface. the inhibitory receptors killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors in humans, the lectin-like Ly49 (mouse) and the CD94-NKG2A dimers bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. NK cells are known to sense microbial and non-microbial signals from target cells through a variety of activating and inhibitory receptors. NK cells are also known to sense microbial and non-microbial signals from target cells through a variety of activating and inhibitory receptors, which influence cytotoxicity towards virus-infected cells and cancerous cells. the role of NK cells during in vivo WNV infection remains controversial. the divergent phenotypic and functional features of NK cells are often influenced by organ-specific factors, including local microenvironment and unique cellular interactions. the role of NK cells during in vivo WNV infection remains controversial. hepatic NK cells were found to inhibit liver fibrosis and tissue regeneration by promoting stellate cell death. NK cells were capable of preventing the spread of WNV infection only to certain mouse tissues, such as the liver, but not the spleen. NK cell activation is regulated by the balance of activating and inhibitory receptors on its surface. NK cells are known to sense microbial and non-microbial signals from target cells through a variety of activating and inhibitory receptors. NK cells can detect microbial signals by stimulation of their pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) or being activated by innate cytokines predominantly produced by infected DCs. T cells can rapidly produce cytokines, such as IFN-, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-17. in mice, T cells include mostly V1, V2, V4, V5, V6, and V7 subsets [51], which have direct and indirect effects on host immunity to many infectious pathogens. phenotype similar to that observed in TCR/ mice in response to WNV infection. both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been shown to be responsible for the cytolytic activity detected in splenocytes during the first week of WNV infection. splenic DCs had an impaired antigen-presenting capacity. a low level of WNV replication in T cells induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. this suggests that crosstalk between T cells and DCs plays an important role in promoting DC maturation and T cell priming. edodes of the Basidiomycete family of fungi rich in -glucans, enhanced the protective V1+ T cell response and thus attenuated viremia in aged mice. depletion of V4+ cells in young mice resulted in a lower mortality following WNV-induced encephalitis [56,71] pathogenic effects of V4+ cells are mediated via the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines during WNV infection. TLRs sense different pathogen\u2013associated molecular patterns (PAMP) during microbial infection. expression of PRRs, such as TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8, on T cells has been reported [82,83,84,85]. T cells activated by plasmacytoid DCs upon infection by another important flavivivirus, yellow fever virus. if T cells are induced by WNV directly via their innate immune receptors, such as TLRs, or indirectly by interaction with TLR-expressing innate immune cells remains under investigation. both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been shown to be responsible for the cytolytic activity detected in splenocytes during the first week of WNV infection. T cells may contribute to the cytolytic activity against WNV in the periphery directly and/or indirectly by regulation of T cell response. splenic DCs had impaired antigen-presenting capacity. lower levels of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II expression. this suggests crosstalk between T cells and DCs plays an important role in promoting DC maturation and T cell priming. the pathogenic effects of V4+ cells are mediated by the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines during WNV infection. the pathogenic effects of V4+ cells are mediated via the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines during WNV infection. TLRs sense different pathogen\u2013associated molecular patterns (PAMP) during microbial infection. expression of PRRs, such as TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/8, on T cells has been reported [82,83,84,85]. TLRs are known to directly or indirectly contribute to T cell activation. NK cells and T cells play both similar and dissimilar roles in host immunity to WNV infection. they both respond rapidly and non-specifically to WNV infection. they control viral dissemination by secretion of IFN- and/or cytolytic activity. Diversity Not known V1 and V4 subsets have distinct roles in protection and pathogenesis Organ-specific function Yes, mouse liver and spleen NK cells have different roles during WNV infection."}
