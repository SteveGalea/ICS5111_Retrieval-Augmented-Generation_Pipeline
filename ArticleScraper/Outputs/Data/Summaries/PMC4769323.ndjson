{"summary": "the Hipposideridae, commonly known as the Old World leaf-nosed bats, are widespread and are distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of the Old World. they consist of nine extant genera (see table 1 for classification) and at least 82 species (Simmons 2005). the Rhinolophidae comprise 77 species encompassed in a single genus, Rhinolophus (Simmons 2005). llum Craseonycteridae Craseonycteris thonglongyai Megaderma spasma lyra Rhinolophidae Rhinolophus hipposideros shameli pusillus creaghi euryale trifoliatus ferrumequinum sinicus luctus pearsoni Hipposideridae Anthops ornatus Asellia tridens Aselliscus stolicz a number of molecular phylogenies have emerged which typically sample only two or three Hipposideridae genera. the familial status of the Hipposideridae, the monophyly of its most speciose genus Hipposideros, represent several areas of outstanding phylogenetic controversy. a recent revision of the hipposiderid genus Triaenops resulted in a separation between Triaenops and a new genus Paratriaenops. another recent revision rendered the genus Paracoelops invalid because a re-examination showed that it was misidentified originally and actually best assigned to Hipposideros. a recent molecular phylogenetic study included four of the nine Hipposideridae genera. a single mitochondrial and nuclear genes supported the monophyly of the genus. the clade that is most basal within extant Rhinolophidae is still controversial. early suggestions regarding the origin of the Hipposideridae, based on morphological data, favored either an African or an Asian origin. re-evaluation of divergence time estimates using a resolved phylogeny is required to elucidate the familial or nonfamilial status of the Rhinolophidae. the genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros are notable for their high species number and cryptic diversity. they represent good candidate taxa to investigate whether there is a common macroevolutionary factor underlying the high species numbers observed in these genera. a wider diversity of coronaviruses has been described from the Rhinolophidae. betacoronaviruses-b, from the SARS group, have also been found in the close relatives of the Rhinolophidae. host phylogeny is the primary factor that determines virus persistence and replicative ability in new hosts. knowledge of host phylogeny can predict the source of new emerging diseases. systematic surveillance for emerging coronaviruses should be orientated based on resolved phylogenies highlighting additional potential reservoir species. we hypothesize that slower evolving exons should provide resolution of more recent nodes in a tree following their widespread use in resolving intergeneric and species level relationships. a comparative diversification analysis focusing on Rhinolophus and Hipposideros was used to elucidate the evolutionary history of the Hipposideridae. our phylogeny addresses the following outstanding phylogenetic questions: 1) Do hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats represent an independent family or subfamily of the Rhinolophidae\" 3) When did hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats diverge and where did they originate? 4) Which species or clade is the most basal lineage of the Rhinolophidae? the distinctiveness of hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats was first recognized with the establishment of the subtribe Rhinonycterina (Gray 1866), later elevated to subfamily by McKenna and Bell (1997), and the subfamily Hipposiderinae (Flower and Lydekker 1891). a recent revision of the hipposiderid genus Triaenops resulted in a separation between Triaenops and a new genus Paratri Hipposideros is the most speciose hipposiderid genus, accounting for 67 of the 82 recognized species (Simmons 2005), a number that is increasing due to the description of new cryptic species. a recent molecular phylogenetic study included four of the nine Hipposideridae genera. a single species, R. pearsoni, was reported as the basal lineage with all other species (including R. hipposideros) but it is still uncertain whether both the sister groups Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae warrant independent familial status. previous estimates of the time of divergence of these two groups indicate that they diverged about 39\u201345 Ma. Molecular data, based on Cyt b, have placed the Rhinolophidae center of origin in Europe and suggest that from there, they expanded their geographical range into Asia and Africa. the exon and 3\u2019-UTR-derived tree of Teeling et al. (2005) supported an Asian origin, which conflicts with the African origin proposed by Eick et al. (2005) based on nuclear introns. research arising from the outbreak has identified bats as a likely natural reservoir for several zoonotic viruses. the Rhinolophidae are of particular interest because R. sinicus, R. pusillus, R. macrotis, and R. ferrumequinum were suspected to be directly implicated in the outbreak of SARS in china. emergence and subsequent deaths caused by coronaviruses-like SARS-CoV and more recently Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have brought into sharp focus the potential health risks arising from the emergence of novel coronaviruses. there is growing body of support to show that bats and viruses form host/virus associations. the phylogeny of Eick et al. (2005) focused on interfamilial relationships among bats. we hypothesize that slower evolving exons should provide resolution of deeper nodes, following their successful use in resolving phylogenies. methods, divergence time estimates, and biogeographical analyses were employed to elucidate the evolutionary history of the Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae. a comparative diversification analysis focusing on Rhinolophus and Hipposideros was used to elucidate if the diversification patterns of these speciose lineages are similar through time. jModeltest indicated the most appropriate model of sequence evolution for each individual gene fragment using the Akaike Information Criterion. each data set, exons, introns, and exons+introns were analyzed with and without the outliers identified by the Phylo-MCOA analysis. phylogenetic analysis Each of the six data sets for phylogenetic analysis produced largely congruent topologies across all analyses. differences between intron topology and both exon and exon+intron topologies are shown in supplementary figure S1, Supplementary Material online. the subtribe Rhinonycterina (sensu Gray 1866: 81) is supported by a long branch indicative of significant phylogenetic distance. the other monophyletic clade contains all other Hipposideridae with Asellia basal in all analyses. the genus Hipposideros is paraphyletic in all analyses. 98\u2013100 BSS, BA 1.0 PP propose to elevate this subtribe to full familial status. yinpterochiroptera Springer et al.

Cloeotis and Triaenops are sister taxa, ML 97\u2013100 BSS, BA 1.0 PP. the association between the geographically disparate Rhinonicteris, Cloeotis, and Triaenops also receive strong support from all analyses, ML 98\u2013100 BSS, BA 1.0 PP. the family Rhinonycteridae have five principal features of the rhinarium observable in extant species. the soft part characters of the rhinarium (noseleaf) outlined here are derived from Gray (1845) and Hill (1982), with verification of specimens in The Natural History Museum, London (BMNH) the Rhinonycteridae are further distinguished from Hipposideridae by a 128-bp retrotransposon insertion in the THY gene fragment. the Rhinonycteridae differ from the Nycteridae, Van der Hoeven, 1855:1028 and Megadermatidae, H. Allen, 1864:1 based on noseleaf structure. members of the Rhinonycterida both the Rhinonycteridae and Hipposideridae differ in terms of echolocation call structure from the Rhinolophidae, emitting typical pulse durations of around 15 ms or less in \u201csearch mode\u201d. the rhinarium (noseleaf) is derived from Gray (1845) and Hill (1982), with verification of specimens in The Natural History Museum, London (BMNH). the Rhinonycteridae are further distinguished from Hipposideridae by a 128-bp retrotransposon insertion in the THY gene fragment. the Rhinonycteridae differ from the Nycteridae, Van der Hoeven, 1855:1028 and Megadermatidae, H.

Morphological data place this genus among other Hipposideridae spp. (Bogdanowicz and Owen 1998; Hand and Kirsch 1998). these morphological results are in agreement with molecular data, which found strong support for a sister taxa relationship. support for the association of H. commersoni and H. vittatus as sister taxa to Aselliscus and Coelops is derived from the exons and exons+introns data set. the monophyly of the remaining Hipposideros spp. was strongly supported by all analyses. phylogeny of our data included taxa recovered by previous studies as basal clades in the Rhinolophidae. a basal division between Asian and African/European clades and an alternative in which R. hipposideros is basal. the Rhinolophidae are estimated to have diverged from the ancestor of the Rhinonycteridae and Hipposideridae approximately 42 Ma during the Eocene. an african origin for the Hipposideridae is in contrast to the Asian origin proposed by Teeling et al. (2005). a terrestrial continental dispersal route is better supported for Rhinonycteridae by the fossil record. the fossil taxon Brachipposideros nooraleebus is thought to be sister taxa to Rhinonicteris (Sig\u00e9 1968; Legendre 1982; Sig\u00e9 et al. 1982; Hand and Kirsch 1998). divergence time estimates for these two genera are concurrent, occurring between 15 and 17 Ma. this indicated that these genera underwent a largely concurrent, rapid diversification during the Miocene, coinciding with the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. this period may have represented optimal conditions for the evolution and rapid diversification of these lines in response to more favorable climatic conditions. incorporating fossil taxa introduces error in the form of taphonomy and sampling bias. inclusion of fossil data to biogeographic analysis would introduce a European/Australian bias based on the majority of species ascribed to this group. the recent emergence of the novel MERS-CoV has highlighted the importance of detecting and monitoring animal reservoirs of potentially pathological novel coronaviruses. the phylogenetic position of a SARS-like CoV between Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae derived from Rhinonicteris is supported by the resolved phylogeny for these bats. a resolved phylogeny is a considerable aid to conservation. it informs management plans operating under the EDGE strategy. phylogenetic trees that contain both old and young divergences would be best resolved by a combination of exon and intron data. introns evolve faster than exons and can provide more phylogenetic information. saturation of the phylogenetic signal was not an issue for introns. this may stem from the alignment process, where highly variable and divergent intronic sites are removed from analyses. the phylogenetic analysis revealed strong support for the monophyly of these two families (Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae) across all data types and analyses performed. the phylogenetic analysis revealed strong support for the monophyly of these two families (Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae) onycterina was recognized by later studies and expanded to include Triaenops and Cloeotis. these taxa fitted the original description for the Rhinonycterina based primarily on noseleaf morphology (Hill 1982) the association of these genera is also supported by our molecular data. our findings provide strong support for a sister taxa relationship between Aselliscus and Coelops. support for the association of H. commersoni and H. vittatus as sister taxa to Aselliscus and Coelops is derived from the exons and exons+introns data set. the monophyly of the remaining Hipposideros spp. was strongly supported by all analyses. the monophyly of the remaining Hipposideros spp. was strongly supported. taxa relationship between R. trifoliatus and R. hipposideros containing clades as the basal clade based on an analysis of Cyt b and intron data. phylogeny of our data provided two further alternative topologies. a basal division between Asian and African/European clades and an alternative in which R. hipposideros is basal. the ancestors of the Rhinonycteridae and Hipposideridae diverged 39 Ma during the Eocene. the distribution of the extant members of the Rhinonycteridae is unusual in that Rhinonicteris is endemic to Australia, while all other members of the family are distributed in and around Africa. fossil taxon Brachipposideros nooraleebus is thought to be sister taxa to Rhinonicteris (Sig\u00e9 1968; Legendre 1982; Sig\u00e9 et al. 1982; Hand and Kirsch 1998) based on this, Brachipposideros is thought to have dispersed into Australia 15\u201320 Ma. based on this, Brachipposideros is thought to have dispersed into western Europe, Asia, North Africa, and Australia. retroviral insertion unique to the clade containing Paratriaenops, Triaenops, Cloeotis, and Rhinonicteris. the phylogenetic analysis revealed strong support for the monophyly of these two families (Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae) Hipposideridae The familial delimitation of Rhinonycteridae and Hipposideridae results in Asellia being basal to all other Hipposideridae. the genus Aselliscus contains two species, and its placement in the Hipposideridae phylogeny has been controversial. monophyly is also rejected by morphological data. support for association of H. commersoni and H. vittatus as sister taxa to Aselliscus and Coelops is derived from the exons and exons+introns data set. our data show that Anthops forms a poorly supported group with H. jonesi, H. armiger, and H. larvatus. the strong support for the monophyly of this clade indicates that Anthops most likely represents an incorrectly classified member of the genus Hipposideros. two distinct clades are present in this family, one of african and one of Asian origin. the phylogeny showed that, with the exception of the basal taxa R. pearsoni, two distinct clades are present in this family, one of african and one of Asian origin. an african origin for the Hipposideridae is in contrast to the Asian origin proposed by Teeling et al. (2005) and Bogdanowicz and Owen (1998) and the Australian origin proposed by Hand and Kirsch (1998). no previous biogeographic hypothesis exists as to the origin of the component taxa of what is recognized herein as the Rhinonycteridae. we did not find support for the European origin for this family as proposed by Guillen-Servent et al. (2003). biogeographic reconstructions were not able to pinpoint the geographic origin of the Rhinolophus crown group. divergence time estimates for these genera are concurrent, occurring between 15 and 17 Ma. the oldest fossil attributable to a lineage can provide a minimum age in a soft bound analysis. stratigraphic layers can be assigned to incorrect geological times. this is particularly applicable to bats which have a poor and limited fossil record. the basal clade of the Rhinolophidae remains unresolved. however, our reconstruction is the first to include all previously recovered basal candidates for this group. phylogeny has implications for the detection and surveillance of novel coronaviruses. coronaviruses have been detected so far in Rhinolophus. phylogenetic analyses resulted in a well-resolved phylogeny. the phylogenetic controversies surrounding the Hipposideridae settle for the first time. the largest genus of the Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, and Rhinonycteridae originated in africa. our phylogeny provides the foundation essential for \u201csystematic surveillance\" of emerging bat-based novel coronaviruses. ten of the 40 taxa analyzed were outgroup taxa represented. our 20 hipposiderid taxa represent all nine of the currently recognized genera. the remaining 30 taxa are split between the rhinolophid (n = 10) and hipposiderid bats (n = 3). in total, 40 species, including A. ornatus, from eight families were analyzed. DNA was isolated using a modified salt/chloroform extraction protocol (Miller et al. 1988), which included an additional chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24/1) step. PCR products were purified using Exosap (USB) and sequenced in both directions. complementary sequences were assembled and edited for accuracy using codonCode Aligner 3.7.1. single gene fragments were preliminarily aligned with MAFFT. the markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain was run for 10 million generations sampling every 1,000 generations. the resulting trees were collated using TreeAnnotator v1.7.2 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007) with 10% discarded as burn-in to obtain a single representative tree for each gene fragment. to evaluate the effect of removing outliers, we analyzed our data with and without outliers. the steps taken to optimize the alignment of each data set were then evaluated using the GUIDANCE web server. each position of our alignments were confidently aligned with regard to tree uncertainty. bayesian analysis was carried out in PhyloBayes to implement the CAT model of site rate heterogeneity. the mixture model options in PhyloBayes for nucleotide data are restricted to variants of either a general time reversible (GTR) or a Poisson process of sequence evolution. alternative topology tests were performed under the next most complicated model GTR+G. the log likelihood of each tree was calculated in Tree Puzzle 5.2 (Schmidt et al. 2002), and KH, SH, and AU tests were implemented in Consel. maximum bounds on fossil calibrations were calculated as two stage ages lower than the stage age containing the oldest representative fossil described by Meredith et al. (2011). geological stages ages were taken from Gradstein and Ogg (2009) and rounded to the nearest whole number. distribution data were gathered for all taxa in the tree from Bat Distribution Viewer (Polish Academy of Sciences, http://gis.miiz.waw.pl/webapps/thebats/iucn/) except for Rhinopoma hardwickii. distributions for all species were coded as eight possible areas. sequences with 100% identity were identified and removed using CD-HIT server. 97.5% was used as the cutoff as low intraspecific mtDNA sequence divergence between 1% and 2.5% have been reported for bats. jmodeltest indicated GTR+I+G was the best model. each data set was analyzed in BEAST as described previously. ten random combinations of four exon gene fragments were generated. exon fragments (ADORA3, APP, ATP7A, BDNF, BUF134, PNOC, PLCB4, TTN3, TTN5, TTN6, TTN7, and RGF2) and seven intron fragments (ABHD11, ROGDI, ACOX2, BGN, THY, STAT5A, and PRKC1) of the 40 taxa analyzed, ten were outgroup taxa represented by two Yangochiroptera (Teeling all sequences were generated from the same sample for each species or from the same species collected in the same geographical area as the original sample. in total, 40 species, including A. ornatus, from eight families were analyzed. DNA was isolated using a modified salt/chloroform extraction protocol. PCR products were purified using Exosap (USB) and sequenced in both directions. single gene fragments were preliminarily aligned with MAFFT. single gene fragments were then re-aligned using the T-Coffee web server. preliminary gene trees for each gene fragment were generated in Beast v.1.7.2 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007) the markov chain was run for 10 million generations sampling every 1,000 generations. preliminary analysis revealed topological incongruence between intron and exon data. a small number of sequences (0.67%; 5/741; supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) were identified as outlying data. jModeltest was rerun as before for each gene fragment to obtain an appropriate model of sequence evolution. beAST uses a single Markov chain in its analysis, whereas MrBayes uses two independent chains. the resulting run was analyzed as above for single-gene trees generated using BEAST. jModeltest was used to determine the most appropriate model of sequence evolution for the concatenated alignment. analysis was run under the next most complicated model GTR+G. analysis was run under the HKY85 model of sequence evolution. maximum and minimum soft-bound calibrations were applied at four major nodes across the tree to constrain the analysis. the oldest fossil ascribed to each lineage provided the minimum bound for the fossil calibration. maximum bounds were calculated as two stage ages lower than the stage age containing the oldest representative fossil described by Meredith et al. (2011). Stratigraphic bounding provided a maximum bound of 49 Ma. constraint applied to the split between Craseonycteridae and Megadermatidae. distribution data were gathered for all taxa in the tree. all available Cyt b and Cox1 sequences for Rhinolophus and Hipposideros species were downloaded from GenBank (April 30, 2013) four data sets were prepared for the diversification analysis. jModeltest was used to identify the most appropriate model of sequence evolution for each data set. jmodeltest tested whether exons perform better at resolving older nodes. we compared the relationship between PP and height for intron and exon data sets. this analysis was carried out using the results of BEAST runs. jModeltest indicated GTR+I+G was the best model for these data sets. supplementary table S4 and tables S1\u2013S4 are available at Molecular Biology and Evolution online."}
