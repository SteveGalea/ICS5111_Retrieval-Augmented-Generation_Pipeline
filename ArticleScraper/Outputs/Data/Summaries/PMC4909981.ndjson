{"summary": "Approximately 40 countries in central and south America have experienced local vector-born transmission of Zika virus. of the cases that have sought care thus far, more than 70,000 have been reported out of Colombia. recent infectious disease outbreaks have presented great challenges to the global public health community. many studies have retrospectively examined nontraditional digital data sources. these methods fill a knowledge vacuum that may prove useful for public health decisions in early stages of an outbreak. in this paper, we use nontraditional digital disease surveillance data via healthMap and Google Trends to develop near real-time estimates for the basic and observed reproductive numbers associated with Zika virus disease in Colombia. the cumulative reported case curve obtained from these reports shows an unrealistic L-shape. the level of nationwide search interest in the word \u201cZika\u201d from January 4, 2004 (first available datum) to April 16, 2016. the scaling constant was obtained by dividing the most recent total number of healthMap-reported Zika cases by the total number of Google search fractions from May 31, 2015 to April 16, 2016. the observed number of secondary infections per infected individual was calculated using the following equation: Robs = R0/(1+ d)t. when d is greater than zero, R0 does not equal Robs. in such circumstances, disease incidence is nonexponential due to either planned or unplanned reduction in disease duration, contact rate, or infectiousness of cases [18] IDEA model fits against smoothed HealthMap cumulative case data for Zika virus disease in Colombia. a serial interval length of 17 days was used. a total of 14 deterministic serial interval lengths were used. modeled values for each parameter are shown across all 14 serial interval lengths. traditional (INS) data yielded a mean R0 of 5.36 (range 2.52-9.63) and a mean d of 0.07 (range 0.02-0.14) basic reproductive numbers obtained using the IDEA model are comparable to simple SIR-type models. the IDEA model is a reasonable method for analyzing nationwide transmission dynamics of Zika virus disease in Colombia. the IDEA model is a reasonable method for analyzing nationwide transmission dynamics of zika virus disease in Colombia. using traditional (INS) data yielded higher R0 estimates than the digital (smoothed HealthMap) cumulative reported case counts. the narrow range of possible case projections generated by the traditional (INS) data was largely encompassed by the wider range produced by the digital (smoothed HealthMap) cumulative reported case counts. the data acquisition and modeling approach presented in this paper may still benefit other Zika-affected countries with limited capacity for government-implemented health care-based data collection. traditional surveillance data should be used preferentially, but in its absence digital surveillance data can yield comparable estimates for key transmission parameters."}
