{"summary": "syncytial virus is an important cause of acute respiratory tract infection in young children. the common respiratory manifestations are bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchiolitis. by the age of 2 years, approximately 90% children are infected by RSV. approximately 45% of the hospital admissions occur in children younger than 6 months. the pathogenesis of the neurologic complications is not fully understood. the incidence of RSV-associated encephalitis was 0.08%. the same study showed that MRI findings may resemble those of other viral and limbic encephalitis. no abnormality on diffusion-weighted imaging was found. complex febrile seizure was defined as a focal, 2) generalized, and prolonged seizure lasting more than 15 minutes and recurring with 24 hours, or 3) postictal neurological abnormalities. a simple febrile seizure was defined as a seizure occurring during a febrile illness. complex febrile seizure was defined as a focal, 2) generalized, and prolonged seizure lasting more than 15 minutes and recurring with 24 hours. a total of 1,193 children were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection during the study period. 35 of them had neurological complications with seizures. most of them were younger than 36 months (32 of 35, 91.4%) the peak incidence month was November. the seasonal distribution corresponded with the outbreak report of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. for 21 patients (21 of 35, 60.0%), EEG signals were recorded. six of them (6 of 21, 28.6%) showed abnormal focal discharges. neuroimages were acquired for 26 patients (26 of 35, 74.3%) Detailed characteristics of patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection and febrile seizure Patient Sex/age (mo) Seizure type Features Other conditions CSF Brain image EEG Outcome 1 M//19 S, GTC - Bronchiolitis ND ND ND Recovered 2 F/13 S, GT - - NL CT (NL) ND Recovered 3 F/18 S, GTC - Pneumonia (rhinovirus, mycoplasma NL CT (NL) NL Recovered 17 M/17 C, GTC 3 times/day Pneumonia NL CT (NL) ND Recovered 18 M/15 C, GTC 2 times/day - NL MRI (NL) ND Recovered 19 M/31 C, GTC >20 min Pneumonia (parainflu) NL MRI (NL) NL Recovered 20 M/4 C, hypomotor >20 min Bronchitis NL CT (NL) ND generalized tonic-clonic (n=2), generalized tonic (n=1), hypomotor (n=1), and myoclonic (n=1) patients had no family history of epilepsy and showed respiratory symptoms. brain MRI abnormalities were observed in one of the patients: benign cavernous angioma. seizure with meningitis, confirmed by CSF examination, was observed in 2 patients (both girls; mean age, 4.04.2 months) one of the patients was a 7-month-old girl with urinary tract infection; she did not present with definite respiratory symptoms and showed abnormal EEG signals. the patient was admitted to the PICU and gradually recovered over a week. neurological complication was not found and the abnormal discharges on EEG had disappeared. a total of 1,193 children were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection. afebrile seizure only 5 (14.3) 16.814.4 4:1 Encephalopathy with seizure 1 (2.9) 1.6 0:1 Meningitis with seizure 2 (5.7) 4.04.2 0:2 Total 35 (100) 20.816.6 19:16 SD, standard deviation. the most common neurologic manifestation was febrile seizure. is in 2 patients (38.5 37.5/mm3; range, 12\u201365/mm3) and high opening pressure (>18 cmH2O; range, 20\u201326 cmH2O) in 3 patients. simple febrile seizure was observed in 13 (48.1%) and complex febrile seizure in 14 (51.9%) ND ND ND ND Recovered 4 F/21 S, GT - Pneumonia ND ND Recovered 5 M/15 S, GTC - Bronchiolitis ND ND Recovered 6 M/19 S, GTC - Bronchitis ND ND ND Recovered 7 M/55 S, GTC - Bronchitis ND ND ND Recovered 8 F/18 S, GTC - Pneumonia NL CT (NL) ND five patients showed afebrile seizures without meningitis or encephalopathy (boy, 4; girl, 1; mean age, 16.814.4 months) the types of seizure were as follows: generalized tonic-clonic (n=2), generalized tonic (n=1), hypomotor (n=1), and myoclonic (n=1). one of the patients who presented with epileptiform discharges from the parietal area during the first seizure later evolved to epilepsy. further details of the clinical profiles of afebrile seizures are described in Table 3. a case with encephalopathy and transient MRI changes was observed in 1 patient. a case with encephalopathy and transient MRI changes was observed in 1 patient. on the first hospital day shows high signal intensity (HSI) at the internal capsule (upper and middle arrow) and splenium of the corpus callosum (lower arrow) on DWI. on the fourth hospital day shows disappearance of HSI on DWI, suggesting that the mechanism of encephalopathy was transient cytotoxic edema. febrile seizure was most common followed by afebrile seizure. febrile seizure may occur in any condition with acute elevation of body temperature in genetically predisposed children. most of the febrile seizures are generalized, with approximately one-third of the patients exhibiting complex febrile seizure and febrile status epilepticus occurring in 5% of the cases. febrile seizure is not as severe as encephalopathy is, but cytokine responses may be related with multiple or prolonged febrile seizures. the incidence of afebrile seizure in Japanese children has been reported to be 0.59% (6 of 1,019 patients), which is similar to the incidence reported in our study. encephalopathy with seizure was rare and observed in only one patient. she recovered without complications, and DWI showed transient changes. cytotoxic edema of white matter may not always be associated with poor outcome. the abundant N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptors in the corpus callosum may lead to intracellular calcium entry. the limitation lies in not including the nonseizure RSV-associated neurological complications and the inability to test RSV from CSF."}
