{"summary": "feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease in cats caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) the genome size of FCoV is approximately 28.9 kb, including a non-structural replicase gene, four structural genes encoding the spike (S), envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. a total of 46 cats from a private cat shelter were subjected to this study from September 2011 to august 2012. the shelter houses adult cats and occasionally some kittens. all of the cats were either stray animals or had been rescued, and some were being raised at the homes of various private cat rescuers. changes in kidney, liver and intestine Effusive/non-effusive 10b 3m Jul. 11, 2011 NA Nov. 05, 2011 Granulomatous changes in kidney, liver and omentum Non-effusive 11c 1y6m Resident NA Feb. 14, 2012 Jaundice, fibrinous peritonitis, granulomatous changes in thoracic and abdominal wall, kidney, liver, lung, spleen omentum RNA was extracted from 300 L of swab suspension, whole blood, fecal suspension, tissue homogenate and body effusion using Trizol. all specimens were screened for FCoV by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) PCR was performed on 2 L of the first PCR product using nested primers. expected size of the second PCR yielded for type I and II FCoV were 360 and 218 bp. specific primer sets that can amplify from the 3\u2032 end of the type II FCoV to the 3c gene were designed to confirm the nucleotide sequences. the products were electrophoresed, purified and sequenced from both orientations to confirm the nucleotide sequences. information for all FIP-suspected and confirmed cats from the cat shelter Cat no Age1 Date of enter the shelter Date of enter Date of enter the shelter Date of fever onset Date of death Clinical findings Necropsy findings Effusive/non-effusive 1 3m Jun. 16, 2011 Aug. 17, 2011 Sep. 01, 2011 Fever, anorexia, ascites, neurological signs 2a 4m Aug. 06, 2011 NA2 Sep. 21, 2011 Clinical signs unavailable 3b 3m Effusive/non-effusive 12c 1y6m Resident NA Mar. 19, 2012 Jaundice, fibrinous peritonitis, granulomatous changes in thoracic and abdominal wall, kidney, liver, lung, spleen omentum, and eyes. non-effusive 1 Age of the cats when clinical signs of FIP appeared. 2 Not available. RNA was extracted from 300 L of swab suspension, whole blood, fecal suspension, tissue homogenate and body effusion using Trizol. 20 microliters of isolated RNA were reverse transcribed with template-specific primer N1 (5\u2032-gctacaattgtatcctcaac-3\u2032) the expected size of the second PCR yielded for type I and II FCoV was approximately 600 bp. amplicons were electrophoresed, purified and sequenced from both orientations. amplicons were electrophoresed, purified and sequenced from both orientations. the temperature cycling consisted of 5 min of preheating at 94\u00b0C. 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 46\u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 90 s. the products were electrophoresed, purified and sequenced from both orientations. all of the resident cats in the shelter were immediately screened for FCoV using RT-nPCR. six kittens with body effusions and/or neurological signs succumbed within the first two months without necropsy confirmation. type II FIPV detected in all eight of the animals that succumbed to FIP in their swab samples, feces, urine, body effusions, cerebrospinal fluids and tissue homogenates. fecal samples, nasal/oral/conjunctival swab samples and urine collected by cystocentesis were found. only type I or untypable FCoV were detected from the fecal samples. the eight FIP cats were consistently found to be infected with a type II FCoV, whereas the healthy cats were not. truncated 3c proteins with premature stop codons at amino acids 47, 210 and 218 were found, respectively. the identity of the 620 bp amplicons derived from seven type II FIPV was approximately 98.7% to 99.8%. the identity of the 620 bp amplicons derived from seven type II FIPV was approximately 98.7% to 99.8%. the alignment of the 3\u2032 end of the S gene to the downstream genes of FCoV isolated from seven FIP cats with type I FCoV and CCoV. the light and dark shaded areas encompass higher similarity to CCoV and type I FCoV. intact 3c genes were detected from cats 1, 7 and 10, which had previously succumbed to FIP. two more distinct nonsense mutations were identified from cats 11 (E47*) and 13 (Q218*) Fever was first observed in four kittens (cat 1, 3, 4, 5) within a few days. clinical signs, e.g., fever, anorexia, neurological signs, panting and/or abdominal extension were observed for the following two months. six kittens (cats 1-6) with body effusions and/or neurological signs succumbed within the first two months without necropsy confirmation. cat 1 was once presented to our teaching hospital, and ascites was taken from the cat. 13 of 46 cats (28.3%) died from FIP between September 2011 and April 2012. able 25 ++ ++ + + I 26 -
