{"summary": "EAV is a small enveloped virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of 12.7 kb. it belongs to the family Arteriviridae, which also includes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice. type I interferon (IFN-/) is a key component of the host innate immune response to viral infection. recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in double-stranded RNA by intracellular receptors. the IFN- promoter contains positive regulatory domains (PRDs), including the binding sites for different transcription factors. NF-B is also a critical regulator of host innate and adaptive immunity. viruses have evolved strategies to counteract key elements of the IFN response. viruses can either activate or inhibit the NF-B pathway in order to replicate in host cells. virulent Bucyrus strain of EAV (EAV VBS, horse passage 15 pleural fluid; ATCC VR-796, Manassas, VA) was propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. sendai virus, the Cantell strain (SeV; ATCC VR-907, Manassas, VA), was propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. the coding regions of each of the twelve nsps were PCR-amplified from the EAV rVBS full-length infectious cDNA clone. the nsp5, nsp6, nsp10, and nsp12 were expressed as C-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion proteins. the specificity of each recombinant protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. the pRL-SV40 plasmid expresses a Renilla luciferase under the control of a simian virus promoter. the pcDNA3-TRIF and pCMV2-IKK2-WT were purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) polyclonal rabbit antisera recognizing EAV nsp1 (MAb 12A4) and N protein (MAb 3E2) have been described previously. RNA from each culture was treated with DNase to remove any contaminating genomic DNA (gDNA) the reverse transcription reaction was performed with 1 g of total RNA using RT random primers and a MultiScribe reverse transcriptase. gene mRNA was equal to 2Ct where Ct = [(Avg. gene of interest Ct Avg. -GUS Ct)calibrator] the calibrator was calculated from the mean Ct of mock-infected samples for each individual gene. plasmid pCAGGS-NS1 expressing swine influenza virus NS1 was used as positive control. at 20 h after transfection, cells were infected with seV at 5000 HA unit/0.5 mL/well. luciferase activity is defined as the ratio of firefly luciferase reporter activity to Renilla luciferase activity. a transfection mix containing DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 in OPTI-MEM I was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and added to each well. cells were incubated with primary antibody in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. nuclear staining was performed with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 3 min at RT. bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) and 100 U/g per mL penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) virulent Bucyrus strain of EAV (EAV VBS, horse passage 15 pleural fluid; ATCC VR-796, Manassas, VA) was passaged once in EECs to obtain high-titered working stocks for the present study the specificity of each recombinant protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. reporter plasmids expressing the firefly luciferase under control of either the IFN- promoter (p125-Luc) or an artificial promoter containing three IRF-3 binding sites (p55-CIB-Luc) were kindly provided by Yoneyama et al. antisera against nsp9 and nsp11 raised by immunizing rabbits with purified full-length recombinant proteins expressed in coli. anti-FLAG MAb (F3165) purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) was used to detect FLAG-tagged EAV fusion proteins in immunofluorescence assay.
