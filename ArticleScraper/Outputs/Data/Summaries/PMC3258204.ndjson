{"summary": "influenza in pigs is currently endemic in most swine populations around the world. many factors contribute to the severity of the disease including age, viral strain, concurrent infections, and immune status of the animals. both human and animal health officials have paid greater attention to flu in pigs due to the role that pigs play in inter-species transmission. a key parameter is the reproduction ratio (R) of the infection. it is defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual in a population during its entire infectious period. when R is greater than 1, an infection can spread in a population but if R is less than 1, the infection will die out within a population. three-week-old cross-bred pigs from a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) herd were obtained. the sows had not been vaccinated against influenza virus. all piglets were screened at the herd of origin for influenza antibodies. pigs in the HE group received 2 mL intramuscularly (IM) of a commercial licensed influenza vaccine. each vaccination was repeated two weeks later. each pig was left unvaccinated to be intratracheally and intranasally challenged with influenza. the homologous vaccine contained three distinct inactivated influenza isolates and an adjuvant. the strains belonged to the and groups and were genetically distinct from challenge strain. all piglets were sedated by an intramuscular injection of a dissociative anesthetic at the recommended dose of 6.6 mg/kg. success of inoculation in the seeder pigs was confirmed by positive influenza A RT-PCR from nasal swabs. serum albumin was supplemented with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) the viral RNA was extracted using the magnetic particle processor procedure (MagMAXTM Viral RNA Isolation Kit, Applied Biosystems, USA) the minimum detection limit of influenza virus by this method is 101 TCID50/mL. the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A viruses was recorded for each pig. lesions were photographed, sketched on a standard diagram. the proportion of affected lung was assessed by RT-PCR. argy were recorded for a period of 10 min/observation day in each room. temperatures 40\u00b0C were considered a significant febrile response. log-transformed results (HI antibody titers) and influenza A Multiscreen ELISA mean values were analyzed using a paired t-test. pigs remaining influenza PCR negative at the end of the study were censored. survival curves were also used to calculate the infectious period. I t/N as offset variable was used to calculate the estimates of the transmission parameter by day (t = 1). using the daily transmission rate and the infectious period of the contact infected pigs, the reproduction ratio R was calculated for each replicate in each group, as. statistically significant differences between R estimates were based on the existence of non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals (C.I.'s) if a pig died during the study, it was considered censored and N became N-1. the GLM method was used because the NV group had zero susceptible animals when the infection process ended. the proportion and cumulative proportion of 10 000 simulations by the number of new cases was displayed in graph format. the direct method of Gillespie was used to model random events of transmission and recovery. pigs were free of infection with influenza virus, PRRS virus, and M. hyopneumoniae. all piglets were screened at the herd of origin for influenza antibodies. pigs in the HE group received 2 mL intramuscularly (IM) of a commercial licensed influenza vaccine. each vaccination was repeated two weeks later. the pigs in the NV group were injected with 2 mL of sterile saline solution IM. the homologous vaccine contained three distinct inactivated influenza isolates and an adjuvant. the strains belonged to the and groups and were genetically distinct from challenge strain. piglets were sedated by an intramuscular injection of a dissociative anesthetic. success of inoculation in the seeder pigs was confirmed by positive influenza A RT-PCR from nasal swabs at 24 h. serum albumin was supplemented with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) the viral RNA was extracted using the magnetic particle processor procedure (MagMAXTM Viral RNA Isolation Kit, Applied Biosystems, USA) the minimum detection limit of influenza virus by this method is 101 TCID50/mL. lesions were photographed, sketched on a standard diagram, and the proportion of affected lung assessed. tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically for histopathologic changes. swab was suspended in 2 mL of minimum essential medium. swab was supplemented with 4% bovine serum albumin. the viral RNA was extracted using the magnetic particle processor procedure. the ELISA measures antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A viruses. lesions were photographed, sketched on a standard diagram, and the proportion of affected lung assessed. clinical signs of cough, dyspnea, sneezing, nasal discharge and lethargy were recorded for a period of 10 min/observation day in each room. temperatures 40\u00b0C were considered a significant febrile response. log-transformed results (HI antibody titers) and influenza A Multiscreen ELISA mean values were analyzed using a paired t-test. pigs remaining influenza PCR negative at the end of the study were censored. the survival curves were also used to calculate the infectious period. log I t/N was used to calculate the estimates of the transmission parameter by day (t = 1). the logistic regression model cannot provide a direct estimate of the transmission rate. fected pigs, the reproduction ratio R of the infection was calculated for each replicate in each group, as well as the overall R for each group of treatment after the replicates were combined. if a pig died during the study, it was considered censored and N became N-1. the proportion and cumulative proportion of 10 000 simulations by the number of new cases for each replicate was displayed in graph format. the direct method of Gillespie was used to model the random events of transmission and recovery. the infectious period was defined as the time between the first and the last day that virus could be detected from nasal swabs in a pig. the survival curves were also used to calculate the infectious period. log I t/N was used to estimate the transmission parameter by day (t = 1). the logistic regression model cannot provide a direct estimate of the transmission rate. differences between R estimates were based on the existence of non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals (C.I.'s) if a pig died during the study, it was considered censored and N became N-1. the number of new cases (contact infected susceptible individuals) observed for each simulation was assessed for each replicate with the initial number of infectious, susceptible, and recovered individuals at 1, 10, and 0, respectively. the proportion and cumulative proportion of 10 000 simulations by the number of new cases was displayed in graph format. serology Pigs were both antibody and influenza virus negative at the start of the study. two weeks after the second vaccination, the homologous vaccine induced robust HI titers against the challenge strain (IA04), but mean reciprocal titers above 1:160. necropsy NV 10 10 10 10 10 15 12 HE 14a 33b 307 240 229 82 494 344 HO 297 360 38 57 10 10 10 21 Before

RT-PCR test on nasal swabs All seeder pigs were RT-PCR positive at 48 h post inoculation and prior to comingling with the contact susceptible pigs. all the contact pigs (100%) in the NV group were found RT-PCR positive by 5 dpc. in the vaccinated groups, 15 out of 40 pigs (37.5%) in the HE group and none of the pigs (0%) in the HO group were the average infectious period for the contact infected NV pigs was 4.5 1.07 days and 3.50 1.84 days for the contact infected pigs in the HE group. the infectious period was 1 day shorter in pigs vaccinated with the HE vaccine than in the NV pigs, but the difference was not statistically significant. cAverage number of days between exposure and first sample detected positive. 1, 2Statistically significant differences (p 0.05) in the HE group, one pig was humanely euthanized at 11 dpc for reasons not related to influenza and was censored. generating an R0 estimate much greater than 1, simulations yielding no new cases or minor outbreaks also occurred in approximately 15% of the simulations. the proportion of 10 000 simulations from the stochastic SIR model with initial values of (S = 10, I = 1, R = 0) for each NV replicate. a maximum of 7% of simulations yielded 10 new cases compared to 84% of the simulations for the NV replicates. macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions NV pigs had pneumonia with areas of lung consolidation at necropsy. mean lung lesion score for the pigs in the HE group was significantly higher (p 0.05) than the mean for the pigs in the HO group. the severity of the lung lesions was scored at 1.41 0.49 in the HO group. the severity of the lesions was scored at 1.16 0.67 in the HE group. differences were statistically significant (p 0.05) between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. the estimated R values in the vaccinated groups were significantly different from the values in the NV group. in the HO vaccinated group R was estimated at 0, and in the HE group R ranged from 0.32 to 1.8, with an overall estimate of 1 (95% CI, 0.39-2.09) however, R in the HE group was not statistically significant below 1. we predicted vaccination of the seeder pigs would have influenced the number of excreted influenza A viruses. however, further studies are needed to determine the effect of excretion on the infectivity of influenza vaccinated pigs. the infectious period was one day shorter in the HE group than in the NV group. a recent study reported that transmission of a H5N1 was not affected by vaccination of broiler chickens. in horses, R was reduced to 2.4 for a homologously vaccinated population. results from our study also suggest that vaccination of pigs can be used to reduce their level of susceptibility. he replicates with lower R values (0.32 and 0.51) yielded a higher proportion of stochastic simulations with no new cases. a lower R estimate equates to fewer secondary cases due to a typical infectious individual during its entire infectious period. pigs with reciprocal HI antibodies titers 20 against the challenge strain were virologically protected. pigs in the HO group had geometric mean HI titers of 295, while the geometric mean in the HE group was 14 against the challenge strain before exposure to the seeder pigs. the low immunogenicity against the challenge virus in the HE pigs was expected. at the end of the study not all pigs that had seroconverted to the challenge strain shed virus. lack of detection could be due to protection and lack of virus replication. homologous to the challenge virus was vaccinated with a commercial licensed vaccine. it is well documented that strain-specific antibody is more effective than cross reactive-antibody in conferring protection against flu infection. pigs that received the homologous vaccine had no detectable virus in nasal secretions, had a robust antibody response to the challenge virus. inactivated vaccines can lead to antigenic drift, loss of vaccine efficacy, and emergence of new strains. subclinical infections with virus shedding can occur in vaccinated animals. a limitation of our study is the inoculation dose of the seeder pigs. a heterologous vaccine was used in heterologous vaccinated pigs. it was delayed and variable in the heterologous vaccinated group. active transmission took place even in the absence of clinical signs and presence of immunity. the University of Minnesota Veterinary Population Medicine Department, College of Veterinary Medicine."}
