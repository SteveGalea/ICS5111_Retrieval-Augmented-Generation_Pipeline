{"summary": "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency renders red blood cells susceptible to oxidative stress. g6PD deficiency has also been found in other types of cells than RBC, such as leukocytes and myocytes. ative stress is an imbalance between antioxidant defence (enzymatic and nonenzymatic) and production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in favour of RONS. G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder and the most common enzymopathy. there is a growing concern that G6PD deficiency may be involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases mediated by oxidative stress. there is a paucity of information about the activity of G6PD in other cells such as white blood cells and myocytes. results The literature search revealed a few case report studies on G6PD deficiency and its association with muscle G6PD activity and exercise. two of these articles report cases of G6PD individuals with clinical symptomatology following exercise. the other one, which describes the case of a world class runner, did not report adverse results. the combination of two red blood cell defects (G6PD deficiency and sickle cell trait) may render RBC more susceptible to oxidative stress, resulting in severe haemolysis after intense exercise Demir et al. five experimental studies examined effects of exercise on various haematological and/or blood redox status indices in G6PD-deficient individuals. none of these methodologically sound experimental studies report unwanted results following different modes and types of exercise. 9 males (29.1 3.1 yrs) with G6PD deficiency (D) & 9 males (29.0 2.0 yrs) with normal G6PD activity (N) run at 75% HRmax for 45 min No Preexercise: Hct, GSH in D than N Postexercise: no changes in GSH, GSSG, GSH/GSSG or lipid hyperoxides (in both D and N) total MP concentrations were positively correlated with MDA concentrations D may participate in MM without higher MP concentration and oxidative stress compared to N Lee et al. muscle G6PD deficiency is a relation with muscular symptomatology after exercise. only one patient developed myoglobinuria after intense exercise. another patient reported moderate exercise intolerance and recurrent episodes of myalgia and muscle fatigability. study examined oxidative stress after exercise until exhaustion in G6PD-deficient individuals. nine men and nine controls matched for age and maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) participated in two exhaustive treadmill exercise protocols of different duration. no changes in GSH, GSSG, GSH/GSSG, or lipid peroxides were found for any group after exercise. moderate intensity exercise at approximately 75% MHR may not cause oxidative stress or haemolytic anaemia in G6PD-deficient individuals. exercise does not perturbate redox status indices (TBARS, GSH, and GSSG) in a G6PD male individual. however, it has to be mentioned that this individual was well-trained. exercise does not seem to perturbate the redox status of G6PD-deficient individuals to a greater extent than individuals with normal enzyme levels. the use of herbal or dietary supplements at therapeutic doses is not likely to induce haemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals. only henna (Lawsonia inermis) was found to increase the possibility for haemolysis. supplementation with -lipoic acid has shown to improve some indices of redox status in G6PD-deficient individuals with no signs of haemolytic anaemia. alpha-tocopherol supplementation resulted in increased pre- and postgame antioxidant status (TAS) postgame G6PD activity was also increased after alpha-tocopherol supplementation compared to postgame G6PD activity at baseline. further research is needed to assess whether supplementation with antioxidants or cysteine donors would increase GSH levels. GSH, GSSG, haematocrit (Hct) and haemoglobin (Hb) were significantly lower in the G6PD-deficient group than the control group at the baseline. after the two exercise protocols, Hct and Hb levels did not change, GSH decreased, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls (PC), catalase, and total antioxidant capacity increased in both groups. nine G6PD-deficient males and nine control males matched for age and maximum isometric torque performed an isokinetic eccentric contraction session of the knee extensors of both legs. Immediately and till 5 days after exercise, changes in indices of muscle function, redox status, and haemolysis were similar to those in the control group. studies have examined the effects of exercise training on redox and health status in general on G6PD-deficient individuals. dietary supplements may help in the prevention or improvement of haemolytic anaemia, as well as other adverse effects of oxidative stress. supplementation with -lipoic acid, a sulphur-containing compound, has shown to improve some indices of redox status in G6PD-deficient individuals. vitamin E may protect the membranes of RBC from oxidation and consequent haemolysis. no study has looked into effects of supplementation on health aspects in physically active individuals with this deficiency. ine donors would increase GSH levels and therefore help cells counterbalance exercise-induced oxidative stress. this is of great importance if someone takes into account that exercise has pleiotropic positive effects on health, and G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy."}
