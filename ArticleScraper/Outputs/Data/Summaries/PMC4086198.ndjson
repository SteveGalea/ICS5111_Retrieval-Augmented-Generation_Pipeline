{"summary": "ARTIs can be caused by a wide variety of pathogens, among which viruses and bacteria are the main agents involved. a substantial amount of respiratory diseases cannot be attributed to any known commonly involved microorganisms. the pool of human respiratory viruses keeps growing because of the continuous introduction of \u201cnovel\u201d pathogenic viruses from the animal reservoir. papillomaviruses carry a circular double stranded DNA genome. they are known for their capacity to induce warts and benign lesions of mucous membranes. some human papillomaviruses (HPVs) can cause cancers. sample was collected from a 64-year-old heavy smoking male patient. symptoms included cough, phlegm production, shortness of breath, wheeze, coryza, fever, chest pain, muscle aching, and headache. the patient was part of a randomized antibiotics placebo-controlled trial. ETHICAL APPROVAL Ethics review committee of Cardiff and Southampton approved the study. written informed consent was provided by the participants. -papillomavirus fragments identified after performing VIDISCA-454 were used as template for primer design. cultures were grown to the exponential phase prior to induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 5 h. samples were collected every hour to monitor the protein production. blots were incubated with 1:600 dilutions of either V1 or V2 serum. AACGAAGAGGTAGCAGAC-3\u2032, RTReverse-675\u2013700: 5\u2032-TGGCGCAACTGCCTTTATCTAG-3\u2032, RTProbe-620\u2013650: 5\u2032 FAM- GGGCTGTATTCCGCCAACTGGTGATG -TAMRA 3\u2032. only samples with detectable virus in both tests were considered positive. adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, human bocavirus, human coronaviruses, mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus spp. all diagnostics remained negative. the full late gene L1 (coding for the major capsid protein) was amplified with the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche), cloned into pET100D expression vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21-derived strain Rosetta 2 (Novagen) cultures were grown to the exponential phase prior to induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside ( a total of 13,452 sequence reads were obtained and compared with all known sequences in GenBank (NCBI) the viral genome is 7142 bp in size, circular and 99% identical to the recently described HPV-KC5 isolate (GenBank accession number: JX444073; Li et al., 2012). the virus was detected in the NPFS of both nostrils at V1, but also in the NPFS of both nostrils after the patient recovered. the viral load in all samples was very low, between 2E3 and 2E4 copies/mL, and the Ct values were similar for all samples. -HPVs are not known as respiratory pathogens and their role in any disease is still uncertain. specific diagnostic tests were developed and applied. the virus was detected in the NPFS of both nostrils at V1, but also in the NPFS of both nostrils after the patient recovered. two patients (3.7%) were positive for HPV-A2619. both patients came from the same city in the UK as the indexcase. a low viral copy number was detected (between 2E3 and 2E4 copies/ml) in literature it is described that some types of HPV can cause human papillomatosis, lesions in the respiratory tract that need to be surgically removed. the patient described here did not have a history of human papillomatosis, and the symptoms lasted only for 14 days. however, the clinical data from this patient gave no evidence of tumor. d DNA genome and their detection by VIDISCA-454 does not depend on reverse transcription and second strand synthesis, procedures which decrease the detection potential of RNA viruses. d DNA genome and their detection by VIDISCA-454 does not depend on reverse transcription and second strand synthesis. the detection of low load viruses is not uncommon since minority nucleic acids can be efficiently sequenced. we identified a -HPV in the respiratory tract of a patient with symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. the virus was still detectable after full recovery and no rise in antibodies was observed. however, we concluded that the virus was not the causative agent of the respiratory disease of this patient. no indication could be found that human papillomatosis was involved. however, the clinical data from this patient gave no evidence of tumor. we therefore concluded that HPV-A2619 does not have a specific pathogenic role in a detectable disease. it is therefore important to confirm the presence of the recognized viruses in the original sample and to investigate the clinical relevance of every discovery to avoid drawing false conclusions. targeted experiments and careful evaluation of all available data are essential to assess the relevance of every finding."}
