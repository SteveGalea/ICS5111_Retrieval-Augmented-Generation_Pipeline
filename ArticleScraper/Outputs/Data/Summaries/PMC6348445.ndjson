postnatal appointment at their nearest primary healthcare facility. the dried blood spot samples were sent to district-level hospitals (Level 2). tests followed the same circuitous path back to the patients. an ideal test should be affordable to those at risk of infection, result in few false-negatives (sensitive) and false-positives (specific), and be user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to the populations in need of the test. the required performance parameters of a test depend on its intended use-case scenario. based on inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials can be exploited as potential solutions. section 2 describes inorganic biomarkers that are associated with infectious diseases. section 4 details the critical advancements in inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials for signal generation probes that have allowed the field of POC diagnostics to rapidly progress. malaria parasites digest host hemoglobin in the acidic digestive food vacuole. the breakdown of one hemoglobin molecule releases four molecules of heme (ferriprotoporphyrin IX [Fe(III)PPIX]) which are highly toxic to the parasite. hemozoin has a magnetic moment and is thus attracted up a magnetic gradient in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. the magnetic properties have been exploited for separation, purification, and concentration of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) from blood samples. hemozoin has been leveraged for malaria diagnosis in several ways. conventional relaxometry alone is insufficient for sensitive malaria detection. these findings led to a reaction by Karl et al.36 and a response by Peng et al.37. microvascular microscope (MvM) measures cell velocity in vivo. hemozoin particle velocity could be measured in vivo. iRBCs can persist in circulation for weeks after infection is cleared. magneto-optical detection exploits both the paramagnetic and optical properties of malarial hemozoin crystals. this phenomenon induces an optical dichroism across the dispersion of crystals, resulting in a detectable change in transmittance of modulated polarized light ( = 660 nm) hemozoin is synthesized by other parasites that infect humans. hemozoin has not yet been used as a diagnostic biomarker for nonmalarial pathogens. hemozoin as a biomarker presents some unique challenges to malaria diagnosis. first, the biocrystal is present at much lower concentrations in the ring stage when compared to the later trophozoite and schizont stages of the erythrocytic cycle. phagocytic cells ingest iRBCs and hemozoin released into circulation after schizont rupture, and hemozoin-containing white blood cells have been shown to persist in circulation schistosoma japonicum eggshells contain mature miracidia within a relatively impermeable eggshell. morphologies include overall egg shape (round to oval), spine position, and extent of filamentous coating. fecal samples were suspended in water and repeatedly sieved and washed before the sediment was incubated with magnetic particles that bound to the Schistosoma eggs. this technique was demonstrated to be more sensitive than Kato-Katz, the current WHO recommended sample preparation method for schistosome diagnosis in a field setting. candido et al.84 also observed that S. japonicum eggs bound more microparticles than S. mansoni. the group used Poisson analysis and found two distinct populations within each species. the results suggest that differences in filamentous microspines do not fully explain the mechanism of egg-microparticle binding. the Helmintex method originated with the idea that iron in the eggshells could serve as a handle for magnetically enriching Schistosoma eggs. this is particularly important for schistosomiasis surveillance and morbidity control campaigns, which aim to quantify and reduce the prevalence of high-intensity infections. hemozoin crystals contain reciprocating Fe(III)PPIX dimers linked through coordination between the central ferric ions and a carboxylate group of one of the propionate moieties on protoporphyrin IV. hemozoin has a magnetic moment and is thus attracted up a magnetic gradient in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. hemozoin has been leveraged for malaria diagnosis in several ways. hemozoin detection was first performed by Heidelberger et al.24 in 1946 for the purpose of vaccine development. both commercially available systems and custom-made microfluidic devices have been used to enrich iRBCs from whole blood samples for analysis by microscopy. iRBCs significantly enriched hemozoin in the portion of the pellet measured. ultrashort echo times may have allowed for probing of other protons. hemozoin particle velocity could be measured in vivo, potentially allowing for identification of cytoadhesion and sequestration. microvascular microscope (MvM) measures cell velocity in vivo. green light illumination detects blood flow through a vessel. successive frames of red light illumination show a single hemozoin particle moving through the vessel over time. whole blood (or lysed whole blood) is inserted into a magnetic field, orienting the paramagnetic crystals along the applied field direction. this phenomenon, known as the Cotton-Mouton effect, induces an optical dichroism across the dispersion of crystals, resulting in a detectable change in transmittance of modulated polarized light ( = 660 nm) hemozoin is synthesized by other hematophagous parasites that infect humans, including the Schistosoma, Echinostoma, and Opisthorchis trematodes. hemozoin has not yet been used as a diagnostic biomarker for nonmalarial pathogens. hemozoin-containing white blood cells have been shown to persist in circulation up to 17 days after parasite clearance. this persistence can lead to false-positive results in hemozoin-based malarial diagnostics unless an algorithm for distinguishing pigment-containing white blood cells and iRBCs is devised. soma eggshells has been studied since the 1960s,78 the inorganic components of the eggshells were not investigated until 2007, when Jones et al.79 demonstrated the presence of iron in the eggshells. the group used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to provide evidence that iron localized to the eggshell. x method were that biotinylated lectins would bind to carbohydrates on the surface of Schistosoma mansoni eggs. lectins were not necessary for egg binding to magnetic particles, nonmagnetic latex particles did not bind to S. mansoni eggs, and (3) the eggs alone did not migrate to an external magnet. candido et al. and candido et al. studies were performed on eggs isolated from livers of infected mice, but do these two populations appear in the urine or feces of infected humans. the work by candido et al. opens up many questions, the answers to which could greatly inform further optimization of the Helmintex method. stosomiasis surveillance and morbidity control campaigns aim to quantify and reduce the prevalence of high-intensity infections. the Helmintex method originated with the idea that iron in the eggshells could serve as a handle for magnetically enriching Schistosoma eggs for more sensitive detection in the field setting. elucidation and optimization of the true binding mechanisms could lead to an even more impactful method for diagnosing low-intensity schistosomiasis infections metal coordination chemistry is defined as the chemistry of metal atoms or ions that form complexes with one or more ligands. this technique involves the conjugation of various ligands to a solid support matrix such as agarose, cellulose, or silica. the fixed metal ions serve as Lewis acids, coordinating to both the immobilized ligands and specific amino acid residues in a protein biomarker. many companies have developed their own proprietary structures such as TALON95 or Ni-Penta. IDA (iminodiacetic acid) is a tridentate ligand (coordination number = 3), with the remaining three coordination sites in the metal available to bind two histidine residues and a water molecule. the authors used biolayer interferometry (BLI) to determine kinetic constants (e.g., kon, KD) for the binding of the various metals to HRP2. co2+ and Zn2+ exhibited the fastest binding kinetics (highest kon) and the highest HRP2 binding affinity (lowest KD) on BLI biosensors. the device incorporated a silica resin solid phase functionalized with Zn(II)-IDA into a pipet tip. it enabled rapid capture of HRP2 from whole blood samples using the principles of IMAC. a small volume sample was then deposited onto a commercially available rapid diagnostic test. IMAC-functionalized cellulose membranes present a unique advantage in relation to other materials because of the ease in which they can be incorporated into paper-based diagnostic formats that are usable in low-resource settings. magnetic particles have been employed as signal generation labels. magnetic particles thus represent a promising vehicle for chemistries in low-resource settings. the biomarker was eluted with an imidazole-spiked running buffer. it enabled highly sensitive HRP2 detection with few added user steps. this enhanced sensitivity could make a substantial difference in malaria elimination campaigns. pfhrp2 has been shown to persist in host circulation up to 52 days after successful treatment. pLDH clears within 24 h after parasite clearance. a dual assay can distinguish between resolved and active infections. aptamers are short, single-stranded nucleic acid sequences with secondary structures that afford high (nanomolar\u2013picomolar) binding affinities. compared to antibodies, aptamers are smaller and may target unique epitopes, potentially allowing this innovative sample preparation strategy to be more universally applied. metal-affinity separation chemistry is defined as the chemistry of metal atoms or ions that form complexes with one or more ligands. this technique involves the conjugation of various ligands to a solid support matrix such as agarose, cellulose, or silica. the fixed metal ions serve as Lewis acids, coordinating to both the immobilized ligands and specific amino acid residues in a protein biomarker. co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ have predominantly been used in this application. TED (tris(carboxymethyl)ethylene diamine) is a pentadentate ligand (coordination number = 5) with one remaining coordination site for protein binding. the authors used biolayer interferometry (BLI) to determine kinetic constants (e.g., kon, KD) for the binding of the various metals to HRP2. co2+ and Zn2+ exhibited the fastest binding kinetics (highest kon) and the highest HRP2 binding affinity (lowest KD) on BLI biosensors.99. the device incorporated a silica resin solid phase functionalized with Zn(II)-IDA into a pipet tip. this small volume sample was then deposited onto a commercially available rapid diagnostic test which enhanced sensitivity for HRP2 detection in a POC setting. IMAC-functionalized cellulose membranes present a unique advantage in relation to other materials because of the ease in which they can be incorporated into paper-based diagnostic formats that are usable in low-resource settings. magnetic particles have been employed as signal generation labels. this application is discussed in sections 4.2.6 and 5.4. magnetic particles thus represent a promising vehicle for IMAC chemistries. a simple-to-use device for direct transfer of HRP2-bound IMAC-functionalized magnetic beads to a malaria LFA. this enhanced sensitivity could make a substantial difference in malaria elimination campaigns, which rely on detecting and treating all infected individuals. pfhrp2 has been shown to persist in host circulation up to 52 days after successful treatment. however, pLDH clears within 24 h after parasite clearance. a dual assay can distinguish between resolved and active P. falciparum infections. aptamers are short, single-stranded nucleic acid sequences with secondary structures that afford high (nanomolar\u2013picomolar) binding affinities. aptamers are smaller and may target unique epitopes, potentially allowing for this innovative sample preparation strategy to be more universally applied. metal complexes and nanoparticles have been instrumental in the development of targeted reagents for disease-associated DNA, proteins, or cells. their biomedical applications include the development of metallodrugs,127,128 enzyme inhibitors,129131 photothermal132,133 and photodynamic133 therapy agents. their unique optical, electrochemical, magnetic, and catalytic properties have also enabled their use as signaling modalities in diagnostics. microwell plate and microplate reader aqueous buffer 14.5 nM (0.972 g/mL)

method has trade-offs with regard to ease-of-use and interpretation, as well as complexity of instrumentation required to measure signal output. excited electrons in these complexes preferentially populate the 1MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) excited state (as opposed to 1MC) the excited electrons then undergo intersystem crossing and subsequently phosphoresce from a mixture of the 3LC (ligand-centered) and 3MLCT excited states. the tunable luminescence of Ir(III) complexes could be harnessed for signal transduction. a ligand exchange reaction\u2019s phosphorescent signal could be correlated to biomarker concentration. in the absence of HRP2, the diaquabis(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) complex demonstrated little to no luminescence. photoluminescence detection mechanism is dependent on existence of a histidine-rich biomarker. the assay used two aptamers: one highly specific for IFN- and the second was a guanine-rich nucleic acid sequence. the two aptamers were designed to be partially complementary and were prehybridized prior to the introduction of a sample containing IFN-. quadruplexes were specific for a cyclometalated Ir(III) complex that produced phosphorescent signal that was correlated with IFN- concentration. the assay demonstrated adequate specificity for IFN- versus other proteins commonly found in biological matrices. the assay suffered a reduction in sensitivity when conducted in a 0.5% cell extract. electrochemical or ECL-based assays combine molecular recognition elements with electroactive inorganic probes. inorganic low-spin d6 complexes of Ir(III) and Ru(II, as well as hemin (Ferriprotoporphyrin IX) have been used in developing electrochemical- and ECL-based probes. both electrochemistry and ECL are signal generation strategies that are well-suited to the development of POC diagnostics. hemin, Ir(III) complexes and Ru(II) complexes have been used as electrochemical probes. hemin mimics the enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase in catalyzing the reduction of H2O2. the DNA construct consisted of a G-quadruplex aptamer specific for hemin (purple) and an IFN--specific aptamer (blue) both aptamers were prehybridized by an 8-nucleotide hairpin. in the presence of IFN-, the IFN--specific aptamer bound to IFN- and opened the hairpin. the potential sweep catalyzed the reduction of H2O2 by a gold working electrode was functionalized with a molecular beacon (MB) that contained an IFN--specific aptamer and an oligonucleotide sequence that was complementary to H1. when IFN- bound to the aptamer, the H1 sequence was freed and available to hybridize with its complement, H2. the developed Ir(III) probe then bound to the major and minor grooves of the H1\u2013H2 double helix. a detection limit of 16.3 fM and a dynamic range of 50 fM\u20133.0 pM could be conducted in samples that were 5.0% human serum. this assay yielded an 7000-fold improvement in limit of detection compared to the two previously discussed assays for detection of IFN-.145 This is due to the signal amplification that resulted from the groove-binding of numerous Ir(III) probes to the H1\u2013H2 double helix electron transfer from oxidized TPrA to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ forms excited state [Ru(bpy)3]2+ that is analogous to the 3MLCT state that is populated through absorption of a photon. the triplet excited state then undergoes phosphorescent decay to the ground state, allowing for luminescent detection of target biomarkers. coreactant ECL has proven to be the most advantageous for the development of diagnostic assays the authors150 incorporated the [Ru(bpy)3]2+-loaded immunoliposome into a membrane strip test for detection of the Legionella antigen. the strip test contained the following components: (1) a nitrocellulose membrane impregnated with Legionella antigen, (2) a glass fiber pad presoaked in SDS. both the antigen in the sample and the antigen embedded in the nitrocellulose competed for binding with the immunoliposome. the assay could be completed in 20 min and had a limit of detection of 2 ng/mL. the assay was dependent on a benchtop ECL analyzer and therefore ill-suited to a Level 1 healthcare setting in its current format. the detection probe was a gold nanoparticle-graphene nanocomposite loaded with [Ru(bpy)3]2+-doped SiO2 nanoparticles and generated electrochemiluminescent signal that could be correlated with p24 antigen concentration. a remaining challenge for developing luminescent, electrochemical, and ECL assays that incorporate inorganic complexes is thorough validation in complex biological matrices and clinical samples. inorganic complexes are rarely used as stand-alone probes for biomarker detection. the metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) is a nanosized network of organic ligands and metal ion/complex connections. inorganic nanoparticles have become ubiquitous as detection elements in numerous platforms (e.g., colorimetric, luminescent, electrochemical, thermal, etc.) each distinct class of nanoparticles possesses unique advantages and caveats. the reagent for forming amide bonds on nanoparticle surfaces is 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide (EDC), which produces an activated ester that can react with a primary amine. however, alone, the EDC-activated ester reacts slowly with amines, often leading to hydrolysis products that inhibit amide coupling. EDC coupling with imidazole enables conjugation of ethylene diamine to the 5\u2032 phosphate group of nucleic acids. quantum dots, magnetic nanoparticles, and polymeric (latex) particles have found applications in POC diagnostics and are commonly equipped with carboxylates or amines on the surface. nanoparticle detection probes are prepared by the same method as amine-functionalized nucleic acids. thiols react with the maleimide functionality of sulfo-SMCC. thiols react with the maleimide functionality of sulfo-SMCC. photochemical cross-linking and \u201cclick chemistry\u201d have also been used to produce nanoparticle-based detection probes. the most common \u201cclick\u201d reaction is the conjugation of an azide to an alkyne in the presence of a Cu(I) catalyst. the most common method for biotinylating a molecular recognition element is the coupling of sulfo-NHS-biotin or NHS-(PEG)n-biotin to a primary amine. a (PEG)n spacer may be included to optimize for the depth of the streptavidin binding pocket (9 ) and the low relative solubility of biotin. biosensor techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and BLI, can be employed to assess the impact of modification on the binding affinity for the antigen. noble metal nanoparticles display a vivid color that is observable with the naked eye due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) the phenomenon occurs when incoming photons strike the nanoparticle surface and generate a dipole that causes electron oscillations (surface plasmons) with a frequency that resonates with the frequency of the incoming light. PR of AgNPs has been capitalized upon to develop colorimetric assays for infectious disease protein and nucleic acid biomarkers. the use of functionalized AgNPs as colorimetric detection probes has been reported for both protein and nucleic acid biomarkers. such multiplexed diagnostic assays are critical for discriminating between febrile illnesses at the point of care to allow for selection of the appropriate treatment course. TEM images of the silver nanoparticles of increasing size were functionalized with three distinct target-specific antibodies. cross-linking-based AgNP aggregation has yet to be employed in paper diagnostics or other low-resource platforms. in non-cross-linking aggregation assays, nanoparticles are either aggregated or stabilized with molecular recognition elements that electrostatically adsorb to the nanoparticle surface. subsequent addition of a sample containing the diagnostic target then either disrupts or promotes nanoparticle stabilization. the assay successfully detected p24 standard spiked into plasma as well as the p24 present in HIV-positive patient plasma samples. the limit of detection was 10 pg/mL, which is an order of magnitude higher than a previously discussed assay for p24. this discrepancy could be explained by the lack of signal amplification in the fluorescent AgNP immunoassay. QDs demonstrate increased biocompatibility, photostability, quantum yield, and semiconducting properties compared to traditional organic fluorophores. quantitative energy levels of the valence band and conduction band in a quantum dot (semiconductor nanocrystal) the biotin\u2013avidin system was found to be the more simple, reproducible, and robust method for QD bioconjugation of the two. these early works exploited the narrow emission profile and enhanced quantum yield of QDs for antigen detection. each QD barcode particle was covalently bound to a disease-specific antigen via EDC coupling. the detection limits for antibodies correlating to all three diseases were in the picomolar range, which is a 50-fold improvement compared to commercial ELISAs. the detection limits for antibodies correlating to all three diseases were in the picomolar range, which is a 50-fold improvement compared to commercial ELISAs. lateral flow assay used antibody-coated polymeric particles (260.9 nm) and AuNPs (20 nm) for detection of EBOV glycoprotein. dozens of AuNPs adsorbed and hundreds of QDs embedded per every one biomarker. the authors named dual readout nanospheres (RNs) as labels for signal readout. the authors used the LFA to detect either the EBOV glycoprotein or the whole virion spiked into samples. the fluorescent detection was 1\u20132 orders of magnitude more sensitive than 2 commercial brands of rapid tests for EBOV glycoprotein. quantum dots could be incorporated into tests that are readily deployable in primary healthcare settings. the complexity of instrumentation required for detecting quantum dots is often still a barrier to their implementation at the point of care. the potential for continued expansion in multiplexing likely lies with QD-based fluorescent assays. lanthanides are f-block elements; the 4f orbital is gradually filled as the atomic number increases. most common oxidation state for aqueous lanthanide ions is +3.282,283. most of these ions are luminescent, though some lanthanides have greater quantum yields than others. chelating ligands promote luminescence by shielding Eu3+ from aqueous quenching effects. chelating ligands typically absorb in the UV (330\u2013370 nm) and the subsequent Eu3+ emission occurs at 580\u2013690 nm. incubating 50 nm polystyrene particles with Eu3+ chelated with dipicolinic acid derivative ligands resulted in 1000\u20132000 chelates per nanoparticle. this represents a density of approximately 0.02 chelates/nm3. for each biomolecule bound in a lateral flow format, thousands of associated Eu3+ chelates produce a signal, resulting in a highly sensitive measurement. d fluorescence reader found that the detection limits for the Eu3+ chelate-based tests were 25-fold better than those of AuNP-based tests. the developed Eu3+-based tests performed better than commercially available tests detecting influenza A nucleoprotein. 79 this allows for the use of time-resolved measurements in which samples are excited with a pulse of UV light. the short-lived autofluorescence from biological and assay components is excluded from measurements. the unique instrumentation required for time-resolved measurements makes field-deployment technically challenging. the resulting 55 nm nanoparticles contained a remarkable 686000 chelates/particle. this process was repeated five times to achieve a high density of Eu3+ chelates/nm3. these particles were functionalized with oxidized dextran to serve as a hydrophilic linker. chelate-based nanoparticle probes are a promising avenue for developing highly sensitive lateral flow assays. instrumentation remains the primary barrier to implementation of Eu3+ chelate nanoparticles at the point of care. as optical devices are miniaturized, these probes could become commonplace among rapid tests for infectious diseases. the primary mechanisms for up-conversion include excited state absorption, energy transfer, and cooperative sensitization. energy transfer up-conversion requires two ions, a sensitizer and an activator. other up-conversion mechanisms include photon avalanche and cross relaxation. y2O2S:Yb3+, Er3+ requires two resonant energy transfer steps. the blue emission in Y2O2S:Yb3+, Tm3+ involves three phonon-assisted energy transfer steps. UCPs have been used as labels for protein and nucleic acid targets. a trichloroacetic acid extraction is performed on a urine or serum sample. the extract supernatant is then combined with running buffer and anti-CAA-functionalized UCP particles. the test is allowed to develop and must dry completely (at least 3 h) before scanning and analyzing the strip. lateral flow assays have been developed for detection of protein biomarkers for multiple infectious diseases. one disadvantage of highly multiplexed assays on a single strip is the potential increase in cross-reactivity and nonspecific binding. UCP nanoparticles have also been used in nonlateral flow diagnostic formats. these include immunohistochemistry,338 microarrays,339 magnetic bead assays,340,341 and plate immunoassays,309. the ideal POC assay will be optimized to preclude these additional resources. magnetic nanoparticles are emerging as promising labels in POC assays. magnetic nanoparticles can be easily functionalized and possess strong optical absorbance. magnetic properties can also be leveraged for detection, which has advantages over traditional optical detection in a lateral flow format. magnetic nanoparticles are labeled with target-specific molecular recognition elements. they are employed as conjugates for analyte detection. nanoparticles are typically detected on lateral flow assays based on induction. magnetic nanoparticles have been employed as detection labels in lateral flow assays for protein and whole-cell targets. handali et al.349 developed two magnetic particle-based lateral flow assays for detection of Taenia solium, a cestode that is prevalent around the world for which swine are intermediate hosts. the lateral flow assays were evaluated using an induction-based reader and visual reading to detect antibodies in serum samples. it was found that the taeniasis-specific ES33 assay had a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 96%, respectively, when evaluated with the magnetic reader. the assays were not species-specific, they could be used to detect porcine cysticercosis as a marker of disease control and transmission. magnetic particles have been employed in protein-detecting lateral flow assays for HIV360,361 and H1N1 influenza. magnetic particles have been employed in protein-detecting lateral flow assays for HIV360,361 and H1N1 influenza. magnetic particles have been employed in protein-detecting lateral flow assays for HIV360,361 and H1N1 influenza. metalloenzymes used in diagnostics are alkaline phosphatase (ALP), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and catalase. the high catalytic efficiencies of these enzymes enable the rapid conversion of substrate to detectable products. ELISAs are time-consuming (6\u20138 h), require extensive sample handling and solution manipulation. lack of thermal and long-term stability of metalloenzymes in ELISAs can lead to suboptimal assay performance. paper-based ELISAs have been developed for diagnostic markers of HIV and malaria. the time to result for paper-based ELISAs is 1 h due to the comparatively smaller volumes required when contrasted with conventional benchtop ELISAs. the authors used hydrophilic paper that was patterned with hydrophobic photoresist to fabricate 96 test wells that were spatially separated just as in a polystyrene 96-well plate. positive and negative controls were evaluated at various time points for each signal amplification method to determine an optimal window for visual readout of the signal. negative control samples contained HRP2, whereas negative control samples did not. the optimal time window for signal readout could be determined for each method. one method involves vacuum drying or freeze-drying enzymes and substrates in the presence of trehalose. the stabilized HRP could be stored for 5 months at 45 \u00b0C under these conditions without a significant loss in catalytic activity. a glassy carbon electrode was modified with gold nanoparticles to allow for immobilization of anti-p24 capture antibodies. the reaction generated a reductive current proportional to p24 concentration. the detection limit of the assay was 8 pg/mL, similar to the p24 assays153,233 previously discussed. the plasmonic ELISA could detect p24 in HIV-positive serum samples. it could be particularly impactful for early infant HIV diagnosis in low-resource settings. metalloenzymes play a critical role for signal amplification in a number of assays, enabling the sensitive detection of infectious diseases. metalloenzymes play a critical role for signal amplification in a number of assays. integration of signal amplification into point-of-care tests can drastically improve analytical and diagnostic sensitivity, resulting in earlier diagnoses and detection of low-density infections. diagnostics which incorporate novel and user-friendly signal amplification steps could fill a need for elimination campaigns and surveillance programs. antibody-functionalized W\u00fcstite (FeO) particles were used as detection elements in direct, competitive, indirect, and sandwich well-plate assays. nanocrystals (ZnSe, ZnS, CdSe, or CuS) are first functionalized with target-specific molecular recognition elements. nanocrystal cation exchange has yet to be applied in paper-based formats. signal amplification using nanocrystal cation exchange would require precipitating reagent for metal ion detection. nanoparticles can be tuned with particle size, shape, coating, modification, and composition. magnetic nanoparticles have intrinsic peroxidase-like activity, displaying Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. magnetic nanoparticles have been used as signal amplification elements in protein and DNA bioassays for infectious diseases. the nanozyme detection element resulted in at least 100-fold improvement in detection limits compared to traditional gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow strips. the nanoparticle enzyme mimics were directly demonstrated in a stability test in which the activities of lyophilized porous Pt core\u2013shell nanocatalyst conjugate and lyophilized HRP conjugates were measured over time. the optimal HRP lyophilization and storage conditions387,389 discussed in section 4.3.1 were not employed in this study. porous Pt core\u2013shell nanoparticles catalyzed the precipitation of CN/DAB, amplifying visual signal and resulting in improved detection limits and an ultrabroad dynamic range. silver enhancement involves the reduction of silver ions (e.g., silver nitrate) to silver metal on the surface of gold particles in an acidic buffered solution containing hydroquinone. this process is similar to the seeded-growth nanoparticle synthesis method and can result in particles from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers in diameter. a group450 found that silver enhancement improved the detection limits of their Y. pestis test 1000-fold. this procedure is feasible in a district hospital or even a local health outpost with minimal resources. the additional steps required for signal amplification make POC application in a low-resource field setting unlikely. silver enhancement reagents flowed perpendicular to the initial immunochromatographic test over the test and control lines. silver enhancement is the most field-deployable metal-based signal amplification strategy to date. nanoparticles functionalized with target-specific antibodies were added to a biological sample. the nanoparticles functionalized with a low density of target-specific antibodies and a very high density of double-stranded barcode DNA. the nanoparticles that bound the target were separated and then the barcode DNA was detected downstream. the barcode tags were detected in a sandwich hybridization assay on the surface of a glass slide, with gold nanoparticles as the detection elements. signal was further enhanced using reductive silver deposition before the slides were evaluated using image analysis. none of these detection methods can be employed in a field setting. inorganic complexes are valuable as signal generation probes due to their low molecular weight, tunability, and unique catalytic and photophysical properties. each signal generation method has trade-offs with regard to ease-of-use and interpretation, as well as complexity of instrumentation required to measure signal output. cyclometalated d6 complexes of Ir(III) are most commonly used photoluminescent signal generation probes. cyclometalated d6 complexes of Ir(III) are the most commonly used photoluminescent signal generation probes. the cyclometalated Ir(III) complex, [ir(ppy)2(H2O)2]+, was poorly luminescent in the absence of HRP2. however, when aqua ligands were displaced by HRP2\u2019s histidine residues, a biomarker-dependent phosphorescent signal was produced. the protein and activated the 3MLCT/3LC phosphorescent signal pathway. incorporated the Ir(III) probe into an IMAC magnetic bead-based biomarker isolation and detection assay for recombinant HRP2. aptamer bound to its target and liberated the guanine-rich sequence. introduction of K+ ions induced the formation of guanine quadruplexes. aptamer-based assay for HIV biomarker IFN- using a luminescent detection probe. inorganic low-spin d6 complexes of Ir(III) and Ru(II, as well as hemin (Ferriprotoporphyrin IX) have been used in developing electrochemical- and ECL-based probes. inorganic low-spin d6 complexes of Ir(III) and Ru(II, as well as hemin (Ferriprotoporphyrin IX) have been used in developing electrochemical- and E based electrochemical diagnostic platforms,166 often termed microfluidic paper-based electrochemical devices (PEDs)167169 or electrochemical paper analytical devices (ePADs) 170 These tests utilize paper as the assay substrate and have been combined with instrumentation amenable to low-resource settings, such as cell phones, for detection. this would be impactful for disease surveillance or case management, where robust and sensitive diagnostics are needed. hemin is incorporated into a G-quadruplex aptamer. a 3\u2032-thiolated DNA construct was conjugated to a gold working electrode. both aptamers were prehybridized by an 8-nucleotide hairpin. the potential sweep catalyzed

points. ligands provide functional handles for conjugation of molecular recognition elements. signal-generating metal complexes are installed at the connecting points or encapsulated within the network. ligands in these cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (e.g., deprotonated 2-phenylpyridine) demonstrate strong -donor effects. excited electrons preferentially populate the 1MLCT excited state (as opposed to 1MC) the excited electrons then undergo intersystem crossing and subsequently phosphoresce from a mixture of the 3LC (ligand-centered) and 3MLCT excited states. a biomarker-dependent 3MLCT/3LC phosphorescent signal was produced when aqua ligands were displaced by HRP2\u2019s histidine residues. this approach capitalized on the chelation of HRP2\u2019s histidine repeats to the

nanoparticle postfunctionalization is critical to ensuring optimal signal in downstream diagnostic application. these classes of functionalized nanoparticles can be used in developing POC diagnostics for infectious disease. the choice of which depends on the use-case scenario and desired signal output. noble metal nanoparticles are a frequent choice for colorimetric labels in diagnostic assays designed to be interpreted by the naked eye. 177,219,222226 Given the vast literature that exists for AuNP applications, we have elected to focus on the applications of AgNPs as signal generation probes for infectious disease diagnosis. the use of functionalized AgNPs as colorimetric detection probes has been reported for both protein and nucleic acid biomarkers. the authors synthesized 30-, 41-, and 47 nm AgNPs, which were visually detectable as orange, red, and green. each nanoparticle of a particular size was specifically functionalized with a distinct target-specific antibody associated with one of the viruses. 222,227 AgNP aggregation assays are classified as either \u201ccross-linking\u201d or \u201cnon-cross-linking\u201d in cross-linking assays. in cross-linking assays, nanoparticles are either aggregated or stabilized with molecular recognition elements that electrostatically adsorb to the nanoparticle surface. addition of a sample containing the diagnostic target then either disrupts or promotes nanoparticle stabilization. the use of a fluorescent immunoassay in a PAD enabled multiplexed visual detection of three different nucleic acid biomarkers in a format that could be applicable to a primary healthcare setting. however, the fluorescent AgNP immunoassay is not amenable to a resource-limited primary healthcare setting. rystals with luminescent and conductive properties make them advantageous as detection probes in infectious diseases diagnostics. QDs absorb photons, generating excited electrons in the conduction band and positively charged holes in the valence band of the semiconductor. functionalized QDs or QD-loaded microparticles have been used as fluorescent probes for both protein and nucleic acid biomarkers. the surface of QDs can be functionalized with antibodies for protein detection or oligonucleotide probes for target DNA detection. each QD barcode particle was covalently bound to a disease-specific antigen. the assay employed a \u201csandwich\u201d format where disease-specific antibodies were captured by the antigen-functionalized QD barcode particles. a fluorophore-conjugated antihuman antibody was used to detect the presence of a target antibody. the assay enabled multiplexed and sensitive detection of infectious disease biomarkers. the microfluidic platform employed by the authors required extensive user manipulations and complex instrumentation. the biomarker signal and barcode signal are both fluorescence-based, resulting in a multiplexed detection platform. polymeric particles containing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and quantum dots (QDs) were used as labels for signal readout. the authors used the LFA to detect either the EBOV glycoprotein or the whole virion spiked into samples. the fluorescent detection of this assay was 1\u20132 orders of magnitude more sensitive than 2 commercial brands of rapid tests for EBOV glycoprotein. a smartphone adapted hand-held fluorimeter or dedicated fluorescent lateral flow reader could enable measurements at the point of care. nanoparticles doped with lanthanide chelates are advantageous as detection labels owing to their large Stokes shifts, sharp emission peaks, stable luminescence, long fluorescence lifetime. despite this need for additional equipment, these particles are attractive labels for POC diagnostics because they enable highly sensitive biomolecule detection. Eu3+ is the most commonly used lanthanide for labels in lateral flow assays because of its (1) ideal energy gap between the nondegenerate emissive state of 5D0 and the ground state of 7FJ. most excitations involve forbidden electric dipole f-f transitions, which have low absorption cross sections. most lateral flow assays that employ Eu3+ chelates use commercially available particles. majority of commercially available lateral flow labels are 100\u2013300 nm carboxyl- or streptavidin-decorated polystyrene particles. the authors developed and evaluated a panel of 10 H7 subtype-specific monoclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin 1 of H7N9 influenza. the detection limits for the Eu3+ chelate-based tests were 25-fold better than those of AuNP-based tests. the developed Eu3+-based tests performed better than commercially available tests detecting influenza A nucleoprotein. lanthanide chelates overcome these effects because their fluorescence lifetimes are several orders of magnitude longer than conventional fluorescent materials. lanthanide chelates overcome these effects because their fluorescence lifetimes are several orders of magnitude longer than conventional fluorescent materials (microseconds or milliseconds compared to nanoseconds) xia et al.305 developed a lateral flow assay for hepatitis B detection using silica nanoparticles. the resulting 55 nm nanoparticles contained a remarkable 686000 chelates/particle. this process was repeated five times to achieve a high density of Eu3+ chelates/nm3. the detection limit of the LFA was found to be 30 pg/mL HBsAg, 100-fold better than a similarly formatted gold-based lateral flow assay. the developed method represents an innovative tool for diagnosis of hepatitis B and provides sufficient sensitivity when compared to clinical methods. anti-Stokes shift from IR to visible does not occur in nature. this is especially useful for confirming field results in a central laboratory. assays are easily multiplexed; distinct particles absorb at the same IR excitation energy and emit wavelengths defined by the dopant. energy transfer up-conversion is most common up-conversion mechanism for bioassay reporter particles. energy transfer from sensitizer Yb3+ to activator (A) Er3+ and (B) Tm3+. the blue emission in Y2O2S:Yb3+, Tm3+ requires two resonant energy transfer steps. the developed lateral flow assay used 400 nm Y2O2S:Yb3+, Er3+ UCPs. they are excited at 980 nm and emit at 550 nm (green) and can detect CAA for a single Schistosoma worm pair in serum. this assay has been applied to patient samples from endemic areas. corstjens et al.317 added a spin-filter concentration step to the sample preparation method. this allowed for CAA in urine sample volumes of 0.5\u20137.5 mL to be concentrated into 20 L before addition to the lateral flow strip. the additional concentration step increased the cost of this ultrasensitive assay, though sample pooling could make this test more cost-effective. lateral flow assays have multiple test lines, each capturing a distinct protein biomarker. one disadvantage of highly multiplexed assays is the potential increase in cross-reactivity and nonspecific binding that could lead to false-positive results. one disadvantage of highly multiplexed assays on a single strip is the potential increase in cross-reactivity. the most sensitive of these devices are benchtop instruments. portable battery-powered devices have been developed, such as the UCP-modified version of Qiagen\u2019s lateral flow reader. magnetization measurements can be performed regardless of the opacity of the substrate. metal-oxide nanoparticles are highly stable, and drying and aggregation do not influence the intensity of magnetic measurements. there are very few biological or assay components that interfere with magnetic measurements. a magnetic particle-based test is placed above a set of induction coils. in the absence of magnetic particles, the net current induced in the coils is zero. however, when particles are present, the direction of their magnetic moments oscillates with the external magnetic field. a magnetic field is applied to para- or superparamagnetic detection elements in order to align their magnetic moments and produce a fringe field. the gold standard for diagnosis of taeniasis is observation of eggs in stool by microscopy, though this method is insensitive and labor-intensive. there is a pressing need for T. solium rapid diagnostic tests. for each test, one batch of the recombinant antigen was printed at the test line. the developed lateral flow assays are promising alternatives to the current gold standards. assays were not species-specific, they could be used to detect porcine cysticercosis as a marker of disease control and transmission. nanoparticle detection reagents require conjugation of molecular recognition elements to nanoparticle surface. nanoparticle detection reagents must be optimized for a given class and size of nanoparticles. nanoparticle detection reagents can be used for diagnostic applications. sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) ester-activated intermediate readily reacts with primary amine nucleophiles to form stable amide linkages. 188,192 EDC coupling with imidazole enables conjugation of ethylene diamine to the 5\u2032 phosphate group of nucleic acids. quantum dots, magnetic nanoparticles, and polymeric (latex) particles have found applications in POC diagnostics and are commonly equipped with carboxylates or amines on the surface to enable conjugation via EDC coupling. magnetic nanoparticles are coated with carboxylate-containing polymers to enable further functionalization with primary amine-containing biomolecules. antibodies generally do not contain free thiols and either have to be thiolated (often with Traut\u2019s reagent) or cleaved at the interchain disulfides to generate thiols for subsequent bioconjugation to a nanoparticle surface. thiol-containing affinity reagents or nanoparticles can be coupled via a maleimide-derived heterobifunctional cross-linking agent. biotin\u2013streptavidin is a small molecule that binds with an extraordinarily high affinity (KD = 1.3 10\u201315 M) to the bacterial protein streptavidin. streptavidin is added to the nanoparticle surface via passive adsorption or a heterobifunctional cross-linker. UV\u2013visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis) is one of the most commonly used methods for biomolecule-functionalized nanoparticles. characterization techniques have trade-offs with respect to cost, sensitivity, time of analysis, and complexity of sample preparation. simple absorbance-based supernatant assays measure antibody or nucleic acid concentration before and after nanoparticle functionalization reactions give an estimation of the element\u2019s surface density. bioconjugation chemistry for attaching molecular recognition element to a nanoparticle surface is the key component for transforming a nanoparticle with interesting signaling properties into a functional reagent. sulfo-NHS ester-activated intermediate readily reacts with primary amine nucleophiles to form stable amide linkages. 188,192 EDC coupling with imidazole enables conjugation of ethylene diamine to the 5\u2032 phosphate group of nucleic acids, yielding 5\u2032-amine-functionalized oligonucleotides. quantum dots are conventionally stabilized by dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) derivatives or various copolymers that install a carboxylate on the surface. magnetic nanoparticles can be coated with a silica shell derivatized with carboxylate or amine functional groups. silica encapsulation of other nanoparticles provides biocompatibility. coupling of thiolated biomolecules to noble metal nanoparticles is conventionally done via coordinate covalent (dative) bonds. the lone pairs of the sulfur atoms form stable linkages directly to the nanoparticle surface. thiols react with the maleimide functionality of sulfo-SMCC to form stable thioethers. biotin\u2013streptavidin is a small molecule that binds with an extraordinarily high affinity (KD = 1.3 10\u201315 M) to the bacterial protein streptavidin. streptavidin is added to the nanoparticle surface via passive adsorption or a heterobifunctional cross-linker. nanoparticles can be assessed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),209211. functional group characterization on the nanoparticle surface can be evaluated with NMR and/or infrared spectroscopy. characterization of nanoparticle postfunctionalization is critical to ensuring optimal signal in downstream diagnostic application. several classes of functionalized nanoparticles can be used in developing POC diagnostics for infectious disease. noble metal nanoparticles have been a frequent choice for colorimetric labels in diagnostic assays designed to be interpreted by the naked eye. 177,219,222226 Given the vast literature that exists for AuNP applications, we have elected to focus on the applications of AgNPs as signal generation probes. the success of lateral flow assays can be credited to the nanoparticle-based detection systems that allow for visual interpretation of results by the end user. the use of functionalized AgNPs as colorimetric detection probes in paper-based diagnostics for infectious disease has been reported for both protein and nucleic acid biomarkers. colorimetric AgNP aggregation assays also rely on the size-dependence of SPR. when AgNPs aggregate, the decrease in distance between nanoparticles results in interparticle SPR, producing a large red-shift in absorption. a fluorescent immunoassay in a PAD enabled multiplexed visual detection of three different nucleic acid biomarkers in a format that could be applicable to a primary healthcare setting. the assay successfully detected p24 standard spiked into plasma as well as the p24 present in HIV-positive patient plasma samples. quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals with luminescent and conductive properties that make them advantageous as detection probes in infectious diseases diagnostics. QDs absorb photons, generating excited electrons in the conduction band and positively charged holes in the valence band. functionalized QDs or QD-loaded microparticles have been used as fluorescent probes for both protein and nucleic acid biomarkers. the biotin\u2013avidin system was found to be the more simple, reproducible, and robust method for QD bioconjugation of the two. two types of CdSe/ZnS QDs were synthesized and loaded into polystyrene beads at varying ratios. each QD barcode particle was covalently bound to a disease-specific antigen via EDC coupling. a fluorophore-conjugated antihuman antibody was used to detect the presence of a target antibody. limits for antibodies correlating to all three diseases were in the picomolar range, which is a 50-fold improvement compared to commercial ELISAs. the microfluidic platform employed by the authors required extensive user manipulations and complex instrumentation and analysis that would only be viable in higher level healthcare settings. polymeric particles containing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and quantum dots (QDs) were used as labels for signal readout. the authors used the lateral flow assay to detect either the EBOV glycoprotein or the whole virion spiked into samples. the fluorescent detection of this assay was 1\u20132 orders of magnitude more sensitive than 2 commercial brands of rapid tests for EBOV glycoprotein. a smartphone adapted fluorimeter or dedicated fluorescent lateral flow reader could enable measurements at the point of care. lanthanide nanoparticles doped with lanthanide chelates are advantageous as detection labels owing to their large Stokes shifts, sharp emission peaks, stable luminescence, long fluorescence lifetime, and biocompatibility. despite this need for additional equipment, these particles are attractive labels for POC diagnostics. Eu3+ is the most commonly used lanthanide for labels in lateral flow assays because of its (1) ideal energy gap between the nondegenerate emissive state of 5D0 and the ground state of 7FJ and (2) convenient emission in the visible region. most excitations involve forbidden electric dipole f-f transitions, which have low absorption cross sections. chelate dyes are incorporated into nanoparticles functionalized with target-specific molecular recognition elements for use in lateral flow assays. most commercially available lateral flow labels are 100\u2013300 nm carboxyl- or streptavidin-decorated polystyrene particles. this represents a density of approximately 0.02 chelates/nm3. chelate-loaded polystyrene nanoparticles as labels for lateral flow assays were demonstrated by Yeo et al.,289 who developed a sensitive lateral flow assay for the detection of avian influenza. these viruses can be highly pathogenic; for a 2013 H7N9 outbreak in china, a mortality rate of roughly 36% was estimated for hospital patients with laboratory-confirmed infections. lanthanide chelates overcome these effects because their fluorescence lifetimes are several orders of magnitude longer than conventional fluorescent materials. lanthanide chelates overcome these effects because their fluorescence lifetimes are several orders of magnitude longer than conventional fluorescent materials (microseconds or milliseconds compared to nanoseconds) polymeric Eu3+ chelate nanoparticles are the primary materials employed by lanthanide-labeled lateral flow assays. these particles present some disadvantages. their large size and tendency to swell can cause aggregation in aqueous solutions. a traditionally formatted lateral flow assay for HBsAg was used to measure signal. the detection limit of the LFA was found to be 30 pg/mL HBsAg. however, even without time-resolved measurements, the detection limit was found to be 100-fold better than a similarly formatted gold-based lateral flow assay. the high anti-Stokes shift from IR to visible does not occur in nature. the inherent autofluorescence typically associated with biological samples does not interfere with UCP measurements. this is especially useful for confirming field results in a central laboratory. energy transfer from sensitizer Yb3+ to activator (A) Er3+ and (B) Tm3+. the blue emission in Y2O2S:Yb3+, Tm3+ requires two resonant energy transfer steps. the developed lateral flow assay used 400 nm Y2O2S:Yb3+, Er3+ UCPs. they are excited at 980 nm and emit at 550 nm (green) and can detect CAA for a single Schistosoma worm pair in serum. this assay has been applied to patient samples from endemic areas. corstjens et al.317 added a spin-filter concentration step to the sample preparation method. this allowed for CAA in urine sample volumes of 0.5\u20137.5 mL to be concentrated into 20 L before addition to the lateral flow strip. the detection limits improved as sample volume increased, reaching as low as 0.03 pg/mL. multiplexed diagnostics typically consist of one strip with multiple test lines, each capturing a distinct protein biomarker. one disadvantage of highly multiplexed assays is the potential increase in cross-reactivity and nonspecific binding that could lead to false-positive results. lateral flow assays require at least 3 h of drying time after the lateral flow assay has developed, a long time-to-result for a point-of-care test. the most sensitive devices are benchtop instruments, but portable battery-powered devices have been developed. magnetic nanoparticles are 100\u2013200 m thick, so optical detection only allows for signal from the top 10% of the membrane to be measured. magnetic nanoparticles are highly stable, and drying and aggregation do not influence the intensity of magnetic measurements. a magnetic particle-based test is placed in an oscillating magnetic field above a set of induction coils. in the absence of magnetic particles, the net current induced in the coils is zero. however, when particles are present, the direction of their magnetic moments oscillates with the external magnetic field, resulting in a measurable net voltage induced across the coils. neurocysticercosis is a leading cause of epilepsy worldwide. diagnosis requires CT scans of the brain, a technology that is unavailable in low-resource settings. there is a pressing need for rapid diagnostic tests. the developed lateral flow assays are promising alternatives to the current gold standards. the assays were not species-specific, they could be used to detect porcine cysticercosis as a marker of disease control and transmission. metalloenzymes are metal-containing catalytic proteins in which the presence of particular metals or metal complexes in the tertiary structure is critical to the catalytic turnover of the substrate. metalloenzymes can be conjugated to antibodies or nucleic acids that afford specificity for a target biomarker. the conventional substrates for ALP in point-of-care diagnostic applications are BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate) and NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium), where dephosphorylation and oxidation of BCIP allows for reduction of yellow NBT dye to a blue/purple formazan precipitate. ELISAs are time-consuming (6\u20138 h), require extensive sample handling and solution manipulation. lack of thermal and long-term stability of metalloenzymes in ELISAs can lead to suboptimal assay performance. investigators have begun to use paper as the ELISA solid support. the sensitivity of the paper-based ELISA was decreased by an order of magnitude compared to the conventional ELISA format. lathwal and Sikes383 conducted a systematic investigation of several signal amplification methods for paper-based colorimetric detection of malarial biomarker HRP2. positive and negative controls were evaluated at various time points for each signal amplification method. metalloenzyme\u2013substrate combinations (HRP-DAB/H2O2 and ALP-BCIP/NBT) had detection limits an order of magnitude better than Ag deposition and polymerization-based amplification methods when quantified by RGB color intensity. the advantages of paper-based ELISAs are potentially compromised by the instability of metalloenzyme conjugates. a 2DPN for detection of HRP2 with a LOD of 6.5 ng/mL. this assay also demonstrated the utility of metalloenzymes in paper-based diagnostics. advances in enzyme stabilization combined with simplified paper-based assay formats could potentially allow for ELISA sensitivity to be translated for direct use. amperometric method demonstrated the value of integrating noble metal nanoparticles with metalloenzyme conjugates for signal amplification in diagnosis of infectious diseases. plasmonic ELISAs employ the enzyme as a kinetic tool for nanoparticle nucleation. this causes drastic shifts in the absorbance spectra of the nanoparticles that are detectable with the naked eye. the plasmonic ELISA could detect p24 in HIV-positive serum samples, even identifying p24 in samples from HIV-positive patients with viral loads less than 50 copies/mL. the assay could be particularly impactful for the challenges associated with early infant HIV diagnosis in low-resource settings. ELISAs (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays) Metalloenzyme-antibody conjugates have been widely implemented in ELISAs for the detection of protein biomarkers for disease. this is due to the sensitivity afforded by the use of enzymes for signal amplification as well as the specificity of the antibody\u2013antigen interactions. paper-based ELISAs have been developed for detection of diagnostic markers of HIV and malaria. the time to result for paper-based ELISAs is 1 h due to the comparatively smaller volumes required when contrasted with conventional benchtop ELISAs. yde-modified cellulose for all experiments, and the following detection systems were evaluated. positive and negative controls were evaluated at various time points for each signal amplification method to determine an optimal window for visual readout of the signal. negative control samples contained HRP2, while negative controls showed no detectable signal. the advantages of paper-based ELISAs are potentially compromised by the instability of metalloenzyme conjugates. the advantages of paper-based ELISAs are potentially compromised by the instability of metalloenzyme conjugates, since denaturation of metalloenzymes leads to poor turnover of substrate and lower sensitivities. nanoparticles have served as surfaces for coupling of antibody-metalloenzyme conjugates. they have been implemented in electrochemical sensors for detection of infectious disease-associated protein biomarkers. plasmonic ELISAs employ the enzyme as a kinetic tool for nanoparticle nucleation. this causes drastic shifts in SPR and in the absorbance spectra of the nanoparticles that are detectable with the naked eye. the plasmonic ELISA presented by the authors still calls for extensive sample handling and user manipulation. Adaptation of the previously discussed enzyme stabilization measures could enable its translation to an ultrasensitive field-ready diagnostic for HIV detection. metal nanoparticle dissolution, nanocrystal ion exchange, enzyme mimics, and reductive nanoparticle enlargement have been developed. amplification often requires additional steps to be integrated into point-of-care test workflow, and (2) incorporation into a paper-based format can be technically challenging. tong et al.405 exploited ferrous ion-chelating ferrozine in an iron oxide nanoparticle-linked immunosorbent assay. antibody-functionalized W\u00fcstite (FeO) particles were used as detection elements in direct, competitive, indirect, and sandwich well-plate assays. nanocrystals (ZnSe, ZnS, CdSe, or CuS) are first functionalized with target-specific molecular recognition elements. each bound nanocrystal releases thousands of Zn2+, Cd2+, or Cu2+ ions. these reactions produce an amplified, stoichiometric signal. nanomaterial-based artificial enzymes are highly stable toward a range of temperatures and pHs and cannot be degraded by proteases. catalytic activity of inorganic nanoparticles can be tuned with particle size, shape, coating, modification, and composition. nanozymes have been incorporated into a myriad of sensors for various applications. nanoparticles have been used as enzyme mimics in bioassays for targets such as respiratory syncytial virus,432 avian influenza,431 hepatitis C and HIV,428 and Staphylococcus aureus. many of the assays that utilize nanozymes as catalytic turnover reagents for detection are formatted similarly to immunoassays on well plates. nanoparticle enzyme mimics were directly demonstrated in a stability test in which the activities of lyophilized porous Pt core\u2013shell nanocatalyst conjugate and lyophilized HRP conjugates were measured over time. the nanocatalysts maintained 100% of their initial activity while stored at room temperature and nearly 80% of their initial activity while stored at 44 \u00b0C for up to 42 days. silver enhancement can be detected either visually (without optical equipment) or using simple hand-held readers. a lateral flow assay is run in the typical manner such that, if the antigen is present, a gold nanoparticle-containing sandwich complex is formed at the test line. a molecular precursor and reducing agent is added to the test line. silver enhancement has successfully improved the detection of many infectious diseases by several orders of magnitude, including influenza,439,442 HIV,443 malaria,444449Y. pestis,450 and E. coli. 2DPNs rely on paper geometry or embedded paper-fluidic valves to enable programmed, electricity-free delivery of silver enhancement reagents to the assay test line. these 2DPNs simply require the addition of sample and buffer to pads that have been preloaded with assay reagents, mirroring the same number of steps required to run a traditional lateral flow assay. bio-barcodes The amplification methods discussed thus far increase the number of signaling elements after the initial assay has developed. the biobarcode method was initially applied to the detection of proteins, but has also been applied to nucleic acid detection. the biobarcode assay format suffers from two major drawbacks. the high number of user steps required before the barcode tags are released for detection makes it extremely difficult to adapt to a low-resource format. low-resource detection of nucleic acid tags remains a challenge. significant advances have been made in developing metalloenzyme- and metal nanoparticle-based signal amplification strategies for infectious disease diagnosis. however, even those that employ paper substrates or lateral flow formats, require too many user steps before the signal is generated. most of the assays discussed were heavily reliant on benchtop, laboratory-based instrumentation for signal readout. tong et al.405 exploited ferrous ion-chelating ferrozine in an iron oxide nanoparticle-linked immunosorbent assay. antibody-functionalized W\u00fcstite (FeO) particles were used as detection elements in direct, competitive, indirect, and sandwich well-plate assays. nanocrystals (ZnSe, ZnS, CdSe, or CuS) are first functionalized with target-specific molecular recognition elements, such as antibodies or aptamers, which are used as detection probes. each bound nanocrystal releases thousands of Zn2+, Cd2+, or Cu2+ ions. nanomaterial-based artificial enzymes are highly stable toward a range of temperatures and pHs and cannot be degraded by proteases. catalytic activity of inorganic nanoparticles can be tuned with particle size, shape, coating, modification, and composition. nanozymes have been incorporated into a myriad of sensors for various applications. nanoparticles have been used as enzyme mimics in bioassays for targets such as respiratory syncytial virus,432 avian influenza A,426Salmonella, and E. coli. many of the assays that utilize nanozymes as catalytic turnover reagents for detection are formatted similarly to immunoassays on well plates. lyophilized porous Pt core\u2013shell nanocatalyst conjugates lost nearly all activity after 15 days of storage at room temperature. nanocatalysts maintained 100% of their initial activity while stored at room temperature and nearly 80% of their initial activity while stored at 44 \u00b0C for up to 42 days. the detection limits of these assays are not low enough to diagnose low-density infections. a lateral flow assay is run in the typical manner such that, if the antigen is present, a gold nanoparticle-containing sandwich complex is formed at the test line. the gold nanoparticles at the test line serve as nucleation sites for solid metal deposition. silver enhancement has successfully improved the detection of many infectious diseases by several orders of magnitude, including influenza,439,442 HIV,443 malaria,444449Y. pestis,450 and E. coli. silver enhancement is feasible in a district hospital or even a local health outpost with minimal resources. 2DPNs rely on paper geometry or embedded paper-fluidic valves to enable programmed, electricity-free delivery of silver enhancement reagents to the assay test line. these 2DPNs simply require the addition of sample and buffer to pads that have been preloaded with assay reagents. silver enhancement is the most field-deployable metal-based signal amplification strategy to date. bio-barcodes The amplification methods discussed thus far increase the number of signaling elements after the initial assay has developed. the biobarcode method was initially applied to the detection of proteins, but has also been applied to nucleic acid detection. the biobarcode assay format suffers from two major drawbacks. the high number of user steps required before the barcode tags are released for detection makes it extremely difficult to adapt to a low-resource format. low-resource detection of nucleic acid tags remains a challenge. significant advances have been made in developing metalloenzyme- and metal nanoparticle-based signal amplification strategies for infectious disease diagnosis. most of the assays discussed, even those that employ paper substrates or lateral flow formats, require too many user steps before the signal is generated. eliminates the possibility of \u201cequipment-free\u201d tests (E in ASSURED criteria) and reduces the \u201caffordable\u201d nature of simple tests (A in ASSURED criteria) however, the potential benefits of instrumentation, including improved sensitivity and reduced bias, will outweigh these disadvantages. laboratory standard not specified laptop not specified software-based imaging analysis mLAB

$1000\u201310000 (based on quantity and options) microscopy can be a useful diagnostic tool, but results depend strongly on infection intensities, sample preparation methods, and the training level of the microscopist. many groups are developing portable, affordable, and easy-to-use microscopy tools suitable for low-resource settings. many similarly portable and lightweight microscopes have been developed, including tomographic,482 holographic,483 wide-field,484 and fluorescence486 microscopes. some impressively weighing in at less than 200 g.479,482484 These microscopes have been applied. 488 Assembled using origami, the Foldscope is constructed from flat paper, copper tape, a button-cell battery, an LED, polymer filters, and a ball lens. the entire device costs less than $1, can achieve magnification up to 2180, and was shown to be capable of detecting Giardia lamblia, Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi, E. coli, and Schistosoma hematobium eggs the LoaScope is a smartphone-based device that combines video microscopy and automated software with onboard quantitative detection based on the movements of filarial parasite Loa loa in whole blood. an application downloaded to the smartphone is used for stage control, video capture, image analysis, and data reporting of quantitative L. loa microfilaria densities. the LoaScope enabled ivermectin delivery to 15522 participants that otherwise would not have received treatment for onchocerciasis. despite the fact that many mobile phone-based microscopes lack the analytical and diagnostic sensitivity of conventional microscopes, it is unclear to what extent this device could detect low-burden infections. primary optical components include a light source (LED or laser) and photodiode. a photodiode detects reflectance or emission depending on colorimetric or fluorescent labels. confocal systems are slightly more tolerant to small variations along the z axis, depending on the size of the pinhole aperture. even slight variations off the focal plane can drastically decrease the number of photons reaching the photodiode, altering the quantitative output. a point of incident light only covers 10\u201320% of the test and control lines. image adapted with permission from ref (507). lateral flow assays enable facile data aggregation and communication. imaging-based readers greatly reduce the optical equipment required for quantifying lateral flow assays. mobile phones have been used to quantify lateral flow assays for numerous diseases, including malaria,511514 HIV,511 and tuberculosis.511 Similar to commercially available imaging-based readers, many required external devices to ensure consistent illumination and distance from the camera. the embedded barcode is either static, providing useful information about the brand, lot, and patient ID, or dynamic, producing a positive/negative read-out. the QR code functioned as a flow control, appearing on both positive and negative tests, but not invalid tests. the TRI-Analyzer is a trimodal smartphone attachment capable of measuring transmission, reflection, and emission intensities. it leveraged white light from the smartphone\u2019s rear-facing flash LED or an integrated green laser diode for sample illumination via optical fibers. the device could detect analytes at lower concentrations than those detected using conventional laboratory instrumentation. 517,518 surface plasmon resonance sensors,519521 and flow cytometers522,523 have also been developed. thermal readers Noble metal nanoparticles have extremely high molar absorptivities. this intense absorbance occurs when particles are excited with light that matches the resonant oscillation of their free electrons. the group developed a reader that incorporated a green laser, infrared camera, and automated control system into a benchtop box device. the study demonstrated the utility and versatility of thermal contrast as a method for quantification of lateral flow assays from a variety of vendors. the high sensitivity of SERS detection makes it an attractive detection platform for infectious disease diagnostics. many laboratory-based bioassays for protein, nucleic acid, and whole-cell biomarkers have been developed for a myriad of infectious diseases. magnetic Detection Magnetic nanoparticles possess advantages over optical lateral flow labels because their signal is rarely hindered by test opacity or biological interferents. the current iteration of the MagnaBioSciences reader is a relatively large benchtop device that is unsuitable for use in low-resource settings. lateral flow assay readers are being developed using magnetoresistive sensors. these devices are based on the principle that the electrical resistance of certain materials can change upon application of an external magnetic field. the most common are giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors. electrochemical detection offers several benefits for POC infectious disease detection. the system previously discussed was proof-of-concept diagnostics for detection of protein or nucleic acid biomarkers. it is inexpensive, sensitive, rapid, and quantitative. 556 Xiang and Lu558 developed a platform that used a personal glucose meter for signal output to detect protein (IFN-), nucleic acid (adenosine), small molecule (cocaine) or toxic ion (uranium) targets. the aptamer was prehybridized to a partially complementary DNA strand that was linked to invertase. the Lu group562 has integrated this solution-based assay into a lateral flow strip with dried reagents, eliminating several user steps and further simplifying the platform. uMED combined a potentiostat with virtually any mobile phone using audio-based data transmission. the uMED used the potentiostat to detect blood glucose, heavy metals in water, electrolytes, and malarial biomarker HRP2. the remote application then extracted the value from the audio data and sent an SMS message back to the user with additional diagnostic information (e.g., \u201cLOW\u201d if the reported blood glucose level was low) wearable instruments combine sample collection, sample preparation, analysis and readout, and data transmission into one device. new biomarkers of infectious diseases are discovered in surface biofluids such as sweat. anti-HRP2-functionalized MPAs detected the biomarker. anti-IgG-functionalized MPAs acted as a positive control for skin penetration. antidengue-functionalized MPAs served as a negative control. images of tests were sent to a secure server to be analyzed. results and analysis were then sent back to the viewer's eyepiece. this method has been demonstrated using rapid diagnostic tests for both HIV antibodies and prostate specific antigen (PSA),515. microscopy conventional microscopy remains the gold standard diagnostic technique for many infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and intestinal protozoa. a variety of microscopic techniques, such as bright field, dark field, and fluorescence microscopy, are used for direct inspection of stained or unstained smears. the diagnostic utility of the microscope was demonstrated in a small field trial for detection of M. tuberculosis. results from the Global Focus microscope and a laboratory-grade fluorescence microscope were in agreement for 98.4% of cases. many similarly portable and lightweight microscopes have been developed. the Foldscope is an example of a low-resource microscope that most embodies the ASSURED criteria. it is constructed from flat paper, copper tape, a button-cell battery, an LED, polymer filters, and a ball lens. the entire device costs less than $1, can achieve magnification up to 2180. the LoaScope is a smartphone-based device that combines video microscopy and automated software with quantitative detection based on the movements of filarial parasite Loa loa in whole blood. the device was validated in a field setting and yielded results similar to those of thick smears. each patient was screened for L. loa burden using the LoaScope. those with high counts were not given ivermectin but were treated for L. loa with albendazole. this is striking example of mobile phone-based microscopy in the field. optical readers have been developed and commercialized to provide rapid, objective, and quantitative measurements of signal on lateral flow assays. optical readers include a light source (LED or laser) and photodiode. optical readers can be grouped into two categories: (1) optomechanical scanning and (2) imaging. light returning from the strip passes through an aperture that excludes rays that were not directly from the focal point. both specular and confocal scanning configurations are sensitive to the z position of the lateral flow strip. a point of incident light only covers 10\u201320% of the test and control lines. phosphor-based schistosomiasis lateral flow assays require consideration of both portability and sensitivity. image analysis software can identify and correct for nonuniform signal, allowing for analysis of the full test line. mobile phones have been used for quantification of malaria, 507510 dengue,509Burkholderia pseudomallei,509 and Y. pestis lateral flow assays. mobile phones have been used to quantify lateral flow assays for numerous diseases, including malaria,511514 HIV,511. one option is to embed quick response codes into the lateral flow test. the embedded barcode is either static, providing useful information about the brand, lot, and patient ID, or dynamic, producing a positive/negative read-out. abled Optical Measurements Mobile phones have been adapted for optical measurements beyond lateral flow quantification. one example is the mobile phone-based, hand-held microplate reader developed by Berg et al.382. the device consists of a 3D-printed attachment in which an LED array illuminates each well, and the transmitted light is collected via 96 individual optical fibers. microscopy is the gold standard diagnostic technique for many infectious diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and intestinal protozoa. microscopy can be a useful diagnostic tool, but results depend strongly on infection intensities, sample preparation methods, and the training level of the microscopist. portable, low-cost, LED-based fluorescent microscope (Global Focus microscope) weighing just 1 kg and powered by two AA batteries. the diagnostic utility of the microscope was demonstrated in a small field trial for detection of M. tuberculosis. the Foldscope is constructed from flat paper, copper tape, a button-cell battery, an LED, polymer filters, and a ball lens. the entire device costs less than $1, can achieve magnification up to 2180. the entire device costs less than $1, can achieve magnification up to 2180. mobile phone-based microscopy has emerged as a potential alternative to conventional microscopes for infectious disease diagnostics. these devices have been applied to the detection of a myriad of infectious diseases, including malaria,491,492 tuberculosis,492 schistosomiasis,493,494 human papillomavirus (HPV),495 soil-transmitted helminths,496 filarial diseases,497,498 and intestinal protozoa rapid, point-of-care measurement of L. loa infection intensity could allow for these elimination campaigns to resume. each patient was screened for L. loa burden using the LoaScope. those with high counts were not given ivermectin but were treated for L. loa. optical readers have been developed and commercialized to provide rapid, objective, and quantitative measurements of signal on lateral flow assays. the primary optical components include a light source (LED or laser) and photodiode. lateral flow assays currently remain the most field-friendly format for infectious disease diagnosis. the photodiode is positioned so that it collects light that is reflected from the test at the same angle as the incident light from the source. a point of incident light only covers 10\u201320% of the test and control lines. portable commercial reader, the UCP-Quant (Qiagen), was at least an order of magnitude less sensitive than a custom-modified benchtop reader for evaluating upconverting phosphor-based schistosomiasis lateral flow assays. however, selecting a scanning lateral flow strip reader for a particular application requires consideration of both portability and sensitivity. image analysis software can identify and correct for nonuniform signal. many camera-based lateral flow readers include housing units for run-to-run consistency. mobile phones have been used to quantify lateral flow assays for malaria,511514 HIV,511 and tuberculosis. mobile phones are incorporated into low-resource diagnostic workflows. it is important to ask whether the conventional lateral flow format can be redesigned to take full advantage of potential benefits smartphones can offer. optical lateral flow readers may detect test lines invisible to the human eye. but readers alone will not replace the need for ultrasensitive lateral flow tests. mobile phones have been adapted for optical measurements beyond lateral flow quantification. the optical fibers collected light transmitted through or emitted from the sample or light reflected from a photonic crystal biosensor. the intensity at each wavelength was determined by the integration of pixel intensity at the corresponding position along the sensor. this clever detection strategy allowed for full absorbance and emission spectra to be collected with a simple smartphone-based device. lateral flow quantification based on the thermal contrast of gold nanoparticles. a high-powered green laser was used to excite the gold nanoparticles. an infrared-detecting camera was employed to measure the resulting thermal contrast. thermal contrast is a highly sensitive vibrational spectroscopy technique for structure-based analyte detection. the high sensitivity of SERS makes it an attractive detection platform for infectious disease diagnostics, particularly for low-density infections. nanoparticles provide the plasmonic surface for Raman signal enhancement. nanoparticles are typically gold, silver, or Au@Ag particles. nanoparticles are typically gold, silver, or Au@Ag particles. lateral flow assay readers are placed inside an oscillating magnetic field on a set of induction coils. the instrument measures the induced electromotive force (V) on the coils. assays quantified by this technology generally had a greater sensitivity compared to visual detection. magnetic nanoparticles can potentially be applied to different use-case scenarios with different sensitivity requirements. sensitivity of magnetic detection on lateral flow assays makes this technique attractive for infectious disease diagnosis. the blood glucose biosensor is a remarkably successful electrochemical device that is ubiquitously applied at the point of care. the test strips house an electrochemical cell that contains a counter-reference electrode, fill-detection electrode, enzyme-coated working electrode, and mediators. in these devices, the working electrode is coated with the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) or glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) Xiang and Lu558 developed a platform that used a personal glucose meter for signal output to detect protein (IFN-), nucleic acid (adenosine), small molecule (cocaine) targets. their strategy employed a magnetic bead-conjugated aptamer specific for the biomarker of interest. the aptamer was prehybridized to a partially complementary DNA strand that was linked to invertase. uMED combined a potentiostat with virtually any mobile phone using audio-based data transmission. the device could accommodate several electrochemical techniques (amperometry, coulometry, voltammetry, and potentiometry), and the voice system-based data ensured broad compatibility with a variety of mobile phones. the success of the personal glucose meter is a testament to the effective and reliable diagnostic performance that is possible with electrochemical measurements. \u201cconnected\u201d electrochemical diagnostics could serve as the link between the chemistries utilized at the point of care and the remote higher level healthcare systems that map disease trends. paper surgical mask with embedded electrical sensor for monitoring respiration. Adapted with permission from ref (568). lateral flow assay analysis combined visual examination of a lateral flow test with computerized image analysis and wireless storage capability. this technique has been demonstrated using rapid diagnostic tests for both HIV antibodies and prostate specific antigen (PSA),515 though it has the potential to be adapted for any lateral flow assay. wearable diagnostics are becoming commonplace in health-related research efforts. the development of wearable diagnostic technologies could drastically improve the simplicity of diagnostic measurements and interpretation in regions with little or no laboratory infrastructure. this could drastically improve the simplicity of diagnostic measurements and interpretation in regions with little or no laboratory infrastructure. many metal-containing nanoparticle probes have been functionalized to detect pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences in a variety of formats. the size-dependence of SPR for noble-metal nanoparticles has been leveraged in an aggregation assay for multiplexed detection of M. tuberculosis and HIV. isothermal enzymatic amplification techniques have demonstrated the most sensitivity and promise for point-of-care diagnostic applications. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), multiple displacement amplification (MDA), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) the device relies on an exothermal chemical reaction (MgFe powder, saline, and oxygen) coupled to a phase change material for prolonged and precise heating inside a Thermos cup. 589,601 Despite its streamlined workflow, the device does not account for sample preparation. the all-in-one paper-based nucleic acid test is a perfect example of how target extraction and amplification can be combined with metal-based detection elements. this integration will allow for complex nucleic acid detection protocols to be performed at the point of care that previously were only possible in well-equipped laboratories. this integration will allow for sensitive and information-rich nucleic acid detection in low resource settings. the need for more sensitive diagnostics likely outweighs small increases in test complexity or cost for elimination campaigns. noble metal nanoparticles have often been incorporated into paper-based assays with visual signal readout because of their stability and superior molar absorptivities. quantum dots, lanthanide chelate-doped nanoparticles, and up-converting phosphor nanoparticles all offer improvements in sensitivity over colorimetric labels. quantum dots, lanthanide chelate-doped nanoparticles, and up-converting phosphor nanoparticles all offer improvements in sensitivity over colorimetric labels. new technology must be clinically validated on a large set of patient samples from endemic regions before implementation. this rigor can draw attention to challenges and weaknesses that would otherwise go unnoticed in a research laboratory setting. metal-based point-of-care diagnostic strategies could have a profound impact on global health. if some of the ultrasensitive p24 detection methods were adapted for use at primary healthcare facilities, the time to result for infant HIV diagnosis at the point of need would be significantly reduced."}
