{"summary": "dendritic cells (DCs) are specialised cells responsible for sampling antigens and presenting them to T cells. non-coding RNAs may regulate the functional program of DCs. expression of host non-coding RNAs changes markedly during infectious bronchitis virus infection. study identified 2 TF-microRNA and 53 TF\u2013microRNA interactions involving 1 TF, 2 miRNAs, and 53 mRNAs in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. cis and trans target gene of differentially expressed miRNAs in IBV-stimulated avian BMDCs and their GO and KEEG analysis. GO and KEEG analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs target in avian BMDCs. lncRNAs target in IBV-stimulated avian BMDCs."}
