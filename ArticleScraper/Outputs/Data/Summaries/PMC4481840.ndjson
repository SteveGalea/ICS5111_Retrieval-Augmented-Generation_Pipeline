{"summary": "each population of RNA virus is composed of a collection of different, yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispecies. this genotypic diversity is the result of the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which surpasses that of DNA organisms by orders of magnitude. this intrinsic high error rate is largely attributed to the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases that replicate their genomes. limitations of this method include low resolution and ability to detect only highly abundant variants in a given population. individual viruses can be isolated and amplified (biological clones) or RT-PCR amplicons of the whole population can be subcloned into individual plasmids (molecular clones) researchers have begun characterizing the intra-host and intra-strain virus diversity and population dynamics for a variety of viruses of clinical or agricultural relevance. some studies addressed the temporal evolution of variants, the pre-existing presence of drug resistant mutants and the dynamics and emergence of escape mutations in the presence of various types of pressure. virologists using HTS technologies for the purpose of rare variant detection face major obstacles when studying virus population dynamics. these methods can be split into two main categories. the first increases variant detection fidelity by modulating the library preparation step. Schmitt et al. tag and compare both strands of a DNA segment. ViVan is a complete pipeline to facilitate the identification, characterization and comparison of sequence variance in deep sequenced virus populations. the aforementioned tools focus on accurate variant detection and do not facilitate any downstream analysis and interpretation. the analysis starts with raw sequence reads output by deep sequencing of a virus population sample. raw reads undergo quality trimming where low quality bases are removed from both ends of the read. the pileup output is then analyzed, true variants are identified, variant frequencies are modified and confidence intervals calculated. the frequency of variants detected only by one replicate is higher than expected in the other un-detected samples. for each NRV we counted the number of times its frequency is higher than the other non-reference, non-variant alleles in each replicate. the probability of observing a minor allele is given by: P ( y i = 1 ; f ) = f ( 1 p i ) + ( 1 f ) p i. the probability of observing a reference allele is: P ( y i = 0 ; f ) = 1 P ( y i = 1 ; f ) variation rate at position i is defined as the proportion (F) of significant non-reference alleles (k) and is denoted Vi The region-wide variation rate is the averaged variation rate across all covered positions in the region (denoted n) we determine false negative as the reason of non-reproducibility. 2.3 Measuring diversity of viral fidelity variants The production and generation of DS libraries of passage 3 low fidelity variants is described previously. the optimum of the log-likelihood function has no closed form expression. the function can be effectively optimized numerically to find its maximizer. we can then construct a 1 confidence set using Wilks\u2019 theorem: p. v. = 1 F X 1 2. the region-wide variation rate is the averaged variation rate across all covered positions in the region (denoted n) simulated dengue virus (DENV) population composed of 10 different in-silico generated haplotypes in varying rates (0.1\u201350%) and varying coverage levels (50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10 000) the PPV cost of such an increase in sensitivity was found to be minor. pileup\u2019s PPV ranged from 0.376 0.022 in 50 to 0.066 0.00003 in 10 000. variants identified in positions that differ from reference in any of the six virus strains composing the simulated population were considered true variants. ViVan demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity across coverage levels with only a minor cost in PPV. SAMtools pileup\u2019s decline in F1-score is the result of a decrease in PPV. the coverage in this data set was low (100) but ViVan demonstrated the highest sensitivity out of the three methods, identifying all but one of the variants found in the other. a coverage increase should compare ViVan\u2019s PPV to the other methods\u2019 while maintaining higher sensitivity. the majority of the replicates showed a higher frequency than expected in the disagreeing replicates. this suggests that ViVan maintains high reproducibility (88.4%) even in low variant rates, given sufficient coverage. the high error rate of the technology might prove too great to distinguish between subtle differences in the genetic diversity of populations. ViVan generated more conservative mutation profiles. the naturally high mutation frequencies of these viruses confer susceptibility to conditions that further increase mutation rates above a maximum threshold. this increased mutation rate may result in extinction, also termed lethal mutagenesis. ribavirin (R, 400 M), 5-azacytidine (AZC, 300 M) and 5-fluorouracil (FU, 150 M) each base analog is known to induce different types of mutations, with biases that can be considered genetic signatures of treatment. untreated sample revealed that transition mutations are more common than transversions, as expected. FU treatment revealed the most commonly induced mutations to be the expected U to C and A to G transitions. the ribavirin treated population also presents the expected G to A and C to U transitions with the highest frequencies. we compared a CVB3 sample without treatment with infected samples treated with three concentrations of ribavirin (100, 200 and 400 M) we Applied ViVan on three sequenced samples: the initial virus population (stock virus); following seven passages in HeLa cells (p7 HeLa); and after alternating passages between HeLa cells and mosquito C6/36 cells (p7 alt). the stock virus had a total of 305 minority variants. this diversity increased to 443 after serial passage in HeLa cells, and 419 when alternating between HeLa and C6 cells. alternating passage sample that had cycled through mosquito cells was not found in any of the other samples above a rate of 0.001. Interestingly, only nine variants had frequencies above 1% of the total population. the variant exhibiting the highest rate (62%), was an aspargine to lysine change, position 112 of the non-structural protein 4 (nsp4) variants were found only in the alternating passages positions. the viral polymerase protein (nsp4) showed a high variant allele rate. this suggests functional relevance for survival in alternating host passages. the high fidelity A372V variant and the low fidelity S299T variant maintained lower and higher diversity throughout the 120 replication cycles and in all triplicate series. we then asked which variants specifically demonstrated a constant increase in rate, as passages progressed, that could be indicative of positive selection. samples Virus variants VP3 204 A > V 8 WT 372 299 VP4 17 N > D 6 WT 372 299 VP4 20 G > S 6 WT 372 299 3D 452 S > P 6 WT 372 299 3B 6 V > L 5 WT 372 VP4 21 N > G 4 372 299 2B 11 N > D 4 372 299 VP4 23 I > T 4 372 299. in all three WT populations with an average rate of 37% at passage 120. these observations suggest that viral populations may fine tune their mutation rates during their infection cycles by fine tuning their mutation rates. viral populations may fine tune their mutation rates during their infection cycles by generating mixed populations of fidelity variants. these observations suggest that viral populations may fine tune their mutation rates during their infection cycles by generating mixed populations of fidelity variants. the PPV cost of such an increase in sensitivity was found to be minor and significant only in low coverage levels. pileup\u2019s PPV ranged from 0.376 0.022 in 50 to 0.066 0.00003 in 10 000 (93.4% of detected variants are false) ViVan demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity across coverage levels with only a minor cost in PPV. SAMtools pileup\u2019s decline in PPV is the result of a decrease in PPV as coverage increases. coverage in this data set was low (100) ViVan\u2019s PPV was the lowest. however, ViVan demonstrated the highest sensitivity out of the three methods. a coverage increase should compare ViVan\u2019s PPV to the other methods. we found that the majority of the variants showed a higher frequency than expected in the disagreeing replicates. this suggests that ViVan maintains high reproducibility (88.4%) even in low variant rates, given sufficient coverage. this demonstrates that ViVan maintains high reproducibility (88.4%) even in low variant rates. the higher sensitivity of HTS identifies more extremely low-frequency variants than would otherwise be detected by other available methods. however, when cut-off thresholds of 0.005 or 0.01 were set, ViVan generated more conservative mutation profiles that resembled previously reported values for wild type and low fidelity variants. s of ribavirin and the dose dependent increase in the frequency (% of total virus population) of specific transition (C > U, G > A, U > C, A > G; dashed lines) and transversion (labeled \u2018others\u2019; solid lines) were determined by ViVan Chemical agents inducing mutations, i.e. mutagens. the ribavirin treated population also presents the expected G to A and C to U transitions with the highest frequencies. the results confirm a dose-dependent increase in the ribavirin-associated transition mutations (C to U and G to A) compared with the other transition (A to G and U to C) and transversion mutations, which showed no dose dependent effect. we Applied ViVan on three sequenced samples: the initial virus population (stock virus); following seven passages in HeLa cells (p7 HeLa); and after alternating passages between HeLa cells and mosquito C6/36 cells (p7 alt). the stock virus had a total of 305 minority variants. this diversity increased to 443 after serial passage in HeLa cells, and 419 when alternating between HeLa and C6 cells. we detected 396 variants across the viral genome. only nine variants had frequencies above 1% of the total population. variant exhibiting highest rate was an aspargine to lysine change, position 112 of the non-structural protein 4. variants were found only in the alternating passages positions. one of these variant positions demonstrated a high variant allele rate. emergence of such mutations would likely be detectable long before dominating the viral population. the high fidelity A372V variant and the low fidelity S299T variant maintained lower and higher diversity throughout the 120 replication cycles and in all triplicate series. for this purpose, we reviewed all the variants that either (i) accumulated in more than one population or (ii) accumulated at the highest rate. ele rate change throughout replication passages was detected. only four were non-structural, one non-synonymous in 2B and two non-synonymous in the viral polymerase (3D) the polymerase variants were then recognized as variants already known to modulate viral replication fidelity. A372V accumulated in all three WT populations with an average rate of 37% at passage 120. Variant positions, common to more than one population and having a rate >5% in passage 120. observations suggest that viral populations may fine tune their mutation rates during their infection cycles by generating mixed populations of fidelity variants. this suggests that minority variants within the viral population are responsible for this effect. study only the consensus sequence of an RNA virus insufficiently summarizes the viral population. we provide three files with pairwise comparisons supplying the mutations found to be different or common among samples. these outputs are rapid and powerful, enabling comprehensive analysis of large data sets. we have made ViVan available and accessible for users without computational proficiency in the virology community through an easy-to-use web server. the emergence of fidelity altering mutations in late passages of the wild type strain has not been previously observed. such modulation of fidelity would be reminiscent of environment-dependent changes in bacterial mutation rates (Sniegowski et al., 1997). bioinformatic pipeline provides low allele rate cut-off threshold to determine statistically significant minority variants. it readily performs group sample comparisons, a feature not currently available to the scientific community interested in experimental evolution. a.B. was supported by the ANR-09-JCJC-0118.
