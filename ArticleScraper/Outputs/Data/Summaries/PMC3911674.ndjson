{"summary": "IFN-/ binding to its receptor induces JAK/STAT signaling and upregulation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in infected and uninfected cells. the classically studied ISGs disrupt viral replication and subsequent spread by interfering with both viral and host cell transcription and translation. Ifit family members in mice, Ifit1 (Isg56), Ifit2 (Isg54), Ifit3 (Isg49), and four in humans, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 (Isg60), and IFIT5 (Isg58). both mouse and human IFIT1 and IFIT2 inhibit protein synthesis by binding to specific translation initiation factor subunits (10\u201312). ifit2 deficiency did not alter viral replication or pathogenesis following direct intracranial VSV infection. however, this apparently Ifit2-independent VSV spread is likely due to the rapid neuronal replication rate, preventing effective IFN-/ and ISG induction prior to neuronal death. V infection due to rapid degradation of the RNase L-activating oligoadenylates synthesized by activated OAS (30). RNase L only modestly prevents spread of the glia-tropic MHV-JHM to CNS microglia/macrophages; nevertheless, it provides protection from fatal disease. mice were infected intracranially in the left hemisphere with 1,000 PFU of MHV-A59 diluted in endotoxin-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) intraperitoneal infections were carried out with 1,000 PFU MHV-A59 in 300 l Dulbecco's PBS. cDNA samples were dissociated with TRIzol in a Tissuelyser II.

BMDM (1.2 107 cells) were infected with MHV-A59 at an MOI of 10 for 8 or 12 h. resuspended in 750 l hypotonic buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 4 mM MgCl2, 6 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) nuclei released by 20 gentle strokes in 2 ml Dounce homo membranes labeled overnight with anti-IRF3 Ab (Santa Cruz sc-9082) and anti-phospho-S396 IRF3 Ab (human S396 = murine S388; Cell Signaling no. 4947) anti-HDAC1 Ab (Santa Cruz no. sc-7872), anti-actin Ab (Sigma no. A2066), and anti-alpha-tubulin Ab (Sigma no. T6074) were used as ouse IFN- MAb (XMG1.2; BD Biosciences) and avidin peroxidase followed by 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB reagent set; BD Biosciences) 30 min later. serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) assay was measured using LL171 cells. survival curves were analyzed by a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. real-time PCR data in vivo were analyzed by an unpaired, two-tailed Student t test. intraperitoneal infections were carried out with 1,000 PFU MHV-A59 in 300 l Dulbecco's PBS. all animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold in RNase-free water before analysis by quantitative real-time PCR using either SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or TaqMan technology. primer sequences for SYBR green PCR analysis are as follows. all samples were run in duplicate on a 96-well plate using a 7500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) all samples were run in duplicate on a 96-well plate using an automatic set baseline and a manually set critical threshold (CT) at which the fluorescent signal becomes higher than the signals for all of the PCR pairs. specific cell types identified by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-, phycoerythrin (PE)-, peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-, or allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated MAb for 30 min on ice in FACS buffer. brains from 7 or 8 mice were finely minced and triturated with 0.25% trypsin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C CNS-infiltrating CD45hi F4/80+ macrophages and resident CD45lo F4/80+ microglia were purified on a BD FACSAria cell sorter. cells were resuspended with unconjugated O4 MAb and anti-mouse IgM (FITC) MAb (R6-60.2). 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized in 1% Triton-X in PBS for 30 min. nonspecific antibody binding was blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin. cells expressing Ifit2 were identified with rabbit-anti-Ifit2 antibody (20), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (GFAP, G-A-5; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) 20 ml was plated in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks for culturing in a humidified, 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator for 1 week. cells near confluence were removed by scraping, and 2 106 cells were plated into 60-mm by 15-mm petri dishes. BMDM were confirmed to be >90% F480+ and CD11b+ cells. nuclei were released by 20 gentle strokes in 2 ml Dounce homogenizer. nuclei were resuspended in glycerol buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 8.3], 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 40% glycerol), washed with PBS, and lysed in 100 l of lysis buffer. mouse IL-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Ready-Set-Go (eBioscience 88-7013) and IL-6 ELISA Ready-Set-Go (eBioscience 88-7064) according to manufacturer's instructions. IFN- in brain supernatants was measured by ELISA as described previously (40) LL171 cells were stably transfected with an IFN-stimulated response element-luciferase reporter plasmid (ISRE-Luc) (41) infectious MHV in samples was inactivated by exposure to UV light for 20 min. recombinant IFN- A/D (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a cytokine standard. adult Ifit2/ mice were intracranially infected with MHV-A59. clinical disease peaked at days 8 to 9 p.i., subsided by day 12 p.i.. encephalitis symptoms rapidly progressed in 50% to 60% of Ifit2/ mice. a 5-fold increase in virus dose did not alter the survival of wt or the disease phenotype in Ifit2/ mice, but a 50-fold increase resulted in 90% mortality in Ifit2/ mice without affecting survival in wt mice. these results demonstrate a crucial role of Ifit2 in protection against neurotropic MHV-A59 infection. ifit2 deficiency had no impact on initial virus replication at day 3 p.i., but significantly increased infectious virus by day 5 p.i.. wt ALT mice harbored similar virus titers in the brain as wt ALT mice. data are averages from two independent experiments. Wt and Ifit2/ mice infected intraperitoneally with MHV-A59 were assessed for viral N transcripts in liver at days 5 and 7 p.i. by quantitative real-time PCR (4 mice/time point and group) serum ALT levels in Ifit2/ mice were slightly higher (41 IU/liter) compared to wt mice (16 IU/liter) at peak of disease, both were within normal mouse serum ALT ranges (17 to 77 IU/liter), supporting limited liver damage in Ifit2/ mice. there was no evidence for elevated virus replication in spleens of Ifit2/ mice. the predominant cell type infected in wt mice had the morphology of microglia/macrophages. microglia appeared to be the most frequently infected cell type in both wt and Ifit2/ mice. a proportionately higher number of infected neurons in the cerebrum and brain stem. wt and Ifit2/ mice show infected cells at higher magnifications. arrows point to cells with neuronal morphology. bars, 1,000 m (A and B), 250 m (C to F) and 20 m (all insets) p.i. were stained with the anti-N antibody J3.3 (A to C; red); and costained with anti-Iba1 (A to C; green); and anti-GFAP antibody (B; green); and anti-NeuN (C; green); p.i. were costained with anti-Iba1 (A; green); and p.i. were costained with anti-Iba1 (A; green); and anti-GFAP antibody (B; decrease in Ifn-/ mRNA was most pronounced in Ifit2/ mice. IFN levels in brain homogenates measured by IFN-/ bioassay were also significantly reduced in Ifit2/ mice. reduced expression of mRNAs was also observed in spinal cords of infected Ifit2/ mice harboring high virus loads relative to wt mice. luciferase reporter assay measured activity in brain supernatants. data were analyzed by the unpaired two-tailed Student t test. mRNA expression of IFN-, a cytokine prominently released by T cells. Ifit2/ mice bearing higher virus loads showed similar levels of IL-1 and IL-6 compared to wt mice. these protein patterns reflected mRNA levels and suggested no major role for Ifit2 in global translational inhibition in vivo. IL-1, IL-6, CCL5, and IFN- in brain supernatants of individual infected wt and Ifit2/ mice at day 5 p.i. measured by ELISA (3 to 6 mice/group) data were analyzed by the unpaired two-tailed Student t test. mRNA levels in microglia, macrophages, and oligodendroglia purified from brains of naive or infected wt mice at indicated time points p.i. data represent a single experiment with 10 pooled mice per time point. Ifit2 was detected in ependymal cells, the choroid plexus, and the brain parenchyma proximal to ventricles. in all these regions, Ifit2 was found within and adjacent to infected cells, suggesting IFN-/-mediated induction in both infected and proximal uninfected cells. astrocytes are capable of responding to IFN-/ and IFN- (53\u201355) microglia and macrophages from Ifit2/ mice expressed higher levels of viral mRNA at day 4 p.i. but reduced levels of Ifn1, Ifn4, and Ifn5 mRNA relative to wt counterparts. impaired mRNA expression with increased viral load became even more evident by day 5 p.i. at day 4 p.i., mice were selected unbiasedly for cell preparations. mRNA expression of the ISG Ifit1, Isg15, and Pkr was reduced 1.5- to 2.5-fold in both microglia and macrophages. mRNA expression of the monocyte chemoattractant CCL2 (56) was not altered in Ifit2/ microglia or macrophages by day 4 p.i. and even increased in microglia from Ifit2/ mice with severe encephalitis. cell preparations from Ifit2/ mice with moderate encephalitis (scores 2) and severe encephalitis (scores > 2). BMDM were used to assess the effect of Ifit2 on virus replication and IFN-/ expression following MHV-A59 infection in vivo. the downstream ISG Ifit and Isg15 mRNAs were also reduced 10- to 20-fold in the Ifit2/ compared to wt BMDM. mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF and chemokine CCL2 was only modestly reduced in Ifit2/ BMDM. both human IFIT3 and murine Ifit2 have been shown to enhance IFN-/ induction and amplification by upregulating IRF3 phosphorylation in BMDM. IFIT3 exerts its function by bridging mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) with the IRF3 kinase TBK1 (18) nuclear protein fractions and whole-cell lysates of MHV-A59-infected BMDM were subjected to immunoblotting at the indicated time points. purity of nuclear extracts was confirmed by the absence of strictly cytoplasmic tubulin-. d in 50% to 60% of Ifit2/ mice as evidenced by severely hunched posture and wasting (score of 3), resulting in mortality between days 6 and 8 p.i.. d in 50% to 60% of mice recovered by day 14 p.i. survival curves represent three independent experiments with 10 to 16 mice/group/experiment. Ifit2 suppresses virus replication in the CNS and liver. MHV-A59 replication was measured in the CNS and peripheral tissues. iency increases CNS virus replication in the CNS and liver. wt and Ifit2/ mice infected intraperitoneally with MHV-A59 were assessed for viral N transcripts in liver at days 5 and 7 p.i. deficiency was associated with a modest 2- to 4-fold increase in viral RNA in livers at day 3 p.i. and an 15-fold increase at day 5 p.i. compared to wt mice. elevated levels of viral RNA in livers in individual Ifit2/ mice were still 16-fold lower than in the brain. there was no gross evidence for hepatitis in either wt or Ifit2/ infected mice. MHV-A59 infects neurons, and different glial cells in various brain regions. the predominant cell type infected in wt mice had the morphology of microglia/macrophages. Ifit2 deficiency enhances virus dissemination. increased foci of viral antigen-positive cells in cerebrum (A and B) of wt and Ifit2/ mice. ifit2 deficiency enhances virus replication in microglia/macrophages and in neurons in the hind brain. cells in Ifit2/ brains at day 5 p.i. were stained with anti-N antibody J3.3 (A to C; red), and costained with anti-Iba1 (A to C; red) MHV-A59 induces IFN-/ in microglia/macrophages via MDA5 (50) further, IFN-/ signaling on macrophages and dendritic cells is critical for the early containment of MHV within secondary lymphoid organs (51). MHV-A59 induces IFN-/ in microglia/macrophages via MDA5 (50) subsequently reduces ISG induction and contributes to increased virus replication. these data support a novel Ifit2-mediated positive feedback loop in propagating IFN-/ induction during MHV CNS infection. Ifit2 deficiency did not alter mRNA expression of the acute-phase proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, NOS2 and TNF. expression of mRNA encoding the macrophage or lymphocyte chemoattractants CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were similar in infected Ifit2/ mice relative to wt mice. mRNA expression of IFN-, a cytokine prominently released by T iency specifically impairs induction of IFN-/ but not proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines. expression of mRNA in brains of wt and Ifit2/ mice at days 0 and 5 p.i. kinetics of Ifit2 gene mRNA expression in relation to IFN-/ mRNA. mRNA levels were sustained until day 5 p.i. and only gradually declined. Ifit2 mRNA was expressed in all three cell types at day 3 p.i.. peak Ifit2 mRNA expression correlated kinetically with the prominent effect of Ifit2 deficiency on virus replication at day 5 p.i. aining for CD11b, GFAP, or NeuN markers remains unknown. both nonactivated and modestly activated microglia expressing low levels of CD11b and oligodendrocytes are likely candidates. Ifn1 mRNA levels were only marginally reduced in Ifit2/ microglia, Ifn4 and Ifn5 mRNA levels were reduced 5-fold and 3-fold respectively. Increasingly impaired Ifn-/ mRNA expression with increased viral load became even more evident by day 5 p.i. compared to day 4 p.i. CD45lo F480+ microglia (Micro) and CD45hi F480+ macrophages (Macro) purified from infected wt and Ifit2/ brains at day 4 p.i. and 5 p.i. by FACS were compared for expression of viral N, Ifn1, Ifn4, Ifn5, and Ccl2 mRNAs. for day 5 p.i., samples were cell preparations from Ifit2/ mice mRNA levels in infected Ifit2/ BMDM were reduced 90-fold and 60-fold at 12 and 18 h p.i. expression of Ifn-4 and Ifn-5 mRNA was reduced more robustly than that of Ifn-1 mRNA in Ifit2/ relative to wt but not Ifit2/ cells. BMDM cultures from wt and Ifit2/ mice were infected with MHV-A59 at an MOI of 1. expression of viral N, Ifn1, Ifn4, Ifn5, Ifit1, Isg15, Ccl2 and Tnf mRNA were measured at 12 and 18 h p.i. phospho-specific MAb to assess IRF3 phosphorylation at serine residue 388 revealed a limited phosphorylation specifically at this site in whole-cell lysates and nuclear extracts. these data support the idea that limited S388 phosphorylation of IRF3 in the absence of Ifit2 may contribute to reduced IFN-/ expression following MHV infection. a/macrophages in vivo, RNase L dampens and delays virus-induced demyelination (28). the IFIT proteins are among the most strongly induced ISGs following MHV infection (27, 28), similar to many other viral infections (9). astrocyte infection and minimal liver infection in wt mice contrast with pathogenesis studies in younger (4-week-old) mice. mortality of Ifit2/ mice may be due to cardiorespiratory failure. spread of MHV to cerebellum and brainstem may be attributed to similar mechanisms underlying Ifit2-mediated restriction of VSV neuronal spread following intranasal infection (20). deficiency affects an MDA5-dependent pathway of IFN-/ induction (15, 17, 50) MDA5 signaling recruits downstream adaptor proteins TRAF3 or TRAF6 and the kinases TBK1 and IKK/ to the MAVS complex. thereby inducing IRF3/IRF7-mediated IFN-/ and NF-B-mediated cytokine expression (61). MHV-A59 Ifit2/ mice may thus contribute to diverging CNS viral control and pathogenesis. reduced IRF3 phosphorylation in the absence of Ifit2 may further be exacerbated by MHV-derived decoy proteins competing for TBK1. Ifit2-enhanced IRF3 phosphorylation contributes to enhanced IFN-/ induction. the precise mechanisms by which Ifit2 interact with components of the MDA5 pathway remain to be elucidated, but they are likely to be MHV specific."}
