{"summary": "TEXT The Coronaviridae subfamily contains the four genera Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltacoronavirus (1, 2). Betacoronaviruses are further discriminated into clades a to d. betacoronaviruses are further discriminated into clades a to d. fecal samples from european hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) kept in an animal shelter in northern Germany were sampled noninvasively and stored in RNAlater at 20\u00b0C until further investigation. RNA purification and coV detection using two different nested reverse transcription-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were done as described previously (16, 20, 21) carcasses from 27 hedgehogs that died in the animal shelter during sequences obtained from 454-NGS were reproduced on individual samples. determination of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genome ends was done using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit. nucleic acid alignments were compared to other c clade betacoronaviruses. a rabbit anti-suncus immunoglobulin G (IgG) adapted for cross-recognition of hedgehog Ig was used as a secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution. a rabbit anti-suncus immunoglobulin G (IgG) adapted for cross-recognition of hedgehog Ig was used as a secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution. individual specimens in positive pools were identified using a strain-specific real-time RT-PCR (oligonucleotide sequences available upon request) sequences from the PCR screening assays were extended to an 816-nucleotide (nt) RdRp fragment (22) carcasses from 27 hedgehogs that died during their stay were collected and stored at 20\u00b0C. PCR products were sequenced by dye terminator chemistry (Seqlab, Goettingen, Germany) nucleic acid alignments were done based on the amino acid coding using the MAFFT algorithm (26) in the geneious software package. phylogenetic analyses of the extended screening fragments and the presumed ORFs were done using a WAG amino acid substitution model. a rabbit anti-suncus immunoglobulin G (IgG) adapted for cross-recognition of hedgehog Ig was used as a secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution. Detection was done with a cyanine 3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) Virus neutralization tests against MERS-CoV were done as described previously (32). all EriCoVs grouped phylogenetically within the Betacoronavirus clade c. the amino acid distances to the clade c prototype viruses were 7.7 to 8.8%. the distance from the Nycteris CoV was 8.5 to 9.2%. the high detection rate and virus concentrations in feces appeared compatible with replication in the intestine. intestinal virus concentrations in these 12 animals were high, 6.78 log10 mean RNA copies per gram of tissue. this was comparable to viruses replicating in the human gut, such as rota- and noroviruses. colors represent individual animals as identified in the key. ranges of EriCoV concentrations in 10 different intestinal sections were given in log10 RNA copies per gram of tissue. all IFA-positive sera were tested in a MERS-CoV neutralization assay. none of the IFA-positive sera contained MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in dilutions higher than 1:20. this was compatible with cross-reactivity of anti-EriCoV antibodies. Figure 4 shows the genome organization of EriCoV and other clade c betacoronaviruses. the predicted leader TRS of EriCoV differed by only three nucleotides from those of the betacoronavirus clade c prototype viruses HKU4, HKU5, and MERS-CoV. the conserved TRS core sequence of clade c betacoronaviruses is highlighted in gray. the conserved TRS core sequence of clade c betacoronaviruses (40, 52), ACGAA, is highlighted in gray. a4301\u2013His4440 140 11 Ser4441\u2013Leu4454 14 Ser4450\u2013Leu4463 14 Short peptide at the end of ORF1a 12 Ser4441\u2013Gln5374 934 Ser4450\u2013Gln5383 934 RdRp 13 Ala5375\u2013Gln5972 598 Ala5384\u2013Gln5981 598 Hel, NTPase 14 Ser5973\u2013Gln6496 524 a separate comparison of amino acid sequences of seven conserved replicase domains for formal CoV species delineation is shown in Table 3. the sequence identities of the seven conserved replicase domains were well below the 90% threshold proposed by the ICTV (41), confirming the presence of a separate new CoV species. new tab a Including sequences with accession numbers KC545383 and KC545386. b Including sequences with accession numbers EF065505, EF065506, EF065507, EF065508, and DQ648794. d Including sequences with accession numbers EF065509, EF065507, EF065511, and EF065512. a Pairwise identities of all ORFs and predicted proteins of the two EriCoVs were calculated using alignments by the MAFFT algorithm (20) in the geneious software package (Biomatters) and MEGA5 (29) phylogenies of all EriCoV ORFs are shown in Fig. 6. different topologies were observed for individual ORFs. analysis by Bootscans on nearly complete genome alignments identified no obvious signs of recombination. failure to isolate EriCoV might predict a low potential to replicate in heterologous host cells. the detailed genomic analysis of EriCoV may facilitate the generation of recombinant clade c viruses once reverse genetic systems for this betacoronavirus clade become available. there is close phylogenetic relatedness between the mammalian orders Chiroptera, which includes bats, and Eulipotyphla, which includes hedgehogs."}
