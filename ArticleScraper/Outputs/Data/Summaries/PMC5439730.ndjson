{"summary": "bio-aerosols originate from different sources and their potentially pathogenic nature may form a hazard to healthcare workers and patients. so far no extensive review on existing evidence regarding bio-aerosols is available. bio-aerosols are aerosols composed of particles of any kind of organism. bio-aerosols can be generated by devices such as ventilation systems, showers and high energetic instruments running on tap water. healthcare workers are at higher risk to acquire pathogenic micro-organisms. their risk of exposure is in line with the infectious nature of their patients. they produce high virulence bio-aerosols, or HCWs exposed to bio-aerosol sources in dental practices. a scoping review was performed systematically according to the PRISMA statement. three search strings were run in PubMed and EMBASE from inception to 09-03-2016. ozoa OR amoebe OR amoebas OR amoebic OR fungus OR fungal OR fungi OR fungating OR parasites OR parasitemias OR \u201cmicro organism\u201d or \u201cmicro organisms\u201d microorganism or micro-organisms OR micro-organisms OR micro-organisms OR micro-organisms. studies on the microbial composition of the bio-aerosols were categorized based on sources. a reference check and search through grey literature was conducted and included in the flowchart termed \u2018snowballing\u2019. viral OR viridae OR viral OR viruses [Mesh] OR amoebozoa OR amoebe OR amoebas OR amoebic OR fungus OR fungal OR fungi OR fungating OR parasites [Mesh] OR parasites OR parasitemias OR \u201cmicro organism\u201d or \u201cmicro organisms\u201d microorganism or micro-organisms OR micro-organisms OR micro-organisms OR micro-organism a total of 5823 studies were retrieved, of which 678 duplicates and 4797 irrelevant studies were removed. a reference check and search through grey literature was conducted and included in the study of characteristics table. patients with cystic fibrosis positive for burkoderia cepacia were also capable of producing pathogenic aerosols. intervention was colonoscopy, tracheal intubation, suction before and after intubation, manipulation oxygen mask, bronchoscopy, non-invasive ventilation, insertion of nasogastric tube, defibrillation, chest physiotherapy, and washing the patient.

Legionella species were found to be a bio-aerosol dependent hazard to patients and healthcare workers."}
