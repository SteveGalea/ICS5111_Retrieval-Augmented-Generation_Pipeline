{"summary": "disaster preparedness training is essential to maintaining an efficient healthcare system in the midst of a disaster. however, disaster preparedness training in most countries is based in specialised hospitals, public health schools or medical schools. many organisations and groups based mostly in developed countries have begun to develop competency-based education and training for healthcare professionals. the national disaster management committee has standards for health emergency plans which involve prevention, mitigation, preparedness and response measures. many health academic institutions around the world lack disaster preparedness curricula and have no developed competencies for students in health professions. disaster nursing education for undergraduate students was recently introduced in 44 nursing schools in china. less than half of the nursing education programmes in Japan included disaster nursing courses in 2009. there is little information on the availability of disaster nursing content in the undergraduate curriculum for nursing students in Oman. disaster preparedness training was reserved for nurses practicing in emergency departments or was offered only as a specialised post-basic course. existing nursing curricula in many countries are already at maximum capacity without the addition of further modules on disaster preparedness. the WHO and ICN Framework of Disaster Nursing Competencies could be adopted by universities to underpin undergraduate nursing curriculum content. there is no evidence in literature of a national action to prepare nurses for disasters in Oman. academic institutions and the MOH should work together to develop a national framework for disaster training in Oman."}
