{"summary": "american trypanosomiasis, also known as Chagas disease, is a chronic and potentially fatal disorder. it is one of the major endemic problems in Latin America and ranks as the third most important parasitic disease in the world after malaria and schistosomiasis. tcSSP4 and TcSP gene-immunized/experimentally infected mice showed a 64% and a 73% reduction in parasitemia. survival was 75% in TcSSP4 gene-immunized/infected mice and 100% in those immunized with TcSP gene and then infected. all animals had been immunized against canine distemper, canine parvovirus, coronavirus, hepatitis, leptospirosis, canine infectious tracheobronchitis, and rabies, and intestinal deworming. all animals were negative for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [25] used to diagnose CD in dogs prior to the start of the study and were healthy. the animals in the healthy control group were not subjected to any experimental procedure. the experimental T. cruzi infection was confirmed microscopically (parasitemia) in all infected groups. all animals were monitored clinically by general physical examinations and electrocardiographics studies. euthanasia Dogs were euthanized at chronic phase (11 months after infection) using sodium pentobarbital as a general anesthetic at a dose of 30 mg/kg applied intravenously. a lethal dose of intravenous 15% potassium chloride was administered. the heart and the spleen were collected during necropsy and were weighed. less foci of inflammatory cells/field (400x); 2, more than one inflammatory foci/field. 3, generalized coalescing of foci of inflammation or disseminated inflammation. severe tissue necrosis, interstitial edema, hemorrhage, and loss of tissue integrity. the experimental protocol was approved by the bioethics committee of the Instituto Nacional de Cardiologa, Ignacio Ch\u00e1vez. the animals were divided randomly into 5 groups (n = 7) the dogs were immunized with 500 g DNA dissolved in 500 L physiological saline solution (SS) all animals were monitored clinically by general physical examinations and electrocardiographics studies. a serological monitoring (ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence as confirmatory test) was also performed in pBK-CMV plasmid-immunized and SS mock-immunized/infected dogs [24] to evaluate the establishment of infection by the presence of antibodies anti-T. cruzi. cardiomegaly and splenomegaly were evaluated by determining the heart and spleen indices. the organ index was significantly higher than that observed in healthy non-infected animals [31]. spleen indices data from all vaccinated groups were compared among themselves and between the non-infected group (control for infection) inflammation 1 to 4 scores were converted to logarithms (base 10) after 1 was added to each score to correct for 0 values. right BBB SS (mock-immunized) 3/7 (43%) Most often abnormal if it is found on serial EKG and combined with other disturbances 1/7 (14%) VPC 2/7 (29%) Pericardial effusion 2/7 (29%) Myocardial infarction and/or pericarditis and right ventricular enlargement EKG: electrocardiogram. AV: atrioventricular. MIMI: microscopic intramural myocardial infar splenomegaly and cardiomegaly were calculated by the mean spleen (a) and the mean heart (b) indices, respectively, as compared with the healthy control group. differences were considered as significant when P 0.05 was performed. dogs immunized with pBCSP gene (pBCSP plasmid) and empty plasmid showed heart indices similar to those obtained from healthy non-infected control animals. the heart index of the TcSSP4 gene-(pBCSSP4 plasmid) immunized/infected group was not different from that of the healthy non-infected control animals. hea and pericardium; splenic thickened walls; white areas in the spleen and heart. other macroscopic alterations in DNA-immunized dogs with chronic experimental Chagas disease. Alterations related to heart inflammation were identified in 100% of the dogs immunized with TcSSP4 gene (pBCSSP4 plasmid), pBK-CMV, and inoculated with SS groups. however, the extent of inflammation of the heart tissue during the chronic phase of infection was reduced in dogs immunized with the recombinant plasmids. inflammatory lesion (lymphocyte infiltrates) scores from three different sections of heart tissues of DNA-immunized dogs with chronic experimental Chagas disease. d) score 0 (without foci of inflammation) from a healthy/uninfected dog. group dogs/n (%) Suggested pathological conditions by EKG features found [29, 30] TcSP gene (pBCSP plasmid) 2/7 (29%) AV block 1/7 (14%) Left ventricular enlargement TcSSP4 gene (pBCSSP4 plasmid) 1/7 (14%) MIMI 1/7 (14%) Second-degree AV block pBK-CMV (empty plasmid) 6/7 (86%) Most often abnormal polarity of the T wave on serial EKGs was present in 6/7 dogs (86%) of the pBK-CMV empty plasmid-immunized/infected group and in 3/7 dogs (43%) of the SS mock-immunized/infected group. altered T wave, QRS complexes, and S waves suggesting right BBB were present in one dog (14%) from the pBK-CMV-immunized/inf Splenomegaly and cardiomegaly were calculated by mean spleen (a) and mean heart (b) indices, respectively (S.D.) differences were considered as significant when P 0.05 (Kruskal-Wallis test among immunized/infected groups) and healthy non-infected animals was performed. animals (6/7) immunized with pBK-CMV empty cloning vector were whitish areas in the heart of fibrous consistency, abundant pericardial fluid, and white areas in the spleen. one dog (14%) of the TcSSP4 gene-(pBCSSP4 plasmid) immunized/infected group exhibited a heart with adhesions in the trachea and pericardium; sple no evidence of amastigotes' nests was observed in any tissue analyzed of all experimentally infected dogs. similar microscopic changes of sections of heart tissue were found in all DNA immunized/infected and SS mock-immunized/infected groups. inflammatory infiltrates were the predominant cell infiltrates along with histiocytes and neutrophils. inflammatory lesion scores from three different sections of heart tissues of DNA-immunized dogs with chronic experimental Chagas disease. no significant differences were found among themselves. a new tab *Differences were considered significant when P 0.05 (Kruskal-Wallis test among immunized/infected and healthy non-infected and healthy non-infected control animals, whose values obtained were 0.0), was performed. a condition present in all dogs infected with T. cruzi Ninoa strain as one of the symptoms of heart dysfunction in chronic CD. the most of the T. cruzi strains that have been genetically analyzed to DNA-immunization did not abrogate the parasitemia found in all experimental groups during the acute phase of CD. however, the antibodies produced by DNA-immunized dogs mediated the lysis of parasites through the complement system. the cardiomegaly, inflammation, and fibrosis were associated to the presence of high in vitro infectivity of T. cruzi strains. genes encode a trans-sialidase and an amastigote specific-protein. the genes stimulate a strong humoral and cellular response during CCC. the abnormalities recorded in the EKGs agreed with the cardiomegaly found in the infected dogs. tic inflammation in myocardium [36], diffuse fibrous cardiopathy [38], chronic productive perisplenitis [38], fibrosis partially or completely interrupting the path of muscle bundles, cardiomegaly, heart with a globus shape, hydropericardium [13], dilated cardiomyopathy (biventricular dilation), focal and diffused myocarditis, round shaped hearts, and epicardial hemorrhages [19]."}
