{"summary": "Glutathione S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) is one of three major groups of enzymes that carry out detoxification. GSTs belong to a supergene family of multifunctional enzymes. they are grouped into different species-independent gene classes. the NTD adopts a thioredoxin fold ( motif) which is highly conserved through GST classes. the CTD is larger (90\u2013217 residues) and consists of 5 -helices [3, 20\u201322] residues at the CTD interact with various hydrophobic xenobiotic substrates. recombinant camel GSTM1 was produced and purified from E. coli. the amino acid sequence of CdGSTM1 was aligned with ten homologous mammalian GSTM1 by MAFFT Multiple Sequence Alignment. the alignment was generated by MAFFT Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithm. dGSTM1 amino acid sequence with homologous mu-class GSTs. a single sharp peak was observed at 70 mL. the yield of soluble, pure CdGSTM1 protein was approximately 30 mg L-1 in a shake-flask culture. the yield of soluble, pure CdGSTM1 protein was approximately 30 mg L-1 in a shake-flask culture. the quaternary structure of the protein was determined using an analytical Superdex 200 column. GSTM1 significantly decreased below pH 4.0, probably owing to denaturation or dissociation of CdGSTM1 subunits. however, loss of enzymatic activity at acidic pH was reversible. the red shift in the wavelength maximum signified that the tryptophan residues were exposed to the polar environment, thus indicating changes in protein tertiary structure. the maximum wavelength remained unchanged below pH 3.0, indicating that the same microenvironment around tryptophan residues was retained. dGSTM1 at 208 and 222 nm were insignificant at pH 1.0\u201310.0. far-UV CD results indicated that the secondary structure of CdGSTM1 was remained stable with changes in pH. sulfonic acid (ANS) with CdGSTM1 (4 M) at pH 1.0\u201310.0 was monitored by excitation at 380 nm (bandwidth 2.5 nm) and emission spectra collected from 400\u2013600 nm (bandwidth 5 nm) at 22\u00b0C. the binding of ANS (200 M) with CdGSTM1 (4 M) was monitored by excitation at 380 nm (bandwidth 2.5 nm) CdGSTM1 incubated at pH 2.0 yielded peaks at 22.2 and 25.9 mL. gel-permeation chromatography revealed that above pH 5.0, CdGSTM1 exists in its dimeric form; however, between pH 3.0 and 5.0, it exists in a monomeric-dimeric equilibrium. CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0 (lane 2) showed a predominant band at the monomeric size of CdGSTM1 (dissociated state) at pH 4.0 (lane 3) exists as a dimer and dissociated form, which cross-links with high-molecular-weight aggregates. at pH 7.0 (lane 4), a prominent band corresponding to the dimeric form of CdGSTM1 was observed. elution peaks obtained at pH 2.0, 4.0, and 7.0 were separately subjected to glutaraldehyde cross-linkage. the first peak at pH 2.0 displayed cross-linkage in the monomeric form (lane 1) and the second peak showed a faint band corresponding to the monomeric size of CdGSTM1 (lane 2). the Ksv values of CdGSTM1 at pH 7.4 were markedly low because of complete folding of CdGSTM1. the Ksv values at 6M GdnHCl denaturation of CdGSTM1 were the highest because of complete folding of CdGSTM1. however, Trp residues were also exposed at pH 2.0, but to a lesser extent than in 6M GdnHCl-treated samples. the temperature-melting curves of the samples were obtained through gradual heating at a constant rate of 1\u00b0C min-1. CdGSTM1 formed visible aggregates above 75\u00b0C between pH 5.0 and 10.0. however, below pH 3.0, no aggregates were observed up to 94\u00b0C. structure of CdGSTM1 undergoes thermal denaturation via a two-state unfolding pathway at all pH values. Exceptionally high stability (65.2\u00b0C) at pH 3.0 might have result from monomer-dimer equilibrium. the thermal melting points (Tm) and van't Hoff enthalpy of CdGSTM1 at both pHs were determined via global 3 analysis software, Applied Photophysics Ltd, UK. the Tm of dimeric CdGSTM1 at pH 7.0 was 51.5 0.1\u00b0C and van't Hoff enthalpy was 666.4 9.8 kJ mol-1. thermal denaturation of monomeric CdGSTM1 led to the conversion of the same alpha-helical structure to a random-coiled dominant structure. monomeric CdGSTM1 loses its secondary structure beyond 30\u00b0C but retains nearly half of its secondary structure even up to 94\u00b0C. the dimeric and monomeric states adopt an -helix conformation. at low temperature, CdGSTM1 loses its secondary structure completely. monomeric form retained nearly half of the secondary structure with a dominant random-coil conformation. TM1 superimposed on hGSTM1A-1A indicated a high degree of similarity. a single sharp peak was observed at 70 mL of eluted volume. decyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single band at 26 kDa. the yield of soluble, pure CdGSTM1 protein was approximately 30 mg L-1 in a shake-flask culture. the quaternary structure of the purified protein was determined using an analytical Superdex 200 column. enzymatic activity of CdGSTM1 drastically decreased below pH 4.0, probably owing to denaturation or dissociation of CdGSTM1 subunits. however, loss of enzymatic activity at acidic pH was reversible. escence emission maximum of CdGSTM1 remained unchanged in range of 5.0\u20139.0 pH. between pH 3.0 and 5.0, the wavelength maximum of CdGSTM1 was 6.0 nm (red shifted) the red shift in the wavelength maximum signified that the tryptophan residues were exposed to the polar environment, thus indicating changes in protein tertiary structure. TM1 at pH 7.0 yielded two negative minima, one at 208 and the other at 222 nm, which is a characteristic feature of an alpha helix. changes in the negative ellipticity of CdGSTM1 at 208 and 222 nm were insignificant at pH 1.0\u201310.0. a blue-shift in maximum wavelength signified that the CdGSTM1 was either partially unfolded or monomerised. the binding of ANS (200 M) with CdGSTM1 (4 M) at pH 1.0\u201310.0 was monitored by excitation at 380 nm (bandwidth 2.5 nm) at 22\u00b0C. gel-permeation chromatograms revealed two types of populations. one at 16.3 mL and the other at 25.9 mL. peaks were similar to those of the monomeric state (black) the samples of CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0, 4.0, and 7.0 before and after gel filtration were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. the cross-linked products of CdGSTM1 before and after gel filtration were further analysed via SDS-PAGE. GSTM1 at different pH was loaded on a 24-mL bed volume Superdex 200 column to separate monomer-dimer species of CdGSTM1. at pH 2.0, CdGSTM1at pH 2.0 was dissociated and eluted at two peaks (22.2 and 25.9 mL) the dimer eluted at the expected peak (16.3 mL), followed by the monomeric form after crossing the bed volume. Fig 9 depicts the Stern-Volmer plot for CdGSTM1 protein at different pH values. the Ksv values in the native state at an acidic pH and in the presence of 6M GdnHCl are as follows. the temperature-melting curves of the samples were obtained through gradual heating at a constant rate of 1\u00b0C min-1. CdGSTM1 formed visible aggregates above 75\u00b0C between pH 5.0 and 10.0. however, below pH 3.0, no aggregates were observed up to 94\u00b0C. the mid-point of the thermal transition was identified as thermal melting point (Tm) the tertiary structure of CdGSTM1 undergoes thermal denaturation via a two-state unfolding pathway at all pH values. in this study, thermal stability of CdGSTM1 was moderate between pH 1.0 and 10.0 (Table 2). dGSTM1 (pH 7.0) and monomeric CdHSTM1 (pH 2.0) unfold via a single thermal transition. secondary structure is completely lost at 57\u00b0C, while CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0 retains nearly half of the secondary structure up to 94\u00b0C. thermal stress at pH 7.0 led to the conversion of monomeric CdGSTM1 from an alpha helical structure into a cross-beta sheeted structure. however, monomeric CdGSTM1 loses its secondary structure beyond 30\u00b0C but retains nearly half of its secondary structure even up to 94\u00b0C. Fig 13 measured the reversibility of thermal unfolding in dimeric and monomeric CdGSTM1. dimeric and monomeric CdGSTM1 loses its secondary structure completely. monomeric form retained nearly half of the secondary structure with a dominant random-coil conformation. GSTs are structurally conserved and ubiquitous in virtually all organisms. the molecular weight of CdGSTM1 was determined using SEC. between pH 3.0 and 5.0 CdGSTM1 undergoes a conformational change, resulting in nearly complete loss of enzyme activity. a sharp red-shift (6 nm) in the intrinsic emission maxima was observed between pH 3.0 and 10.0. a minor shift in emission maxima (from 336 to 342 nm) of CdGSTM1 below pH 5.0 indicated a marginal change around the tryptophan residues in CdGSTM1 at low pH. loss of enzyme activity seems to coincide with red-shift in emission maxima, indicating exposure of aromatic residues, especially tryptophan, to the polar environment. an extrinsic fluorescence dye (ANS) does not fluoresce in an aque a modelled structure of CdGSTM1 revealed a conserved Phe57 residue at the dimer interface, which serves as the key of the hydrophobic lock-and-key motif. a mixed charge cluster (six positively and six negatively charged residues) in a 24-residue-long stretch (Arg78 to Glu101) located close to the dimer interface (data not shown) forms ionic interactions between subunits. far-UV CD spectrum of CdGSTM1 showed a typical alpha-helix-structure dominant structure. all the secondary structures (alpha helices, beta sheets, and beta-turns) contents were almost intact between pH 1.0 and 7.0. in the alkaline region, slight conversion of the alpha helix to the random-coil was observed. dimeric CdGSTM1 attains cross-beta sheeted structures during thermal unfolding. alpha helices in monomeric CdGSTM1 were gradually converted to random-coil-like structures during thermal unfolding. similar thermal unfolding behaviour was also observed in rat GSTM2-2, which unfolds via a single transition with a Tm of 54\u00b0C. monomeric CdGSTM1 exists in dimeric state at pH 7.0 while it equilibrated in dimer-monomer form at pH 4.0. at acidic pH of 2.0, it is populated in monomeric form. hGSTM1a-1a was induced using human glutathione S-transferase (PDB: 1GTU) as a template. expression of CdGSTM1 was optimized for expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) codons in the open reading frame were optimized for expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) ulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) cells were lysed via sonication five times for 8 seconds each, in ice. centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 min, and the clear supernatant was collected. purification of recombinant CdGSTM1 was achieved with 10 mL equilibration buffer. the concentration of purified CdGSTM1 was estimated at 280 nm, with a molar extinction coefficient of 39,880 M1cm1. the molecular weight of the CdGSTM1 was calculated using a superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL Prepacked Tricorn Column. the reaction was determined spectrophotometrically based on the increase in UV absorbance at 340 nm at 25\u00b0C. exposure of CdGSTM1 to varying pH was equilibrated overnight. the following buffers were used: KCl-HCl (pH 1.0); Gly-HCl (pH 2.0 and 3.0); phosphate buffer (pH 6.0 and 7.0); Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); Gly-HCl (pH 9.0 and 10); fluorescence spectroscopy Total and tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 25 samples were excited at 380 nm (2.5 nm bandwidth) and emission of ANS-bound proteins measured at 400\u2013600 nm (5-nm bandwidth). acrylamide quenching Stepwise two l of acrylamide quencher was added to the protein samples till saturation was achieved (0\u20130.12 M). the Trp residues of protein sample were excited at 295 nm. dynamic multi-mode spectroscopy of CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0 and 7.0 was performed with a Chirascan-Plus spectrophotometer. protein samples (0.2 mg mL-1) equilibrated overnight at pH 2.0 and 7.0 were gradually heated at 1\u00b0C min-1. homologous mammalian sequences of GSTM1 were identified using CdGSTM1 (accession number XP_010974221.1) amino acid sequence in PSI-BLAST. the output of aligned sequences was color-coded. inoculated medium was incubated at 30\u00b0C with continuous agitation. biomass obtained from 24 h of culturing was harvested via centrifugation. cells were lysed via sonication five times for 8 seconds each, in ice. superdex 75 16/600 GL prepacked column was equilibrated with 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.5. the active fraction of GSH-agarose elute was pooled and loaded on a column using a 5 mL superloop on an AKTA purification system. purity of the gel filtration peak was analysed with a 4\u201315% mini-PROTEAN pre-casted TGX the reaction was carried out in 1 mL of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 1.0 mM GSH, and 1.0 mM CDNB dissolved in ethanol and the enzyme preparation. one unit of CdGSTM1 activity was defined as the amount of GST that catalyses the formation of 1.0 mole of thioether per min. dGSTM1 sample was excited at 500 nm, and emission was collected from 450\u2013550 nm. fluorescence intensity at 500 nm was plotted against different pH. the change in surface hydrophobicity with respect to pH was measured. far-UV CD spectra were measured at a CdGSTM1 concentration of 0.2 mg mL-1 with a 1-mm path length cell at 25\u00b0C. three spectra of each sample were obtained at 200\u2013260 nm. precipitated protein was separated via centrifugation at 13,000 rpm. pellet was dissolved in SDS-loading dye."}
