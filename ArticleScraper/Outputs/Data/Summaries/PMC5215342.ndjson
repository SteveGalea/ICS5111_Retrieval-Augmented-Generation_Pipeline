PEDV N has been shown to localize in the nucleolus of infected cells. stable expression of N in porcine intestinal epithelial cells could induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, prolong the S phase of the cell cycle. apoptosis induced by TGEV infection, TGEV N has been shown to be a viral substrate for caspase-dependent degradation. processing of CoV N seemed to be common in cells infected with coronaviruses. if so, the role of N processing in the PEDV life cycle still needs further investigation. we observed disadvantages in PEDV propagation in vero E6-APN cells. RESULTS PEDV N is cleaved in the presence of the PEDV genome. however, only the topmost band corresponding to full-length PEDV N appeared when the supernatant was analyzed. PEDV N expressed from an expression plasmid (pHW-AVCT12 N) revealed only one major band at the expected size of full-length PEDV N. the prominent cleavage band just above the 43-kDa marker appeared only in the context of infection or the expression of other viral proteins. we examined N cleavage during PEDV infection in the presence of caspase inhibitors. after virus adsorption, infection of cells was continued in infection medium containing either 100 M Z-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-FMK, or dimethyl sulfoxide. e-independent specific cleavage releases the 43-kDa cleavage product. shown are data for vero E6-APN cells infected with PEDVAVCT12. asterisks indicate the major cleavage product (43 kDa) the most likely site, ETTLQQHEEA, was given a substantial possibility score (0.508) and had a perfect match to the consensus substrate specificity for the P2 and P1 sites. we hypothesized that PEDV N was cleaved by its 3Cpro. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-3Cpro-FLAG and pCAGGS-GFP5/6. western blot analysis with anti-GFP antibodies on lysates revealed a smaller, fast-migrating band. cleavage product could be visualized only in the presence of 3Cpro-FLAG but not 3Cpro-C144A-FLAG. leucine at the P2 position (L395) expected that the mutant N protein would be tolerant of cleavage by PEDV 3Cpro. we transplanted the identified cleavage site onto GFP (GFPAVCT12-396) and tested if PEDV 3Cpro could recognize and cleave this substrate in the same manner as in the GFP5/6 construct. PEDV 3Cpro cleaves N at residue 382 in the presence or absence of pCAGGS-3Cpro-FLAG. an expression plasmid containing the N gene derived from a field isolate was constructed. this PEDV strain was isolated from a swine farm in Thailand. Western blot analysis of HEK 293T cells transfected with pCAGGS-GFP plasmids containing the cleavage sites from the nsp5-nsp6 junction (5/6) to nail down the cleavage site, we tested cleavage on AVCT12 N carrying an L381P mutation. AVCT12 N-L381P or KR N-P381L could no longer serve as a substrate for amino-acid stretch around the cleavage site from AVCT12 N (GNAKLQRK) (GFPAVCT12-382) could be cleaved, while GFP containing the 8 amino acids derived from KR N (GNAKPQRK) (GFPKR-382) was resistant to cleavage by 3Cpro. these data indicate that PEDV 3Cpro processed the nucleocapsid at Q382. nucleocapsid sequence comparisons between PEDVAVCT12 and field strains (B) or among classical PEDV strains (C). residue 381 is a conserved proline in all emerging PEDV strains in both North America and Asia. cleavable PEDV N confers a slight growth advantage to PEDV in vero E6-APN cells. to pinpoint the biological significance of the cleavage event for PEDV replication in tissue culture, we rescued PEDVAVCT12 harboring the cleavage site mutation in its N gene. DVACVT12-N-L381P showed a slight growth defect in vero E6-APN cells. growth kinetics of mCh-PEDVAVCT12 carrying wild-type or L381P mutant N as determined by RT-qPCR. D.L. denotes the detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay. lysates prepared from cells infected with wild-type mCh-PEDVACVT12 showed a distinct cleavage product of N. cells infected with the mCh-PEDVACVT12-N-L381P mutant showed a single band corresponding to full-length N. infected cells were lysed at 48 hpi and analyzed by Western blotting. hek 293T cells were transfected with the infectious clone encoding the PEDV genome, pSMART-PEDVAVCT12, and tested for PEDV N cleavage. however, only the topmost band corresponding to full-length PEDV N appeared when the supernatant containing PEDV particles was analyzed. a major band was observed between 43 and 55 kDa. the prominent cleavage band just above the 43-kDa marker appeared only in the context of infection or the expression of other viral proteins. we were inclined to believe that these smaller species of N proteins were proteolytic cleavage products, as previously reported for several coronaviruses. sorption, infection of cells was continued in infection medium containing either 100 M Z-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-FMK, a pancaspase inhibitor, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent for the inhibitor. lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PEDV N antibodies, and supernatants were analyzed for PEDV RNA contents. PEDV vRNAs were extracted from equal volumes of supernatants collected at the indicated time points and analyzed by RT-PCR with PEDV N-specific primers. data are representative of results from two independent experiments. pCAGGS-GFP5/6 was used as a substrate for PEDV 3Cpro functional assays. this plasmid encoded green fluorescent protein (GFP) harboring an 8-amino-acid natural cleavage site. pCAGGS-GFP5/6 was used as a substrate for PEDV 3Cpro functional assays. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS-3Cpro-FLAG and pCAGGS-GFP5/6. western blot analysis with anti-GFP antibodies on lysates prepared from these transfected cells revealed a smaller, fast-migrating band. cleavage product could be visualized only in presence of 3Cpro-FLAG but not 3Cpro-C144A-FLAG. we transplanted the identified cleavage site, RETTLQQH, onto GFP (GFPAVCT12-396) and tested if PEDV 3Cpro could recognize and cleave this substrate in the same manner as in the GFP5/6 construct. in the presence of 3Cpro-FLAG, GFP5/6 could be cleaved. expression plasmid containing the N gene derived from a field isolate was constructed. HEK 293T cells cotransfected with plasmids expressing 3Cpro and either AVCT12 N or KR N were probed for N cleavage with anti-PEDV N antibodies. as expected, AVCT12 N was cleaved. HEK 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS-GFP plasmids. plasmids containing the cleavage sites from the nsp5-nsp6 junction (5/6). the AVCT12 N protein around residue 382 (AVCT12382) and the KR N protein around residue 382 (KR382) were lysed and analyzed. KR N (GNAKPQRK) (GFPKR-382) was resistant to cleavage by 3Cpro. these data indicate that PEDV 3Cpro processed the nucleocapsid at Q382. this property may be associated with cell adaptability. residue 381 is a conserved proline in all emerging PEDV strains in both North America and Asia. some vaccine strains, such as attDR13 and 83P-5 (P100), and field isolates SD-M and ITA7239 possessed a proline. cleavable PEDV N confers a slight growth advantage to PEDV in vero E6-APN cells. to pinpoint the biological significance of the cleavage event for PEDV replication in tissue culture, we rescued PEDVAVCT12 harboring the mCherry coding sequence in place of ORF3. mCh-PEDVAVCT12-N-L381P shows a slight growth defect in vero E6-APN cells. growth kinetics of mCh-PEDVAVCT12 carrying wild-type or L381P mutant N as determined by RT-qPCR. GE, genome equivalents. Error bars indicate SD from duplicate infections. infected cells were lysed at 48 hpi and analyzed by Western blotting. lysates prepared from cells infected with wild-type mCh-PEDVACVT12-N-L381P mutant showed a distinct cleavage product of N. cells infected with the mCh-PEDVACVT12-N-L381P mutant showed a single band corresponding to full-length N. cleavage occurs in a strain-specific manner and confers a replication advantage in cell culture over the uncleaved PEDV variant. previous studies have shown that N proteins of other coronaviruses are similarly processed upon infection. a recent study showed that PEDV-induced apoptosis occurred via a caspase-independent pathway and did not activate the main caspase, caspase-3, and the following cascade (38). this finding is the first to illustrate the role of 3Cpro in the modification of structural proteins during coronavirus replication. the P1 and P2 positions strictly conform to the CoV 3Cpro substrate specificity. however, the P1\u2032 position is occupied by arginine and not the usual small amino acids suggested by previous reports. the PEDV 3Cpro P1\u2032 subsite on NEMO contains valine instead of small aliphatic residues. the removal of this segment might also affect normal functions of PEDV N during virus assembly. cleavage may serve as a strategy to regulate the pool of full-length N for balancing or optimizing virus production in host cells. the cleavage motif is found only in PEDV strains that are highly adapted in cell culture. an uncleaved mutant affected the growth of the virus. pSMART-PEDVAVCT12 was assembled and mCh-PEDVAVCT12-N-L381P was rescued and propagated as described previously. antibodies were obtained from commercial sources and used according to manufacturer's recommendations. mouse anti-PEDV N (Medgene Labs), rabbit anti-FLAG (Cell Science Technology), rabbit anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. the coding sequence of GFP between amino acids G190 and D191 was assembled by two PCRs. the first PCR product (N-GFP) was amplified with a forward primer harboring the MluI site. the second PCR product (C-GFP) was amplified with a forward primer harboring the N-terminal half of the cleavage site coding sequence (YGVNL) and the BsmBI restriction site. HEK 293T cells were plated to confluence in 6-well plates in Opti-MEM. infected cells were infected with variants of reverse-genetics-derived PEDVAVCT12 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Vero E6-APN cells were infected with either mCh-PEDVAVCT12 or mCh-PEDVAVCT12-N-L381P for 1 h at 37\u00b0C (MOI = 0.001) after rigorous washing with PBS, the infected cells were covered with infection medium containing a 1 final concentration of TrypLE Select. pSMART-PEDVAVCT12, reverse-genetics-derived PEDVAVCT12, and mCh-PEDVAVCT12 containing mCherry in place of ORF3 were described previously (37). mCh-PEDVAVCT12-N-L381P was assembled and mCh-PEDVAVCT12-N-L381P was rescued and propagated as described previously (37). plasmid of PEDV 3Cpro derived from junction of nsp5 and nsp6 genes (YGVNLQGG) was implanted into coding sequence of GFP between amino acids G190 and D191. plasmid was verified by sequencing. plasmids are named pCAGGS-GFPAVCT12-396 (RETTLQQH), pCAGGS-GFPAVCT12-382 (GNAKLQRK), and pCAGGS-GFPKR-382 (GNAKPQRK). infected cells were monitored daily for signs of syncytium formation as a CPE and harvested when a >80% CPE was observed. mCh-PEDVAVCT12 or mCh-PEDVAVCT12-N-L381P were plated to confluence in 6-well plates. after PBS washes, the infected cells were covered with Opti-MEM in 0.9% agar supplemented with a 1 final concentration of TrypLE select. 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 60 s. data were analyzed with CFX Manager software."}
