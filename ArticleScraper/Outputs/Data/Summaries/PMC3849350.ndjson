{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is now a major cause of lower respiratory infection in children. the low level of virus replication and the subsequent recovery of low levels of infectious HMPV have hampered biochemical studies on the virus. this experimental strategy will serve as a model system to allow the process of virus assembly to be examined. human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a new member of paramyxoviridae. clinical symptoms that are caused by HMPV infections in children are similar to those observed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. formation following the co-expression of specific virus structural proteins has been demonstrated in several paramyxoviruses [14-18] the expression of the M protein alone was insufficient for VLP production in simian virus type 5 [15] and avian pneumovirus type C [18] the use of recombinant HMPV protein expression to drive the formation of similar HMPV VLPs can potentially overcome the problems associated with poor cultivation of HMPV in tissue culture. 293T cells transfected with either pCAGGS, pCAGGS/F and pCAGGS/G were surface-biotinylated and immunoprecipitated using either anti-cmyc or anti-FLAG antibodies. pCAGGS/F-cmyc transfected 293T cells were either non-treated or non-treated. the cells were surface-biotinylated and immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-cmyc (C) Cells singly transfected with pCAGGS/F-cmyc (F), pCAGGS/G-FLAG (G) or pCAGGS (Mock) transfected 293T cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-cmyc or anti-FLAG antibodies and Immunoblotted (IB) lysates prepared from pCAGGS/M transfected cells with MAbM3F8 revealed the presence of a 28 kDa protein, the expected size of the HMPV M protein. only pCAGGS/F-cmyc transfected cells immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-cmyc or anti-FLAG showed the presence of F proteins species corresponding in size to the monomeric and oligomeric F protein. a small but discernible increase in the apparent size of the two G protein species from G60 to G70 and from G120 to G170 was noted. surface-biotinylation of HMPV-infected cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-G showed the presence of G70 and G170. this indicated modified processing of the G protein in co-transfected cells. ates were IP with anti-G, or anti-F. cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS/F-cmyc and pCAGGS/G-FLAG. detergent extracts were IP with anti-cmyc and IB with either (E) anti-cmyc or (G) anti-cmyc. 293T cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS/F-cmyc and pCAGGS/G-FLAG. cell monolayers were treated with increasing DSP concentrations. probing with anti-cmyc revealed increasing amounts of a 170 kDa FLAG-tagged protein (the expected mass of GA170 protein) the sedimentation characteristic of cross-linked F and G protein complex was examined using sucrose gradient centrifugation. cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS/F-cmyc and pCAGGS/G-FLAG and treated with 0.1 mM DSP. a detergent extract was prepared and then applied to a continuous 5-30% (w/v) sucrose gradient. after centrifugation the gradient was fractionated. HEp-2 cells co-expressing F and G proteins showed co-localisation. cells expressing either (A) the G protein or (B) the F protein were stained using anti-FLAG and anti-cmyc respectively. co-localisation was calculated using regions (white circles) within the co-transfected cells. detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-M and immunoblotted with either anti-cmyc or anti-FLAG. co-precipitation of oligomeric forms of the F protein (Figure 4A) and G protein (Figure 4B) with the M protein was detected. cells expressing the F and M proteins (FM) or F, G and M proteins (FGM) were IP with (D) anti-cmyc or (E) anti-FLAG and IB with anti-M. cells transfected with pCAGGS are indicated (pc) all three HMPV proteins were found to be present at the 20-50% sucrose density interface in FGM-transfected cells. no HMPV proteins were detected in the discontinuous step sucrose gradient prepared using the mock-transfected cells. co-expression of the F, G and M proteins leads to the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) the M protein peak fraction exhibited a slight shift (by 1 fraction) suggesting that the M protein may be associated with more than one type of membrane-bound buoyant particle. cells were transfected with pCAGGS/F-cmyc, pCAGGS/G-FLAG, and pCAGGS/M and processed as described in methods. labelled filamentous projections were detected on the surface of FGM-transfected cells. this was similar in appearance to the filamentous G protein staining pattern exhibited when HMPV-infected cells were stained using anti-G. at 7 days post-infection HMPV-infected LLCMK2 cells were stained using anti-G. in pCAGGS/G-FLAG transfected cells the G protein was detected in the total cell extract, confirming expression. similar levels of the M protein were detected in the 0-20% (w/v) and 20-50% (w/v) sucrose interfaces. the HMPV G protein facilitates virus-like particle formation by interaction with the F and M proteins. the material at the (1) 0-20% (w/v) sucrose, (2) 20-50% (w/v) sucrose and (3) 50-60% (w/v) sucrose interfaces was harvested and immunblotted using anti-FLAG, anti-cmyc or anti-M as indicated. a similar analysis was performed on FG-transfected, GM-transfected, and FM-transfected cells. a cmyc or FLAG tag epitope was placed on the C-terminus of the F and G proteins respectively to generate pCAGGS/F-cmyc and pCAGGS/G-FLAG respectively. 293T cells transfected with either pCAGGS, pCAGGS/F and pCAGGS/G were surface-biotinylated. pCAGGS/F-cmyc and pCAGGS/G-FLAG were surface-biotinylated and examined by immunoprecipitation with either anti-cmyc or anti-FLAG respectively. each surface-labelled protein was treated with PNGasF (P), EndoH (E) or non-treated (N) both G60 and G120 were Endo-H resistant, but after PNGaseF treatment the G protein was reduced to a faint protein smear. this indicated removal of the N-linked glycans, and the residual protein smear was due to heterogeneity of the remaining attached O-linked glycans. the presence of unusually high levels G protein oligomers in SDS PAGE analysis has been reported previously in avian metapneumo interaction between the HMPV F and G proteins Trypsin degradation of the G protein has been previously reported [24]. in all subsequent studies involving G protein expression the trypsin treatment was omitted. cell co-transfected with pCAGGS/F-cmyc and pCAGGS/G-FLAG. surface biotinylated cells were IP with anti-G, or anti-F. at 7 days post-infection the cells were surface biotinylated and lysates were IP with anti-G, or anti-F. the presence of the lipid membrane may be required for stabilization of the protein complex in situ. the removal of the lipid membrane by detergent extraction prior to immunoprecipitation could lead to destabilization of the protein complex. lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and immunoblotted using anti-cmyc revealed increasing amounts of F145 with increasing DSP concentration. lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and immunoblotted using anti-cmyc revealed increasing amounts of F145 with increasing DSP concentration. a cmyc-tagged protein species >300 kDa. pCAGGS/F-cmyc transfected cells stained using anti-cmyc exhibited a more punctate staining pattern (Figure 3B) in cells co-transfected with pCAGGS/G-FLAG and pCAGGS/F-cmyc and stained with anti-cmyc and anti-FLAG a high degree of co-localisation between the F and G proteins within small filamentous projections was observed. the HMPV F and G protein complex interacts with the M protein. cells were transfected with pCAGGS (pc), pCAGGS/M (M), pCAGGS/G-FLAG and pCAGGS/M (GM), pCAGGS/F-cmyc and pCAGGS/M (FM), or pCAGGS/F-cmyc and pCAGGS/M (FM) cells expressing the M protein (M), G and M proteins (GM), F and M proteins (FM) or F, G and M proteins (FGM) were IP with anti-M and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-cmyc, (B) anti-FLAG or (C) anti-M. cells transfected with pCAGGS are indicated (pc) the material at the 0-20% (w/v), 20-50% (w/v) and 50-60% (w/v) sucrose interfaces was harvested and examined by immunoblotting using anti-cmyc (Figure 5A), anti-FLAG (Figure 5B) and anti-M. the resuspended pellet from the 10% sucrose cushion was applied to a continuous sucrose gradient. after centrifugation the gradient was fractionated, and the individual fractions proteins examined by immunoblotting using anti-cmyc, anti-FLAG and anti-M. the individual fractions proteins were primarily detected in fractions 5 to 7. cells were stained using anti-FLAG and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold. surface morphology and distribution of gold label were examined. labelled filamentous projections were detected on the surface of FGM-transfected cells. the distribution of gold particles (white spots) on the filaments is shown (white arrows) the images are superimposed images obtained using the secondary electron scatter and backscatter electron detectors. at 7 days post-infection HMPV-infected LLCMK2 cells were stained using anti-G and examined at a focal plane corresponding to the cell periphery and cell top. pCAGGS/G-FLAG, pCAGGS/F-cmyc, pCAGGS/M, pCAGGS/F-cmyc, pCAGGS/G-FLAG, and pCAGGS/F-cmyc and pCAGGS/G-FLAG. a significantly higher level of M protein was detected in the 20-50% (w/v) sucrose interface. the HMPV G protein exhibits many similarities to the corresponding RSV G protein. it is heavily modified by O-linked glycosylation and can bind glycosaminoglycans. this suggests a similar role for the HMPV G protein during HMPV infection. our data suggests that expression of the G protein in the absence of other virus proteins is sufficient to form these structures. it is likely that there will be significant differences in the homeostasis in virus-infected and transfected cells which can influence virus processes. but given these caveats, we noted an overall similar morphology in the HMPV VLPs and HMPV particles. 271pCAGGf G271pCAGGf,
