{"summary": "TGEV is a member of the Coronaviridae family of viruses with positive-sense RNA genomes of around 30 kb and a common genome organization (1, 2). inside the envelope, the internal core, composed of the nucleoprotein (N) and the 28.5-kb RNA genome forming the nucleocapsid, interacts with the carboxy terminus of the M proteins (3). During infection, the viral genome is replicated by continuous RNA synthesis. gRNA packaging involves the recognition of cis-acting factors. the cis-acting PS forms stable RNA secondary structures. PSs may be located at a unique site in the viral genome or distributed at different positions along the gRNA. a dominant component of TGEV PS has been delimited to the first 598 nt from the 5\u2032 end of its RNA genome. a dominant component of TGEV PS has been delimited to the first 598 nt from the 5\u2032 end of its RNA genome. trans-acting factors could also contribute to the specificity of the gRNA packaging. the relevance of the 3\u2032-end genomic sequences in packaging and replication has been analyzed by using an experimental approach. cis-acting packaging signals in TGEV extended across a relatively large genomic region. cells were grown to 80% confluence on 100-mm-diameter plates. suspension was placed on 12-well or 60-mm-diameter plates. same number of cells per 35-mm-diameter plates was seeded. two PCR fragments containing 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-end TGEV genomic sequences were generated using the primer pair 5\u2032-AAGCTTTATGATATCTTCGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTCAAATGATGAACC-3\u2032. the primer pair 5\u2032-ATGCTGTATTTATTACAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CACGTGCTTACCATTC-3\u2032 were digested with HindIII and EcoRI restriction enzymes. the second product was EcoRI and Eco72 pcDNA L-R1-Ru-3\u2032wt included the first 598 nt from the 5\u2032 end and the last 494 nt from the 3\u2032 end of the TGEV genome. the Ru sequence flanked by SbfI and KpnI was ligated into vectors pcDNA M26-171 and pcDNA L-R1-171. in both plasmids, the Ru sequence was inserted between the viral 5\u2032-end fragment digested with KpnI was ligated into the same site of the pcDNA L-R1-Ru-3\u2032 plasmid. plasmid pcDNA L-R1SL5-Ru-GFP was generated by inserting the 494-nt sequence from the GFP gene into the SbfI and BamHI sites. the negative control for replication and packaging assays, pcDNA Ru-GFP, was obtained by blunt-end first PCR product included nt 24153 to 24883 from the TGEV genome. first 80 nt from the 3a gene downstream of the CS were included. overlapping PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes PpuMI and BlpI. the plasmid pBAC-TGEV and the primers 5\u2032-TTTGACCCCCAGAACTA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTTTTTCTTAAAGACTTTATTCATCATCATCC-3\u2032 were used as the template. the second PCR product included the sequence of fragment R1 (nt 100 to 499 of the TGEV genome) the first PCR products for R1D1, R1D2, and R1D3 were obtained with the forward primer S-4310 vs and a specific reverse primer (Table 2). the second PCR products for R1D1, R1D2, and R1D3 were obtained with the specific forward primer (Table 2) and the reverse primer BlpI-R1 rs. -loop SL5 (R1mutSL5) or partial deletion in SL5 (R1SL5) were obtained by overlapping PCR using specific primers and pBAC-TGEV-R1 as the template. in the first PCR, R1mutSL5-1 and R1SL5-1 fragments were obtained with the forward primer S-4310 vs and the specific reverse primer (Table 1). cellular RNA polymerase II transcribes defective minigenome RNA from cytomegalovirus promoter. at 18 h postinfection, one-third of passage zero supernatant was used to infect new confluent ST cells. the viral RNA is transcribed from the cDNA by cellular RNA polymerase II. to rescue infectious viruses from cDNA clones, BHK cells were treated with trypsin at 6 h posttransfection (hpt) virions were partially purified by concentration through a 15% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion.

RNA digestion was stopped with 100 U of RNase inhibitor RNasin (Promega) the viral RNA, protected inside the virions from RNase digestion, was extracted with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) DNA-free RNAs were repurified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) one-sixteenth of the RT reaction product was used in the qPCR for quantitative analysis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs from infectious recombinant TGEVs. PCR products were amplified by PCR with specific primers for genomic, defective minigenome M26 and subgenomic RNAs from recombinant TGEVs. a ChemiDoc XRS+ with Image Lab software (Bio-Rad) was used to visualize the PCR products. sgmRNA(%) = [(sgmRNA)]/[[RNA genome (cell)]] was calculated as follows: sgmRNA(%) = [(sgmRNA)]/[(genome)] replication efficiency of TGEV-derived RNAs was expressed as a percentage relative to the replication of defective minigenome M26 RNA, which was considered to be 100%. TGEV-derived defective minigenome M33 (3.3 kb) was the smallest analyzed sequence efficiently rescued (i.e., replicated and packaged) by a helper virus. other TGEV-derived defective minigenomes smaller than defective minigenome M33, such as M24, M22, M19, M17, and M15 could not be significantly rescued by the helper virus after five consecutive cell passages. cDNAs encoding M33 and M26 sequences were infected at 6 hpt. total intracellular RNA was extracted and the amount of defective minigenome RNAs was quantified by qPCR. the relative abundance of defective minigenome M33 and M26 intracellular RNA with respect to viral genome RNA was around 80%. oligonucleotides for gRNA detection hybridize at positions 4829 to 4853 and 4884 to 4909 of the TGEV genome and defective minigenomes M33 and M26. qPCR analysis of intracellular amount of RNA from defective minigenomes (mgRNA/gRNA) defined as 100%. the helper virus and the RNA sequences involved in our packaging efficiency studies are encoded by a single viral RNA. the first fragment, R1, comprised nt 100 to 598 of the TGEV genome. each fragment, R1 to R8, or the GFP gene as a negative control, was inserted into the TGEV genome in the location of the nonessential 3a/b genes. a smaller sgmRNA lacking the 3a sequence was detected. this sgmRNA contained the sequence of fragment R1 directly preceded by the leader sequence (sgmRNA L-R1) the loss of the 3a sequence preceding R1 was probably caused by a recombination event between sgmRNA L-3a-R1 and the genome leader region. a new recombinant virus was engineered by deleting the first 80 nt of the 3a sgmRNA L-R1 showed a packaging efficiency similar to that of the defective minigenome M26. the packaging efficiency of sgmRNA L-R1 was significantly higher than that of sgmRNA L-3a-R1. analysis of the RNA from purified virions by Northern blotting confirmed the presence of genomic RNA inside viral particles. sgmRNAs are present in all analyzed sgmRNAs. Arrows below gene 1a represent the oligonucleotides used for gRNA quantification. sgmRNAs include the leader (L) sequence and the 3a sequence. sgmRNAs including R1 to R8 sequences contain TGEV 3\u2032-end genomic sequences consisting of the last 122 nt of the 3b gene, the E, M, N, and 7 downstream genes, and the 3\u2032UTR. sgmRNAs L-3a-GFP and sgmRNA 3a, transcribed from the wild-type virus, were used as negative controls for packaging. five stem-loops (SL1 to -5) in the first 135 nt of the TGEV genome and four domains (D1 to -4) were identified. SL1 (nt 5 to 52), SL2 (nt 53 to 67) and SL3 (nt 72 to 83) were not considered RNA signals responsible for packaging. the other structural domains in R1, D1 (nt 137 to 366), and D4 (nt 514 to 598), containing more than one stem-loop, and domains D2 (nt 367 to 439) and D3 (nt 446 to 512) were also candidates for directing L-R1 packaging. secondary structure of L-R1 includes five stem-loops at the 5\u2032 end named SL1 to SL5. sgmRNAs (M26, sgmRNA 3a, and sgmRNA L-R1D1) quantified by qPCR and sqPCR. square symbols represent sgmRNAs L-R1, L-R1D2, L-R1D3 and L-R1D4 as quantified by sqRT-PCR. the most apical 14 nt of SL5 were deleted, leading to a smaller stem-loop. the packaging efficiency of both sgmRNAs was similar to that of the negative controls. each R1 deletion mutant was inserted in recombinant TGEV viruses. analysis of 5\u2032 genome sequences required for packaging has been addressed by using TGEV recombinant viruses transcribing sgmRNAs that contained the potential packaging signal. a new experimental approach was designed, consisting of the expression of virus-derived RNAs from transfected plasmids followed by infection with a helper virus. qPCR with the same TaqMan assay was introduced in all the constructs. defective minigenome M26-Ru-3\u2032wt was efficiently replicated and packaged by the helper virus in rescue experiments performed as described above. the values were used as the positive controls for both viral processes. defective minigenomes M26-Ru-171, L-R1-Ru-3\u2032wt, and L-R1-Ru-171 were very similar, around 45% relative to the packaging of gRNA. the results indicated that replication of defective minigenomes by the helper virus was not necessary for packaging. a schematic comparison of the structures of defective minigenomes is shown on the top. L-R1-Ru-3\u2032wt and L-R1-Ru-3\u2032 defective minigenomes were engineered by deleting the last 494 nt of the 3\u2032 end of L-R1-Ru-3\u2032wt. packaging efficiency of both defective minigenomes was around 45%, while L-R1-Ru-3\u2032 packaged to a lower extent, around 30%. the last 494 nt of the 3\u2032 end of the TGEV genome are divided into two boxes, as indicated in Fig. 4. the vertical line in the L-R1SL5-Ru-GFP defective minigenome indicates the partial deletion of the SL5. TGEV-derived defective minigenome M33 (3.3 kb) was the smallest analyzed sequence efficiently rescued (i.e., replicated and packaged) by a helper virus after eight consecutive cell passages (11) other TGEV-derived defective minigenomes smaller than defective minigenome M33 could not be significantly rescued by the helper virus after five consecutive cell passages. cDNAs encoding M33 and M26 sequences were infected at 6 hpt with the helper virus, TGEV PUR46-MAD. total intracellular RNA was extracted and the amount of defective minigenome RNAs was quantified by qPCR. oligonucleotides for gRNA detection hybridize at positions 4829 to 4853 and 4884 to 4909 of the TGEV genome. defective minigenomes M33 and M26 hybridize at the linker sequence and nt 28200 to 28232 of the TGEV genome. EV recombinant viruses transcribing engineered sgmRNAs. the first fragment, R1, comprised nt 100 to 598 of the TGEV genome. each fragment, R1 to R8, or the GFP gene as a negative control, was inserted into the TGEV genome in the location of the nonessential 3a/b genes. the loss of the 3a sequence preceding R1 fragment was probably caused by a recombination event between sgmRNA L-3a-R1 and the genome leader region. to obtain a unique sgmRNA including the continuity between the leader and the R1 sequence, a new recombinant virus was engineered by deleting the first 80 nt of the 3a gene previously inserted between the leader and the genome leader region. sgmRNA L-R1 showed a packaging efficiency similar to that of the defective minigenome M26. the packaging efficiency of sgmRNA L-R1 was significantly higher than that of sgmRNA L-3a-R1. analysis of the RNA from purified virions by Northern blotting confirmed the presence of genomic RNA inside viral particles. Arrows below gene 1a represent the oligonucleotides used for gRNA quantification by semiquantitative RT-PCR. this region includes the TRS of the 3a gene, comprising the 5\u2032 TRS of the 3a gene, the conserved core sequence (CS) and the first 80 nt of the 3a gene used for sgmRNA quantification (3a) sgmRNAs including R1 to R8 sequences contain TGEV 3\u2032-end genomic sequences consisting of the last 122 nt of the 3b gene, the E, M, N, and 7 downstream genes. SPTV, spike gene of the Purdue type strain was used as a positive control. sgmRNAs L-3a-GFP and sgmRNA 3a, transcribed from the wild-type virus, were used as negative controls for packaging five stem-loops (SL1 to -5) in the first 135 nt of the TGEV genome and four domains (D1 to -4) were identified. SL1 (nt 5 to 52), SL2 (nt 53 to 67) and SL3 (nt 72 to 83) were not considered RNA signals responsible for packaging because they are part of the leader sequence. the other structural domains in R1, D1 (nt 137 to 366) and D4 (nt 514 to 598) were also candidates for directing L-R1 packaging. secondary structure of L-R1 includes five stem-loops at the 5\u2032 end named SL1 to SL5 and four domains, D1 to D4. the diamond symbols represent sgmRNAs (M26, sgmRNA 3a, and sgmRNA L-R1D1) quantified by qPCR and sqPCR. square symbols represent sgmRNAs L-R1, L-R1D2, L-R1D3 and L-R1D4 as quantified by sqRT-PCR. the most apical 14 nt of SL5 were deleted, leading to a smaller stem-loop. the packaging efficiency of both sgmRNAs was similar to that of the negative controls. each R1 deletion mutant was inserted in recombinant TGEV viruses. a new experimental approach was designed, consisting of the expression of virus-derived RNAs from transfected plasmids followed by infection with a helper virus. at 3 hpt, one of the plates was infected with the helper virus, TGEV PUR46-MAD. at 23 hpi, total intracellular RNA from infected and noninfected cells was extracted and analyzed by qPCR. defective minigenome M26-Ru-3\u2032wt was efficiently replicated and packaged by the helper virus. a nonreplicating version of defective minigenome M26, M26-Ru-171, was constructed by deleting nt 28388 to 28559 of the TGEV genome. this deletion prevents defective minigenome replication by the helper virus (11) efficiencies of defective minigenomes M26-Ru-171, L-R1-Ru-3\u2032wt, and L-R1-Ru-171 were very similar, around 45% relative to the packaging of gRNA. the results indicated that replication of defective minigenomes by the helper virus was not necessary for packaging. ome L-R1-Ru-3\u2032wt was engineered by deleting the last 494 nt of the 3\u2032 end of L-R1-Ru-3\u2032wt. packaging efficiency of both defective minigenomes was around 45%, while L-R1-Ru-3\u2032 packaged to a lower extent, around 30%. however, the 3\u2032-end sequences of the TGEV genome contributed to optimize packaging. the white box (3\u2032) represents the deletion of the last 494 nt of the 3\u2032 end of the TGEV genome. the vertical line in the L-R1SL5-Ru-GFP defective minigenome indicates the partial deletion of the SL5. the data are the averages from five independent experiments. a major motif of TGEV PS has been delimited to the first 598 nt of the genomic 5\u2032 end using a single-component system consisting of recombinant TGEV viruses that transcribed sgmRNAs. the continuity between the leader sequence (nt 1 to 99) and downstream sequences (nt 100 to 598) in the PS was required for packaging, since structural requirements frequently determine packaging in RNA viruses. sgmRNAs are most frequently located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome. a 291-nt region in ORF1b was also described as the PS of BCoVs, belonging to the same genus, Betacoronavirus, as MHV. this RNA motif is not required per se for RNA packaging and virus viability. defective minigenomes L-R1-Ru-3\u2032wt and L-R1-Ru-171, containing the 598 nt from the 5\u2032 end and different 3\u2032-end sequences, were not competent for replication. the last 494 nt of the TGEV genome 3\u2032 end were not necessary for packaging. 26- and R1-derived sequences were around 45% with respect to gRNA. it is possible that additional viral sequences distributed along the genome might also be involved in TGEV packaging. however, other RNA factors have been involved in genome packaging in other viral systems. the identification of the TGEV PS could be of interest for the development of biosafe packaging-deficient viral vectors. the identified PS might represent a new target for antiviral therapies, as described for HIV (38\u201340) and hepatitis B virus (41)."}
