{"summary": "a ban on travel over distances >50 km and 20 km would drastically reduce the speed and geographical spread of outbreaks, even when compliance is 100%. the result was found to be robust for different rates of intermunicipality transmission intensities. study applied a version of the Hufnagel model to Sweden in order to predict the effect that travel restrictions might have on the geographical spread of an outbreak. we used survey data on all intermunicipal travel, including all forms of travel, to estimate the effect that travel restrictions might have on the geographical spread. a random survey carried out by Statistics Sweden from 1999 to 2001. a total of 17000 individuals took part in the survey, constituting 71.9% of the selection. a total of 34816 distinct intermunicipal trips were reported. in the first level, we used the complete intensity matrix. in the following two, we removed data corresponding to journeys >50 km and journeys >20 km, respectively. the datasets are displayed as geographical plots. the time between two events, t, is random, taken from an exponential distribution, t Exp(1/Q) (1) where Q is the total intensity, the sum of all independent transmission rates. the component j,i in (2) is the intermunicipal infectiousness corresponding to the one-way route j to i. based on data from the actual outbreak, = 0.27. the parameter is influenced by the total travel intensity, the medium of travel and as we have seen, the propensity for travel in different communities. we compared Hufnagel's estimate with other possible values. the results for all nine scenarios were plotted geographically and color-coded according to the mean incidence. in SIM50 and SIM20, all journeys > 50 km and 20 km, respectively, have been removed. only the incidence differed. 1.7 1.6 1.8 0.72 0.67 0.76 Intermunicipal infections (n) 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 Incidence after 60 days (n) 77 184 72 760 81 784 37 065 34 941 39 321 15 240 14 307 16 190 Percentage of population 0.9 0.8 0.9 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.17 0,16 0.18 Afflicted municipalities (n) 26 there are 289 municipalities in Sweden and the population is approximately 8.9 million. there are 289 municipalities of key interest SIM SIM50 SIM20 Municipality Mean 95% SI Mean 95% SI Mean 95% SI Stockholm 18 563 17470 19645 13 231 12437 14066 6029 5653 6412 G\u00f6teborg 730.7 654.4 813.9 - - - - - - - - Malm\u00f6 338.6 295.4 390.2 - - - - a selection of municipalities with the mean incidence and simulation intervals with extinction runs filtered out. after Stockholm, G\u00f6teborg and Malm\u00f6 are the largest cities in Sweden. the single most traveled route is that between Stockholm and Huddinge, traveled by approximately 37 000 people each way. travel restrictions confer increasing protection on cities further from the capital. the farthest the disease woudl ever make it in SIM50 is Ljungby, 1471 km from Stockholm. a surface plot shows incidence after 60 days with the parameters of compliance and distance restrictions. the surface has its highest values at high set distance limit and low compliance. this holds true for all three levels of intercommunity infectiousness, simulated. a positive effect for in the proposed range will be underestimated for areas with frequent traffic across the borders. this includes the resund region around Malm\u00f6 and to a lesser extent, international airports and the small towns bordering Norway and Finland. the model and results are robust and there is no reason to believe that the results are not generally applicable to any country or region. the results are robust and there is no reason to believe that the results are not generally applicable to any country or region. the correct data were irretrievable but the effect of their absence was deemed within the margin of error for long-distance journeys. some authors refer to this as the \"attack rate\" although this is not the commonest definition. Dies_out.wmf shows the common event of the epidemic not catching on but rather dying out within a few days. all these realizations have been aborted after 60 days."}
