{"summary": "suckling mice were isolated from homogenates of the brains of bats by direct intracranial (i.c.) inoculation of 3-day-old mice. no further identification or characterization was conducted until this study. suckling mice were inoculated i.c. with the supernatant of clarified brain homogenate. the 2 groups (n = 8 for each) inoculated with B58 and GB30 displayed clinical signs after 42 h postinoculation (hpi) the control group with buffer only (n = 8) displayed no clinical signs. analysis of the nt sequence identity varies from 88.6% to 99.3%. the bat JEV isolates have the same 5\u2032 NTR as the others. the 3\u2032 NTRs of the bat JEVs have a G insertion at nt 307. similar phylogenetic trees were obtained based on other gene sequences, such as PrM. derivative 1954 China AF315119 III SA-14 Mosquito 1954 China AF315119 III SA-14 Mosquito 1959 Japan AF069076 III JaOArS982 Mosquito 1998 Japan AB051292 I JaOArS982 Mosquito 1982 Japan M18370 III K87P39 Mosquito 1987 South Korea AY585242 III K94P05 Mosquito 1994 Taiwan AF221499 III BN19 Mosquito 1982 China FJ185038 III Li LD50 for suckling mice was 8.0 log10/0.02 mL, compared with 3.5 log10/0.02 mL for the mosquito strain M10. all residues important for virulence and neurotropism were conserved between the bat JEV isolates and the Nakayama strain. the 2 JEV strains most closely related to the bat viruses were all isolated from Yunnan Province, LiYujie from a human in 1979 and BN19 from mosquitoes in 1982. the same virus is circulating in hosts of at least 4 different species (human, mosquito, and 2 different bat species)"}
