{"summary": "human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread human -herpesvirus with seroprevalence from 40 to 100%. HCMV is a major viral cause of mental retardation and sensorineural deafness in newborns. HCMV is a major viral cause of mental retardation and sensorineural deafness in newborns. the early immune response is a pivotal time for the host to defend against HCMV infection. the early immune response is a pivotal time for the host to defend against HCMV infection. CD147/EMMPRIN is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. it is involved in neural function, pro-inflammation, tumor invasion, and metastasis. extracellular CypA has been reported to induce proinflammatory cytokines through direct binding with the ectodomain of CD147. U251 MG cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1-CD147 plasmid or the pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector control plasmid. after 48-h incubation, transfected cells were selected for resistance in cell culture medium containing 600 g/mL G418. each was plated separately. HCMV WT, mUS25-1-5p, and RvWT were propagated in HFF cells. the bacteria harboring the rescued BACs were selected by electroporation. the BAC of mUS25-1-5p was generated based on the newly constructed. p65 (Ser536) rabbit mAb (#3033, CST), and anti-GAPDH mouse mAb (60004-1-Ig, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA) plasmids used: CD147 pLKO.1 lentiviral shRNA (A6) and non-target shRNA control plasmid (pLKO.1-NTC) were purchased from Open Biosystems (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA, USA) on the pmirGLO-CD1473\u2032UTR to generate a pmirGLO-CD1473\u2032UTRm plasmid with the following primers. cells that were grown on chambered cover slips were infected with HCMV strain NR-1 at a multiplicity of infection ( psPAX2 and pMD2G were co-transfected with the two packaging plasmids. the sequence for CD147 shRNA was: 5\u2032-CCCATCATACACTTCCTTCTT-3\u2032 (siCD147); the sequence for HCMV-miR-US25-1-5p shRNA was: 5\u2032-CCGCTCAGTGGCTCGGACC-3\u2032 (miR-US25-1-5p) after 24 h, cells were incubated e activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activities. all of the reporter assays were repeated at least three times in triplicate. data shown are average values standard deviation (SD) from one representative experiment.

HCMV mutant (mUS25-1-5p) and the revertant wild type (RvWT) were generated using a bacterial recombineering method. approximately 300 bp of the miR-US25-1 flanking region was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. PCR-amplified products containing point mutations of miR-US25-1-5p were used in the second round of recombination. anti-HCMV IE1/2 mouse mAb (ab53495, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-human CyPA mAb (ab3563, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221) rabbit mAb (#9154, Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA, USA), Erk1/2 rabbit mAb (#4695, CST), phospho-IRF-3 (Ser396) rabbit m pmirGLO-CD1473\u2032UTR plasmid was made by inserting the 3\u2032 UTR of the human CD147 gene into the pmirGLO empty vector using primers. site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. hyde and blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. cells were stained with primary mouse IE1/2 antibody (ab53495, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), then incubated with the secondary antibody Dylight 594 anti-mouse IgG (Life Technology) images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) d on 12-well plates and the following day were transfected using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) and the indicated plasmids were added to each transfection. the total amount of transfeced DNA was maintained at a consistent level by adding empty vector DNA. cells were lysed with 200 L passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 30 s, 45 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 5 s and 60 \u00b0C for 34 s. unknown sample values were determined with a standard curve of known copy numbers of UL83 (NR-1 BAC) and RNase P. each set of assays was repeated three times in triplicate. HCMV miR-US25-1-5p (MirBase, MIMAT0001581), miR-US25-1-3p (MirBase, MIMAT0004755), and 13 other screened HCMV-encoded mature microRNAs were synthesized. the siRNAs were transfected into cells using lipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) supernatants were collected at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. proteins were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. membrane was rinsed 3\u20135 times for 5 min with TBST. titers of the viral stocks were prepared with the total cells. the medium was harvested 3 to 11 days post-infection by adding an equal volume of 10% (w/v) skim milk. the number of plaques were counted 10 to 14 days after viral infection. CD147 knockdown significantly reduced activation of NF-B and IFN- promoters. knockdown of CD147 expression in HFF cells decreased activation of IFNB1 and interferon-stimulated ISG15 gene expression induced by HCMV infection. luciferase assay analyzing NF-B and IFN- promoter activity in siControl or siCD147 stable U251 cells (2 105) transfected for 36 h with a plasmid encoding an NF-B or IFN- firefly luciferase reporter (0.1 g) then left uninfected (UI) or infected for 6 h with HCMV or HSV-1. CD147 mediated HCMV-triggered antiviral signaling via sCyPA-CD147 interaction activated ERK/NF-B pathway. however, CD147 had no significant effect on HCMV entry, either when tested with a function-blocking antibody against CD147 to inhibit HCMV infection. quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Cyclophilin A (CyPA) mRNA expression kinetics in HFF cells at different time points post-HCMV infection. Western blot analysis of secreted CypA protein levels and intracellular CypA (inCypA) in total protein lysates in culture mediums of HFF cells at the indicated times post HCMV infection. phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), NF-B p65 subunit (p-p65) and IRF3 (p-IRF3) were increased in response to HCMV infection when compared to mock infection with the medium only. however, when endogenous CD147 expression was knocked down by lentiviral-based transduction of CD147-specific short hairpin RNA (siCD147), HCMV-induced phosphorylation levels of a pmirGLO luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 3\u2032 UTR sequence of human CD147 downstream of the firefly luciferase gene was generated. the most likely target site for miR-UL25-1-5p was identified by RNAhybrid in the 3\u2032 UTR region of CD147. luciferase reporter plasmid pmirGLO-CD1473\u2032UTR was tested. the 14 putative HCMV mimics are described in the abbreviations. the predicted hybrid free-energy of miR-US25-1-5p is indicated. miR-UL25-1-5p mimic was transfected with a non-targeting control siRNA (NC) or miR-UL25-1-5p mimic. compared to cells that were transfected with a non-targeting control siRNA (NC) or miR-UL25-1-3p mimic, the CD147 protein level was appreciably reduced after the transfection of the miR-UL25-1-5p mimic. miR-US25-1-5p and CsA appeared to have redundant roles in the inhibition of the CD147-mediated early innate immune response to HCMV infection. these findings suggest that miR-US25-1-5p could function as a CD147-specific short hairpin RNA to inhibit the CD147-mediated early innate immune response to HCMV. mutant HCMV (mUS25-1-5p) by HCMV BAC mutagenesis. mutants were constructed by substituting only three nucleotides of the seed sequence of miR-US25-1-5p. a revertant virus (RvWT) was constructed as a control. the values obtained were averages SD from triplicate experiments. HCMV-mUS25-1-5p and ectopic expression of CD147 were determined by plaque assay. R-US25-1-5p targeting of CD147 might promote the course of HCMV Lytic propagation at low MOI. CD147-specific short hairpin RNAs (siCD147) targeting the 3\u2032 UTR of cellular CD147 mRNA, and two non-specific RNAi stable cells as controls (siControl) CD147 is involved in human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-triggered early antiviral response. CD147 is involved in human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-triggered early antiviral response. expression plasmid for wildtype CD147 (CD147-WT) or mutants (CD147-dECD and CD147-dICD) (0.1 g), then left uninfected (UI) or infected for 6 h with HCMV before the luciferase assays were performed (MOI = 0.5); and, c) quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of IFNB1, ISG15, IL-6 mRNA levels of CypA expression were gradually up-regulated after HCMV infection. both inCypA and sCypA were highly expressed at 12 post-infection (hpi), followed by a gradual increase in expression level with prolonged HCMV infection. phosphorylation activation of ERK1/2 induced by HCMV infection for 6 h (MOI = 0.5) with the culture medium, pre-supplemented with cyclosporine (CsA) (5 g/mL) or CD147 mAb (50 g/mL) transcription factors p65 and IRF3 play key roles in induction of cellular antiviral responses. HCMV infection triggers the secretion of CyPA, which then activates the phosphorylation of ERK and downstream NF-B through interaction with CD147. HCMV miR-US25-1-5p Targeted and Down-Regulated CD147 Due to the potential role that CD147 may play in HCMV early antiviral signaling. 147 downstream of the firefly luciferase gene was generated. the most likely target site for miR-UL25-1-5p was identified by RNAhybrid in the 3\u2032 UTR region of CD147 mRNA. the most likely target site for miR-UL25-1-5p was identified by RNAhybrid. luciferase reporter pmirGLO-CD1473\u2032UTR (WT) or pmirGLO-CD1473\u2032UTRm (MUT) for 36 h before dual luciferase reporter assay. miR-US25-1-5p (5p), but not miR-US25-1-3p (3p) specifically down-regulates endogenous CD147 in U251 cells transfected as indicated and harvested two days after transfection. miR-US25-1-5p stably transfected HFF cells were constructed using the lentiviral-based transduction method. the expression of CD147 obviously decreased in miR-US25-1-5p transduced cells. knockdown of the CD147 expression by miR-US25-1-5p could specifically reduce the activation of IFNB1 and interferon-related gene ISG15 and the NF-B downstream genes IL-6 and TNF-induced by HCMV early infection miR-US25-1-5p inhibits CD147-mediated early innate immune response to HCMV. the mutants were constructed by substituting only three nucleotides of the seed sequence of miR-US25-1-5p. a revertant virus was constructed as a control. DNA3.1-CD147 stably-transfected U251 cells for at least 14 days. mutation of miR-US25-1-5p or ectopic expression of CD147 can delay HCMV lytic propagation at low MOI. a) Schematic construction of HCMV mUS25-1-5p and the revertant wild type. HCMV-mUS25-1-5p in control U251 cells and HCMV-WT in CD147 overexpressing U251 cells showed similar growth kinetics. at higher MOI, no differences in virus yield were observed in cells infected with the HCMV mutant virus miR-US25-1-5p. CD147/EMMPRIN is a transmembrane receptor glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. it is expressed at varying levels in many tissue cells. several bacterial pathogens, including HIV-1, HBV, SARS-CoV, and measles virus, have been previously found to infect target cells via CD147. endogenous CD147 is required for the maximum activation of NF-B and IFN--associated antiviral signaling that is triggered by HCMV infection. many tumor-related proteins, such as Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and PTEN, are known to play key roles in regulating the innate immunity against viral and bacterial infection. HCMV-encoded miR-US25-1-5p targeting CD147, CD147-blocking mAb, and an inhibitor of CyPA (CsA) can specifically inhibit this process. the modulation of the host immune microenvironment is not only important for tumor virus-induced inflammatory carcinogenesis, but also critical for persistent and latent viral infection. miR-US25-1-5p targeting of CD147 is biologically significant. at least 26 mature miRNA species encoded by 14 pre-miRNAs have been identified. miR-US25-1-5p is transcribed upon infection and highly expressed at 24 hpi. HCMV-encoded miR-US25-1-5p targets a non-HCMV receptor glycoprotein. HCMV-induced paracrine effects of the HCMV-induced expression of CypA could cause an immune microenvironment called \u201csmoldering inflammation\u201d."}
