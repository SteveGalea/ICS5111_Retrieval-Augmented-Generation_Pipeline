D198911); rabbit polyclonal anti-cytochrome c (1:2,000; catalog no. D110006) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA) the crude extract was chromatographed on a NKA-II column (Sigma-Aldrich) and eluted with 50% (v/v) ethanol to collect the fractions. the supernatant was lyophilized to yield the crude sample. the cells were fixed with 25% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and washed and stained with 0.4% SRB. cell growth inhibition was expressed as a percentage of the untreated control absorbance following the subtraction of the mean background absorbance. the fixed cells were washed and stained with a PI solution containing 20 g/ml PI and 10 mg/ml RNase. the stained cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and the FACSCalibur system. mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared in order to detect cytochrome c. the mitochondrial pellet and cytosolic supernatant were separated using a centrifuge (model no. 5415C; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). monoclonal anti-caspase-3 (1:3,000; catalog no. D120074); mouse monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax; 1:3,000; catalog no. D120073); rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax; 1:3,000; catalog no. D198911); rabbit polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (1:3,000; catalog no. sc-2768) antibodies a total of 150 g dried fruiting bodies of C. militaris were cleaned with distilled water, dried in a dark and ventilated place and crushed prior to soaking in 500 ml distilled water overnight at room temperature. the filtrate (crude aqueous extract) was concentrated in a rotary evaporator (model no. 0010001820; IKA\u00ae Works Guangzhou, Guangzhou, China) the precipitate obtained subsequent to filtration was discarded and the the cells were inoculated into 96-well microplates when the cell concentration was adjusted to 1105 cells/ml for 24 h. the cells were fixed with 25% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and stained with 0.4% SRB. apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry HepG2 cells cultured with or without cordycepin at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. the fixed cells were washed and stained with a PI solution containing 20 g/ml PI and 10 mg/ml RNase. with antibodies in PBST at 4\u00b0C, the membrane was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. equal loading was confirmed by probing with an antibody against -actin. mitochondrial pellet and cytosolic supernatant were separated using a centrifuge. cordycepin inhibits proliferation of HepG2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. the IC50 values for HepG2 cells treated with cordycepin for 24 h were 7353.67, 497.52.49, 3851.93 and 307.51.54 M. apoptotic cells treated with various concentrations of cordycepin for 48 h showed an apoptotic hypodiploid sub-G1 peak in a concentration-dependent manner. cordycepin-induced apoptosis signaling pathway Cordycepin increased the expression levels of Fas and FADD, but had no effect on FasL expression. a decreased level of cytochrome c was detected in the mitochondrial fraction and an increased level was detected in the cytosolic fraction. the results also showed that HepG2 cells treated with cordycepin for 48 h underwent significant cleavage of precaspase-9 and precaspase-3. fraction A was 252.1096 Da, which corresponds with the m/z of standard cordycepin. the retention time of fraction A was 10.5 min, which corresponds with the retention time of cordycepin. HepG2 cells were fixed and stained with DAPI and PI staining. the nuclear morphology of the cells was then examined with a fluorescence microscope. Cytoplasmic shrinkage and nuclear condensation were observed. cordycepin-induced apoptosis signaling pathway increased expression levels of Fas and FADD. level of procaspase-8 decreased, while level of caspase-8 was elevated. expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins was also detected. from crude extract, termed A and B, were eluted using NKA macroporous resin. Fraction A was then purified on a HPLC preparative column followed by an analytical column using CH3OH:H2O = 15:85 (v/v) as the mobile phase. the retention time of fraction A was 10.5 min, which corresponds with the m/z of standard cordycepin. fluorescence microscopic examination with DAPI staining revealed that morphological changes occurred in HepG2 cells subsequent to being treated with cordycepin for 48 h. effects of cordycepin on the sub-G1 proportion of HepG2 cells. metric analysis with JC-1 staining showed respective green fluorescence intensity ratios were 5.72, 18.58, 32.12 and 36.65% respectively. apoptotic HepG2 cells treated with cordycepin for 48 h underwent significant cleavage of precaspase-9 and precaspase-3. cordycepin plays a key role in cancer therapy and induces apoptosis in numerous cells by targeting molecules and pathways (20\u201322) studies investigating the induction of apoptosis by cordycepin are currently available (21,22) apoptosis occurs via either the extrinsic (receptor-dependent) or the intrinsic (mitochondria-dependent) pathway. each involving caspase activation occurs via either the extrinsic (receptor-dependent) or the intrinsic (mitochondria-dependent) pathway. spase-8 is crucial for triggering apoptosis via the death receptor pathway and its activation requires the binding of death ligands to death receptors. caspase-8 may act as an upstream initiator and the extrinsic pathway was involved in cordycepin-induced apoptosis. the Bcl-2 family proteins play an essential role in apoptotic progress. cordycepin-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells may be initiated by the FADD mediated signal pathway and regulated by the Bcl-2 family proteins that can change the alternation of mitochondrial membrane permeability. it has been shown that cordycepin is an analogue of adenosine (22). cyto C, cytochrome c."}
