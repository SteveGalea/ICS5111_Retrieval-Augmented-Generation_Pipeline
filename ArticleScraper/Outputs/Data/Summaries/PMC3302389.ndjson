{"summary": "exogenous lentiviruses infect species in four mammalian orders: Primates, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora. lentiviruses exhibit narrow tropisms with no cross-order and highly limited cross-species infection. lentiviruses have evolved counterdefenses to restriction. carnivorans comprise over 260 species of placental mammals. they group phylogenetically into two suborders, the Feliformia (Felidae, Hyaenidae, Herpestidae, and others) and the Caniformia (Canidae, Ursidae, Pinnepedia, Mustelidae, etc.) vif-chimeric HIV-1 clones encode FIV Vif in cis replicated in such cells, too. the domestic cat genome can supply the dependency factors needed for HIV replication, which is a fundamental difference from the mouse. the domestic cat genome can supply the dependency factors needed for HIV replication. the fetal lung cell line, FtAEpC, was recently derived as described previously. one vector encoded hCD4 plus neo (G418 resistance) and the second encoded hCXCR4 plus pac (puromycin resistance) cell lines were selected and maintained in 1 mg/ml G418 and 1 g/ml puromycin. mononuclear cells were purified by Ficoll centrifugation and maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.05 mM -mercaptoethanol, phytohemagglutinin E (PHA-E; 2 g/ml) and human interleukin-2 (IL-2). cells were counted and lysed to assay for luciferase activity. centrifugation over a sucrose cushion in an SW32Ti swinging bucket rotor at 25,000 rpm for 2 h and then resuspended in 300 l of PBS. the rest of which was directly lysed in Laemmli buffer with -mercaptoethanol. control supernatants from uninfected cells were collected and processed the same way. 3 105 entry receptor-complemented cells were infected in six-well plates. the cells were washed 24 to 36 h later with DMEM five times to remove input virus. supernatants were sampled every 2 to 4 days for p24 measurements. the reverse primer was KpnIFelFerCypA (5\u2032-ATATGGTACCTTAGATYTGTCCACAGTCAGCAATGG-3\u2032) the primers were described by McEwan et al. (47, 48), i.e., gex8 feT5f, and gex8 feT5r, MATGAARAGAAYKTATAGATGAGAAACC. twenty micrograms of lysate was boiled in Laemmli buffer with -mercaptoethanol for 10 min and then electrophoresed in 12% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) the blocked membranes were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (Ab) anti-CypA (Santa Cruz rabbit polyclonal 133494) at 1:250 and then washed with Tris-buffered saline\u2013Twe the sequence of exon 8 of ferret TRIM5 gene from ferret (Mpf and FtAEpC) cells was deposited in GenBank under accession no. JQ048543. HIV-1 entry receptor-expressing stable Mustelidae cell lines. cell surface expression was verified by flow cytometry using mouse anti-hCXCR4 (RD Systems) and anti-hCD4 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen; phycoerythrin and fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC] conjugated. luciferase activities were determined by lysing cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1%) and Tween 20. human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified by ficoll centrifugation of cells eluted from apheresis machine leukoreduction system chambers. at day 5, cells were counted and lysed to assay for luciferase activity as described above. at day 5, cells were collected, centrifuged, and lysed for immunoblotting. TRIP-luc was constructed by exchanging firefly luciferase for gfp in TRIP-green fluorescent protein. p24 antigen was measured using a 32P-based RT assay. eight to 10 independent clones for each virus were sequenced. cloning of cyclophilin A (CypA) cDNA and ferret TRIM5 exon 8 sequences. cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% NP-40, 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Boehringer) 20 micrograms of lysate was boiled in Laemmli buffer with -mercap ferret primary mononuclear cell lysates and supernatants were electrophoresed in 10% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred over 1 h to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore) membranes were incubated overnight with primary anti-p24 (mouse monoclonal, Abcam 9071) at 1:2,000 and then washed with TBST three times for 7 min each. luciferase activities equaled or exceeded those of human cells infected with the same inputs. similar results were observed when primary human PBMC and primary ferret mononuclear cells obtained from spleen, bone marrow. curves for the three Mustelidae are colored gray. Error bars represent standard deviations of duplicate measurements. cell lysates from equal numbers of cells were assayed for activity 72 h later. mouse cells showed previously well-established assembly block to HIV-1. mice showed previously well-established assembly block to HIV-1. mouse cells showed robust HIV-1 p24 production similar to that of human cells. the Mustelidae cells were then challenged with HIV-1 NL4-3 (2) and two variants of NL4-3, HIV-1VS and HIV-1VH (62). HIV-1VS uses a separation of the normally overlapping integrase and vif reading frames to encode the Vif protein of SIVmac (62) cell lysates from equal numbers of cells were assayed for luciferase activity 72 h later. productive replication of wild-type HIV-1 NL4-3, HIV-1VH, and HIV-1VS was observed in ferret but not mink cells. replication experiments were serially passaged 4 times on GHOST cells. the numbers above the curves reflect the total passages on both ferret lines. the numbers in the symbol keys refer to the number of passages on both ferret lines. virions produced in these cells were still less infectious per unit of p24 antigen than were virions produced in human cell lines. cleotide segment was found at the 5\u2032 end of vif in 8/10 clones. this was likely due to the duplication of 5\u2032-GGAAAACAG-3\u2032 (56, 62) at the 5\u2032 end of vif in the input virus. a significant number of plus-strand C-to-T mutations were observed (45, versus 161 G-to-A changes) capsid mutations selected in unstructured CypA binding loop of HIV-1 CA. H87Q and A92T were present in 10 of 10 and 9 of 9 sequenced clones. two coding changes arose in the cyclophilin A (CypA) binding loop. 2-tailed t test was used to determine P values for comparisons of the titers of WT virus with each of the capsid mutants. all calculated P values were 0.05 except for the comparison of WT and H87Q/A92T mutants in FtAEpC cells. sequencing and determination of the predicted amino acid sequence did not reveal significant differences in the known HIV-1 capsid-interacting regions (13, 20, 71). infectious titers of HIV-1 GFP vector were determined in the presence and absence of 5 M CsA for owl monkey kidney (A), Mpf (B), and FtAEpC (C) cells. polymporphism is evident in the two ferret sequences; they differed at 10 nt. besides T5I there were only two other predicted amino acid differences, A26S and R37H. to complete the analysis with respect to the capsid mutants, VLP saturation experiments were performed in ferret cells. the absence of postentry capsid-targeting defenses against lentiviruses is consistent with the apparent lack of an intact Trim5 or TRIMCyp gene in this species. the absence of postentry capsid-targeting defenses against N-MLV and lentiviruses is consistent with the apparent lack of an intact Trim5 or TRIMCyp gene in this species. TRIM5 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that binds lentiviral capsids. it catalyzes the cis/trans isomerization of the G89-P90 peptide bond in the HIV-1 capsid protein (11). it promotes infectivity in human cells (25, 61, 66) but is in contrast necessary for Trim5 restriction in rhesus macaque and africa green monkey cells (7) mutation at this residue, A92E, is known to arise when HIV-1 is passaged in HeLa cells in the presence of CsA, thus conferring CsA resistance. this phenomenon was later shown to reflect high levels of CypA in some cell lines. this phenomenon was later shown to reflect high levels of CypA in HeLa cells (70) ferret-genome-project suggests further characterization of HIV-1 adaptation in ferret cells and delineation of Mustelidae restriction factor gene repertoires are warranted. potentials for developing an eventual HIV-1 animal model, for gaining basic insights into mechanisms of species-specific retroviral restriction, and for exploring the extent to which HIV-1 will evolve."}
