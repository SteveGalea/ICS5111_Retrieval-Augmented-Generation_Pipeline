{"summary": "genetic drift is defined as stochastic fluctuations in frequencies of alleles in a population. large populations are less stochastic and undergo less genetic drift than smaller populations. studies aimed at separating the role of the immune response still find a significant influence of genetic drift in evolution of animal viruses. genetic drift of HIV-1 within an infected individual is several orders of magnitude larger than would be predicted from the total number of infected cells in the body [17],[18],[19],[20],[21]. Several models have been proposed to explain the observed high genetic drift, including multiple selective sweeps [22], metapopulation structure [23],[24] and rare but severe population bottlenecks [25]. vpr-FS and Vpr-FS-StuI clones are mixed in 11 ratio. the mixture is serially diluted and used to infect multiple replicates. cultures are scored as positive (black circles) or negative (white circles) for HIV infection. the experimental scheme we used to determine the relationship between population size and genetic drift is shown in Figure 1B. serial 3-fold dilutions of a 11 viral mixture of neutral variants were prepared and used to infect multiple independent cultures of target cells to create HIV populations of different sizes. all cultures were maintained for 5\u201314 days until most of the cells in virus-positive cultures were infected. variants must have been caused by genetic drift. at the lowest viral dilution, only a single variant was observed in each of the five infected cultures. 7 of the cultures were not infected at this dilution. the variance caused by this drift was calculated from the initial allele frequency p and viral population size N as and plotted on Figure 2B as the thin dashed line. for all tested population sizes, the observed variance in frequency of neutral allele was approximately an order of magnitude higher than Videal, demonstrating that viral populations do not behave as ideal populations. EMx174 cells differ from C8166 cells morphologically, require the presence of DEAE-Dextran for robust HIV infection, and produce smaller amounts of virus after infection than C8166 cells. the observed variance Vtotal of Vpr-FS-StuI frequency in HIV populations infecting CEMx174 cells was also significantly higher than Videal. this suggests that higher than expected genetic drift is a common property of the virus replication process. Target cells Condition Fold increase of Vtotal over Videal (SE) 1 Fold change in Vtotal compared to Vtotal in standard C8166 infection (CI) 4 3A C8166 Standard 10.5 (4.5) 1 (NA) 3B CEMx174 Standard 22.7 (13.9) 1.44 (1.25, 1.66)2 3C C8166 and CEMx174 Mixture of two cell types 10.1 (4.2) 1.00 (0.88, 1.13) 3D PBMCs Standard 1 we measured Vpr-FS-StuI variance in cultures where the virus mixture was bound to the Raji-DC-SIGN cells prior to the addition of target C8166 cells. the cells were then mixed with the target C8166 cells to mediate infection in trans. Vtotal under these conditions was only 4.5 fold higher than Videal. B. Raji-DC-SIGN cells were mixed with target cells and infected. C. Infections were synchronized. Virus mixture was incubated with target cells for 1 hour. after 15 hours viral replication was blocked by addition of nevirapine. cell-free virus was collected 48 hours later, cells were washed to remove nevirapine and resuspended in fresh media. genetic drift was similar to genetic drift in synchronized cultures after multiple rounds of viral replication. the infection was synchronized by washing off non-bound virus after one hour of incubation. the continuing rounds of viral replication were blocked by addition of antiviral drug nevirapine to the final concentration of 5 uM at 18 hr post-infection. Neither Vpr-FS nor Vpr-FS-StuI has an advantage for replication in culture, i.e. the variants are selectively neutral. thus, by mixing these two variants in a 11 ratio we created a population of HIV with a known neutral allele present at a 50% frequency. dilutions containing positive and negative wells are used to calculate TCID50, which provides the measure of viral population size. all cultures were maintained for 5\u201314 days until most of the cells in virus-positive cultures were infected. at that point, the cell-free virus from virus-positive wells was collected and analyzed by the GeneScan assay. the observed Vpr-FS and Vpr-FS-StuI frequencies in each set of replicates were used to calculate the average variance of the observed frequency from the expected 50%. Variance in frequency of Vpr-FS-StuI was calculated from data shown in panel A. each point corresponds to average variance in frequency of Vpr-FS-StuI from initial 50%, adjusted for contribution from assay variability. for all tested population sizes, the observed variance in frequency of neutral allele was approximately an order of magnitude higher than Videal. the variance was repeated a total of five times with different viral dilutions. for viral populations infecting C8166 cells, the estimated variance was significantly higher than Videal for all population sizes. we infected a mixture of the two cell types, CEMx174 and C8166. the results showed that the amount of genetic drift under these conditions was similar to the amount observed in infections of cultures containing either C8166 or CEMx174 cells alone. the results were similar to those obtained with immortalized cell lines. 3D PBMCs Standard 11.7 (4.2) 1.08 (0.89, 1.33) 4A C8166 Virus pre-bound to Raji-DC-SIGN 4.5 (1.0) 0.69 (0.59, 0.82)3 4B C8166 Mixture of C8166 and Raji-DC-SIGN 8.8 (5.4) 0.95 (0.82, 1.11) 4C C8166 Synchronized 2.8 (0.6) 0.52 (0.44, 0.61)3 4 infecting C8166 cells, the estimated variance, to which we refer here as Vtotal, was significantly higher than Videal for all population sizes. each point corresponds to average variance in frequency of Vpr-FS-StuI from initial 50%. the expected variance for an ideal population is shown as straight dashed line. we compared Vtotal observed under different conditions to Vtotal in C8166 infection. infections of CEMx174 cells resulted in statistically higher genetic drift than infections of C8166 cells. 4D C8166 Synchronized, single cycle 2.7 (1.0) 0.60 (0.51, 0.70)3 1 Fold increase was averaged for all population sizes in all experiments. SE is standard error. 2 Variance is significantly greater than the variance of the standard C8166 condition. the simple presence of Raji-DC-SIGN in culture did not affect genetic drift of HIV. we hypothesized that binding of the virus to virus-presenting cells and removal of the unbound virus resulted in increased synchronization of timing of infection, which caused reduction in genetic drift. virus was incubated with target cells for one hour, after which the unbound virus was removed by three washes with media. the increase was significantly lower than increase in non-synchronized infections of C8166 cells. similar results were obtained when the virus was incubated with cells for 3 hours, or when it was pre-bound to C8166 target cells at 8C. these two conditions did not find a statistically significant difference in observed variance. these data are consistent with the idea that the majority of genetic drift in viral populations occurs during the first cycle of replication. genetic drift over one cycle of viral replication determined the amount of genetic drift in the population due to exponential growth of viruses in culture. individual virions do not contribute to the next generation unless they infect a target cell. the number of infected cells, therefore, is a better measure of population size. but the fact that a single cell can be infected by more than one virion adds some confusion. the latter problem was avoided by starting experiments at low multiplicity of infection (0.05), which makes double-infection unlikely. synchronization removes the \u201clate\u201d viral population and the total size of viral population becomes much closer to the size of the \u201cearly\u201d population. but even in synchronized infections, genetic drift is higher in HIV populations than in an ideal population. the factors that we proposed to explain increased genetic drift of HIV in culture should play similar, or even larger, roles in HIV populations in patients. there, infections should be less synchronized than in culture and the individual differences should be larger than in cell lines or highly stimulated PBMCs that we used in our experiments. PBMCs were activated prior to infection by phytohemeagglutinin A (10 ug/ml) and interleukin-2 (10 U/ml) for 3 days. aliquots were mixed in several ratios by volume and used to infect C8166 cells at multiplicity of infection 0.1. p24 antigen in cell-free media was monitored by the amount of p24 antigen in cell-free media using a p24 detection kit (NCI-Frederick) and QuantaBlu Fluorogenic Peroxidase Substrate kit (Pierce). TCID50 units were converted into infectious particles per milliliter by multiplying TCID50 by 0.7. virus-containing media was lysed by addition of 0.04% Triton X-100. the RT step was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min followed by an RT-inactivation step (95\u00b0C for 15 minutes) and two-step PCR amplification for 25 cycles. the variance in Vpr-FS-StuI frequency was calculated as, where n is the number of cultures, p 0 is the frequency of Vpr-FS-StuI in culture n at the end of experiment. pn is the frequency of Vpr-FS-StuI in culture n at the end of experiment. EMx174 cells expressing secreted alkaline phosphatase were a kind gift of Dr. Desrosiers. all non-adherent cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7% bovine growth serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. the results were used to measure the ratio of Vpr-FS to Vpr-FS-StuI in each mix. the 50 L aliquots of the mixture were stored at 80\u00b0C. two independent mixtures were created and used for all experiments described here. an infectious center assay was used to measure the number of infected cells in a well after infection. cells were washed to remove any non-bound virus, serially diluted and mixed with 4105 non-infected cells in 6 replicates for each dilution. the total number of infected cells in the original cell population was calculated similar to TCID50 calculation. pr-FS-StuI have different length and appear as distinct peaks. the area of each peak is calculated by the PeakScanner and is proportional to the relative amount of each PCR product. the majority of the variance is contributed by the first generation. variance functions and generalized linear models were used to test for differences in fold-change between the variance of each experimental condition in relation to the variance of the C8166 experiment [29] the same test was conducted comparing the variance from the synchronized experiment to the single cycle experiment."}
