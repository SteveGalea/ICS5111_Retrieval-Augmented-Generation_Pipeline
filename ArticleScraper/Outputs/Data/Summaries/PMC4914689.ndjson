{"summary": "the rise of antibiotic resistance is now a major global health crisis. there are several multidrug-resistant bacterial strains that are threatening to become entirely untreatable in the near future. for viral pathogens, limited antiviral drugs are available, and they are of diminishing utility due to increasing viral drug resistance. the removal of ubiquitin moieties by deubiquitinase enzymes is crucial for fine-tuning ubiquitin-mediated cellular processes. ubiquitination and deubiquitination are integral in the immune response to many pathogens. a broad-spectrum anti-infective therapeutic ideally would be effective against diverse pathogens. compound 9) can promote anti-infective activity in macrophages. the well-characterized lead compound activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) in macrophages, thereby inhibiting intracellular replication of MNV and norovirus norwalk virus in replicon-containing cells. we used the MNV and L. monocytogenes infection models to test a library of 39 new small-molecule DUB inhibitors that are structurally related to the lead compounds WP1130 and G9. one of these, the 2-cyano-3-acrylamide compound C6 (Fig. 1B), promotes inhibition of intracellular replication of MNV-1 and L. monocytogenes. fetal bovine serum [HyClone], penicillin-streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% l-glutamine, 1% l-glutamine, 1% l-glutamine, 1% l-glutamine, 1% l-glutamine, 1% l-glutamine, 1% l-glutamine, 1% l-glutamine, 1% l-glutamine, 1% lysates were tested by plaque assay for viral titer as described previously. an overnight 2-ml liquid culture of Listeria monocytogenes strain 10403S was inoculated. ed, added to 3.5 ml distilled water, and vortexed for 12 s to lyse RAW cells. samples were plated on LB agar plates to enumerate intracellular CFU. bacteria were grown to optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5. immunodetection was performed using an anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (P4D1 clone; Santa Cruz) or an anti-actin monoclonal antibody (ACTN05; Thermo Scientific) the intensity of the signal for ubiquitin was quantified using ImageJ software and normalized against actin signal intensity. cell washed three times with warm DPBS. medium containing no antibiotics was added to cells with either DMSO or C6. cells were washed two times with warm DPBS. test compounds were tested for toxicity in cell culture using the reagent and resazurin cell viability assay kit (30025-1; Biotium) 5 106 RAW cells were plated in a 24-well plate and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. a metabolic stability assay was performed by the University of Michigan Pharmacokinetics Core (54, 55). male CD-1 liver microsomes were purchased from XenoTech and were stored at 80\u00b0C prior to use. a master mix containing microsomes, phosphate buffer, and NADPH solution was prepared. lution was used with mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) the flow rate was 0.4 ml/min, and the injection volume was 5 l. a short pharmacokinetics study was performed by the University of Michigan Pharmacokinetics Core. all compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), aliquoted, and stored at 20\u00b0C. all compounds with a chiral center were racemic mixtures. RAW cells were plated in 12-well plates (3513; Costar) at 5 105 cells per well. incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were treated for 30 min with compounds at the indicated concentration. overnight culture of bacteria in BHI was diluted to 109 CFU/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to infection, medium was replaced with warm medium containing test compounds at the indicated concentrations with no antibiotics (DMEM-Abx) cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. medium then was removed and replaced with DMEM containing L. monocytogenes at an MOI of 1 (or 0.1) samples were incubated for 18 h at 37\u00b0C with continuous shaking at medium speed for 18 h and plotted on a linear scale with Prism6 software. protein extraction, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. the deubiquitinase inhibitory activity of compound C6 was tested using the Usp9x catalytic domain assay and the hemagglutinin (HA) labeling assay. inside-out immunofluorescence microscopy for L. monocytogenes was performed. coverslips were washed 3 in TBS-TX (TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100), the secondary antibody Alexa-Fluor 488 (R37116; Molecular Probes) was added for 20 min, and then washed again 3. at least 75 cells were visualized for single (intracellular) or double (extracellular) antibody staining. absorbance at 440 and 600 nm (A440 and A600) was taken after 30 s of shaking. absorbances from blank wells (no cells) were subtracted from the A440. then the A600 was subtracted from all samples. the reaction was stopped with the addition of a 4 volume of cold acetonitrile containing 40 nM CE105. the solution was spun by centrifugation at 3,500 g for 15 min to precipitate protein. the supernatant was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) i.v. injection was given at 10 mg/kg of body weight, and p.o. administration was at 30 mg/kg. plasma concentration of compound C6 then was analyzed by mass spectrometry. scaffold of lead compound WP1130 or G9 was to identify new DUB inhibitors with reduced cellular toxicity and increased anti-infective activity. first, we screened all 39 compounds in RAW cells for cytotoxicity of each compound. none of the 39 compounds reduced RAW cell viability significantly below 80% with a 5 M pretreatment (30 min) followed by an 8-h incubation. two of the 39 small-molecule compounds reduced intracellular growth of MNV-1 and Listeria monocytogenes in RAW 264.7 cells similar to parental compound G9. treatment with compounds C6 and E3 resulted in a reduction of greater than 2 orders of magnitude in viral replication and greater than 50% reduction in bacterial growth compared to levels for vehicle-treated cells. compound C6- and E3-treated cells resulted in 28.3% and 29.2% bacterial growth after 8 h compared to vehicle-treated cells. both C6 and E3 were significantly less toxic to RAW cells in cell culture during the equivalent 5 M 30-min pretreatment. we characterized the DUB inhibitory activity of this candidate compound using an HA-labeled ubiquitin DUB activity assay and immunoblot analysis. treatment with 5 M or 10 M compound C6 resulted in DUB inhibition similar to that of the lead compound WP1130 (Fig. 3A) the immunoblot antibody recognizes both poly- and monoubiquitinated proteins and thus reveals a snapshot of the total state of cellular protein ubiquitin modification. treatment with C6 resulted in increased ubiquitination of multiple protein targets compared to untreated and vehicle-treated cells. compound C6 exerts a dose-dependent effect on the in vitro growth of L. monocytogenes 10403S in BHI broth culture. compound C6 exerts a dose-dependent effect on the in vitro growth of L. monocytogenes 10403S in BHI broth culture. three different strategies for testing the effects of compound C6 on RAW 264.7 cell viability. strategy 1, constant exposure; strategy 2, pretreatment only; strategy 3, varied exposures (higher pretreatment and lower concentration for duration, mimicking infection protocol) h exposure resulted in complete cell death. cell viability was reduced at the lower concentration of 2.5 M. no significant effect on cell viability observable at 8 h (>80% viability) and 60% cell viability. we repeated in vitro infection assays with lower C6 pretreatment (2.5 M) and longer drug exposure time (1.0 M) established in previous section to see if maintaining the presence of the drug in culture might inhibit pathogen replication over a long time course. no difference in the number of infectious MNV-1 particles in either vehicle- or C6-treated cells was observed at 1 and 4 h postinfection. fewer viable L. monocytogenes organisms were observed in C6-treated RAW cells as early as 30 min postinfection. inhibition of intracellular replication was more prominent at 8 h postinfection. bacterial growth rates varied between the two conditions across the course of infection. the process of deubiquitination in host cells is especially important during the early response to macrophage infection. a decreased rate of pathogen internalization in C6-treated RAW cells was contributing to lower replication of intracellular pathogens. the light-sensitive virus assay established previously (48) distinguishes between incoming and newly replicated virions. compound C6 does not affect uptake of MNV-1 into RAW 264.7 cells. ns, not significant by Student's two-tailed t test. cells were pretreated with 2.5 M compound C6 or DMSO (vehicle), washed, and then infected with bacteria at an MOI of 1 for 30 min with no compound present. cells then were washed with warm PBS, medium containing no antibiotics was added, and cells were incubated for 30 min. cells were fixed and stained with fluorescently labeled anti-Listeria antibody two times, both before and after cell permeabilization. compound C6 had a half-life of approximately 20 min in liver microsomes. by comparison, compound G9 has a microsome stability half-life of 42 min (52), almost twice as long as that of C6. a newly generated library of 39 small molecules in macrophage cell culture was tested against two intracellular pathogens. the new group of 39 compounds fall into two general classes: 2-cyano-3-acrylamide and 2-cyano-3-acrylamide bioisosteres. none of the 39 compounds reduced intracellular viral and bacterial replication significantly below 80% with a 5 M pretreatment (30 min) followed by an 8-h incubation. we performed in vitro infection assays to determine the anti-infective efficacy of the 39 compounds. AW 264.7 cells similar to parental compound G9 were also included. treatment with compounds C6 and E3 resulted in a reduction of greater than 2 orders of magnitude in viral replication and greater than 50% reduction in bacterial growth compared to levels for vehicle-treated cells. compounds C6 and E3 are identical in molecular structure except for the halogen substituent on the pyridine ring. compound number 25 in Table S1 is identical to compound C6 except for one additional chlorine on the pyridine moiety. compound number 25 in Table S1 is identical to compound C6 except for one additional chlorine on the pyridine moiety. the uppermost band in Fig. 3A shows that both WP1130 and C6 almost entirely abrogated DUB activity of proteins with molecular masses of >250 kDa. some additional protein bands in the 50- to 100-kDa range also were inhibited by compound C6 but have not yet been identified. treatment with 1.0 M C6 resulted in increased ubiquitination of multiple protein targets compared to untreated and vehicle-treated cells. the highest levels of total protein ubiquitination were seen at the earliest time point posttreatment (0.5 h) compound C6 exerts a dose-dependent effect on the in vitro growth of L. monocytogenes 10403S in BHI broth culture. in the process of drug discovery, the problem of toxicity to host cells is an important parameter to consider. the upper panels show cell viability at 8 h (B) and 24 h (C) of incubation according to strategy 1. the lower panels show cell viability according to strategies 2 and 3 for 8 h (D) and 24 h (E) pretreatment with 2.5 M did not reduce cell viability at 8 or 24 h. pretreatment with 5.0 M caused slightly reduced cell viability at 8 h. compound C6 returned to cell culture at 1.0 M. replication in C6-treated cells averaged less than 1% of that of vehicle-treated cells. this is consistent with inhibition of viral replication described for the lead compounds WP1130 and G9. bacterial infection kinetics may be observed at higher resolution by infecting with fewer bacteria (MOI of 0.1) no significant difference in viable bacteria was observed at 30 min postinfection, but significant differences were observed at 4, 8, 17 and 24 h postinfection. -sensitive virus assay established previously (48), which distinguishes between incoming and newly replicated virions. briefly, viral particles are loaded with neutral red dye, which cross-links to the viral RNA genome upon exposure to light. cells then were exposed to fluorescent light for 20 min to inactivate viral particles that had not internalized and/or uncoated. the graph represents a compilation of three independent experiments with two replicates per experiment. no PFU were detected for samples done entirely in the light. ns, not significant by Student's two-tailed t test. ization, with two different secondary antibodies, and then examined via fluorescence microscopy for differences in quantity of internalized (single stain with second color) versus extracellular (double staining) bacteria. not all cell-associated bacteria are internalized by RAW cells within 1 h under normal conditions. for cells treated with C6, there was roughly one internalized bacterium per three noninternalized bacteria. compound in vivo had a half-life of approximately 20 min in liver microsomes. by comparison, compound G9 has a microsome stability half-life of 42 min (52) by comparison, compound G9 has a microsome stability half-life of 42 min (52) library of 39 small molecules target the activity of DUB enzymes. they are structurally based on the lead compound WP1130 and its derivative compound, G9 (46) the library was predominantly composed of molecules with a central 2-cyano-3-acrylamide pharmacophore. one or two of the uncharacterized DUBs inhibited by C6 is UCH-L1 (25 kDa) and/or USP14 (56 kDa) both proteins are targets of the lead compound WP1130 (48, 59) and are involved in numerous biological processes, such as cellular proliferation (60), oxidative stress (61), inflammasome assembly (32), and others. a key concept to consider is that both intracellular pathogens investigated here have a native tropism for the macrophage. these two pathogens have the ability to circumvent the normal inflammatory, antimicrobial host activity of macrophages under certain conditions. a key aspect in drug discovery is the consideration of the chemical and bioavailability properties of the compounds. a small-molecule DUB inhibitor can improve the ability of RAW cells to restrict intracellular replication of two very different pathogens, one viral and one bacterial. this drug-targeting strategy and others like it will be vitally important for the future of infectious disease intervention."}
