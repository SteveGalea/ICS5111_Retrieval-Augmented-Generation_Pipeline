{"summary": "CSFV is a small enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 12.3 kb. the RNA genome contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) coding for a polyprotein, flanked by a 5-untranslated region (UTR) the polyprotein is processed into 11 mature proteins, including four structural proteins (C, Erns, E1 and E2) and seven nonstructural proteins. the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) constitutes 1% to 4% of the total soluble proteins in actively dividing cells [16,17] eEF1A contains three well-defined domains: the domain I binds to GTP; the domain II binds to the aminoacyl end of aa-tRNA; the domain III is linked to actin binding. human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) and west Nile virus (WNV) use eEF1A as cofactor for viral transcription, translation and assembly. the HIV-1 Nef protein enhances the resistance to stress-induced apoptosis in primary human macrophages. precipitation assay was performed with HEK293T cells overexpressing 3Flag-tagged NS5A and Myc-tagged eEF1A. eEF1A was found to coprecipitate with the 3Flag-tagged NS5A. the 3Flag-tagged NS5A was shown to coprecipitate with myc-eEF1A. pGBKT7-p53 (BD-p53) and pGADT7-T (AD-T) were cotransformed into Y2HGold strain. all the yeast colonies cotransformed with the above plasmids were grown on synthetically defined (SD) medium lacking His and Leu (SD/-2), SD medium lacking His, Leu, Trp and Ade (SD/-4) and SD/-4 medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-ind HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids (+) or empty vectors (-) for 48 h. the transfected cells were cotransfected with p3Flag-NS5A and pMyc-eEF1A. cell lysate was collected at 48 h post-transfection (hpt) the position of the nucleus is indicated by DAPI (blue) staining in the merged image. samples were imaged and magnified 630 times on the leica SP2 confocal system fitted with a 63 objective lens. the domain I of eEF1A is critical for the interaction with NS5A. the viral genome copies in the PK-EGFP-eEF1A cells were also reduced at 48 and 72 hpi, compared with the PK-EGFP cells. eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication. titers in eEF1A-overexpressed cells expressed as 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/mL. p-values were indicated above the bars. recombinant lentiviruses expressing short hairpin RNA were generated and transduced into PK-15 cells. PK-15 cells transduced with the lenti-sheEF1A or lenti-NC for 24 h were infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 48 h or 72 h. eEF1A- and NS5A-mediated inhibition of the CSFV IRES activity in a dose-dependent manner. plasmids p3Flag-NS5A (0, 0.25, 0.5 or 1 g) and pLXSN-T7 (0.75 g) were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. eEF1A did not antagonize the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A. luciferase reporter plasmids pFluc/IRES/Rluc (0.75 g) and pLXSN-T7 (0.75 g) were cotransfected into HEK293T cells with or without p3Flag-NS5A and pMyc-eEF1A. Western blotting was performed using anti-Flag (1:1000) and anti-Myc (1:500) antibodies. eEF1A binds to the CSFV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) HEK293T cells were transfected with pMyc-eEF1A or pMyc-NS5A. the cell lysate was incubated with the biotinylated CSFV IRES. glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay performed with HEK293T cells. results showed GST-NS5A but not GST interacts with eEF1A. coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed with HEK293T cells. eEF1A is an interacting partner of the CSFV NS5A protein. pGBKT7-NS5A (BD-NS5A) was cotransformed with pGBKT7-NS5A (BD-NS5A) as a bait. pGBKT7-p53 (BD-p53) and pGADT7-T (AD-T) were cotransformed into Y2HGold strain. the bound proteins were subjected to sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (10%) and Western blotting using the anti-GST polyclonal antibody (PAb) (1:2000) and the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:1000); (C) Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis of myc-tagged eEF1A and Flag-tagged NS5A HEK293T cells were cotransfected with p3Flag-NS5A and pMyc-eEF1A. cells were fixed at 48 hpt and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence assay. overexpression of eEF1A suppresses the CSFV growth. PK-15 cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing EGFP-eEF1A or EGFP, followed by infection with CSFV at a multiplicity of infection. eEF1A monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:2000) and a mouse anti-Npro polyclonal antibody (PAb) (1:500) were harvested and evaluated for the viral genomic copy numbers by real-time RT-PCR. the viral replication was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, virus titration and Western blotting. CSFV titers increased after eEF1A knockdown in PK-15 cells. eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication. eEF1A reduced translation efficiency of CSFV IRES. luciferase reporter assay used to examine effects of eEF1A on NS5A-mediated inhibition of the CSFV IRES activity. plasmids pMyc-eEF1A or/and NS5A were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. luciferase reporter plasmids pFluc/IRES/Rluc and pLXSN-T7 were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. the reporter gene activity was detected and presented as fold induction. Western blotting was performed using a mouse anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. competitive RNA pulldown assay indicated that the association of eEF1A with the CSFV IRES could be inhibited by the unlabeled CSFV IRES. results demonstrated that eEF1A binds to the CSFV IRES and inhibits its activity. eEF1A was identified as a novel NS5A partner and a negative regulator of CSFV replication. eEF1A was identified as a novel NS5A partner and a negative regulator of CSFV replication. inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A indicates that eEF1A may bind to distinct parts of the IRES. the nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could modulate cell cytokinesis and proliferation via interacting with eEF1A. eEF1A also interacts with the nucleocapsid protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and regulates the virus replication. eEF1A binds to aa-tRNA among mammalian RNA species. interaction between eEF1A and the 3-terminal stem-loop of the WNV genomic RNA facilitates the viral minus-strand RNA synthesis. the swine eEF1A gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pMyc vector to generate p3Flag-NS5A or pMyc-NS5A. the primers for amplifying eEF1A and NS5A genes are listed in Table 1.
