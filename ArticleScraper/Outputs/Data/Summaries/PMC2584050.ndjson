{"summary": "multi-protein profiling of gastric fluids, obtained from the anatomic site of pathology, could reveal diagnostic proteomic fingerprints. proteomic features were compared by significance analysis of microarray algorithm and two-way hierarchical clustering. five-year survival rates for gastric cancer are considerably lower than all major cancers except cancers of the liver, pancreas and esophagus. early stage gastric cancer has a much better prognosis (5-year survival approximately 90%) than advanced gastric cancer (5-year survival 3\u201310%). global mortality from gastric cancer should decrease substantially by measures that result in downstaging of tumors at the time of initial diagnosis. gastric fluid consists of a mixture of secreted soluble and exfoliated cellular proteins from the entire gastric mucosa. the proteome is likely to be less complex but enriched in disease-specific biomarkers, being generated directly at the disease site. the same biomarkers may be diluted beyond the limits of detection and admixed with other more abundant systemic proteins. the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Singapore General Hospital. initial analysis was performed on a training set of 19 samples from histologically proven gastric adenocarcinomas. the mean age of 19 gastric cancer patients (13 male, 6 female; 17 Chinese, 2 Indian) was 68 years. stage II (4 patients), stage III (2 patients) and stage IV (12 patients) one patient in the validation set declined further investigation. the mean age of 29 non-cancer patients was 47 years. chips were analysed by SELDI-TOF-MS (PBSII, Ciphergen Biosystems Inc) cancers and controls were intermingled and run concurrently on the same chip and on multiple chips. retentate map was generated in which individual proteins were displayed as separate peaks on the basis of their mass to charge ratio. aligned peaks with signal to noise ratios above 3 were normalized by total ion current. a second batch of 53 blinded samples were added to the data set for hierarchical clustering using the Ciphergen Express Data Manager software. the results of the clustering were simply compared against the true identity of the samples. pepsinogen C and alpha-defensin 1\u20133 concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) each processed sample was assayed in duplicate for pepsinogen C and defensin levels. clinical samples Gastric fluids were obtained during gastroscopy of overnight fasted patients seen at the Singapore General Hospital. initial analysis was performed on a training set of 19 samples from histologically proven gastric adenocarcinomas. mean age of 19 gastric cancer patients (13 male, 6 female; 17 Chinese, 2 Indian) was 68 years. AJCC clinical staging was stage I (5 patients), stage II (4 patients), stage III (2 patients) and stage IV (12 patients) one patient in the validation set declined further investigation. the mean age of 29 non-cancer patients was 47 years. ized metal Affinity Capture (IMAC3) in the presence of 100 l of 1 mol/L urea, 1 g/L 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 0.3 mol/L KCl, protease inhibitor cocktail. 100 l of 50 mmol/L TrisHCl, 1 g/L CHAPS, protease inhibitor proteomic features were analyzed using the significance analysis of microarrays software from Stanford University. the software estimated a false discovery rate (also defined in reference [16] for each threshold value. the false discovery rate was set to be less than 0.05 in this study. a second batch of 53 blinded samples were added to the data set for hierarchical clustering using the Ciphergen Express Data Manager software. pepsinogen C and alpha-defensin 1\u20133 concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) each processed sample was assayed in duplicate for pepsinogen C and alpha-defensin levels. the primary antibody against H. pylori (1:50 dilution; DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) was followed by the secondary antibody polymer link and visualized using diaminobenzidine as chromogen. results Multiple up- or down-regulated protein biomarkers in gastric cancer were discovered in gastric fluid. 46 proteomic features were found to be significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer. 60 proteomic features were significantly up-regulated in gastric cancer. most of the gastric cancer cases were clustered together to form a distinctive group. the intensity of the grayscale indicates the degree of relative protein level, higher or lower than the median value. most gastric cancer patients are tightly clustered together. nine of 36 non-cancer samples in the training set clustered with the cancer samples. gastric cancer patients were significantly older (mean age 67.7 years) than patients with benign gastric conditions (mean age 56.6) to address the possibility that protein profiles were related to age or ethnicity, we re-analyzed data of the subset of Chinese patients above 55 years of age. the up-regulated triplet markers in cancer patients were identified to be alpha defensin-1,2,3. intensity scatter plots show highly significant differences in the mean intensities of defensin and pepsin fragment. ELISA performed on the same sample set for defensin levels showed higher concentrations in gastric cancer samples. ation peptide 35 >28 2187.12 FLKKHNLNPARKYFPQW Pepsin A activation peptide 18 >26 2040.03 LKKHNLNPARKYFPQW Pepsin A activation peptide 47 >26 1628.84 LKKHNLNPARKYF Pepsin A activation peptide 40 >28 1880.92 LRTHKYDPAWKYRF pepsinogen C activation peptide 31 > in non-gastric cancers e.g. raised CEA and MG7-Ag levels are common in colorectal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and even in healthy controls [40,23]. such serum tumor markers have no established role in gastric cancer diagnosis and screening, although they may serve as prognostic indicators. pepsinogen A and pepsinogen C activation peptides were down-regulated in gastric fluids removed from stomachs with histologically confirmed adenocarcinomas. a study of cryostat sections of gastric cancer has also reported significant down-regulation of pepsinogen C, identified by MS/MS, in tumor tissue [51]. sins 1\u20133 was higher in colorectal cancer than in normal colon [58,59] and correlated with tumor invasiveness in bladder cancer [60]. alpha-defensins 1 and 2 were among five prominent proteins in urine samples of patients with transitional cell bladder cancer [61], 62,63. protein fingerprinting of gastric fluid achieves high sensitivity and specificity because it does not rely on a single marker. many cancers share the same markers e.g. CEA, CA19-9, transferrin and alpha1-antitrypsin. a future large cohort study is needed to confirm these results. a future large cohort study is needed to confirm these results. processing; MFH, WHN and SYK performed ELISA validation experiments; MPK reviewed historical histopathological records. pre-publication history The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/1/54/prepub Supplementary Material Additional file 1 Differentially expressed 106 marker peaks in gastric cancer and benign gastric fluids."}
