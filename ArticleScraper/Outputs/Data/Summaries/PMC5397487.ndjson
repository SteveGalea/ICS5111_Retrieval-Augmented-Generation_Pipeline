{"summary": "TMUV-infected adult animals showed symptoms of hemorrhagic ovaritis and acute egg drop syndrome, high fever, anorexia, diarrhea, ataxia, weight loss and paralysis. avian Tembusu virus (ATMUV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus of family Flaviviridae. the young flocks are more vulnerable to ATMUV infection, characterized by similar clinical symptoms including anorexia, diarrhea, high fever and severe neurologic dysfunction. ATMUV was easily detected in ovaries and theca folliculi of infected animals. innate immune system recognizes viruses invasion via specific pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to sense pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by viruses. Activated PRRs then interact with adaptor proteins such as interferon- promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1), MyD88, and TRIF. the IFITM proteins are the distinct restriction factors known to block viral entry. it has been shown that gene cluster IFTIM1, 2, and 3, the immune-related genes, are critically involved in immune defense against a broad variety of viruses. it has been shown that gene cluster IFTIM1, 2, and 3, the immune-related genes, are critically involved in immune defense against a broad variety of viruses. avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 serve as the critical components of host innate immune defense against ATMUV infection. overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 could strongly inhibit the replication of ATMUV. twenty five 7-day-old mule healthy ducklings were challenged with 0.4 mL of CJD05 (the 5th passage allantoic fluid virus, ELD50 = 106.0/mL) per duckling by intramuscular injection. each group of randomly selected ducklings was sacrificed at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection (hpi) the cDNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR using TransStart Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen) and PCR using rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) the primers specific for chicken -actin, IFN-a, IFN-, IFN-, and ATMUV E gene have been previously described (Chen et al., 2016a).

DF-1 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. transfected DF-1 cells were infected with ATMUV CJD05 and harvested at indicated times. DF membranes blocked with 5% (w/v) milkpowder in Tris-buffered saline (pH7.4, TBS) for 2 h at room temperature. membranes were incubated with indicated primary antibodies for 2.5 h at room temperature. incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature. DF-1 and 293T cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in DMEM. DF-1 and DEF were infected with ATMUV CJD05 as previously described. each group of three randomly selected ducklings was sacrificed at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. quantitative real-time RT-PCR and RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and duckling spleen tissues. equal amount of RNA (4 g) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio) the primers specific for chicken -actin, IFN-a, IFN-, IFN-, and ATMUV E gene have been previously described.

DF-1 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. qRT-PCR was performed to determine interference efficiency and mRNA expression of viral genes in DF-1 cell lines at indicated times after infection. western blotting DF-1 cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 1 complete protease inhibitor cocktail for 30 min on ice. cell lysates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to PVDF membranes and blocked with 5% (w/v) milkpowder in Tris-buffered saline (pH7.4, TBS) for 2 h at room temperature. viremia (101.25 TCID50/0.1mL) was observed in serum samples from 1 to 3 dpi. no virus was detected in other tissues including brain, pancreas, and liver. all the ducklings in control group were healthy and no viral antigen was detected. the role of IFITMs in defending against ATMUV infection has not been well-defined in any avian species. we examined the expression profile of IFNs and IFITMs in parenchymal organs of ducks infected with ATMUV. the results showed that ATMUV has higher replication in duckling spleen tissues. FNs and IFITMs expressions in bursa of fabricius were slightly increased with the highest levels at 12 hpi and then declined. expression of IFNs and IFITM family is strongly upregulated in duck in response to ATMUV infection. ATMUV replicated well in DEFs with an obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) characterized by cell shrinking, rounding and detachment at 48 hpi. analysis of IFA showed that viral antigens were detected in DEF cells at 24\u201348 hpi. expression of IFN- and IFN- was increased by about 700- and 340-fold at 48 hpi. qRT-PCR analysis was performed to examine the mRNA expression of duck type I and type III IFNs (C\u2013E) and IFITM1, 2, 3 (F\u2013H) mRNA levels were normalized to the endogenous -actin level and the expression at 0 hpi was set to 1.0. expression at 12\u201348 hpi was compared to its expression at 0 hpi. qRT-PCR was performed to determine the relative mRNA expression of indicated IFNs (A\u2013C) and IFITM (D\u2013F) genes compared with that without IFN treatment. DF-1 cells were treated with chicken IFNs (500 IU/mL) for 0, 16, or 24 h. DF-1 cell lines expressing specific shRNA targeting each of these IFITMs were infected with ATMUV and harvested at indicated times (24, 36, and 48 hpi) the specific shRNAs caused decreased expression of IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 after ATMUV infection, respectively. DF-1 cell lines expressing specific shRNAs were infected with or without ATMUV. qRT-PCR was performed to measure interference efficiency of the shRNAs. mRNA levels were normalized to the endogenous -actin level. titers in cell culture supernatants were determined by TCID50 assay. flag-tagged IFITM proteins were expressed well in DF-1 cells. overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 suppressed ATMUV replication in DF-1 cells. mRNA expression of viral genes in DF-1 cells expressing exogenous IFITMs was set to 1.0. avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 were involved in cellular restriction of ATMUV infection. chicken and duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins could be divided into five domains reflecting their hydrophobicity and conservation. avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 sequences are distinct from those of mammalian species. a maximum-likelihood tree was generated between chicken/duck IFITM1, 3 amino acid sequences, and other species using MEGA 5.0 software. ATMUV inoculated ducklings developed clinical symptoms on day 4 post-infection characterized by anorexia and weight loss. twenty five 7-day-old healthy mule ducklings were challenged by intramuscular injection with 4.0 105 ELD50 of ATMUV in a volume of 0.4 mL per duckling. 10 same old ducklings were inoculated with 0.4 mL sterile PBS per duckling as a control. mRNA levels of type I and type III IFNs were gradually elevated. expression of IFN- was modestly upregulated by 8.5-fold at 24 hpi. expression of duck IFITM1 was markedly increased by over 100-folds at 72 hpi. spleen tissues were collected for examination of IFN- (A), IFN- (B), IFN- (C) and IFITM1, 2, 3 (D\u2013F) mRNA expression. expression at 12\u201372 hpi was compared to its expression at 0 hpi. duck IFITM1 was greatly induced and reached maximum value (52-fold) at 12 hpi. expression of duck IFITM2 and IFITM3 was enhanced modestly. they reached maximum levels by 6.8- and 6.3-fold at 36 hpi. qRT-PCR was performed to determine relative mRNA expression of indicated IFNs (A\u2013C) and IFITM (D\u2013F) genes compared with that without IFN treatment. DF-1 cells were infected with or without ATMUV at a MOI of 1.0. DF-1 cells were treated with chicken IFNs (500 IU/mL) and mRNA levels of IFITMs were examined by qRT-PCR. expression of IFITM1, 2, 3 was significantly upregulated in DF-1 cells. DF-1 cell lines expressing specific shRNA targeting each of these IFITMs were infected with ATMUV and harvested at 36 hpi. knockdown of IFITM2 only slightly enhanced ATMUV replication. mRNA expression in DF-1 cells expressing specific IFITM-shRNA was normalized to the endogenous -actin level. mRNA expression in DF-1 cells expressing specific IFITM-shRNA was normalized to the endogenous -actin level. overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 or IFITM3 in DF-1 cells reduced mRNA expression of ATMUV envelope gene by average of 58, 43, 53, 62% respectively. overexpression of chicken or duck IFITM1 and IFITM3 restricts ATMUV infection in vitro. mRNA expression of viral genes was examined by qRT-PCR at 36 hpi. chicken (DF-1 cell origin) and duck (duck embryo fibroblasts origin) IFITM1 and IFITM3 genes repertoire. chIFITM1 (KX811737) shared 100, 83.19, 45.11, 34.4, 30.7, and 35.48% amino acid identity to IFITM1 protein of chicken. avian IFITM1 and IFITM3 sequences are distinct from those of mammalian species. avian IFITM3 is more conserved than avian IFITM1 and IFITM3. taya virus group within the genus of Flavivirus was initially described as duck egg drop syndrome virus (DEDSV) however, this virus exhibits a wide range of pathogenicity to avian species including ducks, chicken, geese, house sparrows, and racing pigeon. the genome is closely related to Tembusu virus strains. mRNA levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2 were upregulated after this time point. defs displayed an apparent CPE by ATMUV infection at this time point. ATMUV NS1 could markedly suppress virus-induced IFN- expression by inhibiting RLR receptor signaling. 100 nM chIFNAR1-siRNA or NC-siRNA was transfected into DF-1 cell. disruption of endogenous IFNAR1 by siRNA greatly reduced IFITM2 mRNA expression. but only caused modest downregulation of IFITM1 and chIFITM3. human cytomegalovirus could exploit IFITMs to facilitate morphogenesis of virion assembly compartment. we generated DF-1 cell lines stably disrupting chicken IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 expression. ectopic expression of chicken and duck IFITM1 or IFITM3 markedly inhibited ATMUV replication. chicken and duck origin IFITM1 and IFITM3 could effectively restrict ATMUV replication. some key amino acids in IMD and CIL domain are conserved in chicken and duck IFITMs. research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
