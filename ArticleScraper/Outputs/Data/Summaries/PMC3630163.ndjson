{"summary": "HFMD is a common illness of infants and children under 10 years of age. it is characterized by fever, sores in mouth, and rash with blisters. HFMD affects more than one million children and is responsible for several hundred children deaths every year. a multiplex real-time hybridization probe-based RT-PCR assay was developed to detect and differentiate HEV71 specifically from CVA16 directly from clinical specimens within 1\u20132 h. to ensure detection of all etiologic agents of HFMD, another novel broad-spectrum probe-based RT-PCR assay was also developed. sensitivity was 0.1 TCID50/ml for HEV71 and 0.1 TCID50/ml for CVA16 by multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay. sensitivity was 0.1 TCID50/ml for HEVs in a broad-spectrum real-time RT-PCR assay. results showed that the real-time RT-PCR assay for HEVs specifically detected all available enterovirus, but not any other RNA viruses tested. the total positive rate of HEV71 and CVA16 was 69.48% (148/213) in the 213 HFMD clinical specimens. the real-time RT-PCR results of HEV71, CVA16, and HEVs were also positive. the total positive rates of RT-PCR and virus isolation for HEV71 and 9 CVA16 were 47.42% (101/213) and 34.74% (74/213), respectively, when compared with that of real-time RT-PCR assay. the sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR was noted to be significantly higher than both conventional RT-PCR and virus isolation. 4, CVA8, CVA9, CVA10, CVB3, Echo3, Echo9, Echo19, Echo25, and Echo30 were also detected in several hundreds of HFMD clinical specimens. the viral RNA of HEV71 and CVA16 samples with a concentration of 0.01\u2013105 TCID50/ml was extracted and tested in triplicates to determine the end-point dilution at which the positive amplification signal is obtained. 213 clinical specimens from HFMD clinical diagnosis patients during outbreaks were collected and tested, including 56 stools, 109 throat swabs, 38 rectal swabs, and 10 vesicles. the real-time RT-PCR results showed that the pathogens of these samples were mostly HEV71 (118) and CVA16 (30) among the 213 HFMD clinical specimens. a total of 85 HEV71 and 16 CVA16 were identified using RT-PCR method among the 213 HFMD clinical specimens. the multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay exhibits 100% specificity in detecting HEV71 and CVA16. RT-PCR assay for HEV71 and CVA16 and the broad-spectrum real-time RT-PCR assay for HEVs were applied in 31 provincial labs to detect the pathogens of HFMD. 2046 cases were identified as HEV71(53.36%), 1030 cases were CVA16 (26.86%), and 758 cases were identified as other enterovirus(19.77%) the multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for HEV71 and CVA16 and the broad-spectrum real-time RT-PCR assay for HEVs were developed for rapid detection of the pathogens causing HFMD. the primers and probes were designed, and the reaction parameters and running conditions of real-time RT-PCR assays were optimized and evaluated. multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for HEV71 and CVA16 and broad-spectrum real-time RT-PCR assay for HEVs have been applied in 31 provincial labs. the widespread application of the two real-time RT-PCR methods in the HFMD laboratory network will contribute to the rapid identification of HEV pathogens in the early stages of HFMD outbreaks. 213 HFMD clinical specimens, including 56 stools, 109 throat swabs, 38 rectal swabs, and 10 vesicles, were collected from 179 HFMD patients. these specimens were simultaneously tested by the two real-time RT-PCR assays, RT-PCR assay, virus isolation, and VP1 gene sequencing assay. highly conserved VP1 sequences of HEV71 or CVA16 were used to design primers and probes. a pair of primers (HEV71YGF and HEV71YGR) were designed for specific detection of HEV71. another pair of primers (CVA16YGF and CVA16YGR) were designed for specific detection of CVA16.
