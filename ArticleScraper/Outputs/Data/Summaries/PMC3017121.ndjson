{"summary": "IFITM proteins are a family of viral restriction factors that play critical roles in the interferon-mediated control of influenza A virus. they inhibit both IAV replication and infection by hemagglutinin (HA)-pseudotyped retroviruses, indicating that they target the IAV entry process. they also restrict an early step in the lifecycle of several flaviviruses, including dengue and west Nile viruses. some entry proteins, for example IAV HA or flavivirus E proteins, are induced by low pH [7], [8]. fusion mediated by these proteins requires access to an acidic cellular compartment such as a late endosome or lysosome. other entry proteins such as the envelope proteins of HIV-1 and MLV do not require access to an acidic compartment. MARV and EBOV GP1,2-mediated entry is restricted by IFITM1, 2 and 3. the entry process of each of these viruses is pH dependent. EBOV and EBOV require cathepsin L activity to infect cells. we have repeatedly observed that IFITM-mediated restriction is less efficient in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. both IAV HA- and filovirus GP1,2-mediated entry were only partially suppressed in these cells. cells are significant (P0.05) for all MARV, EBOV, IAV pseudoviruses excepting H7(FPV) in 293T cells expressing IFITM1 (P0.1) aliquots of same cells assayed in (A), (C), (E) and (G) were used to determine expression of IFITM proteins. IFN- treatment upregulated IFITM proteins. entry mediated by MARV and EBOV GP1,2 or IAV HA was markedly inhibited. infection by MLV and MACV pseudoviruses was only modestly suppressed. atant was harvested and viral titer was assayed using quantitative RT-PCR. a single asterisk indicates a significant difference with controls cells. a single asterisk indicates a significant difference with controls cells. IFITM1, 2, and 3 cells transduced to express ACE2 were transduced to express indicated c-myc-tagged IFITM proteins or with vector alone. two days later, cells were infected with indicated pseudoviruses. differences in pseudovirus entry between vector alone and IFITM expressing cells are significant. expression of c-myc-tagged IFITM proteins was assayed by western blot. depletion of IFITM proteins differentially enhances infection mediated by MARV, EBOV, and IAV entry proteins. cells were transduced to express control shRNA targeting IFITM1, 2, 3 or shRNA targeting both IFITM1 and 3 expression. expression of IFITM proteins in control or IFITM depleted HeLa cells was assayed by western blot using the indicated anti-IFITM1 or anti-IFITM2/3 antibody. expression of IFITM proteins in control or IFITM depleted HeLa cells was then treated with 1000 U/ml IFN- or with medium alone for 48 hours. infectivity of indicated pseudoviruses was measured in ACE2- and shRNA-expressing K562 cells. differences in pseudovirus entry between cells expressing control and IFITM1 shRNA were significant (P0.05) for MARV, SARS-CoV, and IAV pseudoviruses. a549 cells were transduced to express all known human (Figs. 5A and B), mouse (Figs. 5C and D), or chicken (Figs. 5E and F) IFITM orthologs. almost every IFITM ortholog restricted MARV and EBOV GP1,2-mediated entry. IFITM protein orthologs were measured by western blot using anti-c-myc antibody (9E10). differences in pseudovirus entry between control and IFITM-expressing cells are significant (P0.05) except for H5(Thai) entry into murine Ifitm6- and chicken Ifitm5-expressing cells. we did not observe in IFITM-expressing cells any decrease in cellular cathepsin activity that could readily account for this difference. lysosomal pH, which activates cathepsins B and L, is similarly unaffected by IFITM protein expression. IFITM protein expression in ACE2-expressing Vero E6 cells was measured by western blot with an anti-c-myc antibody (9E10). cathepsin L activity in vero E6 cells transduced with vector alone or stably expressing indicated IFITM proteins was measured fluorometrically. IFITM proteins do not interfere with virion access to acidic cellular compartments. in all cases, labeled virions readily colocalized with cellular compartments labeled with LysoTracker, a fluorescent indicator of acidic compartments. MARV and EBOV GP1,2-mediated entry is restricted by IFITM1, 2, and 3 The IFITM proteins restrict IAV HA-mediated entry. both EBOV and EBOV require cathepsin L activity to infect cells, whereas EBOV also requires cathepsin B activity to infect cells. entry mediated by MARV and EBOV GP1,2 proteins was inhibited by the same proteins. comparisons were obtained in vero E6 cells, an African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line and the standard cell line for laboratory propagation of these viruses. we have repeatedly observed that IFITM-mediated restriction is less efficient in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. difference in pseudovirus entry between vector alone and IFITM expressing cells is significant (P0.05) for all MARV, EBOV, IAV pseudoviruses excepting H7(FPV) in 293T cells expressing IFITM1 (P0.1) infected cells with pseudoviruses bearing MARV, EBOV, IAV, MACV, or MLV entry proteins were markedly inhibited by IFN- treatment. infection by MLV and MACV pseudoviruses was only modestly suppressed, an effect possibly due to post-entry inhibition of GFP expression. IFITM protein expression in vero E6 cells was assayed by western blot using anti-c-myc antibody. a single asterisk indicates a significant difference with controls cells (P0.05); double asterisks indicate P0.1. c-myc-tagged IFITM proteins were assayed using aliquots of the same (C) A549 or (F) Vero E6 cells analyzed in (A) and (D), respectively. ACE2 expression is shown as mean fluorescence intensity. each panel represents at least three experiments with similar results. depletion of IFITM proteins differentially enhances infection mediated by MARV, SARS-CoV, and IAV entry proteins. no similar pattern was observed with MARV, EBOV, or SARS-CoV. expression of IFITM proteins in control or IFITM depleted cells was assayed by western blot using the indicated anti-IFITM1 or anti-IFITM2/3 antibody. -actin was included as a loading control. the indicated pseudoviruses were measured in ACE2- and shRNA-expressing K562 cells stably expressing the indicated shRNA. differences in pseudovirus entry between cells expressing control and IFITM1 shRNA were significant (P0.05) for MARV, SARS-CoV, and IAV pseudoviruses. murine and chicken IFITM orthologs differentially restrict infection mediated by MARV, EBOV, and IAV entry proteins. cells were transduced to express all known human (Figs. 5A and B), mouse (Figs. 5C and D), or chicken (Figs. 5E and F) IFITM orthologs. expression of (B) human, (D) mouse, or (F) chicken IFITM protein orthologs was measured by western blot using the anti-c-myc antibody (9E10). differences in pseudovirus entry between control and IFITM-expressing cells are significant (P0.05) except for H5(Thai) entry into murine Ifitm6- and chicken Ifitm5-expressing cells. trypsin treatment bypasses IFITM restriction of entry mediated by SARS-CoV S protein. two days later, cells were spin-inoculated at 4\u00b0C with indicated pseudoviruses and then treated with 5 g/ml trypsin or phosphate-buffered saline. expression was measured on aliquots of vero E6 cells used in (A) vero E6 cells were labeled with Alexa 488-conjugated S-protein RBD of SARS-CoV. expression was measured by western blot with an anti-c-myc antibody (9E10). IFITM proteins do not interfere with virion access to acidic cellular compartments. in all cases, labeled virions readily colocalized with cellular compartments labeled with LysoTracker. top panels show a control in which vero E6 cells transduced with vector alone were pretreated with 1 U/ml bacterial neuraminidase (NA) for 24 hours before influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus infection. rightmost figures show differential interference contrast (DIC) and rightmost figures show the merged images of labeled virions and LysoTracker labeled cells. the number and diversity of restricted viruses tends to exclude mechanisms that might be unique to individual viruses. we previously showed that IFITM proteins do not decrease cell-surface expression of sialic acid, the primary attachment moiety for IAV [1]. a loss of cathepsin activity in IFITM-expressing cells does not exclude the possibility that these compartments are distinct from those where productive infection can occur. two additional observations are consistent with this hypothesis. murine Ifitm5 and Ifitm6, and chicken Ifitm5 efficiently restricted entry mediated by filovirus GP1,2 proteins. however, the pattern of basal or interferon-induced expression of the IFITM proteins is likely to be an independent determinant of viral tropism and pathogenesis in vivo. Plasmids and constructs A DNA segment encoding the c-myc tag sequence and the AgeI restriction enzyme site was introduced into the pQCXIP vector. pRS vector-based control shRNA and shRNA constructs targeting human IFITM1, 2, 3, or 1/3 mRNA were purchased from OriGene. 293T cells plated at 70% confluence in T75 culture flasks were transfected using the calcium phosphate method to produce transducing viruses. cells were incubated with 10 g/ml of polybrene and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes at 4,000g. infected cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Polysciences) 48 hours after infection. spin inoculation was used and polybrene was not included. trypsin-bypass experiments performed similarly. the 20-l reaction mix contained 5 l of RNA, 0.4 M of each primer, 0.2 M probe, 4 l of 5 reaction mix, 0.4 l of Rox, and 1 l of enzyme mix. the reaction was run as follows: reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 20 minutes; initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes; amplification for 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds. ACE2 cell surface expression was measured by labeling cells with 20 g/ml Alexa-488 or Alexa-649 (Pierce) conjugated S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV for one hour. cells were then washed 3 times with PBS, fixed with 1% formaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry. expression of human c-myc-tagged IFITM proteins in A549 cells was assayed using antibodies used in this study included murine anti-lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1, H4A3, 150 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotech) IgG1, murine anti-LAMP2 (H4B4, 150 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotech) IgG1, murine anti-CD63 (FC-5.01, 1100 dilution; Invitrogen) IgG2a, rabbit anti-early endosomal antigen 1 (EE western blots Cells were lysed with either 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) or 1% NP-40 (Thermo Scientific) expression of various c-myc-tagged IFITM proteins was detected by 0.4 g/ml murine monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) monoclonal murine anti-NA (N1) IgG (NA-112-S2.4) at 4\u00b0C for 16 hours. virions were used for infection assays directly after labeling. virions were transduced to express IFITM proteins or with vector alone. A549 cells transduced with vector alone or stably expressing IFITM proteins were selected with 3 g/ml puromycin. human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, Lonza) were maintained in endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM-2) the sequences of control 29-mer and those targeting coding regions of IFITM1, 2, or 3 mRNA are as follows: IFITM1 \u2013 TGCACAAGGAGGAACATGAGGTGTGTG; IFITM2 \u2013 CCGCAGACCATTCTGCTCATCATCATC; and control \u2013 GCACTACCAGAGAGAGACATCATCATCATCATC. MACV GPC, 15 g plasmid DNA encoding MLV gag and pol, and 15 g pQCXIP-based plasmids encoding various human, mouse, or chicken IFITM proteins. cells were then transduced by incubating transducing viruses mixed with 10 g/ml of polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) ovirus infection, vero E6 or A549 cells transduced to express IFITM proteins or with vector alone were incubated with MARV or EBOV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 15 cells were removed 1 h later and cells were washed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) all infected cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and HCS CellMask Red (Invitrogen) images were acquired and analyzed on an Opera confocal reader (model 3842-Quadruple Excitation High Sensitivity), Perkin Elmer. cells transduced to express human IFITM proteins or with vector alone were fixed, permeablized, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated murine anti-c-myc IgG (9E10; Abcam) for one hour and counterstained with DAPI. cells were imaged using the same method. cathepsin activity of 2105 vero E6 cells transduced to express IFITM proteins or with vector alone was assayed using the cathepsin L activity kit. a cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074) was added in each tested sample to eliminate interference from cathepsin B. -actin recognized by 1 g/ml murine monoclonal anti--actin antibody (Sigma) was used as a loading control. virions were incubated with 20 g/ml Alexa 488 (Pierce)-conjugated monoclonal murine anti-NA (N1) IgG (NA-112-S2.4) at 4\u00b0C for 16 hours. control cells were pre-treated with 1 U/ml neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma) for 24 hours or with 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1, Sigma) for 6 hours before influenza A virus infection. cells were fixed with formaldehyde, permeablized by Triton X-100, and counterstained with DAPI (blue) ACE2 expression in cells used in Fig. 4G was assayed using Alexa 649-conjugated S protein RBD of SARS-CoV. a549 cells transduced to express c-myc-tagged human IFITM2, IFITM5, or with vector alone were fixed, permeablized, and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-c-myc antibody (green) vero E6 cells transduced with vector alone were pretreated with 100 nM bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) for 6 hours or with 1 U/ml bacterial neuraminidase (NA) for 24 hours. images were taken by confocal microscopy 100 minutes later."}
