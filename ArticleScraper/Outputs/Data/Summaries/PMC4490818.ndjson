{"summary": "the world health organization is deploying 50 medical camp kits in the 14 worst earthquake-hit districts. the kits comprise tents and other equipment to construct temporary health centres. as result of two major earthquakes on 25 April and 12 May, 484 public health facilities were completely damaged and 474 partially damaged. an estimated 91% of the world\u2019s population uses an improved source of drinking water. but the MDG sanitation target is lagging badly behind and 2.4 billion people still have no access to improved sanitation facilities. an estimated 842 000 deaths could be prevented by improving water, sanitation and hygiene in low- and middle-income countries. 126 further cases were confirmed in an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Republic of Korea. it is the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside Saudi Arabia since the disease was first identified in 2012. heat waves and health: guidance on warning-system development contains detailed guidance on how countries can establish heat\u2013health warning systems. these systems provide meteorological and climate prediction-based information on the likelihood of the occurrence of hot weather, which can trigger heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heatstroke and death. heat waves are periods of unusually hot and dry, or hot and humid weather that have a subtle onset and cessation. the same meteorological conditions can constitute a heat wave in one place but not in another."}
