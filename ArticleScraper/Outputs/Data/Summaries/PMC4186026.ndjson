{"summary": "global warming influences the geographical distribution of important vector organisms for several dangerous pathogens1. the increase in worldwide travel and mobility is an effective driving force for the spread of infectious diseases. the unexpected appearance of SARS in 20023 and the related Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2013,4 the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in 20095 serve as examples of emerging and re-emerging diseases. COP-based vaccine design can be achieved by systematic extraction of the existing knowledge of protective immune responses against a large spectrum of relevant bacteria and viruses combined with knowledge of the immune mechanisms induced by different vaccine concepts. the current literature on COPs for an infectious disease for which traditional vaccine platforms are being constantly improved. influenza influenza is dominated by A and B viruses. influenza pandemics usually occur as a result of new combinations of HA and NA subtypes (antigenic shift) Vaccine purpose strain Vaccine type Adjuvant Route Trade names1 (manufacturer) Seasonal annual strains2 IIV whole virus AlPO4 im Fluval AB (Omninvest) IIV split none none none none none none none none none none none im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im im avian strains IIV whole virus AlPO4 AlOH3/PO4 none im im Fluval H5N1,5 Vepace5 (Baxter) IIV split AS03 im Prepandrix, Adjupanrix (GlaxoSmithKline) IIV subunit MF59C.1 im Foclivia, Aflunov (Novartis) 1 Vaccines are derived from processed influenza virions propagated on embryonated chicken eggs and inactivated several IIV and LAIV vaccines have been licensed. some are cell based and/or adjuvanted, and widely used in various age groups during the 2009 influenza pandemic. introduction of a new seasonal influenza vaccine requires a licensing application which should include satisfactory evidence of immunogenicity and safety. an HI titer 40 has been defined as an immunologic correlate corresponding to a 50% reduction of risk of contracting influenza. for each tested age group and all viral strains, at least one of 3 defined criteria for immunogenicity must be fulfilled. for registration of pandemic vaccines all 3 criteria must be fulfilled. a titer of 330 was required to measure both IgM and IgG antibodies. this may lead to an \u2018overrating\u2019 of the immune response in nave children. alternative immunological endpoints, such as antibody responses to other viral proteins or cell mediated immune parameters, might better reflect vaccine efficacy in children. application of any cellular biomarkers of protection will require standardized and harmonized assays with inactivated or low pathogenicity viral strains. a wide range of potential COP assays covering both antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses are in the pipeline, but they still need further evaluation for clinical performance and methodological validation. induction of HA-antibodies that block receptor-binding is an important COP against infection, provided that these antibodies have the correct strain-specificity. the induction of HA-antibodies that block receptor-binding is used as a correlate of vaccine efficacy and a current criterion for regulatory approval. a cutoff of 110 was required to predict the conventional 50% clinical protection rate, and to predict an 80% protective level. this discrepancy may relate to the ability of the HI assay to measure both IgM and IgG antibodies. alternative immunological endpoints, such as antibody responses to other viral proteins, might better reflect vaccine efficacy in children. a wide range of potential COP assays covering both antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses are in the pipeline, but still need further evaluation for clinical performance and methodological validation. the putative trendsetting role of influenza can be attributed to both development of principally new vaccine concepts. potential new influenza COPs relevant for these different vaccine platforms have been identified from preclinical and clinical studies. in children, serum HI titer and nasal IgA45 have been described as co-correlates. non-neutralizing antibody- and T-cell responses have also been reported as co-correlates of protection.

Various non-standardized methods are available to assess anti-NA antibody responses,62-65. the broad repertoire of COP related assays now available in the influenza field may serve as a necessary menu from which the relevant immune assays should be chosen. cellular immune responses mediated by T cells are mainly directed against epitopes of internal and highly conserved antigens (M, NP, PA, PB) antibody-mediated immunity mainly acts to prevent viral entry into and release from cells. existing IFN+IL2-CD8+ T cells were shown to correlate with low total symptom score during the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic. granzyme B levels were also shown to correlate with protection and enhanced cytotoxic activity after influenza vaccination. pre-existing influenza-specific CD4+ T cells were recently found to correlate with decreased viral shedding and reduced severity of illness. multiple vaccine candidates using liver vectors or particulate formulations are in clinical development specifically designed to induce cross-reactive T cell immunity against internal antigens. standardized CD8+ and CD4+ assays are needed to assess vaccine effectiveness and to compare results between different laboratories. the relevance of INF- has been further supported by the finding that the frequency of virus specific INF- secreting cells could be correlated with protection against disease in a vaccination study of children. however, the relative strength of the T cell based COPs discussed here is difficult to evaluate. mucosal IgA is capable of neutralizing virus once inside mucosal epithelial cells. local intracellular virus may also be cleared by cytolysis of infected cells by intra-epithelial cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. vaccine induced NK cell mediated mechanisms have also been implicated in viral clearance. al immune responses in combination with novel influenza vaccine platforms include intranasal,30,60,110-113 oral,95,114 sublingual,115-117 and intradermal118 administration. some of these concepts are already in clinical development. broadly neutralizing antibodies that bind to this region have been shown to inhibit infection with influenza A47-49 and B strains. several expression platforms delivering full-length HA have entered clinical development. these include recombinant and fusion-proteins, particles (inactivated virions, virosomes, VLPs, BLPs), replicon systems. somal membrane Recombinant protein or polypeptide based Ag with relevant HA sequences Experimentally demonstrated47-49 More data needed Conserved among subtypes Limit for protection not defined Relevant for universal vaccines NA ELISA and NAI assay Serum IgG NA Preventing mature virus to be released after intracellular infection.

Notably, these platforms can also induce various forms of cellular immunity. the broad repertoire of COP related assays now available in the influenza field may serve as a necessary menu from which the relevant immune assays should be chosen. antibody-mediated immunity mainly acts to prevent viral entry into and release from cells, while T-cell mediated immunity plays an important role in clearance of established infection. low granzyme B levels correlated with the risk of developing influenza disease in older adults. more recently levels of pre-existing IFN+IL2- CD8+ T cells were shown to correlate with low total symptom score during the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic. multiple vaccine candidates using liver vectors or particulate formulations are in clinical development specifically designed to induce cross-reactive T cell immunity against internal antigens. standardized CD8+ and CD4+ assays are needed to assess vaccine effectiveness and to compare results between different laboratories. assays should represent efficient tools for evaluating vaccines in combination with assays for cytotoxic effector functions. the relevance of INF- has been further supported by the finding that the frequency of virus specific INF- secreting cells could be correlated with protection against disease in a vaccination study of children. mucosal IgA is capable of neutralizing virus once inside mucosal epithelial cells. local intracellular virus may also be cleared by cytolysis of infected cells by intra-epithelial cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. vaccine induced NK cell mediated mechanisms have also been implicated in viral clearance. intranasal,30,60,110-113 oral,95,114 sublingual,115-117 and intradermal118 administration are effective at inducing mucosal immune responses. some of these concepts are already in clinical development. systems vaccinology aims to identify both innate and adaptive immune signatures able to predict the immunogenicity and protective capacity of vaccines. results of LAIV or IIV vaccination in man with respect to the humoral response could be predicted based on the expression of a defined set of genes only 3 d after vaccination. ferrets develop fever, nasal discharge, suffer from weight loss and develop lung pathology. ferrets are susceptible to human and avian influenza strains. largely show the same tissue distribution of infection and are able to spread the virus through aerosol transmission. ferrets are outbred animals, the nature of their MHC is unknown. some cellular reagents, developed for other species, show cross-reactivity with some of the CD markers and cytokines in ferrets. innate cytokine responses are measured at the mRNA level by RT-PCR. new technologies to measure antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells have opened a new vista to include defined T-cell mediated effector functions. new vaccine concepts targeting other antigens, delivery systems, and protective mechanisms have paved the way for several new and emerging COPs with relevance for both antibody and T-cell mediated immunity. research on influenza vaccines and COPs has paved the way for improved understanding of protective immune responses against influenza infection and disease. results from the influenza field have taught us how to measure the relevant laboratory-based COPs at the methodological level."}
