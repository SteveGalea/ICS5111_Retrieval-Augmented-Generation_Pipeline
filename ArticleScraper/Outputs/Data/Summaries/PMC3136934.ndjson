{"summary": "NTera-2 cells were induced to differentiate into an astrocyte-like lineage. the repression by Sin3A and MeCP2 may be an essential mechanism. the repression by Sin3A and MeCP2 may be an essential mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell differentiation. glial cells are important in critical neuronal maturation processes such as axonal pathfinding, synapse formation, neurotransmitter transport, metabolic functions, and the response to CNS injury [3]\u2013[6]. glial cells are important in critical neuronal maturation processes such as axonal pathfinding, synapse formation, neurotransmitter transport, metabolic functions. conditional deletion of the DNA methyltransferase I from neural progenitor cells suggests that DNA methylation regulates the timing and magnitude of astrogliogenesis [22] another class of epigenetic modifications was found from FGF2, which regulates the ability of ciliary neurotrophic factor to enhance astrocyte differentiation by inducing H3 Lys4 dimethylation and suppressing H3 Lys9 dimethylation at the STAT3-binding site. s NTera-2, 3T3, and 293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS, USA), containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS, USA) cell-cycle analysis Cells were resuspended in PBS and fixed with ethanol overnight at 20\u00b0C. cell cycles were detected with FACSCalibur. RT-PCR consisted of two programs. PCR consisted of 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 59\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s. cells were lysed in lysis buffer (4 M urea, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM HEPES, and 100 U benezonase/107 cells) the membrane was blocked with 5% fat-free milk in a TBST solution for 1 h. the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-STAT3 antibody. these immunocomplexes were detected by an anti-p300 antibody. cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. cell pellets were first washed three times with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer. cell lysate was then dried and stored in 30\u00b0C. gel was cut into small pieces and washed several times with TEABC containing 50% ACN. phosphopeptide samples from trypsin digestion were reconstituted in loading buffer and loaded into the IMAC column. the unbound peptides were removed with 100 l washing solution consisting of 75% (v/v) loading buffer and 25% (v/v) ACN followed by equilibration with loading buffer for 15 min before sample loading. the mass spectrometer was calibrated with a synthetic human [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B solution (1 pmol/l; Sigma) delivered through the nanoLockSpray source. the method included a full MS scan (m/z 400\u20131600, 0.6 s) and 3 MS/MS (m/z 100\u20131990, 1.2 s each scan) sequentially on the most three intense ions present in the full scan mass spectrum. DNA methylation analysis Genomic DNA sodium bisulfite conversion was performed using an EZ-96 DNA methylation kit. the manufacture's protocol was followed using 1 g of genomic DNA and an alternative protocol (two-temperature DNA denaturation) in vivo transcription and RNA cleavage were achieved by adding 2 l of the PCR product to 5 l of the transcription/cleavage reaction. the reaction contained 27 units of T7 R&DNA polymerase (EpiCentre, Palmerston North, New Zealand), 0.64 of T7 R&DNA polymerase buffer, 0.22 l T Cleavage Mix (Sequenom), 3.14 mM DTT, 3.21 l H2O, and 0. PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 15 min, then 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 57\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. the purified PCR products were then subcloned into a TA cloning vector (50 ng) we used 5 g of anti-Sin3A, 20 g of anti-MeCP2 (sc-994X and sc-20700X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5 g of anti-CBP, 5 g of anti-p300, 20 g of anti-polII (sc-369X, sc-585X and sc-899X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5 g of anti-H3K9Ac, 5 g of anti chroomatin was eluted from the antibody and de-cross-linked by added of 30 l pronase and 1 l CaCl2 (1 M) then incubated it at 42\u00b0C for 2 h and 65\u00b0C for 6 h. the immunoprecipitated DNA was recovered by a PCR purification kit. cells were split every 2 days in a 0.5% trypsin-EDTA solution. the targeted sequence was GCGAACCAGTATCGAGAGAAC in the Oct-4 gene. the sequence was first cloned into a pBS/U6 vector. RNA was extracted from NTera-2 cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. the target RNA was amplified by a one-step RT-PCR kit. the RT-PCR consisted of two programs. 105 cells per lane were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes overnight. membrane was blocked with 5% fat-free milk in a TBST solution for 1 h and then probed separately with a mouse monoclonal antibody against Oct-4. immunocytochemistry NTera-2 cells were grown on 12-well plates. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. cells were permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. bisacrylamide (40%, 291), 10% APS, and TEMED were then applied to protein solution to polymerize as a gel directly in the eppendorf. the gel was cut into small pieces and washed several times with TEABC containing 50% ACN. the gel samples were further dehydrated with ACN and the completely dried by vacuum centrifugation. unbound peptides were eluted from the IMAC column with 100 l NH4H2PO4 (200 mM at pH 4.4) the bound peptides were eluted from the IMAC column with 100 l NH4H2PO4 (200 mM at pH 4.4) raw data were processed using Mascot Distiller v 2.1.1.0 (Matrix science) the datasets were searched against international protein index (IPI_human v. 3.29, 68161 sequences) only tryptic peptides with up to two missed cleavage sites were allowed. only unique peptide with scores higher than 25 was confidently assigned. PCR primers were designed using EpiDesigner (Sequenom) spectrometry was performed in combination with RNA base-specific cleavage. a detectable pattern is then analyzed to determine the methylation status. mass spectra were acquired using a massARRAY Compact MALDI-TOF (Sequenom) the methylation ratios were calculated by comparing the difference in spectra intensity derived from methylated and non-methylated template DNA by the Epityper software version 1.0 (Sequenom) cloned into a TA cloning vector (50 ng) (pGEM-T Easy vector; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) cloned into a TA cloning vector (50 ng) by sequencing with the T7 universal primer. anti-polII (sc-369X, sc-585X and sc-899X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5 g of anti-H3K9Ac, 5 g of anti-H3K14Ac (06-942 and 06-911; Upstate-Millipore), and 2.5 g of anti-H3K4me3 (ab8580; abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) were incubated with chromatin at 4\u00b0C PCR primers were designed using the software program Primer Express (Roche Applied Science), and the amplification primers are listed in Table S2. for each sample, the PCR analysis was performed in triplicate. for each sample, the PCR analysis was performed in triplicate. the reduction in Oct-4 expression by NTera-2 cells was accompanied by a marked reduction in cell proliferation. these cells had almost ceased cell cycling with accumulations of cells in the G0/G1 phase on days 4 and 14. in NTera-2 cells, however, Cdx2 expression was not detected in RNAi transduced cells. immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analyses of GFAP expression in undifferentiated NTera-2 cells. red staining for GS was compared with Hoechst dye for nuclei. -actin was used as an internal control in the Western blots. NTera-2 cells produced by newly developed protocol had an astrocyte-like morphology. they expressed the astrocyte-specific markers, GFAP and GS, suggesting differentiation toward an astrocytic lineage. this suggests activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway during differentiation of NTera-2 cells. immunofluorescence staining for olig2 (red, upper panel), Hoechst dye (blue, middle panel), and merged images (bottom panel) are shown for undifferentiated control NTera-2 cells and NTera-2 cells 21 days after differentiation. B. STAT3 activation was examined with a specific antibody against phosphorylated STAT3 and total levels of STAT3 in lysates from cells similarly transduced were determined. data are expressed as log2 of fold change. Western blots showed levels of Sin3A expression in NTera-2 cells. -actin was used as an internal control in the Western blots. three important themes emerge from the shift in expression of several known, classifiable proteins. first, the data set contains histone modifying complexes such as Sin3A and SUDS3. third is a group of chromatin remodeling complexes, such as RB1, MCM2, TRIM24, HMGA1 and RCC1. the binding of these two co-repressors was quantitated by a real-time PCR using primers spanning from the STAT3 binding site at the promoter to exon 1 relative to the transcription start site of GFAP. a pair of primers, h, located between exons 6 and 7 near the end of GFAP gene, served as a negative control. the level of specific binding between MeCP2 and the STAT3-binding site at the GFAP promoter was substantially reduced in differentiated astrocyte-like cells. these results suggest that MeCP2 may be responsible for recruiting the Sin3A co-repressor complex to the area surrounding the GFAP promoter. methylation status of CpG sites within the STAT3 recognition sequence and GFAP gene exon 1 regions in undifferentiated NTera-2 cells and NTera-2 cells was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. closed circles indicate methylated and unmethylated CpG sites. transcription start site were stably methylated before and after differentiation. reduced expression of Sin3A is accompanied by decreased occupancy of Sin3A and MeCP2 around the STAT3-binding site of the GFAP promoter. TTCCTGGAA identified a second binding site at +250 bp (TTCCTGGAA) at exon 1 of human GFAP (85% identities), based on a detailed sequence comparison with mouse GFAP gene. STAT3 occupies both the promoter and exon 1 of GFAP, recruitment of CBP and p300 to exon 1 and changes in histone acetylation levels at the STAT3-binding site after differentiation. a ChIP analysis was performed to examine the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. a comparison of undifferentiated NTera-2 cells with differentiated cells revealed increased recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the GFAP gene transcription start site (primer set e) next examined whether the CBP/p300 co-activator was also associated with the activated GFAP promoter. however, we did not detect a significant association between CBP/p300 proteins and the STAT3-binding site at the GFAP promoter (primer sets a\u2013c). era-2 cells with HDAC inhibitors led to an increase in the acetylated H3K9 and H3K14 using specific antibodies and also GFAP gene expression. we used a lentiviral vector carrying a short hairpin (sh)RNA to downregulate Oct-4 expression in order to develop a new protocol for cell differentiation. three days after transduction with the shRNA lentivirus, expression was greatly diminished. downregulation of Oct-4 expression often leads to upregulation of Cdx2 in ES cells. in NTera-2 cells, however, Cdx2 expression was not detected in RNAi- transduced cells. this cell line may be derived from cells at a stage of embryogenesis later than the origin of the ES cell line. but, expression of nestin disappeared 3 days after transduction. synthetase (GS) expression in NTera-2 cells 21 days after differentiation. the red staining for GS was compared with Hoechst dye (blue) for nuclei. -actin was used as an internal control in the blots. olig2 was expressed in nuclei of undifferentiated NTera-2 cells. translocation of olig2 from nuclei may suggest activation of STAT3 in nuclei. specific antibodies against STAT3 were found to have co-immunoprecipitated p300. sates from cells similarly transduced were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody against STAT3 and then were also probed with an anti-p300-specific antibody. phosphoproteins were digested in an optimized gel-assisted digestion and purified by a highly specific and reproducible automatic IMAC nanotechnology. differentially phosphorylated proteins were functionally annotated and classified. they included phosphoproteins and those that were posttranslationally modified by acetylation. these proteins with significant enrichment scores were separated to nucleus and cytoplasm in location. chromatin associating proteins include RB1, MCM2, TRIM24, HMGA1 and RCC1. of particular interest is the significant reduction of Sin3A in the phosphoproteomic pattern after 3 days of transduction. the protein expression of Sin3A decreased significantly and continuously after differentiation. a pair of primer sets h (Fig. 4A) located between exons 6 and 7 near the end of GFAP gene served as a negative control. the binding of Sin3A significantly and specifically diminished around the STAT3 binding site about 1500 bp upstream of the GFAP start site. meCP2 may be responsible for recruiting the Sin3A co-repressor complex to the area surrounding the GFAP promoter. qPCR primer pairs amplifying the STAT3-binding site and exon 1 regions are indicated as alphabetic letters. the 5,000 bp upstream promoter was determined by a T-reverse cleavage reaction. there is a possibility that the reduction in MeCP2 occupancy at the GFAP promoter was triggered by DNA demethylation of the same region. the bisulfite sequencing analysis showed that upon differentiation toward an astrocyte-like lineage, the CpG dinucleotide around the STAT3-binding site at the promoter (primer sets P1 and P2 activation of activated STAT3 was also identified in astrocyte-like cells. the occupancy of activated STAT3 was more abundant around the STAT3- binding site at the GFAP promoter (primer sets b and c, especially primer set b at the STAT3 binding site) in differentiated cells compared to undifferentiated cells. AT3 occupies both promoter and exon 1 of GFAP, recruitment of CBP and p300 to exon 1 and changes in histone acetylation levels at the STAT3-binding site after differentiation. ChIP analyses were performed using anti-STAT3-P antibodies and qPCR primer pairs. nucleosomes occur near transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes. about 91% of all RNA polymerase II-binding sites are correlated with H3K4me3-binding sites. the results suggest a close correlation among STAT3-mediated chromatin remodeling, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and GFAP activation. BP antibody and primer sets d, f, and g with the p300 antibody. results showed significant increases in active markers of acetyl-H3K9 (H3K9Ac) and acetyl-H3K14 (H3K14Ac) in undifferentiated NTera-2 cells. Sin3A is thought to be devoid of intrinsic DNA- binding capacity. but is able to be recruited by MeCP2 that linked to methylated DNA with HDAC complex. such formation of corepressor complex may lead to local deacetylation of core histones with subsequent transcriptional silencing. specific increase of CBP/p300 occupancy at GFAP locus implies that the acetylation by these histone acetyltransferases play roles for gene activation of GFAP. also, CBP/p300 targeted histone H3 acetylation of the promoter but not exon 1 and induced chromatin remodeling, thereby enhancing recruitment of RNA polymerase II. intrachromosomal interactions such as chromatin looping were shown to be involved in promoting transcriptional activation of genes in eukaryotes [65], [66]. our ChIP experiments showed that activated STAT3 was present both in STAT3-binding sites of the promoter and in the exon 1 coding region of GFAP gene. the findings imply that there are conformational changes in the GFAP brought about by STAT3 activation. GFAP expression was induced during astrocyte-like differentiation of NTera-2. ChIP experiments confirmed that there was a strong association of STAT3 with the GFAP promoter, suggesting the existence of mechanism that facilitates access of the STAT3 complex to the GFAP promoter. studies in yeast have demonstrated that nucleosomes with histone H3K4me3 are associated with actively transcribed genes [75]\u2013[80] acetylation of histone H3K9 and H3K14 is critical for the recruitment of transcription factor II D, an initiation step in transcription. NTera-2 cells are widely used as models in human neurogenesis. but directed differentiation toward specific lineages has not been accomplished. this model can be used to examine a detailed mechanism underlying astrocytic differentiation. new reports suggest that another corepressor, N-CoR, controls differentiation of neural stem cells into astrocytes. phosphoproteomic analysis also confirmed the presence of N-CoR2 in the undifferentiated NTera-2, which declined significantly after cell differentiation. this results support transcriptional repression by Sin3A/MeCP2 complex serving as one of the critical mechanisms underlying the inhibition of astrocytic differentiation. GFAP gene activation in NTera-2 cells was supported by another independent assay. the presence of the MeCP2 and Sin3A corepressor complex and possibly associated HDAC activity at the GFAP promoter maintain the deacetylated status of chromatin and repress GFAP transcription. a 3C (chromosome conformation capture) assay was performed. we combined the 3C with ChIP (using p300 as a ChIP antibody) in a ChIP-loop assay [68]. we failed to detect direct evidence of DNA looping at the GFAP promoter. methylation of CpGs in DNA constitutes one epigenetic mark that generally correlated with transcriptionally silent chromatin. hypomethylated DNA in the promoter is a hallmark of vertebrate genes that are actively transcribed. GFAP activation was associated with the loss of DNA methylation at the STAT3-binding site. studies in yeast have demonstrated that nucleosomes with histone H3K4me3 are associated with actively transcribed genes. acetylation of histone H3K9 and H3K14 is critical for the recruitment of transcription factor II D, an initiation step in transcription, and therefore be associated with actively transcribed genes. human NTera-2 cells were differentiated into a homogenous population of cells with an astrocyte-like morphology and expressing astrocyte-specific, but not neural or oligodendrocyte markers. this model can be used to examine a detailed mechanism underlying astrocytic differentiation. astrocyte development and regeneration play critical roles in repair after brain injury. primers used for chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR."}
