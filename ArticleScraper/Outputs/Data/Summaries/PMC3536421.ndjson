{"summary": "newborn and adult mice require the herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry receptor nectin-1 for development of encephalitis after intracranial inoculation. the receptor requirements for central nervous system (CNS) disease differ in newborn mice compared with adult mice. the physical proximity between sequences involved in transcription is mediated by higher-order RNA structures. higher-order structures promote the optimal synthesis of coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs. SG formation occurs in cells infected with various viruses. study reinforces the importance of TRIM proteins in inflammatory and innate immune signaling and the capacity of HIV-1 to exploit innate immune signaling for viral replication."}
