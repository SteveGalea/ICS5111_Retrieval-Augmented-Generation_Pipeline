{"summary": "BRIL is a small 132 amino acid membrane protein expressed specifically in osteoblasts of bones from both intramembranous and endochondral ossification origins. BRIL is a palmitoylated type II transmembrane protein (N-in/C-out topology) that is present at the plasma membrane and golgi apparatus of the osteoblast. other IFITM members (IFITM1, 2, 3) display a generally ubiquitous expression a recurrent heterozygous mutation in the 5\u2019-untranslated region (c. -14C>T) was identified as the single underlying genetic cause of OI type V. probands have been identified with a de novo heterozygous missense mutation in exon 1 of BRIL (c. 119C>T; p. Ser40>Leu) which results in a severe progressive atypical BRIL type VI phenotype. a specific global Bril knockout (KO) mouse was reported to display a mild skeletal phenotype at birth and persistent through adulthoods. newborn mice showed shorter skeletons and some bent bones but not bending. however, no static bone morphometric measurements were provided for the adults. a targeting vector was constructed and used to create a global conventional gene KO of Bril in mice. the targeting strategy replaced the 2 coding exons of the Bril gene by the nuclear localization signal (NLS-LacZ) and PGK-Neo cassettes configured in a tail to tail orientation. the identity of the final construct was confirmed by sequencing on an Applied Biosystem 3730xl DNA Analyzer. mutant ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts and implanted into pseudo-pregnant females to generate chimeric mice. the animal use protocol and all procedures were reviewed and approved by the Shriners Hospitals for Children\u2013Canada and the McGill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. RNA and protein extractions RNA and proteins were extracted from bones. extracted proteins were combined with 4x Laemmli buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 50 mM EDTA, 0.08% bromophenol blue) luble proteins from the homogenate supernatant were collected and combined with 4x Laemmli buffer with 5% -mercaptoethanol. proteins were transferred to 0.45 m nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85) and stained with Ponceau S red to assess lane protein content, migration and transfer. membranes were blocked for 1 hour in 5% skim milk/PBS-tween (0.05%) then blotted overnight at 4\u00b0C in primary antibody embryos were washed post-fix in 1x PBS then incubated in 20% sucrose:OCT (Clear Frozen Section Compound, VWR) at 4\u00b0C. slides were first fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde/PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. embryos were washed post-fix in lacZ wash solution and then incubated for 3.5 hours in lacZ stain solution at 37\u00b0C. embryos were fixed for 24 hours in 3% PFA/PBS at 4\u00b0C then dehydrated to 70% ethanol for storage at 4\u00b0C. activity was normalized to total protein content as measured by the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio Rad) the region of interest (ROI) was defined manually by contouring an irregular anatomical region, a few pixels from the endocortical surface, every 5 bone slices. to define bone, an upper threshold of 255 was used with a lower adaptive threshold of 65 for 6w old bones or a lower adaptive threshold of 70 for 3 and 8m old bones. from these defined ROIs, three-dimensional measurements were calculated for bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume, %), trabecular the length of each femur was measured from the top of the medial condyle to the bottom of the major trochanter. biomechanical testing The three point bending assay was used to characterize biomechanical properties of 3m and 8m old bones. the right femur was cleaned of soft tissue and loaded to failure at room temperature. RT-qPCR was run on a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the Relative Quantification plate assay function of the 7500 System Sequence Detection Software (SDS) v.1.3.0. all data were normalised to -actin and values were expressed as 2(-Ct) a complete serum biochemistry workout, measuring 16 analytes, was also performed at the McGill University Comparative Medicine & Animal Resources Centre Diagnostic Laboratory. high resolution X-ray images were captured on a Faxitron MX-20 instrument at the McGill Centre for Bone and Periodontal Research. samples were processed for methylmethacrylate embedding and sectioning. an open-type osteotomy technique was performed to simulate intramedullary tibial nailing in 4m mice. mice received dual mode analgesia using carprofen (10 mg/kg) and slow release buprenorphine (1 mg/kg), administered SC 30 min pre-op. two weeks after the procedure, mice were euthanized and re-administered. all scans were made using the Skyscan 1.5 software at a source voltage of 65kV and a source current of 153 A. a total vertical segment of 9mm was scanned for every sample generating around 900 consecutive transverse image slices. blots were washed 3-times 20min with 10mM imidazole-HCl buffer (pH6.8) containing 60mM KCl and 5mM MgCl2. blots were rinsed 3-times with distilled H2O, once for 5min. a targeting vector was constructed and used to create a global conventional gene KO of Bril in mice. the targeting strategy replaced the 2 coding exons of the Bril gene by the nuclear localization signal (NLS)-tagged LacZ and PGK-Neo cassettes configured in a tail to tail orientation. the identity of the final construct was confirmed by Sanger sequencing on an Applied Biosystem 3730xl DNA Analyzer. positive mutant ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts by the transgenic core facility. then implanted into pseudo-pregnant females to generate chimeric mice. all animals used (n = 256) in subsequent analyses have a mixed genetic background. RNA and protein extractions were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel. protein pellets were re-suspended in NP-40 cell lysis buffer. extracted proteins were combined with 4x Laemmli buffer. boiled for 10 minutes and then stored at -20\u00b0C.

RT-qPCR was run on a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the Relative Quantification plate assay function of the 7500 System Sequence Detection Software (SDS) v.1.3.0. all data were normalised to -actin and values were expressed as 2(-Ct) high resolution X-ray images were captured on a faxitron MX-20 instrument. samples were processed for methylmethacrylate embedding and sectioning. sections were de-plasticized with 4 consecutive 20 min baths in ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate (Fisher) an open-type osteotomy technique was performed to simulate intramedullary tibial nailing in 4m mice. mice received dual mode analgesia using carprofen (10 mg/kg) and slow release buprenorphine (1 mg/kg), administered SC 30 min pre-op. a 3mm vertical incision was made in the skin above the knee and the patellar ligament was exposed. all scans were made using the Skyscan 1.5 software at a source voltage of 65kV and a source current of 153 A. the samples were then scanned in two parts at an image pixel size of 4.84 m. for every 0.45 degrees of sample rotation, 3 image frames were retained. blots were washed 3-times 20min with 10mM imidazole-HCl buffer (pH6.8) containing 60mM KCl and 5mM MgCl2. blots were rinsed 3-times with distilled H2O, once for 5min. a targeting vector containing 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 homology arms of 3.9 and 4.1kb, respectively, was constructed and used to create a global conventional gene KO of the Bril gene. the strategy replaced the 2 coding exons of Bril by a nuclear localization signal (NLS-LacZ)-tagged LacZ (NLS-LacZ) and the pGK-Neo cassette. the construct was electroporated into R1 129sv Western blot analyses of BRIL in proteins extracted from 6w old humeri (WT n = 4, KO n = 2) or calvaria (WT n = 5, KO n = 3). whole embryos at various stages of embryonic development were dissected and processed for whole mount X-Gal staining (blue) many blue nuclei stained cells were visible only over bony rudiments. strong labeling was also observed in the head, the mandible (Fig 2B), calvaria (Fig 2C) and orbital bone (Fig 2D) no other cell types produced specific X-Gal staining including growth plate chondrocytes and marrow cells. X-Gal staining shows nuclear staining in E15.5 mandible (B), calvaria (C), orbital bone (D), forearm (E), and E17.5 femur (F) no gross skeletal abnormalities were visible and no spontaneous fractures were observed. intercross of Bril KO mice yielded all 3 genotypes (WT 29%, HET 47%, KO 24%) not significantly different from the expected Mendelian ratio (25% females were recorded at post-natal ages 6w, 3m, and 8m. male KO showed 15% decreased body weight only at 3m. male KO showed 9% and 4.5% reduction in femur length at 6w and 3m. goldner (green/pink) and vonKossa (black) staining images were captured at low and high magnification (boxed areas) vonKossa counterstain is toluidine blue. microcomputed tomography was performed on distal femurs at 6w, 3m and 8m for both males and females. cortical CT analysis conducted on 6w, 3m and 8m old female (top row) and male (bottom row) distal femurs. black bars represent WT groups and white bars represent KO groups. values represent mean SD at each age point. RT-qPCR gene expression monitoring in humeri. levels were normalized to -actin and presented as relative to those measured in the WT. expression levels of Iftm1, 2, and 3 also did not differ in calvaria of 6w KO from WT. blood was collected and serum was processed for analytical biochemistry measurements. Elisa were run to assay for markers of collagen type I formation (P1NP) and resorption (C-terminal telopeptides (CTX-I) in actively growing juvenile (6w) and adult (3m) males. a rodded fracture repair experiment was conducted on the left tibia of cohorts of 4m old Bril HET and KO mice. the tibias were processed for uCT and, after decalcification, histological analyses. the BT/TV percentage was determined using a fixed volume. bars represent mean SD. no differences in the BV/TV of the fracture callus were detected between the two groups. there was no evidence of 45Ca binding to BRIL. recombinant mouse CAML and BRIL were separated on duplicate 8\u201316%. proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and assayed. a slight but non-statistically significant reduction of Bril expression was noted in the heterozygote (HET) Western blotting also demonstrated the absence of any BRIL protein in both the humerus and calvaria. X-Gal staining was first detected at E13.5, presenting a diffuse staining in the tail region, and a specific slight staining in the bony rudiment in the mandible and limbs. intense staining was visible in parietal and interparietal regions of forming calvaria, mandible, midshaft portion of the forelimbs and hindlimbs, ossified portion of the rib cage, weak X-Gal staining was also detected in the nostril area and in the incisor pulp/odontoblasts region. a quantitative assessment of beta-galactosidase activity performed on 9w old calvarial protein extracts still showed considerable activity in the het and KO samples. Bril KO mice appeared grossly indistinguishable from littermates at birth and throughout life, up to 8m of age. no gross skeletal abnormalities were visible and no spontaneous fractures were observed. interbreeding of Bril KO mice produced comparable size litters. whole body alizarin red and alcian blue staining of 2-day-old pups revealed no striking differences in bone shape, size, or mineralization. phenotypic analysis of Bril WT, HET, and KO mice at age 6w, 3m and 8m. male and female KO mice showed transient decreases in some of the parameters measured. females had significantly decreased bone areal fraction at 6w (11%) and 3m (7%) male KO mice had a 10% decrease in bone areal fraction at 6w but not at 3m. white bars represent WT groups and white bars represent KO groups. values represent mean SD at each age point. group size is n = 5 for all age points except 3m and 8m old KO groups where n = 3. expression levels of Iftm1, 2, and 3 also did not differ in calvaria of 6w KO from WT. expression levels were normalized to -actin and data are plotted relative to WT values for each gene. a more extensive biochemistry panel was tested on the serum of 3m males. only alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) activity was slightly decreased in the Bril KO as compared to WT (83.8 9.9 versus 100.8 8.2 U/L respectively) the tibias were processed for uCT and histological analyses. the BV/TV was calculated using a fixed tissue volume. no significant differences were detected between males and females. recombinant mouse BRIL and calmodulin (CALM) proteins tagged at their N-terminus with a 6-histidine epitope were produced in bacteria. CALM was chosen as a positive control because its size (17kDa) is comparable to that of BRIL (14kDa) a previously described mouse model with the global deletion of Bril pointed to some important, yet intermittent, role during skeletal development and growth, and perhaps even fertility [2]. transgenic overexpression of BRIL in osteoblast cells also failed to reveal any impact on bone [16]. staining over tissue sections corroborated the exquisite osteoblast-specific nature of Bril expression, which makes it a useful cell-surface biomarker. only rare non-osseous sites of expression (nostril and dental pulp/odontoblasts) were observed. KO mice showed no changes in bone morphometric parameters. if present, these potential defects would not be severe enough to cause early lethality as exemplified by the normal survival rate of KO homozygotes. trabecular bone density indicated a 25% deficit in young growing 6w females, which tapered off by 3m and 8m. cortical areal bone percentages also decreased by 10% in both males and females at 6w. no changes in bone turnover and osteoclasts resorption activity remained unchanged. the absence of a skeletal phenotype in the ALPL heterozygote KO mice [41] would argue that the small changes caused by the absence of BRIL would not be sufficient to impact overall bone parameters. the primary function of IFITM1 to 3 is to block cellular entry and infection against a broad range of viruses. a potential role for BRIL would be to serve as a homotypic interface favoring interaction between osteoblasts. it has been previously proposed that the C-terminal tail of BRIL possesses a potential calcium binding motif. this is based on the conserved acidic-rich domain present at the C-terminal end of BRIL. this function could be analogous to that of annexins and pannexins. both roles would be dispensable and not essential for osteoblast function. ongoing molecular characterization of aberrant mutant BRIL might provide some informative clues. cancellous static histomorphometry measurements done on 9-week WT and KO males (mean SE, n = 4).
