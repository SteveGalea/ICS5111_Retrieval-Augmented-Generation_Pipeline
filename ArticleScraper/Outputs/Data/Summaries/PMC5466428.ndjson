{"summary": "a total of 1208 adult and pediatric respiratory samples were submitted to MetroHealth Medical Center for respiratory pathogen screening. of these, 832 samples were from adults (age >18 years) samples were collected at outpatient clinics, inpatient wards, and emergency department (ED) samples were placed in M4-RT viral transport media. the open reading frame 1aboratory region of the ribonucleic acid polymerase was used to identify CoV-HKU1. the limit of detection titer for CoV-HKU1 was 1.57E+04 genome copies/mL (Package Insert, NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel Assay) clinical data collection was approved by the MetroHealth Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB16-00162) sample preparation and Viral Screening Testing was performed using the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel CE-IVD assay kits (Luminex, Austin, TX) in brief, 35 L of extracted nucleic acid were added directly to preplated, lyophilized reagents. multiplexed reverse- transcription polymerase chain reaction and bead hybridizations were performed in each plate well under a single cycling program. samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swabs (Puritan 6\" Sterile Standard Polyester Swab, Guilford, ME) all samples were collected at outpatient clinics, inpatient wards, and emergency department (ED) samples were placed in M4-RT viral transport media and transported to the laboratory where they were frozen until testing. the limit of detection titer for CoV-HKU1 was 1.57E+04 genome copies/mL (Package Insert, NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel Assay). clinical data collection Sample collection and data analysis were approved by the MetroHealth Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB16-00162). RESULTS Coronaviruses detected from all respiratory specimens during the study period is summarized in Table 1. all adults with HCoV-HKU1 infection had respiratory symptoms (Table 3). shortness of breath was the most common respiratory complaint (77%) followed by cough (62%) and rhinorrhea (54%). fever, wheezing, and chest pain were less common. two (29%) were admitted to the ICU. two patients were male. three were diagnosed with sepsis, one of whom developed septic shock and died. laboratory findings were obtained in 9 (69%) of the coV-HKU1 adults. of these, leukocytosis (white blood cell count [WBC] >11000 cells/L) was observed in 5 (56%), with an average of 29600 cells/L (range, 13600\u201349700 cells/L) coronaviruses OC43 and NL63 had a more prolonged circulation but also predominated during these same 4 weeks. the number of coV-HKU1-positive samples (light grey) and non-CoV-HKU1 CoV species (black) is displayed. smoking is an independent predictor of MERS-CoV acquisition in Saudi Arabia [16] among 50% of smokers with CoV-HKU1 pneumonia in Hong Kong, China [11]. increased respiratory infections are hypothesized to be secondary to continuing parenchymal trauma and suppression of host resistance over time [17]. we identified gastrointestinal symptoms in 38% of coV-HKU1-positive adults. non-coVs, such as influenza, have also been detected in stool specimens. it is interesting to note that adults identified with Cov-HKU1 had higher than expected severity of disease in our study. both patients were immunocompromised with history of cancer, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, and lymphopenia. another death linked to CoV-HKU1 was reported in a severely immunocompromised patient lymphodepleted by conditioning for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. the clinical relevance of respiratory viral coinfections is not fully understood. a quantitative viral load for CoV was unchanged in cases of coinfection with RSV and monoinfection. the majority of coV-HKU studies in the literature are single-center experiences occurring over 1 season. more studies are needed to understand the seasonality, risk factors, incidence, and epidemiology of coV-HKU1."}
