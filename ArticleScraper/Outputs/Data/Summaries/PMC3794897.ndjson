{"summary": "emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) continue to represent a significant public health threat, as illustrated by the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. of particular concern are the 60%+ of EIDs of zoonotic origin [1], [2] and notable examples include hantaviruses [4], Nipah and Hendra viruses [5] and HIV [6]. this comparison can be performed by statistical techniques able to discriminate phenotype (host) relevant variables (alleles) here we apply feature selection methods which identify a subset of variables which can be used to build a robust phenotype classifier [16]. the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree obtained from full polymerase sequences is presented in (c) tree branch lengths reflect the number of amino acid differences per sequence. analysis of sequences of viruses which have fully adapted to specific host species is insufficient to distinguish between subset of mutations required to allow cross-species emergence and later non-essential mutations. human patient samples from a small outbreak in 2004 are more closely related to palm civet 2004 samples than to any human sample from the previous year. the close proximity between the bat samples and the first samples from the human 2003 epidemic suggests that the transition from palm civet to human occurred quite rapidly after the transition from bat to palm civet. human patient samples from 2002/2003 collected in early, mid and late epidemic phase are labelled HP03E (green), HP03M (purple) and HP03L (yellow); 2004 Human samples are labelled HP04 (black); palm civets samples collected in 2003 and 2004 are labelled PC03 (blue) and PC04 (red); bat samples are labelled BT (magenta). the advantage of RFA compared with phylogenetic methods is that it allows a probability of \u201cbelonging\u201d to each host species to be estimated for each virus sample. we can examine whether a virus isolated in one species is in fact native to a different species from that in which they were isolated. the PB2 Influenza A gene is highly conserved across subtypes. it is highly conserved across subtypes and its evolution has been hypothesised to reflect host specific adaptation. a multi-class RFA is able to identify a significant larger subset of amino acids in known antigen sites. 190 and 225 mutations are highly conserved throughout our sequences. 190D is highly conserved throughout our sequences, contrasting with the 190E amino acid found in avian samples. all the viruses examined contain samples with the 225D allele. human+Pandemic human+Swine 26/49 (53%) 12/26 (46.2%) 80, 81, 145,156, 158, 159, 159, 163, 169, 171, 187, 189, 196, 198, 208 0.0024 RFA (2 way analysis) 7 influenza subtypes (H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, H3N2, H5N2, H3N8, H7N7) were collected in 5 different hosts (humans, birds, pigs, dogs, and horses) a subset of 23 host discriminant positions (Table S9) out of which only 7 fall outside known functional domains [37], [38]. a closer look at the identified sites reveals that all lie on the surface of the protein. phylogeny shapes evolution of viruses by affecting cross-species mutational barriers. influenza H1N1 viruses found in human hosts are more similar (on average) to avian viruses than other mammalian hosts. transmission between birds and some mammalian hosts is more frequent. non-parametric machine-learning based methods are more appropriate in the context of RNA viruses, by identifying sets of substitutions associated with a particular phenotypic class, rather than solely evaluating the significance of individual polymorphisms. the incorporation of interactions among predictor variables in RFA makes it possible to identify possible epistatic effects, as highlighted in Figure 3. genotype to phenotype mapping using host reservoir as the discriminant phenotype can reveal evolutionary trajectories of RNA viruses in rapid expansion and under great evolutionary pressure. RFA enables the circumvention of some biases through cross-validation, sampling with replacement and attribution of weights to unequally sampled groups. data preparation The information within a given sequence alignment was numerically recoded into an allele frequency matrix. starting from a multiple sequence alignment, all conserved sites are discarded, and a presence/absence matrix of all other alleles is assembled. the relationship between a set of viral sequences can be represented through dimensional reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) each bootstrap run is a realisation of the complete feature selection procedure. this removes selection bias concerns on the importance of the most significant variables. the random forest algorithm offers excellent performance in classification tasks. phylogenetic analysis, direct comparison of genetic sequences is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the datasets. but the relationship between a set of viral sequences can be represented through dimensional reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) here we use PCA simply as a tool to graphically represent the variance in our datasets. we can then assess how well feature selection clusters RNA viruses by phenotype class (here host reservoir) Figure S2 RFA error rates as a function of the number of variables in the forest and solution stability for 4 viral taxa. X = 10 for blue and X = 30 for red points in the Rabies and SARS RFA runs. X = 25 for blue and X = 100 for red points in the influenza runs. the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in number of substitutions per site. there were a total of 1014 positions in the final dataset. a total of 1014 positions were eliminated.
