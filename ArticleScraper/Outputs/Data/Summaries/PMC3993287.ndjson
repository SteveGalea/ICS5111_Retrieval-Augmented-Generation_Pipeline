{"summary": "a variety of respiratory viruses, including influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, could be present at high concentrations in human saliva and respiratory mucus (1\u20133) when infected individuals cough, sneeze, speak, or simply breathe, particles of saliva and/or respiratory mucus can be easily generated (4, 5), resulting in an increased risk of viral infection by aerosols. MS2 bacteriophage aerosolized from artificial saliva has been found to survive better than that from deionized water. 0.25% tryptone solution or 0.3% beef extract (10, 13) suggests artificial saliva may indeed affect the survival of airborne viruses differently from other commonly used artificial nebulizer suspensions. however, it remains unclear how closely artificial saliva could represent human saliva in terms of preserving airborne virus infectivity. airborne MS2 bacteriophage is a small (27-nm), tailless, nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA coliphage. it was propagated and titrated using Escherichia coli famp (ATCC 700891) as host cells. human saliva was collected from a subject under unstimulated conditions. the subject rinsed the mouth thoroughly using DI water and sat upright. the subject spit it out every 1 min into a 50-ml tube until 45 ml of saliva was collected. titer of freshly prepared nebulizer suspensions ranged from 2 108 to 6 108 PFU/ml. experimental setup and test procedure. main element is a one-pass vertical aerosol test tunnel. gelatin filters have a very high collection efficiency for MS2 aerosol (33) the sampling time was limited to 15 min in order to minimize desiccation. the sampling time was limited to 15 min in order to minimize desiccation. serially diluted samples in phosphate-buffered saline were added to 4 ml of 0.75% tryptic soy agar (TSA) maintained at 48\u00b0C along with 0.1 ml of log-phase E. coli. plates were then inverted, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. viral titers were expressed as PFU/ml. two parameters, IV and TV, were calculated: IV = (CIV,neb/CF,neb)a/(CTV,neb/CF,neb)b and TV = (CTV,neb/CF,neb)a/(CTV,neb/CF,neb)b. the inclusion of CF,neb in the equations takes into account the possible artificial increase of the virus concentration due to water evaporation from the suspension the amount of infectious or total virus carried per particle, v(Dp) was calculated as the ratio of the total amount of virus collected by the gelatin filter to the total number of particles measured by the SMPS. the relative recovery of infectious virus (RRIV) was calculated: RRIV(Dp) = [CIV,gel(Dp)/CF,gel(Dp)]/(CTV,neb/CF,neb) infectious-to-total virus ratio (ITR) in the aerosol sample was normalized by the same ratio in the nebulizer suspensions. nebulizer suspensions were evaluated: human saliva (HS), artificial saliva (AS), and artificial saliva with no mucin (ASNM). whole human saliva was collected from a subject under unstimulated conditions. subject rinsed the mouth thoroughly using DI water and sat upright with the head slightly tilted forward and the eyes open. the subject spit it out every 1 min into a 50-ml tube until 45 ml of saliva was collected. the titer of freshly prepared nebulizer suspensions ranged from 2 108 to 6 108 PFU/ml. the main element is a one-pass vertical aerosol test tunnel. before each experiment, the tunnel was first purged using HEPA-filtered air. latin filters have a very high collection efficiency for MS2 aerosol (33) the sampling time was limited to 15 min in order to minimize desiccation, which adversely affects the infectivity of the collected virus. the sampling time was limited to 15 min in order to minimize desiccation. in phosphate-buffered saline were added to 4 ml of 0.75% tryptic soy agar (TSA) maintained at 48\u00b0C along with 0.1 ml of log-phase E. coli. plates were inverted, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h, and examined for the production of viral plaques. viral titers were expressed as PFU/ml. two parameters, IV and TV, were calculated: IV = (CIV,neb/CF,neb)a/(CTV,neb/CF,neb)b. they compare the concentration ratio of infectious (CIV,neb) or total (CTV,neb) virus to fluorescence intensity (CF,neb) in the nebulizer suspension before (b) and after (a) nebulization. the relative recovery of infectious virus (RRIV) was calculated. RRIV represents the fraction of infectious virus recovered relative to the fluorescence recovered, and it serves as an indication of the survival of airborne virus (18, 24). data obtained for different nebulizer suspensions at different particle sizes were statistically analyzed using one-way or multiway analysis of variance. a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the size distributions of TSB and ASNM were log-normal with count median diameters of 76.5 and 64.3 nm, respectively. however, the sizes of particles generated from HS were bimodally distributed. the primary mode at 50 nm had a magnitude almost twice that of the secondary mode at 80 nm. data points for infectious virus and total virus size distributions at 100 nm were not plotted since no virus was recovered. similar plots for cell culture medium (i.e., 3% TSB), artificial saliva, and artificial saliva without mucin are available in Fig. S2 in the supplemental material. RRIV is plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of particle size for the four nebulizer suspensions. two-way ANOVA showed that RRIV was independent of particle size. but significantly depended on the type of nebulizer suspension (P 0.001). TSB and AS had similar RRIVs, much higher than those of HS and ASNM. TSB gave the highest particle size averaged ITR (0.915), followed by AS (0.527), HS (0.242), and ASNM (0.114). TSB gave the highest particle size averaged ITR (0.915), followed by AS (0.527), HS (0.242), and ASNM (0.114). the size distributions of TSB and ASNM were log-normal with count median diameters of 76.5 and 64.3 nm, respectively. however, the sizes of particles generated from HS were bimodally distributed. the primary mode at 50 nm had a magnitude almost twice that of the secondary mode at 80 nm. data points for infectious virus and total virus size distributions at 100 nm were not plotted since no virus was recovered. similar plots for cell culture medium (i.e., 3% TSB), artificial saliva, and artificial saliva without mucin are available in Fig. S2.

MS2 bacteriophage is very hydrophobic (51) and tends to accumulate at the AWI. increased concentration of salts in generated droplets due to water evaporation decreases the size of the virus double layer, further promoting virus adsorption at the AWI. cross-linking network of mucin forms a thin layer to encapsulate virus in aerosols. this layer may reduce virus exposure to AWI and thus boost survival. however, the protection level offered by mucin may not monotonically increase with its concentration. sol, then the infectious-to-total virus ratio (ITR) may underestimate it. an ideal particle tracer must be highly stable in aerosol. uranine is still the most reliable particle tracer (30, 41) saliva from multiple donors should be tested in the future to determine variation in the population. it is difficult to predict the effect of human saliva and artificial suspensions on airborne viruses based on the results with MS2. the four nebulizer suspensions gave similar values, suggesting that the insensitivity of virus to nebulization stress is not unique for cell culture media but occurs for other suspensions also. the small physical size and inertia of the virus makes it experience lower nebulization stress than bacteria (31). salivary micelles are multicomponent protein complexes in HS with globular structures (42) they are often in the form of individual particles or aggregates. the addition of mucin to ASNM changed the size distribution from log-normal to multimodal. nebulizer suspensions inevitably generate many virus-free residual particles, even if suspensions with high virus titers are used. survival of airborne MS2 was highest for TSB and AS, moderate for HS, and lowest for ASNM, as indicated by the values of RRIV. water evaporation decreases the size of the virus double layer, further promoting virus adsorption at the AWI. inactivation of MS2 in the aerosol phase could be a combined result of exposure to AWI and the hygroscopic nature of the particles. the fraction of virus inactivation due to viral RNA damage was 0.97, 0.89, 0.72, and 0.76 for TSB, HS, AS, and ASNM respectively. inactivation of several enveloped viruses has been shown to result mainly from their damaged viral capsid and/or envelope proteins. artificial nebulizer suspensions, even artificial saliva, did not produce the same effect as human saliva on the infectivity and survival of airborne MS2 bacteriophage. a significant difference in the survival of several veterinary viruses between cell culture media and animal salivary fluid was also reported. a significant difference in the survival of several veterinary viruses between cell culture media and animal salivary fluid was also reported (54, 57\u201359). uranine was used as a particle tracer but changed the composition of nebulizer suspensions. uranine has been shown to be toxic to airborne virus."}
