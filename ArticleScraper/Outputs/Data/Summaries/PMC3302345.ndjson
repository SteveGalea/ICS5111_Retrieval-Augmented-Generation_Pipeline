{"summary": "as of 10 October 2011, 566 human H5N1 infections have been confirmed. in humans, HPAI H5N1 virus infection was characterized by severe pneumonia, lymphopenia, hypercytokinemia. passive immunization by vertical acquisition of specific antibodies is also associated with influenza virus immunity in early infancy in humans. transfusion of convalescent-phase plasma from a patient recovered from the 1918 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d resulted in a dramatic reduction of viral loads and complete recovery (50) subclade 2.3.4 is becoming one of the dominant strains in poultry and birds in Southeast and East Asia (16) one study has shown that at least four major antigenic groups exist among circulating human H5N1 isolates. one such antibody, 65C6, showed potent neutralization activity against all clades and subclades of H5N1 strains except subclade 7.2. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium. all efforts were made to minimize suffering. female mice at the age of 6 to 8 weeks were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. l-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml) were maintained in complete DMEM. Drosophila S2 cells were maintained in complete DMEM. the panel covers all 10 clades and all 5 subclades of clade 2 of H5 HA. the panel covers all 10 clades and all 5 subclades of clade 2 of H5 HA. the methods used to generate the codon optimized-H5 and H1 HAs and Flag epitope-tagged N1 NA. serially diluted antibodies 65C6, 100F4, and 3C11 were incubated with the pseudotypes for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after overnight incubation, cells were washed and cultured in complete DMEM. the 95% inhibitory concentration (IC95) was calculated as the amount of a given antibody that resulted in 95% reduction of luciferase activity. the resulting vector cassettes were designated pMT/Bip/1 constant, pMT/Bip/1 constant, and pMT/Bip/1 constant respectively. in the first experiment we screened 8,000 wells in 96-well plates. in the second experiment we screened an additional 8,000 wells in 96-well plates. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription. the amplified VH, V, and V gene segments of human immunoglobulin were then PCR amplified using a set of degenerate primer pairs. supernatants were harvested to screen neutralization activity. heavy-chain genes from transfected cells whose supernatants showed the highest neutralization activity were sequenced and used for subsequent cotransfection. to identify the correct light-chain genes for pairing, each light-chain gene from the or chain library was cotransfected into Drosophila S2 cells. culture supernatants were tested for their ability to neutralize H5N1 pseudotypes. the clones designated 65C6, 3C11, and 100F4 were chosen for human monoclonal antibody production. filtered supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. samples mixed with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were loaded onto a HiTrap protein G HP 5-ml column. anti-human IgG antibody (1 g/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 was applied overnight at 4\u00b0C. the wells were washed 5 times with PBS-Tween 20 (PBST) and anti-human IgG antibody diluted to 1:1,000 in PBST plus 0.1% BSA was added. the substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate was added for optical density measurement at 405 nm. Western blotting. serial dilutions (from 2090 nM to 84 nM) of soluble recombinant HA derived from strain A/Anhui/05/01 were injected at a constant flow rate of 50 l/min for 180 s at 25\u00b0C. soluble recombinant HA was absorbed to thin carbon support films freshly stripped from mica. epitope mapping of 65C6 was carried out at two levels, the domain level and the fine-epitope level. a previously generated combinatorial library of H5 HA fragments displayed on the surface of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells was used as described before (52) 500 ng of antibody 65C6 and anti-c-myc chicken IgY (1:200 dilution) on ice for about 1 h. cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then incubated with PE-labeled anti-human IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-chicken IgG (1:400 dilution) 6 mice from each group were injected i.p. with 1 ml of control antibody TG15 or antibody 65C6 at 40 mg/kg. mice lost more than 35% of their preinfection body weight were euthanized. both plasma and cell samples were collected during early convalescence (6 months after illness onset) both plasma and cell samples were stored at 80\u00b0C until use. all animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. the 50% tissue culture infective dose was determined by serial titration of viruses in MDCK cells. groups of 5 mice were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with serial 10-fold dilution of virus. after the inoculation, mice were monitored daily for clinical signs for 14 days. the methods used to produce influenza virus HA and NA pseudotypes and the pseudotype-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) control were described before (43) PN assay used to screen neutralizing-antibody activity in convalescent-phase plasma was carried out as described previously (43) a given antibody resulted in 95% reduction of luciferase activity. an equal volume of horse red blood cells was added to the wells. incubation was continued on a gently rocking plate for 30 min at room temperature. Isolated CD22+ cells (30 cells per well) were cultured with bead-conjugated anti-human CD22 antibody (Miltenyi) as described in manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples from cells in positive wells after second-round subcloning were isolated. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription. segments were inserted into vector cassettes pMT/Bip/1 constant, pMT/Bip/1 constant, and pMT/Bip/1 constant, respectively, to generate heavy and and light chain gene libraries. each heavy-chain gene from the heavy-chain library paired with the and chain library was cotransfected into Drosophila S2 cells using a calcium phosphate precipitation method. library paired with the heavy-chain library was cotransfected into Drosophila S2 cells. supernatants were harvested to screen neutralization activity. the and chain genes from transfected cells whose supernatants showed the highest neutralization activity were then sequenced and used for subsequent cotransfection. stable S2 clones 65C6, 3C11, and 100F4 were inoculated into 2-liter cell bags along with 300 ml prewarmed fresh SFM. two days later, 400 ml fresh SFM was added to the cell bags. agitation settings initially were 22 rpm (rocking rate) and 8\u00b0 (angle) supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and filtered at 0.45 m. samples mixed with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were loaded onto a HiTrap protein G HP 5-ml column. antibody concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PDVF) membranes. membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. HA was prepared by disrupting purified virus in 1% N,N-dimethyl dodecylamine-N-oxide (Fluka)\u201310 mM Tris (pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. HA and NA glycoproteins were recovered from the 55,000 rpm (10 min) supernatant. myces cerevisiae cells were collected by centrifugation (12,000 rpm/s, 1 min), washed once with PBS, and incubated with 500 ng of antibody 65C6 on ice for about 1 h. cells were then washed twice with cold PBS and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using an Aria II instrument. four groups of female BALB/c mice were inoculated i.p. with 1 ml PBS containing 15 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg of 65C6 or 15 mg/kg of control antibody TG15. after 4 h, 6 mice in each group were i.n. inoculated with 50 l PBS containing 5 MLD50 of HPAI H5N1 A/Shenzhen/406H/06 virus. the weight and the survival of each individual animal were counted as an individual value for statistical analysis. a blood sample from a Chinese adult who had recovered from subclade 2.3.4 H5N1 infection (50) was collected at 6 months postinfection. the plasma derived from the blood sample exhibited high neutralizing-antibody titers against both clade 1 and subclade 2.3.4 H5N1 viruses. from 16,000 EBV-transformed B cell supernatant samples, 6 supernatants exhibited at least 2-log10 neutralization activity. from these positive wells, we isolated RNA, constructed heavy- and light-chain gene libraries. we eventually generated 3 stable Drosophila S2 cell transfectant clones that secrete fully human monoclonal antibodies 65C6, 100F4 and 3C11. compared to germ line sequences, the VH and the V chains of antibody 100F4 contain 11 and 5 mutations, respectively. the VH and the V chains of antibody 3C11 contain 14 and 4 mutations, respectively. binding of antibodies 65C6, 100F4, and TG15 was measured by Western blot analysis. antibodies 100F4, 65C6, and 3C11 were calculated to be 2.42 109, 4.14 108, and 7.02 108 M, respectively. antibody TG15 neutralized 16 H5N1 and H1N1 pseudotypes, with IC50s ranging from 0.018 g/ml against A/Hong Kong/156/97 to 62.192 g/ml against A/Goose/Shantou/1621/05. antibody 65C6 at 0.5 g/ml neutralized 16 H5N1 pseudotypes with the IC95 and at 1 g/ml neutralized 17 H5N1 pseudotypes with the IC95. for the remaining 6 H5N1 pseudotypes between 1.022 and 8.122 g/ml was required to reach the IC95. none of these antibodies exhibited any neutralization activity against H1N1 and VSV-G pseudotypes. l required to reach IC50 and IC95. antibody 65C6 completely inhibited all 6 H5N1 viruses tested. antibody 65C6 recognizes a conserved epitope on HAs from almost all clades and subclades of the H5 subtype. HA protein was derived from autologous strain A/Shenzhen/406H/06. each Fab of the antibody binds near an end of HA. each Fab also binds near an end of HA and forms a constant angle. sequence analysis of HA fragments isolated from PE-negative yeast clones indicated that the 65C6 epitope resides within the HA fragment comprising amino acid residues 51 to 260. to perform the fine-epitope mapping, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that display a random mutagenesis library of the HA fragment were constructed and incubated with antibody 65C6. among them, 13 amino acid residues, at positions 116, 117, 118 5 amino acid residues 118, 121, 161, 164, and 167 are adjacent to each other on the surface of HA. red indicates single- or multiple-amino-acid mutants that are more resistant to neutralization by antibody 65C6. compared to the wild-type H5N1 pseudotype, H5N1 pseudotypes expressing H5 HA mutants with a mutation at position 116, 117, 147, 152, 160, 162, 163, or 187 were similarly or even more susceptible to neutralization by antibody 65C6. in amino acid stretches of residues 117 to 121 and 159 to 167 of H5 HA, there are 5 amino acid differences at positions 121, 159, 162, position of 121 was resistant (26-fold increase at the IC80) to 65C6 neutralization by antibody 65C6. position of 121 was more resistant to neutralization than the H5N1 mutant pseudotype with a single mutation at position 121. in the group of mice that were inoculated with 5 mg/kg of antibody 65C6, mice got sick at 5 to 7 days postchallenge and 1 mouse died. in the group of mice that were inoculated with 15 mg/kg of antibody 65C6, no mice became sick or lost weight. 5N1 viruses A/Shenzhen/406H/06 and A/Cambodia/P0322095/05 injected i.p. with 40 mg/kg of antibody 65C6 or control antibody TG15 at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection. survival rate of each group during 14 days after challenge with HPAI H5N1 A/Shenzhen/406H/06. survival rate was calculated as percent survival within each experimental group. a blood sample from a Chinese adult who had recovered from subclade 2.3.4 H5N1 infection (50) was collected at 6 months postinfection. the plasma derived from the blood sample exhibited high neutralizing-antibody titers against both clade 1 and subclade 2.3.4 H5N1 viruses. 6,000 EBV-transformed B cell supernatant samples showed at least 2-log10 neutralization activity. from these positive wells, we isolated RNA, constructed heavy- and light-chain gene libraries, and eventually generated 3 stable Drosophila S2 cell transfectant clones that secrete fully human monoclonal antibodies 65C6, 100F4 and 3C11. antibody 100F4 contain 12 and 7 mutations, respectively, and the VH and the V chains of antibody 3C11 contain 14 and 4 mutations. binding of antibodies 65C6, 100F4, and TG15 was measured by Western blot analysis. mouse immune sera specifically bind to HA0, HA1 and HA2 of HA and NA VLPs but not to envelope protein from HIV-1 VLPs. antibody 3C11 neutralized 16 H5N1 and H1N1 pseudotypes, with IC50s ranging from 0.018 g/ml against A/Hong Kong/156/97 to 62.192 g/ml against A/Goose/Shantou/1621/05. antibody 3C11 neutralized all clades and subclades of H5N1 pseudotypes tested with a higher degree of potency. antibody 65C6 at 0.5 g/ml neutralized 16 H5N1 pseudotypes with the IC95 and at 1 g/ml neutralized 17 H5N1 pseudotypes with the IC95. for 2 H5N1 pseudotypes, derived from A/Thailand/KAN-1A/04 and A/Goose/Guiyang/337/06, 1.085 and 1.528 g/ml were needed to reach the IC95 between 0.3 and 2.7 g/ml of antibody 65C6 completely inhibited all 6 H5N1 viruses tested. antibody 65C6 recognizes a conserved epitope on HAs from almost all clades and subclades of the H5 subtype. this epitope is not shared by HAs of H1, H2 and H3 subtypes. one antibody binds to two individual HA molecules in a five-HA aggregate \u201crosette\u201d. each Fab also binds near an end of HA and forms a constant angle of about 110\u00b0 with HA. a schematic diagram for each complex is shown below. clones indicated that the 65C6 epitope resides within the HA fragment comprising amino acid residues 51 to 260. to perform the fine-epitope mapping, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells that display a random mutagenesis library of the HA fragment were constructed and incubated with antibody 65C6. clones identified 23 amino acid mutations that abolish the binding of 65C6. the 5 amino acid residues 118, 121, 161, 164, and 167 are adjacent to each other on the surface of HA. the 3D structure shows that the 5 amino acid residues 118, 121, 161, 164, and 167 are adjacent to each other as depicted in ribbon representation. 117, 147, 152, 160, 162, 163, or 187 were similarly or even more susceptible to neutralization by antibody 65C6. compared to the subclade 7.1 wild-type H5N1 pseudotype, the H5N1 mutant pseudotype with a single mutation at position of 121 was resistant (3.37-fold increases at the IC80) to 65C6 neutralization. antibody 65C6 neutralized female mice with a single mutation at position 121. i.p. 15, 5, and 1 mg/kg of antibody 65C6 or 15 mg/kg of control antibody TG15. a dose of 5 MLD50 was chosen to ensure 100% mortality in the control group. in the group of mice that were inoculated with 15 mg/kg of antibody 65C6, no mice became sick or lost weight. survival rate was calculated as percent survival within each experimental group (n = 5 mice per experimental group) figure 6A shows the time course of body weight changes and Fig. 6B shows the survival rate of each group during 14 days after challenge with HPAI H5N1 A/Cambodia/P0322095/05 virus. all mice infected with A/Cambodia/P0322095/05 survived with no significant weight loss. DISCUSSION Continuous zoonotic transmission of HPAI H5N1 viruses to humans remains a major public health threat. in this study, we report the development of three fully human monoclonal antibodies, 65C6, 100F4, and 3C11, from immortalized memory B cells of an individual who had recovered from infection with a subclade 2.3.4 HPAI H5N1 virus in china (50) antibody 65C6 could have potential for use in treatment of severe influenza cases. passive immunization by vertical acquisition of specific antibodies has been found to be associated with influenza immunity in early infancy in humans. transfusion of human blood products from patients recovered from the 1918 \u201cSpanish flu\u201d resulted in a 50% reduction in influenza mortality (from 37% to 16%) during the pandemic. e-mapping data show that antibody 65C6 binds to a conformational epitope. these amino acid residues are highly conserved among diverse H5 clades and subclades, except for subclade 7.2. in the three-dimensional structure, the 65C6 epitope was located in a region similar to that for two other epitopes recognized by human antibodies 2D1 (47, 49) and FLD21.140 (17, 32) we have developed three fully human monoclonal antibodies from immortalized memory B cells of an individual who had recovered from HPAI H5N1 virus infection (50). one such antibody, 65C6, exhibits broad and potent neutralizing activity against diverse H5N1 strains from all clades and subclades (except subclade 7.2) in vitro."}
