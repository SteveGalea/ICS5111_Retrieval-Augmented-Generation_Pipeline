{"summary": "human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly discovered parvovirus. increasing evidences are available to support its role as an etiologic agent in lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) a number of epidemiological and clinical investigations have been conducted to assess HBoV-related illness. the most frequent clinical diagnoses associated with respiratory HBoV are general upper respiratory tract infections, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma exacerbation. in this study we aimed to assess the relationship between the HBoV viral load in respiratory tract and clinical characteristics. all patients with suspected LRTI underwent chest radiography. the presence of focal infiltration or lung consolidation presented in chest radiography. amplification was performed on a lightCycler 1.2 instrument (Roche) with the following settings: 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. a plasmid (NPSC3.1) containing the HBoV NP-1 gene was used in serial dilutions covering a range of 6 logs. from 140 L of the aspirates using the QIAamp Virus RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, USA) samples were eluted in 60 L of RNase-free water. amplification was performed with a bio-Rad thermal cycler. a total of 186 sequential respiratory tract aspirates were collected. informed consent was written and signed by guardian before bronchoscopy. all patients with suspected LRTI underwent chest radiography. the suspension was filtered through 48 m nylon gauze to remove mucus and debris. the cell free supernatant was resuspended for viral antigen detection. the rest of aspirates were stored at 80\u00b0C for cytokine assay. the criteria for a positive reaction were defined as the cycle threshold 40 cycles and fluorescence count >0.5. the minimum genome viral load that would allow reproducible quantification was 10 copies per reaction, which corresponds to 500 copies/mL of respiratory tract aspirates. the unclassified RVs were identified as RVs. a patient was considered positive for the virus only if having at least one positive result from the two methods. HBoV DNA was detected by PCR in 31 out of 186 patient's samples (24.6%). all samples were tested for the other respiratory viruses, including RSV (32.8%), RV (22.4%), hMPV (2.4%), FLU (20%), HPIV (44%), HCoV (1.6%) and ADV (4.8%). the most frequent respiratory symptoms/signs (present in >50%) seen in HBoV-positive patients were cough and wheezing. significantly high frequency of wheezing (90.322% vs. 72.903%, p = 0.04) and dyspnea (41.935%, p = 0.001) were noted in 31 HBoV-positive patients. clinical characteristics of children who had HBoV detection with or without co-infection with other viruses or bacteria were shown in Table 3 and Table 4. the two groups were similar in all clinical manifestations, duration of hospitalization and wheezing. 37 Fever 5 (50%) 8 (38.10%) 0.701 Tachypnea 6 (60%) 14 (66.67%) 1.000 Dyspnea 3 (30%) 5 (23.81%) 1.000 Rhinorrhea 3 (30%) 4 (19.04%) 0.681 Cyanosis 4 (40%) 8 (38.10%) 1.000 Duration of presented wheezing (days) (meanSEM) 10.001.033 13.101.516 0.236 Duration of increased serum HBoV IgM and IgG had been found in most of patients who had high HBoV load (>104 copies/mL) in respiratory tract secretions, which was associated with respiratory symptoms [2], [15], [16]. HBoV-positive samples were divided into 2 non-overlapping populations. children were 14.671.93 days, which was significantly longer than in children with low HBoV viral load. IL-8 level was found higher than those who had low HBoV viral load.

P0.05 was considered to be significantly different between each other. of 15 samples with a high viral load (>104 copies/mL) and one group of 16 samples with a low viral load (104 copies/mL) each sample is represented by a single dot. clinical characteristics of patients with high HBoV viral load were detected in 15 patients. P0.05 was considered to be significantly different between each other. in patients with high HBoV viral load, IL-8 level was found higher than those who had low HBoV viral load. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were very similar between the two groups. cytokine/chemokine concentrations of respiratory tract aspirates in children who had HBoV detection with or without detection of bacteria. cytokine/chemokine concentrations of respiratory tract aspirates in children with HBoV detection with or without detection of bacteria. association of HBoV in respiratory tract aspirates, duration of hospitalization and days of wheezing Longer duration of hospitalization and days of wheezing were found among children with high HBoV loads. we looked at the correlation between viral loads and duration of hospitalization and days of wheezing. the days of wheezing showed a direct correlation with viral load. fifteen out of thirty-one HBoV-positive patients presented acute primary infection. HBoV was one of the common pathogens for children with serious LRTIs. HBoVs were frequently detected in asymptomatic children's respiratory tract secretions. HBoV viral load did not show significant influence on the presentations of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, such as cough, rhinorrhea, however high HBoV viral load led to more severe lower respiratory tract symptoms and longer hospitalization. no previous studies showed distinctive clinical signs that help to differentiate HBoV-positive infections from other viral infections. our data was consistent with the findings in these studies. we also investigated the relationship between HBoV viral load and duration of wheezing."}
