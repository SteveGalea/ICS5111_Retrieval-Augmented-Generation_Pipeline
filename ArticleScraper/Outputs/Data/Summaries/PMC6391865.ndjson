{"summary": "economic impact PRRSV is responsible for respiratory disease in weaned and growing pigs, as well as reproductive failures in sows. it is considered one of the most important swine diseases worldwide, with an economic impact estimated at $664 million in losses every year to U.S. producers. in europe, the situation is similar and economic disease models have been carried out to determine the economic burden in the best and worst case scenario. the majority of the genome (60\u201370%) encodes non-structural proteins involved in replication (ORF1a and ORF1ab), whereas ORFs 2\u20137 encodes structural proteins (N, M, GP2-GP5, E) an enormous genetic variability has been described. however, data on whole genome sequencing is scarce and constitute another important gap in the knowledge of PRRSV. resulting pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins yield at least 14 functional non-structural proteins (nsps), specifically nsp1 to nsp12. both the nsp1 and nsp7 parts are subject to internal cleavage (giving origin to nsp1 and nsp1 and nsp7, and nsp7, respectively), most of which assemble into a membrane-associated replication and transcription complex the viral envelope glycoproteins (GP2 to GP5) are the first interactors with host cell receptors to initiate infection. GP5 is thought to bind to sialoadhesin and virus internalization and uncoating is triggered by a formation of a viral heterotrimer (GP2a, GP3 and GP4) with scavenger receptor CD163. CD163 and CD169 play a main role during infection, uncoating of the viral particle, activation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and release of viral genome in the cytoplasm (20). pigs lacking SRCR5 region of CD163 show no side effects when kept under standard husbandry conditions. knockout pigs for either exon 1, 2, or 3 of CD169 were not protected from infection and viral load. a non-classical spread pathway has been detected in several viruses including PRRSV where virus dissemination is mediated by cell to cell nanotubules. this non-classical pathway demonstrated that PRRSV cell entry receptors were not necessary to establish infection. this spreading strategy has been proposed as a mechanism to facilitate infection either by surfing. the role of GP4 in this non-classical spread pathway is not fully understood. in vivo, the virus shows narrow cell tropism for monocytes and macrophages. suppressing IFN / also takes place in vivo in infected pigs. several viral proteins have been identified as IFN antagonists. nsp1 is considered as the strongest antagonist of IFN- production. nsp2 is the largest (mature) PRRSV protein and contains at least four distinct domains. it is unique in the context of PRRSV due to its genetic heterogeneity. previous studies suggest that nsp2 has different roles related to immune evasion mechanisms. nsp2 is a Nidovirus conserved endoribonuclease with an uridylate-specific endonuclease (NendoU) it has been demonstrated that overexpression of nsp11 enhanced viral titter (52). nsp11 antagonizes type I IFN, specifically IFN production, activated by the retinoic acid inducible gene 1 like receptor, showing substrate specificity toward mitochondrial anti ase activity of this protein in which transfection mutant viruses were unable to degrade MAVS mRNA and impair IFN production (53) it has been shown that PRRSV could activate NLRP3 inflammasome in early stages of infection but induce host's immunosuppression later as measured by determining the levels of pro-IL-1 and procaspase-1 mRNA and the mature IL-1 protein in porcine alveolar macrophages. the pig genetic variability after PRRSV infection has been historically overlooked in PRRSV research. pigs replicate in cells belonging to the innate immune system. pigs, PRRSV replicates in cells belonging to the innate immune system. a new type of PAM has been characterized and named porcine intravascular macrophages (PIM) due to its association to endothelial lung capillaries and not to the alveoli. new interactions between cells and the virus need to be further explored to unravel possible immunological features that leads to correlates of protection. this protein is also distributed in the nucleus, induced by two nuclear localization signals called cryptic NLS or NLS-1 and functional NLS or NLS-2. the effect of N protein has been examined in PAMs and MoDCs using transfection, finding a significant upregulation of IL-10 gene expression. neutrizing antibodies take longer, appearing nearly 1 month after infection. passive transfer of these neutralizing antibodies conferred almost full protection in a PRRSV reproductive model. pigs were apparently protected against infection. olysis (ADCV) have been examined in the context of PRRSV. none of these mechanisms were evident during infection. it is important to note that neutralizing antibodies appear late in PRRSV infection. other immune mechanisms might be acting to suppress viral replication. a small frameshift of the subgenomic mRNA called ORF5a is encoding a type I membrane protein consisting primarily of alpha helix. this protein is capable of eliciting specific antibody immune response in natural infections and after immunizations. the role of humoral immunity remains elusive in PRRSV infection (neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies) PRRSV-1 exhibited an unbalanced ability to stimulate T cell immune responses in a strain-dependent manner. but no Tregs were detected, at least in vitro, as measured by expression of CD25 and FoxP3 markers (98). this group suggested that IL-10 production and Treg could be related to impaired gamma interferon (IFN-) production and altered development of protective T-cell response by inhibiting T-cell proliferation. PRRSV immunology remains an unsolved puzzle due to complex interactions between different viral strains and the host. acute lymphopenia, thymic atrophy and lymphadenopathy associated with the presence of PRRSV antigens in the thymus are some of the mechanisms whereby PRRSV suppresses the immune response. a lack of knowledge on how the porcine immune system interacts with all PRRSV proteins. there is no relationship between complete homologous or heterologous protection and classic immunological parameters such as an increase/decrease in particular cell population (105), IFN- production, neutralizing antibodies and clinical outcome (107). cases have been reported in which new viruses have been introduced as a consequence of MLV vaccines. for example, nucleotide sequence identities of atypical Danish isolates were between 99.2 and 99.5% with the vaccine virus RespPRRS and 99.0\u201399.3% with VR2332, which is the parental virus to the vaccine virus. current inactivated vaccine approaches are not highly effective since elicited immune responses are not enough to prevent spreading of the virus. several attempts have been made to use structural proteins to develop vaccines against PRRSV because they are specific targets of neutralizing antibodies. a plausible explanation for this finding may be based on the presence of few neutralizing epitopes in their sequences. in lethal challenge trials, artificial microRNAs (amiRNA) were synthetized to try suppressing expression of sialoadhesin (Sn) or CD163 by recombinant adenoviral vectors to be contained in exosomes. a targeted-pig trial using EVs from sera of infected pigs who had overcome the disease demonstrated that EVs are safe, free-of-virus and can differentiate infected from vaccinated animals. viral proteins and diverse species of RNA were detected and capable of activating innate immune responses through induction of cytokine and chemokine release (135). similar scenarios of viral proteins exported in EVs have been observed and extensively reviewed for HIV/HCV/HTLV-1 (136), EBV (137), and other viral diseases. PRRSV has evolved a set of mechanisms for suppressing IFN / in vivo, maintaining low expression levels of this cytokines on infected pigs. the innate immune response is the first system any given pathogen encounters, specially to prevent viral replication and invasion into mucosal tissues. nsp1 is the strongest antagonist of IFN- production by acting on interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. nsp1 is the largest (mature) PRRSV protein and contains at least four distinct domains. nsp2 OTU domain (thiol-dependent deubiquitinating domain) inhibits the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) by interfering with the polyubiquitination process of IkB (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor) and, subsequently, preventing the degradation of the IkB protein (50). nsp11, is a Nidovirus conserved endoribonuclease with an uridylate-specific endonuclease (NendoU) it has been demonstrated that overexpression of nsp11 enhanced viral titter (52) it is not surprising that nsp11 also plays a role in modulating host cells innate immune response. this protein and nsp1 are responsible for inhibiting RISC and downregulating argonaute-2 protein expression increasing viral titter significantly. a key gap in the knowledge of PRRSV is linked the pig genetic variability after PRRSV infection with the enormous variability of the virus. a new type of PAM has been characterized and named porcine intravascular macrophages (PIM) due to its association to endothelial lung capillaries and not to the alveoli. a new type of PAM has been characterized and named porcine intravascular macrophages (PIM) due to its association to endothelial lung capillaries and not to the alveoli. a domain within Nsp1 is able to stimulate the secretion of CD83. this in turn inhibits MoDC function in vitro. production of IFN / and mechanisms for cell activation by pDC are severely suppressed during PRRSV infection. however, this phenomenon is strain dependent. in vitro, the NK cytotoxicity against PRRSV-infected PAMs was decreased and degranulation of NK cells inhibited. in vivo, the immune response is the same as that observed in vivo. in vivo, the immune response is the same as that observed in vivo. antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent complement mediated virolysis (ADCV) have been examined in the context of PRRSV. up to 3 glycosylations may be found in or flanking the GP5 neutralizing epitope. for PRRSV-1 strains, up to 3 glycosylations may be found. for PRRSV-2 strains there are four potential glycosylation sites (90) the role of humoral immunity remains elusive in PRRSV infection (neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies) a better characterization will be required to overcome this relevant gap of knowledge. in PRRSV, the role of Tregs remains unclear. a possible explanation could lay on their inability to induce an adequate IFN- response due to their ability to stimulate Tregs, at least in vitro (100). pigs developed a significantly shorter duration of viremia and higher neutralizing antibodies than those of wild-type PRRSV-infected pigs. the most important gap of knowledge for PRRSV is the lack of correlates of protection that makes extremely difficult to have robust models to check vaccines efficacy against this disease. there is no relationship between complete homologous or heterologous protection and classic immunological parameters. several different vaccines against PRRSV have reached the market. most of these vaccines rely on modified live virus against PRRSV-1. most of these vaccines rely on modified live virus. current inactivated vaccine approaches are not highly effective. this type of vaccine can increase anamnestic virus neutralizing antibodies and virus-specific IFN- responses following a wild-type virus infection. most inactivated vaccines are not approved for use in the u.s. due to poor efficacy. a critical gap of knowledge for PRRSV is to precisely characterize common epitopes present in all PRRSV strains. this evidence points to the need for new vaccination approaches that comply with a pathogen free strategy. extracellular vesicles are gaining increased scientific attention as novel vaccines against infectious diseases. a targeted-pig trial using EVs from sera of infected pigs who had overcome the disease demonstrated that EVs are safe, free-of-virus and can differentiate infected from vaccinated animals. a recent article indicated that PRRSV derived EVs are capable of transmitting the virus from one cell to another. EVs membrane or packaged into them and remained stable after fusion. cytotoxic activity potent enough to kill peptide-loaded and/or antigen-expressing syngeneic cells, proving promising results as a cytotoxic T lymphocyte vaccine (138) reviewer SG declared a past supervisory role with one of the authors MM to the handling editor. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
