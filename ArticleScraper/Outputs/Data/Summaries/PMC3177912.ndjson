{"summary": "pigs have receptors for both avian (sialic acid-alpha-2,3-terminal saccharides) and swine/human (SA-alpha-2,6) influenza viruses in the upper respiratory tract. experimental and natural infections in pigs have been reported with influenza A virus from avian and human sources. pigs have receptors for both human and avian strains of influenza A viruses in the upper respiratory tract and therefore are susceptible to infections by both. pigs have receptors for both human and avian strains of influenza A viruses in the upper respiratory tract. infAv is initiated by interactions between virus haemagglutinin and sialic acid molecules on target cells. human and swine influenza virus strains prefer SA--2,6-terminal saccharides as receptors. this shift in receptor specificity has been linked to amino acid substitutions. a more thorough investigation of the receptor distribution in the respiratory tract of pigs would give a more nuanced picture of the infection dynamic of different infAv in pigs. the aim of the study was to investigate the tissue and cell predilection sites of avian and swine influenza A viruses and SA--2,3/2,6-terminal saccharide receptor distribution in the respiratory tract of pigs. pigs were inoculated intranasally at post inoculation day (PID) 0 with 4 ml of A/swine/Denmark/10074/2004 (H1N1) 3rd passage and euthanized PID 4. negative controls One pig was not inoculated and was housed together with the AIV infected pigs. the pigs were inoculated with pure allantoic fluid from embryonated chicken eggs. two of the pigs were euthanized PID 4 and two pigs were euthanized PID 8. tissue from the 8 chickens included trachea, lung and intestines. tissue sections were deparaffinised in xylene, rehydrated through graded alcohols and washed three times in Tris buffered saline (TBS), pH 7,6 (0,05 M Tris-HCl, 0,15 M NaCl) all tissue sections were evaluated in double for IHC with infAv antibody. all lung sections and sections of nose and trachea were evaluated. the detection of SA--2,6-terminal saccharides, digoxigenin (DIG) labelled Sambucus nigra (SNA) lectin was used. the sections were washed three times in TBS and developed for 5 minutes at RT. a final wash was performed three times with TBS before the sections were mounted with glycergel. a weighted kappa test was calculated after evaluation [27] to generate the score for the lectin staining the whole tissue section was evaluated. sections from infAv infected animals containing both consolidated and unconsolidated areas were evaluated separately in the two parts. sections were incubated with peroxidase antiperoxidase (PAP), rabbit (DAKO cat. no. Z113) diluted 1:100 in 5% normal pig serum in TBS for 30 minutes at RT. development was performed in Fast Red substrate (KemEnTec diagnostics cat. no. 4210) for 20 minutes. the sections were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-SIV diluted 1:1000 in 5% normal pig serum in TBS for one hour at 37\u00b0C. the sections were then incubated with streptavidin--galactosidase (Roche cat. no. E0431) diluted 1:300 in 5% normal pig serum in TBS for 30 minutes at RT. sections were then incubated at RT for 30 minutes with alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP), mouse, complex (DAKO cat. no. D651) diluted 1:50 in 5% normal pig serum in TBS. sections were then counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin and then mounted with glycergel. double stained cells appeared purple. animals Landrace/Yorkshire (LY) pigs were bred for experimental use. they were free from the important pathogens: porcine circovirus 1, porcine circovirus 2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, swine influenza A virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, and Mycoplasma. pigs were tested negative for SIV and AIV before the experiments. two pigs were inoculated intranasally at PID 0 with 4 ml (105.9 TCID50 per ml) of A/swine/Denmark/10074/2004 (H1N2) 3rd passage and euthanized PID 4. Negative controls One pig was not inoculated and was housed together with the AIV infected pigs (sentinel) two pigs were inoculated intranasally at PID 0 with 4 ml (105.9 TCID50 per ml) of A/swine/Denmark/10074/2004 (H1N2) 3rd passage and euthanized PID 4. Negative controls One pig was not inoculated and was housed together with the AIV infected pigs (sentinel) the tissue from the 8 chickens included trachea, lung and intestines. the tissues were fixed in 10% PBS-buffered formalin for 24-30 hours. they were transferred to 70% ethanol where the tissues were stored for a maximum 14 days. all lung sections and sections of nose and trachea were evaluated. for the first evaluation of the lectin staining, all lung sections and sections of nose and trachea were evaluated. all microscopic evaluations of IHC and receptor staining were performed with an Olympus DP70 microscope. the sections were washed three times with TBS and incubated for one hour at RT. the lectin staining was evaluated in categories of percent of the lectin positive distribution on the epithelial cells in nose, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli. sections were washed three times in TBS before incubation for 30 minutes at RT. sections were then developed using DAB+ (DAKO cat. no. K3468) for 40 minutes at RT. sections were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-goat antibody (cat. no. E0466 DAKO) diluted 1:200 in 5% normal pig serum in TBS for 30 minutes at RT. development was performed in Fast Red substrate (KemEnTec diagnostics cat. no. 4210) for 20 minutes. polyclonal rabbit anti-SIV diluted 1:1000 in 5% normal pig serum in TBS for one hour at 37\u00b0C. sections were then incubated with streptavidin--galactosidase (Roche cat. no. 11112481001) diluted 1:1000 in 5% normal pig serum in TBS for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. staining was performed using X-Gal substrate (Histomark, Kirkegaard & Perry Labor goat anti-infAv antibody (cat. no. E0466 DAKO) diluted 1:200 in 5% normal pig serum in TBS. sections were then incubated with streptavidin-\u00df-galactosidase (Roche cat. no. 11112481001) diluted 1:1000 in 5% normal pig serum in TBS for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. in the left cranial lobes an average area of approximately 80% was consolidated. the accessory lobe had an average of 40% of the middle lobe was consolidated. the right and left caudal lobes were only sparsely affected. consolidations were seen in a lobular distribution in affected areas. a sparse cellular exudate was occasionally present in the lumen of alveoli and bronchioles. both influenza virus positive pigs (n = 8) and influenza virus negative pigs (n = 13) had a strong staining of the luminal part of the respiratory epithelial cells with the SNA lectin. lectin staining in nose, trachea, and lung from pigs. examples of lectin staining demonstrating infAv receptors SNA lectin. there was no differences in the SNA signal of the non-affected lung tissue among the different groups of pigs including the non-inoculated sentinel pig. epithelial cells in intestines and trachea of chickens were also highly positive for the SNA lectin. there was a very sparse signal for epithelial cells of the lungs. the staining is less on the epithelium in the lumen of the lung compared to the MAAI staining (E). only few epithelial cells of the alveoli and bronchioles were positive for the receptor SA--2,3-terminal saccharide when the MAAI lectin was used for staining. ciliated epithelial cells of trachea showed a luminal staining for MAAII lectin. but also fewer epithelial cells of the lung were positive. pigs showed a more pronounced individual variation compared to the MAAI lectin signal. a weighted kappa coefficient (w) of 0.73 was obtained. a coefficient of 1 is 100% agreement and the w = 0.73 is considered a good agreement between scores [27]. the results of the infAv antigen staining are summarized in Figure 4 and table 2.

PID = post inoculation day, *Single positive cell demonstrated, i = not done. the exudates in lumen of affected bronchi and bronchioles were often SIV antigen positive. pigs had more SIV antigen positive areas compared to the H1N1 infected pigs. negative in the pigs infected with AIV H4N6 (table 2). in the bronchi, only a single positive cell was seen in a few lung sections from pigs euthanized PID 4. the cells demonstrating AIV antigens were few and sporadically spread in the tissues. pigs from both the H1N1 and H1N2 infected groups had scattered SIV antigen positive cells. a lining of SIV antigen positive epithelial cells were seen predominantly in bronchi and bronchioles of the affected areas. the cranial lung lobes were most severely affected, especially the left cranial lobe. there was a clear correlation between areas of consolidated lung tissue and presence of SIV antigen positive cells. AIV antigens were demonstrated in alveoli and in some bronchioles. control pigs InfAv antigens could not be demonstrated in mock-inoculated pigs. the sentinel pig in the AIV inoculated group were also infAv antigen negative (table 2). Double-staining of infAv antigen and cytokeratin were found in the alveoli of the SIV infected pigs. double stained alveolar type I (arrow) and II epithelial cells (arrowhead) showed no difference in the number of infAv antigen positive cells in comparison to the infAv antigens found in the alveoli. double staining protocols showed the same number of positive cells when omitting either the infAv antibodies or the cytokeratin antibody. lectin staining and IHC were performed on parallel sections. it was especially clear when comparing lung sections from the SIV infected pigs where clear infAv antigen positive bronchioles were free from lectin staining. the lectin staining in the non-influenza infected part of the bronchiole is considerable stronger compared to the infected part (arrowhead) the lectin staining in the non-infected part of the bronchiole (arrowhead) is considerable stronger compared to the infected part (arrowhead) most human and swine influenza A viruses show highest affinity for SA--2,6-terminal saccharide receptors. most avian influenza A viruses show highest affinity for SA--2,3 receptors. previously studies of the respiratory tract of humans have shown that humans predominantly possess the SA--2,6 receptor and ducks expresses mainly the SA--2,3 receptor. several possible explanations for the discrepancies in receptor distribution found in different studies. one obvious source of variables is the choice of lectins used for the receptor staining. in order to detect all SA--2,3 receptors it is important to use both isoforms. infAv's predominantly infect the epithelial cells and are therefore not in contact with endothelia cells. infAv antigen positive cells have cleaved off the sialic acids during the infection. the distribution of the SIV antigen positive cells had a lobular distribution for both H1N1 and H1N2 infected pigs. the lung lesions and the distribution of SIV found in this study were similar to other SIV infection studies. low-grade infection after experimental inoculation with AIV in pigs is in agreement with other studies comparing AIV and SIV infections in pigs. the infAv receptors are modified or absent in pigs and pigs. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
