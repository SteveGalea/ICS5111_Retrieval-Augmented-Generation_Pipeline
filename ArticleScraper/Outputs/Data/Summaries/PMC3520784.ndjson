{"summary": "ATII cells and alveolar macrophages were isolated from human lungs. ATII cells were transdifferentiated to alveolar type I-like (ATI-like) cells. AM can ingest PR8 virus-induced apoptotic ATII cells. Nrf2 knockdown with siRNA sensitized ATI-like cells and ATII cells to injury induced by IAV. overexpression followed by infection with PR8 virus decreased virus replication, influenza A nucleoprotein expression, antiviral response and oxidative stress. nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a member of the family of cap\u2019n\u2019collar basic leucine zipper transcription factors. it is ubiquitously expressed throughout the lung but is found predominantly in the epithelium and alveolar macrophages. it has been reported that the antioxidant pathway controlled by Nrf2 is pivotal for protection against the development of influenza virus-induced pulmonary inflammation. ATI cells are large flat cells that cover 95% of the alveolar surface. ATI cells make and secrete pulmonary surfactant, and they proliferate to restore the epithelium after damage to the more sensitive ATI cells. this is the first study on the effect of IAV on ATI-like cells. Isolation and culture of ATII cells, ATI-like cells and AM The ATII cell isolation method has been published previously [23,24] the purity of ATII cells was 80% before plating and over 95% after adherence in culture. 80% rat-tail collagen (RTC) in DMEM with additives. 1% charcoal-stripped FBS along with 10 ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor. for an additional 2 d with 10 ng/ml KGF, 0.1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.1 mM 8-Br-cAMP, and 10 nM dexamethasone. PR8 virus was grown in 10-day-old chicken eggs. cells were inoculated with PBS or PR8 virus at a MOI of 0.05, 0.5 and 1 pfu/cell. after 1 h cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated for 24 h or 48 h. ATI-like cells were fixed with methanol and blocked with 3% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch; West Grove, PA) after 24 h, cells were infected with PR8 virus. the same protocol was used to detect Nrf2 translocation in ATI-like cells, ATII cells and AM infected with PR8 virus. PKH2 labeled AM were incubated with PKH26 labeled floating ATII cells (ratio 1:10) for 3 h. cells were mounted with Vectashield medium containing DAPI. a minimum 200 AM were counted. blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) western blotting kit. images obtained were quantitated using NIH Image 1.62 software. real-time PCR Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy mini kit. ELISA IL-8 and IL-29 were measured by ELISA (ELISA Tech., Aurora, CO) in the ATI-like and ATII cell culture supernatant according to the manufacturer's recommendations. compared ROS production in ATI-like and ATII cells transfected with Nrf2 siRNA or AdNrf2 followed by infection with PR8 virus at a MOI of 0.5 pfu/cell for 24 h. l glutathione reductase with 0.67 mg/ml 5,5\u2019-Dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid, DTNB) was initiated by the addition of 50 l of 0.67 mg/ml NADPH. the reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 l of 0.67 mg/ml NADPH. the purity of ATII cells was 80% before plating and over 95% after adherence in culture. ATII cells were plated for 2 d with 10% FBS on millicell inserts. to maintain differentiated state, ATII cells were plated for 2 d with 10% FBS. AM were cultured for 2 d in DMEM with 5% FBS for 4 d [20] in addition to glutamine, amphotericin B, streptomycin, penicillin, and gentamicin. resulting pellet was resuspended and plated in DMEM with 10% FBS. cells were allowed to express transgenes for 24 h before use. all infected cell cultures were examined for adequate infection efficiency. NT siRNA was used as negative control. cells were mounted with Vectashield medium containing DAPI. the same protocol was used to detect Nrf2 translocation in ATI-like cells, ATII cells and AM infected with PR8 virus. to detect oxidative stress induced by PR8 virus we applied rabbit anti-4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) antibody. s were mounted with Vectashield medium containing DAPI. a minimum 200 AM were counted. the phagocytic index was calculated using the following formula. gene expression levels were calculated as a ratio to the expression of the reference gene, GAPDH and data were analyzed using the Ct method. the probes for Nrf2, HO-1, Mx1 and OAS1 were designed by the manufacturer and purchased from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA) amplex Red reacts with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with a 1:1 stoichiometry to form resorufin. 50 l of samples and standards were mixed with 50 l of 100 M Amplex Red and 0.2 U/ml HRP solution. absorbance was measured at 560 nm and calculated concentrations were normalized to protein content. we used cytokeratin MFN 116 as a marker of ATI-like cells. we found that PR8 virus readily infected these cells. ATI-like cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 2 d. we observed morphological characteristics of apoptosis (Additional file 2: Figure S 2, Panel II) and a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the floating cell population than attached ATI-like and ATII cells. we also found a statistically significant higher percentage of apoptotic ATI-like cells than ATII cells, suggesting these cells are more sensitive to injury induced by PR8 virus. apoptotic cells undergo apoptosis and ingestion of apoptotic cells leads to inhibition of virus spread in vivo[36]. ATII cells did not ingest apoptotic ATII cells by AM. PR8 virus induces Nrf2 and HO-1 expression and translocation to the nucleus. ATI-like cells (a), ATII cells (b) and AM (c) were grown as described in the Methods section. ATI-like cells (Panel I), ATII cells (Panel II) and AM (Panel III) were infected at a MOI of 0.5 pfu/cell PR8 virus. Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus indicates activation of the antioxidant defense system mediated by Nrf2. panel I \u2013 Nrf2 was overexpressed by AdNrf2. cells were harvested at 24 hpi: Lane 1 - control; lane 2 - AdNrf2, lane 3 - AdGFP. a higher percentage of necrotic cells was observed in cells infected with PR8 virus. panel I \u2013 Oxidative stress was measured by immunocytofluorescence with an antibody to 4-HNE. panel II \u2013 Infection with PR8 virus significantly increased influenza A nucleoprotein and HO-1 expression. culture media from ATI-like cells inoculated with PR8 virus were collected and titrated by plaque assay. infection with AdNrf2 followed by IAV slightly decreased PR8 virus titer released into the media. results suggest that Nrf2 overexpression decreased viral replication in ATI-like cells. we also found that PR8 virus significantly increased IL-29 secretion in ATI-like cells. we did not observe higher IL-29 levels after cell infection with AdNrf2 or AdGFP. Nrf2 knockdown followed by infection with PR8 virus increased the cytotoxicity for all applied virus concentrations in comparison with PR8 virus alone. ATI-like cells were transfected with 100 nmol Nrf2 siRNA or NT siRNA for 24 h as described in the Methods section. ATI-like cells (a) and ATII cells (b) were grown as described in the Methods section. cells transfected with Nrf2 siRNA followed by infection with PR8 virus decreased ROS generation in comparison with PR8 alone. we measured GSH levels in ATI-like and ATII cells transfected with Nrf2 siRNA or AdNrf2 followed by infection at a MOI of 0.5 pfu/cell PR8 virus for 24 h. we found significantly lower levels of GSH after cell tranfection with Nrf2 siRNA followed by infection with PR8 virus. PR8 virus induces apoptosis and cytoxicity in alveolar epithelial cells IAV induces apoptosis and secondary necrosis in vitro because of the lack of phagocytes. we wanted to study the role of Nrf2 in preventing cell injury. we determined the extent of cytotoxicity of PR8 virus, which can result in apoptosis and/or necrosis. caspase 1 and caspase 3 cleavage induced by PR8 virus in ATI-like cells. cells were infected at a MOI of 0.05, 0.5 and 1 pfu/cell PR8 virus for 24 h or 48 h. ATII cells were infected with IAV and floating apoptotic cells were collected after 48 h. AM ingests PR8 virus-induced apoptotic ATII cells. ATII cells were infected with IAV. panel I, panel II, Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in alveolar cells. panel II, Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in alveolar cells. lane 2 \u2013 MOI of 0.5 pfu/cell PR8 virus. highest percentage of necrotic cells (14.1%) was observed at a MOI of 1 pfu/cell. ATI-like cells were infected for 24 h at a MOI of 200 pfu/cell AdNrf2 or AdGFP as described in the Methods section. data represent results from three independent experiments. we analyzed the level of 4-HNE. PR8 virus induced oxidative stress and 4-HNE immunostaining was decreased after cell infection with AdNrf2 followed by PR8 virus. panel III \u2013 AdNrf2 decreased replication of PR8 virus in comparison with PR8 alone. cells were infected with IAV or AdNrf2 followed by infection with PR8 virus. media were harvested 24 h after inoculation and titrated by plaque assay. f2 overexpression did not increase Mx1 and OAS1 mRNA (Figure 7, Panel IV) however, PR8 virus significantly reduced expression of these genes in comparison with IAV alone. expression level of Nrf2 plays a role in decreasing infection of IAV in ATI-like cells by antiviral activity of Nrf2. cells were infected with 1 pfu/cell PR8 virus, infected with AdNrf2 or AdGFP for 24 h and/or followed by infection with PR8 for 24 h or 48 h. data represent results from three independent experiments. Nrf2 knockdown sensitizes ATI-like cells to injury induced by PR8 virus. PR8 virus generates ROS Among the methods commonly used to measure H2O2. we transfected ATI-like cells and ATII cells with Nrf2 siRNA followed by infection with PR8 virus. cell transfection with Nrf2 siRNA followed by infection with PR8 virus increased ROS production in comparison with PR8 virus alone. Statistically significant decrease in comparison with control. Nrf2 regulates alveolar cells\u2019 susceptibility to infection and injury induced by PR8 virus. to our knowledge there are only two reports on the role of Nrf2 and influenza virus. we found that Nrf2 overexpression using AdNrf2 decreased IAV replication, influenza A nucleoprotein expression, antiviral gene expression, ROS generation and oxidative stress. we found that Nrf2 knockdown followed by infection with PR8 virus decreased cell viability, increased ROS generation and decreased GSH levels. pfu/cell PR8 virus induces IL-8 and IL-29 secretion in ATI-like and ATII cells. the protective effect of Nrf2 also suggests that under certain circumstances, IL-8 might have a protective function and serves an anti-inflammatory role in remodeling during the resolution of inflammation. ATII cells infected with PR8 virus measured caspase 1 and 3 cleavage. this is the first study on the effect of IAV on ATI-like cells. this is the first study on the effect of IAV on ATI-like cells. ATI-like cells are more sensitive to PR8 virus. ATI-like (Panel I) and ATII (Panel II) cells were infected with PR8 virus at a MOI of 0.05, 0.5 or 1 pfu/cell.
