XKB alters plasma PKs of midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ in rats. midazolam is a well-known probe substrate for human CYP3A4/5. it is unclear if it is an appropriate probe for determining rat Cyp3a activity in vivo. oral administration of XKB at 7 mg/kg significantly changed the AUC0\u2013t of midazolam. the ratio of plasma AUC for 1\u2032-OH-MDZ over that of midazolam was significantly decreased by 42.6% in rats treated orally with XKB 14 mg/kg. plasma concentration-time profiles of MDZ up to 6 hours after 8 consecutive days of intraperitoneal injection of XKB (14 mg/kg, ), XKB (7 mg/kg, ), soybean oil(), or physiological saline (\u2022), followed on day 9 by oral administration of MDZ 20 mg/kg. data represent the mean standard deviation (n=8). 6813.27 Cmax g/mL 1.580.79 0.980.60 3.461.72*,## 1.330.54 2.791.48*,## AUC0\u2013t g/mLmin 161.9269.06 102.9643.06 369.45275.09*,# 145.3747.84# 272.83188.08*,## AUMC g/mLmin2 13,77112,630 9,8329,553 33 a single dose of ketoconazole 75 mg/kg significantly increased the Cmax, AUC0\u2013t, and AUC0\u2013inf of midazolam by 3.5-fold, 3.6-fold, and 3.6-fold, respectively. a single dose of ketoconazole 75 mg/kg significantly increased the Cmax, AUC0\u2013t, and AUC0\u2013inf of midazolam by 3.5-fold, 3.6-fold, and 3.6-fold, respectively the ratio of plasma AUC of 1\u2032-OH-MDZ over that of midazolam was significantly decreased by 66.2% in rats treated orally with ketoconazole 75 mg/kg. XKB 7 or 14 mg/kg significantly reduced the metabolism of midazolam in rats without marked dose dependence. the possibility of modulation of other pathways by XKB cannot be excluded. treatment of XKB at 7 or 14 mg/kg decreased Cyp3a2 activity by 6.27% (P>0.05) and 29.27% (P0.001), respectively. administration of XKB for 8 days significantly inhibited expression of Cyp3a2 in the rat liver. XKB interacted with the rat hepatic Cyp3a2 homology model via hydrogen bond formation. XKB interacted with the rat hepatic Cyp3a2 homology model via hydrogen bond formation. XKB can regulate Cyp3a-mediated drug metabolism by suppressing the activity and expression of Cyp3a in vivo. XKB shared a number of molecular targets with probucol, which was initially developed as an antihyperlipidemic drug for the treatment of coronary artery diseases. the overlapped molecular targets suggest that XKB can regulate the same targets and signaling pathways as probucol. the rat Cyp3a2 homology model was built based on human CYP3A4 (PDB ID 4K9W) the rat Cyp3a2 homology model shared 83.3% sequence similarity and 68.4% identity with human CYP3A4. this difference may affect the interaction between XKB and rat Cyp3a2. XKB administration for 8 days significantly elevated the AUC0\u2013t and Cmax of midazolam, but decreased its CL/F. XKB also showed an inhibitory effect on the metabolism of midazolam and its main metabolite 1\u2032-OH-MDZ. XKB may regulate ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation to downregulate the content of rat hepatic Cyp3a2. XKB may have profound therapeutic effects due to interactions with its potential multiple targets. however, a multitargeted agent may also result in side effects. XKB may behave as a CYP3A4/Cyp3a2 substrate and/or inhibitor. the molecular targets and modulating effects of XKB on human CYPs need to be further examined and functionally validated."}
